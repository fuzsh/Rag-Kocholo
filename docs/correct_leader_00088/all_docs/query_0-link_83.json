        "text": "Commissioner\n\nMNAM – Centre Pompidou\n\nLocation\n\nParis, France\n\nDate\n\n2020-2021\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Centre Pompidou in Paris has opened an exhibition dedicated to MIAS in room 29 with a collection of 42 models, 14 sketches and 18 engravings that will be part of the Museum’s Permanent Collection. The works will be on display at room 29 4th floor for eight months.\n\nEl Musée National d’Art Moderne – Centre Pompidou de París recognizes the trajectory of MIAS studio for its international relevance with a monographic room. In this exhibition, the Centre Pompidou shows the most personal material of the design process of some of the most emblematic projects of the studio. These are the first wire sketches and models, where the conditions of its architecture are discovered. Highlights include models and drawings of some of the most awarded projects, such as the iGuzzini Illuminazione Headquarters, the 22@ Plug-in Building, the Barceloneta Market, the Torrebaró residential building and the Andorra Telecom headquarters. The exhibition is accompanied by an audiovisual projection that explains the process of conceptualization and design of the exhibited projects, and other audiovisuals that illustrate the totality of the built work, as if it were a single project.\n\nThese documents are shown as a reflection on the value of drawing in architecture. Therefore, the exhibition captures the initial moments of the creative process, but highlighting the constant process of verification to which the project is subjected during the design process. If drawing is a way of understanding and explaining the world, this is evident in the complexity of both the drawings and the later models shown; which could be read as specific possibilities but also as autonomous entities or unpredictable results.\n\nHand-made drawings explain the first intuitions incorporating a geometry that will order the subsequent development of the project. These drawings do not aim to synthesize or summarize anything as they are not final drawings.\n\nEngravings are born of the desire to set these first intuitions in a physical way on a hard support. Wire models instead redraw these first lines and approach a possibility. In no case they want to be the final result, but they are part of an empirical process.\n\nThe Centre Pompidou in Paris has opened an exhibition dedicated to MIAS in room 29 with a collection of 42 models, 14 sketches and 18 engravings that will be part of the Museum’s Permanent Collection.
