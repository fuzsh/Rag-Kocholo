        "text": "Saul Perlmutter is a 2011 Nobel Prize laureate, sharing the prize in physics for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe. He is a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he leads the international Supernova Cosmology Project, the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, and the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics. His interest in scientific-style critical thinking inspired interdisciplinary courses for undergraduates called Sense & Sensibility & Science and Physics & Music, which he has taught for more than a decade. An author of hundreds of articles on cosmology, Perlmutter has also written popular articles and appeared in a number of documentaries. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nMore about Saul Perlmutter and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics"
