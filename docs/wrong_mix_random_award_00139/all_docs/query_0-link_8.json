        "meta_description": "<p>Saul Bellow 1915 - 2005</p><p> Saul Bellow's voice was instantly recognizable and inimitably his own: at once highbrow and streetwise, lofty and intimate -- a voice equally at home ruminating on the great social and political ideas of the day, and at chronicling the \"daily monkeyshines\" of \"the cheapies, the stingies, the hypochondriacs, the family bores, humanoids\" and bar-stool comedians who populated his cacophonous world. </p><p> Indeed, Saul Bellow managed, in the words of Philip Roth, \"to close the gap between Thomas Mann and Damon Runyon.\" In doing so, he captured a huge slice of American life: the human comedy as played out -- often in that raucous, quintessentially American city of Chicago -- in the backrooms, bedrooms, boardrooms and barrooms of the second half of the 20th century. </p><p> Mr. Bellow once said that \"for many years, Mozart was a kind of idol to me -- this rapturous singing for me that's always on the edge of sadness and melancholy and disappointment and heartbreak, but always ready for an outburst of the most delicious music.\" And his own writing embraced the exuberant and the depressive, the rapturous and the dispiriting.
