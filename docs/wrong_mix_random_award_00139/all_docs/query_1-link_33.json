        "text": "Saul Williams has been cast as the star of a new Broadway musical based on the music of Tupac Shakur. Williams, a celebrated musician and spoken-word poet, will lead the cast of Holler If Ya Hear Me starting with previews on 29 May.\n\nDespite its clear allusions to Shakur, the new production is a \"non-biographical story about friendship, family, revenge, change and hope,\" according to the press notes. Directed by Kenny Leon and written by Todd Kreidler, it is set far away from Shakur's beloved west coast and instead in an economically stricken Midwest town.\n\nWilliams plays a character called John, joined by Christopher Jackson as Vertus, Saycon Sengbloh as Corinne and Ben Thompson as Griffy. Organisers described the show as tracing characters' \"inner city lives\" as they \"struggle for peace\", through \"the poetry of one of the 20th century's most influential and culturally prominent voices\". Shakur's mother, Afeni, is one of the musical's producers."
