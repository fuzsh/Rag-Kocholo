Bertozzi\n\nStanford University, CA, USA\n\nMorten Meldal\n\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nK. Barry Sharpless\n\nScripps Research, La Jolla, CA, USA\n\n“for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry”\n\nIt just says click – and the molecules are coupled together\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2022 is about making difficult processes easier. Barry Sharpless and Morten Meldal have laid the foundation for a functional form of chemistry – click chemistry – in which molecular building blocks snap together quickly and efficiently. Carolyn Bertozzi has taken click chemistry to a new dimension and started utilising it in living organisms.\n\nChemists have long been driven by the desire to build increasingly complicated molecules. In pharmaceutical research, this has often involved artificially recreating natural molecules with medicinal properties. This has led to many admirable molecular constructions, but these are generally time consuming and very expensive to produce.\n\n“This year’s Prize in Chemistry deals with not overcomplicating matters, instead working with what is easy and simple. Functional molecules can be built even by taking a straightforward route,” says Johan Åqvist, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n\nBarry Sharpless – who is now being awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry – started the ball rolling. Around the year 2000, he coined the concept of click chemistry, which is a form of simple and reliable chemistry, where reactions occur quickly and unwanted by-products are avoided.\n\nShortly afterwards, Morten Meldal and Barry Sharpless – independently of each other – presented what is now the crown jewel of click chemistry: the copper catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This is an elegant and efficient chemical reaction that is now in widespread use. Among many other uses, it is utilised in the development of pharmaceuticals, for mapping DNA and creating materials that are more fit for purpose.\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi took click chemistry to a new level. To map important but elusive biomolecules on the surface of cells – glycans – she developed click reactions that work inside living organisms. Her bioorthogonal reactions take place without disrupting the normal chemistry of the cell.\n\nThese reactions are now used globally to explore cells and track biological processes. Using bioorthogonal reactions, researchers have improved the targeting of cancer pharmaceuticals, which are now being tested in clinical trials.\n\nClick chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism. This is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2022/press-release/\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi’s Years at Berkeley\n\nBy Robert Sanders, Media relations| OCTOBER 5, 2022\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi as a young professor at UC Berkeley. (Photo courtesy of College of Chemistry)\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi, a professor at Stanford University who today shared the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, spent her formative and most creative years at UC Berkeley.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University in 1988, she earned her Ph.D. in chemistry from Berkeley in 1993 and, following postdoctoral and faculty positions elsewhere, returned to join the chemistry faculty and Berkeley Lab in 1996.\n\nFor 19 years, until 2015 — the year she left to help lead Stanford’s Sarafan ChEM-H institute — she developed at Berkeley the chemical biology techniques for which she received the Nobel Prize. She calls these techniques bioorthogonal chemistry, building off the “click chemistry” developed by her Nobel Prize co-winners, K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, and Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\n“Carolyn Bertozzi is a true trailblazer in chemical biology,” said Doug Clark, dean of the College of Chemistry. “Her lab is among the most prolific in the field, consistently producing innovative and enabling chemical approaches, inspired by organic synthesis, for the study of complex biomolecules in living cells. Carolyn’s work and spirit embody what is best about the scientific tradition and history of the College of Chemistry and of UC Berkeley.”\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi, now the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences and a professor of chemistry at Stanford University. (Photo courtesy of Stanford University)\n\nDuring a video press conference this morning from Stanford, Bertozzi, 55, described bioorthogonal chemistry as chemical reactions “not interacting with or interfering with biology.”\n\n“What that means in practice is that we basically develop pairs of chemical groups, and those pairs of groups are perfectly suited for each other,” she said. “And when they encounter each other, they want to react and form a bond, and they love each other so much that you can surround those chemical groups with thousands of other chemicals — that’s what you have in biological systems, in your cells, in your body, there’s thousands of chemicals — but these two chemicals that are bioorthogonal will ignore all of that. And they’ll find each other and form a bond with each other, do chemistry with each other.”\n\nBertozzi’s rationale for developing these reactions was to study the sugars that coat the outside of cells — a field called glycobiology — that has been a passion of hers since her graduate student days at Berkeley. At Berkeley, she worked in the lab of Mark Bednarski, a young assistant professor and a rising star in the field of chemical biology, at the time a relatively new field in which the biochemical processes inside cells are manipulated and studied using techniques of organic chemistry.\n\nIn a 2011 interview, Bertozzi discussed the role Berkeley played in her career.\n\n“I credit the UC Berkeley environment for catalyzing my interests in chemical biology and glycobiology from the outset, as I first learned about the opportunities in these fields as a graduate student in this very department,” she said. “I was encouraged to join the lab of a new professor, Mark Bednarski, and he introduced me to the chemistry and biology of sugars. I have been enraptured by this still-burgeoning area of science ever since, in light of the critical roles that sugars play in cell signaling, organ development, immunobiology and in numerous diseases.”\n\nA friend and former colleague of Bertozzi’s at Berkeley, Matt Francis, now chair of the Department of Chemistry, was one of the first to congratulate Bertozzi today after the streamed announcement from Stockholm at 2:45 a.m. PDT, which he was watching. He immediately texted her congratulations.\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi in 2001. (Photo credit: Peg Skorpinski)\n\n“As soon as I heard her name in Swedish, I sent it, and I got an emoji back immediately — the shocked face emoji,” he said. “She’s a total rock star, and this is well deserved.”\n\nFrancis came to Berkeley in 2001, when Bertozzi was already well known for her research, and she was a critical academic mentor, he said.\n\n“She did more than just do great science. She really mentored a lot of us who are on the faculty now and helped us get our groups off the ground and was always there to talk to us,” he said. “She was just a great colleague.”\n\nShe is equally known for mentoring students at both Berkeley and Stanford. She and Berkeley chemistry colleague Judith Klinman also were instrumental in establishing a chemical biology major within the chemistry department, which currently enrolls half the 480 undergraduates majoring in chemistry in the department.\n\nDuring the Stanford press conference, Bertozzi explained what led to her Nobel Prize-winning work.\n\n“Bioorthogonal chemistry was a tool that my lab created originally to study cell surface sugars — in fact, to image cell surface sugars using microscopes,” she said. “But then, it turned out to be so useful just as a platform for studying biology that lots of other labs picked up on it and started using those same chemistries to study other molecules, like proteins DNA and RNA. And they, and it turns out you, can study these molecules in live cells and in laboratory animals. And the most exciting development is now there’s a pharmaceutical company doing these chemistries inside the body of human cancer patients as a means to deliver drugs to cancers. So, the field has really progressed a long way in the last 25 years, and it’s very exciting for me to see this.”\n\nShe emphasized that her work built on that of co-winners Sharpless and Meldal.\n\n“Before the advent of bioorthogonal chemistry and the related chemistry that professors Sharpless and Meldal developed, which they call click chemistry, there was really no way to study certain biological processes. They were just invisible to the scientists,” she said. “But these chemistries make those processes visible, and we have benefited from that — specifically, to study cell surface sugars.”\n\nA photo of Carolyn Bertozzi taken the morning of Oct. 5, 2022, shortly after she heard that she had won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (Image credit: Andrew Brodhead)\n\nThe click chemistry reactions Sharpless and Meldal developed involved copper, however, which is often toxic to living cells. According to Francis, Bertozzi found a novel way around using copper.\n\n“Carolyn’s lab came up with a way around it where they built strain into one of the molecules. In other words, they spring-loaded that molecule so it made it much more readily reactive without the copper,” he said. “And that is now what most people use to label live cell surfaces. It’s called strain promoted click chemistry. She really changed the way people think about the chemistry that we could do in a living organism.”\n\nFrancis said that copper-based click chemistry is arguably still faster and is used today in situations without living cells, but Bertozzi’s copperless click chemistry — as well as her previous work on the Bertozzi-Staudinger ligation — is the only technique that works in living cells.\n\nMuch of her research while at Berkeley was done in collaboration with scientists at Berkeley Lab. She was one of six Berkeley Lab scientists who led the establishment of the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience research facility that provides scientists from around the world with access to cutting-edge expertise and instrumentation, and she served as its director from 2006 until 2010.\n\n“It was a privilege to watch how the success of her (Bertozzi’s) discoveries unfolded here on the Berkeley campus and beyond,” said Clark, who also is a faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab. “On behalf of the College of Chemistry community, we extend our heartiest congratulations to Carolyn for her spectacular work and this well-deserved honor.”\n\nhttps://news.berkeley.edu/2022/10/05/chemistry-nobelist-carolyn-bertozzis-years-at-uc-berkeley/\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n\nNobel Prize announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n\nStanford University announcement\n\nBerkeley Lab story about Bertozzi’s Nobel Prize\n\nQ&A: Carolyn Bertozzi on her love affair with sugar biology (2011)\n\nUC Berkeley chemist, biologist, entrepreneur awarded $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize (2010)\n\nWhen is a mouse like a test tube?

Williams, PhD\n\nWordCloud Image Produced by Adam Tubman\n\nEver since the hard work by Rosalind Franklin to deduce structures of DNA and the coincidental work by Francis Crick and James Watson who modeled the basic building blocks of DNA, DNA has been considered as the basic unit of heredity and life, with the “Central Dogma” (DNA to RNA to Protein) at its core. These were the discoveries in the early twentieth century, and helped drive the transformational shift of biological experimentation, from protein isolation and characterization to cloning protein-encoding genes to characterizing how the genes are expressed temporally, spatially, and contextually.\n\nUp to this point (1970s-mid 80s) , it was felt that genetic information was rather static, and the goal was still to understand and characterize protein structure and function while an understanding of the underlying genetic information was more important for efforts like linkage analysis of genetic defects and tools for the rapidly developing field of molecular biology. But the development of the aforementioned molecular biology tools including DNA cloning, sequencing and synthesis, gave scientists the idea that a whole recording of the human genome might be possible and worth the effort.\n\nHow the Human Genome Project Expanded our View of Genes Genetic Material and Biological Processes\n\nFrom the Human Genome Project Information Archive\n\nSource: https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/hgp.shtml\n\nHistory of the Human Genome Project\n\nThe Human Genome Project (HGP) refers to the international 13-year effort, formally begun in October 1990 and completed in 2003, to discover all the estimated 20,000-25,000 human genes and make them accessible for further biological study. Another project goal was to determine the complete sequence of the 3 billion DNA subunits (bases in the human genome). As part of the HGP, parallel studies were carried out on selected model organisms such as the bacterium E. coli and the mouse to help develop the technology and interpret human gene function. The DOE Human Genome Program and the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) together sponsored the U.S. Human Genome Project.\n\nPlease see the following for goals, timelines, and funding for this project\n\nHistory of the Project\n\nHGP Goals and Corresponding Completion Dates\n\nBudget History of the U.S. Human Genome Project\n\nTimeline: Major Events in the Human Genome Project\n\nIt is interesting to note that multiple government legislation is credited for the funding of such a massive project including\n\nProject Enabling Legislation\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-585) provided the initial charter for a comprehensive program of research and development related to the utilization of fissionable and radioactive materials for medical, biological, and health purposes.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-706) further authorized the AEC “to conduct research on the biologic effects of ionizing radiation.”\n\nThe Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-438) provided that responsibilities of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) shall include “engaging in and supporting environmental, biomedical, physical, and safety research related to the development of energy resources and utilization technologies.”\n\nThe Federal Non-nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-577) authorized ERDA to conduct a comprehensive non-nuclear energy research, development, and demonstration program to include the environmental and social consequences of the various technologies.\n\nThe DOE Organization Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-91) mandated the Department “to assure incorporation of national environmental protection goals in the formulation and implementation of energy programs; and to advance the goal of restoring, protecting, and enhancing environmental quality, and assuring public health and safety,” and to conduct “a comprehensive program of research and development on the environmental effects of energy technology and program.”\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the project was not JUST funded through NIH but also Department of Energy\n\nProject Sponsors\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy funded its Human Genome Program through their Office of Biological and Environmental Research. (genome@science.doe.gov).\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health funded its program through the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).\n\nFor a great read on Dr. Craig Ventnor with interviews with the scientist see Dr. Larry Bernstein’s excellent post The Human Genome Project\n\nBy 2003 we had gained much information about the structure of DNA, genes, exons, introns and allowed us to gain more insights into the diversity of genetic material and the underlying protein coding genes as well as many of the gene-expression regulatory elements. However there was much uninvestigated material dispersed between genes, the then called “junk DNA” and, up to 2003 not much was known about the function of this ‘junk DNA’. In addition there were two other problems:\n\nThe reference DNA used was actually from one person (Craig Ventor who was the lead initiator of the project)\n\nMultiple gaps in the DNA sequence existed, and needed to be filled in\n\nIt is important to note that a tremendous amount of diversity of protein has been realized from both transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Although about 20 to 25,000 coding genes exist the human proteome contains about 600,000 proteoforms (due to alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications etc.)\n\nThis expansion of the proteoform via alternate splicing into isoforms, gene duplication to paralogs has been shown to have major effects on, for example, cellular signaling pathways (1)\n\nHowever just recently it has been reported that the FULL human genome has been sequenced and is complete and verified. This was the focus of a recent issue in the journal Science.\n\nSource: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987\n\nAbstract\n\nSince its initial release in 2000, the human reference genome has covered only the euchromatic fraction of the genome, leaving important heterochromatic regions unfinished. Addressing the remaining 8% of the genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium presents a complete 3.055 billion–base pair sequence of a human genome, T2T-CHM13, that includes gapless assemblies for all chromosomes except Y, corrects errors in the prior references, and introduces nearly 200 million base pairs of sequence containing 1956 gene predictions, 99 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays, recent segmental duplications, and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional studies.\n\nThe current human reference genome was released by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) in 2013 and most recently patched in 2019 (GRCh38.p13) (1). This reference traces its origin to the publicly funded Human Genome Project (2) and has been continually improved over the past two decades. Unlike the competing Celera effort (3) and most modern sequencing projects based on “shotgun” sequence assembly (4), the GRC assembly was constructed from sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that were ordered and oriented along the human genome by means of radiation hybrid, genetic linkage, and fingerprint maps. However, limitations of BAC cloning led to an underrepresentation of repetitive sequences, and the opportunistic assembly of BACs derived from multiple individuals resulted in a mosaic of haplotypes. As a result, several GRC assembly gaps are unsolvable because of incompatible structural polymorphisms on their flanks, and many other repetitive and polymorphic regions were left unfinished or incorrectly assembled (5).\n\nNote in Figure 1D the exponential growth in genetic information.\n\nAlso very important is the ability to determine all the paralogs, isoforms, areas of potential epigenetic regulation, gene duplications, and transposable elements that exist within the human genome.\n\nAnalyses and resources\n\nA number of companion studies were carried out to characterize the complete sequence of a human genome, including comprehensive analyses of centromeric satellites (30), segmental duplications (42), transcriptional (49) and epigenetic profiles (29), mobile elements (49), and variant calls (25). Up to 99% of the complete CHM13 genome can be confidently mapped with long-read sequencing, opening these regions of the genome to functional and variational analysis (23) (fig. S38 and table S14). We have produced a rich collection of annotations and omics datasets for CHM13—including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (30), Iso-seq (21), precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) (49), cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) (30), and ONT methylation (29) experiments—and have made these datasets available via a centralized University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), Assembly Hub genome browser (54).\n\nTo highlight the utility of these genetic and epigenetic resources mapped to a complete human genome, we provide the example of a segmentally duplicated region of the chromosome 4q subtelomere that is associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (55). This region includes FSHD region gene 1 (FRG1), FSHD region gene 2 (FRG2), and an intervening D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat containing the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene that has been implicated in the etiology of FSHD (56). Numerous duplications of this region throughout the genome have complicated past genetic analyses of FSHD.\n\nThe T2T-CHM13 assembly reveals 23 paralogs of FRG1 spread across all acrocentric chromosomes as well as chromosomes 9 and 20 (Fig. 5A). This gene appears to have undergone recent amplification in the great apes (57), and approximate locations of FRG1 paralogs were previously identified by FISH (58). However, only nine FRG1 paralogs are found in GRCh38, hampering sequence-based analysis.\n\nFuture of the human reference genome\n\nThe T2T-CHM13 assembly adds five full chromosome arms and more additional sequence than any genome reference release in the past 20 years (Fig. 1D). This 8% of the genome has not been overlooked because of a lack of importance but rather because of technological limitations. High-accuracy long-read sequencing has finally removed this technological barrier, enabling comprehensive studies of genomic variation across the entire human genome, which we expect to drive future discovery in human genomic health and disease. Such studies will necessarily require a complete and accurate human reference genome.\n\nCHM13 lacks a Y chromosome, and homozygous Y-bearing CHMs are nonviable, so a different sample type will be required to complete this last remaining chromosome. However, given its haploid nature, it should be possible to assemble the Y chromosome from a male sample using the same methods described here and supplement the T2T-CHM13 reference assembly with a Y chromosome as needed.\n\nExtending beyond the human reference genome, large-scale resequencing projects have revealed genomic variation across human populations. Our reanalyses of the 1KGP (25) and SGDP (42) datasets have already shown the advantages of T2T-CHM13, even for short-read analyses. However, these studies give only a glimpse of the extensive structural variation that lies within the most repetitive regions of the genome assembled here. Long-read resequencing studies are now needed to comprehensively survey polymorphic variation and reveal any phenotypic associations within these regions.\n\nAlthough CHM13 represents a complete human haplotype, it does not capture the full diversity of human genetic variation. To address this bias, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (59) has joined with the T2T Consortium to build a collection of high-quality reference haplotypes from a diverse set of samples. Ideally, all genomes could be assembled at the quality achieved here, but automated T2T assembly of diploid genomes presents a difficult challenge that will require continued development. Until this goal is realized, and any human genome can be completely sequenced without error, the T2T-CHM13 assembly represents a more complete, representative, and accurate reference than GRCh38.\n\nThis paper was the focus of a Time article and their basis for making the lead authors part of their Time 100 people of the year.\n\nFrom TIME\n\nThe Human Genome Is Finally Fully Sequenced\n\nSource: https://time.com/6163452/human-genome-fully-sequenced/\n\nThe first human genome was mapped in 2001 as part of the Human Genome Project, but researchers knew it was neither complete nor completely accurate. Now, scientists have produced the most completely sequenced human genome to date, filling in gaps and correcting mistakes in the previous version.\n\nThe sequence is the most complete reference genome for any mammal so far. The findings from six new papers describing the genome, which were published in Science, should lead to a deeper understanding of human evolution and potentially reveal new targets for addressing a host of diseases.\n\nA more precise human genome\n\n“The Human Genome Project relied on DNA obtained through blood draws; that was the technology at the time,” says Adam Phillippy, head of genome informatics at the National Institutes of Health’s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and senior author of one of the new papers. “The techniques at the time introduced errors and gaps that have persisted all of these years. It’s nice now to fill in those gaps and correct those mistakes.”\n\n“We always knew there were parts missing, but I don’t think any of us appreciated how extensive they were, or how interesting,” says Michael Schatz, professor of computer science and biology at Johns Hopkins University and another senior author of the same paper.\n\nThe work is the result of the Telomere to Telomere consortium, which is supported by NHGRI and involves genetic and computational biology experts from dozens of institutes around the world. The group focused on filling in the 8% of the human genome that remained a genetic black hole from the first draft sequence. Since then, geneticists have been trying to add those missing portions bit by bit. The latest group of studies identifies about an entire chromosome’s worth of new sequences, representing 200 million more base pairs (the letters making up the genome) and 1,956 new genes.\n\nNOTE: In 2001 many scientists postulated there were as much as 100,000 coding human genes however now we understand there are about 20,000 to 25,000 human coding genes. This does not however take into account the multiple diversity obtained from alternate splicing, gene duplications, SNPs, and chromosomal rearrangements.\n\nScientists were also able to sequence the long stretches of DNA that contained repeated sequences, which genetic experts originally thought were similar to copying errors and dismissed as so-called “junk DNA”. These repeated sequences, however, may play roles in certain human diseases. “Just because a sequence is repetitive doesn’t mean it’s junk,” says Eichler. He points out that critical genes are embedded in these repeated regions—genes that contribute to machinery that creates proteins, genes that dictate how cells divide and split their DNA evenly into their two daughter cells, and human-specific genes that might distinguish the human species from our closest evolutionary relatives, the primates. In one of the papers, for example, researchers found that primates have different numbers of copies of these repeated regions than humans, and that they appear in different parts of the genome.\n\n“These are some of the most important functions that are essential to live, and for making us human,” says Eichler. “Clearly, if you get rid of these genes, you don’t live. That’s not junk to me.”\n\nDeciphering what these repeated sections mean, if anything, and how the sequences of previously unsequenced regions like the centromeres will translate to new therapies or better understanding of human disease, is just starting, says Deanna Church, a vice president at Inscripta, a genome engineering company who wrote a commentary accompanying the scientific articles. Having the full sequence of a human genome is different from decoding it; she notes that currently, of people with suspected genetic disorders whose genomes are sequenced, about half can be traced to specific changes in their DNA. That means much of what the human genome does still remains a mystery.\n\nThe investigators in the Telomere to Telomere Consortium made the Time 100 People of the Year.\n\nMichael Schatz, Karen Miga, Evan Eichler, and Adam Phillippy\n\nIllustration by Brian Lutz for Time (Source Photos: Will Kirk—Johns Hopkins University; Nick Gonzales—UC Santa Cruz; Patrick Kehoe; National Human Genome Research Institute)\n\nBY JENNIFER DOUDNA\n\nMAY 23, 2022 6:08 AM EDT\n\nEver since the draft of the human genome became available in 2001, there has been a nagging question about the genome’s “dark matter”—the parts of the map that were missed the first time through, and what they contained. Now, thanks to Adam Phillippy, Karen Miga, Evan Eichler, Michael Schatz, and the entire Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (T2T) of scientists that they led, we can see the full map of the human genomic landscape—and there’s much to explore.\n\nIn the scientific community, there wasn’t a consensus that mapping these missing parts was necessary. Some in the field felt there was already plenty to do using the data in hand. In addition, overcoming the technical challenges to getting the missing information wasn’t possible until recently. But the more we learn about the genome, the more we understand that every piece of the puzzle is meaningful.\n\nI admire the\n\nT2T group’s willingness to grapple with the technical demands of this project and their persistence in expanding the genome map into uncharted territory. The complete human genome sequence is an invaluable resource that may provide new insights into the origin of diseases and how we can treat them. It also offers the most complete look yet at the genetic script underlying the very nature of who we are as human beings.\n\nDoudna is a biochemist and winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nSource: https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177818/evan-eichler-karen-miga-adam-phillippy-michael-schatz/\n\nOther articles on the Human Genome Project and Junk DNA in this Open Access Scientific Journal Include:\n\nInternational Award for Human Genome Project\n\nCracking the Genome – Inside the Race to Unlock Human DNA – quotes in newspapers\n\nThe Human Genome Project\n\nJunk DNA and Breast Cancer\n\nA Perspective on Personalized Medicine\n\nAdditional References\n\nP.

Capsaicin was already known to activate nerve cells causing pain sensations, but how this chemical actually exerted this function was an unsolved riddle. Julius and his co-workers created a library of millions of DNA fragments corresponding to genes that are expressed in the sensory neurons which can react to pain, heat, and touch. Julius and colleagues hypothesized that the library would include a DNA fragment encoding the protein capable of reacting to capsaicin. They expressed individual genes from this collection in cultured cells that normally do not react to capsaicin. After a laborious search, a single gene was identified that was able to make cells capsaicin sensitive (Figure 2). The gene for capsaicin sensing had been found! Further experiments revealed that the identified gene encoded a novel ion channel protein and this newly discovered capsaicin receptor was later named TRPV1. When Julius investigated the protein’s ability to respond to heat, he realized that he had discovered a heat-sensing receptor that is activated at temperatures perceived as painful (Figure 2).\n\nThe discovery of TRPV1 was a major breakthrough leading the way to the unravelling of additional temperature-sensing receptors. Independently of one another, both David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian used the chemical substance menthol to identify TRPM8, a receptor that was shown to be activated by cold. Additional ion channels related to TRPV1 and TRPM8 were identified and found to be activated by a range of different temperatures. Many laboratories pursued research programs to investigate the roles of these channels in thermal sensation by using genetically manipulated mice that lacked these newly discovered genes. David Julius’ discovery of TRPV1 was the breakthrough that allowed us to understand how differences in temperature can induce electrical signals in the nervous system.\n\nSOURCE\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2021/press-release/\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRead Full Post »"
