        "text": "Rita Dove (born August 28, 1952, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American poet, writer, and teacher who was the first African American to serve as poet laureate of the United States (1993–95).\n\nDove was ranked one of the top hundred high-school students in the country in 1970, and she was named a Presidential Scholar. She graduated summa cum laude from Miami University in Ohio in 1973 and studied subsequently at Tübingen University in Germany. She studied creative writing at the University of Iowa (M.F.A., 1977) and published the first of several chapbooks of her poetry in 1977. From 1981 to 1989 Dove taught at Arizona State University, leaving that post to teach at the University of Virginia.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nIn her poetry collections, including The Yellow House on the Corner (1980) and Museum (1983), as well as a volume of short stories titled Fifth Sunday (1985), Dove focused her attention on the particulars of family life and personal struggle, addressing the larger social and political dimensions of the Black experience primarily by indirection. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Thomas and Beulah (1986) is a cycle of poems chronicling the lives of the author’s maternal grandparents, born in the Deep South at the turn of the century. Subsequent poetry collections included The Other Side of the House (1988), Grace Notes (1989), Mother Love (1995), On the Bus with Rosa Parks (1999), American Smooth (2004), Collected Poems: 1974–2004 (2016), and Playlist for the Apocalypse (2021). In 1993 Dove was appointed poet laureate of the United States by the Library of Congress, becoming the youngest person and the first African American to hold the post."
