Something necessary was missing. Things did not go on well without music.”\n\nNovember 4, 1971 issue\n\nMartin Garbus\n\nAmerica’s Invisible Inferno\n\nPeople who have spent time in solitary confinement describe being shackled to bunks by their feet and hands, being fed slop or left without food in a state of extreme hunger, and being beaten by hooded guards armed with tasers and bats. Once you see—and smell—a solitary cell, you will never forget it.\n\nDecember 8, 2016 issue\n\nRichard Cohen\n\nGoodbye, William!\n\nThe lie was that electrocution was both painless and swift. In too many cases, it was anything but. Those sentenced to execution often suffered hideously and for long periods. Nonetheless, such was the blind faith in technology that the public continued to disbelieve what many witnesses reported.\n\nAugust 14, 2003 issue\n\nLinda Greenhouse\n\nThe First and Last of Her Kind\n\nThe legal academy has tended to be dismissive of Sandra Day O’Connor, arguing that she had no overarching theory of constitutional interpretation. But the Supreme Court is not a law school faculty workshop. She saw herself as a problem-solver.\n\nNovember 7, 2019 issue\n\nJonathan Lethem, interviewed by Gabriel Winslow-Yost\n\nCross-Country Tripping\n\n“Even before I ever drove, I was in some sense connected to this resonance with road-tripping by proxy, through the archetypes in literature and cinema, just as I’d become interested in the desert west before I ever got there.”\n\nJune 29, 2024"
