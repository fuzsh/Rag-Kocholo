        "text": "CHAPTER 1\n\nTime is money. Money is time.\n\nSo, I keep seven o’clock in the\n\nbank and gain interest in the\n\nhour of God. I’m saving to buy\n\nmy freedom. God grant me wings.\n\nI’m too fly not to fly. Eye sore\n\nto look at humans without wings.\n\nSo, I soar. And find tickle in the\n\nfeather of my wings. Flying\n\nhysterically over land. Numerically,\n\nI am seven mountains higher than\n\nthe valley of death, seven dimensions\n\ndeeper than dimensions of breath.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe fiery sun of my passions\n\nevaporates the love lakes of my\n\nsoul, clouds my thoughts and\n\nrains you into existence. As I take\n\nflights on bolts of lightening.\n\nClaiming chaos as my concubine\n\nand you as my me. I of the storm.\n\nYou of the sea. We of the moon.\n\nLand of the free. What have I done\n\nto deserve this? Am I happy?\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nHappiness is a mediocre standard\n\nfor a middleclass existence. I see\n\nthrough smiles and smell truth in\n\nthe distance. Beyond one dimensional\n\nsmiles and laughter lies the hereafter.\n\nWhere tears echo laughter.\n\nYou’d have to do math to divide a\n\nsmile by a tear, times fear, equals\n\nmere truth, that simply dwells in the\n\nair. But if that’s the case all I have\n\nto do is breath and all else will follow.\n\nThat’s why drums are hollow.\n\nAnd I like drums. Drums are good.\n\nBut I can’t think straight. I lack the\n\nattention span to meditate. My attention\n\nspans galaxies. Here and now are immense.\n\nSeconds are secular. Moments are mine.\n\nSelf is illusion. Music’s divine.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nNoosed by the strings of Jimi’s guitar,\n\nI swing, purple-hazed pendulum. Hypnotizing\n\nthe part of eye that never dies. Look into my:\n\neyes are the windows of the soul is fried chicken,\n\ncollards, and cornbread is corn meal, sour cream,\n\neggs, and oil is the stolen blood of the earth, used\n\nto make cars run and kill the fish.\n\nWho me? I play scales. The scales of\n\ndead fish of oil slicked seas. My sister\n\nblows wind through the hollows of fallen\n\ntrees. And we are the echoes of eternity.\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of us.\n\nWe threw basement parties in pyramids.\n\nI left my tag on the wall. The beats would\n\necho off the stone and solidify into the\n\nform of light bulbs, destined to light up\n\nthe heads of future generations. They\n\nrecently lit up in the form of: BA BOOM\n\nBOOM OM. Maybe you’ve heard of us.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nIf not then you must be trying to hear us\n\nand in such cases we cannot be heard. We\n\nremain in the darkness, unseen. In the center\n\nof unpeeled bananas, we exist. Uncolored by\n\nperception. Clothed to the naked eye. Five\n\nsenses cannot sense the fact of our existence.\n\nAnd that’s the only fact. In fact, there are no\n\nfacts.\n\nFax me a fact and I’ll telegram a hologram\n\nor telephone the son of man and tell him he\n\nis done. Leave a message on his answering\n\nmachine telling him there are none. God and\n\nI are one. Times moon. Times star. Times sun.\n\nThe factor is me. You remember me.\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nI slung amethyst rocks on Saturn blocks\n\nuntil I got caught up by earthling cops. They\n\nwanted me for their army or whatever. Picture\n\nme: I swirl like the wind. Tempting tomorrow\n\nto be today. Tip toeing the fine line between\n\neverything and everything else. I am simply\n\nSaturn swirling sevens through sooth. The sole\n\nliving heir of air. And I (inhale) and (exhale) and\n\nall else follows. Reverberating the space inside of\n\ndrum hollows. Packaged in bottles and shipped to\n\ntomorrow, then sold to the highest NGH.\n\nI swing from the tallest tree. Lynched by\n\nthe lowest branches of me. Praying that\n\nmy physical will set me free ‘cause I’m\n\nafraid that all else is vanity. Mere language\n\nis profanity. I’d rather hum. Or have my\n\nsoul tattooed to my tongue. And let the\n\nscriptures be sung in gibberish. ‘Cause\n\nwords be simple fish in my soulquarium.\n\nAnd intellect can’t swim.\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nSo, I stopped combing my mind so my\n\nthoughts could lock. I’m tired of trying\n\nto understand. Perceptions are mangled,\n\nmatted, and knotted anyway. Life is more\n\nthan what meets the eye and I."
