        "text": "I sort of don‚Äôt want a partner who has an artistic side, especially when it comes to creative writing. I mean he might appreciate the once in a while trip to the museum and have a thing for paintings but that‚Äôs it. Why? Because I want him to feel my depth not over-analyse it and complain about the lack of transition or how there‚Äôs no preamble. I want him to be in awe of my amateur poetry and egg me on to whisper words and things drenched in love and passion in his ear. A girl can only wish, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with making your preference known. I mean he might stumble on this post someday or maybe he‚Äôs lurking right now, who knows. üôÑ\n\nI‚Äôm a Girlfriend‚Äôs super fan, the reality show that stars Tracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White and a few others. Loved the character Tracee Ellis Ross played ‚ÄòJoan Clayton‚Äô. Practical but super-neurotic Joan, having been told a million times how alike we were, I‚Äôm finally at peace with it besides I was crazy about her from the get go. I always rooted for her, aside from her getting into quite a number of relationships and getting heart broken. Eventually she ends up with a good man and I say ‚Äúgooood‚Äù in my Wendy Williams voice because a wholesome goood man trumps every other thing. Trumps the money, trumps the ‚Äòamazing sex‚Äô, the Harvard degree and the pretty face. Not saying I‚Äôd turn down a man who had all of that, just stating that a good man is key to a happy marriage. ‚ÄòHappy marriage‚Äô not one you endure/manage through. One that you‚Äôre genuinely happy as the years go by. Or maybe like me you just want to skip through all that stress and end up single mother style with your twins from a sperm donor. I‚Äôm kidding!!‚Ä¶ or not üôä\n\nSo yesterday a la insomnia I watched one of my favorite episodes ever (Take This Poem & Call Me In The Morning ‚Äì Season 3, Episode 12) again and I just knew I had to share this gem with you. In this episode, we see Sivad (Saul Williams), a spoken word poet, Lynn (Persia White) has a crush on deliver this amazing composition. I absolutely loved it, found myself going back countless times just to hear him, to eventually googling it and memorizing every word. I practically swallowed after every line, I mean this man had words assaulting practically every sense organ I owned. After every line, I had voices in my head chanting ‚ÄòME, ME, ME! Lol it‚Äôs just a really great piece.\n\nLast night I laid within your continent\n\nSought salvation from frustration\n\nWithin your loving nation\n\nFound the true meaning of homeland\n\nWhen you let me inland\n\nSwahili tongue knew I hadn‚Äôt been there before\n\nKissed for me to stay awhile\n\nI did you one better and stayed forever, in your country\n\nThen you let me tap your virgin drum\n\nReleasing echoes of me being free\n\nFree to run through your countryside\n\nTouching jasmine, dropping weed\n\nFree to nibble on your Nigeria\n\nBlow on your Botswana\n\nEat your Opia til there is no more Opia left\n\nWon‚Äôt be any leftovers when I‚Äôm done\n\nWon‚Äôt be anything when I‚Äôm done\n\nJust remembrance of that night when I laid within your continent\n\nSeeking salvation from frustration within your loving nation\n\nAnd that‚Äôs all we‚Äôll have\n\nThat, and a few thousand orphans to read this poem\n\nUnfortunately for some of you, this piece was not about sex, it has intonations of sex but he was getting word out about the HIV/AIDS epidemic hence the last line of this piece. Protect yourself people, I would say abstinence but would anyone pay me any mind? So if you have to mess around and have multiple partners, wrap it up. Don‚Äôt buy that ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve been with‚Äô from anyone. Protect yourself!\n\nLove Asia xx"
