        "text": "At least 27 people have been killed in Rafah since Monday. Here's what you should know\n\nAt least 27 people, including six women and nine children, were killed in Rafah since Monday evening, CNN confirmed through hospital sources in the southern Gaza city.\n\nIsrael’s military has seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, an Israeli military official said Tuesday. International pressure is growing against Israel following the seizure and after it refused to rule out a full-scale invasion in Rafah.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, rockets were fired from the Rafah area in the Gaza Strip toward Kerem Shalom and the Re’im area of southern Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nHere are other headlines you should know:\n\nRafah offensive and hospital crises:\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s military operation in Rafah serves the twin goals of returning the hostages held in Gaza and eliminating Hamas. Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, said the Israeli military’s operations in Rafah will “continue and expand as necessary.”\n\nThe last remaining operational hospital in Rafah has issued a call for all available medical teams to help with the constant influx of injured patients arriving at the medical facility.\n\nThe remaining field hospitals in the area of an eastern Rafah hospital that was evacuated Monday will only be able to provide less than one-third of its offered services, according to the hospital medical director.\n\nCeasefire negotiations:\n\nHamas’ latest written response in ongoing ceasefire negotiations said the group intends to offer Israel the corpses of dead hostages in addition to hostages who are still alive, during the first phase of the truce, according to sources familiar with the talks. A senior representative of Hamas says the proposed deal it agreed to includes the “withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip.”\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns returned to Cairo on Tuesday for more talks, a source familiar with the meetings told CNN, as the US and other mediators look to revive an effort to bring about a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.\n\nAid into Gaza:\n\nThe US finished the offshore construction of the temporary humanitarian pier system, also known as JLOTS, meant to get aid into Gaza, according to the Defense Department.\n\nUS National security spokesperson John Kirby stressed it is “absolutely critical” that Israel allow humanitarian aid into Gaza after Israel’s military seized control of crossings at Kerem Shalom and Rafah, blocking two vital points for aid into the Strip. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Israel “has committed to reopen” the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday.\n\nUS President Joe Biden delivers speech on antisemitism:\n\nBiden on Tuesday opened a speech on antisemitism at the US Capitol honoring the victims of the Holocaust and warning that the memories of that genocide might be sliding from the public’s perception.\n\nBiden drew connections between the Holocaust and the October 7 attack on Israel and pointed to a “ferocious surge” in antisemitism in the US since the October 7 attack, while offering a sweeping call for a return to the nation’s values.\n\nOngoing campus protests:\n\nStudents in the Spanish capital set up a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at the Complutense University of Madrid on Tuesday. Like many of their counterparts around the world, the several dozen students are asking the university to divest from Israel-linked businesses and entities, as well as requesting the Spanish government cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Israel, according to a CNN en Español team on the ground.\n\nRafah hospital director says closure will severely impact health care in the area\n\nThe remaining field hospitals in the area of an eastern Rafah hospital that was evacuated Monday will only be able to provide less than one-third of its offered services, according to the hospital medical director.\n\nThe evacuation to Kareem “happened against our will” after the Israel Defense Forces told people in eastern Rafah they must leave the area, according to Abu Yusuf Najjar Hospital medical director Marwan Al-Homss.\n\nAl Homss confirmed the hospital is now out of service including care for nearly 400 kidney dialysis patients. He said after it closed, vandalism started that led to the theft of fuel that was running the generators.\n\nHospital crews didn’t leave until all patients were evacuated, he said.\n\nAl-Homss said that over the past 48 hours, more than 56 people in the area had been killed, of whom 40% were children.\n\nCNN is unable to confirm his estimate.\n\nIDF says nearly 20 rockets fired from Rafah Tuesday\n\nRockets were fired from the Rafah area in the Gaza Strip Tuesday toward Kerem Shalom and the Re’im area of southern Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nSix projectiles were fired toward Kerem Shalom, the IDF said.\n\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing, one of the main conduits for humanitarian aid into Gaza, was closed Sunday after a rocket attack nearby killed four Israeli soldiers. It is due to reopen Wednesday, according to the US State Department.\n\nThe IDF said about 12 projectiles were also identified crossing from the area of Rafah in southern Gaza into the area of Re’im earlier today. The IDF Aerial Defense Array successfully intercepted five of the projectiles and the rest fell in an open area. No injuries were reported.\n\n“Within less than an hour, IAF aircraft struck the launcher that fired toward Israel.”\n\nAnalysis: Hamas has proposed a ceasefire deal. Here’s why it won’t bring an immediate end to the war\n\nWhen Hamas declared on Monday evening that it has “agreed” to a ceasefire deal, it caught many off guard. Israel was evidently not expecting it, and it was not even immediately clear what Hamas had agreed to.\n\nHamas’ announcement was initially met with jubilation in Gaza and cautious optimism by regional leaders after it was presented as an acceptance of an Israeli proposal. But Israel issued what looked like a holding position, saying that Hamas’ position was “far from” meeting its demands.\n\nAnd it pressed on with a controversial military operation in Rafah, southern Gaza, conducting air strikes on Monday and seizing control of the Palestinian side of a border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday morning amid intense pressure from his hardline coalition to go all-in.\n\nAt the same time, Israel said that it would send a delegation to Cairo to assess Hamas’ position. The CIA director, Bill Burns, also arrived in Cairo on Tuesday morning.\n\nSo what’s going on? Find out here:\n\nUS has completed humanitarian pier construction off Gaza shore\n\nThe US has finished the offshore construction of the temporary humanitarian pier system, also known as JLOTS, meant to get aid into Gaza, according to the Defense Department.\n\n“As of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS, the floating pier and the Trident pier, are complete and awaiting final movement offshore,” announced Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh at a briefing.\n\nHowever, due to weather, the US military is unable to move the pier into position to be anchored ashore in Gaza, according to Singh.\n\nBut Singh added that the US is loading aid meant to be unloaded at the temporary pier on the ship MV Sagamore, which is currently in Cyprus.\n\n“The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system, and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world,” said Singh.\n\nCNN first reported last week that the Sagamore will be the first vessel used to transport the aid from Cyprus to the pier, but US officials hope that aid groups will eventually begin contracting their own vessels to deliver the aid.\n\nSingh also said that while the pier’s movement would depend on weather and security conditions, the Defense Department hopes to have it in position “later this week.”\n\nHamas official says proposed deal includes Israeli withdrawal from Gaza\n\nA senior representative of Hamas says the proposed deal it agreed to includes the “withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip.”\n\nOsama Hamdan, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told a news conference in Beirut that the proposed deal would secure “the main issues of the demands of our people and our resistance in stopping the aggression permanently, the withdrawal of the occupation from the entire Gaza Strip, the free return of the displaced, relief, reconstruction, ending the siege, and achieving a real and serious exchange deal.”\n\nHamdan said the proposed deal’s three phases would be continuously implemented, claiming that Israel wanted “to complete one stage, in which it would achieve the release of its prisoners held by the resistance, and then resume its aggression against the Gaza Strip.”\n\nReferring to Egypt and Qatar, Hamdan said that “the mediator brothers, if their proposal is approved…will have a role in completing all stages of the agreement, and putting pressure on the occupation to adhere to its provisions and implement them.”\n\nNetanyahu said that “as the war cabinet unanimously determined, the Hamas proposal was very far from Israel’s core demands.”\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that a close reading of Israel and Hamas’ separate negotiating positions on a hostage deal indicates the two sides should be able to strike an agreement.\n\nNational security spokesman John Kirby’s comment was a fresh sign of optimism about the state of hostage talks after they appeared to stall Monday. CIA Director Bill Burns was in Cairo Tuesday for continued discussions.\n\nNetanyahu says Rafah operation aims to return hostages and eliminate Hamas\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel’s military operation in Rafah serves the twin goals of returning the hostages held in Gaza and eliminating Hamas.\n\n“The entrance to Rafah serves two main war goals: the return of our hostages and the elimination of Hamas.”\n\nNetanyahu said that, as previously demonstrated, “military pressure on Hamas is a necessary condition for the return of our hostages. The Hamas proposal yesterday was intended to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah. It did not happen.”\n\nHamas accepted a ceasefire proposal Monday evening, but Israel said the deal remained “far from” meeting its demands. Netanyahu confirmed he’d sent Israel’s negotiating team to Cairo, Egypt’s capital, to continue to “stand firm” on the conditions Israel is seeking.\n\nRafah's last operational hospital calls for medical backup as injured patients stream in\n\nThe last remaining operational hospital in Rafah has issued a call for all available medical teams to help with the constant influx of injured patients arriving at the medical facility.\n\nIn a statement released on its official WhatsApp account, Dr. Suhaib Al-Hams, Director of Kuwait Specialized Hospital, said on Tuesday it was “receiving dozens of martyrs,” using a term to refer to people who had been killed, “and injuries around the clock.”\n\nAl-Hams also said their X-ray machine was out of service “due to the pressure of the number of cases.”\n\n“The Kuwait Specialized Hospital in Rafah is the only hospital operating now with minimal capabilities after Al-Najjar Hospital went out of service due to it being classified within the red zone,” the statement adds.\n\nIDF International Spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a statement Tuesday that the Israeli military were undertaking “a precise counterterrorism operation” to “eliminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas in eastern Rafah.”\n\nInternational pressure mounts on Israel to hold off a full-scale invasion of Rafah\n\nInternational pressure is growing against Israel, as the country’s forces seized the Palestinian side of a crossing in Rafah and refused to rule out a full-scale invasion of the south Gaza city.\n\nThe Biden administration’s longtime support for Israel has come under scrutiny as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows, with senior US officials increasingly expressing concern about a potential full-scale military operation in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns is returning to Cairo on Tuesday for more talks, a source familiar with the meetings told CNN, as the US and other mediators look to bring about a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.\n\nThe World Health Organization’s regional director, Hanan Balkhy, warned of the consequences of the Israeli military operation, writing on X that it put the lives of 1.5 million people “in grave danger.” She added that humanitarian groups were “committed to staying and delivering” aid and called for the Rafah border crossing to be “urgently reopened.”\n\nEarlier, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said the crossing closure could bring humanitarian efforts across the Gaza Strip to a standstill. Egypt’s foreign ministry condemned Israel for taking control of the Palestinian side of the key crossing, calling the move a “dangerous escalation.”\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres has called on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to end the bloodshed, while the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell reiterated calls on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Rafah.\n\nRafah residents were informed via airdropped leaflets over the past 48 hours to head for Israeli-designated “expanded humanitarian areas.” Aid groups have previously said that one of them — Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near Khan Younis — is not appropriate for habitation.\n\nBiden calls for Holocaust remembrance as he condemns spread of antisemitism\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday repeatedly drew parallels between the Holocaust and the October 7 attack on Israel in a somber yet impassioned speech at the US Capitol.\n\nBiden condemned antisemitism, both in the US and around the world, saying the “ancient hatred of Jews” didn’t begin – or end – with Nazi Germany’s horrific campaign eight decades ago.\n\n“This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.\n\nHe pointed to what he described as a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US after the October 7 attacks, condemning hate speech and threats against Jews in recent months.\n\n“We have to remember, our basic principles as a nation: we have an obligation – to learn the lessons of history, so we don’t surrender our future to the horrors of the past,” he said, reaffirming the right of free speech as he roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech, and threats of violence “against Jews or anyone else.”\n\nThe president called for Americans to forcefully address and stand against antisemitism and all forms of hate.\n\n“’Never again,’ simply translated for me means, never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth, we must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is, we’re at risk of people not knowing the truth,” Biden said.\n\nDownplaying of October 7 attack \"must stop,\" Biden says\n\nPresident Joe Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” in antisemitism in the United States since the October 7 attack on Israel while offering a sweeping call for a return to the nation’s values.\n\n“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 - including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable - and it must stop,” the president said while raising his voice.\n\nHe added: “We have to remember our basic principles as a nation: we have an obligation to learn the lessons of history, so we don’t surrender our future to the horror of the past.”\n\nBiden says there's no place for antisemitism in America\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the protests that have been roiling college campuses in recent weeks in response to Israel’s war in Gaza while speaking on antisemitism on Tuesday.\n\n“I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world,” Biden said, adding that he respects the fundamental right to free speech and debate.\n\n“That’s America,” he said. “But there’s no place on any campus in America … for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.”\n\nBiden added: “It’s not peaceful protest. It’s against the law. And we are not a lawless country.”\n\nThe president added: “We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone.”\n\nBiden connects Holocaust to October 7 attack in address on antisemitism\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday drew connections between the Holocaust and the October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nWhile delivering a speech on antisemitism at the US Capitol on Tuesday, the president said he fears “people are forgetting” – despite the phrase “never forget” becoming one of the lasting legacies of the the Holocaust.\n\n“They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,” he said.\n\nBiden added: “I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”\n\n\"No safe zones in Gaza\": EU’s top diplomat adds voice to criticism against Netanyahu\n\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, added his voice to mounting criticism against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday for ignoring international demands against an attack on Rafah, which has become a new focal point in the seven-month war.\n\nDespite Hamas agreeing to a draft ceasefire deal, Netanyahu has vowed to go ahead with an attack on the city. Israeli forces have taken control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, a vital entry point for aid to Gaza on the Egyptian border.\n\nThe move is short of Netanyahu’s threatened full-scale operation on Rafah, but Borrell described it as a land offensive.\n\n“The land offensive against Rafah has started again, in spite of all of the requests of the international community — the US, the European Union member states — everybody asking Netanyahu not to attack Rafah,” the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said in a briefing Tuesday.\n\n“In spite of these warnings and these requests, the attack started yesterday night. I am afraid that this is going to cause again a lot of casualties, civilian casualties, whatever they say. There are 600,000 children in Gaza. They will be pushed to so-called ‘safety zones’ — there are no safe zones in Gaza.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) operations in Gaza, Suze van Meegen, made similar remarks, telling CNN: “Not only is there nowhere safe to go, for many people there’s also no way to get there.”\n\nBorrell also described the lack of agreement on a ceasefire as “sad news,” adding: “Hamas accepted, Israel rejected.”\n\nIsrael has captured the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing. Here's what that could mean\n\nIsrael’s military on Tuesday said it had seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, a vital entry point for aid to Gaza on the Egyptian border.\n\nA Palestinian official said all movement had stopped at the facility in southern Gaza after it was captured by Israeli tanks.\n\nHere’s what to know about the crossing:\n\nWhat is the Rafah crossing? The facility is the only Gaza border crossing not controlled by Israel, which shut its crossings with the Palestinian territory following Hamas’ October 7 attack. Since the war began, the Rafah crossing has emerged as a crucial location allowing in limited humanitarian aid, and the evacuation of a small number of Palestinians and foreign nationals.\n\nWhat’s happening there now? Israel’s military has seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, an Israeli military official said Tuesday. The official said military operations at the crossing are ongoing, but refused to say how long Israeli troops would control the facility. It comes after days of deadly Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, and an Israeli evacuation order for Palestinians in parts of the city.\n\nWhat does it mean for aid? The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said this capture could halt humanitarian relief efforts across Gaza, if supply routes for aid and fuel supplies are interrupted. CNN has reached out to Israel’s military and officials for comment on any plans to facilitate aid deliveries to Gaza.\n\nHow about Israel’s wider plans? A source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN the Israeli operation into Rafah would be “very limited,” intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree to a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The source said the operation is not the larger incursion into Rafah that Israel has been publicly messaging for weeks.\n\nWhere does this leave Palestinian refugees? Hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Rafah are now at a loss for where to go next, with thousands fleeing Israel’s incessant airstrikes. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah during seven months of war, with many of their homes already destroyed or inaccessible in the northern part of the strip.\n\nIsraeli military operation at Rafah crossing will disrupt aid to Gaza, UN agency warns\n\nHumanitarian relief efforts in Gaza may be brought to a standstill by Israeli troops’ seizure of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, a UN agency warned on Tuesday.\n\nThe “catastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted,” UNRWA added.\n\nIsrael’s military said it has taken control of the Palestinian side of the crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which is a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave. A Palestinian official said all movement had stopped at the facility after it was captured by Israeli tanks.\n\nCNN has reached out to Israel’s military and officials for comment on any plans to facilitate aid deliveries to Gaza.\n\nLimited Israeli operation in Rafah aims to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal, source says\n\nA limited Israeli operation into Rafah is intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree to a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release, a source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN.\n\nIsrael informed the US of the plans to evacuate the area in eastern Rafah and conduct the operation before the call Monday between President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the source said.\n\nThe source described the operation as “very limited” and said it is not the larger incursion into Rafah that Israel has been publicly messaging for weeks.\n\nSome context: Israeli airstrikes killed multiple people in Rafah early Tuesday, Palestinian officials said, after Israel reiterated its commitment to an offensive in southern Gaza, saying ceasefire terms responded to by Hamas were “far from” meeting its demands. Israel will send a delegation for further talks, which Qatar said would resume Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli military says it has captured Palestinian side of Rafah crossing\n\nIsrael’s military has seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, an Israeli military official said Tuesday.\n\nThe facility is the sole crossing between Gaza and Egypt and a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nMilitary operations at the crossing are ongoing, the official added.\n\nThe official refused to say how long Israeli troops would control the crossing,\n\nVideo from the Israel Defense Forces showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the crossing.\n\nEarlier, a Palestinian official told CNN all movement on the crossing had stopped after Israeli tanks captured the facility on the Palestinian side.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information."
