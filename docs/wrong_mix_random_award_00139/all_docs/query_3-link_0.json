        "text": "The great and good and controversial Saul Bellow, pre-eminent among American novelists of the second half of the 20th century and winner of the 1976 Nobel prize for literature, has died aged 89.\n\nTo identify him only with the last half of the century is unfair. He announced his presence as early as 1944 with Dangling Man and, as the century closed and the new millennium began, he was writing novellas. He said he had come to believe with Chekhov that he could not read a novel without wishing it were shorter. The Actual, a love story tightly written but full of vintage Bellow touches, was published in 1997. That year, at the age of 82, he also turned his hand to a literary review, The Republic Of Letters. With Ravelstein, in 2000, he returned to longer fiction. Inspired by the life of his close friend Allan Bloom, the author of The Closing Of The American Mind, the book dealt with a celebrated professor dying of Aids.\n\nBellow had been part of the Greenwich Village literary scene in the late 1930s and 40s. In the early 1950s he published stories in the New Yorker and Harper's Bazaar, and in Partisan Review and other avant-garde magazines. In 1953 he produced The Adventures Of Augie March with its marvellous opening: \"I am an American, Chicago-born - Chicago, that sombre city - and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style\", and was recognised as a new major American novelist.\n\nIn 1956 he published Seize The Day, an intense novella about the ruin of a New York Jewish salesman. This was overshadowed by Arthur Miller's play Death Of A Salesman, but the Nobel committee gave Seize The Day special praise when awarding the prize to Bellow and it was made into a film with Robin Williams in 1986. In 1959, Bellow became an international bestseller with Henderson The Rain King, a marvellously comic fable about an eccentric American millionaire who finds his soul among tribesmen in Africa.\n\nIn 1964 came Herzog, a novel that was immediately accepted as a masterpiece, \"a well-nigh faultless novel,\" Brendan Gill of the New Yorker called it. The story of Moses Herzog seemed on the surface to be yet another tale of mid-life crisis. But this time the story was in the hands of a magician. Herzog was the intellectual-as-comic figure, a familiar hero in European fiction, but new to America: almost, one would think, un-American. Herzog leads a very American life - making frenzied journeys, spending the night in the arms of a glamorous florist, flying to another city, getting in a car crash, being arrested for possession of a gun. He is a double-murderer manqué and also a victim, bullied and betrayed at every corner.\n\nAmerican fiction, particularly American Jewish fiction, has many examples of this, but Bellow's unanchored imagination filled the scenes with wonderful minor characters, and when the mad Herzog starts writing letters, never to be sent, to his friends and family, to newspapers and finally to the dead, the American novel entered a new world. George Steiner praised the book for being \"one of the least simple of modern inventions\". It is also very funny.\n\nIn 1975 Bellow produced another masterpiece, Humboldt's Gift. As with Herzog, a glance at the plot and characters suggests yet another colourful romp: Charlie Citrine, a Chicago writer and academic, is enmeshed in a series of lawsuits from his ex-wife; his career has ground to a halt; he is involved with Renata, an expensive and unsuitable woman; he has fallen foul of a mafioso called Rinaldo Cantabile. Then news reaches him that Von Humboldt Fleisher, a friend of happier days, has died in poverty in New York, leaving him a legacy.\n\nThis is the stuff of a comic novel, but the Bellow trick was to make it also deeply serious. \"The name of Dostoevsky immediately gives us our bearings,\" Philip Toynbee wrote in the Observer. \"His best yet and there is nobody writing novels in English who can match it,\" he added. In the middle of that farcical plot there was a spiritual revolution, a cosmic consciousness, gigantic themes.\n\nOne critic said Bellow had always been politically incorrect about the soul. He meant that Bellow had one. Martin Amis, who saw Bellow as a mentor and father-figure, said Bellow's first name was a typing error, that it should be spelled with an \"o\" instead of an \"a\". The American novelist and critic Herbert Gold said Bellow was \"a regular American guy resisting godliness\".\n\nThat throwaway line captured the essence of Bellow's work. He was essentially a satirist, very comic and often extremely vulgar, but his characters were in search of God. Because of this he was often called the American Dostoevsky, and his most successful novels are filled with a search for the soul that somehow seems out of step with contemporary western literature.\n\nIn this story of an academic's spiritual quest, esoteric philosophers were named the way other novelists make references to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and there was much French, Latin and Hebrew. Herzog seemed completely at odds with the Swinging Sixties, but it tapped a need for an inner meaning, and much to Bellow's surprise it was a bestseller.\n\nHe said that until he was 40 he never earned more than $3,000 or $4,000 a year. The life of a poor Jewish scholar would have suited him, he said, but he became rich. He was handsome, dressed snazzily and became a ladies' man, although he denied the title - he said he wasn't frivolous enough, that he kept marrying them. He was married five times, as much as a Hollywood star, Ernest Hemingway or Norman Mailer, and his personal life was reflected in the lives of his heroes. After Herzog, they became rich men of tortured sensibilities hemmed in by the vulgarity, lust and greed of those about them.\n\nBellow made much comic use of this vulgarity, sugar-coating the philosophical pill with hilarious satire on modern American life, but he said that it seemed to him that he was too successful - no one was offended by his satire.\n\nHe won the Pulitzer prize (for Humboldt's Gift), he was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was awarded the Croix de Chevalier and given the Légion d'Honneur in France, and in Italy he won the Malaparte prize for literature. Bellow was suffering the usual fate of 20th-century western satirists: unlike in the Soviet bloc, writers could not provoke outrage.\n\nBut there was a backlash. This came in 1976, after he won the Nobel and gained a wider non-literary readership in the US. He was accused of racism (\"niggerlove\" is an unfortunate word that crept into Herzog) and of antisemitism (\"kikes\" appears in Humboldt's Gift) and of being anti-women (there are no end of bitches in his oeuvre).\n\nWhen he attempted to defend himself, he did not do it very well. Where, he asked, was the Zulu Tolstoy? Where the Marcel Proust of Papua New Guinea? He said he was being attacked by \"Stalinist thought police\", by people \"who had never heard of Papua New Guinea\". There was a famous confrontation with undergraduates at Harvard, articles attacking his racism appeared in the New York Times, and when he took up a lectureship at Boston University, a delegation went to the Boston Globe and asked if they knew that Boston was harbouring a racist.\n\nIn The Dean's December (1982), Bellow attempted to counter these attacks. The hero of the novel is a journalist who returns to Chicago from Paris and writes a series of articles attacking his native city. One was supposed to see the hero caught in the liberal dilemma, but the novel only added to the charge of racism. Rather comically, his enemies then issued the ultimate American insult and called him a foreigner. \"Where is the Canadian Tolstoy?\" they asked.\n\nBellow was born in Lachine, outside Montreal. The family name was Belov, and he was called Solomon. They were moderately well-off Jews from St Petersburg, who had come to Canada in 1913. They changed their name to Bellow and he took the name Saul as a child. The father had difficulty earning a living and took many jobs; once he was even a bootlegger. Bellow made much use of his background in the novels.\n\nWhen he was eight, the family moved to Chicago. Bellow studied Hebrew, which he continued to read and study throughout his life, but he became, he said, completely Americanised by the street life of Chicago. He entered Chicago University, originally planning to study literature, but switching to anthropology. He also attended Northwestern and Wisconsin. During the second world war, he served in the merchant marines, but his only war writing was Dangling Man, an unusual war novel about a man waiting to be called to the army and feeling himself free for the first time as outside forces take control of his life.\n\nBellow had been much influenced by European thought while living among artists and leftwing journalists in Greenwich Village. After the war, he went to live in Paris, and this influence continued with his second novel, The Victim (1947), until he said he had a road-to-Damascus vision of Sartre as a confidence trickster. \"I was sitting in a cafe in Paris reading Les Temps Modernes and I said to myself Chicago-style, 'This has got to be a con.' And a con in Chicago was a shade more venial than a lie.\" He returned to America.\n\nAfter he won the Nobel prize, Bellow seemed to think that he must make pronouncements like a wise old man. He was very good at this, but it made him enemies. He said, for example, that people blaming their parents for their lives was \"a nasty little vice\", and this ran against the psychological fad that made it fashionable for people to claim they had an abused childhood. In More Die Of Heartbreak (1987), Bellow has a doctor say, \"I know 90-year-olds who are still furious about their potty training.\" Childhood abuse was used, Bellow said, \"as an excuse to not take responsibility for your own life.\"\n\nHe was also accused of misogyny. He said: \"Political correctness has become the tyranny of the age, that you have to hold the right views ... I took it very seriously at first and I bled over every bad review.\"\n\nHe had taken up contempt and rage, his critics said, like other old men take up golf. Bellow hit back, \"There has been a decline of desire. People doubt their own human weight. The enormous increases in population seem to have dwarfed the individual. Human character is smaller now, people don't have durable passions, they've replaced passions with excitement.\"\n\nOf modern technology, he said: \"We are temporarily miracle-sodden and feeling faint.\" And: \"Life and death questions are not what we discuss. What we hear and read is crisis chatter.\"\n\nHe attacked his contemporaries, saying, \"A great many writers have done little more than meet the mounting demand for thrills.\" And of education he said: \"In colleges and universities no passion for novels and poems is instilled. What people learn is how to conduct a cultured conversation for a few minutes without betraying ignorance or stupidity.\"\n\nIn his 80s, he said that he had always thought there would be a golden age, but \"in the writer's life there is no golfing period ... it is always the hard-backed chair and the next book.\"\n\nBellow returned to his comic roots with More Die Of Heartbreak, a novel that moved along with the pace of French farce, concerning the tragicomic dilemma of two brilliantly intellectual men whose brains cannot save them from the low comedy of sex. Critics who thought that the role of the sage had not suited Bellow welcomed this return to humour. They had not liked To Jerusalem And Back (1976), his only book of non-fiction, about the Arab-Israel conflict. He published A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection in 1989, and Something To Remember Me By: Three Tales in 1991.\n\nBellow seemed to have silenced his critics and at the end of his life was happily married to his fifth wife, Janis Freedman, whom he wed in 1989, and with whom at the age of 84 he had a daughter. He lived part of the year in Chicago, where helectured at Chicago University, and the other part of the year at his 120-acre country home in Vermont, from which he would emerge from time to time to lecture at Boston University. His Collected Stories was published in 2001.\n\nHis wife, their daughter, and three sons by former marriages survive him."
