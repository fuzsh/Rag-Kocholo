        "text": "From the moment Brandeis University opened its doors in 1948, it was a university on the move.\n\nA bold experiment set in motion by the American Jewish community, created to redress the antisemitism and bigotry then prevalent at prestigious American universities, Brandeis drew vitality and direction from its foundational values: a reverence for learning, a passion for critical thinking and questioning, and a desire to help repair the world.\n\nIn just 75 years, Brandeis has become a beacon of aspiration and accomplishment in the higher-education landscape. Ever enterprising and forward-looking, it is forging a path to an even brighter future."
