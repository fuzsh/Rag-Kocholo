        "text": "Waterfall\n\nAn Elegy for Verdery Knights\n\nThe human body\n\nis an ocean. The mysteries\n\nheld in waves are frightening.\n\nI’ve grown to trust these depths,\n\nbut I wasn’t always this brave.\n\nIn high school, I was a quiet creek\n\ntrying to find my voice.\n\nWe were all Soul Poets In Training,\n\nwould SPIT after school.\n\nPoems and J Dilla instrumentals.\n\nMs. Ford blessed the space, and soon,\n\nthe rivers uncovered themselves.\n\nThis is where we met, Verdery.\n\nYou came in speaking waterfall.\n\nRaging current,\n\nflow of white-water rapids,\n\nOshun breath\n\nLyricism leaped from your mouth,\n\nsplashing us all in melody and rhythm.\n\nBut you weren’t the type to get hyped\n\nin the awe of your own waters.\n\nLess tsunami and more water bearer of language.\n\nVerj, I was so unpolished\n\nback then. Felt foolish\n\nfor thinking that I could swim,\n\nThat I even belonged\n\nin the water. I treasured your words\n\nlike glistening seashells, precious gifts of ocean.\n\nAfter graduation,\n\nour lives sailed into new journeys.\n\nWe drifted, but I knew\n\nwaves always find their way back home.\n\nI was in Boston\n\nwhen I learned of your passing.\n\nI imagined the vapors of a hot spring\n\nfading into a cold Brooklyn evening.\n\nNone of us could fathom that water evaporates.\n\nI learned doctors discharged you too early,\n\nleft you an unattended IV dripping empty\n\nWords became\n\na suffocating burden,\n\nAntartica on my neck.\n\nWhy am I still standing\n\nand you are just mist?\n\nBut then I saw you.\n\nVisiting me as the morning dew\n\non hundreds of daffodils in the\n\nBrooklyn Botanical Garden.\n\nYou are a boundless brilliance.\n\nI see you Verdery\n\nwater cycle stanzas now huh?\n\nI watched those daffodils\n\nstretch their stems up to greet you,\n\npetals open like hands in worship.\n\nAnother reminder to\n\nstand tall, be proud of all my stories,\n\nbe bold with all the colors I hold.\n\nThank you for being one of the first people\n\nto believe in me. We weren’t best friends,\n\nbut we gave each other so much\n\nkindness and laughter.\n\nI turned your gems of wisdom\n\ninto my crowning achievements.\n\nWish you could see this.\n\nThese waters are my greatest joy.\n\nOpen canvas, I dive in. No hesitation.\n\nThat open mic night on Myrtle Ave—\n\nmy first of decades—feels like just yesterday.\n\nVerdery,\n\nyou were the last poem of the night.\n\nIn the end you died a haiku,\n\n17 syllables old.\n\nGone. Tide out of reach\n\nMemory left in seashells.\n\nI still hear you speak.\n\nBecause I know the difference between\n\ndeath and gone is location.\n\nThe horizon is just another shoreline.\n\nI’m sure of this."
