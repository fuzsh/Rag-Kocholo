During that period, he played with his doctor, Georg Magnus until he died.

Then he offers his insufferable gambits to the public as music, and is outraged because I criticize it as music and not as chess.\" In his book, Back to Methuselah, he mentioned that the newspapers were occupied by the exploits of Sammy Reshevsky at age 8 defeating 20 adult players simultaneously.

Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) also told Heisenberg to give up chess and save whatever intellectual effort he could muster for physics. Heisenberg continued to play chess, however. During World War II, Heisenberg was convinced Germany would lose the war. He once said, \"Hitler has a chess endgame with one rook less than the others, so he will lose — it will take a year.\" According to his wife, Heisenberg saw politics as a \"game of chess, in which the feelings and passions of people are subordinated to the charted course of political events, just as the chess figures to the rules of the game.\"\n\nIn 1933, Paul Dirac (1902-1984) shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum mechanics.

He beat most students in the college chess club, sometimes several at the same time. He served for many years as president of the chess club of St. John's College, Cambridge. With his stepson, he would go over chess problems that they found in newspapers. He played chess with friends such as Peter Kapitza (1894-1984), a Russian physicist, who taught Dirac how to play tennis. When he lectured, he sometime linked subatomic particles to chess. In 1929, Dirac discussed chess problems with Heisenberg on their tour to Japan. After his return to Leipzig, Heisenberg wrote to Dirac: \"You are wrong...in the question of mating a King and a Knight with a King and Rook; this is not possible according to the edition of 1926 of Dufresne's handbook of chess (the best book about theory of chess).\" (source: Dirac: A Scientific Biography, by Helge Kragh, 1990, p. 259)\n\nIn 1933, Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961) shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum mechanics.
