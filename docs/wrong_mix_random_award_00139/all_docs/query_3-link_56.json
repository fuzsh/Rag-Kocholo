        "meta_description": "This episode features part two of host Lola Wright’s conversation with Saul Williams.  Saul Williams has traveled the world as an artist, activist, and provocateur of deeper and more comprehensive thought patterns. Much of Saul’s music is based on political activism and protest, but in this conversation he describes a project that stretched beyond his usual areas of focus. He says, “I decided to work on this album called Volcanic Sunlight where I just wanted to acknowledge that there were a lot of other emotions flowing through me beyond this dissection of race and class... and I just wanted to express the love that I feel, because in fact everything that I’ve ever said has come out of love.”    They also discuss an increase of Christianity in hip hop. Saul says, “It’s great to have your faith and… what moves you, that’s wonderful. But when I think of that projected, when our military is in predominantly Islamic countries firing weapons and operating on Christian principles out loud, you know? Conflating terrorism and Islam, and rappers are like ‘my God is the greatest God’... from America, I’m like, ‘okay, are you making specifically music for the soldiers to sing along to so they can feel comfortable as they shoot these black and brown kids around the world?’”  They also discuss some of the repercussions of conservative Christianity’s exportation to other countries, including efforts to promote an anti-gay law in Uganda. The Netflix series The Family also documents and explores this gross practice in America’s recent past.  Lola and Saul discuss the upcoming presidential election, and how the 2016 election inspired Lola to begin the project Normal white people. “Using real and untold American history, current events and self-reflection, participants are committed to uncovering personal biases, discovering the changes necessary within the participant, and creating a personal path of inspired action that moves the evolutionary impulse of humanity toward a loving and just global society.”   Saul makes an impassioned argument for Americans to learn the true, untold history of the country and its founding.

Please excuse any errors or omissions.\n\nLola Wright: You are more than this meat suit! A feeling lasts 90 seconds. A multiracial, intergenerational, queer, affirming, non religious, pro woman community in the most segregated city in America, Chicago.\n\nLola Wright: Hello. Welcome to, And this is Bodhi. I’m your host Lola Wright. If you have not already listened to our inaugural episode of this podcast, please do that. We kicked this podcast off with the brilliant mystic, poet, musician, activist Saul Williams. This is part two of that conversation. If you don’t already know what Bodhi is, check us out. Bodhi Center is based in Chicago. We serve Chicagoans and people around the world in shifting out of fear based thought patterns into higher states of creativity, aliveness, freedom, and joy so that you and I can move on the planet with a greater sense of peace and contribution.\n\nLola Wright: As always, expect expletives, expect strong language. When you’re in the midst of Saul Williams, don’t let it take you out if that’s something that rubs you the wrong way. Listen for the meat. There is a lot of good, juicy stuff in this conversation. We explore his movement out of Christianity, the significant impact of hip hop on his spiritual awakening. I loved every moment of being with this human. I trust you will too.\n\nLola Wright: So in one of your, I think it was your original piece that I don’t think it debuted in slam, but you have a line in there that says –\n\nSaul Williams: Interplanetary truth is androgynous? Which one?\n\nLola Wright: No, but that’s a great line.\n\nSaul Williams: Oh, yeah that’s not in slam.\n\nLola Wright: No, it was actually something about like I look to God, but then I understood that like I could talk to God because I could talk to me or something like that.\n\nSaul Williams: Oh! Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. I know God personally. In fact he lets me call him me.\n\nLola Wright: Yes. And so how did that awareness develop? And I’m imagining that you have encountered people perhaps from more traditional backgrounds that would say that’s heretical.\n\nSaul Williams: Of course. Well, I mean I grew up in New York in the eighties and nineties so I didn’t just grow up in the church. I grew up around Five Percenters so, you know, like I grew up around a lot of people who’d be like, yo, what’s up God?\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: So there was always this operating principle and explanation. I grew up around a lot of Rastas as well, you know, so I had a lot of operating systems running at the same time, or I was basically exposed to these varying relationships to the presence of, of God. And then there was that moment like I mentioned from, you know, my freshman year of college, where I felt the freedom to explore and read and meditate and all this stuff. So how did I arrive at that statement? When I first started writing poetry and Amethyst Rocks is that poem and it’s one of the earliest poems that I wrote.\n\nSaul Williams: All of those poems came out of meditation. All of those poems came out of the beginning of my sitting practice for meditation, which had to do a lot with breathing and, and, and, and visualizing and, and, but I don’t want to make it really esoteric. Where did that come from? Um, it’s just an understanding. It’s an understanding that’s available. That was really clear. As soon as I stepped out of the ideological sort of structuring that I was raised in, it’s just something that became clear that this principal was inside of all of us.\n\nLola Wright: It’s interesting because A Tribe Called Quest dropped Midnight Marauders in 1993, I was 13, and I always said that that was like one of my first spiritual awakenings. Like there was something that my soul felt –\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah.\n\nLola Wright: – in that album and in that era, and I’m like, I so do not want to be one of those people’s like in that era of hip hop, you know?\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah –\n\nLola Wright: But –\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah.\n\nLola Wright: – in that era of hip hop, there was a devotion to liberation frameworks –\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: – that I don’t hear in the same way today. And specifically I’ll just say, given the fact that we’re sitting in Chicago, what’s fascinating to me about Chicago, given that it is the home of the Nation of Islam, that most of the artists that come out of here are very Christianized.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah it’s problematic.\n\nLola Wright: Yeah.\n\nSaul Williams: Very, very, very problematic. But um –\n\nLola Wright: Can you say why you say it with that –\n\nSaul Williams: Sure.\n\nLola Wright: – clarity?\n\nSaul Williams: Let me just go back to one thing you said because I want to point out that like, cause you point out my lyric, which is like a, I know God personally. In fact he lets me call him me, I be one with rain and stars and things with dancing feet and watermelon rings. Yes. But I grew up on Rakim who maybe in 89 or 1990 was like, I’m God, G is the seventh letter made.\n\nLola Wright: Yes.\n\nSaul Williams: That’s Follow the Leaders, that song. Uh, KRS-One. There’s tons of rappers that I heard reference themselves as God –\n\nLola Wright: Yeah.\n\nSaul Williams: – way before I put it in a poem.\n\nLola Wright: Yes, of course.\n\nSaul Williams: You know what I’m saying? Yeah. And so, and it wasn’t just that I heard it in songs like I was there for like a lot of the light born ciphers and what have you amongst the Five Percenters and all this stuff. All this stuff is super interesting to me and most of these peeps were my peeps growing up. And so there were a lot of, uh, you know, a lot of Dr. York, there was a lot of crazy stuff in the streets in New York talking about spirituality and our relationship to our ancestors, –\n\nLola Wright: Yes.\n\nSaul Williams: – our relationship to God. And I was pulling from all of that stuff and, and being fed by a lot of it, you know, and also trying to like discern between like the, the reactionary politic –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: – and the stuff that felt truly connected to a guiding principle.\n\nLola Wright: I think that is a massive distinction right there because I think that your entire career, from what I can tell, has been oriented on principle as opposed to reaction or trend. Right?\n\nSaul Williams: No. Yeah.\n\nLola Wright: And if I look at –\n\nSaul Williams: I challenged myself occasionally and look back and go, shit, was I just reacting?\n\nLola Wright: Well, yeah. I mean I get that, but we all sort of were on this evolutionary trajectory and, –\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm, yeah.\n\nLola Wright: – but it’s like any time over the last 25 years, you could have said, okay, this is exhausting carrying this mantle.\n\nSaul Williams: But I have, it’s not that it was exhausting carrying the mantle. At times, I’ve been like, I have to write from a different place.\n\nLola Wright: Right.\n\nSaul Williams: So I have an album called Volcanic Sunlight –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: – which I recorded after I did Niggy Tardust. And after Niggy Tardust looking back at my, I mean, the first word on my first album is n***a.\n\nLola Wright: Mm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: Um, you know what im saying like [laughter], and then, you know, leading up to Niggy Tardust I was like, okay, whew. And so I decided to work on this album called Volcanic Sunlight where I just wanted to acknowledge that there are a lot of other emotions flowing through me –\n\nLola Wright: Yes.\n\nSaul Williams: – beyond this dissection of race and class and you know, all this stuff. And I just wanted to express the love that I feel because in fact everything I’ve ever said is come out of love.\n\nLola Wright: Well, I totally feel that.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, I know that it’s, it is felt, but I wanted to take the time to acknowledge that.\n\nLola Wright: Be excplicit.\n\nLola Wright: And so volcanic sunlight is very much about that.\n\nMusic: [Volcanic Sunlight plays]\n\nSaul Williams: And it’s the last album I did before I delved into the MartyrLoserKing project which puts me, you know, back on my bullshit.\n\nLola Wright: [laughter].\n\nSaul Williams: [laughter] And uh, and so after that. Uh, let me go to your other question. Right? Which was what?\n\nLola Wright: The Christianized commercialize capitalized –\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah. That said that it was problematic.\n\nLola Wright: – Chicago, hip hop crew.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, I will preface this by saying that I love people. I love artistry. I love artists and I love the energy that we put into our work and what have you. I find it crippling to our growth at times. When I hear rappers, it’s great to have your faith and what have you and what moves you. That’s wonderful. But when I think of that projected, when our military is in predominantly Islamic countries firing weapons and operating on Christian principles out loud –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: you know, conflating terrorism and Islam and rappers are like, my God is the greatest God or Jesus is the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah from America.\n\nSaul Williams: I’m like, okay, are you making specifically music for the soldiers to sing along to so they can feel comfortable as they shoot these black and brown kids around the world are, are you aware of the fact that as our country is projecting this Christian fundamentalists ideology. Nonsensical because it has nothing to do with Jesus.\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nSaul Williams: I said, Christian, that has nothing to do with Jesus. It just has to do with this idea of, of this God fearing like all this bullshit that these men in rooms have decided is, you know, like this Christian ideology that will be how we’ll operate and it’s hard to escape those boxes. You can do one to others –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: – without waving your Bible.\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nSaul Williams: You know, you can do that. You know, and you should know that the inventor of the idea of doing unto others the great simplifier who said, who made it really simple and concise like, Oh, okay, here’s a guiding principle. Just treat people the way you want to be treated. You can do that.\n\nSaul Williams: I mean, when I came home from school, once again at seven or eight years old, and Juri Mazola was probably the kindest girl in my elementary school who was, you know, sharing her snack and helping kids with their homework during lunch and dah, dah, dah. And like helping people who didn’t finish their assignments before class and dah, dah, dah and Juri Mazola was Jewish. And I remember coming home and being like, so dad, the nicest girl in my school is this Jewish girl named Juri Mazola, and I mean like she has the most Christ like principals I’ve ever seen in a motherfucker.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: Like it’s crazy. Now she’s born into a Jewish household is she going to hell –\n\nLola Wright: Right!\n\nSaul Williams: – and not until she accepts the Lord Jesus Christ as her savior.\n\nLola Wright: [laughter].\n\nSaul Williams: That’s where I was like seven or eight years old, the first time I was like, I don’t have the words –\n\nLola Wright: Yes!\n\nSaul Williams: – but I know that’s bullshit.\n\nLola Wright: Yes!\n\nSaul Williams: I know that’s bullshit. I know this is where you fucked up in your interpretation of the shit that your practicing. Because there was no way that this motherfucker said that. So 10 years later, I find words and the freedom to explore that. But I was thinking about it all along and then I cut to the modern time at these, these rappers and, and, and hear this expression of this love of Christianity through the music. And I’m like, you know, its relationship to colonialism for that to remain unquestioned, one. I mean, let’s not act like the Catholic church is not the biggest like land owner on the fucking planet. I mean, like their fucking real estate game is so real.\n\nLola Wright: I was just in Rome like –\n\nSaul Williams: Hello? You don’t have to be in Rome. They own every fucking Catholic church on this planet and every country, what are you talking about? You know what I’m saying?\n\nLola Wright: This is Chicago, they’re all over the place.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They’re all over the place, all over the place. And they’re right now in South America and in Africa because they not getting as much, you know, leverage in Europe and America, you know? And so they’re spreading this shit. And then this, these motherfuckers who were like, no, no, no, no condoms. Come on!\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: And so much more and so much more and so much hypocrisy. So much hypocrisy.\n\nLola Wright: So Bodhi is involved, do you know Bishop Yvette Flunder is?\n\nSaul Williams: I’ve heard the name.\n\nLola Wright: So she’s the founder of a body of work called The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries. And she basically comes out of the Pentecostal Church and is a same gender loving woman and you know, founded this body of work to basically be a refuge for queer black people, strong trans community that could, could retain their faith traditions and be fully self expressed. It’s so, it’s amazing like to go to her gatherings, but one of the things, they’re very, very involved in the continent of Africa because the evangelical Christian movement is so strong there for the very reasons you’re talking –\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah yeah. It’s super strong, super strong.\n\nLola Wright: – because they’re losing footing in the United States.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. I’ve seen it. No, I’ve seen it firsthand. I mean like it’s the evangelical American community that has gone to places like Uganda and said that our aid that we want to give you, we have millions of dollars that we’d like to give you, but it’s contingent on the fact that we’d love for you to pass this anti gay law because we can’t get it passed in, in our own country and we want to see how it operates here.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: And so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the bullshit that has been killing us for years.\n\nLola Wright: So how do you –\n\nSaul Williams: Get rid of the church is how the fuck I do it. So what I want to say [laughter] –\n\nLola Wright: I’m with you.\n\nSaul Williams: The same way that like I remember, you know, hearing a lot of like capitalist sentiment in popular hip hop and being like, that’s a little negligent.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: This idea that black capitalism is gonna be a saving grace is negligent.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: And I understand that we all have a lot of reading to do and a lot to think about and what have you. But no, black capitalism is just capitalism. And if you have any questions about that, look at the continent of Africa. You don’t think there’s a bunch of millionaires and billionaires there who have been having money and you still see corruption and government and the way that shit does not trickle down and what have you like come on. In that same way that I thought the expression of capitalism through music is negligent, so is the expression of Christianity through music especially, you know like what Kanye and Rhymefest have Jesus walks in 2004, 2003. It’s the same time that we went to war with Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s the same exact time that this Christian war is going on. And then the biggest song in America is Jesus walks. Nobody else caught that. You fucking kidding me.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: The soldiers are fucking marching to that shit. I’m like, no, that will be the last fucking thing you’ll hear come out of my mouth to try to get these soldiers engaged. Singing this song that’s in their fucking, you know [inaudible].\n\nLola Wright: So when you think about that though, like where I can go is I can get very cynical and discouraged because this past Sunday there was something here called Sunday Service.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.\n\nLola Wright: And there were a lot of Chicagoans.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, it’s a problem! No, it’s even a problem in my family. It’s a problem! I mean don’t get me wrong, like you said, we started by saying what the black church was.\n\nLola Wright: Right.\n\nSaul Williams: And so the black church and its relationship, the black American church and its relationship to music is enough to make anybody go, no, I’m still going to church. And if you doubt that, go back to what you were saying a few minutes ago about the evangelical shit on the continent –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: – and listen to them sing, in the churches, cause the great music that’s happening on the continent, and you know it’s the root of a lot of great music. It ain’t happening in the mother fucking churches.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: In the churches, it’ll sound like, “Oh shit, this thing and this little light of mine.” It’ll sound so out of place and out of character. You’ll be like, some of it is awesome, right? I heard a [laughter], I heard this in Rwanda. I was passing by a church on a Sunday and I heard the beginnings of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry.\n\nLola Wright: Hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: And I was like, Holy shit, they’re singing this in church. And I got close up and they were singing, “No, Jesus, no life.”\n\nLola Wright: Wow!\n\nSaul Williams: [laughter].\n\nLola Wright: Wow, I’m just trying to stay relevant.\n\nSaul Williams: Nah, I mean it worked! I was like, alright, I could take that one. That was, that was interesting [laughs]. But overall, it’s the saddest thing in the world to me sometimes. It’s not to say that we don’t need faith and we don’t need guiding principles, that we don’t need, you know, something to help us stand straight. I believe that essentially, I’ve said it before, that religion is a wonderful crutch to help us stand upright in our understanding of our relationship to each other, to love, to earth, to pain, to suffering, um, and to the greater good. It’s a beautiful crutch to help us stand upright in our understanding of that. But also any doctor will tell you, you know, that if you’ve broken a leg or something and you’ve been operating with a crutch, at some point you have to start practicing walking without your crutches or the muscles will never develop properly.\n\nSaul Williams: And so I just feel that we’re at that point where like if we don’t let go of these crutches, then we’re, our legs or what have you. Our ability to stand is becoming deformed and displaced by the fact that we’re still leaning on this shit. And I see people leaning, and I understand you’re experiencing a great amount of success in your life and you want to be able to be humble in that. And so you say, give it all to God.\n\nLola Wright: Mm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: And I understand that, I understand that. But it only takes, you know, a second of breath and contemplation to acknowledge that the way that it was taught you is just the way that it was taught to you.\n\nLola Wright: Yes.\n\nSaul Williams: But you can still give it up, you know, but in a way that doesn’t contextualize it in this institutional violence. You can find a way to still give it up without necessarily giving in to the crutch of the expression and the way that we’ve been taught to express this relationship to the unseen and what have you, mainly in within the framework of Christianity. And yes, I find it problematic because there’s so many unanswered questions or just unchallenged questions. I mean, people hear this and still feel like, Oh my God, and like you don’t realize that when I challenged the institution of Christianity, it has nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus.\n\nLola Wright: Totally get it.\n\nSaul Williams: And that is the fucking problem.\n\nLola Wright: Exactly.\n\nSaul Williams: It’s that the institution of Christianity, it has nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus. And if it did, it might not even go by a fucking name. It might just be how you operate.\n\nLola Wright: I know that you were, you were a supporter of Bernie Sanders.\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: We’re going –\n\nSaul Williams: For 2016.\n\nLola Wright: For 2016. We’re going into another presidential election. I’m fascinated by the number of people that I’ve been connected to, close with for 30 years. That I would say were some of my teachers in my own awakening.\n\nSaul Williams: Yes.\n\nLola Wright: That have completely given up on voting.\n\nSaul Williams: [laughs]\n\nLola Wright: I feel really troubled by that.\n\nSaul Williams: Yes.\n\nLola Wright: And I get it. In many of their cases, it’s a political stand.\n\nSaul Williams: Of course. Yeah. It is a political stand whether that’s realized or not. It’s a political stand.\n\nLola Wright: Right, exactly. But, yeah I feel concerned about that. So I’m curious if you were to like invite someone who is consciously taking a political stand not to vote, if you were to invite them to reconsider that position, what would you say?\n\nSaul Williams: Well, I feel like that avoids something because I don’t believe that Donald Trump is in office because of motherfuckers who did not vote.\n\nLola Wright: Hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: We all know that Hillary won the popular vote.\n\nLola Wright: Right.\n\nSaul Williams: And we also know who pushes the democratic vote and who was always pushed. I’m talking about black women and black community and what have you. My problem is the motherfuckers who did vote. That 53% of white women. So I’m trying to find a way to get those motherfuckers not to vote [laughs]. Actually.\n\nLola Wright: I totally get it. I’m taking a different approach [laughs].\n\nSaul Williams: [laughing]\n\nSaul Williams: I’m like no, no, no. Just stay home and like wash your flag.\n\nLola Wright: [laughs]\n\nSaul Williams: You know your flag is dirty and that’s not patriotic. You know the new patriotism is like you should hand-wash your flag on voting day [laughs] and don’t vote or use your flag to wash your car because your car will now glisten with American whatever. Like whatever. Like I’m trying to get those cats not to vote. It’s my own gerrymandering [laughs] I’m trying to convince.\n\nLola Wright: Okay, well I wish you the best of luck on that strategy [laughing].\n\nSaul Williams: [laughs].\n\nLola Wright: In the meantime, um in response to that, I actually have a project that’s pretty quiet but it’s called normal white people. And –\n\nSaul Williams: Mm [affirmative]. What is that? [laughing]\n\nLola Wright: It’s basically, it was basically in response to the statistics –\n\nSaul Williams: [inaudible]\n\nLola Wright: Well, so there are couple premises. So one promise is that actually there are white folks out there that, you know cause I think part of the narrative right now is really trying to create this as a binary. And that in an effort to turn this into a binary, you can actually perpetuate that narrative.\n\nSaul Williams: Right?\n\nLola Wright: And so part of the body of work is to say, actually there really are white folks out there that also want to contribute to –\n\nSaul Williams: Of course!\n\nLola Wright: – the awakening of humanity. And what I noticed about myself was that I was sort of hiding out in communities because I didn’t want to deal with white people.\n\nSaul Williams: Right.\n\nLola Wright: And that particularly in the last presidential cycle, it became statistically explicitly clear, if it had not been before, that that was completely reckless and irresponsible on my part.\n\nSaul Williams: Right. What you’re saying is that forward thinking white people need to actually spend the time and money evangelizing in the white community.\n\nLola Wright: Yeah!\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And get the fuck out Africa and South America and [inaudible].\n\nLola Wright: Yeah. And actually that, what I realized about my own self was that my own unhealed stuff with the white community, I was always too big. I was always too loud.\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: There were all kinds of things that didn’t work for me where I grew up.\n\nSaul Williams: So you felt more acceptance elsewhere?\n\nLola Wright: Yeah, I was, I had a context for beauty –\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: – when I found the Chicago hip hop community –\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: – that had never existed for me previously.\n\nSaul Williams: Right.\n\nLola Wright: But what I have had to do is really untangle all of that stuff for myself.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah, because you’re not here to escape.\n\nLola Wright: Exactly!\n\nSaul Williams: Exactly. You also, it’s your business to confront.\n\nLola Wright: Yeah. And if I just right off that 53% –\n\nSaul Williams: Right.\n\nLola Wright: – I’m not confident that that’s going to be an effective strategy. So now I’m like, okay, I have to work with these folks.\n\nSaul Williams: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nLola Wright: And I have to see them as the presence of God itself.\n\nSaul Williams: Mm [laughs].\n\nLola Wright: [laughs]\n\nLola Wright: And see that like that is me. Like where does Donald Trump live in me? And then I gotta, you know, I gotta work with people and [inaudible]. Because someone worked with me, you know?\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah. It’s true. We need to see that. Black Americans have been working with white people for a long time and trying to aid in the process and what have you. And it’s true that that has to be done. And if we cannot count on, because you know, we could solve this, we can nip this in the bud if we just taught proper history, the people’s history –\n\nLola Wright: That’s right. That’s exactly right.\n\nSaul Williams: – in elementary, junior high schools in high schools. Like if we change our educational curriculum, you know, you spend your first year just studying indigenous studies –\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: – all about the histories of, you know, the America’s before, you know, any Europeans arrived here, you know, and find out where you are, what state the names and your state that correspond with the people that were there, all the shit that we don’t know.\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nLola Wright: But it’s always coming out out of, “Oh, I’m from Wyoming.”\n\nLola Wright: [laughs]\n\nSaul Williams: And we never correlate like the truth and the history and the peoples of that land. You know, like even just in Canada, any public forum in Canada, you first have to acknowledge the rightful owners and protectors of the land where you’re standing in whatever city and whatever building and whatever venue and whatever bank, in whatever. You have to acknowledge that before you say whatever else you want to make a speech.\n\nLola Wright: Wow.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah. That’s just in Canada. Like we wouldn’t have to travel far to find different ways –\n\nLola Wright: Models.\n\nSaul Williams: Yea, different models of how to do shit. That’s the law in Canada. You have to first acknowledge, you know, we are on, you know, this land first giving honor to them and dah dah, dah, dah now. And so we replaced that with, you know, the [inaudible]. “Giving honor to God who my root and my salvage.”\n\nLola Wright: [laughs]\n\nSaul Williams: You know. That’s what I’m saying. It’s like you want to honor God, honor the people who stood on this land before you ever stood here. That’s how you honor God.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: That’s the thing that I would love to see happen. I mean that’s really everything. If we could change our educational system, if we can change our educational system and teach true indigenous history, true history of the enslaved Africans that came and put, you know, take out the supremacist notion and stop talking in terms of the greatness that you know, Europeans brought. Let’s talk about diseases. Let’s talk about, I mean like the germ traveled faster than the bullet.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: Right. One of the things we never like really talk about is that the time between, you know, the first explorers arriving on the North American continent and then the arrival of the pilgrims, there’s a hundred years between that time. So you have people that arrived, said, Holy shit, this is here, left. And then a hundred years later is when the pilgrims arrived.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: When the pilgrims arrived, they’re like, we had writings that said that there were hundreds and thousands of people here. Where are they?\n\nLola Wright: Mm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: The germs from that first arrival over the course of a hundred years may have already killed like 75% of the population.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: So that people are arriving in places that seem like, Oh, this was a village or this is, why is it empty? There’s a whole history that were not even fucking taught!\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nSaul Williams: We need to know this!\n\nLola Wright: Yes.\n\nSaul Williams: Then we can fucking celebrate American history. Then we can have some fucking pride in the right thing.\n\nLola Wright: Yeah.\n\nSaul Williams: Building up to, okay, now, then they decided they wanted to leave England and not be a part of that. Okay. But there’s a bunch of shit before that.\n\nLola Wright: I think what’s also interesting about your perspective, as I heard you say recently, like America was originally like a fresh idea.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah!\n\nLola Wright: So I think that the point is –\n\nSaul Williams: Wait, let’s be clear, there could be something fresh in people arriving someplace acknowledging the people that were there and the people being welcoming and saying, yes, you’re welcome to be here. You know, participate in what we’re doing and ba ba ba ba ba. So there’s nothing fresh in genocide.\n\nLola Wright: Of course.\n\nSaul Williams: You know, except for the blood.\n\nLola Wright: Yes, yes, yes. But I think sometimes people create this divide like, Oh, so all you want to do is now go way back over the last 400 years with [inaudible]. It’s like all of this can be true. All of this can coexist. We can acknowledge what actually happened here.\n\nSaul Williams: This is how we build greatness.\n\nLola Wright: That’s exactly right.\n\nSaul Williams: It’s through acknowledging what actually happened that we’re able to create models that sustain.\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nLola Wright: You know, like we’re talking about all this environmental shit. Like that’s the new thing. Like okay, Greta Thunberg is here and all that. What the fuck do you think the indigenous community has been saying from the jump? Thank you for finally deciding to listen to the motherfuckers that were telling you this from the jump.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: Don’t act like you invented this shit. You invented waste. That’s it. There was no waste on the continent of Africa before. This sounds like some crazy generalization, but there was no waste on the continent of Africa before a certain time period post independence when the importation of foreign goods made of plastic and and some of the aid or what have you was contingent on the acceptance of just plastic into some of these countries and suddenly there was waste that didn’t make sense and the environment anymore cause everything else like you know they, there was a use for everything. There was composting, there was all this stuff, there was no waste.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: So [inaudible].\n\nLola Wright: All right, well so I know you have like 97 other places to be, but I have one final question.\n\nSaul Williams: Yeah.\n\nLola Wright: How do you be with all of that and still maintain any degree of optimism, your spiritual center, your inner peace?\n\nSaul Williams: Overall, people are beautiful. I have a lot of patience with people. I like people. I really like people. I enjoy conversations, when I want them. [laughs]\n\nLola Wright: [laughs]\n\nSaul Williams: Music has always been the thing for me that allows me to maintain a level of peace and excitement. I love musicians. I love also though what music feeds in me. So I listened to a lot of music. I listened to a lot of people and I also try to contribute to that conversation by making music as well. When I say that I’m fed by music, part of it is the creative process. And the other part of it is the listening process. I’m also fed by literature, big time, um, by living and nonliving authors. Um, there’s so much beautiful literature. There’s so much beautiful music, so much beautiful art. Honestly, that’s how I’m fed. I’ve always had the same response to optimism. It’s not so much about that. I think that if you’re grounded, you know, the Dow talks about, you know, hope being as hollow is fear. So keep your feet firmly planted.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: You know. The reckoning of you know the truth and the inevitability of us stepping into that greater and greater harmony is inevitable. Like we know where war leads.\n\nLola Wright: Mm hmm [affirmative].\n\nSaul Williams: Even if we have to be reminded, each generation divided by the powers that be what have you, we know where it leads and so our growth is inevitable. This harmony that we yearned for and fight for it is also inevitable. We’re just trying to lessen the bloodshed –\n\nLola Wright: That’s exactly right.\n\nSaul Williams: – in the process.\n\nLola Wright: That’s right.\n\nSaul Williams: So it’s not optimism.\n\nLola Wright: Yes, thank you. I appreciate that distinction.\n\nSaul Williams: I’m just trying to steer, to help steer like yo, if we do it this way, maybe we can avoid the bullshit that’s going to hit by us denying it for another 400 years. Face you’re fucking history, face your past. That’s what this country has to do. Face it and how do you face it? In your educational system. Face it.\n\nLola Wright: Face it is like the perfect invitation for all areas of life.\n\nSaul Williams: Boom.\n\nLola Wright: Saul Williams, I am deeply appreciative of who you are on the planet. I am deeply grateful for the impact that you’ve had on my life. You are a model for how to be free and self-expressed and I believe that is the greatest gift you can give to humanity. Seriously.\n\nSaul Williams: Thank you.\n\nLola Wright: So I, I appreciate you.\n\nLola & Saul: [laughter]\n\nLola Wright: Thank you for being here. Chicago is better with you having come through.\n\nSaul Williams: Thank you.\n\nLola Wright: I’m so grateful you were with us for our second episode with Saul Williams on, And this is Bodhi. Again, my name is Lola Wright. If you’re not already connected with me, please find me @lolapwright. Find Bodhi @bodhichicago. Find Saul Williams @saulwilliams. Get yourself connected. I think one of the things I appreciated most about this last conversation was his real critique of our educational system as it relates to understanding the history, the formation of that which we now call the United States. If you’re looking for resources that really provide an accurate and perhaps non-biased understanding of the history of this country, check out Howard Zinn’s, “A People’s History.” It’s a great book that will disrupt much of learning that you perhaps got in school and that is extremely important. He also talked about this idea of face it. In that particular context, it was face the history that formed this country and our unwillingness to do so continues to keep us in suffering.\n\nLola Wright: I think that’s absolutely true about the state of this country, but I think it’s also true about your individual life. If there is something that you are dealing with that you’re unwilling to face, expect it will continue to be a loop of suffering. So two invitations. Check out, “A People’s History” by Howard Zinn and invite yourself into a practice of looking at the things you’ve historically been unwilling to look at. Your practice of being with that and anything that comes up around that will actually set you free and I promise you it is not one and done. It is a life long practice. Our next episode is with our creative producer, Tyler Greene. As he interviews me and my journey, I trust that that will be juicy, rich, interesting and I’d love for you to hang out with us there."
