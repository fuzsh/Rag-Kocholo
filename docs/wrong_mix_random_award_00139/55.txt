WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Feb. 19, 2007 – On Thursday, Feb. 22, Saul Williams will present Black History Month’s keynote speech at Williams College, at 8 p.m. in the Paresky Center performance space. The title of the speech is “The Connection of Poetry and Hip Hop.”

His recent book, “The Dead Emcee Scrolls: The Lost Teachings of Hip Hop,” tours the history of hip-hop.

He is the author of three collections of poetry: “said the shotgun to the head,” “She,” and “The Seventh Octave.”

In 2005, Williams performed with the Basel Symphony Orchestra of Switzerland, a symphony based on his book, “said the shotgun to the head,” composed by the legendary Thomas Kessler.

Williams is a writer and actor who has worked to make poetry accessible, or as he says, “a living art form.”

He wrote and acted in the film, “Slam,” which won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize ’98,

His musical debut, “Amethyst Rock Star,” was produced by rock/hip hop producer, Rick Rubin, and received the high praises of The Times of London.

Williams has made several television appearances, including a recurring role on the UPN sitcom “Girlfriends,” HBO’s “Def Poetry Jam,” “The Orlando Jones Show,” “Politically Incorrect” and many more.

His recent work has been for the Not In Our Name pro-peace initiative.
