        "text": "American politician\n\n\"Senator Melcher\" redirects here. For the Kansas state senate member, see Jeff Melcher.\n\nJohn David Melcher (September 6, 1924 â€“ April 12, 2018) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who represented Montana for four terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977 and as a United States Senator for two terms from 1977 until 1989.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMelcher was born in Sioux City, Iowa; his paternal grandparents were from Germany.[1] He attended the University of Minnesota before joining the military. He served in the United States Army during World War II, and participated in the D-Day Invasion of Normandy with the 76th Infantry Division in Europe during World War II.[2] He was wounded in action in Germany and awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman's Badge and the Bronze Star.[3]\n\nMelcher married Ruth Klein in 1945. They had six children.[3]\n\nHe graduated from Iowa State University in 1950. Later he moved to Forsyth, Montana, and established a veterinary clinic.[3]\n\nPolitical career\n\n[edit]\n\nMelcher served on the Forsyth City Council. He then served as mayor of Forsyth in 1955, for three terms. In 1960, he was elected to the Montana House of Representatives for Rosebud County.[3]\n\nIn 1962, he was elected to the Montana Senate.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was elected to the United States House of Representatives by special election on June 24, 1969, to fill a vacancy created when the incumbent, Republican James F. Battin, resigned to accept an appointment to the Federal bench. Melcher was re-elected to the three succeeding Congresses and served from June 24, 1969, to January 3, 1977.[4]\n\nU.S. Senate\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1976, he was elected to the United States Senate to succeed retiring Democratic Senator Mike Mansfield.\n\nMelcher was re-elected in 1982 against Republican Larry R. Williams. Melcher had been targeted by National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) as potentially vulnerable, and he was subjected to attack ads depicting him as \"too liberal for Montana\". Melcher's response became a classic of campaign advertising, featuring a shot of an \"out-of-stater\" carrying a briefcase full of money, followed by a conversation among several cows deploring their intervention in the race.[5][6]\n\nAfter Congress\n\n[edit]\n\nHis campaign for re-election in 1988 was unsuccessful; he was defeated by Republican Conrad Burns.[4] Melcher attributed the loss to a lack of time spent campaigning. A wilderness management bill he co-sponsored was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan only days before the 1988 election.[2]\n\nMelcher was a candidate again for the same seat in the 1994 Senate election for an attempted rematch with Burns, but lost to Jack Mudd in the primary, who in turn was also defeated by Burns by 62% - 38%.[7]\n\nPolitical positions and legislative contributions\n\n[edit]\n\nMelcher had generally liberal views on environmental issues, but was pro-life and supported prayer in public schools.[2] He was a co-sponsor of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which regulated coal strip mining.[3]\n\nMelcher was responsible in 1984 for an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act that required psychological well-being to be protected in primate research.[8] This legislation was praised by Jane Goodall,[9] and in 1987 he was the presenter to her of the Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute.[10]\n\nLater life\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter serving in the Senate, Melcher worked as a lobbyist for multiple organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association.[2][11]\n\nMelcher died on April 12, 2018, in Missoula, Montana, at the age of 93.[12][13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Melcher Interviews Oral History Project (University of Montana Archives)\n\nUnited States Congress. \"John Melcher (id: M000635)\".
