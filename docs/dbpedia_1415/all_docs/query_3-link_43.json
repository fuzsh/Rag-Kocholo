        "text": "Hardy's image quickly went viral on Reddit, and users said they were shocked by what the former president might look like today.\n\nHardy envisioned the first president in a modern way\n\nHardy, a musician and lead singer in his band, Strangers Club, taught himself graphic design and photo-editing skills during the pandemic. He told Insider that he wanted to give historical figures documented in paintings a modern look.\n\n\"I have always looked at images of historical figures who lived before the advent of the camera, and it's always caused me to imagine them in my mind as real people,\" he told Insider.\n\nHardy started by examining existing portraits of Washington and picking out commonalities, like the shape of his nose or face.\n\nHe said he applied an image of the Texas Republican Congressman Roger Williams as the base of the picture in Photoshop. He overlayed other photos of modern-day celebrities, like Michael Douglas and Glenn Close, and merged those onto the base image.\n\nThe finished product was Hardy's \"idea of Washington as a modern politician,\" he said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHardy's image is the reverse of the painting technique known as photo-realism, which the British art gallery Tate Modern describes as \"a painting style that emerged in Europe and the USA in the late 1960s.\" Photo-realistic art often replicates the look of a photograph, according to Artsy.\n\nHardy said the project took a few hours to complete and that it was \"weird\" looking at a rendering of Washington in the form of a photograph.\n\n\"I know this is supposed to be George Washington, but it's as though my brain had convinced itself the man had always been a painting,\" he said.\n\nHardy posted the image on Reddit, and it's attracted more than 200,000 shares.\n\n\"Looking good for a 289-year-old,\" one user wrote on Hardy's rendition of Washington.\n\nIn response, other Redditors started seemingly creating and sharing their own modern-day versions of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHardy said his next idea is to create a similar-style photo of modern-day William Shakespeare."
