        "meta_description": "< Back to Highlights The Picture Room contains some of Sir John Soane’s most treasured works of art, including masterpieces by Hogarth, Canaletto, Turner and Piranesi. Soane used moving ‘picture planes’ to allow him to hang a small 13-by-12-foot room with 118 paintings, a collection large enough for a room three times its size. You can also learn about the Picture Room in our Highlights Film. Find out more > A Rake’s Progress: The Conservation We are starting restoration of our iconic A Rake’s Progress (a series of 8 pictures), painted by William Hogarth c.1734. The whole project will take several years, concluding, we hope, around April 2027. The work is now underway, which will see each canvas treated over the course of the conservation programme. Facsimiles are being used to complete the set in the Picture Room when individual paintings are away being restored. The conservation is being carried out in response to detailed assessments of these national treasures by a number of different specialists who have identified that urgent work is required to ensure the pictures continue to delight future generations.",

        "text": "Hogarth's 'modern moral subjects' Back to top\n\nWilliam Hogarth (1697 - 1764), An Election I: The Election Entertainment, 1754-55, Oil on canvas.\n\nRenowned English artist William Hogarth (1697–1764) is best known for his series of paintings and engravings which depict ‘modern moral subjects’. Filled with dark humour and bawdy satire, these narrative series mock the excesses of Georgian society and warn of the consequences of moral abandonment. Sir John Soane purchased two of Hogarth’s series, A Rake’s Progress and An Election.\n\nThe four-part An Election is based on a real-life election in Oxfordshire between the Whig and Tory parties in 1764, satirising the corruption rife at every level in both camps. In I: The Election Entertainment, the Whigs hold a riotous dinner for powerful friends. The Mayor has fainted after gorging on oysters, a servant empties a chamber pot out of the window into the Tory demonstration outside, and one of the candidates, flirting with a fat old woman, is unaware his wig is being set on fire. In II: Canvasing for Votes, a young farmer is offered bribes by agents of both, and in III: The Polling, mentally unsound and dying or perhaps even dead voters are being brought to the polling, whilst in the background, a coach carrying an allegory of Britannia has broken apart, whilst its drivers, unaware, are absorbed in a game of cards. The final scene, IV: Chairing the Member, depicts a vicious fight erupting as the victorious candidate is paraded through the streets. As well as its political content, An Election is notable as perhaps Hogarth’s finest painted series, filled with still-life details and pastoral landscapes, and represents his desire to be seen as an artist as well as a political satirist."
