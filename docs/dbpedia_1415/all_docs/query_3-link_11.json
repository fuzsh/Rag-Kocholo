        "text": "The format behind the best artist images\n\nYour artist profile picture is displayed next to content on Apple Music, the iTunes Store, and Shazam in all countries where that content is available. Images can be uploaded or updated by anyone with Profile EditorÂ permissions in Apple Music for Artists.\n\nSupported file formats\n\nSize 2400 x 2400 pixels or greater preferred, 800 x 800 pixels minimum, do not upscale images Resolution 72 dpi File Type JPG or PNG\n\nHow to crop your image\n\nWhen you upload an artist image, a window will appear to make sure the image is cropped and sized according to Apple guidelines.\n\nFollow the instructions shown in the cropping tool, keeping eyebrows and lips within the guidelines shown below. If youâre uploading a logo instead of photography, make sure the entire logo fits within the guidelines, and that itâs vertically and horizontally centered with a fully opaque background (no transparency/alpha allowed).\n\nCommon issues to avoid\n\nEnsure your image avoids these three common rejection issues: low-quality or pixelated content, borders, and text.\n\nNo pixelation or low-resolution images.\n\nNo borders of any kind.\n\nNo marketing copy, third-party logos of any kind, or typography.\n\nOne last thing\n\nOnly upload photos you have legal authorization to share. Images that do not meet the guidelines, or do not meet our presentation standards, may be rejected or removed.Â The image should be a representation of you as an artist, such as a photograph, logo, or character drawing, as depicted on other platforms. Note, if uploading a character image or band logo, the character image or logo text should fall within the cropping guidelines of the image upload tool.\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n\nNo low-quality, pixelated, mismatched, misaligned, or rotated images\n\nNo advertisements for content (for example, âIncludes DVDâ or âIncludes Lyricsâ)\n\nNo artist album cover art or QR codes\n\nNo use of marketing copy, third-party logos of any kind, or typography, including names of band members, roles, dates, instruments, or current and former bands\n\nNo borders\n\nNo attempt to upsell a product; the image should be a representation of the artist\n\nNo misleading images (for example, depicting or referencing an artist not associated with the original artist)\n\nNo URLs for websites that sell music or compete with Apple Music or iTunes\n\nNo use of the terms âApple Music,â âï£¿MUSIC,â or âiTunesâ\n\nNo pornography or website URLs that link to pornography\n\nNo Nazi symbolism restricted by the Strafgesetzbuch section 86a, if the content is visible in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland. Be aware if this happens three times (where a photo in these territories is delivered with Nazi imagery), your entire catalog will be suspended in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for up to six months.\n\nNo images or themes not legal or appropriate for all countries, or that encourage unlawful conduct, or are otherwise obscene, objectionable, or in poor taste."
