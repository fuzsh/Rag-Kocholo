        "text": "Let me make something abundantly clear – I’d love to vote for Bernie Sanders in November.\n\nI say this because I make it quite clear that should Hillary become the nominee, I’ll be voting for Trump.\n\nThat said, wow – how about Bernie?!?\n\nCurrently he’s won 7 of the 8 primaries or caucuses. He’s doing so well, in fact, that he’s forcing Hillary out of her element.\n\nWe’ve seen how that turns out before:\n\nDespite the problems of Hillary – kissing Wall Street’s ass, her non-excitement among young voters, the years of baggage – the Montana Democratic Party will fall all over itself to support her.\n\nHell, they’ve already sold the state’s 27 delegates to Hillary for a $64,100 donation to her victory fund.\n\nThis shouldn’t really surprise anyone. After all, we know full well that the Montana Democratic Party is seen as nothing more than a funnel, a funnel that can get money from local areas to national.\n\nNothing shows that more clearly than the annual Williams Dinner.\n\nWhere doe the money go?\n\nAs you can see, this year it’s on April 30 and it’ll have Denise Juneau as the main speaker.\n\nI’d like you to pay attention to where the money goes, however – to “help elect Democrats statewide by funding Missoula County Democrats’ Turnout 2016 Campaign.”\n\nSo…what’s the Missoula County Democrats’ Turnout 2016 Campaign?\n\nI have no idea, nor was I able to find anything on that.\n\nWhat I do know is that in the past, money from the Williams Dinner has been used to help national races, not local races.\n\nI know this because I’ve seen the numbers.\n\nI don’t have numbers for 2015 but you might remember my post-election report from November 2014 that mentioned the dinner.\n\nHere’s what I wrote:\n\nAgain, local is waiting on state which is waiting on national. And when I say waiting on national, I mean we’re tapping on a turtle’s shell and hoping they stick their head out soon so we can get some direction.\n\nThis is the wrong approach, and the numbers tell the tale. From the Williams/Williams fundraising dinner in May, the Missoula Democrats raised $19,738.87. The cost of that was $11,668.35, leaving us with a net gain of $8,070.52. Next, or at least over the course of the year, $7,800 was given to campaigns. That leaves just $270.52 out of that Williams Dinner.\n\nThere are a few other expenditures here and there, some more income, but let’s face it, is the one major cash-cow for the Missoula Democrats. And we’re giving $7,800 to campaigns? Campaigns need to be giving that money to us!\n\nTickets to the Williams Dinner cost $45 or $80 if you want the reception as well.\n\nOf course, you can pay a lot more…a lot more.\n\nI’m sure they’ll do quite well, taking in around $8,000. Again, I’m sure about $300 of that will go to local races.\n\nWhen I say local, I’m pretty much talking about the legislature, school board, maybe even City Council when that comes around.\n\nI sure as shit ain’t talkin’ about Hillary or even Bernie. I’m not talking about Denise Juneau, either.\n\nYeah…she’s statewide – that’s not local.\n\nBesides that, she should have no problem tapping into the corrupt donor network that the National Democrats rely on.\n\nHell, we’re funneling so much money up the chain that she should be given the phone and email list.\n\nI’m not sure she is, however. Remember, it’s more important that any money Juneau could get instead gets funneled toward Hillary.\n\nNot only does Hillary need to knock off that damn Bernie but she needs to win the general as well.\n\nWe’ve seen quite clearly that Jon Tester has no problem attacking Democrats he doesn’t like, why should others be different?\n\nThey’re not, something I know quite well firsthand.\n\nFor the most part I just feel sorry. I feel sorry for everyone that thinks this Williams Dinner is going to help them.\n\nWho are the Williams’ anyways?\n\n​Montana's Pat Williams\n\nJohn Patrick Williams was born in Helena on October 30, 1937.\n\nHe went to the University of Montana then William Jewell College is Missouri and then the University of Denver in Colorado. It was at that last one that he finally got a BA. After that he became a teacher in Butte.\n\nIn 1966 Pat Williams, as he then went by, was elected to the Montana House of Representatives out of Silver Bow County’s District 23. He won reelection in 1968 and then starting in 1969 he was the executive assistant to Representative John Melcher in Washington.\n\nIn 1974 Williams tried for the U.S. House of Representatives but was defeated by Max Baucus. Baucus nabbed 29,000 votes in the primary, Williams managed 21,000 and 1956 gubernatorial loser Arnold Olsen picked up 17,000.\n\nWilliams came back in 1978 to try for the 1st District U.S. House Seat and defeated Dorothy Bradley in the primary. Next up he defeated Jim Waltermire in the general, 86,000 votes to 64,000, or 57% to 43%.\n\nThe 1986 book Politics in America: The 100th Congress tells us that “Williams’ strong ties to organized labor ‘helped bring him to Congress and help keep him there,’” a key part of that being his “high AFL-CIO vote rating.”\n\nIn regard to labor, Williams “led efforts to ban private employers from using lie-detector tests and staunchly defended the sometimes controversial Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”\n\nWilliams began serving in Washington in 1979 and was also a key supporter of environmental legislation. He sought to protect the Wilderness Act of 1964 so that it’d cover National Forest lands as well. He advocated for higher taxes on corporations as well as reductions in defense spending so that the country could lower the deficit.\n\nPolitics in America described Williams as:\n\n“A man who likes to open a debate with a table-pounding harangue complaining of injustice to unions or teachers, then turn around and negotiate patiently and amicably with those he has denounced as unjust.”\n\nWilliams was “part of the emerging liberal coalition on the key House Budget Committee” in 1986, though the committee was not strong enough “to change the Reagan administration trend toward reduced government action.”\n\nWilliams was instrumental in getting more rights for the disabled, especially in schools. He helped produced “a bill giving states more incentives to expand handicapped services to preschool children.”\n\nThe big problem came in 1992 when the first election of the joint-districts took place. Both Williams and Ron Marlenee had been in Washington since 1978. Only one of them would remain."
