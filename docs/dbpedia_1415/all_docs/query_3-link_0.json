        "text": "AussieInBgOctober 2020\n\n”in the picture” - for something that is a part/element of the visual image of the picture such as a person / building / scenery and so on.\n\n”on the picture” - something physically different from the picture that is somehow connected or attached to the picture such as dust, a coffee cup, the edge of a frame, glass protection and so on.\n\nSo, the word ”to be depicted” means to be featured or to be the theme of sth. This is all a part/element of the picture. Therefore, ”depicted in the picture” is the correct phrase."
