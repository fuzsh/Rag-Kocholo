        "text": "October 29, 1938 – December 7, 2015\n\nHarvey Rattey\n\nHarvey Rattey was a Native American member of the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa Tribe. He, his bother and their three sisters were raised on a cattle ranch bordering Fort Belknap Reservation near Harlem, Montana. During the past 35 years, his love of cowboys and wildlife has inspired him to create artwork with both “wild and wooly” action and empathy. However, his greatest passion was the portrayal of the Native American people and their way of life during the period of history that spans the end of the Plains Indians’ nomadic way of life to the contemporary era of Native American people in mainstream society.\n\nHarvey chose to portray his ancestors and the people he knows in a representational art form foregoing the growing trend toward abstraction. “The images of my people,” he said, “are clear and realistic mental scenes. I feel it’s important to depict these images authentically in my work. My sculptures capture the essence of moments from history for viewers to enjoy and ponder.” He lived in Glendive, Montana with his wife Pamela Harr, also a sculptor, and their 6 children until he passed away in December 2015.\n\nAwards, Accolades, and Experience\n\nHarvey accomplished a great deal in his long career as a sculptor.
