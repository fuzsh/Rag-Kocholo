        "text": "From Our President and CEO\n\nDear Access Living friends and allies,\n\nSince I assumed the CEO role at Access Living in March 2020, our world has dramatically changed. We have faced a rising global pandemic leaving hundreds of thousands dead – too many of them people with disabilities. We are confronting a long overdue racial reckoning in our country and even in the disability community. An unprecedented economic crisis has further frayed our already fragile social safety net.\n\nAccess Living has risen to face the challenges before us – providing relief funds directly to Chicagoans with disabilities, defending our healthcare, education, housing and transportation, working to become a more racially equitable organization from the inside and on the outside through our racial justice policy and community organizing work here in Chicago.\n\nOur mission has taken on a new sense of urgency. We can’t ignore the fact that people with disabilities are among the most diverse and fastest growing segment of the population. Disability is universal, it is intersectional and it touches us all.\n\nWe must use this moment as an opportunity to create a more just, equitable and accessible future for all people with disabilities – in Chicago and across the nation.\n\nAnd Access Living – through our supports and services alongside our systems change advocacy, is well positioned to tackle the challenges AND seize the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nBut we can only do this with your partnership and your support. Thank you for joining us in the fight that lies ahead.\n\nKaren Tamley\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nAccess Living\n\nWe’re On The Front Line\n\nThe pandemic has shown the cracks in the system in every issue area Access Living works on. In a sense, the COVID-19 pandemic amplified what people with disabilities already know – and have known for a long time — that too many of us are without resources, accessibility and services in the best of times. Learn more about how COVID-19 has impacted disabled people and what Access Living has done to provide support.\n\nOur Impact: A Look Back\n\nDuring her 40 years as Access Living’s founding President and CEO, Marca Bristo, who passed away in 2019, changed hearts and minds. At our 2020 virtual gala, Lead On LIVE, we celebrated Marca’s life along with the 40th Anniversary of Access Living and the 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nAccess Living’s Board Chair John Schmidt sets the stage, as we take a look back at Marca’s work and legacy; the driving forces behind the passage of the ADA and its impact on the disability community; and how disability advocates laid the groundwork for the work Access Living is doing today."
