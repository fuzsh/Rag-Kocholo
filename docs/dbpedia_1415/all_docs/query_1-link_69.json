        "text": "HELENA - Perhaps it is no surprise that Rep. Denny Rehberg, Montana's lone congressman, is comfortable living in his congressional office. Swank housing is not something he traditionally had a lot of experience with.\n\nRehberg grew up in a log structure initially built to store grain near a steep, sandstone bluff overlooking Billings. Until he was in about the third grade, the building had exactly three rooms: a bathroom, a combined kitchen-dining-living room, and a bedroom shared by his entire family, including his parents.\n\n\"They finally rounded up the money to tack on some bedrooms,\" Rehberg said in a recent interview, but until he left for college, he lived his entire life in the ersatz grain storage building.\n\nNow running for his fourth, two-year term in Congress against Democratic state lawmaker Monica Lindeen, Republican Rehberg is not a new face or name in Montana politics.\n\nRehberg's dad, Jack Rehberg, served in the state Legislature and ran unsuccessfully against Democratic Congressman John Melcher in 1970. Denny Rehberg himself served three terms in the Montana State House from 1985 until 1989. He was a lieutenant governor under two governors - Stan Stephens and Marc Racicot.\n\nIn 1996, Rehberg ran a fierce but unsuccessful bid to unseat longtime Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. And in 2000, his hat was again in the political ring when he faced off against Democrat Nancy Keenan in a bitter race for the open congressional seat left by the retiring Rick Hill.\n\nRehberg squeaked out a victory in that race, but his subsequent two races in 2002 and 2004 have been runaways, with Rehberg enjoying lopsided victories in both. Rehberg has been a popular congressman, according to polls. In a recent Lee Newspapers poll conducted at the end of September, about 52 percent of would-be voters said they would vote for Rehberg. That figure, while down somewhat from similar polls in past elections, was nonetheless 20 points ahead of Lindeen.\n\nRehberg has staked out some familiar Republican ground: He favors tax cuts, believes a free market can help fix the nation's health insurance problems and is reluctant to call for tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks.\n\nBut he has also broken ranks from his party, most recently when he voted in favor of doing away with anonymous earmarks or representatives slipping money for local projects into bills without attaching their names to it.\n\nRehberg dismisses talk that he intends to run against Baucus in 2006, when both men will be up for re-election.\n\n\"I have no intent to run for the U.S. Senate,\" he said. \"I like what I'm doing.\"\n\nRehberg's Montana roots run deep. His great-great grandfather left Prussia in the 1860s and came to Montana, taking up as a farmer north of Helena. His great-grandfather A.J., with whom Rehberg was very close, struck out on his own at age 11, making a living breaking horses before ranching in Blaine County and eventually ending up in Billings.\n\nA.J. Rehberg opened a dairy west of town where Rehberg Lane in Billings now runs and also had ranch land north of town beyond the Rims, the striking sandstone bluffs that form Billings' northern boundary. Rehberg's grandfather died before the future congressman was born, but Rehberg grew up in the grain storage building at the dairy and ranch headquarters on the Rims near his great-grandparents who continued to run the ranch.\n\nHis dad opened a restaurant across from what is now Montana State University-Billings. Called The Milky Way, the restaurant was open seven days a week until 1 a.m., serving ice cream from the Rehberg dairy, but was just as well known for its steaks and burgers. Rehberg's mom went to college, earning a degree in elementary education. So Rehberg's childhood was divided between the college library, where he hung out with his mom, the restaurant, where his dad flipped burgers and served gigantic banana splits to the college kids, and bouncing around the ranch with his great-grandfather.\n\nRehberg's first foray into politics grew out of necessity: Shortly after he and his high school sweetheart, Jan, married after college, she said she wanted to go to law school. With a new degree in public administration, Rehberg wanted to go somewhere he could put his education to use. They ended up in Washington, D.C., where Jan Rehberg went to law school and Denny Rehberg took a job with Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.\n\nIn 1982, the pair returned to Billings, where Jan worked as a lawyer and Rehberg took over the family ranch. Rehberg and his sister inherited the place from their great-grandmother, but he said estate taxes forced them to sell some of the ranch including the house and the barn - and Rehberg said he felt like he was starting almost from scratch.\n\n\"Those were some pretty lean years for us,\" he said.\n\nHe and Jan lived in a little house behind a mall in Billings. He commuted to the ranch.\n\nRehberg's political days might have been behind him in by early 1990s, after he'd served three terms in the state House. But in 1991 he got an unexpected phone call: Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad had resigned and Republican Gov. Stan Stephens needed a second-in-command.\n\nRehberg got an invitation to come to Helena. He and Jan assumed it was a long-shot interview for the lieutenant governor job, but neither figured Rehberg had a chance.\n\nInstead, he was offered the job on the spot and took it. Rehberg was about half way home in Harlowton before he called Jan.\n\nHe'll spare you the details of that conversation except to say, \"We pretty much came to the conclusion I wasn't going to do that again.\"\n\nWhile Rehberg's political stance has historically been mainstream conservative, his views on ranching are decisively nontraditional. He managed his ranch using holistic practices, which emphasizes ecological concepts. Later, after taking losses in traditional cattle industry, Rehberg switched to raising cashmere goats, which are valuable not only for their hair that is spun into cashmere, but also their weed-eating ability and for their meat.\n\nRehberg still owns his goat herd, although they are now rented out to a ranch between Helena and Great Falls. A neighbor rents his ranch land near Billings.\n\nRehberg and his wife also subdivided a piece of the ranch closest to town.\n\nRehberg maintains no residence in Washington, D.C. He literally lives in his congressional office. He is home every weekend, trying to spend at least one day with his family, who moved back to Montana after a short stint in Washington, and the other day traveling the state.\n\n\"I spend no extra time in D.C.,\" he said. \"It's all business while I'm there.\"\n\nDenny Rehberg\n\nOffice Sought: U.S. House of Representatives\n\nSalary: $165,200\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nBirthdate and place: Oct. 5, 1955, Billings\n\nHome: Billings\n\nOccupation: U.S. congressman\n\nFamily: Wife, Jan; son, A.J., 22; daughters Katie, 18, and Elsie, 8.\n\nEducation: Graduated from Billings West High School, 1973, Washington State University, 1977\n\nPast employment: 1979-1982, legislative assistant, Rep.
