        "text": "In the picture is the common phrase to use when talking about the people or things shown when a photograph is taken. If someone or something is in a picture the picture shows that person or thing. It is a picture of that person or thing. If something is on a picture it is touching the picture. The picture itself is not showing that thing.\n\nIt is common to hear the phrase in the picture when someone is talking about usually people who are shown in a photograph, portrait, drawing, or other picture. Below are some examples of how this phrase is used.\n\nThere were four people in the picture on the wall. [=four people are pictured; it is a picture of four people]\n\nI see your uncle in that picture! [=the picture is of your uncle]\n\nWho is that person next to you in the picture? [=who was next to you when the picture was taken?]\n\nHere is a picture from my party. My mother was there but she's not in the picture. [=my mother did not have her picture taken at the party; she is not shown]\n\nThe phrase on the picture is not used to talk about who is shown in a photograph, and would only be used to talk about something touching a picture that is not represented as part of the image. Below are some examples of how this phrase is used.\n\nThere is some dirt on the picture of our dog [=the picture has dirt on its surface] and it needs to be wiped off.\n\nPlease don't set your book down on these pictures [=on top of these pictures]; I'm trying to organize them.\n\nShe put a heart-shaped sticker on the picture of us in the scrapbook. [=a heart-shaped sticker was added to the picture in the scrapbook]\n\nJust remember: if you want to say who a photograph shows, use in the picture. If something external is touching a photograph, use on the picture.\n\nI hope this helps."
