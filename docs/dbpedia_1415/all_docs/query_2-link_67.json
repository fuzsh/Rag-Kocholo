        "text": "The backdrop on the traverse was the Wrong Ridge just across the valley\n\nI've entered the Bob Marshall a couple of times from the Washboard Reef and each time I've looked across a broad ridge that leads to Teton Pass wondering how it would be to walk across it.\n\nFriday I found out, doing the traverse from Teton to Washboard.\n\nIt is a long day hike --- about 17 miles--- with some 5,000 feet of elevation gained.\n\nTaking advantage of snow for \"skiing\"\n\nWe found considerable snow, enough that at one point I almost turned around because I questioned the footing on the ridge's high point. Enormous cornices still hang off the east and north facing slopes of the ridge line.\n\nThe views on this ridge are remarkable.\n\nWe were facing the spectacular Wrong Ridge just across the valley. It looks like something that was chunked off the Chinese Wall. Pentagon and Silver Tip peaks dominated the western horizon. We could see Stimson, Flinsch and Rising Wolf peaks in Glacier National Park. To our east and north were Lockhart and Wright peaks, the big boys in the neighborhood. To the south, Baldy, Ear, Rocky.\n\nUnlike last week where I had to deal with some high Class 4 pitches of rock, this was straight Class 2 and a small amount of Class 3 walking.\n\nThe first third of the hike is the trail to Teton Pass up the West Fork of the Teton, Trail No. 114, which rises about 1,600 feet through fire and timber to a forested pass where Teton County meets Flathead County above the Bowl Creek country of the Bob Marshall Wilderness.\n\nWilderness sign at Teton Pass buried in snow\n\nThen, the off-trail climbing begins on a 5-mile ridge that crosses six \"peaks\" (in succession) of 7,730 feet, 8,250 (the high point) feet, 8093 feet, 8016 feet, 7893 feet, and 7,984 feet where it meets the Washboard Reef/Wrong Creek Trail No. 117. All of this is on the Continental Divide.\n\nThe final 6 miles is down the Washboard-Olney Creek Trail No. 117 as it merges back into Trail No. 114 and back to the West Fork trailhead.\n\nMark Hertenstein described the trail to the Teton Pass as like \"walking the Appalachian Trail\" because it was in the timber most the way. It hadn't been cleared yet by a trail crew and we saw grizzly, elk, moose, deer and mountain goat tracks in the copious mud in this stretch.\n\nHis adjective for the ridge walk was \"Glacieresque\" which is some compliment that I can't disagree with.\n\nThe only problem I encountered the entire walk was on the side of the high point where a large snow drift hung from its top down about 250 feet. Hertenstein found a good route where he could kick steps in the relatively stable snow for about 75 feet until he could reach more stable, exposed rock and walkable scree.\n\nThe ridge was carpeted in pink Douglasia and blue Forget-Me-Not flowers that created rock gardens in the limestone. I'm glad we didn't experience a predicted thunderstorm because the ridge was pocked with evidence of multiple lightning-strike-caused small fires. This ridge is a lightning target.\n\nAt 8,250 feet, this is the unnamed high point on the ridge\n\nThe day that had begun overcast turned bright blue on us and made the ridge walk all that much more glorious.\n\nEnormous cornices of snow hung beneath the ridge line all the way, forecasting stable stream flows for the rest of the summer. There were also vast fields of snow that Hertenstein could not resist \"skiing.\"\n\nThe trail back down Washboard Reef is not evident or easy to find. Hertenstein discovered it with his GPS, while I was perusing my topo maps.\n\nA cascade above Olney Creek off Washboard Reef\n\nThe first half-mile of the trail down the reef loses considerable altitude quickly and it was covered by a large drift, which we glissaded and boot kicked. This entire area was hit heavily by the 2007 Fool Creek fire, which burned hot and took everything. We didn't see much evidence of new trees, but there is lush growth in the area. The trail was difficult to follow because of the burn.\n\nAt the junction of Olney and the West Fork we had to wade high and fast water to return to Trail 114.\n\nOn the high point.\n\nOn the way back to the car I marveled at this country we had passed through. Yes, while on the ridge we were in \"designated\" wilderness, wilderness that had been approved by Congress. But, the entire West Fork below the ridge and that area just west of Mount Wright to the Continental Divide are roadless, but not designated. I'm told these areas were stripped out of a 1978 Bob Marshall Wilderness additions bill by former U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee.\n\nThese are included in the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Bill pending in Congress.\n\nSeems like a no-brainer to me!\n\nTeton Pass/Washboard Reef traverse route\n\n30 years later, a sweet walk up Mount Wright\n\nMy son, Demian, 37, atop Mount Wright last Thursday for the first time in 30 years.\n\nThe day before the Teton Pass-Washboard Reef walk, my son and I did a quick day hike up Mount Wright.\n\nThis is always a joy because of the terrific views this centrally located and high peak offers.\n\nIt occurred to me that the last time he had done this hike was in 1982 when he was 7-years-old! The hike is a 3,200 feet elevation gain.\n\nIt was very sweet to be able to do this with him 30 years later, sharing this northcentral Montana treasure.\n\nDemian, at age 7 in 1982, next to his Mom, his first time on Mount Wright.\n\nAn unnamed alpine lake beneath the high point on the Wood Lake Hogback in the Scapegoat Wilderness\n\n\"Hogback\" isn't the kind of mountain name that I find particularly attractive.\n\nYet, the hogback I walked on Friday is as pretty a place as you can imagine.\n\nIt's been in sight all these years as I've driven up the Benchmark Road out of Augusta. I've always made a mental note of this \"Wood Creek Hogback\" which starts with Crown Mountain and ends near the Benchmark Campground. This is a major ridge walk.\n\nWe walked a major section of it, making sure to hit the high points, with 7,977 feet the highest. We gained more than 3,700 feet of elevation along the way.\n\nJim and Mark working way through cliffs\n\nI don't think we could have found a more difficult way to get on top --- approaching it frontally through the cliffs. And, getting down wasn't all that much easier.\n\nI'm just not the climber I used to be. My balance is shot and I get dizzy fairly easily, so working my way up and down Class 4 cliffs is laborious and time consuming. Luckily, my climbing partners Mark Hertenstein and Jim Heckel are patient and helpful in getting me up and down. But, I see the handwriting on the wall and this kind of climbing will be in my past fairly soon.\n\nIt was my second time up the Benchmark Road in four days and serendipitously we started our way up across the road from where Katie and I had stopped to look at the Lick Creek Falls for the first time. While there I looked up and told her I'd like to try to get on the \"hogback.\"\n\nWhen offered as a possibility Friday, Hertenstein jumped at it.\n\nLots of snow all the way\n\nPatrol Mountain ridge and lookout was within view\n\nIt would have been an easy climb up for me if we had started up the ridge a mile or so to the north where the cliffs recede.\n\nLikewise, it would have been easier to descend further south down the ridge than where we did.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the hike was a discovery of an alpine lake just below the high point on the ridge.\n\nWalking the Wood Lake Hogback\n\nAt first I thought it might be the official Alpine Lake just north of Crown Mountain.\n\nBut, no, I had seen that lake from Crown before and it was nothing like this jewel beneath us.\n\nI rechecked the map and located a tiny, almost indecipherable spec of lake on it and figured that must be it.\n\nThe views from the ridgeline on this clear day were astounding with the Scapegoat Mountain massif and plateau dominating the southwestern horizon. Right in front of us to the west was the Patrol Mountain ridgeline, sharply defined by its many avalanche chutes. Straight Creek separates that ridge from the hogback we were walking.\n\nThere was plenty of snow on the hogback and the cornices were massively thick.\n\nOur Hogback walk route\n\nThe mountains to the west, deep in the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat are full of snow, portending good streamflows and (I hope) a late or non-existent fire season.\n\nOne of the big surprises came at the end of the hike about 600 feet above the road when we ran into an extremely deep and steep canyon that we had to down climb and then upclimb the adjacent slope.\n\nThe Scapegoat Mountain high country behind me to the west\n\nA Father's Day trip to Glacier\n\nThis moron from Wisconsin jumped into this rushing pool of frigid water in the pool beneath St. Mary's Falls. He's lucky to have survived the jump and swim.\n\nIn the water.\n\nKatie and I took a quick trip to Glacier National Park Saturday and Sunday, my first time in the park this spring.\n\nWe stayed at the Many Glacier Swiftcurrent cabins and did a series of day hikes.\n\nThe weather was extremely changeable and we got rained on several times.\n\nWe hit the St. Mary and Virginia Falls trail and Fishercap Lake the first day.\n\nOn Sunday it was Fishercap again hunting for moose and then a walk from the Jackson Overlook on the Going to the Sun Road to the Siyeh Bend, where a heavy rain forced us back. The Road is still closed, but we could have hiked all the way to Logan Pass if the rain hadn't been so heavy. We're told the pass will open this week.\n\nMount Jackson\n\nWe stopped at East Glacier Park and then went hunting for moose again at Bear Lake off Marias Pass, again coming up with nothing.\n\nThere is still tons of snow in the high country at Glacier, although some of the peaks near the Front in St. Mary's and Two Medicine look climbable.\n\nThere were very few trails open in the Many Glacier area because of bear and snow closures.\n\nWe saw a small grizzly wander through the campground at Many and another grizzly cross the road near Two Dog Flats at St. Mary.\n\nWayne Phillips at the spot where fire survivor Robert Sallee says he went through a crevice to the ridgeline and saved his life.\n\nIf you’re looking for a family day hike guided by a book that reads like a historical mystery try hiking Mann Gulch and reading Norman Maclean’s “Young Men and Fire.”\n\nThirteen smokejumpers died Aug. 5, 1949 in the gulch, located near Meriwether Picnic Area in the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness in the Helena National Forest.\n\nThe smokejumpers were dropped into Mann Gulch and died trying to outrun a fire that blew up on them.\n\nPicture Point on Mann Gulch.\n\nThe Mann Gulch fire is significant because it was the most tragic event in smokejumper history at that time and because a life-saving technique known as using a “back burn” came into standard practice because of the event. The fire boss on Mann Gulch was Wagner Dodge, who when seeing the fire approaching, lit a fire around him in the grass and stepped into its ashes and was saved because the larger fire had no fuel. Dodge had futilely tried to get his men to step into his backfire.\n\nFor years the Gates of the Mountains tour boats have swung by the mouth of the gulch several times a day during summer months recounting the catastrophe.\n\nMaclean’s book was published in 1992, two years after his death at age 87, and is an exhaustive account of the fire, detailing how the firefighters ran uphill, trying desperately to reach a ridge line several hundred feet above them to escape it.\n\nIn addition to Dodge, four others survived, but two of those died the next day. Only three reached the ridge line and one of those died from burns received before the ridge was reached.\n\nWhere smokejumper Eldon Diettert died.\n\nMaclean, who is probably better known as the author of the Montana classic, “A River Runs Through It,” was haunted by the deaths of the smokejumpers and returned to Mann Gulch into his late 80s, trying to recreate the chain of events that led to the fatalities.\n\nHe invited the two survivors who reached the ridge, Walt Rumsey and Robert Sallee, to show him where they attained the ridge (and safety) through a “crevice” in the quartzite and limestone rimrock that block the top.\n\nMaclean took the official fire reports and first-hand accounts from survivors, and did measurements with a hand held tap measure, and concluded that where Rumsey and Sallee say they hit the ridge was far east of where they did.\n\nAll this has a bearing on trying to corroborate Dodge’s account of events and whether his back burn rather than the main fire might have killed some of the smokejumpers.\n\nOn a hike Tuesday organized by H. Wayne Phillips of Great Falls, himself a former smokejumper, and two other former smokejumpers and one former paratrooper, the questions raised by Maclean’s book were examined and argued.\n\nMaclean's book was our true guide.\n\nAmong those points:\n\nWhere did Sallee and Rumsey crest the ridge?\n\n·Did we find the “crevice” that Sallee said is the correct one?\n\n·Did we find the “crevice” that Maclean claims?\n\n·Where was Sylvia’s rock (used as a certain measuring point for the back burn and ridge run)?\n\n·Where did Wag Dodge set his back burn (another crucial measuring point)?\n\n·Can we locate the grassy slope that Sallee and Rumsey used on the ridge before descending to the rock slide (and ultimate safety)\n\nPhillips stopped to leave some sweetgrass at several of the crosses marking the spots where the smokejumpers had died.\n\nProbably the most conventional route into this area is from the Meriwether Picnic Area reached by the Gates of the Mountains Tour Boat. A trail leads leads from the picnic area up and over the Meriwether-Mann Gulch divide.\n\nAnother route is again, by boat, and would dump the hiker at the bottom of Mann Gulch where it meets the Missouri River.\n\nAssessing where the drama occurred\n\nFinally, the route we took is an abandoned Forest Service Trail that rises from Willow Creek a couple of miles beyond the Willow Creek-Elkhorn turnoff in the Beartooth Game Range. About a quarter mile from the main Forest Service trail into Gates of the Mountains Wilderness Area a ridge comes down from the south and then it’s a couple of miles and 732 feet of elevation to Picture Point above Mann Gulch.\n\nJim Phillips, one of the smokejumpers on the trip, will help lead a group of retired smokejumpers and Montana Conservation Corps volunteers in the next couple of weeks restore that trail.\n\nThe big caveat about this area is that beyond that Willow Creek turnoff the road is as rough as it can be. I have a good all wheel drive Rav 4 with high clearance and I scraped bottom several times.\n\nWayne Phillips suggests a better route right up from that turnoff on a ridge that rises more than 1,000 feet to Picture Point ---- but there is no trail.\n\nI think this would be the best route in and you would save lots of wear and tear on your car.\n\nI highly recommend Helena science teacher Rod Benson's virtual tour Web site as another guide if you're planning to make this trip: http://formontana.net/gulch.html\n\nStory I did for the Great Falls Tribune Aug. 6, 1978\n\nTwo different routes to the same place. The refurbished hiking trail is to the right in this map. Wayne Phillips' off-trail route is to the left. Wayne's route would allow the hiker to bypass the extremely poor road where the road crosses Elkhorn Creek and proceeds up Willow Creek.\n\nA quick run into the Scapegoat Wilderness Area\n\nThe pack bridge over the South Fork of Sun River at Benchmark.\n\nOn Tuesday my wife and I took a quick recon trip into the Benchmark area and walked a couple of miles of the South Fork Sun River Trail into the Scapegoat Wilderness Area.\n\nThe short day hike renewed my enthusiasm for this area when you don’t have much time.\n\nIt is a quick way into the wilderness and there’s plenty of good scenery to be had. Some of the trail was pointed directly at the Patrol Mountain cabin, where there is still some snow.\n\nOn the way out we spotted a waterfall on what appears to be Lick Creek a mile or two above Wood Lake.\n\nI’ve driven this road numerous times but have never noticed that fall before.\n\nA waterfall we discovered Lick Creek Falls off the Benchmark Road above Wood Lake.\n\nThe route along the ridgeline\n\nThe weather was so unsettled this weekend I wanted to stay close to home for my hikes.\n\nAlthough I've been in the Highwoods lots this spring I thought that Arrow Peak at 7,485 feet and the second highest peak in the range might be something worth doing again. If the weather changed, it wouldn't take too much to abort the trip.\n\nWe had been on the Arrow ridge a little over a year ago while skiing, climbing Lava Peak (7,142 feet) along the way.\n\nWe had reached this peak by skiing a ridge from the Highwood-Arrow Creek divide. We can in from the Geyser side of the range, using the Scion Kop access off Montana 200 east of Raynesford. This is the area where a large wind farm is under construction.\n\nWe wanted to try it as a hike and extend it to Arrow Peak.\n\nVolcanic outcroppings on ridge line\n\nIt worked out marvelously and the weather cooperated nicely.\n\nThis is really a wild section of this isolated mountain range where taking the wrong turn can plunge the hiker into a remote drainage that never seems to end.\n\nThat's something that happened to us on the way down, adding some mileage and elevation to the hike.\n\nThe straight-forward hike gains about 2,500 feet if both peaks are climbed.\n\nThe views from on top Arrow are exceptional, with the Bear's Paw, Little Rockies, Sweetgrass Hills, Little Belts, Big Belts, Judiths, Snowies mountain ranges and Rocky Mountain Front in clear view.\n\nThe stretch from Lave to Arrow is a gorgeous, open ridge walk punctuated by volcanic outcroppings.\n\nIt is extraordinarily green this spring because of all the rain the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe red line is our up route; the blue line, where we got lost"
