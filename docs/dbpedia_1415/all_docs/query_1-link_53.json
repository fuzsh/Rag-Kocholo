Mr. Clinton's chances were hurt by his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Alaskans overwhelmingly favor.\n\nSenator Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican, turned a notable financial advantage into an easy victory over the Democrat, Tony Smith. The Republican Representative, Don Young, held off a challenge from John S. Devens, a Democrat.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\n92% reporting\n\nBush...72,264...41%\n\nClinton...57,264...32%\n\nPerot...50,634...28%\n\nSENATE\n\n92% reporting\n\nMurkowski (R)...96,8656 53%\n\nSmith (D)...69,862...38% ARIZONA - BUSH\n\nDevastated by the savings-and-loan scandal and plummeting commercial and residential real-estate market, this solidly Republican state gave George Bush the jitters. The President only narrowly won the eight electoral votes in Arizona, which has voted Republican in every Presidential race since 1952.\n\nAlthough Senator John McCain, a war hero and first-term Republican, was tarnished as one of the five Senators who intervened on behalf of Charles Keating, the jailed savings-and-loan operator, he handily defeated Claire Sargent, a Democrat who has been active in civic affairs.\n\nMr. McCain also beat former Gov. Evan Meacham, a Republican best known for his opposition to a state holiday celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Voters also approved the King holiday in a referendum on Tuesday.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
