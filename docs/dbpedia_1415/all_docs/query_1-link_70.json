        "text": "First of Two\n\nBetter than you\n\nMember # 16\n\nposted I couldn't believe this one when I heard it, but there it is in black and white...\n\nhttp://www.billingsgazette.com/index.php?tts=1&display=rednews/2002/10/10/build/local/50-taylor-bails.inc\n\nquote:\n\nState Sen. Mike Taylor, Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, will withdraw from the race this afternoon, saying a Montana Democratic Party television ad has destroyed his campaign.\n\nTaylor, who has scheduled a press conference in Helena for 2 p.m., said the ad, which he said insinuated that he was a gay hairdresser, had pushed his poll numbers through the floor\n\nquote:What incensed Taylor was the film clip accompanying the ad. Taylor had a twice weekly segment in the early 1980s on a Denver television station. The clip shows Taylor applying lotions to the face of a man siting in the barber chair and discussing techniques. The ad shows Taylor, then slender, sporting a full beard. He is wearing a tight-fitting, three piece suit, with a big-collared open shirt ala John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Taylor's top two or three shirt buttons are unbuttoned, exposing some bare chest and a number of gold chains\n\nquote:\n\nState Sen. Ken Toole, D-Helena, and program director for the Montana Human Rights Network, said Thursday morning the ad \"is an overt and obvious appeal to the homophobic (voter) that is playing to that stereotypic imagery.\"\n\nToole, who has fought for homosexual rights for years in the Montana Legislature, said he had complained to the state Democratic Party.\n\nToole said the Democratic response was that the image was not intended to imply that Taylor was gay.\n\n\"It is hard to believe their advertising firm did not see it,\" Toole said. \"Bottom line is it is obvious and it ought to be pulled.\n\n\"Once you play these cards, inject this crap into a campaign - race, gay - nobody controls it,\" Toole said.\n\nquote:\n\nDan DuBray, a former Montana television journalist who did campaign ads for former U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., said Thursday the ad was as subtle as \"a 2x4 across the forehead. The video was clearly designed to send a subliminal message about Mike Taylor's sexuality.\"\n\n\"It is bizarre,\" DuBray said. \"I can't believe the senator would embrace this type of ad. The process is out of control. This is far below the floor of any TV ads in the past.\"\n\nAnd now the cool part... a turnabout of New Jersey?\n\nquote:Unconfirmed rumors have Taylor being replaced by former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who is now chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nWho, I'm told, is very popular in Montana and might be able to win the day. Wouldn't THAT be ironic?\n\nMontana has the same law as NJ. If the Democrats object, the Supreme Court may be forced to hear the case.\n\n--------------------\n\n\"The best defense is not a good offense. The best defense is a terrifyingly accurate and devastatingly powerful offense, with multiply-overlapping kill zones and time-on-target artillery strikes.\" -- Laurence, Archangel of the Sword\n\nRegistered: Mar 1999 | IP: Logged"
