        "text": "Practical tips relating to the rights to use images\n\nIf you would like to create images of people or groups that represent the university then you should first seek the required written consent from the person(s) to be depicted in accordance to privacy rights.\n\nWhat should you consider when taking photographs?\n\nDetails that should be covered in the written consent form:\n\nType of media or image material to be used\n\nLength of time media or material is to be used\n\nType of use or application\n\nCompensation\n\nPermission to use the name(s) of the depicted person(s)\n\nPermission from the next of kin up until ten years after the death of the depicted person(s) is required in order to use the image material.\n\nIf you would like to take photos of events, please notify the event organizers prior to the event taking place. Furthermore, you might also have to request and be granted individual consent from participants.\n\nIf you are going to take pictures of minors, you should first seek parental consent.\n\nIf you would like to use, reproduce or publish image material on behalf of the university, you should seek, in accordance to copyright law, the consent and rights to use the images from the photographer.\n\nWhat should you keep in mind as an authorised user?\n\nDetails that should be covered in the written consent form:\n\nLength of time media or material is to be used\n\nType of use or application\n\nEditing rights, e.g. converting colour photos to black and white images\n\nCompensation or free use\n\nRight to be named as creator (last name, first name etc.)\n\nSeventy years after the death of the image creator, images may be used without prior consent.\n\nAfter receiving the user rights, you may use the image material for fifty years unless otherwise agreed.\n\nCopyright law\n\nPhotos are protected through copyright law. It does not matter who created the photos or for what purpose they were taken: The same legal protections apply to both artistically valuable photographic material and normal photos.\n\nPlease use photos and videos on your website only if you have the right to do so. It is not enough to state the origin, but the owner must explicitly have permitted the use of the photo/video. It is possible that the owner insists on indicating the copyright."
