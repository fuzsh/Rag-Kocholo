        "text": "This panel helped inaugurate the opening of the new campus for the Yale School of Management on January 10, 2014. The audience consisted of Yale students, faculty, alumni and donors, together with 24 schools around the world that constitute the Global Network of business schools established by Yale in 2012 and 2013.\n\nModerator\n\nJeffrey E. Garten\n\nJuan Trippe Professor in the Practice of International Trade, Finance, and Business, Yale School of Management\n\nFormer U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade\n\nPanelists\n\nRoger Altman\n\nFounder and Executive Chairman, Evercore\n\nFormer Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury\n\nSheila C. Bair\n\nSenior Advisor, The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nFormer Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n\nGary Gensler\n\nFormer Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n\nRobert E. Rubin LAW '64\n\nCo-Chairman, Council on Foreign Relations\n\nFormer Secretary of the U.S. Treasury\n\nPaul A. Volcker\n\nFormer Chairman of the Federal Reserve\n\nRobert B. Zoellick\n\nDistinguished Visiting Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics\n\nFormer President of the World Bank Group\n\nWill the world be able to build the low-carbon infrastructure that is so critical to ours and future generations? Will the billions of new entrants into the global middle class have access to the goods and services they will demand? Will countless men and women living in poverty have the opportunity to lift themselves out? Will there be enough jobs? Financial security for the aging population around the world? Fewer destructive financial crises that set back hundreds of millions of lives, sometimes irrevocably and forever? One way or another, these and many of the other biggest questions of our time are linked to the global financial system, its efficiency, its fairness and its stability.\n\nThe problem is that although this system, established after World War II, served the world reasonably well for 50 years, it is now under great strain. For the last few decades, it has proved to be crisis prone, each successive breakdown being deeper, more global, and more destructive than the last. The global financial system has now become so big, so interconnected, and so technically complex that experts disagree as to whether it is overregulated, underregulated, or regulated in a totally ineffective way—or some of each. The key banking institutions are increasingly short-term oriented in a world crying for longer-term investment. The U.S. and the dollar—lynchpins of the system—can no longer play the central role they once did. The international institutions reflect governance arrangements that stem from the 1950s; to maintain their political legitimacy and authority, they are in desperate need for more involvement and direction from emerging market nations.\n\nAll this raises the question of what should be done over the next decade or so to strengthen global finance. That is the subject of this distinguished panel, which will look at the big challenges facing the system and offer ideas for improving it.\n\nBiographies\n\nJeffrey E. Garten\n\nJuan Trippe Professor in the Practice of International Trade, Finance, and Business, Yale School of Management\n\nFormer U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade\n\nJeffrey E. Garten is the Juan Trippe Professor in the Practice of International Trade, Finance, and Business and former dean (1996-2005.)

He remained in that position until the firm was sold to American Express.\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Altman joined The Blackstone Group as Vice Chairman, head of the firm’s advisory business and a member of its Investment Committee.\n\nBeginning in January 1993, Mr. Altman returned to Washington to serve as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for two years.

Bair served as Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during one of the nation’s most turbulent economic eras in history. With the collapse and upheaval of U.S. and global markets as well as venerable financial institutions, Chairman Bair worked diligently both in front of and behind the scenes to bolster public confidence and financial system stability. Her extraordinary efforts and relentless dedication established her as an ardent advocate and innovator of policies to end the doctrine of too-big-to-fail and taxpayer bailouts.\n\nChairman Bair has been lauded for her fierce advocacy of the public interest in articles and editorials in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, Financial Times, and the New Yorker. As Time Magazine aptly stated in selecting her as one of its 100 most influential people, she has served as “the little guy’s protector in chief.” Additionally, Chairman Bair has received numerous honors and accolades for her pioneering work including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and twice being named by Forbes Magazine as the second most powerful woman in the world after Germany’s Angela Merkel.\n\nTOP\n\nGary Gensler\n\nFormer Chairman\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission\n\nGary Gensler was sworn in as the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on May 26, 2009.

He subsequently served as a Senior Advisor to the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes, on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reforming corporate responsibility, accounting and securities laws.\n\nAs Under Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman Gensler was the principal advisor to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and later to Secretary Lawrence Summers on all aspects of domestic finance. The office was responsible for formulating policy and legislation in the areas of U.S. financial markets, public debt management, the banking system, financial services, fiscal affairs, federal lending, Government Sponsored Enterprises, and community development. In recognition of this service, he was awarded Treasury’s highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award.\n\nPrior to joining Treasury, Chairman Gensler worked for 18 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was selected as a partner; in his last role he was Co-head of Finance.\n\nChairman Gensler is the co-author of a book, The Great Mutual Fund Trap, which presents common sense investment advice for middle income Americans.\n\nHe is a summa cum laude graduate from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in 1978, with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and received a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School’s graduate division in 1979. He lives with his three daughters outside of Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nTOP\n\nRobert E. Rubin LAW '64\n\nCo-Chairman, Council on Foreign Relations\n\nFormer Secretary of the U.S. Treasury\n\nRobert E. Rubin served as our nation’s 70th Secretary of the Treasury from January 10, 1995 until July 2, 1999. He joined the Clinton Administration in 1993, serving in the White House as Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and as the first Director of the National Economic Council. He joined Goldman, Sachs & Company in 1966 and served as Co-Chairman from 1990 to 1992. From 1999 to 2009, Mr. Rubin served as a member of the Board of Directors at Citigroup and as a senior advisor to the company. In 2010, he joined Centerview Partners as counselor of the firm. He is Chairman of the Board of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), the nation’s leading community development support organization. He serves on the Board of Trustees of Mount Sinai Medical Center and is a member of the Harvard Corporation. In June 2007, he was named Co-Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Rubin was one of the founders of The Hamilton Project, an economic policy project housed at the Brookings Institution that offers a strategic vision and innovative policy proposals on how to create a growing economy that benefits more Americans. He is author of In An Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington [Random House, 2003, with Jacob Weisberg], a New York Times bestseller and one of Business Week's ten best business books of the year.\n\nMr. Rubin graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in 1960 with an A.B. in economics. He received a L.L.B. from Yale Law School in 1964 and attended the London School of Economics. He has received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Columbia and other universities.\n\nTOP\n\nPaul A. Volcker\n\nFormer Chairman of the Federal Reserve\n\nIn the course of his career, Mr. Volcker worked in the United States Federal Government for almost 30 years, culminating in two terms as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1979-1987, a critical period in bringing a high level of inflation to an end. In earlier stages of his career, Mr. Volcker served as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs during the early 1970’s, a period of historic change in international monetary arrangements. He was subsequently President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and in earlier years was an official of The Chase Manhattan Bank.\n\nMr. Volcker retired as Chairman of Wolfensohn & Co. upon the merger of that firm with Bankers Trust. From 1996-1999, Mr. Volcker headed The Independent Committee of Eminent Persons, formed by Swiss and Jewish organizations to investigate deposit accounts and other assets in Swiss banks of victims of Nazi persecution and to arrange for their disposition. From 2000 – 2005 Mr. Volcker served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the newly formed International Accounting Standards Committee overseeing a renewed effort to develop consistent, high-quality accounting standards acceptable in all countries. Upon leaving public service in 1987, and again in 2003, he headed private, non-partisan Commissions on the Public Service, each recommending a sweeping overhaul of the organization and personnel practices of the United States Federal Government.\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Volcker was asked by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to chair the Independent Inquiry into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program, resulting in identification of substantial corruption and malfeasance. In 2007, Mr. Volcker was asked by the President of the World Bank to chair a panel of experts to review the operations of the Department of Institutional Integrity. That effort has culminated in broad reform of the Bank’s anti-corruption effort. In November 2008, President Elect Obama chose Mr. Volcker to head the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board which ended in Feb. 2011.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Volcker launched the Volcker Alliance to address the challenge of effective execution of public policies and to help rebuild trust in government. As a nonpartisan, non-profit organization based in New York City, the Volcker Alliance aims to catalyze new thinking and action with respect to federal, state, and local government in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nEducated at Princeton, Harvard and the London School of Economics, Mr. Volcker is a recipient of honorary doctorates from each of his “alma maters”, as well as a number of other American and foreign universities.\n\nTOP\n\nRobert B.
