        "text": "The International Political Economy and Development (IPED) Program at Fordham University hosts a weekly lecture series. Guests from the non-profit, public, and private sectors present on topics of interest to both graduate students in the IPED Program as well as to students in various departments across the university. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, IPED also hosted Virtual Career Sessions to connect current students with alumni working in various sectors across the globe.\n\nFebruary 22nd, 2024\n\nDecoding Pakistan: Elections 2024\n\n2024 IPED alumni Aliyah Sahqani gave a wonderful and engaging presentation about the elections in Pakistan and populist leader Imran Khan. During his time in power, Khan was very pro western cooperation. However, in recent years, Pakistan has shifted its international alliances towards Russia and China. Not many people in Pakistan seek to rule the country as it is a very unstable position due to the numerous provincial conflicts in language, rights, and wealth distribution. The establishment, which is composed primarily of Pakistani military forces, is consolidated in the northeastern province, and holds the majority of centralized political power. Only the future can tell how the political situation in Pakistan will unwind.\n\nFebruary 15th, 2024\n\nTransitioning to the International Development Sector as a Young Professional\n\nIPED welcomed 2015 IPED alumni Gabriel Rossi. He currently works with Catholic Relief Services within the business development team and designs development projects that eventually get implemented in developing countries all over the world. Catholic Relief Services is one of the most well-known US and international humanitarian aid and development organizations. Rossi discussed the career preparation and transition process that young professionals go to as well as the application process for the CRS International Development Fellowship Program. He also discussed internal structure and career opportunities within CRS.\n\nFebruary 1st, 2024\n\nProject Assessments in the Philippines\n\nThis week, the IPED cohort learned about what their fellow classmates were up to in the Philippines. Ginny, Angel, Siphesihle, Thabiso, Amanda, Fatema, and Genevieve spent a 4 day immersion in Calawis, a rural farming village in Antipolo, Rizal Province of the Philippines where they met, spent time with, and learned about the local community. The community is also home to a small non-profit organization called Tulungan sa Kabuhayan ng Calawis (TSKC) dedicated to environmental protection and conservation through various programs. The IPED group split into two teams; one worked on the TSKC reforestation project and one worked on the business and enterprise development program involving ginger turmeric tea production. While conducting interviews, participating in reforestation and tea production activities, and getting to experience the daily lives of the locals, the two teams were able to conduct an evaluation assessment on the current situation of the two TSKC projects.\n\nJanuary 25th, 2024\n\nEdible Economics\n\nFor the first IPED lecture of the 2024 year, Dr. Ha-Joon Chang joined us and presented his most recent book, Edible Economics. Each chapter features a different food item either relating to the content of that chapter or simply because it is a Dr. Chang favorite. His philosophy for his book is that the recipe for a more democratic brand of capitalism is incomplete without understanding economics. However, as economics can be a highly technical subject, Dr. Chang introduces us to it in the same way that we would be drawn to a particular dish on a menu that might pique our interest.\n\nGlobally recognized author and advisor to various international organizations and governments, Ha-Joon Chang has worked on a wide range of issues related to economic development, especially trade and industrial policies, productive capabilities development, institutions and development, global economic system, the history of economic development in today’s rich countries, and the political economy of development.\n\nDecember 7th, 2023\n\nEconomics in Forecasting and National Security\n\nMichael Gordon is Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Economics on the National Intelligence Council (NIC) in Washington, DC. The NIC is part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and produces strategic assessments for policymakers. A few years back, Michael was a national security fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, and prior to his intelligence work, he worked in New York as an editor with the Economist Intelligence Unit, specializing in commercial and financial topics of the Middle East, and lectured at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs. He is an IPED class of 1998, and holds several professional certificates in financial markets.\n\nHis lecture elaborated on the necessity to bridge together knowledge bases from a variety of different subjects and unlikely disciplines as a means of producing creative and detailed solutions and explanations for current economic problems as well as how to approach forecasting future potential problems and challenges.\n\nNovember 16th, 2023\n\nIntegral Human Evaluation: Enacting Dignity in Policy and Practice\n\nFlying in all the way from Notre Dame, the IPED program welcomed Paul Perrin, an expert in development research and leader of Pulte Institute’s Evidence and Learning Division. He led an engaging discussion about the gap between development projects based on material needs for survival and the intangible aspects of what makes someone feel human. For many development organizations and aid efforts, there is less of an emphasis on providing people in need with the space and agency for growth and making their own decisions about how to take control of their own lives in a dignified and respected manner. Paul went on to elaborate the underlying issues associated with aid efforts, including but not limited to infantilization and saviorism.\n\nPaul is a jack of all trades with extensive experience and over a decade’s worth of expertise working in the public, private, and non-profit sectors with organizations such as the US Agency for International Development, Catholic Relief Services, and in academia.\n\nOctober 26th, 2023\n\nThe World’s Wicked Problems\n\nThis week, IPED welcomed Gabelli School of Business alumni Peter Lupoff. His presentation took us on a deep dive into the various global problems that plague our world today, such as environmental degradation, climate change, etc. and how the intersections of all these problems create a space for impact investing to contribute towards developmental solutions.\n\nPeter is the Founder and Principal of Lupoff/Stevens Family Office, his family’s vehicle for direct and third party impact investments, as well as other grant-making, advisory, research, teaching and writing activities. Formerly, he was the CEO of both Net Impact (2019-2022) and GOOD Institute (2021-2022). Peter is a Gabelli Fellow at Fordham University. He was Fordham Gabelli School of Business, Executive in Residence (2018-19). Today, he continues to teach impact investing at Fordham and is a Member of the Impact Investing & Sustainable Finance Faculty Consortium.\n\nOctober 19th, 2023\n\nHealth and Development: A Functional Approach\n\nThis week, IPED welcomed one of Fordham’s very own beloved faculty members of the Economics Department, Dr. Sophie Mitra. Dr. Mitra is an expert professor and researcher on disabilities, ageism, and discrimination, and how various health measures correlate to poverty indicators. Her lecture featured functional disabilities, the distribution of them alongside the distribution of poverty and inequality, and the issues that individuals and countries face in approaching development. There is a long-standing trend where those with disabilities often get overlooked or left out in not only everyday life, but in development policy and infrastructural and social welfare development.\n\nOctober 18th, 2023\n\nUkraine at the United Nations\n\nIPED hosted a very special visitor on a Wednesday afternoon. The UN ambassador for Ukraine Sergiy Kyslytsya came for a lunch followed by a moderated discussion covering a variety of relevant past and present topics. He discussed Ukrainian and Russian relations within the UN as well as the functioning of multilateral government organizations such as the UN and how they fit into peace building, diplomacy, and global security. Ambassador Kyslytsya also told stories of his own life and the process of eventually making a career in foreign service. The audience consisted of undergraduate students, graduate students, and Fordham faculty.\n\nOctober 12th, 2023\n\nSaviors vs. Liberators: The Historical Debate\n\nThe IPED program was joined by the renowned Dr. William Easterly for a special guest lecture on the ideologies surrounding neo-colonial approaches to development through aid. He gave a brief timeline on various instances of saviorism propaganda and how it intentionally elicits an emotional reaction to images of poverty. He touched on the inefficiency of such attitudes and how in these cases, aid and the imagery through which it is marketed can deter development. Countries that have no control over how they are presented in the global media and in the development narrative lose an important aspect of development itself, which would be the power to emphasize not only sources of pity but of where there has been success and meaningful progress. Dr. Easterly argued the importance of dignity and the imperative need for each country to have autonomy over it so that it can be taken seriously and respectfully as a global competitor with something to bring to the table. Wrapping it all together, Dr. Easterly reiterated his long standing theory of how markets and trade hold a higher significance in growth than aid, especially ineffective and wasteful aid, does.\n\nOctober 2nd, 2023\n\nCorruption and Development in the Philippines – Special IPED Event\n\nOn this lovely fall day, the IPED Program had the privilege and pleasure of hosting former Senator of the Philippines, Bam Aquino. Senator Aquino presented on the compounded issues in development today in the Philippines given a complex and systemic set of socio-political problems of the past. In addition to a centralized political body that perpetuates wealth disparities, he also elaborated on the rhetoric of propaganda machines and vote buying. However, with a unified dynamism of both young generations and old who continue striving for a better future, change is possible. To succeed in positive development, it takes savvy, guts, and the unrelenting spirit of perseverance.\n\nPaolo Benigno Aguirre “Bam” Aquino IV is the youngest former senator in Philippine history. As senator, he served on numerous congressional committees and helped pass laws uplifting youth education, microfinance, people with disabilities, and many other relevant and meaningful causes. Currently, he is a Maurice R. Greenberg World Fellow at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.\n\nSeptember 29th, 2023\n\nUNA-NYC Summer Scholars 2023 Special Panel\n\nSponsored by the United Nations Association, the IPED program tuned in on a Zoom event featuring 6 summer scholars who worked in United Nations Development Program (UNDP) placements all around the world. Four of our very own IPED students, Nozipho, Saujan, Mmafatse, and Lalash, spoke about their experiences in Eswatini, Mongolia, Indonesia, and Suriname respectively. The panel also welcomed two students from the Columbia SIPA program who worked in Laos and the Philippines. They all presented on the experiences and challenges of working on development projects and living overseas.\n\nSeptember 7th, 2023\n\nSummer Internships, Vol. I\n\nIPED welcomed back the 2024 cohort after a busy summer of work, travel, and building professional development skills. Their internships brought them all around the globe and to a variety of different opportunities. Harrison worked with the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Marian interned with St. Andrew’s for Refugee Services in Cairo, Egypt. Stephanie interned with the Foreign Agricultural Service in Washington D.C. Evan worked for Purplely and got to get the most out of the bustling New York City. Last but not least, Alexander, Babalwa, and Kendall all pursued language study and were placed in various cities in France. Apart from engaging in organizations that offered insight into possible career fields, the students got to experience and enjoy the cultural communities of their respective cities.\n\n2022-2023 Lecture Series\n\nApril 27th, 2023\n\nIPED Reports from the Field (Democractic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, and Rwanda)\n\nIPED welcomed three IPED Alumni and Travel Scholar Recipients (Sean Grossnickle, Nicole Alcantar and Maria Hincapie) who are currently on a six months internship with the Catholic Relief Services in the DRC, Tanzania, and Rwanda, respectively. The alumni provided the current IPED cohort with a detailed overview of their daily roles and responsibilities in their placement country and the overall mission of the CFR projects within the respective countries. The alumni also provided a brief overview of their adventures while serving their internships.\n\nApril 20th, 2023\n\nBanking Crisis – Silicon Valley\n\nDr Mary Burke was welcomed by IPED to present on the current state and impact of banking crisis in Silicon Valley on the US economy.
