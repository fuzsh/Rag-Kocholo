        "text": "To all Nigerians: The fundamental question here is: how relevant are our universities globally in terms of research and development (R&D) programs? How are Nigerian Universities leading R&D and churning out high value patents fostering innovation and industrialization? In January, 2024, Federal government approved 683 billion naira as intervention for tertiary institutions, the TETFund How do we ensure that the large chunks of these funds do not go into building project and if they are going there, how justifiable are they? What happens when built and there are no equipments to conduct research? Or itâ€™s going to be classrooms with nonfunctional electronics and electrical equipments after few years? How does government measure the impacts of TETfund both on short and long term basis. If we are not seeing the impact of the TETfund, is not time we reevaluate and address the areas of concerns and scale up? Afterall TETfund budget is less than 0.2% of GDP in terms of R&D when compared to an average of 2.5 % OECD Please think about this and share these critical points. #TETFUNDS, #innovation #industrialisation\n\nI was at my alma mater, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, to deliver a public lecture on The Challenges of Quality Higher Education in Africa as part of Diamond Jubilee anniversary. It was nostalgic. An opportunity to share on a topic that is after my heart and to network with new generations of academics that have come through the more than a decadeâ€™s MacArthur Foundations investment in higher education in Nigeria - 4 universities (ABU, Zaria, BUK, Kano, UI, Ibadan and UniPort, Port Harcourt); 268 Ph.D. and 222 MA/MSc beneficiaries and 310 non-academic staff. Higher education is a critical part of Africaâ€™s pathway to the Africa that Africans urgently crave. The post-colonial governments conceptualized universities as a national project symbolizing the aspirations of independence and national development. We must return to that vision if we want higher quality education. Government must take a higher responsibility. In Nigeria, the increase in the number of universities is phenomenal: 270 as of December 2023 from one in 1960 and six in 1970. Currently, there are 52 federal universities, 63 state universities and 147 private universities. Despite the high number of private universities, the number of students in these universities is less than 10 percent of those in the public universities.\n\nFor the past three months, I've been painting a vivid picture of my vision to friends, family, and partners. It's a vision of 20 ambassadors across 20 universities, crafting leadership hubs, and championing the ethos of Becoming Intentional. Our aim? To distribute thousands of copies of \"Becoming Intentional\" in Nigerian universities within six months and equip these ambassadors with skills that will fortify their careers. They'll be guided by mentors who'll help sketch out their clear 5-year career paths, ensuring they emerge from this journey not only with a defined career trajectory but also enriched with community engagement experience, a letter of recommendation, and a mentor by their side. I must admit, initially, my chant of \"20 ambassadors in 20 different campuses\" seemed like a broken record. The first time I uttered it, I couldn't even afford to print more than ten books for distribution. Yet, as I repeated it, something shifted. It went from a mere utterance to a belief, and eventually, a conviction. Now, it's a resounding declaration made with unwavering confidence. Yesterday marked the inception of the realization of this vision. We proudly introduced 23 exceptional Becoming Intentional campus ambassadors, representing 18 different campuses across five out of six of Nigeria's geopolitical zones. It was a moment that resonated with the unmistakable aura of success. As they shared their inspirations for applying for this opportunity during our call, it struck me as surreal. After three months of fervent hope and prayer, to finally meet them in the flesh was nothing short of miraculous. This, to me, encapsulates the essence of success - the transformation of vision into reality. It's a sentiment you can't simply purchase off the shelves. Yet, there's a broader canvas here - nation-building. The strength of a chain lies in its weakest link. With 70% of Nigeria's population comprising young individuals below the age of 30, we can't afford for them to be the vulnerable link. Investing in this dynamic demographic is not a choice; it's an imperative. We recently deliberated on whether our educational institutions are adequately priming our youth for careers brimming with purpose and contributions that resonate with society. The consensus was clear - there's a critical need to supplement the prevailing educational framework in most higher institutions in Nigeria. For me, BICAP embodies a concrete commitment. It's where I'm channelling not only my efforts but also my resources and finances into a cause I've advocated for over the years. It's my contribution to shaping a generation of intentional leaders who'll architect a brighter, purpose-driven Nigeria. ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ #BecomingIntentional #NationBuilding"
