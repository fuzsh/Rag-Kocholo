        "text": "Associated Press\n\nST. PAUL — Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is being honored by his alma mater with a life-sized bust at Macalester College’s new international studies center.\n\nHe told a small crowd at the St. Paul liberal arts college that it was great to be back. He spoke Wednesday in the entryway of the Institute for Global Citizenship.\n\nHe says he was initially cool to the idea of a bust because it seems like something that’s done for people who have died. But he’s pleased with the result and the mission of the institute.\n\nHe says the world is now a global village and no one can think purely in local terms. With that in mind, he said, he’s sure the institute will train future leaders.\n\nAnnan retired from the U.N. in 2006. He lives in Geneva and serves as a mediator and advocate for Africa."
