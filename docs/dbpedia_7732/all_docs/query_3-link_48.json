        "text": "Every year, the Geneva Graduate Institute invites policy and practice partners to bid for a group of second-year Masters students to undertake Applied Research Projects (ARPs) on their behalf. ARPs involve small student groups working together to conduct policy-relevant research with partner organisations on issues relating to international development and international relations.\n\nApplications will be accepted until 19 September for projects that will kick-off late October and end in June 2024.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nApplied Research Projects (ARPs) are a foundational component of the MINT programme. ARPs involve small student groups working together to conduct policy-relevant research with partner organisations on issues relating to international development and international relations.\n\nThrough ARPs, students learn and apply analytical and research skills to practical and policy-relevant issues in international relations and development. Students work with autonomy and professionalism under the supervision of a team of Graduate Institute faculty.\n\nOver the course of the ARP, students are expected to:\n\nelaborate project Terms of Reference and frame appropriate research questions;\n\nconduct in-depth literature reviews and design relevant methodologies;\n\nundertake original research;\n\nanalyze primary data;\n\nwrite analytic preliminary and final reports; and\n\npresent final research findings in a public forum.\n\nTeamwork, collaboration, professionalism, effective communication, and problem solving are crucial skills that the ARP process aims to teach students.\n\nPARTNER ORGANIZATIONS\n\nOrganizations working on issues of global concern are invited to submit applications to commission ARPs. ARP Partner Organizations are expected to provide guidance and support to the students to generate research that is of policy and practical relevance. The process for partner selection is competitive, and based on a proposal that describes the desired research project, including research objectives, questions and methodologies to be used. Successful applicants demonstrate a commitment to supporting students across the project period, including through the provision of technical expertise, supporting the students’ professional learning, and helping students connect with other leading experts in the relevant field of practice.\n\nPartner organisations are expected to:\n\nprovide overall framing of the research project;\n\nparticipate in approximately 4 meetings with the students across the project period;\n\nattend the final presentation; and\n\nprovide feedback on and validate the students’ deliverables—including the Terms of Reference, Literature Review and Methodology, and the Preliminary and Final Reports.\n\nStudents will begin working on the ARP in mid-October 2023 and should complete their projects in June 2024.\n\nOrganisations interested in applying to become ARP Partners for the 2023-2024 cohort are invited to complete this ARP Partner Application Form by 19 September 2023. Organizations which pass through the first stage of screening will be contacted by the end of September 2023. Selected organisations will be asked to adhere to the Geneva Graduate Institute’s Code of Conduct and to sign a partnership agreement."
