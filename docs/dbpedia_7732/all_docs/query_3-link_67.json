        "text": "Forge new and more effective paths toward sustainable development.\n\nThe Master of Development Practice (MDP) is a 21-month practice-oriented STEM-designated program in sustainable development. Combining the academic excellence and social relevance of UC Berkeley with peer learning and experiential learning, the UC Berkeley MDP draws on its location in the Bay Area, the global center of technology and innovation to cultivate leaders and changemakers in the field of sustainable development.\n\nThe UC Berkeley MDP is part of the MDP Global Association, which is a network of over 30 MDP programs globally, and the SDG Academy through the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UNSDN). The SDG Academy and the UNSDSN reflect the belief that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires an investment in interdisciplinary academic training combined with practical experience to address development challenges and opportunities.\n\nAs part of the Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP), the Berkeley MDP uniquely benefits not only from the tech ecosystem of the Bay Area, but also other departments at Berkeley, such as the College of Natural Resources, the Haas School of Business, and the School of Public Health, among others. The UC Berkeley MDP draws on the expertise of the UC Berkeley Graduate Group on Development Practice and the MDP Executive Committee, composed of faculty from across these departments to reflect on sustainable development education and explore cross-campus synergies.\n\nThe development landscape is always emerging and evolving, and while many of our graduates are at the leading global development organizations and in national and local government, many others work in impact investing, in corporate social responsibility, in product innovation, and in tech, as well as start their own organizations, from NGOs to startups. Berkeley MDP students benefit from the expertise of GSPP career services, which has experience in development practice. As the MDP is a stem-oriented degree, international students are able to apply for an additional 24 months of Optional Practical Training (OPT) after their first year of optional practical training, for a total of three years.\n\nThe Program\n\nThe MDP consists of a core curriculum, a summer internship after the first year, a second-year capstone project, and electives chosen from GSPP and across GSPP."
