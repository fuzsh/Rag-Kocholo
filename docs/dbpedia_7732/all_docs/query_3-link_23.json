        "text": "The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies is recruiting a Postdoctoral Researcher for SNF funded project “Accounting for Nature: Agriculture and Mitigation in the Era of Global Climate Change”\n\nPERIOD OF CONTRACT: Fixed-term contract, start on September 1st 2021, for 1 year and then renewable for 3 years.\n\nACTIVITY RATE: 80 % in years 1-3, 50% in year 4\n\nDEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: 31-01-2021\n\nGeneral description of the project and the position\n\nSNF funded project: “Accounting for Nature: Agriculture and Mitigation in the Era of Global Climate Change.”\n\nThis four-year ethnographic project examines how the mitigation of agricultural greenhouse gases is emerging as a sphere of\n\nknowledge and an arena of management through the development of accounting practices and protocols. It aims to explore how\n\naccounting shapes and conditions the way that both climate change, and the work of mitigation, are apprehended within agriculture.\n\nThe project will be undertaken by a small research team, including the Principal Investigator (Shaila Seshia Galvin), a Postdoctoral\n\nFellow, and one PhD student. It is designed to accommodate substantive, independent research, as well as opportunities for\n\ncollaboration. Research will be carried out within international and global networks of climate science and policy, as well as within\n\ntwo countries, Canada and India. Cumulatively, the research responds to calls for cross-scale climate ethnographies (Crate 2011),\n\nand seeks to refine understandings of accounting practice and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions within complex socionatural\n\nenvironments of agriculture. The project’s attention to the way that mitigation is apprehended and enacted in an era of global\n\nclimate change will generate new empirical and theoretical insights into accounting itself, as a phenomenological field that shapes\n\nhuman-environment relations.\n\nMission and activities\n\nThe appointed Postdoctoral Fellow will be part of a research team working closely with the project’s Principal Investigator, Shaila\n\nSeshia Galvin, Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Sociology and Faculty Affiliate of the Centre for International Environmental\n\nStudies. The candidate will be fully integrated in the life of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the Graduate Institute\n\n(https://graduateinstitute.ch/anso). Committed to theoretical innovation, robust empirical research, and fine-grained\n\nethnographic fieldwork, the department and its doctoral program foster the study of contemporary issues in global and transnational\n\nterms. The appointed PhD student will also be affiliated with the Centre for International Environmental Studies (CIES).\n\nCandidate’s profile\n\nThe Postdoctoral Fellow will lead research into the international networks of climate science and policy that are developing\n\naccounting frameworks and practices to instrumentalize the mitigation of agricultural greenhouse gases. Their research will afford\n\nopportunities to produce single and co-authored publications related to this project. In addition to their research, the Postdoctoral\n\nFellow will assume responsibility for managing the project website and project activities, such as workshops and events.\n\nPhD in Anthropology or other relevant disciplines/fields (e.g. Geography, Sociology, Environmental Studies). Applicants whose PhD\n\nwill be completed by August 2021 are welcome to apply.\n\nSubstantial fieldwork experience in the realms of climate change policy and science is necessary, while familiarity with\n\nenvironmental accounting is an asset.\n\nHighly organized and capable of working independently.\n\nExcellent written and oral communication in English, competencies in other languages an asset.\n\nExperience with website development as well as convening in-person and/or online events, such as workshops and small\n\nconferences, is desirable.\n\nExcellent interpersonal skills and ability to work with others.\n\nWe look forward to receiving your application. Your application materials should include: 1) a CV; 2) letter of motivation outlining\n\nyour interest in the postdoctoral position; 3) statement of research describing your research trajectory, interests, publications, and\n\nplans; 4) two letters of recommendation; 5) a writing sample (PhD dissertation chapter or article published or in preparation).\n\nInformal inquiries using subject line < Postdoc: Accounting for Nature > are to be sent to: shaila.seshia@graduateinstitute.ch.\n\nPlease cc all messages to Ms. Andhina Kusumawidjaja: andhina.kusumawidjaja@graduateinstitute.ch.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
