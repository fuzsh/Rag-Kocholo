She studied Educational psychology at Kenyatta University in Kenya before proceeding to study Developmental Cross-Cultural Psychology at Tilburg University where she obtained her Ph.D. in 2008. She previously worked at the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Wellcome Trust Research Program in Kenya. She was also a visiting academic at Tilburg University, the Netherland and University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Her research concerns three broad areas: examining the sequelae of various childhood diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and contextual predictors of mental health among adolescents across cultural contexts. Her main interests are in the study of developmental delays and impairments among children exposed to various health problems such as HIV, malnutrition, and malaria. Her main focus in this regard is on developing culturally appropriate strategies for identifying, monitoring and rehabilitating at-risk children. Alongside her colleagues, Dr. Abubakar has been instrumental in developing various culturally appropriate measures of child development currently in use in almost 10 African countries. She has also been involved in various projects aimed at examining the psychosocial risk factors (i.e., maternal depression, quality of home environment, and parental socioeconomic status) predictive of poor developmental outcome among vertically infected HIV positive children and adolescents. In addition, she is also interested in examining the prevalence of and risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically ASD, within the African context. As part of her postdoctoral work in cross-cultural psychology, she has recently completed a study involving more than 7,000 adolescents and emerging adults from 24 countries, where she investigates how various contextual factors (familial, school, peer, and cultural) affect well-being (mental health, and life satisfaction identity formation). Dr. Abubakar has given guest lectures and workshops largely focusing on cross-cultural research methods in various countries, including Cameroon, Germany, Indonesia, Kenya, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, and Spain.
