        "text": "Beijing Youth Leadership Summer Program participants arrived on the University of Minnesota campus on July 6, 2013. Aiming to enrich visiting Chinese high school students with the experience of living in the Midwest, presentation skills required in the American classroom, and a thorough understanding of Minnesotan (and American!) culture, this marked the second collaborative project conducted by two prestigious institutions, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and Beijing No 4 High School.\n\nThroughout their time on the University campus, program participants utilized theories and practical tips shared in their daily English language courses to enhance their real life English language proficiency levels. The program curriculum encouraged such growth by challenging students with role-play activities, individual performance evaluations, teamwork tasks, and written examinations. Students also enjoyed a variety of famous American cultural activities, such as participating in an Iron Chef cooking competition, visiting Valley Fair amusement park, touring a local farm, and shopping at the world famous Mall of America.\n\nIn addition to in-class and cultural activities, students conducted academic visits to the University of Minnesota-Duluth, Carleton College, St. Olaf College, and Macalester College. During their visits, they had the opportunity to meet admissions officers and enjoy a campus tour. One of the institutions visited, Macalester College, is Kofi Annan's alma mater.\n\nAfter establishing new friendships and building their cultural proficiency and teamwork skills, the students bid farewell to Minnesota on July 26, 2013."
