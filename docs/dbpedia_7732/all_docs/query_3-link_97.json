        "text": "Now:\n\nCompleted a pre-master programme and currently following the Clinical Psychology master programme at Leiden University\n\nStudying at UCM made me more aware of my surroundings, both environmentally and socially. Spending so much time at a small faculty like UCM made it easier to look out for one another, and I admire that the focus on mental health and the environment was such a big part of the culture. I still try to be aware of how people around me are doing, and I think the blue letters on the wall in the UCM courtyard definitely play a role in that.\n\nThen:\n\nTaking a gap year and planning to do a master's inÂ Forensic or Clinical Psychology\n\nFor me, the most valuable thing I learned is to listen better, convey other people'sÂ words into a message,Â form my own opinion about this message and subsequently answer thoroughly and reflectively.\n\nNow:\n\nObtained masterâs degree in Sociology (Gender and Sexuality Studies) at Ecole de Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, France. Currently a Junior Teaching Fellow at University College Maastricht\n\nUCM introduced me to research, it gave me the curiosity and the research mindset; I love research and it is at the core of my career choices.\n\nThen:\n\nMaster's programme in Sociology/Anthropology - Migration and Inter-ethnic relationshipsâ |Â Paris Diderot University - Paris 7\n\nIn five years, I hope that I will have gone further in the socially engaged research that I started at UCM andÂ that I will find a community to support me and stimulate me in this research.Â\n\nNow:\n\nResearch Assistant to PhD student Tom Raster (Supervisor Thomas Piketty)\n\nMy time at UCM also impacted my personal development. At UCM I had the opportunity to work as a student representative. I was lucky enough to take part in discussions with the European Commission, guided a debate with the Dutch minister of education, and moderated the opening of the academic year in 2018. This work really inspired my interest in communicating academic topics and debates. My hope is to work as a journalist and documentarian for economic subject matters after completing a PhD.\n\nThen:\n\nInternships in: Economic research, journalism, documentary film making\n\nUCM gave me the confidence and self-assurance to take me time, rather than rush into the next bestÂ opportunity. In five yearsÂ I am hope to have a masterâs degree and perhaps be on my way to receiving a PhD.\n\nNow:\n\nCompleting Crisis & Security Management master at Leiden University, Faculty of Governance & Global Affairs, and Law and Politics of International Security master at VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Law\n\nUCM most definitely equipped me with the skills I needed after graduation. I was able to quickly adapt to ânewâ academic fields and university environments, as well as to a professional working environment. Thanks to the interdisciplinary UCM curriculum, it was relatively easy for me to adapt to the field of law, after having studied political science and international relations at UCM.\n\nThen:\n\nPlanning to pursue a Master's programme in Security studies â\n\nIn five years from now, I would love to haveÂ finishedÂ the diplomat training programme of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after of course completing a master's degree.\n\nPhD Candidate,Â Cornell University (USA)\n\nMaster's degree: Soil Science, Cornell University\n\nI am currently completing my PhD research on soil and root-facilitated carbon cycling in forest ecosystems under climate change at Cornell University in the United States.\n\nMy experience at UCM has given me strong critical thinking and writing skills, which I still benefit from on a daily basis. I am also very thankful for the diversity of subjects I studied during my time at UCM. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to more easily collaborate and communicate with scientists, policy makers and stakeholders across fields and countries so that we can together solve complex environmental problems.\n\nHuman Rights Watch Researcher\n\nMaster's degree: International Affairs, The New School\n\nSome ten years upon graduation, I still draw on the teachings at UCM and look fondly back on my experience. UCM taught me how to work in a multicultural team, acquire and analyze large swathes of material in a short amount of time, and write in a concise manner.\n\nThese skills proved essential in my capacity as a researcher and office leader for Human Rights Watch in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I traveled to disparate parts of the country to document war crimes, crimes against humanity and political repression. Above all, UCM taught me how to think and has fostered a deep love for education.\n\nMuch of what I've learnt at UCM has truly opened my eyes to the forces that shape our world. The impact the school had on me is immeasurable. It's a wonderful place.\n\nSenior Policy Officer,Â Ministry of Foreign AffairsÂ (NL)\n\nMaster's degrees: European Law, Maastricht University |Â International Peace and Security, Kings College London\n\nI chose University College MaastrichtÂ because I wanted to do it all: law, politics, international relations, European Studies. And at UCM you can combine all your interests and build a strong academic foundation for your future.\n\nIn my view UCM offers students the perfect stepping stone to pursue a masterâs degree in a wide variety of subjects, as well as a solid multidisciplinary base for an international career. Thanks to problem based learning all students have a collaborative approach which creates a warm and social academic environment. Both the students and staff at UCM are intelligent, hardworking individuals who all have a passion for a particular subject.\n\nThere is also plenty of opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities which helps you build relevant skills.\n\nFounder / Managing Director:Â Digital Shapers\n\nMaster's degrees: Master in Business Studies | University of Amsterdam\n\nBefore moving to Maastricht I spent a gap year studying languages abroad. Upon return I preferred to study in an international environment, which I found at University College Maastricht. UCM was also personal and dedicated to its students, and it offered an exciting curriculum which was highly rated.\n\nUpon finishing my master's, I started a Mobile App agency. Iâm still an entrepreneur now, working on a different company called Digital Shapers, with which I help organisations with digital transformation, working on data driven change, digital innovation and a digital workforce.\n\nUCM fulfilled its promises and was a stepping-stone to an international career. It gave me a fair understanding of important driving forces in the world, in a variety of areas such as politics, business, law, sustainability, philosophy, and history. Not only the curriculum, but also the problem-based learning method, and the culture at UCM have made my overall experience highly positive. Most importantly, it has given me trust to pursue my ambitions as an entrepreneur; without a doubt I would always study at UCM again.Â\n\nSoftware Developer at Sapienza Consulting\n\nOne of the things I appreciate the most about UCM is that it taught me about the importance of diversifying your skills. I would say I got something that most science students never had the chance to learn, and even though I might never use some of that knowledge daily, it shaped me into a more complete person.\n\nLearning is not only about gaining industry-specific skills, but even more about exploring everything thatâs out there and is waiting to be studied. At times it may feel like youâre becoming the jack of all trades and master of none; however, if you donât explore your interests at this time of your life, then, when will you?\n\nPutting it short: the world offers a lot of things to explore, so it would be a pity to get stuck with one thing so early on."
