Since the times of Hans Kelsen, who published his influential 'Pure Theory of Law' while a professor at the Institute, the International Law Department has been at the forefront of international law research, education and practice. The Department offers several post-graduate degrees in international law, including its new LL.M. in public international law, with various specialisations.",

        "text": "The Graduate Institute offers two masters-level degrees in international law. The LL.M. in International Law (LL.M.) is a one-year postgraduate degree course that equips students with the knowledge and professional skills necessary to advance or launch a career in international law. Download the program brochure here. The Master in International Law (MIL) is a two-year research-oriented postgraduate degree that provides a solid grounding in the foundational areas of international law. Download the program brochure here.\n\nThe Department also offers four joint postgraduate degrees, three masters in collaboration with the University of Geneva and one master with Georgetown University Law Center. One of the joint degrees with the University of Geneva is the Geneva LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS), which is a one-year full-time graduate degree program providing the opportunity for an in-depth and high-profile study of international dispute settlement from a broad range of perspectives. Another is the LL.M. in International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights at The Geneva Academy, comprising courses which cover all branches of international law applicable to armed conflicts and professionalising activities encompassing internships at NGOs and international organisations as well workshops led by experts.\n\nThe Graduate Institute\n\nThe Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies is an institution of research and higher education dedicated to the study of world affairs, with a particular emphasis on the cross-cutting fields of international relations and development issues.\n\nThrough our core activities, we aim to promote international cooperation and make a contribution to the progress of developing societies. More broadly, we endeavour to develop creative thinking on the major challenges of our time, foster global responsibility and advance respect for diversity.\n\nWe are a cosmopolitan community located in the heart of Geneva, an international city and a centre of global governance. By intensely engaging with international organisations, NGOs, governments and multinational companies, we participate in global discussions and prepare future policy-makers to lead tomorrow's world.\n\nThe International Law Department\n\nOur world-renowned Faculty train international lawyers in a tradition of academic excellence at the heart of multilateral Geneva. We offer well-rounded legal curricula to ensure our students acquire the substantive knowledge and professional skills they need to become outstanding international lawyers. Students benefit from an unrivalled student-faculty ratio, one of the world's broadest course-offerings in international law and exposure to international legal practice in Geneva.\n\nSmall classes and seminars offer pedagogical instruction and stimulating intellectual fora, while the interdisciplinary approach and multicultural environment at The Graduate Institute equip students to meet the global challenges of our time. With courses that cover the full range of international law specialties and programmes tailored for both professional and research ambitions, our students have the best possible opportunity to get ahead in an international law career.\n\nTo be eligible for the LL.M. Programme, applicants must possess a complete legal education which entitles them to sit for the bar exam in their country of origin, e.g. the Maîtrise de droit in Switzerland, the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in the United Kingdom, the Juris Doctor (J.D.) in the United States, the Maîtrise de droit (or equivalent title from a Haute Ecole) in France or the Erstes Juristisches Staatsexamen in Germany. However, please note that there is no need to have completed any professional courses requirements, such as the Ecole d'avocature in Switzerland or Legal Practice Course in the United Kingdom, or other training courses organised by the bar association of the respective country.\n\nThe Graduate Institute is located at the heart of international legal affairs. Not only does Geneva lay claim to hosting the European headquarters of the United Nations, but it is also the seat of numerous international and non-governmental organisations (e.g. the WTO, WIPO, WHO, WMO, ILO, OCHA, UNHCR, ICRC, IMO, UNICEF, GAVI Alliance, The Global Fund, MSF, UNECE, IUCN, CITES, Ramsar and the WWF, to name but a few), multinational companies, a variety of dispute settlement fora and many global law firms. As a result, there is a wealth of opportunities for legal internships, traineeships and employment. Further still, the design of our programmes - combined with the close institutional links that The Graduate Institute has in Geneva - is conducive to gaining an insight into these organisations and for networking.\n\nGeneva is also one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Being as it is a mixing pot of over 180 nationalities, Geneva is an ideal place to understand different cultures, traditions and backgrounds from around the globe. Indeed, cultural sensitivity is a fundamentally important skill for an international lawyer. In a similar way, Geneva also presents a valuable opportunity to learn new languages and give yourself a distinct advantage in the global employment market. In short, Geneva really does offer fertile ground on which to cultivate international lawyers.\n\nThe Graduate Institute offers excellent housing options in the heart of international Geneva. We are pleased to announce that, as of autumn 2020, the Institute will be able to offer accommodation to all its students.\n\nIn addition to the current Edgar and Danièle de Picciotto Student House, the Institute is building a new student residence that will be ready in September 2020.\n\nLiving in our student residences will allow you to integrate into a supportive community and will help you get the most out of your academic experience.\n\nYou may find descriptions of all housing options on our website here."
