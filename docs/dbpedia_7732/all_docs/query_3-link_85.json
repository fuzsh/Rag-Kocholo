        "text": "Deadline: July 31, 2024\n\nThe Call for Applied Research Projects (ARPs) Partners 2024-2025 are now open. Every year, the Geneva Graduate Institute invites policy and practice partners to bid for a group of first- year Masters students to undertake Applied Research Projects (ARPs) on their behalf. ARPs involve small student groups working together to conduct policy-relevant research with partner organisations on issues relating to international development and international relations.\n\nOverview\n\nApplied Research Projects (ARPs) are a foundational component of the MINT programme. ARPs involve small student groups working together to conduct policy-relevant research with partner organisations on issues relating to international development and international relations.\n\nThrough ARPs, students learn and apply analytical and research skills to practical and policy-relevant issues in international relations and development. Students work with autonomy and professionalism under the supervision of a team of Graduate Institute faculty.\n\nOver the course of the ARP, students are expected to:\n\nelaborate project Terms of Reference and frame appropriate research questions;\n\nconduct in-depth literature reviews and design relevant methodologies;\n\nundertake original research;\n\nanalyse primary data;\n\nwrite analytic preliminary and final reports; and\n\npresent final research findings.\n\nTeamwork, collaboration, professionalism, effective communication, and problem solving are crucial skills that the ARP process aims to teach students.\n\nEligibility\n\nOrganisations working on issues of global concern are invited to submit applications to sponsor an ARP. Partner organisations are expected to provide guidance and support to students to generate research that is of policy and practical relevance.\n\nExpectations\n\nApplying to serve as an ARP Partner Organisation is a competitive process; successful applicants demonstrate a commitment to supporting students across the project period, including through the provision of technical expertise, supporting studentsâ professional learning, and helping students connect with other leading experts in the relevant field of practice.\n\nARP Partner Organisations are expected to:\n\nprovide overall framing of the research project;\n\nparticipate in approximately 4 meetings with students across the project period;\n\nprovide feedback on and validate studentsâ deliverables, including the Terms of Reference, Literature Review and Methodology, and the Preliminary and Final Reports;\n\nattend the final presentation.\n\nApplication\n\nPartner applications are being accepted on a rolling basis. Final partner applications are due 31 July 2024. Applicants are advised that due to a high number of quality proposals, the process to become a partner organisation is competitive.\n\nClick here to apply"
