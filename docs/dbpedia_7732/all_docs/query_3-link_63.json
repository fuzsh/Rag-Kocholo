        "text": "We welcome applications from all suitably qualified prospective students and want to recruit students with the very best academic merit, potential and motivation, irrespective of their background.\n\nWe carefully consider each application on an individual basis, taking into account all the information presented on your application form, including your:\n\n- academic achievement (including predicted and achieved grades)\n\n- statement of academic purpose\n\n- two academic references\n\n- CV\n\nSee further information on supporting documents\n\nYou may also have to provide evidence of your English proficiency, although you do not need to provide this at the time of your application to LSE. See our English language requirements.\n\nWhen to apply\n\nApplications for this programme are considered on a rolling basis, meaning the programme will close once it becomes full. There is no fixed deadline by which you need to apply, however, to be considered for any LSE funding opportunity, you must have submitted your application and all supporting documents by the funding deadline. See the fees and funding section for more details.\n\nEvery graduate student is charged a fee for their programme.\n\nThe fee covers registration and examination fees payable to the School, lectures, classes and individual supervision, lectures given at other colleges under intercollegiate arrangements and, under current arrangements, membership of the Students' Union. It does not cover living costs or travel or fieldwork.\n\nTuition fees 2024/25 for MSc International Development and Humanitarian Emergencies\n\nHome students: £17,424\n\nOverseas students: £27,480\n\nThe Table of Fees shows the latest tuition amounts for all programmes offered by the School.\n\nFee status\n\nThe amount of tuition fees you will need to pay, and any financial support you are eligible for, will depend on whether you are classified as a home or overseas student, otherwise known as your fee status. LSE assesses your fee status based on guidelines provided by the Department of Education.\n\nFurther information about fee status classification.\n\nFee reduction\n\nStudents who completed undergraduate study at LSE and are beginning taught graduate study at the School are eligible for a fee reduction of around 10 per cent of the fee.\n\nScholarships and other funding\n\nThe School recognises that the cost of living in London may be higher than in your home town or country, and we provide generous scholarships each year to home and overseas students.\n\nThis programme is eligible for needs-based awards from LSE, including the Graduate Support Scheme, Master's Awards, and Anniversary Scholarships.\n\nSelection for any funding opportunity is based on receipt of an offer for a place and submitting a Graduate Financial Support application, before the funding deadline. Funding deadline for needs-based awards from LSE: 25 April 2024.\n\nIn addition to our needs-based awards, LSE also makes available scholarships for students from specific regions of the world and awards for students studying specific subject areas. Find out more about financial support.\n\nGovernment tuition fee loans and external funding\n\nA postgraduate loan is available from the UK government for eligible students studying for a first master’s programme, to help with fees and living costs.

It is neither qualitative nor quantitative in focus, but rather is concerned with core interdisciplinary principles of research design that span disciplinary and methodological traditions\n\nCourses to the value of one and a half units from a range of options\n\nFor the most up-to-date list of optional courses please visit the relevant School Calendar page.\n\nYou must note, however, that while care has been taken to ensure that this information is up to date and correct, a change of circumstances since publication may cause the School to change, suspend or withdraw a course or programme of study, or change the fees that apply to it. The School will always notify the affected parties as early as practicably possible and propose any viable and relevant alternative options. Note that the School will neither be liable for information that after publication becomes inaccurate or irrelevant, nor for changing, suspending or withdrawing a course or programme of study due to events outside of its control, which includes but is not limited to a lack of demand for a course or programme of study, industrial action, fire, flood or other environmental or physical damage to premises.\n\nYou must also note that places are limited on some courses and/or subject to specific entry requirements. The School cannot therefore guarantee you a place. Please note that changes to programmes and courses can sometimes occur after you have accepted your offer of a place. These changes are normally made in light of developments in the discipline or path-breaking research, or on the basis of student feedback. Changes can take the form of altered course content, teaching formats or assessment modes. Any such changes are intended to enhance the student learning experience. You should visit the School’s Calendar, or contact the relevant academic department, for information on the availability and/or content of courses and programmes of study. Certain substantive changes will be listed on the updated graduate course and programme information page.\n\nContact hours and independent study\n\nWithin your programme you will take a number of courses, often including half unit courses and full unit courses. In half unit courses, on average, you can expect 30-40 contact hours in total and for full unit courses, on average, you can expect 60-75 contact hours in total. This includes sessions such as lectures, classes, seminars or workshops. Hours vary according to courses and you can view indicative details in the Calendar within the Teaching section of each course guide.\n\nYou are also expected to complete independent study outside of class time. This varies depending on the programme, but requires you to manage the majority of your study time yourself, by engaging in activities such as reading, note-taking, thinking and research.\n\nTeaching methods\n\nLSE is internationally recognised for its teaching and research and therefore employs a rich variety of teaching staff with a range of experience and status. Courses may be taught by individual members of faculty, such as lecturers, senior lecturers, readers, associate professors and professors. Many departments now also employ guest teachers and visiting members of staff, LSE teaching fellows and graduate teaching assistants who are usually doctoral research students and in the majority of cases, teach on undergraduate courses only. You can view indicative details for the teacher responsible for each course in the relevant course guide.\n\nAssessment\n\nAll taught courses are required to include formative coursework which is unassessed. It is designed to help prepare you for summative assessment which counts towards the course mark and to the degree award. LSE uses a range of formative assessment, such as essays, problem sets, case studies, reports, quizzes, mock exams and many others. Summative assessment may be conducted during the course or by final examination at the end of the course. An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.\n\nExtra-curricular activities and learning\n\nYou have the opportunity to attend a departmental weekly lecture series that brings to the School prominent scholars and practitioners who discuss the findings and methodological dimensions of development research and/or problems of development practice.\n\nThe programme also benefits from its own voice of experience lecture series (previous speakers have included senior staff from major UN and NGO organisations), a free weekend workshop on humanitarian programme management and evaluation, and an opportunity to attend an optional three day trip to Geneva in order to visit key humanitarian organisations.\n\nAcademic support\n\nYou will also be assigned an academic mentor who will be available for guidance and advice on academic or personal concerns.\n\nThere are many opportunities to extend your learning outside the classroom and complement your academic studies at LSE.
