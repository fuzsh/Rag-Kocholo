        "text": "Dr. Samuel Nyeon Beh, Sr. is originally from Liberia. He came to the United States in 1987 to pursue graduate studies at Boston University School of Education. He holds a master degree (M.Ed.) in Social Studies education and a doctorate (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership: Policy, Planning and Administration, both from Boston University School of Education. In response to a plea for assistance from the administration of the University of Liberia, his alma mater, to rebuild the institution following Liberia's brutal civil war of the 1990's that destroyed the physical facilities of the University, Dr. Beh in 2008, co-founded the Massachusetts Alliance for the Restoration of the University of Liberia (MARUL), Inc. and served as president for two consecutive terms. MARUL, Inc. provides scholarships to undergraduate students at the University of Liberia. Dr. Beh is a member of the advisory board of the Trustees of Donations for Education in Liberia (TDEL), a Massachusetts charitable educational corporation incorporated in 1850 for the promotion and support of higher education in Liberia.\n\nCurrently, he teaches social studies at Lexington High School (AP Human Geography and World History) and has been a Lexington educator since 2002.\n\n\"With the closure of the African Assistance Center, the newly established African Community Center fills an important need for African refugees and immigrants in the Greater Lowell Area. The Center was established with the aim of promoting the educational, social, and cultural aspirations of its target population. My desire to serve on the board of the Center comes out of the conviction that my background and many years of experience as a public school educator can be useful in assisting the center in realizing its educational objectives. Developing partnerships between the home and school is crucial for academic success and as a result, I will encourage and support programs that foster parental involvement in the schools and education of their children. Additionally, I will work with the Centerâ€™s Executive Director and others in equipping our newly arrived parents with the skills that will help them better understand how to navigate the public school system.\"\n\nDr.Beh served as the Board Chair of ACCL from 2016 thru'2022.\n\nLatifah Phillips, Chief Equity and Engagement Officer in Lowell Public Schools, has held district and state-level education leadership positions in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Washington. She began her professional career working at the California Trade Office in Mexico City, Mexico, and later taught in public schools in Takasaki, Gunma, Japan for three years before returning to teach elementary and middle school in the US.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Phillips served as the State Director of Native Education in Washington State, providing technical assistance and educational support to Tribal and public schools serving over 60,000 Native students and 29 federally recognized Tribes. She has also served as Assistant Secretary of Indian Education for the New Mexico Public Education Department, Chief of Staff for Santa Fe Public Schools and Executive Director of Non-instructional Professional Development and Performance Management in the School District of Philadelphia. Ms. Phillips holds a Master of Education degree in Secondary Education from the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley, and a Master of Arts degree in International Education Development with a focus on language and literacy from Columbia University, Teachers College.\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, Ms. Phillips believes that education is one of the greatest equalizing factors in society. She speaks Spanish and Japanese and is driven by a personal mission of helping to create educational opportunities for all children which will enable them to successfully explore and pursue their life options. She is honored to serve the children and families of Lowell Public Schools"
