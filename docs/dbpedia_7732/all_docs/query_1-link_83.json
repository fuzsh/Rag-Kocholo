        "text": "The first batch of 30 doctors trained at the Family Health Medical School, Ghana’s premier private medical school, have graduated.\n\nAt the school’s maiden congregation on Wednesday 9th December,2020, the new doctors, who had successfully completed a six-year undergraduate medical programme, as well as those who had been admitted at Level 300 for a four-and a -half-year graduate entry programme were all awarded Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBChB) degrees.\n\nThe medical school, which is one of the wings of the Family Health University College in Accra, is affiliated to the University of Ghana and accredited by the Medical and Dental Council.\n\nThe college, according to the National Accreditation Board (NAB) was the first private medical school to be granted accreditation in April 2015.\n\nThe President of the College, Prof. E.Y. Kwawukume, in his report during the congregation, said the graduate medical programme offered by the institution was the first and only one of its type by a private health facility in the West African sub-region.\n\nHe urged the new doctors to continue working to add value to themselves to become more competitive. He also asked them to adhere to the standards and ethics of the medical profession in all they do and to be good ambassadors of their alma mater.\n\nHe said each year, the medical school admits candidates at two levels, with the undergraduate programme starting from Level 100, while the graduate level begins from Level 300.\n\nThe student population, which was at 30 at the inception of the programme, was now 220.\n\nProf. Kwawukume said the school provided smart learning methodology because that matched the vision of the institution to be the prime Centre of professional medical education and training in advancement of human health.\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the school adopted user-friendly, accessible and affordable online teaching and learning applications to ensure continuity in teaching and learning.\n\nIn conclusion to the President’s address, Prof. Kwawukume said, “Family Health Medical School is focused and committed to student research because the school prepares students for careers in Academic medicine through which doctors can combine scientific discovery with clinical insight to drive medicine forward”"
