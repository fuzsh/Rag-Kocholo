        "text": "About the Podcast\n\nRegarded as one of the modern world’s icons of diplomacy, what is Kofi Annan’s legacy today? What can we learn from him, and how can we prepare for tomorrow based on his vision for a better world?\n\nIn this exclusive 10-part podcast, Ahmad Fawzi, one of Kofi Annan’s former spokespersons and Communication Advisor, examines how Kofi Annan tackled a specific crisis and its relevance to today’s world and challenges.\n\nKofi Annan’s call to bring all stakeholders around the table — including the private sector, local authorities, civil society organisations, academia, and scientists — resonates now more than ever with so many, who understand that governments alone cannot shape our future.\n\nJoin us on a journey of discovery as Ahmad Fawzi interviews some of Kofi Annan’s closest advisors and colleagues, including Dr Peter Piot, Christiane Amanpour, Mark Malloch-Brown, Michael Møller, Mark Suzman, Alicia Bárcena and more.\n\nListen and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and SoundCloud.\n\nBrought to you by the Kofi Annan Foundation and the United Nations Information Service.\n\nKofi Annan Speeches\n\nAs United Nations (UN) Secretary-General and later Chair of his Foundation, Kofi Annan was called upon to deliver many speeches at major events worldwide.\n\nWe have selected twenty of Kofi Annan’s speeches for this page, which, taken together, provide a broad understanding of his views on peace, development and human rights. Many of his recommendations for action are as valid and important today as they were when he spoke these words."
