        "text": "The programme is based on solid common foundations, to ensure students acquire the rigorous analytical framework and methodological bases they will need throughout the programme and in their professional lives.\n\n1 | Compulsory course on Global Issues & Perspectives\n\nTo be followed by all MINT Students during their first semester.\n\nWhy do we think students need this course?\n\nMINT students are coming from very diverse countries and disciplines. They need to come together around a common understanding of global affairs.\n\nGlobal issues are constantly evolving, thereby requiring a constantly refreshed analysis.\n\nThis course sets up the analytical foundations of the programme. All MINT students are together to familiarise themselves with the programme approach, vocabulary, and the global issues it addresses.\n\n2 | Compulsory course on Statistical Literacy\n\nTaken by all MINT Students during their first semester.\n\nWhy is this course organised?\n\nIn today’s world, it is crucial to know how to decipher, interpret and use with a critical eye, the quantitative information we receive on a daily basis.\n\nStatistical literacy (the ability to understand statistics) is one of the foundations for effective decision-making today.\n\nThis course establishes one of the methodological basis of the programme. As it is a beginner-level course, students with demonstrated knowledge of statistics can request a waiver (to be replaced by another course).\n\n3 | Research Electives\n\nStudents must validate two Research Electives, during their MINT first year. Students can choose amongst a list.\n\nCategories are: quantitative methods, qualitative methods, hybrid methods and legal & philosophical methods.\n\nWhy Research Electives are part of the curriculum?\n\nThey introduce students to new ways of thinking – they are methodological courses taught by experts / professors from different disciplines.\n\nStudents need to acquire innovative perspectives on international affairs, and a critical-thinking mindset.\n\nThey aim at providing students with solid, interdisciplinary methodological foundations.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Applied Research Projects (ARPs) are a foundational component of the MINT. ARPs involve small student groups coming together to conduct policy-relevant research with partner organisations on issues relating to international relations and development.\n\nThrough ARPs, students learn and apply analytical and practical skills to policy-relevant issues. Students work under the supervision of a Faculty Lead and are expected to: elaborate project Terms of Reference and frame appropriate research questions; conduct in-depth literature reviews and design relevant methodologies; undertake original research; analyse primary data; write analytic preliminary and final reports; and present final research findings. Teamwork, collaboration, professionalism, effective communication, and problem solving are crucial skills that the ARP process aims to teach students.\n\nPARTNER ORGANISATIONS\n\nOrganisations working on issues of global concern and interested in sponsoring an ARP are invited to submit their applications. Partners are expected to provide guidance and support to students to generate research that is of policy and practical relevance. Applying to serve as an ARP partner is a competitive process; successful applicants demonstrate a commitment to supporting students across the project period, including through the provision of technical expertise, supporting students’ professional learning, and helping students connect with other leading experts in the relevant field of practice.\n\nARP Partner Organisations are expected to:\n\nprovide overall framing of the research project;\n\nparticipate in approximately 4 meetings with students across the project period;\n\nattend the final presentation;\n\nprovide feedback on and validate students’ deliverables, including the Terms of Reference, Literature Review and Methodology, and the Preliminary and Final Reports.\n\nApplications for ARP Partner Organisations for 2024 - 2025 are now closed. Applications for the next academic year (2025 - 2026) will open in Spring 2025.\n\nFor more information, please contact the Head of Applied Research Projects and Practice.\n\nThe MINT offers a common core and seven specialisations. Each of them follows an interdisciplinary approach, informed by the rich expertise of the Institute in five disciplines: anthropology and sociology, international economics, international history and politics, international law, and international relations and political science. Specialisations are not self-standing silos: they are interconnected curricula providing to students the possibility to tailor to a certain extent. their individual paths.\n\nMost of today's global issues are broader than a specific domain, and we also encourage students to explore their interlinkages through courses dedicated to wider transversal themes (Sustainability, Democracy & Inequality, Fairness & Justice, Digital & Emerging Technologies, Global Governance, and Education).\n\n1 | CONFLICT, PEACE AND SECURITY\n\nThis specialisation focuses on the issues of conflict, peace, and security and the interactions among them. It examines the drivers and manifestations of conflict, the nature and conditions of peace, and the determinants of security. Within an interdisciplinary approach, we survey the various historical and contemporary manifestations of these processes.\n\nSome courses taught in 2023 – 24:\n\nConflict Resolution and Peace Mediation in Times of Radical Uncertainty\n\nPeacebuilding and Peace Making in a Violent World\n\nPredicting Crisis\n\nTechnology, Power, Global Governance\n\nThe Evolution of Global Security\n\nThe Politics and Practice of International Conflict Resolution\n\nHead: Prof. Mohamed Mahmoud Mohamedou\n\n2 | ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nThis specialisation focuses on global environmental challenges, which lie at the heart of the search for a sustainable human future on Earth. It examines the impacts of contemporary political economies locally and at the planetary scale. It adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the understanding of the economics and politics of decisions about the environment, from the global scale (e.g. climate change or global ecology) to the local (e.g. agrarian change, biodiversity conservation, urbanisation or mining).\n\nSome courses taught in 2023 – 24:\n\nInternational Environmental Law\n\nEnvironmental Economics & Sustainability\n\nTrade and Development\n\nClimate Science and Policy\n\nPolitical Economy and Geopolitics of International Energy\n\nHistory and Politics of Global Environment Governance\n\nHead: Prof. James Hollway\n\n3 | GENDER, RACE AND DIVERSITY\n\nThis specialisation addresses how power relations based on gender, race, and other forms of difference structure international affairs. The goal is to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and tools to help redress intersecting inequalities and oppressions globally. Students gain interdisciplinary training that addresses a broad range of topics, including histories of colonialism and decoloniality; anthropologies and sociologies of (anti)racism, sexuality and gender; the economics of gender and development; and the gendered and racialised politics of international governance and international law.\n\nSome courses from 2023 – 24:\n\nSociology of Gender\n\nPublic Policy, Economic Development and Gender\n\nGender and Bodies in Global Health\n\nFeminist Political Economy\n\nGender, Sexuality and Decolonization in the Global South\n\nThe History of Inequality\n\nHead: Prof. Elisabeth Prügl\n\n4 | GLOBAL HEALTH\n\nThis specialisation focuses on power, politics and governance in global health. Students will learn how global health issues affect, and are affected by, geopolitics through global institutions and transnational actors, political economy, and epistemological and regulatory regimes. Students will also learn how to work across professional disciplines, how to obtain meaningful input from different stakeholders including affected communities, and how to translate knowledge into policy.\n\nSome of the 2023 - 24 courses:\n\nHealth technology innovation and access: politics and policies\n\nGlobal Governance and Health: Problems and Politics\n\nGlobal Health Law\n\nGlobal Health: History, Politics, Controversies\n\nGlobal History of Reproductive Politics\n\nMigration and Health from an International Perspective\n\nHead: Prof. Gian-Luca Burci\n\n5 | HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIANISM\n\n'This specialisation will introduce students to these inter-related ethical / legal topics, and their changing relationship.
