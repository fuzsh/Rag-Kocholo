        "text": "A ‚Äúpolycrisis‚Äù world is where crises are complex and interwoven. It is no longer sufficient for leaders to deal with each crisis in isolation. It demands a holistic sense-making of the complex web of challenges and the ability to formulate comprehensive strategies that address the underlying issues. Soft skills are thus required to rally teams, and for national crises, the population at large. All this requires leaders to transcend traditional boundaries and embrace interdisciplinary thinking. Equipping leaders with the necessary skills becomes all the more important. Since its inception in 2006, the Home Team Academy has been doing that for the Home Team leaders. Today, the Home Team has gone beyond serving Home Team departments to providing the whole public service with crisis leadership training. For this special issue, besides working on the required skills and competencies for leaders, we have also incorporated important works done by our Home Team psychologists to strengthen the leadership development. We are also very privileged to have contributions from scholars, practitioners, and thought leaders in homefront security, as well as our strategic partners in training. Dive into our carefully curated issue on crisis leadership and allow it to enlighten, inspire and guide you through these complex times. Enjoy your reading!

Title: Anticipating crises arising from intergroup tensions: Decoding identity-related online discourse in multicultural Singapore.\n\nVerizon‚Äôs Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg, makes it a goal to talk to his top 30 stakeholders every week. He keeps the list on the back of his security badge as a reminder. Not only does it keep him connected and visible, it helps ensure that the first time he hears from someone isn‚Äôt when something is going wrong. Articles abound with lists about the qualities of a good, global leader, many of which are biased to people leading in Western contexts. But some version of this practice seems like a useful habit for senior leaders everywhere. #globalleadership #culturalintelligence\n\nValues-based leadership, a core priority for the Aspen Institute Central Europe, is essential for overcoming contemporary threats and maintaining the essential coherence of civilization.ü§ù President Petr Pavel emphasized that the common denominator of current threats is the rejection of the existing international order based not only on rules but also on universal values that form the basis for our way of life. \"There is a growing need and importance for individuals to lead the effort to defend them. Therefore, it is important that today's and tomorrow's leaders actively defend and promote the common values of civilization, even within democratic societies.‚Äú\n\nI had the privilege to attend a keynote session with best-selling author Simon Sinek's The Optimism Company during the International Association of Chiefs of Police. I tried to pull together some of the best leadership advice as he spoke directly to police chiefs, sheriffs, strategic comms advisors, and leaders. Here is part 1 of his thought-provoking challenge to the leadership of our noble profession. #IACP2023 #SimonSinek #PoliceLeadership\n\n\"...understand that you are leading human beings. You can't lead an organization, you can only run an organization....You can only lead people, and that skillset is unique...Leading people is something profoundly different and most police organizations have sub-adequate training on how to lead human beings; it's not a criticism, it's an opportunity.\" Thanks to Chief Christopher Cook for capturing Simon Sinek's fireside chat with #IACP2023 attendees where he discusses the opportunities police leaders have to profoundly modernize the industry."
