        "text": "Other Undergraduate Degree Programs\n\nGraduate Degree Programs\n\nCertificate and Licensure Programs\n\nBachelor's/Master's Accelerated Programs\n\nNonmatriculated Students and Auditors\n\nOther Undergraduate Degree Programs\n\nDual-Degree Programs\n\nMount Holyoke offers several undergraduate dual-degree opportunities described below. (If instead, you are seeking information about credit received at other institutions, see the transfer credit information in the Academic Regulations chapter.)\n\nEngineering\n\nMount Holyoke participates in the following dual-degree engineering programs, allowing students to earn two bachelors degrees in five years. For each of them, it is important to begin planning in the first year. For more information about the dual-degree engineering programs, visit the programs' website.\n\nThe Nexus in Engineering program is also offered, preparing science or math majors for future graduate work in engineering or employment in engineering-related fields.\n\nThayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College\n\nStudents who choose the Dartmouth dual-degree engineering program spend their junior year at Dartmouth College taking engineering courses. They return to Mount Holyoke for their senior year and earn their A.B. from Mount Holyoke. Following graduation, students spend an additional year at the Thayer School to be eligible to earn a bachelor’s of engineering (B.E.). Admission to the program is through both an internal Mount Holyoke application for the dual degree and a direct application to Thayer.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech)\n\nAdmission to Caltech is through its admission committee. Accepted students will spend their fourth and fifth years at Caltech and, after successful completion of that program, will receive both a bachelor of science degree from Caltech and the bachelor of arts from Mount Holyoke.\n\nSchool of Engineering at UMass Amherst\n\nThis program allows a Mount Holyoke student to earn a second bachelor’s degree, in engineering, to be awarded by the University of Massachusetts, in the year following graduation from Mount Holyoke. Students may major in chemical, civil and environmental, electrical, industrial, mechanical, or computer systems engineering.\n\nOrdinarily, the student will spend the junior year at UMass, registered in the appropriate engineering courses through Five College cross-registration. After the fourth year at Mount Holyoke, the student will attend UMass for the fifth year. The programs in computer and electrical engineering require three years at Mount Holyoke followed by two years at UMass. The program is administered by an advisory committee consisting of one member from each participating MHC science department, including mathematics/statistics, as well as a similar committee at UMass, consisting of one member from each participating engineering department.\n\nA student pursuing the dual-degree program must have an MHC advisor from the committee and a UMass advisor no later than the fall of the sophomore year. In consultation with these advisors, the student maps out a plan of study for the sophomore, junior, senior, and postsenior years. The plan must satisfy all graduation requirements at both schools and be approved by both advisors.\n\nThe Second Bachelor’s Degree\n\nMount Holyoke welcomes students interested in earning a second bachelor’s degree. Candidates must submit an official college transcript with conferred degree verification, an autobiographical essay, a proposed plan of study, and two letters of recommendation.\n\nCandidates for a second bachelor’s degree are not eligible for financial aid from Mount Holyoke College but may qualify for federal student loans.\n\nCandidates seeking to earn a second bachelor’s degree must spend a minimum of four semesters at Mount Holyoke. They must earn a minimum of 64 Mount Holyoke academic credits (beyond their first undergraduate degree), and complete College and distribution requirements, as well as the requirements of their declared major.\n\nApplicants should contact the Office of Admission for details about the application process.\n\nApplications are accepted throughout the academic year. Two entrance dates are available: September and late January, with a preferred application deadline of March 1 for fall entrance and November 15 for spring.\n\nGraduate Degree Programs\n\nMaster of Arts in Teaching\n\nMount Holyoke, through its Professional and Graduate Education division, offers three different programs issuing a Master of Arts in Teaching degree: the Master of Arts in Teaching program referred to as the \"M.A.T. program\", the Master of Arts in Mathematics Teaching program referred to as the \"M.A.M.T program\", and the Master of Arts in Teacher Leadership program referred to as the \"M.A.T.L program\".\n\nThe Committee on Graduate Work — consisting of the dean of studies and representatives from each program offering graduate work — approves thesis proposals and theses, adjudicates petitions for exceptions and waivers to the requirements, and reviews graduate requirements and procedures, forms, fees, and stipends. Each program has a graduate advisor, appointed by the department.\n\nCertificate and Licensure Programs\n\nTeacher Licensure Programs\n\nStudents completing Mount Holyoke teacher licensure programs are eligible to apply for a Massachusetts (and NASDTEC Interstate Contract) “initial” license. Undergraduate students may pursue licensure in the areas listed in Psychology and Education. For additional information about undergraduate Mount Holyoke College Teacher Licensure Programs, please see the Teacher Licensure Programs page within Psychology and Education.\n\nThe Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) allows graduate students to pursue initial teacher licensure as part of the program. Graduate students who wish to independently pursue additional license types can gain preparation through add-on licensure coursework. More information on the M.A.T. and special education are found in the Professional and Graduate Education chapter.\n\nCertificate for International Students\n\nExchange students enrolled in non-degree programs may select courses that will enable them to qualify for the Certificate for International Students. The program requires a minimum of one year in residence and a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for 20 credits of work.\n\nStudents may earn a certificate in general studies or in a particular field, such as international relations or English. Students may choose a field from any of the majors or minors offered at the College and may want to consult with their academic advisor about their course selections.\n\nStudents choosing to earn a certificate in a specific field must complete at least 12 of 20 credits of graded course work in that field with satisfactory academic standing. Students who complete their program of study with a cumulative average of 3.5 or better receive the certificate with distinction. For more information about international student programs, contact the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives at 413-538-2072.\n\nBachelor's/Master's Accelerated Programs\n\nMount Holyoke collaborates with several institutions offering our undergraduate students accelerated paths towards Master's degrees.\n\nAccelerated Master's Degrees at University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nThe accelerated master’s degree option is designed to enable students as early as the junior year of study at Mount Holyoke to seek an \"early\" (conditional) offer of admission into a broad array of specific master's degree programs at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The requirements for the bachelor’s and master’s degrees remain unchanged.\n\nThe standard application procedures for admission to graduate programs at the University apply to the Accelerated Master’s Degree Option as well. Qualifying Mount Holyoke students are encouraged to apply by November 30 of their junior year and receive a conditional admission to the Accelerated Master’s Degree Option in either the fall or spring. At their discretion, these University programs may also consider applications at any point during the student’s junior or senior year. The admission to the graduate program remains conditional until the applicant completes the baccalaureate degree and fulfills both the University's Graduate School and the graduate program’s requirements for admission.\n\nStudents begin their master's coursework by taking courses through the Five College interchange after admission to the program. Graduate level tuition and fees will be charged by the University each semester after completion of the bachelor's degree and matriculation as a graduate student.\n\nFurther information is available on the University's website.\n\nLatin American Studies Program, Five-Year Cooperative Degree Program, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University\n\nThis five-year cooperative degree program offers exceptional undergraduate students at selected institutions the opportunity to complete the requirements of both the bachelor’s degree and the master of arts degree in Latin American Studies at Georgetown within a five-year period. Qualified Mount Holyoke students should declare their interest in the cooperative degree program during their junior year and apply by May 1 of their senior year. Applicants should have demonstrated academic strength in Latin American content. For more information, contact the Chair of Mount Holyoke's Spanish, Latina/o, and Latin American Studies department. The contact person at Georgetown University is Julie Walsh, walshje@georgetown.edu.\n\nGraduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva\n\nMount Holyoke College offers a program with the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies to allow a small number of students to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Holyoke and a Master of Arts degree from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva Switzerland in five years, instead of the usual six years.\n\nParticipating Mount Holyoke students will spend the fall semester of their senior year at the Graduate Institute in Geneva participating there in the first semester of the M.A. program. They will return to Mount Holyoke for the spring semester of their senior year and for graduation and then return to the Graduate Institute in Geneva for a fifth year of study to complete their Master’s degree.\n\nThe Graduate Institute offers interdisciplinary master's programs in international affairs and development studies; these are the programs most suitable for Mount Holyoke students. The Institute also offers disciplinary master’s programs in anthropology and sociology, international history, international economics, political science/international relations, and international law.\n\nThe Graduate Institute offers an interdisciplinary master's program in international and development studies (MINT); this is the program most suitable for Mount Holyoke students, due to their liberal arts/interdisciplinary preparation. The MINT program focuses on global challenges and their systemic dynamics. Through a combination of scientific excellence, transdisciplinarity, and critical thinking, the program prepares future professionals and decision makers open to the world and able to understand and embrace complexity. Students choose a specialization from:\n\nConflict, Peace and Security\n\nEnvironment and Sustainability\n\nGender, Race and Diversity\n\nGlobal Health\n\nHuman Rights and Humanitarianism\n\nMobilities, Migrations and Boundaries\n\nSustainable Trade and Finance\n\nThe Institute also offers disciplinary Master’s programs in anthropology and sociology, international history, international economics, political science/international relations, and international law.\n\nThe vast majority of classes at the Institute are taught in English. Students with limited or no French have to study French as part of their program. To be eligible for this program, Mount Holyoke students must have a GPA of at least 3.5, must have completed 96 credits of course work by the end of their junior year, and should ordinarily be at Mount Holyoke during their junior year. Students applying for one of the Master’s programs must submit the College's Request to Study Abroad in my.mtholyoke and the separate application for Geneva to Mount Holyoke by November 30. Mount Holyoke will select the students to be recommended to the Graduate Institute, and students will need to apply to the Institute by January 15.\n\nThe fall semester of the senior year is treated like a study abroad program. For fall 2024, Mount Holyoke students pay a program fee of $11,000 which covers tuition at the Graduate Institute. In addition,students are responsible for living expenses, airfare, books, etc. Room and board are estimated at CHF 2,000/month. Students are eligible for Laurel Fellowships depending on their financial need. Students who have already received Laurel funding for a semester abroad are generally not eligible to apply for Laurel funding again. During the fifth year of study, students are responsible for covering tuition to the Graduate Institute as well as room and board and other incidental costs. The total cost for the fifth year is estimated at CHF 27,000. This includes tuition, room, and board and other expenses.\n\nMore information is available from the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives.\n\nOn This Page\n\nNonmatriculated Students\n\nAuditors\n\nNonmatriculated Students\n\nGraduate courses for nonmatriculated students are offered through Professional and Graduate Education and include workshops, seminars, institutes, and other programming.\n\nMount Holyoke also usually admits a small number of students each semester to enroll in undergraduate courses for credit as nonmatriculated (non-degree) undergraduate students. All admitted nonmatriculated undergraduate students register for undergraduate courses on a space-available basis with the approval of the registrar and the instructors of those courses. All undergraduate nonmatriculated students are subject to the academic regulations governing undergraduate students. An official transcript of their course work is maintained. They participate fully in the courses they were approved to take and qualify for student privileges related to their course enrollment. However, they do not share all campus privileges. For example, they are not eligible for on-campus housing nor for advising services.\n\nNon-matriculated undergraduates may be admitted from the following groups:\n\nMount Holyoke College Employees, Spouses, and Dependents: Mount Holyoke College employees, spouses, same-sex domestic partners, and dependent children may enroll in up to one course per semester at the College without tuition charge. Other course fees (e.g. laboratory, etc.) are paid by the employee. Tuition waivers are not available for courses offered by the Mount Holyoke Professional and Graduate Education (PaGE) program. Credit-bearing PaGE courses taken by employees may be eligible for the tuition reimbursement benefit; eligibility for this benefit is determined by Human Resources. Interested employees should review the Tuition Benefits section of the staff handbook and contact Human Resources at 413-538-2503 to apply.\n\nHigh School Students:\n\nStudents from South Hadley High School are frequently admitted to take up to one undergraduate course per semester at the recommendation of the school's guidance counselor. Tuition is waived for eligible students. Interested students must contact their guidance counselor and submit a letter of reference from South Hadley High School, their most recent high school transcript, and an application form.\n\nPioneer Valley Performing Arts (PVPA) High School typically selects up to two students per semester to take one undergraduate course each with tuition waived. Interested students must contact their guidance counselor and submit a letter of reference from PVPA, their most recent high school transcript, and an application form. Additional PVPA students, beyond the two selected by their school, are eligible to take one course per semester at 50% of the per-credit tuition for the course.\n\nHigh school students other than those from South Hadley High School and PVPA are not typically eligible to take courses at Mount Holyoke College, but they may apply and would be required to pay full per-credit tuition prior to registration. Interested students should contact the Office of the Registrar (registrar@mtholyoke.edu or 413-538-2025).\n\nTwelve College Exchange Students: Students from participating Twelve College institutions may attend Mount Holyoke for a semester or a year. Interested students should first seek information from their home campus, then contact Kat Eldred in the Office of Academic Deans at 413-538-2855.\n\nUndergraduate students from other Colleges and Universities: Students on leave from other colleges may be approved to take coursework at Mount Holyoke College. Tuition must be paid in full prior to registration. Interested students should contact the Office of the Registrar (registrar@mtholyoke.edu or 413-538-2025) for an application form. Students must provide the completed application, an official transcript from their home institution, and a letter of good standing from their dean at their home institution indicating that the student may take classes at Mount Holyoke.\n\nEducation Teacher Waiver: Local teachers who have mentored Mount Holyoke licensure students' student teaching in their classrooms within the past year are eligible to take up to four credits of coursework (undergraduate or graduate courses) in the next academic year. Interested teachers should contact the Office of the Registrar (registrar@mtholyoke.edu or 413-538-2025) to apply.\n\nAuditors\n\nA degree student at Mount Holyoke or at one of our partner institutions in the Five College Consortium may audit a Mount Holyoke undergraduate course (outside of Mount Holyoke's PaGE program), if space is available and the student has the instructor's verbal permission to audit. The student and faculty member should agree on what level of participation is expected and allowed. In any case, no record will be kept of the audit and it will not appear on the student's transcript. Because no record will be kept, degree students don't need to complete any registration procedures for audits at Mount Holyoke. Students may not switch between audit and for-credit participation in a class after the usual deadline for Adding courses.\n\nQualifying employees of the College, their qualifying dependents, and Mount Holyoke retirees and emeriti are eligible to audit one course per semester. They must qualify by submitting an employee course registration form to the Human Resources Office. The form is available from the Human Resources Office and requires the signature of the course instructor to confirm his/her approval of the audit and that space is available.\n\nMount Holyoke alums and residents of South Hadley who have earned a high school diploma may be approved by the registrar to audit one or more undergraduate courses at the College. They must submit a completed Application for Auditing to the Registrar's Office by the end of the second week of classes. Any course(s), other than those offered by Mount Holyoke Professional and Graduate Education, may be approved for audit but only if there is space available and the auditor has the instructor's signed permission.\n\nAuditors may be assessed fees for beginning language courses, dance courses, physical education courses, and studio art courses. These fees are due at the time of registration. (See also the Tuition and Fees chapter.)\n\nAuditing Privileges\n\nThere is no record kept of audited courses at Mount Holyoke, no grade given, and no credits earned. Auditors will not be counted in the official enrollment of the course.\n\nAttendance is restricted to the meetings of the approved course. Auditors do not participate in other aspects of College life and do not qualify for other student privileges.\n\nPermission to audit authorizes class observance only. Beyond that, the character of an auditor's participation in a course rest with the instructor(s) of the course. Instructors are not required to review or grade any work completed by auditors.\n\nAuditing privileges may be denied or revoked at any time. The College reserves the right to limit the number of courses audited by any one person, to limit the total number of auditors on campus in a particular term, and to change this policy."
