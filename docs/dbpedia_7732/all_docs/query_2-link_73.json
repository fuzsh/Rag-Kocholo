        "text": "Fostering youth leadership\n\nSharing the leadership values, wisdom, and lessons of Kofi Annan with the next generation is an important element of the legacy work of the Foundation. Digital tools allow us to reach young people in every corner of the globe who would otherwise not be able to benefit from his advice and that of the people who worked closely with him. Two cohorts of Kofi Annan Changemakers – young leaders from different fields and backgrounds – have now harnessed digital communications tools and platforms to improve their leadership skills and build critical capacities.\n\nContent policy\n\nThe Foundation works with civil society, electoral management bodies, and the private sector to develop capacity and tools to counter electoral-related disinformation. It is developing tools to mitigate negative foreign interference in elections and to identify elections at risk from digital threats.\n\nEthical and democratic leadership\n\nWYDE Civic Engagement Accountability Hubs brings together a group of exceptional young leaders from sub-Saharan Africa in a comprehensive digital and in-person training and networking programme to enhance their skills in ethical and democratic leadership, project management, advocacy, and communications and develop pilot actions to put their project ideas into practice with dedicated seed grants.\n\nSupporting election with integrity\n\nRegarding its activities on elections and democracy, the Foundation’s digital work is based on KACEDDA’s findings. The Commission was first established in 2018 and was composed of members from civil society and government, the technology sector, academia, and the media. The objectives of the Commission were to identify and frame the challenges to electoral integrity arising from the global spread of digital technologies and social media platforms, develop policy measures to tackle these challenges and highlight the opportunities that technological change offers for strengthening electoral integrity and political participation, and define and articulate a programme of advocacy to ensure that the key messages emerging from the Commission were widely diffused and debated around the world.\n\nIn addition to articles that deal with issues such as the interplay between democracy and the internet, the impact of digital on elections and democracy in West Africa, and the digital dangers to democracy, the Commission published an extensive report titled Protecting Electoral Integrity in the Digital Age. It addresses, among other things, hate speech, disinformation, online political advertising, and foreign interference in elections. The report proposes a set of 13 recommendations that address capacity building, norm building, and actions to be taken by public authorities and social media platforms. The Foundation is now working to implement certain recommendations, in cooperation with key stakeholders from civil society, academia, the private sector, and government.\n\nInterdisciplinary approaches\n\nBuilding a more effective architecture for digital cooperation.\n\nThe Foundation facilitates the sharing of lessons and expertise across countries to counter the negative impact of social media on elections, particularly harnessing the potential of South-South partnerships and building the capacity of civil society and electoral stakeholders.\n\nEnsuring the protection of human rights in the digital era.\n\nThe Foundation works with electoral stakeholders to mitigate the impact of online disinformation and hate speech, and to ensure threats from the digital space do not undermine citizens’ rights to political participation and that digital tools increase voters’ ability to make informed and educated electoral decisions.\n\nRaising awareness of Kofi Annan’s Legacy\n\nThe Kofi Annan Foundation uses digital tools to raise awareness of Kofi Annan’s legacy, by providing electronic access to selected speeches and quotations as well as to a collection of his papers compiled by the City University of New York on our website, and to some of his recorded statements and discussions via our official YouTube channel.\n\nKofi Time: The Podcast\n\nThrough our podcast, Kofi Time, we promote Kofi Annan’s values and their relevance today to a global audience. In our podcast, Ahmad Fawzi, one of Kofi Annan’s former spokespersons and communications advisors, examines how Kofi Annan tackled a specific crisis and its relevance to today’s world and challenges. Kofi Annan’s call to bring all stakeholders around the table – including the private sector, local authorities, civil society organisations, academia, and scientists – resonates now more than ever with so many who understand that governments alone cannot shape our future.\n\nIn the first 10-part series, Ahmad Fawzi interviews some of Kofi Annan’s closest advisors and colleagues including Dr Peter Piot, Christiane Amanpour, Mark Malloch-Brown, Michael Møller, and more. Kofi Time is available on the Kofi Annan Foundation website, SoundCloud, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts.\n\nConferencing technologies\n\nThe Kofi Annan Foundation regularly organises online and hybrid webinars, roundtables, and regional events on a variety of topics including elections in various regions of the world, youth resilience during the pandemic, violence against women in politics, disinformation, the impact of COVID-19 on democracy and elections, and more.\n\nThe Foundation makes use of digital tools including Zoom and WhatsApp to connect with our youth leaders and partners around the world and to share information about their programmes as well as speaking and networking opportunities.\n\nBoth the Kofi Annan Changemakers and WYDE Civic Engagement Accountability Hubs programmes are hybrid, consisting of online modules of learning, training, and presentations.\n\nThe Foundation holds board meetings online, with decisions on programmatic and resource matters taken by members participating remotely. We also convene our weekly team meetings in a hybrid manner as well as annual virtual meetings of our Electoral Integrity Initiative.\n\nSocial media channels"
