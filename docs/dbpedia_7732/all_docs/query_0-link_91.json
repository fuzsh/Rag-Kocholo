        "text": "Eleven leading European universities - Freie Universität Berlin (Germany), KU Leuven (Belgium), Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain), Helsingin Yliopisto (Finland), Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (France), Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna (Italy), Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie (Poland), University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom), Universiteit Leiden (Netherlands), University College Dublin (Ireland) and Universität Zürich (Switzerland) - have joined forces since 2018 in order to lay the foundations of the European university of the future.\n\nThe partner institutions are strongly committed to developing a close and sustainable cooperation, focusing on excellence and innovation in research and teaching, while improving international exchanges for students and staff members through new mobility formats (virtual, blended and physical). By moving beyond traditional geographic and disciplinary boundaries, this collaboration is intended to lead to a \"multi-campus\" university model that will provide graduates and researchers with the necessary tools to shape the future.\n\nFunded under the Erasmus+ programme, Una.Futura builds on Una Europa alliance's pilot project, 1Europe, whose activities were carried out between 2019 and 2022. Integration is the key word in this new project, which aims at bringing together all the dimensions of the alliance in terms of teaching, research and innovation. This project will give a leading role to all the players (students, faculty members, researchers and administrative staff), while setting up multidisciplinary training programmes at all levels and creating a shared research ecosystem.\n\nProject dates: December 2022 - November 2026\n\nMore information\n\nThe LLOM (\"Language Learning Online in the age of Mobility\") project was coordinated by Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University and was launched in September 2018. It aimed to improve upon the existing Online Linguistic Support (OLS) system to promote multilingualism and diversify language teaching and learning opportunities. The main goal of the project was to support exchange students through online learning tools that combine innovative pedagogical approaches and constructive gamification elements. Its second goal was to give training support to future language teachers and equip them with digital skills that they could employ in their teaching, thereby adapting material and methods for online settings, strengthening e-learning skills and ultimately ’e-teaching culture’.\n\nProject dates: September 2018 - August 2021\n\nThe OLA 3.0 project (Online Learning Agreement) was built on the tool developed within two previous projects called OLA and OLA+. The main goal of this tool was to improve the efficiency of mobility management among European higher education institutions. Considered as the future of Erasmus+ student mobility in Europe, it is a simple and convenient way to complete the learning agreement online, have it signed, receive comments from sending and receiving institutions, and have an overview of the final version of the document. 11 European partners were involved in this project, coordinated by the European University Foundation.\n\nProject dates: September 2019 - April 2022\n\nMore information\n\nThe OpenU (Online Pedagogical resources for European Universities) project was coordinated by Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, in partnership with close to 20 institutions spread across more than 10 European countries. Project members included higher education and research establishments, ministries and government agencies from across Europe, as well as networks and associations. The OpenU project was selected as a result of a call from the European Commission to create a platform for blended and online learning, academic cooperation and virtual/blended mobility. It aimed to support mobility between universities, promote online cooperation between academic stakeholders across countries and institutions by providing expertise and peer-to-peer learning. BLOOM, the European hub for blended and online learning, networking and mobility in higher education, is the main result of the OpenU project.\n\nProject dates: February 2019 - January 2023\n\nMore information\n\nThe CAMAPA project (Cadres de la Mutualité, des Assurances et de la Prévoyance à Abidjan) was coordinated by Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University in partnership with the Institut National Polytechnique Houphouët-Boigny (INP-HB) in Côte d'Ivoire. It aimed to provide training in social protection mechanisms and careers in Abidjan. Based on the CAMAP Master's degree of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, the training is now offered as lifelong learning to leaders and managers in the sector of social protection in Côte d'Ivoire and throughout the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) zone, and as full-time education to students wishing to become professionals in the governance of the health and social sector. CAMAPA was selected as part of the French-Ivorian hub for education. This hub project was set up by the French Embassy and the Ivorian Ministry of Higher Education and aimed to support joint degree projects between French and Ivorian institutions.\n\nProject dates: January 2019 - December 2021\n\nThe INDIGO project aimed to contribute to the modernisation of Guinean universities through the creation of strategic plans for higher education institutions. This three-year project was coordinated by Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, in partnership with two other European universities (Université de Liège and Europa-Universität Viadrina Frankfurt), three Guinean universities (Université Gamal Abdel Nasser de Conakry, Université Général Lansana Conté de Sonfonia-Conakry, Université Kofi Annan de Guinée), the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation, and the National Quality Assurance Authority (ANAQ). 13 other Guinean and European partners were also associated with the project, including eight universities in the Guinean regions, as well as the French Development Agency (AFD), the Belgian Development Agency (Enabel), the BoCEJ project (Booster les Compétences pour l’Employabilité des Jeunes), the Francophonie University Association (AUF) and the French Embassy in Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nProject dates: November 2019 - February 2023\n\nMore information"
