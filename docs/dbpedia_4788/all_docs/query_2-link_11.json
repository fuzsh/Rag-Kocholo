        "text": "I invite all my followers to please share this. Thanks! The Organization of Canadian Symphony Musicians has issued an excellent statement about the gimmicky 'Candlelight Concerts'. Please do not support in any shape or form the Candlelight Concerts. They are now seriously threatening local organizations struggling to recover in this post-pandemic period. We need to protect our local non-profits from this corporation based in New York. Your local orchestras can not compete with their super corporate marketing power. Here's an excerpt from the OCSM-OMOSC statement: \"Candlelight Vivaldi‚Äôs Four Seasons & More is a poor facsimile of the transcendent three hundred-year-old concerto cycle for solo violin. The soloist in the Candlelight version is, in fact, the first violinist in the string quartet hired for the event, and the pay is not comparable to a typical soloist appearance. (Note: A sample contract between Listeso Music Group, Inc. and a performer states unequivocally that no part of the work rendered by the musician will be ‚Äúsubject to the rules or jurisdiction of a labor [sic] organization‚Äù.) The baroque orchestra is represented by another violinist, a violist, and a cellist. If it weren‚Äôt for ‚Äúthe magic of a live, multi-sensory experience‚Äù in an ‚Äúawe-inspiring venue‚Äù, and approximately a thousand LED candles, even a very good string quartet performing an arrangement of Vivaldi‚Äôs Four Seasons might bring to mind the early days of cell phone ownership and the thrill of choosing a tuneful ringtone. Incredibly, it sells. The cost of admission to a one-hour Candlelight Concert is similar to a ticket to a Masterworks series symphonic concert, which is typically twice as long. While orchestras are unlikely to lose their core audience to Candlelight Concerts, what remains to be seen is how occasional and prospective attendees respond to such classical music-adjacent experiences: will it onboard new symphony subscribers for seasons to come, or seduce them with fool‚Äôs gold?\"\n\nüö® New case alert: Film Symphony Orchestra is about the #internationalisation of a Spanish-based professional symphonic orchestra with more than eighty musicians that exclusively offer cinema music concerts. üá™üá∏ Since its creation FSO had a lot of success in the Spanish territory and its founder is considering internationalizing its activity. The case looks at the different options available and the territories possible in the context of the music industry rules. üí° Pankaj Ghemawat framework is used and the #globalisation of #culture is discussed in classroom. Will be used in my elective MB-555 Global Leadership and Management at Berklee Valencia this academic year."
