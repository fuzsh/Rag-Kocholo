We offer an exceedingly broad and balanced curriculum, as well as an incredible extracurricular program. Both are enjoyed by an exceptional and diverse community of learners following personalized paths, who relish a supportive culture, the schoolâ€™s Episcopal identity, its ongoing commitment to continual self-improvement, and a deeply authentic dedication to making a positive difference in the world. From preschool to twelfth grade, our educational philosophy is to develop and expect strong character, promote innovation and growth, and desire excellence in all that we do. Berkeley motivates students to become well-rounded individuals, as well as caring and successful adults."
