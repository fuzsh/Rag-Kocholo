The facilities are great and the campus is gorgeous, but the people truly tell the story of this school. The administration as a whole cares more about its reputation than the students well being. I have a friend who was suspended for 5 weeks for defending himself against another, and the other kid got the exact same punishment. Who has ever heard of a 5 week suspension? This was basically forcing the student out because he couldn't possibly keep up with the academics of Berkeley, keeping Berkeley's reputation intact. A few years ago, a student was caught with drugs on campus, which normally results in an automatic expulsion. However, the student's family has a lot of money, so instead of giving her a fair punishment, Berkeley had the family donate money and the student got a much lesser punishment. The academics at Berkeley aren't even that great for the hefty 20,000 tuition. You would be much better off with most public schools. In conclusion Berkeley is a very political and unfair school that I do not recommend you send your child to.\n\nPosted by a student on 11/1/2017"
