Offered at no cost to students and their families for up to four summers, Aim High helps middle schoolers build academic confidence, discover a love of learning, and develop the skills they need to thrive in school and in life. In 1986, Aim High launched at one site in San Francisco with just 50 students. Over nearly 40 years, Aim High has expanded across the Bay Area in every direction, as far north as Napa, east as Tahoe-Truckee, and south as San José. This year, Aim High ran 16 summer sites and served approximately two thousand students.\n\nAim High is headquartered in San Francisco, where the management team and other central office professionals work on a regular basis each week year-round. Along with hundreds of seasonal staff, Aim High employs approximately 20-25 full-time team members, led by a chief executive officer who assumed the post earlier this year after a long history with the organization. The annual budget is approximately $7M, which is funded almost entirely by donations, grants, and partnerships. Aim High is in an excellent financial position with $20M in net assets and no outstanding debt.\n\nAim High is now seeking a relational and community-oriented VP of development to join the team. The VP of development oversees all aspects of philanthropy, which is the primary source of revenue for Aim High. The VP reports to the CEO and leads a small team of development professionals. Early priorities will include developing relationships with Aim High’s staff and current and prospective donors, in addition to working closely with the CEO to share Aim High’s mission and impact with the broader community. Aim High looks forward to welcoming the VP to start later this fall.\n\n12M & Ed Tech Recruiting is running the search on behalf of Aim High. Applications received by September 6 will receive priority review.
