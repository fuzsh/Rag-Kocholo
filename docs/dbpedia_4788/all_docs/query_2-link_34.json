        "text": "Our group guidance program provides resources and support for students throughout their years at St. John's. Highlights of the program appear below.\n\nMiddle School\n\nThe group guidance program for grades 6, 7, and 8 includes grade-level workshops, as well as smaller presentations run in conjunction with school counselors and faculty advisors. Topics for these workshops may include making the transition to the Prep Middle School to readiness for high school, personal wellness, leadership, and multiculturalism and diversity.\n\nHigh School\n\nFreshman Year: Making the transition to a new school; planning a four year academic program; learning tolerance and acceptance; practicing stress management and coping techniques; understanding the PSAT 9.\n\nSophomore Year: Self-evaluation; understanding aptitude vs. achievement; using Naviance/Family Connection to search online for career and college information; reviewing the importance of the PSAT and other standardized tests.\n\nJunior Year: Planning the college search process; searching online for college admissions information; writing an effective résumé; organizing college visits; practicing interview techniques; preparing for the PSAT, SAT and ACT.\n\nSenior Year: Keeping college admissions simple; evaluating early decision and early action options; using the Internet to apply to college; reviewing college degree requirements; sharing reflections from past Prep graduates.\n\nThe St. John's Prep Community of Concern is based on a successful model used at private schools across the nation to help prevent the use and abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by our students. Sharing resources with other private schools, the group focuses on parent and staff education, as well as peer support and curriculum development, including:\n\nStudent Assistance Program\n\nThe Student Assistance Program (SAP) team helps students deal with issues regarding mental health, alcohol and/or drug use/abuse. The team provides a support system and referral service to help students develop an understanding of themselves, their inherent dignity, and the need to accept responsibility for their actions.\n\nEducation Programs Committee\n\nThis group coordinates curriculum and educational programs for the entire school community, including parents, faculty and students.\n\nPeer Leadership Program\n\nThis group helps to develop peer leaders who work in coordination with the Education Programs Group to implement educational initiatives.\n\nGraduates of St. John's Prep go on to a diverse range of top colleges and universities every year, reflecting the depth and breadth of their interests, and our philosophy of helping students find the college that is right for them.\n\nNinety-nine percent of St. John's graduates go on to four-year colleges and universities every year. These are the colleges and universities our graduates have attended in the last five years."
