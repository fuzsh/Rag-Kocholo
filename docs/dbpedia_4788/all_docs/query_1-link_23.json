        "text": "Founded in 1960, Berkeley Preparatory School is a Pre-K through grade 12 co-educational independent, Episcopal day school located in Tampa, Florida. Berkeley educates the whole child by nurturing students’ intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and physical development so they may attain their highest potential. Our philosophy encompasses a balanced curriculum of academics and arts, clubs and activities, competitive sports and community service. An emphasis on academic excellence combined with a spirit of social responsibility sparks in students a newfound confidence and shared sense of purpose. Students exchange ideas, study virtues, and explore ethics as they define their attitudes and values."
