I took music lessons, learned to read, and my father was into Dixieland jazz, the kind of music that was made by Louis Armstrong, the kind that was popular in the 20's and 30's. So I started playing the trumpet, and I lost interest in that and started playing guitar when I was about 12 or 13. I told my father I wanted to play the banjo, and so he saved the money and got ready to give me a banjo for my next birthday, and between that time and my birthday, I lost interest in the banjo and was playing guitar. I just borrowed other people's guitars.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of musician jokes in the music world. Musician jokes are a kind of joke that usually have to do with how much money someone makes. Musicians are always starving, so they're really mean to each other about who makes what. Like, What is the least often heard sentence in the English language? That would be: Say, isn't that the banjo player's Porsche parked outside?\"\n\n\"Now, when there's so much electronic music being made, a lot of people who make great music don't actually play an instrument; they program the beats on computers and stuff, but there's a joke that goes: A car full of trombone players are driving along, and they pass a car full of frogs going in the opposite direction. What's the difference between them? Well, the frogs might be on their way to a gig. The trombone players? They're definitely not working.\"\n\n\"Right when I started playing guitar, there was a thing called a folk revival that happened about the end of the 50's, beginning of the 60's, and I got swept up in that. People were learning to play traditional music, folk songs, and that's a big field - that's everything from blues to Appalachian music. All the people who came to this country brought musical instruments, and a way of playing. Right around the end of the fifties, college students and young people in general, began to realize that this music was almost like a history of our country - this music contained the real history of the people of this country. Not so much in terms of where this battle was fought, or when this declaration was signed, but about where these people were from. These songs that were made up and passed from person to person comprised a valuable history. It's an education of sorts.\"\n\n\"And the main thing is that it was acceptable to change these songs, so that people began writing their own versions of these songs. I've written many extra verses to songs that I learned to sing - an extra verse about a friend, or just add some verse - and that led to writing my own songs. So what I do, more than play any instrument -- I mean, I love to play -- but more than that, I write songs. Songs that are about living, about what it's like to be going through all the things that people go through in life.\"\n\n\"I wrote songs about girls that I was interested in when I was in high school. I was at my high school reunion not too long ago, and I saw this girl that I had written a song for, I had literally made her sit and listen to it - it's embarrassing now, because it's a pretty corny thing to do, I guess. But at the time, I was really earnest. It didn't work. I think it might have been a little bit overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I was taking her to the drive-in. I was such a bad dater! I had no idea what to say on a date, and when her father asked me, 'Where are you going?' I went, 'The drive-in?' 'What are you gonna see?' I didn't know what was playing. So it was just such a bust. 'I don't know.' He could tell I was just gonna get next to his daughter…\"\n\n\"Anyway, that's the thing I'm supposed to be good at --writing songs. I never was a very good singer. That folk music led to learning to play, and making things up led to what turns out to be the most lucrative part of the music business -- writing, because you get paid every time that song gets played. Also, right at that particular time in the music business, because of people like the Beatles, people began owning their own publishing. I'll just say this really quickly --they used to divide the money for the music that was written in two, just equal halves. One was the money for the publisher, which was a company that licensed everyone else to use it, and the other half went to the writer. If there were two writers, they split that half in half. There were what we called 'two pennies'-- a publisher penny and a writer penny. Every time the song got played on the radio, there would be two pennies…\"\n\n\"Right around the time the Beatles began to wow everybody with these amazing songs they'd written, they began to decide, 'We don't need a publisher to tell everyone to listen to our songs. People are gonna listen. Let's just be our own publishers.' We began to keep all the money. Pretty good deal. It was a great time to be born, because I got to have my own publishing company right from the beginning, so I made more money than somebody would have doing what I did ten or fifteen years before.\"\n\n\"I'd have to say that my favorite thing is writing a song that really says how I feel, what I believe - and it even explains the world to myself better than I knew it. It's a way of examining my feelings and my perceptions and my situation and coming up with something about it, like saying where I am in the world in relation to those things. And some of the songs I wrote when I was really young are some of my best-known songs, and other people still sing 'em, I still sing 'em. The idea that I wrote something that stood for the way I feel about things, and that it lasts, that's probably my favorite thing that I've done\"\n\n\"I've also gotten to play in front of a million people in Central Park when there was a grass roots movement calling for nuclear disarmament - it was about 1982 -- they called it Peace Sunday. There was one in L.A., and there was one in New York, where a million people came to Central Park. I got to play there. I sang with Joan Baez, and Bruce Springsteen, and Orson Welles spoke - he spoke directly to the president. That was an amazing thing to do.\"\n\n\"As far as those kinds of things, I also played at the concert to call for the release of Nelson Mandela when he was a political prisoner in South Africa. We were celebrating his 70th birthday and calling for his release. Then, a year and a half later, I played at the same place when he was there with us, and he had been released. That was a magnificent thing to be a part of.\"\n\n\"And then to be backstage in this area where they had trailers, and everybody was together, and Nelson Mandela came and sort of addressed these musicians who had been so instrumental in focusing world opinion about South Africa, about his situation, and to thank us. It was really something …I mean, he had been in prison. His is a very interesting life; he is a very big inspiration.\"\n\n\"People had written songs about what was happening in South Africa. I don't know if you know the Peter Gabriel song, Biko…Unfortunately, this is something I'm glad I have the opportunity to tell you about, not because it's a happy thing, but because it's something important for you to know about. This event was seen by two billion people around the world on television, and it was seen in this country, but it was censored in this country.\"\n\n\"It was sponsored by Coca Cola, and it was seen on the Fox network, and when I came back -- it was held in England -- people said, 'Hey man, I saw you on television! That was cool -- what was that?' And they hadn't seen the introduction to Biko, where Peter Gabriel spoke of the death of Peter Biko, and his murder in detention - they didn't see the introduction that little Stephen Van Zant gave to his song, Sun City in which he talked about Shell Oil and all the multinational corporations that were really propping up apartheid in South Africa. They didn't even see the introductory speech by Harry Belafonte talking about Nelson Mandela. They literally didn't hear a word about Nelson Mandela!\"\n\n\" And that's a kind of censorship that exists in this country, because the sponsors of the television show have the legal right to do that. There was a delay. It went out live to most places, but the United States is eight or nine hours difference, so in that time, they edited it. That way, Coca Cola would not have to be involved in sponsoring what was essentially a political event calling for the release of this man. So I gotta tell you that it's been part of a long, slow realization for me that censorship exists in our country.\"\n\n\"Now it's not the kind of censorship that may have existed under a despotic rulership like the Third Reich or some of the other dictatorships. We have an open society. No one will come and take me away for saying what I am saying. But they don't have to, if they can control how many people hear it. And that's how they do it.\"Family Background\"I was the middle son. I have an older sister and a younger brother. Everybody played. My father was a pianist. While he was not a professional musician, he was very good. When I was first starting out to play, he told me, 'Don't worry about getting paid. Let everybody use your stuff. Don't worry about that.' When he was young, he had written an operetta, and the community theater in Pasadena wanted to put it on, and he wanted to get paid, but they didn't have the money to pay him, so they didn't do it. And he felt that he really missed getting an entrance into a more professional music life.\"\n\n\"But he played every weekend, in Dixieland bands. We'd go down from where we lived in Los Angeles, in Highland Park, we'd drive down to see him in Hermosa Beach play at a place called - I don't think it was the Lighthouse - I think it was The Saints, or something. And he'd play in the afternoon. He also played in the evening, but we'd go hear him in the afternoon. We were allowed to sneak into the back of this bar and we'd hide ourselves. We weren't gonna drink, but it was against the law. We felt very special.\"\n\n\"And my dad wanted me to play the trumpet because that's what he liked. His idol was Louis Armstrong. My dad thought my teeth came together in a way that was perfect for playing the trumpet. Not perfect, but better than my brother's -- he had an overbite, so he was supposed to play the sax or the clarinet, because if you had an overbite, it's not supposed to be good for the trumpet. None of these things have to do with what you like. This is what your parents think. So I had a couple of years of playing trumpet. I really enjoyed it, but it was not the kind of instrument you could whip out at a party. Let's face it.\"\n\n\"Now, guitar was pretty cool. Everybody knew something on the guitar. So I wanted to play guitar, but I told my dad if he wanted me to keep studying something, I'd like to study piano. He wanted me to stick with the trombone - he just didn't think I should switch instruments. To this day, I still have this problem, this bone to pick with my dad. I cannot believe that he wouldn't let me study the piano! I taught myself to play the piano, because I wanted to play it. By the time I did, though, I wasn't living at home, and I 'd moved on.\"\n\n\"I think my dad was proud of me, but I don't think he got what I did. When I was twelve, I really liked singing in the chorus and singing musical comedy. I came home and told him I had joined the chorus in school… to him, it just wasn't as cool as playing the trumpet, 'cause that was his generation. That's all. So when I started playing guitar and writing songs, I know that he struggled to try and find a way to compliment me, because he was very supportive of me, but I realize now that he just didn't get it. I mean, he even saw my success, and I just think he thought, 'Wow. Isn't that amazing? All these people are listening to what he has to say…'\"But he raised me to love words. I grew up reading Shakespeare and Mark Twain. And he was the kind of person that no matter what you'd ask him, he'd give you an answer with double meaning, at least two meanings. One meaning would be the specific, humorous answer; the other would be this whole other ironic double entendre - he'd just enjoy that. It was what he loved about literature, and I got that from him. So, I know he liked my lyrics.\"\n\n\"When my kids listen to house music, to me, it's like going to the dentist, though parts of it are pretty interesting. And now my oldest son -- he's been listening to electronic music for a long time -- and he's starting to make really interesting music, stuff that I find interesting, so, you know, I think the point I'm trying to make is something about authority. You can take as much as you can from the generation that has preceded you, but then it's up to you to make something new. That's maybe the most important thing each generation does, is to break a lot of rules and make up their own way of doing things.\"What Music Did You Listen to as a Teen-ager?I listened to rock & roll on the radio, and I listened to the music my dad listened to. My sister loved this doo wop - girl groups singing doo wop…you would hear a lot of this stuff if you listened to those oldie stations. My brother was a big fan of Elvis Presley. I liked him, too, but I liked comedy records. I liked these Stan Freidberg records, or satirical records making fun of some other artist…\"\n\n\"When I really started liking music was when I could play some of it myself, and after a couple of years of playing folk music, I kinda rediscovered those hits that were on the radio all the time when I was a kid. I remember when I first learned to play a Chuck Berry song like Johnny Be Good -- you've heard this…or Sweet Little Sixteen …that kind of rock and roll, you can play that with one guitar and it sounds pretty good. I remember when I realized I could do that. I'd never sung those songs, and we started singing those songs, and I realized I knew them, and I could play them and I'd never tried. I'd never used my guitar and my voice for that. I had developed playing folk music and stuff, and by that time I was also writing songs So all the music you take in now is really a part of you. It's in there. Human beings are like recording devices. You have a memory. You can program yourself to play it back, to change it, to do something different with it…\"\n\nGetting Started\n\n\"There was more nurturing going on in the sixties, because everyone was under the spell of that -- all the changes of the sixties, all kinds of awakenings and revolutions-- spiritual awareness, civil rights, political change, opposition to the war, sexual revolution -- all these things were happening. It's almost as if they've gone away now. Things have returned to a sort of material order. But I got the friendship and interest of people back then who saw some potential. They encouraged me and helped me along. And I gotta say I was happy to just coast along and work to develop myself. I wasn't in a big hurry. I made my first album when I was about 22 or 23. A lot of my friends made records when they were 18 and kind of made them before they should have.\"\n\nFor A Dancer\n\n\"I wrote the song For A Dancer for a friend of mine who died in a fire. He was in the sauna in a house that burned down, so he had no idea anything was going on. It was very sad. He was a really interesting guy. Besides being a great dancer, he was an ice skater -- he had a job in the ice follies; and he was a great tailor -- he would make his friends clothes. One time he invited this girl to the ballet, and he not only made her a gown, but he made himself an amazing suit. And they just went -- in a way, it was his way of competing with Rudolf Nureyev and Dame Margot Fonteyn. They were the ballet. He had this great spirit, and when he died, it was a tragedy to everyone that knew him. He was a painter, too, and a sculptor. He was a Renaissance man. When I wrote him the song --it's a song I've sung many times, other times when people have died -- but I was making a metaphor out of the dance. Just the idea that your life is a dance. And there's a line in it 'In the end, there is one dance you do alone.' That's one of the songs I've sung all through the years, and for me, it's like going to that place, and dealing with the fact that life will end. It's a sad song, but at the same time, it feels good to sort through that reality and touch base with it, and then go on.\"\n\n\"Music relaxes me. I love to read. I love to stretch. In the morning, I get up, and if I'm not in a hurry, I will lie on the floor on a rug, look through some books and magazines, and maybe listen to music and try to do stretching exercises to tune up. And I like to surf. Music itself is a great source of relaxation. Parts of it anyway. Working in the studio, that's not relaxing, but playing an instrument that I don't know how to play is unbelievably relaxing, because I don't have any pressure on me. I've played with some of the great slide players of all time, and it's a hard thing to do because I'm not very good at it, but I love to do it. Like surfing. I'm no good, but it's fun.\"\n\n\"The biggest influence? I've had several at different times - but the biggest for me was Bob Dylan, who was a guy that came along when I was twelve or thirteen and just changed all the rules about what it meant to write songs. He sounded like an old hillbilly. He wasn't a matinee idol looking guy - -there were times in his life when he was an incredibly romantic looking figure, and actually pretty handsome and interesting looking, -- but really, he was kind of scruffy, tons of attitude, a brilliant writer, and one of the most influential writers and thinkers of the century.\"On Writing\"You know, you have a conscious mind and you have an unconscious mind. And there's the stuff that you think when you're using your head, as they say, and there's the stuff that you think when you're not using your head that you are nonetheless thinking, but it's just below the surface. And so much music - especially the truthful stuff -- comes not from the mind that works out equations or thinks of what you're gonna do, but from the depths of your subconscious. When I write, I might trick myself by playing an instrument I don't know very well, or a new guitar. I have a lot of guitars, because each one of them makes me play somewhat differently, so I'll be playing, and when I realize I'm getting into something I like, I just turn on one of these handheld tape recorders, and then I forget about it. I just forget it's on. Occasionally, it's run out and I haven't noticed it and I just turn it back on, but basically it's like this -- harvesting ideas. And later, I usually remember what I was doing, but I'm sometimes surprised by playing back that tape. I always play it back, 'cause you never know. Sometimes, I go, 'Oh,' 'cause the mistakes are just as interesting as what I was trying to do. You go, 'Oh, that was interesting.' And I might have to listen to it over and over again to learn how to do that little mistake.\"\n\n\"Or, I just got through recording a song with a band, and it really changed a lot when I started playing it with musicians. I was playing this really simple, very infectious rhythm thing, and I was singing, but when I played with the band, my rhythm thing on my guitar didn't sound very good, and it just sort of became superfluous, and we threw it out. And then other things happened, because I kind of write in an ensemble that way, collaborating, really, and the song was finished. But then I heard this old recording of me trying to play it by myself, and I kind of liked that better. So I might actually do a version that's unlike the band version, but has stuff in it that came out of the band version but is more like the way I played it originally. I might do two versions of the song.\"\n\n\"And some stuff just didn't work at all unless I play it by myself. So the writing process is…it's all about trying to get to the truth of something and then in the end the song reflects that search for what you really think. You could surprise yourself. You wake up in the morning, and look at what you were writing that night, and…\"\n\n\"Once I woke up and I looked at something I had written, and I thought, 'No, I can't be writing about this. I don't wanna be talking about this.' I'd been reading about this and it was about U.S. foreign policy. The song is a political song. I thought, 'I just don't know if people wanna hear about this.' It was full of references to a really hard-to-take aspect about what goes on in the world, about third world economies, and imperialist countries. But in the end, I had to admit that this is what I was dealing with, what I was thinking about when I sat down to play. I wasn't trying to write a song about that. It just came out. And that's a good way of finding out what you really think. Just write and write.\"\n\n\"Some writing teachers, when they're talking about how to write words, prose, have an exercise where you just write, you sit down and start writing, the thing is to not let that pen stop, even if you say, 'I don't know what to say..' if you just keep the pen moving, you'll be united with that flow of what you really think. We all have a way of censoring ourselves, of saying what we think people want to hear, or what we think people will want to buy, what will make me look cool, what will make this girl want to go out with me, what would be a cool stance - all these manipulative things that the conscious mind thinks of…to be loved, I think, to be adored.\"\n\n\"But the truth of things is a little bit deeper. Sometimes you have to dig a little bit more. And I became quite a good editor. You let all this come out, and then you sift through it for the stuff that tells the most truth and is the most meaningful.\"Running on Empty\"That came more or less from the music first. It didn't start out with an idea I'm gonna write a song about touring. I was touring at the time, and I don't really remember coming up with that, what happened first with that…Running on Empty was an album that was much more successful than I thought it would be. It's kind of a -- one of the more famous records that I made, and I was just stalling for time while I wrote my \"important\" songs, what I thought of as my really significant contributions. I had this idea for a touring album that would be a bunch of songs about being on the road. It turned out to be much more interesting to people than what I thought of as my \"important\" stuff. So we went out and recorded this album live. It had stuff recorded in hotel rooms, on the bus …and I got to do a couple of other people's songs, songs that I didn't write.\"\n\nLate for the Sky\n\n\"No, I was trying to think of something that began with just an idea and then became a song. Oh, here's one. Okay. I have a song called Late for the Sky and it's something I said to somebody once. I was trying to say good-bye to somebody that I had met -- I had to go 'cause we were leaving on a plane -- and I said this thing -- it's maybe a little corny -- in a conversation; maybe very corny if you said it now, 'cause there's a song by the name -- but I said to this girl, 'Well, I have to go. I'm late. Late for the sky.' It was at a party, this little romantic encounter, and it's like 'I gotta go.' And it sort of stuck in my head.\"\n\n\"Well, I have a memory like an elephant, and it stayed in my head for a long time. I eventually started writing a song, trying to get to say that. I wanted to say 'late for the sky.' And between the beginning and end of the song, I wrote what I consider one of my best songs. Really. It was about a lot more stuff. There are some passages in that song that I'm really -- I'm proud of.\"\n\n\"Years later, while I was writing the song, my wife asked, 'What is this song called?' I said, 'Late for the Sky.' And it wasn't finished, but she'd been listening to me work on it, and she said, 'Late for the sky? What does that mean?' I said, 'Well, you know -- when you get to the end, and when I say it, it'll mean what I got it to mean.' And it really works that way. It goes through this whole long song, and it builds into this big emotion thing, and the very last words you hear are 'late for the sky.' And it really does mean something. It doesn't just mean that I'm late for the plane. It means that in this whole relationship that I was in, there was something that I yearned for, we never achieved-- and I may be leaving the relationship because the relationship isn't giving me that thing. It's really about breaking up, and there are passages in it that I think are -- well, if I were with my friends I'd say, 'lucky lines' -- I came across some lucky stuff.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of those passages, what I was able to get out of this metaphor. The idea of the sky. As a matter of fact, I've forbidden myself to use it anymore because I use it as an all-purpose metaphor for something, maybe some sort of spiritual fulfillment, or awakening, or the idea of homecoming, or something, but \"sky\" became this sort of word -- I mean, there's a moratorium on it now -- I can't say it anymore. I can't use it in a song because I've used it too often to mean something indefinable about reality, the reality of being. This chorus says:\n\nHow long have I been sleeping?\n\nHow long have I been drifting alone through the night?\n\nHow long have I been dreaming I could make it right\n\nIf I closed my eyes with all my might\n\nAnd be the one you need?\n\nAnd the last time it says:\n\nHow long have I been sleeping?\n\nHow long have I been drifting alone through the night?\n\nHow long have I been running for that morning flight\n\nThrough the whispered promises and the changing light of the bed where we both lie…\n\nLate for the sky.\"\n\n\"I should say that one of my favorite things about any music is ambiguity. Most people will tell you, especially in high school, 'Be clear.' But ambiguity is a wonderful thing about art. It can mean this, and it can mean that. It can mean much more than you think it means even when you write it. This may sound like cheating, but I actually find new meanings in my songs having lived longer now. I'm in my fifties, and some of the things I said that were true, are now true in a different way, even more true.\"ReligionI'm not a member of an organized religion or faith. My grandmother was Lutheran. My mother belonged to the Unitarian Church, which is a church that some of the Transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau were involved with, and it's a way of applying progressive ideas, social ideas, ideas about society, to the form of worship.\n\nBut the truth is, I am religious. I think I practice a kind of religion, though I don't have to say that I do at all. A friend of mine is director of the gospel choir of a high school l go to sometimes. He lets me come, and I love this music -- these kids are so amazing -- as a matter of fact, if you could ever get Fred Martin and his kids to come to your school, any way to make it happen, I would try to sponsor it. This music is a tremendous force in their lives; it comes from the Baptist tradition, a certain ethnic place in our culture. They're definitely singing the praises of God. But one time Fred wanted me to sing in church with them, and I said, 'I'd be very happy to. I'd like to, but you know, Fred, I'm not really a Christian exactly.' He goes, 'That's okay. That's all right.' So he gets me up there in front of the church, and I'm wearing a suit to perform one of the songs I perform with the choir, and he says, 'Now Brother Jackson here says he's not a Christian.' There's a big silence. Then he says,'Yet!' Everybody applauded.\"\n\n\"Later, another time, we're walking down the street, and he says to me, 'I don't get you - why you say you're not a Christian. 'Cause you do what Christians do.' He was talking about my activism in human rights, the environment, and especially for social justice, you know, working for kids, and I just believe in a kind of ... but I said, 'Fred, you know, Hindus believe in what I do, too.' And so does Islam, actually. Islam was founded by a prophet of God, like the prophets in the Christian religion. One of the tenets of Islam is to start taking care of the orphans, the widows, and the poor instead of having this entirely material view of life. So I said, 'Fred, yeah, it's true. I do the same things that …I believe in the teachings of Christ…but these same beliefs are held by others.' One of the things that Christianity believes that I can't really adhere to is the idea that unless you are a Christian, you won't go to heaven. That's leaving an awful lot of people out.”\n\n\"The closest thing I belong to that's like a church is a group of friends that over the course of twenty or thirty years have probably done hundreds and hundreds of benefit performances to raise funds for a variety of causes. There's no name for us. We call ourselves 'the usual suspects' or funny names like 'the bleeding hearts' -- we know about each other because we're always asking each other to do things.\n\nFavorite Place\n\n\"My all time favorite…that'll be hard. And it depends on whether you mean places to visit, or places to live. For instance, the Plains Indians didn't live in the Black Hills. They'd just go there. They would go there at certain times of the year to do certain things. They were nomadic people. I kind of aspire to live a nomadic life. I won't go on an on about this, because it would take too long, but living in one place is only a relatively recent thing for humans…the main thing about being nomadic is you can't really accumulate too much stuff. You trade your stuff, you don't hoard well -- which we're all good with. I know I hoard guitars. Or musical instruments.\"\n\n\"But to try to answer your question, I think this place. Right here. This part of California is one of my favorite places that I've ever been. I've had a place here for twenty years, but I don't live here -- I come here. And a few years ago, I made my house bigger so I could be there with friends. It used to be one big room, with a loft, and a downstairs and upstairs - like camping, you know. But once your kids grow up, everyone wants to have their own room. It's not that comfortable to be all together. So we've made an addition, and now it's a great place to come with friends, though it's still quite small. Sometimes I come up with a group of people I want to relax with -- we have a meal, we talk, we play music -- or I come by myself. Maybe the most renewing kind of thing is to be by myself at the Ranch and to spend a few days just thinking about things.\"\n\n\"The natural beauty. A friend of mine had a phrase for it. She said, 'That's called leaning up against the cheek of God.' I was trying to explain to her that when you come to my house --I keep telling you how beautiful it is, but I'm not telling you about a fabulous house. I'm telling you the house is beautiful because of where it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, those places! Those places where the house is built to see the nature. My house here was designed by an architect - a friend I've known since I was twelve, and when he and I were twelve, we used to go to Gaviota State Park with our families, and we used to dream about getting into the Ranch and going surfing. He was a little more serious than I was and would try to make it up the tracks before he was turned back by the Ranch foreman. He went to Hawaii to surf. He was serious. So when I got a place here, I called him, and said, 'Guess what I got?' So we'd go surfing here, and he became my partner, and he was the architect. So I'm living in a house built by my childhood friend and me, and that's one of the reasons I love it so much. It's just this thing we did together.\"\n\n\"But I grew up in a house that my grandfather built with his friends. And when he built it, there was nothing around there. It was a house in the country, but now it's in the middle of L.A. It was halfway between Pasadena and downtown L.A. along Figueroa Boulevard -- well, it wasn't a boulevard, it was a dirt road, and you could go about ten miles an hour in those days in a Model T. As a matter of fact, he and my dad used to camp in Gaviota Canyon… so when my dad saw where the ranch was, and where I bought, he said, 'This is where my father and I used to camp,' and they'd drive up the coast to look at the missions. That area where the State Park is was something that he named 'Browne's Pass' when he was about twelve years old. So we have some history with this area, loving this part of the country, and I'd say this is my favorite place - this is where I want to be an old guy surrounded by my kids and their kids.\"\n\n\"I've had a place at the Ranch for 22 years now. Practically the first money I made that I could keep, that wasn't to be used to invest in equipment or something like that, I bought a parcel here. That was in 1978. My business manager told me, 'Don't do that. Land is a terrible investment.' From his point of view, the idea was to make more money with that money, to invest, to build. He said, 'You can't just run out and buy something that's just gonna sit there.' I said, 'Watch.'\"\n\n\"In my opinion, it's a great investment. Even when I was younger than that, I thought it would be great to go out and buy land and not do anything with it, because so much of the land is being developed. I thought 'I'm gonna buy some land that no one will ever do anything with,' and I found that people were basically doing that here --. restricting its uses so it would stay in its natural state. It's great. More than being neighbors, aside from being near each other, the people up here at the Ranch share a similar philosophy.\"\n\n\"You all live in a beautiful place, too. Santa Ynez Valley is one of the great places on earth.\"\n\nEver Get Tired of Your Songs?\n\n“Yeah. I do. Well, I'm lucky because I actually made sure I don't tour year in year out. I get to be my own boss about this. I've had enough success to say when I'm gonna tour and when I'm gonna take time off. I made sure not to get on that success treadmill. I define success in my own terms, in terms of what I do with my time.\"\n\n\"For instance, this last year, I went out without a band quite a bit. Because I was writing new songs, I didn't want to tour very much, but I'd go out a week at a time on tour and play four or five shows and come home. By the fifth show, I was pretty sick of myself. No other instruments out there, no other band, just playing by myself. That's a challenge, playing these songs. It helps that some of these songs are pretty well known, and people are interested in hearing a cut-down, simple version of it -- that might be interesting to my biggest fans, my most dedicated fans. But really, to sit and listen to myself sing two and a half hours, three hours, for five nights -- that's just too much of me. I'd much rather have a --I have musicians who play with me when I play with a band, and they have fun with it, they change it around each night. They express themselves differently. We have a team, like a basketball team with certain kinds of moves they try to pull off, and someone will do something different, and they have to respond -- that's one of the biggest joys in music.\"\n\nWhat's a Good Fan, and What's a Bad Fan?\n\n\"No one has ever asked me that. But there is a difference, and it's interesting to me that you realize that…\"\n\n\"A good fan is somebody that really --okay, this is such a guilty pleasure, but it's somebody that really knows everything about, makes it their business to know everything about, knows all your music really well -- just listens to it. Really listens.\"\n\n\"And I think a bad fan is a kind of stalking fan. Somebody that needs something, needs you to really know about them, needs to know everything. It's almost impossible to admire somebody the way I admire the people I admire without wanting to let them know. And that's not the kind of fan I'm talking about. Like the first time I met James Taylor, he was really famous, and I wasn't. But I thought that he knew something about me because we had some friends in common, and I knew guys that played with him in his band, and they said, 'You know, James knows about that song of yours. He knows who you are.' I said, 'Really? Cool.' You just had to tell me that.\"\n\n\"So I saw James at this club, and I went up to talk to him and say, 'Hi, glad to meet you. I know Danny and Joel.' It was like talking to a post. The guy was looking everywhere beyond me. He was like, 'How do I get out of this? How do I get out of this?' And I noticed it right away. I'm like, 'Oh. I just wanted to say hi' but he wanted to split. You know? It wasn't about me, but he was in a very public place, in a club he was playing, and what happened was that somebody from the audience was comin' up to him, to probably pay him a compliment, or in some way talk to him about how much he means to them. It's a natural thing to wanna do. But there's a time when that might work, and a time when it won't. And it wasn't working.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he wouldn't even remember that. I wouldn't bother to tell him, 'Oh, yeah. The time I met you, man, you really dissed me - what's up with that?' But now we know each other. We're friends. A few years later we met in some circumstance in which there's a chance to become friends, to know each other. But the fan that really needs to get something, get your attention -- I don't believe in that. I would think the music should be enough. You know?\"\n\n\"And I always felt that way. When Bob Dylan was the most important person in the world to me, I remember reading something. I read everything that I could about him, and one of the things he said was how people shouldn't put anybody up on a pedestal. Really, that's an unfair thing to do. I wouldn't want anybody to do that to me, and I wouldn't do that to the people I admire. You wouldn't idolize him. Don't make him into a hero.\"\n\n\"So every time I met Bob Dylan, and there was a bunch of times, I just really made it a point not to fawn over him or even tell him that it was a big deal. It was a big deal. It was a big deal for me. I think now that I was kind of a fool about this. I should have at some point said something, or done something to become friends with him. Even though I kinda knew from the beginning it was impossible. This is a guy that was like the voice of a generation, an icon…no, I don't think I can; we're not gonna become pals or something, you know…\"\n\n\"One time I was even in a place -- this was years later, I've met him so many times now -- he's sitting in this place, we were both at this party, and I was just lookin' at him, and I was talking to this guy who works with him, and he's saying, 'Do you ride a motorcycle?' I said, 'No.' He goes, ''cause you know Bob rides a bike, and I'm always kinda lookin' for someone to go riding with Bob.' I'm just lookin' at him, and I said, 'Do you think he would wanna hear just how much he's meant to me over the years?' The guy looks at me like…'Don't do it, man. Do not blow it. 'Cause he's comfortable right now. He's having a good time. He's watching something else go down, and he's included here, and he's not up on some ridiculous plateau that people put him on.' I said, 'Of course, you're right. What was I thinking?'\n\n\"It's been that way for me many times. And just recently I had a stalker situation where somebody had built me up to a place in their mind, and it became a problem, actually. It was a person who is mentally ill. It involved the police and stuff. Yeah. The fans who want more than the actual work. It's a mistaken notion to become obsessed with another person's life.\"\n\n\"But you see, we live in a time when that's encouraged. The celebrity industry. The tabloid media and all the celebrity shows, Lifestyles and the Rich and Famous -- when you think about it, probably more than half of what's on television is selling you some notion of 'there are some beautiful people someplace, and you can find out about them, and you can be like them if you tune in, and you can buy stuff that they buy, be where they go, go where they go…' That's all crap. That's complete and utter crap. That's to say that their lives are more valuable than yours. They are trying to convince you that you don't really have a life unless it's on television or in some way viewed as a famous thing-until finally, you have people that are merely famous for being famous rather than for some real contribution that they've made. There's a lot of that.\"\n\n\"Anyway. Good fan - Japanese fans. Japanese fans because if you're a fan of mountain climbing, and you're Japanese, you know everything about it. There's something about that culture - they make it their business to know everything. There are blue grass groups in Japan playing banjos and mandolins and wearing country clothes, and they're playing faithfully executed blue grass. They are a country of people who go collect things and bring them back. And so there's a Japanese equivalent to most famous things in the world. I know the guy who used to be the Japanese Jackson Browne, and he and I are friends now. He moved on. He became the Japanese Bruce Springsteen after awhile, which meant he imitated me for a time, then decided to go imitate Bruce. I think he may have become himself eventually, because it isn't as if they don't understand what it means to be original -- Japanese culture is full of things that are very original! It's just that it's okay with them to be a disciple. They have masters - they say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so there is a period of time, when might be more humble to say 'I am just an imitator' when you actually are quite good. They might think it audacious or wrong to aspire to being a creator. That might be a little too full of yourself. So they're serious about stuff like that, and when they appreciate you they really treat you with the greatest respect and the most gracious acts. It's awe-inspiring to go to a country like Japan and be treated like an artist, when in the United States you're kind of treated like a commodity, something new, a fad.\"\n\nHave You Ever Felt Embarrassed About Being On Stage?\n\n\"I'm not really nervous about going on stage. I stopped getting nervous. It's rare now. As far as embarrassing, all kinds of embarrassing things happen. But the best you can do is put those feelings aside, because what makes performances really good is when you erase the barrier between audience and performer. For instance, I don't know if you can imagine singing a song that you wrote, and getting to the middle of the song and not be able to remember the words, especially in a really climactic emotional moment. You get to this part where everybody knows the song, and you just stop because you've forgotten the words…that's embarrassing! That's happened to me.\"\n\n\"But actually, the audience loved it. They thought it was so funny. You can't do it a lot, but audiences like it when you turn out to be kind of human. You goofed up. If it really made you uptight, that would mean you wanted not to be human, you want to be perfect. It's better to be imperfect. Then you're in the same place together. Then to forget something is not a big deal. You have more intimacy.\n\n\"There's funny embarrassing, and then there's other kinds. My mother gave a bunch of my baby pictures to an unauthorized biography once. This guy lied to my mom, very shameful. Bad guy. He lied to my family, saying he's writing this book with me, and they just believed him. They didn't call and ask, 'Hey, you want us to cooperate with this guy?' They just did it. So that was a deeper kind of embarrassment. Because it was like they gave some sort of family approval for what was really a very badly written book, and when I would try to explain how that happened, I had to deal with the fact that I wasn't very close with my mother and my brother at that time in my life. That was deeply embarrassing to have to say, 'My mom and my brother didn't know enough to ask me about this, and I haven't seen them in awhile' That's terribly embarrassing to me. I remember really being unhappy. I said, 'I can't believe you did that!' But we got through it all right.\n\nAdvice for Kids\n\n\"I'm honored to be able to speak to you-- you're future leaders; you're already making decisions, taking initiative. Keep doing it. Ask a lot of questions. You have every right to ask. Don't be afraid of asking the wrong question. You have to ask the questions. I would encourage you to examine everything, find out for yourself. Other than that, I'm pretty unqualified to give advice.\"\n\n\"My generation made a lot of mistakes, but it was all part of the same impulse to be the one to decide, and a reaction against the kind of strictness we were subjected to. Question authority. Just ask the question. Don't always do the thing you're told, because they will take advantage of you -- \"they\" being political leaders, businesses, corporations. They prey on the people who just do what they are told. They want obedience…they want to convince you that you are not even a person if you don't buy whatever it is they are selling. And they are very cynical about it. Corporations have no conscience about the environment, human rights, rights of consumers…they do it because they can get away with it. As much as I love the world, I know it's also full of people who think they have the right to do that. There are fights in the world. There are some fights that are coming your way. Don't back down from what you know is right. In the end, you are the one to decide what's right and wrong.\"\n\nRichard Cunningham has been an inventor since childhood. His irrepressible spirit, love of life, and stunning creativity have led him through colorful adventures involving airplanes, motorcycles, bicycles, horses, journalism, bad guitar playing, and plenty of pain and ecstasy in the great outdoors. In 1981, he founded his own bicycle company, Mantis, whose bikes are well known for the \"magic feel\" of their ride. Richard is currently the editor of Mountain Bike Action magazine. In his spare time, he has been building an airplane - it's almost ready for its first flight. Here he is, in his own words:\n\nAirplanes are my first love. My mom told me she'd give me fifty bucks if I could build an airplane that would fly. I had no idea what it would take to build an airplane. Actually, I did have an idea, but it wasn't right. I made all sorts of contraptions with wings, and I covered the wings with old shower curtains, and I used skateboard wheels, which at the time were made out of steel. I took all this stuff to the largest hill in the city of Fullerton, where I lived, and then I would sit on it and go down the hill and bounce up and down, but I never took off.\n\nI was always picking through the trash on my way to school to find parts for an airplane. One day, I found this huge patio umbrella. It was made out of lightweight cloth, and it had a bamboo handle and steel ribs that came out from it, so I took it and stashed it behind the school. After school, I bent the front to make it look like an airplane wing, and I broke the handle off, so it was really little, and I could hold the handle with my legs, and the top of the umbrella was right above my head.Fullerton is in the north of Orange County, right at the mouth of a canyon, and we had these incredible Santa Ana winds. You know when they build new homes how ugly they make everything with those huge embankments? Well, behind my school, we had one of those that was probably 200 yards long, and the wind blew right up against it, howling. I went up to the top of the hill, and I knew. I knew I could fly. I knew it would work. I would run as fast as I could and jump off the top of the hill when the wind was blowing. But I just crashed my brains out all the way down.\n\nThen on my fifth try, I caught one just right. I was a little kid -- it picked me up, and I stayed about this high off the hill almost to the bottom. When I hit the bottom, I landed on the umbrella and cut myself to pieces, and the umbrella was shredded, but that was the first time I ever flew. I was so excited! I went home and told my parents, and my mother never did believe me.\n\nBut I've loved airplanes all my life.My dad worked in aerospace in secret projects back in the days everyone thought the Russians were going to drop a nuclear bomb on us. His life was entirely secret. He would go, he would come back, and he would work with slide rules (this was before computers) and draw things, but he could never talk about it, not until much later in my life, when I was in my thirties. That's when my dad built a little airplane, an ultra-light. You don't need a license if you make an airplane that flies slow enough, only takes one person, and weighs less than 250 pounds, so he built one. None of us knew how to fly. But we went out to this big dry lake, and we'd just sit in it. Sit in the airplane, hit the gas, and just try to fly level with the ground this high until you feel good about it, and then you take off and go.\n\nSo I learned how to fly just like the Wright Brothers. I didn't have flying lessons. Once you take off, once you pull back on the stick and it goes up in the air, it feels like the ground falls away. Anyone who's ever flown on an airline knows how that feels, except that the pilot on an airliner knows what he's doing.Anyway, the dry lake is perfectly flat…as flat as the flattest freeway…six miles long and two miles wide. But at seventy miles an hour, you run out of six miles really fast. And I didn't know how to turn, and my runway, this giant runway, was behind me, which is bad luck in flying. So I just tried to remember what I'd read in the book - ten miles, it took me ten miles to turn around- and then, when I saw a beautiful lake below, I thought, \"That's really cool!\" and just when I got all relaxed and thought I was gonna land, I passed it again. Ten miles, 400 feet above the lake, and I couldn't tell where we were parked. All I saw below were motor homes with motorcycles next to them. They all looked beige from the top, and very tiny. But after awhile, I made this perfect landing, and that was it. I was thirty-five. It was the scariest and most beautiful moment of my life.\n\nThe bicycle is the closest you can get to an airplane. If you can ride a bike -- you know how you lean and turn? -- you can fly an airplane.But the reason I got into bicycles is like most kids. It's the first thing you get that gives you the freedom to leave home and go just about anywhere in the city. When you get your first bike, and you realize that in fifteen minutes, you can be five miles away, that's a huge distance. I don't know if any of you guys ever went cruising around on your bicycles and just exploring, but when I was a kid, where I lived in Orange County, it was like here in the Santa Ynez Valley. Now it's covered with homes and the Disneyland Matterhorn is visible about fifteen miles away…but in those days, it was all orange groves, and little tiny paved streets, and dirt roads, and hills. I was pretty much a solitary kid, one of those boys you see all by himself playing in the dirt somewhere. That was me.\n\nSo when I got my first bicycle and my parents would allow me to actually leave the street, it was freedom. I rode for miles. That's the reason I like bicycles so much. It's just you and the road.\n\nBicycles were the first non-powered things I fell in love with. My entire life, even as a child, I loved anything that had an engine and wheels on it. I built go-karts from old lawn mowers that were just pieces of wood with sticks and wheels nailed onto them and fan belts to get 'em along. I crashed my brains out in a million different ways. And back then, police didn't give you tickets for riding on the street, so I built race cars, and hop-up stuff for race cars - I had everything you can imagine.\n\nOne day I went back to that same hill where I used to take my airplane. I figured I could just roller skate down this entire hill. Everything seemed perfect. Of course I can do this! It just seemed so natural. Back then there were only two kinds of roller skates: the kind that had clay wheels that looked like plastic, and the kind that had steel wheels. I had the steel wheel kind. So I tightened them up and went way up to the top of the hill. All of my friends showed up - I thought they showed up to see this miracle high speed run I was gonna do, but really, they only showed up because they knew I was gonna eat dirt.I had a red scarf that I'd made out of torn sheets, and I was so confident that I would just fly down this thing. I started off nice and easy, going pretty good, my feet were kinda moving a little bit, but I was still okay. Now I start going really fast, and now I'm beyond the point where I can fall, and I can't run. I'm really beyond anything. I knew I was in trouble. The skates were steel, and on the asphalt, they vibrated so hard, it hurt my feet. It was like somebody was pounding nails into the bottom of my feet.It's getting worse and worse, and I'm going too fast. What am I gonna do? I'm not gonna make it to the bottom. I was gonna crash in a second. So I was gonna jump. I just leaned a little bit.\n\nBut ever feel so afraid that you just lose all power in your body? It feels like somebody stole your ability to move, like in a bad dream. That's it. I hit the curb with my skates at an angle, bounced off the roots of a big tree, and just sailed into the parking lot of the Catholic school.It took me months to heal. I stuck to the sheets for months. Every part of my body was dripping.\n\nI had a lot of little crashes, but that's my first good one. Later, I broke my hip testing motorcycles. You had to test every kind of motorcycle that was ever made. I was racing through the roads around town, and I just fell. The motorcycle was sliding and skidding and it slid and pinned me between the curb and the motorcycle and it cracked my hip, and there's nothing you can do for a cracked hip but just heal. I was on a cane for almost two years.\n\nI raced motorcycles for many years, up to the time I was about twenty-two, I was racing them on the dirt. I loved it. I used to go trail riding in a certain place in the desert. When I first went to this place, it was beautiful. There was a creek over here, bushes everywhere, and a little place to park your car. Well, I kept coming back as time passed, and thirteen years later, it was just a couple of bushes and all dirt. One day I realized that we had done that. We had ridden our motorcycles around the bushes to the point where those got destroyed, and everything just became dirt. And I thought, \"You know? I've spent most of my life making race cars, building motorcycles, and making motorcycles faster. But there's got to be an end to this. I'm not doing something that's making the world better. It's making it more fun, but if you look at my space…I went here because it was beautiful, and now it's denuded.\"\n\nThis was an important realization for me, and it involved my livelihood. I had a shop, I worked for other people, this was my living. But I kinda started thinking about it then. And several months later, I was under an expensive race car welding little exhaust parts onto it, and a ball of metal that came off the weld fell down and landed on my private parts. Now when a hot ball of metal lands on skin, it bounces around and leaves thousands of little pock mark burn holes, and I couldn't just run away, I was under a car, and I had a welding torch in one hand, and I just had to wait it out. And that's when I knew that I didn't want to participate in this world anymore. There are enough people who make cars, enough people who think cars are the coolest things in the world. I wanted to do something that made a better world.I kept my shop, but I closed it up, and I went rock climbing and mountain climbing for a couple of months and just did nothing, and when I came back, I got a job in a bike shop. I still loved bicycles. And that's how I started out. I worked for a dollar seventy-five an hour or something like that assembling cruisers with air wrenches in the back of a Schwinn shop. No one ever saw me. I was just a noise in the back.\n\nSo I went from being this guy that had his own business, to the lowest of the low at this cheesy bike shop in Fullerton, but I loved it. And some time later, I got a job at a place called Medici Bicycles, and they made custom road racing bikes. I started riding road bikes and ten speeds, and I even wore the little fruit outfit - like is that a real man, or is that a fruit advertisement? I loved it, but eventually, I ran out of places to ride on the road, for a hundred miles in every direction. 'Cause once you're fit - I was riding 200 or 300 miles a week during the hot season - once you're that fit, you've ridden everywhere there's pavement for a hundred miles in every direction.\n\nNow I started connecting the dirt roads with a road bike. I'd go over the mountains on these skinny dirt roads and I found out I liked that even more. But the whole time I was going down these sandy fire roads on these tiny little road bikes in my fruit outfit, passing four wheel drivers and motorcycles, I was thinking wouldn't it be cool if I had big tires and motorcycle handle bars and all the other stuff? And then years later, I heard of this guy named Monte Ward who had gotten one of the first mountain bikes from Northern California. He was riding on all the dirt roads. So I thought, \"I'm gonna build me one of those things.\"\n\nWhen the right rims and the right tires came out, I was already working at a bike company. I just went back to my shop, and I made my first mountain bike, the first Mantis. It was 1981. From then on, I never rode the road again.That bike looked great, but it needed to be taken for a real ride. Monte was going out to do what at the time was considered one of the hardest climbs in Orange County, and this was a good opportunity to ride along with him on the beautiful red Mantis, but I was totally out of shape, so I wanted someone else to ride. I didn't believe I could stay with the mythic Monte, best climber in Orange County, the man everyone deferred to when it came to mountain biking. I had heard so much about this guy. When I met him, I was completely intimidated. I think we had three words, and then my friend rode up there with him and came down and said that my bike handled the worst of any bicycle he'd ever ridden in his life.\n\nEventually, I started riding with Monte, and he basically took me on my first awesome mountain bike ride. We climbed a lot, we carried a lot, and got back at night, so I think I learned that through Monte. We eventually became friends, and that will probably last for the rest of our lives.\n\nI don't own that first bike anymore. I was so poor, that I sold almost everything I had for the first ten years. Everything I could sell. I sold a '56 Ford pick-up truck, which now would probably be worth a hundred thousand bucks because they're the vintage, \"must have\" truck. I sold it for $300 because I had to pay rent. So then I didn't have a car, and I rode my bicycle, and then I needed to pay rent again, so I sold my mountain bike to pay rent for that day. When you're in business, and you're barely making it, you have to have money, so whatever it takes. Basically, if you were my children, and you weren't working at the bike shop, I would consider selling you just to pay the rent.\n\nBut it was an exciting time. Have any of you been part of a new sport, something that just starts out? Like snowboarding, or something like that? Here's the deal. When a sport first starts out, it's so new, just doing it is really fun. When I first started making mountain bikes, there were no boundaries. A mountain bike could be anything you could ride on the dirt. Nobody knew what made a good mountain bike, or what made a bad one. So I had a chance to experiment with different tubing, different types of arrangements that made a bike go faster or climb better, and it made a big difference each time I discovered something new. It made a huge difference in what you were able to do. If you bought one of my bicycles in comparison to the other ones, you might find that this thing climbs better than some other cheesy brand, or maybe it goes downhill ten times worse than Tom's bike.\n\nBut each bicycle has its own personality, and it's in the technology. That's what I was participating in. It wasn't just bicycles. I was participating with a very small group of other men and women who were making bicycles all over this country. We were creating a new sport. It was like we discovered gold in California and nobody else knew about it. So the fun was in the making of the bicycles and the building of the sport.We went to all the biggest bike shops from Santa Barbara to San Diego trying to sell our bikes. And you know what they told us? We can't sell a $1200 beach cruiser. And they threw us out. We didn't sell one bike. And these are the bike shops that are now considered the mountain bike centers of their communities. That's how new it was back then. So we put on slide shows just to sell bicycles. There were slides of us riding downhill, and standing next to sunsets and stuff. They would look really goofy now, but we actually did slide shows to tell people about mountain bikes.\n\nBut the reason I stopped making mountain bikes was because at that time the small builder- designer-engineer guys began to have less of a role to play. Here I was making maybe 500 frames a year, and companies like Specialized and Nishiki are making 20,000 and 30,000 bikes at a time. So there wasn't as much need for a small manufacturer like me as there was for a large manufacturer to produce big numbers for less money. My bicycles cost at the time $2500 each and you could buy a fully equipped bicycle with the same amount of parts for about $700 or $800. So I looked at it and I went, \"You know? It's time to do something else.\"\n\nThe editor job came up when I still had a bike company. My friend Zapata Espinoza quit his magazine job and moved to another magazine. My wife said, \"You've been looking for something to do. You should try for that job.\"\n\nThis is really funny, too. I didn't know how to type. I got Fs and Ds most of the time in school. I don't know how to spell. I didn't know how to use the computer. All the skills an editor needs to know. But I did know a lot about mountain bikes. So I called up the magazine and said, \"You know, Zap's leaving. Why don't you put me on the list?\"\n\nAnd the next day I got the job. Now I had a company to sell, and I had all that stuff to learn, like how to write stories without knowing how to type. In one year, I had to learn everything about magazines, how to use the computer, and all the stuff that went with an entirely new job. I think it was the biggest change I've made in my life in any one day…other than being born.\n\nI've been there for eight years now. It's the greatest job on earth. I get to ride bicycles and travel all over the world to do that, to ride bicycles in the national parks in Switzerland, or somewhere in Brazil. I can go anywhere I want, pretty much, wherever they ride bicycles, and then I can just go home and write stories about it, and I get paid to do that. It's a great job.It's easy to write about bicycles. You see a bike, you ride it, and then you talk about it, or type about it, like you were telling your best friend. That's the easiest way to write a story, like you're writing to your best friend. But in my own column, the first page of the magazine, you're supposed to be brilliant in just one page. And sometimes, I just don't have anything to say, so I break it up. For two times, I talk about something that's important, or something technical, something I like or something I hate -- that's kind of political-- and the third time, I just tell a cool story. The last story I wrote was about me when I was about four and a half feet tall, digging through the trash and getting in trouble in Catholic school, and having the nuns yell at me.It's challenging to try to write a one-page story because you have to take out a lot of stuff that you think is important. It's easy to go on and on like I'm doing right now, boring you to death, but if I had to say everything in one paragraph, I'd really have to think it through. So that's it. A one-column story is a lot harder than anything else to write.\n\nMountain bikes are just about enjoying yourself. A new generation has discovered mountain bikes now and just uses them for localized stunts and fun stuff. It's like the skateboard crowd where you just hang around a certain area and do like drop-in and all that stuff. They do the same thing but on more natural terrain, and that's the cool thing now.Free ride is the hottest thing in bikes today. It's a heavy-duty mountain bike with long travel suspension, primarily used for downhill, but you can still pedal it when you have to. It's popular for same reason as snowboarding. You can do all sorts of tricks, ride difficult terrain, and even though you can't use it for extended cross-country, it allows someone to just go out and play.Where are bikes headed? Forty or fifty years ago, there were the old Schwinn cruisers, no gears. We're kinda going where it was back then. At one time the mountain bike was the coolest thing in the world, not because you could ride on the dirt. It was because when you went to a bike shop and asked for an expensive light weight bike, they used to give you a 10-speed with stupid handlebars and a little skinny seat that was more like a butt wedge, but that was the only place you could sit. And the tires were so skinny that the first time you dinged 'em they would go flat. So what happened was you had a bicycle that was uncomfortable to ride, everybody hated it, and it was stashed in the garage because it had flat tires.When mountain bikes came out, they had upright bars, comfortable seats, and the tires were big so if they had a leak it would still hold air for awhile. So suddenly, everybody had the bicycle they were begging the bike shops for, even though they never rode them in the dirt. Now mountain bikes have been around for a long time, and they really are bicycles for the dirt, not just ten-speeds with fat tires.\n\nSo when you go to a bike shop, they don't say, \"You need a mountain bike.\" They say, \"What are you gonna do with it?\" So you say, \"I'm just gonna ride on the board walk and pick up chicks.\"\n\nSo they say, \"You don't want a mountain bike, you want one of these comfort bikes. They look kind of butch, but they've got skinnier tires, the seat's comfortable, and the handle bar's even higher.\"\n\nMountain bikes spurred everyone to go out and reinvent cycling. And rediscover it. But now that everyone's riding again, they don't necessarily want a mountain bike, and mountain bike sales have gone to one third what they were. (And so have the sales of my magazine, by the way.) Everyone realized they don't want to go out in the dirt; they just want a cool, comfortable bike. The market realized that, too. It's specialized. You can buy a bike for any purpose.\n\nAs you get older, you have a higher tolerance for pain, so you can do longer and longer rides because you know you're not gonna die. The hardest thing I ever did lately was a twelve-hour ride in the Los Padres forest. The trail I was looking for was mis-marked on the map. I missed the junction I was supposed to take, and I ended up climbing through the bushes for four hours. It was dark when I got back onto the ridge. On the way back, the short way was to the right and the long way to the left. I met a Jordanian man with his child on the dirt road, and I said I was going to the right, and he said, \"No, you do not want to go that way. It is very steep.\"\n\nBut I said, \"I know, but I just climbed up an entire mountain carrying my bike.\"\n\nHe says, \"No. That may be a road on the map but it is very steep.\"\n\nI was with a friend. I said, \"We're gonna do it anyway.\"\n\nHe said, \"Is okay with me, but now you will know the meaning of steep.\"\n\nSo I walked up the steepest road I have ever been on in my life. There were motorcycle tracks that went off the road and into the forest because it was too steep for motorcycles. I was so tired. And when we got back to the car, my friend had forgotten the keys to the car! We'd started twenty miles away; we were supposed to end up at this other vehicle. No keys. We had to call a locksmith and have them make the keys to get into the car. We were starved, we were cold, we were in our shorts, and it was the middle of the night.\n\nI only have three friends who will go out on rides with me anymore. The rest of them say no. They call it a \"Richard ride.\" It isn't a Richard ride unless it's dark when you get back, and you are lacerated by bushes. There has to be a considerable amount of pushing, and you have to get lost at least once. I used to think that was a joke, but when I look back on all of my favorite rides…they are like that.\n\nThat's the whole thing about being outside. No stores. When something goes wrong, if you don't have it in your bag, you walk or you spend the night. But you really explore. You see a lot of stuff that you'd never in your life see, even when you're miserable. It's cool.\n\nOne time we were carrying our bikes for twelve miles into a canyon near a creek, one of the most spectacular places I've ever been in my life - at every bend, a swimming pool with waterfalls, piles of turtles on every rock, and a bear ahead of us the whole time. His footprints were filling up with water when we went through the crossings. The water was so deep, we had to carry our bikes over our heads, or we had to swim across. It took us twelve hours to get through the canyon, but that was one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen in Southern California. There were Indian caves with all their stuff still there, the rocks they had used to grind acorns, totem rocks, everything still arranged like they had just left yesterday. It was unbelievable.\n\nThere's no such thing as modern times. Less than a hundred years ago, the last of the Chumash Indians were driven from their ancestral villages. They were stone age people. They didn't have clay pottery - they wove their baskets and carved everything out of rock and they had flint tools all the way into the era of steam engines, and when the Wright Brothers were flying their first airplane. And when they grew up, they wanted the same things we want: they didn't want to die without making a difference in the world, they wanted to be loved, they wanted to have babies, and do the stuff we do, just in a different form. They had the same questions. So there's no such thing as modern times.\n\nMy advice…and I'm still struggling with it a little bit…is that there's a lot of stuff you're expected to do but you should really concentrate on what you want to do, what really makes you the most excited about life. And if that means getting fat and having babies and raising kids, or if it's putting roofs on houses, that's fine - because there's honor in doing what you want to do and doing it well.I really wanted to make bikes and get a job in the bike industry and make a difference by doing this, and the whole time I was at Mantis, for the first ten years, I never made more than ten thousand dollars a year. I was poor the whole time. And my dad and my friends said give it up. You've tried hard; you've done a good job; just give it up. But I really wanted to do it. And somehow, because I just kept working at it, I found an angle that worked, and it was really fulfilling.\n\nSo never downplay something you really believe in, something that really makes you happy, because that's where you're the most creative. When you're doing something you really enjoy, you get that spark of creativity, and that's what drives the human soul. Make a difference, and feel good about it. Don't lose that one thing, even if it's contrary to everything that everyone else says -- keep it alive, and you'll find that it will take you to the next step.\n\nAnd the other thing is I'm not telling you to only do things that come easy, because I would have never gotten the job at the magazine if another thing hadn't happened shortly before, and that is a guy named Jay who had a bike shop walked into my shop at Mantis and gave me a Fender telecaster electric guitar. Now I can do a lot of things really well, but I suck at the guitar. I have no rhythm, I sing like a crow, and my fingers don't fit on a guitar. Suddenly here's this instrument, and it was beautiful. It was the most gorgeous guitar I've ever seen, and I've been around music a lot, and I sat down and started to play it, and I was horrible. I had to buy the lowest level books, and I had to go through them and work really, really hard just to play bad, and it was humiliating. It was humiliating to be so bad, because some of the guys at Mantis, like Eddie, the tall guy, were musicians, in a band, and it came easy for them. It was humiliating to learn something from the ground up at thirty-nine years old that everyone around me knew really well, and then to have to work hard just to be bad at it. These guys were singin' and jammin' really well while I was just figuring out the chords.\n\nSo then, when it came time for the magazine job, the editor job, which was really a cool deal, I didn't know anything about computers, and I didn't know how to type, I didn't know anything about the magazine, but I'd just learned how to play the guitar. And I realized that day that it wouldn't be any different. I'd just go in and start with the basics, and learn it, just like I'd learned the guitar, and it led to this.\n\nSo I'm not telling you to do things that come easy for you. I'm just telling you to follow your dreams and do whatever it takes to be able to do what you want to do, even if it means humiliating yourself and learning something you're bad at. And I still love guitars. I play every day, and I still suck.\n\nNovember's slightly breathless light drenched the hills and fields that morning as we drove along Highway 1 towards Lompoc. The sixth grade students of Vista de las Cruces School were about to meet and interview the legendary A. Dibblee Poett at the Casa San Julian. One of the few Spanish land grant ranches still owned by its founding family, San Julian Ranch is located just up the road from Las Cruces, where the Santa Ynez Mountains become the Santa Rosa Hills.We turned off Highway 1, rattled along a dirt road, and parked in front of the casa. \"Dibbs\", as he was affectionately called, pulled up in an old Mercedes, his dog by his side. He wore a straw hat, tweed coat, and gray flannel trousers -- rather dapper, I thought. Walking carefully with a cane, he led us into the house.\n\nThose of us who live in the embrace of this nurturing land need to know its history, hear its voice. The ninety-year old Dibblee Poett is a part of this history, and our students recognized the importance of the stories he might share with them. They had come prepared with questions -- kids' questions about best friends, Christmas mornings, school, and special places.\"This is my special place,\" said Dibbs. \"The old house. It has so many memories. When we were children, my sister and I used to ride a lot here. We rode bareback-- very light-- and the horses used to get over the hills very easily. As we got older, we had to put on saddles, and so the hills got steeper than they were when we were young.\"\n\nWe sat in his favorite room, a room lined with books and paintings and old photographs, a room filled with the past. Pale sunlight streamed through lace curtains and lit upon the flowered wallpaper. There were Victorian chairs with carved wood frames and red upholstery, Oriental rugs worn to threads, and an eccentric chandelier -- \"a relatively new addition\" -- adorned with crystals in colors like amber and green. There was nothing fussy or proper about the room, and it lacked the muted sadness that one often senses in such places. Yesterday could laugh and linger here, feeling safe.\n\n\"It was too cold to live here in the winter,\" Dibbs went on, looking fondly about the room.\"A man used to bring in wood. He spent most of his time cutting and hauling and bringing in wood for the ten fireplaces and emptying the ashes out. It took a while to get the house warm because the ceilings are so high, but once it was warm it would stay warm because the walls are so thick. We did stay here in the winter of 1918 during the war when there was an influenza epidemic. People thought they'd come to the ranch to escape the influenza, and then one of our tenants down the road died from it because he couldn't get to the doctor... so we figured we'd better get back to town.\"\n\n\"The ranch is about 16,000 acres now,\" he informed us. \"It was 48,000 acres when it was deeded to my great-great-grandfather in 1837. Then they lost it in 1862 after the big drought. It didn't rain for two years, and all the cattle died, so the sons lost the ranch. Then Mr. Dibblee and Mr. Hollister came along, and Mr. Dibblee married the granddaughter of the original owner, so it came back into the family again.\"We were all a little awed by the old man. We had been forewarned that he could be cantankerous, but we found him to be gentle and patient. His voice was tremulous at times, and he frequently asked the children to repeat their questions, but he seemed genuinely eager to talk. When he spoke of his childhood, his angular face would visibly soften; he seemed to savor the details of those fine days, as though reliving them in the telling.\n\n\"Oh! We climbed trees,\" he told us, \" That was one of the things we liked to do, and we never fell. Yes, we used to climb trees, my sister and I, and we would go barefoot, believe it or not, all around, all the time. After awhile your feet get calloused so you can go almost everywhere. We wore great big straw hats, and one day we were walking along and we happened to get into the middle of a patch of little prickelotas ---somehow before we knew it we were into it-- so we had to throw our hats down to get out.\"\n\n\"And we used to ride a lot when we were young. Nan and Frederica and I were each given a horse, horses that were not very good for the ranch hands because they'd been cut in the wire, or something like that. I had a horse once and he had a wire cut, and whenever he was going from home he always limped, but on the way back he never limped.\"\n\n\"One day we were riding and we got into a nest of yellow jackets, and they got all around us. I jumped off the horse and was running around a bush about the size of this room. The bees were following me, and the horse was following me, and I couldn't get away, so I jumped into the middle of the bush!\"The kids wanted to know what kind of wildlife Dibbs has seen on the ranch.\"You name it,\" he replied. \"We've got skunks, coyotes, coons, bears, lions, all kinds of birds, though no more condors, deer, possums, badgers -- everything you can imagine, almost everything. Lots of birds. The animals like the creek -- habitat, water, protection from their enemies.\"\n\n\"Are there fish in the creek?\" asked one of the boys.\n\n\"There used to be. In the old days, there were a lot of pools in the creek, and there used to be the brook trout, which was very good to fish and eat. We used to like to do that, but they started farming the hillsides, and the pools got filled up, so there aren't many left. They've been bringing in other fish like the rainbow trout, and the rainbow trout kill the brook trout.\"\n\nMany of the Vista students themselves live on ranches, fish in creeks, and dwell in the warm shadows of these grass hills. They felt a connection to this man; they recognized the places he has loved. The questions began to come more freely.\n\n\"How long did it take you to get to school?\"\"It took me - well, we lived in this house, and the school was right down here about a half mile, right there where old San Julian schoolhouse is, so it didn't take very long. My brother used to ride to school from Yridises and it took him about an hour. He'd have to go out to catch his pony, saddle it up, and come to school, so he rode five miles to school every day, and was there on time. Then we moved to Santa Barbara. We lived within a half mile from Roosevelt School and he was always late for school.\"\n\n\"Was Vista around?\"\n\n\"No. Vista didn't exist when I went to school. It started when they consolidated the county schools. Long after my time.\"\n\n\"How many kids were in your class?\"\"I think there were eight, probably eight or ten. It was a one-room schoolhouse. The school grades were not segregated. It was just a great big long room and the grades were seated all together, each in logical order. There weren't many young children. There were kindergarten, but I don't remember anybody under the age of three or four years old. But the children who came here had to come in buggies and on horseback. There were no automobiles. They used to come from over the hill that way, way down from Los Amoles, El Jaro, Yridises, La Golondrina...\"\n\nHe spoke the lyrical Spanish names like a chant.\"My sister and I used to come to school from Yridises on horseback and we'd meet friends at the alamo and race with them. We had a sulky cart and the horses pulled it, and we would go along at a fine pace. We used to race the others who had a buggy and couldn't go so fast as we could.\"\n\n\"Were you a good student?\"Dibbs laughed and said simply, \"No.\"\n\n\"Who was your best friend?\"\n\n\"When I was going to school in Santa Barbara, a private school in Montecito, my best friend out there was a man named Teddy Greenfield. He always beat me in the shooting matches. They were NRA shooting contests and Greenie would always beat me. He'd win the state title and I would be second. But he was my best friend. He later went on to become D.A. in Sonoma County. One day he was driving along the river and his truck turned over and hit him and after that he wasn't very good at the law profession. He had to sell all his books, and later he died.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment.\"I had a lot of good friends, though.\"\n\n\"What was Christmas morning like in the old days?\" one of the kids wondered.\n\n\"Let me tell you a Christmas story about my father. My father worked in Santa Barbara while we lived here during 1917 and 1918, during the war; he left Santa Barbara on the train and got off at Gaviota. It was raining, and he walked from Gaviota to here in the dark with his pack of toys on his back. It was a canvas bag -- they didn't have plastic in those days. And so he was walking along, whipped by rain and wind, the bag soaked through, and he was just across the creek down here, and it was very dark. He walked along, and he stumbled over a bull. All of the toys got scattered around, and the bull went one way and my father the other, and so that was our Christmas. We didn't have any Christmas when he got home. All the toys were scattered in the mud.\"\n\n\"How were the roads between Santa Barbara and San Julian?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" he said with a chuckle. \"It was a winding road. They didn't have any heavy equipment in those days, and all the work was done by horses, so whenever a canyon came, you had to go into the canyon and out, into the canyon and out. And at Arroyo Hondo, where J.J. Hollister lives, the road went way down the canyon and around that way. It was a dirt road. You couldn't go more than twenty-five or so, and it was dusty -- there was no cement on the road. So it took a long time to get to town from here. We had the Model T Ford; the Model T was about the only car that would navigate through the mud. And the roads were all muddy, no cement or gravel or anything. Oh, it was awful!\"\n\n\"How did the ranch get that red 1950 dump truck?\"\n\n\"I went east and bought some bulls and bought a long bed cattle truck. I bought it in Michigan and drove it back. It took about a week. Then later on, we took off the cattle bed and put on the dump truck bed, which is more useful here because we have to haul rock and gravel and things like that.\"\n\n\"Do you have any memories of the Hollister Ranch?\"\n\n\"Some. In the old days, we used to ship our cattle from Gaviota when they had to go to market. We'd drive down the road, which is now the highway, and drive our cattle down to Gaviota Station. A man was supposed to ride ahead with a red flag. Well, there was a Greyhound bus, and the driver wouldn't stop, so the bull and the bus had a conflict. The bus ran into the bull and the bull stood its ground. The radiator got busted and the bus stopped and a woman fell out of the front seat. The Greyhound people sued us but we won the suit because we proved we had a driver with a red flag.\"\n\n\"After awhile we were not allowed to drive cattle down there, not because of this incident, but because there was so much traffic there through Gaviota Pass. Instead, we had to drive our cattle over the hill to the Hollister Ranch. They had a station called Drake. So we drove our cattle over and shipped them from Drake. There was a big corral near the railroad and a chute that went up to the cars. We would manually load the cars. It took quite a long time, but it was a lot of fun. We were always good friends with the Hollisters. Jim Hollister was a good friend of ours and let us drive our cattle over the hills.\"\n\n\"What was it like during the Great Depression?\"\n\n\"It was terribly gloomy. Oh, it was awful! Cattle prices dropped to almost nothing. Believe it or not, I sold cattle for a cent and a half a pound. Whereas now they sell for 75 or 80 cents a pound. Then, later on, prices went up a little bit, but even up to the time we went out of the cattle business in 1969, we were only getting about 18 cents a pound for beef, and so it wasn't worth our trouble, raising cattle. Too many men, too much trouble.\"\n\n\"How did World War II affect ranch life?\"\n\n\"All of a sudden the war came along and they needed beans -- navy beans, small white ones, so we started raising beans. And the horses pulled a big tractor. That's what started farming on the ranch -- the war,\" said Dibbs.\n\nI pictured the men out there planting beans while bus loads of soldiers passed on the old highway heading for Camp Cooke. My father was one of those soldiers. I still have the tiny yellowed snapshots he took from the road of pastoral hills and twisted oak, of cowboys and cattle, of wooden fences and a railroad bridge. They all look so familiar to me now. When the war ended, my father went back home to Brooklyn, New York, but for the rest of his life spoke wistfully of those Santa Barbara places.\n\n\"Are there any other questions?\" Dibbs asked. He was enjoying this.\"Why did you close the kitchen?\" someone inquired.\n\n\"The Chinese man died over there. He died in his room one night. After that, we could never get another Chinese cook because word got around that a Chinaman had died there. We couldn't get any good cooks. The Chinese cook used to have opium poppies growing right out there. The Chinamen used to come and get the milk from the poppies and smoke it. It had kind of a sweet smell coming out from the kitchen, but we didn't know what it was!\"\n\nSpeaking of smoke, we asked if there had ever been a fire at San Julian.\n\n\"Yes.\" he replied. \"There have been fires, but not very many. A lot of times, the train that goes through Hollister Ranch would throw ashes. They couldn't sweep out the chimney because they used coal and the coal caused a lot of ashes in the flume and the flume would get plugged up, and so they'd throw sand in and scrape out the ashes and the ashes would start fires along the railroad. And so one time, around 1926 a fire started at the railroad and came all the way over the hill and stopped beneath the big creek. It couldn't cross the creek down here.\"\n\n\"Sometimes fires are started by lightning, sometimes by bottled water. You take a gallon bottle of water and you leave it out in the summertime and it can start a fire because the sun is magnified by the water. I went down to my farm house and my truck was smoldering from a bottle I had left there. I told one of the tenants to be attentive about it and he didn't believe me. He left a bottle of water on a big stack of new gunnysacks and it set fire. There are a lot of ways to start a fire. Sometimes fires would start from old wine bottles. A few started from lightning, but sometimes the rain would put out those.\"\n\n'How much of this land have you personally walked and mapped?\" asked Natalie Wong, a friend and neighbor who had joined us. Natalie is curious about such matters -- she loves to take long walks at Hollister Ranch.\n\n\"I'd say about 60 or 70%\" Dibbs replied. \"I used to walk a lot. I used to poison squirrels. They were terrible in those days; they were all over the place, and they used to eat lots of feed. So we started a program in about 1930, poisoning the squirrels. There was a blacksmith down here, and when he wasn't shoeing horses, he'd poison squirrels. He used to take strychnine and mix it up with barley, and he would taste it to see if it was bitter or not. Then he'd spit it out. He never swallowed it, and he never got poisoned.\"\n\n\"So I used to walk all over the big hills over there towards the Hollister Ranch, and everywhere, poisoning squirrels. I used to walk a lot. Maybe that's why I can't walk very well now.\"\n\nDibbs also covered a lot of ground when the gas line came through in 1926.\n\n\"I was appointed inspector,\" he explained, \"to see if they were digging deep enough. That was my first job. The pipe had to be buried four feet deep because they didn't want any plows or anything to hit it. I thought I was very important then. But my main job was to fix the fences for them when they'd go through a fence. And all the way between Golondrina and Las Cruces the digging had to be done by hand because it was too steep for a machine to dig it. So they had Mexican laborers dig the whole ditch with a pick and shovel -- and that was a job!\"\n\nWe were planning to go outside and have lunch beneath the arbor. The day had grown brighter. The leaves of the sycamores were yellow, and there was a stirring autumnal feeling to the air. I asked Dibbs which time of year was his favorite.\n\n\"I guess springtime,\" he told me. \"We always liked the springtime, and then we were always sad when the grass dried up. Then my aunt showed me how pretty the dried grass is in the summer, and it is. But it's always the springtime that I love, when the grass is green. And I used to love the winter, too, because I didn't mind the cold so much in those days, or the rains. I'd get out in the rain, because when the green grass came, that's the time I liked the best.\"\n\nThe arbor behind the casa was built in 1910, and Dibbs said that he can still remember being outside with his mother when it was being built. Beneath the arbor, now covered with grape leaves, are long tables, and in this area the family has had many barbecues and festivities over the years, most recently Dibbs' ninetieth birthday celebration.\n\n\"One year I had a big barbecue,\" said Dibbs mischievously, \"and the grapes weren't very good, so I went out to Lompoc and bought a crate of emperor grapes and hung 'em up!\"\n\n\"In the summer, the wisteria will take over the arbor,\" he continued. \"They're stronger than the grapes. But the wisteria is beautiful.\"\n\nBefore us stood a tall straight sycamore, which Dibbs referred to as his twin. \"That tree was planted the year I was born,\" he explained. \"I don't know whether it's a girl or a boy, but it's my twin.\"\n\nBoth twins are firmly rooted to this land.\n\nThere was an enchantment here. We all felt it. A sense of timelessness and perfection. The kids ran off to play, as Dibbs would no doubt have done with his sisters in 1915. We had a lunch of soup and snacks prepared by Maggie West and Dorothy Schofield, both of whom live at San Julian and are parents of Vista sixth graders.\n\nAfter lunch, Dibbs sat in the sunlight in front of the porch, on an old wooden bench that had faded like driftwood. Maggie and Dorothy led us on a walk.We came upon the schoolhouse, just as Dibbs described it -- a white, one-room building less than half a mile from the casa. We climbed the steps and peered into the windows, but the doors were locked. We went into barns filled with antique carriages, dusty and ghostly, and old farm equipment, long unused. Ted Martinez, our driver and good friend, admired a 1940 Chevy like one he had once owned. Threads of white clouds wisped across the broad blue sky, and the land seemed yellow and dappled with sun.\n\nI thought of how we take our places in its endless cycle, turning back sometimes if we are wise, to listen and remember.\n\nEarlier, we had asked Dibbs what he is most proud of, and he had said, \"I would guess it is the fact that we've been able to hang onto the ranch and the house. There are not many places where the old houses stand and the old families still own the place. So I think that's it. We've been able to hang onto it. We all love the ranch.\"\n\nThat love is palpable, and we understood fully why it matters so much. How do we express our awe and gratitude at having come tumbling out of a school bus to find ourselves in the nineteenth century? It was as if we had found a path we had not known we'd lost. How do we describe the delight and relief? It is with me still.\n\n\"Do you think the children know?\" Natalie whispered. \"Will they remember this?\"\n\n\"Some will,\" I mused, sounding like a teacher. \"It's like sending out a message in a bottle. One never knows if it will reach the other shore.\"I felt pretty hopeful, though.\n\nWe walked back towards the house. Dibblee Hoyt sat astride a tractor, readying a field for its next use.\"Come visit again,\" he called. \"Dibbs might live forever, but you never know.\"\n\nI hope we will return. I want to hear more stories. I want to sit beneath the arbor when it's dripping with wisteria. I want to see that curved wooden bench bleaching in the sun like an empty boat on a sea of light.\n\n- Cynthia Carbone Ward\n\nAuthor's note: This interview took place in 1997. Dibblee Poett died in November of 2000, at the age of 93. He had spent all but the last two or three years of his life at Rancho San Julian, living the life he loved. The photo above is by Dibblee Hoyt.\n\nArt Hicks grew up in the segregated South, served with the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, and has worked as an educator and human rights advocate. But that doesn't begin to tell the whole story. His life has been about working for change and transcending limits. In 2009, just a few years after he came to talk to our Dunn Middle School oral history class, he went to Washington D.C. to attend the Inauguration of President Barack Obama. (\"What a day that was!\" he told me later. \"You cannot imagine how it felt to be there.\") It's hard not to be inspired by this kind, spirited, and dignified man.\n\nMy full name is Arthur Norris Hicks and I was born in Sparta, Georgia on November 21, 1922, and that's a few years before you were born!I intended to live a long time so I took care of myself and didn't do those things that would have a negative effect. I've been careful to do things with moderation as opposed to going to extremes … although there are people who would say that my actions with regard to social events are extreme. I'm a person who works for change.\n\nI grew up in a very segregated area of the South. This segregation was based on hatred, and I mean absolute hatred. You ever hear the term \"lynching\"? It's the execution of a person, usually by hanging, without a hearing, without a courtroom, nothing to determine whether or not the person was guilty or not. That's the kind of condition that existed. And there were other more social types of segregation or discrimination: the back of the bus, the separate drinking fountains, separate waiting rooms in train stations, separate seats in trains. If you went to a store to try on shoes, you had to first buy special socks to put on, or if you wanted to try on a hat, you had to wear some sort of cap over your hair, and in many places, they wouldn't even accept that. Schools were segregated. The materials and equipment in the black school were books and materials that had been discarded by the administration of the white schools, so the education was of course inferior.\n\nEven as kids, we understood. We understood quite well. And in case we didn't, they frequently reminded us by throwing rocks through our windows and driving through the neighborhood yelling, \"Niggers, move out!\" So, yes, we were frequently reminded and we were very conscious of it.How did we feel as a result of it? Angry. But there was nothing to do. It was anger that had to be subdued. We were continually reminded that we lived under conditions that were not acceptable, but there was nothing we could do about it. So maybe you can imagine how one felt, the constant frustration one might feel.\n\nAnd it isn't all of us who withheld action all the time. Some of us broke out and we did things to express our disgust for these types of conditions.In order to go to the grocery store, we had to walk through a border with the white neighborhood, and on occasion a gang of ruffians would confront us and we had to run. But one day I out-ran most and then intentionally allowed the person who was closest to me to catch up. That's one time when I expressed my anger. I beat him up.And this was the type of thing one had to do in order to survive, to retain one's mentality.There were nine of us in my family: four boys and five girls, so I was a pretty socialized person. I had to learn to get along 'cause I was right in the middle. I always had somebody up here who could handle me and somebody down below that I had to take care of.\n\nPeople frequently ask me what is meant by Tuskegee Airmen. What makes the Tuskegee Airmen story a significant story? The Tuskegee Airmen are a group of people who became pilots during World War II. Well, lots of people became pilots during World War II. What's so significant about that? Well, in the military, all the pilots were white, and for the most part there were no Mexicans, and no other minorities, and as such, the armed services were very segregated with respect to aviation. This was even supported by a body of so-called scientific data that said that blacks were incapable of learning complex material, incapable of flying a plane, incapable of carrying out military missions.\n\nBut in World War II the nation was hurting for pilots and other technical types of skills. This was an opportunity for the black press and black organizations to convince the War Department and the President to open up these opportunities for black men. (It would have been a good opportunity for women, too, but women were generally not considered in that context at the time.)Well, Eleanor Roosevelt was a very forward-thinking First Lady. There was a training program for black people to become pilots down in Tuskegee, Alabama, associated with a school founded by Booker T. Washington. Have you heard of him? He was an educator who founded a school that trained black men and women to do different types of skills. Many of them were menial, but at least they were structured and they taught people to be responsible and accomplished.\n\nAnyway, there was a pilot training program at this school in the late 1930s. In 1939, the British were under attack by the Germans and there was a great need for pilots. In fact, some blacks did go overseas by way of Canada and participated in the war before the United States got into the fight.Well, Mrs. Roosevelt used to travel around the country looking at programs and conditions and making recommendations to the President and to Congress. In 1941, she went"
