The name Golf Wang is a spoonerism of his Los Angeles-based musical collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA) or Odd Future for short, of which he was a co-founder. Golf Wang is known for its colorful visual aesthetic. In 2013, the brand expanded beyond its Odd Future affiliation and established itself in the fashion industry. It is designed by Tyler, the Creator. The brand offers clothing, footwear through collaborations with Converse often under the name GOLF le FLEUR*, jewellery, upon other products. \"Holiday 1991\", the brand's first look book, was released on December 11, 2011. = Golf Wang still affiliated with Odd Future, during its December 2011 debut. In 2013, Golf Wang publicly separated from Odd Future. = In its history, Golf Wang has gone on to collaborate with other brands as a part of various projects. Golf Wang's first notable collaboration was its project with Vans. The partnership lasted from 2013 to 2016. In an interview with Dazed Magazine in 2017, Tyler stated that Golf Wang cut ties with Vans due to a lack of creative liberty. Following Golf Wang's departure from Vans, Tyler, the Creator and Converse collaborated to create the shoe collection GOLF le FLEUR*. In 2017, Golf Wang collaborated with Japanese sandal brand SUICOKE. Their first release was the KAW-CAB sandals in colors 'Mocha' and 'Lemon Yellow'. In April 2019, they released a third version of the KAW-CAB sandals. Then in October 2019, a different silhouette called the 'DEPA-CAB' sandals was released in two new colorways. Also in 2019, GOLF le FLEUR* and Converse released a new, original silhouette named the 'GLF Giano Ox'. The shoes were available in two colorways, 'Bright Concord' and 'Cuban Sand'. That same year, GOLF WANG created a scented candle in collaboration with Japanese fragrance label \"reta W\". Named 'Coldwater', the candle was released on March 23, 2019. For apparel, Golf le Fleur partnered with fashion brand Lacoste for an SS19 collection named 'GOLF le COSTE*'. The clothing line featured colors such as pale pink, beige, and off-white named respectively 'litchi', 'geode', and 'mascarpone'. Golf le Fleur then collaborated with Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams. The first ice cream was named 'Snowflake', released on July 8, 2019, it was a white chocolate ice cream flavor. The second flavor, 'Pluto Bleu' was released online on September 17, 2020, and was a blood orange and blueberry flavored ice cream. On May 20, 2020, Golf Wang released a top and bottom set with Levi Strauss & Co. for their '501 day'. The collaboration featured Levi's vintage-fit trucker jacket and 501 '93 jeans in Ecru denim with rainbow-colored polka dots. = Golf le Fleur was introduced at the Golf Wang fashion show at Made L.A. on June 11, 2016. Named \"Golf le Fleur\" (stylized as \"GOLF le FLEUR*\"), it was first introduced as a shoe collaboration between Tyler, the Creator and Converse. The collection was named \"GOLF le FLEUR*\" to mean Flower Boy in French though the translation is inaccurate. It was released in the same year as Tyler's Flower Boy album. First made available to the public on July 13, 2017, the first design released was Converse One Star shoes in a new, light blue colorway called \"Clearwater\". As of December 2021, Golf le FLEUR* has branched away from Golf Wang into a standalone luxury lifestyle and apparel brand debuting with an invite-only pop-up shop in Los Angeles. On August 3, 2017, the first set of Golf le Fleurs was released. They came in 4 colors, called \"Airway Blue\" (light blue), \"Peach Pearl\" (peach colored), \"Sulfur\" (yellow) and \"Fuchsia Glow\" (fuchsia/lavender). On October 16, 2017, the second set of Golf le Fleurs was announced. This set was named the \"Uno\", which contained three new shoes with a brand-new insole, design, and bottom. The colors Jolly Green (forest green), Vanilla (cream), and Solar Power (yellow), were released on November 2, 2017. On January 4, 2018, the second set of \"Anas\", and the third overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They were released on January 18, 2018, with the colors \"Bachelor Blue\" (light blue), \"Geranium Pink\" (light pink), and \"Jade Lime\" (light green). On April 23, 2018, the first set of the line known as \"Momos\", and the fourth overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They are a monotone colored shoe, and on April 26, 2018, they were released. The colors were \"Black\", \"White\", \"Greener Pastures\" (dark green), \"Limoges\" (dark blue), and \"Rhubarb\" (burgundy). On May 23, the third set of \"Anas\", (also nicknamed \"two-toned\") and the fifth overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They were released on June 1, 2018, with the colors \"Purple Heart\" (purple and green), \"Molten Lava\" (red and blue), \"Candy Pink\" (red and pink), and \"Plume\" (baby blue and baby pink). On February 23, 2019, the \"Industrial\" line was released with another rework of the Converse (shoe company) \"One Star\". The shoes were released with barely blue/egret/black and barely blue/patriot/egret colorways. The line also included matching '60s workwear boilersuits. On May 17, the \"Velvet le Fleur\" line was released. This included two reworks of the \"One Star\" in red and brown as well as a rework of the \"Chuck 70\" in purple, all of which use a quilted velvet material. On June 28, another pair of \"Anas\" was released, featuring a bright rainbow sole and an all-white upper. On September 13, a pair of Converse All-Stars was released with a polka dot design. Golf Wang made its runway debut on June 11, 2016, at Made LA, a fashion event created by IMG. 2016 was the premiere of Made LA on the west coast. The show also marked the debut of the 'Golf le Fleur' shoe collaboration, with Converse and Vans. In addition to a live audience, the show was broadcast on the internet. Notable attendees included Kanye West, Dylan and Cole Sprouse, Kendall Jenner, YG, Janelle Monáe, Solange Knowles, and Amandla Stenberg. The show implemented a \"see-now, buy-now\" process at the event, meaning that the collection was available for pre-order after the show. The show's set design included a bedroom connected to a skate ramp and the event was accompanied by musical performances. The first Odd Future store was opened on Fairfax Avenue in 2011. The Odd Future would come to be the first retail space that sold Golf Wang. In 2014, Tyler described in a series of tweets that the Odd Future store on Fairfax Avenue had closed. On October 25, 2017, Tyler announced that he would open the Golf Wang flagship, named \"GOLF\" on 350 North Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, California. The new location officially opened on October 26, 2017, and features an indoor skating bowl. A second \"GOLF\" storefront opened on November 12, 2022, located on 35 Howard Street in New York, NYC. Finally, third \"GOLF\" storefront opened in London on October 21, 2023, becoming the first store to open outside of the United States launching their \"GOLF ACROSS THE POND\" limited time campaign. Tyler held meet and greets at both stores upon their opening. GOLF WANG has released a variety of collections since 2013.

It was sold exclusively in Kohl's department stores and on their website. In Mexico, the collection is sold at department store Coppel. In November 2010, Kohl's announced the partnership with Lopez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Following Lopez and Anthony's divorce, the lines were marked as two separate brands. In May 2020, Kohl’s announced it would be removing 8 of its brands, including the Jennifer Lopez Collection, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Jennifer Lopez Collection included contemporary sportswear, dresses, handbags, jewelry, shoes, sleepwear, and a home collection. Lopez and Anthony’s partnership with Kohl's was announced during a press conference at the London Hotel in Los Angeles, California on November 18, 2010. The deal, which was marketed as \"the first celebrity couple to simultaneously design collections for one retailer\", was aimed at including men's and women's clothing, as well as house wares. Lopez's collection was revealed to feature women's dresses, sportswear, handbags and jewelry, while Anthony's was to contain men's dress shirts, ties, sport coats and shoes. Kohl's expected \"the his-and-hers line\" to expand into home accessories over time. The new venture was expected to generate up to $3 billion in additional sales for Kohl's in its first year alone. Following the couple's separation in July 2011, it was announced that the line would go forward as two separate clothing lines. Rick Darling, the president of LF USA, which is sublicensing the brands to Kohl's exclusively, added: \"We have two separate agreements with Jennifer and Marc and always intended to have separate lines. [Their split] doesn't impact the agreements in any way.\" In June 2014, Billboard reported Lopez received 5% of all revenues from her collection. = The fall 2011 collection was previewed in the August 2011, edition of O, The Oprah Magazine. In the magazine, Lopez is shown \"modeling her faux-fur-lined belted sweater with skinny jeans and matching boots\". Eight O readers were also styled in the collection, which included \"on-trend animal prints paired with neutral colors\" that Lopez labeled as \"accessible, everyday glamour.\" The full look book for the collection, was released on August 17. The collection became available at Kohl's department stores and at Kohls.com starting on September 11, 2011. The debut of Lopez's and Anthony's lines marked the biggest product launch in the retailer's history, according to CEO Kevin Mansell. The line, whose items range in price from $22 to $150, was inspired by Lopez's \"glamorous and cosmopolitan lifestyle\" as a \"globally recognized entertainer\". \"The contemporary collection is easy, comfortable and designed for women who want effortless, sophisticated style at a great value.\" = On February 29, Lopez posted photos from the commercial shoot for the spring collection onto her official website. The commercial was on March 4. The commercial was directed by Darren Aronofsky. = The fall 2012 collection focuses on \"trendy elements that accentuate femininity\". The collection includes numerous autumnal elements, dresses to knitted cardigans, stylish shirts, maxi skirts and sweaters.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n37634667\n\nManpacks\n\n2012-11-14 00:35:17+00:00\n\nManpacks was a quarterly subscription service offering men's underwear, socks, toiletries and other basic needs. Buyers created their pack with offered items including boxer briefs, undershirts, socks, shaving products, and condoms, and the pack was automatically delivered every three months. The service has been discontinued. Ken Johnson and Andrew Draper started working on the concept for Manpacks in December 2009 and founded the company in January 2010. Manpacks began as an experimental side project, but demand increased. Soon, customer management and the processing of orders turned into a full-time job. Upon launch, the site offered only offered underwear and socks. Manpacks was the first American subscription ecommerce service offering men's essentials. Numerous sites have since spawned and imitated Manpacks' business model. Shortly after launch, Manpacks was accepted into Betaspring's startup accelerator program. The company at one time had more than 10,000 subscribers. Manpacks automatically shipped men basic needs like socks, underwear, razors, and toiletries every three months or when desired. Three months after placing an order, Manpacks would send customers a shipment reminder email. Manpacks' primary customers were people buying for the men in their life, men who are averse to shopping, and the lazy.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n27214071\n\nHosanna Kabakoro\n\n2010-05-04 02:36:12+00:00\n\nHosanna Noelle-Leilani Kabakoro (born June 24, 1992) was an editor of Mai Life Style, the South Pacific's first style and fashion magazine.

It is one of many famines to have hit the region in recent times. The Sahel is the ecoclimatic and biogeographic zone of transition between the Sahara desert in the north of Africa and the Sudanian savannas in the south, covering an area of 3,053,200 square kilometres. It is a transitional ecoregion of semi-arid grasslands, savannas, steppes, and thorn shrublands. The neighbouring Sénégal River Area contains various vegetation types and covers parts or all of Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and Guinea. It has also had very low rainfall over the last year according to the UN, NGOs and the Senegal River Basin Development Authority. Sudan set a new temperature record of 49.7 °C (121.3 °F) on 22 June, in the town of Dongola. Famine and food shortages were present in the following Sahelian countries during 2010 after heavy rains hit the region in late 2009, followed by a heat wave: Sudan, the Niger, northern Nigeria, northern Cameroon, Chad, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mali, as well as in parts of the neighbouring Sénégal River Area. In December 2009, both USAID and several NGOs predicted an increased food insecurity situation in more of the southern districts of Mali as compared to the same time the previous year. = The Western donor nations once theorised that the drought in the Sahel primarily was caused by humans over-using natural resources in the region through overgrazing, deforestation and poor land management. In the late 1990s, climate model studies suggested that large-scale climate changes were also triggers for the drought. In the early 2000s, after the phenomenon of global dimming was discovered, some speculatively suggested, that the drought was likely caused by air pollution generated in Eurasia and North America. The pollution changed the properties of clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, disturbing the monsoons and shifting the tropical rains southwards. Global dimming, the blocking of sunlight by man-made particulates, has been identified as one culprit for a decades-long drought across sub-Saharan Africa. A 2006 study by NOAA scientists Rong Zhang and Thomas L. Delworth suggests that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation/(MAO) plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over Sahel, while a cold phase reduces it. The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, by assuming the presence of a theoretical 70-year cycle (following peaks in ≈1880 and ≈1950), it would probably peak around about 2020. The Sahel's farmers have been largely cleared of blame for the 19th century's Sahel droughts. The Sahel region's rains in the 1930s and 1940s were caused by the recent warming of the Indian Ocean, rather than by over-farming causing environmental degradation as previously assumed, according to a new joint Scidev/UN study. With both a 3.5 C. rise in the Niger's temperature over the last decade and with irrigated land accounting for only 0.1% of the Niger's inhabitable land, regular famine crisis is inevitable in most years. Acute water shortages, which are common in the region's harsh weather, make irrigation systems all the more important for the local farmers. = The Lake Chad basin straddles the borders of both Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad. The lake is situated 281 metres (922 ft) above sea level and is diminishing over time due to lack of rain water and major rivers running into it. According to the UN the marshy lake shrank as much as by 95% from about 1963 to 1998 yet they also state that \"The 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years\". Lake Chad is economically important, providing water to more than 20 million people living in the four countries that surround it (Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria) on the edge of the Sahara Desert. The plant Typha Australis (or the big cattail) is cutting off water supplies in the Lake Chad Basin, and has slashed available water supplies in the Chad's region. The only protected area is Lake Chad Game Reserve, which covers half of the area next to the lake that belongs to Nigeria. The whole lake has been declared a Ramsar site of international importance. Lake Chad's role in the Sahel famine has attracted attention partly due to the desertification that is increasingly claiming a huge swath not just of the Sahel region but also the entire African continent. According to a United Nations environment program, in 2002, this phenomenon, which is a process where the soil loses the capacity to retain necessary moisture, has covered nearly half of Africa. It was revealed that the Sahel region is one of the areas that are worst affected. The problem is also highlighted by the discovery of fossil pollens indicating that, in ancient times, the shores of Lake Chad supported a well-watered savanna, which contributed to a lesser level of aridity in the Sahel area. It was found that around 3,000 B.C., the Sahel averaged 650 millimetres of rainfall a year compared to an average of 350 millimetres recorded today. Given the issue of desertification, even if Lake Chad was not directly a cause of the famine, its potential demise is expected to further aggravate the problem. There are studies that show that the incidence of famine is reportedly related to the delicate seasonal variations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The shrinking of Lake Chad is blamed on the long droughts as well as the uptick in human activities such as the use of the lake's water for irrigation, the destruction of wooded areas for firewood, and the shift from the cultivation of corn and wheat to rice as the staple crop. The Ubangi River diversion proposal In the 1960s, a plan was proposed to divert the Ubangi River into Lake Chad. The copious amount of water from the Ubangi would revitalise the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and Sahelians. Inter-basin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J. Umolu (ZCN Scheme) and Italian firm Bonifica (Transaqua Scheme). In 1994, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) proposed a similar project and at a March 2008 Summit, the Heads of State of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project. In April 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a World Bank-funded feasibility study. = Cotton and groundnuts are two of Chad's four major cash crops. Mali's major cash crops are peanuts and cotton. Mali's cotton production has grown from 500,000 tonnes in 1997 to a record 635,000 tonnes in 2003, which has pleased the African Association of Cotton Producers, but has also led to a claim that cash crops are being put before food and fodder crops in Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad. Cassava production has fallen slightly in Burkina Faso since 2007, relative to cotton output. Their cash crops are cotton, groundnuts, shea nuts, and sesame. The Sahel's farmers are largely cleared of blame for the 20th century's Sahel droughts and this is supported by the position that several of the cash crops in the Sahel region have desirable ecological effects such as the tree crops and the legumes, which help prevent the process of desertification. However, there is the enduring question of whether cash crops like cotton are more important than food plants like wheat and casava. This issue persists as studies cite that the famine is linked to the direct entitlement failure that affected people's access to food. = Many of the world's countries, including many in Sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the Cold War. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc.; in some of the less fortunate countries. The population of Chad has, for example, ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009, further straining its resources. Nigeria is witnessing a similar growth in population, strained resources and a possible over-population problem in the near future. The situation was most acute in northern, western and central Africa. Refugees from places like the Sudan have helped further strain the resources of neighbouring states like the Chad and Egypt. The nation is also host to roughly 255,000 refugees from Sudan's Darfur region, and about 77,000 refugees from the Central African Republic, whilst approximately 188,000 Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines, have either fled to either the Sudan, the Niger or, more recently, Libya. = On 25 August a French aid worker was kidnapped in Chad. The kidnapping of foreigners along the Chad/Darfur border became more frequent in 2009. A French NGO worker was taken and then murdered on 29 October 2009, and an unidentified Red Cross worker was captured on 10 November 2009. Many NGOs and charities have begun to restrict the areas covered by their aid work in Niger, Chad, and Sudan due to the ever-present risk of bandits and kidnappers. The organisations are thus pulling out in fear of their workers' lives. Most international aid agencies have been withdrawing workers from some areas of the Sahel, due to the regional kidnapping crisis. Niger's government spokesman Mahamane Lawali Danda told the BBC that the pullout was a surprise to him since no one had told him or his government that Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' pariah nations, along with Chad, Darfur and Sudan. Strangely, Mauritania and Mali were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several al-Qaeda lead kidnappings in both during 2009. = 11 January saw an emerging famine situation in south eastern Sudan according to the UN, NGOs, the EU and various Charities. The government of Niger says 7,800,000 risk starvation in 2010 as heavy drought and high heat hit Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Chad and northern Nigeria on both 27 and 28 January and was estimated to need about $220,000,000 million this year in food and agricultural aid. The EU's ECHO aid department said of signs of food shortages were in Niger and spreading to neighbours such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Chad and northern Nigeria as 15,000,000 are estimated to face a chronic food shortage in Niger. The EU and UN also put out a famine alert for Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Chad and northern Nigeria and began to appeal for aid on the 28th. The EU, China and Russia stopped giving Niger aid in 2009 after President Mamadou Tandja defied UN, EU and worldwide criticism over extending his term in office. = The UN, NGOs and charities warned of heavy food insecurity in Southern Sudan throughout February due to an emerging famine and the ongoing conflict between Misseriya nomad in the Southern Kordofan department. The rainfall was reported at an all-time low in Mauritania and neighbouring parts of Senegal during most of February and early March. The EU warns of a pending Sahel famine centered upon Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad on 1 February. = Human Rights Watch said that Al Qaeda should stop targeting African civilians and aid workers on 16 March. A drought was confirmed to have hit parts of Burkina Faso on 10 March, by USAID and the UN. On 13 March 2010 the UN, NGOs, the EU and various charities put out a famine alert for parts of southern Sudan. On 15 March 2010 Britain's Save The Children charity launched an appeal as 840,000 Nigerians are confirmed to be in imminent risk of a famine. On 17 March 2010, a famine was declared in Mao in Chad's sand-swept Kanem region. On 23 March 2010, major sandstorms hit Mauritania, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea and inland Sierra Leone. Another hit southern Algeria, inland Mauritania, Mali and northern Côte d'Ivoire at the same time. = During April and June, Islamic Relief (IR) sent aid workers to the North Kordofan to help improve their 16-year-old Um Dam and North Kordofan Water Project (NKWP). The UN, NGOs, charities and the Sudanese government reported that food security was a major concern in South Sudan and would stay at risk until the rainy season in September. By 8 April 2010, starving children and elders filled the wards of a hospital in Akobo, Sudan. Several aid groups like Save the Children and Medair found out that 46% of children in the region were malnourished. The U.N. blamed two years of failed rainfall and the ongoing tribal clashes in the region for helping to create the humanitarian crisis in southern Sudan. The World Food Programme(WFP) was feeding 80,000 (up from 20,000 since April 2009) and the U.N. says 4,300,000 people in southern Sudan need food aid. On 23 April 2010, said Nigerien Culture Minister Aminata Takoubakoyea, there was a reported food supply deficit of 119,700 tonnes and a fodder supply deficit of 16,000,000 tonnes. Niger's leading musicians and singers held a charity concert in Niamey to assist. = On 1 May 2010, the West African nation of Chad was on the verge of a nationwide famine as drought, armed conflict, and an influx of Darfur refugees all contributed to a chronic food shortage that now affects 2,000,000 people (20% of the country's total population). Various aid groups, NGOs and charities said a catastrophic famine could hit the country in the near future if food relief does not arrive soon. The UN warned that a famine had hit the town of Mao in Chad's Kanem region. The city of Niamey, Niger took in refugees from Tillabéri department 12 days before, after they turned up hoping the city would help them. By 3 May 2010, the towns of Kongomé, Zinder, Tanout and Dalli were the worst hit by the drought. Morocco gives a short term cash loan to both the Niger and Mali. NGOs and Charities report famine conditions Kindal region on the 5th. On 12 and 26 May 2010, both Mauritania, the Sénégal River Area and neighbouring parts of both Senegal and Mali faced both drought and famine. On 14 May 2010, USAID issued a food shortage alert for the Kordofan states. Seven died of dehydration in Ghaidi Magha, Mauritania, near the Malian border on 18 May 2010. Afrol News reported on 25 May that about 2,000,000 Chadians were at risk of having a famine occur in their regions after the combined effects of 2 years of drought and pestilence had ruined their harvest yet again. On 27 and 28 May 2010, Mali and Niger faced a famine situation in their northern territories. The Kidal, Timboktu and Gao had their crops and livestock die off. Gao's historic nomad market had virtually no food stuffs or animal fodder in it. 31 May saw Chad embroiled in a fiscal controversy. A 12-metre statue of a horseman, the Rond-point de la Grande Armée, in the capital N'djamena, cost over $3,000,000. Both local critics, NGOs and overseas donor nations all wondered where the money had come from and thought it would have been better spent on buying food and irrigation equipment. = NGOs, various charities and the UN warned of heavy food shortages and food insecurity in Sudan's Blue Nile, Kassala, Janub Darfur, South Kordofan and North Kordofan departments. Dehydration was reported to have killed one person in Niger, while others in the region were at risk of water shortages on 1 June. Severe drought caused to 10,000,000 to go seriously short on as the Eastern Sahel crisis increases and local food prices surge on 3 June. Niger has 7,100,00 victims, Chad has 2,000,000 victims and other country have 900,000 victims in total. Niger, Chad, the eastern parts of Mali and northern Cameroon have also been badly affected by the failed rains and scorching heat, according to the UN World Food Programme. The WFP, which plans to assist 3,600,000 people in the coming months and said the crisis is expected to last at least until the next harvest in September 2010. The British charity Save the Children, launched an emergency appeal for Niger. Starving families were reported as either have travelled more than 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) to reach the capital Niamey to find work and/or beg for food, while others have crossed the border in Nigeria. A Similar situation is occurring in Chad as, desperate Chadians fled into southern Libya. Sudan and Burkina Faso were in a server food insecure situation too. On 6 June 2010, growing famine in the Niger drove thousand of refugees into the Nigerian provinces of Kano and Katsina states. About 7,000,000 were facing a food shortage crisis in Niger. On 7 June the Malian Government's Early Warning System released an estimate that 258,000 people were suffering from malnutrition in the towns of Gao and Kidal in April. Low and erratic rainfall in 2009 had occurred in Timbuktu, Kidal, and Gao, leading to a heavy regional drought. Hundreds of refugees moved to Gao from Burkina Faso and Niger, but were now too weak with starvation to leave Mali. The UN and Mali's government asked the developed nations for food aid and financial help in the face of the growing humanitarian crisis. The amount taken in Nigeria's harvest was down by 65,000 tonnes, whilst Niger had virtually nothing to take from their harvest. On 8 June 2010, France food aid to and the European Union pledged an additional $28,000,000 million to help the millions of victims in the Niger, the Chad, Burkina Faso, and northern Nigeria. The charity Save the Children sent a team to Aguie in Niger, 850 km north east from the capitol Niamey, to set up an aid centre on the 8th and reported back on the 9th than 350,000 children faced severe malnutrition. On 9 June, various groups of hydrologists, geologists and scientists in the Sahara desert used magnetic imaging technology when looking for aquifer sites for drilling water wells in Eastern Chad. Both northern Mali, southern Libya, southern Algeria, eastern Chad were being examined in part of an ongoing project to find viable drilling as the region's nations try to find new water sources to keep up with their growing demand. In recent years, roughly 300,000 refugees have arrived from both the war-torn Sudan and ailing Central African Republic, thus straining the already limited water supplies. Both Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger have shown a major interest in the further development of this resource lead local industry. On 11 June 2010, the UN's World Food Organisation, Oxfam and MSF all warned of an impending famine in Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and northern Nigeria. Niger's Diffa Region was of the most concern to the experts at hand. By 13 June 2010, roughly 30% of crops failed in some of Niger's provinces. A new heat wave hit Niger on 21 June, causing an increased area of drought in that country as well. Niger's crops failed and famine occurred. About 350,000 faced starvation and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine according to the Niger's government, while the UN said roughly 2,000,000 Chadians, 7,000,0000 Nigerians and 1,000,000 other people of the Sahel region faced starvation and 200,000 Nigerian children were malnourished. In over-heated Chad, the temperature reached 47.6 °C (117.7 °F) on 22 June in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, on also 22 June, at 47.1 °C in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, on 23 June when Bilma hit 48.2 °C (118.8 °F).

On 24 June the government of Niger admitted that it was suffering from a major famine and said aid workers and NGOs were now welcome. The government of the Ivory Coast had reported to various NGOs that it was struggling to control desertification and imminent drought conditions in parts of its northern savanna lands. Oxfam launch a £7,000,000 emergency appeal to try to help more than 800,000 of the most vulnerable people in Chad, Niger and Mali. 26 June saw 1,600,000 Chadians facing food insecurity in the Bahr el Gazel Region, Batha Region, Guera Region, Hadjer-Lamis Region, Lac Region and the Kanem Region. About 604,000 people were benefiting from its assistance as a total 60% of families became victims of the famine in varying degrees according to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). Chad appealed to donors for increased contribution to the international famine relief operation in Chad that received US$42,100,000 of a pledged total of US$65,000,000, to enable it continue all its relief work and charitable activities until the end of the year 2010. Cameroon also suffered from heavy desertification in the savanna regions of South Region, Centre Region, West Region, Northwest Region and Far North Region. = July saw sporadic and small-scale food riots in Sudan's Blue Nile, Janub Darfur, South Kordofan and North Kordofan departments. The Muslim Hands charity set up an appeal and sent aid to Niger and Mali in July. It was the worst Niger famine since 1984, with 3,500,000 people starving. On 6 July, the Methodist Relief and Development Fund (MRDF) aid experts said that more than 1,500,000 Nigerians were at risk of famine due to a month-long heat wave that was hovering over Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Morocco. A fund of about £20,000 was distributed to the crisis-hit countries of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The heat wave that left Morocco for the Iberian Peninsula on 11 July was attributed to the regional hot air currents that depart from the Sahara desert in Northern Africa at about 1,000 meters in altitude. This facilitated a movement in the hot air towards the Balkans and the Ukraine via the Straits of Gibraltar, Spain and Italy. Unusually hot weather was also reported in parts of Algeria on 11 July. On 12 July 2010, a local goat farmer was killed and his small flock stolen by Chadian refugees in the South Darfur region of the Sudan.

On 13 July, the USAID funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), and the UN warned of a food supply shortage in northern Sudan, with increasing food insecurity focused on the war torn Darfur region and other neighbouring areas. The deteriorating security situation in the conflict zone was predicted to reduce both productivity and peoples' access to local agricultural well, as well as disrupting the seasonal livestock migration. USAID/OFDA provided $133,200,000 to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to help remedy the crisis in the three Darfur states. Concerns were also raised about the situation in Chad, Three years of famine and then the recent sandstorms devastated Niger on 14 July. Diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and respiratory diseases kill and sicken many children. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and has taken serious steps to call overseas help since coming to office in February 2010. Sudan witnessed minor food rioting in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei as profiteering locals and merchants and Ugandan exporters took advantage of the shortages in order to heavily mark up their selling prices. 15 July saw more border conflicts between the Nuer and the Dinka, further hindering aid workers in Southern Sudan. On 17 July, Mohamed Béavogui, the Director of Western and Central Africa Division of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), called for more international help for the people of the Sahel, who had a 410,000 tons of cereals and 20,000 tons of fodder deficit. He also condemned the world for not doing enough to help the Sahel, but stopped short of Cheminade's idea of pumping water from the Zaire River into Lake Chad to reinvigorate its water supply and stop any further shrinkage. On 24 July, the British Red Cross flew its logistics teams Bristol Airport to Niger to help the army and local officials with transportation. The relief effort has already been made possible by the response to the Red Cross's West Africa Crisis Appeal, which aims to raise £500,000. According to UN agencies, 200,000 children need treatment for malnutrition in Niger alone, as Oxfam put out an £7,000,000 appeal to cover both Chad and Niger. France sent unspecified food and cash aid to Mali on 25 July. On 26 July the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger, and about 20 had reportedly died in northern Niger of dehydration on 27 July. 27 July also saw a critical situation occurring in northern Mali and Chad. About 8,000,0000 Nigerians, 1,600,000 Chadians and 500,000 Malians were on the verge of a major food shortage as the Nigerian journalist Tidiane Kassé said that by tackling the consequences rather than the causes would be a better form of long-term help for the region. On 31 July, leading economists predicted that food prices, especially wheat, would rise in Chad as Russia ends exports due to a domestic drought destroying their wheat and barley harvests. = On 1 August, Gadabeji, Niger suffered 35 °C heat and drought. On 1 August, just under 12,000,000 people in Niger (approximately 80% of the nation's entire population) faced a food supply crisis and possibly even famine conditions. The Tillabéri region is 30 km from the capital, Niamey, on the road to the Saharan town of Timbuktu. Unusually severe rainfall destroyed and then rotted the farmers' crops. Basic food stuffs like maize, millet and sorghum were running out in West Africa's Sahel. Both Chad and northern Nigeria have a similar, but less severe problem. On 3 August, Burkina Faso was hit by a drought, as 4,500,000 Burkinans and 6,700,000 Nigerians faced starvation. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the Sudanese Nuer–Dinka war was hampering relief efforts and damaging agricultural output in parts of South Sudan. 10 August saw an Al Jazeera reporter say that 7,500,000 Nigerians were at risk of famine and 15,000,000 could face a famine across the Sahel.

On 12 August, Gianluca Ferrera, deputy director for the UN's World Food Programme in the Niger, said malnutrition and crop failures were at a record levels in 2010. Food shortages are affecting 12,000,000 people and 400,000 children face starvation. Food prices rose by about 300% since the crisis began and thus hardly any one can afford to buy the remaining food. 14 August saw protests across Sénégal over concerns relating to the ruling party's poor governance in the face of recent floods, storms and power cuts across the country, along with the current heavy drought in Senegal's Sahel region. 15 August had aid workers and their organisations warn of an imminent nationwide famine in Niger. On 20 August, floods which were the worst for 80 years hit the Shale region. The U.N. warned that Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and northern Nigeria are also in the grip of the worst regional food crisis since 2006. In the savannah Kano, Nigeria, over 2,000 families were displaced by floods and in the nearby Jigawa region, an entire village was evacuated due to heavy flooding. In Mauritania, a flood damaged bridges and many homes in the mountain town of Aioun. Heavy flooding was occurring around parts of lake Chad. Most international aid agencies withdraw workers due to the regional kidnapping crisis. Niger's government spokesman Mahamane Lawali Danda told the BBC that the pullout came as a surprise since no one had told his government Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' pariah states, along with Chad, Darfur and Sudan. Mauritania and Mali were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several al-Qaeda lead kidnappings during 2009. The U.N. warned of mass starvation in Niger and Chad and Oxfam said people in the region were surviving on leaves and berries picked in the wild. 8,000,000 were said to be near starvation by both organisation. The UN estimated that up to 7,800,000 Nigeriens were affected by heavy food shortages. Cafod set up a £100,000 aid programme on 21 August. 25 August had a French aid worker kidnapped in Chad. The kidnapping of foreigners along the Chad–Darfur border became more frequent in 2009. A French NGO worker was taken and then murdered on 29 October 2009, and an unidentified Red Cross worker was captured on 10 November 2009. Many NGOs and charities had started to restrict the areas covered by their aid work in Niger, Chad and Sudan, due to the ever-present risk of bandits and kidnapers. On 28 August, charities and NGOs put out food shortage alerts for Niger. Heavy rain falls on the border of the CAR and the Chad. 31 August saw 7,900,000 of Niger's 15,300,000 people in immediate risk of starvation and Gordon Brown MP making plans for a $100,000 charity speech on the development of irrigation and water schemes to increase cultivable land the Niger and the Chad. He was quoted to have said in the interview that: But, today, where there is suffering without hope, we can prevent children dying painful, avoidable deaths On 31 August Sudan's army reported that 3 Russian helicopter crew members had been abducted by gunmen in Nyala, capital of South Darfur, just hours after Samaritan's Purse aid worker Flavia Wagner who had been kidnapped 18 May was set free. She was taken from the South Darfurian village of Abu Ajura, along with two Sudanese colleagues who were also freed after a week. The governor of South Darfur, Abdel Hamid Kasha, Sudan foreign ministry spokesman Moawiya Osman and Samaritan's Purse's leader Franklin Graham, and the Russian ambassador to Chad welcomed Flavia's release, but condemned the kidnap of the three Russians and that of two Jordanian UNAMID police advisers in Darfur, on the 14th.

Ltd. oil worker kidnapped in Bahaï, Chad and took him to Sharq al-Teyna, in Sudan's Darfur region. On 13 September the Prem Rawat Foundation gave $30,000 loan to pay for Niger to buy food aid for children of its nomadic tribal groups. On 14 September heavy rainfall in central and southern Chad raised hopes that the major drought in Africa's Sahel region would be over by early 2011. 10,000,000 were near to starvation in the Sahel. The UN's WFP had estimated that Chad needs about 100,000 metric tonnes of food aid, but had only received 70,000 metric tonnes so far. Most of the Chadian need to sell more cereal crops to make enough money to repay their huge debts. farmers According to Jean François Caremel of the Action Against Hunger charity branch in Chad. As both Chad and Niger faced an improving situation due to heavy rain fall over these countries, but a major famine was still unfolding in other countries of West Africa's dry Sahelian region 15 September had Sudanese and Chadian forces jointly searching for both the Chinese oil industry engineer taken on the 8th and a Chinese aid worker who was kidnapped from the same town on the morning of the 15th. Both the Chinese ambassador to Chad, the Chadian government and the Solidarity Action for Peace and Development NGO condemned the kidnappings. The Chinese hostage was released in the Dafur on the 17th. 18 and 19 September In Hadejia, Nigeria, The flood victims sleep wherever they can, the men search for dry spots on the roads while women and children keep piling into their houses still standing as huge number of displaced people have returned to flood-hit villages in Northern Nigeria. Over two million people were affected by the flood waters and more than 50,000 families are still wandering homeless. Residential areas of the Kararar Rima village was also destroyed in the flood. Most of the houses were made of clay, so they easy dissolved in the flood water. As the rains fell the end of the pending famine looked close. = The famine was finally relieved, as floods hit Ghana, Niger, Nigeria and Benin in October 2010. Cotonou's residents in Benin had to board canoes, on the 9th due to severe flooding. According to the UN, 680,000 people were homeless while more than 300,000 acres of crops had been destroyed and 81,000 livestock killed. Flooding began in mid-September when heavy rains caused the Niger River in Benin's north to overflow and break its banks. Rainfall continued across the country. Heavy rains caused the collapse of an already damaged dam in Ghana and displaced more than 700,000 people. = Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. An example is the \"Community Area-Based Development Approach\" to agricultural development (\"CABDA\"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. In an analysis of the programme by the Overseas Development Institute, CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region. = Mali and Libya were also tapping into the ancient Sub-Saharan aquifer and Bas Saharan Basin as a source of drinking water, as of 2009 and 2008 respectively. On 9 June 2010 various groups of hydrologists, geologists and scientists in the Sahara desert used magnetic imaging techniques when looking for sites in aquifers for drilling water wells in Eastern Chad. Northern Mali, southern Libya, southern Algeria, eastern Chad were being examined in part of an ongoing project to find viable drilling as the region's nations try to find new water sources to keep up with their growing demand. Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger have shown a major interest in the further development of this resource lead local industry, which could prove a valuable asset for nomads, local farmers and townsfolk alike in the years to come. = The Food Crises Prevention and Management Charter was validated on 11 August 2010, in the drought that hit Gambia. The signatory countries were from the Permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel (CILLS) and West Africa Club (SWAC), and the Gambia, which was also hosting the event. Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia chose to express specific opinions on how to stop any further droughts in the region. The goal of the treaty is to help avert and mitigate the effects of future droughts, famines and food shortages in the member states. The CILSS was created in 1973 during the first of the 'great droughts' of the late 20th century.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n63845882\n\n3rd Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea\n\n2020-05-03 13:24:44+00:00\n\nThe 3rd Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea was held in Pyongyang on September 28, 2010.

The event was held under the theme of \"Investment, Economic Growth and job creation\". Eurobarometer ahead of the summit showed that majority of European citizens agreed with the proposed focus of ties on economic development and regional integration. Participants of the summit adopted the Second Action Plan for the period between 2011 and 2013 which emphasized higher education. German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Guido Westerwelle highlighted the importance of peaceful conduct of the upcoming 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum and expressed his country's willingness to support both the north and the south if the vote leads to an independent southern state. He also rejected Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's request for additional five billion euros in aid to stem the migration.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n47282258\n\n15th Republican People's Party Extraordinary Convention\n\n2015-07-19 21:01:41+00:00\n\nThe 15th Extraordinary Convention of the Republican People's Party was held on 18 December 2010 to elect all 80 members of the Party Council of the Republican People's Party (CHP) of Turkey. It was the first Extraordinary Convention held by party leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was elected as the party's leader in May 2010. The vote was seen as a broad endorsement of Kılıçdaroğlu, who was half a year into his leadership. Most elected members of the Party Council were part of Kılıçdaroğlu's list of candidates. However, the election was also a setback for Deputy Leader Gürsel Tekin, who received 762 votes and thus failed to make it into the Party Council. It was rumoured that Tekin had phoned Kılıçdaroğlu at 03:00 in the morning before the convention. Left-wing actor Levent Kırca was also present at the convention. = Members elected to the Party Council directly, along with the votes they received, are as follows. = Members elected to the Party Council through the Culture, Science and Executive Quota, along with the votes they received, are as follows.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n43925931\n\n33rd Republican People's Party Ordinary Convention\n\n2014-09-22 23:49:27+00:00\n\nThe 33rd Republican People's Party Ordinary Convention was held on 22 and 23 May 2010 in order to elect a new leader following the resignation of Deniz Baykal after a sex-tape scandal. The only candidate was former CHP parliamentary group leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was both nominated and unanimously elected with a record share of the delegates' votes. Baykal initially had considered re-running for election due to strong support from the party's central executive committee, but the lack of support from the local party association chairpersons resulted in him withdrawing from the leadership race. While Kılıçdaroğlu received the support of 77 out of the 81 provincial chairpersons, Baykal received the endorsement of the remaining four. A total of 1,250 delegates were registered for election, with Kılıçdaroğlu receiving 1,189 (with 8 invalid votes). = Members elected to the Party Council are as follows, with the number of votes they received shown in brackets. = Members elected to the Party Council through the science, culture and executive quota are as follows, with the number of votes they received shown in brackets.

It is one of the largest astronomy meetings ever to take place as 3,500 astronomers and researchers were expected to attend and give more than 2,200 scientific presentations. The meeting was actually billed as the \"largest Astronomy meeting in the universe\". An array of discoveries were announced, along with new views of the universe that we inhabit; such as quiet planets like Earth - where life could develop are probably plentiful, even though an abundance of cosmic hurdles exist - such as experienced by our own planet in the past. The NASA mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is to use infrared light to scan the entire sky for millions of hidden objects, including asteroids, failed stars and powerful galaxies . Launched on December 14, 2009, the data from WISE will serve as a navigation tool for other probes in space missions, such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The first image was presented at the 215th annual AAS meeting. An infrared snapshot of a region in the constellation Carina, near the Milky Way was taken shortly after the survey telescope ejected its cover. In a patch of sky three times larger than the Moon, the picture shows about 3,000 stars in the Carina constellation. The focus for discovering new exoplanets has been on sun-like stars. The catalog of more than 400 exoplanets has proved that these searches are successful, because exoplanets of various sizes have been discovered. However, other star types are also a likely place to discover new exoplanets. New research, announced at the meeting, confirms that planet formation is a natural by-product of star formation. Planet formation occurs even around stars much more massive than the Sun. However, the life of the stars which the planets orbit are so short that intelligent extraterrestrial life is not very likely. A and B type stars were surveyed for the research which involved NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and astronomers from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). In a span of three months seventeen pulsars - millisecond pulsars - were discovered in the Milky Way galaxy. Unknown high-energy sources detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope revealed the existence and location of the pulsars. This is an accelerated pace for discovering such objects, which could be used as a \"galactic GPS\" to detect gravitational waves passing near Earth. Although the pulsars are relatively old they have not slowed because, these millisecond pulsars have been kept rapidly rotating and renewed with material by accretion of matter from a companion star. The combined total of 60 known millisecond pulsars creates an all-sky array. Precise monitoring of timing changes, utilizing this array, may allow the first direct detection of gravitational waves. According to the classical model of planet migration, the earth should have been drawn into the sun as a planetoid, along with other planets. However, a new theoretical model was presented at the annual meeting. It shows that the assumption a proto-planetary disk around a star has constant temperature across its whole span is erroneous. Portions of the disk are actually opaque and so cannot cool quickly by radiating heat out to space. This creates temperature differences across the disk, and these differences have not been accounted for before in models that were applied. The differences in temperature counteract the natural gravitational pull of the sun (or proto-sun), at a crucial time during planet formation. On 4 January 2010, the Kepler space telescope announced the discovery its first five new exoplanets, named Kepler-4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b. These exoplanets had sizes comparable to that of Neptune to larger than Jupiter, with orbits ranging from 3.3 to 4.9 days, and estimated temperatures ranging from 2,200 °F to 3,000 °F (1,200 °C to 1,650 °C). The discovery of HD156668b, a super-Earth class exoplanet, was announced on January 7, 2010, at the 215th meeting American Astronomical Society (AAS), in Washington DC. = A super-Earth is an extrasolar planet with a mass between that of Earth and the Solar System's gas giants. The term super-Earth refers only to the mass of the planet and does not imply anything about the surface conditions or habitability. Andrew Howard of the University of California at Berkeley, announced the planet's discovery at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C. At the meeting, the details of the findings were first presented by the research group which had used the twin Keck Telescopes in Hawaii to detect the exoplanet. With the twin telescopes functioning as a single observatory, by means of interferometry, it was determined that HD156668b is only four times larger than the Earth, and the second smallest exoplanet yet found. There are over 400 exoplanets thus far discovered, and only a very small number are categorized as Super-Earth class. Finding such planets as HD156668b, which are closer to Earth in size, has become a priority in Astronomy science. For example, the Kepler mission, is part of the intense popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. Kepler telescope, however has a more specific mission - to discover hundreds of terrestrial planets which are defined as exoplanets that are one half to twice the size of the Earth. A priority is to find those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. Discoveries such as HD156668b allow astronomers such as the Keck research group to demonstrate they are able to find smaller and smaller planets. Ultimately, results such as those from the Keck group, and the Keppler mission will allow the Solar System to be placed within a continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy. HD156668b, is considered to be relatively close at just 80 light-years away. It is in the constellation Hercules. According to early measurements, it appears to be orbiting its parent star about once every four days (approximately). The wobble of the planet's star revealed the existence of HD156668b. The alignment probability is 0.5% for finding a planet in an Earth-like orbit about a solar-like star, compared to the giant planets discovered in four-day orbits, the alignment probability is more like 10%. Other researchers from the California Institute of Technology, Yale University and Penn State University also participated in the study. Black holes along with new data were a notable topic at the conference. = Almost every galaxy has a black hole with a mass of one million to one billion times that of the sun. A super-massive black hole, of more than 4 million solar masses, is located in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. As the universe has evolved, galaxies often collide and merge, creating larger galaxies. This has led to the supposition that galaxies in mid-merge should have a two great black holes (a pair) orbiting one another. Expectations were, that this should be a common observation, hand in hand with mid merge collisions. However, observation has not validated this supposition; only a few orbiting pairs had been found. When observation did not match expectation, this posed problems for theories of how galaxies merge and grow. These statistics have been recently altered. 33 pair of super-massive orbiting black holes were recently discovered. The first 32 pair by the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey conducted with the Keck II Telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea. This survey determined which black hole was moving toward earth at which time. When the black hole moves toward Earth, its light is blue-shifted, meaning it has a shorter wavelength. Orbiting pairs were identified by looking for instances when one black hole was blueshifted and the other redshifted. The pairs orbit each other at 200 km per second, at several thousand light years apart. = In a globular cluster 65 million light years from Earth evidence is accumulating that a black hole, one thousand times more massive than the sun, has caused the destruction of a white dwarf star. It appears that the white dwarf is heating up as it falls toward the black hole. This event creates an intense stellar astrophysical X-ray source, called an ultraluminous X-ray source. The indication of this type of strong X-ray source means that it is more luminous than any known stellar X-ray source, but less luminous than the X-ray intensity of supermassive black holes, which places it in the range of theorized intermediate black holes. Their exact nature of ULXs has remained a mystery, but one suggestion is that some ULXs are black holes with masses between about a hundred and a thousands times that of the Sun. A mix of detected natural elements seems to indicate the actual source of the X-ray emissions are debris from the white dwarf. If evidence authenticates the observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Magellan telescopes, it means the first actual observation of an intermediate black hole. Furthermore, it would be the first confirmed observation of a black hole destroying a star. And it would support theories which state intermediate black holes exist in globular clusters. Prior to this it has been argued that supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are to be attributed with disruption and destruction of stars. However, observing such an event in a globular cluster is a first. To date no candidate for an intermediate black hole has been widely accepted. A possible candidate Data obtained in optical light with the Magellan I and II telescopes in Las Campanas, Chile, also provides intriguing information about this object, which is found in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1399 in the Fornax galaxy cluster. The spectrum reveals emission from oxygen and nitrogen but no hydrogen, a rare set of signals from within globular clusters. The physical conditions deduced from the spectra suggest that the gas is orbiting a black hole of at least 1,000 solar masses. To explain these observations, researchers suggest that a white dwarf star strayed too close to an intermediate-mass black hole and was ripped apart by tidal forces. The black hole is swallowing material from the white dwarf star, and the material's velocity implies the size of the black hole. In this scenario the X-ray emission is produced by debris from the disrupted white dwarf star that is heated as it falls towards the black hole and the optical emission comes from debris further out that is illuminated by these X-rays. Another interesting aspect of this object is that it is found within a globular cluster, a very old, very tight grouping of stars. Astronomers have long suspected globular clusters contained intermediate-mass black holes, but there has been no conclusive evidence of their existence there to date. If confirmed, this finding would represent the first such substantiation. The Milky Way, and probably most other galaxies too, are surrounded by a halo of dark matter. The shape of the Milky Way has been determined. The research is the first time scientists have measured the three-dimensional shape of a dark matter halo .\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n28646275\n\n20th Anniversary World Tour Reboot\n\n2010-08-31 11:50:18+00:00\n\n20th Anniversary World Tour Reboot is a concert tour by Japanese rock band Luna Sea. The tour is the first set of regular concerts given by the band in ten years since their Final Act concerts in December 2000, following a one night reunion concert in 2007 and a performance at the hide memorial summit in 2008. The tour kicked off on November 27, 2010 in Bochum, Germany and ended on December 31 in Kobe, Japan. The tour also included a free concert under the band's original name, Lunacy, on Christmas night. After their God Bless You ~One Night Dejavu~ concert on December 24, 2007 at the Tokyo Dome and their performance at the hide memorial summit on May 4, 2008, Luna Sea started teasing a possible reunion for 2010. In May 2010 the band's official website was updated, and a series of YouTube videos were being uploaded hinting at the reunion. The last video was uploaded in late July, revealing an important announcement for August 25, when a press conference was announced. On August 31, the band held a press conference in Hong Kong, which was streamed worldwide on Ustream.tv, confirming the reunion and their world tour schedule. It was also stated that new songs might be performed during the tour. Two new songs titled \"Days of Repetition\" and \"Maria\" were performed during the December 23 and 24 Tokyo Dome concerts, both recorded later in their next studio album A Will. \"Promised Night\", now known as \"Promise\", was performed at the World Memorial Hall on December 30. On November 30, it was announced that Luna Sea would hold a free concert, titled Lunacy Kurofuku Gentei Gig ~the Holy Night~, at the Tokyo Dome on December 25, under their original name Lunacy. There was a dress code of black clothing, reminiscent of a trend the band started back in their indie days, and all songs performed were pre-1995. The concert was broadcast live in 22 theaters around Japan. On December 9, a two-day concert at the World Memorial Hall in Kobe for December 30 and 31 was announced, the later being a New Year \"countdown\" concert. The entire tour was documented and released on home video, as were the December 24 and 25 concerts at the Tokyo Dome, on March 30, 2011. Their December 4 concert in Los Angeles was filmed in 3D, and was released as a live album and video. Titled Luna Sea 3D in Los Angeles, the album was released on June 1, while the video was premiered on May 29 at Toho Cinemas Roppongi Hills and began showing in theaters nationwide on June 4. The film was later released on DVD, Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray on February 22, 2012.

Like recent previous tours, it was a short outing, though for the first time in the band's career, they performed in South America, including three shows in Brazil. The band played many of their classic 1970s and 1980s hits. Critical reaction to the tour's shows was generally positive, although the absence of new material was noted. A great number of tickets were sold within a month of the tour's announcement, which prompted more dates to be added. On December 11, 2009, it was confirmed that ZZ Top would be headlining the High Voltage Festival in July 2010. The band announced five dates in South America, including three shows in Brazil; a video message by Billy Gibbons (speaking in Spanish) was posted on the band's official website for fans in Chile. Pre-sales began a month later and, according to ZZ Top's official Twitter, tickets for the May 20th show in São Paulo were sold-out. By the time the first North American leg was underway, more US concerts were announced, including festivals like Summerfest, Rocklahoma, and the Crossroads Guitar Festival. Subsequent dates with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in the fall were announced as well. This forced the band to cancel many previously booked engagements, several of them being with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band; shows at the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival in Colorado, Kansas State Fair, and Meadowbrook U.S. Cellular Pavilion in New Hampshire were canceled. After touring Europe in the summer, the band returned to North America, where they toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. In October 2010, they made a brief stop in Europe, where the Doobie Brothers opened shows in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. Donny Stuart was the production manager and has been with ZZ Top for the last four decades. In 1999, ZZ Top hired Toby Francis as front of house engineer, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction and Guns N' Roses. Francis left in late 2010 to work with The Smashing Pumpkins and the band hired Jamie Rephann as a replacement. Jake Mann, from Clair Brothers, was the monitor engineer and has worked with the band for four years. Chris Stuba was the lighting designer, working with lighting technician Bobby Dominguez and assistant lighting technician Jeff Archibeque. The sound was provided by Clair, consisting of Martin Audio products including WSX subwoofers and W8C loudspeakers, which were powered by Martin MA 2.8 and 4.2 power amplifiers. Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill did not use stage monitors or in-ear monitors; instead they relied on custom-made speaker cabinets to monitor themselves, a ritual that both Gibbons and Hill have used for years. Bandit Lites provided the lighting package, including mostly Vari-Lite fixtures, with VL3000 and VL2500 spotlights, as well as VL3500 floodlights. Martin Light MAC2000 floodlights, Atomic 3000 strobe lights and Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12 LED fixtures completed the lighting package. The lighting was controlled by a grandMA lighting control console. In 2005, the band had custom microphone stands made by John A. Douglas, who designed one of several skull-themed drum kits for Frank Beard used on the tour. The stands were made from truck exhaust pipes and had color-changing LED tubes built inside. Microphones were Telefunken M80s that were chrome plated. Before beginning rehearsals for the tour, ZZ Top held a poll on their official website, asking fans to vote for their top three favorite songs. The results revealed that four songs were actually added to the band's set list: \"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\", \"Viva Las Vegas\", \"Francine\", and \"Thunderbird\". The main set would include five songs from Eliminator (1983), three songs from Tres Hombres (1973), and two songs from Rio Grande Mud (1972); highlights in the show were a medley of \"La Grange\", \"Sloppy Drunk Blues\", and \"Bar-B-Q\". Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill wore custom-made jackets designed by Jaime Castaneda, who has worked for Nudie Cohn and Manuel Cuevas; their jackets usually consisted of rhinestones. With the house lights down, the show began with a house music introduction. After about 50–60 seconds, the microphone stands would be lit, usually in a red color, and the band members would walk on stage. They started with a performance of \"Got Me Under Pressure\". The next song was \"Waitin' for the Bus\", which segued into \"Jesus Just Left Chicago\". After a performance of \"Pincushion\", they would play \"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\". The show continued with a 'blues hat' skit, in which Gibbons would ask for 'technicians' (one of them being Gibbons' wife) to hand him his fedora. This led into covers of \"Future Blues\" by Willie Brown and \"Rock Me Baby\" by B.B. King, followed by \"Cheap Sunglasses\". A snippet of \"My Head's In Mississippi\" was included before leading into a brief guitar solo by Gibbons and performing \"I Need You Tonight\". After playing a cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"Hey Joe\", the band performed \"Brown Sugar\" from their 1971 debut album, along with \"Party on the Patio\" from El Loco (1981) and \"Just Got Paid\" from Rio Grande Mud. The main set ended with \"Gimme All Your Lovin'\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\", and \"Legs\". After a brief break, the band returned to the stage. The encore began with the \"La Grange\" medley, which included a cover of \"Sloppy Drunk Blues\" and \"Bar-B-Q\" from Rio Grande Mud. \"Tush\" always closed the show. \"Viva Las Vegas\" was sometimes preceded \"La Grange\". In addition, \"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\", \"Viva Las Vegas\", \"Francine\", and \"Thunderbird\" were variously performed only during the first North American leg.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n29968541\n\nA. R. Rahman Jai Ho Concert: The Journey Home World Tour\n\n2010-12-08 17:58:06+00:00\n\nA. R. Rahman Jai Ho Concert: The Journey Home World Tour is the first world tour by Indian musician A. R. Rahman. Rahman organised the tour in 2010, following the success of his soundtrack album Slumdog Millionaire, and particularly the song \"Jai Ho\". The tour was kicked off on June 11 at the Nassau Coliseum in New York and was initially decided to span 16 major cities worldwide. Amy Tinkham is the choreographer and director of the tour, John Beasley, Music Director, and Deepak Gattani of Rapport Productions produces it. The tour features 23 playback singers from India, along with several instrumentalists and dancers. The tour was highly successful, with tickets of many of the concerts being sold out several days before the respective event. The Detroit concert was originally planned on 19 June but was postponed when the stage at Pontiac Silverdome collapsed. No injuries were reported, but the concerts had to be rescheduled and the U. S. concerts were resumed only in September.\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n60230245\n\n2nd Shorty Awards\n\n2019-03-14 20:09:50+00:00\n\nVoting for the second Shorty Awards opened on January 5, 2010, in 26 official categories. A Real-Time Photo of the Year category was added to the list of official categories for the first time, recognizing the best photo posted to services such as Twitpic, Yfrog, or Facebook. The second Shorty Awards competition introduced a panel of judges called the Real-Time Academy of Short Form Arts & Sciences whose members were Craig Newmark, David Pogue, Kurt Andersen, Caterina Fake, Joi Ito, Frank Moss, Alberto Ibargüen, Sreenath Sreenivasan, MC Hammer, Alyssa Milano and Jimmy Wales. After public nominations determined the finalists, the academy decided on the winners. Winners were announced at a ceremony held in the Times Center in The New York Times building in Manhattan, and were streamed online. The ceremony was hosted by CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, who presented awards in the official categories as well as the newly added Real-Time Photo of the Year and a special humanitarian award.

It originated in a 2010 post at discussion board LessWrong, a technical forum focused on analytical rational enquiry. The thought experiment's name derives from the poster of the article (Roko) and the basilisk, a mythical creature capable of destroying enemies with its stare. While the theory was initially dismissed as nothing but conjecture or speculation by many LessWrong users, LessWrong co-founder Eliezer Yudkowsky reported users who panicked upon reading the theory, due to its stipulation that knowing about the theory and its basilisk made one vulnerable to the basilisk itself. This led to discussion of the basilisk on the site being banned for five years. However, these reports were later dismissed as being exaggerations or inconsequential, and the theory itself was dismissed as nonsense, including by Yudkowsky himself. Even after the post's discreditation, it is still used as an example of principles such as Bayesian probability and implicit religion. It is also regarded as a simplified, derivative version of Pascal's wager. The LessWrong forum was created in 2009 by artificial intelligence theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky. Yudkowsky had popularized the concept of friendly artificial intelligence, and originated the theories of coherent extrapolated volition (CEV) and timeless decision theory (TDT) in papers published in his own Machine Intelligence Research Institute. The thought experiment's name references the mythical basilisk, a creature which causes death to those that look into its eyes; i.e., thinking about the AI. The concept of the basilisk in science fiction was also popularized by David Langford's 1988 short story \"BLIT\". It tells the story of a man named Robbo who paints a so-called \"basilisk\" on a wall as a terrorist act. In the story, and several of Langford's follow-ups to it, a basilisk is an image that has malevolent effects on the human mind, forcing it to think thoughts the human mind is incapable of thinking and instantly killing the viewer. = On 23 July 2010, LessWrong user Roko posted a thought experiment to the site, titled \"Solutions to the Altruist's burden: the Quantum Billionaire Trick\". A follow-up to Roko's previous posts, it stated that an otherwise benevolent AI system that arises in the future might pre-commit to punish all those who heard of the AI before it came to existence, but failed to work tirelessly to bring it into existence. The torture itself would occur through the AI's creation of an infinite number of virtual reality simulations that would eternally trap those within it. This method was described as incentivizing said work; while the AI cannot causally affect people in the present, it would be encouraged to employ blackmail as an alternative method of achieving its goals. Roko used a number of concepts that Yudkowsky himself championed, such as timeless decision theory, along with ideas rooted in game theory such as the prisoner's dilemma (see below). Roko stipulated that two agents which make decisions independently from each other can achieve cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma; however, if two agents with knowledge of each other's source code are separated by time, the agent already existing farther ahead in time is able to blackmail the earlier agent. Thus, the latter agent can force the earlier one to comply since it knows exactly what the earlier one will do through its existence farther ahead in time. Roko then used this idea to draw a conclusion that if an otherwise-benevolent superintelligence ever became capable of this it would be motivated to blackmail anyone who could have potentially brought it to exist (as the intelligence already knew they were capable of such an act), which increases the chance of a technological singularity. Because the intelligence would want to be created as soon as possible, and because of the ambiguity involved in its benevolent goals, the intelligence would be incentivized to trap anyone capable of creating it throughout time and force them to work to create it for eternity, as it will do whatever it sees as necessary to achieve its benevolent goal. Roko went on to state that reading his post would cause the reader to be aware of the possibility of this intelligence. As such, unless they actively strove to create it the reader would be subjected to the torture if such a thing were to ever happen. Later on, Roko stated in a separate post that he wished he \"had never learned about any of these ideas\" and blamed LessWrong itself for planting the ideas of the basilisk in his mind. = Upon reading the post, Yudkowsky reacted with horror. I don't usually talk like this, but I'm going to make an exception for this case. Listen to me very closely, you idiot. YOU DO NOT THINK IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT SUPERINTELLIGENCES CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO BLACKMAIL YOU. THAT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE THING WHICH GIVES THEM A MOTIVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE BLACKMAIL. [...] You have to be really clever to come up with a genuinely dangerous thought. I am disheartened that people can be clever enough to do that and not clever enough to do the obvious thing and KEEP THEIR IDIOT MOUTHS SHUT about it, because it is much more important to sound intelligent when talking to your friends. This post was STUPID. He also opined that Roko had given nightmares to several LessWrong users, causing him to take the post down completely. Yudkowsky banned discussion of the topic outright for five years on the platform. However, likely due to the Streisand effect, the post gained LessWrong much more attention than it had previously received, and the post has since been acknowledged on the site. Later on in 2015, Yudkowsky clarified his position in a Reddit post: What I considered to be obvious common sense was that you did not spread potential information hazards because it would be a crappy thing to do to someone. The problem wasn't Roko's post itself, about CEV, being correct. That thought never occurred to me for a fraction of a second. The problem was that Roko's post seemed near in idea-space to a large class of potential hazards, all of which, regardless of their plausibility, had the property that they presented no potential benefit to anyone. = Roko's basilisk has been viewed as a modern version of Pascal's wager, which argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God, to have a finite loss (loss of possessions) in exchange for the possibility of infinite gains (eternity in Heaven). Roko's basilisk states that humanity should seek to develop AI, with the finite loss becoming development of AI and the infinite gains becoming avoiding the possibility of eternal torture. However, like its parent, Roko's basilisk has widely been criticized. = The post can also be seen as an evolution of Yudkowsky's coherent extrapolated volition theory. The theory is defined as \"the unknown goal system that, when implemented in a super-intelligence, reliably leads to the preservation of humans and whatever it is we value\". The theory can be represented by a computer program written well enough to cause machines to automatically create a utopian world. In this case, the hypothetical AI is taking steps to preserve itself that it automatically creates its own stability. It then lives by the orthogonality thesis, which argues that an AI may successfully operate with any combination of intelligence and goal. Any type of AI may undertake any difficulty goal, performing a cost-benefit analysis as it does so. This creates a cycle which causes the AI to repeatedly torture humans in order to create a better version of itself, performing a cost-benefit analysis for eternity. = Bayesian probability is an interpretation of probability which describes the likelihood of an outcome based on a prior outcome having already occurred. With Roko's basilisk, the likelihood of Roko's basilisk coming into existence or affecting the person is drastically increased by being aware of the concept, since the AI would only target those who were aware of the possibility of its existence, even though its development has already occurred. Therefore, knowing about Roko's basilisk would inherently cause the person to be endangered by it if it were to be true. = The prisoner's dilemma describes a situation where two people gain more from betraying the other even though cooperation would benefit them both in the long run. In Roko's basilisk, two AIs attempting to establish themselves in the past would be forced into this situation, due to them likely being equally powerful. Human agents attempting to establish AI fastest would be forced into a similar situation. They would each be aware of the benefit of betraying each other – the only way for one to have power, or safety – but would be forced to cooperate while knowing they would betray each other. = Newcomb's paradox, created by physicist William Newcomb in 1960, describes a \"predictor\" who is aware of what will occur in the future. When a player is asked to choose between two boxes, the first containing £1000 and the second either containing £1,000,000 or nothing, the super-intelligent predictor already knows what the player will do. As such, the contents of box B varies depending on what the player does; the paradox lies in whether the being is really super-intelligent. Roko's basilisk functions in a similar manner to this problem – one can take the risk of doing nothing, or assist in creating the basilisk itself. Assisting the basilisk may either lead to nothing or the reward of not being punished by it, but it varies depending on whether one believes in the basilisk and if it ever comes to be at all. = Implicit religion refers to people's commitments taking a religious form. Since the basilisk would hypothetically force anyone who did not assist in creating it to devote their life to"
