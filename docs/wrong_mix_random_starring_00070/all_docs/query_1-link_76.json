        "text": "“Preservation of one's own culture does not require contempt or disrespect for other cultures.” – Cesar Chavez\n\nBAM celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month by appreciating 101 Latinx Leaders in tech. According to the 2020 Census Bureau, the Hispanic population grew 23% since 2010, making up 18.5% of the US population at 62.1 million in 2020. Despite this fact, Hispanic and Latinx founders and VCs are underappreciated in the tech industry making up only 8% of tech employees. With this list, BAM wants to acknowledge the accomplishments and achievements of various Hispanic and Latinx leaders within our industry. These Latinx leaders have not been listed by priority because they are all important to our community. BAM stands in solidarity with and celebrates diverse communities. Our goal is to hear, share, and celebrate stories less told.\n\nDon't see your favorite Latinx leaders? Please contact us and share your thoughts.\n\n1.
