Research into the psychological restoration process can help assist in alleviating these issues. Existing research on restoration perspectives has predominantly centred on university students and lacks comprehensive insights into older adults. Consequently, this study seeks to acquire a deeper understanding of the restorative theory framework within the context of ageing populations. We identified and analysed thirty-nine papers on the restoration process of older adults employing the scoping review method. Our findings indicate that adjustments to the general restorative theory framework are imperative for ageing populations. By incorporating additional features—such as being with and familiarity—the framework can more effectively support the development of age-inclusive neighbourhoods that enhance the mental health of the older population and facilitate healthy ageing-in-place. While more in-depth research is required on the restoration process of older adults, this research marks the initial in adapting the general framework to ageing populations. Furthermore, insight is given into how the adapted framework can contribute to help address the challenges of global ageing and support ageing-in-place.

TCEs are immigrants who live and work in the country of settlement while providing caregiving across international borders. Purposive and snowball sampling resulted in the participation of 29 TCEs of Pakistani, Syrian, African, and South American origin living in London, Ontario. Thematic analysis of the dataset using the ATLAS.ti software, Version 23.2.1., generated three themes: (1) feelings associated with transnational care; (2) employment experiences of TCEs; and (3) coping strategies for well-being. The results of the secondary analysis conducted herein suggested that there are more similarities than differences across the four cohorts. Many participants felt a sense of satisfaction at being able to fulfill their care obligations; however, a different outlook was observed among some Syrian and African origin respondents, who disclosed that managing care and work is overwhelming. Most TCEs also reported facing limited job options because of language barriers. While various interviewees experienced a lack of paid work and reduced income after COVID-19, a distinct perspective was noted from African descent TCEs as they expressed facing increased work demands after the pandemic. Participants additionally revealed four common coping strategies such as keeping busy, praying, family support, and staying active. Study implications include the promotion of Carer-Friendly Workplace Policies (CFWPs) that can facilitate the welfare of unpaid caregivers. This research is important as it may inform policymakers to create opportunities that may not only foster economic stability of TCEs and the Canadian economy, but also contribute towards a more equitable society.

Our aim was to evaluate the frequency and the presence of risk factors for persisting COVID-19 symptoms in children. We carried out a prospective observational study of the clinical manifestation of Long COVID at the Department of Maternal Infantile Science of a tertiary University hospital in Rome. We included 697 children (0–18 years), with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children and parents were asked questions regarding persistent symptoms of COVID-19. Children with symptoms 30 days after initial diagnosis were 185/697 (26.4%). Moreover, 81/697 (11.6%) patients presented symptoms 90 days after the diagnosis. Thirty-day-persisting symptoms were mostly present in children with anosmia, atopy, asthenia, and cough in the acute phase compared with the asymptomatic children 30 days after infection. After 90 days, symptoms described were mainly neurological (47/697 children, 6.7%), and headache (19/697; 2.7%) was the most frequent manifestation. In conclusion, a relatively large proportion of the patients reported persisting symptoms that seem to be related to the symptom burden and to the atopy. Ninety days after the infection, most of the children had recovered, showing that long-term effects are not frequent. Limitations of the study include the single-center design and the lack of a control group.

Current surveys are predominantly centred within a biomedical paradigm, with the constructs mismatched with Indigenous worldviews. We aimed to develop and deploy an accessible and culturally grounded survey exploring Māori health, wellbeing, and disability using a Kaupapa Māori Research methodology. An extensive codesign process with Māori community partners interrogated all aspects of the design to ensure the process and outcomes met the needs of Māori. A large-scale, nationally representative survey of people of Māori descent was conducted. We used a multi-modal deployment approach that included online and alternate methods of completion. Our analysis included a novel dual-weighting system to ensure generalisability of results to the national Māori population. This achieved a survey of 7230 participants, a sample size comparable with government-administered surveys. The response rate was 11.1%, with 7.3% opting for alternate methods. A high completion rate of 93.4% was observed. This approach demonstrated a high level of engagement, resulting in an unprecedented collection of Māori health, wellbeing, and disability data. This highlights the importance of Indigenous codesign for ensuring accessible and culturally appropriate survey methods.

Pandemic-associated increases in youth’s body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) have been attributed to decreases in reported physical activity; few studies have examined changes in food intake. We therefore examined changes in total energy, nutrient consumption, BMI, BMIz, and adiposity longitudinally over 3 years, comparing healthy youth aged 8–17 years assessed twice prior to the pandemic, to youth seen once before and once during the pandemic. The total energy intake and percent macronutrient consumption were assessed using a standardized, laboratory-based, buffet-style meal. Height and weight were measured and adiposity was collected via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Generalized linear model univariate analyses investigated differences between groups. One-hundred-fifteen youth (15.6 + 2.8 years 47.8% female; 54.8% White) from the Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia greater metropolitan area participated. In this secondary analysis, neither changes in total energy intake (p = 0.52) nor changes in nutrient consumption were significantly different between the two groups (ps = 0.23–0.83). Likewise, changes in BMI, BMIz, and adiposity (ps = 0.95–0.25) did not differ by group. Further research should investigate food intake and body composition, comparing youth with and without overweight/obesity to better identify those at greatest risk of excess weight gain during the pandemic.

In this time-series analysis, all drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Drugs categorized as NSAIDs (M01A), and other analgesics and antipyretics (N02B) were included for analysis. The outcome was the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 inhabitants/year for NSAIDs and analgesics in each town. Covariates referred to characteristics of public oral health services, such as coverage, estimates of dental procedures, and frequency of toothache. Linear time-series regression models were used to determine the influence of covariates on the outcome. Overall, there were 58,482 prescriptions of NSAIDs recorded in thirty-eight towns, while 47,499 prescriptions of analgesics in forty-three towns. For each year, there was a 0.38 (p < 0.001), and 0.28 (p < 0.001) increase in the average log of DDD/1000 inhabitants/year for NSAIDs and analgesics, respectively. A positive association was detected between toothache (p < 0.001) and the prescription of NSAIDs. Over the eleven years, there was a general rising trend in the prescriptions. Toothache was the only characteristic of public oral health services associated with the prescription rates of NSAIDs, implying that as the frequency of toothaches increase, so do the prescriptions of NSAIDs in the studied towns.

A detailed program description was produced to conduct a realist evaluation with a Context-Mechanism-Outcome configuration, followed by a program theory evaluation through the construction of a retrospective program logic model. Dedicated kitchen and garden spaces, knowledgeable teachers committed to the program, provision of sufficient materials and consumables, and support from the school and community were found to be the basic requirements to establish a program. Additionally, it is essential to integrate both the kitchen and garden teaching components into the school curriculum. The positive outcomes (e.g., engagement, participation, knowledge, skills, behavioral change) of the program were dependent on the underlying factors, including dedicated support of school leadership, teaching staff, and the parent body for effective student engagement in the teaching spaces and for wider engagement from families and the community. The students’ feedback provided supporting evidence of increased food literacy with improvements in their understanding, abilities, and attitudes towards gardening, producing healthy food, and preparing food. This may further lead to enhanced food security for students’ families and the broader community.

Due to the lack of experimental research on this subject, the current study aimed to investigate the bio-physiological effects of a generated 3.5 GHz frequency. For this purpose, the wake electroencephalograms (EEG) of 34 healthy volunteers were explored during two “real” and “sham” exposure sessions. The electromagnetic fields were antenna-emitted in an electrically shielded room and had an electrical field root-mean-square intensity of 2 V/m, corresponding to the current outdoor exposure levels. The sessions were a maximum of one week apart, and both contained an exposure period of approximately 26 min and were followed by a post-exposure period of 17 min. The power spectral densities (PSDs) of the beta, alpha, theta, and delta bands were then computed and corrected based on an EEG baseline period. This was acquired for 17 min before the subsequent phases were recorded under two separate conditions: eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). A statistical analysis showed an overall non-significant change in the studied brain waves, except for a few electrodes in the alpha, theta, and delta spectra. This change was translated into an increase or decrease in the PSDs, in response to the EO and EC conditions. In conclusion, this studhy showed that 3.5 GHz exposure, within the regulatory levels and exposure parameters used in this protocol, did not affect brain activity in healthy young adults.

Methods: Participants were patients attending a specialized AF clinic. The multiple mixed-methods design included website design, think-aloud usability test, 1-month unstructured pre-testing analysis using Google Analytics, follow-up interviews, and a non-randomized one-group feasibility test using pre/post online surveys and Google Analytics. Results: Usability testing participants (n = 2) guided adjustments for improving navigation. Pre-testing participants’ (n = 9) website activity averaged four sessions (SD = 2.6) at 10 (SD 8) minutes per session during a 1-month study period. In the feasibility test, 30 patients referred to AF specialty clinic care completed the baseline survey, and 20 of these completed the 6-month follow-up survey. A total of 19 patients accessed the website over the 6 months, and all 30 participants were sent email prompts containing information from the website. Health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, household activity, and AF knowledge scores were higher at follow-up than baseline. There was an overall downward trend in self-reported healthcare utilization at follow-up. Conclusions: Access to a credible education website for patients with AF has great potential to complement virtual and hybrid models of care.

It has been included in sleep-related research because of the potential associations between being overweight and the consumption of meals and snacks. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate associations between sleep timing, meal and snack consumption and weight status in 1333 schoolchildren aged 7–14 years. The midpoint of sleep was used as a sleep timing measure obtained by the midpoint between bedtime and wake-up time, classified as Early, Intermediate, and Late. Schoolchildren in the Early group were less likely to be overweight (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.69; 0.99), and had higher odds of mid-morning snack consumption (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.56; 2.44) and lower probability to consume an evening snack (OR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.59; 0.94) compared with the Intermediate group. The Late group had lower odds of mid-morning snack consumption (OR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.55, 0.80) than the Intermediate group. The consumption of mid-morning and evening snacks was associated with the Early and Late midpoints of sleep. These results suggest that bedtime and wake-up time are relevant to consuming meals and snacks and may also be related to a greater probability of being overweight in children and adolescents.

However, evidence of associations between residential greenspace and birth outcomes remains mixed, limiting the relevance this work holds for urban policy and greening interventions. Past research relies predominantly on cross-sectional designs that are vulnerable to residential selection bias, and rarely tests effect modification by maternal race/ethnicity, which may contribute to heterogeneous findings. This study uses a rigorous, longitudinal sibling comparison design and maternal fixed effect analyses to test whether increases in maternal exposure to residential greenspace between pregnancies precede improved birth outcomes among non-Hispanic (NH) white (n = 247,285) and Black (n = 54,995) mothers (mean age = 28 years) who had at least two consecutive live births in California between 2005 and 2015. Results show that increases in residential greenspace correspond with higher birthweight (coef. = 75.49, 95% CI: 23.48, 127.50) among Black, but not white (coef. = −0.51, 95% CI: −22.90, 21.90), infants. Additional analyses suggest that prior evidence of perinatal benefits associated with residential greenspace among white mothers may arise from residential selection; no such bias is observed for Black mothers. Taken together, these findings support urban greening initiatives in historically under-resourced neighborhoods. Efforts to evenly distribute residential greenspace may reduce persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, an important step towards promoting health equity across the life course.

Aim: To identify the number of medication errors and verify whether this number was associated with increased hospitalization costs for patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Method: This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study evaluated secondary data from patients’ electronic medical records to compile variables, create a model, and survey hospitalization costs. The statistical analysis included calculating medication error rates, descriptive analysis, and simple and multivariate regression. Results: The omission error rate showed the highest number of errors per drug dose (59.8%) and total errors observed in the sample (55.31%), followed by the time error rate (26.97%; 24.95%). The omission error had the highest average when analyzing the entire hospitalization (170.40) and day of hospitalization (13.79). Hospitalization costs were significantly and positively correlated with scheduling errors, with an increase of BRL 121.92 (about USD $25.00) (95% CI 43.09; 200.74), and to prescription errors, with an increase of BRL 63.51 (about USD $3.00) (95% CI 29.93; 97.09). Conclusion: We observed an association between two types of medication errors and increased hospitalization costs in an adult ICU (scheduling and prescription errors).

Aims: To examine clinicians’ attitudes about the involvement of service users and family or supporters in ROP. Methods: A bespoke Qualtrics survey obtained views of mental health clinicians working in an Australian public mental health service about service user and family involvement in ROP, using a five-point Likert scale of agreement and free-text responses. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and content analysis methods. Results: Two hundred and three clinicians completed the survey. Most (79%) clinicians agreed with the statement that service users want clinicians to use ROP principles, and the majority (63%) also ‘strongly believed’ that ROP made a difference to service users’ mental health outcomes. Only 15% ‘strongly agreed’ and 57% somewhat agreed with the statement that service users know what treatment is best for them, and only 20% of clinicians ‘strongly agreed’ that supporters of service users believed in and wanted ROP for their family member or friend. Future directions: This study adds to the literature on clinicians’ views about ROP and shows that although clinicians are supportive of ROP, they also express substantial ambivalence about whether service users and families know what treatment is best. For ROP implementation to be successful, workforce training needs to support clinicians to reflect on these views with service users and families, and to encourage supported decision making. Future studies should focus on changes in clinicians’ views and practice post ROP training.

Materials and Methods: A systematic review involved consulting three databases—EBSCO, the Web of Science, and PubMed—for peer-reviewed and quantitative studies within the period 2000–2023. Nine articles with quality of three and above were included. Results: The presence of callous and unemotional traits designates a group of youth that show characteristics associated with psychopathy, specifically when predicting a more severe and chronic pattern of antisocial behaviour. Children with high rates of callous and unemotional traits, who show symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in combination with severe conduct problems, are most likely to show features associated with psychopathy. The multidimensional psychopathy construct is considered a better predictor of future and stable antisocial behaviour than the callous and unemotional traits alone model. Conclusions: According to the studies selected, the callous and unemotional traits in childhood seem to be precursors of female psychopathy in adulthood, but only because of the way they seem to enhance conduct problems, disruptive behaviour disorders, and, as a possible outcome, delinquency and antisocial traits, which may be precursors of future psychopathy.

This exposure has the potential to cause silicosis, an incurable occupational respiratory lung disease. This study aimed at establishing the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, work behavioral practices and compliance with safety standards and workers’ exposure to respirable dust. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted on 528 mine workers. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for the descriptives. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with latent variables and partial least squares (LVPLS) analysis were employed to determine the relationship among these variables. The results indicated that of the four hypotheses, two were supported, and two were rejected, showing that there is a significant relationship between exposure to respirable dust and work behavioral practices, as well as compliance with safety standards. Knowledge and attitudes toward respirable dust exposure did not significantly influence exposure. According to the results from the survey, positive work behavioral practices as well as compliance with safety standards were significantly associated with exposure to respirable dust. It is recommended that mines should focus on the miners’ work behavioral practices and compliance with safety standards.

Ten individuals with SCI participated in this pilot study. These ten participants followed a 4-week WHM intervention, with one weekly group session in the rehabilitation center and daily practice at home using the WHM app. An in-person exit-interview was conducted post-intervention to collect qualitative information on participants’ experiences, regarding the feasibility and effects of the intervention. Furthermore, tests and questionnaires were administered pre- and post-intervention to assess physical and mental health outcomes. Adherence to the weekly in-person meetings was excellent and no adverse events occurred. Physical and mental health outcomes in this small sample size showed some pre–post differences. This pilot feasibility study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and efficacy of the WHM, including mindset and breathing exercises, on physical and mental health of people with SCI. These results warrant a randomized-controlled trial, including cold exposure, of this novel intervention in people with SCI.

Evaluation in the cardiological ambulatory can be cumbersome as it often requires repeated visits. AIM: To develop and implement CardioShare, a shared-care model where primary care leads patient management, using a compact Holter monitor device with asynchronous remote support from cardiologists. METHODS: CardioShare was developed in a feasibility phase, tested in a pragmatic cluster randomization trial (primary care clinics as clusters), and its implementation potential was evaluated with an escalation test. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the impact of this complex intervention, comprising quantitative observations, semi-structured interviews, and workshops. RESULTS: Between February 2020 and December 2021, 314 patients (30% frail) were included, of whom 75% had AF diagnosed/not found within 13 days; 80% in both groups avoided referral to cardiologists. Patients felt safe and primary care clinicians satisfied. In an escalation test, 58 primary-care doctors evaluated 93 patients over three months, with remote support from four hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: CardioShare was successfully implemented for AF evaluation in primary care.

In this study, we developed a regression model that combines multiple linear regression and a random forest model, exploring the relationship between men’s healthy life expectancy in Japan and regional variables from open sources at the city level as an illustrative case. Optimization of node-splitting in each decision tree was based on the total mean-squared error of multiple regression models in binary-split child nodes. Variations of standardized partial regression coefficients for each city were obtained as the ensemble of multiple trees and visualized on scatter plots. By considering them, interaction terms with piecewise linear functions were exploratorily introduced into a final multiple regression model. The plots showed that the relationship between the healthy life expectancy and the explanatory variables could differ depending on the cities’ characteristics. The procedure implemented here was suggested as a useful exploratory method for flexibly implementing interactions in multiple regression models while maintaining interpretability.

However, the impact of boosted CLTS on household latrine ownership has not been adequately evaluated. This study aims to investigate the factors associated with latrine possession among households, with a specific focus on single and CLTS-boosting implementation. A community-based repeated cross-sectional study was conducted in Siaya County, Kenya, involving 512 households at the baseline and 423 households at the follow-up. Data were analyzed using the mixed-effects logistic regression model. At the baseline, latrine possession was significantly associated with CLTS implementation (adjusted OR [aOR]: 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41–6.44), literacy among households (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.12–2.98) and higher socioeconomic status (SES) (second level: aOR: 2.48; 95% CI:1.41–4.36, third level: aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.76–5.50, fourth level: aOR: 10.20; 95% CI: 5.07–20.54). At follow-up, CLTS boosting (aOR: 7.92; 95% CI: 1.77–35.45) and a higher SES were associated with increased latrine ownership (second level: aOR: 2.04; 95% CI: 0.97–4.26, third level: aOR: 7.73; 95% CI: 2.98–20.03, fourth level: aOR: 9.93; 95% CI: 3.14–28.35). These findings highlight the significant role played by both single and CLST boosting in promoting universal latrine ownership and empowering vulnerable households to understand the importance of sanitation and open defecation-free practices.

We outline a method and protocol to achieve this, namely an Action Research (AR) framework for an Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) in a tertiary health setting. Dogs Offering Support after Stroke (DOgSS) is an AR study at a major tertiary referral hospital. AAI has been reported to improve mood and quality of life for patients in hospitals. Our project objectives included applying for funding, developing a hospital dog visiting Action Research project, and, subsequent to ethics and governance approvals and finance, undertaking and reporting on the Action Research findings. The Action Research project aimed to investigate whether AAI (dog-visiting) makes a difference to the expressed mood of stroke patients and their informal supports (visiting carers/family/friends), and also the impact these visits have on hospital staff and volunteers, as well as the dog handler and dog involved. We provide our protocol for project management and operations, setting out how the project is conducted from conception to assess human and animal wellbeing and assist subsequent decision-making about introducing dog-visiting to the Stroke Unit. The protocol can be used or adapted by other organizations to try to avoid pitfalls and support health promotion in one of the five important action areas of the Ottawa Charter, namely that of reorienting health services.

An online survey comprised of a standardised scale and questions used in previous related studies was completed by 143 early childhood educators across Australia. Participants were asked to report children’s time spent outdoors, access to outdoor space, and restrictions imposed on children’s play during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. The survey responses were imported into SPSS for descriptive, correlation, and ordinal regression analyses. We examined the relationship between children’s outdoor time, space, restrictions imposed on children’s play, and educators’ characteristics, such as qualifications, professional development, and tolerance of risk or staff–child ratios during the pandemic in Australia. Most educators reported that children’s outdoor time and access to outdoor space remained the same compared to before the pandemic, while imposed restrictions on children’s outdoor play increased. The results of ordinal regressions indicated that educators with a higher tolerance of risk were less likely to impose additional restrictions on children’s outdoor play. The findings contribute to the understanding of how educators’ tolerance of risk influences children’s outdoor play opportunities and provide directions for future risk-reframing interventions.

Traditional employment assistance programs can provide support but may not be tailored to some people living with HIV who often experience barriers to work related to their social needs (such as housing instability) or their lack of consistent engagement in the workforce. To understand how people living with HIV return to work, in-depth interviews were conducted with 43 participants enrolled in interventions coordinating HIV care with housing and employment services at eight sites across the US. Four themes emerged on strategies to increase employment: (1) assessing and responding to employment needs that align with their socio-economic environment; (2) using social networks among family and friends for referrals and support; (3) engaging with navigators who are able to connect clients to skills building opportunities and job resources; and (4) addressing the system barriers such as helping with unmet basic needs (e.g. transportation), finding employers who can accommodate workers with income limits associated with public benefits, and helping immigrants, transgender individuals, and people experiencing homelessness secure legal documentsthat facilitate entry into employment by reducing stigmatized identities.

The current study expands the research in this area through an examination of the role of life satisfaction in the relationship between perceived stress and negative indices of mental health. Participants were university students (N = 322) who completed the Perceived Stress Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and short forms of the trait scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale. The results indicate that life satisfaction had a health-sustaining effect on indices of well-being. It also moderated the relationship between perceived stress, on the one hand, and anxiety and hopelessness, on the other hand. Further, life satisfaction played a partial mediating role in the relationship between perceived stress and indices of mental health. The findings suggest that life satisfaction could be a protective factor in the context of stressful life events. Cultivating life satisfaction through mindfulness training and the enhancement of gratitude could potentially sustain mental health.

For most of my life, I have experienced often very serious bouts of poor mental health arising, in part, from childhood abuse, and have been diagnosed with several mental health conditions which constitute disabilities. I have received various conventional treatments and multiple alternative therapies. However, none of these have enabled me to consistently manage my conditions long-term, and I often suffer relapses. As part of the Sapphire Access Scheme, I complete regular quantitative questionnaires regarding the impacts of the CBMPs on my anxiety and have also obtained the clinic’s permission to qualitatively document and write up the impacts of CBMPs on my mental health. Here, I present a preliminary autoethnographic exploration of my lived experiences of CBMP use over the first four months of the trial, which show that even within such a short space of time, CBMPs have had a positive impact on treating what had previously been treatment-refractive chronic anxiety.

Previous studies have reported that emotional problems, such as depression, anxiety, aggression, and conduct problems in children and adolescents, improve through interventions that enhance emotional recognition competency. In this study, we explored whether the emotional recognition ability levels of individual adolescents moderated the pathway of negative parenting on aggression mediated by depression The moderated mediating effect of emotional recognition competency was investigated through examining 2265 first-year high school students using the 2021 data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018. There was no significant moderating effect on the direct pathway from rejective parenting to aggression. The moderating effect of emotional recognition competency on the indirect pathway leading to aggression through depression in rejective parenting was significant. These results suggest that the ability to correctly understand signals related to the emotions of others can play an important role in reducing depression and aggressive behavior by reducing conflict with people around them and experiencing more support.

This study aims to compare three ASGM locations in Indonesia in terms of environmental impacts and potential health problems in the community. As part of this research, field surveys at three ASGM illegal locations with different conditions, observations, literature studies, and interviews with the community and stakeholders were conducted. At each of the survey sites, the potential threat to public health due to the use of mercury was determined to be high. Additionally, many of the environmental impacts detected were deemed to have reached a high-alert stage, in some cases even posing a level of extreme danger. Based on these results, it has become clear that a form of mining management which reduces the negative impacts on the surrounding environment and community health is needed. The suggestions put forward in this paper, including the call for greater control of ASGM, may also be applied in other developing countries which suffer from similar problems and conditions.

The purpose of this mixed methods study is to evaluate the design of a prototype integrating Smart Health Textiles for PI prevention based on feedback from specialist nurses who care for individuals who are prone to or have PIs. This is a mixed methods study. A structured questionnaire was conducted as part of an evaluation of a prototype garment for the prevention of PIs. This questionnaire was applied during the evaluation of the prototype and afterwards focus group discussions were held with experts. Descriptive statistics techniques were used to analyze the data and thematic and integrated content analysis was conducted through concomitant triangulation. Nineteen nurses took part, aged 30 to 39 years (52.6%) and with 12.31 ± 8.96 years of experience. Participants showed that the prototype required more manipulation and physical effort, which interfered its usefulness, in addition to presenting difficulties with the openings and the material of the closure system, which interfered with the ease of use and learning. Overall satisfaction with the product was moderate, with some areas for improvement found, such as satisfaction, recommendations to colleagues, and pleasantness of use. It is concluded that areas for improvement have been found in all dimensions, including in the design of openings and the choice of materials. These findings supply significant insights for improving clothing to meet the needs of healthcare professionals and patients. Full article\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
