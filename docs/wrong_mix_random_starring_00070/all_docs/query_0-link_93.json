        "text": "The observation of Hispanic Heritage Month started in 1968 originally as Hispanic Heritage Week under President Lyndon Johnson and was expanded by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 to cover a 30-day period starting on September 15 and ending on October 15. September 15 is the anniversary of independence for Latin American countries Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In addition, Mexico and Chile celebrate their independence days on September 16 and September18, respectively–and this month also celebrates Columbus Day or Día de la Raza, which is October 12.\n\nIn 2021 NPR published an article titled, “Yes, We're Calling It Hispanic Heritage Month And We Know It Makes Some Of You Cringe,” and after reading it we felt the same. Stories are powerful because of the intentional use of language and information—especially when discussing or highlighting the diverse individuals of a community. With that said, we intentionally titled this list with inclusive language that reflects the diversity of the Latinx/Latine/Latino/Latina/Hispanic individuals building in Tech and Venture.\n\nThis year we are proud to share BAM’s second Latinx/Latine/Latinos/Latinas/Latins/Hispanics in Tech and Venture Capital list. According to a recent SLEI report, Latinx-owned businesses received less than 1% of the $487 billion invested across a sample of the top 500 largest venture capital and private equity deals in 2020.\n\nThese numbers indicate that there is still work to do in raising awareness that ensures equal and fair growth opportunities for Latinx/Latine/Latino/Latina/Latin/Hispanic founders and businesses. This starts with recognizing the individuals who are building in the tech space.\n\nWe are grateful for the outlets and publications that continue to highlight Latinx/Latine/Latino/Latina/Latin/Hispanic people in Tech and VC including Bloomberg Linea, Latinas’ in Tech, HITEC, Techqueria and many more.\n\nDon't see your favorite Latinx/Latine/Latino/Latina/Hispanic leaders in Tech and Venture?
