Permissible Savag’ry

is book probably has its distant origins in the Fijian cannibal fork with which my mother livened up her performance during the “show and tell” period at her girls’ school in Australia. e fork, given to my grandfather by the native Fijians, so the story goes, had been used to eat an earlier missionary. at the story may be apocryphal makes it all the more intriguing, of course, especially in the context of magical realism and narrative invention. Even if the Fijians had invented that other, that eaten missionary in order to cement more closely their friendship with, or alternately, to terrorize and thus to colonize the current one (my grandfather), the story was passed down and believed by my mother, her sisters, their schoolroom audiences, and me. at attraction, of the postcolonial English schoolgirls for the permissible savag’ry of the Fijian cannibal and, more generally, our overcivilized century’s attraction to the “primitive” arts is the starting point for substantial parts of this critical narrative, and also for much—though not all—of the magical realist fiction I consider here. To be deployed fruitfully, this attraction must be understood to contain not only projections of selves but also genuine appreciation of others.

 Introduction

In this book I investigate magical realism in contemporary literature. e term magical realism, coined in the early twentieth century to describe a new, neo-realistic, style in German painting, then applied to Latin American fiction, now designates perhaps the most important contemporary trend in international fiction. Magical realism has become so important as a mode of expression worldwide, especially in postcolonial cultures, because it has provided the literary ground for significant cultural work; within its texts, marginal voices, submerged traditions, and emergent literatures have developed and created masterpieces. Why has it been able to do this? Magical realism radically modifies and replenishes the dominant mode of realism in the West, challenging its basis of representation from within. at destabilization of a dominant form means that it has served as a particularly effective decolonizing agent. Very briefly defined, magical realism combines realism and the fantastic so that the marvelous seems to grow organically within the ordinary, blurring the distinction between them. Furthermore, that combination of realistic and fantastical narrative, together with the inclusion of different cultural traditions, means that magical realism reflects, in both its narrative mode and its cultural environment, the hybrid nature of much postcolonial society. us the mode is multicultural in its very nature, but because it achieved that distinction before that now-ubiquitous term was current, it has played a significant role in the development of a multicultural literary sensibility.1 In other words, magical realism occupies a pivotal position, both reflecting the cultural moment of postcolonialism and achieving substantial work within it. In addition, because of its discursive heterogeneity, magical realism has also contributed to the growth of a postmodern literary sensibility.2 Indeed, 

it constitutes a point of convergence between postmodernism and postcolonialism.3 We should note at the outset, however, that magical realism is not just a postcolonial style. It also represents innovation and the re-emergence of submerged narrative traditions in metropolitan centers. In turn, that phenomenon can be understood in part in the context of literary globalization as a writing back from the peripheral colonies, but only in part. Magical realism’s widespread distribution means that in attempting to define the term and explain the particular power of the mode we need a theoretical perspective that includes the study of formal characteristics spanning different traditions but one that also takes account of interactions between different cultures. My approach, then, combining close analysis of narrative technique with ideas from postcolonial theory, permits an increased understanding of the formal characteristics and cultural work of magical realism, and most important, of the relationship between them, of the ways in which literary forms develop in response to cultural conditions.4 It illustrates how modifications of realistic narrative technique in magical realism are both an index and a result of its cultural situation.5 In developing my ideas about magical realism, the novels on which I have focused include (in chronological order) Juan Rulfo, Pedro Páramo (), Günter Grass, e Tin Drum (), Wilson Harris, Palace of the Peacock (), Gabriel García Márquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude (), Robert Pinget, at Voice (), Maxine Hong Kingston, e Woman Warrior (), Milan Kundera, e Book of Laughter and Forgetting (), Salman Rushdie, Midnight’s Children (), Carlos Fuentes, Aura () and Distant Relations (), D. M. omas, e White Hotel (), Isabel Allende, e House of the Spirits (), William Kennedy, Ironweed (), Patrick Süskind, Perfume (), Toni Morrison, Beloved (), Ben Okri, e Famished Road (), Ana Castillo, So Far from God (), and Marie Darrieussecq, Pig Tales ().6 Other eminent precursors and contemporaries I recall more peripherally are Nikolai Gogol, Henry James, Franz Kafka, Alejo Carpentier, Jorge Luis Borges, Octavio Paz, Julio Cortázar, André Schwarz-Bart, John Updike, Lawrence ornton, José Saramago, Francine Prose, Louise Erdrich, Abby Frucht, Laura Esquivel, and Cristina García. ere are many more; the list is constantly growing.7 Although magical realism has been most widespread in Latin America, my aim here is to continue the critical trend that extends the mode beyond that region, beyond “el boom,” which popularized the term. For that reason I have included relatively few Latin American examples.8 at

Voice appears partly for shock value, because it is not ordinarily considered magical realist writing and is not very similar to its canonical texts. Yet for those very reasons, given its significant points of contact with magical realism through its creation of material metaphors, and its use of voices from beyond the grave, it underscores ways in which magical realism is interwoven with many strands of contemporary fiction. As the preceding list suggests, while I claim to discuss magical realism as a worldwide phenomenon, except for Midnight’s Children and e Famished Road, I have followed my own limitations and confined myself to texts from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. A truly comprehensive study of magical realism in world literature would need to range much more widely and, I suspect, could be extended into other literatures, especially in the Near and Far East.9 I begin my investigation of magical realism by formulating a brief working definition of the mode. In Chapter  I propose five characteristics of magical realism and locate it at the intersection of modernism and postmodernism, engaging both sets of agendas and aesthetics. Working from that basis, in Chapter , I then discuss the way in which magical realism destabilizes realistic representation by means of what I call its “defocalized” narrative. As I explain in more detail there, because it reports events that it does not empirically verify through sensory data, within a realistic, empirically based, fiction, the narrative voice seems to be of uncertain origin, and the narrative is “defocalized.” In addition, because it witnesses and reports events that humans ordinarily do not, and therefore suggests the existence of forces that are not encompassed by reference to ordinary human perceptions of a strictly material reality, magical realism is also imbued with a certain visionary power. us the mode constitutes what we might term a remystification of narrative in the West.10 In Chapter  I propose a textual poetics for magical realism by investigating a series of narrative techniques that it employs. Because magical realism is important as an international style, even though I consider the subject matter of magical realist fictions, my primary concern here is to study how this mode operates as discourse, irrespective of specific thematic content. is approach to magical realism thus corresponds in a comparative context to the kind of cultural analysis James Clifford proposes in studies of cultural identity: an investigation of “what processes rather than essences are involved.”11 After discussing narrative strategies in magical realism, I next investigate

the cultural politics of the mode. Because magical realism is frequently a cultural hybrid, it exemplifies many of the problematic relations that exist between selves and others in postcolonial literature. And because its narrative mode destabilizes the dominant mode of realism, it implicitly attempts to abolish the ethnographic literary authority of Western representation. However, a study of its cultural assumptions and narrative practices reveals that it is also a living record of the difficulties and failures of that attempt, because it cannot help being caught in the very appropriation it seeks to destroy. Such is the case with much of modern and postmodern literature and art. is is the issue I investigate in Chapter , on the postcolonial dynamics of alterity. e chapter deals with the continuing process of literary decolonization, and the complex project of speaking of/with/for cultural others that it entails. e processes that contribute to the decolonizing force of magical realism can also be seen to operate in relation to gender. In that context, magical realism continues the process of patriarchal culture’s disenchantment with itself and its dominant forms of realistic representation begun by surrealism. It has therefore adopted what can be regarded in this context as various traditionally female ways of being and knowing. For example, feminist theoreticians, including Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and Elaine Showalter, among others, have proposed that to speak with a voice that “is not one” within patriarchal culture is a female strategy, so that the multivocal and defocalized narrative of magical realism, which bridges the diverse worlds of realism and fantasy, is double-voiced in the way that female voices have been, integrating both a dominant and a muted mode in a given text. However, like surrealism, magical realism also perpetuates some of patriarchal culture’s stereotypes, using female bodies as a bridge to the beyond, for instance. Because of the importance of these gender issues, in Chapter  I investigate whether it is possible to discern the presence of a female voice in magical realism. In addition to considering novels by women, I also investigate the use of women as narrative enablers in the texts of male magical realists. In short, my basic aims in this study are to explore the importance of magical realism in contemporary literature and its power as a postcolonial narrative style by describing the characteristics that define, the techniques that enable, and the cultural issues that traverse it. roughout this discussion, I suggest connections between magical realist practices and various strands of contemporary thought, most notably with selected accounts of postmodernism, with postcolonial theory, and (in Chapter ) with several

issues in feminist theory and criticism, but, clearly, a thorough investigation of such connections would be a whole other book. Since I began the study of magical realism as a global trend with a paper given at the International Comparative Literature Association in , nearly twenty years ago, the number of its narrative fictions and the amount of critical analysis devoted to those fictions, as well as theoretical considerations of the genre and its cultural meanings, have increased substantially, providing additional proof of the significance of magical realism in contemporary literature.

Magical Realism between Modern and Postmodern Fiction

Definitions e Irreducible Element

As a basis for investigating the nature and cultural work of magical realism, I suggest five primary characteristics of the mode. First, the text contains an “irreducible element” of magic; second, the descriptions in magical realism detail a strong presence of the phenomenal world; third, the reader may experience some unsettling doubts in the effort to reconcile two contradictory understandings of events; fourth, the narrative merges different realms; and, finally, magical realism disturbs received ideas about time, space, and identity. e “irreducible element” is something we cannot explain according to the laws of the universe as they have been formulated in Western empirically based discourse, that is, according to “logic, familiar knowledge, or received belief,” as David Young and Keith Hollaman describe it.1 erefore, the reader has difficulty marshaling evidence to settle questions about the status of events and characters in such fictions. We must take Gabriel García Márquez’s very old man with enormous wings, for example, “as a given, accepted but not explained.”2 e narrative voice reports extraordinary—magical—events, which would not normally be verifiable by sensory perception, in the same way in which other, ordinary events are recounted. e account often involves concretely detailed descriptions of phenomena that are not articulated in such detail or so completely integrated into everyday reality in other narrative traditions—mythical, religious, folkloric. is irreducible element goes beyond the uncanny, which, as Tzvetan Todorov explains, exists as an incidental element in various kinds of narrative.3 According to 

Amaryll Chanady, “while the implied author is educated according to our conventional norms of reason and logic, and can therefore recognize the supernatural as contrary to the laws of nature, he tries to accept the world view of a culture in order to describe it.4 He abolishes the antinomy between the natural and the supernatural on the level of textual representation, and the reader, who recognizes the two conflicting logical codes on the semantic level, suspends his judgment of what is rational and what is irrational in the fictitious world.”5 Brenda Cooper, writing of magical realism in West African fiction, similarly sees “the relationship between the magical and the scientific” as central to magical realism; “it is the narrative space where the educated writer’s simultaneous ironic distance from and acceptance of, prescientific worldviews negotiate the magical realist stance.”6 e narrator’s presentation of the irreducible element on the same narrative plane as other, commonplace, happenings means that in the terms of the text, magical things “really” do happen: young Victor and André in Carlos Fuentes’s Distant Relations “really” become a twinned fetus floating in a pool; Remedios the Beauty in García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude “really” ascends heavenward; Saleem Sinai in Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children “really” is made invisible by his future wife, Parvati; Grenouille in Patrick Süskind’s Perfume “really” distills a powerful and intoxicating human scent from the bodies of virgins. And so on. ese irreducible elements are well assimilated into the realistic textual environment, rarely causing any comment by narrators or characters, who model such an acceptance for their readers. Paradoxically, though, because they also nevertheless frequently surprise those readers and their realistic expectations, they also say, in almost existential fashion, “I EKsist,” “I stick out.” Here we might detect the remnants of existential anguish at an un-co-optable world, but tempered by the more playful side of surrealism (or the intersection of diverse cultural traditions). In So Far from God, for example, Ana Castillo specifically confirms the irreducible nature of a dead person’s reappearance by verifying her sighting by several people, as if to convince any skeptics in her audience: “Esperanza [who has died] was also occasionally seen. Yes, seen, not only by La Loca, but also by Domingo who saw her from the front window. . . . And once, although she had thought at first it was a dream, Esperanza came and lay down next to her mother.”7 In short, the magic in these texts refuses to be entirely assimilated into their realism; it does not brutally shock but neither does it melt away, so that it is like a grain of sand in the

oyster of that realism. And because it disrupts reading habits, that irreducible grain increases the participation of readers, contributing to the postmodern proliferation of writerly texts, texts co-created by their readers. Magical images or events, glowing alluringly from within the realistic matrix, often highlight central issues in a text. e song Sethe’s daughter miraculously begins to sing in Toni Morrison’s Beloved underlines a female line of descent and the ways it is transmitted: “Leaning forward a little, Beloved was humming softly. . . . / ‘I made that song up,’ said Sethe. ‘I made it up and sang it to my children. Nobody knows that song but me and my children.’ / Beloved turned to look at Sethe. ‘I know it,’ she said.”8 Similarly, the trail of blood that miraculously travels across town from son to mother in One Hundred Years of Solitude underlines the unusually close, even incestuously involuted nature of the Buendía family, whose ties are especially strong. Examples of those ties abound: Colonel Aureliano predicts from a distance his father’s death, announcing on his arrival home that he has come for “the obsequies of the king”; José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo share Petra Cotes for almost two months until they both contract “a low life disease,” but having “submitted to burning baths of permanganate and diuretic waters, . . . both were cured separately after three months of secret suffering” and years later die at the same instant.9 In Perfume, Grenouille’s magical talent that permits him to construct scents for himself that abolish his problematic status as a nonperson, to which his odorless body had consigned him, highlight the novel’s questioning of our notions about unique and naturally formed individuals and their socially determined relationships because they totally change his status. One “perfume in his arsenal was a scent for arousing sympathy that proved effective with middle-aged and elderly women. It smelled of watery milk and fresh, soft wood. e effect Grenouille created with it—even when he went out unshaved, scowling, and wrapped in a heavy coat—was of a poor, pale lad in a frayed jacket who simply had to be helped. Once they caught a whiff of him, the market women filled his pockets with nuts and dried pears because he seemed to them so hungry and helpless.”10 In e Stone Raft by José Saramago, the issue of marginality is underlined by directly motivating the magic in the text. e novel narrates events during the magical severance of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, which creates a larger and larger chasm between them. at rift dramatizes the sense of cultural isolation experienced by Spaniards and Portuguese in

relation to the rest of Western Europe. But it is also extended in a more general and cosmic sense to encompass divisions between people, and existential questions of connection. Near the end of the novel, the peninsula has stopped drifting, but the narrator tells us as he leaves us that the travelers whom we have followed “will travel on their way, who knows what future awaits them, how much time, what destiny.” Just before this ending, one of these travelers dies, and somehow the obvious extraordinariness of the stone island is abandoned for—and mysteriously seems to enhance—the quotidian strangeness of death, for both Pedro Orce and his companions. Before dying Pedro “stretched out” on the ground, “his white hair mingling with fresh shoots, flowering at a time when it should have been winter.” After he is dead and they are taking him to be buried, we hear that “such a thing has never happened to them before,” and the women both weep, thinking “dear God, how all things in this world are linked together, and here we are thinking that we have the power to separate or join them at will, how sadly mistaken we are, having been proved wrong time and time again, a line traced on the ground, a flock of starlings, a stone thrown into the sea, a blue woolen sock, but we are showing them to the blind, preaching to the deaf with hearts of stone.”11 e uncertain connection between this death and the “stone raft” whose progress we have been following throughout the novel is made explicit with the mention of a line traced on the ground, which recalls the boundary between the peninsula and Europe that did not behave according to expectations, and the stone thrown into the sea. Once again, a magical event highlights the extraordinary nature of reality. In the course of highlighting such issues, irreducible magic frequently disrupts the ordinary logic of cause and effect. Lisa’s pains in D. M. omas’s e White Hotel appear before she experiences the atrocities at Babi Yar that cause them and kill her. Melquíades’s manuscript turns out to be a prediction as well as a recording of events in One Hundred Years of Solitude, implicitly asking whether he, and we, are the masters or the victims of our fates. We wonder whether Grenouille’s perfuming skills are a cause or a result of his own perfumeless persona. In Ben Okri’s e Famished Road, the text presents Azaro’s visions in such a way that we question whether Azaro’s own visionary skills conjure the images he presents or whether they result from the effects on him of people or of phenomena he encounters. In one of many sequences in which he journeys into the forest, a mask “with eyes both daunting and mischievous” falls on him, so that when he puts it on, “the forest became

as night,” and he “sees a different world. ere were beings everywhere in the darkness and the spirits were each of them a sun.” But even before he encounters the mask, he twice recounts entering “another reality, a strange world,” in which he sees strange things, such as “nude women [who] appeared and vanished before my gaze,” and “my eyes became charged too and I saw people with serene bronze masks emerging from trees.” Shortly, however, “my wonder turned to bewilderment. When I took off the mask the darkness was the same. Patches of light came over the wind. I had begun to lose my sense of reality, confused by the mask.” Furthermore, at one point near the end of this sequence of events, when Azaro attempts to remove the mask, it “stuck to my face,” which “felt somewhat raw” when it was removed, suggesting the possibility that mask and face are one, questioning the source—and cause—of his visions. He sees different things, or things transformed into others when he wears the mask, but the speed of the transitions, the statement that it remained dark when he removes it, and the visionary nature of the images he sees without it confuses our sense of cause and effect, and we are led to ask whether the mask has caused the visions or forms part of them, caused by his own visionary powers as an abiku or spirit child.12 In the light of disruptions of cause and effect and irreducible elements of magic recounted with little or no comment, in conjunction with accounts of extraordinary but actual phenomena and events, the real as we know it may seem amazing or even ridiculous.13 As Erik Camayd-Freixas expresses it, summarizing the thesis of Irlemar Chiampi, magical realism contains the “coexistence of the natural and the supernatural in a narrative that presents them in a nondisjunctive way, in which the natural appears strange, and the supernatural pedestrian.”14 roughout One Hundred Years of Solitude, for example, as Robert Anderson points out, the rationally expected is often contradicted by the surprises of the actual. Sentences like “Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the more beautiful,” occur over and over again ().15 In Midnight’s Children, Rushdie implies the interchange of the ordinary and the extraordinary when he describes a hummingbird as “a creature which would be impossible if it did not exist.”16 And just before we are told of his magical journey in which he is invisible inside a basket as fact, Saleem describes the city of Dacca under Indian occupation, where he “saw many things which were not true, which were not possible, because our boys would not could not have behaved so badly; we saw men in spectacles with heads like eggs being shot in side-streets, we saw the intelligentsia of the city

being massacred by the hundred, but it was not true because it could not have been true, . . . we moved through the impossible hallucination of the night” (). (e magical is factual and the historical is impossible.) e bureaucratic red tape that Nikolai Gogol’s man in “e Nose” encounters in his attempts to report the loss of his nose seems more outrageous than the magical disappearance of the nose itself. e lies of the Pakistani government about the number of Indian aircraft shot down in the Indo-Pakistani War (in Midnight’s Children), and the discovery of ice, the properties of magnets and movies, or the government’s denial of the deaths in the banana company’s massacre of workers in Macondo (in One Hundred Years of Solitude), achieve an equality of strangeness with Saleem’s magical voices or Macondo’s flying carpets.17 Embodying the spirit of this marvelous everyday magic is the description in “Light Is Like Water,” by García Márquez, of “household objects, [which,] in the fullness of their poetry, flew with their own wings through the kitchen sky.”18 In a metafictional gloss on this kind of rhetoric that tends to blur distinctions between the marvelous and the ordinary, Saleem claims he has adopted “matter of fact descriptions of the outré and bizarre, and their reverse, namely heightened, stylized versions of the everyday” (). And in e Moor’s Last Sigh Rushdie’s protagonist explains the strategy to us. I had never been up in a plane before, and the experience of passing through clouds . . . was so spookily like the images of the After Life in movies, paintings and story-books that I got the shivers. Was I traveling to the country of the dead? I half expected to see a pair of pearly gates standing on the fluffy fields of cumulus outside my window. . . . “I feel as if I have slipped in time,” I told the friendly stewardess some while later. “But whether into the future or the past, I cannot say.” “Many passengers feel that way,” she reassured me. “I tell them, it is neither. e past and future are where we spend most of our lives. In fact, what you are going through in this small microcosmos of ours is the disorienting feeling of having slipped for a few hours into the present.” Her name was Eduviges.19

e Moor will, in some sense, enter the realm of the dead before his time, for the principal irreducible magic in the book is that his life is rushing toward his death at twice the normal human rate of aging. And immediately after this scene, the rest of the airplane’s crew deny the existence of Eduviges. So,

perhaps she really was a dream, or, as the Moor speculates, “a sort of phantom of the air, called forth by my own desires. No doubt such houris did float up here, above the clouds. ey could pass through the aircraft’s walls whenever they chose” (). As often before, then, the magic surrounding this now ordinary but amazing phenomenon of airplane travel renders it newly strange. Rushdie also shows us where he got the idea, conjuring a bit of intertextual magic by plumbing Hispanic literary history: this interchange takes place as the Moor is flying to Benengeli and speaking to Eduviges: the first is the name of the fictional author of Don Quixote, and the second of a character in Juan Rulfo’s Pedro Páramo. Perhaps, with the Moor, magical realism and its irreducible element enter the mainstream of metafictional satire: “the centrality of the magical image” and “the logic of dream” are terms bandied about by a stream of “dope-fiends and professors and journalists and celebrities and critics” who appear in a send-up of postcolonial theory in Rushdie’s novel (). In magical realism, reality’s outrageousness is often underscored because ordinary people react to magical events in recognizable and sometimes also in disturbing ways, a circumstance that normalizes the magical event but also defamiliarizes, underlines, or critiques extraordinary aspects of the real. Grenouille’s perfuming abilities and the uncannily entrancing scent he manufactures for himself are magical, but the mass hysteria that they engender, tearing him literally limb from limb and devouring him at the end of the novel, if exaggerated, is real, and all too familiar as an analogue for the power of charismatic leaders and the malleability of crowds, as well as for the persecution and scapegoating that has resulted from such adulation in recent history. Meanwhile the masses on the other side of the barricade were giving themselves over ever more shamelessly to the uncanny rush of emotion that Grenouille’s appearance had unleashed. ose who at the start had merely felt sympathy and compassion were now filled with naked, insatiable desire. . . . ey all regarded the man in the blue frock coat as the most handsome, attractive, and perfect creature they could imagine . . . as their ideal image of themselves. . . . e result was that the scheduled execution of one of the most abominable criminals of the age degenerated into the largest orgy the world had seen since the second century before Christ.

Magic thus also serves the cause of satire and political commentary. Similarly, in García Márquez’s story “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings,” Pelayo and Elisenda exploit the miraculous old man as factory owners do their workers. A passage from André Schwarz-Bart’s novel A Woman Named Solitude also exemplifies this highlighting of political atrocity by magic. At the start of the section where the narrator will describe the massacre of blacks by French forces in Guadeloupe, a magical event occurs: “Early one afternoon, on a day like other days, a peal of thunder shook the great trees, sending a rain of leaves down on the astonished fugitives. e animals whimpered and slunk away into the copse. Surprised in her sleep, a dead woman suddenly flew up to the sky, her breasts flapping like wings. . . . / is cannonade on the Côtesous-le-Vent was the beginning of the end of an episode in history which, though unknown to the fugitives, was to be their death.”20 e magic grows almost imperceptibly out of the real, and the narrator registers no surprise, with the result that the element of surprise is redirected onto the history we are about to witness, which constitutes the nasty shock. e Phenomenal World

A second characteristic of magical realism is that its descriptions detail a strong presence of the phenomenal world. is is the realism in magical realism, distinguishing it from much fantasy and allegory. It appears in several ways. Realistic descriptions create a fictional world that resembles the one we live in, often by extensive use of detail. On one hand, this attention to sensory detail continues and renews the realistic tradition. On the other hand, in addition to including magical events (such as Beloved’s appearances and Frances Phelan’s conversations with the dead) or phenomena (such as Melquíades’s manuscript, Saleem’s transmitting and receiving radio head, and Grenouille’s nose), magical realist fiction includes intriguing magical details. Because these magical details represent a clear departure from realism, detail is freed from a traditionally mimetic role to a greater extent than it has been before. is is still true even from the Barthesian perspective that questions the site-specific mimesis of realism. Roland Barthes claims that realism endows details with an “effet de réel” (reality effect), which conveys not any particular information but rather the idea that this story is real.21 In addition to projecting that message with detailed descriptions, the irreducible details of magical realism can lead in the opposite direction, signaling

that this may be imaginary. e sense of the magical growing within the real was articulated early on by Franz Roh in his initial discussion of magical realism in painting: “with the word ‘magical,’ as opposed to ‘mystical,’ I wish to indicate that the mystery does not descend to the represented world, but rather hides and palpitates behind it.”22 A graphic illustration of this commingling phenomenon is the way in which magical events are usually grounded textually in a traditionally realistic, even an explicitly factual, manner. Furthermore, as Brenda Cooper has stated it, “the mysterious, sensuous, unknown, and unknowable are not in the subtext, as in realist writing, but rather share the fictional space with history.”23 Within the fiction, Felipe Montero in Carlos Fuentes’s Aura reads in a newspaper of the magically potent job he will eventually take; similarly, Remedios the Beauty’s levitation in One Hundred Years of Solitude starts quite concretely, when Fernanda, as she is hanging out the laundry, feels a “delicate wind of light pull the sheets out of her hand and open them up wide” (). With respect to history, e White Hotel begins with fictional letters from the historical figures of Ferenczi and Freud; in Midnight’s Children, Rushdie carefully situates his narrative in the events surrounding India’s independence and the turmoil that followed it. Remnants of this quality, of magic’s solid grounding in reality, persist even when the fantastical element shows its colors quickly and clearly. In Perfume, for example, Grenouille, with his magically powerful and discriminating sense of smell, is born in carefully located space and time: in geographical space “in Paris under the sway of a particularly fiendish stench,” and in textual time immediately after the opening catalogue of stenches “barely conceivable to us modern men and women,” a formulation that locates both him and us historically (). Like the perfumers whose ranks he joins, Grenouille is a product of this smelly environment—perhaps even compensating for his mother’s “utterly dulled” sense of smell (). If we focus on reference rather than on description, we may witness idiosyncratic recreations of historical events, but events grounded firmly in historical realities, often alternate versions of officially sanctioned accounts.24 is grounding in history grows out of realism’s frequent “embedding of random persons and events in the general course of contemporary history,” as Erich Auerbach expressed it.25 García Márquez’s rewriting of the history of Latin America in that of Macondo, for example, including a massacre that has been elided from the public record, and the opening of Milan Kundera’s e Book of Laughter and Forgetting, which replaces a man airbrushed out of

history by party doctrine, are elements that differ from the mythical components of those tales, though they are related to them. e combination implies that historical events and myths are both essential aspects of our collective memory. As we hear in Midnight’s Children, “sometimes legends make reality, and become more useful than the facts” (). us these histories may include magic and folk wisdom, like events told from Ursula’s or Melquíades’s point of view in One Hundred Years of Solitude, for example. But history is the weight that tethers the balloon of magic, and as if to warn against too great a lightness of mythic or magical being, both Fuentes and Kundera include dangerous sets of floating angels in their novels, angels that represent the lightness of ahistorical irresponsibility. e twin fetus at the end of Fuentes’s Distant Relations, the remainder of old Heredia’s desire to create an angel, floats “with a placidity that repudiates all past, all history, all repentance,” a dangerously unanchored position.26 At the end of the first section on “the angels” in e Book of Laughter and Forgetting the narrator tells us that “from the day they excluded me from the circle, I have not stopped falling, I am still falling . . . away from my country and into the void of a world resounding with the terrifying laughter of the angels that covers my every word with its din,” a laughter that is virtually diabolic in its erasure of historical consciousness.27 Because it shows the clock being forcefully returned to the decay of actual time passing, the description of Oskar’s first scream in Günter Grass’s e Tin Drum seems to recognize both the danger of encapsulation in a timeless realm, and the delicate task of balancing between magic and history: at the sound of the scream, “the polished round crystal which protected the honey-colored dial of our clock from dust and moribund flies burst and fell to the floor.”28 Historical anchoring is well demonstrated in what John Foster calls “felt history,” whereby a character experiences historical forces bodily: Anna Karenina, for instance, is crushed by a train, which in this context represents European modernizing forces in Russia.29 is phenomenon is exaggerated and particularized in magical realist fictions. Clear examples are Lisa’s pains that anticipate her death at Babi Yar in e White Hotel, Grenouille’s magical nose born from the smells of Renaissance Europe in Perfume, and Saleem’s literal dismemberment as a result of his sympathetic identification with the forces dividing his country at the end of Midnight’s Children.

Unsettling Doubts

A third quality of magical realism is that before categorizing the irreducible element as irreducible, the reader may hesitate between two contradictory understandings of events, and hence experience some unsettling doubts. e question of belief is central here, this hesitation frequently stemming from the implicit clash of cultural systems within the narrative, which moves toward belief in extrasensory phenomena but narrates from the post-Enlightenment perspective and in the realistic mode that traditionally exclude them. And because belief systems differ, clearly, some readers in some cultures will hesitate less than others, depending on their beliefs and narrative traditions. Even so, much of magical realism is encompassed by Tzvetan Todorov’s formulation of the fantastic as existing during a story when a reader hesitates between the uncanny, where an event is explainable according to the laws of the natural universe as we know it, and the marvelous, which requires some alteration in those laws.30 In other words, magical realism expands fictional reality to include events we used to call magic in realism.31 is is a difficult matter, however, because many variations exist. Hesitation may obscure the irreducible element, which consequently is not always so easily perceived as such. e contemporary Western reader’s primary doubt is most often between understanding an event as a character’s dream or hallucination and, alternatively, understanding it as a miracle. e mysterious character of Beloved in Morrison’s novel of that name slithers provokingly between these two options, playing with our rationalist tendencies to recuperate, to reconcile antinomies or co-opt the marvelous. Women outside of Sethe’s house ask themselves, “Was it the dead daughter come back? Or a pretend? Was it whipping Sethe?” (). A little later “Paul D knows Beloved is truly gone. Disappeared, some say, exploded right before their eyes. Ella is not so sure. ‘Maybe,’ she says, ‘maybe not. Could be hiding in the trees waiting for another chance’ ” (). And at the end of the book, we hear, “ey forgot her like a bad dream.” We readers ask ourselves, “Was she no more than that?” “It took longer for those who had spoken to her, lived with her, fallen in love with her, to forget, until they realized they couldn’t remember or repeat a single thing she said, and began to believe that, other than what they themselves were thinking, she hadn’t said anything at all” (). Magical realist scenes may seem dreamlike, but they are not dreams, and the text may both tempt us to co-opt them by categorizing them as dreams

and forbid that co-option. Magical realist narratives almost seem to bring up the possibility of interpreting what they chronicle as a dream in order to forestall that interpretation, after having first aired it as a possibility. at strategy, while allaying the reader’s doubts, also calls them into being, causing the reader to hesitate. At the start of Kafka’s e Metamorphosis we are told that this was no dream, and the same words appear near the end of Perfume as Grenouille is undergoing his dismemberment. As Saleem says, at one point, of “the invasion of dreams—or a mother’s knowledge, or a woman’s intuition,” “there was no proof,” this is “not something that will stand up in court” (), and at another, regarding the ability of midnight’s children “to look into the hearts and minds of men,” “don’t make the mistake of dismissing what I’ve unveiled as mere delirium” (). When Saleem is telling how Parvati made him invisible so that he could return to India from Pakistan undetected, Padma interrupts and questions him, and they ponder the magic of his transformation: en Parvati whispered some other words, and, inside the basket of invisibility, I, Saleem Sinai, complete with my loose anonymous garment, vanished instantly into thin air. “Vanished? How vanished, what vanished?” Padma’s head jerks up; Padma’s eyes stare at me in bewilderment. I shrugging, merely reiterate: Vanished, just like that. Disappeared. Dematerialized. Like a djinn: poof, like so. . . . . . . I was in the basket, but also not in the basket. . . . I was tossed with the basket, but also not tossed. Afterwards, Picture Singh said, “No, captain, I couldn’t feel your weight.”()

So we are often literally instructed by the text to hesitate. But even if we are not, we may hesitate, both in doubt because we are unsure about the nature of the events and in wonder, in awe, at their remarkable properties.32 We do so as we wonder whether Oskar could actually have ceased to grow as a result of the fall he orchestrates for himself, and started again after being hit on the head with a rock, and as we behold the yellow butterflies that appear with Mauricio Babilonia every time he comes to visit Meme Buendía, and “who did not give him a moment’s peace” until his death: “e yellow butterflies would invade the house at dusk. Every night on her way back from her bath Meme would find a desperate Fernanda killing butterflies with an

insecticide bomb” (). e phenomenon of the butterflies seems to be a marvelous one but the fact that they die from an insect bomb subjects them to the rules of the physical universe, so we are puzzled about their status. Similarly, we wonder whether it is possible for a woman to live to be more than , as Pilar Ternera is reported to have done. e way she is described shortly before we hear of her death locates her both in actual time and in a magical mythical time: “Years before, when she had reached one hundred forty-five years of age, she had given up the pernicious custom of keeping track of her age and she went on living in the static and marginal time of memories, in a future perfectly revealed and established, beyond the futures disturbed by the insidious snares and suppositions of her cards” (). García Márquez continues to play this game with his readers by beginning Of Love and Other Demons with a newspaper story he claims to have covered in , which inspired the novel, and which he in turn links to his grandmother’s now legendary tales. He witnesses the unearthing of the tomb of a young girl whose twenty-two meters and eleven centimeters of brilliant coppery hair flow out of her coffin. e chief of excavations calmly explained to me that human hair grows one centimeter a month even after death, and twenty-two meters seemed to him a reasonable amount for two hundred years. To me, on the other hand, it didn’t seem so trivial, for as a child my grandmother had told me the legend of a little twelve year old marquise whose hair dragged her along like a bride’s train, who had died of rabies from a dog bite, and who was worshipped in Caribbean villages for the miracles she performed.33

We hesitate on three accounts, most important, because we wonder whether the events the novel narrates are possible and therefore could be true. at initial hesitation increases the intensity of the two other, more pragmatic, speculations about whether García Márquez actually witnessed the phenomenon, and whether the introduction is fact or fiction. With Aura, we hesitate at first and then begin to comprehend slowly, because the details of Felipe Montero’s transformation into General Llorente are given camouflaged and piecemeal, so that the awareness of the transformation dawns on the reader in the same way it does on Felipe, bit by bit. In many instances, however, the magic in magical realism is clear and

we barely hesitate, the narrator’s acceptance of the magic modeling our own, a strategy that I examine in more detail in Chapter  in a discussion of narrative techniques.34 For now, a few briefly noted instances: in One Hundred Years of Solitude the flying carpets, Remedios’s ascension to heaven, and José Arcadio’s blood traveling across Macondo to find Ursula are clearly magic, as is the transformation of the Automobile Club pool into a jungly swamp in Distant Relations, the arrival of the title character of García Márquez’s “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” in Pelayo and Elisenda’s courtyard, the “two tiny handprints [that] appeared in the cake” at the start of Beloved, or the revival of dead people at the end of e White Hotel, and they are presented matter-of-factly by the narrators. is manner of presentation is an essential defining characteristic for Chanady in her distinction between magical realism and the fantastic. In magical realism “authorial reticence . . . naturalizes the supernatural” so that it “does not disconcert the reader.” Because the fantastic encodes hesitation, Chanady argues, it presents antinomy, “the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes in the text,” as unresolved. In contrast, because the magical realist narrator accepts the antinomy and promotes the same acceptance in the reader, the antinomy is resolved.35 Although many magical realist narrators accept the disjunction between realism and magic, thereby tempting their readers to do likewise, many others do not and thus promote hesitation. Another reason this distinction, while generally valid, seems not entirely unproblematic is that even when the text does not entice us to hesitate, we readers’ investment in the codes of realism is still so strong, and if they are present in the text we are reading, even the narrator’s acceptance of antinomy does not overcome our hesitation completely; thus the hesitation tends often to remain rather than being totally resolved. Brenda Cooper’s idea that “it is precisely the mix of authorial reticence with authorial irony that is a defining feature of the magical realist text” takes account of this strange combination of acceptance and skepticism that characterizes the reader’s experience in magical realism.36 Another possible strategy for the reader is to interpret a particular instance of magic in an otherwise realistic fiction as nothing more than allegory. is kind of interpretation is tempting in Kundera’s e Book of Laughter and Forgetting, when we see people rise above the ground in a charmed circle of ideological bliss—for Kundera an example of the “unbearable lightness” that totalitarian ideologies will tend to engender. Even so, since the magic here is presented clearly as magic within an otherwise realistic narrative, it belongs

on the fringes of magical realism. For Camayd-Freixas, among the essential criteria of magical realism is the reader’s simultaneous adoption of a literal and an allegorical perspective.37 In other words, the weight of the nonallegorical thrust of realistic narrative conventions works against a reduction of the magic in magical realism to a primarily allegorical mode. Merging Realms

Fourth (in this list of characteristics), we experience the closeness or nearmerging of two realms, two worlds, another aspect of magical realism that I examine more closely in Chapter .38 e intermittent and uncertain nature of the narrator’s metamorphosis into a sow in Pig Tales means that (as Catherine Rodgers formulates it) “the tale opens a space of the in-between [“l’entre-deux”], a space of uncertainty. e narrator herself is captive between two worlds, the human and the animal, not belonging really to one or the other.” Marie Darrieussecq regards this situation as symptomatic of certain aspects of contemporary life, such as living in a suburb, which “is a rather undifferentiated in-between . . . a space of all possibilities, sometimes frightening, since one can forget where one comes from there and become lost.”39 For Brian McHale, describing what he terms the postmodern fantastic, “another world penetrates or encroaches upon our world (as in ‘House Taken Over’ [by Julio Cortázar]), or some representative of our world penetrates an outpost of the other world, the world next door (as in Aura). Either way, this precipitates a confrontation between real-world norms (the laws of nature) and other-worldly, supernatural norms.”40 In terms of cultural history, magical realism often merges ancient or traditional—sometimes indigenous—and modern worlds. Ontologically, within the texts, it integrates the magical and the material.41 Generically, it combines realism and the fantastic. We might say of it, in the words of H. P. Duerr in his Dreamtime, that in many of these texts “seeing takes place only if you smuggle yourself in between worlds, the world of ordinary people and that of the witches.”42 Perhaps the magical realist narrative line is analogous to the axis of the world that in many systems of thought is imagined to join the realms of the underworld, the earth, and the heavens. e magical realist vision thus exists at the intersection of two worlds, at an imaginary point inside a double-sided mirror that reflects in both directions. Ghosts and texts, or people and words that seem ghostly, inhabit these

two-sided mirrors, many times situated between the two worlds of life and death; they enlarge that space of intersection where a number of magically real fictions exist. André Breton imagines techniques that will fix the attention “not any longer on what is real, or on the imaginary, but . . . on the other side of reality.”43 Fluid boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead are traced only to be crossed in Pedro Páramo, Palace of the Peacock, One Hundred Years of Solitude, e House of the Spirits, Midnight’s Children, at Voice, Distant Relations, e White Hotel, Ironweed, and So Far from God. From a metafictional perspective, if fiction is exhausted in this world, then perhaps these texts create another contiguous one into which it spills over, so that it continues life beyond the grave, so to speak. From the first sentence, William Kennedy’s Ironweed weaves a web of connections between the land of the living and the land of the dead: the novel begins by telling us that “riding up the winding road of Saint Agnes Cemetery in the back of the rattling old truck, Francis Phelan became aware that the dead, even more than the living, settled down in neighborhoods.” As he approaches “the neighborhood of the Phelans,” “Francis’s mother twitched nervously in her grave as the truck carried him nearer to her.” Later on, Francis sees in his mind’s eye “his mother and father alight from their honeymoon carriage in front of the house and . . . climb . . . the front stairs to the bedroom they would share for all the years of their marriage, the room that now was also their shared grave, a spatial duality as reasonable to Francis as the concurrence of this moment both in the immediate present of his fifty-eighth year of life and in the year before he was born.”44 is sense of an interchange of worlds is expressed in Isabel Allende’s e House of the Spirits by Clara, who, during her lifetime, communicated with the spirits. As she is dying “she added that if she could easily communicate with those from the Hereafter, she was absolutely convinced that afterward she would be able to do the same with those of the Here-and-Now.” When her husband is old, she appears to him first “just as a mysterious glow, but as my grandfather slowly lost the rage that had tormented him throughout his life, she appeared as she had been at her best, laughing with all her teeth and stirring up the other spirits as she sailed through the house.”45 e unmediated way in which these different realities are presented means that magical realism also blurs the boundary between fact and fiction, another characteristic that locates magical realism within postmodernism.46 Follow-

ing his discussion of the postmodern fantastic, McHale explores the generalized effect of a fantastic “ ‘charge’ [that] seems to be diffused throughout postmodernist writing,” though he claims that the hesitation in traditional fantastic writing between this world and the next has been displaced by “the confrontation between different ontological levels in the structure of texts.”47 His formulation thus ultimately stresses the magic of fiction rather than the magic in it. Similarly, Marie Darrieussecq sees the way in which she writes, between realism and the fantastic, as a reflection of current discourse: “today there exists, even in ordinary life, a way of speaking of reality that always makes a detour through the fantastic, with a lot of realism, as if the fantastic were already an almost trite element of reality.”48 As we are seeing, with respect to the realm of the referent, reports of irreducible elements of magic question post-Enlightenment science’s empirical definition of the world. With respect to the realm of the discourse, those reports of magic question the code of realism, and the texts foreground the constructed nature of fiction. In both cases, magical realism blurs borders between categories. It also begins to erode the categories themselves because the link between empirically constructed perceptions of reality and realistically constructed fictional discourse means that to question one is to question the other.49 Disruptions of Time, Space, and Identity

Finally, in addition to merging different worlds, these fictions disturb received ideas about time, space, and identity. 50 With “four years, eleven months, and two days” of rain, an insomnia plague that erases the past and the meaning of words, and a room where it is “always March and always Monday,” our usual sense of time is shaken throughout One Hundred Years of Solitude. Our sense of space is disrupted when tropical plants grow over the automobile club’s pool in Paris at the end of Distant Relations, when Cortázar’s axolotl and his observer seem to change places on either side of the glass in the aquarium, and when Grenouille smells virgins across town. As Fredric Jameson sets out the project of realism, one thing it achieves is “the emergence of a new space and a new temporality” because realism’s spatial homogeneity abolishes the older forms of sacred space. Likewise the newly measuring clock and measurable routine replace “older forms of ritual, sa-

cred, or cyclical time.”51 Even as we read Jameson’s description, we sense the erosion of this program by magical realist texts—and by other modern and postmodern ones as well. Like their nineteenth-century Gothic predecessors, many magical realist fictions delineate near-sacred or ritual enclosures, but these sacred spaces are not watertight; they leak their magical narrative waters over the rest of the texts and the worlds they describe, just as that exterior reality permeates them. As Felipe enters Consuelo’s house (in Fuentes’s Aura), for example, it is presented as a realm apart from the noisy outside street: “Before going in you give a last look over your shoulder, frowning at the long line of stalled cars that growl, honk, and belch out the unhealthy fumes of their impatience. You try to retain some single image of that indifferent outside world.” at world contrasts with “the mold, the dampness of the plants, the rotting roots, the thick drowsy aroma,” an interior Gothic-like world that increasingly encloses Felipe. And yet Felipe’s clothes from his room in the city mysteriously appear at the house.52 Bluestone Road is the scene of Beloved’s mysterious haunting presence and the magical events that it engenders, and Sethe thinks that “Whatever is going on outside my door ain’t for me. e world is in this room.” But Sethe, Denver, and Paul D come and go at will, indicating that the house is not entirely a realm unto itself—although we also hear at one point that when Denver “left the house she neither saw the prints nor heard the voices that ringed  like a noose” (). At another point, Stamp Paid talks about Beloved at  to Ella, indicating Stamp’s familiarity with the territory, and its lack of total isolation, a phenomenon that helps Sethe in the end. “Somebody new in there. A woman. ought you might know who is she.” “Ain’t no new Negroes in this town I don’t know about,” she said. “What she look like? You sure that wasn’t Denver?” “I know Denver. is girl’s narrow.’ “You sure?” “I know what I see.” “Might see anything at all at .” “True.” ()

e same sense of magical and yet permeable interiors characterizes Saleem’s pickle factory, Branly’s house (in Distant Relations), and the actual houses in

e White Hotel and e House of the Spirits, as I explain in more detail in a discussion of magically real houses in Chapter . Magical realism reorients not only our habits of time and space but our sense of identity as well.53 e multivocal nature of the narrative and the cultural hybridity that characterize magical realism extends to its characters, which tend toward a radical multiplicity. With over five hundred children of midnight talking through his head, for example, is Saleem himself anymore? And we hear him question his identity in other ways as well. At one point, he reports, “ ‘I am glad,’ my Padma says, ‘I am happy you ran away.’ But I insist: not I. He. He, the buddha. Who, until the snake, would remain notSaleem” (). And he expands on this idea of multiple and mobile identity: “Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I’ve gone which would not have happened if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each ‘I,’ every one of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. [54] I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you’ll have to swallow a world” (–).55 He actualizes the potential in that statement about personal multiplicity with the midnight’s children inside his head, but in addition to them, he says that his mother’s “inside-voice is bouncing against the inside of my head,” his “favorite uncle’s sadness is pouring into me,” and he has “Mary Pereira’s dreams inside my head” (, ).56 Similarly, in e Famished Road, people may be taken over by other beings or phenomena. A mysterious sense of fluid identities and interconnectedness appears in this passage: e night filled the room and swept over us, filling our space with light spirits, the old forms of animals; extinct birds stood near Dad’s boots, a beautiful beast with proud eyes and whose hide quivered with gold-dust stood over the sleeping forms of Mum and Dad. A tree defined itself over the bed where I lay. It was an ancient tree, its trunk was blue, the spirit sap flowed in many brilliant colours up its branches, densities of light shone from its leaves. I lay horizontal in its trunk. e darkness moved; future forms, extinct tribes, walked through our landscape. ey traveled new roads. ey traveled for three hundred years and arrived in our night-space. I did not have to dream. It was the first time I realized that an invisible space had entered my mind and dissolved part of

the interior structure of my being. e wind of several lives blew into my eyes. e lives stretched far back and when I saw the great king of the spirit-world staring at me through the open doors of my eyes I knew that many things were calling me. It is probably because we have so many things in us that community is so important.57

e extinct birds and beautiful beasts hover over the sleeping and therefore more available forms of Mum and Dad, the wind of several lives blows over Azaro’s eyes, and the great king of the spirit-world stares at Azaro through his own eyes. And all the while he lies inside the trunk of the blue tree. us not only are the living spaces and minds of Azaro and his parents peopled by humanlike spirits and cosmic forms but they also inhabit them. e permeability is mutual and incessant. In a less multiple but similarly interchangeable manner, the merging and changing of identities is central to the magic in Cortázar’s story “Axolotl.” When, after having witnessed what seems to be the transformation of the narrator into an axolotl, we hear the narrator’s final ambiguous speculation about whether “he” on the other side of the glass who has presumably been an axolotl moments before “is going to write a story about us, that, believing he’s making up a story [but actually recounting what has happened to him and that he no longer consciously recalls], he’s going to write all this about axolotls,” we wonder about the identities of both narrator and axolotl. And this narrator (now an axolotl) further deconstructs the notion of separate selves by speculatively musing, “or I was also in him, or all of us were thinking humanlike.” And we are even further confused when we hear this sentence: “I am an axolotl for good now, and if I think like a man it’s only because every axolotl thinks like a man inside his rosy stone resemblance.”58 When he begins the sentence, he seems to refer to his transformation from human to axolotl, confirming the difference between then, but as the sentence progresses, he seems to deconstruct that transformation and to merge humans and axolotls. Similarly deconstructive of individuality, with their reversal of skin colors, Tristão and Isabel in John Updike’s novel Brazil achieve a partial, at least a social, exchange and merging of identities. Just before those changes of skin, Isabel says of herself and the shaman who seems responsible for the changes that “something in the smoke had eaten away at the boundary between their minds.”59 at example reminds us that often those multiple identities are

constructed. Grenouille’s creation of a scent for himself out of the distilled essences of the most diverse substances exemplifies that idea. And as we see in more detail shortly, we ask ourselves who is the voice in at Voice, and who or what are the relations in Distant Relations. According to Linda Hutcheon, “in e White Hotel, the realist novel’s concept of the subject, both in history and in fiction, is openly contested.”60 at challenge is particularly effective because it operates from within; the magic questions individual identity from a realistically rendered historical fiction and a realistically detailed character.61 Locations

Geographical stylistics are problematic, but one might speculate about the existence of a tropical lush and a northerly spare variety of the magical realist plant.62 In the northerly variety, there is less magic and its range is more circumscribed: the ingenious and rather programmatic magic of smell in Perfume, and the very small intrusions of magical event in e Book of Laughter and Forgetting, for example, contrast with the more pervasive magic in García Márquez and Rushdie; the occasional magic of Beloved is somewhere in between the two. Jean Weisgerber makes a similar distinction between two types of magical realism: the “scholarly” type, which “loses itself in art and conjecture to illuminate or construct a speculative universe,” and which is mainly the province of European writers, and the mythic or folkloric type, found mainly in Latin America.63 ese two strains of scholarly and mythic roughly coincide with the two types of magical realism that Roberto González Echevarría proposes: the epistemological, in which marvels stem from an observer’s vision, and the ontological, in which America is considered to be itself marvelous (Alejo Carpentier’s “lo real maravilloso”[the marvelous real]).64 e trouble is, it is often difficult to distinguish between these two strains. Two of Cortázar’s stories, otherwise quite similar, illustrate the difficulty. “Axolotl,” on one hand, is set in Paris, in the aquarium section of the Jardin des Plantes zoo, but the axolotl itself is an American organism, with an Aztec name, so that categories begin to crumble—just as I was about to put this story nearer the European, epistemological branch of the genre. Following my initial impulse, however, we can note that it is the narrator’s identity with the amphibian rather than its continent of origin that begins the magic. In “e Night

Face Up,” on the other hand, perhaps the extraordinarily strong presence of the Aztec past in modern Mexico motivates the magical transportation of the narrator back into that past, or conversely, the brutal irruption of that Aztec past into the modernizing program of the European Renaissance is responsible for the movement forward into the modern present. Like the atmosphere of belief in Haiti in Carpentier’s e Kingdom of is World, this strong Aztec element is a particularly American phenomenon. us these categories of European versus American have a certain validity. Whether one chooses Carpentier’s ontological “marvelous real” or the epistemological view that the magic inheres in the words and the vision rather than in the world, magical realism flowers in culturally hybrid ground. As Chanady has noted, a major force contributing to the development of magical realism in Latin America was the perception of that continent as exotic and the consequent desire to describe this unfamiliar reality to Europe.65 Similarly, whatever cultural agendas more recent magical realist texts such as Midnight’s Children and e Famished Road serve in the former colonies where their authors were born, the texts also present those postcolonial cultures to an international reading public. But as I show in a later discussion, such a postcolonial agenda does not appear in all magical realist fictions, because they also exist outside postcolonial environments. ese questions of location suggest that much of magical realism may resemble Caliban, now something of an icon of new world, or postcolonial, writing, who learns the master’s language, then uses it to curse. Magical realism has mastered the European discourse of realism and now uses it not to curse, exactly, but to undermine some of its master’s assumptions. Just as Caliban’s swear words are not the combinations of sounds Prospero intended for him to use, so magical realism’s use of realistic detail to describe an impossible event, which moves us beyond everyday reality, rather than anchoring us in it, was not realism’s original program. Allied to the modernist “ruin of representation,” which occurred largely in the realm of formal structure and syntax, this current challenge operates more radically in the register of phenomena, of semantics, and might almost be called a partial ruin of the represented.66 It challenges the assumptions of realistic representation but is enraptured with its practices. Realism, for example, does not believe in miracles, but it has given the magical realist the means to describe them. us even when a magical realist text overturns the assumptions of Western empiricism and questions the binary opposition of magic and realism from

the perspective of another cultural or narrative tradition that lacks those assumptions and that opposition, they persist, because they are embedded within the conventions of realism the text employs.67 In addressing the question of location, then, we continue to see how, in addition to combining the genres of realism and the fantastic, magical realism is also often culturally hybrid. Because magical and realistic narrative modes frequently come from different cultural traditions, their amalgamation makes magical realism a liminal mode, in the sense of Victor Turner’s “liminal entities,” which “are neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremonial.”68 In other words, much of magical realism is multicultural in its structure and its history avant la lettre and has therefore contributed substantially to the development of contemporary multicultural fiction and criticism. us magical realism partially reverses the process of cultural colonization. Magical realism’s multicultural perspective often originates in the peripheral and colonized regions of the West: Latin America and the Caribbean, India, Eastern Europe, Africa. But the mode is becoming less and less marginal, even though it retains the charm of the marginal position. In , John Barth rejected membership in any imaginary writer’s club that did not include García Márquez, praising One Hundred Years of Solitude as a prime example of replenished postmodern fiction. Barth’s statement represents an important shift in literary relations and signals an increased worldwide recognition of magical realism—according to John Updike, writing in , “a now widely available elixir.”69 Both a cause and an effect of magical realism’s international success, its decentering of contemporary literary discourse, is the fact that its mastertexts are widely dispersed. e novel that put the term magical realism on the international literary map, One Hundred Years of Solitude, comes from the small Latin American country of Colombia. What seems to be increasingly regarded as a second definitive example, Midnight’s Children, is from India. Both of these are aggressively postcolonial texts. A third, Grass’s e Tin Drum, is from Germany and locates the final (albeit chronologically first) apex of this far-flung triangle in Europe, so that it is not only a postcolonial style.70 Furthermore, the presence of magical realist films such as e Witches of Eastwick, Field of Dreams, Ironweed, Wolf, inner, Like Water for Chocolate and its spin-offs Woman on Top and Chocolat, among others, in the cinematic mainstream, further attest to its increasing dispersion throughout all contemporary culture.

In terms of literary history, magical realism in the West develops from a combination of realism and surrealism, often with an infusion of pre-Enlightenment or indigenous culture. Rushdie claims, for example, that his writing comes from a combination of Gogol and Dickens—“on the edge between the surreal and the real”—and the Arabian Nights—“flying horses and invisible cloaks.”71 Located within postmodernism, it nevertheless has strong roots in modernism, situating it at the intersection of those two modes.72 In articulating the position of magical realism as growing out of modernism into postmodernism, it is useful to consider Brian McHale’s idea that modernism is epistemological, concerned with questions of knowledge, while postmodernism is ontological, concerned with questions of being.73 (In the one we ask how we know something and in the other we ask what it is.) McHale locates a point in William Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom! where this line is crossed. It is the moment when Quentin and Shreve leave off their attempts to remember and reconstruct and begin self-consciously to invent. at moment of invention, the realization of an imaginary realm, can help to distinguish magical realism from realism. In the former, it happens not provisionally in the voices of narrators but concretely in the reality depicted.74 Especially with regard to the questioning of time, space, and identity, it is possible to see how magical realism has its roots in modernism and its branches and leaves in postmodernism, as it were. If we contrast magical realist presentations of space and time with modernist paradigms, we can see that in modernism, readers are brought into surreptitious contact, through, as Virginia Woolf expressed it, a kind of mental tunneling process within the discourse, with mythical, historical, or, most frequently, personal pasts—a depth of perception characteristic of modernism, whereas in magical realism, those temporal realms are brought to life in the referential realm of the text. e Greece of e Odyssey, for example, is endlessly evoked in Ulysses, and Clarissa’s past at Bourton resonates in present-day London in her mind in Mrs. Dalloway, but they are not magically conjured into concrete existence as are time and space in “e Night Face Up” in which the protagonist shuttles between the temporal spaces of a realistically described Aztec ritual and a similarly actualized modern hospital, or in e White Hotel, in which Lisa’s future death from a bayonet is magically present in the premonitory pains in her womb and breast.75 Similarly, in Pedro Páramo, the voices of the past live again in the present, and Juan Preciado seems to pass between those times as they are spatially embodied in the town of Comala. First, we hear from him

what seems to be his passing between the spaces of life and death or present and past-in-the-present through the medium of air. ere wasn’t any air. I had to swallow the same air I breathed out, holding it back with my hands so it wouldn’t escape. I could feel it coming and going, and each time it was less and less, until it got so thin it slipped through my fingers forever. Forever. I remember seeing something like a cloud of foam, and washing myself in the foam, and losing myself in the cloud. at was the last thing I saw.

en, a bit later, those temporal spaces are again concretely inhabited as Dorotea tells Juan that “ey buried me in your grave, and I fit very well into the hollow of your arms. Only it occurs to me that I ought to be embracing you, not he other way around. Listen. It’s raining up there. Can’t you feel the raindrops falling?” / [And Juan answers] “It feels as if somebody were walking over us.”76 Following McHale’s distinction between the modernist epistemological and the postmodernist ontological, then, readers experience the engagement of the spectators in the sky-writing in Mrs. Dalloway as an epistemological question of viewing, whereas in addition to the epistemological orientation that is achieved by the presence of different voices in Pedro Páramo, through the way those voices are embodied in beings with concretely described attributes, readers also confront ontological questions of being. In the first example our attention is focused on how—through whose eyes—we perceive the writing, whereas in the second we wonder what kind of beings we are seeing. It is not so much a question of how but of what. As Saleem said, “who what am I?” e same is true, however briefly, in the case of the two circles of dancers that rise into the air in e Book of Laughter and Forgetting, which the reader experiences both in an epistemological way, as a figment of the narrator’s imaginative distance from the communist ideology to which the dancers subscribe, and in an ontological sense as a different spatial mode of being in the world. With regard to questions of identity as well, these fictions greatly resemble modernist ones, their closest precursors. It is not so much the existence of these multiple times, places, or identities in magical realism as it is the way in which they are portrayed that distinguishes magical realism from modern-

ism. To continue with our two salient examples, Leopold Bloom in Ulysses as a bricolage of (among other things) l’homme moyen sensual, the Wandering Jew, the flaneur, an Irish Christ, and a unique and realistically described Dubliner is very similar to the Buendías as biblical dynasty, Latin American colony, twentieth-century oligarchy, or Melquíades as magician, scribe, Saint John writing the apocalypse, and friend to José Arcadio Buendía; but García Márquez’s inclusion of the birth of the prophesied child with the pig’s tale as the realization of a family curse, the repetition not only of names but of character traits and activities, such as the repetition of incestuous urges between aunts and nephews, especially in the male members of the family, the blood trail that joins mother and son, among other events, questions the boundaries of the individual self in more radical form than Joyce does. In Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf questions the separateness of our identities through Clarissa’s sympathetic identification with Septimus, especially in the moment when she imagines to the point of vicariously performing his death. And Woolf ’s own excursion into the fantasy of changing identity in Orlando has been seen as a precursor to magical realism.77 But in Laura Esquivel’s Like Water for Chocolate, the way in which the identity of Tita as Pedro’s beloved and true, cosmically correct wife is conflated with that of his official wife, Rosaura, through the phenomenon of Tita’s milk being magically generated to feed Rosaura and Pedro’s baby as if it were hers and Pedro’s, or the way that Consuelo and Aura, like Felipe and the General, alternately separate and combine in Fuentes’ Aura extends that questioning of boundaries even further and in more concrete detail. e modernist tendency toward revealing psychic depth of personality implies the existence of multiple selves within one individual and mysterious connections between different people, but these principles are not actualized to the same extent that they are in much of magical realism, which, like postmodernism generally, often radically extends modernism’s tendency toward multiplicity and collectivity in its portrayal of fictional character. If in modernism character generates story out of psychic depth, and in postmodernism story generates character out of events and histories and intertextual bricolage, then once again, magical realism mediates between those modes.78 In short, the epistemological concerns, along with the mythic elements, the primitivism, the psychological interiors and depths, align magical realism with much of modernism; the ontological questions raised by the presence of magical events, and the confrontations between different worlds and

discourses, together with the collective spirit and political pointedness of the writing, align it with postmodernism.79 In magical realism, the mythic patterns glimpsed behind modernism’s realistic texts emerge as magical elements on its surface. Aschenbach in omas Mann’s Death in Venice mentally activates the antique Dionysian while Rushdie’s Saleem with his large nose comes near to actually re-embodying in human form the elephant-nosed authorial persona of Ganesh, and, like Sinbad from the ousand and One Nights, is literally transported in a basket. e magical, irreducible elements in magical realism inherit modernism’s search beyond the rational into the unconscious, but they bring more than an individual’s hidden scenarios to the postmodern surface of the text. In other terms, the autonomy of discourse that magical realism implicitly proposes through the irreducible element means that it mediates the modernist organization of the world’s chaos through art and the postmodern occlusion of the world by the text. In the end, though, in the way that its texts slither dizzyingly between modern and postmodern sensibilities, magical realism exemplifies the way in which those very categories destabilize themselves the longer we look at them.80 As we have been observing, contemporary magical realism has developed as a narrative mode that produces fictions in diverse cultural traditions, its continuing popularity ensuring those productions a growing international audience. As part of that literary history, Latin American magical realist writing grew out of the first wave of postcolonial romantic primitivism, which affirmed the sense of a usable, natural, and indigenous past but had not yet articulated a distinctive style in which to portray that sensibility. It thus developed as a response to the conjunction of indigenist and avant garde modes, and through a combination of Latin American and European inspiration. It responded to the questioning of the novel of the land by writers influenced by European and U.S. modernism and surrealism, and their consequent production of a more psychological realism in the s and s, together with a revalidation of the land and culture of Latin America.81 Even though Franz Roh had coined the term magical realism and his essay had been translated into Spanish and published by the influential Revista de Occidente in , according to Erik Camayd-Freixas, the essential link in the dissemination of the idea of magical realism was Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who was a close friend of Massimo Bontempelli’s and also knew Carpentier and Miguel Angel Asturias in Paris. e origin of the term magical realism and the history of the dissemina-

tion of the concept aside, the surrealism that was current in Europe during the s and that challenged the tradition of realism, encouraging excursions into the surreal, beyond conscious reason into realms of dream, myth, the unconscious, and “primitive” culture, led Carpentier and Asturias to exploit and affirm what America had to offer in those areas.82 Hence Asturias’s inclusion of magical images drawn from Mayan mythology in his fiction and Carpentier’s idea of “the marvelous real” as a distinctly American phenomenon where church sculptures depicted the intercultural phenomenon of angels playing the maracas, where outrageous otherworldly plants grew in profusion and that therefore was in no need of the kind of artificial juxtaposition, such as sewing machines and umbrellas on dissecting tables, to which European surrealists had recourse in their desperate search for the extraordinary. In contrast to the surprising images constructed by surrealism out of ordinary objects, which aim to appear virtually unmotivated and which programmatically resist interpretation, magical realist images, while projecting a similar initial aura of surprising craziness, tend to reveal psychological, social, emotional, and political motivations after some scrutiny. (Recall the trail of Aureliano José’s blood, which suggests the incestuous passions of the Buendías and the close ties between mothers and sons, and the levitation of Madame Raphael and a few of her pupils, which suggests the heartless power of a party line.) But that initial craziness points to the carnivalesque side of magical realism, the way in which its realistic fictional language is partially freed from its habitual mimetic constraints. But only partially. According to Carpentier the problem with European surrealists is that “many of them disguise themselves cheaply as magicians, forgetting that the marvelous begins to be unmistakably marvelous when it arises from an unexpected alteration of reality (the miracle), from a privileged revelation of reality, an unaccustomed insight that is singularly favored by the unexpected richness of reality or an amplification of the scale and categories of reality, perceived with particular intensity by virtue of an exaltation of the spirit that leads it to a kind of extreme state [estado límite].”83 Essential here for the development of magical realism in general is the idea of the marvelous growing within the richness of reality. In addition, the repudiation of the metropolitan paradigm, while at the same time speaking with that paradigm in mind, is of specific importance for its efficacy as a postcolonial style. e affirmation of the local, together with its attachment to the cosmopolitan, with which magical realism began, continues to characterize it.

Following this initial impetus, Latin American magical realism as it developed in the s and s in the fiction of Rulfo, García Márquez, Fuentes, and Cortázar, among others, then combined the cosmopolitanism of Jorge Luis Borges’s universally oriented speculative philosophical fictions with the more specifically American perspective of Asturias and Carpentier, who discovered in myth the possibilities of reconciling the universal and the autochthonous and experienced a renewed validation of Latin American nature and culture. As I suggest above, that revalidation—ironically enough—received a seminal impetus from European modernist surrealism and primitivism, from the ideas of Pierre Mabille, for example, who located an important source for the marvelous in folklore, as well as those of the primitivist anthropologists Lucien Lévi-Bruhl and G. W. Frazer, and in Latin America, especially, the Marxist theoretician and activist José Mariátegui, who advocated an Indian utopia, and culminating with the ideology of the mestizo as a legitimate rather than merely a degenerate source of Latin American identity in the work of Arturo Uslar-Pietri and others. ose early theories also reflected the widespread attempt (by such writers as José Enrique Rodó and José Vasconcelos) to reconstruct a positive idea of America, overturning Eurocentric stereotypes of native “barbarism.” Out of that context, the “ ‘abnormality’ and ‘distortion,’ formerly condemned as deviations from a given model, were now considered excellent aesthetic effects.”84 us magical realism was culturally hybrid from the start and has been instrumental in temporarily alleviating the universalist/nativist controversy central to the development of a modern Latin American literary identity, a controversy that has resurfaced recently with respect to magical realism itself. It combines the telluric force of novels of the land that undergirded movements of national independence in the nineteenth century with modernist innovations such as stream-of-consciousness narration, nonlinear temporal sequencing, surrealist imagery, and a primitivist ethnographic consciousness. García Márquez, for example, has said that reading a sentence of Woolf ’s Mrs. Dalloway completely changed his sense of time and may have given him the idea for Macondo’s process of decomposition and also that he thinks the Caribbean taught him “to see reality differently, to accept supernatural elements as part of our everyday life.”85 Camayd-Freixas locates the central Latin American texts by Carpentier, Asturias, Rulfo, and García Márquez that he studies within the discourse of primitivism and maintains that the reader familiarizes extraordinary events by categorizing them as the manifesta-

tions of a primitive mentality alien to his or her own. But as magical realism moves out of that primitivist phase, as it is currently doing, such a distancing mechanism lessens in importance, and the otherness moves closer to the selfsame. In any case, its frequent alliance to literary identity politics, an alliance strengthened by its narrative encoding of alterity, has made magical realism a powerful decolonizing mode. at it continues to serve such a function and that this function is tied to the magical realist portrayal of worlds of the spirit is suggested by a recent article describing fiction by a new generation of post-apartheid black South African writers, many of whom claim that their writing is more nuanced in a society whose primary concern is no longer the relatively clear-cut injustice of the racist regime but the complex intraracial tensions that have succeeded them. us, according to the reporter Rachel Swarns, many young black writers are “abandoning a rigidly realist style to incorporate a sense of the spiritualism that pervades rural villages. Lightning is hurled to kill an enemy. Birds carry messages of good and evil. And the dead fuss over the living as they watch from the other side.”86 If we take these developments into account, it is clear that magical realism in Latin America and elsewhere belongs largely in the second wave, in Kwame Anthony Appiah’s terms, of “postrealist writing, postnativist politics, a transnational rather than a national solidarity—and pessimism: a kind of post optimism . . . a post that challenges earlier legitimating narratives,” a wave that is continued but changed in nature by the general shift toward the documentary realism that has followed magical realism in Latin America in the texts of Carpentier (Rite of Spring), García Márquez (e General in His Labyrinth), Cortázar (Manual for Manuel ), and Fuentes (in Terra Nostra and e Campaign).87 In Midnight’s Children this sense of postcolonial pessimism, of the betrayals of supposed liberation, coexists with the celebration of ancient patterns (Saleem’s nose as a reincarnation of Ganesh’s, Dr. Narliker’s huge emblems of birth control transformed into fetishes connected with ancient fertility worship). It resembles Yambo Ouologuem’s Bound to Violence as interpreted by Appiah to represent “a challenge to the novels of the first stage”; Ouologuem’s novel identifies “the realist novel as part of the tactic of nationalist legitimation and so it [like magical realism] is . . . postrealist.”88 us, like magical realism in Latin America, and in partial response to it, African magical realism developed out of a first wave of postcolonial indigenist novels inspired by traditional myth and oral narrative, such as e Palm Wine Drinkard and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts by Amos Tutuola or e Forest of

a ousand Daemons by D. O. Fagunwa, and the nationalistically oriented fictions of Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka, but also indirectly fed on earlier surrealist impulses imbibed by negritude poets such as Léopold Sédar Senghor.89 Similarly, Margaret Cezair-ompson, though she does not deal with magical realism as such, studies the development of Okri’s fiction out of earlier nonmagical postcolonial fiction. She proposes that through Azaro, who wants “to find and create new roads from this one which is so hungry, this road of our refusal to be,” Okri “proceeds beyond the road of incessant hunger, beyond the postcolonial’s actual and discursive ‘refusal to be,’ and beyond the crises of history” that overwhelmed earlier postcolonial fiction, but without ignoring them.90 In the fifties, sixties, and seventies, then, when magical realism as a liminal mode was growing in Latin America, and beginning to spread abroad, it may have been a source of strength in the definition of a continental literary identity, contributing to a sense of community with its consequent mutual support of Latin American writers during the boom. is sense of community now spans the globe, whether or not it is affirmed by its practitioners, and is exemplified in P. Gabrielle Foreman’s claim that Allende uses magical realism consciously as a literary technique to draw her readers into the text of e House of the Spirits before presenting her political message near the end of the novel, a strategy that builds on but contrasts with what Foreman claims is García Márquez’s earlier and less explicitly political use of magic and with Toni Morrison’s simultaneous use of magic and history.91 But the moment of defining a continental identity passes, and the sense of solidarity, together with the revolutionary impact of the style is less prominent when the mode is more solidly established.92 A similar process, and a confirmation of the idea that magical realism has frequently played a significant role in emergent or replenished literatures, can be discerned in the way in which e Tin Drum is often considered to be a blueprint for the formation of German literary identity after the Second World War, and Midnight’s Children an enabling model for the second generation of postindependence Indian novelists.93 Following this developmental pattern, we might imagine a magically real decolonizing pen as having been passed from Grass, García Márquez, and Fuentes, among others, to Rushdie and other magical realists, including Okri.94 For Fuentes, the magical realism he seemed to implicitly champion over twenty years ago in his essay on the new Latin American novel with his references to the death of bourgeois realism and to novels that invent “a sec-

ond reality,”95 and to which I would argue that Aura, “Chac Mool,” Distant Relations, and Christopher Unborn belong, now seems to feel to him like a critically imposed straitjacket. Gabriel García Márquez’s e General in his Labyrinth managed to close, with a historical scar, the wounds emanating from the so-called “magical realism,” which, invented by Alejo Carpentier, had been applied indiscriminately as a label to too many Hispanic American novelists, although truly it became the personal stamp
