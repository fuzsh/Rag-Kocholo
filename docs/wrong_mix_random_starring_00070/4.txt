This book is an introduction to the unique Hispanic community of Antonito in Conejos County, Colorado, just six miles north of the New Mexico border and 110 miles north of Santa Fe. Most people in Antonito reported having Spanish, Mexican, and Indian ancestors, sprinkled with various “Anglo” influences. Their community’s roots lie in the mixed ranching and farming subsistence economy of the early Hispanic settlers in the Upper Rio Grande region who came north from New Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century and pushed out the Utes and Navajos. They laid claim to the land by living on it, cultivating it, grazing their animals on it, and building acequias to irrigate it. This long-standing Hispanic community and culture is presented through the words of several Antonito women. I gathered their words in food-centered life history interviews between 1996 and 2006. I use food as a lens through which to see Mexicanas’ relation to land, labor, family, and community—to see their world through their eyes. Because this book is based on diverse people’s stories about their lives, it presents multiple views based on remembered worlds. People always censor and embellish their memories, and others in Antonito would see the same things quite differently. Three frames organize women’s food-centered life histories. The first is the examination of their sense of belonging in place and history that is a hallmark of what Latino scholars have called cultural citizenship. The second frame is Chicano environmentalism, which seeks to promote just and sustainable communities and to document Mexicano food production and land and water use. The third frame is a melding of Latina feminism and feminist ethnography, which prioritizes the perspectives and experiences of women, especially those like the rural Mexicanas in this book who have been previously excluded from the pages of history.

By including their voices, I hope not only to describe Antonito culture but also to promote its survival. To that end, and in the belief that education is the path to empowerment, all royalties are going to the Antonito Scholarship Fund at Adams State College.

Deepest thanks to all the people of Antonito—to everyone who gave a hello or a welcoming smile, change at the cash register, mail or DVDs, gas or haircuts, baseball coaching or refereeing, delicious meals, good talk, friendship, and insight. Very special thanks to the women who participated in this study, spent countless hours in conversation with me, and allowed me to tape record their stories. Several people in Antonito read this manuscript in one of its previous incarnations: thanks to them for support and advice. I also wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for the University of Texas Press. My friends and colleagues Meredith Abarca and Melissa Salazar put aside their own work to read a draft at a critical moment and have been inspirational scholars. Thanks to Tammy Lopez and Adams State College, Kathi Figgen and Leonard Velasquez for their insights on the San Luis Valley and their friendship, and Mary Romero for suggesting the San Luis Valley. Millersville University generously afforded me a sabbatical leave, and the Faculty Grants Committee has offered consistent support. The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education gave me a released time grant, and the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded me a 2005–2006 fellowship for the writing of this book thanks to the support of Stanley Brandes and Pat Zavella. Charles Geiger of the Millersville University Geo-Graphics Lab made the maps. Theresa May and the University of Texas Press were patient while I rewrote and rewrote and rewrote. Last, I give deep thanks to Jim Taggart for comradeship and steadfastness on the wild ride.

“I Did Do Something”

Food-Centered Life Histories in Antonito, Colorado

This book is based on food-centered life histories that I collected between 1996 and 2006 with Mexicanas in the small town of Antonito in the southern San Luis Valley of Colorado. Ninety percent of the population of Antonito identified themselves as Hispanic in the 2000 U.S. Census. They had deep roots in the Upper Rio Grande region and could point to Spanish, Mexican, Native American, and European ancestry. They were not “Mexican” or “Anglo” but part of a Hispanic cultural group spanning the geographic region from Santa Fe north to Antonito since the sixteenth century. I interviewed nineteen women about their foodways— their beliefs and behaviors surrounding food production, distribution, preparation, and consumption. This book makes extensive use of excerpts from those interviews to give voice to the women of Antonito. Three lines of inquiry frame this book. The first brings together Latina feminism and feminist ethnography by focusing on the diverse insider perspectives of Mexicanas and by sharing the stage with them. The second comes from Flores and Benmayor’s (1998) concept of cultural citizenship and asks whether Antonito Mexicanas’ have cultural as well as political citizenship, that is, not just political rights but also a sense

Counihan_2PP.indd 3

8/20/09 10:15:19 AM

of community, place, and “cultural belonging” (Silvestrini 1997, 44). The third line of inquiry comes from Chicano environmentalism (Peña 1998a) and documents the way in which Antonito Mexicanas knew land and water and used them to sustain families and communities for more than one hundred fifty years.

Why Antonito Ethnographic fieldwork consists of learning about a culture by living in a community and conducting long-term participant observation and in-depth interviews. My husband, the anthropologist James Taggart, and I share the conviction that fieldwork is the lifeblood of anthropology and that it is fascinating and compelling work. Since Jim’s previous fieldwork had been in Spain and Mexico and mine had been in Italy, we did not have a common fieldwork language. We had been looking for a fieldwork site where we could both work and raise our young sons, Ben and Willie. A fortuitous visit by the sociologist Mary Romero to Millersville University in 1990 launched our interest in the San Luis Valley. Jim contacted Kathi Figgen, who was then the state folklorist for southern Colorado. She suggested we consider Antonito, whose Hispanic community was of long standing and where older people still spoke Spanish as well as English, though younger people spoke only English. We did more research and found that Stanford University folklorist, Juan B. Rael, a native of nearby Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico, had done an extensive study in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico in the 1930s and 1940s and amassed a rich collection of stories, plays, songs, and religious traditions.1 We found, however, little recent ethnographic research on Colorado Mexicanos. In summer 1995 Jim and I and our sons spent three weeks in the Antonito area, visiting several towns and getting a sense of the place. By the end of our stay, we decided to do our research in Antonito because it had been an important cultural and commercial crossroads and the people were friendly. After trying to find a place to rent, we ended up buying a house in the middle of town and going there every summer and Christmas for ten years, conducting interviews and getting to know the town. That ethnographic research is possible never ceases to amaze me: it involves crossing the boundaries of distance between strangers and opening up to each other in quite intimate ways.2 Ethnographers usually travel from our homeplace to someone else’s, often where we know no one. We have to meet people, explain why we are there, and enlist

assistance. People usually do agree to help, and they spend hours talking to us, responding to our improbable questions and speaking about their own concerns, often on tape. People in Antonito were no exception. The town was small and welcoming, and little by little we made friends and found participants for our research. We met people at the post office, in the grocery store, at the restaurants, on the street, and in the neighborhood. We enrolled our sons when they were ages nine and six in Antonito Youth Baseball, and both played through age thirteen. We came to know many people at practices and games and learned a lot about Antonito and its rivalry with nearby La Jara, Manassa, and Sanford as we cheered the Antonito teams. I connected with the women of Antonito across many differences and some similarities. Like me, many were wives and mothers. But there were many differences between us. I have a Ph.D. and am a tenured professor with excellent pay and benefits, available to few in Antonito. I can come and go as I wish, enjoying Antonito’s beauty and vibrancy in summer and skipping its cold, windy, long, and sometimes bleak winter. I can escape or ignore the gossip and conflicts that are as common in Antonito as in small towns everywhere, whereas the women who live there have to endure the slights. I struggle to get beneath the surface, whereas they have multilayered, nuanced understandings of their community. Several of them are bilingual in Spanish and English, whereas I have command of written and spoken English but only a superficial knowledge of Spanish. I am “Anglo”; they are “Hispanic.”

Relations between Anglos and Hispanics in the Southwest have had a long history of conflict steeped in racist discourse about land, water, power, and rights.3 Antonito was not immune to this history, as Joe Taylor so eloquently describes in Alex and the Hobo (Taylor and Taggart 2003). Because many Mexicanos from Antonito have encountered racial slurs and discrimination from Anglos, it was reasonable to assume that they would have some diffidence toward us when we arrived as strangers in Antonito. To combat that diffidence, I fell back on the principles of anthropology: a respect for individual and cultural diversity, a commitment to honesty and confidentiality, and an acknowledgment that ethnocentrism is real and must be constantly guarded against.4 Anthropology is based on the premise that human beings can communicate and approach understandings across differences—of class, culture, nation, geography, language, and customs. We connect by finding shared identities. And although I am Anglo and have a privileged urban, white, upper-middle-class background, in my ancestry are roots that connect me with the people of Antonito. On my father’s side, my ancestors were Irish all the way back, and the history of Irish oppression was part of my upbringing in mid-twentieth-century Boston. Although I experienced little discrimination myself, I was raised in an environment where ethnic and racial prejudice were condemned and social justice was valued. My mother’s ancestry gave me connections to the people of Antonito in a different way, for she was born in northern New Mexico, in the town of Las Vegas, and her mother grew up a few miles outside Las Vegas, on a ranch in Rociada, in an area of Ponderosa pine forests and grazing lands. I was given my grandmother Marie Dunn’s name as my middle name, and my mother always told me I was just like her. Her mother, Marie Anna Pendaries, was born in France in 1852 and came to the United States when she was four years old, crossing from Kansas to New Mexico with a wagon train. My maternal grandmother’s father, Richard Dunn, was born in Maine in 1846 of Scottish immigrant parents, and he traveled to New Mexico via wagon train as a teenager. My great-grandparents met in Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he worked at the Plaza Hotel, which her father, Jean Pendaries, helped build. My grandmother Marie grew up in the Southwest and moved east after she married Wallace Watson, my grandfather. I never got a chance to talk to my grandmother about her childhood in northern New Mexico, because she died when I was nine years old, but I inherited from her a connection to the Southwest. Although I had never lived more than three hours from the ocean in

my entire life, I loved the Rocky Mountains of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico the moment I saw them. Although I am not of the place myself, I can share the appreciation of my research subjects for their beloved homeland.

Methodology: Food-Centered Life Histories and Testimonios Tape-recorded semistructured interviews constitute the main substance of this book. I also took more than five hundred pages of fieldnotes over the course of eight summers. I wrote about conversations I had, places I visited, and events I participated in, such as birthdays, baseball games, and community meetings. I also collected recipes and took many photos. Over thirty years of research I have found that food provides a powerful voice and sparks meaningful memories for many people. Moreover, Hispanic culture in the San Luis Valley revolved around subsistence food production until after World War II, when the local ranching and farming economy began to decline (Deutsch 1987). My goal in this book is to weave diverse women’s voices together to create a cultural mosaic revealing who they are and how they relate to food, place, and people. The experiences and voices of women—particularly those belonging to economically and politically marginalized ethnic groups—have too long been absent from the historical record. Recuperating them enriches our understanding of American culture and is a central goal in feminist ethnography and oral history.5 My food-centered life history methodology emulates the testimonio genre, a form of writing that emerged out of Latin American liberation movements.6 Testimonios are ordinary people’s narratives about events they have witnessed that center on a compelling “story that needs to be told—involving a problem of repression, poverty, subalternity, exploitation, or simply survival” (Beverly 1993, 73; original emphasis). Like ethnography, testimonios are based on collaboration between the narrator-witness and the compiler-ethnographer. Testimonios seek “to rewrite and to retell . . . history and reality from the people’s perspective,” as diverse and complex as that may be (Gugelberger and Kearney 1991, 11). While many testimonios are based on one individual’s experience, some, like this book, consist of a “polyphonic testimonio” composed of several different voices from one community (Beverly 1993, 74). I wanted to provide a forum for Antonito women to articulate their views of the world and to keep alive the stories, history, and culture of Mexicanas of the remote and relatively unknown southern San Luis Valley of Colo-

rado.7 The diverse female perspectives on Antonito culture and foodways complement the male views described by Taylor and Taggart (2003) in their collaborative study of Antonito.8 Before doing interviews, I established informed consent, telling people in Antonito who I was and what I was doing there, promising confidentiality, and giving them the choice to participate or not. Interviews were loosely structured and took place either in my kitchen or in the women’s homes, according to their preference. I usually set up the interviews ahead of time and told potential participants that I wanted to ask questions about food in their lives. I asked for their permission to tape-record, explaining that I wanted to have their verbatim comments about their culture, but I also told them that they could turn the tape recorder off at any time and decline to answer any questions, which people did on occasion. While I tried eventually to address all the topics on my list (see Appendix 1), interviews were conversations with their own momentum and wandered into many nonfood topics. My questions focused on diet, meals, celebrations, rituals, gardening, farming, food preservation, infant and child feeding, meanings of water and land, and food exchanges. Food triggered many interesting memories and stories, which led in turn not only to the women’s descriptions of places, activities, and events but also to their perceptions and feelings. I conducted a total of fifty-five interviews with nineteen women (and six interviews with men) and amassed approximately eighty hours of tape recordings. Several student assistants and I transcribed the tapes into approximately two thousand pages of text.9 I gave respondents bound copies of their verbatim interview transcriptions so that they could request corrections or deletions and keep them for posterity. In moving from transcriptions to book, I compiled a keyword table of contents of the interviews and then sorted segments of the interviews into nineteen main categories (see Appendix 2). Then I wrote several drafts with the aim of creating a medley of individuals’ voices that communicated the complexity of their food and culture. Inspired by testimonios and out of a desire to balance my voice with those of my research partners, I have written an introduction to each chapter and then presented relevant excerpts from participants’ interviews, adding brief connecting commentary. To mark our different voices, my words and the words of my subjects are distinguished typographically. I have not followed some ethnographers’ practice of quoting transcriptions verbatim, but at the urging of participants I have edited the transcriptions to achieve readability while staying as close to

their original language as possible. I eliminated repetition and most filler expressions (e.g., “like,” “and,” “you know”), edited lightly, and organized excerpts to achieve greater coherence. In the process of doing the research and writing this book, I grappled with issues of balance as I tried to forge my own voice and simultaneously to keep participants’ voices as prominent and authentic as possible, to lead interviews toward food topics but also to listen to whatever the women wanted to talk about.10 Antonito Mexicanas’ accounts contribute to a long literature by and about Hispanic women who have used food as an important part of their storytelling. Cabeza de Baca Gilbert ([1942] 1970, [1949] 1982, [1954] 1994) wrote about the recipes, cooking, and culture of Hispanic Las Vegas, New Mexico. Jaramillo ([1939] 1981, [1955] 2000) used long descriptions of foodways in her memoir of growing up in northern New Mexico, and she too produced a cookbook. Many of the Mexican American women interviewed by Elsasser and colleagues (1980) in northern New Mexico and Martin (1992, 2004) in southern Arizona described foodways and dishes similar to those of Antonito. Abarca (2006) made “culinary chats” the center of her study of Mexican and Mexican American working-class women, and Pérez (2004) used “kitchen-table ethnography” to compare the lives of Mexicanas in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. My book contributes to these studies by presenting the food stories of Hispanic women on the northern extremes of the Upper Rio Grande region.

History of Antonito The small Mexicano town of Antonito was on the northern frontier of Greater Mexico and “the colonial empire of New Spain” (Stoller 1982, xx). “Greater Mexico,” according to Américo Paredes (1976, xiv), refers to “all the areas inhabited by people of a Mexican culture” in the United States and Mexico.11 It refers in particular to that region in the southwestern United States that was part of Mexico until the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded this region—almost half of Mexico’s territory—to the United States. Antonito was settled by descendants of both the earliest Europeans on the continent and the indigenous peoples of North America. It had roots in a very old Hispanic culture, yet was also an important site of Anglo settlement and capitalist and mercantile expansion; it was a meeting place of Anglo and Hispanic worlds. These varied roots were manifest in the complex issues surrounding identity discussed in Chapter 2.

In 1821, when Mexico gained independence from Spain, the Ute Indians were the main inhabitants of this region, along with the Apache and Navajo. In 1832, in an effort to populate the area, the Mexican government gave the Conejos Land Grant to four families. Indians chased out the early settlers, but in 1852 a group of Mexicanos came to stay.12 Swadesh writes: The first settlers of the San Luis Valley were a group of Conejos grantees led by “Tata” Atanacio Trujillo of El Rito [New Mexico], a beaver trapper, sheepman, and trader to the Utes, who for some years past had been coming to the Valley. The settlers brought with them an image of San Rafael and within a few years built a chapel dedicated to this saint. The first communities were Rincones, San Rafael, Mesitas, and Mogote. (1974, 77)

In 1854 another group of settlers, under the leadership of Jose Maria Jaquez (or Jaques), built the plaza of Guadalupe east of San Rafael on the Conejos River. They were soon joined by the Ute Indian agent Lafayette Head, also known as Rafael Cabeza, who in 1876 was elected lieutenant governor of Colorado (Swadesh 1973, 141). Hispanic settlement of what became Conejos County proceeded rapidly after the 1850s, and by 1872 church records show that Conejos Parish had about three thousand members, most from northern New Mexico’s Rio Arriba County and some from Taos and other counties.13 Anglos arrived in growing numbers in the late nineteenth century. The first Mormon pioneers came to the area in 1878 and established churches, farms, and towns—Sanford, La Jara, and Manassa.14 The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built a line through the Antonito area between Alamosa, Colorado, and Española and Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1881. Landowners in the county seat of Conejos refused to sell land for the depot, so the railroad established its station and a new town in Antonito and built the Palace Hotel there in 1902 for its workers and travelers (Weigle 1975, 1). Antonito is part of the Upper Rio Grande region, what Martínez (1998, 70) calls the siete condados del norte: “the seven contiguous rural counties in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado that have Chicana/o demographic majorities.”15 Antonito has a much higher percentage of Hispanics than Conejos County as a whole (90 percent and 60 percent, respectively) and thus is a repository of Hispanic culture, yet it has always been a meeting place of diverse people on the Anglo-Hispanic frontier (Deutsch 1987). Antonito was the site of the transformation of the

economy from subsistence to commercial ventures and land speculation, which benefited Anglo outsiders more than local Mexicanos. Antonito grew steadily between 1881 and 1950 due to its commercial importance— sawmills, perlite mines, sheep and cattle ranching, and agriculture—with its population peaking in 1950 at 1,255 (see Appendix 1).16 But at the end of the twentieth century lumber was logged out, sheepherding and ranching were barely surviving droughts and low meat prices, perlite mining was faltering, the railroad had diminished in importance, and the population had declined to 872.

Antonito Today Today the town of Antonito is a small, dusty, urban center consisting of eight blocks running from east to west and twelve blocks running south to north along U.S. Highway 285 in southern Colorado. Most of the streets were dirt until 2004, when the town won state grants and raised funds through a bond issue to pave them. The modest homes are organized on a grid pattern. A few are adobe, some are concrete, and others are trailers and single- or double-wide manufactured homes. They are surrounded by small yards with some combination of flowers, grass, shrubs, trees (Chinese elm, aspen, spruce, willow, apricot, crab apple, cat’s claw), weeds, swings, rocks, or piles of potentially serviceable used goods.

At the west end of town, a publicly funded mental health clinic stands next to the Guadalupe Health Center. There is a pharmacy, a locally owned supermarket, three restaurants, a seasonal hamburger stand, two gas stations, a video store, a barbershop, a hair salon, and several gift and used-goods stores. A small high school and an elementary school serve a student population of about 450 from Antonito and the surrounding agricultural hamlets of Conejos, Guadalupe, Mogote, Las Mesitas, San Rafael, San Antonio, Ortiz, and Lobatos. The population is stable at 872, after dropping 30 percent between 1950 and 1990. Poverty is widespread in Antonito and Conejos County; the county has the second-lowest per capita income in Colorado and one of the lowest in the nation (Aguilar 2002). Furthermore, as Pulido (1998, 125) put it, “Poverty is highly racialized in the region,” striking Mexicanos at high rates. Lucky are those who work for public entities such as the schools, the town, the county, the hospitals, and the health services, for they draw regular salaries and benefits, even though these are low compared to elsewhere in Colorado. In 2000 perlite miners were earning $16 to $18 an hour and were among the best-paid workers, living in the nicest houses and driving the newest trucks, but the mines suffered periodic slowdowns and layoffs and were effectively shut down by 2008.17 Many people commute thirty miles north to the larger town of Alamosa (pop. 9,000),18 to work for minimum wage or little more in the service economy, relying on private vehicles due to lack of public transportation. But, as Teddy Madrid noted in 2005, “with the hike in gas prices, this will entail an extra hardship.” Other people get by with odd jobs, baby-sitting, trading in used goods, and public assistance. In the summer a small tourist economy exists due to hunting, fishing, and vacationing in the nearby San Juan Mountains and the popular Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad, which runs between Antonito and Chama, New Mexico, over the spectacularly beautiful San Juans. The railroad, however, has been constantly beset by problems, including management difficulties and fire hazards due to drought, which in 2002 halted the trains until July 30, causing the loss of two months of the season. After a couple of management changes, the railroad predicted a thriving season for 2008, with daily trips from May 24 to October 19.19

Study Participants Over eight summers I interviewed nineteen women, some once and others several times. In 2000 the study participants ranged in age from thirtytwo to ninety-four.20 Most held several occupations across their lives, 12

including farmer, rancher, racehorse owner, teacher, cook, cafeteria worker, secretary, bookkeeper, liquor store owner, mayor, heavy equipment operator, social services worker, sales clerk, bus driver, child care worker, postmistress, waitress, mother, housewife, and community volunteer. Some were my neighbors, others I met through friends, and many I came to know through Antonito Youth Baseball. I met some of the women for the first time at the interviews; others I had already known for years. All consented willingly to the interviews and to being tape-recorded. Of the nineteen women I interviewed, four figure prominently in this book and another four speak as supporting characters, with occasional comments from some of the remaining eleven. Two women, Helen Ruybal and Teddy Madrid, play a major role throughout the book. They were a generation apart, and both were teachers for many years; in fact, Helen had been Teddy’s first-grade teacher in the tiny Las Mesitas school. Both were born into families of small rancher-farmers, and both of their fathers earned money at various jobs, with Helen’s running a small store and Teddy’s emigrating periodically for wage work. Neither family was rich, but both valued education. One of Helen’s three siblings also went to college and became a teacher, and Teddy and all her siblings achieved master’s degrees. Both Helen and Teddy married and had two children. Their incomes from teaching enabled them to purchase land, further their children’s education, and have relatively egalitarian marriages. Because of their education and long professional careers, Helen and Teddy were somewhat extraordinary, yet still fit within cultural norms. Helen’s and Teddy’s voices are prominent in this book not only because our paths crossed often but also because of their interest in contributing to the project. Although she was ninety years old when we became neighbors, Helen Ruybal still took a daily walk around the St. Augustine Church and back to her home. I ran into her often, we chatted, and eventually I asked her if she would like to do an interview. Over the years I called her regularly and invited her to my house for coffee and cake or a meal. Although she did not like to cook, she loved to eat and was an enthusiastic visitor. One time Helen came over after she got locked out of her house, and our son Ben ran to her house, climbed in through an open window, and unlocked the door for her. When we built a new fence to replace one that was falling down, we added a gate out to the street across from Helen’s house, which pleased her immensely. She had a sharp memory and a keen wit, and she loved to make jokes at her own expense. Helen was born Elena Gallegos, the second of four children, in 1906 in the hamlet of Lobatos, five miles east of Antonito, into a family of 14

small farmer-ranchers who ran a store out of their home. After completing elementary school, she went to Loretto Academy boarding school in Santa Fe, where she started calling herself Helen, and later to Adams State College. At twenty-six she married Carlos Ruybal, a rancher, who died in 1982. Together, little by little, they amassed about a thousand acres and a sizable cattle operation while Helen taught school. Their daughter, Carla, who was born in 1933 and died in 1981, and their son, Ben, who was born in 1934, both became teachers. I interviewed Teddy Madrid seven times between 2003 and 2006 after meeting her through Antonito Youth Baseball. Her grandsons, John and Food-Centered Life Histories in Antonito, Colorado

Anthony, were the same ages as my sons, played on the same team, and were among their best friends in town. Born Teodora Sofia Ruybal in 1934, the second of nine children, Teddy graduated from the Las Mesitas school and attended Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado, for two years, then transferred to Adams State College in Alamosa from which she graduated cum laude in 1960. She married Vincent Madrid, who ran a service station in Antonito for many years. Teddy had a forty-year career in education as both a teacher and an administrator. In 1969 she attained a master’s degree in special education from Adams State College. She had two children and four grandchildren. Her son was a high school history teacher in Alamosa, and her daughter was a K-12 music teacher in Colorado Springs. Teddy was an energetic woman with sharp insight, a thoughtful mind, and a rich memory. She grew up in the small ranching community of Las Mesitas and remembered her family producing much of their own food. Almost as central as Teddy and Helen in the first half of the book is Ramona Valdez. Born in 1919, she had just turned eighty when I met her, and we did seven interviews between 1999 and 2001. She lived just a block away from me in Antonito. Because of poor health, she was largely housebound and enjoyed visitors. A couple of times a week I gave her a call, and if she was free, she always welcomed me to come over and talk. Usually she sat in her recliner in the living room and periodically adjusted it to lessen the constant pain she endured from a lifelong congenital hip disorder. She was a delightful conversationalist with a lively mind. Ramona had an excellent memory of her childhood days on the family ranch on the north bank of the Conejos River, just east of the hamlet of Guadalupe. She had two siblings—an older sister, Elena, who became a teacher, married, and moved to New Mexico; and an older brother, Cres, who took over the family ranch after their father retired and ran it with his wife, Lucy, and their five children. After Cres died, Ramona remained close to her sister-in-law, nieces, and nephews, who lived far and wide but visited her often. After our seventh interview, Ramona told me she was repeating herself and not to do any more tape recordings but to keep coming over to talk, and to take notes if I wanted. On one occasion I was talking to her about a song people used to sing in Antonito, and she was telling me the verses, which I was painstakingly writing down in my mediocre Spanish. In an exasperated voice, she said, “Why don’t you have your tape recorder?”

“But you told me not to bring it any more!” I replied—and then we both burst out laughing. Ramona had numerous health problems but maintained her sense of humor and good spirits right up until she died, on November 3, 2003. I did five taped interviews and had many conversations and meals with Janice Garcia DeHerrera who was raised in Albuquerque and Dallas/Fort Worth and whose mother was from Ortiz, a few miles southwest of Antonito. Janice had visited Antonito regularly over the years for family reunions, weddings, funerals, and Fourth of July celebrations. At

age twenty-six, Janice had a degree from the University of New Mexico (UNM) and was working in the UNM library when she reconnected at a family reunion in Antonito with a distant cousin, Ted DeHerrera, a telephone lineman she had known off and on for years. After a whirlwind courtship of two months, Janice quit her job, married Ted, and moved to Antonito. She became stepmother to Ted’s three adolescents, and she and Ted had four children together. When I first interviewed her, Janice had been living in Antonito for twenty years and was forty-five years old. She had recently returned to working full-time as a reading specialist at the Guadalupe Elementary School. She was still in the thick of raising her family and recounted vivid descriptions of her pregnancies, infant feeding, meals, cooking, the division of labor in the home, and the changes that ensued as she returned to the workforce. She was thoughtful and articulate, with a playful sense of humor that often led to an infectious chuckle. Monica Taylor, Asuncionita Mondragon, Martha Mondragon, and Cordi Taylor Ornelas are supporting players in this book. Cordi was the eldest sister of José Inez (Joe) Taylor, my husband’s coauthor, and she lived a block from me and across the street from Ramona Valdez. Cordi was born in 1925, the oldest of seven children, in the hamlet of El Rito, Colorado, fifty miles east across the valley from Antonito near the town of San Luis. She had vivid memories of growing up on the family ranch, taking care of the garden, and moving to Antonito at the age of seventeen, after she finished high school. She went to work at the J.C. Penney’s store and helped support her siblings until she married Ernest Ornelas in 1950. Ernest and Cordi had three children. Their son lived in Minnesota, and their daughters lived in Alamosa; each had two sons. After her children grew up, Cordi worked as a church administrator for many years. She had a gentle demeanor, a sweet face, and a soft-spoken voice with a husky laugh. When her health started to fail, she refused all life support measures and died peacefully in her daughter’s home in Alamosa in fall 2004. Monica Taylor was Cordi’s niece and Joe Taylor’s daughter. She was born in 1960. Soon thereafter her mother, Bertha Marquez Taylor, died of kidney disease, and Monica was raised by her maternal grandmother, Amada Marquez. Monica spoke of the family land in Mogote and Lobatos and of the food production and preservation they carried out there. She expressed a strong spiritual connection to and respect for the land. Monica held many jobs, including police officer and waitress. For the

past several years she had worked as a nurse’s aide in a local hospital. She quit to become a long-distance truck driver with her husband, Kevin, but then decided that life on the road was not for her and went back into health care and then police work. She was articulate, funny, and generous in word and deed. I met seventy-year-old Asuncionita Mondragon at a birthday party for her grandson Anthony and interviewed her twice at my home. She grew up in the ranching hamlet of La Isla, northeast of Antonito near the convergence of the San Antonio and Conejos Rivers. She married her neighbor Fred Mondragon in 1948 and moved with him to the edge of Antonito, where they built a house and operated a small trailer park. Fred had a large ranch, which he worked part-time while working full-time in the perlite mine. Asuncionita raised five children, ran the household, raised chickens, sold eggs, and later worked at the local credit union. She was a cheerful, no-nonsense person who spoke her mind with a smile and opened her home to her children and grandchildren. I interviewed Asuncionita’s youngest child, Martha, twice, and we talked on many more occasions at baseball games, family parties, and her home. Martha was born in Antonito and lived there much of her life, graduating from Antonito high school in 1987. She received a B.A. degree from Adams State College in 1995. In 1989 she married a man from Durango, Mexico, whom she had met at college. They lived for several years in California and had two children. After the marriage fell apart, Martha returned to Antonito with her children to live in a double-wide manufactured home near her parents, unmarried older sister, and married brother. When I interviewed her she was thirty-two and in a relationship that later ended with Joe Taylor Jr., an elected county official. She and Joe had twin girls in 2000, increasing the size of Martha’s family to four children. Martha held several social service jobs but had recently quit her latest job with the county because of poor health. She was a warm and cheerful person who was always smiling, even when she was exhausted by the demands of raising toddler twins and teenagers and coping with stressful health problems. These eight women form the major core of the book. Four others speak briefly: sixty-five-year-old former mayor Carmen Lopez (a pseudonym), eighty-year-old Celina Romero, fifty-two-year-old Bernadette Vigil (a pseudonym), and thirty-four-year-old Yolanda Salazar (a pseudonym). The interviews with the remaining seven women are not quoted here, but they nonetheless contributed to giving my study a broader base.

The Ethnographic Process I want to end this introductory chapter by citing a conversation I had with Helen Ruybal in 2000, when she was ninety-four years old. Helen was one of the first people I met and the one I interviewed most frequently. She was an enthusiastic participant in the research process, saying once, “The past is interesting if you sit down and listen to people, and you tell something and I tell something and she tells something. It tickled me how here my life has already passed, and when we talk about it, one little thing brings out another one.” Helen’s love of telling stories was manifest in her energetic participation in seventeen interviews between 1996 and 2001. In the following interview excerpt, Helen and I were talking about what I was trying to do with the food-centered life histories I was gathering with her and other women in Antonito. HELEN RUYBAL AND CAROLE COUNIHAN ON ETHNOGRAPHY

Carole: Helen, you know all these interviews we’ve been doing and you know how I type them, type up your words and put them in that book of transcriptions I gave you? If I want to write a book using your words, is that okay with you? Helen: Yes, it will be fine. Carole: Do you want me to use your real name? Helen: Yes, anyway they don’t know me. If I ever did read it, I’d think it’s fun. Carole: Good, I hope so. Well it’s going to take a while for me to— Helen: Chop those things up. Carole: Right. Helen: Those things that are no good; it’s fine when you can throw things away and dig them out—and there’re some things that you cannot throw away and be comfortable. Carole: The good thing about typing them on the computer is that you can take pieces from one interview and put them with pieces in another and then leave out things that don’t fit. Helen: That don’t fit in. I understand that because I know. Carole: I would have to take the interviews and the stories that you’ve told about your life and try to cut and paste and weave them together into a story. Helen: And go through a weaving and then make a story. Carole: Like you used to weave your mats and your rugs, that’s what.

Helen: It looks like nothing, a pile of yarn, and a pile of strings, and little by little it’s coming to show that it’s going to be something and finally find out, oh, I did do something. Carole: It’s like mining for gold. You might get a pan full of pebbles, and then there’d be some gold nuggets, and that’s the way the interview is. Helen: Yeah. Carole: Sometimes we wander off and talk about gossip or whatever and sometimes you have gold-nugget stories. Helen: [Laughs] Golden nuggets.

Conclusion I have taken the golden nuggets from the interviews and strung them together like beads on a chain of linking commentary to show that the women of Antonito, as Helen put it, “did do something.” Through the medium of food, they experienced a complex world with diverse locations across religion, gender, class, and ethnicity. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on women’s stories of identity, place, land, and water to introduce where they live, who they are, and how they define themselves. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 examine women’s stories of the traditional diet, food work, and cooking to show how they established identity and provided for their families by producing, preserving, and preparing food. Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 explore stories about meals, community food sharing, commensal rituals of death, and the community response to hunger to show the important role of giving and receiving food in establishing social relations. Overall, this book seeks to contribute to Latina feminism and feminist ethnography by describing in their own words the place of women in the enduring Mexicano culture of the southern San Luis Valley and by broadening understanding of the complex Latino experience in the United States, an important task given that Latinos will constitute one-fourth of the population by 2050.21 It aims to contribute to Chicano environmentalism by documenting the evolving food culture of one of the driest and coldest regions inhabited by Mexicanos. Finally, by describing women’s food production, preservation, preparation, and consumption, this book aims to foster the Mexicano community’s cultural as well as political citizenship in the United States.

“The Stereotypes Have to Be Broken”

Identity and Ethnicity in Antonito

One of the most striking things I learned from the Hispanic women of Antonito is the diversity of their views. In 2000 Antonito had fewer than 900 inhabitants, and almost 800 of them claimed Hispanic identity on the U.S. Census. Yet in this small and predominantly monoethnic community, women’s stories revealed a notable variety of self-definitions. Different women used different terms to define their ethnic identities, and some changed their preferred terms over the course of their lives in response to changing social forces and political consciousness. They held strong opinions about terms they liked and did not like. They privileged different parts of their heritage—which in many cases encompassed Spanish, Indian, Anglo, and Mexican roots. Even two members of the same family might use different terms and emphasize different aspects of their ancestry; for example, Bernadette Vigil (a pseudonym) called herself “Mexicana,” whereas her sister declared herself “Spanish.” This conflict over ethnic terminology was not unique to my study. Others have noted similar ambiguity in other Mexican American communities (Elsasser, MacKenzie, and Tixier y Vigil 1980; Madrid 1998; Zavella

Counihan_2PP.indd 22

8/20/09 10:15:20 AM

1991). The lack of consistent terminology pointed to the central dilemma of identification and identity that this chapter explores.

Antonito: An Insider/Outsider Perspective Let me now turn to a description of Antonito by Janice DeHerrera, who grew up in Albuquerque but whose mother was from the Antonito area. Janice had visited off and on all her life until she married and moved to Antonito when she was twenty-six. After nearly twenty years of living there, she had a well-articulated view of the town deriving from her insider/outsider status. JANICE DEHERRERA ON ANTONITO

The first thing I want to describe is Antonito being a small community with a lot of humble people. I would say especially the older people are very humble, unmaterialistic, to the point where they actually hide their riches so that nobody will be jealous of them. Even though there’s a lot of educated people here, for some you wouldn’t even know it. You’d think they were just lowly little housewives who had no education, and then you find out that they’ve got master’s degrees, because they don’t want to stand out, so they make themselves the same. They don’t want to stand out as being arrogant. Everybody goes to bed at the same time, and everybody gets up at the same time, and there’s hardly anybody going against the grain. We all eat the same things at the same time, and we all go to the store and buy the same specials. Sameness is important, sameness is so important. People will hide their riches so that other people won’t bring attention to them, so they don’t stand out as being different. Everybody has the same kind of house. There’s not too many people out there wanting a giant mansion, like 60,000 square feet or 6,000 square feet, they just want something to put their television and their comfy chairs in. The town of Antonito has a lot of little modest homes, with a lot of people living in them. There’s not always a house with a room for each child, or even two children. Sometimes you have a boys’ room and a girls’ room. They all want to wear T-shirts, and they all want to wear jeans. I guess one thing they might show off is their automobiles. This is not a place that changes. Nothing will change, it doesn’t happen overnight. And if there was a change, everybody would be there watching it [laughs]. This place does not change. It’s a constant place, a

Identity and Ethnicity in Antonito

Counihan_2PP.indd 23

23

8/20/09 10:15:21 AM

quiet place, a humble place, and one that doesn’t open its doors to outsiders very well. The reason for that is they’ve been burned in the past. This is a predominantly Spanish community. If you don’t show off, and you act kind of like other people, then they are more willing to accept you. Richness is not an important thing around here; as a matter of fact, they don’t care for rich people, and they say nasty things: “Oh, that person’s rich, and they just don’t understand us, because they’re rich.” They’ll ridicule outsiders who are tourists because they perceive them as being people with money coming through here, and they don’t see what they will do to the community by being here. When I talk to outsiders, right away when they find out you’re from Antonito, they have a negative [response], because they don’t know if they like you. We’re not seen as very civilized. They’re afraid of us, and their perception is that this is a lawless place. It was a place to come for dances in the past, and people got into a lot of fights. Even though people fight over here, a lot, and every time you turn around somebody is mad at somebody, or jealous of somebody, they’re not usually violent. They don’t throw bottles at each other. People don’t go around with knives in their pockets, and they don’t go around killing each other. The town is quiet, quiet. So I would say this place is super safe, but I always feel like it’s twenty years behind the times. The climate is super cold in the winter, and not everybody can take it—it’s almost like an Alaska experience. In the wintertime you have hard driving conditions, because it’s icy, and you have to learn how to drive on icy roads, and they don’t even have people that scrape them all the time. So we have to learn to live like that. And we’re high-altitude, and it’s hard on the body to live at a high altitude, but if you’re born here, it’s a little bit easier. If you’re not from here, you have to adjust, and it takes usually a year to adjust to the altitude, the coldness. Almost everybody has to put on [weight], you have to be a little heavier than the average city person or person in a hot climate, because you have to go outside a lot and it’s colder here, so you have to have a little layer of fat to be comfortable. Living at this altitude, and being isolated, is hard for some. But not for all, because some people who are born here and used to this lifestyle, they do well, especially if they haven’t seen anything else. But if you have somebody who maybe went to school somewhere else and sees another part of life, it’s harder for them to come back. You just have a lot more work here. You don’t have conveniences, and you can’t just go to the deli and get something. You have to prepare for the winter and have all your food, in case something should happen,

because you need to have your stock of beans, your stock of frozen chili, your stock of meat. So everybody stocks, cans and everything, for the winter. I mean it’s not that bad, we’re not that isolated, but that’s the way it is. There’s no stimulation, there’s no stores to go to. For everything you have to travel. So it’s not an easy place to live, especially for women. They expect you to work. With a minimum amount of money, they expect you to live. They don’t believe in luxuries. They don’t believe in fancy clothes or jewelry; men don’t think it’s important; they don’t value it. But a lot of women fix themselves up because that’s how they see themselves, and they don’t want to work so hard. But if you live on a ranch you’re expected to help with the smaller animals. The men take care of the larger animals, and it’s a lot of hard work. Then you’re expected to make things from scratch. If you get hungry and you have a craving, there’s no going down to the little restaurant. We’re so rural that we really don’t even have variety or places to go, like movies. When I was a child, I always saw things I loved about Antonito. I’ve lived all these places all my life, and this is actually home. Even though Albuquerque was my dad’s family’s, in the city, as a child, I never felt community. I complained about that, as a young child, that I wanted to move to the barrio. “Let’s get out of the suburbs. I want to be with my aunt. I want to live close to my aunt.” My dad tells me, “We have a right to live here.” But I’m like, “I want to be with our people.” So finally I am with our people, our people, the family, the community, and you just can’t get community in the city—everybody’s doing their own thing, there’s no community. I just feel really sorry for anybody who hasn’t experienced it, because, even though it has all its drawbacks—everybody can be jealous of you, or mad at your whole family—it’s still a feeling of being a part of community that gets lost in a large city. I guess I had a need for it. Yes, that’s what I was searching for all my life.

Janice underscored many important facets of Antonito culture. It is a community where everyone knows everyone and experiences cooperation and competition, reciprocity and envy, mutual aid and feuds. People value sameness and dislike ostentation, perhaps because of their history of class and ethnic oppression. Although the town is small and quite isolated, people carve out roles, define identity, and relate to each other in many different ways. Important forces determining identity and social position that women experience in complex and intersecting ways are Spanish- or

English-language use, racial or ethnic ancestry, religious affiliation, class, occupation, experience outside the community, and gender.

Language and Education, Spanish and English An important part of Antonito Mexicano culture has always been the Spanish language, the language of the people, the ancestors, and the home before about 1950, when English increasingly became dominant. For the older study participants, language use was linked to education, for they learned English in school, and the more education they had, the more adept they were in English. Ninety-four-year-old Helen Ruybal told me she was more comfortable speaking English than Spanish, even though when she grew up in the hamlet of Lobatos, she said, “Spanish . . . was the only thing they knew in that small town.” Eighty-one-year-old Ramona Valdez, who grew up on the family ranch in Guadalupe, said, “I didn’t know a word of English when I started school.” However, several of the people I interviewed had ancestors who knew both English and Spanish and could speak, read, and sometimes write both, like Teddy Madrid’s grandparents, Bernadette Vigil’s parents, and Ramona Valdez’s father. People born before 1950, in addition to speaking English fluently, all spoke Spanish well but were less comfortable reading it and even less comfortable writing it. People born after 1950 tended to be native speakers of English and to speak only some Spanish. And most of the town’s youth born after about 1980 knew little or no Spanish. In the past education and class played an important role in family bilingualism, but in the new millennium there is little Spanish in any socioeconomic group. English came to dominance because of several forces: schools, Presbyterian missions, and commerce. Swadesh (1974, 202) claimed that the schools fostered “the repression of the Spanish language and of Hispanic culture,” and my subjects’ experiences confirmed her claim. Most subjects born in the first half of the twentieth century encountered English for the first time when they started school, where its use was mandatory. In school and the business world, English was an asset. Dolores Conlin (a pseudonym), whose father started several stores in northern New Mexico and one in Antonito, said that there was pressure to learn English because “everything was in English.” “So the Spanish,” she continued, “they’d go over to the English because most of the business was in English. It wasn’t in Spanish at all.” But the transition from Spanish to English was

not easy. Many people recognized that although important, English was the language of outsiders, and it threatened Mexicano culture. TEDDY MADRID ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH

Teddy Madrid had a vivid memory of language conflict in her public elementary school in Las Mesitas in the 1940s, a school where the pupils, teachers, and principal were all Mexicanos. Las Mesitas School was just totally taught in English. They did teach Spanish in high school but not in elementary. They were trying to encourage the children to use English. They had vigilantes—they would have these two little older guys, who just loved putting on these red bands. One experience that I had—I was in first grade. I was outside on the merry-go-round, and I was loud and just boisterous and having a grand old time, and I was speaking Spanish. Here came these two bully kids, and they grabbed me and told me that I was breaking the rule: “You’re not supposed to speak Spanish.” I told them, “There is freedom of speech.” By that time my dad had already taught me two things. First, there is freedom of speech, you can speak any way you want. And second, he said, “If there is not a leader, you be the leader.” He also said, “You are women, you are citizens. You have the right. All these liberties that you have, nobody can quench your creativity or quench your rights.” Then he taught us the rights of others. So they dragged me off to the principal, these two bullies, I call them bullies. I was kicking and said, “There’s freedom of speech! There’s freedom of speech!” They took me to the principal, and the principal said, “You were speaking Spanish? It’s against the rules.” I told him, “My dad told me there is freedom of speech and I can speak Spanish if I want to, out on the playground, I can.” So he let me go. He didn’t do anything. The other kids were just so sad because at last they had caught someone that they could drag to the principal.1

Teddy’s story revealed her respect for the fundamental American values of free speech and due process, as well as her opposition to the imposition of monolingualism. Her account shows that schools were active agents in the suppression of the Spanish language and made Mexicano

children enforcers of that suppression. It shows what Hispanic children were up against in holding on to their language and helps to explain why Spanish no longer thrives in this region. RAMONA VALDEZ ON ENGLISH AND SPANISH

Eighty-one-year-old Ramona Valdez added to Teddy Madrid’s perspective by highlighting how school, social pressure, shame, and the decline of the Spanish-speaking community worked to promote English and undermine her family’s rich bilingual culture. I think it’s a shame that very few speak Spanish anymore because they could really qualify for good jobs being bilingual. Even in my family, the majority of my great-nieces and great-nephews speak only English. They don’t want to lose their heritage, but in that part they are, because they don’t speak their language. But in other ways they are very loyal to their Hispanic roots. My niece is doing a lot of research on our family history; she traced it to the 1600s. Very few speak Spanish anymore. I myself don’t speak it so good. There’s lots of words I’m used to saying in English, because I have nobody anymore. My father and I used to talk Spanish—although he could talk English real good. Father learned English at [boarding] school in Kansas City. I guess he learned to read in Spanish at his house. He could write both in English and in Spanish and talk in both. I don’t know why I didn’t learn [to read] Spanish with Father. We had several books, and then my father subscribed to several papers. He received the Kansas City Star. Then we’d buy the Denver Post every Sunday, and the local paper, he always received that. He always received another, that was the Pathfinder, and that finally went down. We got that for a long time. That was such a nice one. Then he received La Revista Católica, that was in Spanish. I think he received another one, a Spanish newspaper from Taos, La Voz del Pueblo.2 I learned English when I went to school. I didn’t know any English at all. The first thing that they taught me before I went to school was, “May I be excused?” so that I could go to the bathroom. I didn’t know anything else. I went to school in Alamosa. At that time they had A and B, and I started in B because I didn’t know any English. But for the second grade, they promoted me to A. In the fourth grade they didn’t allow speaking Spanish, they wanted everybody to talk in English. The majority of the Hispanics would learn English. I guess it didn’t matter to me

because at home I talked Spanish. That’s what I learned first. I was the type that whatever they said, I guess I followed the rules. That was the rules of school. I remember there was an ice-cream man like there is now, only in a buggy. They’d give me a nickel every day and I’d buy an ice-cream cone. All I remember is getting my ice cream and eating it. And he told me one time—see, at school they used to tell us to say, “Yes ma’am”—and he said, “You sabi English?” and I said, “Yes, ma’am”—and he was a man. I have never forgotten that embarrassment. I don’t think the next day I bought ice cream.

Seventy-years after this event, Ramona still remembered her embarrassment at speaking English incorrectly, which was a powerful catalyst to learn it well. She articulated the connection between language and culture by noting the many Spanish-language periodicals her family read when she was young; these periodicals played a key role in sustaining Hispanic culture in the Southwest, and their decline paralleled the imposition of English in the schools and the broader community (Rosales 1997). Ramona underscored how not knowing English placed her in the lower group at school, whereas learning English marked her as smart and enabled her to fit into the increasingly anglicized world. Clearly, English was associated with power, and it affected her and her culture. HELEN RUYBAL ON LEARNING ENGLISH AND BEING SMART

Helen Ruybal expressed themes similar to those of Ramona Valdez. She remembered starting first grade in about 1912. At first I didn’t even know any English. We bought pamphlets—little books, one line in English and one in Spanish and all the little lessons. I tried to use it, like if I said, “I like to play, me gusta jugar, I like to play,” because I was learning to read and that was getting installed in my mind. I would just spend nights reading the pamphlets, and I finally learned to understand English. By the time I went to school, I wasn’t lost. More or less I could read and nobody taught me. When I went to school, kids my age didn’t know a word of English. I used a lot, I knew a lot, and I was already a bookworm. I always wanted books with pictures and what it said under the pictures. My brother knew how to read, and my mother knew a little bit how to read, and my father knew. Then I’d

get—even a catalog, even a pamphlet that would come by mail, or one of my little books, and I’d get lost. We had an outside toilet, and I’d go there, and I’d sit down and read and read, and “Where is Helen?” My mother said, “She must be in the toilet reading.” I would read, but mostly I was trying to get away from the chores! I’d come back, and my uncle would say that he thought I was smart. My mother and father thought I was smart because I loved books so much and I was learning those English lines without hearing it, and just reading it in those little books. It wasn’t heard at home at all, conversations in English, at that time when I was growing up. My uncle was saying that I was smart, smart, and his wife said, “Yes, she’s smart. She even knows how to get away from chores around the house and lets her sister handle it all.” So when I went to school I already understood English. I couldn’t carry on or talk very well, but all these little things that I had learned would come to my mind, all the “eat” and “play”—I mean the words. At that time the school was in Lobatos. I was one of the smartest ones because I could read English. I don’t think the young people should forget Spanish. If you know two languages, you’re up somewhere. You get asked for certain jobs, and most of them, if you speak both languages, they prefer you for that. That’s another thing with my grandchildren, they don’t use it at all. They speak only English, and if we talk Spanish they have to really pay attention to know what’s going on. I tell them not to forget it. It’s nice, I say, to be able to use both. Because when you grow older, I tell them, you might have a good opportunity, a better opportunity, if you speak both languages. So I make them open their eyes and that’s all. I don’t care how good an English you can use, use the Spanish when you want to or have to, or if you’re just there and something is going on in Spanish, you know what’s going on. You don’t remain blank and ask them what they said.

Helen lamented the loss of Spanish at the same time that she valued English and linked her success in school and her liberation from domestic chores to her early knowledge of it. She understood something that the English-language school system is still coming to terms with—that knowing two languages at an early age conveys a social and educational advantage (see Gándara 2002; Pearson 2002; Zentella 2002). It was not only the public schools that mandated English; so did the Catholic nuns when they took over the Antonito public schools in the 1930s, and the Presbyterian missionaries also had a long-standing commitment to English-language education.

TEDDY MADRID ON LEARNING ENGLISH FROM THE PRESBYTERIANS

Sixty-six-year-old Teddy Madrid grew up in a bilingual family. Her maternal relatives learned English at the Presbyterian school in Mogote.3 My maternal grandmother had gone to school with Miss Clemens, the missionary from New York or Pennsylvania, who came down here and set up the mission school in Mogote. My grandmother went to school there, and also my great-grandmother. They loved Miss Clemens. Even my mother knew Miss Clemens, although my mother did not go to the mission school. By my mother’s time they had the public school. My mother would take us to the Presbyterian church, and all our Sunday School instructions were in English. But on my dad’s side, my grandmother knew how to write and read Spanish. She hated English. All conversations between adults in our family would be in Spanish.

Ethnic, Gender, and Religious Identity Over the course of the twentieth century, English increasingly prevailed in Antonito through the influence of the school and the Presbyterian church, and it became increasingly common in the public sphere. Spanish use waned, and by 2000 only a few elders spoke Spanish fluently and almost everyone spoke English well, so language was no longer a barrier between Anglos and Hispanics. There were, however, several interlocking forces in Antonito that did create divisions between people: class, gender, religion, and ethnicity. While most people in Antonito identified as Hispanic, there were many ambiguities and differences as well as commonalities in their ethnic consciousness. How they defined and talked about their Hispanic identity varied according to their generation, gender, class, education, and experiences of ethnic diversity and discrimination. Many claimed ancestry back to Spain; many also identified with the historic Hispanic and Native American cultures of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. While this New Mexican/Spanish/Native American ethnic strain predominated, many people claimed ancestries that included “Anglo,” Irish, French, Jewish, and Swedish. People used many terms to identify themselves: Spanish, Spanish American, Hispanic, Chicano, Mexicano, la gente, and la raza.4 Joe Taylor

referred to his culture and grandparents as mestizo as well as Chicano (Taylor and Taggart 2003, 81–82) and Reyes Garcia (1988, 1998), an Antonito native, used the term “Indo Hispano” to describe his culture.5 In Antonito many used the terms “Spanish” and “Spanish American,” especially older people.6 When speaking Spanish, some people defined themselves as españoles, but far more common was Mexicanos. In Antonito, “Mexicano” referred to the Hispanic American citizens of Antonito and had a different meaning from the English word “Mexican,” which meant “from Mexico,” an identity most people in Antonito rejected. The terms “Mexican American” and “Latina/o” were rarely used as self-referents in Antonito. My study participants experienced their ethnicity in complex and contrasting ways. They expressed pride in their Hispanic identity and their deep roots in the Upper Rio Grande region while downplaying their Mexican ancestry and emphasizing their Spanish heritage. For example, thirty-two-year-old Martha Mondragon, the youngest woman in my study, said, “I define myself as Hispanic or Spanish, not Mexicano, probably because I grew up knowing that our ancestors came from Spain.” Some study participants made it clear that they wanted to distinguish themselves from recent Mexican immigrants, many of whom were “illegal,” uneducated, poor, and, often, vilified. Yet others sympathized with the plight of Mexican migrants, as Ramona Valdez did. Some people identified themselves as “Chicana/o,” a term that entered the vocabulary in the 1960s and 1970s when Mexican Americans adopted it to indicate a politicized view of their people. Some in Antonito, like Joe Taylor (Taylor and Taggart 2003), used the term with pride; others, like eightyone-year-old Ramona, hated it because, she said, “it sounds like low.” Teddy Madrid spoke of the early 1970s: “I remember hearing that some of the students had started calling themselves Chicanos; they were not Mexicans. What we had known as la gente, la raza, los mexicanos, the Hispanic, you know? All of a sudden, it wasn’t that anymore.” Teddy said that she identified herself as Hispanic or Spanish American on the census. In Spanish she might use mexicanos or hispanos. But what her father used to say was somos raza, and to Teddy it signified that “we knew our roots and we knew where we came from.” Her use of the term raza was not in the more widespread sense of “the Hispanic people,” as in La Raza Unida political party; for her, raza referred to the identity of the settlers who came to the valley in the nineteenth century and who knew each other by their unique spoken Spanish, different from that of Mexican immigrants. The diverse terminology people in Antonito used

to identity themselves reflected their complex self-depictions; while they shared Hispanic identity, they thought about it very differently. RAMONA VALDEZ ON ETHNIC TERMINOLOGY

I call myself Hispanic and Mexicano, which is not right, but we’re used to saying “Mexicano.” Because mostly we say españoles or Mexicanos. In reality we are Hispanic, but we say Mexicano. Myself, I don’t like “Chicano,” and I don’t think any in my family did, but I can’t remember. I know my brother didn’t. And my sister much less, because she moved to New Mexico. When I’m asked what I am [in English], I say Spanish. What these [health care] providers are used to saying, which I try to break them of, they say, “brown,” “white.” I told them, “Don’t you dare call me white or brown. Call me Hispanic, but don’t call me by colors.” They used to say brown, they’re all brown, and then the Anglos are white, I’m not used to that. It’s just of late that they just started that. Let’s say Chicanos or Mexicanos or gringos, but never by colors. I just don’t like it, I don’t know why. I try not to use it. I don’t like the word “gringo” either. I very seldom use it.7 We’re all so mixed that we can’t say that we’re this or that. When Clinton was running, he said, “We’re all immigrants.” Because there are so many complaining about the Mexicans coming in, or the Guatemalans, to work, and I’m for them because I feel so bad. Every time they catch a truck full of Mexicans and return them back, oh, it hurts me. The only natives are the Indians; we’re all immigrants, we all came from another place. So that’s what I think. When I hear somebody complaining about the Mexicans coming here, I say, “Well, we’re all the same.” If you’re Indian, then you can complain, but otherwise, no. We all came from Spain or from Mexico, but we all came; well, we were born here, but not our ancestors. When I was working [in Santa Fe], this Anglo tells me, “Well, you’re Mexican, because you came from Mexico, your ancestors came.” I said, “I don’t know.” I know part of them came from Spain. I don’t know the rest.

Ramona and many others said that their roots lay in Spain, but they had limited knowledge about their ancestry, a fact that contributed to their complex and conflicted ethnic identity. Helen Ruybal said, “Mucha gente, they want to be español, and they have some relations with old-timers from Spain, and they keep it living, alive.”

It is likely that the historical discrimination against Mexicans in the United States and the recent anti-immigration fervor worked against a strong identification with Mexico. Furthermore, as Teddy Madrid underscored, people had an intense and positive connection with Spain, probably developed through the romanticization of the Spanish conquest of the New World. TEDDY MADRID ON THE CONNECTION WITH SPAIN

I think that we will never lose that Hispanic, that luster, that thinking of Spain. Even though we know that it’s been years and years. I remember as a child just loving Christopher Columbus and memorizing poems about Christopher Columbus. To me, it didn’t matter where he was from but that he came from Spain and Queen Isabella and giving him ships to sail the ocean blue. I respect that connection, even though I’ve never gone to Spain, I’ve never gone to Mexico. So we’ve never gone back to our roots, wherever they are. My sisters have; two of my sisters have gone back three or four times to Spain. But I think if anything connects us to the Hispanic, it is the language and the culture—so much of the culture and so much of the suffering, and the courage that the Hispanics had to just come to the New World and just conquer it.

Discrimination and Prejudice People wove many strains into their ethnic identity. Like Teddy Madrid, many took pride in their Spanish roots and their Hispanic identity. Because the Antonito area was overwhelmingly Hispanic, my study participants rarely encountered prejudice within their community. But people from Antonito did encounter anti-Mexicano racism when they traveled, its extent varying by gender, generation, class, and exposure. Men seemed to encounter more racism than did women, perhaps because they traveled outside the Hispanic world more, for work and military service. In spite of his Anglo-sounding name, Joe Taylor was fully Chicano, and he endured a great deal of anti-Hispanic racism throughout his life—in the potato fields, perlite mines, and factories of southern Colorado (Taylor and Taggart 2003). In contrast, Ramona Valdez, who until she moved to Santa Fe had rarely traveled beyond Antonito, remembered little discrimination except for one encounter with the segregated wings in the Alamosa hospital in the late 1930s. Although Bernadette Vigil ran into gender discrimination in Antonito, she did not

experience racial discrimination until she moved east over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to Pueblo, Colorado, in the 1960s. Teddy Madrid ran into pervasive anti-Mexican stereotypes in Greeley, Colorado, when she was in a Ph.D. program for teachers at the University of Northern Colorado. The women I interviewed lived in predominantly Hispanic environments, both in the family and in the workplace. For example, Helen, a lifelong teacher, said, “In San Rafael we were all Spanish. In Las Mesitas we were nine teachers, and we were all Spanish, and here in San Antonio we were three and only one was English. I never was dismissed because I was Spanish, and I was never hired because I was Spanish, I don’t think.” Several women suggested that because Hispanics were the majority in Antonito, they were somewhat sheltered from prejudice. Nonetheless, some Mexicanos said that local Anglo parents opposed their children’s marriage to Hispanics at the same time that Hispanic parents favored their children’s marriages to Anglos—regardless of their social class. People mentioned several Anglos who came to Antonito with nothing and made a fortune in land and property because local Hispanics welcomed and helped them, even though many Anglos looked down on Mexicanos. Even when they complained about Anglos, Mexicanos focused their distaste on specific greedy or prejudiced people and treated other Anglos cordially. Several people emphasized that they themselves did not discriminate against people of other racial or ethnic groups. For example, Carmen Lopez said, “I think people look at people here. Don’t think that because you’re a gringa, they’re going to be more lovable to you, because they won’t. Do you think that if a colored person comes here, they’re going to be more lovable to them? No. A Spanish person? No.” HELEN RUYBAL ON DISCRIMINATION

When I asked Helen Ruybal if she had had any experience of discrimination, I was wondering if she had suffered it, but she understood the question to mean if she had ever inflicted it. Her answer was revealing because it showed how she felt in the center, not on the periphery, of her culture. No, we didn’t discriminate, we thought everybody had a right to be around. We weren’t discriminating. Even now, we don’t—well, to a little extent we do, like, supposing you were an Anglo and then a Spanish girl would be against you, trying to outdo you in things. Well, if she’s

8/20/09 10:15:21 AM

a friend of the family or something, you favored her, not because she’s Spanish but just maybe a relative or something. A little discrimination but not hard, not in business. Not in elections. In elections we always vote for whoever we think can do better. But the more you mixed [with Anglos], the better you were; sometimes you mix quite well, and other times you just hate the Anglos, other times you hate the Mexicans, and then you hate the poor, and another one hates the good-looking people, and they don’t want them [laughs].

Helen joked about prejudice and thus tamed it, but she acknowledged it nonetheless. Interethnic mixing was limited, and there were only a few Hispanics in upper-class environments such as Helen’s predominantly Anglo boarding school in the early 1920s.8 She shrugged off having any problems getting along but told me that it was there that she changed her name from Elena to Helen: “I didn’t know what I was doing. I was crazy. I don’t know why I changed it. Changing a Spanish name into English—I didn’t know what I was doing.” Helen perhaps meant that she didn’t realize the full import of anglicizing her name. Perhaps she did it to fit in better at her Anglo school or to “pass” as Anglo. This act probably was a reflection of the extent to which being Anglo conferred higher social status. TEDDY MADRID ON MULTIPLE IDENTITIES AND AXES OF PREJUDICE

Teddy Madrid recognized the complexities of prejudice for people with minority status along axes of gender, race-ethnicity, and religion—what scholars have called “multiple jeopardy” (e.g., King 1988). Teddy and her siblings did not join the majority Catholic religion of their father’s family but rather followed her mother’s religion and became part of the small but long-standing Hispanic Presbyterian community, which placed them outside the mainstream. Teddy encountered some racial prejudice at work and felt that she constantly had to prove herself as a woman, especially after she left her position as a K-12 teacher to become a professor at Adams State College in nearby Alamosa. I think what I felt when I went to Adams State, was, hey, we’re all on the same playing level over here. I was a woman who had proven, I think, what I could do, and here it was I had to prove it all over again.

This was the kind of thing but it’s sort of natural in a way. I also had to attend state meetings, as an administrator for this small district, where it was again, “You are an administrator?” And little attitudes like that, that I attributed more not to the fact that I was Hispanic, but that I was a woman, and maybe Hispanic. I always said that I was glad that the children, our children, were raised here in Antonito because when they went out, they had no idea what prejudice was. I think prejudice is a very hate-driven thing, and it’s very destructive. My mother’s family were Presbyterians. My great-great-grandfather Jimeo Manzanares was already a Presbyterian when he came and built that little Presbyterian church in Mogote. So my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, and my great-great-grandfather were Presbyterians. On my dad’s side, they made fun because he left the Catholic Church, and he never went back after he married my mother. That was a choice that he made, and my grandmother was very angry. She was very disturbed about that. My aunt, to the day my dad died, she was trying to get him back, paying Masses for him. I am very astute about people’s motives, and I can distinguish between ignorance and prejudice and prejudice that is subtle and different kinds of prejudice. Is it prejudice because I am Hispanic? Prejudice because I am a woman? Prejudice because I’m a Protestant? I’ve experienced that throughout my life in different situations, and I know that I’m pretty tough. Being in a community where it is prominently Roman Catholic and you’re in the minority of being a Presbyterian, I think that you feel somewhat isolated from the community and there are religious differences and things that create sort of a wall, I think, between people. I remember distinctly my sister and me being at a social gathering and this one man turning around and telling us, “You gals are just fine, you’re just super, you’re just great. The only trouble with you is you’re heretics.” He said that. We looked at each other and we thought, “Well, we’re heretics in his eyes, what else is he thinking?” But those kinds of things are subtle, and yet you turn around and he is one of our best friends. But there’s some truth to the saying that what comes out of your mouth is indeed what’s in your heart.

Teddy’s story testified to the complexities of identity and prejudice within the Hispanic community. When she said prejudice against women was “sort of natural in a way,” she emphasized how deep-rooted it was. Fur-

thermore, she experienced intertwining prejudice—being female, Hispanic, and Presbyterian—which demonstrated that even within her own Hispanic community she was sometimes an outsider. RAMONA VALDEZ ON RELIGIOUS AND ANTI-HISPANIC PREJUDICE

Eighty-one-year-old Ramona Valdez spoke about her experiences of racial-ethnic difference and prejudice, which were complicated by the fact that she looked white and also by the fact that she had a congenital hip disorder (shared by many members of her family), rendering her handicapped physically. She too noted the religious boundaries mentioned by Teddy Madrid. In Alamosa, since I lived there almost year-round, I had lots of friends there. I remember some of the girls were Protestants, and they invited me to their programs, like the Protestants have, the Presbyterians had programs, and the Catholics at that time didn’t have anything for the young. They’d invite me to go with them, and Mother wouldn’t let me. At that time we were raised each religion like separate. Now I know better, but in those days, that’s the way it was. But we were friends. [My hair was] light brown, a very light brown. Mother used to say that it was almost blond, and my brother too. [My parents] were both fair. My mother was white, the Spanish white. My father had blue eyes and was very fair. Lots of times he was mistaken for Anglo. He laughed. I don’t think he resented it; he thought it was funny. I think [being Hispanic] is a good thing. I never found it any bad. But I was thinking when you had asked me that question about prejudice, and then I remembered the Alamosa hospital. That must have been in '38 or '39. I went to the hospital and I remember I was in a wheelchair and these two nurses were in back of me and they were talking. At the hospital they had a section where they put the Spanish and one where they put the Anglos, and they were saying, “Where can we put her? She looks Anglo, yet her name is Valdez.” I felt hurt, and then I didn’t care. Like I said, I always followed the rules. I know I wasn’t friendly to those nurses anymore, nor they to me, because they felt embarrassed, I guess. But those were the rules of the hospital. There was one wing for the Hispanics and the other wing for the Anglos. In school I don’t remember noticing anything [about discrimination]. Of course, maybe I just didn’t notice. I used to hear that in Monte Vista

[forty miles northwest of Antonito] they were prejudiced, because a lot of people from Mexico and New Mexico came to work in the potatoes, in the fields, and I did hear about the Mexicans not being allowed in some restaurants or some dance halls. I used to hear that at the Minkhaven lodge [on the Conejos River] they didn’t let any Hispanics go to the dances there. But I don’t know, I can’t say, because I never went there. I wasn’t a dancer, but I used to hear that. Because there was this couple, that a Hispanic was married to an Anglo, and they went and they weren’t allowed in. So I don’t know if it’s true, but I believe so, because why would they say such a thing?

BERNADETTE VIGIL ON CHICANO CONSCIOUSNESS

Bernadette Vigil (a pseudonym) had lived in Pueblo, Colorado, as well as Antonito, and she had a well-developed racial-ethnic consciousness. She was a neighbor whom I met soon after coming to Antonito, and I interviewed her twice. Bernadette was born in 1948 into a family of five. She held several secretarial jobs, married and divorced twice, and had one adult daughter who lived in Denver. Food permeated Bernadette’s life and relationships, and I have written about her before (Counihan 2002, 2005). She strongly identified as Mexicana and as Chicana due to having been radicalized politically in the sixties, a time of enormous political ferment and Chicano militancy.9 In my younger years, in the sixties, I was living in Pueblo. I was in that La Raza Unida! There was a bunch of us. We had the posters of Ché and, oh lord have mercy, I can’t believe half the stuff I was involved in. We would go to rallies, and we’d go to the meetings. It was unfair what they were doing with Chicanos, that we were at the lower levels. We were at the lower level of education, we were at the lower level of getting jobs. Every opportunity, if you were not white you did not get it. If you had a Hispanic name they shuffled you to the back. I thought, that’s not fair. So there we were, marching. It was just all classified into what your race was—if you were Chicana or Chicano you still got shafted either way. You got the lowest job, the lowest pay. Antonito was never affected with none o
