Once Upon a Time star Raphael Sbarge has admitted that his character's upcoming storyline made him cry.

Sbarge plays Archie Hopper / Jiminy Cricket on the reality-hopping ABC drama, which also stars Jennifer Morrison.

The actor told Entertainment Weekly: "The writers use [the town of Storybrooke] as a springboard into the story of how Jiminy Cricket came to be, which is so delightful because it gives us such imaginative ways of re-examining who these people are."

He explained that the story arc devised by the show's writers "knocked [him] out".

"Frankly, it made me weep," he confessed. "What they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful."

Sbarge also revealed that the fantasy series will continue to explore the relationship between his other character Archie and Henry (Jared Gilmore).

"Archie is - for Henry, who has no dad - sort of a surrogate father figure," he suggested. "So, he's there to help him transition and deal with being adopted."

Once Upon a Time continues on Sunday at 8/7c on ABC.
