I hit my daily limit last night, so I had to stop tweeting. Thank you so much for joining me!\n\nHere we bring out Easter Eggs, connections to other TV shows, movies and lines and concepts that may come into play in a later episode.\n\nIf you have anything you would like to add to our podcast, please leave a Voicemail at: 657-333-0626. Thanks.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nL: Lost connections.\n\nNL: Non-Lost connections (Star Wars, Classic Movie motifs, Fairy Tales, and Once Upon a Time call backs).\n\nNL: Jiminy‚Äôs Mom (as the puppet), ‚ÄúI wish, but nothing changes‚Äù ‚ÄúI wish I was better at wishing‚Äù.\n\n** Wishing (Empty wishes (perhaps like Aladdin, ‚ÄúI want a million dollars‚Äù or more meaningful wishes) and Wishing to Change (I wish to change myself or help someone else)\n\nNL: Jiminy said Crickets can do whatever they want, and are free to hop from place to place. *Like the viewers hop from the Fairy Tale land to the real world, or how Mr. Gold/Rumpelstiltskin does?\n\nNL: Jiminy‚Äôs parents tell him he is free to do what they want, and to be who you are. You are who you are. Jiminy says he doesn‚Äôt want to steal. He wants to be good.\n\nNL: Good is another word for weak. We already know that all evil curses can be broken, and are beginning to see that the Evil curse is weakening by good people making the choice to face responsibility and step into their destiny (and not run from it).\n\nNL: His parents tell him to let them do the thinking for Jiminy. Jiminy‚Äôs parents control his actions, as well as Regina control Archie‚Äôs actions ‚Äì for now.\n\nNL: Archie Hopper asks, ‚ÄúWhy do you believe that I am Jiminy Cricket?‚Äù Henry matter of factly replies, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs who you are ‚Äì you‚Äôre a conscience‚Äù. Henry sees who Archie is on the inside which makes him that, but Archie can‚Äôt see that. The subject of the heart or (hidden or shown) intentions of a person making them who they are is a focus of this episode. Again, we see that Henry speaks to the core of a person again (Emma is brave, Regina is Evil, and Archie is a conscience).\n\nNL: Archie tells Henry to ‚Äúkeep thinking about why he believes the curse is real, because something is buried there‚Äù. Alluding to the sinkhole.\n\nNL: Emma challenges the outer trappings of a deputy outfit. Does the outer appearance translate to who you are? Clothes and a tie are just clothes, but the badge has the power.\n\nNL: Actions toward destiny and responsibility cause actions in the Real World, as the Evil Curse begins to be broken (Not all at once, but slowly, as more pieces of the ‚Äúarmy‚Äù to destroy the Evil queen‚Äôs plan and the curse come together);\n\nEmma staying in Storybrooke ‚Äì caused the clock to begin to work again. Pushing the countdown to the final battle.\n\nEmma‚Äôs deal (a future favor for Mr. Gold) ‚Äì brought Sean to Ashley\n\nEmma accepting the deputy badge (and, according to Sheriff Graham, ‚ÄúBecome a part of the community. You have to make it official.‚Äù) ‚Äì the sinkhole began\n\nArchie standing up to Regina, and thus being who he really is ‚Äì brings back the crickets. Note: Henry says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been crickets here, you‚Äôve just never noticed. We do hear an owl in the background. What else is missing?\n\nQuestion: Does MMB‚Äôs action of resigning undo an action toward the final battle?\n\nWe can assume the sinkhole exposed the mineshaft opening, right?\n\nEvery decision and/or step toward everyone destiny seems to be causing Storybrooke Maine to erode/fall away/peel back to expose the ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù to the Fairy Tale World creatures, the fairy tale world.\n\nNote: The portion here has been moved to a separate blog post here: http://new.roneyzone.com/blogs/once-upon-a-time-tv-show-blogs/ouat-was-the-mine-shaft-a-shout-out-to-the-hatch-in-lost-you-decide/\n\nNL: Besides Henry, we see other children at the school, around the sinkhole, etc, but not interacting with Henry.\n\nQuestion: What year was Storybrooke frozen in?\n\nArchie tells Regina, ‚ÄúI think its wrong to ‚Äúrip away‚Äù the world he‚Äôs constructed.‚Äù Is Storybrooke only in Henry‚Äôs imagination? Each Fairy Tale person that remembers who they are and take their place in destiny is ripping away at ‚Äúthe world‚Äù of Storybrooke.\n\nNL: The little boy talking to an older Jiminy was his Jiminy, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like your job, why don‚Äôt you do something else?‚Äù Then he gives him an umbrella.\n\nL: Apollo Candy bar.\n\nNL: Archie tells Henry, ‚ÄúThis has to stop for your own good. You have to wake up.‚Äù When it‚Äôs actually Archie that needs to wake up from the sleep in Storybrooke.\n\nNL: David Nolan mentioned ‚Äúa horse‚Äù during hangman with Mary Margaret. Alluding to Fairy Tale land and their meeting when she stole the horse.\n\nL: Nolan‚Äôs dog‚Äôs name, Ajax. A Jacks.\n\nNL: Emma warns MMB from getting involved with a married guy. Are we to assume that a married man was Henry‚Äôs father, or was it a mistake along the way?\n\nNL: MMB made S‚Äômores. That may come up later.\n\nNL: Emma asked Archie, ‚ÄúWhat could be strong enough to drown out your own conscience?‚Äù The Evil Curse, and working for Regina.\n\nNL: Rumpelstiltskin wanted the names of the people Archie stole the money from for the gold thread. Does Archie work for Rumpelstiltskin.\n\nNL: The floor where Rumpelstiltskin has a spiderweb design.\n\nQuestion: When Henry was in the mineshaft, another earthquake occurred. What caused it? Maybe as Archie got near the opening of the mineshaft, he began to believe what Henry had said about him, and as he entered the mineshaft, more of the Fairy Tale land was exposed?\n\nQuestion: How did a piece of Snow White‚Äôs coffin get out on the ground beyond the sinkhole for Regina to find it?\n\nNL: David Nolan said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I woke up in some strange land‚Äù\n\nNL: Archie asks Henry (a number of times), ‚ÄúWhy do you think it‚Äôs so important that your Fairy Tale theory is true?‚Äù Henry says, ‚ÄúBecause this can‚Äôt be all there is‚Äù. Life without passion or purpose is like living in Storybrooke. There must be more.\n\nNL: Henry mentioned that he didn‚Äôt find any proof in the mineshaft (Is he hiding the fact that he found the piece of Snow White‚Äôs coffin?), but Archie mentioned that he was lost (in the mine), and Henry found him and helped Archie remember the man he wanted to be. He just had to listen harder to the still small voice (his conscience).\n\nNL: Emma (the Savior) saved Archie and Henry.
