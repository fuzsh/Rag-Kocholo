Produced by Roddenberry Entertainment and hosted by Clare Kramer and David Magidoff, each week we follow a special guest down the rabbit hole of their favorite fixation – whether that be woodworking, puppetry, baking bread, or zorbing (yep, it’s a real thing). This is the podcast that understands everyone, even your favorite celebrity, is a Fanaddict about something.\n\nYou love him as Jiminy Cricket in Once Upon a Time, but do you know what Raphael Sbarge wishes for upon a star when is not busy portraying some of television's most iconic characters?
