Read to find out more details, what it’s for and who’s involved.\n\nCast members of ABC’s Once Upon A Time are hosting a virtual reunion, for a good cause. The actors, including Lana Parrilla (Regina Mills) and Colin O’Donoghue (Captain Hook), are raising money via Prizeo for the Children’s Hospital of Orange County, California.\n\nThe funds will go towards an Emergency Management Response Vehicle, which will provide on-site and remote testing for COVID-19.\n\nOf all who donate, one lucky fan of Once Upon A Time will be chosen to take part in the reunion. In exchange for this person’s generosity, the Storybrooke alums have offered to “share some of [our] favorite memories from set” as well as allowing the winner to ask their own burning questions about the show.\n\nIn addition to Parrilla and O’Donoghue, fellow season 7 stars Andrew J West (Henry Mills) and Dania Ramirez (Jacinda Vidrio/Cinderella) will also be making an appearance.\n\nCompleting the line-up are Jared Gilmore (Young Henry), Emilie de Ravin (Belle), Sean Maguire (Robin Hood), Rebecca Mader (Zelena/Wicked Witch of The West) and Raphael Sbarge (Archie Hopper/Jiminy Cricket).\n\nFollow writer Conor O’Brien on Twitter: @CourageousConor."
