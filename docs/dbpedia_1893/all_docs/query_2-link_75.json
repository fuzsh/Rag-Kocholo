        "text": "A familiar face will once again be back in Storybrooke in the Once Upon a Time Season 6 premiere. Raphael Sbarge, who plays both Jiminy Cricket and the human, Storybrooke version of the character, Dr. Archie Hopper, is returning for Onceâs first episode of Season 6.\n\nAccording to TVLine, which first reported the news, Archie will be back in the Once Upon a Time Season 6 premiere to deal with âa new patient.â However, the site could not confirm who that new patient is. Could it be Regina as she struggles to deal with Robin Hoodâs death? Is it Hyde, who might be using Archie as a way to get information on the people of Storybrooke? Those are my two guesses, but really, any of Onceâs characters are an option here.\n\nFor fans that donât remember, we last saw Sbargeâs Archie in Episode 3 of Season 4, just as Once Upon a Timeâs Frozen arc was beginning to kick into high gear. Since that time, Archieâs been absent from the show, but hopefully with the reveal of his ânew patient,â his return will have a major impact.\n\nAlthough he was a series regular on Once Upon a Time during its first season, Sbarge has been a recurring player throughout the showâs following four seasons. During that time, heâs landed a series-regular role on TNTâs Murder in the First and guest starred on several other shows, such as Better Call Saul, iZombie, and Hawaii Five-0.\n\nOnce Upon a Time Season 6 premieres on Sunday, Sept. 25, at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\n[Photo via ABC]\n\nDid you like this article?
