This town is full of magic, populated by fairytale characters once cursed by the Evil Queen Regina to live in our world—deprived of their memories and happy endings. Until Emma Swan came to town and changed everything. With the help of her son, Henry, Emma embraced her true identity as the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming—the Savior destined to break the Curse. But even after returning everyone’s memories, Emma’s mission was far from over. With the Curse broken, Mr. Gold (aka Rumplestiltskin) was free to bring magic to Storybrooke. And magic ALWAYS comes with a price…\n\nWhen Regina split herself in an attempt to eliminate her evil half, she unwittingly released the Evil Queen. Now the Evil Queen is back and ready to leave a trail of destruction in her wake. Meanwhile, Regina is quickly learning that destroying her dark side won’t be that easy, especially when dealing with the consequences of having unleashed the Queen on Storybrooke. Emma learns a life-altering secret that could have serious consequences for her family and loved ones. While the heroes grapple with what Emma is confronting, Henry welcomes the new arrivals from the Land of Untold Stories by pledging to help them complete their tales. But when Snow White, Prince Charming, Regina, Captain Hook and Zelena become entwined in these untold tales, they find themselves haunted by their own unfinished pasts. Meanwhile, after handing Storybrooke over to Mr. Hyde, Mr. Gold continues his quest to wake Belle from her self-induced sleeping curse, in hopes of reuniting with both her and their unborn child.\n\n“Once Upon a Time” stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Snow White/Mary Margaret, Jennifer Morrison as Emma Swan, Lana Parrilla as the Evil Queen/Regina, Josh Dallas as Prince Charming/David, Emilie de Ravin as Belle, Colin O’Donoghue as Hook, Jared S. Gilmore as Henry Mills, Rebecca Mader as Wicked Witch/Zelena and Robert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold.\n\nNext Episode TV Promo\n\nSneak Peeks\n\nScript Teases\n\nUpcoming Episodes\n\n• •\n\n6.20 - \"The Song In Your Heart\" written by David H.

It’s a really, really cool episode for my character.” (Bex then sneaked me a peek of her solo from the musical episode, and it looks wonderfully wicked.)\n\nMy heart breaks for Once Upon a Time‘s Regina. What will she do now that Robin has let her down? —E.J.\n\nI asked Lana Parrilla if Regina will blame herself for bringing the Wish Realm’s Robin of Locksley to Storybrooke, or if she will look sideways at Emma, who encouraged her to do so. “She blames herself to a degree,” Parrilla answered, “but she definitely blames another person — who I won’t mention.” TVLine - 3/14/2017\n\nDo you have more scoop on Robin’s return to Storybrooke on Once Upon a Time? — Jameson\n\nAs you may have noticed in photos from Sunday’s episode, Robin looks very, ahem, familiar. “Regina puts him in Robin Hood’s clothes, and that does something to her,” Lana Parrilla teases. “She’s completely overwhelmed and emotional over that because now he aesthetically looks exactly like the Robin Hood she was in love with, or is still in love with, and yet he’s not the same person.” However, Robin of Locksley isn’t quite who she thinks he is. “There are several things that he does that leads her to believe that he isn’t the Robin Hood that she knows, and that he is a different Robin,” Parrilla adds. EW - 3/10/17\n\nWhat can you tease about Once Upon a Time? — Harley\n\nThere’s an upcoming flashback that offers up what’s sure to be the most heartbreaking piece of information this show has dealt with throughout the entire series. Can’t say more than that, but you may find a hint in this week’s Hot Seat. EW - 3/3/17\n\nEduardo Castro Talks Designing the Costumes of Once Upon a Time 2/25/2017\n\nCan you tease anything for Henry on Once Upon a Time? I feel like he gets overlooked in spoilers… — Katherine\n\nYes. In fact, you could say that Henry’s gig as the author kicks into overdrive, which makes some residents of Storybrooke nervous about what that means. EW - 2/24/2017\n\nNatalie Abrams Reddit AMA 2/23/2017\n\nCan you reveal when Snow and Charming will both be awake on Once Upon a Time? — Miley\n\nI cannot reveal when, but I can give you a tease about how. “The manner by which they are brought out of the sleeping curse is moving,” Ginnifer Goodwin tells me. “I became emotional every time I read the script and it has nothing really to do with David or me.” EW - 1/10/2017\n\nOnce Upon a Time Eyes Musical Episode for Spring — Who Will Sing?\n\nAnything that can be teased on what Rumple and Belle will have to do in order to save Gideon on Once Upon a Time? — AshMarie\n\nRemember when Rumple said that time works wonky in the Dark Realm? The question then becomes: Can Rumple and Belle actually prevent Gideon’s future if they find his younger self? “That is the question of the second half of the season,” EP Edward Kitsis says. “That is exactly what we are going to explore.” EW - 1/6/17\n\nIs it me or is Once Upon a Time visiting far too many realms this year? — Sarah\n\nYes, the show will be jumping around between the wish realm, Storybrooke, Agrabah, and the dark realm in the back half of the season, but the frequent flyer miles that OUAT is going to rack up aren’t what you’re expecting. “The second half of the season isn’t like ‘We’re all in the wish realm, we’re all in Agrabah, we’re all in this dark realm,‘” EP Adam Horowitz says. “It’s a bunch of different things as the story crescendos. We’re trying to change things up a little bit where it’s not just ‘We’re going to be in one place for half a season and just explore that.’ There’s a unifying theme at play in the second half, but it’s not about location, it’s about this story and the conflict between characters.” EW - 12/23/16\n\nQuestion: How long will the Snow and Charming curse last on Once Upon a Time? —Shelly\n\nAusiello: The sleeping curse that afflicts the marrieds one at a time “is not something that stretches out for the rest of the season,” says co-creator Eddy Kitsis. But until it is lifted, “We’re going to see that toll that it takes on Charming, who toward the end of the [fall] run looked sleep-deprived, going dark and off the rails. Without his ‘calming center’ around, and without much sleep, he can get into some real trouble!” TVLine - 12/20/16\n\nOn Once Upon a Time, how many episodes will the Snowing curse last? — SnowingFan\n\nUnfortunately, it’s going to be a while. The pressure of the curse paired with Charming being ready to kill the Evil Queen and the lingering question of what really happened to his father means David is not doing OK. “What we’re seeing through David is somebody who is at his wits end,” EP Edward Kitsis says. “This curse with his wife, I think that what we’re seeing is that he’s staying up too late. Without Snow, you’re seeing him starting to give into darker impulses. We’re going to see him have to confront his own demons.” EW - 12/16/16\n\nWhy doesOnce Upon a Time Once Upon a Time‘s Gideon wants to kill Emma? Is it because she’s the Savior, or does he have his own reasons? —Rebecca\n\n“‘Why does he need to kill her?’ is the real question,” says co-creator Eddy Kitsis — but we will have to wait (many weeks) for the answer. Until then, Adam Horowitz previews, “We pick up with that [pawn shop] scene, and Gold and Belle will articulate some of the questions that our viewers have” — including: “What happened to Gideon? Why is he seemingly after Emma? And in her vision, what is motivating him?” — “and most of that stuff gets answered pretty quickly.” (For more on Once, I teased Episode 12 in this week’s Ask Ausiello Live.) TVLine - 12/13/16 the 6x12 tease was that the mystery of who killed David's father will wrap up around Easter\n\nQuestion: Will we see Once Upon a Time‘s Black Fairy again? Will we also get an explanation as to why she steals babies and what happens to them afterwards? —Rebecca\n\nAusiello: Coming out of that fall finale, this comes as little surprise: “We are going to see a lot more of the Black Fairy (played by Jaime Murray),” series cocreator Adam Horowitz assures, “exploring her both in the past and present and learning more about Rumple’s relationship to his mother and the strange land from which she hails.”\n\nQuestion: I know I’m not the only one who caught The Dragon mentioning a daughter in Once Upon a Time Episode 8. Have the showrunners said anything lately about when Lily and Maleficent will be back? Or whether Emma will keep her promise to help Lily find her father? —Sabrina\n\nAusiello: In a word, “No,” that Dragon (played by Tzi Ma) has nothing to do with the mystery of Lily’s father, the series cocreators confirmed for Matt Mitovich. “We had high hopes” to revisit that story in Season 6, Eddy Kitsis shared, “but we just won’t get to it.” TVLine - 12/7/16\n\nI’m bummed Once Upon a Timeabout the Once Upon a Time winter finale (airing this Sunday), because it looks like Emma and Hook won’t be together in the fairytale world. Got any good CaptainSwan scoop? —Alison\n\n“Whether Emma and Hook are together in the winter finale isn’t the question to be asking,” responds co-creator Adam Horowitz. “The real question to ask is: Will the two of them be embarking on an epic adventure filled with romance, danger and passion in the second half of the season? And the answer is… yes.” TVLine - 12/1/16\n\nPretty pretty please, something about Once Upon a Time? Particularly about Rumbelle? —Valeria\n\nAs relayed by yours truly in this week’s Facebook Live edition of “Ask Ausiello,” Onceco-creator Adam Horowitz had this to say about the piece I did juxtaposing Disney’s Beauty and the Beast trailer with the sad, sad state of their Storybrooke iterations: “The audience doesn’t know where we’re headed with Belle and Rumple, but no matter how dark things get, the show doesn’t go bleak. It’s still about hope, and it’s always darkest before the dawn.” If you are now thinking, as I am, “Gee, ‘dawn’ then must be right around the corner,” I am hearing the next episode, airing Nov. 27, is in fact quite a game changer for Rumple and/or Belle. TVLine - 11/15/16\n\nQuestion: Any hints about who’s in the hood on Once Upon a Time, killing Emma? —Courtney\n\nAusiello: Well, if you re-watch that fleeting vision very, very carefully, and take note of the hooded character’s height and build… you will glean nothing, actually. “It was a stand-in used for that scene,” and not the actual actor that will eventually be revealed as wearing the hood, Colin O’Donoghue confirms. As for whether he or any other cast members know the identity of Emma’s killer, if only becayse the Once bosses have made it pretty clear they had someone locked in from go, “We might have an idea…,” O’Donoghue teased, “but we’re not gonna tell you!” TVLine ~ 11/4/16\n\nIs Charming really going down a dark path of vengeance on Once Upon a Time? — Brett\n\nThere’s potential, but OUAT won’t pick up that story immediately. “We know he’s tempted,” EP Edward Kitsis tells me. “It’s not something that’s going to come to the forefront right away. It’s something he is clearly thinking about. I would be really disappointed if we didn’t pick it up and at least find out the answer by the end of the season.” EP Adam Horowitz concurs: “That story is not over. David has made a decision by not burning [the evidence] to pursue it. How he pursues it and when he pursues it, we’ll see as the season progresses. But he’s certainly wrestling with something, and how it impacts inversely in his relationships with Snow and his family is part of the story, as well as the ultimate answer to the mystery.” EW ~ 10/28/16\n\nIs anything coming up for Once Upon a Time‘s Snow and Charming? —Camilla\n\nAnd how! With the Evil Queen poised to make a move on the person she hates most, “the shared heart between Snow and Charming comes into play,” series co-creator Adam Horowitz teases, “as they are bonded in this new battle.”\n\nMight we see Belle’s mother again on Once Upon a Time? —Betsy\n\nI presented your Q to the show bosses, and there are “no immediate plans” to revisit that character. TVLine ~ 10/27/16\n\nQuestion: Do you have any Once Upon a Time spoilers that concern “Snowing”? —Lyss\n\nAusiello: In addition to the well-reported drama to be drummed up by the Evil Queen, Snow and David will at least attempt to get a better bead on their own “happily ever after,” now that Neverland, memory wipes and Hell are behind them. In Season 6, “They’re back in Storybrooke, trying to make a life for themselves there,” says co-creator Adam Horowitz, “so we’re trying to dig more into what daily life is, what normal is.” And as that regards the princess and prince, “In an early episode, you’re going to see Snow White ask the question, ‘What is normal? And how do we get back to it?’ That’s something that she and Charming strive toward.” TVLine ~ 9/26/2016\n\nWhat other news characters are we going to meet on Once Upon a Time besides the Count, Aladdin, Jasmine and Captain Nemo? — Jose\n\nWhen Cinderella returns in season 6, we’re going to meet her evil stepmom and stepsisters. Much like the first time she appeared on the show, Cinderella’s story will be a reflection of what’s going on with Emma. “That was Emma’s first happy ending she actually returned,” EP Edward Kitsis says. “That was the very first time that Emma, at the end of it, decided to stay in Storybrooke. She saw herself through Cinderella. Now we’re in a situation where what if someone could undo all the happiness you’ve done, would your life matter? [She’s] faced with somebody out there that’s trying to undo the ones [she has] done.” EW ~ 9/23/2016\n\nWhat’s next for Once Upon a Time‘s Hook and Emma? —Allison\n\nIn the Season 6 premiere, “We pick up pretty directly from where we left them at the end of last season, where for the first time Emma professed her love without the duress of a life-or-death situation,” co-creator Adam Horowitz reminds. “Of course, life-or-death situations come pretty quickly on our show, so that will change.” As EP Eddy Kitsis in turn notes, “No relationship is a fairytale. So if people are expecting no drama, we hope that they will enjoy what we are showing.” TVLINE ~ 9/14/2016\n\nAnything on the Regina-Emma-Snow relationship on Once Upon a Time? — Mara\n\nIt certainly won’t be easy with the Evil Queen waging war on Storybrooke. “You get to see that this really is a family that has come together,” EP Edward Kitsis says. “Henry’s dream in the beginning was to bring everyone together, and in a lot of ways he has, but this year they’re going to be tested from their past. If there’s one thing the Evil Queen hates it’s Snow White — Snow White and other people’s happiness.” EW ~ 9/16/16\n\nAnything Once Upon a Time related? If you can give me CaptainSwan info, I’ll be grateful. — Shannon\n\nThe show will be diving more into Hook’s past as his relationship with Emma moves forward. “Last year we saw Emma saying I love you to him when they weren’t in any sort of danger,” EP Adam Horowitz says. “Hook is excited to progress that relationship. At the same time, he is on his path of redemption, and we are going to see Hook doing his best to be heroic this year.” TVLine ~ 8/31/2016\n\nDo you have any scoop about Snow White and Prince Charming from Once Upon a Time? — SnowingFan\n\nWould it make you happy if I told you that the OUAT bosses say they want to see a lot of Snow and Charming this year? “Charming has always had questions about his family and his father that he thought were answered,” EP Adam Horowitz says. “Charming’s past becomes something very important to his future. We’re going to see him and Snow embarking on some adventure related to that past, and what that’s going to create for them moving forward, which is some unexpected obstacles to that happy ending they’re all trying to live.” EW ~ 9/02/2016\n\nIs there anything Adam Horowitz can tell us about Rumbelle during season 6 of Once Upon a Time? — rumbelletrueluv\n\nWhat if I let Emilie de Ravin tell you about Belle getting out of the box? “The way she is extracted, how it happens and the characters that are involved is really cool, and it reveals a lot about her relationship and her past/future,” de Ravin says, noting that the show will explore more of Belle’s independence this season. “It’s been a long time coming. Now that she’s pregnant, and now that she knows that it’s not really just about her anymore, she has to take responsibility for this other little person. That’s making her head spin a little bit with regard to, ‘Okay, I can spend my life trying to fix this person, whether it’s for me or for him, but if it’s affecting someone else now, it’s a game changer.’ It puts a little bit of spanner in the works for their marriage for a bit. There’s some alone time to be had.” EW ~ 7/29/16\n\nI’d like some Once Upon a Time spoilers please. — Jane\n\nThe introduction of the Land of Untold Stories basically opens up storytelling avenues to, well, “everyone,” according to Edward Kitsis. “What’s funny is in the pilot if you watch when Emma sees the wolf that stops her from leaving town, the book flips open and we see all these worlds,” Kitsis says. “It’s time to tell new stories, broaden the show and move forward.” As for why these stories have not yet been told, Kitsis points to something Hyde said in the finale: “As he said, I need a place where these stories can play out, which would make me think for some reason they weren’t being played out, they were pushed on pause.” EW ~ 7/8/16\n\nThanks for the Evil Queen scoop! Anything more you can share on Once Upon a Time? — Virginia\n\nThe Land of Untold Stories will provide a new avenue into the characters we’ve come to know and love over the last five seasons. “The intent is that these new characters and new stories are really a reflection on what’s going on inside of our characters,” says EP Adam Horowitz. “With Lana and the Evil Queen, that’s the starkest example, which we’ve already teased. We’re literally going inside her and pulling her apart. There are elements of that that we’re planning to do for each and everyone of the characters.” EW ~ 7/1/16\n\nDo you have any scoop on what’s going to happen to Once Upon a Time‘s Belle and Rumple? Will they be going on an adventure for the first time together? —Rebecca\n\nThey will be going on an adventure together… or as “together” as they can be with Belle still stashed inside a decorative container. “Belle is with Rumple — she’s in Pandora’s Box, in the sleeping curse,” says Once co-creator Eddy Kitsis. And as the Season 6 premiere will make clear, Rumple did get said box back, as part of his deal with Mr. Hyde. As for where the “information” Hyde delivered in return will lead the couple, “That will be the mystery that we show you,” Kitsis says. Adds co-creator Adam Horowitz: “What we really focus on at the start is: ‘How the heck does he get her out of the box and wake her?'” TVLine ~ 6/30/16\n\nWill any of the untold stories on Once Upon a Time hold a connection to any of the characters? — lennyukpirate1\n\nThat’s TBD, but the arrival of characters from the Land of Untold stories will certainly affect those in Storybrooke. “The condition of life in Storybrooke is very important,” EP Adam Horowitz says. “Hyde’s arrival impacts that. We’re planning to explore a lot of what that’s going to mean for the day-to-day life in Storybrooke.” Adds EP Edward Kitsis: “One of the things that we really want to get back to this year is that season 1 and 2 vibe of small town stories, being in Storybrooke and getting back to Mary Margaret as the teacher, Emma as the sheriff, Grumpy as the janitor.” EW - 6/24/16\n\nWhat will happen to Emma and Hook in season 6 of Once Upon a Time? — Niamh\n\nIf you recall, when Emma and Hook reunited in the finale, there was a wedding dress in the background. Ahead of the Dead of Summerpanel at ATX, I asked the guys point-blank if this means wedding bells will ring in season 6. They stayed very coy on the subject. “I would say you’ll have to watch season 6, you never know what’s going to happen,” EP Edward Kitsis replied. “You never know what’s going to happen with those two.” Fear not, they answered a few other season 6 questions, so check Spoiler Room next week for more! EW - 6/17/16\n\nAny news on Once Upon a Time season 6? — Carole\n\nAside from the fact that we’ll be getting a double dose of Regina next season, Lana Parrilla has a number of questions about season 6: “Will Baby Robin be magical?” she tells me. “Will Zelena and Regina continue to have a healthy relationship now that they’ve reconciled? Or will Regina end up hating Zelena for being the mother to Robin’s baby? I’m curious to see what’s going to end up happening in that regard. Will she end up growing resentful that she can’t have children, but yet her sister has her boyfriend’s baby? I feel like that’s a story to be told. Are they going to stand side-by-side in a sisterhood or is Regina going to grow resentful overtime?” EW - 6/10/16\n\nSeason 6 filming: July 7, 2016 to March 31, 2017\n\ncast\n\nGinnifer Goodwin as Snow White/Mary Margaret\n\nJennifer Morrison as Emma Swan\n\nLana Parrilla as Evil Queen/Regina\n\nJosh Dallas as Prince Charming/David\n\nEmilie de Ravin as Belle\n\nColin O'Donoghue as Captain Hook\n\nJared Gilmore as Henry Mills\n\nRebecca Mader as Zelena\n\nRobert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold\n\ngeneral magazines and press coverage\n\n‘Once Upon a Time’ Zeroes On Four Cast Members For Season 7 Reboot | Deadline\n\nOnce Upon a Time Shake-Up: 4 Vets in Talks to Return for Possible Season 7 | TVLine\n\n‘Once Upon A Time’: Current Narrative To Wrap At End Of Season 6; Will There Be Season 7?\n\nOnce Upon a Time: ABC boss on 'new direction' in potential season 7\n\nABC chief addresses Scandal-free fall lineup and the future of OUAT\n\nExclusive Intervew - Eduardo Castro Talks Costumes On Once Upon A Time\n\nABC 2016-17: Huge in-season hiatuses may no longer be a thing\n\nRenewed for Season 6\n\nSeason 4 DVD release date and summary\n\n2014-15 Full TV Season Ratings: Rankings For All Shows | Deadline\n\nABC's Once Upon a Time Renewed for Season 5\n\nABC Schedules Premiere, Return Dates for Once\n\nABC Fall Finale Dates Revealed\n\nconventions\n\nSan Diego Comic Con 2016 - July 21-24th\n\nArticles about the panel:\n\nComic-Con: 'Once Upon a Time' Team Teases \"Pure Evil\" Queen, \"Secrets\" About Hook's Past - THR\n\nOnce Upon a Time casts Aladdin and Jafar - EW\n\nOnce Upon a Time @ Comic-Con: Cast Talks Regina vs. Evil Queen, Emma's Potential Wedding Dress and More\n\nVideo Interviews:\n\nFull Panel - OUAT Cast\n\nRoundtable interviews - Colin/Josh, Jared/Lana, Bex/Emilie\n\nBuzzfeed interviews - Adam/Eddy, Colin/Josh, Bex/Emilie, Jared/Lana\n\nET - cast\n\nEW - Cast\n\nMTV - Cast\n\nNerdHQ - JMO\n\nTVLine - Cast\n\nE!News - cast\n\narchive SDCC 2014\n\narchive 2015 conventions: SDCC, D23, NYCC\n\nNY Comic Con 2016 - October 7th Panel\n\nArticles about the panel\n\naTVfest - February 2\n\nPanel: Part 1, Part 2\n\nVan Con Set Tour: safe for all to read!\n\n*Insert Blog Name Here* — Van Con Set Tour: safe for all to read!

(Trust us. It’s perfect.)\n\nET had the pleasure of visiting Once Upon a Time’s set in Vancouver, Canada, last month during filming of the musical matrimony, and we sat down with stars Jennifer Morrison and Colin O'Donoghue for an intimate and in-depth interview that focused on each and every aspect of their on-screen wedding.\n\nFrom their “honest” vows, to Emma’s “timeless” wedding gown, and their dream honeymoon – only ET has all the inside scoop straight from the stars of the series! Plus, we’ve got additional details from executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, as well as Once Upon a Time’s head costume designer Eduardo Castro.\n\nSo, shall we get started? Or, as O'Donoghue cleverly put it: who’s ready for some “music and dance and some mighty fine romance” at Captain Swan’s wedding?\n\nJust a warning that this is the biggest Once Upon a Time article we’ve ever written, so grab a comfy seat, put your cellphone on silent and get ready to go on an emotional roller coaster of feels. And, as always, please remember to breathe!\n\n1. The Venue: The Once showrunners confessed that they had considered a number of “other places” for Emma and Killian to tie the knot – yes, even Granny’s! – but in the end, they settled on a brand new Storybrooke location for the ceremony. “Without wanting to spoil the episode, there’s a story reason for why it’s on the roof,” Horowitz revealed. “But there’s also something to us that was super romantic about having Storybrooke as the backdrop.”\n\nEmma and Killian will tie the knot in front of a dream-worthy sunset and surrounded by their closest friends and family. “It’s the place where they’ve kind of come together,” Horowitz continued. “Where their love has grown and where both of them as characters have grown, so seeing the whole town kind of beneath and surrounding them felt like a really cool way to do it.”\n\n“I thought it was perfect,” Morrison dished. “We just felt, like, what better way to make it feel extra special than to have [the wedding] also be the musical episode?”\n\n2. The Suit: In case you missed it, we already dished a little on Killian’s dashing (and “really soft!”) suit, but did you know that black velvet wasn’t always the original plan? Once’s head costume designer, Eduardo Castro, spilled an “interesting note” about Hook’s suit to ET during an email interview.\n\n“Originally we had an ivory gabardine suit made and, somehow, it did not hit the mark,” Castro wrote. “At the very last moment, we threw out the ivory and went for a black velvet Burberry jacket that was far more in keeping with Hook’s demeanor.”\n\nKitsis furthered that he and Horowitz had a very specific vision in mind when it came to Hook’s look. “Adam and I both thought that Hook needed to have a tux that reflects his personality, so you can’t go from leather to just a basic tux,” he said. “We felt like he had to have a little edge to it, so the velvet felt like the Hook version of fancy.”\n\nWhen asked if he feels “suave” in his wedding attire, O'Donoghue was bashful with his response. “I guess so,” he chuckled. “I hope it looks OK.”\n\n“You look amazing!” Morrison chimed in while brushing a piece of lint off of O'Donoghue’s sleeve. “He’s been getting a little jealous about all of the attention the dress has been getting, so I’m trying to butter him up a little bit about his velvet jacket.”\n\n3. The Dress: Morrison, who could not stop beaming during our interview, praised her “absolutely incredible” relationship with Castro and that from “day one” he has included her in each and every fashion choice for Emma. So, naturally, the blonde beauty was an integral part in creating Emma’s wedding “vision,” and even O'Donoghue had something to add!\n\n“We had talked about it and Colin did say, ‘It should be something very vintage,’ and I was like, 'Yeah, I agree!’ Something Eddy and Adam and I had always talked about was that everything she wears should feel a little bit timeless,” Morrison explained. “So we definitely wanted to stay in the classic range with her for the wedding gown, and we felt like what better than a real fairy tale like Grace Kelly’s? She was definitely the inspiration for this.”\n\nCastro echoed Morrison’s sentiments, writing, “Jennifer and I looked at several designs, and she immediately responded to Grace Kelly’s wedding dress – originally designed by Helen Rose in 1956 nearly 60 years ago! The Grace Kelly gown addressed all the concerns that Jennifer Morrison had, so we decided to replicate it.”\n\n“Originally, the wedding was to be shot outside, therefore considerations of warmth needed to be addressed,” Castro added. There was a “time crunch” to complete the intricate Alecon Lace and ivory peau de soie gown and matching silk tulle veil and both were constructed in the Once Upon a Time workrooms over the course of two weeks. “We barely had time to fit the gown once, but it all worked out,” he said.\n\nAs for Emma’s gorgeous headpiece? Castro said that his colleague, Isabel Bloor, only had “a few days” to construct it, but it immediately became Morrison’s favorite part of the ensemble. “I want to keep this headpiece thing!” the actress declared. “I think it’s so spectacular.”\n\n4. The Rings: As we were interviewing the on-screen couple, we could not help noticing the massive sparkler on Morrison’s finger, which was freshly accompanied by a unique, slightly mismatched wedding band.\n\n“Oh yeah, that’s the ring! He’s got good taste, this one,” Morrison said while gesturing to O'Donoghue when we audibly “Ooh-ed!” mid-sentence. “You actually picked them, didn’t you?”\n\n“Mmmhmm,” O'Donoghue confirmed. “I picked the engagement ring and then they showed me this [wedding band] and I was like, 'Yeah, that’ll do.’” To which Morrison added, “They’re very inclusive with us around here. It’s really nice.”\n\nKitsis and Horowitz explained that they have always encouraged the actors to “take ownership of their characters,” and allowing them to select things like the right gowns or props is a natural extension of that. “I think our props department is awesome and I’m sure that they had some great rings,” Horowitz said. “Nobody knows the character of Hook better than Colin, so of course he’d be the one to figure out what it should be.”\n\n5. The Vows: We’re not going to get into the specifics of the vows because we want you all to experience the same, tear-filled awe that we witnessed on set. “The goal with the vows was to have the characters speak sincerely from the heart to each other, and we hope that comes across,” Horowitz said.\n\nFor the actors, both Morrison and O'Donoghue admitted that Emma and Killian’s nuptials are the perfect blend of simplicity and heart.\n\n“I can’t speak for Colin, but when I read this script, I loved the whole script,” Morrison said. “I felt like just in every single page of it, I was smiling and happy. And not just as someone on the show, but as someone who is a fan – I just loved it. I was just so happy, and part of what I liked so much about the vows was how simple and honest and direct they are.”\n\n“They weren’t over the top and they’re not convoluted in any way,” she continued. “I think Hook and Emma are two people who are very direct and they know each other so well at this point. And the fact that the writers made sure that they knew exactly what they needed and wanted to hear in that moment was very, very cool to me.”\n\n“Yeah, I felt the same way,” O'Donoghue agreed with his co-star. “I was glad that it wasn’t reams and reams of lovey-dovey stuff just for the sake of it. It was, as you said, very direct, to the point. I liked the fact that Hook doesn’t shy away from the fact that he wasn’t great at the start and he just wanted revenge. He just cuts to the chase and says Emma is the reason that he believed that he could love again. She sort of showed him what it was to be in love, so that’s what I liked about it.”\n\n6. The Reception: We already told you a little bit about the “inspiration” behind Emma and Killian’s reception song, “A Happy Beginning,” but did you know that this particular musical moment in the episode is going to send you into a complete and total frenzy? It definitely made Morrison extremely giddy…\n\n“It’s been so fun! I mean, I feel like I just keep repeating myself. It’s just so fun, it’s just so fun! You’re going to have a whole article of Jennifer said, 'It’s just so fun!’ over and over again,” she exclaimed. “We got to go to the recording studio, we got to work with a great voice coach and, for Emma, the music came from a very organic place. It wasn’t a fantasy sequence or Fairy-Tale Land where it would make sense, but it’s just been fun!”\n\nO'Donoghue added that it was great to be able to work with the composers of the musical episode, Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. “I had never sang in a way where you had to be so expressive and tell the story on top of trying to get the melody out,” he explained. “What’s great is that the songs all feel like they’ve been around for forever as part of this sort of Disney world. They really incorporated these brand new songs so well into the story of Once Upon a Time and I think that it’s fantastic.”\n\nAs for Captain Swan’s first dance as husband and wife? Prepare to be blown away by their smooth moves. “Yes, we get to dance!” Morrison said. “I mean, I wish I got to dance more. I grew up dancing, so I was wishing that there was more dancing to it.”\n\n“I didn’t grow up dancing. I guess I’m just a natural,” O'Donoghue said with a laugh.\n\n“He is a natural,” Morrison confirmed, “but we also have to deal with the fact that he only has one hand!” O'Donoghue added that learning the choreography has been a bit of a “complicated” process when it comes to the “lifts and stuff,” but the two actors are used to the one-handed challenges.\n\n“You have to move the dance balance around differently and, obviously, we don’t want to, like, have any injuries with the hook. We’ve gotten really good at working around that hook though,” Morrison explained with a giggle. “Wait – That sounded wrong. I didn’t mean it the way that sounded!”\n\n“You just said that in an interview,” O'Donoghue taunted.\n\n“I didn’t mean to!” Morrison protested through a fit of laughs. “Aw, man!”\n\n(Writer’s Note: When we offered to strike that part of the interview from the record, O'Donoghue was quick to playfully back up his co-star’s words. “No, no, no! You can keep it in.”)\n\n7. The Honeymoon: Once again, we’re not going to spoil the episode’s events for you, but when the musical hour ends, and we prepare for “The Final Battle” ahead, it’s clear that newlywed bliss may not immediately be in the cards for our couple.\n\nSo what do the actors think Emma and Killian’s “dream honeymoon” would be? “Five minutes alone probably,” O'Donoghue chuckled.\n\n“Yeah, exactly!” Morrison smiled. “Just somewhere with a door locked. I think just a couple bottles of wine and some french fries and a bath, maybe?”\n\n“Oh really, what else?” O'Donoghue pressed.\n\n“I don’t know!” she answered playfully. “I just feel like it should be really relaxing because their lives are very stressful because they’re always trying to save people and I feel like a romantic bath might be nice.”\n\n“Well, there you go!” O'Donoghue said as he and Morrison burst into laughter.\n\nOnce Upon a Time's musical episode, \"A Song in Your Heart\" airs Sunday, May 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The 7 Biggest Secrets From Hook & Emma's 'Once Upon a Time' Wedding: Vows, Honeymoon & Much More!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNuQhNwYEFQ\n\n__________________\n\n\"Our story began on the beanstalk\" ♥ \"We fought for our love, and we won\"\n\n\"But one thing is for sure, love...with you, i have everything...\n\na happy beginning now is ours\" ♥"
