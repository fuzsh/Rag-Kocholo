        "text": "On Begley Street is a new webseries from Ed & Rachelle Begley, and you're invited.\n\n\"On Begley Street” is a Web series that explores the building of North America’s greenest, most sustainable home. We will follow Ed Begley, Jr. (noted actor and environmentalist) and his wife Rachelle Carson-Begley as they attempt to build their home under LEED Platinum Certified standards. Each episode explores sustainable living and balancing comfort with consumption. Their adventures are often heightened by the Begley’s numerous and comical mistakes which often result in playful bickering between the married couple. And keep an eye open as Ed and Rachelle's high profile friends stop by for a visit and are then coerced into an afternoon of hard labor. Of course, there's lots of how-to information for the D-I-Y-er but it's about living sustainably as much as building sustainably. Mostly, it’s about the Begleys and their 11-year-old daughter, Hayden, as they struggle to do the right thing for the environment, themselves, and the future.\n\nAlthough the show will often be laugh-out-loud funny, “On Begley Street” will also be illuminating, quirky, informative, playful... and very Begley. Join Team Begley and become a part of their mission to build a better future for planet Earth."
