        "text": "ABC’s Once Upon a Time parted ways with a fan favorite series regular during Sunday’s penultimate episode of season five.\n\nAfter promoting a major death in the episode, the ABC fairy tale drama delivered when Sean Maguire’s Robin Hood met his demise and was honored with a heartbreaking funeral that ended with his daughter being named in his honor.\n\nDuring the hour, Regina (Lana Parilla) and Robin teamed in an effort to get his daughter back from Zelena (Rebecca Mader) and Hades (Greg Germann). As they agreed on a game plan, the couple shared a tender moment: “You are my future,” Robin tells Regina halfway through the episode in what was clearly foreshadowing. “I’m with you, always,” she responds, setting herself up for yet another loss.\n\nAs the confrontation arrives, Hades points his Olympian crystal at Regina, only Robin steps in front of her — in an epic display of true love — and dies right before her eyes. Torn between her lover and her sister, Zelena then realized that Hades didn’t have her best interest at heart and winds up killing him.\n\nHere, Maguire talks with THR about saying farewell to Storybrooke.\n\nRead more here: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/once-a-time-robin-dies-892027\n\nAre you happy with the way Robin’s journey ended?\n\nIn all honestly, no, I wouldn’t say that I was. I felt like it was an abrupt end; I didn’t feel the character had any development this year and wasn’t really written for. That was disappointing for people who liked Robin Hood and liked him and Regina together. But I’m a company man and when you’re an actor, you have to understand that our job is to serve the writing. I write myself and I understand how important it is to be true to what the writer’s vision is. In all honestly, I don’t feel that a character like Robin Hood got the development that he could have had. But I respect the way the guys want to run their show. You either have to be on board or not. I’m happy to serve the writers.\n\nJust tell the truth Sean….that’s the best thing to do! Michael Socha had the same issues with Adam and Eddy, and the mere fact actors are coming forth voicing their true opinions now about this show and it’s runners should be a forewarning to anyone before they hitch onto this bandwagon.\n\nAs a writer, what do you hope happens next for Regina?\n\nAs a writer, you hope the Regina character stays good and stays a hero and doesn’t let this tragedy turn her back to a dark place. But as a viewer of the show, maybe Regina going dark and being evil again gives them their Evil Queen back — she’s an iconic character on the show and to be honest with you, I leave the speculation to the fans and the writing to the writers.\n\nI get the oddest feeling that he has to say he hopes Regina stays good, but deep down, he really wants her to go postal on Storybrooke! That’s a wish flooding twitter right now, everyone wants the Evil Queen to set it off.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nI’m taking some time off to be a dad. There’s a couple projects on the horizon I’m excited about. They’re very different options and trajectories. We’re talking about where it’s best for me to go. I have the luxury of time to make the choice and absorb everything that’s happened and reflect on how great the fans have been to me. I’m always going to be grateful to them for their passion and dedication.\n\nJust do you and be happy Sean! Michael Raymond James left this crap too, and is on a roll! Follow his lead!\n\n\"If you go as far as you can see...you will then see enough to go even further.\" - Finn Balor\n\nReading these interviews, it makes me wonder: how do the writers live with themselves after doing this?\n\nI mean, seriously? I would feel terrible with myself as a writer if, after promoting an actor to series regular and him moving his family over, seemingly secure in his job, I give him no development/centrics and just flat out murder him. And it’s not even just murder – he was wiped from existence! No afterlife or anything!\n\nYou want to service all your characters, of course. But the position of series regular isn’t just an average position – you’re a main character! How do these writers live with themselves when they’ve done it four times now?! Meghan Ory, MRJ, Michael Socha, and now Sean – four talented actors that have come out and said that their stories were ended abruptly/weren’t properly developed.\n\nIf I was writing for these people and responsible for their lack of development, I wouldn’t be angry at their words; that wouldn’t be right. I’d be ashamed with myself as a writer, wondering how I allowed myself to give these actors false hope in both character development and job security.\n\nKeeper of Thor’s Hammer, Will Scarlet’s Genie Bottle, Emma’s Gun, Emma and Henry’s Moment at the Castle, Cora, and the infamous Family Tree!\n\nIt’s tough becasue I get you have an idea, and sometimes that changes. They obviously had something different planned for Robin Hook, otherwise he wouldn’t have been a series regular. But the problem is, as RG said, it’s become a pattern. They can’t plan out an entire season anymore without changing it. They supposedly sit in a room and plan it out over the summer, and yet the last few years, really since season 2, things have abruptly changed throughout the season. So i get it, the story changes and it isn’t what you thought it would be in the beginning of the season. But it can’t happen literally every season. That’s shoddy writing. These writers got so popular from Lost, but I never felt there was a single season in Lost that did this. Just shows how minor players they were on that show."
