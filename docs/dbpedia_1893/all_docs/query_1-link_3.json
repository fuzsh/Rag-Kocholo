        "text": "THIS POST MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR AN EPISODE OF SEASON 3 \"ONCE UPON A TIME\". Do not read the blog post if you want to avoid those minor spoilers. The photos contain no notable spoiler.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nlast warning\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSeason 3 of the ABC fantasy drama \"Once Upon A Time\" has rarely been seen around this year by the locals. With most of their production now in studio for the Neverland scenes, finding the cast on location has proved to be a challenge for most.\n\nSo no shock, yesterday was my 1st venture to a OUAT set this season. It was in New Westminster at the house used for Regina.\n\nThis particular set of scenes involved Dr. Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) & a guest star who I cant name...because no one knows the name outside of the crew.\n\nI know what the scenes entailed somewhat, but cant go into too much detail. Just to say, it is a flashback scene involving the pair & baby Henry.\n\nThere was nothing to see of the actual filming, unless you were there bright & early when they did a short scene of Archie walking to/away from the front door. The rest was all interior.\n\nWe did however catch up to both stars outside. Raphael, on his lunch break, stopped to sign for the 7-10 fans that were there before heading back inside to do more work. Lana, after her filming concluded around 7 PM met all the fans, which by then was close to a dozen, and signed autographs & took photos.\n\nBelow is a few photos from last night.\n\nI will have a few more photos of non-location OUAT interactions to post soon. Included in there will be some Jennifer Morrison pics from recently, and some leftover forgotten about pics from last season of Jamie Chung (Mulan) & Sarah Bolger (Princess Aurora) & a few from a friend who was at this past summers San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nOnce Upon A Time season 3 is currently airing Sunday nights on ABC & CTV."
