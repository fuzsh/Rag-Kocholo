        "text": "Note: Full spoilers for the episode follow.\n\nIt's time to dive into more Once Upon a Time backstory, and this time the focus is Jiminy Cricket (Raphael Sbarge). In Storybrooke, he's Dr. Archie Hopper, a timid psychologist trying to help Henry. In the fairytale world, he was a boy trapped into a life he didn't want by his thieving parents. He didn't know how to break free from them, just as he doesn't know how to get out from under Regina's influence in the real world.\n\nJiminy turned to Rumpelstiltskin in the fairytale realm to escape his parents. His plan backfired, and his actions had severe consequences. He wished for change, and the Blue Fairy showed up. She could only offer him the choice of becoming a cricket. It's not a huge surprise that he agreed to it since the sound of the crickets always cheered him. I mean, why not become an insect? Goofy as it sounds, it actually worked. However, I think the interpretation of the Blue Fairy was misguided. She looked more like she was wearing a \"sexy\" Halloween costume than anything else. It detracted from the moment.\n\nAs Dr. Hopper deals with Regina, you can see the parallels between this life and his past one. Of course he caves at any pressure from Regina. He's trying to find his place and courage, and well, Regina's scary. I don't blame him. With his hand forced, he tells Henry that his ideas are psychotic. This upsets Henry enough to drive him to search for proof of the fairytale realm in the recently collapsed mine (that happened as soon as Emma pinned on her deputy badge).\n\nYou can guess what happens next. The mine is unstable, and Henry gets trapped inside. Dr. Hopper finds some courage and runs in and becomes trapped with him. I've never liked Henry as much as I did in this episode. He pushes the doctor in the right direction, via a sweet conversation about why Henry thinks the doctor is Jiminy Cricket. And Sbarge played the pain and sweetness of Hopper/Jiminy Cricket to perfection.\n\nWith the help of the Dalmatian Pongo (yep), the rescue crew finds a way into the mine. Emma pulls out Henry and Dr. Hopper. I was surprised and relieved to see that Regina actually showed genuine concern and love for Henry. So often, she treats Henry as a thorn in her side. I like seeing that she isn't entirely evil, just vicious and cruel. She displays that yet again when Dr. Hopper fights back and puts her in his place.\n\nJiminy Cricket wins the prize for the most touching backstory so far on Once Upon a Time. The transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far. I'd even use the word magical. It was a delight to watch him find his feet. Additionally, there seems to be some movement towards breaking the spell on Storybrooke. Emma's presence is finally causing visible changes. It's not clear what's hidden in the mines, but it's something from the fairytale world and progress was overdue."
