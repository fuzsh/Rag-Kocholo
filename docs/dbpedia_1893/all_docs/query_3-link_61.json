        "text": "Once Upon a Time's Jiminy Cricket is hopping from Storybrooke to New York.\n\nRaphael Sbarge, who plays the iconic character on the ABC fantasy drama, has booked a two-episode arc on Necessary Roughness, TVGuide.com has learned exclusively.\n\nScoop on Once Upon a Time and more must-watch finales\n\nSbarge will play Carl Webber, a high-level employee at V3, the sports and entertainment management company headed by Connor McClane (recurring guest star John Stamos). Carl seeks Dani's (Callie Thorne) counsel after a traumatic incident. The gig reunites Sbarge with fellow Once Upon a Time actor David Anders, who will recur as Connor's second-in-command.\n\nFantastic Four star Ioan Gruffudd will also pop up this season as Nolan Powers, a successful self-help guru embarking on a book tour. Nolan despises anything have to do with therapy which - surprise! - doesn't sit well with Dani. Gruffudd starred on last year's short-lived CW drama Ringer, and most recently appeared on Castle.\n\nNecessary Roughness' third season premieres on Wednesday, June 12 at 10/9c on USA. Are you excited to see Sbarge and Gruffudd log some couch time with Dr. D?\n\nView original Exclusive: Necessary Roughness Recruits Once Upon a Time, Ringer Vets at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
