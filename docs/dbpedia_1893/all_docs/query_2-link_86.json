Over the show's seven seasons, storylines got a bit complicated with convoluted timelines, confusing character connections, and a huge departure of much of the original cast.\n\nRegardless, the show didn't lose its spark. We've rounded up all 83 characters that appeared in both the show and Disney animated movies for a full comparison. Clearly, Captain Hook was as conventionally handsome as his live action counterpart.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nKeep scrolling to see how \"Once Upon a Time\" either drastically changed or remained pretty faithful to your favorite animated characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGinnifer Goodwin fulfilled her dreams of playing a Disney princess when she took over the mantle of Snow White.\n\nSnow White has the distinct honor of being the first princess ever as the star of 1937's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" During the course of the movie, she is almost murdered by her step-mother's servant, is forced to flee into the woods and shack up with seven dwarfs she's never met, is cursed into a magical coma, and is eventually rescued via the kiss of a man she barely knows.\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Time\" incarnation of Snow White has way more autonomy, and is generally a badass. She's great with a bow and arrow, frequently rescues herself instead of waiting on other people, and survives as an outlaw for years. And she eventually gets the guy and the crown. Snow is truly an icon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh Dallas is David, aka Prince Charming from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nThe Prince in 1937's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" doesn't do much beyond waking Snow White up from her enchanted slumber. He barely has any lines!\n\nAnd this is exactly the opposite of David, one of the main characters in the first six seasons of \"Once Upon a Time.\" Nicknamed \"Charming\" by Snow White during one of their first encounters, David falls in love with Snow and wakes her from a sleeping curse with true love's kiss, just like in the movie, but the two go on to have many more adventures, and even have two kids: Emma Swan and Neal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLana Parrilla stars as the Evil Queen, also known as Regina, the villain of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nIn \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" the Queen is really just vain — she wants to kill her step-daughter Snow White because she's worried that one day, she'll become more beautiful than the Queen.\n\nIn the show, the Evil Queen has a slightly better reason for wanting Snow White out of the way: Snow ruined her chance at happiness with her boyfriend, Daniel. Daniel was a stable boy and their relationship was secret. Snow mistakenly told the Queen's mother, Cora, about Daniel, and she subsequently killed Daniel, causing the Queen to vow revenge on Snow.\n\nThe Evil Queen's rage is what begins the story — she casts an evil curse on the entire fairytale land, which transports them to Storybrooke, Maine, where the first season begins. She eventually becomes a hero, reconciles with Snow, and falls in love with Robin Hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee Arenberg appears as Grumpy, one of the seven dwarfs from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nThe dwarfs are a big part of the original \"Snow White.\" They become Snow's friends, and stand vigil at her side once she is poisoned by the Evil Queen.\n\nAll seven of the dwarfs appear in \"Once Upon a Time,\" but Grumpy becomes the most important. He appears the most and even gets his own love story with a fairy, Nova, in the season one episode \"Dreamy.\" It's also revealed that Grumpy used to be called Dreamy, but his name changed once his dream of being with Nova was dashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rest of the dwarfs from \"Snow White\" also appear in \"Once Upon a Time,\" with varying degrees of importance.\n\nBesides Grumpy, the other dwarfs are Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful, and their leader, Doc. In the show, the dwarfs are mainly background players, frequently used in the plans of the main characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Dornan appears throughout season one as the Huntsman from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nIn the classic \"Snow White,\" the Evil Queen sends the Huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her Snow's heart. The Huntsman, however, cannot go through with it, and tricks the Queen by bringing her an animal heart.\n\nDuring season one of \"Once Upon a Time,\" all the fairytale characters are cursed to forget who they are. Sheriff Graham Humbert is the real-world counterpart of the Huntsman, used for the same task in the show.\n\nIn Storybrooke, Graham is the first person to remember who he really is. Alas, the Evil Queen (posing as Regina) murders him before he can convince anyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Genie from \"Aladdin\" is played by Giancarlo Esposito in a season one episode.\n\nIn the 1992 film \"Aladdin,\" the Genie helps Aladdin win over Jasmine's heart by granting him three wishes, the latter eventually setting the Genie free.\n\nIn the show, the Genie is still imprisoned inside his lamp, and is discovered by King Leopold, Snow White's father and the Evil Queen's husband. Leopold sets the Genie free with his first wish, and gives the Genie a wish of his own.\n\nThe Genie eventually meets the Evil Queen and falls in love with her, and she tricks him into murdering Leopold. Once the Genie discovers that she was only using him, he uses his third wish to remain by her side and watch her forever, transforming him into another fairytale character ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Genie, played by Giancarlo Esposito, turns into the Magic Mirror from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" which he continues to appear as through season six.\n\nThe Evil Queen in 1937's \"Snow White\" uses the Magic Mirror to tell her if she's the \"fairest of them all.\" It warns her when she is in danger of being usurped by Snow White.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" the Magic Mirror is the imprisoned spirit of the Genie from \"Aladdin,\" who is in love with the Evil Queen. As the Mirror, he is frequently used by the Evil Queen to spy on her enemies and provide her with magical counsel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Carlyle plays Rumpelstiltskin, who doesn't have a direct Disney movie counterpart. His character, however, contains components of both the Beast from \"Beauty and the Beast\" and the crocodile from \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nRumpelstiltskin's \"Once Upon a Time\" story combines several Disney classics. First, having lost his humanity and become a dark and powerful magical entity, he takes the place of Captain Hook's eternal enemy, the crocodile, from 1953's \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nIn \"Once,\" the two are entwined in a love triangle in which Rumpelstiltskin ultimately kills Hook's lover — who was also Rumpelstiltskin's wife. In the show, Rumpelstiltskin also represents the beast from 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" trapping Belle himself and ultimately falling in love with her and becoming human once again.\n\nEmilie de Ravin portrays Belle of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" She falls in love with Rumpelstiltskin, making him the beast of her story.\n\nBelle, the beauty of 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" remained very similar when her character moved from the movie screen to our TVs. She's still obsessed with books, sees the good in people (like the Beast/Rumpelstiltskin), and lets herself be taken captive in order to save her father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric Keenleyside portrays Maurice, Belle's father from \"Beauty and the Beast,\" beginning in season one.\n\nIn 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Belle's father, Maurice, is a poor inventor seen as kooky (even crazy) by local townsfolk. He is caught trespassing by the Beast, but is rescued by Belle who takes his place as the Beast's captive.\n\nInstead of a poor inventor, in the show's universe, Maurice actually rules over an entire kingdom, though his kingdom is impoverished and in danger of being attacked by ogres. He sets up the betrothal of his daughter Belle to Gaston. Before they can marry, Rumpelstiltskin appears and tells the group that he can keep them safe from ogres if Belle becomes his servant for life.\n\nAlthough Maurice balks, Belle agrees to the terms, which leads to Belle and Rumpelstiltskin falling in love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeegan Connor Tracy pops up throughout the show as its resident Blue Fairy from \"Pinocchio.\"\n\nThe Blue Fairy, the benevolent fairy in 1940's \"Pinocchio,\" appears in 35 episodes of \"Once Upon a Time,\" scattered over seven years.\n\nIn \"Pinocchio,\" the Blue Fairy transforms Pinocchio from a wooden puppet into a live puppet, and eventually into a real boy once he proves he deserves it. In \"Once,\" she does the same, and also acts as a magical helper throughout the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Amendola and Jakob Davies play Gepetto and Pinocchio, respectively, from \"Pinocchio\" beginning in season one.\n\nIn 1940's \"Pinocchio,\" Gepetto is a lonely woodworker, who makes a wish on a star that his wooden puppet would become a real boy — and the Blue Fairy grants his wish. Pinocchio becomes a live puppet, but he makes some truly terrible decisions and ends up on a magical island where boys turn into donkeys. Gepetto is forced to sail out to the island, where he gets eaten by a whale. Pinocchio ends up selflessly sacrificing himself for his dad, which leads to the Blue Fairy turning him into a real boy.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" Pinocchio is transformed from a puppet to a living puppet when Gepetto carves him out of wood from an enchanted tree. The Blue Fairy eventually turns Pinocchio into a real boy, and he is sent away from the Enchanted Forest with Emma Swan when they are both kids in order to escape a curse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJiminy Cricket from \"Pinocchio\" appears as both his cricket self and as a human, where he's played by Raphael Sbarge.\n\nJiminy Cricket acts as Pinocchio's conscience in 1940's \"Pinocchio.\" He attempts to stop him from engaging in potentially amoral activities, like drinking, smoking, gambling, and vandalism, to varying degrees of success.\n\nDuring the very first curse of \"Once Upon a Time,\" Jiminy Cricket becomes Storybrooke's psychiatrist, named Archie Hopper (Sbarge).\n\nBut in flashbacks to their time in the Enchanted Forest, it's shown that Jiminy Cricket was once a real cricket — he becomes a cricket in order to atone for the sins of his parents. They used magic to turn two parents into wooden puppets, orphaning a small boy named Gepetto. Jiminy asks the Blue Fairy to help him, so she transforms Jiminy into a cricket, and he vows to stick by Gepetto's side, and he does as Gepetto grows up and carves himself a puppet named Pinocchio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo different versions of Cinderella, from \"Cinderella,\" appear in \"Once Upon a Time.\" The first is played by Jessy Schram, and the second by Dania Ramirez.\n\n\"Cinderella,\" which was released in 1950, is about an orphaned girl who is forced to work for her evil stepmother and step-sisters, until she meets her fairy godmother, who helps her meet her future husband Prince Charming.\n\nThe first \"Once Upon a Time\" Cinderella debuts in the show's fourth-ever episode. It picks up with her story after the events of \"Cinderella,\" when she's married with a baby on the way with her handsome prince, named Prince Thomas.\n\nThe second Cinderella is a main character in the show's revamped seventh season. She eventually becomes the wife of Henry Mills, one of the show's original main characters. She has a similar back story to the original Cinderella, except her step-family isn't totally evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Phillipps is the handsome prince from \"Cinderella,\" though in the show he gets a real name — Prince Thomas.\n\nIn 1950's \"Cinderella,\" the prince doesn't have a whole lot to do — he falls in love with Cinderella on sight, and when she flees the ball in order to get back home before her carriage turns into a pumpkin, he decrees that every woman in the kingdom must try on the glass slipper Cinderella left behind.\n\nDuring season one of \"Once Upon a Time,\" it's revealed that the two did in fact live happily ever after, and even have a daughter, Alexandra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine Lough Haggquist plays the Fairy Godmother from \"Cinderella\" in a season one episode.\n\nIn the 1950 movie \"Cinderella,\" the Fairy Godmother plays a pivotal role — she is the one who transforms Cinderella into a beautiful princess, and gives her her famed glass slippers. She also sings one of the most iconic songs in the Disney canon, \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.\"\n\nIn the season one episode \"The Price of Gold,\" the Fairy Godmother appears to Cinderella in much the same way. But right before she's about to cast the spell, Rumpelstiltskin appears and sets her on fire to steal her magic wand. Although she doesn't play a major role, her horrifying death signaled to viewers that Rumpelstiltskin was not messing around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeverley Elliott plays Granny Lucas, who appears briefly in the Disney short \"The Big Bad Wolf,\" which is based upon the fairytale \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n\n\"The Big Bad Wolf\" was released in 1934 as part of the series of shorts by Disney called \"Silly Symphonies.\" The story combines Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs, by having the pigs warn Little Red Riding Hood about their adversary, the Big Bad Wolf who had blown their houses down. He later impersonates Little Red's grandmother.\n\nDuring \"Once Upon a Time,\" Granny Lucas appears throughout the show's seven seasons, along with her granddaughter Red (aka Little Red Riding Hood). She owns the main restaurant and inn in Storybrooke that is frequented by the main characters. In the fairytale realm of the show, Granny is also revealed to be a werewolf — making her one of the Big Bad Wolves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood from \"The Big Bad Wolf\" also appears in the show, played by Meghan Ory.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood appears in the 1934 short \"The Big Bad Wolf,\" in which she is tricked into using a shortcut that puts her right into the clutches of the wolf. She is able to evade capture, and ends up rescuing Granny from the wolf as well.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" Red is a teenager who lives with her grandma, known as Granny. It is eventually revealed to her that she is, in fact, a werewolf. She wears her famous red cloak as a way to magically prevent herself from transforming during the full moon.\n\nRed appears throughout the first three seasons, and disappears during season four. However, she returns in season five with her true love — Dorothy Gale, of \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Zahara appears in two episodes as King Midas, of the Greek legend, who was also brought to life in a Disney short called \"The Golden Touch.\"\n\nIn the 1935 short \"The Golden Touch,\" King Midas is given the magical powers to turn everything he touches into gold. While at first everything seems great, Midas soon realizes he can't eat or drink anything without turning it to gold, and begs for a reversal. The elf who gave him the power takes it back, along with his castle, his riches, and his clothes.\n\nIn the season one episode, \"The Shepherd,\" this King Midas still has his powers, though they are limited to just his right hand, and he wears special gloves to prevent himself from turning things into gold accidentally — which he does, by turning his daughter Abigail's true love Frederick into a golden statue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSebastian Stan plays the Mad Hatter from \"Alice in Wonderland\" throughout the show's first and second seasons.\n\nIn 1951's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" the Mad Hatter is, well, mad. He is part of the \"unbirthday\" party that Alice happens upon during her journey through Wonderland, and appears to be friends with the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat, and the Dormouse.\n\nThe Mad Hatter is known as Jefferson in \"Once Upon a Time.\" He creates hats that double as portals, which allow him to jump between realms, like Storybrooke, Wonderland, and the Enchanted Forest (his home).\n\nJefferson is one of the few who remembers his time in the Enchanted Forest while Storybrooke is still cursed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbara Hershey plays Cora Mills, also known as the Queen of Hearts from \"Alice in Wonderland.\" She makes her first appearance in season one.\n\nThe Queen of Hearts is the memorable villain of the 1951 adaptation of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" She's probably best remembered as the unhinged lady who screams \"Off with their head!\" at pretty much anyone who annoys her.\n\nCora, the \"Once Upon a Time\" iteration of the Queen of Hearts, starts out in the legend of Rumpelstiltskin, as a woman who claims she can spin straw into gold, and trades her first-born child to Rumpelstiltskin in return for teaching her the skill.\n\nWhen she grows up, she eventually gives birth to Regina, who grows up to become the Evil Queen. Regina, sick of her mother's meddling ways after Cora murders her boyfriend Daniel, banishes Cora to Wonderland by trapping her inside a looking glass. Cora works her way up in Wonderland and becomes the Queen of Hearts, ruling over all of Wonderland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristin Bauer van Straten is first introduced as Maleficent, the villain of \"Sleeping Beauty,\" in season one. She appears throughout the first four seasons.\n\nIn the 1959 movie \"Sleeping Beauty,\" Maleficent is the antagonist — she's an evil fairy that casts the curse on Princess Aurora. If Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle, she'll fall into a deep sleep. She eventually turns into a dragon, and is killed by Prince Phillip.\n\nMaleficent is introduced in the show's second-ever episode, after she has already been beat by Aurora and Phillip — and Aurora's parents, Briar Rose and Stefan, who awoke his wife from a sleeping curse as well. She is set up as the Evil Queen's only friend, and she is the one who is holding on to the dark curse that sends all the characters to Storybrooke in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Anders plays Victor Frankenstein — a version of whom is also brought to life in \"Frankenweenie.\"\n\n\"Frankenweenie,\" the 2012 Tim Burton movie based on Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein,\" tells the story of a young Victor Frankenstein, who uses science to revive his dead dog Sparky.\n\nThe Victor Frankenstein that appears in \"Once Upon a Time\" is more closely related to the novel. He attempts to revive his brother Gerhardt, who dies because of Victor — making the Frankenstein's monster in this universe Victor's brother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPongo, the dalmatian from \"101 Dalmatians\" appears as more of an Easter egg than anything else — he's owned by the human version of Jiminy Cricket.\n\nIn \"101 Dalmatians,\" Pongo is the biological and adoptive father of the titular dalmatians.\n\nEagle-eared viewers of \"Once Upon a Time\" were delighted when Archie's (aka Jiminy Cricket) dog was revealed to be named Pongo, as a nod to the Disney lovers watching the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin O'Donoghue stars as a decidedly more handsome Captain Hook, the villain of \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nThe Captain Hook of 1953's \"Peter Pan\" is one dimensional — his only objective appears to be defeating Peter Pan, the leader of the Lost Boys who never grows up. Hook is just the bad guy.\n\nHook starts out as a bad guy in season two of \"Once Upon a Time\" as well, but over the course of the show, his arc puts him on a path to heroism and he falls in love with the show's main character Emma Swan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Gauthier plays Captain Hook's bumbling sidekick Smee from \"Peter Pan.\" He debuts during season two.\n\nIn the 1953 movie \"Peter Pan,\" the villainous Captain Hook's sidekick is none other than Mr. Smee. He's involved with Hook's scheme to capture Tiger Lily to force her to tell them of Peter's whereabouts.\n\nDuring \"Once Upon a Time\"'s second season, it's revealed that Smee joined up with Captain Hook after his dreams of immortality were dashed by Rumpelstiltskin. In return for helping Hook out of a jam, Hook transports Smee, along with the rest of his crew, to Neverland where they will never age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreya Tingley makes her first appearance as Wendy Darling from \"Peter Pan\" in season two.\n\nWendy is the true protagonist of 1953's \"Peter Pan.\" We see Neverland, Peter Pan, his Lost Boys, and magic through her eyes, as she attempts to return home with her two younger brothers, John and Michael.\n\nIn the \"Once Upon a Time\" re-imagining of the story of Peter Pan, he's evil, and has taken Wendy prisoner. He forces her to live in a cage, and makes her two younger brothers work for him for over 100 years to keep Wendy safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristie Laing plays the human version of Maid Marian from \"Robin Hood.\"\n\nIn the 1973 film \"Robin Hood,\" in which all the characters are animals, Marian is a fox. She is the love interest of Robin, and the niece of King Richard. Throughout the course of the movie, Marian and Robin reconnect after losing touch when they were kids, and fall in love.\n\nMarian and Robin also fell in love before the events of \"Once Upon a Time,\" and have a son together named Roland. In the original timeline, Marian becomes an outlaw with her husband, but she is eventually captured and executed.\n\nIn the new timeline created by Emma and Captain Hook when they are sent to the past, they save Marian and bring her to the future where she is reunited with Robin — who is currently involved with the reformed Evil Queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWil Traval plays the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham from \"Robin Hood\" from seasons two through six.\n\nThe Sheriff of Nottingham in 1973's \"Robin Hood\" is depicted as a wolf, a typically evil animal throughout Disney movies — and this wolf is no different. He delights in over-taxing the poorest citizens of Nottingham, and is frequently outwitted by Robin Hood and Little John.\n\nThe Sheriff of Nottingham from \"Once Upon a Time\" has more of a reason to hate Robin — he was in love with Robin's wife, Marian, and was angry that he \"stole\" her from him. The Sheriff dedicates the rest of his time in the Enchanted Forest to getting revenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Chung is the first live-action incarnation of Mulan from \"Mulan.\" She debuted in the show's second season.\n\nIn the 1998 movie \"Mulan,\" Mulan defies her parents (and laws) in order to take her father's place in the Imperial Army of China — to do so, she disguises herself as a man named Ping. She ends up becoming a fierce warrior, and saves the Emperor and the rest of China from the Huns.\n\nWhen Mulan pops up in the season two premiere of \"Once Upon a Time,\" it's unclear if the events of the movie have taken place — she ends up being the only character from the movie to appear on \"Once.\" She is, however, still a powerful warrior.\n\nThroughout the show, Mulan meets many heroes, from Belle to Merida to Aurora — the last of which she eventually falls in love with, though her feelings aren't reciprocated. Aurora's pregnancy leads to Mulan joining Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah Bolger plays Princess Aurora, the sleepy star of \"Sleeping Beauty,\" beginning in season two.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty,\" the 1959 film about a princess who is cursed to prick her finger on a spindle, is one of the most iconic Disney films. The titular sleeping beauty, Princess Aurora, is eventually awoken by Prince Phillip after being cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent.\n\nAurora also falls victim to a sleeping curse in \"Once Upon a Time,\" and is again saved by Phillip. Unfortunately, he gets his soul sucked out by a wraith (an evil spirit), and has to be saved by Aurora and her best friend Mulan.\n\nEventually, the two reunite and have a baby, much to the dismay of Mulan who was secretly harboring feelings for Aurora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulian Morris plays Prince Phillip from \"Sleeping Beauty\" starting in season two.\n\nIn the 1959 classic \"Sleeping Beauty,\" Prince Phillip is the handsome prince who wakes Princess Aurora up from her enchanted slumber, after he slays the dragon version of Maleficent.\n\nPhillip's story in \"Once Upon a Time\" picks up after he and Aurora have defeated Maleficent. He begins as an enchanted beast called the Yaoguai, and while still enchanted, meets Mulan who transforms him back to his human form. He later gets his soul sucked out by a wraith, but Aurora and Mulan team up to rescue him again.\n\nPhillip eventually reunites with Aurora, and they have a child together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe titular little mermaid Ariel from \"The Little Mermaid\" is played by JoAnna Garcia Swisher, beginning in season three.\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Time\" interpretation of Ariel was mainly based upon the 1989 Disney film \"The Little Mermaid,\" in which a mermaid named Ariel falls in love with a human, Prince Eric, and vows to do anything to win his affection.\n\nThis version of Ariel has the same motives — she's a mermaid, and loves Eric, though instead of falling afoul of the sea witch Ursula, she makes an enemy of the Evil Queen, one of the show's main characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGil McKinney plays Prince Eric from \"The Little Mermaid\" starting in season three.\n\nFrequently cited as the dreamiest prince in the Disney canon, Prince Eric appears in 1989's \"The Little Mermaid\" as the object of the little mermaid Ariel's affection. The two fall in love and team up to take down the evil sea witch Ursula, and live happily ever after.\n\nEric's arc on \"Once Upon a Time\" is essentially the same. Him and Ariel do live happily ever after, but this time on an island far, far away where they aren't impacted by any of the curses that plague the main characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie Kay plays the villainous Peter Pan, an evil re-imagination of the beloved character from \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nThe 1953 film \"Peter Pan\" is all about the adventures of Peter himself, a boy who never grows up that lives in Neverland. While he can be mean and childish, he still saves the day by defeating Captain Hook and returning the Darling children to their rightful home in London.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" Peter Pan is a truly evil figure. He became Peter Pan after he, as an adult, abandoned his son Rumpelstiltskin in order to travel to Neverland and become a child again, which works — but with a price. Peter is the main villain of season three, and successfully captures his great-grandson, Henry, and attempts to crush his heart in order to maintain his youth.\n\nThankfully, his son Rumpelstiltskin stabs him before he can accomplish this task.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose McIver plays the most iconic fairy ever, Tinker Bell, from \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nTinker Bell is one of Peter's closest friends in the 1953 movie \"Peter Pan.\" She also gets exceedingly jealous when she thinks that Wendy is replacing her, and actually gets Wendy and her brothers captured out of pettiness. But she quickly realizes the error of her ways, and helps rescue them with the help of her pixie dust.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" before Tinker Bell heads to Neverland, she meets Evil Queen Regina, and attempts to help her believe in love again by showing her her soul-mate — who ends up being Robin Hood — but Regina isn't ready to hear it.\n\nDue to stealing pixie dust for Regina, Tinker Bell has her wings stripped and is forced to go to Neverland, where she becomes an ally of Peter Pan — though she quickly changes sides once she realizes how terrible he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt Kane plays the grown-up, hipster version of John Darling from \"Peter Pan\" in season three.\n\nIn \"Peter Pan,\" released in 1953, John is one of Wendy's younger brothers who accompanies her to Neverland. John is the older of the two brothers, and is the smartest of the bunch.\n\nDuring season three of \"Once Upon a Time,\" John and his brother Michael work for the villainous Peter Pan in order to keep their sister Wendy alive. When John and Michael reach adulthood, Peter stops them from aging, and sends them into the real world to do his bidding while he remains in Neverland. When Peter is defeated, the three Darling children are reunited, and return home to England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Immekus plays the grown-up Michael Darling from \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nMichael also appears in 1953's \"Peter Pan\" as the youngest of the Darling children. He travels to Neverland with his siblings, and helps defeat the evil Captain Hook.\n\nDuring season three, Michael and his brother John are employed by the evil Peter Pan, who is holding their sister Wendy hostage. In order to keep her safe, they work for Peter for over 100 years, as he stops them from aging. Once he is defeated, the three Darling children are reunited and return home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSean Maguire brings the fox \"Robin Hood\" to life, starting in season three.\n\nThe titular star of 1973's \"Robin Hood\" is a fox. Robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor alongside his best friend, the bear Little John. Robin falls in love with Maid Marian over the course of the movie, and the two live happily ever after.\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Time\" version of Robin has more of a rough go of it. His wife Marian is executed after defying the Evil Queen, aka Regina — though Robin doesn't learn this until after Regina reforms and becomes a hero and the two have fallen in love. Marian does end up returning to him when the past is altered by Emma Swan and Captain Hook, which creates an epic love triangle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Burkart appears as Little John, who is a bear in \"Robin Hood.\"\n\nIn 1973's \"Robin Hood,\" all the characters from the legend of Robin Hood are turned into animals. Little John, Robin's beloved sidekick, is a bear. The two travel across Nottingham and steal from the rich and give to the poor.\n\nLittle John, who makes his first appearance in season three, is a gentle giant much like his movie counterpart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael P. Northey plays Friar Tuck from \"Robin Hood\" in season three.\n\nFriar Tuck is a badger in the 1973 film \"Robin Hood.\" He's one of Robin's friends, and resides at the church in Nottingham. He generally stays out of the drama — until the excessive taxing from Prince John and the Sheriff interfere with the church, which gets him very heated.\n\nFriar Tuck is not so innocent in \"Once Upon a Time\" — he's fully part of Robin Hood's band of Merry Men, who frequently steal from the rich to give to the poor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenri Lubatti lends his voice and face to a season three episode to play everyone's favorite candelabra, Lumiere, from \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\nIn the 1991 film \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Lumiere is just one of many enchanted objects in the Beast's castle — they all used to be human, but once the castle was cursed they were all transformed into household items. His humanity is eventually restored when the curse is broken.\n\nIn the \"Once\" season three episode \"Quiet Minds,\" it is revealed that Lumiere was turned into a candlestick by the Wicked Witch of the West, in order to help Belle and Rumpelstiltskin's son Baelfire revive Rumpelstiltskin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexandra Metz appears in a single season three episode as \"Tangled\" star Rapunzel.\n\nThe 2010 film \"Tangled\" tells the story of Rapunzel, a girl who was kidnapped when she was just a baby due to the magical healing powers of her hair, which she isn't allowed to cut. She eventually breaks out of her tower with help from a criminal with a heart of gold, Flynn Rider, and is reunited with her family.\n\nThe events of Rapunzel's appearance in the \"Once\" season three episode \"The Tower\" are a bit different. This Rapunzel wasn't kidnapped as a baby — she grew up with her family, and is only imprisoned in the tower after she ingests a plant called night root that allows a person to confront their worst fear. Rapunzel thinks she is trapped in the tower by an evil witch, but it's really the manifestation of her worst fear — herself, as a bad person.\n\nDavid, aka Prince Charming, takes the place of Flynn Rider in the episode and helps Rapunzel escape the tower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorgina Haig plays Elsa, of \"Let It Go\" fame, during the show's season four \"Frozen\" arc.\n\nIn \"Frozen,\" which came out in 2013, Elsa is one of the princesses of Arendelle, who has magical ice powers. She keeps them a secret, but they are accidentally revealed when she sets off a giant snowstorm, in the middle of summer. By the movie's end, she learns to control them.\n\nWhen Elsa appears in \"Once Upon a Time,\" the events of the movie have already taken place. At some point, she was imprisoned in an urn due to her magic by her evil aunt Ingrid, but is accidentally released by Emma Swan, the show's main character, and Captain Hook in the third season finale, though we don't actually see her face.\n\nThroughout the rest of season four, she attempts to learn more about her powers, and desperately tries to reunite with her sister, Anna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Lail brings Anna from \"Frozen\" to life during the show's fourth season.\n\nThe fourth season of \"Once Upon a Time\" premiered in September 2014, 10 months after the smash hit \"Frozen,\" a movie about the love between two sisters, one of which has magical ice powers, was unleashed onto the general public.\n\nThe events of season four take place an undetermined amount of time after the movie ends, so Anna is happily engaged to her movie love interest Kristoff, and in a good place in regards to Elsa, her magical sister. The two sisters are eventually separated by their evil aunt Ingrid, but are reunited by season's end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPascale Hutton is Queen Gerda from \"Frozen\" in two episodes of season four.\n\nThe Queen doesn't actually get a name in the 2013 movie \"Frozen.\" She exists mainly to tragically die in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and put Elsa on her path to becoming queen herself.\n\nThe fourth season of \"Once Upon a Time\" explores much of the backstory of the characters of \"Frozen,\" and that includes giving the queen a name, Gerda, and two sisters. When they were young, Gerda's sister Ingrid accidentally killed their other sister Helga with her ice powers. When Elsa reveals that she inherited these powers as well, Gerda and her husband travel to the Enchanted Forest to attempt to rid Elsa of these powers, but they die before they are successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott Michael Foster plays \"Frozen's\" Kristoff during season four.\n\nIn 2013's \"Frozen,\" Kristoff begins as a lonely and grumpy iceman, but slowly warms up to Anna, and eventually the two fall in love.\n\nThe fourth season of \"Once Upon a Time\" picks up after the events of \"Frozen,\" and Kristoff and Anna are engaged. While Anna is off on her own adventure, Kristoff and his future-sister-in-law, Elsa, team up to take down Hans.\n\nKristoff and Anna eventually reunite, along with Elsa, and return to Arendelle to rescue it from Hans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Hans of the Southern Isles from \"Frozen\" is portrayed by Tyler Jacob Moore in two episodes of season four.\n\nIn \"Frozen,\" which was released in 2013, Hans is the bad guy — he tricks Anna into falling in love with him and he almost murders Elsa, all to control their kingdom, Arendelle.\n\nHans, after being defeated in \"Frozen,\" is still hellbent on taking control of Arendelle and defeating the two sisters. First, he attempts to entrap Elsa inside a magical urn, but unwittingly releases their aunt, the Snow Queen instead — she freezes him as an ice sculpture for 30 years. Then, he attempts to murder Anna and Kristoff by drowning them, but is again defeated, and receives a punch in the face from Anna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Runyon plays the minor, yet memorable, character the Duke of Weselton from \"Frozen\" in just one episode of season four.\n\nIn the 2013 blockbuster \"Frozen,\" the Duke of Weselton stands out as a the double-crossing Duke who pretends to be an ally of the Kingdom of Arendelle — he's only interested in its secrets and its bountiful resources.\n\nThe Duke appears in the season four episode \"The Snow Queen,\" which takes place before the events of \"Frozen.\" However, even as a young man, he's still a snake. He tries to court one of Arendelle's princesses, Helga (a show invention), but inadvertently gets her killed when he uses her as a human shield against her sister Ingrid's (another show invention) ice powers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria Smurfit appears as the main antagonist from \"101 Dalmatians,\" Cruella de Vil, in the show's fourth and fifth seasons.\n\nCruella de Vil is the antagonist in the 1961 film \"101 Dalmatians,\" in which she kidnaps 101 Dalmatian puppies and attempts to skin them to create a coat. Obviously, she is defeated.\n\nThe TV version of Cruella is a bit different — she has magical powers that allow her to control animals with her voice, and even has two Dalmatians of her own that she controls. This Cruella also can't kill anything, due to her interactions with Isaac, the author of all the fairy tale stories shown throughout the events of \"Once Upon a Time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerrin Dungey brings the sea witch herself, Ursula from \"The Little Mermaid,\" to life in season four.\n\nUrsula is unequivocally the bad guy of 1989's \"The Little Mermaid.\" She cons Ariel out of her voice and turns King Triton into a polyp, so she can become the queen of the Seven Seas. She is defeated when Prince Eric stabs her with a splintered piece of his ship.\n\nDuring season four of \"Once Upon a Time,\" Ursula's backstory is actually mixed with Ariel's. She is born a mermaid to King Poseidon, and has a beautiful singing voice. Her mother is killed by humans, which makes her father hate them — but Ursula is convinced they are good. She steals a magical bracelet that gives her legs, and sets off to prove her father wrong.\n\nSadly, she is eventually turned to the dark side by an interaction with pre-reformed Captain Hook, who steals her singing voice. Ursula is angered, and decides she doesn't want to be a mermaid anymore, and uses Poseidon's trident to turn her tail into tentacles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimothy Webber pops up as the Apprentice from \"Fantasia\" throughout the show.\n\n\"Fantasia\" is a special kind of Disney movie — it's comprised of seven different animated shorts, all set to famous pieces of classical music. The segment that the Apprentice appears is in aptly titled \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\" In it, Mickey Mouse appears as an apprentice to a powerful wizard, who doesn't let Mickey do magic. Mickey eventually steals his magical hat, and uses magic to disastrous consequences.\n\nThe Apprentice, who makes his first appearance in season four, works for the most powerful wizard in the realm, Merlin. He also watches over a magical hat that looks exactly like its animated counterpart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSebastian Roché is in just one episode of season four as King Stefan from \"Sleeping Beauty.\"\n\nKing Stefan's daughter is the titular sleeping beauty from the 1959 Disney classic \"Sleeping Beauty.\" He, along with his wife, decree that all spindles be destroyed in the kingdom, in order to prevent Maleficent's curse of eternal sleep from coming true, and allow their daughter, Aurora, to be raised by three fairies in the woods, forfeiting his rights as a parent.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" switches up the story a little bit — Stefan marries Briar Rose (the name Aurora is called by the fairies in the movie), after she is cursed by Maleficent, and he defeats her. They have a child, Aurora, and to make sure she will be safe, Stefan unsuccessfully tries to defeat Maleficent once and for all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWes Brown plays \"Beauty and the Beast\" villain Gaston in a season five episode.\n\nGaston appears in 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast\" as the unflappable Gaston, the human embodiment of toxic masculinity. He refuses to take no for an answer from Belle, and when she rebuffs him, turns the entire town against the Beast, and even tries to murder him.\n\nGaston, as many other villains do, receives more back story in \"Once Upon a Time,\" during the season five episode \"Her Handsome Hero.\" In the show, Belle is already a princess, not the daughter of a poor inventor, and the two become engaged to protect the kingdom from ogres — even after it is revealed that he tortured an ogre after explicitly stating to Belle that he wouldn't.\n\nHowever, after Belle is imprisoned by the Beast/Rumpelstiltskin, he attempts to make peace. He is then transformed into a rose by Rumpelstiltskin, who gives the rose to Belle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Garrigan appears as a grown-up version of King Arthur in season five. Arthur was just a boy when he was the star of \"The Sword in the Stone.\"\n\n\"The Sword in the Stone,\" which was released in 1963, itself is based on the legends of King Arthur, Camelot, and the sword Excalibur. A young boy named Arthur is named the true king of Camelot when he is deemed worthy to pull Excalibur, an enchanted sword, out of a stone, with the help of his friend and wizard Merlin.\n\nIn the fifth season of \"Once Upon a Times,\" Arthur is all grown-up, the King of Camelot, and is married to his childhood sweetheart Guinevere. Unfortunately, his magical sword Excalibur is broken, and he has become obsessed with making it whole again, to the point of becoming one of the season's antagonists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor six blissful episodes in season five, Elliot Knight plays Merlin, one of the most famous wizards of all time, and a main character in \"The Sword in the Stone.\"\n\nMerlin is one of the most famous wizards in history — he's even used as a catchphrase in \"Harry Potter.\" In the 1963 film \"The Sword in the Stone,\" Merlin is an eccentric old wizard who helps Arthur on his way to becoming the king of England.\n\nPrior to the events of \"Once Upon a Time,\" Merlin was cursed and transformed into a tree by his ex-girlfriend, Nimue. He's eventually set free by Emma and her friends and family in season five, but meets a brutal end at the hands of a temporarily evil Captain Hook.\n\nThough his time on the show was brief, Knight made quite the impression on fans — so much so that he became a meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee Majdoub appeared in one episode of season five as Sir Kay from \"The Sword in the Stone.\"\n\nSir Kay is Arthur's older foster brother in the 1963 film \"The Sword in the Stone.\" Arthur is forced to become Kay's squire, instead of learning magic from Merlin.\n\nKay is similarly a bully in the season five episode \"The Dark Swan,\" but it's unclear if the two have the same familial relationship. He is a knight, and is convinced that he is the one that is destined to pull Excalibur from the stone. Unfortunately when he tries, he is immediately turned into ash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg Germann appears in 10 episodes of the show's fifth season as Hades, the villain of \"Hercules.\"\n\nIn the 1997 film \"Hercules,\" Hades is the antagonist. He is the god of the Underworld, and attempts to overthrow his big brother Zeus by assembling a team of Titans to destroy Mount Olympus. He is, of course, defeated by his nephew Hercules.\n\nGermann's performance as Hades is clearly inspired by the film's version — they're both wisecracking, hot-headed men with blue flames for hair. During season five, the gang travels to the Underworld to rescue Captain Hook, who has died — and they meet Hades, the villain of the season.\n\nHades eventually falls in love with Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" but she is forced to kill him after he murders Robin Hood and proves that he'll never change for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Whitesell pops up as Hercules, from the movie \"Hercules,\" in a season five episode.\n\nIn the 1997 movie \"Hercules,\" the titular hunk goes on a hero's journey to find where he belongs — down on Earth with his true love Meg, or on Mount Olympus with his family of gods.\n\nHerucles' sole appearance, in the season five episode \"Labor of Love,\" is more heavily influenced by the Greek legend of Hercules. The episode explicitly states that Hercules must complete the 12 labors to become a true hero — something that the movie only hints at.\n\nHercules is killed during his 12th labor, killing the three-headed dog Cerberus, and is sent to the Underworld. With the help of Meg and his childhood friend Snow White, the trio are able to defeat the dog, and Hercules and Meg enter Mount Olympus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKacey Rohl plays a significantly less sassy version of Meg from \"Hercules\" in season five.\n\nIn 1997's \"Hercules,\" Meg is working as a double agent for Hades, in return for a bargain she made to sell her soul for the life of her boyfriend, who eventually dumped her. Meg slowly begins to believe in love again after meeting Hercules. She's crushed by a column, and narrowly escapes death when Hercules swims into the River Styx and retrieves her soul.\n\nIn the season five episode \"Labor of Love,\" Meg is killed alongside Hercules when they are attacked by the three-headed dog Cerberus — however, they had only just met. Her main role is to communicate to Emma Swan that her boyfriend, Captain Hook, was somewhere inside the Underworld.\n\nAfter Meg works with Hercules and Snow White to defeat Cerberus, she and Hercules cross over to Mount Olympus together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Hoflin plays Zeus from \"Hercules\" in one of the final episodes of season five.\n\nThe version of Zeus that appears in 1997's \"Hercules\" is mainly there for comic relief — he cracks jokes with his evil brother and his demi-god son, Hercules.\n\nDuring his one appearance, Zeus is a game-changer — to thank Captain Hook and Emma (his soul-mate) for helping him defeat Hades, he decides to revive Hook and give him another chance at life. Hook had sacrificed himself during the previous season to defeat the Dark One, one of the show's ultimate bad guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Manson brings Merida of \"Brave\" to life during season five.\n\nDuring the events of the 2012 film \"Brave,\" Merida decides to change her fate and not get engaged before she is ready. She fights with her mother Queen Elinor about this, and eventually gets her mother and brothers cursed, turning them into bears. Only when Merida and Elinor learn to appreciate each other does the curse reverse.\n\nDuring season five of \"Once Upon a Time,\" Merida encounters many of our heroes, including Emma, Mulan, Captain Hook, and Belle, throughout her travels. She avenges her father, rescues her mother and brothers, and proves to her clans that she is fit to lead them as queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlenn Keogh appears in one episode as King Fergus, Merida's father from \"Brave.\"\n\nIn \"Brave,\" Fergus supports his daughter Merida, and is the one who buys her her own bow and arrow. He's not a huge character, but it's clear he loves his daughter.\n\nIn the fifth season episode \"The Bear King,\" their bond is explored much more. Fergus still supports Merida, and encourages her to practice her bow and arrow skills with a teacher (Mulan), but tries to keep her out of battle. He is eventually killed in one-on-one combat, while a horrified Merida watches.\n\nMerida is inspired by her father's foregoing of magic, and convinces the warring clans to respect her authority. To reward Merida for this, a witch grants her the ability to speak with the spirit of her father. After their conversation, Merida is reminded that she needs revenge for his murder, and sets off to kill the man who beat Fergus — King Arthur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueen Elinor from \"Brave\" is brought to life by Caroline Morahan during season five.\n\nIn the 2012 film \"Brave,\" Queen Elinor disapproves of her daughter's tomboyish ways, and wants Merida to change in order to become a more respectable future queen. Her refusal to see Merida for what she is eventually gets her and her sons turned into bears by a curse.\n\nThe events of season five take place after \"Brave,\" when Merida is about to become queen after the death of King Fergus. Elinor and her sons are exiled, because the clans do not believe that Merida is fit to rule — Merida eventually proves them wrong and rescues her family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul Telfer appears in two episodes of season five as Young Macintosh from \"Brave.\"\n\nYoung Macintosh is one of Merida's three suitors in 2012's \"Brave.\" Merida rejects all of them and decides that she wants to control her own fate, and he eventually agrees to the changes.\n\nWhen he shows up in \"Once Upon a Time,\" he has grown up a bit and has been named Lord Macintosh. After the death of Merida's father, Macintosh has apparently reversed his decision, and again demands that Merida marry him or one of the other two suitors. Merida again is able to prove she can lead on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLily Knight appears in the season five episode \"The Bear King\" as the Witch from \"Brave.\"\n\nIn the 2012 movie \"Brave,\" the Witch curses Merida's mother and brothers by transforming them into bears — though she doesn't do it to be evil. She's actually working to try and convince Merida and her mother Elinor to make up and see each other for who they actually are.\n\nThe Witch has a similar role in \"The Bear King,\" in which she helps both Merida and King Fergus (in a flashback) realize that they don't need magic to rule their kingdom successfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostas Mandylor is in just one episode of season five as Captain Silver, a reference to Long John Silver from \"Treasure Planet.\"\n\nThe 2002 \"Treasure Planet\" was itself based on the 1883 novel \"Treasure Island.\" It tells the story of Jim Hawkins, a kid who dreams of adventure and treasure. He forms a bond with the cyborg Long John Silver, a pirate.\n\nCaptain Silver's name is really just an Easter egg to Disney fans. He appears in one episode of season five that explores Captain Hook's back story as a deckhand. He's vindictive, selfish, and ultimately dies due to his hubris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeniz Akdeniz brings Aladdin, of \"Aladdin,\" to life in the sixth season of \"Once Upon a Time.\"\n\nAladdin, obviously, comes from the 1992 movie \"Aladdin,\" the story of a beggar who discovers a magic lamp, and uses the genie inside to win the affections of a princess, Jasmine.\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Time\" iteration of the character is considered a \"savior,\" just like the show's main character Emma Swan. Essentially, he had magical powers in order to do good and be a hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOded Fehr appears in three episodes of the sixth season as Jafar, the evil sorcerer from \"Aladdin.\"\n\nIn \"Aladdin,\" the 1992 movie about a \"street rat\" who falls in love with a princess, Jafar (who calls Aladdin \"street rat\") is an evil sorcerer who wants to take over the kingdom of Agrabah, and by extension, the world. He is defeated when he becomes a genie himself at the end of the movie.\n\nDuring the show's sixth season, which explores what happens to \"saviors\" like Aladdin or Emma Swan, Jafar is the one who explains to Aladdin that saviors never get happy endings, and provides him with shears that will sever him from his destiny as a savior.\n\nJafar is eventually defeated by Princess Jasmine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaren David appears throughout season six as Princess Jasmine, from \"Aladdin.\"\n\nIn 1992's \"Aladdin,\" Jasmine is the object of Aladdin's affections — but she is determined to have adventures, not just be a prize to be won. She also states that she intends to marry for love, not power. She first falls for Aladdin when he's only a thief, and convinces him that he doesn't have to pretend to be a prince, but that she loves him for who he is.\n\nJasmine is essentially the same in the show — she's strong, determined, dedicated to her people, and adamant that she will marry for love. Much like her animated counterpart, Jasmine convinces Aladdin that he is strong enough to defeat Jafar just the way he is. The two eventually end up living happily ever after.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCedric De Souza guest stars as the Sultan of Agrabah from \"Aladdin.\"\n\nThe Sultan in 1992's \"Aladdin\" is more of a figurehead than anything else — he spends most of the movie being mind-controlled by his evil servant Jafar. His main contribution is changing the law so his daughter doesn't have to marry a prince, and can instead marry Aladdin.\n\nThe Sultan appears in two episodes of the sixth season of \"Once Upon a Time,\" and has a similar arc. He's manipulated by Jafar, and is desperately searching for suitors that his daughter Jasmine will connect with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiger Lily from \"Peter Pan\" is played by Sara Tomko in seasons six and seven.\n\nTiger Lily is the somewhat problematic Native American princess from the 1953 film \"Peter Pan.\" She's taken hostage by Captain Hook, Peter's nemesis, who tries to force her to reveal Peter's whereabouts. Thankfully, Peter rescues her and she subsequently falls in love with him, much to the chagrin of Tinker Bell and Wendy.\n\nTiger Lily appears much later than the rest of her Neverland counterparts who were introduced way back in season three. This version of Tiger Lily originally started out as a fairy, and was actually named Rumpelstiltskin's fairy godmother, which was revealed in season six.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLisa Banes appears as Lady Tremaine, the evil stepmother from \"Cinderella\" in a season six episode.\n\nIn the 1950 film \"Cinderella,\" not much is known of Lady Tremaine, other than that she has two daughters, married Cinderella's father, and is now committed to making her life miserable.\n\nThis Lady Tremaine is related to the first incarnation of Cinderella, played by Jessy Schram. Her two daughters are named Clorinda and Tisbe. Lady Tremaine and Clorinda make their debut in the season six episode \"The Other Shoe.\"\n\nAfter Cinderella got married to Prince Thomas, Lady Tremaine and Clorinda escape to the Land of Untold Stories. They eventually make their way to Storybrooke, and reunite with Cinderella, who they unsuccessfully try to kill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYael Yurman plays Anastasia, one of the evil step-sisters from \"Cinderella\" in four episodes of the final season — however she's related to the second iteration of Cinderella, played by Dania Ramirez.\n\nAnastasia appears in all three \"Cinderella\" movies, but is most recognizable from the original 1950 film \"Cinderella,\" the rags-to-riches tale of Cinderella, who goes from servant to princess despite the scheming of her wicked step-mother and evil step-sisters.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" Anastasia is considerably more likable. Instead of being an evil step-sister, she is a daughter who misses her mother, who went missing when she was a young girl. She also has the power to do magic, unlike her cartoon counterpart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrizella, one of the evil step-sisters from \"Cinderella,\" is played by Adelaide Kane in season seven. She is the step-sister of the Cinderella played by Dania Ramirez.\n\nDrizella is the other evil step-sister from \"Cinderella,\" along with Anastasia. In the 1950 film, Drizella doesn't have much to do, other than bully her step-sister and make Cinderella's life miserable.\n\nDrizella, in the show, is much more nuanced. She is also abused by her mother, who only truly cares about her other daughter. Drizella at first tries to be good and practices her magic, but eventually turns dark and casts the final curse of \"Once Upon a Time,\" which the final season revolves around breaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose Reynolds plays the \"Once Upon a Time\" version of Alice, from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" in the show's seventh season. However, an alternate version of Alice was also a main character, played by a different actress, in the spin-off \"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.\"\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland,\" the 1951 movie based upon Lewis Carroll's novel \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\" is about an imaginative young girl who falls through a rabbit hole into a mysterious land called Wonderland.\n\nThe season seven version of the character, who also goes by Tilly, is an amalgam of Rapunzel, Alice, and Sophie from the Roald Dahl novel \"The BFG.\"\n\nShe appears in 14 episodes of the show's final season, and is the daughter of a parallel universe Captain Hook and Mother Gothel (who was disguised at the time).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMekia Cox plays Princess Tiana of \"The Princess and the Frog\" in season seven.\n\nIn 2009's \"The Princess and the Frog,\" Tiana is a hard-working young woman who is determined to own her own restaurant, Tiana's Place. She is turned into a frog when she kisses Prince Naveen, who has also been transformed into a frog. Throughout the film, Tiana learns that there are things more important than work, like love and family.\n\nWhen Tiana appears in \"Once Upon a Time,\" she is already royalty in her own right. Her father became a prince after saving his kingdom, though after his death, the new king is taxing his subjects to the point of destitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Pierre brings Prince Naveen from \"The Princess and the Frog\" to life in season seven.\n\nIn \"The Princess and the Frog,\" which was released in 2009, Naveen is the titular frog — he is turned into one by Dr. Facilier, who does it to gain power and take over Naveen's home country of Maldonia. Naveen starts off as a childish, lazy, privileged young man, but during his adventures with Tiana, he grows up and learns the value of hard work — and they fall in love.\n\nNaveen appears in season seven of \"Once Upon a Time.\" He's not as lazy or childish, but he still doesn't take things as seriously as Tiana, who he meets while they are both hunting an alligator. While the two don't fall in love during the show, it's definitely hinted that it will eventually happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobin Givens is in two episodes of season seven as Eudora from \"The Princess and the Frog.\"\n\nIn the 2009 film \"The Princess and the Frog,\" Eudora is Tiana's widowed mother. She is poor, and depends on both her hard work and Tiana's to help sustain them. But, she is very supportive of Tiana's dream of owning her own restaurant.\n\nIn the final season of \"Once Upon a Time,\" Eudora is still broke — but she's royalty. Her husband, also dead in the show, became a prince after showing bravery as a soldier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Francis appears as Dr. Facilier, the evil sorcerer from \"The Princess and the Frog,\" in the show's final season.\n\n2009's \"The Princess and the Frog\" tells the story of a young woman, Tiana, who is turned into a frog via a curse cast by Dr. Facilier, a Voodoo witch doctor.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time,\" Dr. Facilier is similar — he's evil, and a sorcerer, but he goes about his plans a bit differently in the seventh season. He is also revealed to have a romantic relationship with the Evil Queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Booth plays Mother Gothel, the villain from \"Tangled.\"\n\nIn 2010's \"Tangled,\" which tells the story of Rapunzel, Rapunzel is trapped in a tower by Mother Gothel, who kidnapped Rapunzel as a baby. Why? Because Rapunzel's luscious head of hair contains magical powers which prevent Gothel from aging. She is, of course, defeated by the end.\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Time\" incarnation of Mother Gothel is also evil, and one of the main antagonists of the show's revamped final season. She originally started out as a nymph (a magical forest creature) but grew to hate humans when they discovered her magic and attacked her and her family. She is eventually defeated by our heroes, and turned into a tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrevor Roberts plays Remy from \"Ratatouille\" in season seven.\n\n2007's \"Ratatouille\" tells the story of Remy, a rat, whose dream is to become a well-respected chef at his own restaurant. He eventually achieves his dream through the help of both his human friends and his rat family.\n\nThe Remy in the final season of \"Once Upon a Time\" wasn't actually a rat, but he was a chef in the Enchanted Forest. We never meet the un-cursed version of Remy, so his name is more of a nod to Disney fans than an actual depiction of the character.\n\nRead next\n\nTV Disney\n\nAdvertisement"
