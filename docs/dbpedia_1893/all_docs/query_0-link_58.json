        "text": "Jennifer Morrison (Emma), Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen), Raphael Sbarge (Jiminy Cricket/Dr. Hopper), and Josh Dallas (Prince Charming) share some of their Disney favorites.\n\nWhat is your first Disney memory?\n\nRaphael Sbarge: There are so many. I remember Fantasia as being one of the first movies I ever saw and being both frightened and not being able to take my eyes off it as a kid. There’s something dark and twisted and so fabulous about it. I remember Snow White. And, of course, Pinocchio.\n\nWe definitely were a full-force Disney family.\n\nJennifer Morrison: I’ve been going to Walt Disney World since I was probably in my mother’s womb. We used to go three times a year. We would drive from Chicago. Pack up the car and cooler and make the 21-hour drive. We have been on every backstage tour, every making-of, every behind-the-scenes tour. We had a system down so we didn’t have to wait in line. This was pre-FastPass. Everything has changed with FastPass. We definitely were a full-force Disney family.\n\nAs I got older, I found Ursula fascinating to watch.\n\nDo you have a favorite Disney movie?\n\nLana Parrilla: I have two, actually. Dumbo, which I love. That was my favorite Disney movie to watch with my dad. The other is The Little Mermaid. I think every little girl wants to be a mermaid. I would definitely swim out to sea and pray to the mermaid gods to turn me into a mermaid. The Little Mermaid was a favorite. I think initially I adored Ariel. As I got older, I found Ursula fascinating to watch. Her body language and the bigness in character. She’s not only big in size but in voice and in movement. I loved it. She also has some effect on a subconscious level in the development of the Evil Queen. Little nuances here and there, like in those fun scenes with Hansel and Gretel, there are scenes where I can play Ursula.\n\nJosh Dallas: My favorite Disney movie changes all the time. But, I always go back to Pinocchio. I think because it’s my first Disney memory.\n\nJennifer Morrison: As a little girl I really loved The Little Mermaid. When that came out, there was nothing else like it. I probably watched that movie 1,000 times. I know the words to every song. As I grew older, it’s a tie between The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast. They are so cinematic with great storytelling.\n\nDo you have a favorite Disney character?\n\nJennifer Morrison: For me, it was always a strong tie between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. Looking back, I think there were subconscious reasons. From the Cinderella perspective, I was a very misunderstood kid. I was a little slow to develop socially. I did well academically but my social skills kicked in later in life. I was an outsider, so I identified with her sense of being an outsider. With Alice, since I was five years old I knew I wanted to be an actor and was fascinated with the world and playing all these different characters. I identified with her going down the rabbit hole. That’s what my life has become, going on different adventures—different films and television shows that I get to be a part of.\n\nLana Parrilla: Ursula has been my number one. I just love her. She’s a load of fun. To me she just steals that show!\n\nWhat’s your favorite Disney park attraction?\n\nJosh Dallas: If I had a favorite ride, it’s a tossup between Space Mountain and Indiana Jones. Space Mountain . . . Because it’s like flying through a sky in your dreams. The Indiana Jones movies were so seminal to me growing up. I loved them! And wanted to be Indiana Jones. So that ride allowed me to be Jones for a few minutes.\n\nIt was really amazing how artful and beautiful and magical it was."
