        "text": "Raphael Sbarge has opened up about the future of Once Upon a Time.\n\nThe actor plays Archie Hopper - aka Jiminy Cricket - on the ABC series. He revealed that he knows little about future episodes of the show, admitting that information about the upcoming installments is kept \"pretty tight\" on set.\n\nHe went on to say that he looks forward to learning the identity of Emma Swan's (Jennifer Morrison) fairytale land persona.\n\n\"Essentially, I don't [know],\" Sbarge told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's not clear yet.\n\n\"We know obviously that she was a little girl put into safety in the canoe or whatever that was made of wood. We know that she's 28. She has come back and obviously she's there to help fight the curse. That's what we know.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"It's going to be interesting to see how that opens up. What her fairy tale character is, I don't know yet and I'm really excited to see what they're going to do with that.\"\n\nSbarge recently revealed that his character's upcoming storyline made him cry, saying that the story arc devised by the show's writers \"knocked [him] out\".\n\nThe actor previously predicted that there will be an \"epic battle\" in the show, though he does not know when the showdown will occur.\n\nOnce Upon a Time airs on Sundays at 8/7c on ABC."
