        "text": "I wonder if M. Night Shyamalan cast Hayley Mills in Trap because it is about a parent being trapped at a concert. Josh Hartnett’s Cooper/The Butcher isn’t just stuck at that Lady Raven show. He’s held captive by memories of an abusive mother and maintaining a double life as doting dad and demented serial killer. Ms. Mills pulled double duty in Disney’s The Parent Trap some 60 plus years ago. It is nice to see her in a high profile project as an FBI profiler. Doesn’t it, however, seem like the type of weird Shyamalan touch to put her in the picture simply due to the title connection?\n\nM. Night’s Disney breakout The Sixth Sense and follow-ups Unbreakable and Signs still stand as career highlights. You do know that his unnatural dialogue will be a constant and that’s even if those aforementioned strongest efforts. It’s present in Trap, but the wooden acting that often accompanies his thrillers is thankfully missing.\n\nHartnett, in his first leading role in a while, treats his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to floor seats for pop sensation Lady Raven. She’s played by the writer/director’s own offspring Saleka. While enduring such a performance might be a chore for any middle-aged dad, he’s got bigger problems. As a kindly and quick to spew exposition T-shirt merchant (Jonathan Langdon) informs Cooper, the whole afternoon gig is an elaborate sting to nab 12 time murderer The Butcher.\n\nThat would, of course, be Cooper and he’s phone monitoring unlucky #13 tied up in a basement somewhere. Now he must pretend to enjoy the entertainment while searching for a way to bypass the heavy security and keep Riley relatively unsuspicious. To be fair, daughters that age probably think their dads are acting strangely without believing they’re homicidal maniacs.\n\nThis concept managed to put me in an odd and at times darkly enjoyable position. I found myself rooting for Cooper to solve this complicated puzzle and outwit the FBI being led by the former Mouse House child star. It works on Shyamalan’s terms for about one hour. Then it becomes considerably more convoluted and less engrossing.\n\nThe cast is not to blame. It’s amusing to watch Hartnett volley back and forth between personalities and Donoghue convinces in her bracelet donning fangirl love for the headliner. Saleka Shyamlan is fine while onstage though her more meaningful contributions unfortunately come later as the screenplay is unraveling.\n\nI’ll make a concert analogy. The first couple of acts feel like Shyamalan playing his greatest hits dependably while not exactly knocking it out of the park. The encores have the sense of that artist bizarrely playing new tracks from an unreleased album. It’s not what we want and it goes on for longer that it has a right to.\n\n** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nThere’s plenty of belly laughs amidst the bullets in Deadpool & Wolverine and some fleeting emotional moments as well. That’s no shocker as this sub-franchise from Ryan Reynolds has mixed with the bawdy with the blubbery since 2016. Dropping Wolverine into the equation is an example of corporate synergy thanks to Disney’s acquisition of Fox five years ago. You’ll recall that Hugh Jackman’s signature clawed character met a bloody yet dignified end in 2017’s Logan. For those who believe his chapter closed appropriately (and it did), the multiverse machinations of the MCU may seem cash grab inappropriate. I didn’t mind so much because it’s Jackman’s chemistry with Reynolds that provide the high points.\n\nDeadpool’s life is kinda dead in the water in 2024. He’s living full-time as Wade Wilson having retired the mask after being rejected during a job interview for The Avengers. He wants to make a difference on a Tony Stark/Captain America sized scale, but the universe seems to feel otherwise. Broken up with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and rooming with Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), his mundane existence in the used car biz is jolted by the Time Variance Authority (TVA).\n\nAs exposited by one of their agents Mr. Paradox (a game Matthew MacFadyen), Wade’s “Sacred Timeline” is at risk of crumbling. That’s due to Logan’s aforementioned fate from years earlier since he served as the Timeline’s stalwart anchor. The TVA offers Mr. Pool a way out while his small group of loved ones will perish. His solution is to find another Logan across the multiverses to save the world as he knows it. Naturally he ends up with a boozy, guilt ridden, and reluctant hero version of the once proud X-Man.\n\nThe duo end up in the Void which houses outcast varieties of familiar and more unfamiliar superheroes. This wasteland is ruled by Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), as X-Men adjacent telepathic with designs on dominating all the dimensions. The Void concept allows for plenty of cameos from the preeminent genre of the 21st century. I wouldn’t dare spoil them, but I’d recommend seeing this quick before X gives it to you. The appearances of these known quantities is good for a few chuckles. Yet I would argue that the dependence on them (especially during the middle section) dulls the sharp humor for a stretch.\n\nD & W could have used more of the two leads just marinating in their beloved personas. With Shawn Levy handling the direction after teaming with Reynolds on Free Guy and The Adam Project, the pic occasionally seems too busy and eager to please. One quibble is that when Pool and Wolvie fight each other, the screenplay (from five writers including Reynolds and Levy) tells us just how awesome it’s about to be!! The truth is that the action sequences are your typical Marvel level mayhem, no more or less. Speaking of eager to please, I do have to shoutout the hideous and simultaneously adorable Mary Puppins aka Dogpool character.\n\nDue to the demerits listed above, I’d rank this third among the three Deadpool movies. I cannot deny that it still manages to the tickle the funny bone with some precision targets uproariously skewered. That includes Disney’s recent misfortunes in its not always marvelous franchise. This won’t be looked at as one of them courtesy of the headliners.\n\n*** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nLonglegs is a more effective freak show than FBI story. The direction of Osgood Perkins often shows a mastery at building tension and establishing a chilling tone. When the final act arrives, I grew colder to its energy as the plot points became more recognizable. That might be a little misleading, however, since this does feature a bonkers performance even by Nicolas Cage’s standards. When the procedural itself becomes more standard, it can suffer.\n\nMaika Monroe is Agent Lee Harker, who can’t have been in the Bureau for long but whose seemingly psychic abilities serve as an asset. The manhunt is on for Longlegs, a serial killer dabbling in the occult and intricate doll making. His young female victims also share birthdays that fall on the 14th of the month.\n\nSet in the 90s as evidenced by the Bill Clinton portrait behind her superior’s desk, Agent Harker seems to share more than a psychic connection to the case. Her off-kilter mother (Alicia Witt) seems hung up on religious themes. You begin to suspect that the case may have relations with that woman.\n\nBarely seen or heard in the trailers, Mr. Cage is the title character. Buried in makeup that could earn those artists awards nominations, this is Nic at his most uncaged. There are snippets of his work that will surely enter the Memeification Hall of Fame and there are aspects of his performance that certainly remind us of his wild versatility. It’s also occasionally challenging to look beyond the off the charts Caginess of it.\n\nThe short of it is that Longlegs works best when the mystery is unraveling and its secrets are obscured like Cage was in the ads. As more is revealed, it loses some edge. Yet there is no doubt that Perkins (son of Psycho Anthony Perkins) injects this with devilish details that provide anxiety, especially early on.\n\n*** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F is frequently an amusing ride of overt nostalgia mining. It works better than the other two sequels to the 1984 original, especially 1994’s embarrassing III set at an amusement park. Is it good? That might hinge on your generosity level any given moment or reverence for what happened four decades ago. Eddie Murphy is certainly trying harder than he did 30 years ago (and in several mediocre titles between now and then). This is also a notch above Coming 2 America, his other recent long gestating legacy follow-up. Having this premiere on Netflix kinda makes sense. You can check out from time to time and it might not disrupt your overall experience. Does it try too hard to capture a 40-year-old vibe? I guess. Was I still watching? Yes and with more attentiveness than when Axel Foley donned an elephant costume in BHC III (never forget).\n\nThe role of renegade Detroit cop Axel Foley is the one that turned Murphy from a movie star to iconic superstar. Part one additionally blended action and comedy in ways that many copied and still do. Beverly Hills Cop II, despite some guilty pleasure high gloss moments courtesy of Tony Scott, couldn’t think of much more to do with the concept. III, despite reuniting its star and Trading Places and Coming to America director John Landis… well we’ve covered that already. Seeing him slide on his Detroit Lions jacket again could’ve been yet another big-budget letdown. Yet just as that team has recently shown signs of life, this series does in part IV.\n\nFoley returns to the West Coast for family business after a cool Motor City prologue set at a Red Wings game (this allows for Paul Reiser to reprise his role as our protagonist’s former partner). His estranged daughter Jane (Taylour Paige) is an attorney representing an innocent man for killing a cop. The dirty police captain (Kevin Bacon) responsible for the murder may need to off the Foley offspring to cover his tracks. So Axel’s ole pal Billy (Judge Reinhold) sends up the 90210 signal before he gets kidnapped himself. His old partner Taggart (John Ashton) is now the Chief. Side note – he was nowhere to be found in III because he probably read the screenplay.\n\nSome of the script allows time for Axel to attempt rekindling a strained relationship with Jane. He also acquaints himself with Detective Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his main partner in property destruction and Jane’s ex-flame. Both Gordon-Levitt and Paige are serviceable additions to the proceedings.\n\nI can’t say the same for everyone else. Bronson Pinchot is back as the flamboyant Serge. An art gallery employee in Beverly Hills Cop, he stole two hilarious minutes from Murphy 40 years back. By III (I’m sorry to keep returning to that disaster), he was inexplicably a weapons dealer whose cameo was as unfunny as everything else in the runtime. Now he’s a bleach blonde real estate agent whose appearance feels tacked on. Same goes for Luis Guzman’s eccentric gang leader. Their parts could’ve been eliminated and we would’ve been better off without their 80s vibes.\n\nPerhaps the shameless callbacks to the best franchise moments will leave you cold. I must admit the Pointer Sisters and Harold Faltermeyer and Bob Seger and Glenn Frey needle drops provided joy. Additionally the scaled down nature of the action sequences felt retro positive. Director Mark Molloy often succeeds in making this feel like it could’ve been produced in the era it celebrates. Never mind that everyone looks older and sorer with the notable exception of the seemingly ageless Murphy. This is not an action comedy for the ages. Despite Kevin Bacon as the chief baddie, all four Cop‘s share forgettable villains.\n\nThe series that made “Shakedown” an Oscar nominated track doesn’t attempt anything close to a shakeup. Thankfully its megawatt star is in his groove enough that it warrants going back to Cali.\n\n*** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nWe all know Tom Cruise does his own stunts. He reminds us of that frequently and is the biggest artist handling the bulk of those duties himself. David Leitch’s The Fall Guy takes time to honor those performers doubling for the non-Cruisers and that’s a noble cause though it often plays like a long shaggy dog story.\n\nSort of based on the 1980s TV show with Lee Majors, Ryan Gosling is Colt Seavers. He’s Cliff Booth to Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s Rick Dalton… or rather Tom Ryder, who’s a mega action superstar with a penchant for hard partying. Seavers does the trickier work while Ryder takes all the credit. A prologue details a setup gone wrong that derails Colt’s career and his budding relationship with camerawoman Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt).\n\nA year and a half later, Colt is parking cars instead of crashing them. He is summoned by producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham, kind of looking like 70s era Robert Evans in a wig) to set in Sydney. The selling point is the opportunity to make up with Jody, who is now directing the sci-fi saga Metalstorm with Ryder headlining. Upon his arrival down under, it turns out Jody has no idea what’s up or that he was joining the production.\n\nThe picture’s lead has mysteriously disappeared and Colt is tasked with tracking him down while also stunting by day. And, of course, there’s some serious and humorous tension with his ex.\n\nI was reminded at times of 80s action comedies like Beverly Hills Cop or Fletch where the plot is inconsequential and where coasting on the above the title players’ charisma is enough. Obviously Gosling and Blunt have that level of appeal.\n\nSomehow I didn’t fall for it despite their efforts. They have chemistry, but this fails to coast on their charms. The action scenes are well-choreographed. They should be given the subject matter and Leitch (John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Bullet Train) in charge. Yet there’s not one sequence that rivals, say, the antics of you know who in fill in the recent Mission: Impossible entry.\n\nThere are more references to Miami Vice or other 80s artifacts than the TV show it takes its name from. This includes Jody belting out “Against All Odds” by Phil Collins at a karaoke bar while Colt is engaged in an elaborate car chase. Blunt being more involved in the fights might have helped. Her one scene where she gets to do so is memorable.\n\nThe Fall Guy, given the personnel, is a minor disappointment especially with how convoluted it gets in the denouement. The occasionally on point self-referential jokes and the Barbenheimer cast mates provide the highlights. When they’re apart, it can feel like just an empty space.\n\n** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes, for starters, gets its name right. Arriving seven years after War for the Planet of the Apes, a common criticism (not an especially important one) of the preceding trilogy was that their titles were a bit misleading. 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes should’ve been Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Yet that one came three years later and a more appropriate moniker for it would be War for the Planet of the Apes. However, War was in 2017 even though Rise of the Planet of the Apes would’ve fit better. Apes are indeed ruling the planet in the fourth entry of this Apes run and the tenth overall in the franchise. Climb of the Planet of the Apes might’ve stuck as well since the plot needs the creatures to use their upward mobility to get them out of jams.\n\nUltimately Kingdom gets more right than its name. A brief prologue reminds us where we left off in War. In its climax, simian leader Caesar (played iconically by Andy Serkis in probably the greatest motion capture performance ever) stopped being an Earthbound dweller and belonged to the ages. “Many generation later” (like 200-300 years), there are groups who study and honor Caesar’s work. Others are agnostic. Young ape Noa (Owen Teague) is in the latter bunch. His clan is more preoccupied with their birding activities which involve coming-of-age rituals that Noa is primed for. This is interrupted by human contact in the form of Freya Allan’s character Mae. All members of that race have been rendered speechless (as we started to witness in War). By Kingdom‘s coming, they’re also undomesticated and homeless and rare to come across.\n\nThis interaction inadvertently brings harm to Noa’s loved ones and sets the young ape on a course of discovery and retrieval of kidnapped family members. The abductor is Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand’s superb and complex villain), whose mission involves bringing all clans together where he can rule with an iron paw. While that ape bends the teachings of Caesar to his own twisted ideology, others succeed in extolling the virtues. This includes orangutan Raka (Peter Macon) who joins Noa on the journey and first exposes him to the dominant force in Rise, Dawn, and War (or more appropriately… Dawn, War, and Rise but’s let not get hung up on it).\n\nRaka is maybe my favorite character in a screenplay (by Avatar: The Way of Water scribe Josh Friedman) filled with promising new ones. I say promising because Kingdom is clearly world building to more installments. In that sense, comparisons to Rise of the Planet of the Apes from 2011 are apt. That tale explained Caesar’s childhood upbringing and eventual imprisonment that created the wide divide between apes and human. The movie itself was lean and efficient with a short runtime compared to Dawn, War, and this. Parts of Kingdom could’ve used a shave and tighter edit. The end result, though, is similar to 2011’s reboot in that I look forward to what’s coming while valuing what I just saw. Wes Ball takes over directorial responsibilities from Matt Reeves, who excelled at making the darker Dawn and War. Ball’s contribution may not be quite as distinctive, but it’s well-executed in reintroducing the audience to its visual landscapes and consistent tug-of-war between species coexisting in them.\n\nThis is smarter summer blockbuster sci-fi than any other franchise going and the series has been pulling that off for nearly 60 years. There’s been dips in quality (hi Tim Burton and various portions of the 1970s sequels). These past four Apes sagas have climbed to the top in terms of overall quality.\n\n***1/2 (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nTo generously take a bowl is half super approach, Jerry Seinfeld’s Unfrosted features stand-up Kyle Dunnigan doing a pretty killer Walter Cronkite impression. His anchor recounts the news with trademark authority followed by darkly amusing off the air grumblings about his love life and alcoholism. Later on, Dunnigan follows up with an impressive Johnny Carson takeoff. There’s lots of comedians and comedic performers in the legendary Mr. Seinfeld’s directorial debut for Netflix. Most of them don’t get the chance to nail their brief screen time like Mr. Dunnigan. A lot of Unfrosted, a mostly fictional account of how Pop-Tarts came to be, consists of stale humor with too many subplots competing against one another.\n\nEven 96 minutes feels long since there’s barely enough witty material for the 22 minutes Jerry used to work in. He plays Bob Cabana, a high level exec at Kellogg’s in 1963. This is one of those screenplays (by Seinfeld and his frequent collaborators Spike Feresten, Andy Robin, and Barry Marder) that constantly reminds us it’s set during that decade in increasingly lame ways. Along with his boss Edsel Kellogg III (Jim Gaffigan) and Melissa McCarthy’s NASA scientist turned cereal conglomerate employee, they are in a race to produce the best toasted pastry treat. In Battle Creek, Michigan, the combat lines are drawn with their rival Post led by socialite Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer). Such lines are not so subtly tied to another race – the space one – of that era.\n\nRhythms of Unfrosted becomes familiar in short order – a joke or two that work about a given subplot (like the correlation with the nation’s trip to the moon) that get overused swiftly. There’s bursts of inspiration like Dunnigan’s grousing. Bill Burr’s take on JFK is also a delight. Most of the time I wasn’t blown away by what else the overfilled screenplay had to say.\n\nSince this is Seinfeld we’re talking about, there’s lots of funny people popping in for a day or two on the set. Hugh Grant is the very real Thurl Ravenscroft, a true Shakespearean thespian who voiced Tony the Tiger. The Kellogg gang recruits a hodgepodge of kitschy historical figures including fitness guru Jack LaLanne (James Marsden), Sea Monkeys maker and maybe Nazi Harold von Braunhut (Thomas Lennon), and Chef Boy Ardee (Bobby Moynihan) to develop the product. I could go on and on. Mixing all these talents together is bound to produce some amusing highlights and it does on occasion, but not nearly enough. Sometimes the satire totally misses like when it attempts to connect a mascot uprising to January 6th.\n\nA lot of Unfrosted probably sounded better while Seinfeld and crew were discussing it over Zoom. Most of it might produce more guffaws if its Cronkite impersonator were handling the delivery.\n\n** (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nLuca Guadagnino’s Challengers swings and lands and swings and misses and misses and lands and repeats. Strengths become flaws as the EDM score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a charge to hear until it isn’t. The non-linear structure of the love triangle provides glimpses of high-powered melodrama, but it’s also distractingly messy in at least equal measure. Where I find no fault was in the performances even if I wish the script from Justin Kuritzkes served them better.\n\nVolleying between 2006 and 2019 and significant points in between, we are introduced to BFF’s Art (Mike Faist) and Patrick (Josh O’Connor) as tennis juniors champs at the US Open. Along with the rest of the sports world, they are smitten by highly touted prospect Tashi (Zendaya) who is biding her going pro jump until the right moment. A late night meeting at a hotel on the day of the boys’ introduction to her provides fireworks that will complicate and influence their dynamic for the next decade plus.\n\nIt is 13 years after that encounter that Art and Patrick, long estranged, hurdle toward a match at a Challenger event. Tashi’s go pro unveiling never came into focus, but she and Art have formed a potent partnership while Patrick’s career has stalled. Flashbacks fill in other pertinent details and haphazardly at times. Despite its 131 minutes of action, characterizations of the players can run frustratingly thin.\n\nTashi seems to hold a lot of power over the gents and Zendaya’s work sells it. She cannot impose her will on the court and strives to do so with those competing on it via other methods. Kudos to the Dune heroine for nailing this unlikable character that should have been more fleshed out. O’Connor and Faist also excel with the former perhaps more of a breakout.\n\nThere’s really no one to root for in Challengers by design as this less than holy trinity think far more about themselves than others. You may find yourself calculating who among them is the worst offender. Guadagnino turns the aforementioned score and soap opera vibes up loudly. It works often as a pure guilty pleasure. By its conclusion, however, I might’ve been laughing at the stylistic flourishes and not with it.\n\n**1/2 (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nFrom Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (the filmmakers known as Radio Silence), Abigail sautés between a crime thriller and vampire tale. It doesn’t completely land that From Dusk til Dawn style jump off and it overstays its welcome. There are lively breaks in the gory repetition and that’s thanks to some quality casting.\n\nThe title character is a young girl (played by Alisha Weir) who we first see practicing her ballet moves in an empty theater. She’s being tailed by six criminals engaged in a snatching plot. They succeed in the abduction, at least theoretically. The mastermind behind the taking (Giancarlo Esposito) provides a creepy old house for them to hold Abigail for 24 hours until the ransom is met. The operation has a strict no real names policy (think Reservoir Dogs), so the group is named after Rat Packers. Melissa Barrera is Joey and she’s tasked with being Abigail’s sole point of contact. We quickly figure out she kidnaps with kindness and is our heroine. She also has a drug problem and might’ve abandoned her son, but she’s rather virtuous compared to the lot.\n\nThat includes former detective Frank (Dan Stevens, clearly having a ball and looking a bit like Bradley Cooper), spoiled brat and computer hacker Sammy (Kathryn Newton), and demented getaway driver Dean (Angus Cloud). Low IQ muscleman Peter (Kevin Durand) and Marine Rickles (Will Catlett) complete the sextet.\n\nThe young captor doesn’t waste much time engaging in mind games with the unwelcome house guests. In what might have been a juicy twist if the trailer and ads hadn’t clearly spelled it out, she’s a bloodsucker who has been around much longer than her appearance suggests. As if that weren’t enough, she has a father whose name sends chills down the spine of those who hear it.\n\nAbigail should be more of a guilty pleasure than it is. There are times when it flourishes. Stevens steals the show while Barrera is saddled with a semi-serious and boring backstory. Some of the exaggerated violence is reminiscent of Radio Silence’s Ready or Not from 2019. That can be a good thing though it’s a reminder that the pic five years ago was superior. Alisha Weir’s performance is certainly a plus as she switches up the cadence of a preteen and a centuries old devourer of souls.\n\nDespite some clever moves, this ultimately stalls in the third act and takes a while to ramp up in the first place. Its bucket of blood falls on the half empty side a little too often.\n\n**1/2 (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nWhen it focuses on snapping the perfect photo, Alex Garland’s Civil War crackles and pops with a tension rivaling the best scary movies. Indeed there is horror to be found in this tale of journalists covering a nation torn apart. It is set in the near future and viewers will bring their own instincts to suss out the political landscape. Garland’s screenplay doesn’t provide the roadmap as a third-term President (Nick Offerman) and his dwindling protective units are being closed in on by separatist groups.\n\nLee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) is a veteran shutterbug who’s seen it all. Almost. Along with colleague Joel (Wagner Moura), they plan a trek to D.C. to witness and document the pending downfall of POTUS. An interview before his demise is the wished for cherry on top. Two others hitch a ride with the Reuters duo – seasoned New York Times reporter Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and newbie cameraperson Jessie (Cailee Spaeny, fresh off her starring role as Priscilla in that biopic).\n\nThe trip to the capital is a bumpy and episodic one, filled with sudden bursts of carnage and odd and often distracting musical needle drops. Lee’s view of documenting the violence is passive in nature. She refuses (at least outwardly) to let emotion overwhelm her. Just the snaps, ma’am. Jessie has to learn that trait. Dunst and Spaeny are precise and effective in portraying the two sides of the equation.\n\nAnother noteworthy performance belongs to Dunst’s husband Jesse Plemons in a one segment role as a militia man deciding whether or not to let the road warriors continue their trip. It is the most suspenseful sequence in a picture with a few of them.\n\nAs mentioned, the details of the governmental breakdown are kept to a minimum and we are left to interpret plenty. There is one episode that frightens in a different way. The group passes through a town where the citizens are willfully uninformed of the chaos surrounding them. What doesn’t kill them makes them stronger in their estimation and it’s an eerie divergence on that particular exit.\n\nWhen the action gets to D.C. in the third act, some energy is lost. The coup is exceedingly well-directed by the maker of Ex Machina and Annihilation (a shoutout especially to the sound designers on Garland’s crew). It just seems like we’ve seen the White House go down in plenty of lesser flicks. Civil War shines brightest when it dwells on the power of the photog in their darkest moments.\n\n*** (out of four)\n\nRate this:"
