        "text": "Here's a pic of the legendary sci-fi author/genius Isaac Asimov, a frequent visitor to our early conventions and quite a character as well! It is amazing that we got to work with him after reading so many of his books.\n\nFrom the \"you never know\" category, here in the middle is \"Young Hercules\" at our Official Hercules/Xena Convention (pictured with his co-stars from that short lived series). He's better known by his real name today: Ryan Gosling, an incredible actor doing wonderful work in feature films.\n\nBack in the heyday of Xena popularity we had the pleasure of meeting some of New Zealand's top talents as they often guested on the series which was filmed in that beautiful country. Left to right: Karl Urban who went onto major stardom as Star Trek's new Dr. McCoy, Kevin Smith, one of our all-time favorite guests, on the verge of international fame when he was killed in a tragic accident, and Danielle Cormack who continues to perform in New Zealand.\n\nFor over two decades we had the pleasure of presenting the country's leading horror fan conventions, Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors with the popular magazine and illustrious editor Tony Timpone. These shows were a breeding ground for up and coming genre talent and that makes us proud. Here, one of the icons of the field, Robert Englund, on stage.\n\nDuring one crazy phase we started manufacturing action figures and selling them in Toys R Us amongst other national retailers. Bruce Lee was probably are most realistic looking figure, but we also had success with Saturday Night Live figures and Drew and Mimi from The Drew Carey Show.\n\nIt had one of the most loyal and passionate fan movements behind it and a gloriously talented cast of performers working with amazing and intelligent scripts. We were delighted to be associated with this incredible and still missed series and it was always a special pleasure to work with star Ben Browder.\n\nWe were ahead of the times back in the 80's with conventions mixing all sorts of fan favorites together. Usually all the different fandoms got along and it is nice to see that Dr. Who is more popular than ever. We were licensees back in the day and worked with many of the earlier Doctors, including, of course, the larger than life Tom Baker.\n\nHere is a scene from a recent Official Star Trek Convention in San Francisco with Brent Spiner on stage speaking to a sold out crowd.\n\nThere was never any guest nicer than the amazing DeForest Kelley who graced our stages many, many times always putting on a warm and entertaining presentation for his legions of dedicated fans. He was just as cool as you would want him to be!\n\nThe only time this ever happened: Three Mr. Spocks on stage, a really special moment\n\nIt all started with a Mr. Spock head: our entry into the world of Star Trek merchandising began full time when we purchased 1,000 of these 35 years ago or so. We still have a few left!\n\nEvery five year anniversary marks a special time to remember for Star Trek fans and our conventions take on an air of a family reunion of long-time fans and the stars we all admire. Sadly we also mark the loss of some of those talents who appeared with us regularly at our events. They are missed.\n\nOne of our most fun to run conventions was The Official TV LAND Convention. Here is the convention store we set up offering goodies to fellow TV fanatics!\n\nThis is pretty cool: Sam Rubin interviewed legendary Larry Hagman at our TV Land Convention, sadly a one-time only gathering, but did we ever enjoy meeting so many of our all-time favorite TV stars!\n\nAnother wonderful moment from the TV Land Convention: here's the hilarious Tim Conway regaling the audience with anecdotes about his career that has spanned decades.\n\nDick Martin, George Schlatter and Alan Sues at the TV Land Convention\n\nHere's an amazing panel we did in LA at the famed Biltmore Hotel: Forry Ackerman, Ray Bradbury, Ray Harryhausen and John Landis!\n\nComic book and entertainment fans owe much to the legendary JACK KIRBY, the revered talent who co-created the Marvel mythology and made many early appearances with us, among his most devoted followers. Although his passing never allowed Jack to see the amazing success of his characters in film we do know that his appearances at conventions always brought down the house!\n\nIt is always great when we can personally thank a performer for an absolutely beautifully done job and that was just the treat when John Noble appeared in Feb. of 2013 wrapping up his epic FRINGE series, one of our all-time favorite shows!\n\nThe beautiful and talented Alfre Woodard graced her stages to reminisce about her appearance in Star Trek as Lily in the movie Star Trek: First Contact, but of course she is best known for being an Academy Award and Grammy nominated actress as well as having an incredible 17 Emmy nominations (winning four).\n\nOur Vegas Star Trek Convention is ALWAYS full of surprises! Sir Patrick Stewart joins William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy in this once in a lifetime moment! We're glad we were there!\n\nHere's some shots of Leonard Nimoy's last convention appearance (courtesy of Paul Harvath), taken at our Chicago 2011 Official STAR TREK Convention. Thank You Leonard for your three decade association with Creation: we've loved every minute of presenting you to your adoring fans (of which we number ourselves!):\n\nLeonard Nimoy's emotional farewell to Star Trek Conventions: 2011 Chicago\n\nThese guys are HILARIOUS on stage together and we love having them at our events: true superstars of the genre: Jonathan Frakes (now busy directing) and Brent Spiner!\n\nWANNA SIT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?!?\n\nFOR ALL RESERVED SEATING TICKETS (everything other than general admission single day or general admission weekend packages) IF YOU WANT TO SIT NEAR FRIENDS YOU MUST ORDER ALL THE TICKETS TOGETHER UNDER ONE ORDER.\n\nPlease make sure to bring ALL of your printed out tickets to the convention as we cannot replace any tickets forgotten or lost. This holds true for all ticket buyers domestic and outside of the United States, as we no longer have a will-call or hold ticket desk. Our convention sites generally have a business office where you can print out your tickets if you have left them home by mistake. Once you present your ticket(s) at registration, photo op areas, or autograph sessions they will be scanned for legitimacy and one-time use only. Thanks!\n\nPlease do not purchase tickets second hand.\n\nThere have been too many people who unfortunately are copying their scannable tickets and reselling them to unsuspecting patrons. We turn away any ticket that comes up SCANNED ALREADY and will let ONLY the first person in.\n\nThe only way to avoid this issue is NOT to buy tickets from anywhere but Creationâs website or at the convention itself at registration.\n\nPlease note: if you have autographs in a package you have purchased you are free to âgiftâ these to other people as long as they have some sort of admission ticket to the convention. Special exclusive events, like the private Gold Session, are for certain packages are should not be resold as the lanyard card and wristband must match for complimentary entrance to these events.\n\nCustomer Support E-Mail: ANY problem you have please write to us at:\n\nand we'll look into it and get right back to you. Thanks!\n\nNOTE: You may buy Photo Op and Autograph tickets before buying an Admission ticket, but you need an Admission ticket in order to use the Photo Op and Autograph tickets. Please buy an Admission ticket as soon as you can as we can never guarantee Admission tickets won't sell out before the show. Join our Free Email list to get updates on ticket availability.\n\nWe know that our attendees graciously like to give gifts on site to our celebrities, but the fact is that the gifts often get left behind due to travel restrictions and we also do not have an adequate means to handle gifts on site so please do not bring any. Therefore we suggest you use this address for gifts for these stars:\n\nc/o Bridge Studios\n\n2400 Boundary Road\n\nBurnaby, BC V5M 3Z3\n\nCanada\n\nONCE UPON A TIME AUCTIONS AT\n\nCREATION'S AUCTION SITE!\n\nONCE UPON A TIME SAN FRANCISCO\n\nThese events and tickets are now available for sale at the convention on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nMEET & GREETS\n\n(#4221) ONCE UPON A TIME SAN FRANCISCO EMILIE DE RAVIN MEET & GREET\n\n(#4222) ONCE UPON A TIME SAN FRANCISCO GIL MCKINNEY MEET & GREET\n\n(#4224) ONCE UPON A TIME SAN FRANCISCO BEVERLEY ELLIOTT âACTING TIPSâ MEET & GREET\n\nEver want an exclusive concierge assigned just to you at a particular Creation Convention.
