        "text": "The Widow's Son in the Windshield\n\nA group of teenagers are driving on the freeway when a skull smashes through their windshield. At the Jeffersonian lab, Brennan tests out a young forensic anthropologist to replace Zack, who has left for Iraq, and she and Cam examine the skull in question. They find it has marks made by human teeth, suggesting cannibalism. The team identifies the victim, a known violin protÃ©gÃ© who disappeared after a concert. On a quest to find out what happened to him, Brennan and Booth go into the field. A trail of suspects leads them to a strange cannibalistic society, and the team must string together a gruesome and cryptic series of crimes - provided that Brennan and Booth can survive the newfound tension between them. Meanwhile, Cam suggests that Angela hire a private investigator to track down her ex-husband so she can annul her previous marriage and marry Hodgins, a task easier said than done."
