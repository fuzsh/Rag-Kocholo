        "text": "Once Upon A Time season 5 started filming last month. The small village of Steveston in South Richmond was again transformed into Storybrooke for a day of filming for episode 1.\n\nThe first scene I came across in downtown Steveston for the 1st day of shooting for Once Upon A Time season 5 in the town involved an odd sight.\n\nGranny's diner had been transformed into a beer garden. whether this is a temporary situation, or permanent was not yet known. More off, was Gabe Khouth as Sneezy wearing an Emma Swan style red jacket & driving the Sheriffs car. He shows up to what appears to be a ribbon cutting ceremony with several other dwarves in attendance including Faustino DiBauda, Mig Macario and maybe others.. I couldn't see the whole scene from where I was, but there was at least 3 or 4 of the dwarves there. Most notably missing was Lee Arenberg.\n\nAfter that scene, the production moved 1/2 block down to an intersection. In the intersection they set up a scene with several cast members including Rebecca Mader, Sean Maguire, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Ginnifer Goodwin, Colin O'Donoghue, Emilie de Ravin and Jared Gilmore.\n\nIn the scene, we see Lana as Regina Mills marching towards Rebecca and Sean as Zelena and Robin Hood. Regina is flanked by several of the locals, Hook, Mary & Dacid, Belle and Henry all follow her to the middle of the street.\n\nIt seems that Zelena has robin captive somehow and demands a wand from Regina for the release of Robin. Regina does whats asked of her, and gives Zelana a wand. Robin is then let go & instantly taken in by Regina to their side of the battle.\n\nZelena proudly waves the wand around, attempting perhaps to create magic or a spell? But its appears to be a fake. Zelena realizes it wont work, but before she can react, Regina moves in & puts a cuff around her arm and seemingly stops Zelena dead in her tracks.\n\nOnce the cast did a couple rehearsals of it, they went back to their trailers & got into wardrobe for the actual filming.\n\nA little while later, the group returned to film the scene in their full wardrobes for the day. By that point, the crowds swelled well over 150 and at times, over 200 people, as the combination of the 1st shoot of the season and nice weather drew a larger than usual crowd. No surprise with the size of the crowd, none of the main cast came over to meet any fans at all this day. while the main cast is becoming less & less receptive of coming over in the past year or so, its rare that NONE of them do. Guess the absurdly large crowd was just too much for any of them to consider.\n\nWhile they were shooting this scene, my battery on my camera died so I left while they were still shooting. so I don't know if more happened in this scene afterwards, but the amount of times they shot this, I doubt it.\n\nyou can follow the stars of Once Upon A Time on Social Media sites\n\nOnce Upon A Time Twitter Facebook\n\nLana Parrilla Twitter Facebook\n\nSean Maguire Twitter\n\nRebecca Mader Twitter Facebook\n\nColin O'Donoghue Twitter Facebook\n\nJosh Dallas Twitter\n\nGinnifer Goodwin Twitter Facebook\n\nEmilie de Ravin Twitter\n\nGabe Khouth Twitter\n\nJared Gilmore Twitter\n\nFaustino Di Bauda Twitter\n\nMig Macario Twitter\n\nOnce Upon A Time returns for season 5 on ABC in the U.S. and on CTV in Canada starting Oct 2015\n\nTHIS BLOG MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS TO SEASON 2 OF ONCE UPON A TIME. DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ OR SEE PHOTOS OF, POSSIBLE SPOILERS.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. LAST WARNING\n\nOn the second day of filming in Steveston, BC. The Storybrooke residents were dealing with the aftermath of the fallout of season 1.\n\nThe streets of Storybrooke looked like a hurricane had ripped thru the small fictional Maine town.\n\nA couple scenes were seen being filmed while I was there. First up Josh Dallas (David/Charming) chased Sebatstian Stan (Jefferson/Mad Hatter) thru the street as Meghan Ory (Ruby/Red Riding Hood) stops him to tell him that Regina is at the root of all the problems there are right now (I am hiding a spoiler that was said in the scene as a courtesy to the show who did state they are displeased with how many big spoilers seem to spill out).\n\nLater, a scene at the hardware store saw the 7 dwarves saw Lee Arenberg (Leroy/Grumpy), David Paul-Grove (Doc), another actor (Happy), Faustina Di Bauda (Sleepy), Mig Macario (Bashful), Jeffrey Kaiser (Dopey) leave the hardware store with a variety of construction materials, as they cross paths with Gabe Khouth (Mr. Clark/Sneezy) who seemed to be not partaking in the groups plan. the group of 6 dwarves goes 1 way as Sneezy stands on a corner watching them head off to work.\n\nSeveral cast members thru the day came over & met with fans. the biggest being when Josh Dallas and Meghan Ory did a meet & greet in the garage area.\n\nAs well, Raphael Sbarge (Jiminy Cricket/Dr. Hopper) also was seen meeting fans, including the wiener dog from the day before that Josh Dallas met, Emma. Emma, an avid licker of faces, decided to take a taste of the doc, Raphael was a terrific sport about it. I caught it frame by frame below. Quite entertaining.\n\nBelow are some pics of the set, filming, and of course interactions with the fans... including, my 1st pics of Sebastian Stan on set."
