        "text": "Hello from Texas!\n\nThat’s right, friends, I’m home for the holidays, and getting here was quite the event. (No wi-fi + planes + trains + automobiles = stress) So I hope you can forgive me for being a day later than normal with your scoop. If you can find it in your heart to pardon me, I invite you to gather ’round the Spoiler Room table for a delicious helping of TV dish!\n\nI hope your Thanksgiving is filled with lots of joy, DVR clearing, and gluten-free pies. And should you find the time/need something to do while hiding from your family, I invite you to send in a question for the next column, which will come out Dec. 3. (Yay, vacation!) Contact info is as usual: spoilerroom@ew.com and @EWSandraG on Twitter.\n\nCHANDRA WILSON ON BAILEY’S FUTURE … AND GREY’S ANATOMY\n\nIf you read my chat with Grey’s Anatomy‘s Chandra Wilson last week, then you know that Bailey will spend the next episodes “kicking and screaming” her way to the altar. But one thing Wilson thinks might help Bailey get into the groove a bit more? If Ben put a ring on it!\n\n“My finger is light, that’s all I’m saying. It’s very, very light,” she says, laughing. “And he used to be an anesthesiologist. You’d think there would be some sort of bling involved. But her finger is rather light — at least for 2012. So we’ll see what happens going forward.” But regardless of Bailey’s left hand gets a little heavier, Wilson says Bailey is committed. “She’s going to see [it] through,” she says. “You can’t tell somebody you’re going to marry them and then play around.”\n\nAnd while Bailey and Ben could have many happy years ahead of them, as always, questions are starting to arise about Grey‘s future. Now midway though its ninth season, Wilson says she is anything but tired. And while there won’t be official word about a tenth season for several months, she says she’s personally on board. “I think the consensus is that as long as our writers want to keep writing, we’re here to keep riding the ride,” she says. “As actors, we’re very cognizant of the opportunities we’ve been given. Sooner or later it will be the end.”\n\nGRIMM: FOUR TEASES!\n\nAs promised by your Grimm recapper Emily Rome, I’ve got some fun dish on the rest of the season for all you Grimmsters! (And if you missed the episode, catch up here.)\n\nONCE UPON A TIME: ‘MAJOR CLIFFHANGER’ IN STORE\n\nEmma and Mary Margaret are coming back! But as Jennifer Morrison teases, everyone stuck in “post-apocalyptic fairytale land” is in for “quite a journey” as David and Henry attempt to bring back the mother-daughter duo. The big issue? How to accomplish selective return! “They’re trying to keep [Cora and Capt. Hook] out,” says Morrison. “It’s like, ‘How do we bring back Emma and Margaret and keep out the other ones?'”\n\nPossibly related? Morrison reports “there will be a pretty major cliffhanger” at the end of episode nine. But before you connect the two, it seems the core four aren’t the only ones with major issues to contend with as season 2 continues. “What I can tell you is that there are some pretty big, explosive things coming for Archie, for sure,” Raphael Sbarge says. “It’s pretty dramatic — that’s what I’ll say. As far as where it goes from there, I believe the Once Upon a Time scripts and the nuclear launch codes are essentially kept in the same location.”\n\nBut one thing we won’t be seeing any time soon is the psychologist giving his take on Henry’s strange, fire-filled dreams. (Seems like a natural fit, don’t you think?) “I don’t have that on my radar yet,” he says “I agree with you that there’s an opportunity there, but we haven’t gotten there yet. With the curse sort of going sideways, I think there’s ample job security for Archie. Everyone’s falling apart!”\n\nSIDE DISHES\n\nHey Sandra. I kind of love Axl’s new girlfriend non The Middle. I think they’ll be good for each other. I was wondering if Sue will be getting a new boyfriend soon? — Amy\n\nHUGE scoop from executive producer Eileen Heisler! “Sue’s magic eight ball says signs point to yes,” she says in response to your question. (!!) And if Sue’s romantic future is as highly entertaining as Axl’s, count me in!\n\nIt’s been a while since we’ve had some Glee scoop. To make it up to me, please make it Klaine-centric! — Lily\n\nYou know how we wanted to know what Blaine was going to tell Kurt in the hallway in last week’s episode? We’ll find out this week, and get the more info on the big cheating incident than we’ve had all season!\n\nWhat’s next for Marley? Is she done with the eating disorder stuff? — Christine\n\nAs you’ll see in Thursday’s episode, Marley’s body issues were not simply your average Glee subject-of-the-week. Bonus tease: There’s another meaning for “WF” and it’s not “woman fierce.” Guesses?\n\nSandra, I’m excited about seeing Bobby Cobb on CSI. Any scoop? — T.\n\nBrian Van Holt is in fine form here as Finn’s ex-husband, whom she crosses paths with while back in Seattle tracking a case that’s quite personal to her. And I can tell you he definitely still shares a spark with his former wife. In fact, I would be surprised if we didn’t see him again eventually. Bonus scoop: We know Finn would go to any length to achieve justice, but is she capable or murder? Noodle that…\n\nI want some Kono scoop! Or something on the H5-0 winter finale! Thanks, Sandra! — Kim\n\nI have both and since I am in a chipper pre-vacation mood, you get a little taste of each: Executive producer Peter Lenkov tells me the episode before the show’s midseason break will be a major “Delano payback story” that will put Chin Ho through the wringer in a big way. And meanwhile, Kono’s going to get thrown a bit of a curveball soon when Adam’s brother is released from prison. “That’s going to cause a little bit of a wrinkle in her world,” teases Lenkov.\n\nPLEASE tell me we’re going to see some major Annie/Auggie action in the Covert Affairs finale\n\nMy lips are actually quite sealed on this one. But I can tell you that you’ll want to visit this very blog (Inside TV) for all the scoop AFTER the finale. In non-shipper scoop: Annie finds herself back at the diner where Jai died and leaves with a new secret to keep.\n\nI’m really enjoying Revolution. I think I’m enjoying it more than I’ve enjoyed any new show in a long time. Any hints on the last new episode of the year? — Ashley\n\nThis shouldn’t shock you too much, but next week’s episode “will be a huge cliffhanger,” teases Billy Burke. But if you’re thinking we’ll learn more about exactly what led to Monroe taking over the lead position in the militia, that story will take a bit longer to reveal, he says. “That might take longer than some of the other plot points are taking,” he says. “But the other stuff is moving along so briskly that I feel like we can afford to hold off on some of that stuff for a while without pissing off the fans.”\n\nCan we get something on NCIS, Person of Interest, or the Mentalist? Your pick. — Ben\n\nMY pick!?! Yay! You are quite the gentleman, Ben! I will counter with a fun guessing game: One of the characters on one of these shows is going to find themselves on the wrong side of the law very soon, and spend at least one episode behind bars. Hit the comments with your guesses\n\nSandra! Can you tell everyone that I LOVE the Sons of Anarchy cover! THANK YOU, EW! — Jeanne\n\nYou’re welcome. (Truth: I had nothing to do with it.) But here’s what I can contribute: In tonight’s episode, you’ll see nice guy Nero embrace his not-so-nice side. Personally, I’ve been waiting all season to see that, and it doesn’t disappoint!\n\nAny Hart of Dixie scoop? — Suzie\n\nLook for Lemon to start a new career path with some unexpected help from George. Meanwhile, Wade is going to make a sweet (but incredibly messy) gesture to show Zoe how much he cares. And before you ask, no, it’s not edible sexy-ware.\n\nLast week’s Big Bang Theory was incredible! I’m so glad this show is doing great. Any scoop? Shamy-related, possibly? — Jessica\n\nWill I get partial credit for scoop from one half of Shamy? Because Mayim Bialik dished to me about an upcoming episode that sounds like barrels of fun. “We did an episode last week where Bernadette and Amy get into a fight and that was a really fun one to shoot,” she dishes. “There was a lot of back and forth in a way we haven’t seen before. It was fun to have a girl fight.” But what could possibly get between those two?!\n\nSandra,I promise you that you’re not the only one weeping through Parenthood! I love EVERYONE on that show, and would love you, too, if you can scrounge up some spoilers. — Patty\n\nSomeone is pregnant — and not happy about it.\n\nCastle! Can you tell me anything about why Castle’s ex comes to stay with him? I can’t wait to see Darby Stanchfield! — Lauren\n\nAlexis comes down with mono, and mom comes to take care of her. So let’s do that math: Sick Alexis + the ex + Martha + Beckett = poor Castle.\n\n(Emily Rome, Gena Oppenheim and Carrie Bell contributed to this column.)"
