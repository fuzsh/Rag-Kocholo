        "text": "He hasn't been seen since season four, but Dr Archie Hopper is now ready to return to the latest instalment of Once Upon a Time.\n\nThe human incarnation of Jiminy Cricket, played by Raphael Sbarge, is heading back to Storybrooke to continue his role as the town's resident shrink.\n\nDr Hopper will appear in the upcoming season premiere and \"is going to find himself a new patient,\" executive producer and co-creator Adam Horowitz has told TVLine.\n\nOnce Upon a Time season six is set to be different than what we've come to expect from the fantasy series in recent episodes.\n\nAlong with the reintroduction of Archie, the plan is to revisit the season one approach \"of small town stories and smaller arcs\", according to executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis.\n\nThey've also told fans to expect more from the Land of Untold Stories.\n\nIntrigued as to who Dr Hopper's next patient will be? Once Upon a Time returns to ABC on September 25, and can be streamed on Netflix in the UK."
