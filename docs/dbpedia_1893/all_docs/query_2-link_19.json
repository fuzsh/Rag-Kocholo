        "text": "Thanks to Philomina for the heads up.\n\n1. Because your parents have been working in show business, do you think you were born into the world of acting? When did you know, that this is the right path for you?\n\nHa! Yes, in a way I was. \"Born in a Trunk\", as they say. My father and mother met at the Yale Drama School; father a playwrighter, mother a costume designer. At 4, by chance, I fell into a job on \"Sesame Street\", in its first year, looking for kids and then up until I was 13, did plays when they needed younger actors at theaters where my mother was designing. At 13 I decided this was what I wanted to do and living in NYC made use of the public transportation (and my bike, I was a big biker!), to get an agent, and go to auditions on my own. I was on Broadway the first time at 16, and kept working through high school, did the movie \"Risky Business\" right after graduation. I never went to college — just kept working. I was a very determined and precocious kid. My mother stood by and encouraged me, but always said that if I did it, I would have to do it on my own, because it is such a difficult road. Now after over 40 years as an actor, while I have been incredibly fortunate and had a wonderful career, I can say: \"Yes. Boy oh boy that is true.\"\n\n2. Do your children love that you are playing a famous fairytale character on \"Once Upon a Time\"?\n\nMy kids are 7 and 9, and LOVE the show. Every Sunday night when it is on, we sit together on the couch and watch it together; such a wonderful thing for me as a dad. I don't know if they get the \"famous fairytale character part\" yet. From their point of view, I think they just love the stories and hey, isn't it fun to have Dad be a part of it. I tell them stories from the set, and they really enjoy them. I know recently I introduced my son, Djano (7) to Lana Parrilla (Evil Queen) at a cast event. She was so sweet to him and he turned BRIGHT red. That was a wonderful moment to see. Ha!\n\n3. Your character Archie doesn't seem to have a clue that he really came from a different world. Do you think he suspects that something isn't how it's supposed to be?\n\nArchie is completely wrapped up in the curse and has no idea. He is working with Henry to try to get him to come to grips with his difficult family life — two mothers, one nice, one not so nice and no real father figure. I truly believe, until we find out otherwise, that Archie is oblivious to the \"other world\". But, let's see how long that lasts...\n\nSource: Full Interview @ myfanbase\n\nStreaming Options"
