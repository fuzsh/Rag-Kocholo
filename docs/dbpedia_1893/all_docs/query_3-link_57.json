        "text": "TVLine has learned exclusively that Once Upon a Time original cast member Raphael Sbarge is set to reprise his role as Jiminy Cricket’s human alter ego, Dr. Archie Hopper, in the ABC drama’s Season 6 premiere — “and our favorite cricket-shrink is going to find himself with a new patient,” says series co-creator Adam Horowitz.\n\nArchie was last seen in the early Season 4 episode “Rocky Road,” as the Frozen storyline was getting underway. Since going on recurring status with the ABC drama, Sbarge has played SFPD homicide inspector David Molk on TNT’s Murder in the First and guested on such series as Hawaii Five-0, iZombie, NCIS: Los Angeles and Better Call Saul.\n\nSource:\n\nStreaming Options"
