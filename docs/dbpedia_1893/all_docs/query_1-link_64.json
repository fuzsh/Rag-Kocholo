Should this podcast be called \"Greetings from Hyperion Heights\" now?\n\n#182 – The Deeper the Crime\n\n(S06E21-22) - Emma’s just crazy (or so she’s been told). A result of a curse from the mother of Gold. She’s stranded the others in Fairytale Land but Henry’s determined to give them a hand. Without Emma’s belief the lands start to crumble, so Henry decides to get help from Rumple. When Gold makes the fairy dust fit for an urn, in a flash the town’s memories start to return. Yet that’s not quite the end, the savior’s vision still stands. It’s Emma v. Gideon for the sake of the lands. Will Emma fight this time? The answer is nope, because she’s determined the true power is hope. As good defeats evil the realms reappear and everyone gets a happy BEGINNING...is that clear? But wait?!? Who’s that girl? Is that Henry? Seattle? We start a new book in this week’s “Final Battle”. We're joined by special guest Bill Meeks!\n\n#181 – La La Fairytale Land\n\n(S06E20) - Snow has made a wish so everybody sings out loud and strong! What could possibly even go wrong. There’s a powerful magic when two hearts combine, but the Evil Queen has another thing in mind! A curse she plans to enact that is true. What will the citizens in the Enchanted Forest do?? They will sing and dance to their heart’s content so that the Evil Queen’s wrath isn’t so hell bent. No evil can pull Emma’s loved ones apart in this week’s episode \"The Song In Your Heart.\"\n\n#180 – The Baby Hunter\n\n(S06E19) - The tale of the Black Fairy is one we haven’t heard. Is she evil or is she good? The lines are certainly getting blurred. Rumple’s dreamworld reveals oh so much as we learn his mother was mortal once. Gideon and Emma help Rumple uncover that his mother always loved him (or so we discover). Rumple’s destiny was to become the savior, yet the shears of destiny cut that off (not doing him any favors). The Black Fairy became who she was to protect her son, a great evil that cannot be undone. Not everything is coming up merry in this week’s episode \"The Black Fairy.\"\n\n#179 – You’re A Big Boy Now\n\n(S06E17) - The Lost Boys have cornered Hook to capture him for what he took. It looked like Tiger Lily was there to save the day, but instead she was mean and put Hook away.. There's a flower that can reunite true love (if it exist), but the Black Fairy wants it all to be in the abyss. The end of The Book is near. War is on the way. Soon, evil is going to be here to stay. Everything is at stake in this week's episode \"Awake.\"\n\n#178 – Return to Neverland\n\n(S06E16) - The Black Fairy is up to an evil plot. What it is we do know not. She took Gideon when he was a baby... Does she really want to be a mother? Well... Uh... Maybe? Regina is trying to break the Evil Queen’s curse, but what happens to Henry may be quite worse. Henry’s eye’s get all freaky, when his Author’s powers go all stinky. So much of this episode is so helter skelter, in this week’s episode \"Mother’s Little Helper.\"\n\n#177 – Just Not That Into You\n\n(S06E15) - Jasmine and Aladdin set out on a quest to find home. Instead they continue to roam. Jasmine search for her land aided by a wish, but what she finds is Ariel (one half fish). Ariel is in Agrabah searching for her prince, but what she discovers is a villain in her midst. Agrabah and a ring. Aladdin and Jasmine's love is in full swing. The land is awoken by their love embrace in this week's episode \"A Wondrous Place.\"\n\n#176 – A New Beginning\n\n(S06E14) - It's the final showdown: Regina vs. Evil Queen! Who will win? Grab your popcorn and your magic juice and let the battle begin. A glimpse into the past reveals who the Queen hates more than Snow White is... Herself!? During the fight, Regina remembers her long self-loathing, decides not to kill the Evil Queen, viewer’s tears are flowing. They now share love and pain, and can move forward from their past, the Evil Queen’s reign is over, which wasn’t a blast. The Evil Queen gets a do-over and where does she go? She gets to be with Robin in the wish world, bravo! The Evil Queen is finally free in this week’s episode \"Page 23\".\n\n#175 – Daddy Issues\n\n(S06E12) - Hook wants Davids blessing for Emma's hand, but will Charming give him the answer he demands? Charming's father appears from the dead to let him know that he's been misled. David's quest leads to his father's killer in this season's epic thriller. Is this there murder on the prowl in this week's \"Murder Most Foul\"?\n\n#174 – Pics Or It Didn’t Happen\n\n(S06E11) Emma and Regina are trapped in a wish. Can they get out, in a dish? Robin’s alive and Hook is fat, can August save them in no time flat? Robin Hood’s life is no epic tale, Regina brings him back on an epic scale! Gideon has grown, and to his mercy Emma’s been thrown. One epic wish has already been granted leaving our heroes all empty handed. Gideon and Emma fight to see who’ the best, but will they find out who’s \"Tougher than the Rest\".\n\nAnnouncing the Gotham Sweetheart Contest Winners!\n\nWe announce the three winners of our GOTHAM SWEETHEART CONTEST! Who will win the three Gotham action figures from Diamond Select Toys? Watch and find out!\n\n#173 – It’s a Swanderful Life\n\n(S06E10) Emma’s wish to have never become the Savior comes true, a wish that David has no idea how to undo. The Evil Queen’s plots are working in her favor, yet what she doesn't count on is Regina becoming braver. Regina ventures into Emma’s wish to save her, it works and Emma finally does remember. Escaping this wish is hard I must confess, when Regina’s true love comes back, what a mess! The first-half of the season is over, but don’t shed a tear, in this week's “Wish You Were Here.\"\n\n#172 – I Learned It From Watching You\n\n(S06E09) Belle follows the strand to her son’s dream land, Emma and Hook are on the chase to see what Rumple has done in this case. Rumbelle’s baby is born in a flash, to save him from Rumple the heroes must make a quick dash. Rumple’s mother is also FINALLY revealed in this week's “Changelings\".\n\n#171 – My Three Moms\n\n(S06E08) - The Charmings are under a Cruel Curse, but throughout six seasons they have been through worse. The evil Queen’s plot is getting clearer in this week's “I’ll Be Your Mirror\".\n\n#170 – The Loverade\n\n(S06E07) - The Evil Queen is trying to steal Snow and Charming’s heart! But she’s trying so desperately to keep them apart! Her plan is so evil and cruel that she doesn’t have anytime to be cool. Her revenge is right within her grasp, but there is something that she needs from the past. The sapling is the only way to stop this evil queen’s plan but Snow and Charming just might have to take a stand. For the Queen has no mercy for these two love birds for she shows her awfulness in this week's \"Heartless\".\n\nUB Special: The Boxies\n\nIt’s time for THE BOXIES! That’s right.

Rumple has taken Storybrooke’s magic to keep Belle’s fate from being so tragic. Henry wants to change up the show. His dad had a plan that only he knows. He’s off to New York while the Charmings realm jump. They encounter a weakling who becomes quite a grump. Regina’s concerned she’ll become evil and use her magic to go straight medieval. Henry kills magic and strands his grandparents. His commitment to cause is so thin it’s transparent. He bothers New Yorkers but makes them believe. The characters in Hyde’s world all start to leave. Our heroes find enemies in the midst of their glory. “Only You” will believe “An Untold Story.”\n\n#164 – Everybody Curses\n\n(S05E21) - Arthur is out of places to flee. Now that he’s dead he’s the new Mr. Smee. They search Hades’ lair for part of the book. Emma must learn to let go of Hook.

Ogres are coming and she won’t do jack. Hades gives Gaston some magical arrows in hopes he’ll put Rumple in the damp barrows. A hero, to Belle, is concerned with compassion.

Despite all the haters Regina is nice, but what is she willing to pay on “The Price”?\n\n#140 – Walk of Shame\n\n(S05E01) - The Dark Swan is here with her greased back new hairdo. She emerges from a black magic oily goo. She wants to avoid the Dark One’s dark calling. With luck her friends might stop her from falling. That’s if they can find her (with the help of a witch). Traveling to realms in a house is her niche. Camelot’s calling. Emma hits the salon. She’s no longer good in this week's \"The Dark Swan\".\n\n#139 – Knights of the Spoiler Party\n\nIt’s all the news, rumors, and trailers you can shake a stick at!

He’s practiced to make his stories more strong. An alternate history is what’s on offer thanks to a pen, some ink, and the author. Heroes are villains and bad guys are good.

The Sorcerer’s revealed in “Operation Mongoose”.\n\nEpisode 123 – Stupid Stupid Stupid Charmings\n\n(S04E21) - Rumple’s heart is black, not dark pink. The one way to fix it involves Author’s ink.
