        "text": "A\n\nnna Lena Rice “Nanny”, 90, an eighteen year resident of West River, MD and previously of Riverdale, MD, died at her home on Thursday, November 9 of natural causes. Born on August 12, 1933 in Lancaster, PA to the late William and Anna Most Ernst of Senzheim Baden Baden, West Germany, Anna enjoyed many German traditions growing up. While her Mom cooked at the local Lancaster Liederkrantz, a German Cultural Club, she was often asked to dress in traditional blouse, skirt and apron known as DIRNDL, while playing the piano. Anna was very active in school receiving certificates for Safety Patrol in 1946 and 1947. Anna attended Catholic High in Lancaster, Pa. She enjoyed high school very much and made many long lasting friends. In 1951 she served on the yearbook committee and got awards for Latin Honor Society, typing and attendance and punctuality. Anna never missed a Catholic High Class reunion. Anna met her future husband, Ron, at a Girl Scout party when Ron was 14 and Anna was 12. He immediately told friends “I’m going to marry that girl.” They dated for about seven years before Ron asked for Anna’s hand. They were married in Saint Joseph’s Catholic Church on June 28, 1952, the same day that Ron took his first Communion and entered the Catholic Church. Anna was a secretary at Armstrong and worked at Hubbly toy factory for a while but was a homemaker most of her life. She and her family moved to Riverdale, MD in 1964 where Anna enjoyed cooking and baking and decorating her new home. She worked hard canning food from the garden and sewing, Anna was in a bowling league for many years, a regular at University of Maryland football games and enjoyed travel with Ron and friends from Pennsylvania. She also enjoyed serving as den mother while her boys were in Boy Scouts. Anna and Ron and the boys enjoyed summer vacations at Crystal Beach and often talked about how much work it was in the early days with no running water and an outhouse, but they had a great time. Ron and Anna spent many joyful years providing daycare to their grandchildren at their home in Riverdale, MD. Anna loved her family dearly and was especially proud of her grandchildren and great grandchildren. Anna was preceded in death by her husband of 61 years, Ronald L. Rice. She is survived by her sons, Ronald and Michael Rice; her sister, Hilda Phelan; her grandchildren, Brian Stephen, Shawn and Shannon Rice and Bridget Snyder and 12 great grandchildren. Family and friends are invited to celebrate Anna's life on Tuesday, November 14 from 11 am until Mass of Christian Burial is offered at 12 pm at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church, 101 Owensville Rd., West River, MD. Interment will follow in the church cemetery. Condolences may be made by using the Memories tab on this page."
