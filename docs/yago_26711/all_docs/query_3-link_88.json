        "text": "I’m so excited to be sharing my recipe for Oyakodon with you all today!\n\nMy dad was born and raised in a small town in Japan called Tsu. He married my mom, who’s from Wisconsin, and together they moved to Minnesota. Growing up, I was lucky to have my dad be the family cook (I love my mom to death, but she can’t cook to save her life). Eating Japanese food was a regular occurrence for me. We went to United Noodle as often as the regular grocery store. Besides ramen, the one dish that reminds me most of my childhood is Oyakodon. A delicious combination of chicken thighs and eggs with a savory-sweet sauce over rice. This dish is easy to make and you may have some of the ingredients in your home already. Itadakimasu!\n\n— ANNA HASHIZUME"
