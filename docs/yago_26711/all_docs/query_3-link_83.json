        "text": "Mānoa Heritage Center\n\nAmos and Juliette Cooke were early missionaries. Amos was half of Castle & Cooke, one of the \"Big Five\". One of his sons became president of Bank of Hawaii and C. Brewer (the latter according to Wikipedia), and married Anna Rice (founder of Honolulu Museum of Art). I believe it was the second generation that enlisted a notable architect of the day to design the house that stands today, constructed 1911.\n\nFor a nominal $7, you can tour the outside grounds and learn about this influential family and Hawaii history. The property includes two structures listed on the national and state historic registers, respectively, a restored agricultural heiau (Kukao'o; heiau is Hawaiian for \"temple\"), and native and ethnobotanical gardens. No entry to the Tudor home. Tours are offered M-F, 9 am - 2:30 pm. Advance reservations required, and book up quickly, so plan ahead. Loved everyone I met there!\n\nKukao'o heiau is said to have been built by menehunes, who controlled all of upper Mānoa until Kuali'i took over. Kuali'i rebuilt the heiau, and I believe it has been restored more than once since. There is a sketch of its shape and more information excerpted from Thrum in \"Archaeology of Oahu\" by J. Gilbert McAllister (1985 reprint of 1933 Bishop Museum Bulletin No. 104).\n\nKukao'o heiau."
