        "text": "Hey friends! Can you believe I’m back here typing on this blog?\n\nI think I’m as shocked as you are!\n\nI actually didn’t plan on this, but my blog ‘broke’ recently (turns out literal years of neglect can break a blog!) which brought me back here trying to fix things.\n\nI may not post much, but I know many of you use this blog still to find your favorite recipes (and I do too!) so it was important to figure out how to fix this.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nThe blog is fixed, so you can find your favorite Sweet Anna’s recipes, and I’m here typing in a space I never knew if I would come back to!\n\nWhat’s been going on these past few years? Oh. My. Stars.\n\nToo much to even begin to spell out here fully, but here is the short-version:\n\nI got divorced 3 years ago (after a year-long separation) and it basically shattered me.\n\nI have spent the last 4 years figuring out WHO I AM, outside of the box I had placed myself in, and I am loving this person I am finding more and more everyday.\n\nThese past 4 years have been everything you would imagine. Divorce is hard. Being a single mom is hard.\n\nBut you know what’s harder?\n\nStaying in a controlling, unhealthy marriage. (That’s all I need to say about that right now. Maybe someday I’ll have more words, for now that part of my life is in the past.)\n\nAnd now?\n\nWell, all that pain and years of struggle have been SO worth where I find myself today.\n\nI met the love of my life a year and a half ago, and in June of 2020, we had a sweet little Corona-style wedding on a pier here in Port Townsend, blending our families into one big beautiful, peaceful mess.\n\nI will share more about our wedding soon, but in the meantime – here’s a wedding selfie of myself and two of my very best friends.\n\nIt was a wonderful day!\n\nSo, I’m back, kindof.\n\nOne of the most difficult/necessary results of my divorce was that it took me out of the kitchen for a season.\n\nThe reasons were many… grocery money being tight, tiny rental-home kitchens… but ultimately I just lost my joy in the kitchen for a bit.\n\nI couldn’t bring myself to put in the effort & devote the energy that I used to.\n\nSlowly but surely, that joy is coming back – having a food-loving husband & kiddos that aren’t tiny anymore definitely helps that – and I am finding my way again.\n\nI can’t promise I’ll be sharing tons of new recipes all of a sudden, but I also can’t imagine that I will be able to stay away forever (I do LOVE to create recipes & share them with you all!) and I’m sure I will be back here sharing pieces of my heart with you in the meantime.\n\nCome say HI on Instagram if you want to connect with me (@annaliseree + @sweetannas).\n\nI seriously love + have missed you all so much!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDIVORCED.\n\nA scary word and a freeing word all in the same breath.\n\nI cried when I signed the final papers yesterday. Ten years of my life, gone in a flash. Seemingly all for nothing.\n\nDONE.\n\nAnd then I steadied myself, breathed in deep, lungs filling slowly until they almost hurt, and sighed a long, fresh-start sigh.\n\nPeace. That is what I feel right now.\n\nPEACE.\n\nHe signed the papers. I signed the papers. The lawyer and judge signed the papers. It’s all over.\n\nDIVORCED.\n\nA new status now defines me. A new box to check on the countless forms that ask for your ‘marital status’. I am no longer ‘Married’, I am not even ‘Single’… I am Divorced.\n\nI AM DIVORCED.\n\nThe more I type that word, see that word, say that word, the weirder it feels.\n\nI am not my experiences. I am not my situation. I am not my ‘marital status’. I am me.\n\nI am the girl God knew before I ever took my first breath on this earth, and I am the one He has big plans for.\n\nWhat are those plans?\n\nI wish I knew. But I’m okay with not knowing. I’m okay.\n\nI AM AT PEACE.\n\nI am not an ‘-ed’ word. I am not an anomaly or a broken, ruined person. I am not his ex.\n\nI am not a lesser version of myself. I am not damaged goods. I am me.\n\nAnd I am exactly who God created me to be. I am done defining myself through the lens of this world.\n\nI AM DONE.\n\nI am a Divorced, Jesus-loving, Mom, Sister, Daughter, Niece, Cousin & Friend.\n\nI am worthy of love, I am capable of love, and I am not broken. I am not defective. I am not damaged.\n\nI AM DIVORCED.\n\nThat has changed me. But it will not define me.\n\nNow you know where I’ve been this past year – those of you who have been following my journey, following this blog, and waiting patiently for me to show my face again. I am here. I am re-learning how to be me.\n\nI am so thankful for each and every one of you. I am so thankful for your love, and concern, your patience and your encouragement through this darkest season of my life so far.\n\nI am OK. I really am.\n\nWhat does the future look like for this blog? What does the future look like for my passions and hobbies and for all of you? I’m not sure.\n\nI’m not sure where my heart is pulling me right now, but I do know that I need a safe place to share my heart and I’m hoping you all will give me grace to use this space right here.\n\nI will share recipes when they are on my heart, but I will also share my stories, my struggles, my triumphs and my joys.\n\nIs that ok? Should I step over someplace new and create a new space for all of that, leaving this blog as is? Even if that means I’m not here much? That would be okay with me. I can do that.\n\nI’d love your input friends. This space is just as much yours as it is mine, and I want it to continue to be a place you want to come. Share your hearts with me friends.\n\nI’m listening.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRich, hearty, incredibly flavorful… and start to finish in under an hour?\n\nYep! This delicious soup tastes like it has been simmering ALL day, and yet it’s quick and easy to throw together in a pinch!\n\nFull of beans, veggies, ham and more flavor than you will believe can come out of a quick-cooked soup, this is a meal you need to try and SOON!\n\nHey friend!! I’m so glad you’re back! I’ve got a great recipe for you today, AND an even better kitchen MUST-HAVE!\n\nHave you gotten your hands on an Instant Pot yet? If you haven’t, you MUST. It will be your new best friend! Especially for summer, when you don’t want to heat up your house with the stove or oven on. (OR, for summer camping… The Instant Pot is the perfect companion for your camper!)\n\nQuick Instant Pot schpiel (is that a word?!)… It is a multi-function cooker that slow cooks, sautés, steams, warms and is a rice cooker, yogurt maker, and most importantly – a pressure cooker! Yep, that thing Grandma used to use on her stove, only MUCH more user-friendly!\n\nI have a good friend who almost exclusively cooks in her Instant Pot for her family of 6, as they currently live in a garage with no kitchen and no running water as they build their new home! How’s that for an Instant Pot commercial?!?\n\nOk, I’ll end this totally UNsponsored commercial with this: I am absolutely head-over-heels in love with this thing. I am planning on getting rid of my other slow cookers and am seriously thinking about getting a second IP, I love it so much!\n\nOh and if you DO have one already… did you know they came out with a huge 8-quart model?! Seriously drooling over here!!\n\nFrom big batches of homemade yogurt with NO-fuss, perfect boiled eggs, hands-off oatmeal, pressure cooked stews and stocks that taste like they have simmered all day, to classic slow-cooked meals – this thing does it all!\n\nBetween the instant pot and your grill, you may never need to turn on your stove this summer. How’s that for awesome!\n\nGrab one (or go grab yours if you’ve already got one!) and get cooking. This simple, delicious and hearty soup is the perfect place to start!\n\nInstant Pot Black Bean & Ham Soup\n\n30 minutes\n\n25 minutes\n\nYield: 6-8 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n2 cups dried black beans\n\n1 tablespoon bacon grease or olive oil\n\n1 large onion, chopped\n\n3 stalks celery, chopped\n\n3 large carrots, chopped\n\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika (or chipotle powder)\n\n1./2 teaspoon ground cumin\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\n\n2 large garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 cups ham, chopped\n\n1 (15oz) can tomato sauce\n\n8 cups chicken stock\n\nfresh chopped parsley - optional\n\ncooked rice, for serving - optional\n\nInstructions\n\nRInse the beans well and pick through for stones/dirt/etc. Set aside.\n\nTurn the Instant Pot onto Sauté, HIGH and let heat while you chop vegetables and ham. Dump in the oil, onion, celery, carrots & the spices and sauté until soft and starting to brown, 5-10 minutes.\n\nStir in the garlic and let cook for 30 seconds and then stir in the rest of the ingredients, including the rinsed beans.\n\n(If you are going to serve this soup with rice, start some now - or use leftovers from a previous dinner if you have any!)\n\nTurn the Instant Pot onto Manual Pressure HIGH for 25 minutes. Let cook and then Natural Release for at least 15 minutes before finishing with a Quick Release if necessary.\n\nTaste for seasoning, adding more salt & pepper if needed, and serve!\n\n0.1\n\nhttp://sweetannas.com/2016/06/instant-pot-black-bean-ham-soup.html\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
