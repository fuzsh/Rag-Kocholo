        "text": "John Bellinger (1923-1989)\n\nAs a star football player at Roosevelt High School, John Bellinger showed signs of the businessman he would become. “He was the only end that I know of, in the history of Hawai’i football, who called all the plays–that tells you a lot about him,” says Walter Dods, chairman of First Hawaiian Bank. A leader, with a big heart.”\n\nBellinger emerged as one of Honolulu’s most powerful executives in an era when the Big Five still dominated local business. He joined First Hawaiian, then known as Bishop National Bank, as a teller in 1942, and quickly worked his way up the corporate ladder. At 45, in 1969, he became the youngest president in the bank’s history. Ten years later, he took over as chairman and CEO.\n\nNot only did he lead the bank through two decades of growth, he set an example with his community service, sitting on numerous boards and raising millions of dollars for such projects as the renovations of the East-West Center’s Imin Conference Center, Kawaiaha’o Church and Palama Settlement. He also co-founded the Hawaiian Open golf tournament, now the Sony Open, in 1965."
