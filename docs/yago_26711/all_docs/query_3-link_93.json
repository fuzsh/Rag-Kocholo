        "text": "This is the MOST comprehensive but easiest way to make rice. You’ll be using a small pot with a cover, water, rice, and that’s it! It doesn’t matter if you cook this over fire or electric stove, just follow the 10-5-5 Rule and you’ll never go back!\n\nTwo years ago, I uploaded a video on Tiktok to show how I make rice. It garnered over a million views and I didn’t expect that many people didn’t know how to make rice on the stove. This blog post is dedicated to everyone who doesn’t have a rice cooker or keeps getting burnt or mushy rice in the pot. I have gone through the comments section on my previous videos, I’ll try to answer all the questions you guys had. Let’s go~\n\nWhat type of rice should I use?\n\nDisclaimer: I get a small commission at no additional cost to you when you make a qualified purchase under the affiliate links.\n\nFor this method, you can use any kind of short or medium-grain white rice. Not colored, not long grain, only regular white rice. Most times, colored rice has an outer layer on it, so it has a different cooking method. For this recipe, let’s stick with the cheapest kind of rice and shoot for the simplest route. I like using Korean brands of medium white rice because they turn out sticky, just how I like it!\n\nHow much rice should I use?\n\nMany people often ask for specific measurements because they do not know how to cook, so I try my best to measure the ingredients in my videos. But for this method, it doesn’t really matter how much rice you use, simply consider that the amount of uncooked rice you use will always double up. Cook only what you need.\n\nIf you insist on using cups, 2.5 to 3 cups of uncooked rice would be good for around 3-4 people, so that would be a better way to look at it.\n\nIn washing the rice, does the temperature of the water matter?\n\nTo begin, rinse the rice three times until the water runs a bit clear. You can rinse it with room-temperature tap water. Some people say not to waste the rice water and use it for your plants, so you can do that too!\n\nDon’t use the colander when washing the rice. You can easily hold the rice and let the water flow. If you wanna do this the easy way, would you honestly use a colander? That’s so hard to wash!!!\n\nTIP: In our restaurant, we make big batches of rice, and we soak them for a whole day to make the rice cook faster. You can soak it for a minimum of 30 minutes before cooking, regardless if you’re using a pot or rice cooker. This will help to evenly and thoroughly cook the rice~\n\nThe Asian Way of Measuring Water and Cooking Rice\n\nIn measuring the water, there are two ways you can do this and it’s how Asians have done it ever since. This method is applicable to both rice cooker bins and stove pots. First, spin your pot to level the uncooked rice then place it on a flat surface.\n\nThe Knuckle Method\n\nLay your hands flat on top of the rice, then measure the water until your knuckles. Do not press the rice, just lay your hands gently on top of it. Hand size for this method does not matter. My hand is bigger than my mom’s but we both use this method and it comes out perfectly every time!\n\nThe Index Finger Method\n\nStick your index finger to the surface of the rice, then measure the water until 3/4 of your index finger.\n\nThe 10-5-5 Rule\n\nThe most basic way to cook this, especially when you do not have a rice cooker, is the 10-5-5 Rule:\n\nLet the rice come to a boil\n\n10 minutes medium-high heat, closed\n\n5 minutes medium-low heat, closed\n\n5 minutes off heat and keep closed to steam\n\nSome tips you need to remember:\n\nDON’T be opening and closing and opening and closing it!! We want to lock the steam as much as possible so that it cooks thoroughly and quickly.\n\nWhen you find that in high heat the steam comes out and the water overflows, turn the heat down a bit but still high enough that it boils and evaporates the water. Know that the strength of each stove varies, so if you’re doing this for the first time, you need to watch out if the heat is too high in the first 10 minutes that it burns your rice. Always adjust the heat as necessary.\n\nIf you prefer rice that is less sticky and drier, you can simply use less water.\n\nI’m out here sharing this method with people who do not know how to cook rice. I’m glad everyone is trying my method and seeing the results!\n\nRice and Real Life\n\nNo matter how easy this is, a rice cooker will always be easier to use and make better rice. It was designed to cook at the right heat, at the right timing, all by itself. I’ve relied on it since Carter came, and it has been super convenient for our family. We can’t deny that!\n\nBut then again, not everyone has a rice cooker since it’s expensive. This literally takes 20 minutes to make and it’s a labor of love. Try it out! I made this very easy and as fast as possible so that you can do it too!\n\nWhy don’t you put seasoning in cooking rice?\n\nHonestly, you can do whatever you want. You can season the rice, you can make one pot of fried rice, and just about any other recipe you have for this! As for me, I don’t season it because plain rice opens up a mountain of possibilities. Plain rice with gochujang, sesame oil, and egg aka Broke Boyz bibimbap is already comforting to me. Here are some more recipes you can make with unseasoned rice:\n\nShrimp Fried Rice\n\nGalbi Fried Rice\n\nKimchi Fried Rice\n\nSpicy Ramen Fried Rice\n\nSteak Fried Rice\n\nOmurice\n\nPair it with some Loco Moco or Ahi Poke\n\nMake some quick snacks like this Kimbap Hack or Fist Ball Rice (Jumeokbap)\n\nHow do I store leftover rice?\n\nIf you have leftover rice, you can just let it cool down then transfer it to a clean container and store it in the fridge for about 4-7 days.\n\nTIP: The secret to the best fried rice is using day-old rice because it has dried out and would fluff beautifully.\n\nTo end this article, my final advice would be: Be patient and trust the process! I’m just out here teaching the basics and once you do it again and again, I’m 100% sure you’ll find your own style and own methods of cooking. And I am all for that kinda growth! Yeobosayo!"
