        "text": "The story of Molokai in the mid-19th century and spanning more than 100 years is synonymous with tales of the Paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy) and life on the ranch. This was cattle country, well before westerners laid claim to the land. High Chief Lot Kapuaiwa (later to become King Kamehameha V) had the capacity and foresight to envision and establish a sheep and cattle ranch on the arid and rugged western half of the island. The land was then given to Princess Ruth Keelikolani at the time of the Great Mahele (division of Hawaiian lands) of 1848. After her passing, the land was bequeathed to the estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the last of the Kamehameha descendants.\n\nIn 1897, a hui (group) of Honolulu businessmen purchased 70,000 acres of this land from Bishop’s estate and leased an additional 30,000 acres from the Government to create Molokai Ranch, Limited. The following year, the American Sugar Company, Limited was incorporated. Here is where the story of the Cooke Family on Molokai begins, 120 years ago, with Charles Montague Cooke as one of the initial investors of the American Sugar Company, Limited.\n\nWhile the prospect of a vast sugar plantation on the fertile soils of Molokai seemed promising, the company’s expectations were dashed by one significant miscalculation: the scarcity of fresh water. In order to irrigate the sugarcane fields, pumps had been installed in the surface wells. These pumps quickly depleted the fresh groundwater supply and proceeded to extract water from the lower water table that had been subjected to salt water intrusion. Needless to say, the high saline content of the irrigation water was not conducive to a successful agricultural industry. The sugarcane seedlings died, and the plantation abandoned.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles M. Cooke’s fourth son, George P. Cooke, had been asked by one of the managing partners of the sugar company to become his assistant manager and bookkeeper. On April 1, 1908, George, his wife Sophie and infant daughter Dora moved to Molokai to live. One cannot underestimate the impact of this relocation on a family of that era, not only physically, but also emotionally. Molokai was an isolated place amid the most geographically isolated chain of islands in the world. In his memoirs, George recounts their arrival there:\n\n“The house to which we were assigned was located at Kualapuu, and had been used by a former manager. It was composed of three plantation houses put together. It leaked badly and was in a dirty condition when we arrived. There was very little water and dust was plentiful. We experienced many of the usual hardships which pioneers undergo, not omitting the loneliness.”\n\nTo make matters worse, that year was marked by a severe drought that saw the loss of upwards of 500 heads of cattle, which had succumbed to thirst and starvation. As the calamities mounted, the partners of Molokai Ranch could find no other solution than to immediately cut their losses and sell the ranch. They turned to Charles M. Cooke as a potential buyer, offering their shares of stock to him at a deeply discounted rate. Not averse to risk-taking, he accepted the offer and by December of that year, the controlling interest of Molokai Ranch transferred to Charles M. Cooke, Limited. With George as the newly appointed manager, Molokai Ranch embarked on a brand-new course. There was debt that needed to be repaid from the failed sugar plantation. New sources of fresh water and aquifers needed to be identified and developed. There were new buildings to be constructed and infrastructure to be planned. They partnered with the U.S. Experiment Station in Honolulu to find suitable crops that could be raised there, thus diversifying the ranch activities. Some of their attempts included growing multiple varieties of corn, wheat and cotton. Colonies of bees were transported from Honolulu and honey production flourished. In 1910, the trade name “ASCO” (from the American Sugar Company) was copyrighted as a means of marketing the honey for export. The raising of cattle and other livestock expanded. There were even attempts at dairy farming. And then, beginning in 1923 and lasting more than 60 years, pineapple became king when Molokai Ranch leased several thousand acres of land to the Libby and Del Monte companies for pineapple cultivation.\n\nLife is not only about commerce and capitalism, and the island of Molokai holds a tender place in the hearts of generations of Cookes. It was a haven and sanctuary; a welcomed respite from cosmopolitan Honolulu. There are endless tales and memories of Molokai from all branches of the family, where cousins spent summers working, playing, sharing stories and simply connecting with the land that brought them together. George Cooke and his brother Clarence were instrumental in counseling Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, Hawaii’s delegate to Congress, to advocate for passage of the 1921 Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, restoring Hawaii’s people to the land. The “best grazing land” on Molokai Ranch which had been leased from the Government, became homestead land. Water resource development, management, and conservation were always a priority for Molokai Ranch. George met with and advised the homesteaders in best practices related to these matters.\n\nOn April 4, 1948, forty years and three days after his arrival on Molokai, George Cooke retired as general manager of Molokai Ranch, Limited. Almost 2,000 people attended the Ahaaina (literally “gathering for a meal,” figuratively “huge feast or party”) to celebrate the momentous occasion and to show their love, affection and admiration for Mr. Cooke. In the ensuing years, other Cooke family members continued to be involved with ranch activities, both in its management and serving on the Board of Directors. The Cooke family’s financial interest in Molokai Ranch came to an end in 1986, when a foreign investment company purchased the ranch. Soon thereafter, Del Monte closed its pineapple plantation, and Molokai Ranch began to pursue real estate development ventures, adopting the corporate name of Molokai Properties, Limited. After their repeated and unsuccessful attempts at creating a subdivision of multi-million dollar homes, Molokai Properties abandoned those plans, and Molokai Ranch ceased operations for good in 2008.\n\nIn recent years, the engagement of the Cooke family on Molokai has shifted to philanthropic work, principally through the auspices of the Cooke Foundation, Limited, and other organizations with family involvement. The Foundation has been a significant and consistent source of support for Molokai Land Trust, one of the most active conservation organizations on the island since 2006. With financial support from the Cooke Foundation, Molokai Land Trust was able to establish vital relationships with The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services, State of Hawaii DLNR and other important partners. Samuel A. Cooke, the Foundation’s past President and Trustee for nearly 40 years, was founding chairman of the Board of Governors for the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. In that capacity, he led campaigns that raised upwards of $15 million to secure and protect more than 50,000 acres of key conservation lands on Molokai, including the Moomomi shoreline preserve and mauka watershed. Molokai Land Trust functions as the steward for much of these lands today. Members of the Cooke family continue to live full-time on Molokai. Richard A. Cooke III, affectionately known as “Rikki,” was a founding member of Molokai Land Trust, served as its President for the past 10 years and has called Molokai home for decades. Rikki and his wife Bronwyn are also the founders of Hui Hoolana, a non-profit organization dedicated to work in spiritual healing practices, education and the creative arts on Molokai. Other examples of Cooke Foundation charitable grants to projects on Molokai include sponsoring music education in the public schools through Chamber Music Hawaii’s music residency programs, assisting the Alakaina Foundation’s “Molokai Digital Bus Program” reaching more than 400 students annually, and providing funding to Molokai General Hospital. The Cooke Foundation is committed to continuing its legacy of support for the people of Molokai.\n\nHawaiian mythology speaks of Molokai as the child of Hina, goddess of the moon and weaver of the clouds. History has shown that the island’s resources are limited and the responsibility is now ours, to care for her great child."
