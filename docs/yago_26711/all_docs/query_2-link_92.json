        "text": "THE CHIEFS’ CHILDREN’S SCHOOL.\n\nThis is the schoolhouse for the children of the alii, in Honolulu, Oahu, upland of the stone house of Kekauluohi. This schoolhouse was built by the alii in the year of our Lord 1839. They are the ones who paid for the costs, not the missionaries. The costs were perhaps two thousand dollars, and the cost was well worth this fine building. The alii paid out the money and the missionaries hired the haole and Hawaiians who did the labor. Above, you will see what this building is like. The length is the same as the width. It is 76 feet long, and so is its width. It is made with adobe, and its walls are about ten feet tall, and its thickness is two feet. The partitions are made of adobe as well and are one foot thick. The thatching of this building is actual pili grass. Look at the illustration above, the entrance is made clear, as are the other doors, and the…\n\n(Nonanona, 7/20/1841, p. 5)\n\n…windows; clear also are the rooms for the teachers and the students.\n\nThere is an open space in the middle of the building; it is six feet wide and so too is the length; there is a water pump within it. Maniania [Manienie] grass grows there, so it is a nice place to play as well as to sit. There is a small lanai and a stone wall surrounding this wide area, which is a place to go when it is raining or when the sun is hot. The outside of the entire building is covered with mortar [poho]. Poho is not great; it will just fall off, and it soon loses its integrity. The inside of the building is covered with plaster [puna], and it is very good and sturdy; the children cannot make the plaster fall easily. The rooms are plastered all around and on top, and there is a fine floor below.\n\nThe building is appropriate for what we are using it for.\n\nThere are perhaps many who have heard of this schoolhouse but who have not seen it. Therefore, the instructors thought to put a description in this paper, as well as what is being done in this schoolhouse in later issues of the newspaper.\n\nBy me, Cooke.\n\n[Maybe if the Hawaiian-Language Newspapers like this one are rescanned clearly, the image of the schoolhouse would indeed be clear and we could see the doors, windows, and rooms.\n\nI was not sure if “Rumi kalo” could refer to a “Taro room”. And it seems that at the center on the bottom of the diagram is “Puka komo” for “Entrance”.]\n\n(Nonanona, 7/20/1841, p. 6)\n\nSchools and Seminaries.—In the very important point of providing instruction for all classes, as in every other duty connected with their sacred calling, the missionaries stand prominent. With them, I believe, resides the merit of having excited the chiefs to desire a school for the systematic education of their children of both sexes. With the concurrence of the king and chiefs, in 1839, the American mission selected for that purpose Mr. & Mrs. Cooke, who were assistant missionaries. Having lately at the request of Dr. Judd, visited the school daily, to watch the progress of a disease, bearing more resemblance to the “typhus mitior” of “Cullen,” than any other known types of fever, I have been an eye-witness to the anxious and parental-like care of Mr. & Mrs. Cooke, both of the sick and healthy children of the chiefs; and I am prepared to state from observation, that a more proper selection could not have been made.\n\nThe school-room is very commodiously arranged. Strict order and obedience are observed, without any exertion of authority approaching to harshness. Books, maps, stationery, gloves (terrestrial and celestial,) are at all times within the access of the scholars, and there is an excellent apparatus to illustrate the movements of the planets which compose our solar system.\n\n(Friend, August 1, 1844, p. 35)\n\nThe following is a list of the young chiefs at present in the school of Mr. and Mrs. Cooke:\n\nNAMES.

(Now convalescing from fever.)\n\n‖Convalescing from fever—(25th May.)\n\n§Heir apparent to the premiership.\n\n¶Half-sister of Abigail.\n\n**The premier.\n\nNor do Mr. & Mrs. Cooke neglect to impress upon their pupils that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and religion the basis of all private and public worth. A portion of scripture is read morning and evening, with singing and prayer, in the presbyterian form of family worship.\n\nOn Sundays, the pupils regularly attend two services in native, by the Rev. Mr. Armstrong, and one in English, by the Rev. Mr. Damon.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Cooke, both by precept and the example of their own well regulated family, enforce the utmost propriety of moral deportment, and every punctilio of cleanliness, dress, manner and address, calculated to add the polish of refinement to more solid and useful attainments.\n\nThe pupils rise with the sun, breakfast at 7 A. M., dine at 1 o’clock, take tea at 6 P. M., and retire early to rest. At table, Mr. and Mrs. Cooke always preside, and there is an abundant supply of good and substantial food.¹\n\nThe school hours are from 9 to 12 A. M., and from 2 to 5 P. M.\n\nThe medical care of the pupils has devolved upon Dr. G. P. Judd, who not withstanding his onerous and multifarious duties as secretary of state for foreign affairs, head of the financial department, &c., &c., always finds time to attend, when wanted. i myself have been an eye-witness of the extreme anxiety and tenderness with which he watched the progress of the fever of little William, whose symptoms were, for several weeks, very alarming. And it is but right I should add that his good and exemplary lady was a frequent visitor at the bed-side of the sick child.\n\nIt is impossible, in any part of the world, that sick children could have been better looked after, than were William, Lot and Jane, by Dr. Judd, and Mr. and Mrs. Cooke, whether as regards the curative or nursing department.\n\nAmongst other things pleasing to observe, was the great concern and affection of the parents, especially in the case of William, who was the only one in real danger.\n\nThe pupils are encouraged in the gymnastical exercises which tend to develop the physical powers and fortify the constitution. Among these are playing ball, flying kites, cultivation of flowers, swinging, see-sawing, walking, and riding on horseback.\n\nTo me it is a most pleasing scene to see them all, boys and girls, well attired and well mounted, merry and good humored, curvetting, galloping and turning round their horses with great dexterity. This pleasure I have, almost every evening during my rides, as I seldom fail to meet and ride on part of my way with them.\n\nWhen Admiral Thomas was here, he was always glad to see them at his house, and to encourage them to go out to tea-parties at the houses of respectable foreign residents here. I have thus met the young chiefs often in society, and I have always found that they support their part in the conversation, in English, with much decorum and propriety. In fact, there is nothing perceptible in their manner or habits that could strike a stranger as differing much from the manners and habits of young English or Americans of the same age.\n\nEach child or pupil has from two to six native attendants, namely: tailors, washers, grooms, &c., according to the age, rank and sex of each; and these are all under the direction of John Ii and his wife, both most respectable natives, who cooperate with Mr. and Mrs. Cooke in excluding these attendants from any intercourse of intimacy with the young chiefs that could communicate to them their own vices, prejudices and superstitions.\n\nMr. Cooke assures me that in every department of education, they show a readiness and docility quite equal to any other children, of the same ages, and under the same circumstances.\n\nIf is evident that under his and Mrs. Cooke’s tuition, these young chiefs will go forth into the world and assume their respective stations, having a fund of general knowledge vastly superior to what is sometimes found in the riders of extensive provinces, and even some republics in Spanish America. It is equally obvious that the administration of these future rulers must be immeasurably more enlightened than any that has ever before existed in these islands; and when they come into power, a new and better order of things may be expected.\n\nThis most useful institution, fraught with so many blessings present and prospective, temporal and spiritual, is supported at an expense to the government of about $2000 yearly. This is all that is allowed to Mr. and Mrs. Cooke, for their own salaries, for finding the table, domestics and all incidental expenses. To me it is incomprehensible how they can do so much, with so little.\n\nThe clothing is found by the parents or guardians of the pupils. It is supplied in abundance and good taste.\n\nSeparate rooms are provided for every two of the pupils; and the apartments are clean, well furnished and well ventilated. There are in all 17 rooms of various dimensions, opening into a court 36 feet square, with windows on the outside, which is 76 feet square. The whole building cost originally little more than $2000, though it is solidly constructed with sun-dried bricks (adobes) with a well thatched roof. But the furniture must have cost a great deal, as no comfort, in that respect, that can be imagined, is wanting.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Dibble says that the king, when surveying the happy group, and noticing their improvement, remarked: “I wish my lot had been like yours; I deeply regret the foolish manner in which I spent the years of my youth;” and I would venture to add, that the king has more reason to be proud of this chiefs’ school than of any thing within his dominion.\n\n(Friend, August 1, 1844, p. 36)\n\n¹This comment about the abundance of food reminded me of something Liliuokalani said in Hawaii’s Story by Hawaii’s Queen. “…our instructors were especially particular to teach us the proper use of the English language; but when I recall the instances in which we were sent hungry to bed, it seems to me that they failed to remember that we were growing children. A thick slice of bread covered with molasses was usually the sole article of our supper, and we were sometimes ingenious, if not over honest, in our search for food: if we could beg something of the cook it was the easier way; but if not, anything eatable left within our reach was surely confiscated. As a last resort, we were not above searching the gardens for any esculent root or leaf, which (having inherited the art of igniting a fire from the friction of sticks), we could cook and consume without the knowledge of our preceptors.”\n\nSpeaking of Hawaii’s Story by Hawaii’s Queen, i was expecting the new much-awaited edition to be available already, but hopefully it will be out in bookstores soon! I am thinking of putting up related articles like this one (mostly from the Hawaiian-Language Newspapers) to perhaps give a fuller picture of topics covered in the Queen’s book.\n\n[This is written by Robert Crichton Wyllie, and is found in a very enlightening treatise describing many aspects of life in Honolulu in the 1840s. “NOTE On the Shipping, Trade, Agriculture, Climate, Diseases, Religious Institutions, Civil and Social Conditions, Mercantile and Financial Policy of the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands, viewed in relation to other groups of islands, and to the natural and acquired advantages of the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands.” Friend, June 1–September 24, 1844.]"
