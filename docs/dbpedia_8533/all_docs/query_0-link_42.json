        "text": "Black also claims that \"Millions of punch cards were routinely shipped from IBM in America directly to Nazi-controlled sources in Poland, France, Bulgaria and Belgium.\" This information was revealed in a Justice Department investigation of IBM for trading with the enemy. The investigation was eventually dropped, although Black maintains that this was in part because of Watson's close ties to President Roosevelt and in part because the U.S. government was dependent on IBM equipment and technology for the prosecution of the war.\n\nThis book has its flaws. Black tends to overwrite and has included a fair amount of extraneous material. More importantly, it would have been helpful if the book had made some attempt to provide context for IBM's decision to continue close relations with its subsidiaries. Were there other subsidiaries of American companies that were deemed vital to the German war effort? If so, how did their parent companies handle the situation? Were there similarly situated companies who refused to cooperate with the Nazis? If so, what were their rationales and the effects of their decisions?\n\nIt is also unclear what would have happened if the Germans had not had IBM technology and equipment at their disposal. In Rwanda not long ago, nearly a million people were massacred with hoes and similar tools, so probably some version of the Holocaust would have taken place regardless of the sophistication of available technology. It is clear, however, that the technology was deemed highly valuable by the Germans themselves, and was widely used by other countries to conduct censuses and organize information and resources.\n\nBlack does establish that IBM benefited tremendously from its subsidiaries' relationships with the Nazis, both in terms of actual profits during the war years and in terms of the competitive advantage that it derived from being firmly entrenched in newly liberated Europe. Clearly, Watson and his aides acted in the best interests of their company. Black's book, together with a recently filed lawsuit against IBM, will help clarify the effects of their actions on their species.\n\n[ North Bay | MetroActive Central | Archives ]"
