He volunteers as a scout leader in Tarleton, connecting with families from all backgrounds.\n\nEdwin believes in the urgent need for political change. He will prioritise the wellbeing of people and the environment over divisive culture wars and unsustainable economic growth, especially in the face of climate change.\n\nHe criticises more than a decade of cuts to public services under Conservative-led governments. Edwin promises to restore and improve these services, taking them back from the private sector and investing in green initiatives that create local jobs.\n\n\"So many of our public services are on their knees and none of the major parties have offered any real, fresh policies to address this.\n\n\"Our coastline and rivers are being pumped full of sewage at unprecedented levels, housing has become completely unaffordable for many and not enough social housing is being built to address this, living standards have fallen for a large proportion of the population, and the necessary action to tackle climate change is not being taken.\n\n\"Only the Green Party will fund the transformative change that is needed, putting the burden on the broadest shoulders by increasing taxes on the ultra-wealthy rather than putting more pressure on working people.\"\n\nEdwin is urging voters to seize this opportunity to build a fairer, greener future for Southport and West Lancashire. He promises to represent the community with integrity, passion and respect.\n\nVote Green for Real hope. Real Change.\n\nPromoted by David Newman on behalf of Edwin Black, both of 86 Park Road, Southport, PR9 9JL\n\nYou may comment here but news always gets more discussion at our facebook.com/groups/southportnews\n\nUseful links: Report Cyber Crime | Stop Nuisance Calls & Mail | Daily Covid Stats (updated 4pm) | Covid excess deaths in your area | Local NHS Resources | What 3 Words\n\nThe PNP liked this post\n\nWANTED: YOUR NEWS AND STORIES FOR SOUTHPORT\n\nEmail local news to us including image(s) southport@qlocal.co.uk\n\nFollow / Report to us on Twitter @SouthportQlocal\n\nFollow / Comment with us on Facebook qlocalsouthport\n\nCheck Todays Deals on Ebay.co.uk Check Todays Deals On Amazon.co.uk\n\nYour Comments:\n\nWill you be getting out the begging bowl like that louse Halsall?\n\nCustom Search\n\nSearch Qlocal (powered by google)\n\nUser Control Panel\n\nNot a Member?
