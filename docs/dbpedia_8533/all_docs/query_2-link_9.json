        "text": "Temple Shalom was filled on Monday night with residents eager to hear the award-winning author Edwin Black’s presentation on his new book “Israel and International Law: The Historical Underpinnings.”\n\nBlack outlined that his talk was to “dispel the disinformation” that people were receiving about the Middle East, Israel and the War on Gaza. He emphasized that every piece of information in his presentation was from the internet and sources that could be found by “just typing a few words into Google or Chrome.”\n\n“One of the things you have to understand is that people feel they can say a false statement long enough and that you won’t be smart enough to know what’s going on,” said Black. “That all ends tonight.”\n\nThe presentation began with the origins of the Palestinians as the Philistia in ancient Israel. Black then traced the history of groups living in Israel to the present-day War on Gaza, clearing up misconceptions about Israel along the way.\n\nOne of these misconceptions, he said, was that Israel had been brought before the Court of International Justice, which Black said was “just an arbitration court for contracts and border disputes.”\n\n“There’s no prosecutor for the International Court of Justice, it can’t be confused with … the International Criminal Court,” noted Black. “Taking Israel to the International Court of Justice is like going to traffic court. They have no prosecutor, they have no investigation. If Israel is violating some international law, someone needs to tell me which one it is.”\n\nAfter the presentation, Black fielded questions from the audience. One attendee wondered what would be the solution and answer for Israel and Palestine leadership that would bring peace to the area.\n\nBlack noted there was a fundamental difference between how Americans and Arabs view peace. He explained Arabic people use the word “hudna,” which means truce.\n\n“Hudna is the pause between the wars,” said Black. “What every Arab scholar knows is that while we are working on what we do now, the Arabs have a mentality called ‘strong horse.’ They don’t make peace with the weaklings, they make peace with the strong horse. That is why Saudi Arabia even now wants to make peace with Israel.”\n\nBlack went on to explain that the terrorist group Hamas, who attacked Israel on Oct. 7, was “following the scorched earth policies” of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany.\n\n“Israel is going to root out Hamas, and it’s going to go wherever it needs to go, and the remnants that remain will agree to live in peace (and) will reformulate their society the way Germany did after the collapse of the Third Reich in Berlin,” added Black.\n\nRabbi Joshua Lief of Temple Shalom emphasized after the presentation that “none of what Black put forward is a secret,” and added that the historical events and documents Black presented could be understood.\n\n“When people in the modern world try and spin a story, it is the responsibility of all of us to be informed consumers of the news, not just passive consumers believing whatever someone else says because everyone has their own biases,” said Lief. “Everyone has their own opinions, but the ideas, especially the historical documents that Mr. Black referenced, are all knowable things. It’s our responsibility to be more knowledgeable.”\n\nTo see the large turnout at the event emphasized for Lief that the Wheeling community wants to be more knowledgeable.\n\n“From a position of our Jewish community, we’ve been a part of this city for 175 years, and our friends and neighbors know us, but they may not realize the full depth of how the events that seem to be taking place on the opposite side of the world do affect those of us living right here in Wheeling,” noted Lief. “They are things that ought to affect every well-intentioned person to care about justice and decency. I hope very soon Hamas will be defeated and that the Palestinian civilians and their Israeli neighbors can live together in peace.”"
