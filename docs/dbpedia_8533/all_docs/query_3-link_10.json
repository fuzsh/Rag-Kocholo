        "text": "You must fill out:\n\nThe complete details of the Offering and Receiving parties;\n\nThe Internet number resources to be transferred (paragraph II)\n\nFor temporary transfers, specify the end date in paragraph 1 (for permanent transfers, leave this paragraph as it is)\n\nThe Transfer Agreement must be signed by a company director or other party legally authorised to make such decisions on behalf of the organisation.\n\nPlease submit the company registration papers in which the names of the company director(s) are documented. You can attach extracts from the Trade Registry (Chamber of Commerce) to clarify who can represent the company.\n\nIf the Transfer Agreement is signed by someone other than the authorised person referenced in the company's registration document, then you must provide documents confirming the powers of the signee (e.g. a Power of Attorney issued by the company's director for the signee).\n\nThese checks are applicable for every transfer request to ensure that the authority of the signing person is still valid. This includes subsequent transfer requests submitted by the same member."
