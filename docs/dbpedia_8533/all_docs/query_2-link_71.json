        "text": "Many of our readings this term have centered on questions of disciplinary identity, taking up Wichelns’s effort to carve a distinct space for rhetorical criticism. In “The Practice of Rhetorical Criticism,” for instance, Edwin Black argues that, while “rhetorical discourses can be culled for many purposes other than understanding how they work,” criticism should have “no relationship with its subject other than to account for how that subject works” (104). In other words, Black contends that rhetorical criticism should only create knowledge about how a text operates, a sentiment echoed in “The Perils of Criticism” as Reid urges critics to not “produce treatises upon politics, religion, historical movements, military strategy, and what not” (41). This concern about the nature of rhetorical criticism pervades this week’s readings, as each articulates a critical method or scope unique to rhetorical studies. Even as all of the readings explicitly or implicitly posit a distinctive rhetorical criticism, however, their visions can produce knowledge that might be classified as the province of another discipline.\n\nSpecifically, each of this week’s readings demonstrates that criticism more often than not offers insights about politics, history, and society, exceeding the judicial or analytical role elevated in many of the texts we’ve studied. Edwin Black’s “The Practice of Rhetorical Criticism” makes this tendency clear: In the excerpt from Rhetorical Criticism, Black argues that a neo-Aristotelian criticism cannot successfully appraise a text like Chapman’s address at Coatesville, since the speech had a small audience and little is known about its reception. Despite that these conditions may not make Chapman’s speech worthy of study in a neo-Aristotelian frame, Black argues that the text’s later prominence warrants its consideration.\n\nTo examine Chapman’s speech, Black seeks not to understand the text in its immediate rhetorical context (as he argues the dominant neo-Aristotelian paradigm would privilege) but situates it instead in a wider cultural conversation “participated in by Jefferson, Tocqueville, Lincoln, Melville, Henry Adams, Samuel Clemons, Santayana, and Faulkner—a dialogue on the moral dimension of the American experience” (83-4). Approaching the text from outside the bounds of what Black sees as a controlling disciplinary frame, he portrays Chapman as an orator who offers insight into the cultural history of the U.S. By viewing the text as participant in a wider intellectual tradition, then, Black’s judgment of Chapman’s speech yields knowledge about American society and politics that might be said to fall outside the parameters of judicial or analytic criticism.\n\nIn some way, each of the other readings similarly advocates criticism that can be said to create interdisciplinary knowledge. As Mohrmann urges an adherence to the traditional scope of rhetorical studies, he also goes beyond a goal of “understand[ing] and appreciat[ing] the text and texture of messages” (137), evident in his suggestion that criticism “can tell us more than a little about Western civilization” (136). Here, rhetorical criticism again constructs knowledge about not only text but context, yielding historical and cultural insight. Likewise, this tendency arises in Baskerville’s and Lucas’s interventions into disagreement about the methods, scope, and aims of critical and historical scholarship. As Baskerville strives to maintain the legitimacy of studies in rhetorical history, he claims that such work not only enables strong criticism but also records “accurately and artistically the history of our art as it relates to more general history, to delineate its place in and contribution to the cultural history of our nation” (127). In a more explicit manner, Lucas points out that critical scholarship always creates historical knowledge (160), even when critics articulate a judicial or analytic role for their work.\n\nBurke’s “The Rhetoric of Hitler’s ‘Battle’” provides perhaps the clearest example of how rhetorical studies regularly occupies a space between disciplinary lines. Burke claims that his purpose is to understand Hitler’s persuasive power so as to “forestall the concocting of similar medicine in America” (33). Throughout the text, though, Burke not only examines Hitler’s rhetoric but also defines the social mood of Germany that made Hitler psychologically appealing and theorizes the importance of unity in forming a political people. In many ways, Burke’s text—and the others we read for this week—seem to echo Wrage’s assertion that rhetoric can play an important role in the history of ideas. Yet, despite this tendency for criticism to yield extra- and interdisciplinary knowledge, such insight is gained through methods that are distinctly rhetorical (inasmuch as they in some way afford primacy to the examination of discourse). In repeatedly demonstrating that criticism regularly contributes to various disciplinary knowledges—even as it narrows its gaze to what it considers to be “rhetorical texts”—these essays reveal the difficulty of maintaining solely judicial or analytic goals and invite an articulation of rhetorical studies that champions its ability to create diverse types of insight.\n\n-Tom McNamara"
