He is the head of NOMAD and rules the criminal underworld (particularly the supernatural side). He is also known as the primal vampire, and the father of Shinganji Kurenai and Felicia.\n\nBlack also is responsible for the creation of the Taimanin Asagi ZERO timeline. As a being that has seen multiple universes, he has advanced knowledge about the Aion and the Mother Sea.\n\nHe is voiced by Norio Wakamoto, who also voiced Charles zi Britannia, Cell, and Nobunaga Oda.\n\nBiography[]\n\nTaimanin Asagi[]\n\nA lot of mystery still is around Edwin Black, at some point in his life he created the organization NOMAD and created Oboro as a proxy for him to stay in the shadows. He had two known children, Shinganji Kurenai and Felicia. He founded NOMAD at some point in his life with the goal to get to Asagi and make his vision for the Demon and Human realms possible.\n\nHe was the real owner of the Chaos Arena in Taimanin Asagi and ordered one of the Oboro clones be made to act as an executive there, observing Asagi's fights with interest.\n\nHe tries to gain access to the research of Ryuumon in Taimanin Asagi 2, but is badly hurt by Oboro's weapon Saya. Hiding within the demon Sokushitsuki, he fights against Asagi and later switches to Yatsu Kurou. He later infiltrates Ryuumon with the now vampiric Oboro, to kill the Oboro clone and take the research done by Ryuumon for himself.\n\nIn Taimanin Asagi 3, he is responsible for the death of Koukawa Oboro and for the reviving of Igawa Sakura and Yatsu Murasaki as demons. Using his false identity as the Prime Minister of Japan, Asai Koujirou he deals with the UFS and is responsible for the raid on Gosha Village.\n\nIn the true ending, he fails to fuse with Asagiand is is defeated in a final fight against Asuka and Asagi.\n\nHowever, should he be \"killed\" by Kage Asagi in the bad ending of Taimanin Asagi 3's Vampire route, his ability resets the universe and the Taimanin Asagi ZERO universe is created.\n\nTaimanin Asagi ZERO[]\n\nFusing with the bad end route Asagi, he and Asagi exist within a single body, able to switch. He wants the Asagi of the new universe as a vessel for Vampire Asagi. For her to have her own body, he uses the NOMAD and the Chaos Arena of the new world. Kaliya the leader of this Chaos Arena doesn't understand this new fixation with Asagi, creating an almost silent revolt against his wishes. Edwin Black meets up with these worlds Koukawa Oboro corrupts her body, with a street thug, and uses her body to interact with the events more directly.\n\nOVAs[]\n\nBlack has similar appearances to the games within the Taimanin Asagi OVAs. Being shown in the background mostly, allowing Asagi to flee the Chaos Arena unhindered. In the OVA for the first game, after she defeated Oboro. Asagi asking him what his objective is, but he refuses to answer, only saying that humans with their limited lives, are not worth the answer however if Asagi should obtain immortality, he might tell her another time.\n\nIn the OVA for Taimanin Asagi 3, he is be seen leaving disappointed, after Asagi tries to hit him with a sneak attack defeating her with no trouble, telling Oboro to do what she wants with her.\n\nThe most \"good\" version of him shows up, in the strongly changed story of Hell Knight Ingrid, in which he teams up with Yatsu Kurou to defeat Kiryuu Sabato to save his subordinate Ingrid.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nEdwin Black is an imposing character with enigmatic qualities, seemingly not fazed a lot by threats or plans not working out. He remains calm and of little words, extremely confident but doesn't boast only angered, when Oboro speaks out of line about Asagi and shows disgust about her methods. His goal turning Asagi through pain and mental anguish into a Demon (Kage) and in the end into a vampire, he can spend his eternity with. He loves strong-willed women and will lose interest should Asagi be broken into a simple sex slave. Outside Asagi he also shows affection for Ingrid and would save her in the OVA even teaming up with a Taimanin.\n\nRegardless of his methods within NOMAD he is seen as a rather noble demon, staying true to his word and to a degree playing fair and by the rules. He has no qualms about fighting women, men or demons alike.\n\nHe seems to fear, not that he can die, but that his own immortal self will be swallowed up by darkness in solitude. Therefore, he requires an eternal companion like Asagi, this fixation on her is one of his main motivators. Before focusing on Asagi, he sought others who could potentially be a threat to his existence. For him, the threat to his own life was the greatest excitement he could get. Conspiracies and life-and-death battles were the only things that give his life satisfaction.\n\nOn top of that, he has shown a desire to reform the world through destruction and rebirth, showing signs of a god complex.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nEdwin Black is a tall, middle-aged, gray haired men. In his true Majin-form, he turns purple and gains long white hair, four arms, and magical weapons.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]"
