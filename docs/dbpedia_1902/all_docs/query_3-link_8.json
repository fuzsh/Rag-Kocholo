        "text": "Histological alterations in gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles exposed to ammonia and nitrite.\n\nPubMed\n\nDutra, FabrÃ­cio Martins; RÃ¶nnau, Milton; Sponchiado, Dircelei; Forneck, Sandra Carla; Freire, Carolina Arruda; Ballester, Eduardo Luis Cupertino\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAquaculture has shown great growth in the last decades. Due to the restrictions on water use, production systems are becoming increasingly more intensive, raising concerns about the production water quality. Macrobrachium amazonicum is among the freshwater prawn species with favorable characteristics for production and possibility of intensification. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite affect the health of aquatic organisms since they quickly reach toxic concentrations. These compounds can also cause damage to the gill structure, leading to hypoxia in tissues, affecting acid-base balance, osmoregulation (salt absorption) and ammonia excretion, decreasing the immune capacity of the animal and, in extreme cases, cause death. The aim of this study was to assess histological changes in the gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles subjected to different concentrations of total ammonia and nitrite. The prawns were subjected to different concentrations of those compounds and their gills were removed and preserved for histological analysis. The gills were assessed for changes according to the Organ Index (I org ) and, for each change, an importance factor (w) was attributed according to the degree of reversibility and applied according to the degree of extension or frequency of the damage. The damage to the gills in the treatments with 100% mortality, both for ammonia and nitrite, corresponded to the high occurrence of progressive, regressive, circulatory, and inflammation damages. The other treatments (which caused less mortality) had mainly inflammation and regressive damages, whose occurrence increased according to the increase in ammonia and nitrite concentration. The histological analysis confirmed that the higher the total ammonia and nitrite concentrations, the larger the damages caused to the gill structure and that lower nitrite concentrations caused similar damages to those caused by higher total ammonia concentrations, which reflects the lower\n\nEffects of ammonia stress in the Amazon river shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum (Decapoda, Palaemonidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nPinto, Marcelo R; Lucena, Malson N; Faleiros, RogÃ©rio Oliveira; Almeida, Eduardo Alves; McNamara, John C; Leone, Francisco A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe evaluate the effects of total ammonia nitrogen-N (TAN) exposure for 72h on (Na(+),K(+))- and V(H(+))-ATPase activities and on their subunit expressions in gills of the diadromous freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum. Specific (Na(+),K(+))- and V(H(+))-ATPase activities increased roughly 1.5- to 2-fold, respectively, after exposure to 2.0mmolL(-1) TAN. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed a 2.5-fold increase in V(H(+))-ATPase B subunit mRNA expression while (Na(+),K(+))-ATPase Î±-subunit expression was unchanged. Immunohistochemical analyses of the gill lamellae located the (Na(+),K(+))-ATPase throughout the intralamellar septal cells, independently of TAN concentration, while the V(H(+))-ATPase was located in both the apical pillar cell flanges and pillar cell bodies. Systemic stress parameters like total hemocyte count decreased by 30% after exposure to 2.0mmolL(-1) TAN, accompanied by increased activities of the oxidative stress enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the gills. The stress responses of M. amazonicum to elevated TAN include increases in gill (Na(+),K(+))- and V(H(+))-ATPase activities that are accompanied by changes in oxidative stress enzyme activities, immune system effects and an increase in gill V(H(+))-ATPase gene expression. These findings likely underpin physiological effects in a crustacean like M. amazonicum that exploits multiple ecosystems during its life cycle, as well as under culture conditions that may significantly impact shrimp production by the aquaculture industry.

A previous investigation showed that all postembryonic stages of M. pantanalense from inland waters of the Pantanal are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water, while this species was not able to hypo-osmoregulate at high salinities. In M. amazonicum originating from the Amazon estuary, in contrast, all stages are able to hypo-osmoregulate, but only first-stage larvae, late juveniles and adults are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these physiological differences have not been known. We therefore investigated the expression patterns of three ion transporters (NKA Î±-subunit, VHA B-subunit and NHE3) following differential salinity acclimation in different ontogenetic stages (stage-V larvae, juveniles) of both species. Larval NKAÎ± expression was at both salinities significantly higher in M. pantanalense than in M. amazonicum, whereas no difference was noted in juveniles. VHA was also more expressed in larvae of M. pantanalense than in those of M. amazonicum. When NHE3 expression is compared between the larvae of the two species, further salinity-related differences were observed, with generally higher expression in the inland species. Overall, a high expression of ion pumps in M. pantanalense suggests an evolutionary key role of these transporters in freshwater invasion. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These differences are so accentuated that the existence of allopatric speciation has been suggested, although initial studies indicate that the genetic variability of populations happen at an intraspecific level. Among the biological responses described for M. amazonicum populations, those regarding osmoregulation and metabolism play a key role for being related to the occupation of diverse habitats. To this effect, we investigated osmoregulation through the role of free amino acids in cell volume control and metabolism, through oxygen consumption in larvae (zoeae I, II, V and IX) and/or post-larvae of a M. amazonicum population from Amazon, kept in aquaculture fish hatcheries in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. The results add information regarding the existence of distinct physiological responses among M. amazonicum populations and suggest that possible adjustments to metabolism and to the use of free amino acids as osmolytes of the regulation of the larvae and post-larvae cell volume depend on the appearance of structures responsible for hemolymph osmoregulation like, for example, the gills. In this respect, we verified that zoeae I do not alter their metabolism due to the exposition to fresh or brackish water, but they reduce intracellular concentration of free amino acids when exposed to fresh water, what may suggest the inexistence or inefficient performance of the structures responsible for volume regulation and hemolymph composition. On the other hand, in zoeae II and V exposed to fresh and brackish water, metabolism alterations were not followed by changes in free amino acids concentration. Thus it is possible, as the structures responsible for osmoregulation and ionic regulation become functional, that the role of free amino acids gets\n\nHeller Myotomy Versus Heller Myotomy With Dor Fundoplication for Achalasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichards, William O.; Torquati, Alfonso; Holzman, Michael D.; Khaitan, Leena; Byrne, Daniel; Lutfi, Rami; Sharp, Kenneth W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nObjective: We sought to determine the impact of the addition of Dor fundoplication on the incidence of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux (GER) after Heller myotomy. Summary Background Data: Based only on case series, many surgeons believe that an antireflux procedure should be added to the Heller myotomy. However, no prospective randomized data support this approach. Patients and Methods: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, institutional review board-approved clinical trial, patients with achalasia were assigned to undergo Heller myotomy or Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication. Patients were studied via 24-hour pH study and manometry at 6 months postoperatively. Pathologic GER was defined as distal esophageal time acid exposure time greater than 4.2% per 24-hour period. The outcome variables were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics between study groups. Pathologic GER occurred in 10 of 21 patients (47.6%) after Heller and in 2 of 22 patients (9.1%) after Heller plus Dor (P = 0.005). Heller plus Dor was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of GER (relative risk 0.11; 95% confidence interval 0.02â0.59; P = 0.01). Median distal esophageal acid exposure time was lower in the Heller plus Dor (0.4%; range, 0â16.7) compared with the Heller group (4.9%; range, 0.1â43.6; P = 0.001). No significant difference in surgical outcome between the 2 techniques with respect to postoperative lower-esophageal sphincter pressure or postoperative dysphagia score was observed. Conclusions: Heller Myotomy plus Dor Fundoplication was superior to Heller myotomy alone in regard to the incidence of postoperative GER. PMID:15319712\n\nH.

Patient-reported outcomes are needed to determine whether the findings are sustained long-term. We actively engaged participants from the prior randomized cohort, making up to six contact attempts per person using telephone, mail, and electronic messaging. We collected patient-reported measures of dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux using the Dysphagia Score and the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) instrument. Patient-reported re-interventions for dysphagia were verified by obtaining longitudinal medical records. Among living participants, 27/41 (66%) were contacted and all completed the follow-up study at a mean of 11.8Â years postoperatively. Median Dysphagia Scores and GERD-HRQL scores were slightly worse for Heller than Heller plus Dor but were not statistically different (6 vs 3, pÂ =Â 0.08 for dysphagia, 15 vs 13, pÂ =Â 0.25 for reflux). Five patients in the Heller group and 6 in Heller plus Dor underwent re-intervention for dysphagia with most occurring more than five years postoperatively. One patient in each group underwent redo Heller myotomy and subsequent esophagectomy. Nearly all patients (96%) would undergo operation again. Long-term patient-reported outcomes after Heller alone and Heller plus Dor for achalasia are comparable, providing support for either procedure.\n\nHeterochrony in mandible development of larval shrimp (Decapoda: Caridea)--a comparative morphological SEM study of two carideans.\n\nPubMed\n\nBatel, Annika; Melzer, Roland R; Anger, Klaus; Geiselbrecht, Hannes\n\n2014-11-01\n\nMandible development in the larval stages I-V of two palaemonid shrimp species, Palaemon elegans and Macrobrachium amazonicum, was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In contrast to the zoea I of P. elegans, first-stage larvae of M. amazonicum are nonfeeding. At hatching, the morphology of the mandibles is fully expressed in P. elegans, while it appears underdeveloped in M. amazonicum, presenting only small precursors of typical caridean features. In successive zoeal stages, both species show similar developmental changes, but the mandibular characters of the larvae in M. amazonicum were delayed compared to the equivalent stages in P. elegans, especially in the development of submarginal setae and mandible size. In conclusion, our results indicate heterochrony (postdisplacement) of mandible development in M. amazonicum compared to that in P. elegans, which is related to initial lack of mandible functionality or planktivorous feeding at hatching, respectively. This conclusion is supported by comparison with other palaemonid zoeae exhibiting different feeding modes. Our data suggest that an evolutionary ground pattern of mandible morphology is present even in species with nonfeeding first-stage larvae.

Methods: The essential oil from the oleoresin of Protium amazonicum was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID, and chiral GC-MS. P. amazonicum oleoresin oil was screened for antifungal activity against Candida albicans , Aspergillus niger , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Results: A total of 54 components representing 99.6% of the composition were identified in the oil. The essential oil was dominated by Î´-3-carene (47.9%) with lesser quantities of other monoterpenoids Î±-pinene (4.0%), p -cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), Î±-terpineol (5.5%) and p -cymen-8-ol (4.8%). Chiral GC-MS revealed most of the monoterpenoids to have a majority of levo enantiomers present with the exceptions of limonene and Î±-terpineol, which showed a dextro majority. P. amazonicum oleoresin oil showed promising activity against Cryptococcus neoformans , with MIC = 156 Î¼g/mL. Conclusions: This account is the first reporting of both the chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of the oleoresin essential oil of P. amazonicum from Ecuador. The oil was dominated by (-)-Î´-3-carene, and this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely accounts for the observed antifungal activity of the oil.\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarry, Linda; Ross, Sharona; Dahal, Sujat; Morton, Connor; Okpaleke, Chinyere; Rosas, Melissa; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2011-06-01\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is beginning to include advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious\n\nEvolutionary history of genus Macrobrachium inferred from mitochondrial markers: a molecular clock approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nJose, Deepak; Harikrishnan, Mahadevan\n\n2018-04-17\n\nCaridea, an infraorder of shrimps coming under Pleocyemata was first reported from the oceans before 417 million years followed by their radiation recorded during the Permian period. Hitherto, about 3877 extant caridean species were accounted within which one quarter constitute freshwater species. Freshwater prawns of genus Macrobrachium (Infraorder Caridea; Family Palaemonidae), with more than 240 species are inhabitants of diverse aquatic habitats like coastal lagoons, lakes, tropical streams, ponds and rivers. Previous studies on Macrobrachium relied on the highly variable morphological characters which were insufficient for accurate diagnosis of natural species groups. Present study focuses on the utility of molecular markers (viz. COI and 16S rRNA) for resolving the evolutionary history of genus Macrobrachium using a combination of phylogeny and timescale components. It is for the first time a molecular clock approach had been carried out towards genus Macrobrachium in a broad aspect with the incorporation of congeners inhabiting diverse geographical realms including endemic species M. striatum from South West coast of India. Molecular results obtained revealed the phylogenetic relationships between congeners of genus Macrobrachium at intra/inter-continental level along with the corresponding evolutionary time estimates.\n\nReoperative Heller myotomy: more pain, less gain.\n\nPubMed\n\nWood, Thomas W; Ross, Sharona B; Ryan, Carrie E; Bowman, Ty A; Jacobi, Benjamin L; Konstantinidis, Michael G; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2015-06-01\n\nHeller myotomy provides durable and effective treatment of achalasia. Due to recurrence or persistence of symptoms, a small subset of patients seeks reoperation. This study was undertaken to determine if reoperative Heller myotomy provides salutary amelioration of symptoms. 609 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 to 2013 were prospectively followed; 38 underwent reoperative myotomy. Patients graded their symptom frequency and severity before and after myotomy on a Likert scale. Median data are reported. Patients undergoing reoperative myotomy, when compared to those undergoing their first myotomy, experienced a higher conversion rate to an \"open\" myotomy (8% vs 1%, P < 0.05) and a longer length of stay (3 vs 1 day, P < 0.05). Reoperative myotomy led to improvement in symptoms, but the magnitude of improvement in symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, choking, and coughing) was less than for patients undergoing their first myotomy (all P < 0.05). Patients undergoing reoperative Heller myotomy were less likely to report symptoms occurring once per month or less (83% vs 56%, P < 0.01). Patients undergoing reoperative myotomy note improvement in symptoms, although to a lesser extent than patients undergoing their first myotomy. Patients undergoing reoperative Heller myotomy can expect to experience less improvement of symptoms, denoting the importance of the first myotomy.\n\nRevisiting Regression in Autism: Heller's \"Dementia Infantilis\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWestphal, Alexander; Schelinski, Stefanie; Volkmar, Fred; Pelphrey, Kevin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTheodor Heller first described a severe regression of adaptive function in normally developing children, something he termed dementia infantilis, over one 100 years ago.

Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy combined with fundoplication represents the treatment of choice for this disease, achieving good results in about 90% of patients. However, about 10% of treated patients refer persistent or recurrent dysphagia. Many Authors showed that this failure rate is related to inadequate myotomy. To verify, from experimental to clinical study, the modifications induced by Heller's myotomy of the esophago- gastric junction on LES pressure (LES-P profile, using a computerized manometric system. From 2002 to 2010 105 patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy followed by antireflux surgery. The calibrated Heller myotomy was extended for at least 2.5 cm on the esophagus and for 3 cm on the gastric side. Each step was evaluated by intraoperative manometry. Moreover, intraoperative manometry and endoscopy were used to calibrate the fundoplication. The preoperative mean LES-P was 37.73 Â± 12.21. After esophageal and gastric myotomy the mean pressure drop was 21.3% and 91.9%, respectively. No mortality was reported. Laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy with fundoplication achieves a good outcome in the surgical treatment of achalasia. The use of intraoperative manometry enables an adequate calibration of myotomy, being effective in the evaluation of the complete pressure drop, avoiding too long esophageal myotomy and, especially, too short gastric myotomy, that may be the cause of surgical failure.\n\nThe âLearning Curveâ in Videoscopic Heller Myotomy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBloomston, Mark; Serafini, Francesco; Boyce, H. Worth\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjectives: In the early 1990s, minimally invasive videoscopy was applied to numerous operations. After undertaking more than 50 âopenâ Heller myotomies, our experience with videoscopic Heller myotomy began in 1992. We sought to determine whether the outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy is influenced by surgeon experience. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with severe dysphagia secondary to achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 and 1998. Intraoperative endoscopy was utilized to ensure adequate myotomy in all patients. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: the first 25 patients (group I), the second 25 patients (group II), and the last 28 patients (group III). Clinical outcome was based on length of stay, incidence of intraoperative complications, conversion to an âopenâ procedure, and postoperative symptoms. Results: Perioperative complications occurred in 20% of patients in group I compared with 8% and 12% in groups II and III, respectively (P = NS). Only 3 patients required conversion to an âopenâ procedure, all in group I (P < 0.05). Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 80% of patients in group I, 100% in group II, and 96% in group III (P < 0.05). Significant reductions in conversions to âopen,â length of stay, and postoperative symptoms were seen after 20 myotomies were undertaken. Conclusion: Outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy, like other videoscopic operations, improves as surgeons progress along the videoscopic âlearning curve.â After approximately 20 videoscopic Heller myotomies, surgeons can expect fewer conversions to open procedures, shorter hospital stays, and better symptomatic relief.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short- and middle-term results of these procedures in children. For technical reasons, children under six years old (n=8) were treated by surgery only, whereas patients over six years old (n=14) were treated by either Heller myotomy or pneumatic dilatation. Of the children aged under six years, 75% were symptom-free at six months and 83% at 24 months of follow-up. Of the patients aged over six years, complete remission was achieved by Heller myotomy in 44.5% vs. 55.5% by pneumatic dilatation after six months, and in 40% vs. 65%, respectively, after 24 months. Both pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy showed significant rates of failure. These results suggest that pneumatic dilatation may be considered a primary treatment in children over six years old. Also, where necessary, Heller myotomy and pneumatic dilatation may be used as complementary treatments.\n\nOutcomes promote reoperative Heller myotomy for symptoms of achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRakita, S; Villadolid, D; Kalipersad, C; Thometz, D; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2007-10-01\n\nHeller myotomy is accepted as first-line therapy for achalasia, yet for a small number of patients, symptoms persist or recur after myotomy. This study was undertaken to report our results with reoperative laparoscopic Heller myotomy for recurrent symptoms of achalasia. We have undertaken laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 275 patients and reoperative myotomy in 12 patients for recurrent dysphagia, of which three had their initial myotomy undertaken by us. For each, studies prior to reoperative Heller myotomy documented a nonrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter without stricture. Patients scored symptoms before and after reoperative myotomy. Before reoperative myotomy, 75% underwent dilation and 42% underwent Botox injection. Ten of twelve reoperative myotomies were undertaken and completed laparoscopically. Median follow-up is 24.1 months (29.0 months + 25.89). Symptom frequency and severity scores improved significantly after reoperative myotomy. Frequency of vomiting and frequency and severity of heartburn were improved after reoperative myotomy, but not to a significant extent. However, they were not particularly notable prior to surgery, compared to obstructive symptoms, such as dysphagia. Excellent or good outcomes were reported in 73%, and notably, 91% stated that they would have the operation again after having been through the process firsthand and knowing their outcomes. Patient outcomes promote the application of reoperative Heller myotomy for recurrent or persistent symptoms of achalasia following Heller myotomy.\n\nRobot-assisted Heller's myotomy for achalasia in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nAltokhais, Tariq; Mandora, Hala; Al-Qahtani, Ayed; Al-Bassam, Abdulrahman\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAchalasia is rare in children. Surgical options include open, laparoscopic and robotic approaches. However, Heller's myotomy remains the treatment of choice. This report describes our experience with robot-assisted Heller's myotomy in children and presents a review of the literature. Included in this study are children who underwent robot-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia via the Da Vinci surgical system between 2004 and 2015 at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The medical records of these patients were reviewed for demographic data, presenting symptoms, diagnostic modalities, operative procedures, complications, outcomes and follow-ups. Six patients were identified. The age of the patients at surgery ranged between 2 and 12 years (mean 7.1 years). The most common presenting symptoms were dysphagia, vomiting and nocturnal cough. Contrast swallow and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy established a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia in all of the patients. Four patients underwent esophageal dilatation 2-5 times before the definitive procedure. All patients underwent successful robot-assisted Heller's myotomy with concomitant partial posterior fundoplication. The postoperative course was uneventful. Five patients had a complete resolution of the symptoms and one patient improved. The follow-up assessments have been consistent and have ranged from 0.5 to 11 years (mean 4.4 years). Robotic-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia in children is safe and effective and is a suitable alternative to open and laparoscopic approaches.\n\nIntraoperative Assessment of Esophagogastric Junction Distensibility During Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeHaan, Reece K; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe sought to characterize the changes in esophagogastric junction (EGJ) distensibility during Heller Myotomy with Dor fundoplication using the EndoFLIP device. Intraoperative distensibility measurements on 14 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication were conducted over an 18-month period. Minimum esophageal diameter, cross-sectional areas, and distensibility index were measured at 30 and 40 mL catheter volumes before myotomy, postmyotomy, and following Dor fundoplication. Distensibility index is defined as the narrowest cross-sectional area divided by the corresponding pressure expressed in mm/mm Hg. Heller myotomy was found to lead to significant changes in the distensibility characteristics of the EGJ. Minimum esophageal diameter and EGJ distensibility increased significantly with Heller myotomy.\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM): feasible as reoperation following Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nVigneswaran, Yalini; Yetasook, Amy K; Zhao, Jin-Cheng; Denham, Woody; Linn, John G; Ujiki, Michael B\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of performing peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the management of recurrent achalasia after failed myotomy. Eight patients presented to our institution between October 2010 and June 2013 with recurrent/persistent symptoms after prior laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Three patients underwent redo laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and five patients consented to redo myotomy with POEM. Demographics were similar between the groups with exception of age (POEM 69.5 vs. laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) 34.5, pâ=â0.003). Preoperative Eckardt scores, motility, and prior interventions were not significantly different. Three patients who underwent POEM and two who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy had prior fundoplication. There was one perforation identified after laparoscopic Heller myotomy and one patient with persistent subcutaneous emphysema after POEM. Both POEM and laparoscopic Heller myotomy demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms and Eckardt scores at average follow-up of approximately 5 months (pâ<â0.05). POEM is a feasible option for patients after failed myotomy even in the presence of prior fundoplication. The procedure can be performed safely using a similar technique as for primary myotomy with the exception of creating the myotomy laterally along the right side of the esophagus and lesser curvature avoiding the previous anterior myotomy.\n\nTranscervical heller myotomy using flexible endoscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpaun, Georg O; Dunst, Christy M; Arnold, Brittany N; Martinec, Danny V; Cassera, Maria A; SwanstrÃ¶m, Lee L\n\n2010-12-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia is most commonly treated by laparoscopic myotomy. Transesophageal approaches using flexible endoscopy have recently been described. We hypothesized that using techniques and flexible instruments from our NOTES experience through a small cervical incision would be a safer and less traumatic route for esophageal myotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and success rate of using flexible endoscopes to perform anterior or posterior Heller myotomy via a transcervical approach. This animal (porcine) and human cadaver study was conducted at the Legacy Research and Technology Center. Mediastinal operations on ten live, anesthetized pigs and two human cadavers were performed using standard flexible endoscopes through a small incision at the supra-sternal notch. The esophagus was dissected to the phreno-esophageal junction using balloon dilatation in the peri-esophageal space followed by either anterior or posterior distal esophageal myotomy. Success rate was recorded of esophageal dissection to the diaphragm and proximal stomach, anterior and posterior myotomy, perforation, and complication rates. Dissection of the esophagus to the diaphragm and performing esophageal myotomy was achieved in 100% of attempts. Posterior Heller myotomy was always extendable onto the gastric wall, while anterior gastric extension of the myotomy was found to be more difficult (4/4 and 2/8, respectively; P = 0.061). Heller myotomy through a small cervical incision using flexible endoscopes is feasible. A complete Heller myotomy was performed with a higher success rate posteriorly possibly due to less anatomic interference.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia: results after 10 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nCowgill, Sarah M; Villadolid, Desiree; Boyle, Robert; Al-Saadi, Sam; Ross, Sharona; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2009-12-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy was first undertaken in the early 1990s, and appreciable numbers of patients with 10-year follow-up periods are now available. This study was undertaken to determine long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy used to treat achalasia. Of 337 patients who have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy since 1992, 47 who underwent myotomy more than 10 years ago have been followed through a prospectively maintained registry. Among many symptoms, patients scored dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn before and after myotomy using a Likert scale with choices ranging from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Symptom scores before and after myotomy were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Data are reported as median (mean Â± standard deviation). The median length of the hospital stay was 2 days (mean, 3 Â± 8.6 days; range, 1-60 days). Notable complications were infrequent after myotomy. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient required a redo myotomy after 5 years due to recurrence of symptoms. At this writing, 33 patients (70%) are still alive. The causes of death after discharge were unrelated to myotomy. The frequency and severity scores for dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn all decreased significantly after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (p < 0.0001 for all). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy can be undertaken with few complications. This procedure significantly decreases the frequency and severity of achalasia symptoms without promoting heartburn. The symptoms of achalasia are durably ameliorated by laparoscopic Heller myotomy during long-term follow-up evaluation, thereby promoting application of this procedure.\n\nIdentification of novel allergen in edible insect, Gryllus bimaculatus and its cross-reactivity with Macrobrachium spp. allergens.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrinroch, Chutima; Srisomsap, Chantragan; Chokchaichamnankit, Daranee; Punyarit, Phaibul; Phiriyangkul, Pharima\n\n2015-10-01\n\nEdible insects have recently been promoted as a source of protein and have a high nutrition value. Identification of allergens and cross-reactivity between Macrobrachium spp. and the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) is necessary for food safety control and to assist in the diagnosis and therapy of allergy symptoms. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate proteins. Allergens were determined and identified by IgE-immunoblotting with pooled sera from prawn-allergic patients (n=16) and LC-MS/MS. Arginine kinase (AK) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were determined as the important allergens in muscle of Macrobrachium rosenbergii whereas, hemocyanin (HC) was identified as an allergen in Macrobrachium spp. The allergens in Macrobrachium lanchesteri were identified as AK and HC. In addition, hexamerin1B (HEX1B) was identified as a novel and specific allergen in G. bimaculatus. The important allergen in G. bimaculatus and Macrobrachium spp. is AK and was found to cross-react between both species. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, recalls his childhood in the Holocaust and his contributions to science and technology that earned him the US National Medal of Technology and Innovation in a conversation with Elton J. Cairns, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Heller, born in 1933, describes the enslavement of his father by Hungarians in 1942; the confiscation of his family's home, business, and all its belongings in 1944; and his incarceration in a brick factory with 18,000 Jews who were shipped by the Hungarians to be gassed by Germans in Auschwitz. Dr. Heller and his immediate family survived the Holocaust and arrived in Israel in 1945. He studied under Ernst David Bergmann at the Hebrew University, and then worked at Bell Laboratories and GTE Laboratories, where he headed Bell Lab's Electronic Materials Research Department. At GTE Laboratories, he built in 1966 the first neodymium liquid lasers and in 1973 with Jim Auborn conceived and engineered the lithium thionyl chloride battery, one of the first to be manufactured lithium batteries, which is still in use. After joining the faculty of engineering of The University of Texas at Austin, he cofounded with his son Ephraim Heller TheraSense, now a major part of Abbott Diabetes Care, which produced a microcoulometer that made the monitoring of glucose painless by accurately measuring the blood glucose concentration in 300 nL of blood. He also describes the electrical wiring of enzymes, the basis for Abbott's state-of-the-art continuous glucose monitoring system. He discusses his perspective of reducing the risk of catastrophic global warming in a wealth-accumulating, more-energy-consuming world and provides advice for students entering careers in science or engineering.\n\n[Laparoscopic Heller myotomy for esophageal achalasia].\n\nPubMed\n\nIbÃ¡Ã±ez, Luis; Butte, Jean Michel; Pimentel, Fernando; Escalona, Alex; PÃ©rez, Gustavo; Crovari, Fernando; GuzmÃ¡n, Sergio; Llanos, Osvaldo\n\n2007-04-01\n\nAchalasia is characterized by an incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The best treatment is surgical and the laparoscopic approach may have good results. To assess the results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy among patients with achalasia. Prospective study of patients subjected to a laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1995 and 2004. Clinical features, early and late operative results were assessed. Twenty seven patients aged 12 to 74 years (12 females) were operated. All had disphagia lasting for a mean of 32 months. Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure ranged from 18 to 85 mmHg. Eight patients received other treatments prior to surgery but symptoms persisted or reappeared. The preoperative clinical score was 7. No patient died and no procedure had to be converted to open surgery. In a follow up of 21 to 131 months, all patients are satisfied with the surgical results and the postoperative clinical score is 1. Only one patient with a mega esophagus maintained a clinical score of six. In this series of patients, laparoscopic Heller myotomy was an effective and safe treatment for esophageal achalasia.\n\nEndoscopic Therapy for Achalasia Before Heller Myotomy Results in Worse Outcomes Than Heller Myotomy Alone\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, C Daniel; Stival, Alessandro; Howell, D Lee; Swafford, Vickie\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective: Heller myotomy has been shown to be an effective primary treatment of achalasia. However, many physicians treating patients with achalasia continue to offer endoscopic therapies before recommending operative myotomy. Herein we report outcomes in 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with the majority (74%) undergoing myotomy as secondary treatment of achalasia. Methods: Data on all patients undergoing operative management of achalasia are collected prospectively. Over a 9-year period (1994â2003), 209 patients underwent Heller myotomy for achalasia. Of these, 154 had undergone either Botox injection and/or pneumatic dilation preoperatively. Preoperative, operative, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with multiple Ï2 and Mann-Whitney U analyses, as well as ANOVA. Results: Among the 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia, 154 received endoscopic therapy before being referred for surgery (100 dilation only, 33 Botox only, 21 both). The groups were matched for preoperative demographics and symptom scores for dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain. Intraoperative complications were more common in the endoscopically treated group with GI perforations being the most common complication (9.7% versus 3.6%). Postoperative complications, primarily severe dysphagia, and pulmonary complications were more common after endoscopic treatment (10.4% versus 5.4%). Failure of myotomy as defined by persistent or recurrent severe symptoms, or need for additionally therapy including redo myotomy or esophagectomy was higher in the endoscopically treated group (19.5% versus 10.1%). Conclusion: Use of preoperative endoscopic therapy remains common and has resulted in more intraoperative complications, primarily perforation, more postoperative complications, and a higher rate of failure than when no preoperative therapy was used. Endoscopic therapy for achalasia should not be used unless patients are not candidates for\n\nVideoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia--results beyond short-term follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Boyce, W; Mamel, J; Albrink, M; Murr, M; Durkin, A; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2000-08-01\n\nHeller myotomy has long been utilized for patients failing nonoperative management of achalasia. Videoscopy has been advocated to decrease the morbidity of Heller myotomy; however, few reports document outcome beyond 1 year after videoscopic Heller myotomy. To determine perioperative morbidity, relief of dysphagia, and the incidence of postoperative reflux symptoms following videoscopic Heller myotomy with follow-up to over 4 years. Patients with achalasia documented by barium esophogram and esophageal manometry underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy beginning in 1992. Intraoperative peroral endoscopy was utilized to guide the cephalad and caudad extent of myotomy. A barium esophogram was undertaken in the immediate postoperative period to evaluate for subclinical leak and assess esophageal emptying. Seventy-eight patients underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy. The mean age was 51 years +/- 19 (range 14 to 91). Most (62%) patients had undergone pneumatic dilation prior to surgical consultation and 54% had previous botox injections. All patients complained of dysphagia and 40% had symptoms of heartburn prior to myotomy. After myotomy, 91% of patients stated that their swallowing was improved with myotomy. Thirteen patients (18%) experience heartburn more than once per week after myotomy. The average length of stay was 2 +/- 2 days, with 72% of patients spending 2 days or fewer in the hospital. Six (7.7%) major complications occurred: five esophageal perforations and one enterotomy without long-term sequellae. Three procedures (3.8%) were converted to \"open\" procedures. No deaths occurred. We conclude that videoscopic Heller myotomy is safe and efficacious, with low morbidity and mortality. Videoscopic myotomy provides relief beyond the short term for dysphagia due to achalasia with minimal reflux symptoms. We advocate videoscopic Heller myotomy in the treatment of severe dysphagia due to achalasia not adequately palliated by or amenable to nonoperative management\n\nDoes concomitant anterior fundoplication promote dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy?\n\nPubMed\n\nTapper, Donovan; Morton, Connor; Kraemer, Emily; Villadolid, Desiree; Ross, Sharona B; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2008-07-01\n\nConcerns for gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia justify considerations of concomitant anterior fundoplication. This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Notably, relative to patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test) and to less frequent and severe dysphagia and choking (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia. Concomitant anterior fundoplication decreases the frequency and severity of heartburn and dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Concomitant anterior fundoplication promotes salutary relief in the frequency and severity of symptoms after myotomy and is warranted.\n\nMorphological and molecular features of some freshwater prawn species under genus Macrobrachium Spence Bate, 1868 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Palaemonidae) from Myanmar.\n\nPubMed\n\nMar, Win; Kang, Peng-Fei; Mao, Bin; Wang, Yu-Feng\n\n2018-02-28\n\nMyanmar is abundant in lakes and rivers, yet only a few investigations on the fauna of shrimps and prawns have been conducted and no molecular characteristics of prawn species have been described. This study reveals the morphologically identification of five freshwater prawn species under the genus Macrobrachium, including M. cavernicola, M. australiense, M. johnsoni, M. josephi and Macrobrachium sp.WMY-2017. As there was no previous record and information concerning with M. australiense, M. johnsoni, M. josephi and Macrobrachium sp. WMY-2017, they were regarded as the first record from Myanmar. A fragment of Mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I Gene (COI) was amplified successfully from three studied species: M. australiense, M. josephi, and Macrobrachium sp.WMY-2017. The interspecific divergences of studied species varied from 0.01 to 0.15. The phylogenetic tree based on COI fragment sequences showed that M. australiense was closely related to M. rosenbergii, while Macrobrachium sp. WMY-2017 was closest to M. josephi. The results of molecular phylogeny has clarified the relationship within the genus Macrobrachium and represents the first step toward understanding the pattern of speciation base on molecular approach in Myanmar.\n\nUse of intertidal areas by shrimps (Decapoda) in a Brazilian Amazon estuary.\n\nPubMed\n\nSampaio, Hebert A; Martinelli-Lemos, Jussara M\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe present work investigated the occupation and the correlation of the shrimp abundance in relation to environmental variables in different habitats (mangroves, salt marshes and rocky outcrops) in an Amazon estuary. The collections were made in August and November 2009, at low syzygy tide on AreuÃ¡ Beach, situated in the Extractive Reserve of MÃ£e Grande de CuruÃ§Ã¡, ParÃ¡, Brazil totaling 20 pools. In each environment, we recorded the physical-chemical factors (pH, salinity, and temperature) and measured the area (m2) and volume (m3) of every pool through bathymetry. The average pH, salinity, temperature, area and volume of tide pools were 8.75 (Â± 0.8 standard deviation), 35.45 (Â± 3), 29.49 Â°C (Â± 2.32), 27.41 m2 (Â± 41.18), and 5.19 m3 (Â± 8.01), respectively. We caught a total of 4,871 shrimps, distributed in three families and four species: Farfantepenaeus subtilis (98.36%) (marine) followed by Alpheus pontederiae (0.76%) (estuarine), Macrobrachium surinamicum (0.45%) and Macrobrachium amazonicum (0.43%) predominantly freshwater. The species F. subtilis and A. pontederiae occurred in the three habitats, whereas M. surinamicum occurred in salt marsh and rocky outcrop and M. amazonicum only in marisma. Temperature and pH were the most important environmental descriptors that significantly affected the density and biomass of shrimps.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy for Achalasia Technical Aspects.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlottmann, Francisco; Allaix, Marco E; Patti, Marco G\n\n2018-04-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder defined by the lack of esophageal peristalsis, and by a lower esophageal sphincter that fails to relax in response to swallowing. Patients' symptoms include dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, heartburn, and chest pain. Achalasia is a chronic condition without cure, and treatment options are aimed at providing symptomatic relief, improving esophageal emptying, and preventing the development of megaesophagus. Presently, a laparoscopic Heller myotomy with a partial fundoplication is considered the best treatment modality. A properly executed operation is key for the success of a laparoscopic Heller myotomy.\n\nModulation by K+ Plus NH4+ of microsomal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in selected ontogenetic stages of the diadromous river shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum (Decapoda, Palaemonidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nLeone, Francisco A; Bezerra, Thais M S; GarÃ§on, Daniela P; Lucena, Malson N; Pinto, Marcelo R; Fontes, Carlos F L; McNamara, John C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe investigate the synergistic stimulation by K(+) plus NH4 (+) of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity in microsomal preparations of whole zoea I and decapodid III, and in juvenile and adult river shrimp gills. Modulation of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity is ontogenetic stage-specific, and particularly distinct between juveniles and adults. Although both gill enzymes exhibit two different sites for K(+) and NH4 (+) binding, in the juvenile enzyme, these two sites are equivalent: binding by both ions results in slightly stimulated activity compared to that of a single ionic species. In the adult enzyme, the sites are not equivalent: when one ion occupies its specific binding site, (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity is stimulated synergistically by â 50% on binding of the complementary ion. Immunolocalization reveals the enzyme to be distributed predominantly throughout the intralamellar septum in the gill lamellae of juveniles and adults. Western blot analyses demonstrate a single immunoreactive band, suggesting a single (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase Î±-subunit isoform that is distributed into different density membrane fractions, independently of ontogenetic stage.

This study was undertaken to define the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. One hundred patients underwent LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptom frequency and severity were scored using a Likert scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Symptom resolution, additional trocars, and complications were compared among patient quartiles. Median data are presented. Preoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 10/8 and regurgitation = 8/7. Additional trocars were placed in 12 patients (10%), of whom all were in the first two quartiles. Esophagotomy/gastrotomy occurred in three patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 9 per cent. No conversions to \"open\" operations occurred. Length of stay was 1 day. Postoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 2/0 and regurgitation = 0/0; scores were less than before myotomy (P < 0.001). There were no apparent scars, except where additional trocars were placed. LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication well palliates symptoms of achalasia with no apparent scar. Placement of additional trocars only occurred early in the experience. For surgeons proficient with the conventional laparoscopic approach, the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication is short and safe, because proficiency is quickly attained.\n\nPeroral endoscopic remyotomy for failed Heller myotomy: a prospective single-center study.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, P H; Li, Q L; Yao, L Q; Xu, M D; Chen, W F; Cai, M Y; Hu, J W; Li, L; Zhang, Y Q; Zhong, Y S; Ma, L L; Qin, W Z; Cui, Z\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecurrence/persistence of symptoms occurs in approximately 20 % of patients after Heller myotomy for achalasia. Controversy exists regarding the therapy for patients in whom Heller myotomy has failed. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), a new endoscopic myotomy technique, for patients with failed Heller myotomy. A total of 12 patients with recurrence/persistence of symptoms after Heller myotomy, as diagnosed by established methods and an Eckardt score of â¥ 4, were prospectively included. The primary outcome was symptom relief during follow-up, defined as an Eckardt score of â¤ 3. Secondary outcomes were procedure-related adverse events, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure on manometry, reflux symptoms, and medication use before and after POEM. All 12 patients underwent successful POEM after a mean of 11.9 years (range 2 - 38 years) from the time of the primary Heller myotomy. No serious complications related to POEM were encountered. During a mean follow-up period of 10.4 months (range 5 - 14 months), treatment success was achieved in 11/12 patients (91.7 %; mean score pre- vs. post-treatment 9.2 vs. 1.3; P < 0.001). Mean LES pressure was 29.4 mmHg pre-treatment and 13.5 mmHg post-treatment (P < 0.001). One patient developed mild reflux symptoms and required intermittent medication with proton pump inhibitors. POEM seems to be a promising new treatment for failed Heller myotomy resulting in short-term symptom relief in > 90 % of cases. Previous Heller myotomy may make subsequent endoscopic remyotomy more challenging, but does not prevent successful POEM.

The article summarizes the pursuit of JÃ³zef Heller in various branches of academic life, which were and still are appreciated by subsequent generations of Polish biochemists.\n\nFreshwater shrimps (Macrobrachium depressimanum and Macrobrachium jelskii) as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Madeira River Basin, Western Amazon.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalvÃ£o, R C F; Holanda, I B B; De Carvalho, D P; Almeida, R; Souza, C M M; Lacerda, L D; Bastos, W R\n\n2018-01-10\n\nTotal mercury (THg) concentrations measured in two freshwater shrimp species (Macrobrachium depressimanum and Macrobrachium jelskii) showed a relationship with the location of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) from the Madeira River Basin, Western Amazon. Between August 2009 and May 2010, 212 shrimp samples were collected in the confluence of the Madeira River with three of its tributaries (Western Amazon). THg concentration was quantified in the exoskeleton, hepatopancreas and muscle tissue of the shrimps by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There were no significant differences between the two shrimp species when samples came from the Madeira River, but Hg concentrations were significantly lower in a tributary outside the influence of the gold mining area. Average THg concentrations were higher in the hepatopancreas (up to 160.0Â ngÂ g -1 ) and lower in the exoskeleton and muscle tissue (10.0-35.0Â ngÂ g -1 and <â0.9-42.0Â ngÂ g -1 , respectively). Freshwater shrimps from the Madeira River respond to local environmental levels of Hg and can be considered as biomonitors for environmental Hg at this spatial scale. These organisms are important for moving Hg up food webs including those that harbor economic significant fish species and thus enhancing human exposure.\n\nA single institution's experience with more than 500 laparoscopic Heller myotomies for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander S; Morton, Connor A; Rosas, Melissa; Albrink, Michael; Ross, Sharona B\n\n2010-05-01\n\nLong-term symptom relief and patient satisfaction after Heller myotomy are being reported. Herein, we report the largest experience of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia. Since 1992, 505 patients have been prospectively followed after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Until 2004, concomitant fundoplication was undertaken for a patulous hiatus, a large hiatal hernia, or to buttress the repair of an esophagotomy, then concomitant fundoplication became routinely applied. More recently, laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) Heller myotomy has been performed when possible to improve cosmesis. Before and after myotomy, patients scored their symptoms. Before myotomy, 60% of patients underwent endoscopic therapy; of these patients, 27% had Botox (Allergan) therapy alone, 52% underwent dilation therapy alone, and 21% had both. Esophagotomy occurred in 7% of patients. Concomitant diverticulectomy was undertaken in 7%, fundoplication was performed in 59%, and LESS Heller myotomy was done in 12%. Median length of stay was 1 day. With mean follow-up at 31 months, the severity of all symptoms improved significantly. After myotomy, 95% experienced symptoms less than once per week, 86% believed their outcome is satisfying or better, and 92% would undergo myotomy again, if necessary. Symptoms after myotomy are similar with or without fundoplication and regardless of the laparoscopic approach used. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy safely and durably relieves symptoms of dysphagia. Confinement is short and satisfaction is very high. Relief of esophageal obstruction is paramount; the approach used or the application of a fundoplication has a lesser impact. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy, preferably with anterior fundoplication using a single site laparoscopic approach, is strongly encouraged for patients with symptomatic achalasia and is efficacious even after failures of dilation and/or Botox therapy.

We set out to show that videoscopic Heller myotomy with concurrent endoscopy ensures adequacy of myotomy while limiting postoperative clinically apparent reflux. Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy with concomitant endoscopy between 1992 and 1998. Fundoplication was not routinely undertaken. Results: Preoperative symptoms consisted of dysphagia (100%), emesis/regurgitation (68%), heartburn (58%), and postprandial chest pain (49%). Following myotomy, significant improvement (P < 0.0001) was seen in dysphagia (43%), postprandial chest pain (13%), and emesis/regurgitation (9%) at a mean follow-up of 33 Â± 2.2 months. Mean reflux score (scale 0 to 5) improved from 3.7 Â± 0.3 to 1.5 Â± 0.2 (P < 0.0001). Improvement in symptoms was reported in 96% of patients. Fundoplication was used in 8 patients as part of hiatus reconstruction (n = 6) or repair of esophageal perforation (n = 2). Conclusions: Intraoperative endoscopy during video-scopic Heller myotomy guides the extent and adequacy of myotomy. By utilizing a focused dissection with preservation of the natural antireflux mechanisms around the gastroesophageal junction and limiting the extent of myotomy along the cardia, postoperative reflux symptoms are minimized. We advocate concomitant endoscopy during Heller myotomy to guide myotomy and submit that routine fundoplication is clinically unnecessary.

A retrospective clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the indication, technique and controversies of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in the achalasia treatment. The following symptoms were evaluated prior and after Heller myotomy: dysphagia, heartburn, nausea/vomiting after meal and asthma/coughing. The patients were evaluated by the use of Likert score. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student t test. The intra-operative (operation time, intraoperative complications, blood loss, conversion rate), and peri-operative parameters (morbidity, mortality, hospital stay) were evaluated as well. The patients who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy were included in the trial. All patients were perioperatively managed by a multidisciplinary team. The evaluation of fourteen patients was performed (average age: 53.2 yrs., eleven men, two women, BMI 23.6 kg/m(2)). The patients were indicated for surgery in all of the stages (I-III). Previous semiconservative therapeutic modalities were performed in thirteen patients. The standard laparoscopic technique for Heller myotomy with semifundoplication was applied. All the observed symptoms were statistically improved after the surgery (p=0.05). The average operating time was 89 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was below 20 ml. There was no conversion to open surgery. An average hospital stay was 4.3 days. Morbidity was 14.3 % and mortality 0 %. In one patient esophageal mucosa perforation was intra-operatively identified and sutured. Post-operative course in this patient was without any complications. The laparoscopic Heller myotomy has become the \"gold standard\" procedure for achalasia. It is an excellent method allowing precise operation technique with good visualization of the esophagogastric junction. The operation with this approach is safe, efficient, and with excellent reproducible operative results.

METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy; an anterior partial fundoplication in 17, and angle of His reconstruction in 15 cases represented the antireflux procedure of choice. RESULTS: There were no morbidity and mortality recorded in both anterior funduplication and angle of His reconstruction groups. No differences were detected in terms of recurrent dysphagia, p.o. reflux or medical therapy. CONCLUSION: To reduce the incidence of recurrent achalasia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy, we believe that Hisâ angle reconstruction is a safe and effective alternative to the anterior fundoplication.

This study was undertaken to identify the causes of their dissatisfaction. Patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy from 1992 to 2015 were prospectively followed. Using a Likert scale, patients rated their symptom frequency/severity before and after the procedure. Patients graded their experience from \"Very Satisfying\" to \"Very Unsatisfying.\" 647 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Fifty (8%) patients, median age 57 years and BMI 24Â kg/m 2 reported dissatisfaction at follow-up subsequent to myotomy. \"Dissatisfied\" patients were more likely to have undergone prior abdominal operations (pÂ =Â 0.01) or previous myotomies (pÂ =Â 0.02). \"Dissatisfied\" patients had a greater incidence of diverticulectomy (pÂ =Â 0.03) and had longer postoperative LOS (pÂ =Â 0.01). Symptom frequency/severity persisted after myotomy for dissatisfied patients (pÂ >Â 0.05). Dissatisfaction after laparoscopic Heller myotomy is directly related to persistent/recurrent symptoms. Previous abdominal operations/myotomies, diverticulectomies, and longer LOS are predictors of dissatisfaction. With this understanding, we can identify patients who might be more prone to dissatisfaction. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We present our single center experience with surgical interventions for these failures. We did a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Based on preoperative symptoms and endoscopy, esophagogram, and manometry results, patients were divided into three groups to guide management. Telephone follow-up was done using a structured foregut questionnaire. Between December 2003 and June 2009, 16 patients underwent operative interventions for disabling symptoms after previous Heller myotomy. Eight patients presented primarily with recurrent dysphagia and underwent transabdominal Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication. Seven patients reported good to excellent symptom relief at mean follow-up of 42 months. One patient reported no relief and eventually required esophageal bypass with retrosternal gastric pull-up. Four patients presented with uncontrolled GER. Two patients who underwent redo partial fundoplication reported poor symptomatic outcome and one patient has since undergone short limb Roux-en-y gastric bypass (SLRNYGB) with excellent symptom relief. The other two patients underwent SLRNYGB with excellent relief at 10 months. Four patients had end stage achalasia and underwent esophageal resection with reconstruction. All reported excellent symptom relief at mean follow-up of 36 months. Transabdominal redo Heller myotomy for dysphagia has good outcomes. Redo fundoplication for GER after previous myotomy has poor results and SLRNYGB is an effective option in these patients. Esophageal resection remains an effective, albeit morbid, option for end-stage achalasia.\n\nImprovement of respiratory symptoms following Heller myotomy for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhandelwal, Saurabh; Petersen, Rebecca; Tatum, Roger; Sinan, Huseyin; Aaronson, Daniel; Mier, Fernando; Martin, Ana V; Pellegrini, Carlos A; Oelschlager, Brant K\n\n2011-02-01\n\nAlthough patients with achalasia complain mainly of dysphagia, we have observed that they also have a high rate of respiratory problems. We hypothesized that the latter may be due to poor esophageal clearance leading to aspiration. This study examines the effect of Heller myotomy on these symptoms. We studied the course of 111 patients with achalasia who underwent Heller myotomy between 1994 and 2008 and who agreed to participate in this study. All patients completed a questionnaire postoperatively assessing the preoperative and postoperative prevalence and severity of symptoms using visual analog scales. Patients were divided into two groups: one that included all those with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, hoarseness, cough, wheezing, sore throat, and/or a history of asthma or pneumonia) prior to myotomy and one that included those without those symptoms. All patients presented with dysphagia as their primary complaint, and 63 (57%) reported respiratory symptoms or disease prior to surgery. There were no significant differences in preoperative characteristics between those with and without respiratory manifestations. After a median follow-up of 71 months (range 9-186 months), 55 (87%) patients reported durable improvement of dysphagia. The frequency and severity of all respiratory symptoms decreased significantly. Twenty-four of the 29 patients (82%) who reported a history of pneumonia prior to surgery did not experience recurrent episodes after Heller myotomy. A Heller myotomy is effective in improving esophageal emptying in patients with achalasia. This results in sustained improvement of dysphagia and associated respiratory symptoms/diseases. This suggests that respiratory symptoms/diseases in these patients are likely caused by esophageal retention of food and secretions, and then aspiration.\n\nLaparoscopic heller myotomy for achalasia cardia-initial experience in a teaching institute.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaman, Lileswar; Iqbal, Javid; Kochhar, Rakesh; Sinha, Saroj\n\n2013-10-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy and Dor fundoplication is the surgical procedure of choice for esophageal achalasia. The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical outcome and safety of laparoscopic Heller-Dor procedure performed by using Hook electrocautery and as a teaching module for advanced laparoscopic surgery. Between January 2005 and December 2010, 25 consecutive patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation by a single surgeon. All the patients received upper gastrointestinal series (barium swallow), esophagogastroscopy, and esophageal manometry to exclude esophageal carcinoma and to confirm the diagnosis. All the patients were operated by laparoscopic modified Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication by using hook electrocautery. Among 25 operated patients, 14 were male and 11 were female with a median age of 43Â years (range 18-72Â years). The mean operative time was 93.3Â min (range 50-50Â min), the mean operative blood loss was 90Â ml (range 40-200Â ml), the median time to oral feeding was 2Â days (2-4Â days), and the median hospital stay was 4Â days (4-7Â days). There was no conversion to open surgery. Intraoperative mucosal perforation was encountered in three patients and was repaired in all of them by laparoscopic suture. All the patients had an uneventful recovery without postoperative complication and had excellent clinical response (96Â %) during follow-up. Laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation using hook electrocautery is safe, inexpensive, and effective treatment for achalasia which is useful for teaching and training surgical residents in advanced laparoscopic surgery.\n\nLong-term outcome of peroral endoscopic myotomy for esophageal achalasia in patients with previous Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKristensen, Helle Ã; KirkegÃ¥rd, Jakob; KjÃ¦r, Daniel Willy; Mortensen, Frank Viborg; Kunda, Rastislav; Bjerregaard, Niels Christian\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an emerging procedure in the treatment of esophageal achalasia, a primary motility disorder. However, the long-term outcome of POEM in patients, who have previously undergone a Heller myotomy, is unknown. Using a local database, we identified patients with esophageal achalasia, who underwent POEM. We compared patients with a previous Heller myotomy to those, who had received none or only non-surgical therapy prior to the POEM procedure. We conducted follow-up examinations at 3, 12, and 24Â months following the procedure. We included 66 consecutive patients undergoing POEM for achalasia, of which 14 (21.2Â %) had undergone a prior Heller myotomy. In both groups, the preoperative Eckardt score was 7. Postoperatively, the non-Heller group experienced a more pronounced symptom relief at both 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up compared with the Heller group, and there was a tendency for the effect of POEM to reduce over time. We suggest that there isÂ a correlation between preoperative measurements of gastroesophageal sphincterÂ pressures and the chance of a successful POEM. POEM has a place in the treatment of esophageal achalasia in patients with a prior Heller myotomy and persistent symptoms as it is a safe procedure with acceptable long-term results.\n\nGenetic diversity of Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex. Ducke) Barneby, in a forest area in Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nJÃºnior, A L Silva; Souza, L C; Pereira, A G; Caldeira, M V W; Miranda, F D\n\n2017-09-21\n\nSchizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Fabaceae) is an arboreal species, endemic to the Amazon Rainforest, popularly known as paricÃ¡. It is used on a commercial scale in the timber sector, pulp and paper production, reclamation projects in degraded and landscaped areas. However, there is no availability of genetically improved material selected for the environmental conditions of the State of EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil. In this sense, the present study aimed to characterize the genetic diversity in a population of S. amazonicum, established in a forest area in the southern region of the State of EspÃ­rito Santo, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers. DNA samples from 171 individuals were analyzed using 11 ISSR primers, which generated 79 polymorphic bands in a total of 136 fragments (58%). The polymorphic information content performed for the ISSR markers revealed a mean of 0.37, classifying them as moderately informative. The number of loci found (N = 79) was greater than that established as the optimal number (N = 69) for the analyses. High genetic diversity was found with the parameters, genetic diversity of Nei (H E = 0.375) and Shannon index (I = 0.554). The data demonstrated in the dendrogram, based on the UPGMA cluster analysis, corroborated by the Bayesian analysis performed by the STRUCTURE program, which indicated the formation of two distinct clusters (K = 2). One of the groups was formed with the majority of the individuals (153 genotypes) and the second with the minority (18 genotypes). The results revealed high genetic diversity in the population of S. amazonicum evaluated in the present study, determining the potential of the population to be used as an orchard for seed collection and production of seedlings with confirmed genetic variability.\n\nFundoplication after heller myotomy: a retrospective comparison between nissen and dor.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nMinimally invasive Heller's myotomy in children: safe and effective.\n\nPubMed\n\nAskegard-Giesmann, Johanna R; Grams, Jayleen M; Hanna, Angela M; Iqbal, Corey W; Teh, Swee; Moir, Christopher R\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to review a single institution experience of minimally invasive Heller's myotomy in pediatric patients with achalasia. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review from 1999 to 2005 identified patients 18 years old and younger who underwent a minimally invasive Heller's myotomy for achalasia. Twenty-six patients were identified with a mean age of 15 (range, 4-18 years). There were 11 female and 15 male patients. There were 3 intraoperative complications (2 esophageal mucosal injuries and 1 aspiration). There was no mortality. All 26 surgeries were completed laparoscopically. Two patients had Dor fundoplication, whereas 23 patients had Toupet fundoplication. Average length of hospital stay was 2.7 days (range, 1-4 days) excluding the 3 patients with intraoperative complications and 3.5 days for all patients (range, 1-17 days). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 0 to 75 months (mean, 20 months). Postoperatively, one patient developed reflux symptoms (incidence 4%). Seven patients (27%) had recurrence of symptoms at a mean of 13 months (range, 1-66 months) after their operation. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy with fundoplication is a safe and effective treatment of symptomatic achalasia in the pediatric population. Complications were low in this group of patients and comparable to other published reports in the literature.\n\nGenetic diversity analysis of the oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) in Huaihe River.\n\nPubMed\n\nCui, Feng; Yu, Yanyan; Bao, Fangyin; Wang, Song; Xiao, Ming Song\n\n2018-04-19\n\nThe oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) is an economically and nutritionally important species of decapod crustaceans in China. Genetic structure and demographic history of Macrobrachium nipponense were examined using sequence data from portions of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Samples of 191 individuals were collected from 10 localities in the upper to middle reaches of the Huaihe River. Variability was detected at a total of 42 nucleotide sites along 684âbp length of homologous sequence (6.14%), and base substitutions occurred mostly at the second codon position. Haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (Ï) of all populations were 0.9136âÂ±â0.0116 and 0.0078âÂ±â0.0042, respectively. Phylogenetic tree constructed using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method showed that the 44 haplotypes were assigned to two obvious clades associated with geographic regions. Moreover, the median-joining network was similar to the topology of the phylogenetic tree with 44 haplotypes. The pairwise F ST values between the populations varied from -0.0298 to 0.2994. Generally, moderate genetic differentiation (F ST â=â0.1598, pâ=â.0000) among different geographic populations was detected, with the significant differentiation between the Huaibin (HB) and other Macrobrachium nipponense populations. Both mismatch distribution analyses and neutrality tests suggested the early stage of Late Pleistocene population expansion 85,500âyears before present for the species, which was consistent with the palaeoclimatic condition of the Huaihe River Basin.\n\nFundoplication After Heller Myotomy: A Retrospective Comparison Between Nissen and Dor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: A retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia.

However, because the incidence of achalasia is low, reports on the outcome of surgical treatment for achalasia are limited. In this study, the therapeutic results after laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation for achalasia at a single university hospital were evaluated. Between August 1994 and July 2006, 100 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation. The therapeutic results after laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation were assessed based on complications, operation time, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and the standardized questionnaire for satisfaction by telephone or outpatient clinic interview. With respect to perioperative complications, lower esophageal mucosal perforation occurred in 14 patients, but all of them could be suture-obliterated laparoscopically. One patient was converted to laparotomy because of uncontrolled bleeding from the short gastric artery. The mean operative time was 169 minutes, and the mean perioperative blood loss was 22 mL. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. Reflux esophagitis, which was seen in five patients, was treated successfully with a proton pump inhibitor. According to the standardized questionnaire for satisfaction, 77 patients rated their recovery as 'excellent', 17 as 'good', 4 as 'fair', and 2 as 'poor'; thus, the overall success rate was 94%. There were no significant differences in surgical outcomes by morphologic type and severity of esophageal dilatation; however, the success rate deteriorated significantly with progression of the morphologic type. Laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation is a safe and effective surgical treatment for achalasia.\n\nTwenty-year trends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaisley, Kelly R; Preston, Jennifer F; Dolan, James P; Diggs, Brian S; Hunter, John G\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTrends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the U.S. over time have not been previously described. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we analyzed patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 20-year period (1992-2011) to estimate rates of Heller myotomy, locations where the procedures were performed (rural, urban or teaching) and changes in technique (laparoscopic vs open) as well as outcomes of length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Over the last 20 years, the total number of Heller myotomies performed in the U.S. has increased (1576 cases in 1992 to 5046 cases in 2011, pÂ =Â 0.001). These procedures are now being performed laparoscopically (0.9%-67.0%, pÂ <Â 0.001) and at urban teaching hospitals (45.4%-77.1%, pÂ <Â 0.001). In-hospital mortality has decreased (0.9%-0.3%, pÂ =Â 0.006). Hospital length of stay has decreased from 7 days to 2 days (pÂ <Â 0.001). These data show a trend of increasing utilization of laparoscopic Heller myotomy at teaching institutions with decreased in-hospital mortality and shorter LOS. Copyright Â© 2017.

My colleagues and I prefer to correct the specific anatomic problem with redo myotomy and preserve the esophagus. We examined the results of this approach. We analyzed the course of 43 patients undergoing redo Heller myotomy for achalasia between 1994 and 2011 with at least 1-year of follow-up. In 2012, a phone interview and a symptoms questionnaire were completed by 24 patients. Forty-three patients underwent redo Heller myotomy. All patients had dysphagia, 80% had had multiple dilations. Manometry confirmed the diagnosis, lower esophageal sphincter pressure averaged 17 mmHg; 24-hour pH monitoring was not useful because of fermentation; patients were divided into 4 groups according to findings on upper gastrointestinal series. Three patients underwent take down of previous fundoplication only, the remainder 40 had that and a redo myotomy with 3-cm gastric extension. Two mucosal perforations were repaired with primary closure and Dor fundoplication. At a median follow-up of 63 months, 19 of 24 patients reported improvement in dysphagia, with median overall satisfaction rating of 7 (range 3 to 10); 4 patients required esophagectomy for persistent dysphagia. The majority of failures after Heller myotomy present with dysphagia associated with esophageal narrowing. Upper gastrointestinal series is most useful to plan therapy and predicts outcomes. With few exceptions, patients improve substantially with redo myotomy, which can be accomplished laparoscopically with relatively low risk. These findings challenge the previously held concept that all myotomy failures need to be treated by an esophagectomy. Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

All case series have reported a minimum length of stay of more than 1 day. \"True\" day-case laparoscopic Heller myotomy has not been reported, so far. The aim of this study was to review our results with laparoscopic Heller myotomy with respect to the length of stay following the procedure. All patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy between August 2000 and July 2007 under the care of one surgeon were included in the study. This was performed by incising 6 cm of distal esophageal musculature, extending to 2 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. The myotomy was covered by an anterior fundoplication. All patients were reviewed in the clinic at a median of 6 weeks after surgery and, thereafter, if necessary. Over the 7-year period, 24 consecutive patients with achalasia were treated in this manner. There were 13 women and 11 men, with an age range of 12-73 years. Intraoperative complications included mucosal perforation in 2 patients (sutured immediately) with no postoperative complications or conversion to open surgery. There were no deaths. The average length of stay was 1.9 days (range, 0-4). The last 2 patients were discharged on the same day, and the 5 previous to this were discharged within 23 hours of surgery. There were no adverse outcomes related to early discharge, and there were no readmissions. All patients reported good to excellent results with a relief of dysphagia on follow-up. Three patients (12%) developed recurrent dysphagia after an initial improvement, requiring dilatation only several months later. Based on our own experience, we believe that laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior partial fundoplication is safe and achieves a good outcome in the treatment of achalasia. It is well tolerated and can be considered a true day-case procedure.\n\nSurgical Treatment for Achalasia of the Esophagus: Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTorres-Villalobos, Gonzalo; Martin-del-Campo, Luis Alfonso\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAchalasia is an esophageal motility disorder that leads to dysphagia, chest pain, and weight loss. Its diagnosis is clinically suspected and is confirmed with esophageal manometry. Although pneumatic dilation has a role in the treatment of patients with achalasia, laparoscopic Heller myotomy is considered by many experts as the best treatment modality for most patients with newly diagnosed achalasia. This review will focus on the surgical treatment of achalasia, with special emphasis on laparoscopic Heller myotomy. We will also present a brief discussion of the evaluation of patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment for achalasia and emerging technologies such as LESS, robot-assisted myotomy, and POEM.

Single-center reports suggest that there has been greater use of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia in the United States since its introduction in 1992. We aimed to study the trends of Heller myotomy and the relationship between surgery volume and perioperative outcomes. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) is a 20% stratified sample of all hospitalizations in the United States. It was used to study the macro-trends of Heller myotomy hospitalizations during 1993-2005. We also used the NIS 2003-2005 micro-data to study the periope"
