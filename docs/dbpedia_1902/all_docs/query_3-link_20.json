        "text": "Author:\n\nMarge the Moderator\n\n[ Edit | View ] Date Posted: 07:38:50 03/11/14 Tue\n\nSome people may say I'm over-reacting, but today I made the decision to remove any posts declaring any particular contestant \"the next Miss CA.\" The simple fact is, the pageant starts more than 3 months from today. Many girls who may not fit some people's idea of the next Miss CA today in March, may work their tails off and totally transform by pageant week.\n\nMore importantly, the moment someone declares anyone the next winner, the immediate response is typically someone disagreeing, pointing out \"the chosen one's\" shortcomings as they perceive them, etc. And once again, we have nasty arguments over contestants who don't deserve to be picked apart in the process.\n\nI know many of you are EDs, parents and friends who are justifiably proud of your titleholder's/daughter's/friend's accomplishments, and you are more than welcome to express your excitement here. Likewise, some of you may genuinely like some of the contestants and want to make constructive suggestions on ways to improve before the state pageant. (If that is the case, you may be better off sending them an email or a private message on Facebook.)\n\nTo summarizeï¿½\n\nAll posts of the nature of \"Suzie Smith IS the next Miss CA! Everyone else might as well stay home.\" Or, \"Suzie Smith is clearly the Chosen One this year,\" will be removed as soon as I find them. And if they have been up long enough to attract responses, positive or negative, those will be removed as well.\n\nIf you want to post \"5 reasons why Suzie Smith would make a great Miss CA,\" that's fine. Bashing responses will be removed; rational responses challenging any facts or respectfully disagreeing with the original will be allowed to stay, at least for now. I reserve the right to remove those, too, if the negativity gets out of hand.\n\nNO BASHING OF ANY CONTESTANT - \"tone deaf\" is bashing, \"she needs to work on her talent\" is not. \"Fat\" is bashing. \"Swimsuit needs work\" is OK.\n\nTop 15, Top 10, Top 5 prediction lists are fine. Personally, I prefer these lists with rationale supporting your choices, but if you just want to lists names and titles, that's your prerogative.\n\nSo these are the rules for now. But if you can't handle them in a responsible manner, then I'm afraid I'm going to have to restrict communication even further.\n\nCalifornia is blessed to have arguably the most competitive state pageants (Miss and Teen) in the nation, with the overall calibre of contestants higher than just about any other state. Let's celebrate that over the next 3 months, and make them feel loved and appreciated, the way the class of '13 so charmingly and maturely loved and appreciated each other over the last few months.\n\n[ Post a Reply to This Message ]\n\nAuthor:\n\nErnie Koneck\n\n[ Edit | View ] Date Posted: 10:07:55 09/27/13 Fri\n\nThe first locals for 2014 Miss CA contestants finally start this month, and like most years, the options for contestants prior to January 1 are few and far between. There are 7 structured locals - all single title as far as I know - Blythe, Azusa, Garden Grove, Lake County, City of Orange, San Diego and Marin County, and only one open - Hollywood/Southland.\n\nFrom what I hear, the interesting thing about Hollywood/Southland is that they have several newcomers to MAO, but only a few returning titleholders. The surprising thing about that isn't the presence of \"newbies.\" When I was ED, I always made an effort to recruit new girls to the program, and with an open it can be easier - there is at most one orientation meeting, and the entire pageant and rehearsal all take place over one weekend - so it's an easy time commitment for someone who may not know exactly what she's getting into. I think if open EDs make the effort to get new girls to enter, and don't just rely on former titleholders for contestants, opens could prove to be CA's secret weapon to expanding statewide participation in the Miss CA program, which has been slowly declining even though the number of state contestants has grown.\n\nFor those of you who do a joint structured/open pageant with more extensive training and rehearsal for your structured contestants, consider making some of those meetings optional for the open contestants.\n\nThe surprising part about Hollywood is the lack of returning titleholders who have chosen to enter. If I were a contestant in the last couple Miss CA state pageants, and I wanted to win in 2014, I would want a local title sooner rather than later, so I could focus on state and Miss America prep. Because let's face it folks, if you're not 95% Miss America-ready on Saturday night in Fresno, you're not going to be crowned. And if you seriously think that the only two girls who have a shot at the title are Jordan Krinke and Caylynn Simonson, then you don't know your Miss CA history very well.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Jordan and Caylynn are awesome contestants and would represent CA very well at Miss America. But NO ONE is a shoe-in, ever.\n\nAt this time in the 2000 pageant season, no one, not even her local director, had heard of Rita Ng. At this time in the 2002 pageant season, no one in CA had heard of Nicole Lamarche, who had been 1st runner-up in Arizona, and then quietly moved to Berkeley to attend graduate school. That year she was 1st runner-up to Jennifer Glover, and the following year she was crowned Miss CA 2003 and 4th runner-up at Miss America. At this time in the 2005 pageant season, no one had heard of Dustin-Leigh Konzelman. At this time in the 2008 pageant season, Jackie Geist was the outgoing Miss Gavilan Hills, who had won that pageant much to her own surprise, and then won nothing at Miss CA. At this time in the 2010 pageant season, people knew former MCOT Arianna Afsar would be competing somewhere as a Miss, but no one seriously thought she's win on her first try - way too young!\n\nSo, you never know. Someone no one has ever heard of, someone who has never entered a pageant before, someone who may have just moved to CA from another state may prove to be the ONE next summer. Or maybe it's you - the girl who competed last year and did well, but no one's talking about yet; or the girl who didn't place or get any special recognition who has been working hard ever since because she wants to prove she belongs at the top; or the girl that has taken a hard look at herself and decided what parts to keep and what parts to change and is reinventing herself to be the better version of herself she always knew she could be.\n\nBut, frankly, if I were any of those girls, I wouldn't waste time waiting for the \"perfect\" pageant to come along. There may not be as many opens this year as last - Anaheim Hills/North County is gone; Nat'l Orange Show/San Bernardino County is now a single crown structured pageant under new management; Monterey Bay/Central Coast may go away so Kati can focus on the Teen program. If you want to win, the worst thing you can do is waste time.\n\nGood luck everyone! Here's to awesome 2014 Miss CA class! You've got a hard act to follow!\n\n[ Post a Reply to This Message ]"
