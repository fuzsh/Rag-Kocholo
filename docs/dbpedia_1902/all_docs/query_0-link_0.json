She won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for the Metropolitan Opera production of Porgy and Bess in the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[1] Her voice has been recognized for its shining and agile upper register, \"smoky\" middle register, beautiful timbre,[2] and ability to switch from a classical to a contemporary sound. She has performed internationally and won numerous awards including a Grammy Award, Operalia and Miss Hollywood. According to family lore, her father Sylvester predicted her to be \"the next Leontyne Price\" when she was born.[3]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nBlue earned a Bachelor of Music from the University of Redlands in 2005, and a Master of Music degree in Opera Performance from UCLA[4] in 2007.
