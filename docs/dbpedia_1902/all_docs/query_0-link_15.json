        "text": "The âLearning Curveâ in Videoscopic Heller Myotomy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBloomston, Mark; Serafini, Francesco; Boyce, H. Worth\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjectives: In the early 1990s, minimally invasive videoscopy was applied to numerous operations. After undertaking more than 50 âopenâ Heller myotomies, our experience with videoscopic Heller myotomy began in 1992. We sought to determine whether the outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy is influenced by surgeon experience. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with severe dysphagia secondary to achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 and 1998. Intraoperative endoscopy was utilized to ensure adequate myotomy in all patients. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: the first 25 patients (group I), the second 25 patients (group II), and the last 28 patients (group III). Clinical outcome was based on length of stay, incidence of intraoperative complications, conversion to an âopenâ procedure, and postoperative symptoms. Results: Perioperative complications occurred in 20% of patients in group I compared with 8% and 12% in groups II and III, respectively (P = NS). Only 3 patients required conversion to an âopenâ procedure, all in group I (P < 0.05). Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 80% of patients in group I, 100% in group II, and 96% in group III (P < 0.05). Significant reductions in conversions to âopen,â length of stay, and postoperative symptoms were seen after 20 myotomies were undertaken. Conclusion: Outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy, like other videoscopic operations, improves as surgeons progress along the videoscopic âlearning curve.â After approximately 20 videoscopic Heller myotomies, surgeons can expect fewer conversions to open procedures, shorter hospital stays, and better symptomatic relief. PMID:12002295\n\nVideoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia--results beyond short-term follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Boyce, W; Mamel, J; Albrink, M; Murr, M; Durkin, A; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2000-08-01\n\nHeller myotomy has long been utilized for patients failing nonoperative management of achalasia. Videoscopy has been advocated to decrease the morbidity of Heller myotomy; however, few reports document outcome beyond 1 year after videoscopic Heller myotomy. To determine perioperative morbidity, relief of dysphagia, and the incidence of postoperative reflux symptoms following videoscopic Heller myotomy with follow-up to over 4 years. Patients with achalasia documented by barium esophogram and esophageal manometry underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy beginning in 1992. Intraoperative peroral endoscopy was utilized to guide the cephalad and caudad extent of myotomy. A barium esophogram was undertaken in the immediate postoperative period to evaluate for subclinical leak and assess esophageal emptying. Seventy-eight patients underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy. The mean age was 51 years +/- 19 (range 14 to 91). Most (62%) patients had undergone pneumatic dilation prior to surgical consultation and 54% had previous botox injections. All patients complained of dysphagia and 40% had symptoms of heartburn prior to myotomy. After myotomy, 91% of patients stated that their swallowing was improved with myotomy. Thirteen patients (18%) experience heartburn more than once per week after myotomy. The average length of stay was 2 +/- 2 days, with 72% of patients spending 2 days or fewer in the hospital. Six (7.7%) major complications occurred: five esophageal perforations and one enterotomy without long-term sequellae. Three procedures (3.8%) were converted to \"open\" procedures. No deaths occurred. We conclude that videoscopic Heller myotomy is safe and efficacious, with low morbidity and mortality. Videoscopic myotomy provides relief beyond the short term for dysphagia due to achalasia with minimal reflux symptoms. We advocate videoscopic Heller myotomy in the treatment of severe dysphagia due to achalasia not adequately palliated by or amenable to nonoperative management\n\nVideoscopic Heller Myotomy with Intraoperative Endoscopy Promotes Optimal Outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBloomston, Mark; Brady, Patrick\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are applicable to achalasia, but the optimum approach to intraoperative assessment of adequacy of myotomy remains unestablished. We set out to show that videoscopic Heller myotomy with concurrent endoscopy ensures adequacy of myotomy while limiting postoperative clinically apparent reflux. Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy with concomitant endoscopy between 1992 and 1998. Fundoplication was not routinely undertaken. Results: Preoperative symptoms consisted of dysphagia (100%), emesis/regurgitation (68%), heartburn (58%), and postprandial chest pain (49%). Following myotomy, significant improvement (P < 0.0001) was seen in dysphagia (43%), postprandial chest pain (13%), and emesis/regurgitation (9%) at a mean follow-up of 33 Â± 2.2 months. Mean reflux score (scale 0 to 5) improved from 3.7 Â± 0.3 to 1.5 Â± 0.2 (P < 0.0001). Improvement in symptoms was reported in 96% of patients. Fundoplication was used in 8 patients as part of hiatus reconstruction (n = 6) or repair of esophageal perforation (n = 2). Conclusions: Intraoperative endoscopy during video-scopic Heller myotomy guides the extent and adequacy of myotomy. By utilizing a focused dissection with preservation of the natural antireflux mechanisms around the gastroesophageal junction and limiting the extent of myotomy along the cardia, postoperative reflux symptoms are minimized. We advocate concomitant endoscopy during Heller myotomy to guide myotomy and submit that routine fundoplication is clinically unnecessary. PMID:12113416\n\nHeller Myotomy Versus Heller Myotomy With Dor Fundoplication for Achalasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichards, William O.; Torquati, Alfonso; Holzman, Michael D.; Khaitan, Leena; Byrne, Daniel; Lutfi, Rami; Sharp, Kenneth W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nObjective: We sought to determine the impact of the addition of Dor fundoplication on the incidence of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux (GER) after Heller myotomy. Summary Background Data: Based only on case series, many surgeons believe that an antireflux procedure should be added to the Heller myotomy. However, no prospective randomized data support this approach. Patients and Methods: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, institutional review board-approved clinical trial, patients with achalasia were assigned to undergo Heller myotomy or Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication. Patients were studied via 24-hour pH study and manometry at 6 months postoperatively. Pathologic GER was defined as distal esophageal time acid exposure time greater than 4.2% per 24-hour period. The outcome variables were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics between study groups. Pathologic GER occurred in 10 of 21 patients (47.6%) after Heller and in 2 of 22 patients (9.1%) after Heller plus Dor (P = 0.005). Heller plus Dor was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of GER (relative risk 0.11; 95% confidence interval 0.02â0.59; P = 0.01). Median distal esophageal acid exposure time was lower in the Heller plus Dor (0.4%; range, 0â16.7) compared with the Heller group (4.9%; range, 0.1â43.6; P = 0.001). No significant difference in surgical outcome between the 2 techniques with respect to postoperative lower-esophageal sphincter pressure or postoperative dysphagia score was observed. Conclusions: Heller Myotomy plus Dor Fundoplication was superior to Heller myotomy alone in regard to the incidence of postoperative GER. PMID:15319712\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM): feasible as reoperation following Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nVigneswaran, Yalini; Yetasook, Amy K; Zhao, Jin-Cheng; Denham, Woody; Linn, John G; Ujiki, Michael B\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of performing peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the management of recurrent achalasia after failed myotomy. Eight patients presented to our institution between October 2010 and June 2013 with recurrent/persistent symptoms after prior laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Three patients underwent redo laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and five patients consented to redo myotomy with POEM. Demographics were similar between the groups with exception of age (POEM 69.5 vs. laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) 34.5, pâ=â0.003). Preoperative Eckardt scores, motility, and prior interventions were not significantly different. Three patients who underwent POEM and two who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy had prior fundoplication. There was one perforation identified after laparoscopic Heller myotomy and one patient with persistent subcutaneous emphysema after POEM. Both POEM and laparoscopic Heller myotomy demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms and Eckardt scores at average follow-up of approximately 5 months (pâ<â0.05). POEM is a feasible option for patients after failed myotomy even in the presence of prior fundoplication. The procedure can be performed safely using a similar technique as for primary myotomy with the exception of creating the myotomy laterally along the right side of the esophagus and lesser curvature avoiding the previous anterior myotomy.\n\nReoperative Heller myotomy: more pain, less gain.\n\nPubMed\n\nWood, Thomas W; Ross, Sharona B; Ryan, Carrie E; Bowman, Ty A; Jacobi, Benjamin L; Konstantinidis, Michael G; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2015-06-01\n\nHeller myotomy provides durable and effective treatment of achalasia. Due to recurrence or persistence of symptoms, a small subset of patients seeks reoperation. This study was undertaken to determine if reoperative Heller myotomy provides salutary amelioration of symptoms. 609 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 to 2013 were prospectively followed; 38 underwent reoperative myotomy. Patients graded their symptom frequency and severity before and after myotomy on a Likert scale. Median data are reported. Patients undergoing reoperative myotomy, when compared to those undergoing their first myotomy, experienced a higher conversion rate to an \"open\" myotomy (8% vs 1%, P < 0.05) and a longer length of stay (3 vs 1 day, P < 0.05). Reoperative myotomy led to improvement in symptoms, but the magnitude of improvement in symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, choking, and coughing) was less than for patients undergoing their first myotomy (all P < 0.05). Patients undergoing reoperative Heller myotomy were less likely to report symptoms occurring once per month or less (83% vs 56%, P < 0.01). Patients undergoing reoperative myotomy note improvement in symptoms, although to a lesser extent than patients undergoing their first myotomy. Patients undergoing reoperative Heller myotomy can expect to experience less improvement of symptoms, denoting the importance of the first myotomy.\n\nThe calibrated laparoscopic Heller myotomy with fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Martino, Natale; Marano, Luigi; Torelli, Francesco; Schettino, Michele; Porfidia, Raffaele; Reda, Gianmarco; Grassia, Michele; Petrillo, Marianna; Braccio, Bartolomeo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia is the most common primary esophageal motor disorder. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy combined with fundoplication represents the treatment of choice for this disease, achieving good results in about 90% of patients. However, about 10% of treated patients refer persistent or recurrent dysphagia. Many Authors showed that this failure rate is related to inadequate myotomy. To verify, from experimental to clinical study, the modifications induced by Heller's myotomy of the esophago- gastric junction on LES pressure (LES-P profile, using a computerized manometric system. From 2002 to 2010 105 patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy followed by antireflux surgery. The calibrated Heller myotomy was extended for at least 2.5 cm on the esophagus and for 3 cm on the gastric side. Each step was evaluated by intraoperative manometry. Moreover, intraoperative manometry and endoscopy were used to calibrate the fundoplication. The preoperative mean LES-P was 37.73 Â± 12.21. After esophageal and gastric myotomy the mean pressure drop was 21.3% and 91.9%, respectively. No mortality was reported. Laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy with fundoplication achieves a good outcome in the surgical treatment of achalasia. The use of intraoperative manometry enables an adequate calibration of myotomy, being effective in the evaluation of the complete pressure drop, avoiding too long esophageal myotomy and, especially, too short gastric myotomy, that may be the cause of surgical failure.\n\nTranscervical heller myotomy using flexible endoscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpaun, Georg O; Dunst, Christy M; Arnold, Brittany N; Martinec, Danny V; Cassera, Maria A; SwanstrÃ¶m, Lee L\n\n2010-12-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia is most commonly treated by laparoscopic myotomy. Transesophageal approaches using flexible endoscopy have recently been described. We hypothesized that using techniques and flexible instruments from our NOTES experience through a small cervical incision would be a safer and less traumatic route for esophageal myotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and success rate of using flexible endoscopes to perform anterior or posterior Heller myotomy via a transcervical approach. This animal (porcine) and human cadaver study was conducted at the Legacy Research and Technology Center. Mediastinal operations on ten live, anesthetized pigs and two human cadavers were performed using standard flexible endoscopes through a small incision at the supra-sternal notch. The esophagus was dissected to the phreno-esophageal junction using balloon dilatation in the peri-esophageal space followed by either anterior or posterior distal esophageal myotomy. Success rate was recorded of esophageal dissection to the diaphragm and proximal stomach, anterior and posterior myotomy, perforation, and complication rates. Dissection of the esophagus to the diaphragm and performing esophageal myotomy was achieved in 100% of attempts. Posterior Heller myotomy was always extendable onto the gastric wall, while anterior gastric extension of the myotomy was found to be more difficult (4/4 and 2/8, respectively; P = 0.061). Heller myotomy through a small cervical incision using flexible endoscopes is feasible. A complete Heller myotomy was performed with a higher success rate posteriorly possibly due to less anatomic interference.\n\nOutcomes promote reoperative Heller myotomy for symptoms of achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRakita, S; Villadolid, D; Kalipersad, C; Thometz, D; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2007-10-01\n\nHeller myotomy is accepted as first-line therapy for achalasia, yet for a small number of patients, symptoms persist or recur after myotomy. This study was undertaken to report our results with reoperative laparoscopic Heller myotomy for recurrent symptoms of achalasia. We have undertaken laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 275 patients and reoperative myotomy in 12 patients for recurrent dysphagia, of which three had their initial myotomy undertaken by us. For each, studies prior to reoperative Heller myotomy documented a nonrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter without stricture. Patients scored symptoms before and after reoperative myotomy. Before reoperative myotomy, 75% underwent dilation and 42% underwent Botox injection. Ten of twelve reoperative myotomies were undertaken and completed laparoscopically. Median follow-up is 24.1 months (29.0 months + 25.89). Symptom frequency and severity scores improved significantly after reoperative myotomy. Frequency of vomiting and frequency and severity of heartburn were improved after reoperative myotomy, but not to a significant extent. However, they were not particularly notable prior to surgery, compared to obstructive symptoms, such as dysphagia. Excellent or good outcomes were reported in 73%, and notably, 91% stated that they would have the operation again after having been through the process firsthand and knowing their outcomes. Patient outcomes promote the application of reoperative Heller myotomy for recurrent or persistent symptoms of achalasia following Heller myotomy.\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarry, Linda; Ross, Sharona; Dahal, Sujat; Morton, Connor; Okpaleke, Chinyere; Rosas, Melissa; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2011-06-01\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is beginning to include advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious\n\nEndoscopic Therapy for Achalasia Before Heller Myotomy Results in Worse Outcomes Than Heller Myotomy Alone\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, C Daniel; Stival, Alessandro; Howell, D Lee; Swafford, Vickie\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective: Heller myotomy has been shown to be an effective primary treatment of achalasia. However, many physicians treating patients with achalasia continue to offer endoscopic therapies before recommending operative myotomy. Herein we report outcomes in 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with the majority (74%) undergoing myotomy as secondary treatment of achalasia. Methods: Data on all patients undergoing operative management of achalasia are collected prospectively. Over a 9-year period (1994â2003), 209 patients underwent Heller myotomy for achalasia. Of these, 154 had undergone either Botox injection and/or pneumatic dilation preoperatively. Preoperative, operative, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with multiple Ï2 and Mann-Whitney U analyses, as well as ANOVA. Results: Among the 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia, 154 received endoscopic therapy before being referred for surgery (100 dilation only, 33 Botox only, 21 both). The groups were matched for preoperative demographics and symptom scores for dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain. Intraoperative complications were more common in the endoscopically treated group with GI perforations being the most common complication (9.7% versus 3.6%). Postoperative complications, primarily severe dysphagia, and pulmonary complications were more common after endoscopic treatment (10.4% versus 5.4%). Failure of myotomy as defined by persistent or recurrent severe symptoms, or need for additionally therapy including redo myotomy or esophagectomy was higher in the endoscopically treated group (19.5% versus 10.1%). Conclusion: Use of preoperative endoscopic therapy remains common and has resulted in more intraoperative complications, primarily perforation, more postoperative complications, and a higher rate of failure than when no preoperative therapy was used. Endoscopic therapy for achalasia should not be used unless patients are not candidates for\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia: results after 10 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nCowgill, Sarah M; Villadolid, Desiree; Boyle, Robert; Al-Saadi, Sam; Ross, Sharona; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2009-12-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy was first undertaken in the early 1990s, and appreciable numbers of patients with 10-year follow-up periods are now available. This study was undertaken to determine long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy used to treat achalasia. Of 337 patients who have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy since 1992, 47 who underwent myotomy more than 10 years ago have been followed through a prospectively maintained registry. Among many symptoms, patients scored dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn before and after myotomy using a Likert scale with choices ranging from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Symptom scores before and after myotomy were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Data are reported as median (mean Â± standard deviation). The median length of the hospital stay was 2 days (mean, 3 Â± 8.6 days; range, 1-60 days). Notable complications were infrequent after myotomy. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient required a redo myotomy after 5 years due to recurrence of symptoms. At this writing, 33 patients (70%) are still alive. The causes of death after discharge were unrelated to myotomy. The frequency and severity scores for dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn all decreased significantly after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (p < 0.0001 for all). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy can be undertaken with few complications. This procedure significantly decreases the frequency and severity of achalasia symptoms without promoting heartburn. The symptoms of achalasia are durably ameliorated by laparoscopic Heller myotomy during long-term follow-up evaluation, thereby promoting application of this procedure.\n\nDoes concomitant anterior fundoplication promote dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy?\n\nPubMed\n\nTapper, Donovan; Morton, Connor; Kraemer, Emily; Villadolid, Desiree; Ross, Sharona B; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2008-07-01\n\nConcerns for gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia justify considerations of concomitant anterior fundoplication. This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Notably, relative to patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test) and to less frequent and severe dysphagia and choking (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia. Concomitant anterior fundoplication decreases the frequency and severity of heartburn and dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Concomitant anterior fundoplication promotes salutary relief in the frequency and severity of symptoms after myotomy and is warranted.\n\nIntraoperative Assessment of Esophagogastric Junction Distensibility During Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeHaan, Reece K; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe sought to characterize the changes in esophagogastric junction (EGJ) distensibility during Heller Myotomy with Dor fundoplication using the EndoFLIP device. Intraoperative distensibility measurements on 14 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication were conducted over an 18-month period. Minimum esophageal diameter, cross-sectional areas, and distensibility index were measured at 30 and 40 mL catheter volumes before myotomy, postmyotomy, and following Dor fundoplication. Distensibility index is defined as the narrowest cross-sectional area divided by the corresponding pressure expressed in mm/mm Hg. Heller myotomy was found to lead to significant changes in the distensibility characteristics of the EGJ. Minimum esophageal diameter and EGJ distensibility increased significantly with Heller myotomy.\n\nTreatments for pediatric achalasia: Heller myotomy or pneumatic dilatation?\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, C; Michaud, L; Mougenot, J-F; Lamblin, M-D; Philippe-Chomette, P; Cargill, G; Bonnevalle, M; Boige, N; BellaÃ¯che, M; Viala, J; Hugot, J-P; Gottrand, F; Cezard, J-P\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe treatment of achalasia consists of reducing distal esophageal obstruction by either Heller myotomy surgery or endoscopic pneumatic dilatation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short- and middle-term results of these procedures in children. For technical reasons, children under six years old (n=8) were treated by surgery only, whereas patients over six years old (n=14) were treated by either Heller myotomy or pneumatic dilatation. Of the children aged under six years, 75% were symptom-free at six months and 83% at 24 months of follow-up. Of the patients aged over six years, complete remission was achieved by Heller myotomy in 44.5% vs. 55.5% by pneumatic dilatation after six months, and in 40% vs. 65%, respectively, after 24 months. Both pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy showed significant rates of failure. These results suggest that pneumatic dilatation may be considered a primary treatment in children over six years old. Also, where necessary, Heller myotomy and pneumatic dilatation may be used as complementary treatments.\n\nRobot-assisted Heller's myotomy for achalasia in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nAltokhais, Tariq; Mandora, Hala; Al-Qahtani, Ayed; Al-Bassam, Abdulrahman\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAchalasia is rare in children. Surgical options include open, laparoscopic and robotic approaches. However, Heller's myotomy remains the treatment of choice. This report describes our experience with robot-assisted Heller's myotomy in children and presents a review of the literature. Included in this study are children who underwent robot-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia via the Da Vinci surgical system between 2004 and 2015 at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The medical records of these patients were reviewed for demographic data, presenting symptoms, diagnostic modalities, operative procedures, complications, outcomes and follow-ups. Six patients were identified. The age of the patients at surgery ranged between 2 and 12 years (mean 7.1 years). The most common presenting symptoms were dysphagia, vomiting and nocturnal cough. Contrast swallow and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy established a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia in all of the patients. Four patients underwent esophageal dilatation 2-5 times before the definitive procedure. All patients underwent successful robot-assisted Heller's myotomy with concomitant partial posterior fundoplication. The postoperative course was uneventful. Five patients had a complete resolution of the symptoms and one patient improved. The follow-up assessments have been consistent and have ranged from 0.5 to 11 years (mean 4.4 years). Robotic-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia in children is safe and effective and is a suitable alternative to open and laparoscopic approaches.\n\nPeroral Endoscopic Myotomy Versus Heller Myotomy for Achalasia: Pros and Cons.\n\nPubMed\n\nTefas, Cristian; Ababneh, Rami; TanÅ£Äu, Marcel\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAchalasia is an esophageal motor disorder that has multiple endoscopic and surgical methods of treatment. However, there is no consensus on optimal therapy in patients suffering from this disorder. This review discusses two therapies with similar but technically different concepts, peroral endoscopic myotomy and Heller surgical myotomy. After a brief introduction to the basic problems of achalasia, technical considerations, intra and postprocedural complications are presented and the advantages and disadvantages of the two procedures are discussed, based on the relevant articles in the literature. Heller surgical myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy appear to be similar in performance with similar results in terms of gastroesophageal reflux rates. However, with experience being gained in the field of endoscopic myotomy, this procedure seems more advantageous, with similar success rates to those of the established surgical technique, but offering shorter operating times, shorter hospitalizations and, ultimately, lower costs.

The best treatment is surgical and the laparoscopic approach may have good results. To assess the results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy among patients with achalasia. Prospective study of patients subjected to a laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1995 and 2004. Clinical features, early and late operative results were assessed. Twenty seven patients aged 12 to 74 years (12 females) were operated. All had disphagia lasting for a mean of 32 months. Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure ranged from 18 to 85 mmHg. Eight patients received other treatments prior to surgery but symptoms persisted or reappeared. The preoperative clinical score was 7. No patient died and no procedure had to be converted to open surgery. In a follow up of 21 to 131 months, all patients are satisfied with the surgical results and the postoperative clinical score is 1. Only one patient with a mega esophagus maintained a clinical score of six. In this series of patients, laparoscopic Heller myotomy was an effective and safe treatment for esophageal achalasia.\n\nLong-term outcome of peroral endoscopic myotomy for esophageal achalasia in patients with previous Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKristensen, Helle Ã; KirkegÃ¥rd, Jakob; KjÃ¦r, Daniel Willy; Mortensen, Frank Viborg; Kunda, Rastislav; Bjerregaard, Niels Christian\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an emerging procedure in the treatment of esophageal achalasia, a primary motility disorder. However, the long-term outcome of POEM in patients, who have previously undergone a Heller myotomy, is unknown. Using a local database, we identified patients with esophageal achalasia, who underwent POEM. We compared patients with a previous Heller myotomy to those, who had received none or only non-surgical therapy prior to the POEM procedure. We conducted follow-up examinations at 3, 12, and 24Â months following the procedure. We included 66 consecutive patients undergoing POEM for achalasia, of which 14 (21.2Â %) had undergone a prior Heller myotomy. In both groups, the preoperative Eckardt score was 7. Postoperatively, the non-Heller group experienced a more pronounced symptom relief at both 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up compared with the Heller group, and there was a tendency for the effect of POEM to reduce over time. We suggest that there isÂ a correlation between preoperative measurements of gastroesophageal sphincterÂ pressures and the chance of a successful POEM. POEM has a place in the treatment of esophageal achalasia in patients with a prior Heller myotomy and persistent symptoms as it is a safe procedure with acceptable long-term results.\n\nDefining the learning curve of laparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, Sharona B; Luberice, Kenneth; Kurian, Tony J; Paul, Harold; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2013-08-01\n\nInitial outcomes suggest laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication provides safe, efficacious, and cosmetically superior outcomes relative to conventional laparoscopy. This study was undertaken to define the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. One hundred patients underwent LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptom frequency and severity were scored using a Likert scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Symptom resolution, additional trocars, and complications were compared among patient quartiles. Median data are presented. Preoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 10/8 and regurgitation = 8/7. Additional trocars were placed in 12 patients (10%), of whom all were in the first two quartiles. Esophagotomy/gastrotomy occurred in three patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 9 per cent. No conversions to \"open\" operations occurred. Length of stay was 1 day. Postoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 2/0 and regurgitation = 0/0; scores were less than before myotomy (P < 0.001). There were no apparent scars, except where additional trocars were placed. LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication well palliates symptoms of achalasia with no apparent scar. Placement of additional trocars only occurred early in the experience. For surgeons proficient with the conventional laparoscopic approach, the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication is short and safe, because proficiency is quickly attained.\n\nPer-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) After Previous Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy Is Feasible and Safe in a Porcine Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiles, Luke F; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C; Dua, Kulwinder S; Jensen, Eric S; Kastenmeier, Andrew S\n\n2015-10-01\n\nWe sought to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and difficulty of performing the per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) procedure in the setting of a prior Heller myotomy using a survival porcine model. Four pigs underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy with Dor partial anterior fundoplication followed by the POEM performed 4 weeks later. Two additional pigs served as controls, undergoing only the POEM. All procedures were completed without complications. The revisional POEM was not significantly more difficult than POEM controls based on procedure time, POEM procedure components, or procedure difficulty scores. Revisional POEM had a longer mean operative time when compared with Heller myotomy (126.0 vs. 83.8 min; P<0.01) but had a lower total difficulty score (28.6 vs. 52.1; Pâª0.01). A POEM after previous Heller myotomy is safe and feasible in the porcine model and has potential as an option for patients suffering from recurrent or persistent symptoms after failed surgical myotomy.\n\nPeroral endoscopic remyotomy for failed Heller myotomy: a prospective single-center study.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, P H; Li, Q L; Yao, L Q; Xu, M D; Chen, W F; Cai, M Y; Hu, J W; Li, L; Zhang, Y Q; Zhong, Y S; Ma, L L; Qin, W Z; Cui, Z\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecurrence/persistence of symptoms occurs in approximately 20 % of patients after Heller myotomy for achalasia. Controversy exists regarding the therapy for patients in whom Heller myotomy has failed. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), a new endoscopic myotomy technique, for patients with failed Heller myotomy. A total of 12 patients with recurrence/persistence of symptoms after Heller myotomy, as diagnosed by established methods and an Eckardt score of â¥ 4, were prospectively included. The primary outcome was symptom relief during follow-up, defined as an Eckardt score of â¤ 3. Secondary outcomes were procedure-related adverse events, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure on manometry, reflux symptoms, and medication use before and after POEM. All 12 patients underwent successful POEM after a mean of 11.9 years (range 2 - 38 years) from the time of the primary Heller myotomy. No serious complications related to POEM were encountered. During a mean follow-up period of 10.4 months (range 5 - 14 months), treatment success was achieved in 11/12 patients (91.7 %; mean score pre- vs. post-treatment 9.2 vs. 1.3; P < 0.001). Mean LES pressure was 29.4 mmHg pre-treatment and 13.5 mmHg post-treatment (P < 0.001). One patient developed mild reflux symptoms and required intermittent medication with proton pump inhibitors. POEM seems to be a promising new treatment for failed Heller myotomy resulting in short-term symptom relief in > 90 % of cases. Previous Heller myotomy may make subsequent endoscopic remyotomy more challenging, but does not prevent successful POEM.

Patients' symptoms include dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, heartburn, and chest pain. Achalasia is a chronic condition without cure, and treatment options are aimed at providing symptomatic relief, improving esophageal emptying, and preventing the development of megaesophagus. Presently, a laparoscopic Heller myotomy with a partial fundoplication is considered the best treatment modality. A properly executed operation is key for the success of a laparoscopic Heller myotomy.\n\nA single institution's experience with more than 500 laparoscopic Heller myotomies for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander S; Morton, Connor A; Rosas, Melissa; Albrink, Michael; Ross, Sharona B\n\n2010-05-01\n\nLong-term symptom relief and patient satisfaction after Heller myotomy are being reported. Herein, we report the largest experience of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia. Since 1992, 505 patients have been prospectively followed after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Until 2004, concomitant fundoplication was undertaken for a patulous hiatus, a large hiatal hernia, or to buttress the repair of an esophagotomy, then concomitant fundoplication became routinely applied. More recently, laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) Heller myotomy has been performed when possible to improve cosmesis. Before and after myotomy, patients scored their symptoms. Before myotomy, 60% of patients underwent endoscopic therapy; of these patients, 27% had Botox (Allergan) therapy alone, 52% underwent dilation therapy alone, and 21% had both. Esophagotomy occurred in 7% of patients. Concomitant diverticulectomy was undertaken in 7%, fundoplication was performed in 59%, and LESS Heller myotomy was done in 12%. Median length of stay was 1 day. With mean follow-up at 31 months, the severity of all symptoms improved significantly. After myotomy, 95% experienced symptoms less than once per week, 86% believed their outcome is satisfying or better, and 92% would undergo myotomy again, if necessary. Symptoms after myotomy are similar with or without fundoplication and regardless of the laparoscopic approach used. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy safely and durably relieves symptoms of dysphagia. Confinement is short and satisfaction is very high. Relief of esophageal obstruction is paramount; the approach used or the application of a fundoplication has a lesser impact. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy, preferably with anterior fundoplication using a single site laparoscopic approach, is strongly encouraged for patients with symptomatic achalasia and is efficacious even after failures of dilation and/or Botox therapy.

This study was undertaken to identify the causes of their dissatisfaction. Patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy from 1992 to 2015 were prospectively followed. Using a Likert scale, patients rated their symptom frequency/severity before and after the procedure. Patients graded their experience from \"Very Satisfying\" to \"Very Unsatisfying.\" 647 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Fifty (8%) patients, median age 57 years and BMI 24Â kg/m 2 reported dissatisfaction at follow-up subsequent to myotomy. \"Dissatisfied\" patients were more likely to have undergone prior abdominal operations (pÂ =Â 0.01) or previous myotomies (pÂ =Â 0.02). \"Dissatisfied\" patients had a greater incidence of diverticulectomy (pÂ =Â 0.03) and had longer postoperative LOS (pÂ =Â 0.01). Symptom frequency/severity persisted after myotomy for dissatisfied patients (pÂ >Â 0.05). Dissatisfaction after laparoscopic Heller myotomy is directly related to persistent/recurrent symptoms. Previous abdominal operations/myotomies, diverticulectomies, and longer LOS are predictors of dissatisfaction. With this understanding, we can identify patients who might be more prone to dissatisfaction. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

My colleagues and I prefer to correct the specific anatomic problem with redo myotomy and preserve the esophagus. We examined the results of this approach. We analyzed the course of 43 patients undergoing redo Heller myotomy for achalasia between 1994 and 2011 with at least 1-year of follow-up. In 2012, a phone interview and a symptoms questionnaire were completed by 24 patients. Forty-three patients underwent redo Heller myotomy. All patients had dysphagia, 80% had had multiple dilations. Manometry confirmed the diagnosis, lower esophageal sphincter pressure averaged 17 mmHg; 24-hour pH monitoring was not useful because of fermentation; patients were divided into 4 groups according to findings on upper gastrointestinal series. Three patients underwent take down of previous fundoplication only, the remainder 40 had that and a redo myotomy with 3-cm gastric extension. Two mucosal perforations were repaired with primary closure and Dor fundoplication. At a median follow-up of 63 months, 19 of 24 patients reported improvement in dysphagia, with median overall satisfaction rating of 7 (range 3 to 10); 4 patients required esophagectomy for persistent dysphagia. The majority of failures after Heller myotomy present with dysphagia associated with esophageal narrowing. Upper gastrointestinal series is most useful to plan therapy and predicts outcomes. With few exceptions, patients improve substantially with redo myotomy, which can be accomplished laparoscopically with relatively low risk. These findings challenge the previously held concept that all myotomy failures need to be treated by an esophagectomy. Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patient-reported outcomes are needed to determine whether the findings are sustained long-term. We actively engaged participants from the prior randomized cohort, making up to six contact attempts per person using telephone, mail, and electronic messaging. We collected patient-reported measures of dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux using the Dysphagia Score and the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) instrument. Patient-reported re-interventions for dysphagia were verified by obtaining longitudinal medical records. Among living participants, 27/41 (66%) were contacted and all completed the follow-up study at a mean of 11.8Â years postoperatively. Median Dysphagia Scores and GERD-HRQL scores were slightly worse for Heller than Heller plus Dor but were not statistically different (6 vs 3, pÂ =Â 0.08 for dysphagia, 15 vs 13, pÂ =Â 0.25 for reflux). Five patients in the Heller group and 6 in Heller plus Dor underwent re-intervention for dysphagia with most occurring more than five years postoperatively. One patient in each group underwent redo Heller myotomy and subsequent esophagectomy. Nearly all patients (96%) would undergo operation again. Long-term patient-reported outcomes after Heller alone and Heller plus Dor for achalasia are comparable, providing support for either procedure.\n\nOperative interventions for failed heller myotomy: a single institution experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nPallati, Pradeep K; Mittal, Sumeet K\n\n2011-03-01\n\nRecurrent dysphagia and/or gastroesophageal reflux (GER) are failures of treatment after Heller myotomy for achalasia. We present our single center experience with surgical interventions for these failures. We did a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Based on preoperative symptoms and endoscopy, esophagogram, and manometry results, patients were divided into three groups to guide management. Telephone follow-up was done using a structured foregut questionnaire. Between December 2003 and June 2009, 16 patients underwent operative interventions for disabling symptoms after previous Heller myotomy. Eight patients presented primarily with recurrent dysphagia and underwent transabdominal Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication. Seven patients reported good to excellent symptom relief at mean follow-up of 42 months. One patient reported no relief and eventually required esophageal bypass with retrosternal gastric pull-up. Four patients presented with uncontrolled GER. Two patients who underwent redo partial fundoplication reported poor symptomatic outcome and one patient has since undergone short limb Roux-en-y gastric bypass (SLRNYGB) with excellent symptom relief. The other two patients underwent SLRNYGB with excellent relief at 10 months. Four patients had end stage achalasia and underwent esophageal resection with reconstruction. All reported excellent symptom relief at mean follow-up of 36 months. Transabdominal redo Heller myotomy for dysphagia has good outcomes. Redo fundoplication for GER after previous myotomy has poor results and SLRNYGB is an effective option in these patients. Esophageal resection remains an effective, albeit morbid, option for end-stage achalasia.\n\nImprovement of respiratory symptoms following Heller myotomy for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhandelwal, Saurabh; Petersen, Rebecca; Tatum, Roger; Sinan, Huseyin; Aaronson, Daniel; Mier, Fernando; Martin, Ana V; Pellegrini, Carlos A; Oelschlager, Brant K\n\n2011-02-01\n\nAlthough patients with achalasia complain mainly of dysphagia, we have observed that they also have a high rate of respiratory problems. We hypothesized that the latter may be due to poor esophageal clearance leading to aspiration. This study examines the effect of Heller myotomy on these symptoms. We studied the course of 111 patients with achalasia who underwent Heller myotomy between 1994 and 2008 and who agreed to participate in this study. All patients completed a questionnaire postoperatively assessing the preoperative and postoperative prevalence and severity of symptoms using visual analog scales. Patients were divided into two groups: one that included all those with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, hoarseness, cough, wheezing, sore throat, and/or a history of asthma or pneumonia) prior to myotomy and one that included those without those symptoms. All patients presented with dysphagia as their primary complaint, and 63 (57%) reported respiratory symptoms or disease prior to surgery. There were no significant differences in preoperative characteristics between those with and without respiratory manifestations. After a median follow-up of 71 months (range 9-186 months), 55 (87%) patients reported durable improvement of dysphagia. The frequency and severity of all respiratory symptoms decreased significantly. Twenty-four of the 29 patients (82%) who reported a history of pneumonia prior to surgery did not experience recurrent episodes after Heller myotomy. A Heller myotomy is effective in improving esophageal emptying in patients with achalasia. This results in sustained improvement of dysphagia and associated respiratory symptoms/diseases. This suggests that respiratory symptoms/diseases in these patients are likely caused by esophageal retention of food and secretions, and then aspiration.\n\nSurgical Treatment for Achalasia of the Esophagus: Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTorres-Villalobos, Gonzalo; Martin-del-Campo, Luis Alfonso\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAchalasia is an esophageal motility disorder that leads to dysphagia, chest pain, and weight loss. Its diagnosis is clinically suspected and is confirmed with esophageal manometry. Although pneumatic dilation has a role in the treatment of patients with achalasia, laparoscopic Heller myotomy is considered by many experts as the best treatment modality for most patients with newly diagnosed achalasia. This review will focus on the surgical treatment of achalasia, with special emphasis on laparoscopic Heller myotomy. We will also present a brief discussion of the evaluation of patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment for achalasia and emerging technologies such as LESS, robot-assisted myotomy, and POEM.

A retrospective clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the indication, technique and controversies of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in the achalasia treatment. The following symptoms were evaluated prior and after Heller myotomy: dysphagia, heartburn, nausea/vomiting after meal and asthma/coughing. The patients were evaluated by the use of Likert score. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student t test. The intra-operative (operation time, intraoperative complications, blood loss, conversion rate), and peri-operative parameters (morbidity, mortality, hospital stay) were evaluated as well. The patients who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy were included in the trial. All patients were perioperatively managed by a multidisciplinary team. The evaluation of fourteen patients was performed (average age: 53.2 yrs., eleven men, two women, BMI 23.6 kg/m(2)). The patients were indicated for surgery in all of the stages (I-III). Previous semiconservative therapeutic modalities were performed in thirteen patients. The standard laparoscopic technique for Heller myotomy with semifundoplication was applied. All the observed symptoms were statistically improved after the surgery (p=0.05). The average operating time was 89 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was below 20 ml. There was no conversion to open surgery. An average hospital stay was 4.3 days. Morbidity was 14.3 % and mortality 0 %. In one patient esophageal mucosa perforation was intra-operatively identified and sutured. Post-operative course in this patient was without any complications. The laparoscopic Heller myotomy has become the \"gold standard\" procedure for achalasia. It is an excellent method allowing precise operation technique with good visualization of the esophagogastric junction. The operation with this approach is safe, efficient, and with excellent reproducible operative results.

METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy; an anterior partial fundoplication in 17, and angle of His reconstruction in 15 cases represented the antireflux procedure of choice. RESULTS: There were no morbidity and mortality recorded in both anterior funduplication and angle of His reconstruction groups. No differences were detected in terms of recurrent dysphagia, p.o. reflux or medical therapy. CONCLUSION: To reduce the incidence of recurrent achalasia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy, we believe that Hisâ angle reconstruction is a safe and effective alternative to the anterior fundoplication. PMID:15770738\n\nAfter laparoscopic Heller myotomy, do emergency department visits or readmissions predict poor long-term outcomes?\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, Sharona; Villadolid, Desiree; Al-Saadi, Sam; Boyle, Robert; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander\n\n2008-12-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy is a first-line treatment for achalasia. To improve outcomes after myotomy and to determine if poor early results predict later outcomes, emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions within 60 days following laparoscopic Heller myotomy were studied. Since 1992, 352 patients have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy and are followed through a prospectively maintained registry. Causes of ED visits and readmissions within 60 days after myotomy were determined. Patients scored their symptoms of achalasia before myotomy and at last follow-up; scores were compared to determine if the reasons leading to ED visits and/or readmissions impacted long-term outcome after myotomy. Fourteen (4%) patients had ED visits, and 18 (5%) patients had readmissions within 60 days following myotomy. Sixty-four percent of ED visits were for dysphagia/vomiting and 36% were for abdominal/chest pain, while 37% of readmissions were for dysphagia/vomiting. Pneumonia was complicated by empyema in four patients, all without leaks; two patients expired. Despite ED visits/readmissions, achalasia symptom (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, choking, heartburn, and chest pain) frequency and severity scores improved after myotomy (p < 0.05 for all). ED visits and readmissions are infrequent following laparoscopic Heller myotomy. ED visits were generally due to complaints related to achalasia or edema after myotomy, while readmissions were generally related to complications of operative intervention or chronic ill health. Despite ED visits or readmissions early after myotomy, symptoms of achalasia are well palliated by myotomy long-term.\n\nLong-term results of Heller myotomy without an antireflux procedure in achalasic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nCortesini, Camillo; Cianchi, Fabio; Pucciani, Filippo\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBoth open and laparoscopic myotomies have been used in the treatment of achalasia. Postoperative gastro-oesophageal reflux is among the commonly reported side effects of myotomy. The addition of an antireflux procedure to the standard surgical approach has given rise to controversy. The objective of our study was to determine whether or not an antireflux procedure should be used in addition to Heller myotomy. Over the period from 1980 to 1990, 94 patients (mean age: 47.9 years) with achalasia underwent Heller myotomy calibrated by intraoperative oesophageal manometry without fundoplication. In 1999-2000, all patients filled in a clinical questionnaire: all underwent radiographic oesophageal imaging, oesophageal manometry, ambulatory 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring, and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, when necessary. Ten healthy age-matched subjects were compared in the manometric and radiological studies. Myotomy improved the clinical profiles and instrumental data results in all patients. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was present in 10 patients (10.6%); none of these 10 subjects presented oesophagitis. Heller open myotomy yields good long-term results. Intraoperative manometric calibration reduces the side effects of myotomy, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux. The addition of fundoplication is not justified in all patients.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia: changing trend toward \"true\" day-case procedure.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgrawal, Sanjay; Super, Paul\n\n2008-12-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy is the most effective therapy for achalasia. All case series have reported a minimum length of stay of more than 1 day. \"True\" day-case laparoscopic Heller myotomy has not been reported, so far. The aim of this study was to review our results with laparoscopic Heller myotomy with respect to the length of stay following the procedure. All patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy between August 2000 and July 2007 under the care of one surgeon were included in the study. This was performed by incising 6 cm of distal esophageal musculature, extending to 2 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. The myotomy was covered by an anterior fundoplication. All patients were reviewed in the clinic at a median of 6 weeks after surgery and, thereafter, if necessary. Over the 7-year period, 24 consecutive patients with achalasia were treated in this manner. There were 13 women and 11 men, with an age range of 12-73 years. Intraoperative complications included mucosal perforation in 2 patients (sutured immediately) with no postoperative complications or conversion to open surgery. There were no deaths. The average length of stay was 1.9 days (range, 0-4). The last 2 patients were discharged on the same day, and the 5 previous to this were discharged within 23 hours of surgery. There were no adverse outcomes related to early discharge, and there were no readmissions. All patients reported good to excellent results with a relief of dysphagia on follow-up. Three patients (12%) developed recurrent dysphagia after an initial improvement, requiring dilatation only several months later. Based on our own experience, we believe that laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior partial fundoplication is safe and achieves a good outcome in the treatment of achalasia. It is well tolerated and can be considered a true day-case procedure.\n\nFundoplication after heller myotomy: a retrospective comparison between nissen and dor.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy provides durable relief from achalasia and salvages failures after botox or dilation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander; Villadolid, Desiree; Thometz, Donald; Kalipersad, Candice; Rakita, Steven; Albrink, Michael; Johnson, Milton; Boyce, Worth\n\n2005-05-01\n\nTo report outcome after laparoscopic Heller myotomy in a large number of patients. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy has been undertaken for over a decade, but most studies involve small numbers of patients with limited follow-up. Since 1992, 262 patients have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy and been prospectively followed. Concomitant fundoplication was undertaken for a patulous hiatus or large hiatal hernia or to buttress the repair of an esophagotomy until recently when it became routinely applied. With mean follow-up at 32 months, symptoms were scored by patients on a Likert scale (frequency: 0 = Never to 10 = Every time I eat/always; severity: 0 = Not bothersome to 10 = Very bothersome). Before myotomy, 79% received Botox or bag dilation: 52% had Botox, 59% underwent dilation, and 36% had both. Inadvertent esophagotomy occurred in 5%. Concomitant diverticulectomy was undertaken in 4%, and fundoplication was undertaken in 30%. Complications were infrequent. Median length of stay was 1 day. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia and reflux significantly decreased. Eighty-eight percent of patients felt their symptoms were greatly improved or resolved, and 90% felt their outcome was satisfying or better. Ninety-three percent felt they would undergo myotomy again, if necessary. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy can safely and durably relieve symptoms of dysphagia while also reducing symptoms of reflux. Length of stay is short and patient satisfaction is very high with extended follow-up. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is strongly encouraged for patients with symptomatic achalasia and is efficacious even after failures of dilation and/or Botox therapy.\n\nMinimally invasive Heller's myotomy in children: safe and effective.\n\nPubMed\n\nAskegard-Giesmann, Johanna R; Grams, Jayleen M; Hanna, Angela M; Iqbal, Corey W; Teh, Swee; Moir, Christopher R\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to review a single institution experience of minimally invasive Heller's myotomy in pediatric patients with achalasia. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review from 1999 to 2005 identified patients 18 years old and younger who underwent a minimally invasive Heller's myotomy for achalasia. Twenty-six patients were identified with a mean age of 15 (range, 4-18 years). There were 11 female and 15 male patients. There were 3 intraoperative complications (2 esophageal mucosal injuries and 1 aspiration). There was no mortality. All 26 surgeries were completed laparoscopically. Two patients had Dor fundoplication, whereas 23 patients had Toupet fundoplication. Average length of hospital stay was 2.7 days (range, 1-4 days) excluding the 3 patients with intraoperative complications and 3.5 days for all patients (range, 1-17 days). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 0 to 75 months (mean, 20 months). Postoperatively, one patient developed reflux symptoms (incidence 4%). Seven patients (27%) had recurrence of symptoms at a mean of 13 months (range, 1-66 months) after their operation. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy with fundoplication is a safe and effective treatment of symptomatic achalasia in the pediatric population. Complications were low in this group of patients and comparable to other published reports in the literature.\n\nTwenty-year trends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaisley, Kelly R; Preston, Jennifer F; Dolan, James P; Diggs, Brian S; Hunter, John G\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTrends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the U.S. over time have not been previously described. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we analyzed patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 20-year period (1992-2011) to estimate rates of Heller myotomy, locations where the procedures were performed (rural, urban or teaching) and changes in technique (laparoscopic vs open) as well as outcomes of length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Over the last 20 years, the total number of Heller myotomies performed in the U.S. has increased (1576 cases in 1992 to 5046 cases in 2011, pÂ =Â 0.001). These procedures are now being performed laparoscopically (0.9%-67.0%, pÂ <Â 0.001) and at urban teaching hospitals (45.4%-77.1%, pÂ <Â 0.001). In-hospital mortality has decreased (0.9%-0.3%, pÂ =Â 0.006). Hospital length of stay has decreased from 7 days to 2 days (pÂ <Â 0.001). These data show a trend of increasing utilization of laparoscopic Heller myotomy at teaching institutions with decreased in-hospital mortality and shorter LOS. Copyright Â© 2017.

Summary Background Data: Laparoscopic Heller myotomy has been undertaken for over a decade, but most studies involve small numbers of patients with limited follow-up. Methods: Since 1992, 262 patients have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy and been prospectively followed. Concomitant fundoplication was undertaken for a patulous hiatus or large hiatal hernia or to buttress the repair of an esophagotomy until recently when it became routinely applied. With mean follow-up at 32months, symptoms were scored by patients on a Likert scale (frequency: 0 = Never to 10 = Every time I eat/always; severity: 0 = Not bothersome to 10 = Very bothersome). Results: Before myotomy, 79% received Botox or bag dilation: 52% had Botox, 59% underwent dilation, and 36% had both. Inadvertent esophagotomy occurred in 5%. Concomitant diverticulectomy was undertaken in 4%, and fundoplication was undertaken in 30%. Complications were infrequent. Median length of stay was 1 day. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia and reflux significantly decreased. Eighty-eight percent of patients felt their symptoms were greatly improved or resolved, and 90% felt their outcome was satisfying or better. Ninety-three percent felt they would undergo myotomy again, if necessary. Conclusions: Laparoscopic Heller myotomy can safely and durably relieve symptoms of dysphagia while also reducing symptoms of reflux. Length of stay is short and patient satisfaction is very high with extended follow-up. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is strongly encouraged for patients with symptomatic achalasia and is efficacious even after failures of dilation and/or Botox therapy.

Materials and Methods: From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Results: Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Conclusion: Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.

A MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed articles published in English from 1970 to December 2008 was performed using the following terms: esophageal achalasia, Heller myotomy, and revisional surgery. Thirty-three articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. A total of 12,727 patients, with mean age of 43.3Â years (males 46% and females 50%), underwent Heller myotomy (open 94.8% and laparoscopic 5.2%). Revisional surgery was performed in 6.19%. Procedures performed included revision of the original myotomy or creation of a new myotomy with or without an antireflux procedure or esophagectomy. Reasons for reoperation were incomplete myotomy (51.8%), onset of reflux (34%), megaesophagus (16.2%), and esophageal carcinoma (3.04%). Systematic review of the literature for revisional surgery following Heller myotomy revealed a 6.19% rate of reoperation with a low mortality rate.\n\nLimited Hiatal Dissection Without Fundoplication Results in Comparable Symptomatic Outcomes to Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Anterior Fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeHaan, Reece K; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C\n\n2016-07-01\n\nPrevious randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that partial fundoplication following Heller myotomy results in less pathologic acid exposure to the esophagus when compared to myotomy without fundoplication. Recent studies have questioned the necessity of a fundoplication, especially when a limited hiatal dissection (LHD) is performed and the angle of His is preserved. This is a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data. All patients underwent primary Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 30-month period. In select patients, an LHD was performed anteriorly. Symptomatic outcomes were assessed up to 2 years postoperation using the Achalasia Severity Questionnaire (ASQ), Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL). A total of 31 patients underwent Heller myotomy during the study interval. The majority of patients underwent Heller myotomy with full hiatal dissection (FHD) (21, 68%). Intraoperative mucosal perforations occurred in 3 (14%) patients undergoing FHD. Patient demographics, surgery details, and baseline symptomatic outcomes did not differ significantly preoperatively. At greater than 1 year postoperation, there was no significant difference between the groups for ASQ, GERD-HRQL, and GIGLI (Pâ=â.76, .78, and .33, respectively). Heller myotomy with LHD and no fundoplication and Heller myotomy with FHD and partial fundoplication result in similar GERD-related quality of life outcomes. Further studies (including pH studies) are necessary to determine if fundoplication is a necessary step in selected patients in whom an LHD is possible.\n\nTrends of Heller myotomy hospitalizations for achalasia in the United States, 1993-2005: effect of surgery volume on perioperative outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Y Richard; Dempsey, Daniel T; Friedenberg, Frank K; Richter, Joel E\n\n2008-10-01\n\nAchalasia is a rare chronic disorder of esophageal motor function. Single-center reports suggest that there has been greater use of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia in the United States since its introduction in 1992. We aimed to study the trends of Heller myotomy and the relationship between surgery volume and perioperative outcomes. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) is a 20% stratified sample of all hospitalizations in the United States. It was used to study the macro-trends of Heller myotomy hospitalizations during 1993-2005. We also used the NIS 2003-2005 micro-data to study the perioperative outcomes of Heller myotomy hospitalizations, using other achalasia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy hospitalizations as control groups. The generalized linear model with repeated observations from the same unit was used to adjust for multiple hospitalizations from the same hospital. The national estimate of Heller myotomy hospitalizations increased from 728 to 2,255 during 1993-2005, while its mean length of stay decreased from 9.9 to 4.3 days. Of the 1,117 Heller myotomy hospitalizations in the NIS 2003-2005, 10 (0.9%) had the diagnosis of esophageal perforation at discharge. Length of stay was negatively correlated with a hospital's number of Heller myotomy per year (correlation coefficient -0.171, P < 0.001). In multivariate log-linear regressions with a control group, a hospital's number of Heller myotomy per year was negatively associated with length of stay (coefficient -0.215 to -0.119, both P < 0.001) and total charges (coefficient -0.252 to -0.073, both P < 0.10). These findings were robust in alternative statistical models, specifications, and subgroup analyses. On a national level, the introduction of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia was associated with greater use of surgery and shorter length of stay. A larger volume of Heller myotomy in a hospital was associated with better perioperative outcomes\n\nHeller Myotomy for Achalasia: Quality of Life Comparison of Laparoscopic and Open Approaches\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKatilius, Marius\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBackground: Achalasia is a relatively rare disorder with a variety of treatment options. Although laparoscopic Heller myotomy has become the surgical treatment of choice, little data exist on the overall quality of life of patients undergoing this technique versus standard open approaches. Methods: We prospectively evaluated all patients surgically treated for achalasia by a single surgeon. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy consisted of a long (â¥ 6 cm) esophageal cardiomyotomy extending at least 2 cm onto the gastric cardia, with a concomitant Dor fundoplication. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively for symptoms and quality of life using the SF-36, a standardized, generic quality of life instrument. Results: A total of 23 patients were surgically treated: 15 patients had a planned laparoscopic procedure, with 3 conversions; 8 had planned open procedures. Dysphagia resolved in 20 of 21 patients, with 1 patient in the laparoscopic group requiring reoperation due to an inadequate gastric myotomy. Compared with preoperative scores, a statistically significant improvement occurred in the general health domain of the SF-36 (70 to 82, P = 0.04). Compared with that in patients undergoing open surgery, the laparoscopic group had better scores in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain. Conclusions: Laparoscopic Heller myotomy has comparable success to open Heller myotomy, and causes less early detriment to quality of life. This should be the primary treatment in all fit surgical patients with achalasia.

The optimal treatment for end-stage achalasia with esophageal dilation is still controversial. This multicenter and retrospective study aims to evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in patients with a massively dilated esophagus. Eleven patients (mean age, 56 years; 6 men) with massively dilated esophagus (esophageal diameter greater than 10 cm) underwent a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and anterior fundoplication between 2000 and 2009 at three different institutions. Preoperative workup included upper endoscopy, esophagram, and esophageal manometry in all patients. Average follow-up was 31.5 months (range, 3 to 60 months). Two patients (18%) had severe dysphagia, four patients (36%) had mild and occasional dysphagia to solid food, and five patients (45%) were asymptomatic. All patients gained or kept body weight, except for the two patients with severe dysphagia. Of the two patients with severe dysphagia, one underwent esophageal dilatation and the other a laparoscopic esophagectomy. They are both doing well. Heller myotomy relieves dysphagia in the majority of patients even when the esophagus is massively dilated.\n\nMultimedia manuscript. Heller myotomy and intraluminal fundoplication: a NOTES technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerretta, Silvana; Dallemagne, Bernard; Allemann, Pierre; Alleman, Pierre; Marescaux, Jacques\n\n2010-11-01\n\nIt is generally accepted that the most effective treatment of achalasia is a surgical myotomy. Nevertheless, if a myotomy alone is performed, reflux may occur in up to 30% of patients. The aim of this study was to explore a transoral incisionless stepwise approach to both esophageal Heller myotomy and fundoplication. The first step consisted of creating the esophageal myotomy. Under general anesthesia, with the pig supine, endoscopy was performed to assess the location of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). The mucosa on the right posterolateral esophageal wall was cut with the needle-knife 15 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and then dilated with blunt dissection to introduce the scope. A submucosal tunnel was created distally with CO(2) and blunt dissection. Once the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and the clasp fibers were identified, the muscular layer was cut. The scope was withdrawn into the lumen and the mucosal flap was sealed with endoscopic clips. The adequacy of the myotomy was evaluated using pre- and postoperative manometry and by comparing the EGJ distensibility before, during, and after the division of the esophageal muscular fibers using the functional lumen imaging probe, EndoFLIPÂ®. The second step, consisted of building a transoral incisionless fundoplication 4 weeks postoperatively using the EsophyXâ¢. Both Heller myotomy and endoscopic fundoplication were accomplished successfully with no injury to the esophageal mucosa. Postoperative manometry demonstrated a 50% loss in mean LES pressure (mean preoperative LES pressure = 22.2 mmHg; mean postoperative LES pressure = 10 mmHg, P < 0.005). The EndoFLIPÂ® showed a preoperative minimal diameter of 6 mm with a cross-sectional area of 28 mm(2). Postoperatively, the junction was more compliant (minimal diameter = 15 mm; cross-sectional area = 177 mm(2)), with the main improvement in distensibility occurring when the clasps fibers were removed.

The incorporation of robotic technology can improve many limitations of laparoscopic surgery, through, for example, the availability of three-dimensional vision, increasing the degrees of movement, avoiding the fulcrum effect and optimizing ergonomics. The aim of this study was to compare robotic-assisted laparoscopic Heller myotomy (RAHM) with laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) in terms of efficacy and safety. Thirty-one patients with diagnosis of achalasia confirmed by esophagogram and manometry were included. Dysphagia and weight loss were the main complaints in both groups. 18 patients were treated with LHM and 13 patients with RAHM. There was no difference in mean operative time (76Â Â±Â 13 vs. 79Â Â±Â 20Â min; PÂ =Â 0.73). Intraoperative complications were less frequent in the robotic-assisted procedures (5.5% vs. 0%); however, this was a non-significant difference. 94.5-100% of patients had relief of their symptoms. We conclude that RAHM is a safe and effective procedure. The operative time is no longer than in LHM, but it is necessary to evaluate the technique in randomized clinical trials to determine its advantages in terms of intraoperative complications.\n\nRandomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Giaccone, Claudio; Farinella, Eleonora; Campaci, Roberto; Morino, Mario\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo compare in a prospective, randomized trial the long-term results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus floppy-Nissen for achalasia. Anterior fundoplication is usually performed after Heller myotomy to control GER; however, the incidence of postoperative GER ranges between 10% and 30%. Total fundoplication may aid in reducing GER rates. From December 1993 to September 2002, 153 patients with achalasia underwent Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus antireflux fundoplication. Of these, 9 were excluded from the study. The remaining 144 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus anterior fundoplication (Dor procedure) or Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus total fundoplication (floppy-Nissen procedure). The primary end point was incidence of clinical and instrumental GER after a minimum of 60 months follow-up. The secondary end point was recurrence of dysphagia. Follow-up clinical assessments were performed at 1, 3, 12, and 60 months using a modified DeMeester Symptom Scoring System (MDSS). Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring were performed at 3, 12, and 60 months postoperative. Of the 144 patients originally included in the study, 138 were available for long-term analysis: 71 (51%) underwent antireflux fundoplication plus a Dor procedure (H + D group) and 67 (49%) antireflux fundoplication plus a Nissen procedure (H + N group). No mortality was observed. The mean follow-up period was 125 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical (5.6% vs. 0%) or instrumental GER (2.8% vs. 0%) were found between the 2 groups; however, a statistically significant difference in dysphagia rates was noted (2.8% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Although both techniques achieved long-term GER control, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication. This evidence supports the use of Dor fundoplication as the\n\nEfficacy of pneumodilation in achalasia after failed Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaleh, C M G; Ponds, F A M; Schijven, M P; Smout, A J P M; Bredenoord, A J\n\n2016-11-01\n\nHeller myotomy is an effective treatment for the majority of achalasia patients. However, a small proportion of patients suffer from persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgery and they are usually subsequently treated with pneumodilation (PD). Data on the efficacy of PD as secondary treatment for achalasia are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of PD as treatment for achalasia patients suffering from persistent or recurrent symptoms after Heller myotomy. Patients with recurrent or persistent symptoms (Eckardt score >3) after Heller myotomy were selected. Patients were treated with PD, using a graded distension protocol with balloon sizes ranging from 30 to 40 mm. After each dilation symptoms were assessed to evaluate whether a subsequent dilation with a larger balloon size was required. Patients with recurrent or persistent symptoms (Eckardt score >3) after treatment with a 40-mm balloon were identified as failures. Twenty-four patients were included in total; 15 patients with achalasia type I, seven with achalasia type II and two with achalasia type III. Median relapse time was 2.5 years after Heller myotomy (IQR: 9 years and 3 months). Three patients were not suitable for PD; one patient was morbidly obese and not fit for any form of sedation and two had a siphon-shaped esophagus leaving 21 patients to treat. Eight patients were successfully treated with a single 30-mm balloon dilation (median follow-up time: 6.5 years; IQR: 7.5 years). Four patients required dilations with 30- and 35-mm balloons (median follow-up time: 11 years; IQR: 3 years). Nine patients failed on the 35-mm balloon dilation and underwent a subsequent dilation with a 40-mm balloon, and all failed on this balloon as well. Thus, PD was successful in 12 of the 21 treatable patients, resulting in a success rate of 57% for treatable patients or 50% for all patients. Baseline Eckardt scores were also higher in those that failed (median: 8; IQR: 2) than those that\n\nHeller myotomy with esophageal diverticulectomy: an operation in need of improvement.\n\nPubMed\n\nBowman, Ty A; Sadowitz, Benjamin D; Ross, Sharona B; Boland, Andrew; Luberice, Kenneth; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication and diverticulectomy for patients with achalasia and esophageal diverticula. 634 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy and anterior fundoplication from 1992 to 2015 are prospectively followed up; patients were stratified for those undergoing concomitant diverticulectomy. Patients graded symptom frequency and severity before and after myotomy, using a Likert scale (0Â =Â never/not bothersome to 10Â =Â always/very bothersome). Median data are presented (meanÂ Â±Â SD). Forty-four patients, age 70Â years (65Â Â±Â 14.2), underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy, anterior fundoplication, and diverticulectomy. Operative time was 182Â min (183Â Â±Â 54.6). Fifty percentage of patients had a postoperative complication: Most notable were leaks at the diverticulectomy site (nÂ =Â 8) and pulmonary complications (nÂ =Â 11; 10 effusion, 1 empyema). Length of stay (LOS) was 3Â days (5Â Â±Â 8.3). All leaks occurred after discharge and resolved without sequelae using transthoracic catheter drainage and parenteral nutrition; two patients received endoscopic esophageal stents. Median follow-up is 39Â months. Symptoms amelioration was significant postoperatively, including severity of dysphagia [6 (6Â Â±Â 3.9) to 2(4Â Â±Â 3.6)]. Seventy-six percentage of patients rated their symptoms at last follow-up as satisfying/very satisfying. Seventy-seven percentage of patients had symptoms once per week or less. Eighty-one percentage would have the operation again knowing what they know now. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy, anterior fundoplication, and diverticulectomy well palliate the symptoms of achalasia with accompanying esophageal diverticulum. The operations are generally longer than those without diverticulectomy and are accompanied by a relatively longer LOS. Complications are relatively frequent and severe (e.g., leaks and pneumonia).

Esophageal achalasia is an unusual swallowing disorder, characterized by high pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) on swallowing, failure relaxation of the LES and the absence of peristalsis in esophageal. In this cross sectional study, clinical symptom and esophageal manometry before and 2 months after treating with Heller myotomy in 20 patients with achalasia who were referred to Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, in 2013 were evaluated. Patients' demographic, clinical features and response to treatment were analyzed using SPSS software (version 20, Chicago, IL, USA). All the diagnostic criteria measured after the treatment were significantly different (P<0.05) before and after the therapy. The average decline in the length of the esophagus was 1.8 cm and dysphasia score was 7.25 units. Also an average decline in LES Resting Pressure, LES Residual Pressure, PIP, and IRP were 23.2 mmHg, 14.3 mmHg, 3.4 mmHg and 17.8 mmHg, respectively. Results of this study showed that the Heller myotomy is highly effective in relieving dysphasia in patients with achalasia. Also, type II achalasia is the most common subtype of achalasia with a better response to Heller myotomy compared to the other types.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Anterior Fundoplication Improves Frequency and Severity of Symptoms of Achalasia, Regardless of Preoperative Severity Determined by Esophagography.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander; Downs, Darrell; Luberice, Kenneth; Rodriguez, Christian; Swaid, Forat; Patel, Krishen; Toomey, Paul; Ross, Sharona\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine whether postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication could be predicted by preoperative findings on esophagography. Preoperative barium esophagograms of 135 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication were reviewed. The number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, and angulation of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) were determined; correlations between these determined parameters and symptoms were assessed using linear regression analysis. The number of esophageal curves correlated with the preoperative frequency of dysphagia, vomiting, chest pain, regurgitation, and heartburn. The width of the esophagus negatively correlated with the preoperative frequency of regurgitation. The angulation of the GEJ did not correlate with preoperative symptoms. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication significantly reduced the frequency and severity of all symptoms, regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or angulation of the GEJ. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication provides dramatic palliation for achalasia. More esophageal curves on preoperative esophagography correlate well with the frequency of a broad range of preoperative symptoms, including the frequency of dysphagia and regurgitation. Patients experience dramatically improved frequency and severity of symptoms after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or the angulation of the GEJ. Findings on barium esophagogram, in evaluating achalasia, should not deter the application of laparosocopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication.\n\nComputer-enhanced robotic telesurgery minimizes esophageal perforation during Heller myotomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelvin, W Scott; Dundon, John M; Talamini, Mark; Horgan, Santiago\n\n2005-10-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy has emerged as the treatment of choice for achalasia. However, intraoperative esophageal perforation remains a significant complication. Computer-enhanced operative techniques have the potential to improve outcomes for certain operative procedures. Robotic, computer-enhanced laparoscopic telemanipulators using 3-dimensional magnified imaging and motion scaling are designed uniquely to facilitate certain operations requiring fine-tissue manipulation. We hypothesized that computer-enhanced robotic Heller myotomy would reduce intraoperative complications compared with laparoscopic techniques. All patients undergoing an operation for achalasia at 3 institutions with a robotic surgery system (DaVinci; Intuitive Surgical Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif) were followed-up prospectively. Demographics, perioperative course, complications, and hospital stay were recorded. Follow-up evaluation was obtained via a standardized symptom survey, office visits, and medical records. Data were compared with preoperative symptoms using a Mann-Whitney U test, and operating times were compared using the ANOVA test. Between August 2000 and August 2004 there were 104 patients who underwent a robotic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplicaton. There were 53 women and 51 men. All patients were symptomatic. The operative time was 140.55 minutes overall, but improved from 162.63 minutes to 113.50 minutes from 2000-2002 to 2003-2004 (P = .0001). There were no esophageal perforations. There were 8 minor complications and 1 patient required conversion to an open operation. Sixty-six (62.3%) patients were discharged on the first postoperative day and the average hospital stay was 1.5 days. A symptom survey was completed in 79 of 104 patients (76%) at follow-up evaluation. Symptoms improved in all patients with an average follow-up symptom score of 0.48 compared with 5.0 before the operation (P = .0001). Forty-three of the 79 patients from whom follow-up data were collected\n\n100 consecutive minimally invasive Heller myotomies: lessons learned.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharp, Kenneth W; Khaitan, Leena; Scholz, Stefan; Holzman, Michael D; Richards, William O\n\n2002-05-01\n\nTo evaluate the authors' first 100 patients treated for achalasia by a minimally invasive approach. Between November 1992 and February 2001, the authors performed 95 laparoscopic and 5 thoracoscopic Heller myotomies in 100 patients (age 49.5 +/- 1.5 years) with manometrically confirmed achalasia. Before presentation, 51 patients had previous dilation, 23 had been treated with botulinum toxin (Botox), and 4 had undergone prior myotomy. Laparoscopic myotomy was performed by incising the distal 4 to 6 cm of esophageal musculature and extended 1 to 2 cm onto the cardia under endoscopic guidance. Fifteen patients underwent antireflux procedures. There were eight intraoperative perforations and only four conversions to open surgery. Follow-up is 10.8 +/- 1 months; 75% of the patients have been followed up for at least 14 months. Outcomes assessed by patient questionnaires revealed satisfactory relief of dysphagia in 93 patients and \"poor\" relief in 7 patients. Postoperative heartburn symptoms were reported as \"moderate to severe\" in 14 patients and \"none or mild\" in 86 patients. Fourteen patients required postoperative procedures for continued symptoms of dysphagia after myotomy. Esophageal manometry studies revealed a decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) from 37 +/- 1 mm Hg to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg. Patients with a decrease in LESP of more than 18 mm Hg and whose absolute postoperative LESP was 18 or less were more likely to have relief of dysphagia after surgery. Thirty-one patients who underwent Heller alone were studied with a 24-hour esophageal pH probe and had a median Johnson-DeMeester score of 10 (normal <22.0). Mean esophageal acid exposure time was 3 +/- 0.6% (normal 4.2%). Symptoms did not correlate with esophageal acid exposure. The results after minimally invasive treatment for achalasia are equivalent to historical outcomes with open techniques. Satisfactory outcomes occurred in 93% of patients. Patients whose postoperative LESP was less than 18\n\nHow robotic-assisted surgery can decrease the risk of mucosal tear during Heller myotomy procedure?\n\nPubMed\n\nBallouhey, Quentin; Dib, Nabil; Binet, AurÃ©lien; Carcauzon-Couvrat, VÃ©ronique; Clermidi, Pauline; Longis, Bernard; Lardy, Hubert; Languepin, Jane; Cros, JÃ©rÃ´me; Fourcade, Laurent\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe report the first description of robotic-assisted Heller myotomy in children. The purpose of this study was to improve the safety of Heller myotomy by demonstrating, in two adolescent patients, the contribution of the robot to the different steps of this procedure. Due to the robot's freedom of movement and three-dimensional vision, there was an improvement in the accuracy, a gain in the safety regarding different key-points, decreasing the risk of mucosal perforation associated with this procedure.\n\nThe early efficacy of Heller myotomy in the treatment of Iranian patients with achalasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdi, Saeed; Forotan, Mojgan; Nikzamir, Abdolrahim; Zomorody, Saeedeh; Jahani-Sherafat, Somayeh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia in a referral center in Tehran, and investigate the clinical characteristics, manometric results and treatment responses among three achalasia subtypes in Iranian patients. Background: Esophageal achalasia is an unusual swallowing disorder, characterized by high pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) on swallowing, failure relaxation of the LES and the absence of peristalsis in esophageal. Patients and methods: In this cross sectional study, clinical symptom and esophageal manometry before and 2 months after treating with Heller myotomy in 20 patients with achalasia who were referred to Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, in 2013 were evaluated. Patientsâ demographic, clinical features and response to treatment were analyzed using SPSS software (version 20, Chicago, IL, USA). Results: All the diagnostic criteria measured after the treatment were significantly different (P<0.05) before and after the therapy. The average de"
