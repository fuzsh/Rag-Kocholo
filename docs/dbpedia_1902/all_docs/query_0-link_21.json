        "text": "Single-Site Nissen Fundoplication Versus Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSharp, Nicole E.; Vassaur, John\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the emergence of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of SILS Nissen fundoplication and compare its outcomes with traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication between January 2009 and September 2010. Results: There were 15 SILS and 18 traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures performed. The mean operative time was 129 and 182 minutes in the traditional laparoscopic and single-incision groups, respectively (P = .019). There were no conversions in the traditional laparoscopic group, whereas 6 of the 15 patients in the SILS group required conversion by insertion of 2 to 4 additional ports (P = .0004). At short-term follow-up, recurrence rates were similar between both groups. To date, there have been no reoperations. Conclusions: SILS Nissen fundoplication is both safe and feasible. Short-term outcomes are comparable with standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Challenges related to the single-incision Nissen fundoplication include overcoming the lengthy learning curve and decreasing the need for additional trocars. PMID:25392613\n\nSeventeen-year Outcome of a Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Laparoscopic and Conventional Nissen Fundoplication: A Plea for Patient Counseling and Clarification.\n\nPubMed\n\nOor, Jelmer E; Roks, David J; Broeders, Joris A; Hazebroek, Eric J; Gooszen, Hein G\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo analyze long-term outcome of a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and conventional Nissen fundoplication (CNF) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). LNF has replaced CNF, based on positive short and mid-term outcome. Studies with a follow-up of over 15 years are scarce, but are desperately needed for patient counselling. Between 1997 and 1999, 177 patients with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory GERD were randomized to CNF or LNF. Data regarding the presence of reflux symptoms, dysphagia, general health, PPI use, and need for surgical reintervention at 17 years are reported. A total of 111 patients (60 LNF, 51 CNF) were included. Seventeen years after LNF and CNF, 90% and 95% of the patients reported symptom relief, with no differences in GERD symptoms or dysphagia. Forty-three and 49% of the patients used PPIs (NS). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in general health (77% vs 71%; NS) and quality of life (75.3 vs 74.7; NS). Surgical reinterventions were more frequent after CNF (18% vs 45%; P = 0.002), mainly due to incisional hernia corrections (3% vs 14%; P = 0.047). The effects of LNF and CNF on symptomatic outcome and general state of health remain for up to 17 years after surgery, with no differences between the 2 procedures. CNF carries a higher risk of surgical reintervention, mainly due to incisional hernia corrections. Patients should be informed that 17 years after Nissen fundoplication, 60% of the patients are off PPIs, and 16% require reoperation for recurrent GERD and/or dysphagia.\n\nLaparoscopic vs. open Nissen's fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in children: A meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Peng; Tian, Jing; Jing, Li; Wang, Quan; Tian, Jinhui; Lun, Li\n\n2016-10-01\n\nAvailable evidence showed inconsistent results between laparoscopic Nissen's fundoplication (LNF) and open Nissen's fundoplication (ONF) for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), so this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety between LNF and ONF. Systematic, comprehensive literature searches were conducted to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared LNF and ONF for GERD. Two reviewers independently selected studies, abstracted data and assessed the methodological quality and evidence level. Data was analyzed by Review Manager Version 5.0. Risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) was used for continuous scales. Heterogeneity was estimated with the I 2 statistic, fixed-effect model was used if I 2 <50%, and otherwise random-effects model was used. Three RCTs (171 children) were included. There was not a statistical difference in mortality (RR 1.12, 95%CI 0.50 2.48), or postoperative complications (RR 0.87, 95%CI 0.61 1.25), readmission (RR 1.53, 95%CI 0.67 3.51), or hospital stay (MD 0.85, 95%CI -0.06 1.75) between LNF and ONF. But LNF was associated with more incidence of recurrence (RR 3.32, 95%CI 1.40 7.84), longer surgery duration (MD 76.33, 95%CI 69.37 83.28), but fewer retching (RR 0.11, 95%CI 0.02 0.58) than ONF. LNF might be as effective and safe as ONF in the short and long term, but both were associated with high risk of recurrence and mortality, especially for those children with neurological impairment, before the age of 18 months and female gender. This required a comprehensive evaluation of children before surgery. Copyright Â© 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thirteen patients with neurological impairment, who received laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) owing to refractory pathological GERD, were enrolled in this study. 24h pH/MII was conducted in all patients before and one year after LNF. Each parameter of the pH/MII was evaluated and compared each other. Both the mean pH index and bolus exposure index after LNF were significantly lower than those before LNF. The mean numbers of total and nonacid reflux episodes after LNF were significantly lower than those before LNF. The mean numbers of total, acid and nonacid proximal reflux episodes after LNF were significantly lower than those before LNF. The mean baseline impedance values from Z3 to Z6 after LNF were significantly higher than those before LNF. The present study provides new insights into the effects of LNF in pediatric patients, which prevents mainly acid reflux episodes from rising to the proximal esophagus, and is expected to improve the mucosal integrity up to the middle esophagus.

Laparoscopic anterior 180Â° fundoplication (180Â° LAF) is reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications while obtaining similar control of reflux. The present meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the value of the 2 techniques. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Springerlink, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Platform databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and 180Â° LAF. Data regarding the benefits and adverse results of 2 techniques were extracted and compared using a meta-analysis. Results: Six eligible RCTs comparing LNF (nâ=â266) and 180Â° LAF (nâ=â265) were identified. There were no significant differences between LNF and 180Â° LAF with regard to operating time, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo surgery again, quality of life, postoperative heartburn, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, postoperative DeMeester scores, postoperative lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, postoperative gas-bloating, unable to belch, diarrhea, or overall reoperation. LNF was associated with a higher prevalence of postoperative dysphagia compared with 180Â° LAF, while 180Â° LAF was followed by more reoperation for recurrent reflux symptoms. Conclusion: LNF and 180Â° LAF are equally effective in controlling reflux symptoms and obtain a comparable prevalence of patient satisfaction. 180Â° LAF can reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia while this is offset by a higher risk of reoperation for recurrent symptoms. The risk of recurrent symptoms should need to be balanced against the risk of dysphagia when surgeons choose surgical procedures for each individual with GERD.

From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nLong-term results of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication due to gastroesophageal reflux disease. A ten year follow-up in a low volume center.\n\nPubMed\n\nKornmo, T S; Ruud, T E\n\n2008-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic 360 degrees nissen fundoplication has been our routine surgical procedure since 1995, in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We have reviewed our results of patients treated with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) during 1995-1998. 170 patients have undergone LNF in our hospital since 1995. during the period of 1995-1998, 33 patients were treated. all patients were asked to return a structured follow-up questionnaire, using a Visick grading scale, after an average of 69 months (2003) and 117 months (2007). 29 questionnaires (90%) were answered in 2003, and 31 questionnaires (97%) were answered in 2007. one patient died at home before the first questionnaire in 2003, and is therefore not included. We present our results on LNF after an observation time of 117 months (range 99-144 months). patient satisfaction after LNF is rated as very good or good (Visick 1-2) in 93% in 2003 and 97% in 2007. 97% of the patients would recommend the same treatment to other patients with similar symptoms at ten year follow up. One patient has undergone resurgery during follow up. Daily gas bloat and flatulence is reported in 52% in 2003 and 39% in 2007, and is the most common reason for reduced satisfaction. Five patients report of reflux symptoms, one patient daily and four patients sometimes, where the first patient still uses proton pump inhibitor (PPI) daily and three patients use PPI occasionally. patient satisfaction after LNF treatment for gerd is high at long-term (10 years) follow-up. Bloating and flatulence persistently occurred to a great extent and the need for preoperative information regarding these symptoms is important.\n\nFundoplication After Heller Myotomy: A Retrospective Comparison Between Nissen and Dor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: A retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia.

PMID:25610181\n\nQuality of life and antireflux medication use following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Zervos, E; Gonzalez, R; Albrink, M; Rosemurgy, A\n\n1998-06-01\n\nWith the advent of minimally invasive techniques, the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease has received renewed interest. The efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in eliminating reflux has been documented. This study was undertaken to determine changes in quality of life and cost of antireflux medications after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between 1992 and 1997 completed questionnaires assessing changes in pre- and postoperative cost and number of antireflux medications, reflux symptoms, and quality of life. The average number of antireflux medications was significantly reduced (1.8 versus 0.3, P < 0.0001) as was the average monthly cost ($170 versus $30, P < 0.0001). Patients reported significant (P < 0.05) symptomatic improvement in postprandial heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, postprandial nausea, postprandial vomiting, dysphagia, and gas/bloating. Patients in this series noted fewer symptoms and used fewer antireflux medications at less cost after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Symptoms commonly thought of as complications of fundoplication (vomiting, dysphagia, gas/bloating) were less common after fundoplication. This report documents the efficacy of laparoscopic fundoplication in improving quality of life and reducing use and cost of antireflux medications.\n\nA Hill Gastropexy Combined with Nissen Fundoplication Appears Equivalent to a Collis-Nissen in the Management of Short Esophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nBellevue, Oliver C; Louie, Brian E; Jutric, Zeljka; Farivar, Alexander S; Aye, Ralph W\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA Collis gastroplasty combined with a Nissen fundoplication is commonly used when a shortened esophagus is encountered. An alternative combines intra-abdominal fixation of the gastroesophageal junction via a Hill gastropexy with a Nissen fundoplication to maintain length and avoid juxtaposing acid-secreting tissue against the diseased esophagus. A retrospective case-controlled analysis of 106 consecutive patients with short esophagus undergoing Hill-Nissen (HN) or Collis-Nissen (CN) was compared to a cohort of 105 matched patients without short esophagus undergoing primary Nissen fundoplication (NF). At a median follow-up of 27Â months, all groups (HN:CN:NF) improved significantly over preoperative baseline with no differences in overall complications (18 vs 16 vs 19%, pÂ =Â 0.78), DeMeester score (11.1 vs 19.1 vs 14.2, pÂ =Â 0.49), postoperative PPI use (16 vs 22 vs 15%, pÂ =Â 0.24), anatomic recurrences (11.7 vs 5.5 vs 7%, pÂ =Â 0.43), or quality of life (6.8 vs 6.7 vs 6.4, pÂ =Â 0.3). The management of shortened esophagus with Hill-Nissen is safe and as effective as Collis gastroplasty with Nissen fundoplication. Both options appear to produce similar outcomes to patients requiring only a Nissen fundoplication suggesting a shortened esophagus does not beget an inferior outcome.\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen (total) versus anterior 180Â° fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease: A meta-analysis and systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nDu, Xing; Wu, Ji-Min; Hu, Zhi-Wei; Wang, Feng; Wang, Zhong-Gao; Zhang, Chao; Yan, Chao; Chen, Mei-Ping\n\n2017-09-01\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) has been the gold standard for the surgical management of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Few cases have been described secondary to iatrogenic injury from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. We describe a case in which this surgery resulted in chyloascites that was successfully treated by lymphatic glue embolization. Methods: A 37-year-old male presented with signs and symptoms consistent with chronic reflux disease. He underwent an uneventful laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Two weeks postoperatively, he was admitted for dehydration. During his admission, he began to develop a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and abdominal distention. Imaging and fluid analysis from thoracocentesis and paracentesis were consistent with chyle leakage. Despite nonoperative measures, the patient's presentation persisted. Results: Thoracic duct ligation was performed without success. Bipedal lymphangiography identified an extensive leak revealing a severely lacerated thoracic duct spilling contrast freely into the abdomen and no contrast entering the thoracic duct in the chest. The site of injury was successfully sealed off with percutaneous glue embolization through lymph channels. Conclusion: Chyloascites is a rare complication of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. When not successful with conservative measures, lymphatic glue embolization can provide effective treatment. PMID:23477184\n\nA meta-analysis of long follow-up outcomes of laparoscopic Nissen (total) versus Toupet (270Â°) fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease based on randomized controlled trials in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nDu, Xing; Hu, Zhiwei; Yan, Chao; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Zhonggao; Wu, Jimin\n\n2016-08-02\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) is the most common surgical procedure for the surgical management of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (LTF) has been reported to have a lower prevalence of postoperative complications yet still obtain a similar level of reflux control. We conducted a meta-analysis to confirm the value of LNF and LTF. PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Springerlink were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and LTF. Data regarding the benefits and adverse results of two techniques were extracted and compared using a meta-analysis. Eight eligible RCTs comparing LNF (nâ=â625) and LTF (nâ=â567) were identified. There were no significant differences between LNF and LTF with regard to hospitalization duration, perioperative complications, patient satisfaction, postoperative heartburn, regurgitation, postoperative DeMeester scores, or esophagites. A shorter operative time and higher postoperative lower esophageal sphincter pressure were associated with LNF. Prevalence of postoperative dysphagia, gas-bloating, inability to belch, dilatation for dysphagia and reoperation were higher after LNF, but subgroup analyses showed that differences with respect to dysphagia between LNF and LTF disappeared over time. Subgroup analyses did not support \"tailored therapy\" according to preoperative esophageal motility. LNF and LTF have equivalently good control of GERD and result in a similar prevalence of patient satisfaction. Based on current evidence, it is not rational or advisable to abandon LNF when choosing a surgical procedure for GERD.\n\nConventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication: a comparison of postoperative acid reflux parameters.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrazzoni, Marzio; Conigliaro, Rita; Colli, Giovanni; Melotti, Gianluigi\n\n2012-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) is a technically demanding surgical procedure designed to cure gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It represents an alternative to life-long medical therapy and the only recommended treatment modality to overcome refractoriness to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The recent development of robotic systems prompted evaluation of their use in antireflux surgery. Between 1997 and 2000, in a PPI-responsive series we found postoperative normalization of esophageal acid exposure time (EAET) in most but not all cases. Between 2007 and 2009, in a PPI-refractory series we found postoperative normalization of EAET in all cases. We decided to analyze retrospectively our prospectively collected data to evaluate whether differences other than the conventional or robot-assisted technique could justify postoperative differences in acid reflux parameters. Baseline demographic, endoscopic, and manometric parameters were compared between the two series of patients, as well as postoperative manometric and acid reflux parameters. There were no significant differences in the baseline demographic, endoscopic, and manometric characteristics between the two groups of patients. The median lower esophageal sphincter tone increased significantly, and the median EAET decreased significantly after conventional as well as after robot-assisted LNF. The median postoperative EAET was significantly lower in the robot-assisted (0.2%) than in the conventional LNF group (1%; PÂ =Â 0.001). Abnormal EAET values were found in 6 of 44 (14%) and in 0 of 44 cases after conventional and robot-assisted LNF, respectively (PÂ =Â 0.026). Robot-assisted LNF provided a significant gain in postoperative acid reflux parameters compared with the conventional technique. In a challenging clinical setting, such as PPI-refractoriness, in which the efficacy of endoscopic or pharmacological treatment modalities is only moderate, even a small therapeutic gain can be clinically\n\nEffectiveness of Nissen fundoplication versus anterior and posterior partial fundoplications for treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a systematic review protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarshall-Webb, Matthew; Peters, Micah D J; Bright, Tim; Watson, David I\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe objective of this review is to determine the relative effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication compared to anterior and posterior partial fundoplication in controlling the symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and reducing their side effect profile in adults.The specific questions posed by this review are: what is the effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication in comparison to anterior partial fundoplication (90 degree, 120 degree and 180 degree) and posterior 270 degree fundoplication in terms of symptom control of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and what are the side effects of these surgical interventions?\n\nPredicting patient dissatisfaction following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication: an analysis of symptoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeenen, Edwin; Fogarty, Paul; Roberts, Ross H\n\n2013-05-01\n\nNissen fundoplication is a well-established treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a high success rate and a long-lasting effect. However, the literature reports that a persistent, small group of patients is not fully satisfied with the outcome. Identifying this patient group preoperatively would prevent disappointment for both patients and surgeon. This has proven difficult since dissatisfaction was related to nondisease-related factors instead of typical symptoms of GERD or the objective findings of investigations. We studied our series of patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to identify predictors of patient dissatisfaction and the impact of surgery on individual symptoms. All consecutive private patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication were asked to complete a preoperative and postoperative questionnaire concerning symptoms, medication use, and satisfaction. Demographics, investigations, complications, and reinterventions were documented. A standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed. Over an 11-year period 222 patients underwent surgery for GERD. The postoperative response rate to the questionnaire was 77.5 %, with dissatisfaction reported by 12.8 % of the patients. Of these dissatisfied patients, only 13.6 % had proven disease recurrence. Both satisfied and dissatisfied patients presented with an inconsistent pattern of symptoms. None of the preoperative symptoms and investigations or the patient's age and gender was predictive of postoperative dissatisfaction. Only postoperative heartburn, regurgitation, and bloating significantly correlated with patient dissatisfaction. Nissen fundoplication has a very high satisfaction rate overall. A small percentage of patients are not fully satisfied and dissatisfaction is associated with reported persistent symptoms and side effects of surgery rather than gender or preoperative symptom pattern, severity of esophagitis, or total 24 h esophageal acid exposure.\n\nEfficacy of Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication vs Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication or Proton Pump Inhibitors in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRichter, Joel E; Kumar, Ambuj; Lipka, Seth; Miladinovic, Branko; Velanovich, Vic\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe effects of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) have been compared with those of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or a sham procedure in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but there has been no direct comparison of TIF vs LNF. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the relative efficacies of TIF vs LNF in patients with GERD. We searched publication databases and conference abstracts through May 10, 2017 for randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of TIF or LNF with that of a sham procedure or PPIs in patients with GERD. We performed a network meta-analysis using Bayesian methods under random-effects multiple treatment comparisons. We assessed ranking probability by surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Our search identified 7 trials comprising 1128 patients. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking indicated TIF had highest probability of increasing patients' health-related quality of life (0.96), followed by LNF (0.66), a sham procedure (0.35), and PPIs (0.042). LNF had the highest probability of increasing percent time at pH <4 (0.99), followed by PPIs (0.64), TIF (0.32), and the sham procedure (0.05). LNF also had the highest probability of increasing LES pressure (0.78), followed by TIF (0.72) and PPIs (0.01). Patients who underwent the sham procedure had the highest probability for persistent esophagitis (0.74), followed by those receiving TIF (0.69), LNF (0.38), and PPIs (0.19). Meta-regression showed a shorter follow-up time as a significant confounder for the outcome of health-related quality of life in studies of TIF. In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of trials of patients with GERD, we found LNF to have the greatest ability to improve physiologic parameters of GERD, including increased LES pressure and decreased percent time pH <4. Although TIF produced the largest increase in\n\nRandomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Giaccone, Claudio; Farinella, Eleonora; Campaci, Roberto; Morino, Mario\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo compare in a prospective, randomized trial the long-term results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus floppy-Nissen for achalasia. Anterior fundoplication is usually performed after Heller myotomy to control GER; however, the incidence of postoperative GER ranges between 10% and 30%. Total fundoplication may aid in reducing GER rates. From December 1993 to September 2002, 153 patients with achalasia underwent Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus antireflux fundoplication. Of these, 9 were excluded from the study. The remaining 144 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus anterior fundoplication (Dor procedure) or Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus total fundoplication (floppy-Nissen procedure). The primary end point was incidence of clinical and instrumental GER after a minimum of 60 months follow-up. The secondary end point was recurrence of dysphagia. Follow-up clinical assessments were performed at 1, 3, 12, and 60 months using a modified DeMeester Symptom Scoring System (MDSS). Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring were performed at 3, 12, and 60 months postoperative. Of the 144 patients originally included in the study, 138 were available for long-term analysis: 71 (51%) underwent antireflux fundoplication plus a Dor procedure (H + D group) and 67 (49%) antireflux fundoplication plus a Nissen procedure (H + N group). No mortality was observed. The mean follow-up period was 125 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical (5.6% vs. 0%) or instrumental GER (2.8% vs. 0%) were found between the 2 groups; however, a statistically significant difference in dysphagia rates was noted (2.8% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Although both techniques achieved long-term GER control, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication. This evidence supports the use of Dor fundoplication as the\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication offers high patient satisfaction with relief of extraesophageal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nRakita, Steven; Villadolid, Desiree; Thomas, Ashley; Bloomston, Mark; Albrink, Michael; Goldin, Steven; Rosemurgy, Alexander\n\n2006-03-01\n\nNissen fundoplication is applied for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), usually because of symptoms of esophageal injury. When presenting symptoms are extraesophageal, there is less enthusiasm for operative control of reflux because of concerns of etiology and efficacy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in palliating extraesophageal symptoms of GERD. Patients were asked to score their symptoms before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication on a Likert scale (0 = never/none to 5 = always/every time I eat). A total of 322 patients with extraesophageal symptoms (asthma, cough, gas/bloat, chest pain, and odynophagia) of 4 to 5 were identified and analyzed. After fundoplication, all extraesophageal symptom scores improved (P < 0.0001 for all, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). Likewise, postoperative symptoms were noted to be greatly improved or resolved in 67 per cent to 82 per cent of patients for each symptom. Furthermore, after fundoplication, patients were less likely to modify their dietary (82% vs 49%) or sleeping habits (70% vs 28%) to avoid initiating/ exacerbating symptoms. Although extraesophageal symptoms are conventionally thought to be inadequately palliated by surgery, this study documents excellent relief of extraesophageal symptoms after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, denotes high patient satisfaction, and encourages application of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Ling; Wong, Carol Wing Yan; Chung, Patrick Ho Yu; Wong, Kenneth Kak Yuen; Tam, Paul Kwong Hang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nData on laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants remain limited. We describe our experience with this operation in children and in particular, infants younger than 12 months old. Medical records of all paediatric patients who had laparoscopic fundoplication done for GERD from 1998 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on age: group I: 0-12 months, and group II >12 months. Data on indications, patient's demographics, operative time, blood loss, conversions, complications, recurrences and duration of hospitalization were studied. A total of 86 patients were reviewed (group I, n = 21; group II, n = 65). While the mean age and body weight for group I were 8 Â± 2.99 months and 6 Â± 1.96 kg, the values for group II were 98 Â± 65 months and 18 Â± 9.6 kg, respectively. All patients had concurrent laparoscopic gastrostomy for feeding difficulties. The mean operative time was shorter in group I (157 Â± 55 vs 169 Â± 52 min, p = 0.66). Both groups had minimal blood loss only. The surgical outcomes in both groups were comparable in terms of recurrence (0 vs 3 %, p = 0.105) and complications (9.5 vs 6 %, p = 0.275). The median follow-up duration for group I and group II was 23 and 40 months, respectively. Sixteen (76 %) patients in group I and 45 (67 %) patients in group II did not develop pneumonia post fundoplication. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be safely performed in infants with outcomes comparable to older patients and a shorter operative duration. Low recurrence rate (up to 3 %) is shown by our long term follow-up data. We recommend laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to be considered in managing infants with GERD.\n\nAsymptomatic Partial Splenic Infarction In Laparoscopic Floppy Nissen Fundoplication And Brief Literature Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOdabasi, Mehmet; Abuoglu, Haci Hasan; Arslan, Cem; Gunay, Emre; Yildiz, Mehmet Kamil; Eris, Cengiz; Ozkan, Erkan; Aktekin, Ali; Muftuoglu, Tolga\n\n2014-01-01\n\nShort gastric vessels are divided during the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication resulting in splenic infarct in some cases. We report a case of laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication with splenic infarct that was recognized during the procedure and provide a brief literature review. The patient underwent a laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication. We observed a partial infarction of the spleen. She reported no pain. A follow-up computed tomography scan showed an infarct, and a 3-month abdominal ultrasound showed complete resolution. Peripheral splenic arterial branches have very little collateral circulation. When these vessels are occluded or injured, an area of infarction will occur immediately. Management strategies included a trial of conservative management and splenectomy for persistent symptoms or complications resulting from splenic infarct. In conclusion, we believe that the real incidence is probably much higher because many cases of SI may have gone undiagnosed during or following an operation, because some patients are asymptomatic. We propose to check spleen carefully for the possibility of splenic infarct.

We sought to compare our initial experience with magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). A retrospective case-control study was performed of consecutive patients undergoing either procedure who had chronic gastrointestinal esophageal disease (GERD) and a hiatal hernia of less than 3 cm. Sixty-six patients underwent operations (34 MSA and 32 LNF). The groups were similar in reflux characteristics and hernia size. Operative time was longer for LNF (118 vs 73 min) and resulted in 1 return to the operating room and 1 readmission. Preoperative symptoms were abolished in both groups. At 6 months or longer postoperatively, scores on the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health Related Quality of Life scale improved from 20.6 to 5.0 for MSA vs 22.8 to 5.1 for LNF. Postoperative DeMeester scores (14.2 vs 5.1, p=0.0001) and the percentage of time pH was less than 4 (4.6 vs 1.1; p=0.0001) were normalized in both groups but statistically different. MSA resulted in improved gassy and bloated feelings (1.32 vs 2.36; p=0.59) and enabled belching in 67% compared with none of the LNFs. MSA results in similar objective control of GERD, symptom resolution, and improved quality of life compared with LNF. MSA seems to restore a more physiologic sphincter that allows physiologic reflux, facilitates belching, and creates less bloating and flatulence. This device has the potential to allow individualized treatment of patients with GERD and increase the surgical treatment of GERD. Copyright Â© 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

We hypothesized gastroesophageal junction competence effected by Nissen fundoplication results from closure of the crural diaphragm and creation of the fundoplication. Patients with uncomplicated reflux undergoing Nissen fundoplication were prospectively enrolled. After hiatal dissection, patients were randomized to crural closure followed by fundoplication (group 1) or fundoplication followed by crural closure (group 2). Intra-operative high-resolution manometry collected sphincter pressure and length data after complete dissection and after each component repair. Eighteen patients were randomized. When compared to the completely dissected hiatus, the mean sphincter length increased 1.3Â cm (pâ<â0.001), and mean sphincter pressure was increased by 13.7Â mmHg (pâ<â0.001). Groups 1 and 2 had similar sphincter length and pressure changes. Crural closure and fundal wrap contribute equally to sphincter length, although crural closure appears to contribute more to sphincter pressure. The Nissen fundoplication restores the function of the gastroesophageal junction and thus the reflux barrier by means of two main components: the crural closure and the construction of a 360Â° fundal wrap. Each of these components is equally important in establishing both increased sphincter length and pressure.\n\nNissen fundoplication vs proton pump inhibitors for laryngopharyngeal reflux based on pH-monitoring and symptom-scale\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Chao; Hu, Zhi-Wei; Yan, Chao; Wu, Qiong; Wu, Ji-Min; Du, Xing; Liu, Dian-Gang; Luo, Tao; Li, Fei; Wang, Zhong-Gao\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAIM To compare the outcomes between laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and type I hiatal hernia diagnosed by oropharyngeal pH-monitoring and symptom-scale assessment. METHODS From February 2014 to January 2015, 70 patients who were diagnosed with LPR and type I hiatal hernia and referred for symptomatic assessment, oropharyngeal pH-monitoring, manometry, and gastrointestinal endoscopy were enrolled in this study. All of the patients met the inclusion criteria. All of the patients underwent LNF or PPIs administration, and completed a 2-year follow-up. Patientsâ baseline characteristics and primary outcome measures, including comprehensive and single symptoms of LPR, PPIs independence, and satisfaction, and postoperative complications were assessed. The outcomes of LNF and PPIs therapy were analyzed and compared. RESULTS There were 31 patients in the LNF group and 39 patients in the PPI group. Fifty-three patients (25 in the LNF group and 28 in the PPI group) completed reviews and follow-up. Oropharyngeal pH-monitoring parameters were all abnormal with high acid exposure, a large amount of reflux, and a high Ryan score, associated reflux symptom index (RSI) score. There was a significant improvement in the RSI and LPR symptom scores after the 2-year follow-up in both groups (P < 0.05), as well as typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Improvement in the RSI (P < 0.005) and symptom scores of cough (P = 0.032), mucus (P = 0.011), and throat clearing (P = 0.022) was significantly superior in the LNF group to that in the PPI group. After LNF and PPIs therapy, 13 and 53 patients achieved independence from PPIs therapy (LNF: 44.0% vs PPI: 7.14%, P < 0.001) during follow-up, respectively.

Report of two cases and review of the literature].\n\nPubMed\n\nReyes-Zamorano, JesÃºs\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGastric volvulus can be classified according to etiology as primary or secondary, according to anatomy as or mesenteroaxial, and according to onset as acute or chronic. Management of secondary gastric volvulus acute should always be surgery and the choice of surgical procedure for treatment is chosen according to etiology. Adherolysis and extraction of foreign bodies (suture, mesh, and gastric band) are important in those cases associated with previous abdominal surgery. Nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective procedure. Severe late complications of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication are extremely rare occurrences. Among the reported complications is gastric volvulus. Presentation of two cases and review of literature. Two cases of acute gastric volvulus secondary to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication presenting with epigastric pain and nonproductive retching and treated by laparoscopy are described. Symptoms upon presentation, incidence, diagnosis, treatment and predisposing factors to gastric volvulus postfundoplication are discussed. Gastric volvulus rarely occurs as a complication of Nissen fundoplication with an incidence similar to others of late complications. The described mechanisms that originate gastric volvulus postfundoplication are related to adhesions, foreign bodies as suture (polyester), gastrostomy tubes and mesh, gastropexy and internal gastric herniation through a \"transfundoplication\" window. A high index of suspicion is required in those patients presenting with acute symptoms of gastric obstruction in the first year following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Laparoscopic approach is safe with or without gastropexy, always correcting the underlying mechanisms that cause gastric volvulus.\n\nCharges, outcomes, and complications: a comparison of magnetic sphincter augmentation versus laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for the treatment of GERD.\n\nPubMed\n\nReynolds, Jessica L; Zehetner, Joerg; Nieh, Angela; Bildzukewicz, Nikolai; Sandhu, Kulmeet; Katkhouda, Namir; Lipham, John C\n\n2016-08-01\n\nMagnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) is approved for uncomplicated GERD. Multiple studies have shown MSA to compare favorably to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) in terms of symptom control with results out to 5Â years. The MSA device itself, however, is an added cost to an anti-reflux surgery, and direct cost comparison studies have not been done between MSA and LNF. The aim of the study was to compare charges, complications, and outcome of MSA versus LNF at 1Â year. This is a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent MSA or LNF for the treatment of GERD between January 2010 and June 2013. Patient charges were collected for the surgical admission. We also collected data on 30-day complications and symptom control at 1Â year assessed by GERD-HRQL score and PPI use. There were 119 patients included in the study, 52 MSA and 67 LNF. There was no significant difference between the mean charges for MSA and LNF ($48,491 vs. $50,111, pÂ =Â 0.506). There were significant differences in OR time (66Â min MSA vs. 82Â min LNF, pÂ <Â 0.01) and LOS (17Â h MSA vs. 38Â h LNF, pÂ <Â 0.01). At 1-year follow-up, mean GERD-HRQL was 4.3 for MSA versus 5.1 for LNF (pÂ =Â 0.47) and 85Â % of MSA patients versus 92Â % of LNF patients were free from PPIs (pÂ =Â 0.37). MSA patients reported less gas bloat symptoms (23 vs. 53Â %, pÂ â¤Â 0.01) and inability to belch (10 vs. 36Â %, pÂ â¤Â 0.01) and vomit (4 vs. 19Â %, pÂ â¤Â 0.01). The side effect profile of MSA is better than LNF as evidenced by less gas bloat and increase ability to belch and vomit. LNF and MSA are comparable in symptom control, safety, and overall hospital charges. The charge for the MSA device is offset by less charges in other categories as a result of the shorter operative time and LOS.\n\nA prospective randomized study of systemic inflammation and immune response after laparoscopic nissen fundoplication performed with standard and low-pressure pneumoperitoneum.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchietroma, Mario; Carlei, Francesco; Cecilia, Emanuela M; Piccione, Federica; Sista, Federico; De Vita, Fabiola; Amicucci, Gianfranco\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare changes in the systemic inflammation and immune response in the early postoperative (p.o.) period after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) was performed with standard-pressure and low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. We studied 68 patients with documented gastroesophageal reflux disease and who underwent a LNF: 35 using standard-pressure (12 to 14 mmHg) and 33 low-pressure (6 to 8 mmHg) pneumoperitoneum. White blood cells, peripheral lymphocytes subpopulation, human leukocyte antigen-DR, neutrophil elastase, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1, and C-reactive protein were investigated. A significantly higher concentration of neutrophil elastase, IL-6 and IL-1, and C-reactive protein was detected postoperatively in the standard-pressure group of patients in comparison with the low-pressure group (P<0.05). A statistically significant change in human leukocyte antigen-DR expression was recorded p.o. at 24 hours, as a reduction of this antigen expressed on monocyte surface in patients from standard group; no changes were noted in low-pressure group patients (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that reducing the pressure of the pneumoperitoneum to 6 to 8 mm Hg during LNF is reduced p.o. inflammatory response and avoided p.o. immunosuppression.\n\nPopulation-based trend analysis of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplications for gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nZingg, U; Rosella, L; Guller, U\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are the most commonly used techniques for surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. To date, no population-based trend analysis has been reported examining the choice of procedure and short-term outcomes. This study was designed to analyze trends in the use of Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications, and corresponding short-term outcomes during a 10-year period between 1995 and 2004. A trend analysis was performed of 873 patients (Toupet: 254 patients, Nissen: 619 patients) prospectively enrolled in the database of the Swiss Association for Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. The frequency of the performed techniques remained stable during the observation period (p value for trend 0.206). The average postoperative and total length of hospital stay both significantly decreased during the 10-year period from 5.6 to 4.0 days and 6.8 to 4.8 days, respectively (both p values for trend <0.001). The average duration of surgery decreased significantly from 141 minutes to 121 minutes (p value for trend <0.001). There was a trend towards less complications in later years (2000-2004) compared to early years (1995-1999, p = 0.058). Conversion rates were significantly lower in later years compared with early years (p = 0.004). This is the first trend analysis in the literature reporting clinical outcomes of 873 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing Nissen and Toupet fundoplications during a 10-year period. The proportion of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications remained stable over time, indicating that literature reports of the advantages of one procedure over the other had minimal influence on surgeons' choice of technique. Length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, morbidity, and conversion rate decreased over time, reflecting the learning curve. Clearly, patient outcomes have much improved during the 10-year observation period.\n\nTraining for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with a newly designed model: a replacement for animal tissue models?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChristie, Lorna; Goossens, Richard; Jakimowicz, Jack J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground To bridge the early learning curve for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication from the clinical setting to a safe environment, training models can be used. This study aimed to develop a reusable, low-cost model to be used for training in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedure as an alternative to the use of animal tissue models. Methods From artificial organs and tissue, an anatomic model of the human upper abdomen was developed for training in performing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The 20 participants and tutors in the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) upper gastrointestinal surgery course completed four complementary tasks of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with the artificial model, then compared the realism, haptic feedback, and training properties of the model with those of animal tissue models. Results The main difference between the two training models was seen in the properties of the stomach. The wrapping of the stomach in the artificial model was rated significantly lower than that in the animal tissue model (mean, 3.6 vs. 4.2; pÂ =Â 0.010). The main criticism of the stomach of the artificial model was that it was too rigid for making a proper wrap. The suturing of the stomach wall, however, was regarded as fairly realistic (mean, 3.6). The crura on the artificial model were rated better (mean, 4.3) than those on the animal tissue (mean, 4.0), although the difference was not significant. The participants regarded the model as a good to excellent (mean, 4.3) training tool. Conclusion The newly developed model is regarded as a good tool for training in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedure. It is cheaper, more durable, and more readily available for training and can therefore be used in every training center. The stomach of this model, however, still needs improvement because it is too rigid for making the wrap.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of conversion from Nissen to Toupet on dysphagia and bloating. The study used a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone conversion from Nissen to Toupet between 2001 and 2014. Endpoints were to determine the effect of conversion on dysphagia, bloating, and reflux control. Twenty-five patients underwent conversion at a median of 3.7Â years (1.4-10.5) after initial fundoplication. Indications were dysphagia in 19 (76%) and bloating syndrome in 6 (24%) patients. The median operative time was 104Â min (86-146). There were no serious complications or mortality. Median follow-up was 27Â months (0.8-130). Dysphagia was relieved in 16 (84%) and bloating in all 6 patients. Two patients developed reflux requiring a redo-Nissen. Two patients had persistent dysphagia and required endoscopic dilation. The GERD-HRQL post-conversion showed a median score of 5 (3-13). Conversion relieved dysphagia in 84% and bloating in 100%. Significant recurrence of GERD was rare. Given the absence of serious complications, conversion should be considered in patients with severe bloating or dysphagia.\n\nLong-term symptom control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 12 years after laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoks, D J; Broeders, J A; Baigrie, R J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication has been shown to achieve similar reflux control to Nissen fundoplication, with fewer side-effects, up to 5 years. However, there is a paucity of long-term follow-up data on this technique and antireflux surgery in general. This study reports 12-year outcomes of a double-blind RCT comparing laparoscopic Nissen versus 180Â° laparoscopic anterior fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Patients with proven GORD were randomized to laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior fundoplication. The 12-year outcome measures included reflux control, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms and patient satisfaction. Measures included scores on a visual analogue scale, a validated Dakkak score for dysphagia and Visick scores. Of the initial 163 patients randomized (Nissen 84, anterior 79), 90 (55Â·2 per cent) completed 12-year follow-up (Nissen 52, anterior 38). There were no differences in heartburn, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms, patient satisfaction or surgical reintervention rate. Use of acid-suppressing drugs was less common after Nissen than after 180Â° anterior fundoplication: four of 52 (8 per cent) and 11 of 38 (29 per cent) respectively (P = 0Â·008). The proportion of patients with absent or only mild symptoms was slightly higher after Nissen fundoplication: 45 of 50 (90 per cent) versus 28 of 38 (74 per cent) (P = 0Â·044). The two surgical procedures provided similar control of heartburn and post-fundoplication symptoms, with similar patient satisfaction and reoperation rates on long-term follow-up.

Particularly after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, it has proven to result in worse symptomatic outcome and a lower postoperative quality of life in comparison to patients without preoperative gas-related symptoms. Aim of the study was to compare the postoperative outcome in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as comorbidity after either laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication or 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication with main focus on the frequency and subjective impairment of gas-related symptoms. In 56 gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients, the comorbidity of aerophagia was diagnosed prior to laparoscopic antireflux surgery. Irrespective of their preoperative manometric findings, the patients were either scheduled to a laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen (n=28) or a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication (n=28). All patients have been analysed concerning the presence of gas-related symptoms preoperatively as well as 3 months after surgery. Additionally, the subjective degree of impairment was evaluated using a numerous rating scale (0=no perception/impairment, 100=most severe perception/impairment). The following symptoms have been analysed: ability/inability to belch, 'gas bloat', flatulence, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. Before surgery, there were no significant differences between both surgical groups. Three months after surgery, significant differences (p<0.05-0.01) were found: patients who underwent a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication suffered from less impairing gas bloat, flatulence and postprandial fullness when compared with patients with a 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication. The majority of these patients were able to belch postoperatively but felt no impairment due to this symptom. In contrast, patients of the Nissen group felt a significant impairment due to the\n\nThe Durability of Endoscopic Therapy for Treatment of Barrett's Metaplasia, Dysplasia, and Mucosal Cancer After Nissen Fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Corey S; Louie, Brian E; Wille, Aaron; Dunst, Christy M; Worrell, Stephanie G; DeMeester, Steven R; Reynolds, Jessica; Dixon, Joe; Lipham, John C; Lada, Michal; Peters, Jeffrey H; Watson, Thomas J; Farivar, Alexander S; Aye, Ralph W\n\n2015-05-01\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) Â± endoscopic resection (EMR) is an established treatment strategy for neoplastic Barrett's and intramucosal cancer. Most patients are managed with proton pump inhibitors. The incidence of recurrent Barrett's metaplasia, dysplasia, or cancer after complete eradication is up to 43 % using this strategy. We hypothesize the addition of fundoplication should result in a lower recurrence rates after complete eradication. Multi-institutional retrospective review of patients undergoing endotherapy followed by Nissen fundoplication A total of 49 patients underwent RFA Â± EMR followed by Nissen fundoplication. Complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM) was achieved in 26 (53 %) patients, complete remission of dysplasia (CR-D) in 16 (33 %) patients, and 7 (14 %) had persistent neoplastic Barrett's. After fundoplication, 18/26 (70 %) remained in CR-IM. An additional 10/16 CR-D achieved CR-IM and 4/7 with persistent dysplasia achieved CR-IM. One patient progressed to LGD while no patient developed HGD or cancer. Endoscopic therapy for Barrett's dysplasia and/or intramucosal cancer followed by fundoplication results in similar durability of CR-IM to patients being managed with PPIs alone after endoscopic therapy. However, fundoplication may be superior in preventing further progression of disease and the development of cancer. Fundoplication is an important strategy to achieve and maintain CR-IM, and facilitate eradication of persistent dysplasia.\n\nLaparoscopic anterior 180-degree versus nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nBroeders, Joris A; Roks, David J; Ahmed Ali, Usama; Watson, David I; Baigrie, Robert J; Cao, Zhanguo; Hartmann, Jens; Maddern, Guy J\n\n2013-05-01\n\nTo compare short- and long-term outcome after 180-degree laparoscopic anterior fundoplication (180-degree LAF) with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). LNF is currently the most frequently performed surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Alternatively, 180-degree LAF has been alleged to reduce troublesome dysphagia and gas-related symptoms, with similar reflux control. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and web of Knowledge CPCI-S were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing primary 180-degree LAF with LNF. The methodological quality was evaluated to assess bias risk. Primary outcomes were esophageal acid exposure, esophagitis, heartburn score, dilatation for dysphagia, modified Dakkak dysphagia score (0-45), and reoperation rate. Meta-analysis was conducted at 1 and 5 years. Five distinct randomized clinical trials comparing 180-degree LAF (n = 227) with LNF (n = 231) were identified. At 1 year, the Dakkak dysphagia score [2.8 vs 4.8; weighted mean difference: -2.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.66 to -1.83; P < 0.001], gas bloating [11% vs 18%; relative risk (RR) 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36-0.97; P = 0.04], flatulence (14% vs 25%; RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35-0.91; P = 0.02), inability to belch (19% vs 31%; RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40-0.99; P = 0.05), and inability to relieve bloating (34% vs 44%; RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.99; P = 0.04) were lower after 180-degree LAF.

Larger RCTs have been relatively short in duration, and have reported mixed results regarding symptom control and effect on quality of life (QOL). Economic evaluations have reported conflicting results. To determine the incremental cost-utility of LNF versus PPI for treating patients with chronic and controlled GERD over 3 years from the societal perspective. Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a RCT that enrolled 104 patients from October 2000 to September 2004. Primary study outcome was GERD symptoms (secondary outcomes included QOL and cost-utility). Resource utilization and QOL data collected at regular follow-up intervals determined incremental cost/QALY gained. Stochastic uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping and methodologic assumptions were assessed using sensitivity analysis. No statistically significant differences in GERD symptom scores, but LNF did result in fewer heartburn days and improved QOL. Costs were higher for LNF patients by $3205/patient over 3 years but QOL was also higher as measured by either QOL instrument. Based on total costs, incremental cost-utility of LNF was $29,404/QALY gained using the Health Utility Index 3. Cost-utility results were sensitive to the utility instrument used ($29,404/QALY for Health Utility Index 3, $31,117/QALY for the Short Form 6D, and $76,310/QALY for EuroQol 5D) and if current lower prices for PPIs were used in the analysis. Results varied depending on resource use/costs included in the analysis, the QOL instrument used, and the cost of PPIs; however, LNF was generally found to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with symptomatic controlled GERD requiring long-term management.

This survey aimed to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for treatment of GERD-related respiratory symptoms not responsive to medical therapy in neurological normal children. We collected data of children with GERD-related respiratory complaints not responsive to medical therapy who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in four European centers of Pediatric Surgery over a 10-year period. We excluded children with neurological impairment. A total of 220 laparoscopic Nissen procedures were performed in the period 2005-2015. Twenty-four (12 boys and 12 girls, average age 9.5 years) out of the 220 patients (10.9%) presented with chronic cough and other respiratory manifestations, including asthma, reactive airway disease, and recurrent pneumonia. Average operative time was 65 minutes (range 45-100). As for postoperative complications, two tight wraps requiring endoscopic dilatation (IIIb Clavien) and two relapses of GERD for slipped Nissen requiring reoperation (IIIb Clavien) were recorded. None of these complications occurred in the group of patients with GERD-related respiratory symptoms. At follow-up evaluation, respiratory symptoms disappeared with a significant improvement of quality of life scoring (I Grade Visick) in 22/24 patients (91.6%). Our results confirm that GERD should be investigated as one of the possible etiologic factors in any child with persistent respiratory complaints. In patients with symptoms not responsive to medical therapy, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the treatment of choice with a very high success rate (>90% in our series), a very low morbidity, a significant improvement in airway symptoms, and a marked reduction in the need for medications.\n\n[Efficacy comparison of laparoscopic Nissen, Toupet and Dor fundoplication in the treatment of hiatal hernia complicated with gastroesophageal reflux disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Fuzeng; Zhang, Cheng; Ke, Limu; Wang, Zhi; Li, Yiliang; Li, Huiling; Du, Zhi\n\n2016-09-25\n\nTo compare the efficacy and safety among laparoscopic Nissen, Toupet and Dor fundoplication in the treatment of hiatal hernia complicated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Clinical data of 276 patients of hiatal hernia complicated with GERD undergoing operation in our hospital from December 2012 to January 2015 were retrospectively analyzed, including 149 patients of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (Nissen group), 41 of laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (Toupet group), and 86 patients of laparoscopic Dor fundoplication (Dor group). Esophageal reflux status, esophageal manometry, GERD Q rating scale, and postoperative recovery were compare among the three groups. Reflux status was improved significantly in the three groups after operation(all P<0.05),except that the efficacy in reducing reflux episodes and reflux longest time was not obvious in Toupet group(P>0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative reflux time, acid reflux time ratio, reflux longest time ratio, DeMeester score among the three groups (all P>0.05). Pairwise comparison showed that Dor group was significantly better than Toupet group in reducing the number of reflux episode(14.36Â±10.58 vs. 29.83Â±19.71) and long-reflux (0.64Â±0.21 vs. 6.20Â±3.48)(both P<0.05), but Nissen group was better than these two groups in reducing the number of long-reflux (0.38Â±0.16, P<0.05). As compared to pre-operation, the postoperative esophageal sphincter pressure and residual pressure increased significantly, and the relaxation rate reduced significantly (all P<0.05), while the episode of ineffective swallowing increased significantly in Toupet group (11.25Â±2.04 vs. 6.36Â±3.26, P<0.05). The contrast in esophageal manometry between Toupet and Dor group showed that Dor group was better than Toupet group in the recovery of lower esophageal sphincter pressure (mean resting breathing) [(20.69Â±13.95) mmHg vs.(12.91Â±6.89) mmHg] and the decrease of ineffective swallowing [9.15Â±6.44 vs. 11\n\nDoes Nissen fundoplication improve deglutition in children?\n\nPubMed\n\nSoyer, Tutku; YalÃ§Ä±n, Åule; Demir, Numan; Karhan, Asuman Nur; SaltÄ±k-Temizel, Ä°nci Nur; Demir, HÃ¼lya; Tanyel, Feridun Cahit\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSoyer T, YalÃ§Ä±n Å, Demir N, Karhan AN, SaltÄ±k-Temizel Ä°N, Demir H, Tanyel FC. Does Nissen fundoplication improve deglutition in children? Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 28-34. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the effect of Nissen fundoplication (NF) on deglutition in children. Children who underwent NF between 2011-2015 were evaluated for demographic features, clinical findings, diagnostic methods for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and indications for NF. Penetration aspiration scale (PAS), functional oral intake scale (FOIS) and esophageal functions were evaluated by videoflouroscopy (VFS). Preoperative and postoperative VFS findings were compared to evaluate the effect of NF on clinical findings and deglutition. Twenty-three children with a mean age of 5.08 Â± 3.7 years were included. Female to male ratio was 15:8. Recurrent respiratory infections (RTI) (n: 14, 60.8%), swallowing dysfunction (n:13, 56.5%) and vomiting (n:10, 43.4%) were the most common symptoms. Preoperatively GER was diagnosed with barium swallowing study (BSS) contrast graphs (n:20, 87%) and with 24-hour esophageal pH monitorization (n:8, 34.8%). In 39.1% of patients, medical treatment for GER was used with a mean duration of 8 Â± 5.8 months. Indications for NF were swallowing dysfunction (n: 18, 78%), GER complications (n:6, 26%), associated anatomical problems (n:4, 17.3%) and unresponsiveness to medical treatment (n: 3, 13%). Postoperative barium swallowing study and 24-hour esophageal pH monitorization showed no GER after NF in 95% of patients. Number of RTI were significantly decreased after NF (preoperative vs postoperative infection rate 4.21 vs 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05). VFS findings showed that PAS was significantly decreased after NF during both liquid and semi-liquid swallowing (p < 0.05).

Developing laparoscopic technical skills can be difficult as there has been a decrease in the number of procedures performed. This study aims to develop an inexpensive and anatomically relevant model for training in laparoscopic foregut procedures. An ex vivo , anatomic model of the human upper abdomen was developed using intact porcine esophagus, stomach, diaphragm and spleen. The Toronto lap-Nissen simulator was contained in a laparoscopic box-trainer and included an arch system to simulate the normal radial shape and tension of the diaphragm. We integrated the use of this training model as a part of our laparoscopic skills laboratory-training curriculum. Afterwards, we surveyed trainees to evaluate the observed benefit of the learning session. Twenty-five trainees and five faculty members completed a survey regarding the use of this model. Among the trainees, only 4 (16%) had experience with laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication. They reported that practicing with the model was a valuable use of their limited time, repeating the exercise would be of additional benefit, and that the exercise improved their ability to perform or assist in an actual case in the operating room. Significant improvements were found in the following subjective measures comparing pre- vs. post-training: (I) knowledge level (5.6 vs. 8.0, P<0.001); (II) comfort level in assisting (6.3 vs. 7.6, P<0.001); and (III) comfort level in performing as the primary surgeon (4.9 vs. 7.1, P<0.001). The trainees and faculty members agreed that this model was of adequate fidelity and was a representative simulation of actual human anatomy.

METHODS: Fifty-six patients (26 men, 30 women; mean age 42.8 Â± 14.7 years) presenting for minimally invasive surgery for oesophageal achalasia, were enrolled. All patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy followed by a 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in 30 cases (group 1) and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in 26 (group 2). Intraoperative endoscopy and manometry were used to calibrate the myotomy and fundoplication. A 6-mo follow-up period with symptomatic evaluation and barium swallow was undertaken. One and two years after surgery, the patients underwent symptom questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 h oesophago-gastric pH monitoring. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, no significant difference in the median symptom score was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.66; Mann-Whitney U-test). The median percentage time with oesophageal pH < 4 was significantly higher in the Dor group compared to the Nissen-Rossetti group (2; range 0.8-10 vs 0.35; range 0-2) (P < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney U-test). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic Dor and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication achieved similar results in the resolution of dysphagia. Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication seems to be more effective in suppressing oesophageal acid exposure.

We compared the results of thoracoscopic Collis gastroplasty-laparoscopic Nissen procedure for the treatment of TSOE with the results of standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Between 1995 and 2013, the Collis-Nissen procedure was performed in 65 patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery when the length of the abdominal oesophagus, measured intraoperatively after maximal oesophageal mediastinal mobilization, was â¤1.5 cm. The results of the Collis-Nissen procedure were frequency-matched according to age, sex and period of surgical treatment with those of 65 standard Nissen fundoplication procedures in patients with a length of the abdominal oesophagus >1.5 cm. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were evaluated according to the Accordion classification. The patients underwent a timed clinical-instrumental follow-up that included symptoms assessment, barium swallow and endoscopy. Symptoms, oesophagitis and global results were graded according to semi-quantitative scales. The results were considered to be excellent in the absence of symptoms and oesophagitis, good if symptoms occurred two to four times a month in the absence of oesophagitis, fair if symptoms occurred two to four times a week in the presence of hyperaemia, oedema and/or microscopic oesophagitis and poor if symptoms occurred on a daily basis in the presence of any grade of endoscopic oesophagitis, hiatal hernia of any size or type, or the need for antireflux medical therapy. The follow-up time was calculated from the time of surgery to the last complete follow-up. The postoperative mortality rate was 1.5% for the Collis-Nissen and 0 for the Nissen procedure. The postoperative complication rate was 24% for the Collis-Nissen and 7% for Nissen (P = 0.001) procedure. The complication rate for the Collis-Nissen procedure was 43% in the first 32 cases and 6% in the last 33 cases (P < 0.0001).

Of the 180 patients eligible for randomization, 104 gave informed consent, and 3 withdrew from the study immediately after randomization. The patients randomized to medical therapy received optimized treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) using a standardized management protocol based on best evidence and published guidelines. The surgical patients underwent LNF by one of four surgeons using a previously published technique. The patients underwent symptom evaluation using the GERD symptom scale (GERSS) and the global visual analog scale (VAS) for overall symptom control. They had 24-h esophageal pH monitoring at baseline and after 3 years. The medical patients were evaluated receiving PPI, and the surgical patients were evaluated not receiving PPI. For the 3-year follow-up assessment, 93 patients were available. At 3 years, surgery was associated with more heartburn-free days, showing a mean difference of -1.35 days per week (p = 0.0077) and a lower VAS score (p = 0.0093) than medical management. Surgical patients reported improved quality of life on the general health subscore of the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) at 3 years, with a mean difference of -12.19 (p = 0.0124). The groups did not differ significantly in terms of GERSS or acid exposure on 24-h esophageal pH monitoring at 3 years. There were six treatment failures (11.8%) in the surgical group and eight treatment failures (16%) in the medical group by 3 years. For patients whose GERD symptoms are stable and controlled with PPI, continuing medical therapy and laparoscopic antireflux surgery are equally effective, although surgery may result in better symptom control and quality of life.\n\nReflux symptoms and side effects among patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease at baseline, during treatment with PPIs, and after Nissen fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nRantanen, Tuomo; Kiljander, Toni; Salminen, Paulina; Ranta, Arto; Oksala, Niku; Kellokumpu, Ilmo\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThere are no prospective studies available on the behavior of extraesophageal and esophageal symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients without effective antireflux medication, receiving the most effective antireflux medication, and after laparoscopic fundoplication. Extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms and treatment-related side effects were assessed in 60 patients while they were on no effective antireflux medication (three-week washout period), after three month of treatment with double-dose esomeprazole, and 3 months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Esophageal and extraesophageal reflux symptoms, rectal flatulence, and bloating were analyzed with the visual analog scale. In addition, dysphagia, rectal flatulence, and bloating were recorded as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Both extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms decreased after treatment with esomeprazole and were further reduced after fundoplication. Dysphagia and flatulence did not increase from baseline after surgery. Bloating decreased both after treatment with esomeprazole and after fundoplication. In contrast, dysphagia and increased flatus were found more often after surgery than during treatment with esomeprazole. Dysphagia and rectal flatulence were less common during treatment with esomeprazole than at baseline or after surgery. Both extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms decreased after treatment with esomeprazole and were reduced further after fundoplication. Any treatment-related side effect was not increased after surgery when compared to baseline. However, compared to esomeprazole there was more dysphagia and flatulence after fundoplication.\n\nRandomized clinical trial of laparoscopic anterior 180Â° partial versus 360Â° Nissen fundoplication: 5-year results.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Z; Cai, W; Qin, M; Zhao, H; Yue, P; Li, Y\n\n2012-02-01\n\nAnterior partial fundoplication (AF) has been popularized by a lower risk of mechanical side effects. The question then emerges whether anterior partial wrap has a similar antireflux effect with Nissen fundoplication (NF). We therefore conducted a randomized study to compare the long-term outcome of anterior fundoplication with NF. One hundred patients who enrolled in the trial from May 2003 to March 2005 were randomized to laparoscopic AF or laparoscopic NF. Endoscopy, pH monitoring, manometry, a detailed questionnaire, and a visual analog symptom score were completed preoperative at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgical procedures. The postoperative adverse effects such as dysphagia and flatulence were compared between the two groups. Revision surgery or maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy was defined as failure. Fifty procedures were performed in each group. The outcome at 5 years follow-up was determined for 96 patients (96%; 49 patients in the AF group and 47 in the NF group). Three patients (3%) died of unrelated causes during follow-up, and one patient changed address. Both fundoplications were found to provide good control of reflux-related symptoms in most of the patients. For 96 patients followed up more than 5 years, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were well controlled in 81 patients (84.38%); the mean DeMeester scores in the AF group decreased from 106.89 Â± 14.12 to 12.67 Â± 3.14 and in the NF group from 109.51 Â± 17.98 to 10.81 Â± 2.65, and the esophagitis was ameliorated visibly. Moreover, there were significantly fewer patients in the AF group who complained of flatulence. Compared with NF, anterior 180Â° partial fundoplication is an effective treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and associates with fewer postoperative adverse effects. Â© 2011 Copyright the Authors.

From January 1978 to October 1998, 64 patients with achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm underwent esophagomyotomy and antireflux operation via left thoracotomy. Twenty-one patients underwent Nissen total fundoplication (Nissen group) and 43 patients underwent Belsey Marker IV partial fundoplication (Belsey group). Clinical, radiologic, radionuclide transit, manometric, 24-hour pH monitoring and endoscopic assessments were performed before and after the operation. There was no operative death and major complications for either group. At over 6 years follow-up and compared to Belsey group, patients in Nissen group revealed a higher frequency of dysphagia (P = 0.025) and more radionuclide material retention (P = 0.044). Both operative procedures reduced the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient. However, in Nissen group, the esophageal diameter observed on radiology was significantly increased from 3.9 cm preoperatively to 5.5 cm postoperatively (P = 0.012), while it kept the same for Belsey group (from 5.4 to 5.3 cm, P = 0.695). Reoperation in order to relieve the recurrent dysphagia and esophageal obstruction was performed on 8 patients in Nissen group and 1 in Belsey group (P < 0.01). When treating achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm by esophageal myotomy and an antireflux operation, a total fundoplication is not appropriate, whereas a partial fundoplication provides proper antireflux effect without significant esophageal emptying difficulty.\n\nEsophageal Achalasia: Predictive Value of Preoperative Resting Pressure of LES Correlated with Type of Fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nTancredi, Antonio; Cuttitta, Antonello; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo; Taurchini, Marco\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe aim of the present study is to show the predictive value of the preoperative resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) correlated with the type of fundoplication (Nissen or Dor) after Heller myotomy in our series. From January 1998 to June 2010, 88 patients affected by esophageal achalasia underwent surgery at our unit. However, our study focused on a sample of 36 patients, because many data were lost or was never recorded. Among these, 14 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Nissen fundoplication (group N), whereas 22 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication (group D). Clinical evaluation was performed using a modified DeMeester symptom scoring system consisting of the assessment of three symptoms: dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn. To each symptom was assigned a score from 0 to 3, depending on its severity, and the reduction in the severity of each symptom after surgery was assessed. The surgical treatment is considered to be effective (p<0.0001). The preoperative resting pressures of LES were compared by Student's t-test, and it was found that patients who reported a greater improvement in the dysphagia symptom had a preoperative average pressure of LES that was significantly higher than that in other patients in both group N (p=0.03) and group D (p=0.01; p=0.003; p=0.001). The Dor treatment was shown to be more effective than the Nissen treatment (p<0.0001). The preoperative resting pressure of LES is a predictive factor of surgical success both before Dor fundoplication and before Nissen fundoplication, but its predictive power is influenced by the chosen type of fundoplication.\n\nAnalysis of Growth, Nutritional Status and Hospital Visitation Scores Associated with Reflux After Nissen Fundoplication in Neurologically Impaired Children with Gastroesophageal Reflux.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Chaeyoun; Youn, Joong Kee; Han, Ji-Won; Kim, Hyun-Young; Jung, Sung-Eun\n\n2018-05-01\n\nNeurologically impaired children (NIC) often experience swallowing difficulties and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although these conditions could place children in a state of poor nutritional status and prevent them from thriving, there is insufficient research evaluating growth and nutritional status following fundoplication in these patients. This is a retrospective study of patients who were neurologically impaired and underwent Nissen fundoplication between April 2001 and March 2015. Seventy-six patients were enrolled, and the follow-up period was 12Â months or longer. Growth was measured by the change in body weight and height. Nutritional status was measured by the change in body mass index, serum albumin and protein level. Median age at operation was 1.85Â years old, and median body weight was 10Â kg. The respective ZÂ scores for weight and height showed significant improvements after 1Â year since the operation compared to 1Â year within the operation (-2.42Â Â±Â 2.19 vs. -1.31Â Â±Â 1.96, PÂ <Â 0.001) (-1.6Â Â±Â 2.16 vs. -1.05Â Â±Â 1.69, PÂ =Â 0.002). The respective ZÂ scores for body mass index, albumin and protein also showed improvements after 1Â year since the operation compared to 1Â year within the operation (-2.07Â Â±Â 2.99 vs. -0.89Â Â±Â 2.1, PÂ <Â 0.001) (3.55Â Â±Â 0.48 vs. 3.86Â Â±Â 0.45, PÂ <Â 0.001) (6.22Â Â±Â 0.76 vs. 6.65Â Â±Â 0.51, PÂ <Â 0.001). Hospital visitation scores associated with reflux were significantly lower after the operation (4.1Â Â±Â 3.43 vs. 1.18Â Â±Â 1.67, PÂ <Â 0.001). In summary, after Nissen fundoplication in NIC with GER, growth and nutritional status improved significantly. Also, hospital visitation scores associated with reflux decreased after the operation.\n\nTeflon pledget reinforced fundoplication causes symptomatic gastric and esophageal lumenal penetration.\n\nPubMed\n\nDally, Elizabeth; Falk, Gregory L\n\n2004-02-01\n\nNissen fundoplication has become the standard operative procedure for the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. The use of Teflon pledgets in Nissen fundoplications by our unit has been associated with a number of complications that has led to a change of technique in performing these operations. We reviewed our database of all patients who had fundoplications that involved the use of pledgets and identified those who had represented with postoperative complications related to pledget erosion/migration. We identified 11 patients to date from a total of 1,175 fundoplications who had symptomatic pledget erosion occurring between 2 and 85 months after surgery (mean time 33.3 months). Symptoms included dysphagia, recurrent symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, and melaena, and in some cases significant morbidity was associated with the erosion. No common factor predisposing these patients to pledget erosion was identified. In the majority of cases removal of the pledget was associated with resolution of the symptoms. A review of the literature does not reveal any similar studies but problems associated with the erosion and migration of Teflon prostheses are described. The use of Teflon pledgets in fundoplication is associated with a small but significant risk of complications that has led to our unit abandoning this technique.\n\nCollis-Nissen gastroplasty for shortened esophagus: long-term evaluation.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichardson, J D; Richardson, R L\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: The authors studied the short- and long-term results of an esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis gastroplasty) combined with a Nissen fundoplication in the management of patients with shortened esophagus and stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Summary Background Data There are several options for managing a shortened esophagus. There have been few long-term series with analysis of results regarding a lengthening procedure combined with a total fundoplication. METHODS: A personal series of 52 patients was examined with complete follow-up available for an average of 7 years. RESULTS: There were no deaths, esophageal leaks, or esophageal complications in the early postoperative period. Control of reflux was excellent and all patients had their dysphagia improved. The majority of patients with preoperative strictures required at least one postoperative dilation, but in most the need for dilation was short term. CONCLUSIONS: The Collis-Nissen procedure is a safe and reasonable alternative in the small subset of patients with severe reflux disease causing a shortened esophagus and stricture. Images Figure 1.
