This book grew out of his initial informal attempts to improve ABSITE scores among his own resients at Harbor-UCLA. Over the years, this effort has grown an expane, incluing collaborators from multiple institutions, to prouce a book that has become an essential tool in the surgical resient’s armamentarium. The most valuable aspect of this book, in my humble opinion, is that in aition to questions testing pure “iactic” knowlege—factois the resient is expecte to learn by rote an memorize—there are many clinical questions that require an avance level of cognitive effort. Here, the learner is expecte to synthesize anatomic an physiologic knowlege within a clinical context an exercise surgical jugment base on probabilities of ifferent outcomes. Too often, books specically targete at passing multiple-choice examinations ten to skip the latter, in favor of questions that have easy answers—hence the common surgical aphorism that there are more exam questions on the clinical presentation of MEN- synrome than patients with this isease! Writing questions that test esoteric minutiae is easy; writing questions that promote further reaing an stuy of complex surgical scenarios is much harer. I applau Dr. e Virgilio an his colleagues for reaching this higher goal, while still incluing the “knowlege-regurgitation” questions that are an inevitable part of the stanarize exam process. Each question is followe by a thoughtful explanation of the right answer, with accompanying\n\nreferences, to provie a brief summary of essential relevant knowlege. The newest eition also inclues a summary of “high-yiel” principles at the beginning of each chapter, which will further enhance the goal of rapi issemination of essential information on a given topic. In aition to serving as a valuable training tool for the in-service examination, it is our hope that this book will also inspire the resient to augment their learning by elving into relevant sections of textbooks an online resources, incluing vieos an pocasts—all part an parcel of the total eucational package freely available to moern surgical trainees. The breath an epth of multimeia eucation available toay is enormous, compare to what I ha as a resient; conversely, the volume of knowlege an technical skills new surgeons are expecte to learn an master has also increase signicantly. The oubling of scientic knowlege, in meicine an surgery, is now occurring at an exponential pace, an we nee all the help we can get to keep up! I am grateful to Dr. e Virgilio an his colleagues for continuing to invest the effort necessary to upate this wonerful book, so it can continue to serve as a vital resource for present an future surgeons. Sharmila Dissanaike, MD, FACS, FCCM Peter C. Canizaro Chair, University Distinguishe Professor of Surgery, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Lubbock, Texas\n\nxi\n\nPreface We are thrille about this thir eition of Review of Surgery for ABSITE and Boards, create to help stuents of surgery prepare for the American Boar of Surgery In-Training (ABSITE) an the American Boar of Surgery (ABS) Qualifying (written) Examination. The original inspiration for the book stemme from a surgery review program we evelope at Harbor-UCLA Meical Center, esigne to stimulate the resients to rea, improve performance on the ABSITE, an enhance their likelihoo of passing the ABS examinations on the rst try. We were inspire to hear that the rst two eitions prove to be a valuable resource. With that in min, we have strive to make the 3r eition even better with some exciting upates an changes. Areg Grigorian an I have ae three new Assistant Eitors to our team, Drs. Amana Pury, Eric Yeates, an Naveen Balan. All are surgical resients; Drs. Pury an Balan at Harbor-UCLA an Dr. Yeates at UC Irvine. We hanpicke them because of their outstaning recor of accomplishment in test taking an question writing an their emonstrate strong interest in surgical eucation. We have also ae numerous resients an surgical eucators from aroun the country (an even one from Colombia) as contributing authors. Another important new feature is that we ae a summary of high-yiel information at the beginning of each chapter. We feel this will serve as a rapi-re way to brush up on key points. We have also ae new, high-yiel questions to remain up-to-ate with the ever-changing an ynamic el of surgery.\n\nFinally, we have ae illustrations from an increibly talente surgical illustrator, Dr. Stephanie Cohen, who is a surgical resient at Beth Israel Deaconess. We love her work so much that we aske her to make a rawing for the cover! The cover illustration, which combines elements of art, music, an anatomy, remins us that Surgery is both an art an a science. To master the arts requires tremenous eication. Excellent surgical knowlege is one characteristic that is paramount to becoming an outstaning surgeon. This requires a lifelong commitment to reaing an then testing your knowlege. We believe that the ieal way to acquire knowlege is to create a year-roun reaing program. Strive to rea aily, even if just for 15 minutes. As with the original version, we believe that the greatest value of our book lies in the esign of the questions an the robust responses. The questions are intene to make you think (try not to get frustrate if you miss many of them!). We provie in-epth explanations for why we feel the correct answer is right an why the incorrect answers are wrong. Please be aware that no textbook or review book has all the answers. Some questions an answers may be controversial. If you isagree with a question or think you foun an error, we woul love to hear back from you (our emails are cevirgilio@lunquist.org an [email protected]u). We sincerely hope you n our review book useful.

Instilling ialysate in the peritoneal cavity without the ability to remove it may lea to abominal istention an mil pain. The rst step for a suspecte malpositione PD catheter that may have been ippe or kinke is to obtain a KUB. If the catheter appears malpositione, then a reasonable next step woul be to return to the OR for iagnostic laparoscopy to reposition the catheter. For catheters that are clogge (resistance to instilling ialysate through the catheter or inability to instill ui), tPA can be use (C). Omentopexy or omentectomy can also be helpful in cases of a malfunctioning catheter ue to obstruction. Peritonitis is a common complication of PD an accounts for 50% of technical failures. This complication presents with abominal pain, fever, an clouy ialysate. The initial management involves intraperitoneal antibiotics, most commonly vancomycin, which cures 75% of cases without iscontinuation of PD (D). Patients who continue to become increasingly septic may require intravenous (IV) antibiotics as well (E). Any fungal infection of PD requires prompt removal of the catheter (A).

It is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract. Pancreatic heterotopia is foun in a minority of cases. The most common heterotopic tissue foun in resecte specimens is gastric mucosa, which can lea to ulcer formation an GI bleeing. Meckel with gastric mucosa is locate at the antimesenteric borer; however, ulceration occurs in the opposite mesenteric borer of the ileum. Symptomatic cases require surgical intervention. The management of an incientally iscovere asymptomatic Meckel iverticulum uring abominal exploration is a controversial topic. Recently, it has been suggeste to selectively intervene on patients with risk factors, namely age  cm in iameter, presence of heterotopic tissue, palpation of abnormal noules, or presence of brous bans. This patient has three inications for removal incluing age 1 mmHg. This is assesse by measuring the blaer pressure while the patient is paralyze. ACS is ene by IAH >0 mmHg AND evience of en-organ malperfusion (i.e., oliguria) (A). Patients who are mechanically ventilate often have high peak pressures. Primary ACS occurs most commonly after surgical proceures associate with massive resuscitation an tense fascial closure. Seconary ACS is ue to meical conitions such as ascites or conitions requiring resuscitation without an abominal proceure (i.e., signicant burn injury). Nasogastric ecompression an neuromuscular blockae are conservative measures to treat IAH but neither has been proven to signicantly reuce mortality (C). Reucing IAH with paracentesis shoul be performe rst in seconary ACS ue to ascites (D). In refractory cases an all other cases of ACS, ecompressive laparotomy shoul be performe expeitiously to lower mortality. The pathophysiology of ACS involves compression of the IVC, which can lea to elevate SVC pressures, an in turn increase intracranial pressures resulting in ecrease cerebral perfusion pressures (E). Reference: Muresan M, Muresan S, Brinzaniuc K, et al. How\n\nit reaily mimics an intraabominal perforation. Because it is typically very ifcult to iagnose preoperatively, the iagnosis is most often mae at surgery. Torsion of the omentum escribes a twisting of the omentum aroun its vascular peicle along the long axis. Primary torsion, in which case there is no unerlying pathology, is extremely rare. Seconary torsion is much more common, an the torsion is usually precipitate by a xe point such as a tumor, an ahesion, a hernia sac, or an area of intraabominal inammation. Omental torsion is much more common in aults in their fourth or fth ecae of life. Chilren with torsion are typically obese, likely contributing to a fatty omentum that preisposes to twisting. Other factors that preispose a patient to torsion inclue a bi omentum an a narrowe omental peicle. In primary omental torsion, the twiste omentum tens to be localize to the right sie; thus, it is most commonly confuse with acute appenicitis, acute cholecystitis, an pelvic inammatory isease (D). Complicating the iagnosis is the fact that the omentum itself tens to migrate an envelop areas of inammation. Laparoscopy is ieal for establishing the iagnosis an excluing other etiologies. Treatment is to resect the twiste omentum, which can often be infarcte at the time of surgery, an to correct any other relate conition that may be ientie (B, C). The ning of purulent ui woul suggest another iagnosis because it is not consistent with omental torsion. The ui usually seen is serosanguinous (E).

Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase positive (E). Another ening feature of S. aureus is that it is catalase positive. The iagnosis is mae by a combination of abominal pain, evelopment of clouy peritoneal ui, an an elevate peritoneal ui white bloo cell count greater than 100/mm3. Initial treatment consists of intraperitoneal antibiotics, which seem to be more effective than IV antibiotics for a total of  weeks.

Pseuomyxoma peritonei is a rare process in which\n\nthe peritoneum becomes covere with semisoli mucus an large loculate cystic masses. There is no familial preisposition (C). A useful classication erive from a large series uses two categories: isseminate peritoneal aenomucinosis (DPAM) an peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA). DPAM is histologically a benign process an is most often ue to a rupture appenix. In one large series, appeniceal mucinous aenoma was associate with approximately 60% of patients with DPAM. In patients classie as PMCA, the origin was either a well-ifferentiate appeniceal or intestinal mucinous aenocarcinoma (B). Pseuomyxoma peritonei is most common in women age 50 to 70 years (D). It is often asymptomatic until late in its course. Symptoms are often nonspecic, but the most common symptom is increase abominal girth. Physical examination may emonstrate a istene abomen with nonshifting ullness. Management is surgical, with cytoreuction of the primary an seconary implants, incluing peritonectomy an omentectomy (A). If there is a clear origin at the appenix, a right colectomy shoul also be performe. If the origin appears to be the ovary, total abominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommene. The recurrence rate is very high (76% in one series).

C. Primary retroperitoneal abscesses are seconary to\n\nhematogenous sprea while seconary retroperitoneal abscesses are relate to an infection in an ajacent organ. The most common source of retroperitoneal abscesses is seconary, with renal infections accounting for nearly 50% of all\n\n5\n\ncases. Hematogenous sprea is not a signicant contributing factor for seconary retroperitoneal abscesses (E). Other common causes inclue retrocecal appenicitis (B), perforate uoenal ulcers, pancreatitis, an iverticulitis (A). In rare cases, patients may have Pott isease, which is a isseminate form relate to tuberculosis (D). Patients typically present with back, pelvic, ank, or thigh pain with associate fever an leukocytosis. Flank erythema may be present. Kiney infections often have gram-negative ros such as Proteus an E. coli. Treatment consists of broa-spectrum antibiotics an rainage, an ientication of the source. If the abscess is simple an unilocular, then CT-guie rainage is the treatment of choice. Operative rainage may be require for complex abscesses.\n\n8. B. Spontaneous (primary) bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is\n\nene as bacterial infection of ascitic ui in the absence of any surgically treatable intraabominal infection. Patients usually present with fever, iarrhea, an abominal pain, but if severe enough, they will also have altere mental status, hypotension, hypothermia, an a paralytic ileus. However, 13% of patients will be completely asymptomatic. Treatment is with antibiotics alone. Prophylactic antibiotics (with uoroquinolones) to prevent SBP shoul be consiere in high-risk patients with cirrhosis, ascites, an history of gastrointestinal bleeing (as in the present case). Patients with cirrhosis who have low ascitic ui protein (10 ras) exposure early in pregnancy (within the rst 4 weeks) can lea to fetal emise. However, such a high exposure excees the ose of typical imaging (abominal x-ray is 00 mra while abominal an pelvic CT is about 3–4 ras). Between 8 an 15 weeks’ gestation, high-ose (>10 ras) raiation can lea to intrauterine growth retaration an central nervous efects. Beyon 15 weeks (as in the present case), there o not appear to be any eterministic effects (ose-epenent events such as fetal loss, congenital efects) on the fetus. Stochastic effects (those that are not ose epenent), such as the subsequent risk of cancer or leukemia, are increase with exposure of 1 ra or more. The risk is about 1 cancer for every 500 exposures. Conversely, if the pregnant patient with an acute abomen progresses to peritonitis an bowel perforation, the risk of fetal emise is very high. Thus, the risk of fetal miscarriage is higher with visceral perforation than with raiation exposure, an therefore all measures shoul be taken for an accurate iagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is consiere a goo imaging option in pregnancy; however, its use in the emergent setting may be limite by its availability. Ultrasoun is also useful but woul be more useful if the patient presente with right upper quarant pain (suspecte biliary isease) or right lower quarant pain (suspecte appenicitis).\n\nCHAPtEr 1 Abdomen—General Reference: Khanelwal A, Fasih N, Kielar A.

Rectus sheath hematomas are clinically signicant\n\nbecause of the fact that they can easily be mistaken for an intraabominal inammatory process. The etiology is an injury to an epigastric artery within the rectus sheath. In most cases, there is no clear history of trauma (C). Particularly in the elerly who are taking oral anticoagulants, these typically occur spontaneously. Patients frequently escribe a suen onset of unilateral abominal pain, sometimes precee by a coughing t. In one series, 11 of 1 patients were women, an in another series, all 8 were women, with an average age in the sixth ecae. Below the arcuate line, there is no aponeurotic posterior covering to the rectus muscle. Therefore, hematomas below this line can cross the miline, causing a larger hematoma to form, an then cause bilateral lower quarant pain resembling a perforate viscus. On physical examination, a mass is often palpable. The Fothergill sign is the ning of a palpable abominal mass that remains unchange with contraction of the rectus muscles. This helps istinguish it from an intraabominal abscess, which woul not be palpable with rectus contraction. The iagnosis is best establishe with a CT scan, which will emonstrate a ui collection in the rectus muscle. The hematocrit shoul be closely monitore. Once the iagnosis is establishe, management is primarily nonoperative an consists of resuscitation, monitoring of serial hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, an reversal of anticoagulation (D). However, one shoul be cautious with reversal of anticoagulation, as stable patients may benet from continue anticoagulation (e.g., recent mechanical valve). On rare occasions, angiographic embolization may be necessary (E). Surgical management, while rarely necessary, woul involve ligation of the bleeing vessel an evacuation of the hematoma.

Desmoi tumors are unusual soft-tissue neoplasms\n\nthat arise from fascial or bro-aponeurotic tissue. They are proliferations of benign-appearing broblastic cells with abunant collagen an few mitoses (E). Desmoi tumors o not metastasize (A); however, they are locally aggressive an have a very high local recurrence rate reaching almost 50% (B). They have been associate with Garner synrome (intestinal polyposis, osteomas, bromas, an epiermal or sebaceous cysts) an familial aenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is why patients shoul be scheule for a colonoscopy soon after iagnosis. In sporaic cases, surgical trauma appears to be an important cause. Desmoi tumors may evelop within or ajacent to surgical scars. Patients with FAP have a 1000-fol increase risk of the evelopment of esmoi tumors. Desmois are more common in women of chilbearing age, ten to occur after chilbirth, an may be linke to estrogen. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have also been foun to be associate with the occurrence of these tumors, whereas antiestrogen meications may lea to shrinkage. They’ve been reporte to shrink after menopause (C).\n\n7\n\nPatients are typically in their thir or fourth ecae of life an present with pain, a mass, or both. They are classie as either extra abominal (extremities, shouler), abominal wall, or intraabominal (mesenteric an pelvic). There are no typical raiographic nings, but MRI may elineate muscle or soft-tissue inltration an is require in larger tumors to elineate anatomic relations before surgical intervention. Core neele biopsy often reveals collagen with iffuse spinle cells an abunant brous stroma, which may suggest a low-grae brosarcoma; however, the cells lack mitotic activity. An open incisional biopsy of lesions larger than 3 to 4 cm is often necessary. Wie local excision with negative margins is inicate for symptomatic esmoi tumors. Nonresectable or incientally foun, asymptomatic, intraabominal esmoi tumors (even if resectable) shoul be treate with nonsteroial antiinammatory agents (e.g., sulinac) an antiestrogens, which have met with objective response rates of 50%. In regar to ajuvant therapy, recent retrospective reviews have seen signicant reuctions in recurrence with raiation combine with surgery an even with raiation alone. More research is necessary for the use of chemotherapy agents, but it has been seen that when cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are use in inoperable esmoi tumors, there is a 0% to 40% positive response. The aggressive nature of these tumors an high rate of occurrence make esmoi tumors the secon most common cause of eath in patients with FAP, after colorectal carcinoma.

The most common sarcomas occurring in the retroperitoneum are liposarcomas, malignant brous histiocytomas, an leiomyosarcomas (C). Approximately 50% of patients will have a local recurrence an 0% to 30% will en up having istant metastases. Lymph noe metastases are rare (D). Retroperitoneal sarcomas present as large masses because they o not typically prouce symptoms until their mass effect creates compression or invasion of ajacent structures. Symptoms may inclue gastrointestinal hemorrhage, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, an lower extremity swelling. Retroperitoneal sarcomas have a worse prognosis than nonretroperitoneal sarcomas. The best chance for long-term survival is achieve with an en bloc, margin-negative resection. Tumor stage at presentation, high histologic grae, unresectability, an grossly positive resection margins are strongly associate with increase mortality rates. Tumor grae is the most signicant preictor of outcome. Complete surgical resection is the most effective treatment for primary or recurrent retroperitoneal sarcomas (A, E). Surgical cure\n\n8\n\nPArt i Patient Care\n\ncan be limite because the margins are often compromise by anatomic constraints. There is no ifference in survival between those who ha a resection with a grossly positive margin an those with inoperable tumors. Unlike extremity sarcomas, external beam raiation therapy is limite for retroperitoneal malignancies because there is a low tolerance for raiation to surrouning structures. Postoperative an intraoperative raiation therapy have been shown to reuce local recurrence, but further stuies are neee to etermine if this leas to improve survival.

The best option for repair in this patient with multiple risk factors for perioperative infection (iabetes an obesity) is laparoscopic hernia repair with mesh. Compare to open incisional hernia repair, laparoscopic repair has a lower incience of surgical site infection an is the best option for patients at risk for postoperative infection (C–D). Open an laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs with mesh have similar recurrence rate. Component separation is a technique where the anterior rectus sheath is incise  cm lateral to the semilunar line in orer to primarily close large efects while\n\nminimizing tension. This is unnecessary in this case, as the efect is only 3 cm wie, an a minimally invasive technique is more appropriate (E). Abominal wall strengthening exercises are the primary repair for rectus iastasis, which is an attenuation of the linea alba in the superior abominal wall without a true hernia. This patient has a hernia, as evience by fascial efect on physical exam (A). Reference: Guielines for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. SAGES.

Although the inci-\n\nence of parastomal hernias is higher with en ostomies than with loop ostomies, this may simply be ue to loop ostomies getting reverse more often, an sooner than en ostomies that are more often permanent. The majority of parastomal hernias are asymptomatic an o not require intervention. However, this patient is experiencing symptoms with intermittent bowel obstruction an shoul unergo repair (E). The best option for management of a symptomatic parastomal hernia is to take the ostomy own if appropriate. Unfortunately, this is not an option for this patient with a prior abominoperineal resection (APR). The next best option is repair of the hernia with synthetic mesh using the Sugarbaker technique, where intraperitoneal mesh covers the entire efect, an the bowel leaing to the ostomy enters laterally between the mesh an abominal wall. Biologic mesh is associate with higher recurrence rates compare to prosthetic mesh (D). It may be consiere for patients with signicant contamination. Primary repair of parastomal hernias has been largely abanone ue to unacceptable recurrence rates of up to 70% (A). Ostomy relocation solves the problem at han (the current symptomatic parastomal hernia); however, it is inferior to repair with mesh as there is a high risk of eveloping another parastomal hernia at the new ostomy site (B).

After vertical miline abominal incision, approx-\n\nimately 10% to 0% of patients evelop incisional hernias. Ranomize controlle trials have shown that small (5 mm) fascial bites 5 mm apart have a signicantly lower rate of eveloping incisional hernia than large (1 cm) bites 1 cm apart (A, C). Also, a suture to woun length ratio of at least 4:1 is associate with less tension an a ecrease incience of incisional hernia evelopment (D, E).

Conitions that increase intraabominal pressure\n\n(cystic brosis, chronic lung isease, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, constipation, an peritoneal ialysis) are associate with higher risk for eveloping an inguinal hernia. Patients with small asymptomatic hernias are at risk for eveloping symptoms as their hernias enlarge uring peritoneal ialysis. Therefore, everyone unergoing peritoneal ialysis shoul be examine for presence of abominal hernias preoperatively. If a hernia is foun, the patient shoul unergo concurrent herniorrhaphy at the time of peritoneal ialysis catheter placement (A–C). Hernia repair shoul be one with mesh, as mesh is associate with ecrease recurrence rates an are safe in patients unergoing peritoneal ialysis (E).

The genitofemoral nerve arises from the L1-L level.\n\nThe genital branch innervates the cremaster muscle an\n\n15\n\nsensation to the sie of the scrotum an the labia. It is responsible for the cremasteric reex. In women, it accompanies the roun ligament of the uterus. The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve is part of the cor structures. It lies on the iliopubic tract an accompanies the cremaster vessels (B). The ilioinguinal nerve lies on top of the spermatic cor (A). It innervates the internal oblique muscle an is sensory to the upper meial thigh ajacent to the genitalia. The nerve can sometimes splay out over the cor, making issection ifcult. The iliohypogastric an ilioinguinal nerves arise from the T1-L1 level an intermingle. They provie sensation to the skin of the groin, the base of the penis, an the upper meial thigh. The iliohypogastric nerve lies on the internal oblique muscle (C), provies sensory innervation from the skin overlying the pubis, an oes not intermingle with the genitofemoral nerve because they cross ifferent paths (E).

Poupart ligament is another name for the inguinal lig-\n\nament. The inguinal ligament is forme from the anteroinferior portion of the external oblique aponeurosis foling back on itself. It extens from the anterosuperior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle, turning posteriorly to form a shelving ege. The cremaster muscle bers arise from the internal oblique muscle an surroun the spermatic cor (B). The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve passes through the eep ring (C), whereas the ilioinguinal nerve passes through the supercial ring. The genital branch innervates the cremaster muscle, whereas the femoral branch controls sensation to the upper lateral thigh (D). Inirect hernias arise lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, whereas irect hernias arise meial to the inferior epigastric vessels. The lateral borer of the rectus muscle, inferior inguinal ligament, an inferior epigastric artery ene the borers of Hesselbach triangle an ene the location of a irect hernia (E).\n\n7. C. The arcuate line is locate below the umbilicus, typ-\n\nically one-thir the istance to the pubic crest (A). Between the costal margin an the arcuate line, the anterior rectus sheath is mae up of a combination of the aponeurosis of the external an internal oblique muscles. The posterior sheath is mae up of a combination of the aponeuroses of the internal oblique an transverse abominal muscles. Below the arcuate line, the anterior sheath is mae up of the aponeuroses of all three abominal muscles (E). The internal oblique aponeurosis splits above the arcuate line to envelop the rectus abominis muscle (B). There is no posterior sheath below the arcuate line (D), an the transversalis fascia therefore makes up the posterior aspect of the rectus abominis muscle.\n\n8. E. This patient has bilateral inguinal hernias, one of\n\nwhich is recurrent an shoul be offere a laparoscopic repair. The avantages of this inclue the ability to visualize both sies through a single incision an a potentially easier surgery in the setting of recurrence. It also protects the patient from eveloping a femoral hernia since the femoral canal is covere by the mesh. Of note, femoral hernias are known to evelop after open inguinal hernia repair. They evelop on average sooner than a typical recurrence, suggesting that the original hernia was in fact a femoral one an\n\n16\n\nPArt i Patient Care\n\nwas misse at the original surgery. The two laparoscopic approaches inclue TEP an TAPP. TEP involves issecting a plane in the preperitoneal space, which may actually be avantageous when compare to TAPP because intraabominal ahesions are avoie (A). This oes not hol true for prior pelvic surgery as the preperitoneal space may be obliterate in these patients, necessitating a TAPP. If the peritoneum is violate uring TEP, it is important to repair the efect to prevent ahesion formation postoperatively, but it is not manatory to convert to a ifferent technique (C). Though there are few absolute contrainications to laparoscopic hernia surgery, bowel ischemia with perforation or sepsis preclues the use of mesh, which is require in both TEP an TAPP. Tacking of the mesh in either laparoscopic approach can reuce mesh migration but shoul be avoie lateral to the epigastric vessels an inferior to the iliopubic tract to avoi placement in the “triangle of oom” or the “triangle of pain,” which contains the external iliac vessels an several nerves (lateral femoral cutaneous an femoral branch of genitofemoral, respectively) (B). Injury to these nerves is relatively specic to laparoscopic repairs (D). Reference: Fischer JE. Fischer’s mastery of surgery. Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; Chicago, IL, 01.\n\n9. C. The preferre initial approach for an uncomplicate\n\ninguinal hernia is still actively ebate within the surgical community. The LEVEL-trial specically compare TEP repair versus open mesh repair an emonstrate reuce pain in the immeiate postoperative perio an earlier return to work. However, this came at the expense of longer operating room times an higher intraoperative complication rates (B, D). This seems to be consistent with the results of a New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) stuy from 004 comparing open mesh repair to all methos of laparoscopic mesh repair. However, they iverge on reporte recurrence rates, with the NEJM stuy favoring open repair (recurrence of 4% versus 10.1%) while the LEVEL-Trial showe equivalent recurrence rates (3.0% for open an 3.8% for TEP) (E). The LEVEL-Trial also inicate an equivalent prevalence of chronic pain, which was not one of the outcomes in the NEJM article (A). References: Langevel HR, van’t Riet M, Weiema WF, et al.

Severe groin pain eveloping in the recovery room\n\nfollowing laparoscopic hernia repair is most likely ue to a stapling/tacking injury to a nerve. If this complication is suspecte, the patient shoul return to the operating room to remove the offening tack. Acute groin pain is most likely from injury to the ilioinguinal nerve. However, the most commonly injure nerve uring laparoscopic hernia repair is the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (provies sensation to the lateral thigh). Injecting the groin with local anesthetic may not relieve the pain an if it works, it will only be a temporary measure (E). Meical therapy is not appropriate if the suspecte etiology is irritation of the nerve seconary to stapling/tacking (B–D). Chronic groin pain may occur in 10% to 5% of patients 1 year after surgery. The etiology is\n\nthought to be entrapment of the nerve uring surgery or postoperative scarring. Chronic groin pain is best worke up with MRI. If conservative management oes not resolve the pain, operative exploration an ivision of the nerve(s) have met with success. The ieal approach in the setting of hernia reoperation after open repair is to enter a space in which the tissue planes have not been violate. The preferre management is a laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy, which allows a single stage approach to access the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, an genitofemoral nerves.\n\n11. D. Ischemic orchitis is thought to evelop as a result of\n\nthrombosis of veins of the pampiniform plexus, leaing to testicular venous congestion. It has thus been terme congestive orchitis. The precise etiology of ischemic orchitis is unclear. The most commonly ientie risk factor is extensive issection of the spermatic cor. This occurs particularly when a patient has a large hernia sac, an the entire istal sac is issecte an excise. As such, it is recommene that the sac instea is ivie an the istal sac left in situ. In aition, the cor shoul never be issecte past the pubic tubercle. The presentation is that of a swollen, tener testicle, usually  to 5 ays after surgery. The testicle is often high riing. This may eventually progress to testicular atrophy. Scrotal uplex ultrasonography has been shown to be useful in evaluating the perfusion of the testicle after hernia repair. However, it oes not change the management of ischemic orchitis. Management is expectant. In the past, attempts to reexplore the groin were unertaken to try to loosen the inguinal ring, but this was not successful (A). The bloo supply to the testicle is via the testicular artery, but there are rich collaterals incluing the external spermatic artery an the artery to the vas. Thus, inavertent ligation of the testicular artery oes not typically lea to this complication (C). Preexisting testicular pathology (B) or anomalous bloo supply (E) to the testicle is not thought to contribute to ischemic orchitis following inguinal hernia repair. However, ischemic orchitis can occur more frequently in recurrent inguinal hernia surgery using the anterior approach; thus, the laparoscopic approach shoul be consiere for recurrent hernias.

The vast majority of inguinal hernias in chilren are\n\nthe inirect type ue to a persistent patent processus vaginalis. Approximately 1% to 5% of chilren can evelop an inguinal hernia. However, the incience increases in preterm infants an those with a low birth weight. Right-sie hernias are more common, an 10% of hernias iagnose at birth are bilateral. Incarceration is a more serious problem in peiatric patients than in aults. Emergent operation on an infant with an incarcerate hernia can be very challenging. Thus, it is preferable to try to reuce the hernia, which is successful in 75% to 80% of cases, allow the inammation to subsie over several ays, an then perform the repair semielectively. The routine use of contralateral groin exploration is not wiely supporte (D). For elective cases, one option is to perform laparoscopy via the hernia sac to look for a contralateral hernia an, if foun, procee to repair. If there are any signs of strangulation (e.g., leukocytosis, fever, elevate lactate), then manual reuction shoul be avoie, an the patient shoul be taken immeiately to the operating room for surgical intervention (E). In the patient escribe, though the skin is erythematous, there are no signs of systemic toxicity. Methos to achieve reuction inclue the use of intravenous (IV) seation, Trenelenburg positioning, ice packs, an gentle irect pressure. Reuction without subsequent surgery is not appropriate. That being sai, infants with anemia an history of prematurity are at signicantly increase risk of postoperative apnea an woul require overnight monitoring. Reference: Özemir T, Arıkan, A. Postoperative apnea after inguinal hernia repair in formerly premature infants: impacts of gestational age, postconceptional age an comorbiities. Pediatr Surg Int. 013;9(8):801–804.\n\n14. D. In chilren, umbilical hernias are congenital. They\n\nare forme by a failure of the umbilical ring to close, causing a central efect in the linea alba. Most umbilical hernias in chilren are small an will close by  years of age, particularly if the efect is less than 1 cm in size. As such, repair is not always inicate at the time of iagnosis (B). Aitionally, the ecision to perform an elective repair is not solely etermine by the presence of symptoms (E). If closure oes not occur by age 4 or 5 years, elective repair is then consiere a reasonable option (C), even if the patient is asymptomatic. If the hernia efect is large (> cm) or the family is bothere by the cosmetic appearance, repair shoul be consiere. Although umbilical hernias in chilren can incarcerate, this is very rare (A). If the chil presents with abominal pain, bilious emesis, an a tener, har mass protruing from the umbilicus, immeiate exploration an hernia repair are inicate.\n\n15. D. Unlike in chilren, umbilical hernias in aults are\n\nusually acquire (A). Risk factors are any conitions that increase intraabominal pressure, such as pregnancy, obesity, an ascites. Overall strangulation of umbilical hernias in aults is uncommon, but it occurs more often than in chilren (C). Small, barely palpable an asymptomatic hernias can be followe clinically. Larger or symptomatic hernias shoul be repaire. In patients with cirrhosis an ascites, the markely increase pressure causes the skin overlying the hernia to become thin an eventually ischemic. One of the most catastrophic complications in this setting is rupture of\n\n17\n\nthe hernia through the ischemic skin, leaing to peritonitis an eath. Thus, patients with cirrhosis an ascites shoul unergo repair if there is evience that the skin overlying the hernia is thinning or becoming ischemic (B). However, repair shoul be elaye until after meical management of the ascites. If meical management fails an the skin over the hernia is thinne an tense, then a transjugular portosystemic shunt shoul be consiere before repair. Alternatively, if the patient is a caniate for liver transplant, the hernia can be repaire uring the transplantation. Umbilical hernias have historically all been repaire by primary closure. Borrowing from the low recurrence rates using mesh for inguinal hernias, umbilical hernias are now more frequently being repaire using mesh, particularly those with large efects. A recent prospective, ranomize stuy compare primary closure with mesh repair. The early complication rates such as seroma, hematoma, an woun infection were similar in the two groups. However, the hernia recurrence rate was signicantly higher after primary suture repair (11%) than after mesh repair (1%) (E). Some authors are now avocating for the routine use of mesh for all ault umbilical hernias in the absence of bowel strangulation.

Femoral hernias occur more commonly in females\n\nan have a high risk of incarceration. However, the most common overall hernia in females is an inirect inguinal hernia (A). Bowel entering a femoral hernia passes own a narrow femoral canal. This is because the femoral ring, which serves as the entrance for the femoral canal, is very rigi an unyieling. Thus, the xe neck of a femoral hernia is prone to pinching off the bowel, putting the patient at risk for incarceration. The borers of the femoral canal are as follows: inguinal ligament (anterior) (B), Cooper ligament (posterior), femoral vein (lateral), an Poupart ligament (meial). Femoral hernias occur most commonly lateral to the lymphatics an meial to the femoral vein, within the empty space (C). It is important to recognize that femoral hernias pass eep (posterior) to the inguinal ligament. As such, repairs to the inguinal ligament (such as a Bassini operation an stanar mesh repair) will not obliterate the efect (E). The femoral hernia can be xe either through a stanar inguinal approach or irectly over the bulge using an infrainguinal incision. The essential elements of femoral hernia repair inclue issection an removal of the hernia sac an obliteration of the efect in the femoral canal. This can be accomplishe by either approximation of the iliopubic tract to the Cooper ligament or by placement of prosthetic mesh. Reference: e Virgilio C, Frank PN, Grigorian A, es.

Diastasis recti is cause by increase separation of the rectus abominis muscles an a relative thinning of the linea alba, which can mimic a hernia. The\n\n18\n\nPArt i Patient Care\n\nconition can be acquire, such as in multiparous women where the repeate stretching of the abominal wall causes the rectus muscles to separate, or congenital, seconary to more lateral attachment of the rectus muscles at birth. Classically, patients present after recent weight loss because this allows for the lesion to be visible. There is no risk for strangulation in iastasis recti because all of the facial layers are intact (A, D). Though several methos of surgical repair have been escribe, these are mainly cosmetic. In general, all that is require is reassurance an abominal wall exercises to help strengthen the musculature—though complete resolution in aults is unlikely (C). In contrast, epigastric hernias are true hernias an represent a true efect in the linea alba. They are generally small an contain either preperitoneal fat or part of the falciform ligament (E). They arise from efects in the fascia in locations where neurovascular bunles\n\nperforate through. Though small, they can cause signicant pain because of compression of the nerves traveling through the efect. There is some evience to suggest that iastasis rectus may increase the risk for evelopment of an epigastric hernia an will make primary repair of epigastric hernias more challenging. Of note, patients with iastasis recti are at increase risk of abominal aortic aneurysms. References: Brunicari FC, Anersen DK, Schwartz SI. Schwartz’s principles of surgery. 10th e.

Bile consists of water, bile salts, phospholipis, an cholesterol B. Primary bile acis (cholic & chenoeoxycholic acis) become seconary bile acis when ehyroxylate by gut bacteria (lithocholate an eoxycholate acis) C. Mechanism of bile concentration in the gallblaer: active transport of NaCl into gallblaer mucosal cells, passive absorption of water II. Cholecystitis, Choleocholithiasis, an Cholangitis A. Acute calculous cholecystitis: gallblaer inammation ue to gallstone impacte in the neck; management is NPO, IV antibiotics, resuscitation, laparoscopic cholecystectomy B. Acute acalculous cholecystitis: usually seen in critically ill patients in the ICU; US emonstrates gallblaer wall thickening, pericholecystic ui, with no stones; HIDA if US is equivocal, tx is IV antibiotics, resuscitation, an percutaneous cholecystostomy tube if critically ill versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy if stable for surgery C. Choleocholithiasis: may have obstructive jaunice; elevate irect bilirubin, may have transaminitis; US emonstrates gallstones, ilate CBD, +/− stone in the CBD (sensitivity only 50%); tx is ERCP followe up by laparoscopic cholecystectomy 1. If intraoperative cholangiogram is positive for choleocholithiasis: rst attempt to ush the stone with saline; if it oesn’t work try ushing after giving 1 mg IV glucagon (relaxes sphincter of Oi); if stones on’t clear, options inclue: a) Postoperative ERCP b) Transcystic CBD exploration—best for small stones, large cystic uct, or small CBD; generally preferre over transuctal CBD exploration because it avois a CBD incision c) Transuctal CBD exploration—best for large stones (>8–10 mm), large CBD, proximal stones (above cystic uct), choleochotomy mae anterior to avoi vasculature laterally D. Acute ascening cholangitis: Charcot tria (RUQ pain, fever, jaunice) presents in about 0%; Reynols penta as hypotension an confusion; RUQ US: +/− gallstones, ilate CBD, elevate irect BR; tx is IV antibiotics, ui resuscitation, pressors if in septic shock, followe by ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) tube placement after resuscitation; laparoscopic cholecystectomy uring same amission if ue to gallstones E.
