The recent publication of randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up data offers the opportunity to reevaluate this treatment modality and its role in the management of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Randomized controlled trials have confirmed the ability of TIF to eliminate troublesome GERD symptoms, heal esophagitis, and improve distal esophageal acid exposure in appropriately selected patient populations. These studies establish TIF's superiority to conventional medical therapy, especially in clinical scenarios where proton-pump inhibitors fail to provide complete symptom relief across the spectrum of classic and atypical GERD manifestations, including regurgitation and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Long-term data indicate sustained positive outcomes and durability up to 6 years after procedure. These results were achieved with a low rate of serious adverse events and usually without introducing troublesome dysphagia, gas bloat, or flatulence. Based on the most recent data, TIF appears to be a valuable treatment alternative for the management of appropriately selected patients with moderate to severe chronic GERD symptoms.\n\nThe Spectrum of Surgical Remediation of Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication-Related Failures.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuri, Ruchir; Smith, C Daniel; Bowers, Steven P\n\n2018-05-16\n\nTo evaluate outcomes of surgical remediation for symptomatic or anatomic failure after a transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF). This retrospective study was performed on 11 patients who underwent a remedial operation following TIF failure between June 2011 and September 2016 at the Mayo Clinic in Florida for persistent foregut symptoms. Upper gastrointestinal workup characterized 1 patient as having normal post-TIF anatomy and 10 as having anatomic failure. Ambulatory pH testing was performed in 7 patients and was abnormal in all. All patients underwent a laparoscopic takedown of the prior endoscopic fundoplication and removal of all accessible polypropylene T-fasteners. All patients had esophageal salvage and have not required a reoperation. Anatomical findings included hiatal hernia (7), esophageal diverticulum (2), hiatal mesh erosion of esophagus (1), long-segment esophageal stricture (1), and normal anatomy (1). Remedial operations included laparoscopic explant of fasteners in all patients with conversion to fundoplication (7), resection/imbrication of esophageal diverticulum (2), Heller myotomy (1), and mesh explant and complex esophageal repair (1). Mean operative time was 177 minutes and median length of stay 3 days (range 2-13 days). At mean follow-up of 10.7 months (range 1-42 months), 7 patients had persistent complaints. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was repeated in these 7 patients and was normal (nâ=â3), mild stenosis requiring dilation (nâ=â2), Los Angeles grade B esophagitis (nâ=â1), and Barrett's esophagus (nâ=â1). Anatomic distortion of the distal esophagus after TIF can be significant, making subsequent operations complex. After remedial surgery, few patients will continue to have troublesome symptoms such as dysphagia.\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease: Techniques and outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nTestoni, Pier Alberto; Mazzoleni, Giorgia; Testoni, Sabrina Gloria Giulia\n\n2016-05-06\n\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disorder that results primarily from the loss of an effective antireflux barrier, which forms a mechanical obstacle to the retrograde movement of gastric content. GERD can be currently treated by medical therapy, surgical or endoscopic transoral intervention. Medical therapy is the most common approach, though concerns have been increasingly raised in recent years about the potential side effects of continuous long-term medication, drug intolerance or unresponsiveness, and the need for high dosages for long periods to treat symptoms or prevent recurrences. Surgery too may in some cases have consequences such as long-lasting dysphagia, flatulence, inability to belch or vomit, diarrhea, or functional dyspepsia related to delayed gastric emptying.

Incomplete control of troublesome regurgitation and extraesophageal manifestations of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a known limitation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. This multicenter randomized study compared the efficacy of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) against PPIs in controlling these symptoms in patients with small hiatal hernias. Methods. Between June and August 2012, 63 patients were randomized at 7 US community hospitals. Patients in the PPI group were placed on maximum standard dose (MSD). Patients in the TIF group underwent esophagogastric fundoplication using the EsophyX2 device. Primary outcome was elimination of daily troublesome regurgitation or extraesophageal symptoms. Secondary outcomes were normalization of esophageal acid exposure (EAE), PPI usage and healing of esophagitis. Results. Of 63 randomized patients (40 TIF and 23 PPI), 3 were lost to follow-up leaving 39 TIF and 21 PPI patients for analysis. At 6-month follow-up, troublesome regurgitation was eliminated in 97% of TIF patients versus 50% of PPI patients, relative risk (RR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.11 (P = .006). Globally, 62% of TIF patients experienced elimination of regurgitation and extraesophageal symptoms versus 5% of PPI patients, RR = 12.9, 95% CI = 1.9-88.9 (P = .009). EAE was normalized in 54% of TIF patients (off PPIs) versus 52% of PPI patients (on MSD), RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6-1.7 (P = .914). Ninety percent of TIF patients were off PPIs. Conclusion. At 6-month follow-up, TIF was more effective than MSD PPI therapy in eliminating troublesome regurgitation and extraesophageal symptoms of GERD.

Many endoluminal treatments for GERD have been developed with little success. Currently, transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) attempts to recreate a surgical fundoplication through placement of full-thickness polypropylene H-fasteners. This, the most recent procedure to gain FDA approval, has shown some promise in the early data. However, questions of its safety profile, efficacy, and durability remain. The Cochrane Library and MEDLINE through PubMed were searched to identify published studies reporting on subjective and objective GERD indices after TIF. The search was limited to human studies published in English from 2006 up to March 2012. Data collected included GERD-HRQL and RSI scores, PPI discontinuation and patient satisfaction rates, pH study metrics, complications, and treatment failures. Statistical analysis was performed with weighted t tests. Titles and abstracts of 214 papers were initially reviewed. Fifteen studies were found to be eligible, reporting on over 550 procedures. Both GERD-HRQL scores (21.9 vs. 5.9, pÂ <Â 0.0001) and RSI scores (24.5 vs. 5.4, pÂ â¤Â 0.0001) were significantly reduced after TIF. Overall patient satisfaction was 72Â %. The overall rate of PPI discontinuation was 67Â % across all studies, with a mean follow-up of 8.3Â months. pH metrics were not consistently normalized. The major complication rate was 3.2Â % and the failure rate was 7.2Â % across all studies. TIF appears to provide symptomatic relief with reasonable levels of patient satisfaction at short-term follow-up. A well-designed prospective clinical trial is needed to assess the effectiveness and durability of TIF as well as to identify the patient population that will benefit from this procedure.\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 2.0) with EsophyX for gastroesophageal reflux disease: long-term results and findings affecting outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nTestoni, Pier Alberto; Vailati, Cristian; Testoni, Sabrina; Corsetti, Maura\n\n2012-05-01\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) with the EsophyX(â¢) device is reported to be effective for creating a continent gastroesophageal valve and for good functional results, as measured by pH impedance in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The aim of this study is to assess the long-term effect of TIF in patients with symptomatic GERD. TIF 2.0 fundoplication was done in 42 consecutive patients. All were studied with GERD-HRQL and GERD-QUAL questionnaires, upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24 h pH impedance before and at 6, 12, and 24 months after TIF. In all, 35 patients completed 6-month follow-up; 21 (60.0%) completely stopped proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, 6 (17.1%) more than halved it, and 8 (22.9%) continued with the same dose as before the procedure. There were 26 patients with complete 24-month follow-up; 11 (42.3%) completely stopped PPI therapy, 7 (26.9%) more than halved it, and 8 (30.8%) were taking the same dose as before the procedure. Hiatal hernia and ineffective esophageal motility seemed to raise the risk of recurrence of symptoms (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). The number of fasteners deployed during TIF was the only factor predictive of successful outcome (p = 0.018). TIF using the EsophyX device allowed withdrawal or reduction of PPI in about 77% of patients at 6-month follow-up and about 69% at 24 months. Larger number of fasteners deployed during TIF was predictive of positive outcome; pre-TIF ineffective esophageal motility and hiatal hernia raised the risk of recurrence of GERD symptoms, but were not significant from a prospective point of view.\n\nEfficacy of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) for the treatment of GERD: a systematic review with meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Xiaoquan; Chen, Shiyao; Zhao, Hetong; Zeng, Xiaoqing; Lian, Jingjing; Tseng, Yujen; Chen, Jie\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe efficacy of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) performed with the EsophyX device (Redmond, Washington, USA) and its long-term outcomes in gastresophageal reflux disease (GERD) are debated. We, therefore, performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of studies evaluating the role of TIF in GERD. A systematic search of EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library Central was performed. All original studies reporting outcomes in GERD patients who underwent TIF were identified. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of TIF, and prospective observational studies reporting outcomes after TIF were included. A total of 18 studies (963 patients) published between 2007 and 2015 were identified, including five RCTs and 13 prospective observational studies. The pooled relative risk of response rate to TIF versus PPIs/sham was 2.44 (95Â % CI 1.25-4.79, pÂ =Â 0.0009) in RCTs in the intention-to-treat analysis. The total number of refluxes was reduced after TIF compared with the PPIs/sham group. The esophageal acid exposure time and acid reflux episodes after TIF were not significantly improved. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) usage increased with time and most of the patients resumed PPIs treatment at reduced dosage during the long-term follow-up. The total satisfaction rate after TIF was about 69.15Â % in 6Â months. The incidence of severe adverse events consisting of gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding was 2.4Â %. TIF is an alternative intervention in controlling GERD-related symptoms with comparable short-term patient satisfaction. Long-term results showed decreased efficacy with time. Patients often resume PPIs at reduced doses in the near future.\n\nRandomized controlled trial of transoral incisionless fundoplication vs. proton pump inhibitors for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nWitteman, Bart P L; Conchillo, Jose M; Rinsma, Nicolaas F; Betzel, Bark; Peeters, Andrea; Koek, Ger H; Stassen, Laurents P S; Bouvy, Nicole D\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) was developed in an attempt to create a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure that mimics antireflux surgery. The objective of this trial was to evaluate effectiveness of TIF compared with proton pump inhibition in a population consisting of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients controlled with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) who opted for an endoscopic intervention over lifelong drug dependence. Patients with chronic GERD were randomized (2:1) for TIF or continuation of PPI therapy. American Society of Anesthesiologists >2, body mass index >35âkg/m(2), hiatal hernia >2âcm, and esophageal motility disorders were exclusion criteria. Primary outcome measure was GERD-related quality of life. Secondary outcome measures were esophageal acid exposure, number of reflux episodes, PPI usage, appearance of the gastroesophageal valve, and healing of reflux esophagitis. Crossover for the PPI group was allowed after 6 months. A total of 60 patients (TIF n=40, PPI n=20, mean body mass index 26âkg/m(2), 37 male) were included. At 6 months, GERD symptoms were more improved in the TIF group compared with the PPI group (P<0.001), with a similar improvement of distal esophageal acid exposure (P=0.228) compared with baseline. The pH normalization for TIF group and PPI group was 50% and 63%, respectively. All patients allocated for PPI treatment opted for crossover. At 12 months, quality of life remained improved after TIF compared with baseline (P<0.05), but no improvement in esophageal acid exposure compared with baseline was found (P=0.171) and normalization of pH was accomplished in only 29% in conjunction with deteriorated valve appearances at endoscopy and resumption of PPIs in 61%. Although TIF resulted in an improved GERD-related quality of life and produced a short-term improvement of the antireflux barrier in a selected group of GERD patients, no long-term objective reflux control was achieved.\n\nClinical and pH-metric outcomes of transoral esophagogastric fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBell, Reginald C W; Freeman, Katherine D\n\n2011-06-01\n\nTransoral treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) using the EsophyX device enables creation of an esophagogastric fundoplication with potential for better control of reflux than gastrogastric techniques. Efficacy and safety of a rotational/longitudinal esophagogastric transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) was evaluated retrospectively using subjective and objective outcomes. Thirty-seven consecutive patients on antisecretory medication and with proven gastroesophageal reflux and limited hiatal hernia underwent TIF for persistent GERD symptoms. Five patients were reoperations for failed laparoscopic fundoplication. Of the 37 treated patients, 57% were female. The median age was 58 (range=20-81) years and BMI was 25.5 (range=15.9-36.1) kg/m2. Sixty-eight percent indicated GERD-associated cough, asthma, or aspiration as a primary complaint and 32% complained of heartburn or regurgitation. The TIF procedures created tight wraps of 230Â°-330Â° extending 3-4 cm above the Z-line. Two complications occurred: one mediastinal abscess treated laparoscopically and one postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion. At 6 (range=3-14) months median follow-up TIF resulted in a significant improvement of both atypical and typical symptoms in 64% and 70-80% of patients, respectively, as indicated by the corresponding GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) and reflux symptom index (RSI) score reduction by 50% or more compared to baseline on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). No patient reported problems with dysphagia, bloating, or excess flatulence, and 82% were not taking any PPIs. Reflux characteristics were significantly improved and normalized in 61, 89, and 56% of patients in terms of acid exposure, number of refluxates, and DeMeester scores, respectively. TIF was effective in treating GERD in 75% of patients among whom 54% were in a complete \"remission\" and 21% were \"improved.\" The remaining 25% were considered failures, and five (13.5%) patients underwent\n\nMultimedia manuscript. Heller myotomy and intraluminal fundoplication: a NOTES technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerretta, Silvana; Dallemagne, Bernard; Allemann, Pierre; Alleman, Pierre; Marescaux, Jacques\n\n2010-11-01\n\nIt is generally accepted that the most effective treatment of achalasia is a surgical myotomy. Nevertheless, if a myotomy alone is performed, reflux may occur in up to 30% of patients. The aim of this study was to explore a transoral incisionless stepwise approach to both esophageal Heller myotomy and fundoplication. The first step consisted of creating the esophageal myotomy. Under general anesthesia, with the pig supine, endoscopy was performed to assess the location of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). The mucosa on the right posterolateral esophageal wall was cut with the needle-knife 15 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and then dilated with blunt dissection to introduce the scope. A submucosal tunnel was created distally with CO(2) and blunt dissection. Once the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and the clasp fibers were identified, the muscular layer was cut. The scope was withdrawn into the lumen and the mucosal flap was sealed with endoscopic clips. The adequacy of the myotomy was evaluated using pre- and postoperative manometry and by comparing the EGJ distensibility before, during, and after the division of the esophageal muscular fibers using the functional lumen imaging probe, EndoFLIPÂ®. The second step, consisted of building a transoral incisionless fundoplication 4 weeks postoperatively using the EsophyXâ¢. Both Heller myotomy and endoscopic fundoplication were accomplished successfully with no injury to the esophageal mucosa. Postoperative manometry demonstrated a 50% loss in mean LES pressure (mean preoperative LES pressure = 22.2 mmHg; mean postoperative LES pressure = 10 mmHg, P < 0.005). The EndoFLIPÂ® showed a preoperative minimal diameter of 6 mm with a cross-sectional area of 28 mm(2). Postoperatively, the junction was more compliant (minimal diameter = 15 mm; cross-sectional area = 177 mm(2)), with the main improvement in distensibility occurring when the clasps fibers were removed.

We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the relative efficacies of TIF vs LNF in patients with GERD. We searched publication databases and conference abstracts through May 10, 2017 for randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of TIF or LNF with that of a sham procedure or PPIs in patients with GERD. We performed a network meta-analysis using Bayesian methods under random-effects multiple treatment comparisons. We assessed ranking probability by surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Our search identified 7 trials comprising 1128 patients. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking indicated TIF had highest probability of increasing patients' health-related quality of life (0.96), followed by LNF (0.66), a sham procedure (0.35), and PPIs (0.042). LNF had the highest probability of increasing percent time at pH <4 (0.99), followed by PPIs (0.64), TIF (0.32), and the sham procedure (0.05). LNF also had the highest probability of increasing LES pressure (0.78), followed by TIF (0.72) and PPIs (0.01). Patients who underwent the sham procedure had the highest probability for persistent esophagitis (0.74), followed by those receiving TIF (0.69), LNF (0.38), and PPIs (0.19). Meta-regression showed a shorter follow-up time as a significant confounder for the outcome of health-related quality of life in studies of TIF. In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of trials of patients with GERD, we found LNF to have the greatest ability to improve physiologic parameters of GERD, including increased LES pressure and decreased percent time pH <4.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the TIF procedure in patients with a history of esophagitis or proven chronic GERD who have achieved symptom control with the administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) but did not wish to continue receiving medications for life. Forty-five patients with typical GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain) and a history of esophagitis grade A and B or proven GERD by esophageal pH monitoring underwent TIF using Esophyx. Patients with eosphagitis C and D or those with large hiatal hernias (>2Â cm in length) were excluded. The primary clinical effectiveness measure was GERD symptom elimination at follow up based on normalization of the GERD health related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire. After a median follow up period of 59Â months (36-75) the median GERD-HRQL scores improved significantly from 27 (2-45) at baseline to 4 (0-26) (Pâ<â0.001) in the 44 patients completing the study. Heartburn was eliminated in 12 out of the 21 patients included (57.1%), regurgitation was eliminated in 15 out of the 17 patients included (88.2%) and finally chest pain was eliminated in 5 patients out of the six patients included (83.3%). Overall, 32 patients out of the 44 patients (72.7%) that completed the study follow up reported elimination of their main symptom, without the need for PPI administration (none PPI usage). Furthermore, six more patients (13.6%), five with heartburn, and one with regurgitation reported half PPI dose taken for <50% of the preceding follow up period (occasional PPI usage), while six more patients (four with heartburn, one with regurgitation, and one with chest pain) reported full or half PPI dose taken\n\nLong-term efficacy of transoral incisionless fundoplication with Esophyx (Tif 2.0) and factors affecting outcomes in GERD patients followed for up to 6Â years: a prospective single-center study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTestoni, Pier Alberto; Testoni, Sabrina; Mazzoleni, Giorgia; Vailati, Cristian; Passaretti, Sandro\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) with the EsophyXâ¢ device creates an antireflux valve with good functional results in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of TIF 2.0 on pathological reflux and symptoms in GERD patients with daily dependence on proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Fifty patients underwent TIF. All underwent GERD-HRQL and GERD-QUAL questionnaires, upper GI endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-h pH-impedance before and 6, 12, and 24 months after TIF, and subsequent yearly clinical re-evaluation. Patients were followed for up to six years (mean 52.7 Â± 19.7 months). In all, 83.7, 79.6, 87.8, and 84.4% of patients stopped or halved the PPI therapy 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after TIF. Three-year figure remained stable up to 6 years. Symptom scores off PPI were significantly lower at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. At 6 months, Hill's grade I of the newly created valve persisted in all pre-procedure Hill's grade I patients, in 66.7% of grade II and 58.3% of grade III. This figure remained substantially unchanged at 12 and 24 months, too. Impedance monitoring indicated significantly fewer total and acid refluxes after treatment (p = 0.01). Factors predicting good outcomes were pre-procedure Hill's grade I-II, no hiatal hernia or hernia â¤2 cm (p = 0.03), absence of ineffective esophageal motility (p < 0.0001), and number of fasteners deployed (p = 0.01). TIF by the EsophyX achieved lasting elimination of daily dependence on PPI in 75-80% of patients for up to 6 years.

Following the 6-month evaluation, all patients in the PPI group elected for crossover to TIF; therefore, all 63 patients underwent TIF 2.0 with EsophyX 2 device. Primary outcome was elimination of daily troublesome regurgitation and atypical symptoms at the 5-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptom scores, PPI use, reoperations, and patient health satisfaction. The cost-effectiveness of TIF 2.0 was also estimated. Of 63 patients, 60 were available at 1 year, 52 at 3 years, and 44 at 5 years for evaluation. Troublesome regurgitation was eliminated in 88% of patients at 1 year, 90% at 3 years, and 86% at 5 years. Resolution of troublesome atypical symptoms was achieved in 82% of patients at 1 year, 88% at 3 years, and 80% at 5 years. No serious adverse events occurred. There were 3 reoperations by the end of the 5-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up, 34% of patients were on daily PPI therapy as compared with 100% of patients at screening. The total GERD Health-related quality-of-life score improved by decreasing from 22.2 to 6.8 at 5 years ( P < .001). In this patient population, the TIF 2.0 procedure provided safe and sustained long-term elimination of troublesome GERD symptoms.\n\nProton pump inhibitor-refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: challenges and solutions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMermelstein, Joseph; Chait Mermelstein, Alanna; Chait, Maxwell M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA significant percentage of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will not respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The causes of PPI-refractory GERD are numerous and diverse, and include adherence, persistent acid, functional disorders, nonacid reflux, and PPI bioavailability. The evaluation should start with a symptom assessment and may progress to imaging, endoscopy, and monitoring of esophageal pH, impedance, and bilirubin. There are a variety of pharmacologic and procedural interventions that should be selected based on the underlying mechanism of PPI failure. Pharmacologic treatments can include antacids, prokinetics, alginates, bile acid binders, reflux inhibitors, and antidepressants. Procedural options include laparoscopic fundoplication and LINX as well as endoscopic procedures, such as transoral incisionless fundoplication and Stretta. Several alternative and complementary treatments of possible benefit also exist.

We sought to estimate the cost effectiveness of medical, endoscopic, and operative treatments for adults with GERD who require daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. A Markov model was generated from the payer's perspective using a 6-month cycle and 30-year time horizon. The base-case patient was a 45-year-old man with symptomatic GERD taking 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily. Four treatment strategies were analyzed: PPI therapy, transoral incisionless fundoplication (EsophyX), radiofrequency energy application to the lower esophageal sphincter (Stretta) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The model parameters were selected using the published literature and institutional billing data. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained) for each therapy. In the base case analysis, which assumed a PPI cost of $234 over 6 months ($39 per month), Stretta and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication were the most cost-effective options over a 30-year time period ($2,470.66 and $5,579.28 per QALY gained, respectively). If the cost of PPI therapy exceeded $90.63 per month over 30 years, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication became the dominant treatment option. EsophyX was dominated by laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication at all points in time. Low-cost PPIs, Stretta, and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication all represent cost-effective treatment strategies. In this model, when PPIs exceed $90 per month, medical therapy is no longer cost effective. Procedural GERD therapy should be considered for patients who require high-dose or expensive PPIs.

However, partial fundoplication may be a viable alternative. Here, we conducted a nationwide survey of partial fundoplication in Korea. The Korean Anti-Reflux Surgery study group recorded 32 cases of partial fundoplication at eight hospitals between September 2009 and January 2016. The surgical outcomes and postoperative adverse symptoms in these cases were evaluated and compared with 86 cases of total fundoplication. Anterior partial fundoplication was performed in 20 cases (62.5%) and posterior in 12 (37.5%). In most cases, partial fundoplication was a secondary procedure after operations for other conditions. Half of patients who underwent partial fundoplication had typical symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis, and most of them showed excellent (68.8%), good (25.0%), or fair (6.3%) symptom resolution at discharge. Compared to total fundoplication, partial fundoplication showed no difference in the resolution rate of typical and atypical symptoms. However, adverse symptoms such as dysphagia, difficult belching, gas bloating and flatulence were less common after partial fundoplication. Although antireflux surgery is not popular in Korea and total fundoplication is the primary surgical choice for gastroesophageal reflux disease, partial fundoplication may be useful in certain conditions because it has less postoperative adverse symptoms but similar efficacy to total fundoplication.\n\nIncisionless otoplasty: a reliable and replicable technique for the correction of prominauris.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehta, Shaun; Gantous, Andres\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study evaluates the postoperative outcomes achieved with incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris. To determine whether incisionless otoplasty is a reliable and replicable technique in correcting prominauris. This study consisted of a retrospective electronic medical record review for 72 patients undergoing incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris by a single surgeon from November 2006 to April 2013. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 87 months. The patients were operated on at both St Joseph's Health Centre (a community hospital) and The Cumberland Clinic (private practice) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All patients undergoing an incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris were eligible. Participants' ages ranged from 3 to 55 years, with the majority being adults. Seventy patients were followed up for outcomes. Incisionless otoplasty. Number and type of sutures used, perioperative complications, and postoperative follow-up including complications and revisions. Complications included infection, hematoma, bleeding, perichondritis, suture granuloma, suture exposure, and suture failure. A mean (SD) 2.5 (0.8) sutures were used in the left ear, 2.48 (0.75) in the right ear, and 4.69 (1.75) in total. The number of sutures used in the left vs right ear was not significantly different (Pâ=â.60). All patients had horizontal mattress sutures placed for correction of prominauris. There were no serious perioperative complications such as infection, bleeding, hematoma, perichondritis, or cartilage necrosis. Follow-up data were extracted and analyzed in 70 patients, with a mean follow-up time of 31 months. Complications were seen in 10 patients (14%): 4 were due to suture failure, 3 were due to suture exposure, 2 were due to granuloma formation, and 1 was due to a Polysporin (bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate) reaction. Nine patients (13%) needed a revision to achieve a desirable result.

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of SILS Nissen fundoplication and compare its outcomes with traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication between January 2009 and September 2010. Results: There were 15 SILS and 18 traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures performed. The mean operative time was 129 and 182 minutes in the traditional laparoscopic and single-incision groups, respectively (P = .019). There were no conversions in the traditional laparoscopic group, whereas 6 of the 15 patients in the SILS group required conversion by insertion of 2 to 4 additional ports (P = .0004). At short-term follow-up, recurrence rates were similar between both groups. To date, there have been no reoperations. Conclusions: SILS Nissen fundoplication is both safe and feasible. Short-term outcomes are comparable with standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Challenges related to the single-incision Nissen fundoplication include overcoming the lengthy learning curve and decreasing the need for additional trocars.

In this prospective study, 60 patients with prominent ears were included in the study. In Group 1, 55 ears of 30 patients (25 bilateral and 5 unilateral) were operated with Haytoglu et al.'s modification of incisionless otoplasty technique. In Group 2, 57 ears of 30 patients (27 bilateral and 3 unilateral) were operated with Fritsch's incisionless otoplasty technique. For comparison of two methods, auriculocephalic distances were measured at three levels which were level 1 (the most superior point of the auricle), level 2 (the midpoint of the auricle) and level 3 (level of the lobule) pre-operatively (preop); and measurements were repeated at the end of the surgery (PO(0-day)), 1st month (PO(1-Mo)) and 6th month (PO(6-Mo)) after the surgery, in both groups. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). Moreover, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) was rated by an independent, non-participating plastic surgeon at 6 months after the surgery. Operation time was 15.9Â±5.6min in Group 1 (Haytoglu et al.'s) and 19Â±4.7min in Group 2 (Fritsch). Hematoma, infection, bleeding, keloid scar formation, sharp edges or irregularities of the cartilage were not observed in any group. Suture extrusion was detected in 14.03% of Group 1 and 16.1% of Group 2. No statistically significant difference was observed between auriculocephalic distances at levels 1-3 of groups at preop, PO(0-day), PO(1-Mo) and PO(6-Mo) separately. Similarly, difference in auriculocephalic distances (preop values-PO(6-Mo) values) was not detected as statistically significant in Groups 1 and 2 at three levels. In both techniques, No statistically significant difference was observed in patient satisfaction at 6th months after the operation which was\n\nTransoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF 2.0): A Meta-Analysis of Three Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nGerson, Lauren; Stouch, Bruce; LobonÅ£iu, Adrian\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe TIF procedure has emerged as an endoscopic treatment for patients with refractory gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Previous systematic reviews of the TIF procedure conflated findings from studies with modalities that do not reflect the current 2.0 procedure technique or refined data-backed patient selection criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted using data only from randomized studies that assessed the TIF 2.0 procedure compared to a control. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy and long-term outcomes associated with performance of the TIF 2.0 procedure in patients with chronic long-term refractory GERD on optimized PPI therapy, including esophageal pH, PPI utilization and quality of life. Methods: Three prospective research questions were predicated on the outcomes of the TIF procedure compared to patients who received PPI therapy or sham, concomitant treatment for GERD, and the patient-reported quality of life. Event rates were calculated using the random effect model. Since the time of follow-up post-TIF procedure was variable, analysis was performed to incorporate the time of follow-up for each individual patient at the 3-year time point. Results: Results from this meta-analysis, including data from 233 patients, demonstrated that TIF subjects at 3 years had improved esophageal pH, a decrease in PPI utilization, and improved quality of life. Conclusions: In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), the TIF procedure data for patients with GERD refractory to PPI's produces significant changes, compared with sham or PPI therapy, in esophageal pH, decreased PPI utilization, and improved quality of life.

The development of transoral endoscopic thyroid surgery however provides an approach which is truly minimally invasive, as it conceals the incision within the oral cavity without significantly increasing the amount of required dissection. The transoral endoscopic approach however presents multiple technical challenges, which could be overcome with the incorporation of a robotic operating system. This manuscript summarizes the literature on the feasibility and current clinical experience with transoral robotic thyroid surgery.

A total of 49 patients with prominent ears were operated with incisionless otoplasty. In Group 1, 44 ears of 24 patients were operated with incisionless otoplasty without cartilage scoring. In Group 2, 46 ears of 25 patients were operated with incisionless otoplasty with cartilage scoring. For comparison, auriculocephalic distances were measured at three different levels: preoperatively, at the end of surgery, and at 1th and 6th month post-operatively. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). The global esthetic improvement scale (GAIS) was applied by an independent, non-participating plastic surgeon at 6 months after surgery. Prior to surgery and at the end of surgery, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of auriculocephalic distances at the three levels. At the and 6th month after surgery, auriculocephalic distances were significantly higher in Group 1. There were no significant differences in VAS results and GAIS values between the groups. The recurrence rate was 9.1% in Group 1 and 4.3% in Group 2. The suture extrusion rate was 18.2% in Group 1 and 13% in Group 2. Although there was a significant difference of 1-2 mm in auriculocephalic distances, our study showed that cartilage scoring is not mandatory to correct the prominent ear in pediatric patients with soft cartilages and to achieve patient and surgeon satisfaction.\n\nTransoral robotic supraglottic partial laryngectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKayhan, Fatma TÃ¼lin; Kaya, Kamil Hakan; Altintas, Ahmet; Sayin, Ibrahim\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTransoral robotic supraglottic laryngectomy is a new surgical way to perform endolaryngeal resection of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this report was to present our initial experience about transoral robotic supraglottic laryngectomy for early supraglottic cancer. Subjects with early squamous cell carcinoma (T1-T2) of supraglottic region who managed using transoral robotic surgery in a tertiary referral center were included in the study. The technique of robot-assisted resection, intraoperative blood loss, mean robotic operating time, pathologic margin status, postoperative extubation, need for a tracheotomy, and length of hospitalization, complications, duration of oral nutrition, and neck dissection and radiotherapy needs were evaluated. Thirteen subjects (12 men, 1 woman) with T1-T2 supraglottic carcinoma were successfully operated on with transoral robotic surgery. In all subjects, negative margins were obtained. The mean total robotic surgery time was 31.6 (SD, 16.2) minutes (range, 20-80 minutes). Mean total blood loss was less than 40 mL. Subjects started oral nutrition with a mean of 10.8 (SD, 8.9) days (range, 4-30 days) postoperatively. The mean hospitalization was 15.4 (SD, 10.4) days (range, 7-42 days). Transoral robotic supraglottic laryngectomy with the da Vinci robotic system can be regarded as a feasible, safe, and effective technique. Although short-term results seem discouraging, long-term results are needed to evaluate the oncologic safety.\n\nRandomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Giaccone, Claudio; Farinella, Eleonora; Campaci, Roberto; Morino, Mario\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo compare in a prospective, randomized trial the long-term results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus floppy-Nissen for achalasia. Anterior fundoplication is usually performed after Heller myotomy to control GER; however, the incidence of postoperative GER ranges between 10% and 30%. Total fundoplication may aid in reducing GER rates. From December 1993 to September 2002, 153 patients with achalasia underwent Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus antireflux fundoplication. Of these, 9 were excluded from the study. The remaining 144 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus anterior fundoplication (Dor procedure) or Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus total fundoplication (floppy-Nissen procedure). The primary end point was incidence of clinical and instrumental GER after a minimum of 60 months follow-up. The secondary end point was recurrence of dysphagia. Follow-up clinical assessments were performed at 1, 3, 12, and 60 months using a modified DeMeester Symptom Scoring System (MDSS). Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring were performed at 3, 12, and 60 months postoperative. Of the 144 patients originally included in the study, 138 were available for long-term analysis: 71 (51%) underwent antireflux fundoplication plus a Dor procedure (H + D group) and 67 (49%) antireflux fundoplication plus a Nissen procedure (H + N group). No mortality was observed. The mean follow-up period was 125 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical (5.6% vs. 0%) or instrumental GER (2.8% vs. 0%) were found between the 2 groups; however, a statistically significant difference in dysphagia rates was noted (2.8% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Although both techniques achieved long-term GER control, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication. This evidence supports the use of Dor fundoplication as the\n\nEffectiveness of Nissen fundoplication versus anterior and posterior partial fundoplications for treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a systematic review protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarshall-Webb, Matthew; Peters, Micah D J; Bright, Tim; Watson, David I\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe objective of this review is to determine the relative effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication compared to anterior and posterior partial fundoplication in controlling the symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and reducing their side effect profile in adults.The specific questions posed by this review are: what is the effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication in comparison to anterior partial fundoplication (90 degree, 120 degree and 180 degree) and posterior 270 degree fundoplication in terms of symptom control of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and what are the side effects of these surgical interventions?\n\nFundoplication\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... with feeds.

Recent studies have questioned the necessity of a fundoplication, especially when a limited hiatal dissection (LHD) is performed and the angle of His is preserved. This is a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data. All patients underwent primary Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 30-month period. In select patients, an LHD was performed anteriorly. Symptomatic outcomes were assessed up to 2 years postoperation using the Achalasia Severity Questionnaire (ASQ), Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL). A total of 31 patients underwent Heller myotomy during the study interval. The majority of patients underwent Heller myotomy with full hiatal dissection (FHD) (21, 68%). Intraoperative mucosal perforations occurred in 3 (14%) patients undergoing FHD. Patient demographics, surgery details, and baseline symptomatic outcomes did not differ significantly preoperatively. At greater than 1 year postoperation, there was no significant difference between the groups for ASQ, GERD-HRQL, and GIGLI (Pâ=â.76, .78, and .33, respectively). Heller myotomy with LHD and no fundoplication and Heller myotomy with FHD and partial fundoplication result in similar GERD-related quality of life outcomes. Further studies (including pH studies) are necessary to determine if fundoplication is a necessary step in selected patients in whom an LHD is possible.\n\nTransoral robotic surgery vs transoral laser microsurgery for resection of supraglottic cancer: a pilot surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnsarin, Mohssen; Zorzi, Stefano; Massaro, Maria Angela; Tagliabue, Marta; Proh, Michele; Giugliano, Gioacchino; Calabrese, Luca; Chiesa, Fausto\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTransoral laser microsurgery (TLM) is a mature approach to supraglottic cancer, while transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is emerging. The present study compared these approaches. The first 10 patients (2002-2005) given TLM were compared with the first 10 (2007-2011) given TORS for cT1-3 cN0-cN2c supraglottic cancer. A feeding tube was used in four TLM and seven TORS patients. Margins were more often positive, but operating times shorter, in TORS. All 10 TORS patients are without evidence of disease, but only six TLM patients remain disease-free after much longer follow-up. TORS was considerably less uncomfortable and fatiguing for the surgeon. TORS seems as safe and effective as TLM. Shorter TORS operating times are probably attributable to prior experience with TLM. For laryngeal exposure, length of tube placement and margin evaluability, TLM was superior; however, this may change as TORS develops and transoral robotic instruments are optimized.

Redo fundoplication improves patient symptoms, but its impact on patient quality of life remains unclear. We hypothesized that laparoscopic redo fundoplication improves disease-specific and global quality of life in patients with recurrent symptoms following failed laparoscopic or open fundoplication. Data for all patients undergoing a redo fundoplication between August 2009 and June 2014 were collected prospectively. Reflux symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptom Scale (GERSS), the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL), and the global quality of life Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires obtained at 4Â weeks and 16Â months post-operatively. Forty-six patients underwent laparoscopic redo fundoplication during the study period for symptomatic hernia (nÂ =Â 11), GERD (nÂ =Â 18), or dysphagia (nÂ =Â 17). GERSS improved from 41 at baseline to 9 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001), and GERD-HRQL scores improved from 30 at baseline to 7 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001). Median dysphagia scores decreased from 4.5 to 1 (pÂ =Â 0.035). SF-36 scores demonstrated a significant improvement in general health (pÂ =Â 0.016) and emotional well-being (pÂ =Â 0.036) and a trend toward improved physical function (pÂ =Â 0.068) in the post-operative period, but these improvements were not statistically significant at longer-term follow-up. Overall, 82% of patients reported satisfaction with their operation, and 96% reported that they would have the operation performed again given the benefit of hindsight. While associated with long operative times and significant complications, laparoscopic redo fundoplication produces a durable improvement in reflux symptoms and disease-specific quality of life. These procedures also improve global quality of life in the short term and are associated with high patient\n\nPatterns of reoperation after failed fundoplication: an analysis of 9462 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nObeid, Nabeel R; Altieri, Maria S; Yang, Jie; Park, Jihye; Price, Kristie; Bates, Andrew; Pryor, Aurora D\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLittle is known about the choice of reoperation after failed fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Both redo fundoplication and conversion procedure to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are safe and effective. We aimed to characterize the rates of different revisional procedures and to identify risk factors associated with failed fundoplication. Using a statewide database, we examined records for patients who underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2010. The primary outcomes were the rate of each type of reoperation and the pattern of subsequent procedures. Demographics and comorbidities were used in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with reoperation after fundoplication. A total of 9462 patients were included. Overall, 430 (4.5%) patients underwent reoperation. Of those, 46 (10.7%) patients underwent RYGB at first reoperation, with the remainder having a redo fundoplication. An additional five patients were converted to RYGB after undergoing a redo fundoplication (51 total patients converted to RYGB at any point, 11.9%). Eighty-three percent of patients converted to RYGB were obese, as opposed to 8% for redo fundoplication. A single redo fundoplication was done in 81% of patients, while 35 patients (8.1%) underwent two or more revisional procedures. On average, any reoperation was performed 2.9Â years after fundoplication, with redo fundoplication 2.5Â years and RYGB 6.5Â years later. Age 30-49Â years (vs.Â >70Â years; OR 2.01, pÂ =Â 0.011) and 50-69Â years (vs. >70Â years; OR 1.61, pÂ =Â 0.011), female gender (OR 1.56, pÂ =Â <Â 0.0001), and chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.40, pÂ =Â 0.0044) were associated with revisional surgery. Fundoplication has a low reoperation rate within a mean 8.3Â years of follow-up. Redo fundoplication is more commonly performed and at an earlier point than conversion to RYGB. Younger age, female gender, and chronic pulmonary disease are associated with reoperation after\n\nTransoral robotic resection of selected parapharyngeal space tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nArshad, Hassan; Durmus, Kasim; Ozer, Enver\n\n2013-05-01\n\nCurrently, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with the daVinci robot is mainly used for squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and supraglottic larynx. The safety, efficacy, and functional outcomes regarding this approach have previously been described. In addition to transoral resection of squamous cell carcinoma, we have found use for this technique in removing selected tumors of the parapharyngeal space. Three patients with benign or malignant tumors of the parapharyngeal space who underwent successful transoral resection using the daVinci robot were included in the study. In all three cases, complete tumor excision was achieved without any complication. None required conversion to an open procedure. Mean TORS operative time and intraoperative blood loss were 16.3 min and 4.7 mL, respectively. Inadequate oral exposure, involvement of the internal carotid artery, limited cervical spine mobility and large tumor size are the main limitations of this approach. Result indicates that magnified view, 3D visualization with the combination of the transoral robotic experience, allow en bloc resection of selected parapharyngeal space tumors located medial to the carotid sheath.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy and Fundoplication: What Is the Evidence?\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Allaix, Marco E; Schlottmann, Francisco; Patti, Marco G; Morino, Mario\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThere is no agreement about the best type of fundoplication to add in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia to reduce the risk of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux. This article reviews the current evidence about the outcomes in achalasia patients undergoing LHM with a partial anterior, a partial posterior, or a total fundoplication. We performed a review of the literature in PubMed/Medline electronic databases, which was evaluated according to the GRADE system. The results of the published randomized controlled trials show with a high level of evidence that the addition of a fundoplication reduces the risk of postoperative abnormal reflux, without impairing the food emptying of the esophagus. LHM with partial fundoplication is considered in most centers worldwide the standard of care for the treatment of patients with achalasia. The current evidence fails to show any significant difference between partial anterior and posterior fundoplication. In the absence of further large randomized controlled trial, the decision of performing an anterior or a posterior wrap is based on the surgeon's experience and preference. The addition of a partial fundoplication to LHM leads to a significantly lower rate of postoperative pathological reflux without impairing the esophageal emptying.\n\nFinancial outcomes of transoral robotic surgery: A narrative review.\n\nPubMed\n\nOthman, Sammy; McKinnon, Brian J\n\n2018-04-03\n\nTo determine the current cost impact and financial outcomes of transoral robotic surgery in Otolaryngology. A narrative review of the literature with a defined search strategy using Pubmed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Using keywords ENT or otolaryngology, cost or economic, transoral robotic surgery or TORs, searches were performed in Pubmed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science and reviewed by the authors for inclusion and analysis. Six total papers were deemed appropriate for analysis. All addressed cost impact of transoral robotic surgery (TORs) as compared to open surgical methods in treating oropharyngeal cancer and/or the identification of the primary tumor within unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma. Results showed TORs to be cost-effective. Transoral robotic surgery is currently largely cost effective for both treatment and diagnostic procedures. However, further studies are needed to qualify long-term data. Copyright Â© 2018.

In the presence of preoperative dysphagia and oesophageal dysmotility, this procedure has engendered concern in certain regards. METHODS This paper describes a consecutive series of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) patients with a high frequency of dysmotility. Patients were selected for surgery with 24-hour dual channel pH monitoring, oesophageal manometry and standardised reflux scintigraphy. RESULTS Following careful patient selection, 33 patients underwent fundoplication by laparoscopy. Surgery had high efficacy in symptom control and there was no adverse dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS Evidence of proximal reflux can select a group of patients for good results of fundoplication for atypical symptoms.\n\nTransoral treatment strategies for head and neck tumors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArens, Christoph\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe introduction of transoral endoscopic surgery has initiated a fundamental change in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The endoscopic approach minimizes the intraoperative trauma. Due to the lower burden for the patient and the savings potential these methods have gained wide acceptance. These transoral accesses routes allow experienced surgeons to reduce the morbidity of surgical resection with no deterioration of oncologic results. This suggests a further extension of the indication spectrum and a high growth potential for these techniques and equipment in the coming years. For selected patients with selected tumors the minimally invasive transoral surgery offers improved oncological and functional results. In the present paper, different surgical access routes are presented and their indications discussed. PMID:23320057\n\n[Transoral laser resection for head and neck cancers].\n\nPubMed\n\nHartl, Dana\n\n2007-12-01\n\nTransoral laser surgery has become a therapeutic option and even a standard for certain tumors of the larynx and pharynx. The postoperative course after this type of minimally invasive surgery has been shown to be significantly simpler, with less need for temporary tracheotomy and enteral feeding. For selected tumors amenable to this approach, the oncologic results have been shown to be equivalent to those obtained by classic external approaches. Transoral laser surgery requires specific equipment and training of the surgeon, the anaesthesiologist, the operating room team and the pathologist. Despite this specificity, but because of the simplified postoperative course, transoral laser surgery has already supplanted several external approaches and will in the future probably replace other techniques, as experience with the technique increases and the indications evolve.\n\nFundoplication after heller myotomy: a retrospective comparison between nissen and dor.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nQuality of life and antireflux medication use following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Zervos, E; Gonzalez, R; Albrink, M; Rosemurgy, A\n\n1998-06-01\n\nWith the advent of minimally invasive techniques, the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease has received renewed interest. The efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in eliminating reflux has been documented. This study was undertaken to determine changes in quality of life and cost of antireflux medications after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between 1992 and 1997 completed questionnaires assessing changes in pre- and postoperative cost and number of antireflux medications, reflux symptoms, and quality of life. The average number of antireflux medications was significantly reduced (1.8 versus 0.3, P < 0.0001) as was the average monthly cost ($170 versus $30, P < 0.0001). Patients reported significant (P < 0.05) symptomatic improvement in postprandial heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, postprandial nausea, postprandial vomiting, dysphagia, and gas/bloating. Patients in this series noted fewer symptoms and used fewer antireflux medications at less cost after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Symptoms commonly thought of as complications of fundoplication (vomiting, dysphagia, gas/bloating) were less common after fundoplication. This report documents the efficacy of laparoscopic fundoplication in improving quality of life and reducing use and cost of antireflux medications.\n\nFundoplication After Heller Myotomy: A Retrospective Comparison Between Nissen and Dor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: A retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia.

PMID:25610181\n\nDoes concomitant anterior fundoplication promote dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy?\n\nPubMed\n\nTapper, Donovan; Morton, Connor; Kraemer, Emily; Villadolid, Desiree; Ross, Sharona B; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2008-07-01\n\nConcerns for gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia justify considerations of concomitant anterior fundoplication. This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Notably, relative to patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test) and to less frequent and severe dysphagia and choking (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia. Concomitant anterior fundoplication decreases the frequency and severity of heartburn and dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Concomitant anterior fundoplication promotes salutary relief in the frequency and severity of symptoms after myotomy and is warranted.\n\nPyogenic spondylodiscitis after transoral surgery for oropharyngeal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonda, Keigo; Asato, Ryo; Tsuji, Jun; Kanda, Tomoko; Watanabe, Yoshiki; Mori, Yusuke; Tsujimura, Takashi\n\n2013-06-01\n\nWe report the case of a patient with pyogenic spondylodiscitis after transoral surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. The patient was a 66-year-old man with a history of hepatic cell carcinoma, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis. The tumor was resected via a transoral approach with concurrent bilateral elective neck dissections. Although the initial postoperative course was uneventful, the patient experienced severe cervical pain because of which he revisited the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with pyogenic spondylodiscitis, according to the results of magnetic resonance imaging. Continuous treatment with parenteral antibiotics and a cervical brace was required for 2 months before all his symptoms and signs diminished. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pyogenic spondylodiscitis as a complication of transoral resection for head and neck cancer. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Ming-Tian; He, Ya-Zhou; Deng, Xiang-Bing; Zhang, Yuan-Chuan; Yang, Ting-Han; Jin, Cheng-Wu; Hu, Bing; Wang, Zi-Qiang\n\n2013-11-21\n\nTo compare the outcome of acid reflux prevention by Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia. Electronic database PubMed, Ovid (Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, EmBase and Ovid MEDLINE) and Cochrane Library were searched between January 1995 and September 2012. Bibliographic citation management software (EndNote X3) was used for extracted literature management. Quality assessment of random controlled studies (RCTs) and non-RCTs was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.1.0 and a modification of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. The data were analyzed using Review Manager (Version 5.1), and sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting each study. Finally, 6 studies, including a total of 523 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with other types of fundoplication after LHM (Dor-other group), and 8 studies, including a total of 528 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with no fundoplication after LHM (Dor-no group). Dor fundoplication was associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate of clinical regurgitation and pathological acid reflux compared with the other fundoplication group (OR = 7.16, 95%CI: 1.25-40.93, P = 0.03, and OR = 3.79, 95%CI: 1.23-11.72, P = 0.02, respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences between Dor fundoplication and no fundoplication in all subjects. Other outcomes, including complications, dysphagia, postoperative physiologic testing, and operation-related data displayed no significant differences in the two comparison groups. Dor fundoplication is not the optimum procedure after LHM for achalasia. We suggest more attention should be paid on quality of life among different fundoplications.\n\nManagement of Laryngoceles by Transoral Robotic Approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nKayhan, Fatma TÃ¼lin; GÃ¼neÅ, SelÃ§uk; KoÃ§, Arzu Karaman; YiÄider, AyÅe Pelin; Kaya, Kamil Hakan\n\n2016-06-01\n\nLaryngoceles are air-filled sacs which communicate with the laryngeal lumen. When filled with mucus or pus, they are called laryngomucoceles and laryngopyoceles, respectively. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a new and remarkable technique that expands its usefullness in otorhinolaryngology. Conventional treatments for laryngoceles were previously performed using external approaches, with aesthetically unfavorable and less function-sparing results. Transoral laser microsurgical approaches for laryngoceles were seldom reported. It is aimed to present authors' clinical experience on laryngocele management with TORS which is a rather new technique. A retrospective patient serial. Patients were evaluated for demographic data, type of lesion, reasons for hospital admittance, complaint duration, and previous surgery. Robotic surgery panel including anesthesia time, duration of surgery, need for tracheotomy, postoperative care, follow-up, and recurrence rates were also summarized. Six men (mean age 51.7 years; range 41-62) with laryngoceles underwent successful TORS. Dyspnea and hoarseness were the main complaints. Two patients had undergone previous laryngeal surgery due to laryngeal cancer, with no recurrence of malignancy at admittance for laryngocele. Three had simple laryngocele, 2 had laryngomucocele, and 1 had laryngopyocele. No laryngoceles recurred and no complication such as dysphonia or prolonged dysphagia occurred. Transoral robotic surgery was found superior in safety, technical feasibility and curative effectiveness, when compared with classical methods, especially due to absence of skin incisions. Surgical modalities for laryngocele excision should be directed toward a curative target including cosmetic and functional success, technical achievability, and surgically curative methods. Transoral robotic surgery provided all these features.\n\nThe learning curve of laparoendoscopic single-Site (LESS) fundoplication: definable, short, and safe.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, Sharona B; Choung, Edward; Teta, Anthony F; Colibao, Lotiffa; Luberice, Kenneth; Paul, Harold; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease was undertaken to determine the \"learning curve\" for implementing LESS fundoplication. One hundred patients, 38% men, with a median age of 61 years and median body mass index of 26 kg/m(2) , underwent LESS fundoplications. The operative times, placement of additional trocars, conversions to \"open\" operations, and complications were compared among patient quartiles to establish a learning curve. Median data are reported. The median operative times and complications did not differ among 25-patient cohorts. Additional trocars were placed in 27% of patients, 67% of whom were in the first 25-patient cohort. Patients undergoing LESS fundoplication had a dramatic relief in the frequency and severity of all symptoms of reflux across all cohorts equally (P < .05), particularly for heartburn and regurgitation, without causing dysphagia. LESS fundoplication ameliorates symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease without apparent scarring. Notably, few operations required additional trocars after the first 25-patient cohort. Patient selection became more inclusive (eg, more \"redo\" fundoplications) with increasing experience, whereas operative times and complications remained relatively unchanged. The learning curve of LESS fundoplication is definable, short, and safe. We believe that patients will seek LESS fundoplication because of the efficacy and superior cosmetic outcomes; surgeons will need to meet this demand.\n\nEndoscope-Assisted Transoral Fixation of Mandibular Condyle Fractures: Submandibular Versus Transoral Endoscopic Approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nHwang, Na-Hyun; Lee, Yoon-Hwan; You, Hi-Jin; Yoon, Eul-Sik; Kim, Deok-Woo\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIn recent years, endoscope-assisted transoral approach for condylar fracture treatment has attracted much attention. However, the surgical approach is technically challenging: the procedure requires specialized instruments and the surgeons experience a steep learning curve. During the transoral endoscopic (TE) approach several instruments are positioned through a narrow oral incision making endoscope maneuvering very difficult. For this reason, the authors changed the entry port of the endoscope from transoral to submandibular area through a small stab incision. The aim of this study is to assess the advantage of using the submandibular endoscopic intraoral approach (SEI).The SEI approach requires intraoral incision for fracture reduction and fixation, and 4âmm size submandibular stab incision for endoscope and traction wires. Fifteen patients with condyle neck and subcondyle fractures were operated under the submandibular approach and 15 patients with the same diagnosis were operated under the standard TE approach.The SEI approach allowed clear visualization of the posterior margin of the ramus and condyle, and the visual axis was parallel to the condyle ramus unit. The TE approach clearly shows the anterior margin of the condyle and the sigmoid notch. The surgical time of the SEI group was 128 minutes and the TE group was 120âminutes (Pâ>0.05). All patients in the TE endoscope group were fixated with the trocar system, but only 2 lower neck fracture patients in the SEI group required a trocar. The other 13 subcondyle fractures were fixated with an angulated screw driver (Pâ<0.05). There were no differences in complication and surgical outcomes.The submandibular endoscopic approach has an advantage of having more space with good visualization, and facilitated the use of an angulated screw driver.\n\nLaparoscopic calibrated total vs partial fundoplication following Heller myotomy for oesophageal achalasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMartino, Natale Di; Brillantino, Antonio; Monaco, Luigi; Marano, Luigi; Schettino, Michele; Porfidia, Raffaele; Izzo, Giuseppe; Cosenza, Angelo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAIM: To compare the mid-term outcomes of laparoscopic calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication with Dor fundoplication performed after Heller myotomy for oesophageal achalasia. METHODS: Fifty-six patients (26 men, 30 women; mean age 42.8 Â± 14.7 years) presenting for minimally invasive surgery for oesophageal achalasia, were enrolled. All patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy followed by a 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in 30 cases (group 1) and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in 26 (group 2). Intraoperative endoscopy and manometry were used to calibrate the myotomy and fundoplication. A 6-mo follow-up period with symptomatic evaluation and barium swallow was undertaken. One and two years after surgery, the patients underwent symptom questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 h oesophago-gastric pH monitoring. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, no significant difference in the median symptom score was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.66; Mann-Whitney U-test). The median percentage time with oesophageal pH < 4 was significantly higher in the Dor group compared to the Nissen-Rossetti group (2; range 0.8-10 vs 0.35; range 0-2) (P < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney U-test). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic Dor and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication achieved similar results in the resolution of dysphagia. Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication seems to be more effective in suppressing oesophageal acid exposure. PMID:21876635\n\nReoperative fundoplications are effective treatment for dysphagia and recurrent gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander S; Arnaoutakis, Dean J; Thometz, Donald P; Binitie, Odion; Giarelli, Natalie B; Bloomston, Mark; Goldin, Steve G; Albrink, Michael H\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWith wide application of antireflux surgery, reoperations for failed fundoplications are increasingly seen. This study was undertaken to document outcomes after reoperative fundoplications. Sixty-four patients, 26 men and 38 women, of average age 55 years+/-15.6 (SD), underwent reoperative antireflux surgery between 1992 and 2003. Fundoplication prior to reoperation had been undertaken via celiotomy in 27 and laparoscopically in 37. Both before and after reoperative antireflux surgery, patients scored their reflux and dysphagia on a Likert Scale (0 = none, 10 = continuous). Reoperation was undertaken because of dysphagia in 16 per cent, recurrent reflux in 52 per cent (median DeMeester Score 52), or both in 27 per cent. Failure leading to reoperation was due to hiatal failure in 28 per cent, wrap failure in 19 per cent, both in 33 per cent, and slipped Nissen fundoplication in 20 per cent. Laparoscopic reoperations were completed in 49 of 54 patients (91%); 15 had reoperations undertaken via celiotomy. Eighty-eight per cent of reoperations were Nissen fundoplications. With reoperation, Dysphagia Scores improved from 9.5+/-0.7 to 2.6+/-2.8, and Reflux Scores improved from 9.1+/-1.4 to 1.8+/-2.7. Seventy-nine per cent of patients with reflux prior to reoperation, 100 per cent with dysphagia, and 74 per cent with both noted excellent or good outcomes after reoperation. We conclude that failure after fundoplication occurs. Reoperations reduce the severity of dysphagia and reflux, thus salvaging excellent and good outcomes in most. Laparoscopic reoperations are generally possible. Reoperative fundoplications are effective treatment for dysphagia and recurrent gastroesophageal reflux, and their application is encouraged.\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarry, Linda; Ross, Sharona; Dahal, Sujat; Morton, Connor; Okpaleke, Chinyere; Rosas, Melissa; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2011-06-01\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is beginning to include advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious\n\nModified trans-oral approach with an inferiorly based flap.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Holou, Wajd N; Park, Paul; Wang, Anthony C; Than, Khoi D; Marentette, Lawrence J\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe trans-oral approach allows direct access to pathologies of the anterior craniocervical junction. However, the classic midline incision of the posterior pharyngeal wall can be surgically burdensome and limits lateral exposure. We reviewed the medical records of nine patients undergoing the trans-oral approach. The sites of the pathology ranged from the clivus to C2, and surgical exposure ranged from the clivus to C3. Each operation utilized an inferiorly based flap. None of the patients experienced vascular or neurologic complications, and no patient had a cerebrospinal fluid fistula, pseudomeningocele, or meningitis postoperatively. The trans-oral approach with an inferiorly based flap can therefore be safely and effectively performed with minimal oropharyngeal and neurologic morbidity. Not only does a U-shaped flap allow adequate exposure from the lower half of the clivus to C3, a flap improves lateral exposure, provides a clear operating field, and allows superficial mucosal closure not directly overlying the operative field.

In our service, a laparoscopic fundoplication is performed as a 2-cm floppy 360 degrees wrap with division of the short gastric vessels and the fundoplication is sutured using a prolene 2/0 mattress suture (Ethicon, USA) and buttressed laterally with two teflon pledgets (PTFE 1.85 mm; low porosity, Bard, USA). We report a patient with post-operative dysphagia due to an esophagogastric fistula caused by erosion of a teflon pledget. This is the first such case in 734 laparoscopic fundoplications performed between January 1991 and December 1998. Reoperation was required, resulting in a prolonged convalescence. A review of current literature has not revealed any similar cases. Causes for this rare complication are postulated.\n\nComparison of endoscopic transnasal and transoral approaches to the craniovertebral junction.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeker, Askin; Inoue, Kohei; Osawa, Shigeyuki; Akakin, Akin; Kilic, Turker; Rhoton, Albert L\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe study compared the endoscopic anatomy of the transnasal and transoral approaches to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). Structures examined and compared with both the straight and angled telescopes in 10 cadaveric specimens included the pharyngeal walls and adjacent musculature, resected anterior arch of the axis and odontoid, cruciform, axial, and apical ligaments, clival and dural openings, and the intradural exposure. There is considerable overlap at the pharyngeal level in the structures that can be viewed by the transoral and transnasal routes. The transoral approach provides a wider corridor with less restricted manipulation of instruments than the transnasal approach, but the transnasal approach provides a better view of the clivus, upper part of the CVJ, and the structures posterior to the removed odontoid and anterior arch of C1. Combining the two approaches provides significantly better access to the midline anterior CVJ than either approach alone, allows the scopes to be advanced in one cavity and the surgical instruments in the other cavity, and reduces the need to split the palate, tongue, or mandible in order to reach the target area. The transnasal approach also allows access to the superior part of the occipital condyles, paraclival areas, and hypoglossal canals without removal of the condyles, but these structures can be exposed by the transoral route only after at least partial removal of the condyles. The endoscopic transoral and transnasal approaches to the CVJ should be viewed as complementary routes as opposed to strict alternatives. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The use of Teflon pledgets in Nissen fundoplications by our unit has been associated with a number of complications that has led to a change of technique in performing these operations. We reviewed our database of all patients who had fundoplications that involved the use of pledgets and identified those who had represented with postoperative complications related to pledget erosion/migration. We identified 11 patients to date from a total of 1,175 fundoplications who had symptomatic pledget erosion occurring between 2 and 85 months after surgery (mean time 33.3 months). Symptoms included dysphagia, recurrent symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, and melaena, and in some cases significant morbidity was associated with the erosion. No common factor predisposing these patients to pledget erosion was identified. In the majority of cases removal of the pledget was associated with resolution of the symptoms. A review of the literature does not reveal any similar studies but problems associated with the erosion and migration of Teflon prostheses are described. The use of Teflon pledgets in fundoplication is associated with a small but significant risk of complications that has led to our unit abandoning this technique.\n\nRobotic and endoscopic transoral thyroidectomy: feasibility and description of the technique in the cadaveric model.\n\nPubMed\n\nKahramangil, Bora; Mohsin, Khuzema; Alzahrani, Hassan; Bu Ali, Daniah; Tausif, Syed; Kang, Sang-Wook; Kandil, Emad; Berber, Eren\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNumerous new approaches have been described over the years to improve the cosmetic outcomes of thyroid surgery. Transoral approach is a new technique that aims to achieve superior cosmetic outcomes by concealing the incision in the oral cavity. Transoral thyroidectomy through vestibular approach was performed in two institutions on cadaveric models. Procedure was performed endoscopically in one institution, while the robotic technique was utilized at the other. Transoral thyroidectomy was successfully performed at both institutions with robotic and endoscopic techniques. All vital structures were identified and preserved. Transoral thyroidectomy has been performed in animal and cadaveric models, as well as in some clinical studies. Our initial experience indicates the feasibility of this approach. More clinical studies are required to elucidate its full utility.\n\nAdvances in circular stapling technique for gastric bypass: transoral placement of the anvil.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, Ninh T; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Smith, Brian R; Reavis, Kevin M; Wilson, Samuel E\n\n2008-05-01\n\nIn Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, construction of the gastrojejunostomy is commonly performed using a circular stapler. The initial description for placement of the anvil was via the transoral approach. Although the concept was ingenious, technical difficulty was encountered during passage resulting in complications such as hypopharyngeal perforation and esophageal mucosal injury. As a result, most surgeons subsequently changed their route of anvil placement to the transabdominal approach. Advances in stapler technology now allow the head of the anvil to be pre-tilted, permitting transoral introduction with greater ease and safety. This paper describes this improved method for transoral placement of the anvil during laparoscopic gastric bypass and reoperative bariatric surgery.\n\nRobotic and endoscopic transoral thyroidectomy: feasibility and description of the technique in the cadaveric model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKahramangil, Bora; Mohsin, Khuzema; Alzahrani, Hassan; Bu Ali, Daniah; Tausif, Syed; Kang, Sang-Wook; Kandil, Emad\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Numerous new approaches have been described over the years to improve the cosmetic outcomes of thyroid surgery. Transoral approach is a new technique that aims to achieve superior cosmetic outcomes by concealing the incision in the oral cavity. Methods Transoral thyroidectomy through vestibular approach was performed in two institutions on cadaveric models. Procedure was performed endoscopically in one institution, while the robotic technique was utilized at the other. Results Transoral thyroidectomy was successfully performed at both institutions with robotic and endoscopic techniques. All vital structures were identified and preserved. Conclusions Transoral thyroidectomy has been performed in animal and cadaveric models, as well as in some clinical studies. Our initial experience indicates the feasibility of this approach. More clinical studies are required to elucidate its full utility.

In general surgery, the laparoscopic treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux is the second most frequently performed robot-assisted procedure after cholecystectomy. A review of the literature and an analysis of the costs may allow a preliminary evaluation of the pros and cons of robotic fundoplication, which may then be applicable to other general surgery procedures. Eleven articles report 91 cases of robotic fundoplication (75 Nissen, 9 Thal, 7 Toupet). To date, there is no evidence of benefit in terms of duration of surgery, rate of complications and hospital stay. Moreover, robotic fundoplication is more expensive than the traditional laparoscopic approach (the additional cost per procedure due to robotics is 1,882.97 euros). Only further technological upgrades and advances will make the use of robotics competitive in general surgery. The development of multi-functional instruments and of tactile feedback at the console, enlargement of the three-dimensional laparoscopic view and specific \"team\" training will enable the use of robotic surgery to be extended to increasingly difficult procedures and to non-specialised environments.\n\nInfection rate after transoral approach for the upper cervical spine.\n\nPubMed\n\nShousha, Mootaz; Mosafer, Azim; Boehm, Heinrich\n\n2014-09-01\n\nA retrospective review of prospectively collected databases of 139 consecutive patients who underwent transoral surgery for lesions of the upper cervical spine. To analyze the incidence and risk factors of local infection after transoral surgery for the craniocervical junction in a single institution and to compare the findings with the literature. One of the primary risks associated with transoral approach for lesions in the upper cervical spine is postoperative surgical wound infection. From April 19"
