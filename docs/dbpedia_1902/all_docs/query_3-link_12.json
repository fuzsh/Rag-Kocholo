Moraes-Riodades\n\n2002-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Some morphometric relationships in Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller, 1862 reared in earthen ponds were studied. A total of 239 individuals were collected, sexed and sorted to juvenile or adult. Total length (Lt, post-orbital length (Lpo, carapace length (Lcp and queliped length (Lql were measured. The relationships Lt/Lpo, Lpo/Lcp and Lt/Lcp are the same for juveniles, males and females, indicating unchanged growth pattern during post-larval ontogenetic development. While Lt/Lpo showed isometric growth, Lpo/Lcp and Lt/Lcp showed negative allometry. On the other hand, for the Lql/Lcp relationship, juveniles showed isometric growth, females slight positive allometry and males a strong positive allometry. It suggests that the importance of chelipeds may be different in these groups. Quelipeds play important role on food capture and on agonistic, social and reproductive behavior. Therefore, inter and intraspecific interactions may change during prawn growth, even after morphological\n\nProduÃ§Ã£o de pÃ³s-larvas de Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller, 1862 (Decapoda, Palaemonidae, sob condiÃ§Ãµes controladas de laboratÃ³rio\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAline Do Vale Barreto\n\n1982-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Studies on production of post-larvae of the prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum under controlled laboratory conditions were developed at the Departamento de Oceanografia da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, from September 1980 to February 1982. Experiments were undertaken in aquaria and tanks where the salinity and density of the populations had been changed. The best production was obtained with salinity 14/00 with a density of 38 larvae per litre. The food provided for larvae was crushed fish and nauplii of Artemia salina. Out of 13 experiments a total of 20,000 post-larvae of Macrobrachium amazonicum were obtained.\n\nOccurrence of Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller (Decapoda, Palaemonidae in Leopoldo's inlet (Ressaco do Leopoldo, upper ParanÃ¡ River, Porto Rico, ParanÃ¡, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrÃ©a Bialetzki\n\n1997-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Studies on the occurrence, temporal distribution and nychthemeral variation of Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller, 1862 were undertaken in Leopoldo's Inlet, upper ParanÃ¡ River, Porto Rico, ParanÃ¡, Brazil. Seventeen thousand and sixty specimens (11,786 larvae and 5,274 juveniles were captured with a conicalcylindrical plankton net of mesh 0.5mm in monthly samples between February 1991 and February 1992. Results show that the greatest densities of larvae (301.83 larvae/10mÂ³ and juveniles (168.8/10mÂ³ of this species were caught in December 1991. Largest captures were made during the night. With regard to abiotic factors water temperature ranged from 20Âº to 30ÂºC, pH ranged from 5.66 to 7.37 and electric conductivity ranged from 51.83 to 65.33ÂµS/cm. Relationship between the density of larvae and juveniles and abiotic factors was calculated by the Principal Components Analysis (PCA which revealed the influence of some limnological variables especially on the distribution of larvae.\n\nReproductive cycle of Macrobrachium amazonicum females (Crustacea, Palaemonidae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCMS. Sampaio\n\nFull Text Available Macrobrachium amazonicum is considered a favorite Brazilian species of freshwater prawn for cultivation as a result of its quick development and because it is easy to maintain in captivity. The aim of this work is to describe the sexual cycle stages and determine maturation age of the female M. amazonicum, which was collected monthly from June, 2002 to May, 2003 in the Jaguaribe River, ItaiÃ§aba, CearÃ¡. A monthly sample of water was also collected to determine the following parameters: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and salinity. A monthly sample of females was selected among the individuals caught, to determine the total weight (W T, carapace length (L C and abdomen+telson length (L A+T and to register the number of non-ovigerous females (NOF and ovigerous females (OF. Determining ovarian maturation stages of M. amazonicum was done in a laboratory by observing macroscopic characters such as coloring, size, location and appearance of ovarians examined by transparent carapace. The first maturation age was determined from the relative frequency of the total length (L T of young and adult females. The environmental parameters of the Jaguaribe River did not hold any influence in the number of individuals collected. A total of 1,337 prawns were sampled, 513 males (38.4% and 824 females (61.6%. The proportion between males and females in the studied population was of 1:1.6. Among the collected females, 492 (50.7% did not carry eggs in their abdomens (NOF and 332 (40.3% carried eggs in their abdomens (OF. There was no record of intact females. Non-ovigerous females with mature ovaries were recorded throughout all the months of collection. The female ovaries were classified as immature (IM, rudimentary (RU, intermediary (IN and mature (M. M. amazonicum females reach their first sexual maturity between 4.5 and 5.5 cm of total length.\n\nMacrobrachium amazonicum: an alternative for microbiological monitoring of aquatic environments in Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRaimunda SÃ¢mia Nogueira Brilhante\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aimed to evaluate the role of the Amazon River prawn, Macrobrachium amazonicum, as carrier of Candida spp., by analyzing the correlation between Candida spp. from these prawns and their environment (surface water and sediment, through M13-PCR fingerprinting and RAPD-PCR. For this purpose, 27 strains of Candida spp. were evaluated. These strains were recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of adult M. amazonicum (7/27 from CatÃº Lake, CearÃ¡ State, Brazil and from the aquatic environment (surface water and sediment of this lake (20/27. Molecular comparison between the strains from prawns and the aquatic environment was conducted by M13-PCR fingerprinting and RAPD-PCR, utilizing the primers M13 and OPQ16, respectively. The molecular analysis revealed similarities between the band patterns of eight Candida isolates with the primer M13 and 11 isolates with the primer OPQ16, indicating that the same strains are present in the digestive tract of M. amazonicum and in the aquatic environment where these prawns inhabit. Therefore, these prawns can be used as sentinels for environmental monitoring through the recovery of Candida spp. from the aquatic environment in their gastrointestinal tract\n\nExperimental study on the efficiency of different types of traps and baits for harvesting Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller, 1862\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBianca Bentes\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Macrobrachium amazonicum is a freshwater prawn endemic to South America with wide distribution in Brazilian Amazon rivers. In estuary and freshwater streams of the ParÃ¡ State, they are captured with different types of traps locally know matapi. This study evaluated the efficiency of traps of different sizes (large, medium and small and baits (babassu coconut and fish for sampling this shrimp. Samplings were conducted with 24 traps with different treatments (trap size and bait. We captured 909 specimens. Higher mean catches were observed in traps baited with babassu coconut. Interactions between babassu coconut bait and medium matapi (BM-M, and fish bait and large matapi (FISH-L were significant. Carapace length (CL varied significantly between sites (F = 12.74, p < 0.01. The total maximum length was13.65 cm. Medium traps baited with babassu coconut were the most successful in the tested combinations, however, there was a clear correlation between size trap and size of shrimp, for both body weight and carapace length.\n\nHistological alterations in gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles exposed to ammonia and nitrite.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDutra, FabrÃ­cio Martins; RÃ¶nnau, Milton; Sponchiado, Dircelei; Forneck, Sandra Carla; Freire, Carolina Arruda; Ballester, Eduardo Luis Cupertino\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAquaculture has shown great growth in the last decades. Due to the restrictions on water use, production systems are becoming increasingly more intensive, raising concerns about the production water quality. Macrobrachium amazonicum is among the freshwater prawn species with favorable characteristics for production and possibility of intensification. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite affect the health of aquatic organisms since they quickly reach toxic concentrations. These compounds can also cause damage to the gill structure, leading to hypoxia in tissues, affecting acid-base balance, osmoregulation (salt absorption) and ammonia excretion, decreasing the immune capacity of the animal and, in extreme cases, cause death. The aim of this study was to assess histological changes in the gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles subjected to different concentrations of total ammonia and nitrite. The prawns were subjected to different concentrations of those compounds and their gills were removed and preserved for histological analysis. The gills were assessed for changes according to the Organ Index (I org ) and, for each change, an importance factor (w) was attributed according to the degree of reversibility and applied according to the degree of extension or frequency of the damage. The damage to the gills in the treatments with 100% mortality, both for ammonia and nitrite, corresponded to the high occurrence of progressive, regressive, circulatory, and inflammation damages. The other treatments (which caused less mortality) had mainly inflammation and regressive damages, whose occurrence increased according to the increase in ammonia and nitrite concentration. The histological analysis confirmed that the higher the total ammonia and nitrite concentrations, the larger the damages caused to the gill structure and that lower nitrite concentrations caused similar damages to those caused by higher total ammonia concentrations, which reflects the lower\n\nEffect of salinity on the metabolism and osmoregulation of selected ontogenetic stages of an amazon population of Macrobrachium amazonicum shrimp (Decapoda, Palaemonidae)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMazzarelli, CCM.; Santos, MR.; Amorim, RV.; Augusto, A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nProbably as a function of their wide geographical distribution, the different population of Macrobrachium amazonicum shrimp may present distinct physiological, biochemical, reproductive, behavioral, and ecological patterns.

The present study evaluated the influence of differences in the reproductive strategies of two geographically isolated populations of Macrobachium amazonicum, upon female fecundity, reproductive output and the chemical content of prawns and eggs. One prawn population from ParÃ¡ only completes its life cycle in brackish water, whereas another from Mato Grosso do Sul only inhabits freshwater. ParÃ¡ female prawns exhibited a larger average size and weight and produced more eggs than females from Mato Grosso do Sul. However, the Mato Grosso do Sul population produced eggs that were larger in volume than those of females from the other population. Furthermore, eggs produced by ParÃ¡ prawns were composed primarily of water (56%, whereas those produced in Mato Grosso do Sul were composed mostly of organic matter (80%. This difference in the eggs' chemical compositions did not apply to the chemical compositions of the females, as individuals from both sites were composed primarily of water. Mato Grosso do Sul females invested a higher amount of energy in brood formation (14% of their wet weight than individuals from ParÃ¡ (only 10%. It is possible that M. amazonicum populations show a higher degree of plasticity in their reproductive activity due to habitat conditions and genetic differences. Although the brackish population produces larger individuals, and exhibits higher fecundity, the freshwater population exhibited a higher reproductive investment. These results suggest a high reproductive capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions for this species, which should be considered in the context of aquaculture activities.\n\nAsociaciÃ³n entre el tamaÃ±o del depredador (pavÃ³n, Cichla orinocensis) y la presa (camarÃ³n de rÃ­o, Macrobrachium amazonicum) y sus relaciones morfomÃ©tricas\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMadrid, Fernando\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSe evaluÃ³, a nivel de laboratorio, la asociaciÃ³n entre el tamaÃ±o del depredador PavÃ³n Cichla orinocensis (Pisces: Perciformes: Cichlidae) y la presa CamarÃ³n de RÃ­o Macrobrachium amazonicum (Crustacea: Decapoda: Palaemonidae), con miras a utilizar a este pez como controlador biolÃ³gico del camarÃ³n, que es considerado una plaga por los piscicultores debido a su existencia en cantidades excesivas en los estanques de producciÃ³n de cachamas en la regiÃ³n centro occidental y los llanos altos de Venez...\n\nOsmoregulation in larvae and juveniles of two recently separated Macrobrachium species: Expression patterns of ion transporter genes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoudour-Boucheker, Nesrine; Boulo, Viviane; Charmantier-Daures, Mireille; Anger, Klaus; Charmantier, Guy; Lorin-Nebel, Catherine\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn this comparative study, osmoregulatory mechanisms were analyzed in two closely related species of palaemonid shrimp from Brazil, Macrobrachium pantanalense and Macrobrachium amazonicum. A previous investigation showed that all postembryonic stages of M. pantanalense from inland waters of the Pantanal are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water, while this species was not able to hypo-osmoregulate at high salinities. In M. amazonicum originating from the Amazon estuary, in contrast, all stages are able to hypo-osmoregulate, but only first-stage larvae, late juveniles and adults are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these physiological differences have not been known. We therefore investigated the expression patterns of three ion transporters (NKA Î±-subunit, VHA B-subunit and NHE3) following differential salinity acclimation in different ontogenetic stages (stage-V larvae, juveniles) of both species. Larval NKAÎ± expression was at both salinities significantly higher in M. pantanalense than in M. amazonicum, whereas no difference was noted in juveniles. VHA was also more expressed in larvae of M. pantanalense than in those of M. amazonicum. When NHE3 expression is compared between the larvae of the two species, further salinity-related differences were observed, with generally higher expression in the inland species. Overall, a high expression of ion pumps in M. pantanalense suggests an evolutionary key role of these transporters in freshwater invasion. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These differences are so accentuated that the existence of allopatric speciation has been suggested, although initial studies indicate that the genetic variability of populations happen at an intraspecific level. Among the biological responses described for M. amazonicum populations, those regarding osmoregulation and metabolism play a key role for being related to the occupation of diverse habitats. To this effect, we investigated osmoregulation through the role of free amino acids in cell volume control and metabolism, through oxygen consumption in larvae (zoeae I, II, V and IX) and/or post-larvae of a M. amazonicum population from Amazon, kept in aquaculture fish hatcheries in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. The results add information regarding the existence of distinct physiological responses among M. amazonicum populations and suggest that possible adjustments to metabolism and to the use of free amino acids as osmolytes of the regulation of the larvae and post-larvae cell volume depend on the appearance of structures responsible for hemolymph osmoregulation like, for example, the gills. In this respect, we verified that zoeae I do not alter their metabolism due to the exposition to fresh or brackish water, but they reduce intracellular concentration of free amino acids when exposed to fresh water, what may suggest the inexistence or inefficient performance of the structures responsible for volume regulation and hemolymph composition. On the other hand, in zoeae II and V exposed to fresh and brackish water, metabolism alterations were not followed by changes in free amino acids concentration. Thus it is possible, as the structures responsible for osmoregulation and ionic regulation become functional, that the role of free amino acids gets\n\nOccurrence of the Indo-Pacific freshwater prawn Macrobrachium equidens Dana 1852 (Decapoda, Palaemonidae on the coast of Brazilian Amazonia, with notes on its reproductive biology\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCristiana R Maciel\n\n2011-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The freshwater prawn Macrobrachium equidens, which is native species of the Indo-Pacific Region, was recorded for the first time on the Amazon coast of Brazil. This species was found to inhabit the same environment as two native Macrobrachium species, M. amazonicum and M. acanthurus, and is morphologically very similar to the latter.

Chips of Schizolobium amazonicum and Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla (reference were used. The following parameters were evaluated in the wood: basic density, total extractives, total lignin, holocellulose, and fiber morphology. The pulping simulations were carried out in a laboratory digester, with parameters set to obtain pulp with kappa number 19 Â± 0.5. Both pulps were bleached in a PFI mill and submitted to physical-mechanical tests. The results showed that S. amazonicum wood has low basic density and higher content of extractives when compared to E. grandis x E. urophylla wood. For pulping, S. amazonicum required higher alkali charge and H factor to achieve the same delignification level of E. grandis x E. urophylla, resulting in a lower yield, pulp with lower viscosity, and higher wood specific consumption. During bleaching, the brightness gain and final viscosity of S. amazonicum pulp were lower than E. grandis x E. urophylla pulp. Moreover, S. amazonicum pulp had worse physical-mechanical characteristics than E. grandis x E. urophylla.\n\nHeller Myotomy Versus Heller Myotomy With Dor Fundoplication for Achalasia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRichards, William O.; Torquati, Alfonso; Holzman, Michael D.; Khaitan, Leena; Byrne, Daniel; Lutfi, Rami; Sharp, Kenneth W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nObjective: We sought to determine the impact of the addition of Dor fundoplication on the incidence of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux (GER) after Heller myotomy. Summary Background Data: Based only on case series, many surgeons believe that an antireflux procedure should be added to the Heller myotomy. However, no prospective randomized data support this approach. Patients and Methods: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, institutional review board-approved clinical trial, patients with achalasia were assigned to undergo Heller myotomy or Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication. Patients were studied via 24-hour pH study and manometry at 6 months postoperatively. Pathologic GER was defined as distal esophageal time acid exposure time greater than 4.2% per 24-hour period. The outcome variables were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics between study groups. Pathologic GER occurred in 10 of 21 patients (47.6%) after Heller and in 2 of 22 patients (9.1%) after Heller plus Dor (P = 0.005). Heller plus Dor was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of GER (relative risk 0.11; 95% confidence interval 0.02â0.59; P = 0.01). Median distal esophageal acid exposure time was lower in the Heller plus Dor (0.4%; range, 0â16.7) compared with the Heller group (4.9%; range, 0.1â43.6; P = 0.001). No significant difference in surgical outcome between the 2 techniques with respect to postoperative lower-esophageal sphincter pressure or postoperative dysphagia score was observed. Conclusions: Heller Myotomy plus Dor Fundoplication was superior to Heller myotomy alone in regard to the incidence of postoperative GER.

Patient-reported outcomes are needed to determine whether the findings are sustained long-term. We actively engaged participants from the prior randomized cohort, making up to six contact attempts per person using telephone, mail, and electronic messaging. We collected patient-reported measures of dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux using the Dysphagia Score and the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) instrument. Patient-reported re-interventions for dysphagia were verified by obtaining longitudinal medical records. Among living participants, 27/41 (66%) were contacted and all completed the follow-up study at a mean of 11.8Â years postoperatively. Median Dysphagia Scores and GERD-HRQL scores were slightly worse for Heller than Heller plus Dor but were not statistically different (6 vs 3, pÂ =Â 0.08 for dysphagia, 15 vs 13, pÂ =Â 0.25 for reflux). Five patients in the Heller group and 6 in Heller plus Dor underwent re-intervention for dysphagia with most occurring more than five years postoperatively. One patient in each group underwent redo Heller myotomy and subsequent esophagectomy. Nearly all patients (96%) would undergo operation again. Long-term patient-reported outcomes after Heller alone and Heller plus Dor for achalasia are comparable, providing support for either procedure.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy.\n\nLENUS (Irish Health Repository)\n\nDoodnath, R\n\n2012-02-01\n\nAchalasia is a rare motility disorder which causes failure of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) and is thought to affect 0.31\\\\/100,000 children per year in Ireland. The classic presentation is difficulty swallowing and vomiting undigested food, and children can often present with chest pain. In some instances, these symptoms can lead to considerable weight loss. In this report, we present 2 cases of patients with achalasia who have also been the first 2 cases of laparoscopic Heller\\\\'s cardiomyotomy performed in children in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHeterochrony in mandible development of larval shrimp (Decapoda: Caridea)--a comparative morphological SEM study of two carideans.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBatel, Annika; Melzer, Roland R; Anger, Klaus; Geiselbrecht, Hannes\n\n2014-11-01\n\nMandible development in the larval stages I-V of two palaemonid shrimp species, Palaemon elegans and Macrobrachium amazonicum, was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In contrast to the zoea I of P. elegans, first-stage larvae of M. amazonicum are nonfeeding. At hatching, the morphology of the mandibles is fully expressed in P. elegans, while it appears underdeveloped in M. amazonicum, presenting only small precursors of typical caridean features. In successive zoeal stages, both species show similar developmental changes, but the mandibular characters of the larvae in M. amazonicum were delayed compared to the equivalent stages in P. elegans, especially in the development of submarginal setae and mandible size. In conclusion, our results indicate heterochrony (postdisplacement) of mandible development in M. amazonicum compared to that in P. elegans, which is related to initial lack of mandible functionality or planktivorous feeding at hatching, respectively. This conclusion is supported by comparison with other palaemonid zoeae exhibiting different feeding modes. Our data suggest that an evolutionary ground pattern of mandible morphology is present even in species with nonfeeding first-stage larvae.

Due to recurrence or persistence of symptoms, a small subset of patients seeks reoperation. This study was undertaken to determine if reoperative Heller myotomy provides salutary amelioration of symptoms. 609 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 to 2013 were prospectively followed; 38 underwent reoperative myotomy. Patients graded their symptom frequency and severity before and after myotomy on a Likert scale. Median data are reported. Patients undergoing reoperative myotomy, when compared to those undergoing their first myotomy, experienced a higher conversion rate to an \"open\" myotomy (8% vs 1%, P myotomy led to improvement in symptoms, but the magnitude of improvement in symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, choking, and coughing) was less than for patients undergoing their first myotomy (all P Heller myotomy were less likely to report symptoms occurring once per month or less (83% vs 56%, P myotomy note improvement in symptoms, although to a lesser extent than patients undergoing their first myotomy. Patients undergoing reoperative Heller myotomy can expect to experience less improvement of symptoms, denoting the importance of the first myotomy.\n\nChemical Composition, Enantiomeric Distribution, and Antifungal Activity of the Oleoresin Essential Oil of Protium amazonicum from Ecuador.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSatyal, Prabodh; Powers, Chelsea N; Parducci V, Rafael; McFeeters, Robert L; Setzer, William N\n\n2017-09-23\n\nBackground: Protium species (Burseraceae) have been used in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as ulcers and wounds. Methods: The essential oil from the oleoresin of Protium amazonicum was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID, and chiral GC-MS. P. amazonicum oleoresin oil was screened for antifungal activity against Candida albicans , Aspergillus niger , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Results: A total of 54 components representing 99.6% of the composition were identified in the oil. The essential oil was dominated by Î´-3-carene (47.9%) with lesser quantities of other monoterpenoids Î±-pinene (4.0%), p -cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), Î±-terpineol (5.5%) and p -cymen-8-ol (4.8%). Chiral GC-MS revealed most of the monoterpenoids to have a majority of levo enantiomers present with the exceptions of limonene and Î±-terpineol, which showed a dextro majority. P. amazonicum oleoresin oil showed promising activity against Cryptococcus neoformans , with MIC = 156 Î¼g/mL. Conclusions: This account is the first reporting of both the chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of the oleoresin essential oil of P. amazonicum from Ecuador. The oil was dominated by (-)-Î´-3-carene, and this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely accounts for the observed antifungal activity of the oil.\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarry, Linda; Ross, Sharona; Dahal, Sujat; Morton, Connor; Okpaleke, Chinyere; Rosas, Melissa; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2011-06-01\n\nLaparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is beginning to include advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (pHeller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious. Although the LESS approach increases operative\n\nOccurrence of Quesada gigas on Schizolobium amazonicum trees in MaranhÃ£o and ParÃ¡ States, Brazil OcorrÃªncia de Quesada gigas em Schizolobium amazonicum em municÃ­pios do MaranhÃ£o e do ParÃ¡\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Cola Zanuncio\n\n2004-09-01\n\nFull Text Available An infestation of Quesada gigas Olivier (Hemiptera: Cicadidae on \"paricÃ¡\" Schizolobium amazonicum (Huber Ducken (Fabales: Fabaceae was reported in the Municipalities of Itinga, MaranhÃ£o State and Paragominas, ParÃ¡ State.

Worth\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjectives: In the early 1990s, minimally invasive videoscopy was applied to numerous operations. After undertaking more than 50 âopenâ Heller myotomies, our experience with videoscopic Heller myotomy began in 1992. We sought to determine whether the outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy is influenced by surgeon experience. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with severe dysphagia secondary to achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy between 1992 and 1998. Intraoperative endoscopy was utilized to ensure adequate myotomy in all patients. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: the first 25 patients (group I), the second 25 patients (group II), and the last 28 patients (group III). Clinical outcome was based on length of stay, incidence of intraoperative complications, conversion to an âopenâ procedure, and postoperative symptoms. Results: Perioperative complications occurred in 20% of patients in group I compared with 8% and 12% in groups II and III, respectively (P = NS). Only 3 patients required conversion to an âopenâ procedure, all in group I (P myotomies were undertaken. Conclusion: Outcome following videoscopic Heller myotomy, like other videoscopic operations, improves as surgeons progress along the videoscopic âlearning curve.â After approximately 20 videoscopic Heller myotomies, surgeons can expect fewer conversions to open procedures, shorter hospital stays, and better symptomatic relief.

The base of the cuttings were dipped in IBA solution for 10 seconds and then were staked in polyethylene tubes of 110 cmÂ³, filled with organic substrate (BioplantÂ®. The irrigation of the seedlings was carried out by means of a nebulization system with a uniform flow rate of 7 L.h-1. After 40 days, were evaluated: percentage of survival, rooting percentage, percentage of roots observed at the lower end of the plastic tube, average number of roots, length of roots, presence of calluses, vigor and root dry matter. The results for the characteristics evaluated, with emphasis on survival, showed the highest averages were obtained at intermediate stakes, regardless of the dose of IBA. The highest rooting percentage, root number, length and dry mass of roots, in both types of cuttings was obtained with the highest dose tested of AIB (32,000 mg.L-1. Based on these results, it is concluded that the technique of cutting associated with application of plant growth regulators can be used for vegetative propagation of S. amazonicum.\n\nEvolutionary history of genus Macrobrachium inferred from mitochondrial markers: a molecular clock approach.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJose, Deepak; Harikrishnan, Mahadevan\n\n2018-04-17\n\nCaridea, an infraorder of shrimps coming under Pleocyemata was first reported from the oceans before 417 million years followed by their radiation recorded during the Permian period. Hitherto, about 3877 extant caridean species were accounted within which one quarter constitute freshwater species. Freshwater prawns of genus Macrobrachium (Infraorder Caridea; Family Palaemonidae), with more than 240 species are inhabitants of diverse aquatic habitats like coastal lagoons, lakes, tropical streams, ponds and rivers. Previous studies on Macrobrachium relied on the highly variable morphological characters which were insufficient for accurate diagnosis of natural species groups. Present study focuses on the utility of molecular markers (viz. COI and 16S rRNA) for resolving the evolutionary history of genus Macrobrachium using a combination of phylogeny and timescale components. It is for the first time a molecular clock approach had been carried out towards genus Macrobrachium in a broad aspect with the incorporation of congeners inhabiting diverse geographical realms including endemic species M. striatum from South West coast of India. Molecular results obtained revealed the phylogenetic relationships between congeners of genus Macrobrachium at intra/inter-continental level along with the corresponding evolutionary time estimates.\n\nRevisiting Regression in Autism: Heller's \"Dementia Infantilis\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWestphal, Alexander; Schelinski, Stefanie; Volkmar, Fred; Pelphrey, Kevin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTheodor Heller first described a severe regression of adaptive function in normally developing children, something he termed dementia infantilis, over one 100 years ago.

Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy combined with fundoplication represents the treatment of choice for this disease, achieving good results in about 90% of patients. However, about 10% of treated patients refer persistent or recurrent dysphagia. Many Authors showed that this failure rate is related to inadequate myotomy. To verify, from experimental to clinical study, the modifications induced by Heller's myotomy of the esophago- gastric junction on LES pressure (LES-P profile, using a computerized manometric system. From 2002 to 2010 105 patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy followed by antireflux surgery. The calibrated Heller myotomy was extended for at least 2.5 cm on the esophagus and for 3 cm on the gastric side. Each step was evaluated by intraoperative manometry. Moreover, intraoperative manometry and endoscopy were used to calibrate the fundoplication. The preoperative mean LES-P was 37.73 Â± 12.21. After esophageal and gastric myotomy the mean pressure drop was 21.3% and 91.9%, respectively. No mortality was reported. Laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy with fundoplication achieves a good outcome in the surgical treatment of achalasia. The use of intraoperative manometry enables an adequate calibration of myotomy, being effective in the evaluation of the complete pressure drop, avoiding too long esophageal myotomy and, especially, too short gastric myotomy, that may be the cause of surgical failure.\n\nRespostas de plantas de Schizolobium amazonicum [S. parahyba var. amazonicum] e Schizolobium parahyba [Schizolobium parahybum] Ã deficiÃªncia hÃ­drica Responses of Schizolobium amazonicum [S. parahyba var.

Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse experiment in 13 treatments. The deficiencies due to macro and micronutrients markedly decreased the production of dry matter. The Schizolobium amazonicum showed different responses to treatments. In the first few weeks, the seeds were able to supply P in the necessary amount but, due to fast growth rates, N was the limiting factor at this stage. Nitrogen and Fe were the most limiting and Mg, S, and Cu, were the least limiting to growth. Sodium was also less limiting to growth.\n\nTreatments for pediatric achalasia: Heller myotomy or pneumatic dilatation?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJung, C; Michaud, L; Mougenot, J-F; Lamblin, M-D; Philippe-Chomette, P; Cargill, G; Bonnevalle, M; Boige, N; BellaÃ¯che, M; Viala, J; Hugot, J-P; Gottrand, F; Cezard, J-P\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe treatment of achalasia consists of reducing distal esophageal obstruction by either Heller myotomy surgery or endoscopic pneumatic dilatation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short- and middle-term results of these procedures in children. For technical reasons, children under six years old (n=8) were treated by surgery only, whereas patients over six years old (n=14) were treated by either Heller myotomy or pneumatic dilatation. Of the children aged under six years, 75% were symptom-free at six months and 83% at 24 months of follow-up. Of the patients aged over six years, complete remission was achieved by Heller myotomy in 44.5% vs. 55.5% by pneumatic dilatation after six months, and in 40% vs. 65%, respectively, after 24 months. Both pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy showed significant rates of failure. These results suggest that pneumatic dilatation may be considered a primary treatment in children over six years old. Also, where necessary, Heller myotomy and pneumatic dilatation may be used as complementary treatments.\n\nOutcomes promote reoperative Heller myotomy for symptoms of achalasia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRakita, S; Villadolid, D; Kalipersad, C; Thometz, D; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2007-10-01\n\nHeller myotomy is accepted as first-line therapy for achalasia, yet for a small number of patients, symptoms persist or recur after myotomy. This study was undertaken to report our results with reoperative laparoscopic Heller myotomy for recurrent symptoms of achalasia. We have undertaken laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 275 patients and reoperative myotomy in 12 patients for recurrent dysphagia, of which three had their initial myotomy undertaken by us. For each, studies prior to reoperative Heller myotomy documented a nonrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter without stricture. Patients scored symptoms before and after reoperative myotomy. Before reoperative myotomy, 75% underwent dilation and 42% underwent Botox injection. Ten of twelve reoperative myotomies were undertaken and completed laparoscopically. Median follow-up is 24.1 months (29.0 months + 25.89). Symptom frequency and severity scores improved significantly after reoperative myotomy. Frequency of vomiting and frequency and severity of heartburn were improved after reoperative myotomy, but not to a significant extent. However, they were not particularly notable prior to surgery, compared to obstructive symptoms, such as dysphagia. Excellent or good outcomes were reported in 73%, and notably, 91% stated that they would have the operation again after having been through the process firsthand and knowing their outcomes. Patient outcomes promote the application of reoperative Heller myotomy for recurrent or persistent symptoms of achalasia following Heller myotomy.\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM): feasible as reoperation following Heller myotomy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVigneswaran, Yalini; Yetasook, Amy K; Zhao, Jin-Cheng; Denham, Woody; Linn, John G; Ujiki, Michael B\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of performing peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the management of recurrent achalasia after failed myotomy. Eight patients presented to our institution between October 2010 and June 2013 with recurrent/persistent symptoms after prior laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Three patients underwent redo laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and five patients consented to redo myotomy with POEM. Demographics were similar between the groups with exception of age (POEM 69.5 vs. laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) 34.5, pâ=â0.003). Preoperative Eckardt scores, motility, and prior interventions were not significantly different. Three patients who underwent POEM and two who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy had prior fundoplication. There was one perforation identified after laparoscopic Heller myotomy and one patient with persistent subcutaneous emphysema after POEM. Both POEM and laparoscopic Heller myotomy demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms and Eckardt scores at average follow-up of approximately 5 months (pâmyotomy even in the presence of prior fundoplication. The procedure can be performed safely using a similar technique as for primary myotomy with the exception of creating the myotomy laterally along the right side of the esophagus and lesser curvature avoiding the previous anterior myotomy.\n\nRobot-assisted Heller's myotomy for achalasia in children.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAltokhais, Tariq; Mandora, Hala; Al-Qahtani, Ayed; Al-Bassam, Abdulrahman\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAchalasia is rare in children. Surgical options include open, laparoscopic and robotic approaches. However, Heller's myotomy remains the treatment of choice. This report describes our experience with robot-assisted Heller's myotomy in children and presents a review of the literature. Included in this study are children who underwent robot-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia via the Da Vinci surgical system between 2004 and 2015 at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The medical records of these patients were reviewed for demographic data, presenting symptoms, diagnostic modalities, operative procedures, complications, outcomes and follow-ups. Six patients were identified. The age of the patients at surgery ranged between 2 and 12 years (mean 7.1 years). The most common presenting symptoms were dysphagia, vomiting and nocturnal cough. Contrast swallow and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy established a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia in all of the patients. Four patients underwent esophageal dilatation 2-5 times before the definitive procedure. All patients underwent successful robot-assisted Heller's myotomy with concomitant partial posterior fundoplication. The postoperative course was uneventful. Five patients had a complete resolution of the symptoms and one patient improved. The follow-up assessments have been consistent and have ranged from 0.5 to 11 years (mean 4.4 years). Robotic-assisted Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia in children is safe and effective and is a suitable alternative to open and laparoscopic approaches.\n\nIntraoperative Assessment of Esophagogastric Junction Distensibility During Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeHaan, Reece K; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe sought to characterize the changes in esophagogastric junction (EGJ) distensibility during Heller Myotomy with Dor fundoplication using the EndoFLIP device. Intraoperative distensibility measurements on 14 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication were conducted over an 18-month period. Minimum esophageal diameter, cross-sectional areas, and distensibility index were measured at 30 and 40 mL catheter volumes before myotomy, postmyotomy, and following Dor fundoplication. Distensibility index is defined as the narrowest cross-sectional area divided by the corresponding pressure expressed in mm/mm Hg. Heller myotomy was found to lead to significant changes in the distensibility characteristics of the EGJ. Minimum esophageal diameter and EGJ distensibility increased significantly with Heller myotomy.\n\nOccurrence of Solenopsis saevissima F Smith (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) damaging Schizolobium amazonicum; Danos de Solenopsis saevissima F Smith (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) em Parica, Schizolobium amazonicum\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLunz, Alexandre M.; Aguiar, Tanice da S.; Cardoso, Andreza S.

This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia.

Transesophageal approaches using flexible endoscopy have recently been described. We hypothesized that using techniques and flexible instruments from our NOTES experience through a small cervical incision would be a safer and less traumatic route for esophageal myotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and success rate of using flexible endoscopes to perform anterior or posterior Heller myotomy via a transcervical approach. This animal (porcine) and human cadaver study was conducted at the Legacy Research and Technology Center. Mediastinal operations on ten live, anesthetized pigs and two human cadavers were performed using standard flexible endoscopes through a small incision at the supra-sternal notch. The esophagus was dissected to the phreno-esophageal junction using balloon dilatation in the peri-esophageal space followed by either anterior or posterior distal esophageal myotomy. Success rate was recorded of esophageal dissection to the diaphragm and proximal stomach, anterior and posterior myotomy, perforation, and complication rates. Dissection of the esophagus to the diaphragm and performing esophageal myotomy was achieved in 100% of attempts. Posterior Heller myotomy was always extendable onto the gastric wall, while anterior gastric extension of the myotomy was found to be more difficult (4/4 and 2/8, respectively; P = 0.061). Heller myotomy through a small cervical incision using flexible endoscopes is feasible. A complete Heller myotomy was performed with a higher success rate posteriorly possibly due to less anatomic interference.\n\nVideoscopic Heller Myotomy with Intraoperative Endoscopy Promotes Optimal Outcomes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBloomston, Mark; Brady, Patrick\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are applicable to achalasia, but the optimum approach to intraoperative assessment of adequacy of myotomy remains unestablished. We set out to show that videoscopic Heller myotomy with concurrent endoscopy ensures adequacy of myotomy while limiting postoperative clinically apparent reflux. Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with achalasia underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy with concomitant endoscopy between 1992 and 1998. Fundoplication was not routinely undertaken. Results: Preoperative symptoms consisted of dysphagia (100%), emesis/regurgitation (68%), heartburn (58%), and postprandial chest pain (49%). Following myotomy, significant improvement (P Heller myotomy guides the extent and adequacy of myotomy. By utilizing a focused dissection with preservation of the natural antireflux mechanisms around the gastroesophageal junction and limiting the extent of myotomy along the cardia, postoperative reflux symptoms are minimized. We advocate concomitant endoscopy during Heller myotomy to guide myotomy and submit that routine fundoplication is clinically unnecessary.

This study was undertaken to determine long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy used to treat achalasia. Of 337 patients who have undergone laparoscopic Heller myotomy since 1992, 47 who underwent myotomy more than 10 years ago have been followed through a prospectively maintained registry. Among many symptoms, patients scored dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn before and after myotomy using a Likert scale with choices ranging from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Symptom scores before and after myotomy were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Data are reported as median (mean Â± standard deviation). The median length of the hospital stay was 2 days (mean, 3 Â± 8.6 days; range, 1-60 days). Notable complications were infrequent after myotomy. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient required a redo myotomy after 5 years due to recurrence of symptoms. At this writing, 33 patients (70%) are still alive. The causes of death after discharge were unrelated to myotomy. The frequency and severity scores for dysphagia, chest pain, vomiting, regurgitation, choking, and heartburn all decreased significantly after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (p Heller myotomy can be undertaken with few complications. This procedure significantly decreases the frequency and severity of achalasia symptoms without promoting heartburn. The symptoms of achalasia are durably ameliorated by laparoscopic Heller myotomy during long-term follow-up evaluation, thereby promoting application of this procedure.\n\nIdentification of novel allergen in edible insect, Gryllus bimaculatus and its cross-reactivity with Macrobrachium spp. allergens.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSrinroch, Chutima; Srisomsap, Chantragan; Chokchaichamnankit, Daranee; Punyarit, Phaibul; Phiriyangkul, Pharima\n\n2015-10-01\n\nEdible insects have recently been promoted as a source of protein and have a high nutrition value. Identification of allergens and cross-reactivity between Macrobrachium spp. and the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) is necessary for food safety control and to assist in the diagnosis and therapy of allergy symptoms. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate proteins. Allergens were determined and identified by IgE-immunoblotting with pooled sera from prawn-allergic patients (n=16) and LC-MS/MS. Arginine kinase (AK) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were determined as the important allergens in muscle of Macrobrachium rosenbergii whereas, hemocyanin (HC) was identified as an allergen in Macrobrachium spp. The allergens in Macrobrachium lanchesteri were identified as AK and HC. In addition, hexamerin1B (HEX1B) was identified as a novel and specific allergen in G. bimaculatus. The important allergen in G. bimaculatus and Macrobrachium spp. is AK and was found to cross-react between both species. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, recalls his childhood in the Holocaust and his contributions to science and technology that earned him the US National Medal of Technology and Innovation in a conversation with Elton J. Cairns, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Heller, born in 1933, describes the enslavement of his father by Hungarians in 1942; the confiscation of his family's home, business, and all its belongings in 1944; and his incarceration in a brick factory with 18,000 Jews who were shipped by the Hungarians to be gassed by Germans in Auschwitz. Dr. Heller and his immediate family survived the Holocaust and arrived in Israel in 1945. He studied under Ernst David Bergmann at the Hebrew University, and then worked at Bell Laboratories and GTE Laboratories, where he headed Bell Lab's Electronic Materials Research Department. At GTE Laboratories, he built in 1966 the first neodymium liquid lasers and in 1973 with Jim Auborn conceived and engineered the lithium thionyl chloride battery, one of the first to be manufactured lithium batteries, which is still in use. After joining the faculty of engineering of The University of Texas at Austin, he cofounded with his son Ephraim Heller TheraSense, now a major part of Abbott Diabetes Care, which produced a microcoulometer that made the monitoring of glucose painless by accurately measuring the blood glucose concentration in 300 nL of blood. He also describes the electrical wiring of enzymes, the basis for Abbott's state-of-the-art continuous glucose monitoring system. He discusses his perspective of reducing the risk of catastrophic global warming in a wealth-accumulating, more-energy-consuming world and provides advice for students entering careers in science or engineering.\n\nOcorrÃªncia de Quesada gigas em Schizolobium amazonicum em municÃ­pios do MaranhÃ£o e do ParÃ¡\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nZanuncio, JosÃ© Cola; Pereira, FabrÃ­cio Fagundes; Zanuncio, Teresinha Vinha; Martinelli, Nilza Maria; Pinon, Tobias Baruc Moreira; GuimarÃ£es, Edylene Marota\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAn infestation of Quesada gigas Olivier (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) on \"paricÃ¡\" Schizolobium amazonicum (Huber) Ducken (Fabales: Fabaceae) was reported in the Municipalities of Itinga, MaranhÃ£o State and Paragominas, ParÃ¡ State.

The best treatment is surgical and the laparoscopic approach may have good results. To assess the results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy among patients with achalasia. Prospective study of patients subjected to a laparoscopic Heller myotomy between 1995 and 2004. Clinical features, early and late operative results were assessed. Twenty seven patients aged 12 to 74 years (12 females) were operated. All had disphagia lasting for a mean of 32 months. Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure ranged from 18 to 85 mmHg. Eight patients received other treatments prior to surgery but symptoms persisted or reappeared. The preoperative clinical score was 7. No patient died and no procedure had to be converted to open surgery. In a follow up of 21 to 131 months, all patients are satisfied with the surgical results and the postoperative clinical score is 1. Only one patient with a mega esophagus maintained a clinical score of six. In this series of patients, laparoscopic Heller myotomy was an effective and safe treatment for esophageal achalasia.\n\nEndoscopic Therapy for Achalasia Before Heller Myotomy Results in Worse Outcomes Than Heller Myotomy Alone\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmith, C Daniel; Stival, Alessandro; Howell, D Lee; Swafford, Vickie\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective: Heller myotomy has been shown to be an effective primary treatment of achalasia. However, many physicians treating patients with achalasia continue to offer endoscopic therapies before recommending operative myotomy. Herein we report outcomes in 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy with the majority (74%) undergoing myotomy as secondary treatment of achalasia. Methods: Data on all patients undergoing operative management of achalasia are collected prospectively. Over a 9-year period (1994â2003), 209 patients underwent Heller myotomy for achalasia. Of these, 154 had undergone either Botox injection and/or pneumatic dilation preoperatively. Preoperative, operative, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with multiple Ï2 and Mann-Whitney U analyses, as well as ANOVA. Results: Among the 209 patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia, 154 received endoscopic therapy before being referred for surgery (100 dilation only, 33 Botox only, 21 both). The groups were matched for preoperative demographics and symptom scores for dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain. Intraoperative complications were more common in the endoscopically treated group with GI perforations being the most common complication (9.7% versus 3.6%). Postoperative complications, primarily severe dysphagia, and pulmonary complications were more common after endoscopic treatment (10.4% versus 5.4%). Failure of myotomy as defined by persistent or recurrent severe symptoms, or need for additionally therapy including redo myotomy or esophagectomy was higher in the endoscopically treated group (19.5% versus 10.1%). Conclusion: Use of preoperative endoscopic therapy remains common and has resulted in more intraoperative complications, primarily perforation, more postoperative complications, and a higher rate of failure than when no preoperative therapy was used. Endoscopic therapy for achalasia should not be used unless patients are not candidates for\n\nVideoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia--results beyond short-term follow-up.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBloomston, M; Boyce, W; Mamel, J; Albrink, M; Murr, M; Durkin, A; Rosemurgy, A\n\n2000-08-01\n\nHeller myotomy has long been utilized for patients failing nonoperative management of achalasia. Videoscopy has been advocated to decrease the morbidity of Heller myotomy; however, few reports document outcome beyond 1 year after videoscopic Heller myotomy. To determine perioperative morbidity, relief of dysphagia, and the incidence of postoperative reflux symptoms following videoscopic Heller myotomy with follow-up to over 4 years. Patients with achalasia documented by barium esophogram and esophageal manometry underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy beginning in 1992. Intraoperative peroral endoscopy was utilized to guide the cephalad and caudad extent of myotomy. A barium esophogram was undertaken in the immediate postoperative period to evaluate for subclinical leak and assess esophageal emptying. Seventy-eight patients underwent videoscopic Heller myotomy. The mean age was 51 years +/- 19 (range 14 to 91). Most (62%) patients had undergone pneumatic dilation prior to surgical consultation and 54% had previous botox injections. All patients complained of dysphagia and 40% had symptoms of heartburn prior to myotomy. After myotomy, 91% of patients stated that their swallowing was improved with myotomy. Thirteen patients (18%) experience heartburn more than once per week after myotomy. The average length of stay was 2 +/- 2 days, with 72% of patients spending 2 days or fewer in the hospital. Six (7.7%) major complications occurred: five esophageal perforations and one enterotomy without long-term sequellae. Three procedures (3.8%) were converted to \"open\" procedures. No deaths occurred. We conclude that videoscopic Heller myotomy is safe and efficacious, with low morbidity and mortality. Videoscopic myotomy provides relief beyond the short term for dysphagia due to achalasia with minimal reflux symptoms. We advocate videoscopic Heller myotomy in the treatment of severe dysphagia due to achalasia not adequately palliated by or amenable to nonoperative management\n\nPeroral endoscopic remyotomy for failed Heller myotomy: a prospective single-center study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhou, P H; Li, Q L; Yao, L Q; Xu, M D; Chen, W F; Cai, M Y; Hu, J W; Li, L; Zhang, Y Q; Zhong, Y S; Ma, L L; Qin, W Z; Cui, Z\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecurrence/persistence of symptoms occurs in approximately 20 % of patients after Heller myotomy for achalasia. Controversy exists regarding the therapy for patients in whom Heller myotomy has failed. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), a new endoscopic myotomy technique, for patients with failed Heller myotomy. A total of 12 patients with recurrence/persistence of symptoms after Heller myotomy, as diagnosed by established methods and an Eckardt score of â¥ 4, were prospectively included. The primary outcome was symptom relief during follow-up, defined as an Eckardt score of â¤ 3. Secondary outcomes were procedure-related adverse events, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure on manometry, reflux symptoms, and medication use before and after POEM. All 12 patients underwent successful POEM after a mean of 11.9 years (range 2 - 38 years) from the time of the primary Heller myotomy. No serious complications related to POEM were encountered. During a mean follow-up period of 10.4 months (range 5 - 14 months), treatment success was achieved in 11/12 patients (91.7 %; mean score pre- vs. post-treatment 9.2 vs. 1.3; P Heller myotomy resulting in short-term symptom relief in > 90 % of cases. Previous Heller myotomy may make subsequent endoscopic remyotomy more challenging, but does not prevent successful POEM.

This study reveals the morphologically identification of five freshwater prawn species under the genus Macrobrachium, including M. cavernicola, M. australiense, M. johnsoni, M. josephi and Macrobrachium sp.WMY-2017. As there was no previous record and information concerning with M. australiense, M. johnsoni, M. josephi and Macrobrachium sp. WMY-2017, they were regarded as the first record from Myanmar. A fragment of Mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I Gene (COI) was amplified successfully from three studied species: M. australiense, M. josephi, and Macrobrachium sp.WMY-2017. The interspecific divergences of studied species varied from 0.01 to 0.15. The phylogenetic tree based on COI fragment sequences showed that M. australiense was closely related to M. rosenbergii, while Macrobrachium sp. WMY-2017 was closest to M. josephi. The results of molecular phylogeny has clarified the relationship within the genus Macrobrachium and represents the first step toward understanding the pattern of speciation base on molecular approach in Myanmar.\n\nDefining the learning curve of laparoendoscopic single-site Heller myotomy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoss, Sharona B; Luberice, Kenneth; Kurian, Tony J; Paul, Harold; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2013-08-01\n\nInitial outcomes suggest laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication provides safe, efficacious, and cosmetically superior outcomes relative to conventional laparoscopy. This study was undertaken to define the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. One hundred patients underwent LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptom frequency and severity were scored using a Likert scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Symptom resolution, additional trocars, and complications were compared among patient quartiles. Median data are presented. Preoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 10/8 and regurgitation = 8/7. Additional trocars were placed in 12 patients (10%), of whom all were in the first two quartiles. Esophagotomy/gastrotomy occurred in three patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 9 per cent. No conversions to \"open\" operations occurred. Length of stay was 1 day. Postoperative frequency/severity scores were: dysphagia = 2/0 and regurgitation = 0/0; scores were less than before myotomy (P Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication well palliates symptoms of achalasia with no apparent scar. Placement of additional trocars only occurred early in the experience. For surgeons proficient with the conventional laparoscopic approach, the learning curve of LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication is short and safe, because proficiency is quickly attained.\n\nUse of intertidal areas by shrimps (Decapoda in a brazilian Amazon estuary\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHEBERT A.

Patients' symptoms include dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, heartburn, and chest pain. Achalasia is a chronic condition without cure, and treatment options are aimed at providing symptomatic relief, improving esophageal emptying, and preventing the development of megaesophagus. Presently, a laparoscopic Heller myotomy with a partial fundoplication is considered the best treatment modality. A properly executed operation is key for the success of a laparoscopic Heller myotomy.\n\nModulation by K+ Plus NH4+ of microsomal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in selected ontogenetic stages of the diadromous river shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum (Decapoda, Palaemonidae).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeone, Francisco A; Bezerra, Thais M S; GarÃ§on, Daniela P; Lucena, Malson N; Pinto, Marcelo R; Fontes, Carlos F L; McNamara, John C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe investigate the synergistic stimulation by K(+) plus NH4 (+) of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity in microsomal preparations of whole zoea I and decapodid III, and in juvenile and adult river shrimp gills. Modulation of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity is ontogenetic stage-specific, and particularly distinct between juveniles and adults. Although both gill enzymes exhibit two different sites for K(+) and NH4 (+) binding, in the juvenile enzyme, these two sites are equivalent: binding by both ions results in slightly stimulated activity compared to that of a single ionic species. In the adult enzyme, the sites are not equivalent: when one ion occupies its specific binding site, (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity is stimulated synergistically by â 50% on binding of the complementary ion.

To promote germination in seeds with coat impermeability the use of sulphuric acid (H2SO4 is recommended. The objective of this study was to identify a better time for the scarification with sulphuric acid for S. amazonicum seeds. The effect of scarification with sulphuric acid for 20, 40 and 60 min on germination and speed germination was studied for seeds that were either sowed immediately after scarification or after a 24-hour period of immersion in water. Seeds were sown on a mix of sand and sawdust (1:1. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications of 50 seeds. The statistical analysis of germination was carried out at six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 days after sowing, in a factorial scheme. For speed germination the means were compared by the Tukey test. There was an interaction between treatments to overcome dormancy and immersion time after scarification in most evaluations. Immersion in water accelerated the beginning of germination. All treatments to overcome dormancy promoted seed germination. However, scarification for 60 min, showed better germination, 92% when immediately sown and 86.5% when sown after 24 hours. Speed germination index was highest for scarified seeds for 60 min followed by immersion in water. Scarification for 60 min was the most efficient treatment to promote germination in S. amazonicum seeds.Impermeabilidade do tegumento da semente Ã Ã¡gua ocorre em muitas espÃ©cies, inclusive em Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke.

From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (pHeller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nFreshwater shrimps (Macrobrachium depressimanum and Macrobrachium jelskii) as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Madeira River Basin, Western Amazon.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGalvÃ£o, R C F; Holanda, I B B; De Carvalho, D P; Almeida, R; Souza, C M M; Lacerda, L D; Bastos, W R\n\n2018-01-10\n\nTotal mercury (THg) concentrations measured in two freshwater shrimp species (Macrobrachium depressimanum and Macrobrachium jelskii) showed a relationship with the location of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) from the Madeira River Basin, Western Amazon. Between August 2009 and May 2010, 212 shrimp samples were collected in the confluence of the Madeira River with three of its tributaries (Western Amazon). THg concentration was quantified in the exoskeleton, hepatopancreas and muscle tissue of the shrimps by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There were no significant differences between the two shrimp species when samples came from the Madeira River, but Hg concentrations were significantly lower in a tributary outside the influence of the gold mining area. Average THg concentrations were higher in the hepatopancreas (up to 160.0Â ngÂ g -1 ) and lower in the exoskeleton and muscle tissue (10.0-35.0Â ngÂ g -1 and Madeira River respond to local environmental levels of Hg and can be considered as biomonitors for environmental Hg at this spatial scale. These organisms are important for moving Hg up food webs including those that harbor economic significant fish species and thus enhancing human exposure.\n\nTwenty-year trends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the United States.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHaisley, Kelly R; Preston, Jennifer F; Dolan, James P; Diggs, Brian S; Hunter, John G\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTrends in the utilization of Heller myotomy for achalasia in the U.S. over time have not been previously described. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we analyzed patients undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 20-year period (1992-2011) to estimate rates of Heller myotomy, locations where the procedures were performed (rural, urban or teaching) and changes in technique (laparoscopic vs open) as well as outcomes of length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Over the last 20 years, the total number of Heller myotomies performed in the U.S. has increased (1576 cases in 1992 to 5046 cases in 2011, pÂ =Â 0.001). These procedures are now being performed laparoscopically (0.9%-67.0%, pÂ Heller myotomy at teaching institutions with decreased in-hospital mortality and shorter LOS. Copyright Â© 2017.

The unknown events of His biography were disclosed, like military service in the PiÅsudski's Legions at the rebirth of the Polish State and, subsequently, during the Nazi occupation of Poland--participation in the clandestine teaching of medical students. In the post-war times JÃ³zef Heller undertook teaching of medical students in WrocÅaw and next in Warsaw. In 1954 He begun to organize the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences--it now continues its activity. Professor Heller initiated the publication in Poland of three major biochemical journals, including Postepy Biochemii (1954). Thanks to His leadership the first Polish Medical Dictionary was published (1981). The article summarizes the pursuit of JÃ³zef Heller in various branches of academic life, which were and still are appreciated by subsequent generations of Polish biochemists.\n\nAn experience of laparoscopic modified heller cardiomyotomy for achalasia cardia\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRaza, A.; Majeed, F. A.; Imtiaz, T.; Hussain, M.; Saeed, Y.; Imran, M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective: The study was carried out to ascertain the outcome of laparoscopic modified Heller's myotomy for achalasia cardia and to determine the morbidity associated with it. Study Design: Descriptive cross sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Rawalpindi over a period of 4 years, from Jan 2010 to Aug 2014. Material and Methods: This study was carried out on patients undergoing surgical repair of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for cardiac achalasia at Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi over a period of four years (2010-2014). Patients undergoing laparoscopic-modified Heller myotomy at a thoracic referral and surgical training center. Eighteen cases of achalasia cardia based on clinical, barium and endoscopic findings were included in the sample using non probability purposive sampling technique. Pseudo achalasia, sigmoid esophagus were excluded.Laparoscopic modified Heller myotomy was done in all patients. Data were analyzed with the help of SPSS 20.0. Results: Age ranged between 14 years to 40 years with mean age of 28 years. The most frequent symptom was dysphagia (95 percent), followed by regurgitation of ingested food (60 percent), weight loss (40 percent) and chest pain (20 percent). Mean operating time was forty minutes. There was no perioperative mortality. We applied Dor patch in 4 patients. Three patients had mucosal tear on large myotomy, diagnosed per operatively and repaired. There was no conversion to open procedure. There was marked improvement in symptoms especially dysphagia and there was no post operative reflux. Conclusion: Modified Heller myotomy by laparoscopic approach is a safe and effective procedure with acceptable results. It is easy to perform and improves the symptoms of the suffering individual. (author)\n\nA single institution's experience with more than 500 laparoscopic Heller myotomies for achalasia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander S; Morton, Connor A; Rosas, Melissa; Albrink, Michael; Ross, Sharona B\n\n2010-05-01\n\nLong-term symptom relief and patient satisfaction after Heller myotomy are being reported. Herein, we report the largest experience of laparoscopic Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia. Since 1992, 505 patients have been prospectively followed after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Until 2004, concomitant fundoplication was undertaken for a patulous hiatus, a large hiatal hernia, or to buttress the repair of an esophagotomy, then concomitant fundoplication became routinely applied. More recently, laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) Heller myotomy has been performed when possible to improve cosmesis. Before and after myotomy, patients scored their symptoms. Before myotomy, 60% of patients underwent endoscopic therapy; of these patients, 27% had Botox (Allergan) therapy alone, 52% underwent dilation therapy alone, and 21% had both. Esophagotomy occurred in 7% of patients. Concomitant diverticulectomy was undertaken in 7%, fundoplication was performed in 59%, and LESS Heller myotomy was done in 12%. Median length of stay was 1 day. With mean follow-up at 31 months, the severity of all symptoms improved significantly. After myotomy, 95% experienced symptoms less than once per week, "
