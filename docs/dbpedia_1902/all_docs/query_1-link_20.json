        "text": "Effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication versus anterior and posterior partial fundoplications for treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a systematic review protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarshall-Webb, Matthew; Peters, Micah D J; Bright, Tim; Watson, David I\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe objective of this review is to determine the relative effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication compared to anterior and posterior partial fundoplication in controlling the symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and reducing their side effect profile in adults.The specific questions posed by this review are: what is the effectiveness of Nissen fundoplication in comparison to anterior partial fundoplication (90 degree, 120 degree and 180 degree) and posterior 270 degree fundoplication in terms of symptom control of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and what are the side effects of these surgical interventions?\n\nNationwide survey of partial fundoplication in Korea: comparison with total fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Chang Min; Park, Joong-Min; Lee, Han Hong; Jun, Kyong Hwa; Kim, Sungsoo; Seo, Kyung Won; Park, Sungsoo; Kim, Jong-Han; Kim, Jin-Jo; Han, Sang-Uk\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic total fundoplication is the standard surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, partial fundoplication may be a viable alternative. Here, we conducted a nationwide survey of partial fundoplication in Korea. The Korean Anti-Reflux Surgery study group recorded 32 cases of partial fundoplication at eight hospitals between September 2009 and January 2016. The surgical outcomes and postoperative adverse symptoms in these cases were evaluated and compared with 86 cases of total fundoplication. Anterior partial fundoplication was performed in 20 cases (62.5%) and posterior in 12 (37.5%). In most cases, partial fundoplication was a secondary procedure after operations for other conditions. Half of patients who underwent partial fundoplication had typical symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis, and most of them showed excellent (68.8%), good (25.0%), or fair (6.3%) symptom resolution at discharge. Compared to total fundoplication, partial fundoplication showed no difference in the resolution rate of typical and atypical symptoms. However, adverse symptoms such as dysphagia, difficult belching, gas bloating and flatulence were less common after partial fundoplication. Although antireflux surgery is not popular in Korea and total fundoplication is the primary surgical choice for gastroesophageal reflux disease, partial fundoplication may be useful in certain conditions because it has less postoperative adverse symptoms but similar efficacy to total fundoplication.\n\nRandomized clinical trial of 270Â° posterior versus 180Â° anterior partial laparoscopic fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoks, D J; Koetje, J H; Oor, J E; Broeders, J A; Nieuwenhuijs, V B; Hazebroek, E J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPartial fundoplications provide similar reflux control with fewer post-fundoplication symptoms compared with Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The best choice of procedure for partial fundoplication remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of two different types of partial fundoplication for GORD. A double-blind RCT was conducted between 2012 and 2015 in two hospitals specializing in antireflux surgery. Patients were randomized to undergo either a laparoscopic 270Â° posterior fundoplication (Toupet) or a laparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication. The primary outcome was postoperative dysphagia at 12 months, measured by the Dakkak score. Subjective outcome was analysed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Objective reflux control was assessed before and 6 months after surgery. Ninety-four patients were randomized to laparoscopic Toupet or laparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication (47 in each group). At 12 months, 85 patients (90 per cent) were available for follow-up. Objective scores were available for 76 (81 per cent). Postoperative Dakkak dysphagia score at 12 months was similar in the two groups (mean 5Â·9 for Toupet versus 6Â·4 for anterior fundoplication; P = 0Â·773). Subjective outcome at 12 months demonstrated no significant differences in control of reflux or post-fundoplication symptoms. Overall satisfaction and willingness to undergo surgery did not differ between the groups. Postoperative endoscopy and 24-h pH monitoring showed no significant differences in mean oesophageal acid exposure time or recurrent pathological oesophageal acid exposure. Both types of partial fundoplication provided similar control of GORD at 12 months, with no difference in post-fundoplication symptoms. Registration number: NTR5702 (www.trialregister.nl). Â© 2017 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nRandomized clinical trial of laparoscopic anterior 180Â° partial versus 360Â° Nissen fundoplication: 5-year results.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Z; Cai, W; Qin, M; Zhao, H; Yue, P; Li, Y\n\n2012-02-01\n\nAnterior partial fundoplication (AF) has been popularized by a lower risk of mechanical side effects. The question then emerges whether anterior partial wrap has a similar antireflux effect with Nissen fundoplication (NF). We therefore conducted a randomized study to compare the long-term outcome of anterior fundoplication with NF. One hundred patients who enrolled in the trial from May 2003 to March 2005 were randomized to laparoscopic AF or laparoscopic NF. Endoscopy, pH monitoring, manometry, a detailed questionnaire, and a visual analog symptom score were completed preoperative at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgical procedures. The postoperative adverse effects such as dysphagia and flatulence were compared between the two groups. Revision surgery or maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy was defined as failure. Fifty procedures were performed in each group. The outcome at 5 years follow-up was determined for 96 patients (96%; 49 patients in the AF group and 47 in the NF group). Three patients (3%) died of unrelated causes during follow-up, and one patient changed address. Both fundoplications were found to provide good control of reflux-related symptoms in most of the patients. For 96 patients followed up more than 5 years, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were well controlled in 81 patients (84.38%); the mean DeMeester scores in the AF group decreased from 106.89 Â± 14.12 to 12.67 Â± 3.14 and in the NF group from 109.51 Â± 17.98 to 10.81 Â± 2.65, and the esophagitis was ameliorated visibly. Moreover, there were significantly fewer patients in the AF group who complained of flatulence. Compared with NF, anterior 180Â° partial fundoplication is an effective treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and associates with fewer postoperative adverse effects. Â© 2011 Copyright the Authors.

Recent studies have questioned the necessity of a fundoplication, especially when a limited hiatal dissection (LHD) is performed and the angle of His is preserved. This is a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data. All patients underwent primary Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 30-month period. In select patients, an LHD was performed anteriorly. Symptomatic outcomes were assessed up to 2 years postoperation using the Achalasia Severity Questionnaire (ASQ), Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL). A total of 31 patients underwent Heller myotomy during the study interval. The majority of patients underwent Heller myotomy with full hiatal dissection (FHD) (21, 68%). Intraoperative mucosal perforations occurred in 3 (14%) patients undergoing FHD. Patient demographics, surgery details, and baseline symptomatic outcomes did not differ significantly preoperatively. At greater than 1 year postoperation, there was no significant difference between the groups for ASQ, GERD-HRQL, and GIGLI (Pâ=â.76, .78, and .33, respectively). Heller myotomy with LHD and no fundoplication and Heller myotomy with FHD and partial fundoplication result in similar GERD-related quality of life outcomes. Further studies (including pH studies) are necessary to determine if fundoplication is a necessary step in selected patients in whom an LHD is possible.\n\nDoes concomitant anterior fundoplication promote dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy?\n\nPubMed\n\nTapper, Donovan; Morton, Connor; Kraemer, Emily; Villadolid, Desiree; Ross, Sharona B; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2008-07-01\n\nConcerns for gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia justify considerations of concomitant anterior fundoplication. This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Notably, relative to patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test) and to less frequent and severe dysphagia and choking (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia. Concomitant anterior fundoplication decreases the frequency and severity of heartburn and dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Concomitant anterior fundoplication promotes salutary relief in the frequency and severity of symptoms after myotomy and is warranted.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy with or without partial fundoplication: A matter of debate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRamacciato, G; DâAngelo, FA; Aurello, P; Gaudio, M Del; Varotti, G; Mercantini, P; Bellagamba, R; Ercolani, G\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAIM: To present our experience of laparoscopic Heller stretching myotomy followed by His angle reconstruction as surgical approach to esophageal achalasia. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy; an anterior partial fundoplication in 17, and angle of His reconstruction in 15 cases represented the antireflux procedure of choice. RESULTS: There were no morbidity and mortality recorded in both anterior funduplication and angle of His reconstruction groups. No differences were detected in terms of recurrent dysphagia, p.o. reflux or medical therapy. CONCLUSION: To reduce the incidence of recurrent achalasia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy, we believe that Hisâ angle reconstruction is a safe and effective alternative to the anterior fundoplication.

However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy and Fundoplication: What Is the Evidence?\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Allaix, Marco E; Schlottmann, Francisco; Patti, Marco G; Morino, Mario\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThere is no agreement about the best type of fundoplication to add in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia to reduce the risk of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux. This article reviews the current evidence about the outcomes in achalasia patients undergoing LHM with a partial anterior, a partial posterior, or a total fundoplication. We performed a review of the literature in PubMed/Medline electronic databases, which was evaluated according to the GRADE system. The results of the published randomized controlled trials show with a high level of evidence that the addition of a fundoplication reduces the risk of postoperative abnormal reflux, without impairing the food emptying of the esophagus. LHM with partial fundoplication is considered in most centers worldwide the standard of care for the treatment of patients with achalasia. The current evidence fails to show any significant difference between partial anterior and posterior fundoplication. In the absence of further large randomized controlled trial, the decision of performing an anterior or a posterior wrap is based on the surgeon's experience and preference. The addition of a partial fundoplication to LHM leads to a significantly lower rate of postoperative pathological reflux without impairing the esophageal emptying.\n\nLong-term symptom control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 12 years after laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoks, D J; Broeders, J A; Baigrie, R J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication has been shown to achieve similar reflux control to Nissen fundoplication, with fewer side-effects, up to 5 years. However, there is a paucity of long-term follow-up data on this technique and antireflux surgery in general. This study reports 12-year outcomes of a double-blind RCT comparing laparoscopic Nissen versus 180Â° laparoscopic anterior fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Patients with proven GORD were randomized to laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior fundoplication. The 12-year outcome measures included reflux control, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms and patient satisfaction. Measures included scores on a visual analogue scale, a validated Dakkak score for dysphagia and Visick scores. Of the initial 163 patients randomized (Nissen 84, anterior 79), 90 (55Â·2 per cent) completed 12-year follow-up (Nissen 52, anterior 38). There were no differences in heartburn, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms, patient satisfaction or surgical reintervention rate. Use of acid-suppressing drugs was less common after Nissen than after 180Â° anterior fundoplication: four of 52 (8 per cent) and 11 of 38 (29 per cent) respectively (P = 0Â·008). The proportion of patients with absent or only mild symptoms was slightly higher after Nissen fundoplication: 45 of 50 (90 per cent) versus 28 of 38 (74 per cent) (P = 0Â·044). The two surgical procedures provided similar control of heartburn and post-fundoplication symptoms, with similar patient satisfaction and reoperation rates on long-term follow-up.

METHODS: Fifty-six patients (26 men, 30 women; mean age 42.8 Â± 14.7 years) presenting for minimally invasive surgery for oesophageal achalasia, were enrolled. All patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy followed by a 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in 30 cases (group 1) and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in 26 (group 2). Intraoperative endoscopy and manometry were used to calibrate the myotomy and fundoplication. A 6-mo follow-up period with symptomatic evaluation and barium swallow was undertaken. One and two years after surgery, the patients underwent symptom questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 h oesophago-gastric pH monitoring. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, no significant difference in the median symptom score was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.66; Mann-Whitney U-test). The median percentage time with oesophageal pH < 4 was significantly higher in the Dor group compared to the Nissen-Rossetti group (2; range 0.8-10 vs 0.35; range 0-2) (P < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney U-test). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic Dor and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication achieved similar results in the resolution of dysphagia. Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication seems to be more effective in suppressing oesophageal acid exposure.

The endoscopic, radiographic, manometric, and perioperative records for patients undergoing laparoscopic esophageal diverticulectomy, anterior esophageal myotomy, and partial fundoplication from 8/99 until 9/06 were reviewed from an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved outcomes database. Data are given as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). An esophageal body motor disorder and/or LES abnormalities were present in 11 patients with epiphrenic diverticula; three patients were characterized as achalasia, one had vigorous achalasia, two had diffuse esophageal spasm, and five had a nonspecific motor disorder. Presenting symptoms included dysphagia (13/13), regurgitation (7/13), and chest pain (4/13). Three patients had previous Botox injections and three patients had esophageal dilatations. Laparoscopic epiphrenic diverticulectomy with an anterior esophageal myotomy was completed in 13 patients (M:F; 3:10) with a mean age of 67.6 +/- 4.2 years, body mass index (BMI) of 28.1 +/- 1.9 kg/m2 and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 2.2 +/- 0.1. Partial fundoplication was performed in 12/13 patients (Dor, n = 2; Toupet, n = 10). Four patients had a type I and one patient had a type III hiatal hernia requiring repair. Mean operative time was 210 +/- 15.1 min and mean length of stay (LOS) was 2.8 +/- 0.4 days. Two grade II or higher complications occurred, including one patient who was readmitted on postoperative day 4 with a leak requiring a thoracotomy. After a mean follow-up of 13.6 +/- 3.0 months (range 3-36 months), two patients complained of mild solid food dysphagia and one patient required proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. The majority of patients\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Anterior Fundoplication Improves Frequency and Severity of Symptoms of Achalasia, Regardless of Preoperative Severity Determined by Esophagography.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander; Downs, Darrell; Luberice, Kenneth; Rodriguez, Christian; Swaid, Forat; Patel, Krishen; Toomey, Paul; Ross, Sharona\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine whether postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication could be predicted by preoperative findings on esophagography. Preoperative barium esophagograms of 135 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication were reviewed. The number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, and angulation of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) were determined; correlations between these determined parameters and symptoms were assessed using linear regression analysis. The number of esophageal curves correlated with the preoperative frequency of dysphagia, vomiting, chest pain, regurgitation, and heartburn. The width of the esophagus negatively correlated with the preoperative frequency of regurgitation. The angulation of the GEJ did not correlate with preoperative symptoms. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication significantly reduced the frequency and severity of all symptoms, regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or angulation of the GEJ. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication provides dramatic palliation for achalasia. More esophageal curves on preoperative esophagography correlate well with the frequency of a broad range of preoperative symptoms, including the frequency of dysphagia and regurgitation. Patients experience dramatically improved frequency and severity of symptoms after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or the angulation of the GEJ. Findings on barium esophagogram, in evaluating achalasia, should not deter the application of laparosocopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication.\n\nMidterm follow-up evaluation after a novel approach to anterior fundoplication for achalasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRichardson, W S; Kennedy, C I; Bolton, J S\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThis study aimed to compare the outcomes for Heller myotomy alone and combined with different partial fundoplications. The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 69 laparoscopic myotomies and 14 Heller myotomies, 80% of which were performed with partial fundoplication including 20 Toupet, 18 Dor, and 17 modified Dor procedures, in which the fundoplication is sutured to both sides of the crura and not the myotomy. The mean age of the study patients was 69 years (range, 15-80 years). Four mucosal perforations were repaired intraoperatively. There was one small bowel fistula in an area of open hernia repair distant from the myotomy. One patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of pneumonia. Phone follow-up evaluation was achieved in 68% of the cases at a mean of 37 months (range, 2-97 months). The results for no dysphagia and for heartburn requiring proton pump inhibitors, respectively, were as follows: Heller myotomy (85.7%, 28.5%), Toupet (66.6%, 33.3%), Dor (83.3%, 20%), and modified Dor (84.6%, 15.3%). Two patients with reflux strictures required annual dilation (Toupet, Dor). Two patients required revisions: one redo Heller myotomy (Dor) and one esophageal replacement (Toupet). Heller myotomy provides excellent dysphagia relief with or without fundoplication. Heartburn is a significant problem for a minority of patients. In the authors' hands, Toupet had the worst results and modified Dor was most protective for heartburn.\n\n[Long-term result of total versus partial fundoplication following esophagomyotomy for primary esophageal motor disorders].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Zi-jiang; Chen, Long-qi; Duranceau, Andre\n\n2008-02-15\n\nTo compare the long-term results of total and partial fundoplication on esophagus myotomy. From January 1978 to October 1998, 64 patients with achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm underwent esophagomyotomy and antireflux operation via left thoracotomy. Twenty-one patients underwent Nissen total fundoplication (Nissen group) and 43 patients underwent Belsey Marker IV partial fundoplication (Belsey group). Clinical, radiologic, radionuclide transit, manometric, 24-hour pH monitoring and endoscopic assessments were performed before and after the operation. There was no operative death and major complications for either group. At over 6 years follow-up and compared to Belsey group, patients in Nissen group revealed a higher frequency of dysphagia (P = 0.025) and more radionuclide material retention (P = 0.044). Both operative procedures reduced the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient. However, in Nissen group, the esophageal diameter observed on radiology was significantly increased from 3.9 cm preoperatively to 5.5 cm postoperatively (P = 0.012), while it kept the same for Belsey group (from 5.4 to 5.3 cm, P = 0.695). Reoperation in order to relieve the recurrent dysphagia and esophageal obstruction was performed on 8 patients in Nissen group and 1 in Belsey group (P < 0.01). When treating achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm by esophageal myotomy and an antireflux operation, a total fundoplication is not appropriate, whereas a partial fundoplication provides proper antireflux effect without significant esophageal emptying difficulty.\n\nAsymptomatic Partial Splenic Infarction In Laparoscopic Floppy Nissen Fundoplication And Brief Literature Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOdabasi, Mehmet; Abuoglu, Haci Hasan; Arslan, Cem; Gunay, Emre; Yildiz, Mehmet Kamil; Eris, Cengiz; Ozkan, Erkan; Aktekin, Ali; Muftuoglu, Tolga\n\n2014-01-01\n\nShort gastric vessels are divided during the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication resulting in splenic infarct in some cases. We report a case of laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication with splenic infarct that was recognized during the procedure and provide a brief literature review. The patient underwent a laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication. We observed a partial infarction of the spleen. She reported no pain. A follow-up computed tomography scan showed an infarct, and a 3-month abdominal ultrasound showed complete resolution. Peripheral splenic arterial branches have very little collateral circulation. When these vessels are occluded or injured, an area of infarction will occur immediately. Management strategies included a trial of conservative management and splenectomy for persistent symptoms or complications resulting from splenic infarct. In conclusion, we believe that the real incidence is probably much higher because many cases of SI may have gone undiagnosed during or following an operation, because some patients are asymptomatic. We propose to check spleen carefully for the possibility of splenic infarct.

Anterior fundoplication is usually performed after Heller myotomy to control GER; however, the incidence of postoperative GER ranges between 10% and 30%. Total fundoplication may aid in reducing GER rates. From December 1993 to September 2002, 153 patients with achalasia underwent Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus antireflux fundoplication. Of these, 9 were excluded from the study. The remaining 144 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus anterior fundoplication (Dor procedure) or Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus total fundoplication (floppy-Nissen procedure). The primary end point was incidence of clinical and instrumental GER after a minimum of 60 months follow-up. The secondary end point was recurrence of dysphagia. Follow-up clinical assessments were performed at 1, 3, 12, and 60 months using a modified DeMeester Symptom Scoring System (MDSS). Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring were performed at 3, 12, and 60 months postoperative. Of the 144 patients originally included in the study, 138 were available for long-term analysis: 71 (51%) underwent antireflux fundoplication plus a Dor procedure (H + D group) and 67 (49%) antireflux fundoplication plus a Nissen procedure (H + N group). No mortality was observed. The mean follow-up period was 125 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical (5.6% vs. 0%) or instrumental GER (2.8% vs. 0%) were found between the 2 groups; however, a statistically significant difference in dysphagia rates was noted (2.8% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Although both techniques achieved long-term GER control, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication.

However, it has been linked to worsening or newly developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the postoperative period. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of anterior fundoplication sleeve gastrectomy in patients with reflux. Academic hospital, United States. We prospectively collected data on 31 sleeve gastrectomy patients who concurrently underwent anterior fundoplication between July 2014 and March 2016. Patients were selected when they reported severe reflux before the procedure. Each patient was interviewed using the GERD score questionnaire (scaled severity and frequency of heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric pain, epigastric fullness, dysphagia, and cough) before and 4 months after the procedure. Our patients comprised 27 females and 4 males with a mean age of 49.9Â±9.6 years (range, 29-63 yr). They had a mean preoperative body mass index of 42.8Â±5.6 kg/m 2 (range, 33.3-58.4 kg/m 2 ), and 67.7% (n = 21) of these patients underwent hiatal hernia repair as well. Preoperatively, patients had a mean heartburn score of 7.4Â±3.6 (range, 1-12), regurgitation score of 5.4Â±4.1 (range, 0-12), epigastric pain score of 2.1Â±3.2 (range, 0-12), epigastric fullness score of 2.7Â±3.9 (range, 0-12), dysphagia score of 1.3Â±2.2 (range, 0-9), and cough score of .9Â±1.8 (range, 0-6). Mean preoperative GERD score was 18.9Â±9.8 (range, 6-36) in these patients. Patients were interviewed with the same questionnaire approximately 4 months postoperative. Patients had a mean heartburn score of 1.5Â±3.2 (range, 0-12), regurgitation score of .9Â±1.7 (range, 0-8), epigastric pain score of .4Â±1.1 (range, 0-4), epigastric fullness score of 1.1Â±2.4 (range, 0-8), dysphagia score of .3Â±1.1 (range, 0-6), and cough score of 0.

One\n\nSingle-Site Nissen Fundoplication Versus Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSharp, Nicole E.; Vassaur, John\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the emergence of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of SILS Nissen fundoplication and compare its outcomes with traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication between January 2009 and September 2010. Results: There were 15 SILS and 18 traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures performed. The mean operative time was 129 and 182 minutes in the traditional laparoscopic and single-incision groups, respectively (P = .019). There were no conversions in the traditional laparoscopic group, whereas 6 of the 15 patients in the SILS group required conversion by insertion of 2 to 4 additional ports (P = .0004). At short-term follow-up, recurrence rates were similar between both groups. To date, there have been no reoperations. Conclusions: SILS Nissen fundoplication is both safe and feasible. Short-term outcomes are comparable with standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Challenges related to the single-incision Nissen fundoplication include overcoming the lengthy learning curve and decreasing the need for additional trocars.

To decrease some of these postoperative complications, laparoscopic anterior fundoplication (LAF) was introduced. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the merits and drawbacks of LPF versus LAF for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing different types of LPF and LAF published in the English Language between 1990 and 2013. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Data was extracted and analyzed on ten variables which include dysphagia score, heartburn rate, redo operative rate, operative time, overall complications, rate of conversion to open, Visick grading of satisfaction, overall satisfaction, length of hospital stay, and postoperative 24-h pH scores. Nine trials totaling 840 patients (anterior = 425, posterior = 415) were analyzed. There was a significant reduction in the odds ratio for dysphagia in the LAF group compared to the LPF group. Conversely, significant reduction in the odds ratio for heartburn was observed for LPF compared to LAF. Comparable effects were noted for both groups for other variables which include redo surgery, operating time, overall complications, conversion rate, Visick's grading, patients' satisfaction, length of hospital stay, and postoperative 24-h pH scores. Based on this meta-analysis, LPF compared to LAF is associated with significant reduction in heartburn at the expense of higher dysphagia rate on a short- and medium-term basis.

We prospectively compared anterior fundoplication (Dor) with partial posterior fundoplication (Toupet) in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy. A multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial was initiated to compare Dor versus Toupet fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Outcome measures were symptomatic GERD scores (0-4, five-point Likert scale questionnaire) and 24-h pH testing at 6-12Â months after surgery. Data are meanÂ Â±Â SD. Statistical analysis was by Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Freidman's test. Sixty of 85 originally enrolled and randomized patients who underwent 36 Dor and 24 Toupet fundoplications had follow-up data per protocol for analysis. Dor and Toupet groups were similar in age (46.8 vs. 51.7Â years) and gender (52.8 vs. 62.5% male). pH studies at 6-12Â months in 43 patients (72%: Dor nÂ =Â 24 and Toupet nÂ =Â 19) showed total DeMeester scores and % time pHÂ <Â 4 were not significant between the two groups. Abnormal acid reflux was present in 10 of 24 Dor group patients (41.7%) and in 4 of 19 Toupet patients (21.0%) (pÂ =Â 0.152). Dysphagia and regurgitation symptom scores improved significantly in both groups compared to preoperative scores. No significant differences in any esophageal symptoms were noted between the two groups preoperatively or at follow-up. SF-36 quality-of-life measures changed significantly from pre- to postoperative for five of ten domains in the Dor group and seven of ten in the Toupet patients (not significant between groups). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy provides significant improvement in dysphagia and regurgitation symptoms in achalasia patients regardless of the type of partial fundoplication.

Laparoscopic anterior 180Â° fundoplication (180Â° LAF) is reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications while obtaining similar control of reflux. The present meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the value of the 2 techniques. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Springerlink, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Platform databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and 180Â° LAF. Data regarding the benefits and adverse results of 2 techniques were extracted and compared using a meta-analysis. Results: Six eligible RCTs comparing LNF (nâ=â266) and 180Â° LAF (nâ=â265) were identified. There were no significant differences between LNF and 180Â° LAF with regard to operating time, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo surgery again, quality of life, postoperative heartburn, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, postoperative DeMeester scores, postoperative lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, postoperative gas-bloating, unable to belch, diarrhea, or overall reoperation. LNF was associated with a higher prevalence of postoperative dysphagia compared with 180Â° LAF, while 180Â° LAF was followed by more reoperation for recurrent reflux symptoms. Conclusion: LNF and 180Â° LAF are equally effective in controlling reflux symptoms and obtain a comparable prevalence of patient satisfaction. 180Â° LAF can reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia while this is offset by a higher risk of reoperation for recurrent symptoms. The risk of recurrent symptoms should need to be balanced against the risk of dysphagia when surgeons choose surgical procedures for each individual with GERD.

The optimal type of fundoplication (posterior vs. anterior) is still debated. Aim To compare the long-term rates of dysphagia, reflux symptoms and patient satisfaction with current postoperative condition between two fundoplication groups in achalasia treatment. Material and methods Our retrospective study included 97 consecutive patients with achalasia: 37 patients underwent laparoscopic posterior Toupet (270Â°) fundoplication followed by Heller myotomy (group I); 60 patients underwent laparoscopic anterior partial Dor fundoplication followed by Heller myotomy (group II). Long-term follow-up results included evaluation of dysphagia symptoms, intensity of heartburn and patient satisfaction with current condition. Results Patients in these two groups did not differ according to age, weight, height, postoperative stay or follow-up period. Laparoscopic myotomy with posterior Toupet fundoplication was effective in 89% of patients, while laparoscopic myotomy with anterior Dor was effective in 93% of patients (p > 0.05). 11% of patients after posterior Toupet fundoplication had clinically significant heartburn vs. 35% of patients after anterior Dor fundoplication (p < 0.05). Overall patient satisfaction with current condition was 88%, with no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions According to our study results, the two laparoscopic techniques were similarly effective in reducing achalasia symptoms, but postoperative clinical manifestation of heartburn is significantly more frequent after anterior Dor fundoplication (35% vs. 11%). The majority of patients (88%) were satisfied with operation outcomes.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Embase (1966-Dec 2011) for articles reporting data on LF efficacy in partial responders. Due to a lack of randomized controlled trials, observational studies were included. Of 558 articles screened, 17 were eligible for inclusion. Prevalence data for individual symptoms were collated across studies according to mutually compatible time points (before and/or after LF). Where suitable, prevalence data were presented as percentage of patients reporting symptoms of any frequency or severity. RESULTS: Due to a lack of standardized reporting of symptoms, the proportion of patients experiencing symptoms was recorded across studies where possible. After LF, the proportion of partial responders with heartburn was reduced from 93.1% (5 studies) to 3.8% (5 studies), with similar results observed for regurgitation [from 78.4% (4 studies) to 1.9% (4 studies)]. However, 10 years after LF, 35.8% (2 studies) of partial responders reported heartburn and 29.1% (1 study) reported regurgitation. The proportion using acid-suppressive medication also increased, from 8.8% (4 studies) in the year after LF to 18.2% (2 studies) at 10 years. In the only study comparing partial responders to PPI therapy with complete responders, higher symptom scores and more frequent acid-suppressive medication use were seen in partial responders after LF. CONCLUSION: GERD symptoms improve after LF, but subsequently recur, and acid-suppressive medication use increases. LF may be less effective in partial responders than in complete responders.

However, the type of fundoplication is still a subject of debate. The aim of the study is to identify which partial fundoplication leads to better control of acid exposure, manometric parameters, and symptoms scores. A randomized controlled trial was performed to compare Dor vs Toupet fundoplication after LHM. The preoperative diagnosis was made by high-resolution manometry (HRM), upper endoscopy, and barium esophagogram. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were evaluated with Eckardt, GERD-HRQL, and EAT-10 questionnaires. Seventy-three patients were randomized, 38 underwent Dor and 35 Toupet. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Postoperative HRM showed that the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) and basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure were similar at 6 and 24Â months. The number of patients with abnormal acid exposure was significantly lower for Dor (6.9%) than that of Toupet (34.0%) at 6Â months, but it was not different at 12 or 24Â months. No differences were found in postoperative symptom scores at 1, 6, or 24Â months. There were no differences in symptom scores or HRM between fundoplications in the long term. A higher percentage of abnormal 24-h pH test were found for the Toupet group, with no difference in the long term.\n\nFundoplication\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... with feeds.

The aim of the study was to investigate any correlation of esophageal emptying to symptomatic response after laparoscopic Heller's myotomy and Dor's fundoplication. 'Bread and barium' (transit time of a barium opaque bread bolus) and 'timed barium' (height of esophageal barium column 5 minutes after ingestion of 200-250 mL of barium suspension) esophagogram was used to assess esophageal emptying in 73 patients with esophageal achalasia before 1 and 5 years (31 cases) after laparoscopic myotomy and anterior fundoplication. Symptoms assessment was based to a specific score. At 1-year follow-up, excellent and good symptomatic results were obtained in 95% of the cases. Esophageal maximum diameter, esophageal transit time, and esophageal barium column were significantly correlated to each other and to symptom score postoperatively (P < 0.001). Complete and partial (<90% and 50-90% postoperative reduction in barium column, respectively) emptying was seen in 55% and 31% of patients with excellent result. Patients with a pseudodiverticulum postoperatively had a more delayed esophageal emptying than those without. Symptomatic outcome and esophageal emptying did not deteriorate at 5-year follow-up. Esophageal emptying assessed by 'barium and bread' and 'timed barium' esophagogram correlated well with symptomatic outcome after laparoscopic myotomy for esophageal achalasia. Complete symptomatic relief does not necessarily reflect complete esophageal emptying. Outcomes do not deteriorate by time. Because of wide availability, esophagogram can be applied in follow-up of postmyotomy patients in conjunction with symptomatic evaluation. Â© 2011 Copyright the Authors.

This procedure guarantees a complete myotomy for the satisfactory resolution of dysphagia, a characteristic symptom of achalasia. To ensure the inclusion of the entire lower esophageal sphincter, an 8cm Penrose drain is placed at the surgical site 6cm above the gastroesophageal junction and 2cm in a caudal direction, for accurate laparoscopic measuring. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of this technique. A descriptive, retrospective, longitudinal, and observational study was conducted on a cohort of patients diagnosed with achalasia at the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Clinic of the Hospital General de MÃ©xico \"Dr. Eduardo Liceaga\". The study included 48 patients, 40 of whom had no prior surgical treatment and 8 that presented with recurrence. Forty-seven patients (97.9%) underwent a laparoscopic procedure and conversion to open surgery was required in 2 of them (4.25% conversion rate). Postoperative progression was satisfactory in all cases, with mean oral diet commencement at 52h and mean hospital stay of 5.7 days. No recurrence was registered during the mean follow-up period of 35.75 months and there were no deaths. Laparoscopic graduated (strictly measured) cardiomyotomy with anterior fundoplication is a reproducible, efficacious, and safe option for the surgical treatment of achalasia.

Redo fundoplication improves patient symptoms, but its impact on patient quality of life remains unclear. We hypothesized that laparoscopic redo fundoplication improves disease-specific and global quality of life in patients with recurrent symptoms following failed laparoscopic or open fundoplication. Data for all patients undergoing a redo fundoplication between August 2009 and June 2014 were collected prospectively. Reflux symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptom Scale (GERSS), the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL), and the global quality of life Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires obtained at 4Â weeks and 16Â months post-operatively. Forty-six patients underwent laparoscopic redo fundoplication during the study period for symptomatic hernia (nÂ =Â 11), GERD (nÂ =Â 18), or dysphagia (nÂ =Â 17). GERSS improved from 41 at baseline to 9 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001), and GERD-HRQL scores improved from 30 at baseline to 7 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001). Median dysphagia scores decreased from 4.5 to 1 (pÂ =Â 0.035). SF-36 scores demonstrated a significant improvement in general health (pÂ =Â 0.016) and emotional well-being (pÂ =Â 0.036) and a trend toward improved physical function (pÂ =Â 0.068) in the post-operative period, but these improvements were not statistically significant at longer-term follow-up. Overall, 82% of patients reported satisfaction with their operation, and 96% reported that they would have the operation performed again given the benefit of hindsight. While associated with long operative times and significant complications, laparoscopic redo fundoplication produces a durable improvement in reflux symptoms and disease-specific quality of life.

Both redo fundoplication and conversion procedure to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are safe and effective. We aimed to characterize the rates of different revisional procedures and to identify risk factors associated with failed fundoplication. Using a statewide database, we examined records for patients who underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2010. The primary outcomes were the rate of each type of reoperation and the pattern of subsequent procedures. Demographics and comorbidities were used in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with reoperation after fundoplication. A total of 9462 patients were included. Overall, 430 (4.5%) patients underwent reoperation. Of those, 46 (10.7%) patients underwent RYGB at first reoperation, with the remainder having a redo fundoplication. An additional five patients were converted to RYGB after undergoing a redo fundoplication (51 total patients converted to RYGB at any point, 11.9%). Eighty-three percent of patients converted to RYGB were obese, as opposed to 8% for redo fundoplication. A single redo fundoplication was done in 81% of patients, while 35 patients (8.1%) underwent two or more revisional procedures. On average, any reoperation was performed 2.9Â years after fundoplication, with redo fundoplication 2.5Â years and RYGB 6.5Â years later. Age 30-49Â years (vs.Â >70Â years; OR 2.01, pÂ =Â 0.011) and 50-69Â years (vs. >70Â years; OR 1.61, pÂ =Â 0.011), female gender (OR 1.56, pÂ =Â <Â 0.0001), and chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.40, pÂ =Â 0.0044) were associated with revisional surgery.

Clinical data of 11 cardiochalasia patients who underwent combined laparoscopic-endoscopic lower esophageal sphincterotomy and modified Dor fundoplication by the same medical team from January 2015 to December 2016 at The Second Hospital of Jilin University were retrospectively analyzed. The procedure was as follows: an incision was made in the anterior wall of esophagus and dissection of esophageal muscular layer was performed, then the bulged esophageal mucosa was covered by the fundus after 180 degrees fold to the right (fundoplication), finally the gastric fundus was joined to the right diaphragmatic foot by 3 to 5 knotted suture. The efficacy was judged by the Eckardt scoring standard: the postoperative Eckardt score â¤3 points indicated effectiveness, otherwise the treatment was invalid. Combined laparoscopic-endoscopic lower esophageal sphincterotomy and modified Dor fundoplication was completed successfully in all the 11 patients without any subsequent laparotomy and death. The mean operative time was 85 (78 to 137) min, blood loss was 15 (5 to 35) ml, and no upper digestive tract perforation occurred. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.0(6 to 9) d. After the operation, the pressure of lower esophageal sphincter decreased significantly compared to that before operation [(5.31Â±6.23) mmHg vs. (35.72Â±17.13) mmHg, P<0.05], and the Eckardt score decreased significantly as well (0.53Â±0.56 vs. 6.17Â±1.17, P<0.05). During the follow-up of 2 to 23 months, there was no postoperative mortality. One case experienced mild gastroesophageal reflux 6 months after operation, and another patient had recurrent dysphagia 17 months after operation, who both were improved after receiving proton pump inhibitors or gastric dynamic drugs, and balloon dilation.

In the presence of preoperative dysphagia and oesophageal dysmotility, this procedure has engendered concern in certain regards. METHODS This paper describes a consecutive series of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) patients with a high frequency of dysmotility. Patients were selected for surgery with 24-hour dual channel pH monitoring, oesophageal manometry and standardised reflux scintigraphy. RESULTS Following careful patient selection, 33 patients underwent fundoplication by laparoscopy. Surgery had high efficacy in symptom control and there was no adverse dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS Evidence of proximal reflux can select a group of patients for good results of fundoplication for atypical symptoms.\n\nFundoplication after heller myotomy: a retrospective comparison between nissen and dor.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. From 1998 to 2004 a first group of 48 patients underwent Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication for idiopathic achalasia (H+N group). From 2004 to 2010 a second group of 40 patients underwent Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication (H+D group). Some patients received a previous endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilatation or endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin that provided them only a temporary clinical benefit. Changes in clinical and instrumental examinations from before to after surgery were evaluated in all patients. Clinical evaluation was carried out using a modified DeMeester symptom score system. Dor fundoplication treatment reduced both dysphagia and regurgitation severity scores significantly more than Nissen fundoplication (p<0.0001). Indeed, the incidence of dysphagia was significantly higher in patients treated with floppy-Nissen than in those treated with Dor fundoplication: by defining dysphagia as a DeMeester score equal to 3 (arbitrary cut-off), at the end of follow-up dysphagia occurred in 17.65% and 0% (p=0.037) of patients belonging to the H+N and H+D groups, respectively. Heller myotomy followed by Dor fundoplication is a safe and valuable treatment. The procedure showed a lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia versus Nissen fundoplication and a negligible incidence of postoperative GERD in a long-term postoperative follow-up.\n\nQuality of life and antireflux medication use following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Zervos, E; Gonzalez, R; Albrink, M; Rosemurgy, A\n\n1998-06-01\n\nWith the advent of minimally invasive techniques, the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease has received renewed interest. The efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in eliminating reflux has been documented. This study was undertaken to determine changes in quality of life and cost of antireflux medications after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between 1992 and 1997 completed questionnaires assessing changes in pre- and postoperative cost and number of antireflux medications, reflux symptoms, and quality of life. The average number of antireflux medications was significantly reduced (1.8 versus 0.3, P < 0.0001) as was the average monthly cost ($170 versus $30, P < 0.0001). Patients reported significant (P < 0.05) symptomatic improvement in postprandial heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, postprandial nausea, postprandial vomiting, dysphagia, and gas/bloating. Patients in this series noted fewer symptoms and used fewer antireflux medications at less cost after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Symptoms commonly thought of as complications of fundoplication (vomiting, dysphagia, gas/bloating) were less common after fundoplication. This report documents the efficacy of laparoscopic fundoplication in improving quality of life and reducing use and cost of antireflux medications.\n\nFundoplication After Heller Myotomy: A Retrospective Comparison Between Nissen and Dor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuttitta, Antonello; Tancredi, Antonio; Andriulli, Angelo; De Santo, Ermelinda; Fontana, Andrea; Pellegrini, Fabio; Scaramuzzi, Roberto; Scaramuzzi, Gerardo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: A retrospective comparison between Nissen and Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia.

There is clinical uncertainty about which treatment should be recommended as first-line therapy. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of pneumatic dilation compared with laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication in improving achalasia-specific quality of life. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial at five academic hospitals in Canada. Fifty previously untreated adults with a clinical diagnosis of primary achalasia, confirmed by manometric testing, were enrolled between November 2005 and March 2010, and followed for 5 years after treatment. Randomization was stratified by site, in random blocks of size four and with balanced allocation. Patients were treated with pneumatic dilation or laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication. The primary outcome was the difference between the treatments in the mean improvement of the achalasia severity questionnaire (ASQ) score at 1 year from baseline. Prespecified secondary outcomes included general and gastrointestinal quality of life, symptoms, esophageal physiology measures (lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and pressure, esophageal emptying, abnormal esophageal acid exposure), complications, and incidence of retreatment. Functional and imaging studies were performed blinded and all outcome assessors were blinded. There were no significant differences between treatments in the improvement of ASQ score at 1 year from baseline (27.5 points in the Heller myotomy arm vs. 20.2 points in the pneumatic dilation arm; difference 7.3 points, 95% confidence interval -4.7 to 19.3; P=0.23). There were no differences between treatments in improvement of symptoms, general and gastrointestinal quality of life, or measures of esophageal physiology. Improvements in ASQ score diminished over time for both interventions. At 5 years, there were no differences between treatments in improvement of ASQ score\n\nIs Dor fundoplication optimum after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia? A meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Ming-Tian; He, Ya-Zhou; Deng, Xiang-Bing; Zhang, Yuan-Chuan; Yang, Ting-Han; Jin, Cheng-Wu; Hu, Bing; Wang, Zi-Qiang\n\n2013-11-21\n\nTo compare the outcome of acid reflux prevention by Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia. Electronic database PubMed, Ovid (Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, EmBase and Ovid MEDLINE) and Cochrane Library were searched between January 1995 and September 2012. Bibliographic citation management software (EndNote X3) was used for extracted literature management. Quality assessment of random controlled studies (RCTs) and non-RCTs was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.1.0 and a modification of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. The data were analyzed using Review Manager (Version 5.1), and sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting each study. Finally, 6 studies, including a total of 523 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with other types of fundoplication after LHM (Dor-other group), and 8 studies, including a total of 528 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with no fundoplication after LHM (Dor-no group). Dor fundoplication was associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate of clinical regurgitation and pathological acid reflux compared with the other fundoplication group (OR = 7.16, 95%CI: 1.25-40.93, P = 0.03, and OR = 3.79, 95%CI: 1.23-11.72, P = 0.02, respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences between Dor fundoplication and no fundoplication in all subjects. Other outcomes, including complications, dysphagia, postoperative physiologic testing, and operation-related data displayed no significant differences in the two comparison groups. Dor fundoplication is not the optimum procedure after LHM for achalasia. We suggest more attention should be paid on quality of life among different fundoplications.\n\nThe learning curve of laparoendoscopic single-Site (LESS) fundoplication: definable, short, and safe.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, Sharona B; Choung, Edward; Teta, Anthony F; Colibao, Lotiffa; Luberice, Kenneth; Paul, Harold; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease was undertaken to determine the \"learning curve\" for implementing LESS fundoplication. One hundred patients, 38% men, with a median age of 61 years and median body mass index of 26 kg/m(2) , underwent LESS fundoplications. The operative times, placement of additional trocars, conversions to \"open\" operations, and complications were compared among patient quartiles to establish a learning curve. Median data are reported. The median operative times and complications did not differ among 25-patient cohorts. Additional trocars were placed in 27% of patients, 67% of whom were in the first 25-patient cohort. Patients undergoing LESS fundoplication had a dramatic relief in the frequency and severity of all symptoms of reflux across all cohorts equally (P < .05), particularly for heartburn and regurgitation, without causing dysphagia. LESS fundoplication ameliorates symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease without apparent scarring. Notably, few operations required additional trocars after the first 25-patient cohort. Patient selection became more inclusive (eg, more \"redo\" fundoplications) with increasing experience, whereas operative times and complications remained relatively unchanged. The learning curve of LESS fundoplication is definable, short, and safe. We believe that patients will seek LESS fundoplication because of the efficacy and superior cosmetic outcomes; surgeons will need to meet this demand.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy and fundoplication in patients with Chagas' disease achalasia and massively dilated esophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nPantanali, Carlos A R; Herbella, Fernando A M; Henry, Maria A; Mattos Farah, Jose Francisco; Patti, Marco G\n\n2013-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy and fundoplication is considered today the treatment of choice for achalasia. The optimal treatment for end-stage achalasia with esophageal dilation is still controversial. This multicenter and retrospective study aims to evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in patients with a massively dilated esophagus. Eleven patients (mean age, 56 years; 6 men) with massively dilated esophagus (esophageal diameter greater than 10 cm) underwent a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and anterior fundoplication between 2000 and 2009 at three different institutions. Preoperative workup included upper endoscopy, esophagram, and esophageal manometry in all patients. Average follow-up was 31.5 months (range, 3 to 60 months). Two patients (18%) had severe dysphagia, four patients (36%) had mild and occasional dysphagia to solid food, and five patients (45%) were asymptomatic. All patients gained or kept body weight, except for the two patients with severe dysphagia. Of the two patients with severe dysphagia, one underwent esophageal dilatation and the other a laparoscopic esophagectomy. They are both doing well. Heller myotomy relieves dysphagia in the majority of patients even when the esophagus is massively dilated.\n\nMultimedia manuscript.

This study was undertaken to document outcomes after reoperative fundoplications. Sixty-four patients, 26 men and 38 women, of average age 55 years+/-15.6 (SD), underwent reoperative antireflux surgery between 1992 and 2003. Fundoplication prior to reoperation had been undertaken via celiotomy in 27 and laparoscopically in 37. Both before and after reoperative antireflux surgery, patients scored their reflux and dysphagia on a Likert Scale (0 = none, 10 = continuous). Reoperation was undertaken because of dysphagia in 16 per cent, recurrent reflux in 52 per cent (median DeMeester Score 52), or both in 27 per cent. Failure leading to reoperation was due to hiatal failure in 28 per cent, wrap failure in 19 per cent, both in 33 per cent, and slipped Nissen fundoplication in 20 per cent. Laparoscopic reoperations were completed in 49 of 54 patients (91%); 15 had reoperations undertaken via celiotomy. Eighty-eight per cent of reoperations were Nissen fundoplications. With reoperation, Dysphagia Scores improved from 9.5+/-0.7 to 2.6+/-2.8, and Reflux Scores improved from 9.1+/-1.4 to 1.8+/-2.7. Seventy-nine per cent of patients with reflux prior to reoperation, 100 per cent with dysphagia, and 74 per cent with both noted excellent or good outcomes after reoperation. We conclude that failure after fundoplication occurs. Reoperations reduce the severity of dysphagia and reflux, thus salvaging excellent and good outcomes in most. Laparoscopic reoperations are generally possible. Reoperative fundoplications are effective treatment for dysphagia and recurrent gastroesophageal reflux, and their application is encouraged.\n\nFundoplication with 180-Degree Wrap During Esophagogastrostomy After Robotic Proximal Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nOjima, Toshiyasu; Nakamori, Mikihito; Nakamura, Masaki; Hayata, Keiji; Maruoka, Shimpei; Yamaue, Hiroki\n\n2018-04-20\n\nCompared with total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy (PG) has potential advantages from a nutritional perspective, such as anemia and postoperative loss of body weight. However, PG is associated with some postoperative functional disorders, such as reflux esophagus (13-31%) and anastomotic stenosis (3-29%).1 We therefore developed a new procedure for fundoplication during esophago-gastrostomy after robotic PG (RPG). We performed RPG for early gastric cancer localized in the upper third of the stomach using the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA). After RPG conclusion, intracorporeal esophago-gastrostomy was performed by side-to-side anastomosis using a linear 45Â mm stapling device, Endo GIA purple cartridge.2 The post-excisional hole in the esophago-gastrostomy was closed with interrupted single-layered sutures by robotic suturing technique. Fundoplication was created by wrapping the remnant stomach around 180 degrees of the circumference of the esophagus; the remnant stomach was wrapped from the esophageal posterior wall towards the esophageal anterior wall. Four stitches were used for fixation. We did not add a bougie of esophago-gastrostomy when fashioning the wrap. In addition, we did not perform pyloroplasty. In our series with 15 patients, there were no postoperative complications. No patients had reflux symptoms. Our technique using the fundoplication with \"clockwise\" rotation attempts to prevent reflux by use of intragastric pressure to flatten the lower end of the esophagus into a valvate shape. Indeed, in fluoroscopic findings 4Â days after surgery, there was no reflux to the esophagus of the contrast medium. In endoscopic findings 3Â months after surgery, anastomotic stenosis was absent. We observed no endoscopic findings of reflux esophagitis. Formation of the pseudo-fornix was confirmed by wrapping the remnant stomach. RPG followed by fundoplication with 180-degree wrap may be a promising procedure for reflux esophagitis prevention.3\n\nEsophagogastric fistula secondary to teflon pledget: a rare complication following laparoscopic fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaladas, H G; Smith, G S; Richardson, M A; Dempsey, M B; Falk, G L\n\n2000-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic fundoplication has become the standard operation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In our service, a laparoscopic fundoplication is performed as a 2-cm floppy 360 degrees wrap with division of the short gastric vessels and the fundoplication is sutured using a prolene 2/0 mattress suture (Ethicon, USA) and buttressed laterally with two teflon pledgets (PTFE 1.85 mm; low porosity, Bard, USA). We report a patient with post-operative dysphagia due to an esophagogastric fistula caused by erosion of a teflon pledget. This is the first such case in 734 laparoscopic fundoplications performed between January 1991 and December 1998. Reoperation was required, resulting in a prolonged convalescence. A review of current literature has not revealed any similar cases. Causes for this rare complication are postulated.\n\nTeflon pledget reinforced fundoplication causes symptomatic gastric and esophageal lumenal penetration.\n\nPubMed\n\nDally, Elizabeth; Falk, Gregory L\n\n2004-02-01\n\nNissen fundoplication has become the standard operative procedure for the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. The use of Teflon pledgets in Nissen fundoplications by our unit has been associated with a number of complications that has led to a change of technique in performing these operations. We reviewed our database of all patients who had fundoplications that involved the use of pledgets and identified those who had represented with postoperative complications related to pledget erosion/migration. We identified 11 patients to date from a total of 1,175 fundoplications who had symptomatic pledget erosion occurring between 2 and 85 months after surgery (mean time 33.3 months). Symptoms included dysphagia, recurrent symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, and melaena, and in some cases significant morbidity was associated with the erosion. No common factor predisposing these patients to pledget erosion was identified. In the majority of cases removal of the pledget was associated with resolution of the symptoms. A review of the literature does not reveal any similar studies but problems associated with the erosion and migration of Teflon prostheses are described. The use of Teflon pledgets in fundoplication is associated with a small but significant risk of complications that has led to our unit abandoning this technique.\n\nA prospective cross-sectional study of laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease--a durable and effective anti-reflux procedure.\n\nPubMed\n\nShapey, I M; Agrawal, S; Peacock, A; Super, P\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic partial fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is reported to have fewer side effects when compared to Nissen fundoplication, but doubts remain over its long term durability in controlling reflux. The aim of this study was to assess outcome of symptoms for all patients presenting with GORD undergoing routine laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication. All patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication between August, 1999 and November, 2007 performed by a single surgeon were included in the study. The anti-reflux procedure studied was laparoscopic Lind (300Â°) fundoplication with crural repair in all cases. Patients completed pre and post-operative questionnaires containing validated scoring systems for heartburn, gas bloat, dysphagia and overall patient satisfaction. Over the 100-month period, 320 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication. Of these, 256 (80%) replied to the questionnaire at a mean of 31 months (range 3-96 months) following surgery. 91.4% of respondents had an improvement in heartburn symptom score with a significant reduction in score from 7.74 preoperatively to 1.25 postoperatively (p<0.001). There was also a significant reduction of mean modified Visick score for reflux control (heartburn and regurgitation) from 3.49 preoperatively to 1.48 after surgery (p<0.001). In total, 22 patients developed recurrent reflux symptoms with half of these reporting their recurrence within two years following surgery. Because of this all were tested with post-operative pH testing, yet only one had a 24-h pH time outside the normal range. Overall patient satisfaction was high with a visual analogue score of 9 and 88% of the patients claimed they would have the operation again. Laparoscopic Lind fundoplication demonstrates excellent reflux control when performed routinely for all patients presenting with GORD. This technique is both durable and efficacious in controlling reflux symptoms.

The most commonly used procedure is the anterior partial fundoplication according to Dor, although during recent years the posterior counterpart (Toupet) has become popular. Patients with newly diagnosed achalasia and referred for cardiomyotomy were randomised to receive either an anterior or partial posterior fundoplication following a classical cardiomyotomy. The effect of surgery was assessed during the first postoperative year by Eckardt scores, EORTC QLQ-OES18 scores and HRQL questionnaires. Timed barium oesophagogram (TBO) and ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring were performed to determine oesophageal emptying and the degree of reflux control, respectively. Forty-two patients were randomised into Dor (n = 20) and Toupet (n = 22) groups. Eckardt scores improved dramatically with both procedures, but the EORTC QLQ-OES18 (functional scales) scores revealed significantly better relative improvements in the Toupet group compared to the Dor repair (P = 0.044). Corresponding advantages in favour of Toupet were observed postoperatively in the percentage of oesophageal emptying at TBO (P = 0.011 in height and P = 0.018 in area), an effect not observed in the Dor group. There were no other significant differences recorded between the study groups concerning HRQL evaluations and objective assessment of gastro-oesophageal acid reflux. A partial posterior fundoplication after cardiomyotomy seems to achieve more improvement in oesophageal emptying and EORTC QLQ-OES18 functional scale scores than the anterior fundoplication. Otherwise no differences between the two anti-reflux repairs were noted. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01933373. Copyright Â© 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In general surgery, the laparoscopic treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux is the second most frequently performed robot-assisted procedure after cholecystectomy. A review of the literature and an analysis of the costs may allow a preliminary evaluation of the pros and cons of robotic fundoplication, which may then be applicable to other general surgery procedures. Eleven articles report 91 cases of robotic fundoplication (75 Nissen, 9 Thal, 7 Toupet). To date, there is no evidence of benefit in terms of duration of surgery, rate of complications and hospital stay. Moreover, robotic fundoplication is more expensive than the traditional laparoscopic approach (the additional cost per procedure due to robotics is 1,882.97 euros). Only further technological upgrades and advances will make the use of robotics competitive in general surgery. The development of multi-functional instruments and of tactile feedback at the console, enlargement of the three-dimensional laparoscopic view and specific \"team\" training will enable the use of robotic surgery to be extended to increasingly difficult procedures and to non-specialised environments.\n\nUnconventional Management of Chyloascites After Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOspina, Karen A.; Lee, Earl H.; Rehring, Scott R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground & Objectives: Chyloascites is a rare complication that can result from abdominal trauma, neoplasm, inflammatory conditions, or various abdominal surgeries. Few cases have been described secondary to iatrogenic injury from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. We describe a case in which this surgery resulted in chyloascites that was successfully treated by lymphatic glue embolization. Methods: A 37-year-old male presented with signs and symptoms consistent with chronic reflux disease. He underwent an uneventful laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Two weeks postoperatively, he was admitted for dehydration. During his admission, he began to develop a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and abdominal distention. Imaging and fluid analysis from thoracocentesis and paracentesis were consistent with chyle leakage. Despite nonoperative measures, the patient's presentation persisted. Results: Thoracic duct ligation was performed without success. Bipedal lymphangiography identified an extensive leak revealing a severely lacerated thoracic duct spilling contrast freely into the abdomen and no contrast entering the thoracic duct in the chest. The site of injury was successfully sealed off with percutaneous glue embolization through lymph channels. Conclusion: Chyloascites is a rare complication of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. When not successful with conservative measures, lymphatic glue embolization can provide effective treatment.

When presenting symptoms are extraesophageal, there is less enthusiasm for operative control of reflux because of concerns of etiology and efficacy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in palliating extraesophageal symptoms of GERD. Patients were asked to score their symptoms before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication on a Likert scale (0 = never/none to 5 = always/every time I eat). A total of 322 patients with extraesophageal symptoms (asthma, cough, gas/bloat, chest pain, and odynophagia) of 4 to 5 were identified and analyzed. After fundoplication, all extraesophageal symptom scores improved (P < 0.0001 for all, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). Likewise, postoperative symptoms were noted to be greatly improved or resolved in 67 per cent to 82 per cent of patients for each symptom. Furthermore, after fundoplication, patients were less likely to modify their dietary (82% vs 49%) or sleeping habits (70% vs 28%) to avoid initiating/ exacerbating symptoms. Although extraesophageal symptoms are conventionally thought to be inadequately palliated by surgery, this study documents excellent relief of extraesophageal symptoms after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, denotes high patient satisfaction, and encourages application of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nThe calibrated laparoscopic Heller myotomy with fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Martino, Natale; Marano, Luigi; Torelli, Francesco; Schettino, Michele; Porfidia, Raffaele; Reda, Gianmarco; Grassia, Michele; Petrillo, Marianna; Braccio, Bartolomeo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia is the most common primary esophageal motor disorder. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy combined with fundoplication represents the treatment of choice for this disease, achieving good results in about 90% of patients. However, about 10% of treated patients refer persistent or recurrent dysphagia. Many Authors showed that this failure rate is related to inadequate myotomy. To verify, from experimental to clinical study, the modifications induced by Heller's myotomy of the esophago- gastric junction on LES pressure (LES-P profile, using a computerized manometric system. From 2002 to 2010 105 patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy followed by antireflux surgery. The calibrated Heller myotomy was extended for at least 2.5 cm on the esophagus and for 3 cm on the gastric side. Each step was evaluated by intraoperative manometry. Moreover, intraoperative manometry and endoscopy were used to calibrate the fundoplication. The preoperative mean LES-P was 37.73 Â± 12.21. After esophageal and gastric myotomy the mean pressure drop was 21.3% and 91.9%, respectively. No mortality was reported. Laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy with fundoplication achieves a good outcome in the surgical treatment of achalasia. The use of intraoperative manometry enables an adequate calibration of myotomy, being effective in the evaluation of the complete pressure drop, avoiding too long esophageal myotomy and, especially, too short gastric myotomy, that may be the cause of surgical failure.\n\nLaparoscopic anterior 180-degree versus nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nBroeders, Joris A; Roks, David J; Ahmed Ali, Usama; Watson, David I; Baigrie, Robert J; Cao, Zhanguo; Hartmann, Jens; Maddern, Guy J\n\n2013-05-01\n\nTo compare short- and long-term outcome after 180-degree laparoscopic anterior fundoplication (180-degree LAF) with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).

Alternatively, 180-degree LAF has been alleged to reduce troublesome dysphagia and gas-related symptoms, with similar reflux control. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and web of Knowledge CPCI-S were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing primary 180-degree LAF with LNF. The methodological quality was evaluated to assess bias risk. Primary outcomes were esophageal acid exposure, esophagitis, heartburn score, dilatation for dysphagia, modified Dakkak dysphagia score (0-45), and reoperation rate. Meta-analysis was conducted at 1 and 5 years. Five distinct randomized clinical trials comparing 180-degree LAF (n = 227) with LNF (n = 231) were identified. At 1 year, the Dakkak dysphagia score [2.8 vs 4.8; weighted mean difference: -2.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.66 to -1.83; P < 0.001], gas bloating [11% vs 18%; relative risk (RR) 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36-0.97; P = 0.04], flatulence (14% vs 25%; RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35-0.91; P = 0.02), inability to belch (19% vs 31%; RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40-0.99; P = 0.05), and inability to relieve bloating (34% vs 44%; RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.99; P = 0.04) were lower after 180-degree LAF. Esophageal acid exposure (standardized mean difference: 0.19; 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.46; P = 0.15), esophagitis (19% vs 13%; RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.69-2.91; P = 0.34), heartburn score (standardized mean difference: 1.27; 95% CI:-0.36 to 2.90; P = 0.13), dilatation rate (1.4% vs 2.8%; RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.19-1.91; P = 0.39), reoperation rate (5.7% vs 2.8%; RR: 2.08; 95% CI: 0.80-5.41; P = 0.13), perioperative outcome, regurgitation, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and patient satisfaction were similar after 180-degree LAF and LNF. At 5 years, the Dakkak\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Ling; Wong, Carol Wing Yan; Chung, Patrick Ho Yu; Wong, Kenneth Kak Yuen; Tam, Paul Kwong Hang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nData on laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants remain limited. We describe our experience with this operation in children and in particular, infants younger than 12 months old. Medical records of all paediatric patients who had laparoscopic fundoplication done for GERD from 1998 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on age: group I: 0-12 months, and group II >12 months. Data on indications, patient's demographics, operative time, blood loss, conversions, complications, recurrences and duration of hospitalization were studied. A total of 86 patients were reviewed (group I, n = 21; group II, n = 65). While the mean age and body weight for group I were 8 Â± 2.99 months and 6 Â± 1.96 kg, the values for group II were 98 Â± 65 months and 18 Â± 9.6 kg, respectively. All patients had concurrent laparoscopic gastrostomy for feeding difficulties. The mean operative time was shorter in group I (157 Â± 55 vs 169 Â± 52 min, p = 0.66). Both groups had minimal blood loss only. The surgical outcomes in both groups were comparable in terms of recurrence (0 vs 3 %, p = 0.105) and complications (9.5 vs 6 %, p = 0.275). The median follow-up duration for group I and group II was 23 and 40 months, respectively. Sixteen (76 %) patients in group I and 45 (67 %) patients in group II did not develop pneumonia post fundoplication. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be safely performed in infants with outcomes comparable to older patients and a shorter operative duration. Low recurrence rate (up to 3 %) is shown by our long term follow-up data. We recommend laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to be considered in managing infants with GERD.\n\nBiologic Approaches for the Treatment of Partial Tears of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDallo, Ignacio; Chahla, Jorge; Mitchell, Justin J.; Pascual-Garrido, Cecilia; Feagin, John A.; LaPrade, Robert F.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been established as the gold standard for treatment of complete ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in active, symptomatic individuals. In contrast, treatment of partial tears of the ACL remains controversial. Biologically augmented ACL-repair techniques are expanding in an attempt to regenerate and improve healing and outcomes of both the native ACL and the reconstructed graft tissue. Purpose: To review the biologic treatment options for partial tears of the ACL. Study Design: Review. Methods: A literature review was performed that included searches of PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases using the following keywords: partial tear of the ACL, ACL repair, bone marrow concentrate, growth factors/healing enhancement, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), stem cell therapy. Results: The use of novel biologic ACL repair techniques, including growth factors, PRP, stem cells, and bioscaffolds, have been reported to result in promising preclinical and short-term clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The potential benefits of these biological augmentation approaches for partial ACL tears are improved healing, better proprioception, and a faster return to sport and activities of daily living when compared with standard reconstruction procedures. However, long-term studies with larger cohorts of patients and with technique validation are necessary to assess the real effect of these approaches.
