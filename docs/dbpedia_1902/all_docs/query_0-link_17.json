Children's poetry is one of the branches of this type of literature. Naturalistic themes have the highest frequency among the themes of children poems in two countries. The population of this research consists of collections that have been published from 1921 to 2011. Children's literature was born in England in the eighteenth century and before that the first didactic books for children had come into existence in England. In addition, due to industrial growth, the emergence of the new middle class and expansion of formal education the UK was pioneering among Europe and the world countries. Therefore, to find the roots of the formation of children's literature should be referred to the UK. Therefore, in this paper Britain childrenâs poem has been selected to be compared with Iranian childrenâs poem so that by revealing the similarities and differences one can deal with the pathology of poems for children in Iran and to detect shortcomings and strengths and present some guidelines that be helpful for children and young poets as well as critics and researchers in this field.

Despite its excellent efficacy rate of greater than 80%, a small percentage of patients remain symptomatic after the procedure. Limited data exist as to the best management for recurrence of symptoms after POEM. We present the first international, multicenter experience on the efficacy and safety of a repeat POEM in the management of achalasia. Patients who underwent a redo POEM from 15 centers in 9 countries were included in a dedicated registry. Technical success was defined as successful completion of a second myotomy. Clinical success was defined as an Eckardt score of less than or equal to 3 after the second myotomy. Adverse events including anesthesia-related, operative, and postoperative adverse events were recorded. Forty-six patients were included in the study. The average age was 49.3 Â± 16.78 years. Twenty (45%) patients were male. The mean pre-redo-POEM Eckardt score was 4.3 Â± 2.48. Technical success was achieved in 46 (100%) patients. Clinical success was achieved in 41 patients (85%). The average post-POEM Eckardt score was 1.64 Â± 1.67, with a significant difference of 2.58 (PÂ Heller should be considered. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT02162589.).

However, the difficulty in determining the exact extent of myotomy, a critical factor associated with the success and safety of the procedure, remains a limitation. Although the various endoscopic landmarks and ancillary techniques have been applied, none of these has been proven sufficient. As a solution for this limitation, the double-scope POEM technique with a second endoscope to assure the exact length of the submucosal tunnel has been applied since 2014. Before double-scope POEM was introduced, the second endoscope was applied only to confirm the accuracy of the procedure. In the present study, we performed double-scope POEM in the treatment of esophageal achalasia through a novel procedure of simultaneous application of the second endoscope to assist in the conventional POEM procedure.\n\nA Feast (Poem [In Bulgarian\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nV. Kachev\n\n2010-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This poem was written by Valentin Kachev in 1984 at the vineyard of Tsolo Todorov in Bashovitsa. Tsolo Todorov was one of the leaders of the Belogradchik uprising, murdered at the Belogradchik fortress in the summer of 1850. The poem has already been published in books in Bulgarian as well as in Russian.\n\nThrombocytosis distinguishes POEMS syndrome from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNaddaf, Elie; Dispenzieri, Angela; Mandrekar, Jay; Mauermann, Michelle L\n\n2015-10-01\n\nPOEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes) syndrome may be mistaken for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Differentiating the 2 entities is crucial, as there are major treatment implications. We compared platelet counts in 136 POEMS patients and 67 CIDP controls. Of the patients with POEMS, 53.7% had thrombocytosis, compared with 1.5% of those with CIDP (P < 0.0001). The median platelet count in patients with POEMS was 467,000/Î¼l compared with 275,000/Î¼l in those with CIDP (P < 0.0001). Thrombocytosis is a helpful indicator to prompt clinicians to consider the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome in patients who are thought to have CIDP, and is an important reminder of the increased risk of thrombotic events in POEMS syndrome.

The acronym, POEMS, represents polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein and skin change. However, there are associated features not included in the acronym such as sclerotic bone lesions, Castleman disease, papilledema, thromobocytosis, peripheral edema, ascites, effusion, polycythemia, fatigue and clubbing. In most cases, osseous lesions in POEMS syndrome present as an isolated sclerotic deposit and that reveal as osteosclerotic myeloma. Several cases of {sup 18}F-FDG PET in multiple myeloma involvements were reported, but there was no previous literature that reported FDG PET findings in POEMS syndrome.

Since September 2008, POEM has been successfully performed in more than 200 consecutive patients with symptomatic achalasia at the Digestive Disease Center of Showa University, Northern Yokohama Hospital, Yokohama, Japan, with excellent short- and long-term results and absence of serious complications. International experience of POEM within clinical studies is also promising. According to these results, POEM is considered as a safe procedure that can be applied to all achalasia patients. However, the low incidence of achalasia (0.3%â1% per 100,000 population), in combination with the potential serious complications related to the technically demanding POEM procedure, has made training difficult. There is therefore an urgent need for an animal model for training to decrease the learning curve. Further, there are other ethical and training issues to address. The pig is the most appropriate animal model for training in POEM due to its anatomy being similar to that of humans. The porcine esophagus has the advantage of easy mobilization due to absence of tight junctions to surrounding organs. A non-survival porcine model would be a simple, inexpensive, and reproducible animal model for training in POEM, without the need for concern about complications. A possible training process might first involve observation of POEM performed by specialists, then training on non-survival and survival porcine models, followed by training in humans under specialist guidance and finally, performance of POEM in humans.

The association of POEMS syndrome with lympho-proliferative disorder is very commun. The pathogenesis remains poorly understood but implication of cytokines (interleukins 1 and 6) is suspected. We report a case of a classic POEMS syndrome (with polyneuropathy, hepatomegaly, diabetes melitus, hyperpigmentation, monoclonal IgG lambda, anasarca and solitary plasmocytoma), associated with high serum levels of interleukin 6.\n\nDylan Thomasâs 25 Poems: Paradox as Structure\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS. BHARADWAJ\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Irony, inclusiveness, and complexity are the chief criteria of value in the twentieth century intellectual poetry. These criteria, however, do not merely indicate qualities of craftsmanship; they reflect a sensibility, a particular way of experiencing reality. What really distinguishes Dylan Thomas is a capacity for self-analysis, a capacity for objectifying, and subjecting to analytical scrutiny, oneâs own experiences and feelings. The searching self-exploration that links Thomas with W.H. Auden is more evident in 25 Poems than in his 18 Poems, and in 25 Poems the readers are priviledged to watch his own mental processes. What happens in 18 Poems is that the poetâs mind operates simultaneously at two levels, and the readers can witness a co-operation and coalescence of emotion and ratiocination. In 25 Poems, the heart is involved in experience and suffers, while an alert intelligence, conscious of itself, analyses and weighs the experience. The result is inclusiveness arising out of a recognition of the complexity of experience, of the pressure of the total context upon a particular situation or mental state. Thomasâs 18 Poems has this quality of paradox in varying degrees, and it shows the juxtaposition and integration of opposed attitudes enriching the poetic texture. The most equal emphases on erotic love and creative quest in 18 Poems present one kind of inclusiveness.Â In 25 Poems, the apparently disorganized flow of thought resembles the stream-of-consciousness technique, but the presence of an alert mind weighing different approaches and directing the journey of life is obvious. His interest in Day Lewis, Spender, and MacNeice is equally indicative of his love of contrasts, of chiaroscuro effects, and is not to be confused with Audenâs interest in characterization. Thomasâs early poetry is an imago of paradox, âa homeâ of âcomfortâ and faith âthe neighbourâs strongest wish, to serve and loveâ¦â in which â\n\nTraining in peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM for esophageal achalasia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEleftheriadis N\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Nicholas Eleftheriadis, Haruhiro Inoue, Haruo Ikeda, Manabu Onimaru, Akira Yoshida, Toshihisa Hosoya, Roberta Maselli, Shin-ei KudoDigestive Disease Center, Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital, Yokohama, JapanAbstract: Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM has been developed in the context of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES as a minimally invasive endoscopic treatment for symptomatic esophageal achalasia, which is a chronic progressive benign disease with severe morbidity and difficult management.

Radif as one of the pillars of the side music, has played a major role in classical Persian poetry, and Persian poets haveÂ shown greatÂ attention to composingÂ radif-consistingÂ poems, since ancient times. In the early Persian poetry, radif is used slightly but the more the Persian poetry completed, the more application of radif have seen, and gradually, poets intended to use simple types instead of those complicated. One of the poets who have shown special attention to using radif and its application forms are of high-frequency in his poems, is khaghani. In this essay, we have tried to analyzeÂ Khaghani's poem statically. For this purpose, we have provided accurate statistics of the radif-consisting poems and those are not radif-consisting. WeÂ studied various types of radifs in all khaghani's Divan as well. Then it is proved that the frequency of his radif-consisting poems is higher than the other with no radif. Statistical analysis shows that 815 of 1212 khaghani`s poems consistÂ radifs.This numberÂ equals 20/68% of his all poems. Study of radif in different form showes that poem with radif appreciably are more predominant than poems without radif. 81/77% of Ghazels, 39/64% ofÂ odes, 88/54% ofÂ quatrains/rubais, 22/64%Â of fragmentsÂ and 66/79% of his small odes have radif. The types of radif in Khaghani's poem includes: verb, noun (noun phrase, letters, adverbs, pronouns, adjectives and phrases, or sentences (such as overnight. But the verb type (70% is mostly used in his poetry. In this articleÂ we discussed the functions of radif in khaghani' poems and concluded that the main functions ofÂ radif in his poetry are as follows: 1- Creating unity between poet and audience When the reader can guess the word (or phrase in a particular situation, he will find himself as a contributor in\n\nâSketches of landscapesâ: On philosophical poems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTroy Jollimore\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Is it possible to do philosophy by writing lyric poemsâor reading them? How can a poem be genuinely philosophical, and can a philosophical poem do something that straightforward philosophical writing cannot do? Some have suggested that poems and philosophical writings have different aims and are subject to different and conflicting demands, which would render it difficult if not impossible to write a successful philosophical poem. I suggest that while this is true with respect to the aims of the standard academic philosophical journal essay, there is a different way of doing philosophical workâone that pays close attention to actual thought processes and that dramatizes the interplay of ideasâthat lyric poetry is quite well suited to take on. Such work may be significant not only in helping us better understand human consciousness, but in letting us grasp insights and aspects of our experience of the world which the philosophical demand for simple, unified theories might otherwise tempt us to minimize or ignore altogether.\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM): feasible as reoperation following Heller myotomy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVigneswaran, Yalini; Yetasook, Amy K; Zhao, Jin-Cheng; Denham, Woody; Linn, John G; Ujiki, Michael B\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of performing peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the management of recurrent achalasia after failed myotomy. Eight patients presented to our institution between October 2010 and June 2013 with recurrent/persistent symptoms after prior laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Three patients underwent redo laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and five patients consented to redo myotomy with POEM. Demographics were similar between the groups with exception of age (POEM 69.5 vs. laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) 34.5, pâ=â0.003). Preoperative Eckardt scores, motility, and prior interventions were not significantly different. Three patients who underwent POEM and two who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy had prior fundoplication. There was one perforation identified after laparoscopic Heller myotomy and one patient with persistent subcutaneous emphysema after POEM. Both POEM and laparoscopic Heller myotomy demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms and Eckardt scores at average follow-up of approximately 5 months (pâmyotomy even in the presence of prior fundoplication. The procedure can be performed safely using a similar technique as for primary myotomy with the exception of creating the myotomy laterally along the right side of the esophagus and lesser curvature avoiding the previous anterior myotomy.\n\nA Cellular Universe: Douglas Livingstone's Collected Poems, A ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThe publication of Douglas Livingstone's collected poems enables readers to see that his skill and control of his craft grew in strength and scope over the nearly forty years of his publishing career.

POEMS syndrome is an uncommon cause of it. POEMS syndrome is a rare disease involving multiple organs. In differential diagnosis of portal hypertension, POEMS syndrome should be considered especially when other symptoms such as numbness, organomegaly, endocrine alteration and skin changes also present, as it is highlighted by our case. We report a 46-year-old Chinese male, a teacher, presenting with portal hypertension. Electromyography revealed peripheral neuropathy. Immunofixation showed monoclonal immunoglobulin A lambda protein. The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome was established. After treatment of lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone over 2Â years, the patient achieved a considerable improvement. This case highlights the manifestation of portal hypertension in POEMS syndrome. Lenalidomide with or without dexamethasone is effective for portal hypertension due to POEMS syndrome, though esophageal and gastric varices seems not reversible so easily.\n\nSweeping Hearts: Writing Poems Inspired by Native American Music and Poetry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRaby, Elizabeth\n\n1995-01-01\n\nStates that having students write poems while listening to a cassette tape of \"Earth Spirit\" by R.

In the present study, we found that tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), a key regulator of bone matrix properties and composition that also inhibits terminal osteoblast differentiation, strongly inhibited POEM expression in the mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. TNF-Î±-induced down-regulation of POEM gene expression occurred in both time- and dose-dependent manners through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) pathway. In addition, expressions of marker genes in differentiated osteoblasts were down-regulated by TNF-Î± in a manner consistent with our findings for POEM, while over-expression of POEM recovered TNF-Î±-induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. These results suggest that TNF-Î± inhibits POEM expression through the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and down-regulation of POEM influences the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by TNF-Î±.\n\nExpression of POEM, a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation, is suppressed by TNF-{alpha}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTsukasaki, Masayuki [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan); Yamada, Atsushi, E-mail: yamadaa@dent.showa-u.ac.jp [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan); Suzuki, Dai [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan); Aizawa, Ryo [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan); Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 2-1-1 Kitasenzoku, Ohta, Tokyo 145-8515 (Japan); Miyazono, Agasa [Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 2-1-1 Kitasenzoku, Ohta, Tokyo 145-8515 (Japan); Miyamoto, Yoichi; Suzawa, Tetsuo; Takami, Masamichi; Yoshimura, Kentaro [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan); Morimura, Naoko [Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198 (Japan); Yamamoto, Matsuo [Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 2-1-1 Kitasenzoku, Ohta, Tokyo 145-8515 (Japan); Kamijo, Ryutaro [Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa, Tokyo 142-8555 (Japan)\n\n2011-07-15\n\nHighlights: {yields} TNF-{alpha} inhibits POEM gene expression. {yields} Inhibition of POEM gene expression is caused by NF-{kappa}B activation by TNF-{alpha}. {yields} Over-expression of POEM recovers inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by TNF-{alpha}. -- Abstract: POEM, also known as nephronectin, is an extracellular matrix protein considered to be a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation.

In addition, expressions of marker genes in differentiated osteoblasts were down-regulated by TNF-{alpha} in a manner consistent with our findings for POEM, while over-expression of POEM recovered TNF-{alpha}-induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. These results suggest that TNF-{alpha} inhibits POEM expression through the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway and down-regulation of POEM influences the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by TNF-{alpha}.\n\nHow Viral Poems are Annotated : On âOCDâ by Neil Hilborn\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nvan der Starre, K.A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn How Viral Poems are Annotated: On âOCDâ by Neil Hilborn Kila van der Starre explores how, where and by whom viral poems are annotated.

Although the time in Boratynskyâs poem Eda is poetically clichÃ©d, some folklore meanings still can be traced in the dates atmosphere of the âmagicalâ spring. In all three poems the author demonstrates the destructiveness of love passion in the destiny of the heroines. In the romantic poems Eda and The Ball the theme of love temptations is developed by contrasting motifs of darkness of the night and glowing âlightâ of the romance. At a decisive moment for the heroines the artifact of the Orthodox culture presents a certain barrier from the fatal step, a reference point in attesting the Truth. As the logic plot of the examined poems indicates, the possibility of happiness in the life tainted by the sin is negated in Boratynskyâs artistic world. The poetics of night determines the dynamics of the poems Eda and The Ball. A calendar way of thought characterizes the large epic genres and organizes the plot of Tsyganka (The Gypsy (Easter, July, the Christmastide fun and the Eve of Lent, which is a kind of attempt to the authorâs âeclecticâ novel in prose. Boratynsky diverges from literary and cultural traditions not only in the development perspective of a romantic plot, but also in the semantics of winter and blizzard.\n\nPOEM APPRECIATION LEARNING MODEL IN INDONESIA EXPLORATION STUDY AND NEEDS ANALYSIS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSukini\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Poem Appreciation is a compulsary course at Indonesian Language and Literature Education Department of higher education.

Since the first modern human cases were published in 2008, around 2,000 cases have been performed worldwide. This technique requires advanced endoscopic skills and a learning curve of at least 20 cases. POEM is highly successful with over 90Â % improvement in dysphagia while offering patients the advantage of a low impact endoscopic access. The main long-term complication is gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with an estimated incidence of 35Â %, similar to the incidence of GER post-laparoscopic Heller with fundoplication. Although POEM represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of achalasia, more long-term data are clearly needed to further define its role in the treatment algorithm of this rare disease.\n\nLanguage and folklore in Hamid Mosaddeqâs poem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIRAN\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract\"Standard language\", \"sub-standard language\" and \"meta-standard language\" are the language types of many varieties. Use of sub- standard language in making poetry, known as âstylistic deviationâ, is one of the ways of highlighting poetic language. More attention to this technique of language in the contemporary period was paid by Nima. Nima believed that all words have the potentiality to enter the realm of poetry. No word is essentially poetic or non-poetic, but the way of using words by the poet determines its poetic value.Hamid Mossadegh by the use of sub-standard language elements, in addition to increasing the richness of his poems, made them closer to the mind, language and life of people. Folkloric elements of Mosaddeqâs poems were divided into seven groups: 1 Slang words, 2 common and spoken vocabulary 3 Irony and Proverbs 4 Tlfzhay popular 5 allusion to folk tales 6 folk beliefs and customs 7 local vocabulary.Slang words in poems Mosaddeq in the \"verb\" and \"noun\" have been examined. Many folk verbs such as \"Shangidan\" and \"gap zadan (to chat\" in Mosaddeqâs poems have been applied. Some of folk verbs in his poems are in such a way that at first, one could not understand the point. These verbs have several meanings that one or more specific meanings are slang, like verb \"gereftan (to get\" that means \"to grow the root of the plant\" has slang sense.There is an abundance application of folk nouns in Mosaddeqâs poem. Some of the nouns used in Mosaddeqâs poem, considering their figurative meanings, can be investigated in the folk nouns group, like \"foot\" in the figurative sense of \"will\".\"Colloquial and current words are of the most frequent elements of folk words in the poetry of Mosaddeq. These words in the category of \"nouns\" and \"verbs\" could be analyzed. Lexical verbs such as \"to hip\" and \"Perfume of Moskow\" are of this kind. \"Irony and Proverbs\" are the other folk elements of the poetry of Mosaddeq. \"till eye can see\n\nAn Analysis Of BehÃ§et Necatigilâs Poem TÃ¶re\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerhat ÃiftÃ§i\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available (1960. The poem consists of six units with four lines for each. The theme is the hindering of the selfâs desires due to individual and social reasons. In the units, the sweeping of the selfâs desires into subconsciousness is told stage by stage in accordance with psychoanalitic data and the hindering factors are presented through their justifications. We hear the self (ego and super ego speak to reveal the conflict experienced with an omniscient point of view and refer to the traditional morals of the society as the ultimate hinderer. The id (sub-self is claimed to have been imprisoned in the âlower roomâ, through which the poem acquires a tangible aspect, and through scientific facts, the poem is positioned within a poetical frame. Containing some elements of harmony in a structural unity, the poem bears the traces of Necatigil from his intellectual background and linguistic style. In this context, it is possible to evaluate the poem TÃ¶re in line with other poems of Necatigil where the themes of loneliness, being introverted, being unable to realize individual and social desires are frequently told in an implied way.\n\nPeroral Endoscopic Myotomy in Children: First Experience With a New Triangular Knife.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNabi, Zaheer; Ramchandani, Mohan; Chavan, Radhika; Tandan, Manu; Kalapala, Rakesh; Darisetty, Santosh; Reddy, Duvuur Nageshwar\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a novel treatment modality for achalasia cardia. The procedure is technically challenging and time consuming. Recently, a new triangle tip knife (TTJ) has been introduced, which is equipped with water jet facility. In the present study, we analyzed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of POEM in children with new triangle tip knife. We retrospectively evaluated the data of children (18 years or younger) who underwent POEM using TTJ knife at our institution. All POEM procedures were performed under general anesthesia in an endoscopy suite. Technical feasibility, safety, efficacy, and procedure duration were assessed. Ten children (4 boys, 6 girls) with mean age of 14.2âÂ±â2.74 (9-18) years, underwent POEM with TTJ knife. The subtypes of achalasia cardia were type I (4), type II (5), and type III (1). Two children had prior treatment with pneumatic balloon dilatation. POEM was performed via anterior route in majority of children (70%). Mean operating time was 47.6âÂ±â19.74 (30-98) minutes with no significant difference between anterior and posterior approaches to POEM (48.57âÂ±â24.01 vs 45.3âÂ±â3.51; Pâknife equipped with water jet technique.

Methods: We performed a review of the literature of POEM with a special focus on technical details and the results obtained with this technique in patients with achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders. Results: Thousands of POEM procedures have been performed worldwide since its introduction in 2008. The procedure is based on the creation of a mucosal entry point in the proximal esophagus to reach the cardia through a submucosal tunnel and then perform a myotomy of the muscular layers of the cardia, esophagogastric junction and distal esophagus, as performed in a Heller myotomy. The clinical remission rate ranges from 82 to 100%. Although no randomized studies exist and available data are from single-center studies, no differences have been found between laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM and POEM in terms of perioperative outcomes, short-term outcomes (12 months and long-term outcomes (up to three years. Procedure time and length of hospital stay were lower for POEM. Post-POEM reflux is a concern, and controversial data have been reported compared to LHM. The technique is safe, with no reported deaths related to the procedure and an adverse event rate comparable to surgery. Potential complications include bleeding, perforation, aspiration and insufflation-related adverse events. Thus, this is a complex technique that needs specific training even in expert hands.

A Doris Kareva poem is analysed to determine how (rather than what it means, identifying bonds of meaning created by sound and ambiguity as much as by syntactic or lexical relations. Two translations are analysed which suggest that a poem cannot be captured in the transferral of a graspable message or isolated lexicalised concepts, nor through the skilful handling of poetic devices. A third translation is proposed that aims to replicate the lexical, semantic and phonetic strands that constitute the coherence of the original while also generating ambiguity as a bound and binding feature of the new poem. Finally, the poem is posited as the presence of meaning, manifest in the effects it produces that make us attend to it as a poem.\n\nTreatment of esophageal achalasia in children: Today and tomorrow.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCaldaro, Tamara; Familiari, Pietro; Romeo, Erminia Francesca; Gigante, Giovanni; Marchese, Michele; Contini, Anna Chiara Iolanda; Federici di Abriola, Giovanni; Cucchiara, Salvatore; De Angelis, Paola; Torroni, Filippo; Dall'Oglio, Luigi; Costamagna, Guido\n\n2015-05-01\n\nEsophageal achalasia (EA) is a rare esophageal motility disorder in children. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) represents the treatment of choice in young patients. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is becoming an alternative to LHM. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and outcomes of POEM vs LHM in treatment of children with EA. Data of pediatric patients with EA, who underwent LHM and POEM from February 2009 to December 2013 in two centers, were collected. Eighteen patients (9 male, mean age: 11.6 years; range: 2-17 years) were included. Nine patients (6 male, mean age: 10.7 years; range: 2-16 years) underwent LHM, and the other 9 (3 males, mean age: 12.2 years; range: 6-17 years) underwent POEM procedure. Mean operation time was shorter in POEM group compared with LHM group (62/149 minutes). Myotomy was longer in POEM group than in LHM group (11/7 cm). One major complication occurred after LHM (esophageal perforation). No clinical and manometric differences were observed between LHM and POEM in follow-up. The incidence of iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux disease was low (1 patient in both groups). Results of a midterm follow-up show that LHM and POEM are safe and effective treatments also in children. Besides, POEM is a mini-invasive technique with an inferior execution timing compared to LHM.

Avicenna was a sage who was skilled in poetry in addition to philosophy and medicine. He wrote two different types of poetry: those meant to be enjoyed for their literary qualities of novelty and imagination, and his didactic Urjuzeh. Didactic poems are different from poetry evoked by imagination and feeling. In didactic poetry, the poets want to learn science and philosophy, whether spiritual, ethical or practical to the readers. Rhyme and poetry were often used for scientific writing in Avicenna's era, and were considered a method for memorizing scientific information and raising students' interest in difficult scientific concepts. Verse was used to simplify the didactic content, ease memorization and make difficult scientific issues more attractive. In medieval Persia, students of medicine had learned the basics of philosophy before starting medical courses. Poetry could help the students memorize the poem itself in combination with its meaning, in a way that was better and easier than prose. Avicenna's masterpiece, UrjuzehTebbi, comprises a perfect course in traditional Persian medicine in rhyming text written in Arabic. This great work was translated into Persian at the research centre for traditional medicine and history of medicine. We hope that the Persian translation of Urjuzeh Tebbi will allow students and experts to better appreciate the role of didactic poems in compiling and transmitting the concepts of Iranian medicine.\n\nÃÃ¢r-Ender-ÃÃ¢r Poems in Classical Turkish Literature\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTOPAL, Ahmet\n\n2017-01-01\n\nÃÃ¢r-ender-Ã§Ã¢r is a Persian term, which means quartet and four in four.

Mozafar Al Nawwab, the contemporary Iraqi poet, is one of them. Nawwab grew up in a noble and gentle Shia family in Iraq. From his family, he inherited an interest in literature and music and also political views to resist tyranny and colonialism. Also, he was influenced by revolutionary Shia beliefs which are based on Imam Aliâs views and the devotions of Imam Hussein. In his youth, he became a follower of Communism because he found Communism close to his ideals at that time. Therefore, his poem corresponded with his aims and ideals to reach equality and freedom and to end oppression. Nawwab was jailed and tortured several times and was forced to emigrate from Iraq to different countries. Â The language of Nawwabâs poems is colloquial and fluent, but after the defeat of Arab countries by Israel and the occupation of Palestine, his poems were influenced by revolutionary views and resistance literature. This influence was to such an extent that he was called Palestine poet. Nawwab sharply criticizes Arab leaders and governments- especially Gulf countries â for their failure to deal with Palestine occupation and the disorders in Arab countries. Such criticisms led to his works being banned in these countries. On the other hand, his poems are full of admiration and praise for revolutionaries, devotees, and martyrs. He calls for following martyrs and resisting enemies to reach freedom and equality. He calls for defeating the occupiers and resisting colonial powers. In this study, we intend to examine the manifestations of resistance literature.

This study compared the outcomes of POEM with that of the standard laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia. Achalasia patients treated by POEM or LHM were retrospectively analyzed, with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 3 years. Perioperative outcomes and long-term outcomes including treatment success (Eckardt score â¤3), occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (GerdQ score â¥9) and quality of life (36-item short form) were compared. Thirteen patients who underwent POEM were compared with 18 patients who received LHM. These patients were similar in age, sex, symptoms duration, Eckardt score, and previous therapy (all P>0.05). Mean myotomy lengths were similar (P=0.73). Operation time was shorter in the POEM group (P=0.001). One patient (7.7%) developed pneumothorax after POEM and 1 patient (5.6%) experienced postoperative infection after LHM (P=1.00). Treatment success was achieved in 83.3% (9/12) of POEM patients and 80.0% (12/15) of LHM patients (P=1.00). Both POEM and LHM significantly reduced Eckardt score (both P=0.00). GERD rate was similar (8.3% vs. 6.7%, P=1.00). There was no difference in all aspects of quality of life between the 2 groups. Long-term outcomes indicate that POEM is an effective treatment that is comparable with LHM. More data of randomized trials comparing POEM with LHM will enrich the existing evidence.\n\nEVANGELICAL IMAGES AND MOTIFS IN SERGEY ORLOV'S POEMS ABOUT THE BATTLE OF KULIKOVO (IN COMPARISON WITH ALEXANDER BLOK'S CYCLE OF POEMS \"ON THE FIELD OF KULIKOVO\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSvetlana Olegovna Zakharchenko\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The Battle of Kulikovo is one of the most significant events in Russian history. This article studies five poems by Alexander Blok and Sergey Orlov devoted to this battle. Alexander Blok's cycle of poems On the Field of Kulikovo prophetically predicts future changes in Russia. Sergey Orlov's poems devoted to this historical event can be seen as a certain indicator of his creative evolution. The image of the homeland, as well as the image of his wife (widow, both in Blok's and Orlov's poems originates from the image of the Mother of God. Images of a celestial body used by both poets are associated with military paraphernalia and arise from the evangelical images, while the warrior image is based on the evangelical image of brotherhood.

These functions display the literary and aesthetic value of adverbs. Adverbs are almost found in any sentence as they imply various concepts and have numerous structures. Adverbs imply tense, place, quality, quantity, question and status conceptually. Â Adverbs are structurally classified into two groups: simple and combined. They usually have a variable place and function in sentence. They come at the beginning, middle or the end of sentences. They, therefore, have different functions in sentences. Knowing this special feature very well, poets take great advantages of adverbs in their works. The place of adverbs in verse strictly depends on the arrangement of lines and rhymes in a classic style. However, the place of adverbs in contemporary poetry is free from such constraints. Â Iranian illustrious Poet, Nima Yushij begins quite a bit of his contemporary poems with adverbs which are called initial adverbs for the purposes of this study. The findings of the study show that he mostly uses adverbs of place, time and status. This research studies the reasons why Nima begins his poems with adverbs. Obviously, there are several explanations for this. One reason may be spacing which gives poems a sense of storytelling. Many descriptions in narrative poems are used to space the poems. As adverbs have different meanings and structures, they play an important role in descriptions. It can be said that there are almost always adverbs where there are descriptions. Other possible reason may be the necessity of rhyme and rhythm. Nima composes a significant number of his contemporary poems syllabically and by breaking rhyming adverbs in polysyllabic lines or other classical forms. Accordingly, he greatly\n\nComplete heart block in a patient with POEMS syndrome: A case report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFarzaneh Ashrafi\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available BACKGROUND: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal syndrome (POEMS is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with plasma cell dyscrasia. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of paresthesia and progressive weakness of extremities. Diagnosis of POEMS syndrome was made for him on the basis of clinical presentation, additional physical findings, typical sclerotic bone lesion, and bone marrow findings. In last admission, he explained episodes of dyspnea and chest pain that associated with frequent premature ventricular contraction in his electrocardiograph. Patient heart monitoring showed some episodes of complete heart block. Infra-His atrioventricular block in electro-physiologic study was detected. He had no history of ischemic heart disease. His cardiopulmonary findings on examination were normal. All results of cardiac biomarkers and serum electrolytes and repeated echocardiography were within normal range. Cong red staining of rectal fat pad biopsy was negative. After pacemaker insertion radiation of sclerotic bone, lesion started for him, but radiotherapy was ineffective, and he expired with respiratory failure. Complete heart block in POEMS syndrome has not been reported previously, and it is the first POEMS case with complete heart block. CONCLUSION: Complete heart block is a cardiac manifestation of POEMS syndrome.

Radif as one of the pillars of the side music, has played a major role in classical Persian poetry, and Persian poets haveÃÂ shown greatÃÂ attention to composingÃÂ radif-consistingÃÂ poems, since ancient times. In the early Persian poetry, radif is used slightly but the more the Persian poetry completed, the more application of radif have seen, and gradually, poets intended to use simple types instead of those complicated. One of the poets who have shown special attention to using radif and its application forms are of high-frequency in his poems, is khaghani. In this essay, we have tried to analyzeÃÂ Khaghani's poem statically. For this purpose, we have provided accurate statistics of the radif-consisting poems and those are not radif-consisting. WeÃÂ studied various types of radifs in all khaghani's Divan as well. Then it is proved that the frequency of his radif-consisting poems is higher than the other with no radif. Statistical analysis shows that 815 of 1212 khaghani`s poems consistÃÂ radifs.This numberÃÂ equals 20/68% of his all poems. Study of radif in different form showes that poem with radif appreciably are more predominant than poems without radif. 81/77% of Ghazels, 39/64% ofÃÂ odes, 88/54% ofÃÂ quatrains/rubais, 22/64%ÃÂ of fragmentsÃÂ and 66/79% of his small odes have radif. The types of radif in Khaghani's poem includes: verb, noun (noun phrase, letters, adverbs, pronouns, adjectives and phrases, or sentences (such as overnight. But the verb type (70% is mostly used in his poetry. In this articleÃÂ we discussed the functions of radif in khaghani' poems and concluded that the main functions ofÃÂ radif in his poetry are as follows: 1- Creating unity between poet and audience When the reader can guess the word (or phrase in a particular situation, he will\n\nA rare cause of pericardial effusion and ascites: POEMS syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBilal Katipoglu\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available POEMS syndrome is an important paraneoplastic syndrome associated with multisystem involvement.

This topic has received much attention both in the history of poetics and aesthetics as well as in recent studies on sad films and sad music. However, poetry and aesthetic evaluations of joyful and sad poetry have received only little attention in empirical studies to date. We collected beauty and liking ratings for 24 sad and 24 joyful poems from 128 participants. Following previous studies, we computed an integrated measure for overall aesthetic appreciation based on the beauty and liking ratings to test for differences in appreciation between joyful and sad poems. Further, we tested whether readers' judgments are related to their affinity for poetry. Results show that sad poems are rated significantly higher for aesthetic appreciation than joyful poems, and that aesthetic appreciation is influenced by the participants' affinity for poetry.\n\nPOEM: Identifying joint additive effects on regulatory circuits\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaya eBotzman\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Motivation: Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL mapping tackles the problem of identifying variation in DNA sequence that have an effect on the transcriptional regulatory network. Major computational efforts are aimed at characterizing the joint effects of several eQTLs acting in concert to govern the expression of the same genes. Yet, progress towards a comprehensive prediction of such joint effects is limited. For example, existing eQTL methods commonly discover interacting loci affecting the expression levels of a module of co-regulated genes. Such âmodularizationâ approaches, however, are focused on epistatic relations and thus have limited utility for the case of additive (non-epistatic effects.Results: Here we present POEM (Pairwise effect On Expression Modules, a methodology for identifying pairwise eQTL effects on gene modules. POEM is specifically designed to achieve high performance in the case of additive joint effects. We applied POEM to transcription profiles measured in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells across a population of genotyped mice. Our study reveals widespread additive, trans-acting pairwise effects on gene modules, characterizes their organizational principles, and highlights high-order interconnections between modules within the immune signaling network. These analyses elucidate the central role of additive pairwise effect in regulatory circuits, and provide computational tools for future investigations into the interplay between eQTLs.Availability: The software described in this article is available at csgi.tau.ac.il/POEM/.\n\nUyghur face recognition method combining 2DDCT with POEM\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYi, Lihamu; Ya, Ermaimaiti\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn this paper, in light of the reduced recognition rate and poor robustness of Uyghur face under illumination and partial occlusion, a Uyghur face recognition method combining Two Dimension Discrete Cosine Transform (2DDCT) with Patterns Oriented Edge Magnitudes (POEM) was proposed. Firstly, the Uyghur face images were divided into 8Ã8 block matrix, and the Uyghur face images after block processing were converted into frequency-domain status using 2DDCT; secondly, the Uyghur face images were compressed to exclude non-sensitive medium frequency parts and non-high frequency parts, so it can reduce the feature dimensions necessary for the Uyghur face images, and further reduce the amount of computation; thirdly, the corresponding POEM histograms of the Uyghur face images were obtained by calculating the feature quantity of POEM; fourthly, the POEM histograms were cascaded together as the texture histogram of the center feature point to obtain the texture features of the Uyghur face feature points; finally, classification of the training samples was carried out using deep learning algorithm. The simulation experiment results showed that the proposed algorithm further improved the recognition rate of the self-built Uyghur face database, and greatly improved the computing speed of the self-built Uyghur face database, and had strong robustness.\n\nUSING POETRY AS A MODEL FOR CREATING ENGLISH POEMS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYasemin KÄ±rkgÃ¶z\n\n2008-10-01\n\nFull Text Available This article describes how poems can effectively be used in English language classesto reinforce studentsâ knowledge of the English language - vocabulary and grammar- andfoster their creative writing.

Akhmatova\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDarya V. Krotova\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The article compares the poem Â«What spring in August?..Â» by V.Shalamov and Â«Fabulous autumn has built high dome...Â» by A. Akhmatova. It is proved that the two poems are dedicated to artistic interpretation of a similar psychological phenomenon â the feeling of spring, which suddenly appears in autumn (Shalamov â the eve of the autumn, in August. It is identified and analyzed a common theme as related features, significant differences in the interpretation of the two poets. It is suggested that Shalamov, creating a poem, remembered Akhmatovaâs interpretation, as evidenced by its appeal to the characteristic of Akhmatovaâs poetic techniques, for example, special semantic load of the final lines of the poem. Akhmatova corresponds to the text and specific stanzas of the poem by Shalamov. It is proved that the âdialogueâ with Akhmatova and Shalamov is not accidental, and being in the art world so distant from each other, at first glance, creative people can see not only the obvious differences, but also the depth of intersection. Particular attention is given to the interest of Shalamov to acmeist poetics. It is proved that the closest to Shalamovâs poetry was the realization of laws of acmeism presented in the lyrics by Akhmatova. It is marked in the article parallels of art worlds of Shalamov and Akhmatova and proved how deep Shalamov is connected with the highest achievements of art of the Silver Age.\n\nThe Water Symbolism in the Poem âMemento Moriâ by Eminescu\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElena Golovanova\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The item is devoted to the research of a philosophical poem by M. Eminescu âMemento moriâ in connection with the related artistic and philosophic phenomena of the national and European literatures. The article analyses the sociohonic poem âMemento moriâ which depicts the cyclicity of the human civilizations. The nascence of any civilization has in its origin one of the basic elements, among which Water is paid particularly attention to. These elements (Earth, Water, Fire bearing material genesis combined with the Spirit are giving birt h to the civilization. In the poem âPanorama of Futilityâ extremely diverse appears the imaging of water symbols. In this case water, river, sea are integral part of Greece genesis. The image of Water stands for the symbol of eternity. As another symbolic embodiment for Water river and stream appear often in the work. A symbol of time flowing into eternity in the poem is the river Danube.\n\nPhilosophy as Verse-Performance: five poems and a formalist prospectus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristopher Norris\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article consists of five poems and an introductory essay. The poems are intended on the one handÂ to make a case for the currently underratedÂ virtues ofÂ poetic formalism, i.e., for the revival of rhyme and meter as aspects of poetic practice. On the other they argue for aÂ distinctlyÂ philosophical mode ofÂ poetry that embraces the values of conceptual orÂ rational discourse as against a romantic-modernistÂ conception premised on the intrinsicÂ superiority of lyric, metaphor, symbol, analogy,Â and suchlike touchstone values. These issues are laid out programmaticallyÂ in the opening essay and developed in a more performative as well as formal way in the five poems.\n\nGriceâs Conversational Implicature: A Pragmatics Analysis of Selected Poems of Audre Lorde\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdaoma Igwedibia\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A number of works have been done by scholars on the study and interpretation of Audre Lordeâs poetry, especially through the lens of literary and critical analysis. However, Lordeâs poems have not been analyzed pragmatically. A lot may have been written about Lordeâs poetry, but there is absolutely no evidence of a pragmatics study of her work. Lorde is the author of many poems that have been studied in various theoretical dimensions, but none have been done with reference to their pragmatics implications. The problem which this research recognizes, therefore, is that Lordeâs poems, especially the ones under the present study, have not been studied and interpreted using Griceâs theory of Conversational Implicature (Cooperative Principle which is comprised the four maxims: the maxims of Quantity, Quality, Manner and Relation. This study seeks to discover the extent to which these maximsÂ could be applied to the reading of the selected poems of Lorde. It also seeks to ascertain the degree to which Lordeâs selected poems violate or adhere to these maxims. The study has found that Audre Lorde in some of her poems, violates the maxims as well as adheres to them both in the same breath.\n\nTHE ICONOGRAPHIC COLOUR SYMBOLISM IN BIBLICAL POEMS BY SERGEI YESENIN\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNatalia Vladimirovna Mikhalenko\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The Biblical poems by Sergei Yesenin are full of pathos of theurgic reforms and creation of a new world. All components of these poems (images, spatial-temporal organization, colour symbolics stressed the importance of ongoing changes. The colours in small poems not only correspond to normal natural colours, but also bear a symbolic meaning, drawing the reader to the iconographic mysticism. The colourful preferences correspond to the tradition (of the Old or New Testaments, iconography or liturgy, as well as scenic tradition, which Yesenin follows in his poetry. Creating images of cosmic transformation, the poet turns to the traditional icon colour combinations and reinterprets the Old and New Testaments images. It puts the cases of prophet Sergei Yesenin in line with the acts of the biblical prophets. All poems in their colour scheme are consistent with iconographic tradition. In these poems three basic colours are used which repeat the colours of thematically close icons. So, Th e Coming is coloristically associated with the icon of the Nativity, The Transfiguration corresponds to the eponymous icon of Christ. The colours show the relationship and the parallelism of the processes occurring in earthly and heavenly worlds. It emphasizes the unity of the poetic world, the engagement of the Earth and the Heaven in the conversion process. The consideration of Yeseninâs revolutionary epic in line with biblical and iconographic symbolism allows analyzing in a more detailed and deep way originality of poetic recreation of the World and enables to reveal philosophical and esoteric content of the works.\n\nLoss of Image in Translating Chinese Poem into English\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nææ §è³\n\n2012-01-01\n\nããThe process of translating Chinese poem into English is actually the process of the transference of image. Image is the soul of poetry. In translating the poem there often exists a phenomenon that is loss of image. So there are some questions to be discussed, such as:the definition of image, the reasons of loss of image, and the way to avoid losing image. This thesis will discuss the questions from three aspects:language difference, culture difference and factors of translator.\n\nA text analysis of the poems of Sylvia Plath.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLester, David; McSwain, Stephanie\n\n2011-08-01\n\nChanges in the words used in the poems of Sylvia Plath were examined using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a computer program for analyzing the content of texts. Major changes in the content of her poems were observed over the course of Plath's career, as well as in the final year of her life. As the time of her suicide came closer, words expressing positive emotions became more frequent, while words concerned with causation and insight became less frequent.\n\nTechnology in Ahmad AziziÃ¢ÂÂs Poems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaryam Shabanzadeh\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFull Text Available ÃÂ Abstract Nowadays technology has extended all over the humanÃ¢ÂÂs life and has affected even his language. It seems that a new language is propagated within people especially among youth which utilizes the words or compositions related to technology. Metaphor, metonymy and is used in these compositions. These words were first applied in ironies but later on it has been perceived in people conversations and even within the poems. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate the Today Ã¢ÂÂ s language structure and also the effects of technology on the language. Ahmad AziziÃ¢ÂÂs poems are chosen for this study. In this content the main question is how greatly the human and machine relation is affected the human conversation and specifically on the Ahmad AziziÃ¢ÂÂs poems. The theory in the current paper is that there should be a relation between the technology and language in Ahmad AziziÃ¢ÂÂs poems. The method here is to find and study the effect of words related to technology, such as automobile and its content, telephone and other means of communication devices and also urban lifestyle, within the Ahmad AziziÃ¢ÂÂs poems. Investigations related to stylistics often perform in three methods of language, music and literature studies. However, in this paper we focused on the words and literature points and do not investigate the grammar and music. This research is merely descriptive and is not looking for the reasons for using those specific words. Ahmad Azizi made a breakthrough in utilizing the Today Ã¢ÂÂ s language. There are several words in his poems related to urban lifestyle and its hardships such as metro trains, highways, buses, speeding and traffics. There are a numerous effects of technology on human lifestyle, eating habits, costumes and human manners. Words which are related to machine parts such as Ã¢ÂÂsag dastÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂachar kalaghiÃ¢ÂÂ and etc can be seen in his poems.

The comparative effects of POEM and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) on esophagogastric junction (EGJ) physiology are unknown. A novel measurement catheter, the functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP), allows for intraoperative evaluation of EGJ compliance by measuring luminal geometry and pressure during volume-controlled distensions. Distensibility index (DI) (defined as the minimum cross-sectional area at the EGJ divided by pressure) was measured with FLIP intraoperatively in patients undergoing LHM and POEM. Separate measurements were taken after each operative step. During LHM, measurements were performed after: (1) induction of anesthesia, (2) insufflation of pneumoperitoneum, (3) hiatal dissection and esophageal mobilization, (4) myotomy, (5) partial fundoplication, and (6) deinsufflation. During POEM, they were performed after: (1) induction of anesthesia, (2) submucosal tunnel creation, and (3) myotomy. Eleven LHM and 14 POEM patients underwent intraoperative FLIP. Baseline DI was similar between groups. LHM resulted in an overall increase in mean DI (pre 1.4 vs. post 7.6 mm(2)/mmHg, using a 40-ml distension volume; p Myotomy caused an increase in DI. Partial fundoplication (6 Toupet, 5 Dor) caused a decrease in DI, and deinsufflation caused an increase in DI. POEM also resulted in an overall increase in mean DI (pre 1.4 vs. post 7.9 mm(2)/mmHg; p myotomy caused increases in DI. When overall changes were compared, there were no differences in the amount of DI increase between LHM and POEM. POEM and LHM result in a similar improvement in EGJ distensibility intraoperatively. Further study is needed to correlate intraoperative FLIP measurements with postoperative symptomatic and physiologic outcomes.\n\nTranslations of Poems by Yang Lian\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMabel Lee\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Biographical note on Yang Lian Yang Lian grew up in Beijing and began to establish his credentials as a poet from 1979.

Astillero\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFull Text Available To better understand the Filipino way of life, it is imperative to study the literature of the Philippines specifically the poetry of Sorsogon for it serves as a receptacle and a showcase of cultural characteristics, values, and traditions of SorsogueÃ±os. The contemporary times showcase SorsogueÃ±osâ literature proliferating trilingually in English, Filipino and the vernacular. The desire for self- expression in any language seems to describe that literature is the most effective way to identify what comprises a meaningful human life. This study analyzed and extracted the cultural characteristics and values manifested in SorsogueÃ±os poems. This is a descriptive qualitative study using documentary and content analysis of the works of SorsogueÃ±osâ poets in terms of the cultural characteristics and values manifested in them. The researchers collected 22 published poems in the 16 municipalities of Sorsogon. Analysis of the poems showed the following cultural characteristics viz: SorsogueÃ±os are very religious; they are very sentimental and emotional; very passionate and lovable; optimistic and have positive viewpoint in the future. They are also risk-takers; have regards on the welfare of others, nationalistic have sense of brotherhood/comradeship and full of hope despite hardships in life. Values embodied in the analyzed poems consist of the elements of hospitality, comradeship, nationalism, unselfish love, confidence, ingenuity, courtesy, hopes, aspirations, dreams, culture, and traditions of SorsogueÃ±os.\n\nPer-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) After Previous Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy Is Feasible and Safe in a Porcine Model.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiles, Luke F; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C; Dua, Kulwinder S; Jensen, Eric S; Kastenmeier, Andrew S\n\n2015-10-01\n\nWe sought to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and difficulty of performing the per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) procedure in the setting of a prior Heller myotomy using a survival porcine model. Four pigs underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy with Dor partial anterior fundoplication followed by the POEM performed 4 weeks later. Two additional pigs served as controls, undergoing only the POEM. All procedures were completed without complications. The revisional POEM was not significantly more difficult than POEM controls based on procedure time, POEM procedure components, or procedure difficulty scores. Revisional POEM had a longer mean operative time when compared with Heller myotomy (126.0 vs. 83.8 min; PHeller myotomy is safe and feasible in the porcine model and has potential as an option for patients suffering from recurrent or persistent symptoms after failed surgical myotomy.\n\nSometimes I AM (On reading the poem âMcDonaldâsâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaweÅ PrÃ³chniak\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The present sketch proposes an interpretation of one of the most important poems of the early poetry written by Marcin Åwietlicki. At the same time, the reading of the poem is paired with a simultaneous analytical interpretation providing the standard analytical scheme usually applied to any poetical work (this scheme is based on a sequence of recognitions that refer to: 1. writing, 2. euphony, 3. semantics of spaces concentrated with meaning, 4. the structure of the presented world. A presentation of the four fundamental steps in the analysis is accompanied with a reflection on the paradox of interpretation, the corresponding model of which is in the poem the outlined mirror image of identity between the âopaqueâ depth and âovertâ surface.\n\nWoman in Khalil Motran\\\\'s poem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nzahra soleymanpoor\n\n2015-02-01\n\nIn explaining the subject of woman, his genre is romanticism that proposes the highest emotions and senses of the poet.

The \"Diponegoro\" poem is one of the phenomenal works that, if the contents are reviewed, alive and exist in a fighting spirit, the spirit of nationalism. In this postmodern era, the poetry of âPrince Diponegoroâ by Chairil Anwar is still exist as poem which fights for its country. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative with content analysis techniques. Conclusion: 1. Poetry \"DIPONEGORO\" is the poem with struggling spirit. In this case, it was the fight of Diponegoro against the Netherlandsâ colonialism. His nationalism, his love and obedience, his loyalty for his country, had led Diponegoro onto resistance because he wanted to liberate his people, from the domination and the grip of foreign power, the Netherlands. 2. The poem of âDiponegoroâ cannot be separated from the history of the past, the resistance of the people of Java against the Netherlandsâ colonialism.\n\nThree withered leaves, three sad poems (GarczyÅski, Lenartowicz, Asnyk\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWojciech Hamerski\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This text provides an interpretation of three poems, written by nineteenth century poets, that share a common theme of Autumn, with a particular attention given to the motif of a withered leaf. The author is interested how the poems in question match the elegiac convention of autumn lyric poetry and, at the same time, how each in its own way tries to overcome this convention. In OdpowiedÅº na list written by Stefan GarczyÅski, the acceptance of passing is concurrently met with defiance, expressed in a language of paradoxical metaphor. Teofil Lenartowicz in his LiÅcie zwiÄdÅe breaches the formal elegiac tone with the application of underlying vitalistic overtones included in the poem. Adam Asnykâs ZwiÄdÅy listek, through a superposition of metonymies, achieves the effect of multilayered mediation and erasure of the trace of experience. The reading and understanding of the three poems, composed in Romanticism and post-Romanticism periods, make it possible to observe, fragmentarily of course, the multiplicity of different poetic attitudes that accompany the process of re-enchantment of the world.\n\nHeroism in three Old English poems: A Christian approach\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCatherine Woeber\n\n1995-03-01\n\nFull Text Available It has been contended that the value system and terminology of Old English heroic poetry were not suitable vehicles for the later religious poetry, that their Germanic garb ill-fitted the Christian poems. This view, however, does not take cognisance of the the fact that there exists a Christian heroism in its own right. Only Christian scholarship can fully account for this phenomenon and show how the subject matter of this poetry is consonant with the heroic diction and formulae in which it is couched. Three Old English poems dealing with aspects of Christâ saving ministry will be examined to show that Christ is depicted as a hero bringing victory through suffering in Godâs plan of salvation, rather than as a heroic warrior as he is usually regarded, fighting in the armour of the Germanic hero. A close study of these poems shows that the authors understood Christian heroism to mean more than brave battling on the side of God; rather, it is complete submission to the will of God.\n\nSymbol of Undetermined Faith. A Note on Aleksej KruÄÃ«nyxâs Vowel Poem âHeightsâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDenis CrnkoviÄ\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Denis CrnkoviÄâSymbol of Undetermined Faith: A Note on Aleksej KruÄÃ«nyxâs Vowel Poem âHeightsââThis article looks at Aleksej KruÄÃ«nyxâs poem âVysotyâ (Heights. Consisting entirely of vowels culled from the Church Slavic version of the âSymvol Veryâ (the eastern Nicene Creed the poem has been traditionally examined as a prime example of the transrational expression (zaumâ of the Futurist movement. As such, analyses have tended to focus on the phonic and phonemic features of the poem with little attention paid to the relationship between the source text and the poem itself. Thus, âmissingâ or âtransferredâ vowels in the poem have often been regarded as mistakes or dismissed as the result of KruÄÃ«nyxâs artistic whim. The paper therefore examines the poem in the context of its Church Slavic antecedent, concentrating on those places where the vowels of the poem diverge from those of the Creed. A close analysis of the apparent anomalies between poem and prayer reveals a sophisticated level of word-play that hinges on a complete understanding of the source text and the manipulation of the source vowels. Moreover, our research shows that in the broader context of the antipathy between the Symbolist and Futurist movements, each missing or transposed vowel constitutes a crucial hint for grasping a hidden significance in the poem and for understanding KruÄÃ«nyxâs revamped statement of belief as a playful new literary âcreedâ that challenges the more âorthodoxâ literary tenets of the Symbolist poets.\n\nEccentricities: Outlying Poems that Reconstruct the Modern City\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlos Pittella\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article, using CesÃ¡rio Verde as a point of reference, presents diverse strategies of poetic reconstruction of the city via scansion and formal analysis of representative poems: âcidade/city/citÃ©â by Augusto de Campos, âOde Triunfalâ by Ãlvaro de Campos (heteronym of Fernando Pessoa, âAs Scismas do Destinoâ by Augusto dos Anjos, âPaisaje de la Juventud que Vomita (Anochecer en Coney Islandâ by Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca and âO Inferno de Wall Streetâ by Joaquim de SousÃ¢ndrade.
