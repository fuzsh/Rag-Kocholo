The lower epidermis can contain as many as 58,000 stom­ ata per square centimeter - that's 58,000 microscopic pores, inhaling and exhaling in perfect sync, all compressed into an area smaller than the tip of your finger. When you consider that a very different thriving community, the University of Southern California, encompasses 31,606 grads and under­ grads scattered over 186 combined acres of campus - well, the ratio is even more daunting to say the least. Sure, the scales are different. But for sheer operational effi­ ciency, there's something enviable, and humbling, about that leaf. It's a supremely fine-tuned operation. Locked in align­ ment, the stomata go about the daily business of photosyn­ thesis as their biological clockwork dictates, never falling vic­ tim to exhaustion or burnout.

We've a ll been planted here on this famous, reputable, incongruously pretty campus with the expectation that we will grow to enrich the world at large. We absorb lectures and readings as if they're ou r water and sunlight, expelling essays and bluebooks as proof of digestion. Productivity is the measure of suc­ cess, if not survival. Ir shouldn't be. The idea of students rolling to and from class like factory-engineered ciphers - on ly mar­ ginally less horrifying than the revelation that former Gov. Gray Davis ears a turkey sandwich without may­ onnaise for lunch every day - simply doesn't gel with the reality of life at USC. We need a new defin ition of to excel and our refusal to do so by fo llowi ng blueprints; one that allows us to expend energy in ways that don't seem especially efficient or even necessary - raking an illicit dip in rhe reAecting pool during finals week, for instance. Or making an ·t I p.m. excursion to Chane's, even if Trojan Grounds is still open and Figueroa looks shadier than usual. Or screaming our lungs out at a foot­ ball game, nor because we expect it to educate us, but because our team has a shot at a national championship and damnit, that matters. The difference lies in our mobility. It lies in our cre­ ativity. It lies in our freedom of choice. And finally, per­ haps, it lies in our memory, in the realization that life is not a process bur a journey, and that looking back is often photosynthesis, one that accommodates both our desire as profitable as looking ahead. opening+ 7 Primarily devoted to upperclass­ man hous­ ing. the seventh floor of Birnkrant Residential College is home to only a few freshmen.

In a few years, USC students will no longer recall the inconvenience of these old pol.icies.

From Reverse Osmosis to the Sirens, a cappella groups have taken USC by storm S cene: Tailgating revelers crowd around Tommy Trojan, taking a break from their barbecues and beers to be serenaded by the SoCal VoCals before the first home game of the year. Few of them are thinking, as they chant the SoCal Spellout, about the national accolades that USC's premiere a cappella group has won since its inception in 1996. But when the group launches into \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" one of their signature pieces, it becomes clear chat they are no mere vocal pep band. The VoCals are good. Very good. Scene: The cafeteria is filled to capacity, hundreds of students lingering over their dinners. Standing by the doors, the Sirens, the only all-female a cappclla group on campus, project their voices over the clang and clatter. They're fun, fas hionable and fearless, and paving the way by putting a Western spin on their music. \"We're alwa ys rethinking songs, adding a new move­ ment, making it more fun,\" said Reverse Osmosis' Casey Heim. This party-on-stage atmosphere lends itself easily to the musical selection, wh ich consists mostly of pop and rock songs. \"We sing Bob Marley to Radiohead to Dido,\" said Siren Katie Sippel, a junior majoring in music industry. \"We ha ve a very wide range, from oldies to the newest pop songs.\" But a cappella is much more than fun and games. Srudents arrange all of the music they sing, individually or in collaboration with other grou p members. \"lf someone has a song they want to arrange, they bring it to the group, play it, and the group they're hoping to lure a new generation of femmes fatales to join in their melody.

During these times, ca lled pitch­ ing sessions, songs are selected tO be added to the repertoire. tion room. Would-be members of Reverse Osmosis, the self-proclaimed \" hottest a cappella group on campus,\" fill out paperwork and steel nerves while waiting to be ca l.led inside. During the audition, singers have only a brief window of time to impress current group members with their stage presence and vocal per­ formance. Just how competiti ve have a cappella groups become? \"As many as 60 people audition,\" said the SoCal VoCa ls' Lisa Townsend, a senior majoring in public rela­ tions. \"We ca ll back anywhere from eight to 16 and take as few as one or as many as eight.\" Reverse Osmosis and the Sirens reported sim ilar droves competing for rela­ ti vely few open slots. All of which goes to show that a cappella music is no longer strictly an East Coast staple. Though the phe­ nomenon here is still relatively new, groups at USC are Once a song has been arranged, the group spends many hours rehearsing it before it is ready to be performed. Campus a cappella groups participate in both casual performances and prestigious competitions, vying for honors and awards. The Sirens hold Absolut A Cappella each spring at Bovard Auditorium, while Reverse Osmosis runs a showcase called Trading Voices. Perhaps the most important event, however, is the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappel la competition, participated in by more than 100 groups from the United States and Canada. But as stiff as the competition is, USC's a cappella groups stay true to their West Coast roots. \"We wanted to have another outfit for people to per­ form,\" said Reverse Osmosis founder Brendan Jennings, a senior majoring in music education and vocal arcs. \"We've shown that a cappella is open to everyone.\" + 18 + photosynthesis Reverse Osmosis senior John Herbert performs a solo at the group's weekly rehearsal outside University Bookstore (left).

There was nothing average about Esther Tea's own mid-semester vacation plans, but sand she did get. Lots and lots of sand. \"When I was a freshman, there were only three trips: Navajo Nation, Monterey and Death Valley,\" she said. \" I went to Death Va lley and fell in love with it. \" The three offerings chat Teo had to choose from were made possible by Alternative Spring Break, a Volunteer Center program that sends students across the nation - and in some cases, the world - to participate in service projects during that solitary class-free week in March. by justin chang Teo was a freshman when she and her teammates first set out on their ecological mission. Since then, the senior biological sciences major has gone back to Death Va lley every year, most recently in spring 2003, when she served as a trip coordinator with 17 other student volunteers. \"It's really interesting to go somewhere .. . and not be able to see anyone else or any buildings for miles,\" she said. \"At night, there's like perfect silence and you can look in the sky and see a ll the stars .. . It's just reall y, real­ ly peaceful.\" Peaceful is a strange word, however, to describe the work that volunteers frequently find themselves doing.

The 2003 program offered four sites in addition to Death Valley and Monterey - Navajo Nation in Monument Valley, Ut.; Catalina Island; Isle de las Mujeres, off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula; and Uruguay - attracting a total of 170 students. Each trip has a unique focus, different budget requirements and different living conditions, but every day follows a similar cycle: Rise early, work until mid­ afternoon, then cook and eat dinner before settling into a structured reflection time. \"[Volunteersl often turn to spiritual ity because of the nature of the trip,\" said Carley, whose Monterey ream was accompanied by Rabbi Susan Laemmle, dean of religious life. \" l think that just being in that situation forces people to deal with that.\" Long hours of physica lly and emotionally draining work - all compressed within the space of a week - have a fascinati ng effect on group dynamics. \"They're all just very passionate, motivated, enthusi­ astic people,\" Teo said. \"It's really great to build those lasting friend ships with people you meet.\" Michelle Blanchette, former director of the Volunteer Center, agreed. \"lt's nor about the service project, it's about forming relationships,\" sa id Miche lle Blanchette. \"We all suffer from cultu re shock when we get back ...

If housing is temporary, so is much of the program­ ming - the Volunteer Corps and the USC Family of Five Schools program were both recently cut from the center's activities roster. Popular outreach opportunities like Alternative Spring Break, by contrast, have only grown with rime. \"A couple years ago, we really looked at the Volunteer Center and it felt like some of the programs were very, very popular and very, very successful,\" Blanchette said. \"Some just [had us] banging our heads against the wall.\" Here a re a few of the programs the Volunteer Center currently offers, none of them scientifically known to induce head-banging. Friends and Neighbors Service Day: Volunteers devote their Saturday before the first week of fall class­ es to performing various service projects around campus and in the community. Much peer bonding ensues. Community Action Short-term Team: Better known as CAST, this program thrusts volunteers direct­ ly into the urban environment, where they do whole­ some things like clean up graffiti, renovate low-income homes and mentor underprivileged youth. Eggster: In collaboration with the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, the Volunteer Center lets students plan a day of fun in commemoration of the \"rites of spring\" - that means Easter egg hunts - for families in the neighborhood. - Justin Chang student life + 23 affairs S hould you ever decide ro spend a semester in Africa, you're bound to miss a few things - specifically, western toi lets. \"The bathroom was usually a porcelain hole in the ground that flushed and a bucket or faucet of water that you had to squat and use,\" sa id senior Michelle Romo, who studied in Tanzania in the fall. \"Or you had ro flush the toilet yourself with a bucker of water and hope rhar it went down.\" Clea rly, Romo didn't go to Tanzania to get comfort­ able. She went ro experience a culrure rhar was drasti­ cally different from her own, and to do something tan­ gible with her inrernational rc.·larions major.

Two additional programs, in Nicaragua and Valparaiso, C hi le, are expected ro be in place by next year. As long as srudenrs have earned ar lcasr a 3.0 grade­ point average and met a language requirement, they more or less have free rein in choosing a destinarion. For sen ior La Tesha Jones, spending rhe fall semesrer in Bilbao, Spain, was a di rect result of her decision last Continued 011 page 26 student life+ 25 foreign affairs Continued from page 25 year to major in Spanish. \"l knew that by immersing myself in a Spanish envi­ ronment, I would learn the language much faster, and could learn about the culrure firsthand,\" she said. There was plenty to learn, whether it was adj usting to life in a city where people never seemed to stop moving except during siesta hour, or adapting to the diet, which consisted mainly of pork. Most enlightening of all, how­ ever, were the Spanish people's perceptions of America . \"1 was once told that I came from the 'land of ham­ burgers,\"' she said. \"It's funny and sad at the same time, because I am not sure if we portray ourselves in a negative light or if others' views of us are tainted. \" Michelle Laug, a senior majoring in public relations, chose to study in Berlin for even more personal reasons. \" J wanted to become fluent in German because my par­ ents spoke Swiss-German but never made us speak it back, so l can only understand it,\" she said. Having spent considerable time in Switzerland, Laug felt well prepared for European li ving. She knew about the emphasis on recycling, the sma ll washing machines and refrigerators, the fees that grocery stores charged for shop­ ping carts. She didn't expect, however, to find herself so distanced from the people around her. \"It was frustrating when I would speak to Germans in German, but since they could tell I was American, they would respond in English,\" she said. Language barriers weren't the only symptoms of cross­ cultural friction. Living environments were also a challenge, as students accustomed ro an apartment with one or two roommates found themselves crashing in a tiny dorm room, or a house crowded with children. In Berlin, Laug barely saw her host parents, who were often as busy as she was, while in Bilbao, Jones spent hours practicing Spanish con­ versation with her roommates. What all these experiences have in common, however, is the way they expose students ro different ways of life - and, consequently, different perspectives on their own. \"It is really rewarding to learn about others cultures in their home country,\" Romo said. \"Actually living in a Third World country gave me a perspective that J could never get in an lR class.\" 26 + phorosymhesis Based on the Acropolis in Athens, Brandenburg Gate is the only remain­ ing city gate in Berlin, where senior Michelle Laug studied in the fall. + Photo by Michelle L.aug Seniors Ashley Snider and Noel Pietsch mimic the wildlife at Lone Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane, Australia. + Photo courtesy of Noel Pietsch Junior Sahar Fathi and senior Erandi Lopez examine wares at an outdoor market in Paris' sixth arrondissement (far left).

This is how James Kincaid teaches his classes, CORE 101: Constructions of Deviance and a Senior Honors Seminar in English Literature. By choosing topics of dis­ cussion, reading materials and, yes, their own grades, students are able to \"discover what they are interested in,\" Kincaid said. \"Ir truly is a class of self-discovery,\" said Ben Pack, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, for whom raking Kincaid's CO RE I 01 became inevitable after he sat in on the class during a high-school visit. \"Kincaid let me parriciparc in discussion, and even had me lead a studenr presenrarion,\" he said. Kincaid has always had a way of leading others inro our-of-the-ordinary situations. He regularly takes his classes to Big Bear, a pine paradise whose armosphere is most conducive to long discussions, colloquiums and by amberly scolt seminars. The primary purpose of these rcrrears, however, is to emphasize the importance of interpersonal bonds, which are created when people \"listen to orher people\" and participate in \"collaborative activities,\" he said . Given those crireria, how does Kincaid decide where to rake each class each year? \"Wherever I can swing a good deal,\" he said. For rhe record, Kincaid isn't all fun and frivoliry. He has nvice received rhe Guggenheim Fellowship during his long career and is also rhe winner of the English H onors Program Teaching Award, the Gamma Sigma Alpha prize for Professor of the Year and dozens of other reaching recognition awards and book prizes. Yet ro hear him speak, to see the gleam in his eyes, is to know that peo­ ple matter more to him than accolades. \"Jf I was nor a professor, I think that I would work for a social-service agency - work with children or the elderly,\" he said. Children have <l unique place in Kincaid's heart.

This is just one way Steve Lamy keeps his students on their roes - one more example of what the famed director of the USC School of International Relations would describe as \"active learning.\" Constantly asking questions, calling on each student two or three times in any given class period, Lamy makes his best effort to get to know every single one of his pupils. He even makes posters of all his students' pic­ tures and names to help him learn them all. The result has been a tremendous impact, both human and intellectual, on his srudenrs' education. \"Dr. Lamy inspi red me to pursue a major in interna­ tional relations,\" said junior Samuel B azzi, who added that the subject is only one of his many interests. \"Dr: Lamy is the most well-rounded professor I have come across in my 2 1/2 years at USC,\" he said. Well-roundedness seems natural for Lamy, who has had a healthy love for the outdoors since his days as a young Eagle Scour in New by alanna borrowman Hampsh ire. \"My thing was being in the woods: backpack ing, rappelling and stuff,\" he said of his youth. Lamy was also an avid lacrosse player and dreamed of playing professionally - that is, until he attended a 1964 Republican rally for then-presidentia l candidate Barry Goldwater. A paperboy at the time, Lamy was dutifully making his deliveries when a Secret Service agent pushed him out of the way, knocking him into the lap of Goldwater's wife, 1 viargaret. He cites this event as the starr of his political career. After graduating from high school, Lamy spent 16 months in Europe \"becoming politically aware. \"If you're in a rea lly small country like Belgium ... you rea lize how dependent you are on the outside world,\" he sa id. Upon his return fro m what he considers his political coming of age, Lamy attended and graduated from Sienna College with a master's degree in international relations, even though he had enrolled with the intention of studying law. He then taught at three different Colorado universities before coming to USC. Hundreds of students have come and gone in the meantime, bur Lamy's influence on them is profound. \"He encourages his students to engage him outside the classroom,\" Bazzi said. \"H is genuine concern for the student is truly unparalleled.\" + student life+ 45 media The Annenberg School of Journalism's new curriculum stretches students' reporting skills - and their workload I r began in the spring of 200- 1, when Michael Parks, former editor of the Los Angeles Times and inter­ im direcror of rhe Annen berg School of Journalism, framed a question for his faculty. \" I said, 'Do we have the curriculum we need for the 21st century?\"' he said . \"And the faculty, after a great deal of discussion, said, 'No, we don't.\"' The reaction was swift. B y the following fall semes­ te1; Parks had taken over full-rime and, with the help of journalism professor Joe Saltzman and several other faculty members, had devised a new core by eva tran curriculum for the school. From then on, a ll journalism students, the graduating class of 2004 excepted, would learn the basic tenets of reporting across all three major media - print, broadcast and online - regardless of concentration. Broadcast jour­ nalism majors would learn how to craft a newspaper story. Online journa lism majors would learn how to wield a camera. Parks pointed to the Web era and the media conver­ gence that has resulted as the impetus for the new cur­ riculum. \"There are very few of us who depend on one single source for the news and information chat we need co navigate life,\" he said. \"News organizations expect the people who are going co come into their newsrooms Continued on page 48 academics+ 47 mass media Continued from page 47 now to be able to work across at least two media, and maybe three.\" The result, a daunting six-unit, three-course block of reporting classes, has improved standardization, height­ ened the quality of spelling and grammar and allowed for the addition of such technological novelties as com­ puter-assisted reporting. But it's also has had its critics, most of them students. \"They do things at warp speed,\" said Heather Somers, a graduate student in online journalism. \"You feel like a jack of all trades and a master of none. \" \"It's rea lly difficulc that we have to learn three differ­ ent styles of writing at the same time,\" said Arielle Wolin, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism. \" It could be structured a lot better.\" Stella Ko, a sophomore majoring in broadcast jour­ nalism, proposed a compromise. \"They should make it so you have to take two of the three, but not all three,\" she said. \"We don't want to be spread thin .. we want to be good in our field.\" Bur being spread thin, Parks said, is an unavoidable facet of the business. He cites the example of ABC reporter Judy Muller, herself an Annenberg professor, who is expected to furnish stories not only for 20/20 and Nightline but radio and online outlets as well. Or Priya David, who graduated with a master's degree in broad­ cast journalism in May 2002 and now covers the Dick Gephardt presidential campaign for NBC News, MSNBC and MSNBC.com. \"Is it a lot of work? Yes. Ir's a hell of a lot of work,\" he said. \"What people are expected to do in a newsroom is a lot of work. They shouldn't be under any illusions that what they will be asked to do are three short stories in the course of a week. It might be three in a day.\" To provide students with as realistic a learning expe­ rience as possible, the core program also implemented mandatory lab hours. Working at Annen berg TV News had always been mandatory for broadcast journalism majors, but print journalism, on line journalism and pub­ lic relations majors had never been required to put in time at the Online Journalism Review or the Daily Trojan, which operates independent of Annen berg. Devon Sanceda, a junior majoring in public relations, doesn't attempt to hide her irritation about having to more work than any one of my core classes,\" she said. \"Ten hours a week is unfair to students and editors. It only makes up 10 percent of a two-unit class.\" \"I hear grumblings about this [program],\" said Blake Hennon, editor in chief of the Daily Trojan and a senior majoring in creative writing. \"At its heart, it's a good idea. Good for us, good for them.\" Of course, there is the ubiquitous but factor. Managing editor Peter Spalding attempts to match core students with their sections of interest, but naturally, cer­ tain sections have more raving fans than others. Some students don't care too much for commitment; they just rum in unsolicited and unassigned stories at the very end of the semester to get a grade. But the Daily Trojan - which has full authority to grade students on a pass-fail basis - is nor afraid to dish out complimentary \"fails\" as tokens of appreciation. \"Some have stepped up and done a good job, but some people feel put upon by the lab requirement, and treat it with less respect than they treat their home­ work,\" Hennon said. \"I don't understand that, especial­ ly from journalism students.

The title, business cards and desk come later - right now, they have the wardro be and the shoes. Clunk, clunk, clunk down Trousdale toward Exposition they march. Ranked 11th in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in 2003, the undergraduate business program continua lly produces successful execu- rives-in-training among the various disci­ plines that it offers. Much of the attrac­ tion to Marshall derives from its respec­ tive distinction on top of that of USC. \"T like Marshall's reputation,\" said by eva tran junior business major Basil Starodubtser, who has an emphasis in finance. \"Ir is considered a very good busi­ ness school withi n the business community.\" A transfer from George Washington University, Starodubtser is a staunch advocate of Marshall's signa­ ture 2.85 curve and all things Marshall. \"The curve makes Marshall very competitive in com­ parison to other business schools, especially compared to Stanford, Harvard, and the Ivy Leagues,\" he said.

It's a good way of filtering out the leaders,\" said Bahram Mahdavi, a senior majoring in political science with a minor in business. However, a contingent of Marshall srudents are nor too enthusiastic about how the curve works. Sometimes it takes a while - and the right, or wrong, combination of classes - to figure out just what kind of havoc this curve can wreak. Or, on the Aip side, what kinds of blessings it can bring. It may come in handy in difficult courses, but in notoriously easy ones, the curve causes much strife and heartbreak. \"Marshall emulates the real world, but I have mixed feelings about the curve,\" said Pamela Harris, a junior majoring in business with a concentration in informa­ tion systems. \"It's superficial.\" \"Students feel that Marshall is underrated,\" said Dmitri Nedelchev, a business major with an emphasis in finance. \"The curriculum is demanding and the 2.85 curve preventing inflation of grades makes it hard to maintain your G.P.A.\" The implications of the curve do serve to motivate Marsha ll students, facil itating the proactiveness and stu­ dent-professor interactions that prime each scholar for the negotiations of the business world. Conscientious students invariably end up schedu ling meetings with professors during office hours. \"What are my perceptions of Marshall undergradu­ ates? They are very focused,\" said Prisci lla Hernandez, an administrative budget assistant at Marshall. \"I work 54 + photosynthesis in the Center for 1 \\1anagement Communication, and l see how lvlarshall got its reputation as one of the best business schools in the nation ... Professors stay the long hours, and students and professors communicate on a first-name basis.\" Another selling point for Marshall is the network. It is the No. 1 rule of thumb for any wily business student, and quite the Marshall buzz word: Network, network, network. Current Marshall students networked even before they first climbed the front steps of Bridge Hall, the epicenter of the school. «Networking is smart,\" said Maricela Gil-Bugarin, a senior majoring in business with an emphasis in market­ ing. \"Before I came to this school, I talked to Marshall alumni, and they highly recommended it to me. \" \"Network. If you wane to stay in Los Angeles and make connections, go co Marshall,\" said Jeevaka Somaratne, a junior majoring in business with an emphasis in finance. The school practices what it preaches. Marsha ll pro­ vides plenty of opportunities to mingle with peers by assigning numerous group projects - to the chagrin of many a Marshall student. \"Group projects can be a hassle. You have to work around different personalities and time conflicts,\" said Harris, a 45-year~ old computer science analyst returning to school for her bachelor's degree. \"But you learn to deal with conflict in a professional way, and it's good practice because there are a lot of conflicts in the profes­ sional world.\" Peer evaluations inhibit those who would otherwise fa il to pull their weight from slacking off on the job.

The end came in the third overtime, when Killeen missed a 39-yard field goal attempt to the right and Fredrickson nailed his chance from 38 yards out to give Cal the upset win and send its fans storming onto the field. \"It's kind of bad when the same ream jumps out on you two years in a row,\" USC wide receiver Mike Williams said. \"This time they got us.\" + I r won't go down as one of the most inspirational performances in sports, but it was certainly a turn­ ing point in the Trojans' season. It was the beginning of the second half against Arizona State. The game was tied at 10-10. Matt Leinart came walking out of the tunnel gingerly, by himself, a few steps behind the rest of his teammates. It was the first time the 56,527 at Sun Devil Stadium had seen the jun­ ior quarterback since he went into the locker room in the second quarter with a bruised knee and a sprained ankle. He paced the sideline and watched as the Sun Dev ils took a quick 17-10 lead in the third quarter. \" I didn't know if I would be a ble to play at first but I wanted to toughen it out,\" Leinart said. \" I knew my team needed me. \" While Marr Cassell, who had relieved Leinart in the first half, wa rmed up along with Brandon Hance, who thought he'd get the nod in the third quarter, it was Leinart who put his helmet on and jogged back onto the football field to cake control of his team . Noc only did he lead the No. 10 Trojans to a come­ back win on the road, 37-17, he earned the respect of his teammates in the process. \"He was in a lot of pain, I by arashk . mar az1 saw it,\" sa id defensive tackle Shaun Cod y. \"To sack it up when he knows we need him out there as the leader of our ream makes all the other guys around want to fight for him.\" Lcinart's first play of the second half was an 11 -ya rd completion to Mike Williams. He came back with a 12- yard pass co Hershel Dennis on the next play. Suddenly, a once-stagnant USC offense was beginning to gain ya rdage and confidence. The series ended with LenDale White scoring on a 25-yard touchdown run. White, who finis hed the game with 140 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries, allowed Leinart to sit back in the pocket and pick apart the Sun Devils defense. \"Our philosophy today was run the ba ll hard, run with aggression and set an attitude,\" said Wh ite, who had the most rushing yards by a true freshman in USC history. Leinarr fini shed the game completing 13 of 23 passes for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns, but at the end of the day, it was his roughness and leadership, not his stats, that won over his teammates. \"H e's will ing to go out there and compete for his team regard less of how his health is,\" said Kea ry Colbert, who had five catches for 100 yards and 1 touchdown. \" He wanted to go our there and win. \" + • no pain, • no gain Despite injuries, Matt Leinart leads USC to a comeback victory over Arizona State Quarterback Matt Leinart eludes the grip of ASU defensive end Jimmy Verdon (above).

The Trojans were like shy grade­ school boys at their first dance, waiting for the girls to make the first move. Against Cal, it had left them lamenting what could have been. That all changed aga inst Stanford. The Trojans suddenly grew into men, going after every girl in sight from the moment they walked through the door. B y the time halftime arrived, the damage was done and USC was celebrating its 12th consecutive win at home and its 700th in school history. \" In the past, we didn't get started until the second half, so we wanted to get a quick start and that's what we did,\" said USC defensive end Kenechi Udeze, who had three sacks. \"We wanted to get out there and set a tempo.\" USC's dominating 44-21 win over Stanford in front of 68,341 at the Coliseum was, from start to finish, their most impressive performance of the season to dare. Before halftime, USC had a 44-14 lead over the Ca rdinal, and Mike Williams had already caught 7 pass­ es for 129 ya rds and 3 touchdowns. The victory, on a day that became known as \"Separation Saturday\" throughout the nation, catapult­ ed USC from ninth in the polls to one of the top five teams in the country by day's end. by arashk . mar az1 \"I think we are back in a big way,\" Coach Pete Carroll said. \"We made some big plays on offense all over the field. \" While the defense had been lavished with most of the attention ea rly on, USC's offense was clearly beginning to sreal the spotlight. And while John David Booty, an 18- yea r-old freshman quarterback who skipped his senior season of high school in Sh reveport, La., to come to USC, made his college debut ea rly in the fourth quarter, the attention was still on starting quarterback Matt Leinart. After being described as roo conserva ti ve and hesi­ tant by critics, Leinart showed he was quickly becoming more than just a stop-gap quarterback, completing 18 of 27 passes for 260 yards and 3 touchdowns, most of them in the first ha lf. \"We all know that he's our quarterback,\" said Williams, who finally began his push for the Heisman Trophy with his impressive first-half performance. \"As long as the guys in the locker room have confidence in hin1, then that's all that matters. The guys play hard for him.\" In addition to th rowing the ball at will against Stanford, USC ran right through the Cardinal defense as railback LenDale White ran for 108 yards and 2 touch­ downs, becoming the first freshman in USC history to ha ve back-to-back 100-yard rushing games. + A gainst college football's most storied pro­ gram and in the sport's most revered stadi­ um, USC had for yea rs entered their bien­ nial game at Notre Dame showing their opponents the respect accorded to an aging giant. As if they were confronting the Godfather, the overwhelmed Trojans were almost always done before they could even begin. USC had only walked our of Notre Dame Stadium once since 1981 with a victory. But that streak, along with any insecurities anyone may have had about this ream, were dashed by the time the fourth quarter rolled around as the No. 4 Trojans demolished the Irish, 45-14. No longer were the Trojans a second-half team wait­ ing for their opponents to make the first move. USC's offense, much maligned for being too conservative and one-dimensional, had grown into one of the most explo­ sive and balanced groups in the cou ntry. That was never more evident than during the first quarter, when USC exploded for three touchdowns on its first three possessions, the most points allowed by Notre Dame in a first quarter since 1998. Notre Dame, however, countered by scoring two touchdowns on its first two drives, making \"Touchdown Jesus\" as relevant as he'd been all season for the Irish. But then something scary happened. Early in the sec- by arashk . mar az1 ond quarter, the Trojans did something they usually wait until the third or fourth quar­ ter to do. Instead of trying to save each other, offense and defense began to feed off each other. The offense's touchdown drives were rewarded with three-and-ours by the defense, and the outcome was as dominating as the final result would indicate. \"When the offense is clicking like that, it makes it so much easier on the defense,\" USC defensive tackle Shaun Cody said. \"We weren't doing that at the begin­ ning of the year, and now we are and you can just see rhe difference.\" With great predecessors like Joe Theisman and Joe Montana \\vatching, Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn played every bit like the freshman he was, com­ pleting 15 of 34 passes for 168 yards. By contrast, Leinarr continued to cement his role as the hei r apparent to Carson Pa lmer, completi ng 26 of 34 passes for a career-high 351 yards and 4 touchdowns. lt was a dominating performance by a ream just start­ ing to learn to play as a team . \"This is just the beginning,\" Cody sa id. \"We're just beginning to find out how good we can be.\" \"1\" USC wide receiver Keary Colbert maintains a deathgrip on the ball as he barrels past Notre Dame's defense (left).
