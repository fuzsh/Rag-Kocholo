        "text": "Single-Site Nissen Fundoplication Versus Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSharp, Nicole E.; Vassaur, John\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the emergence of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of SILS Nissen fundoplication and compare its outcomes with traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication between January 2009 and September 2010. Results: There were 15 SILS and 18 traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures performed. The mean operative time was 129 and 182 minutes in the traditional laparoscopic and single-incision groups, respectively (P = .019). There were no conversions in the traditional laparoscopic group, whereas 6 of the 15 patients in the SILS group required conversion by insertion of 2 to 4 additional ports (P = .0004). At short-term follow-up, recurrence rates were similar between both groups. To date, there have been no reoperations. Conclusions: SILS Nissen fundoplication is both safe and feasible. Short-term outcomes are comparable with standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Challenges related to the single-incision Nissen fundoplication include overcoming the lengthy learning curve and decreasing the need for additional trocars.

Redo fundoplication improves patient symptoms, but its impact on patient quality of life remains unclear. We hypothesized that laparoscopic redo fundoplication improves disease-specific and global quality of life in patients with recurrent symptoms following failed laparoscopic or open fundoplication. Data for all patients undergoing a redo fundoplication between August 2009 and June 2014 were collected prospectively. Reflux symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptom Scale (GERSS), the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL), and the global quality of life Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires obtained at 4Â weeks and 16Â months post-operatively. Forty-six patients underwent laparoscopic redo fundoplication during the study period for symptomatic hernia (nÂ =Â 11), GERD (nÂ =Â 18), or dysphagia (nÂ =Â 17). GERSS improved from 41 at baseline to 9 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001), and GERD-HRQL scores improved from 30 at baseline to 7 at late follow-up (pÂ <Â 0.001). Median dysphagia scores decreased from 4.5 to 1 (pÂ =Â 0.035). SF-36 scores demonstrated a significant improvement in general health (pÂ =Â 0.016) and emotional well-being (pÂ =Â 0.036) and a trend toward improved physical function (pÂ =Â 0.068) in the post-operative period, but these improvements were not statistically significant at longer-term follow-up. Overall, 82% of patients reported satisfaction with their operation, and 96% reported that they would have the operation performed again given the benefit of hindsight. While associated with long operative times and significant complications, laparoscopic redo fundoplication produces a durable improvement in reflux symptoms and disease-specific quality of life. These procedures also improve global quality of life in the short term and are associated with high patient\n\nRandomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebecchi, Fabrizio; Giaccone, Claudio; Farinella, Eleonora; Campaci, Roberto; Morino, Mario\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo compare in a prospective, randomized trial the long-term results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus floppy-Nissen for achalasia. Anterior fundoplication is usually performed after Heller myotomy to control GER; however, the incidence of postoperative GER ranges between 10% and 30%. Total fundoplication may aid in reducing GER rates. From December 1993 to September 2002, 153 patients with achalasia underwent Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus antireflux fundoplication. Of these, 9 were excluded from the study. The remaining 144 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus anterior fundoplication (Dor procedure) or Heller laparoscopic myotomy plus total fundoplication (floppy-Nissen procedure). The primary end point was incidence of clinical and instrumental GER after a minimum of 60 months follow-up. The secondary end point was recurrence of dysphagia. Follow-up clinical assessments were performed at 1, 3, 12, and 60 months using a modified DeMeester Symptom Scoring System (MDSS). Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring were performed at 3, 12, and 60 months postoperative. Of the 144 patients originally included in the study, 138 were available for long-term analysis: 71 (51%) underwent antireflux fundoplication plus a Dor procedure (H + D group) and 67 (49%) antireflux fundoplication plus a Nissen procedure (H + N group). No mortality was observed. The mean follow-up period was 125 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical (5.6% vs. 0%) or instrumental GER (2.8% vs. 0%) were found between the 2 groups; however, a statistically significant difference in dysphagia rates was noted (2.8% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Although both techniques achieved long-term GER control, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication. This evidence supports the use of Dor fundoplication as the\n\nDoes concomitant anterior fundoplication promote dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy?\n\nPubMed\n\nTapper, Donovan; Morton, Connor; Kraemer, Emily; Villadolid, Desiree; Ross, Sharona B; Cowgill, Sarah M; Rosemurgy, Alexander S\n\n2008-07-01\n\nConcerns for gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia justify considerations of concomitant anterior fundoplication. This study was undertaken to determine if concomitant anterior fundoplication reduces symptoms of reflux after myotomy without promoting dysphagia. From 1992 to 2004, 182 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy without fundoplication. After a prospective randomized trial justified its concomitant application, anterior fundoplication was undertaken with laparoscopic Heller myotomy in 171 patients from 2004 to 2007. All patients have been prospectively followed. Pre and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia (including dysphagia, choking, vomiting, regurgitation, chest pain, and heartburn) using a Likert Scale (0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Before myotomy, symptoms of achalasia were frequent and severe for all patients. After myotomy, the frequency and severity of all symptoms of achalasia significantly decreased for all patients (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Notably, relative to patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy alone, concomitant anterior fundoplication led to significantly less frequent and severe heartburn after myotomy (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test) and to less frequent and severe dysphagia and choking (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms of achalasia. Concomitant anterior fundoplication decreases the frequency and severity of heartburn and dysphagia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Concomitant anterior fundoplication promotes salutary relief in the frequency and severity of symptoms after myotomy and is warranted.\n\nQuality of life and antireflux medication use following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBloomston, M; Zervos, E; Gonzalez, R; Albrink, M; Rosemurgy, A\n\n1998-06-01\n\nWith the advent of minimally invasive techniques, the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease has received renewed interest. The efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in eliminating reflux has been documented. This study was undertaken to determine changes in quality of life and cost of antireflux medications after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between 1992 and 1997 completed questionnaires assessing changes in pre- and postoperative cost and number of antireflux medications, reflux symptoms, and quality of life. The average number of antireflux medications was significantly reduced (1.8 versus 0.3, P < 0.0001) as was the average monthly cost ($170 versus $30, P < 0.0001). Patients reported significant (P < 0.05) symptomatic improvement in postprandial heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, postprandial nausea, postprandial vomiting, dysphagia, and gas/bloating. Patients in this series noted fewer symptoms and used fewer antireflux medications at less cost after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Symptoms commonly thought of as complications of fundoplication (vomiting, dysphagia, gas/bloating) were less common after fundoplication. This report documents the efficacy of laparoscopic fundoplication in improving quality of life and reducing use and cost of antireflux medications.\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Ling; Wong, Carol Wing Yan; Chung, Patrick Ho Yu; Wong, Kenneth Kak Yuen; Tam, Paul Kwong Hang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nData on laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants remain limited. We describe our experience with this operation in children and in particular, infants younger than 12 months old. Medical records of all paediatric patients who had laparoscopic fundoplication done for GERD from 1998 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on age: group I: 0-12 months, and group II >12 months. Data on indications, patient's demographics, operative time, blood loss, conversions, complications, recurrences and duration of hospitalization were studied. A total of 86 patients were reviewed (group I, n = 21; group II, n = 65). While the mean age and body weight for group I were 8 Â± 2.99 months and 6 Â± 1.96 kg, the values for group II were 98 Â± 65 months and 18 Â± 9.6 kg, respectively. All patients had concurrent laparoscopic gastrostomy for feeding difficulties. The mean operative time was shorter in group I (157 Â± 55 vs 169 Â± 52 min, p = 0.66). Both groups had minimal blood loss only. The surgical outcomes in both groups were comparable in terms of recurrence (0 vs 3 %, p = 0.105) and complications (9.5 vs 6 %, p = 0.275). The median follow-up duration for group I and group II was 23 and 40 months, respectively. Sixteen (76 %) patients in group I and 45 (67 %) patients in group II did not develop pneumonia post fundoplication. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be safely performed in infants with outcomes comparable to older patients and a shorter operative duration. Low recurrence rate (up to 3 %) is shown by our long term follow-up data. We recommend laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to be considered in managing infants with GERD.\n\nLaparoscopic calibrated total vs partial fundoplication following Heller myotomy for oesophageal achalasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMartino, Natale Di; Brillantino, Antonio; Monaco, Luigi; Marano, Luigi; Schettino, Michele; Porfidia, Raffaele; Izzo, Giuseppe; Cosenza, Angelo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAIM: To compare the mid-term outcomes of laparoscopic calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication with Dor fundoplication performed after Heller myotomy for oesophageal achalasia. METHODS: Fifty-six patients (26 men, 30 women; mean age 42.8 Â± 14.7 years) presenting for minimally invasive surgery for oesophageal achalasia, were enrolled. All patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy followed by a 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in 30 cases (group 1) and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in 26 (group 2). Intraoperative endoscopy and manometry were used to calibrate the myotomy and fundoplication. A 6-mo follow-up period with symptomatic evaluation and barium swallow was undertaken. One and two years after surgery, the patients underwent symptom questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 h oesophago-gastric pH monitoring. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, no significant difference in the median symptom score was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.66; Mann-Whitney U-test). The median percentage time with oesophageal pH < 4 was significantly higher in the Dor group compared to the Nissen-Rossetti group (2; range 0.8-10 vs 0.35; range 0-2) (P < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney U-test). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic Dor and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication achieved similar results in the resolution of dysphagia. Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication seems to be more effective in suppressing oesophageal acid exposure.

In our service, a laparoscopic fundoplication is performed as a 2-cm floppy 360 degrees wrap with division of the short gastric vessels and the fundoplication is sutured using a prolene 2/0 mattress suture (Ethicon, USA) and buttressed laterally with two teflon pledgets (PTFE 1.85 mm; low porosity, Bard, USA). We report a patient with post-operative dysphagia due to an esophagogastric fistula caused by erosion of a teflon pledget. This is the first such case in 734 laparoscopic fundoplications performed between January 1991 and December 1998. Reoperation was required, resulting in a prolonged convalescence. A review of current literature has not revealed any similar cases. Causes for this rare complication are postulated.\n\nUnconventional Management of Chyloascites After Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOspina, Karen A.; Lee, Earl H.; Rehring, Scott R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground & Objectives: Chyloascites is a rare complication that can result from abdominal trauma, neoplasm, inflammatory conditions, or various abdominal surgeries. Few cases have been described secondary to iatrogenic injury from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. We describe a case in which this surgery resulted in chyloascites that was successfully treated by lymphatic glue embolization. Methods: A 37-year-old male presented with signs and symptoms consistent with chronic reflux disease. He underwent an uneventful laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Two weeks postoperatively, he was admitted for dehydration. During his admission, he began to develop a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and abdominal distention. Imaging and fluid analysis from thoracocentesis and paracentesis were consistent with chyle leakage. Despite nonoperative measures, the patient's presentation persisted. Results: Thoracic duct ligation was performed without success. Bipedal lymphangiography identified an extensive leak revealing a severely lacerated thoracic duct spilling contrast freely into the abdomen and no contrast entering the thoracic duct in the chest. The site of injury was successfully sealed off with percutaneous glue embolization through lymph channels. Conclusion: Chyloascites is a rare complication of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. When not successful with conservative measures, lymphatic glue embolization can provide effective treatment.

Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy combined with fundoplication represents the treatment of choice for this disease, achieving good results in about 90% of patients. However, about 10% of treated patients refer persistent or recurrent dysphagia. Many Authors showed that this failure rate is related to inadequate myotomy. To verify, from experimental to clinical study, the modifications induced by Heller's myotomy of the esophago- gastric junction on LES pressure (LES-P profile, using a computerized manometric system. From 2002 to 2010 105 patients with achalasia underwent laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy followed by antireflux surgery. The calibrated Heller myotomy was extended for at least 2.5 cm on the esophagus and for 3 cm on the gastric side. Each step was evaluated by intraoperative manometry. Moreover, intraoperative manometry and endoscopy were used to calibrate the fundoplication. The preoperative mean LES-P was 37.73 Â± 12.21. After esophageal and gastric myotomy the mean pressure drop was 21.3% and 91.9%, respectively. No mortality was reported. Laparoscopic calibrated Heller myotomy with fundoplication achieves a good outcome in the surgical treatment of achalasia. The use of intraoperative manometry enables an adequate calibration of myotomy, being effective in the evaluation of the complete pressure drop, avoiding too long esophageal myotomy and, especially, too short gastric myotomy, that may be the cause of surgical failure.\n\nRandomized clinical trial of 270Â° posterior versus 180Â° anterior partial laparoscopic fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoks, D J; Koetje, J H; Oor, J E; Broeders, J A; Nieuwenhuijs, V B; Hazebroek, E J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPartial fundoplications provide similar reflux control with fewer post-fundoplication symptoms compared with Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The best choice of procedure for partial fundoplication remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of two different types of partial fundoplication for GORD. A double-blind RCT was conducted between 2012 and 2015 in two hospitals specializing in antireflux surgery. Patients were randomized to undergo either a laparoscopic 270Â° posterior fundoplication (Toupet) or a laparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication. The primary outcome was postoperative dysphagia at 12 months, measured by the Dakkak score. Subjective outcome was analysed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Objective reflux control was assessed before and 6 months after surgery. Ninety-four patients were randomized to laparoscopic Toupet or laparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication (47 in each group). At 12 months, 85 patients (90 per cent) were available for follow-up. Objective scores were available for 76 (81 per cent). Postoperative Dakkak dysphagia score at 12 months was similar in the two groups (mean 5Â·9 for Toupet versus 6Â·4 for anterior fundoplication; P = 0Â·773). Subjective outcome at 12 months demonstrated no significant differences in control of reflux or post-fundoplication symptoms. Overall satisfaction and willingness to undergo surgery did not differ between the groups. Postoperative endoscopy and 24-h pH monitoring showed no significant differences in mean oesophageal acid exposure time or recurrent pathological oesophageal acid exposure. Both types of partial fundoplication provided similar control of GORD at 12 months, with no difference in post-fundoplication symptoms. Registration number: NTR5702 (www.trialregister.nl).

When presenting symptoms are extraesophageal, there is less enthusiasm for operative control of reflux because of concerns of etiology and efficacy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in palliating extraesophageal symptoms of GERD. Patients were asked to score their symptoms before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication on a Likert scale (0 = never/none to 5 = always/every time I eat). A total of 322 patients with extraesophageal symptoms (asthma, cough, gas/bloat, chest pain, and odynophagia) of 4 to 5 were identified and analyzed. After fundoplication, all extraesophageal symptom scores improved (P < 0.0001 for all, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). Likewise, postoperative symptoms were noted to be greatly improved or resolved in 67 per cent to 82 per cent of patients for each symptom. Furthermore, after fundoplication, patients were less likely to modify their dietary (82% vs 49%) or sleeping habits (70% vs 28%) to avoid initiating/ exacerbating symptoms. Although extraesophageal symptoms are conventionally thought to be inadequately palliated by surgery, this study documents excellent relief of extraesophageal symptoms after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, denotes high patient satisfaction, and encourages application of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n\nBackflow prevention mechanism of laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication using high-resolution manometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoshino, Masato; Omura, Nobuo; Yano, Fumiaki; Tsuboi, Kazuto; Yamamoto, Se Ryung; Akimoto, Shunsuke; Kashiwagi, Hideyuki; Yanaga, Katsuhiko\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe use of multichannel intraluminal impedance pH (MII-pH) and high-resolution manometry (HRM), which are new devices used to examine the esophageal function, has recently become common in Europe and the USA, thus garnering much attention. There have not been enough studies as of yet, however, on the esophageal motor function and the benefits of treatment after these devices have been used in laparoscopic fundoplication. To use MII-pH and HRM to study the treatment effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication and consider a backflow prevention mechanism for laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication. The study looked at 27 of a total of 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication due to reasons of either gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophageal hiatal hernia between October 2012 and February 2014, who underwent a postsurgical HRM examination. Of these, 25 patients whose symptoms disappeared following surgery and who were not orally administered gastric secretion inhibitor (of whom nine were male, average age 55.9Â Â±Â 14.9Â years, and of whom 76Â % underwent MII-pH) were taken as the subjects of the study. The postsurgical evaluation was conducted 3Â months after the operation. Using HRM, although no change was noted in the lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) (pÂ =Â 0.943), an increase in lower esophageal sphincter pressure integral (pÂ =Â 0.024) and extensions in both overall length and abdominal length were noted (both pÂ <Â 0.001), while a significant improvement was noted in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Furthermore, the cases subjected to MII-pH demonstrated a reduced gastroesophageal reflux time, total number of liquid reflux episodes, and total number of reflux episodes (pÂ <Â 0.001, pÂ =Â 0.008, pÂ =Â 0.009). Backflow prevention mechanism of laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication is thus considered to improve the overall LES function without elevating LESP.\n\nIs Dor fundoplication optimum after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia? A meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Ming-Tian; He, Ya-Zhou; Deng, Xiang-Bing; Zhang, Yuan-Chuan; Yang, Ting-Han; Jin, Cheng-Wu; Hu, Bing; Wang, Zi-Qiang\n\n2013-11-21\n\nTo compare the outcome of acid reflux prevention by Dor fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for achalasia. Electronic database PubMed, Ovid (Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, EmBase and Ovid MEDLINE) and Cochrane Library were searched between January 1995 and September 2012. Bibliographic citation management software (EndNote X3) was used for extracted literature management. Quality assessment of random controlled studies (RCTs) and non-RCTs was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.1.0 and a modification of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. The data were analyzed using Review Manager (Version 5.1), and sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting each study. Finally, 6 studies, including a total of 523 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with other types of fundoplication after LHM (Dor-other group), and 8 studies, including a total of 528 achalasia patients, compared Dor fundoplication with no fundoplication after LHM (Dor-no group). Dor fundoplication was associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate of clinical regurgitation and pathological acid reflux compared with the other fundoplication group (OR = 7.16, 95%CI: 1.25-40.93, P = 0.03, and OR = 3.79, 95%CI: 1.23-11.72, P = 0.02, respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences between Dor fundoplication and no fundoplication in all subjects. Other outcomes, including complications, dysphagia, postoperative physiologic testing, and operation-related data displayed no significant differences in the two comparison groups. Dor fundoplication is not the optimum procedure after LHM for achalasia. We suggest more attention should be paid on quality of life among different fundoplications.\n\nGas-related symptoms after laparoscopic 360 degrees Nissen or 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as comorbidity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGranderath, F A; Kamolz, T; Granderath, U M; Pointner, R\n\n2007-04-01\n\nAerophagia is a rare but well-known comorbidity in patients with gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Particularly after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, it has proven to result in worse symptomatic outcome and a lower postoperative quality of life in comparison to patients without preoperative gas-related symptoms. Aim of the study was to compare the postoperative outcome in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as comorbidity after either laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication or 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication with main focus on the frequency and subjective impairment of gas-related symptoms. In 56 gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients, the comorbidity of aerophagia was diagnosed prior to laparoscopic antireflux surgery. Irrespective of their preoperative manometric findings, the patients were either scheduled to a laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen (n=28) or a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication (n=28). All patients have been analysed concerning the presence of gas-related symptoms preoperatively as well as 3 months after surgery. Additionally, the subjective degree of impairment was evaluated using a numerous rating scale (0=no perception/impairment, 100=most severe perception/impairment). The following symptoms have been analysed: ability/inability to belch, 'gas bloat', flatulence, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. Before surgery, there were no significant differences between both surgical groups. Three months after surgery, significant differences (p<0.05-0.01) were found: patients who underwent a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication suffered from less impairing gas bloat, flatulence and postprandial fullness when compared with patients with a 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication. The majority of these patients were able to belch postoperatively but felt no impairment due to this symptom. In contrast, patients of the Nissen group felt a significant impairment due to the\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy with or without partial fundoplication: A matter of debate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRamacciato, G; DâAngelo, FA; Aurello, P; Gaudio, M Del; Varotti, G; Mercantini, P; Bellagamba, R; Ercolani, G\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAIM: To present our experience of laparoscopic Heller stretching myotomy followed by His angle reconstruction as surgical approach to esophageal achalasia. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy; an anterior partial fundoplication in 17, and angle of His reconstruction in 15 cases represented the antireflux procedure of choice. RESULTS: There were no morbidity and mortality recorded in both anterior funduplication and angle of His reconstruction groups. No differences were detected in terms of recurrent dysphagia, p.o. reflux or medical therapy. CONCLUSION: To reduce the incidence of recurrent achalasia after laparoscopic Heller myotomy, we believe that Hisâ angle reconstruction is a safe and effective alternative to the anterior fundoplication.

This study aimed to develop a reusable, low-cost model to be used for training in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedure as an alternative to the use of animal tissue models. Methods From artificial organs and tissue, an anatomic model of the human upper abdomen was developed for training in performing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The 20 participants and tutors in the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) upper gastrointestinal surgery course completed four complementary tasks of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with the artificial model, then compared the realism, haptic feedback, and training properties of the model with those of animal tissue models. Results The main difference between the two training models was seen in the properties of the stomach. The wrapping of the stomach in the artificial model was rated significantly lower than that in the animal tissue model (mean, 3.6 vs. 4.2; pÂ =Â 0.010). The main criticism of the stomach of the artificial model was that it was too rigid for making a proper wrap. The suturing of the stomach wall, however, was regarded as fairly realistic (mean, 3.6). The crura on the artificial model were rated better (mean, 4.3) than those on the animal tissue (mean, 4.0), although the difference was not significant. The participants regarded the model as a good to excellent (mean, 4.3) training tool. Conclusion The newly developed model is regarded as a good tool for training in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedure. It is cheaper, more durable, and more readily available for training and can therefore be used in every training center. The stomach of this model, however, still needs improvement because it is too rigid for making the wrap.

This article reviews the current evidence about the outcomes in achalasia patients undergoing LHM with a partial anterior, a partial posterior, or a total fundoplication. We performed a review of the literature in PubMed/Medline electronic databases, which was evaluated according to the GRADE system. The results of the published randomized controlled trials show with a high level of evidence that the addition of a fundoplication reduces the risk of postoperative abnormal reflux, without impairing the food emptying of the esophagus. LHM with partial fundoplication is considered in most centers worldwide the standard of care for the treatment of patients with achalasia. The current evidence fails to show any significant difference between partial anterior and posterior fundoplication. In the absence of further large randomized controlled trial, the decision of performing an anterior or a posterior wrap is based on the surgeon's experience and preference. The addition of a partial fundoplication to LHM leads to a significantly lower rate of postoperative pathological reflux without impairing the esophageal emptying.\n\nAsymptomatic Partial Splenic Infarction In Laparoscopic Floppy Nissen Fundoplication And Brief Literature Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOdabasi, Mehmet; Abuoglu, Haci Hasan; Arslan, Cem; Gunay, Emre; Yildiz, Mehmet Kamil; Eris, Cengiz; Ozkan, Erkan; Aktekin, Ali; Muftuoglu, Tolga\n\n2014-01-01\n\nShort gastric vessels are divided during the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication resulting in splenic infarct in some cases. We report a case of laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication with splenic infarct that was recognized during the procedure and provide a brief literature review. The patient underwent a laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication. We observed a partial infarction of the spleen. She reported no pain. A follow-up computed tomography scan showed an infarct, and a 3-month abdominal ultrasound showed complete resolution. Peripheral splenic arterial branches have very little collateral circulation. When these vessels are occluded or injured, an area of infarction will occur immediately. Management strategies included a trial of conservative management and splenectomy for persistent symptoms or complications resulting from splenic infarct. In conclusion, we believe that the real incidence is probably much higher because many cases of SI may have gone undiagnosed during or following an operation, because some patients are asymptomatic. We propose to check spleen carefully for the possibility of splenic infarct.

Clinical data of 11 cardiochalasia patients who underwent combined laparoscopic-endoscopic lower esophageal sphincterotomy and modified Dor fundoplication by the same medical team from January 2015 to December 2016 at The Second Hospital of Jilin University were retrospectively analyzed. The procedure was as follows: an incision was made in the anterior wall of esophagus and dissection of esophageal muscular layer was performed, then the bulged esophageal mucosa was covered by the fundus after 180 degrees fold to the right (fundoplication), finally the gastric fundus was joined to the right diaphragmatic foot by 3 to 5 knotted suture. The efficacy was judged by the Eckardt scoring standard: the postoperative Eckardt score â¤3 points indicated effectiveness, otherwise the treatment was invalid. Combined laparoscopic-endoscopic lower esophageal sphincterotomy and modified Dor fundoplication was completed successfully in all the 11 patients without any subsequent laparotomy and death. The mean operative time was 85 (78 to 137) min, blood loss was 15 (5 to 35) ml, and no upper digestive tract perforation occurred. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.0(6 to 9) d. After the operation, the pressure of lower esophageal sphincter decreased significantly compared to that before operation [(5.31Â±6.23) mmHg vs. (35.72Â±17.13) mmHg, P<0.05], and the Eckardt score decreased significantly as well (0.53Â±0.56 vs. 6.17Â±1.17, P<0.05). During the follow-up of 2 to 23 months, there was no postoperative mortality. One case experienced mild gastroesophageal reflux 6 months after operation, and another patient had recurrent dysphagia 17 months after operation, who both were improved after receiving proton pump inhibitors or gastric dynamic drugs, and balloon dilation.

We prospectively compared anterior fundoplication (Dor) with partial posterior fundoplication (Toupet) in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy. A multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial was initiated to compare Dor versus Toupet fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Outcome measures were symptomatic GERD scores (0-4, five-point Likert scale questionnaire) and 24-h pH testing at 6-12Â months after surgery. Data are meanÂ Â±Â SD. Statistical analysis was by Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Freidman's test. Sixty of 85 originally enrolled and randomized patients who underwent 36 Dor and 24 Toupet fundoplications had follow-up data per protocol for analysis. Dor and Toupet groups were similar in age (46.8 vs. 51.7Â years) and gender (52.8 vs. 62.5% male). pH studies at 6-12Â months in 43 patients (72%: Dor nÂ =Â 24 and Toupet nÂ =Â 19) showed total DeMeester scores and % time pHÂ <Â 4 were not significant between the two groups. Abnormal acid reflux was present in 10 of 24 Dor group patients (41.7%) and in 4 of 19 Toupet patients (21.0%) (pÂ =Â 0.152). Dysphagia and regurgitation symptom scores improved significantly in both groups compared to preoperative scores. No significant differences in any esophageal symptoms were noted between the two groups preoperatively or at follow-up. SF-36 quality-of-life measures changed significantly from pre- to postoperative for five of ten domains in the Dor group and seven of ten in the Toupet patients (not significant between groups). Laparoscopic Heller myotomy provides significant improvement in dysphagia and regurgitation symptoms in achalasia patients regardless of the type of partial fundoplication. Although a higher percentage of patients in the Dor group had abnormal 24-h pH test results compared to those of patients who underwent Toupet\n\nA prospective cross-sectional study of laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease--a durable and effective anti-reflux procedure.\n\nPubMed\n\nShapey, I M; Agrawal, S; Peacock, A; Super, P\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic partial fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is reported to have fewer side effects when compared to Nissen fundoplication, but doubts remain over its long term durability in controlling reflux. The aim of this study was to assess outcome of symptoms for all patients presenting with GORD undergoing routine laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication. All patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication between August, 1999 and November, 2007 performed by a single surgeon were included in the study. The anti-reflux procedure studied was laparoscopic Lind (300Â°) fundoplication with crural repair in all cases. Patients completed pre and post-operative questionnaires containing validated scoring systems for heartburn, gas bloat, dysphagia and overall patient satisfaction. Over the 100-month period, 320 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic subtotal Lind fundoplication. Of these, 256 (80%) replied to the questionnaire at a mean of 31 months (range 3-96 months) following surgery. 91.4% of respondents had an improvement in heartburn symptom score with a significant reduction in score from 7.74 preoperatively to 1.25 postoperatively (p<0.001). There was also a significant reduction of mean modified Visick score for reflux control (heartburn and regurgitation) from 3.49 preoperatively to 1.48 after surgery (p<0.001). In total, 22 patients developed recurrent reflux symptoms with half of these reporting their recurrence within two years following surgery. Because of this all were tested with post-operative pH testing, yet only one had a 24-h pH time outside the normal range. Overall patient satisfaction was high with a visual analogue score of 9 and 88% of the patients claimed they would have the operation again. Laparoscopic Lind fundoplication demonstrates excellent reflux control when performed routinely for all patients presenting with GORD. This technique is both durable and efficacious in controlling reflux symptoms. Copyright Â\n\nLimited Hiatal Dissection Without Fundoplication Results in Comparable Symptomatic Outcomes to Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Anterior Fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeHaan, Reece K; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C\n\n2016-07-01\n\nPrevious randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that partial fundoplication following Heller myotomy results in less pathologic acid exposure to the esophagus when compared to myotomy without fundoplication. Recent studies have questioned the necessity of a fundoplication, especially when a limited hiatal dissection (LHD) is performed and the angle of His is preserved. This is a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data. All patients underwent primary Heller myotomy for achalasia over a 30-month period. In select patients, an LHD was performed anteriorly. Symptomatic outcomes were assessed up to 2 years postoperation using the Achalasia Severity Questionnaire (ASQ), Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL). A total of 31 patients underwent Heller myotomy during the study interval. The majority of patients underwent Heller myotomy with full hiatal dissection (FHD) (21, 68%). Intraoperative mucosal perforations occurred in 3 (14%) patients undergoing FHD. Patient demographics, surgery details, and baseline symptomatic outcomes did not differ significantly preoperatively. At greater than 1 year postoperation, there was no significant difference between the groups for ASQ, GERD-HRQL, and GIGLI (Pâ=â.76, .78, and .33, respectively). Heller myotomy with LHD and no fundoplication and Heller myotomy with FHD and partial fundoplication result in similar GERD-related quality of life outcomes. Further studies (including pH studies) are necessary to determine if fundoplication is a necessary step in selected patients in whom an LHD is possible.\n\nPredicting patient dissatisfaction following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication: an analysis of symptoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeenen, Edwin; Fogarty, Paul; Roberts, Ross H\n\n2013-05-01\n\nNissen fundoplication is a well-established treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a high success rate and a long-lasting effect. However, the literature reports that a persistent, small group of patients is not fully satisfied with the outcome. Identifying this patient group preoperatively would prevent disappointment for both patients and surgeon. This has proven difficult since dissatisfaction was related to nondisease-related factors instead of typical symptoms of GERD or the objective findings of investigations. We studied our series of patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to identify predictors of patient dissatisfaction and the impact of surgery on individual symptoms. All consecutive private patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication were asked to complete a preoperative and postoperative questionnaire concerning symptoms, medication use, and satisfaction. Demographics, investigations, complications, and reinterventions were documented. A standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed. Over an 11-year period 222 patients underwent surgery for GERD. The postoperative response rate to the questionnaire was 77.5 %, with dissatisfaction reported by 12.8 % of the patients. Of these dissatisfied patients, only 13.6 % had proven disease recurrence. Both satisfied and dissatisfied patients presented with an inconsistent pattern of symptoms. None of the preoperative symptoms and investigations or the patient's age and gender was predictive of postoperative dissatisfaction. Only postoperative heartburn, regurgitation, and bloating significantly correlated with patient dissatisfaction. Nissen fundoplication has a very high satisfaction rate overall. A small percentage of patients are not fully satisfied and dissatisfaction is associated with reported persistent symptoms and side effects of surgery rather than gender or preoperative symptom pattern, severity of esophagitis, or total 24 h esophageal acid exposure.\n\nNationwide survey of partial fundoplication in Korea: comparison with total fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Chang Min; Park, Joong-Min; Lee, Han Hong; Jun, Kyong Hwa; Kim, Sungsoo; Seo, Kyung Won; Park, Sungsoo; Kim, Jong-Han; Kim, Jin-Jo; Han, Sang-Uk\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic total fundoplication is the standard surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, partial fundoplication may be a viable alternative. Here, we conducted a nationwide survey of partial fundoplication in Korea. The Korean Anti-Reflux Surgery study group recorded 32 cases of partial fundoplication at eight hospitals between September 2009 and January 2016. The surgical outcomes and postoperative adverse symptoms in these cases were evaluated and compared with 86 cases of total fundoplication. Anterior partial fundoplication was performed in 20 cases (62.5%) and posterior in 12 (37.5%). In most cases, partial fundoplication was a secondary procedure after operations for other conditions. Half of patients who underwent partial fundoplication had typical symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis, and most of them showed excellent (68.8%), good (25.0%), or fair (6.3%) symptom resolution at discharge. Compared to total fundoplication, partial fundoplication showed no difference in the resolution rate of typical and atypical symptoms. However, adverse symptoms such as dysphagia, difficult belching, gas bloating and flatulence were less common after partial fundoplication. Although antireflux surgery is not popular in Korea and total fundoplication is the primary surgical choice for gastroesophageal reflux disease, partial fundoplication may be useful in certain conditions because it has less postoperative adverse symptoms but similar efficacy to total fundoplication.\n\nLaparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Anterior Fundoplication Improves Frequency and Severity of Symptoms of Achalasia, Regardless of Preoperative Severity Determined by Esophagography.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, Alexander; Downs, Darrell; Luberice, Kenneth; Rodriguez, Christian; Swaid, Forat; Patel, Krishen; Toomey, Paul; Ross, Sharona\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine whether postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication could be predicted by preoperative findings on esophagography. Preoperative barium esophagograms of 135 patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication were reviewed. The number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, and angulation of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) were determined; correlations between these determined parameters and symptoms were assessed using linear regression analysis. The number of esophageal curves correlated with the preoperative frequency of dysphagia, vomiting, chest pain, regurgitation, and heartburn. The width of the esophagus negatively correlated with the preoperative frequency of regurgitation. The angulation of the GEJ did not correlate with preoperative symptoms. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication significantly reduced the frequency and severity of all symptoms, regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or angulation of the GEJ. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication provides dramatic palliation for achalasia. More esophageal curves on preoperative esophagography correlate well with the frequency of a broad range of preoperative symptoms, including the frequency of dysphagia and regurgitation. Patients experience dramatically improved frequency and severity of symptoms after laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication for achalasia regardless of the number of esophageal curves, esophageal width, or the angulation of the GEJ. Findings on barium esophagogram, in evaluating achalasia, should not deter the application of laparosocopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication.\n\nImproved control of hypertension following laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Zhiwei; Chen, Meiping; Wu, Jimin; Song, Qing; Yan, Chao; Du, Xing; Wang, Zhonggao\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis study aims to determine whether successful laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can improve the control of hypertension. We conducted an observational study of GERD patients with hypertension. The esophageal and gastroesophageal symptoms of these patients were successfully treated with laparoscopic fundoplication, as measured by the reduced GERD symptoms and proton pump inhibitor consumption. A hypertension control scale was used to classify the use of antihypertensive medications and the quality of blood pressure control before and after anti-reflux surgery.Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used for the statistical analyses. Seventy GERD patients were included in the analysis and followed up for a mean period of 3.5 Â± 1.4 years. Prior to surgery, all participating patients were taking at least one class of antihypertensive medication, and 56 patients (80%) had intermittently high blood pressure. After surgery, the mean number of antihypertensive medication classes per patient was significantly reduced from 1.61 Â± 0.77 pre-procedure to 1.27 Â± 0.88 post-procedure (P < 0.001). The blood pressure of 48 of the 56 cases (86%) with preoperative intermittent high blood pressure returned to normal post procedure. A total of 50 patients (71%) recorded improvements on the hypertension control scale, with the overall mean score decreasing from 3.1 Â± 1.0 preprocedure to 1.4 Â± 1.0 post-procedure (P < 0.001). Therefore, successful laparoscopic fundoplication may result in better blood pressure control in some hypertensive GERD patients. This result suggests a possible connection between gastroesophageal reflux and hypertension.\n\nLong-term symptom control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 12 years after laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior partial fundoplication in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoks, D J; Broeders, J A; Baigrie, R J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic 180Â° anterior fundoplication has been shown to achieve similar reflux control to Nissen fundoplication, with fewer side-effects, up to 5 years. However, there is a paucity of long-term follow-up data on this technique and antireflux surgery in general. This study reports 12-year outcomes of a double-blind RCT comparing laparoscopic Nissen versus 180Â° laparoscopic anterior fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Patients with proven GORD were randomized to laparoscopic Nissen or 180Â° anterior fundoplication. The 12-year outcome measures included reflux control, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms and patient satisfaction. Measures included scores on a visual analogue scale, a validated Dakkak score for dysphagia and Visick scores. Of the initial 163 patients randomized (Nissen 84, anterior 79), 90 (55Â·2 per cent) completed 12-year follow-up (Nissen 52, anterior 38). There were no differences in heartburn, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms, patient satisfaction or surgical reintervention rate. Use of acid-suppressing drugs was less common after Nissen than after 180Â° anterior fundoplication: four of 52 (8 per cent) and 11 of 38 (29 per cent) respectively (P = 0Â·008). The proportion of patients with absent or only mild symptoms was slightly higher after Nissen fundoplication: 45 of 50 (90 per cent) versus 28 of 38 (74 per cent) (P = 0Â·044). The two surgical procedures provided similar control of heartburn and post-fundoplication symptoms, with similar patient satisfaction and reoperation rates on long-term follow-up.

To date, no population-based trend analysis has been reported examining the choice of procedure and short-term outcomes. This study was designed to analyze trends in the use of Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications, and corresponding short-term outcomes during a 10-year period between 1995 and 2004. A trend analysis was performed of 873 patients (Toupet: 254 patients, Nissen: 619 patients) prospectively enrolled in the database of the Swiss Association for Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. The frequency of the performed techniques remained stable during the observation period (p value for trend 0.206). The average postoperative and total length of hospital stay both significantly decreased during the 10-year period from 5.6 to 4.0 days and 6.8 to 4.8 days, respectively (both p values for trend <0.001). The average duration of surgery decreased significantly from 141 minutes to 121 minutes (p value for trend <0.001). There was a trend towards less complications in later years (2000-2004) compared to early years (1995-1999, p = 0.058). Conversion rates were significantly lower in later years compared with early years (p = 0.004). This is the first trend analysis in the literature reporting clinical outcomes of 873 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing Nissen and Toupet fundoplications during a 10-year period. The proportion of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications remained stable over time, indicating that literature reports of the advantages of one procedure over the other had minimal influence on surgeons' choice of technique. Length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, morbidity, and conversion rate decreased over time, reflecting the learning curve. Clearly, patient outcomes have much improved during the 10-year observation period.\n\nLaparoscopic fundoplication surgery versus medical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarg, Sushil K; Gurusamy, Kurinchi Selvan\n\n2015-11-05\n\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition with 3% to 33% of people from different parts of the world suffering from GORD. There is considerable uncertainty about whether people with GORD should receive an operation or medical treatment for controlling the condition. To assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical treatment for people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group (UGPD) Trials Register (June 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to June 2015), and EMBASE (1980 to June 2015) to identify randomised controlled trials. We also searched the references of included trials to identify further trials. We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic fundoplication with medical treatment in people with GORD irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review. Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with RevMan 5 based on available case analysis. Four studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, and provided information on one or more outcomes for the review. A total of 1160 participants in the four RCTs were either randomly assigned to laparoscopic fundoplication (589 participants) or medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors (571 participants). All the trials included participants who had had reflux symptoms for at least six months and had received long-term acid suppressive therapy. All the trials included only participants who could undergo surgery if randomised to the surgery arm. All of the trials were at high risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low.

The question then emerges whether anterior partial wrap has a similar antireflux effect with Nissen fundoplication (NF). We therefore conducted a randomized study to compare the long-term outcome of anterior fundoplication with NF. One hundred patients who enrolled in the trial from May 2003 to March 2005 were randomized to laparoscopic AF or laparoscopic NF. Endoscopy, pH monitoring, manometry, a detailed questionnaire, and a visual analog symptom score were completed preoperative at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgical procedures. The postoperative adverse effects such as dysphagia and flatulence were compared between the two groups. Revision surgery or maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy was defined as failure. Fifty procedures were performed in each group. The outcome at 5 years follow-up was determined for 96 patients (96%; 49 patients in the AF group and 47 in the NF group). Three patients (3%) died of unrelated causes during follow-up, and one patient changed address. Both fundoplications were found to provide good control of reflux-related symptoms in most of the patients. For 96 patients followed up more than 5 years, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were well controlled in 81 patients (84.38%); the mean DeMeester scores in the AF group decreased from 106.89 Â± 14.12 to 12.67 Â± 3.14 and in the NF group from 109.51 Â± 17.98 to 10.81 Â± 2.65, and the esophagitis was ameliorated visibly. Moreover, there were significantly fewer patients in the AF group who complained of flatulence. Compared with NF, anterior 180Â° partial fundoplication is an effective treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and associates with fewer postoperative adverse effects. Â© 2011 Copyright the Authors.

The optimal treatment for end-stage achalasia with esophageal dilation is still controversial. This multicenter and retrospective study aims to evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in patients with a massively dilated esophagus. Eleven patients (mean age, 56 years; 6 men) with massively dilated esophagus (esophageal diameter greater than 10 cm) underwent a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and anterior fundoplication between 2000 and 2009 at three different institutions. Preoperative workup included upper endoscopy, esophagram, and esophageal manometry in all patients. Average follow-up was 31.5 months (range, 3 to 60 months). Two patients (18%) had severe dysphagia, four patients (36%) had mild and occasional dysphagia to solid food, and five patients (45%) were asymptomatic. All patients gained or kept body weight, except for the two patients with severe dysphagia. Of the two patients with severe dysphagia, one underwent esophageal dilatation and the other a laparoscopic esophagectomy. They are both doing well. Heller myotomy relieves dysphagia in the majority of patients even when the esophagus is massively dilated.\n\n[Efficacy comparison of laparoscopic Nissen, Toupet and Dor fundoplication in the treatment of hiatal hernia complicated with gastroesophageal reflux disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Fuzeng; Zhang, Cheng; Ke, Limu; Wang, Zhi; Li, Yiliang; Li, Huiling; Du, Zhi\n\n2016-09-25\n\nTo compare the efficacy and safety among laparoscopic Nissen, Toupet and Dor fundoplication in the treatment of hiatal hernia complicated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Clinical data of 276 patients of hiatal hernia complicated with GERD undergoing operation in our hospital from December 2012 to January 2015 were retrospectively analyzed, including 149 patients of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (Nissen group), 41 of laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (Toupet group), and 86 patients of laparoscopic Dor fundoplication (Dor group). Esophageal reflux status, esophageal manometry, GERD Q rating scale, and postoperative recovery were compare among the three groups. Reflux status was improved significantly in the three groups after operation(all P<0.05),except that the efficacy in reducing reflux episodes and reflux longest time was not obvious in Toupet group(P>0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative reflux time, acid reflux time ratio, reflux longest time ratio, DeMeester score among the three groups (all P>0.05). Pairwise comparison showed that Dor group was significantly better than Toupet group in reducing the number of reflux episode(14.36Â±10.58 vs. 29.83Â±19.71) and long-reflux (0.64Â±0.21 vs. 6.20Â±3.48)(both P<0.05), but Nissen group was better than these two groups in reducing the number of long-reflux (0.38Â±0.16, P<0.05). As compared to pre-operation, the postoperative esophageal sphincter pressure and residual pressure increased significantly, and the relaxation rate reduced significantly (all P<0.05), while the episode of ineffective swallowing increased significantly in Toupet group (11.25Â±2.04 vs. 6.36Â±3.26, P<0.05). The contrast in esophageal manometry between Toupet and Dor group showed that Dor group was better than Toupet group in the recovery of lower esophageal sphincter pressure (mean resting breathing) [(20.69Â±13.95) mmHg vs.(12.91Â±6.89) mmHg] and the decrease of ineffective swallowing [9.15Â±6.44 vs. 11\n\nEsophageal manometric characteristics and outcomes for laparoscopic esophageal diverticulectomy, myotomy, and partial fundoplication for epiphrenic diverticula.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelman, Lora; Quinlan, Jessica; Robertson, Brian; Brunt, L M; Halpin, Valerie J; Eagon, J C; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to characterize the esophageal motor and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) abnormalities associated with epiphrenic esophageal diverticula and analyze outcomes for laparoscopic esophageal diverticulectomy, myotomy, and partial fundoplication. The endoscopic, radiographic, manometric, and perioperative records for patients undergoing laparoscopic esophageal diverticulectomy, anterior esophageal myotomy, and partial fundoplication from 8/99 until 9/06 were reviewed from an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved outcomes database. Data are given as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). An esophageal body motor disorder and/or LES abnormalities were present in 11 patients with epiphrenic diverticula; three patients were characterized as achalasia, one had vigorous achalasia, two had diffuse esophageal spasm, and five had a nonspecific motor disorder. Presenting symptoms included dysphagia (13/13), regurgitation (7/13), and chest pain (4/13). Three patients had previous Botox injections and three patients had esophageal dilatations. Laparoscopic epiphrenic diverticulectomy with an anterior esophageal myotomy was completed in 13 patients (M:F; 3:10) with a mean age of 67.6 +/- 4.2 years, body mass index (BMI) of 28.1 +/- 1.9 kg/m2 and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 2.2 +/- 0.1. Partial fundoplication was performed in 12/13 patients (Dor, n = 2; Toupet, n = 10). Four patients had a type I and one patient had a type III hiatal hernia requiring repair. Mean operative time was 210 +/- 15.1 min and mean length of stay (LOS) was 2.8 +/- 0.4 days. Two grade II or higher complications occurred, including one patient who was readmitted on postoperative day 4 with a leak requiring a thoracotomy. After a mean follow-up of 13.6 +/- 3.0 months (range 3-36 months), two patients complained of mild solid food dysphagia and one patient required proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms.

However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to \"open\" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious\n\nCost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication versus continued medical management for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease based on long-term follow-up of the REFLUX trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nFaria, R; Bojke, L; Epstein, D; Corbacho, B; Sculpher, M\n\n2013-08-01\n\nLaparoscopic fundoplication surgery has been shown to be a cost-effective alternative to continued medical management over 1 year for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The longer-term cost-effectiveness is, however, uncertain. This study evaluated the long-term health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication compared with continued medical management in patients with GORD. Individual patient data were used from the 5-year follow-up of the REFLUX trial, a large multicentre, pragmatic, randomized trial in which 357 patients with GORD for at least 12 months at trial entry were allocated randomly to early laparoscopic fundoplication or continued medical management. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A UK National Health Service perspective was used for costs. The group randomized to surgery experienced better health outcomes in each year of follow-up, but the difference narrowed over time. At 5 years, the surgery group had experienced 0.216 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.021 to 0.412) more QALYs but also accrued â¬1832 (1214 to 2448) more costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was â¬8481 per QALY gained. The probability that surgery is the most cost-effective intervention was 0.932 at a threshold of â¬24,134/QALY (Â£20,000/QALY). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses, except where patients with missing data randomized to surgery were assumed to have worse health outcomes. Laparoscopic fundoplication is a cost-effective alternative to continued medical management over 5 years. No evidence was found to suggest that the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication diminishes over time. Â© 2013 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

Personal experience and review of literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossetti, Gianluca; del Genio, Gianmattia; Maffettone, Vincenzo; Fei, Landino; Brusciano, Luigi; Limongelli, Paolo; Pizza, Francesco; Tolone, Salvatore; Di Martino, Maria; del Genio, Federica; del Genio, Alberto\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic Heller myotomy with antireflux procedure seems the procedure of choice in the treatment of patients with esophageal achalasia. Persistent or recurrent symptoms occur in 10% to 20% of patients. Few reports on reoperation after failed Heller myotomy have been published. No author has reported the realization of a total fundoplication in these patient groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic reoperation with the realization of a total fundoplication after failed Heller myotomy for esophageal achalasia. From 1992 to December 2007, 5 out of a series of 242 patients (2.1%), along with 2 patients operated elsewhere, underwent laparoscopic reintervention for failed Heller myotomy. Symptoms leading to reoperation included persistent dysphagia in 3 patients, recurrent dysphagia in another 3, and heartburn in 1 patient. Mean time from the first to the second operation was 49.7 months (range, 4-180 months). Always, the intervention was completed via a laparoscopic approach and a Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication was realized or left in place after a complete Heller myotomy. Mean operative time was 160 minutes (range, 60-245 minutes). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.1 +/- 1.5 days. No major morbidity or mortality occurred. At a mean follow-up of 16.1 months, reoperation must be considered successful in 5 out of 7 patients (71.4%). The dysphagia DeMeester score fell from 2.71 +/- 0.22 to 0.91 +/- 0.38 postoperatively. The regurgitation score changed from 2.45 +/- 0.34 to 0.68 +/- 0.23. Laparoscopic reoperation for failed Heller myotomy with the realization of a total fundoplication is safe and is associated with good long-term results if performed by an experienced surgeon in a center with a long tradition of esophageal surgery.\n\nSymptomatic outcome following laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with angle of His accentuation: results of a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalakrishna, Pavithra; Parshad, Rajinder; Rohila, Jitender; Saraya, Anoop; Makharia, Govind; Sharma, Raju\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe type of anti-reflux procedure to be used as an adjunct to laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy (LHCM) in Achalasia cardia is controversial. We compared Angle of His accentuation and Dor fundoplication in a randomized controlled trial. From May 2010 to October 2013, 62 patients undergoing LHCM were randomized to receive either Dor fundoplication (Dor group) or Angle of His accentuation (AOH group) as an anti-reflux procedure. Symptomatic outcome was evaluated using modified Mellow and Pinkas scale for dysphagia and modified DeMeester's score for regurgitation and heartburn. Achalasia-specific quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. The primary outcome was symptomatic relief and the secondary outcome was postoperative heartburn. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software. All the procedures were completed laparoscopically with no mortality. Morbidity was similar in the two groups (6.4 %). Median operative time was higher in Dor group (170 vs 130 min). At a median follow-up of 21 months relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn was seen in 87, 90.3, and 90.3 % patients in Dor group versus 93.5, 96.7, and 77.4 % in AOH group patients with significant improvement in symptom scores. Improvement was similar in both groups with no statistically significant difference in the symptom scores (p = 0.48 for dysphagia, p = 0.37 for regurgitation, and p = 0.19 for heartburn). The QOL improved in both groups [62.3 to 12.3 (p = 0.02) in Dor group and 63.9-13 (p = 0.02) in AOH group] with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.96). There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative heartburn between the two groups (p = 0.19). Laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with either Angle of His accentuation or Dor fundoplication leads to similar improvement in symptoms and quality of life.\n\nReflux parameters as modified by laparoscopic fundoplication in 40 patients with heartburn/regurgitation persisting despite PPI therapy: a study using impedance-pH monitoring.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrazzoni, Marzio; Conigliaro, Rita; Melotti, Gianluigi\n\n2011-04-01\n\nPatients with typical reflux symptoms (heartburn/regurgitation) persisting despite proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are not uncommon. Impedance-pH monitoring detects gastroesophageal reflux at all pH levels and may establish if ongoing symptoms on PPI therapy are associated with acid/nonacid reflux. Laparoscopic fundoplication is a therapeutic option in such patients but reflux parameters on PPI therapy and after intervention and their relationship with symptom persistence/remission have been scarcely studied. The aim of this study was to assess reflux parameters and their relationship with symptoms before and after laparoscopic fundoplication, on and off PPI therapy, respectively, in patients with PPI-unresponsive heartburn/regurgitation and with a positive symptom-reflux association and/or abnormal reflux parameters detected on PPI therapy. Impedance-pH monitoring was performed on high-dose PPI therapy and 3Â months after laparoscopic fundoplication, off PPI therapy, in 40 patients with PPI-unresponsive heartburn/regurgitation. Symptoms were scored by a validated questionnaire. Esophageal acid exposure time as well as the number of total and proximal reflux events and of acid and weakly acidic refluxes decreased significantly after surgery: normal values were found in 100, 77, 95, 92 and 65% of cases, respectively. Weakly alkaline refluxes increased significantly postoperatively but neither before nor after intervention were associated with symptoms. All patients reported total/subtotal remission of heartburn/regurgitation 3Â months after surgery. Laparoscopic fundoplication improves acid and weakly acidic reflux parameters when compared with PPI therapy. This improvement justifies the very high post-surgical symptom remission rate that we observed. Prolonged follow-up is warranted but our findings strongly support the surgical option in PPI failures.\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen (total) versus anterior 180Â° fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDu, Xing; Wu, Ji-Min; Hu, Zhi-Wei; Wang, Feng; Wang, Zhong-Gao; Zhang, Chao; Yan, Chao; Chen, Mei-Ping\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Background: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) has been the gold standard for the surgical management of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laparoscopic anterior 180Â° fundoplication (180Â° LAF) is reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications while obtaining similar control of reflux. The present meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the value of the 2 techniques. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Springerlink, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Platform databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and 180Â° LAF. Data regarding the benefits and adverse results of 2 techniques were extracted and compared using a meta-analysis. Results: Six eligible RCTs comparing LNF (nâ=â266) and 180Â° LAF (nâ=â265) were identified. There were no significant differences between LNF and 180Â° LAF with regard to operating time, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo surgery again, quality of life, postoperative heartburn, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, postoperative DeMeester scores, postoperative lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, postoperative gas-bloating, unable to belch, diarrhea, or overall reoperation. LNF was associated with a higher prevalence of postoperative dysphagia compared with 180Â° LAF, while 180Â° LAF was followed by more reoperation for recurrent reflux symptoms. Conclusion: LNF and 180Â° LAF are equally effective in controlling reflux symptoms and obtain a comparable prevalence of patient satisfaction. 180Â° LAF can reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia while this is offset by a higher risk of reoperation for recurrent symptoms. The risk of recurrent symptoms should need to be balanced against the risk of dysphagia when surgeons choose surgical procedures for each individual with GERD.

Laparoscopic techniques have been applied to reoperative fundoplications. We reviewed our experience with reoperative laparoscopic fundoplication. Reoperative laparoscopic fundoplication was undertaken in 28 patients, 19 F and 9 M, of mean age 56 years +/- 12. Previous antireflux procedures included 19 open and 12 laparoscopic antireflux operations. Symptoms were heartburn (90%), dysphagia (35%), and atypical symptoms (30%%). The mean interval from antireflux procedure to revision was 13 months +/- 4.2. The mean DeMeester score was 78+/-32 (normal 14.7). Eighteen patients (64%) had hiatal breakdown, 17 (60%) had wrap failure, 2 (7%) had slipped Nissen, 3 (11%) had paraesophageal hernias, and 1 (3%) had an excessively tight wrap. Twenty-five revisions were completed laparoscopically, while 3 patients required conversion to the open technique. Complications occurred in 9 of 17 (53%) patients failing previous open fundoplications and in 4 of 12 patients (33%) failing previous laparoscopic fundoplications and included 15 gastrotomies and 1 esophagotomy, all repaired laparoscopically, 3 postoperative gastric leaks, and 4 pneumothoraces requiring tube thoracostomy. No deaths occurred. Median length of stay was 5 days (range 2-90 days). At a mean follow-up of 20 months +/- 17, 2 patients (7%) have failed revision of their fundoplications, with the rest of the patients being essentially asymptomatic (93%). The results achieved with reoperative laparoscopic fundoplication are similar to those of primary laparoscopic fundoplications. Laparoscopic reoperations, particularly of primary open fundoplication, can be technically challenging and fraught with complications.

However, the type of fundoplication is still a subject of debate. The aim of the study is to identify which partial fundoplication leads to better control of acid exposure, manometric parameters, and symptoms scores. A randomized controlled trial was performed to compare Dor vs Toupet fundoplication after LHM. The preoperative diagnosis was made by high-resolution manometry (HRM), upper endoscopy, and barium esophagogram. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were evaluated with Eckardt, GERD-HRQL, and EAT-10 questionnaires. Seventy-three patients were randomized, 38 underwent Dor and 35 Toupet. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Postoperative HRM showed that the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) and basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure were similar at 6 and 24Â months. The number of patients with abnormal acid exposure was significantly lower for Dor (6.9%) than that of Toupet (34.0%) at 6Â months, but it was not different at 12 or 24Â months. No differences were found in postoperative symptom scores at 1, 6, or 24Â months. There were no differences in symptom scores or HRM between fundoplications in the long term. A higher percentage of abnormal 24-h pH test were found for the Toupet group, with no difference in the long term.\n\nDevelopment of a novel ex vivo porcine laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication training model (Toronto lap-Nissen simulator).\n\nPubMed\n\nUjiie, Hideki; Kato, Tatsuya; Hu, Hsin-Pei; Bauer, Patrycja; Patel, Priya; Wada, Hironobu; Lee, Daiyoon; Fujino, Kosuke; Schieman, Colin; Pierre, Andrew; Waddell, Thomas K; Keshavjee, Shaf; Darling, Gail E; Yasufuku, Kazuhiro\n\n2017-06-01\n\nSurgical trainees are required to develop competency in a variety of laparoscopic operations. Developing laparoscopic technical skills can be difficult as there has been a decrease in the number of procedures performed. This study aims to develop an inexpensive and anatomically relevant model for training in laparoscopic foregut procedures. An ex vivo , anatomic model of the human upper abdomen was developed using intact porcine esophagus, stomach, diaphragm and spleen. The Toronto lap-Nissen simulator was contained in a laparoscopic box-trainer and included an arch system to simulate the normal radial shape and tension of the diaphragm. We integrated the use of this training model as a part of our laparoscopic skills laboratory-training curriculum. Afterwards, we surveyed trainees to evaluate the observed benefit of the learning session. Twenty-five trainees and five faculty members completed a survey regarding the use of this model. Among the trainees, only 4 (16%) had experience with laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Nissen fundoplication. They reported that practicing with the model was a valuable use of their limited time, repeating the exercise would be of additional benefit, and that the exercise improved their ability to perform or assist in an actual case in the operating room. Significant improvements were found in the following subjective measures comparing pre- vs. post-training: (I) knowledge level (5.6 vs. 8.0, P<0.001); (II) comfort level in assisting (6.3 vs. 7.6, P<0.001); and (III) comfort level in performing as the primary surgeon (4.9 vs. 7.1, P<0.001). The trainees and faculty members agreed that this model was of adequate fidelity and was a representative simulation of actual human anatomy. We developed an easily reproducible training model for laparoscopic procedures. This simulator reproduces human anatomy and increases the trainees' comfort level in performing and assisting with myotomy and fundoplication.\n\nSeventeen-year Outcome of a Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Laparoscopic and Conventional Nissen Fundoplication: A Plea for Patient Counseling and Clarification.\n\nPubMed\n\nOor, Jelmer E; Roks, David J; Broeders, Joris A; Hazebroek, Eric J; Gooszen, Hein G\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo analyze long-term outcome of a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and conventional Nissen fundoplication (CNF) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). LNF has replaced CNF, based on positive short and mid-term outcome. Studies with a follow-up of over 15 years are scarce, but are desperately needed for patient counselling. Between 1997 and 1999, 177 patients with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory GERD were randomized to CNF or LNF. Data regarding the presence of reflux symptoms, dysphagia, general health, PPI use, and need for surgical reintervention at 17 years are reported. A total of 111 patients (60 LNF, 51 CNF) were included. Seventeen years after LNF and CNF, 90% and 95% of the patients reported symptom relief, with no differences in GERD symptoms or dysphagia. Forty-three and 49% of the patients used PPIs (NS). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in general health (77% vs 71%; NS) and quality of life (75.3 vs 74.7; NS). Surgical reinterventions were more frequent after CNF (18% vs 45%; P = 0.002), mainly due to incisional hernia corrections (3% vs 14%; P = 0.047). The effects of LNF and CNF on symptomatic outcome and general state of health remain for up to 17 years after surgery, with no differences between the 2 procedures. CNF carries a higher risk of surgical reintervention, mainly due to incisional hernia corrections. Patients should be informed that 17 years after Nissen fundoplication, 60% of the patients are off PPIs, and 16% require reoperation for recurrent GERD and/or dysphagia.\n\nLaparoscopic Toupet fundoplication with duodenojejunostomy for the management of superior mesenteric artery syndrome with reflux symptoms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYan, Chao; Hu, Zhi-Wei; Wu, Ji-Min; Zhang, Chao; Yan, Liang; Wang, Zhong-Gao\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Rationale: The patient had symptoms of GERD and the reflux even caused the symptom of cough. Gaining weight is a risk factor for the treatment of reflux as it could exacerbated symptoms of reflux and the drug treatment is not effective. Surgical intervention becomes necessary when there is failure following conservative medical therapy or the patient. Patient concerns: The patient was not satisfied with the drug treatment. Diagnoses: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease. Interventions: Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication with duodenojejunostomy. Outcomes: The patient discharged from hospital 10 days after surgery without any postoperative complication. The patient achieved complete relief of symptoms and discontinuation of drug. Lessons subsections: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome may manifest the symptoms of GERD such as heartburn, acid reflux and cough. It is necessary to complete examination to exclude superior mesenteric artery syndrome for these patients. Laparoscopic fundoplication with duodenojejunostomy provided an effective treatment for patients who failed drug treatment.

This survey aimed to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for treatment of GERD-related respiratory symptoms not responsive to medical therapy in neurological normal children. We collected data of children with GERD-related respiratory complaints not responsive to medical therapy who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in four European centers of Pediatric Surgery over a 10-year period. We excluded children with neurological impairment. A total of 220 laparoscopic Nissen procedures were performed in the period 2005-2015. Twenty-four (12 boys and 12 girls, average age 9.5 years) out of the 220 patients (10.9%) presented with chronic cough and other respiratory manifestations, including asthma, reactive airway disease, and recurrent pneumonia. Average operative time was 65 minutes (range 45-100). As for postoperative complications, two tight wraps requiring endoscopic dilatation (IIIb Clavien) and two relapses of GERD for slipped Nissen requiring reoperation (IIIb Clavien) were recorded. None of these complications occurred in the group of patients with GERD-related respiratory symptoms. At follow-up evaluation, respiratory symptoms disappeared with a significant improvement of quality of life scoring (I Grade Visick) in 22/24 patients (91.6%). Our results confirm that GERD should be investigated as one of the possible etiologic factors in any child with persistent respiratory complaints. In patients with symptoms not responsive to medical therapy, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the treatment of choice with a very high success rate (>90% in our series), a very low morbidity, a significant improvement in airway symptoms, and a marked reduction in the need for medications.\n\nOutcome of gastro-oesophageal reflux-related respiratory manifestations after laparoscopic fundoplication.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdaba, Franklin; Ang, Chin W; Perry, Anthony; Wadley, Martin S; Robertson, Charles S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPatients with refractory respiratory symptoms related to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) such as asthma and cough are being referred for laparoscopic fundoplication (LFP), as recommended by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). However there are limited data regarding symptomatic response to fundoplication in this group of patients. A 7 year retrospective review was performed to study the efficacy of LFP in the treatment of patients with respiratory manifestations of GORD. Patients were followed up from 4 to 6 weeks (short-term) to 6-12 months (long-term) post-operatively. Of 208 patients who underwent LFP, 73 (35%) patients were eligible for inclusion into the study. 55 (75%) patients had improved respiratory symptoms at short-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, 7 of these patients had recurrence of respiratory symptoms, while 4 patients had improvement not initially apparent. No significant predictive factor for the success or failure of surgery was identified. 190 (91%) of 208 patients had symptomatic improvement in GORD at short-term follow-up. LFP is effective with the response rates over 75% in the control of respiratory manifestation of GORD, compared to over 91% response rate in the control GOR symptoms alone. More research is needed to identify factors to aid patient selection to improve response rate. Copyright Â© 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Significant improvements were found in the following subjective measures comparing pre- vs. post-training: (I) knowledge level (5.6 vs. 8.0, P<0.001); (II) comfort level in assisting (6.3 vs. 7.6, P<0.001); and (III) comfort level in performing as the primary surgeon (4.9 vs. 7.1, P<0.001). The trainees and faculty members agreed that this model was of adequate fidelity and was a representative simulation of actual human anatomy. Conclusions We developed an easily reproducible training model for laparoscopic procedures. This simulator reproduces human anatomy and increases the traineesâ comfort level in performing and assisting with myotomy and\n\n[A retaining dam against reflux. Laparoscopic fundoplication helps even in stubborn cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nWaninger, J; RÃ¼ckauer, K\n\n2000-04-27\n\nThe introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease offered an opportunity for definitive healing. The indication for surgery is the failure of medical treatment, recurrence of symptoms following conservative treatment, severe side effects of the medication, and the patient's wish to stop taking drugs. The laparoscopic treatment has a low rate of complications. Apart from temporary dysphagia (30%), rapid satiety, increased flatulence and suppressed eructation are possible undesirable sequelae. Intra-operative bleeding and organ perforation (1%) are major feared occurrences. The rate of conversion to open surgery is 5.8%, and the mortality rate is 0.1%. Persistent dysphagia in 3.4% may be caused by a slipped cuff. A revision procedure is necessary in 0.7% of the patients. Patient satisfaction with the results of the operation ranges between 87 and 100%.\n\nLaparoscopic anterior versus posterior fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a meta-analysis and systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMemon, Muhammed Ashraf; Subramanya, Manjunath S; Hossain, Md Belal; Yunus, Rossita Mohamad; Khan, Shahjahan; Memon, Breda\n\n2015-04-01\n\nAlthough laparoscopic posterior fundoplication (LPF) i.e., Nissen or Toupet have the proven efficacy for controlling gastro-esophageal reflux surgically, there remain problems with postoperative dysphagia and gas bloat syndrome. To decrease some of these postoperative complications, laparoscopic anterior fundoplication (LAF) was introduced. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the merits and drawbacks of LPF versus LAF for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing different types of LPF and LAF published in the English Language between 1990 and 2013. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Data was extracted and analyzed on ten variables which include dysphagia score, heartburn rate, redo operative rate, operative time, overall complications, rate of conversion to open, Visick grading of satisfaction, overall satisfaction, length of hospital stay, and postoperative 24-h pH scores. Nine trials totaling 840 patients (anterior = 425, posterior = 415) were analyzed. There was a significant reduction in the odds ratio for dysphagia in the LAF group compared to the LPF group. Conversely, significant reduction in the odds ratio for heartburn was observed for LPF compared to LAF. Comparable effects were noted for both groups for other variables which include redo surgery, operating time, overall complications, conversion rate, Visick's grading, patients' satisfaction, length of hospital stay, and postoperative 24-h pH scores. Based on this meta-analysis, LPF compared to LAF is associated with significant reduction in heartburn at the expense of higher dysphagia rate on a short- and medium-term basis.

The transfer of laparoscopic skills from training models to real surgical procedures has been proven. The global operative assessment of laparoscopic skills (GOALS) score is a 5-item global rating scale developed to evaluate laparoscopic skills by direct observation. This scale has been used to demonstrate construct validity of several laparoscopic training models. Here, we present a low-cost model of laparoscopic Heller-Dor for advanced laparoscopic training. The aim of this study was to determine the capability of a training model for laparoscopic Heller-Dor to discriminate between different levels of laparoscopic expertise. The performance of two groups with different levels of expertise, novices (<30 laparoscopic procedures PGY1-2) and experts (>300 laparoscopic procedures PGY4-5) was assessed. All participants were instructed to perform two tasks (esophageal myotomy and fundoplication). All the performances were recorded in a digital format. A laparoscopic expert who was blinded to subject's identity evaluated the recordings using the GOALS score. Autonomy, one of the five items of GOALS, was removed since the evaluator and the trainee did not have interaction. The time required to finish each task was also recorded. Performance was compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (pÂ <Â 0.05 was significant). Twenty subjects were evaluated: ten in each group, using the GOALS score. The mean total GOALS score for novices was 7.5 points (SD: 1.64) and 13.9 points (SD: 1.66) for experts (pÂ <Â 0.05).The expert group was superior in each domain of the GOALS score compared to novices: depth perception (mean: 3.3 vs 2 pÂ <Â 0.05), bimanual dexterity (mean 3.4 vs 2.1 pÂ <Â 0.05), efficiency (mean 3.4 vs 1.7 pÂ <Â 0.05) and tissue handling (mean 3.6 vs 1.7 pÂ <Â 0.05). With regard to time, experts were superior in task 1 ("
