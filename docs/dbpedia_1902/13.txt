Dear Colleagues, On behalf of the Program Committee and the Division of Education, we would like to extend to you a very warm welcome to the 2012 Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). This Clinical Congress will launch the beginning of a year-long celebration of the ACS Centennial. The Clinical Congress remains the premier annual educational meeting for surgeons and continues to offer a spectrum of state- of-the-art educational opportunities that are firmly grounded in principles of contemporary surgical education and continuous professional development. Over the past several years, major changes have been made in the program to enhance its edu¬ cational value and relevance in order to meet the evolving needs of practicing surgeons, surgery residents, medical students, and members of the surgical team. Transformational changes have been introduced in the program of the Clinical Congress each year to further enhance the rel¬ evance and impact of the program. The Clinical Congress program is organized into thematic tracks that address content of interest to all surgical specialties and specialty-based tracks that address the learning needs of various specialty groups. Each track is composed of blocks with uniform start and end times, and different types of sessions are included within these tracks. The 11 Named Lectures and 106 Panel Sessions will address a broad range of important topics that focus on the breadth of surgical practice, and will include both clinical and nonclinical content. In addition, 11 Didac¬ tic Postgraduate Courses and 12 Skills-Oriented Postgraduate Courses will be offered. Original scientific work will be presented at the Scientific Paper Sessions, Owen H. Wangensteen Surgi¬ cal Forum Sessions, and Poster Presentation Sessions. More than 1,800 abstracts were received for these sessions and the best submissions were selected for presentation. In addition, more than 300 submissions were received for the Video-based Education Sessions, of which a select number were accepted for presentation. A total of 23 Panel Sessions, five Surgical Forum Ses¬ sions, and one Postgraduate Course will specifically address patient safety topics. The program will also include 55 Meet the Expert Luncheons and 17 Town Hall Meetings. Continuing Medical Education Credits earned through participation in the Clinical Congress program will be trans¬ ferred seamlessly to the My CME Web pages for ACS Members. Individuals who participate in Didactic and Skills Postgraduate Courses will receive special certificates of verification based on the Division of Education’s Five-Level Verification Program, as well as Self-Assessment Credits for certain Postgraduate Courses. In addition, special certificates will be awarded for designated Patient Safety, Ethics, and Trauma sessions. The program of the 2012 Clinical Congress should be of great value to attendees in address¬ ing their specific learning needs defined through gap analyses, outcomes data, and self-assess¬ ments. The educational content should also assist in fulfilling requirements for Maintenance of Certification, credentialing, and privileging. We encourage you to take full advantage of this stellar educational opportunity and look forward to receiving your feedback regarding the program’s new directions. Dr. Rusch Dr. Sachdeva Valerie W.
