        "text": "French Renaissance treatises concerned with musical instruments are limited in number, yet all extant instrumental treatises mention the use of five-string viols tuned in fourths. Details about these viols across both contemporary sixteenth-century sources and seventeenth-century retrospective musings are remarkably consistent. These sources confirm the tuning schemes of consorts of viols, provide technical advice, and clarify the multitude of social uses of these viols. In sixteenth-century France, the playing of the viol begins to spread to amateur musicians, as evidenced by the publication of Claude Gervaise’s Premier Livre de violle (Paris, c. 1547, now lost; 2nd ed. 1554, now lost) and Philibert Jambe de Fer’s L’Épitome musical (Lyons, 1556). Still in the sixteenth century, Samuel Mareschall published his Porta Musices (Basle, 1589), which also discusses five-string viols and provides a variation on Jambe de Fer’s system of tuning for consorts. Pierre Trichet’s manuscript Traité des instruments de musique (Bordeaux, c. 1640) suggests that French five-string viols tuned in fourths survived further into the seventeenth century than previously believed alongside Italian/English six-string viols tuned like a lute. Finally, in the seventeenth century, two retrospective accounts mention the early form of the viol in France—Marin Mersenne’s Harmonie Universelle (Paris, 1636) and Jean Rousseau’s Traité de la Viole (Paris, 1687).\n\nClaude Gervaise\n\nClaude Gervaise published his tutor for the viol—Premier Livre de violle contenant dix chansons avec l’introduction de l’acordes, et apliquer les doits selon la manière qu’on a acoutume de joüer, le tout de la composition de Claude Gervaise—around 1547. Although unfortunately no known exemplar survives, we know of some of its contents because the composer and bibliophile Sébastien de Brossard owned a copy of the second edition. In a catalog of his extensive music library created in 1724, Brossard documented his ownership of the second edition of Gervaise’s tutor, which was published by Marie Lescallopier-Attaingnant, the widow of the recently deceased Parisian music publisher Pierre Attaignant.\n\nThis recueil curieux, to use Brossard’s term, began with an introduction that included instructions for tuning and fingering the viol and concluded with ten chansons first presented in French lute tablature and then in staff notation. Brossard includes the following annotation for his entry for Gervaise’s Premier livre de violle:\n\nAll of these chansons are first presented in tablature using a, b, c, d & e for the viol, and then the subject is very well noted in music and ordinary notes. 32 sheets or 64 pages.”\n\nIn this instance Gervaise was an innovator by publishing the first viol tablature in France. In his catalog, Brossard then proceeds with entries documenting ownership of volumes two through seven of Danceries à 4 parties—collections of dance music (Gaillardes, Pavandes, Bransles, and Allemandes) also published by the widow of Pierre Attaignant. He notes in the margin that Gervaise’s Premier livre de violle and volumes two through six of the Danceries à 4 parties are reliez ensemble (bound together) as a single collection. All of these volumes are listed in the catalog, which he organizes into sections by function and genre, as “instrumental music for viols, violins, flutes, oboes, and other instruments, on which one usually only plays a separate part and rarely two or more parts.” No premier livre de danceries has ever been located, so perhaps Gervaise’s Premier livre de violle was planned as a tutor that prepared amateur players of the viol to perform the dances contained in the successive volumes. Gervaise composed the music contained in volumes two through six of the Danceries; Estienne du Tertre is listed as the composer of the seventh volume. It would seem, then, that, in addition to the chanson arrangements, the collections of Danceries were viewed as suitable repertoire for a four-part viol consort.\n\nBrossard concludes the entry with a further annotation:\n\nThis collection is one of the most curious in my cabinet because of its antiquity and because it would only serve to make known what was the taste and the manner of instrumental music and the dances of that time.\n\nHere he clarifies that he was not performing this music but rather had acquired it as part of his collecting activities.\n\nPhilibert Jambe de Fer\n\nPhilibert Jambe de Fer (1515–1566) was a Huguenot composer and writer on music. In 1556, he published L’Épitome musical des tons, sons et accordz, es voix humaines, fleustes d’Alleman, flesustes à neuf trous, violes, & violons (Lyons, 1556), which included a chapter on the viol that today has become one of the most important primary sources of information on French Renaissance viols. The viol, he asserts hinting at its amateur status, was “an instrument played by gentlemen, merchants, and other men of virtue.”\n\nJambe de Fer was knowledgable of Italian schools of viol playing and sensitive to the differences between the Italian and French playing techniques and tuning systems. He claims, for example, that the Italians call the instrument viole da gambe and names three different positions for holding the instrument: between the legs, on a seat or stool, and on the knees. By “on the knees,” he might have been referring to a horizontal position of holding the viol across the lap, which appears in many sixteenth-century images of viols, but he assures the reader that this posture is relatively uncommon in France. Regarding tuning of the instruments in France, he claims that the French viols had five strings and were tuned in fourths, while the Italian viols had six strings and were tuned in fourths with a major third in the middle, like a lute. A damaged image toward the end of the treatise (pictured below) illustrates a five-string French viol and reveals that each string had it’s own nomenclature, namely from the top string to the bottom: chanterelle, seconde, tierce, quarte, and bordon. Jambe de Fer adopts the voice names dessus, haute contre, taille, and bas to refer to the tuning of each of the four viols that would have played a particular musical line. Regarding the tuning, his prose is admittedly a little convoluted:\n\nThe key to our viols as used in France: on the part of the bas and the dessus, take the second open string from the top, which we call G sol re ut, so this one from the bas, is the second contained in the scales, and the one of the dessus is the third, making the difference of eight notes that we call and octave. The tailles and haute contres tune their chanterelle just as the second of the dessus, open, as everything is contained in the figure:\n\nWhen viewed in conjunction with the image at the end of the treatise and the charts on pages 56-57 (see below), it becomes clear that Jambe de Fer was merely stating that the seconde, or the second open string from the highest string, was tuned to a G for the instruments playing the bas and dessus, with the instrument paying the bas tuned an octave lower than the dessus. Further the chanterelle, or the highest open string, was tuned to the same G for the instrments playing the taille and haute contre. This tuning scheme is confirmed by the image of the viol at the end of the treatise, from highest to lowest: c’ g d A E’. Jambe de Fer therefore describes a consort tuned in the following manner:\n\nJambe de Fer also provides some clues as to the usable ranges of the instruments for consort playing. He explains that there are three pitches on each string, including the open string, and that generally the fifth fret is useless because it is identical in pitch as the neighboring open string, which has a more clear, natural, and less constrained sound. He concedes that in some passages or diminutions it is easier to use the fifth fret to avoid string crossings, and that it is sometimes necessary to play the fifth or sixth fret on the chanterelle. His advice implies a two-octave usable range on each of the viols.\n\nSamuel Mareschall\n\nSamuel Mareschall, in the supplement to his Porta Musices, das ist Eynführung zu der edlen Kunst Musica, mit einem kurzen Bericht und Anleitung zu den Violen (Basle, 1589), also describes five-string viols tuned in fourths. Mareschall was a Flemish composer, organist, and teacher who was born in Tournai in 1554 and died in Basel in 1640. Porta Musices is a short treatise and viol tutor that was probably published to be used as part of the curriculum at the Gymnasium where he taught. This treatise confirms the use of viols in educational curricula. Mareschall provides identical tunings as previously prescribed by Jambe de Fer, with the exception of his dessus tuning, for which he suggests the entire instrument should be tuned one whole tone higher. Jambe de Fer and Mareschall’s system of tuning consorts are compared in the following table:\n\nMareschall likely tuned his dessus higher to facilitate less shifting for repertoire in which the top voice would often be forced to play notes on the fifth through seventh frets. His tuning, however, sacrifices some of the sympathetic resonance characteristic of a viol consort consisting of paired identical tunings at a unison or octave.\n\nMarin Mersenne"
