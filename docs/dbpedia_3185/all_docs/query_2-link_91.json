        "text": "As an urban historian, I have worked on the social history of neighbourhoods and groups, a theme which I began to explore in Medieval Westminster, 1200-1540 (Oxford, 1989) (Whitfield Prize) and have since pursued through study of English and European guilds and confraternities. This work has been brought together in: The Art of Solidarity in the Middle Ages: Guilds in England 1250-1550 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). As a historian of art, I have published with Jane Garnett a study of miraculous image cults, Spectacular Miracles. Transforming Images in Italy from the Renaissance to the Present (London: Reaktion Books, 2013) (Art and Christianity Enquiry - Mercers Prize). Please see the research tab for more details.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nPainting in medieval and Renaissance Italy\n\nMedieval urban history\n\nSocial history of groups and communities\n\nOne strand of my work is concerned with the history of visual culture, both within and beyond the conventional range of 'high art'. I researched and published with Jane Garnett a book about cults of images believed to be miraculous: Spectacular Miracles. Transforming Images in Italy from the Renaissance to the Present (London: Reaktion Books, 2013). We have also staged public exhibitions on this theme. My art historical research is focused on late-medieval and Renaissance Italy. I am interested in non-naturalistic elements in Renaissance painting, and explored Duccio's high altarpiece for Siena cathedral in this light. I am currently working on the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina, partly as a means to critique the periodisation of 'medieval' and 'Renaissance' art. These interests relate to the history of vision, and in this connection I have also published on Dante and sight. The other major theme in my work is medieval urban history. Here my particular interest is in how inhabitants of cities cope â€“ with urban life, and more particularly with one another. This began with Medieval Westminster (1989) and has continued in a series of studies of English and European guilds and confraternities. My book, The Art of Solidarity in the Middle Ages: Guilds in England 1250-1550 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), is in part a response to current political and philosophical discussion about the relationship between the state, the individual citizen, and voluntary associations."
