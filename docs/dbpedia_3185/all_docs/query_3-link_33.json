        "text": "A nurse accused of verbally abusing a paralysed patient, made a \"unilateral\" decision that another had no quality of life, a nursing council panel heard.\n\nCaroline Gervaise-Brazier, 55, of Trecenydd, Caerphilly, is accused of advising assistants not to rush to help a patient if he had a heart attack.\n\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing was told she admitted saying the patient had no quality of life.\n\nThe staff nurse, who worked at Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff, denies misconduct.\n\nThe hearing was previously told Miss Gervaise-Brazier advised two nursing auxiliaries not to rush in the event a man known as Patient A suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\nHowever, her barrister argued the words were open to the interpretation and could mean the auxiliaries should not panic and take proper care, which Miss Gervaise-Brazier asserted when she gave evidence on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier, Rachel Barry, lead nurse for the neuroscience directorate at the University Hospital of Wales, told the panel she had held a meeting with Miss Gervaise-Brazier informing her of this and other allegations against her on 16 January 2008.\n\nMrs Barry said she could not remember if she had referred to Patient A by name but said Miss Gervaise-Brazier immediately knew which patient and which incident she was referring to.\n\nMrs Barry said: \"She agreed she had told them not to hurry to the patient.\n\n\"She proceeded to inform me that in her opinion the patient had no quality of life.\"\n\nMiss Gervaise-Brazier added she had had a discussion with a doctor on the night about resuscitation.\n\n\"It confirmed to me that she had made a unilateral decision about the patient's quality of life,\" Mrs Barry added.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, one witness had given evidence by phone link from Australia.\n\nHayley Fuller had worked as an auxiliary alongside Miss Gervaise-Brazier.\n\nShe told the panel she was on night duty on 27 December 2007 when Miss Gervaise-Brazier complained about Patient A, being \"too spoiled\" and always wanting drinks.\n\nAfter a handover which informed staff that Patient A had complained of chest pains and may be at risk of cardiac arrest, Ms Fuller said Miss Gervaise-Brazier, the qualified nurse in charge, told them: \"If Patient A goes into cardiac arrest, don't rush, take your time.\"\n\nHer evidence corroborated that of fellow nursing auxiliary Linda Camilleri the previous day.\n\nShe told the panel: \"I could not believe Miss Gervaise-Brazier was telling us not to rush if Patient A had a cardiac arrest.\"\n\nMs Fuller wrote a letter to ward manager and her deputy around a week later, raising her concerns, which also related to a man known as Patient B.\n\nShe said she had observed Miss Gervaise-Brazier tell Patient B, a paralysed man with Parkinson's disease and learning difficulties that she would ring his next of kin after he kept calling out during a night shift if he did not \"shut up\".\n\nShe also heard the nurse say about 10 minutes later: \"If you don't shut up I'll call the police and put you outside on your own.\"\n\nMs Fuller added Patient B had become very frightened and upset by these comments, and his distress had continued after the night in question.\n\nMiss Gervaise-Brazier told the hearing on Tuesday that colleagues misunderstood what she was trying to say with regards to Patient A, adding that she had recently attended a course which covered resuscitation prior to the incident involving Patient A.\n\n\"They were very specific about what nurses should do when they got back to their ward,\" she said.\n\n\"They told us we should ask doctors whether patients were for resuscitation or not, look at the other staff and resources on the ward so that everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet.\n\n\"I instructed two unqualified colleagues not to respond too quickly, delay their response to a patient.\"\n\nShe said before she could continue, Mrs Camilleri had reacted angrily and walked out of the room, and Ms Fuller followed.\n\n\"I thought it would be unprofessional to follow them up the ward shouting at them to come back,\" said Miss Gervaise-Brazier.\n\nOn Monday, the panel heard evidence from a number of witnesses about the removal of sheets from Rookwood, which Miss Gervaise-Brazier has admitted but denies amounts to dishonest behaviour.\n\nShe also dealt with claims she had told Patient B, a paralysed man with learning difficulties and Parkinson's disease to \"shut up\" or she would call a family member to sort him out, put him out in the car park and call police.\n\nMiss Gervaise-Brazier said she had called a doctor to see to Patient B in order to get him moved to a single room as he was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\nThe doctor had told her only to give him sips of water every hour as he wanted to avoid any more vomiting and give his stomach a rest.\n\nThe nurse said Patient B had continued to call regularly for a full glass of water and was distressed.\n\nShe said she had a good relationship with the patient and often used humour with him, which she tried to apply in this situation.\n\n\"It included a joke about a car park, but he was too distressed even to laugh about it. I always banter with him. You'd have to use a trigger to stop him worrying or getting concerned or agitated.\n\n\"It was nothing derogatory about moving him out of the ward. I was trying everything I could to alleviate his distress.\n\n\"It didn't work this time. He didn't understand why he was vomiting so much.\"\n\nMiss Gervaise-Brazier denied calling a man known as Patient C a pervert, although she admitted she may have thought that as he was a person who was \"aggressive\" and \"sexually inappropriate\".\n\nShe also denied telling Patient B that he could not move his legs because he was paralysed and would be in a wheelchair, and telling another man, Patient D, that there was nothing wrong with him.\n\nThe hearing continues."
