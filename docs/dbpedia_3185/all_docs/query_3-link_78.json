        "text": "There are a lot of Verloin deGruys in the family line. But deGruy – like many European feudal-era patronyms that eventually became surnames – was originally more of a clue about what one did or where one lived or what batch of land one was in charge of than an actual personal identifier that would be used in a particularly consistent way. And if you go digging into the records from that era, that lack of consistency will pretty much slap you in the face as a researcher at some point.\n\nMany of us have speculated over the years that Verloin was probably the original family name and Gruy a place name, “de Gruy” meaning “from Gruy” wherever that was (maybe Gruyere). I mean, it would be plausible. Names often worked that way.\n\nHowever, having eventually delved into this matter for myself, I’m not at all sure it’s as simple as all that. I certainly do not specialize in late medieval/early modern French history, so I am a bit out of my area of expertise with the origins here. But from recent reading, well, it looks like I have a lot more to learn about this.\n\nAnyway, Verloin has been a deGruy family name for a very long time, and one of our early Verloin ancestors, Antoine Gaspard, appears to have signed his name Degruy-verloin, as you can see from his marriage certificate at that link. There are Verloins and Verloings in the records prior to him, but he’s the earliest Verloin deGruy I’ve found who appears that way in the records.\n\ndeGruy deVerloin Armorial Notes\n\nAbove is page 236 from vol. 4 of the Grand Armorial de France. It has a listing for “de Gruy de Verloin” and notes that the name had formerly been or been spelled “Gruy.” I don’t have a great copy of this, but I think it says:\n\n18412 – [Champagne. Maist…. en noble 1669. Page du roi en 1748 (?)]. I can’t read the rest, but I suspect I found a transcription by someone else who also can’t read the whole thing; it reads:\n\n18412 – (Champagne – Maintenu noble en 1669. Page du Roi en 1746. D’az. à 3 pal coupé [can’t read] à un croissant d’art. sommé d’une étoile du mesme. (Nouveau d’Hozier 167]\n\nand it’s (one) description of these deGruys’ family arms, which you can see a version of at this Du Mesgnils database. [6/13/20 – link broken, got to find new location for it] The Du Mesgnils site gives this blazon:\n\nParti, le premier d’azur à trois pals d’or ; le second de gueules à l’étoile d’argent soutenue d’un croissant du même, au chef d’or chargé de trois pals de gueules.\n\n[This description seems to call for a shield halved down the middle, with a blue section having three thick vertical gold stripes (technically called “pales”), then a red section with a silver star and crescent, and at the top, above the other two sections, a horizontal section of gold with three thick red bars (the horizontal band at top, the chef, would be technically a “chief” in English but I won’t translate it as it adds no clarity for the non-specialist). But the horizontal gold section, the chef, is only over the red field with the star and crescent in the sketch. I suppose the chef can refer to the section crowning just the second half and not the whole shield, even though I don’t recall running into a chef that didn’t go the whole width of the shield before; in any case that is apparently how the artist has interpreted it, and I’m no heraldry expert, and the sketch is not in color anyway. And just to make it more fun, I think the description in the Grand Armorial differs and is simpler, without a chef at all, and it seems to be citing Nouveau d’Hozier as its source, which I also have not gotten my hands on. But I’m curious, if you are wandering by and know more about this than I do.]\n\nETA: I found an example of a shield divided into parts with a chef over only half of it (the arms of the commune of Nassandres), so I guess I stand corrected, but I’m still not sure what in the blazon requires an interpretation of the chef applying only to the one part. The Nassandres blazon makes it clear the chef applies to the first section only: “parti, au premier d’or au lion de sable, au chef d’azur chargé de trois fleurs de lis d’argent, au deuxième d’azur à la fleur de lis d’or.” But compare the arms of Beze-Saint-Eloi whose blazon is “parti, au premier d’hermine, au second d’azur à une crosse d’or, au chef de gueules chargé d’un léopard d’or accosté de deux fers à cheval du même cloutés de sable.” Like the deGruy arms, the Beze-Saint-Eloi blazon just adds “au chef de…” in the last bit, so I think it could go either way. [Blazons hoisted from Wikipedia.]\n\nWow, what a digression. Anyway, this would probably be highly disappointing to those contemporary deGruys who seem to have absorbed the notion from somewhere that 1. there is such a thing as a “family crest” or “deGruy coat of arms,” and 2. that it features one or more fleur-de-lis. Neither of those things is precisely true.\n\nArms belong to the person authorized to hold them. When that person dies, they go to a single descendant, not the whole family forever – that’s why you see children with different bits in their names like “du Fouchard” and “Du Mesgnil” etc – different children in essence got different little bits of various titles and holdings. Their arms, if they had them, would be different too. So these arms here belong to whoever it was holding that title whenever the inventory was done – but they do not necessarily belong to any particular child. If you grab some previous generation’s arms and put them on your own letterhead, you are technically guilty of usurpation which is actually still illegal in some countries. Americans, typically, either don’t get it or don’t care and invent or usurp arms for themselves all the time – some of which are really appalling (scroll down to the bottom for some faux heraldry that will make you cringe.)\n\nETA2: I have found a reproduction of these deGruy arms of which a few physical, painted copies were passed down through, I think, some Louisiana branches of the family (in private ownership so I have not uploaded the whole thing, not sure it’s ok), and I have photo-edited, cropped, and used a detail of it as the header of this blog. As you can see, that artist also interprets the chef as surmounting only the one side. But I question this interpretation in particular because the blazon says “l’étoile d’argent soutenue d’un croissant du même” and I am really pretty sure that means the star is supported by the crescent, meaning the crescent is below and the star above, as on the Du Mesgnil site. Plus the colors are definitely off. This is certainly head-scratchy.\n\nETA3: And now I have found a full-color version! The blazon is different from the one given on the Du Mesgnils site, and so the field with the star matches the blazon. Were it following the blazon at the database, it would be red instead of blue. There must be some variations and heirs and such happening here and I can’t sort it all out yet. But anyway. This artist also gives the chef only on half, so I guess I am the odd duck here getting hung up on the full chef and I should concede. The arms of the original du Mesgnil, apparently the first seigneur of Petit-Mesnil etc, was a blue shield with three horizontal stripes of silver. Perhaps the blue/silver would be in keeping with the origins from which the deGruy arms probably derived? And then, maybe the red came in because of the Pampelune connection – Bernarde de Pampelune married Jean de Bossancourt and they had Jean, Edmonde, and Edmond; Edmonde married Edme deGruy. Edme and Edmonde had Claude deGruy, who was seigneur du Mesnil-Fouchard et du Grand-Mesnil (1661) and seigneur de Potemon (1639). And the de Pampelune arms was a shield of silver with a blue crescent and three red stars. Well, who the hell knows if that is even how it works. There are people who could confirm or rule out such a thing and “read” the heraldry to tell us how it evolved over the generations, but I’m not one of them!\n\nETA4: One of the family researchers hired a French genealogist, Philippe Chapelin, who gives the report transcribed here, [link updated 6/13/20] which gives the arms as:\n\ncoupé au 1 parti d’azur à trois pals d’or et d’or à trois pals de gueules; au 2 d’azur à un croissant d’argent sommé d’une étoile du même. Or : Parti: au 1, d’azur, à trois pals d’or ; au 2, d’azur, à une étoile d’argent, surmontée d’un croissant (ou au croissant d’argent surmonté d’une étoile) du même, au chef d’or, chargé de trois pals de gueules.\n\nSo, two versions? The first version I can’t make sense of – does it mean the “1 parti” is further subdivided, into a field of blue with three gold bands and a field of gold with three red bands, and the “2 parti” is a field of blue with a silver crescent surmounted by a silver star? If so, there is no chef at all, and it’s a new entry in the running for what these darned things were supposed to look like. Even if I am totally misreading the first part, there is no chef (and now see ETA5 addition below).\n\nThe second version seems to be a shield divided into two fields, one of blue with three gold bands, the second of blue, with a silver star surmounted by a crescent OR a crescent surmounted by a star (?!) and a gold chef with three red bands. Who knows. (I am looking for a copy of his original report which is supposed to have the images, but I am not uploading any of his research that you can’t find through Google because I didn’t pay him to do this research and I am not sure it’s ok with the person who did pay him that I publicly post any original documents.) [6/13/20 – I don’t even have my own copies of this stuff saved anymore. I’m sure it’s somewhere but all these records moved from where they were archived when I first wrote this post and I have not sorted out where they are now.]\n\nAnyway, Chapelin cites his source as Jougla de Morenas, Grand armorial de France, t. IV, p. 236. He reports that both variants of the arms are drawn in Caumartin. In any case, there is still a lot to be learned about the origins of and connections with the deGruy-Verloin names we have documented in France during this era.\n\nETA5: Ok, when Marie-Jeanne Francoise deGruy-de Verloin, daughter of Antoine Gaspard, entered the school of St. Cyr, founded for young ladies of nobility whose fathers had served the king and had lost their fortunes or lives in military service, her nobility had to be proven or confirmed for her admittance. As of 12 Oct 1723 this was done and testified by Charles d’Hozier, ecuyer, with the deGrui-deVerloin blazon as follows:\n\n“d’azur, a trois pals d’or. Parti d’or [can’t read but could involve “trois”] pals de gueles. Coupe d’azur a [can’t read, could be “croissant”] d’argent [can’t read] de meme.” I don’t think any of the words I can’t read refer to a chef.\n\nETA6: And finally I have seen the relevant drawings in Louis-Francois de Caumartin, Recherche de la noblesse de Champage, 1673. There are two versions.\n\nIf these are the two versions that the genealogist a deGruy cousin hired spoke of, then it looks as if there was indeed one version with a chef across the entire shield, and another in which the chef is only across the one half. And the hand-painted ones in the possession of some family members appear to have some details wrong, unless the variations were authorized in which case they couldn’t possibly belong to any descendant after Jean-Baptiste Antoine Valentin DuFouchard DuMesnil Verloin deGruy, who appears from his extremely bulky name to have inherited every possible title from his parents, leaving his younger brother with no claims to any of the family holdings, and in emigrating to the U.S. thus must have essentially ended the association of Verloin deGruy with landed French nobility – unless he had plans to return. (This is speculation on my part. I don’t actually know exactly how the heir thing worked at this time or if we’ve accounted properly for all heirs and all potential spelling variations. And perhaps there are people still holding these titles in France today who could tell me if I could figure out who to ask.) What a rabbit-hole this has been.\n\nOn the Verloin/Verloing Line\n\nI have not made a translation of this site yet, “Familles issues des seigneurs de Verloing,” but it discusses families descending from de Verloing, Verloin, Verlant, etc. [6/13/20 – the link isn’t dead but the info that was there has been moved or deleted. Here is a Wayback Machine snapshot from Oct. 2009.]\n\nThere is mention of families descending from the Verloings, “seigneur en partie de MAGNIFOUCHARD” (Magny-Fouchard), who evidently became Averdoings. Membership in the house of Averdoing is confirmed by the family arms in the church of Magny-Fouchard and also as given in Courcelles and Chandon. Descendants include Le Perry, de Failly, deGruy de Verloin, Verloin, and Verloing of the USA.\n\nSee also Messr. Arnou’s site on de Verloing, branche de Magny-Fouchard. [1] I can’t tell where the generations are here. Maybe at one point the page was formatted/indented to make it clear, but I can’t figure out what the numbers here designate in every case.\n\nAccording to Eugene Ray, the Seigneury of Magny-Fouchard was originally in the family of Villeneuve (ca. 1425), then it passed to the deVerloin son-in-law. The deVerloing held Magny-Fouchard until about 1525 when it passed to a lePerry whose mother was a deVerloing. The granddaughter Jean le Perry then married Claude deGruy in 1639. This, so they say, is where the deGruy-deVerloin connection begins. [6/13/20: most of what follows is newly added as of today]\n\nSo cross-referencing Arnou’s information, this is the Jeanne de la Villeneuve cited in 1504 who married Daniel or David de Verloing, the aforementioned deVerloin son-in-law.\n\nThey had a son Guillaume de Verloing, squire, lord “in part” of Magny-Fouchard, cited 1534, 1540, 1548, who had something to do with Jaucourt along with his mother’s nieces who were associated with Lacroix and Laval, and I cannot sort what this means but it’s something about how they had 4/5ths of half a share of la Villeneuve?! I really don’t know.\n\nSo Guillaume had, I think, four children – Jean, Jacques-Guillaume, Antoine, and Madeleine. His son Jean de Verloing inherited his father’s house at Magny-Fouchard, if I’m reading this right, and took 1/20th out of 4/5ths of half (?) of la Villeneuve before sharing it with his brothers. Y’all, I don’t even know.\n\nSo the de Verloings had at this point half of Villeneuve and these Lacroix and Laval nieces had the other half? Or the de Verloing children and the nieces had half all together? Not sure. In any case, I believe Jean, Antoine, and Madeleine all ceded their shares in half of Villeneuve to their brother Jacques-Guillaume.\n\nAnyway, this Jacques-Guillaume was, i think, lord of Magny-Fouchard in 1548, and he “reunites” 4/5ths of half of Magnifouchard, excepting *something* that I do not understand – something about the 20th that Jean de Verloing took before sharing with his brothers? [2]\n\nJacques-Guillaume sells the seigneurial house to Claude Senneton before 1550. [3] In 1558 Jacques-Guillaume divides his property between his children, possibly by two different wives, Charlotte de Champigny and Louise de Saint-Simon, or I could be misreading. And this says something else about Villeneuve that I don’t understand – but I think it means Charlotte is lady of the fifth of half of Villeneuve?\n\nAnd then this Louise de Saint-Simon is in 1559 lady of Magny-Fouchard – so second wife?? Really not sure. I believe the children of this Jacques-Guillaume de Verloing are 1. Antoine de Verloing, who gave up his rights in Magny-Fouchard to his sister 2. Jeanne de Verloing, and 3. their brother Jean who died young.\n\nThis Jeanne de Verloing, who now has all the de Verloing rights to Magny-Fouchard (?), marries Leonard le Perry. So this is when Magny-Fouchard passed to a le Perry whose mother was a de Verloing per Eugene Ray. [4] Jeanne de Verloing as a widow is cited as living in Paris on rue des Noyers under the sign of the Red Hat (?). But I’m not sure about her children, where the Magny-Fouchard rights went specifically. [5] But one of her granddaughters was Jean le Perry who married Claude deGruy.\n\nRegardless of the origins, it’s really interesting how long “Verloin deGruy” survived as a family name – there are Verloin deGruys walking around the US as I write this; I personally have no less than six living relatives bearing the name today, including my father, and when I was younger I had a dozen. It’s often resented as it causes all sorts of trouble when a young man is in school – talk about a name Americans cannot pronounce – but the history is so interesting.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Looks like Antoine de Verloing (died 1559? maybe not) who married Louise d’Allamont had arms with a silver crescent – note to self to come back to this and translate. But for all I know a silver crescent merely means that the bearer was a second son of a given line or something and has absolutely nothing to do with helping us trace any connections here. I should really learn something more about heraldry.\n\nAnyway, Antoine had a sister named Madeleine who married Jacques Le Clerc, and they had a daughter Jeanne Le Clerc who married Rene de la Rochere. The Roche/de la Roche tribe is huge and sprawling across the globe and there is almost certainly no detectable connection to the other Roches in my family tree on the Conner-Tally-Hall side who emerge in Florida, but I’m making a note *just in case* – you never know.\n\nMadeleine’s name is apparently spelled de Virloing in the paperwork after her death in 1548 to do with custody of her minor children. Or else there is a transcription error.\n\n[2] A footnote on Magny-Fouchard says, I think, that it is altitude 216 meters, 37 km from Troyes, 16 from Bar (? must be Bar sur Aube?), 5 from Vendouevre, bailiwick of Troyes, government of Champagne, election of Bar sur Aube, consisting of 1,517 hectares territory? Had the name Fulchart-Mesnil in 1179, plundered in 1616? A church there called Sainte Madeleine and in 1636 a school. Castle demolished in 1950s. Three notarial (?) studies: Baussencourt, Vendouevre, and Bar sur Aube?\n\n[3] It appears Senneton had two sons, Jean and Francois, who called themselves lords of Magny-Fouchard in 1571. So in selling the seigneurial house, Jacques-Guillaume was selling part of the share in Magny-Fouchard as well? Per a source called Caulin, this share was 1/50th of the whole and was sold in 1594 to Gabriel le Genevois de Bligny who had something to do with Jaucourt.\n\n[4] Except I can’t make sense of what Arnou’s site says here – something to do with Magnifouchard in 1602 and a Saint-Antoine chapel at the church of Magnifouchard – is this their marriage date? – and then something about some villages associated with Magny-Fouchard being destroyed.\n\nThere’s a de Roch in a later generation here also, possibly this Jean de Guignes is lord of de Roch, who is father of Jeanne de Guignes who married a Libaudiere. Or I could be misreading this.\n\n[5] There’s mention of 1640 declaration about a factory that became the property of Jeanne de Verloing the year prior. I’m not sure the significance or if this is just a citation of historical evidence. She apparently set up a charity for the poor in the region. Income from the factory was to pay for an annual service and the maintenance of a stained glass window in Saint-Antoine Chapel, where her family was buried, I think, and which showed the arms of the de Verloings.\n\nShe had a reputation as very pious, according to this. Every year on Holy Thursday she gave dinner to 13 poor people in honor of Christ and his 12 disciples, and afterwards gave each five pence in honor of the five plagues??? Must be reading this wrong. In 1638 she makes her will and commends her soul to the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the dwellers in heaven. She sets up a fund from the factory income to ensure her family continues the Holy Thursday tradition and in addition set aside some bushels of flour so that whatever poor person comes calling on that day may have a loaf of bread, some beans, oil, and salt.\n\nThen it says the Verloing name died with her. She wanted 12 wax torches accompanying her coat of arms at her funeral and at the end of the year and at something about 40 days. I’m lost. But she wanted 12 poor people to carry the torches and to receive 5 sous each for this. Also at these three occasions flour would be given to the poor of Brouilleux and Vaux, and then something about bread and wine every Sunday for a year following her death.\n\nShe was buried near her husband in the Chapel de Verloing, part of the Chapel of Saint-Antoine, and bequeathed money for the upkeep of the stained glass window with the Verloing arms in the chapel. She also bequeathed a feather bed and bolster to Jeanne de Serpes, her great-granddaughter (wow). She left 30 pounds and her mourning (clothes?) to her servant? Not sure about this.\n\nAnyone with better French or better info please correct any mistakes I’ve made here.\n\nUpdates/Edits:\n\n6/13/20: lots of broken links, sorry. Updated a couple of links – see bracketed notes.\n\nMade a first rough pass at figuring out what is being shown on Arnou’s de Verloing site. Added footnotes.\n\nAlso, see comments for a living VerloindeGruy, all one surname, that I’m probably not spelling the way they spell it, who dropped by and left a comment (a few years ago when I was offline for a while). Drop by any time!"
