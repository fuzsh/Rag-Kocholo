        "text": "Biography\n\nLittle is known about Gervaise, other than that he is the author of a verse Bestiaire in a Norman dialect of French. He is thought to have lived around the end of the twelfth century to the beginning of the thirteenth, and was possibly a member of a Cistercian abbey at Barberie (or Barbery) in the diocese of Bayeux, established in 1176. Meyer notes that there were three men named Gervaise in the area at the time, and says that the most likely one was the priest Gervasius of Fontenai.\n\nThe Bestiaire\n\nIn the prologue to the Bestiaire, Gervaise names himself as author, and says he created the rhymed verses based on a manuscript in Latin that he found in a cupboard in \"Barbarie\". It is not known which Latin text Gervaise used (it may have been British Library, Sloane MS 278), though he ascribes it to John Chrysostom, who was one of the many early Greek writers said to be the author of the Physiologus.\n\nGervaise probably wrote his poem around the beginning of the thirteenth century. It does not seem to have been well known in his time; it appears in only a single manuscript (British Library, Additional MS 28260), a late thirteenth century copy of Gervaise's original.\n\nEditions\n\nAn edition of the Bestiaire of Gervaise was produced by Paul Meyer in 1872. A version of the text is available in the Digital Text Library.\n\nChapters\n\nThe 29 chapters of the Bestiaire are (from McCulloch, p. 56 and Meyer, p. 5-6):\n\nLine Folio Lion (lion) 59 85r Panthere (panther) 139 87r Unicorne (unicorn) 239 88v Idres et Cocadrile (hydrus and crocodile) 281 89r Sereine (siren) 305 89v Centaurus (onocentaur) 320 89v Hyene (hyena) 345 90r Singe (ape) 361 90r Elephant (elephant) 381 90r Antule (antelope) 449 91r Serpent et Vuivre (snake and viper) 501 91v Corbeau (raven) 621 93r Vurpil (fox) 655 93v Castor (beaver) 685 93v EriÃ§on (hedgehog) 729 94r Formi (ant) 755 94v Aille (eagle) 829 95v Caradrius (caladrius) 863 96r Pellicanus (pelican) 887 96r Perdriz (partridge) 921 96v Chamoi (ostrich) 951 97r Huppe (hoopoe) 985 97r Phenix (phoenix) 1009 97v Cerf (stag) 1053 98r Tortre (turtledove) 1087 98v Sarce (sawfish) 1105 98v Belete (weasel) 1137 99r Aspis (asp) 1151 99r Ibis (ibis) 1177 99v"
