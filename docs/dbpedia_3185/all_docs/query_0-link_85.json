        "text": "It’s one of the best days of the year, GALENTINE’S DAY! Coined by Parks and Recreation character Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) back in 2010, Galentine’s has since been recognised by girls across the globe and used as a light-hearted platform to celebrate the girls and women who enrich our lives.\n\nTo celebrate, we’ve chosen tracks from some of the many female-identifying artists who inspire us and we’ve put them into one eclectic playlist. We’re all about self-love and sisterly – not just cis-terly – love today, so scroll down, press play and share the Galentine’s joy!\n\nBikini Kill – ‘Rebel Girl’\n\nThis one goes out to my GIHE gals, Tash and Kate! A song about having the coolest best friend by ultimate heroes Bikini Kill, you should listen to it at full volume and celebrate all the “queens” of your world this Galentine’s Day. (Mari Lane)\n\nProblem Patterns – ‘Gal Pals’\n\nHaving been fans of Northern Irish band Problem Patterns for some time now, my love of them has skyrocketed since they headlined our gig at The Shacklewell Arms in December. Oozing a swirling energy and fierce, infectious passion, they united the crowd in solidarity with both their righteous anger and vibrant, joyous sense of fun. ‘Gal Pals’ offers a perfect sentiment for this Galentine’s – celebrating female friendship and the mix of feelings that comes with it. (ML)\n\nPetty Phase – ‘Different For Girls’\n\nSouthend’s Petty Phase aka Jen, Rosie & Alyx were guests on our radio show a few years ago and they played a GIHE gig at The Finsbury back in 2018 too. We loved their riot grrrl inspired sounds and rumour has it they’re set to play some more shows this summer. Bassist Alyx has also been busy co-hosting the excellent We Wear Black podcast alongside Sophie K and Yasmine, talking about all things in the rock & alternative scenes. Definitely check it out. (Kate Crudgington)\n\nBig Joanie – ‘Used To Be Friends’\n\nThe GIHE team are huge fans of Big Joanie who work tirelessly to make the punk scene a more inclusive and diverse space. Not only that, they’ve got a debut album full of lo-fi punk bangers that we’ve listened to many times. Check out Sistahs today and keep up to date with all the amazing work they do on and off stage by following them on Twitter. (KC)\n\nCharmpit – ‘Bridges Go Burn’\n\nCharmpit’s ‘Bridges Go Burn’ is not so much a celebration of friendship as an empowering ode to moving on from toxic relationships and standing up for yourself. But I think this sentiment is super important when celebrating the ones you love. As I’ve got older, I’ve realised the necessity in cutting ties with damaging people, however many fond memories you might share with them; life really is too short to surround yourself with people who don’t lift you up and make you feel good. In the words of the band: “It can take time to burn a bridge, especially when it’s guarded by a troll. You can forgive yourself for taking the time you needed to exit that toxic relationship. And when you exit it, you can write a pop banger so it ain’t so dang depressing!” (ML)\n\nWILLOW – ‘transparent soul’\n\nHow many times am I going to say “I am living for the pop punk revival!” on a GIHE Playlist? (at least once more.) WILLOW’s debut album Lately I Feel Everything is full of emo bangers and this track featuring Travis Barker on drums is no exception. (KC)\n\nBrimheim – ‘hey amanda’\n\nAn ode to friendship in all its bittersweet glory, I love this track by Danish alt-pop artist Brimheim. Taken from her sublime debut album, can’t hate myself into a different shape, it’s a celebration of platonic love, brimming with nostalgic lyrics, warm guitar sounds and tender vocals. (KC)\n\nVERO – ‘Beg!’\n\nFuelled by the anger left behind by a flawed relationship, VERO’s debut single ‘Beg!’ is saturated with brooding bass lines, swirling riffs and stinging lyrics. I LOVE it and can’t wait to hear more from the Stockholm-based trio this year. (KC)\n\nSoftcult – ‘Gloomy Girl’\n\nI’m a big fan of Canadian twin siblings Phoenix and Mercedes Arn Horn aka Softcult, who create swirling, grunge-infused songs about inequality & sexism within the music industry. This track ‘Gloomy Girl’ is a more introspective offering, giving listeners a glimpse behind the veil of depression. It’s a tentative musing on the ominous feeling that you’re “wasting away” whilst going through a period of poor mental health. Their recent EP Year Of The Snake is also well worth a listen. (KC)\n\nAye Nako – ‘Nightcrawler’\n\nThis melodic tune from Brooklyn-based queer punks Aye Nako popped into my head the other day and it’s been on a loop ever since. The song is about unpacking difficult memories, but Aye Nako deliver it in their quirky, upbeat style. (KC)\n\nSASAMI – ‘Say It’\n\nThis industrial-tinged “rage dance anthem” from SASAMI is 100% a bit of me. Taken from her upcoming album Squeeze, which is set for release on 25th February via Domino, SASAMI explains: “I feel like when I hear this song I see a hot femme with a mystical flamethrower engulfed in emotional blue flames throwing elbows alone in an industrial dance club in outer space.” Mate, same. (KC)\n\nM(h)aol – ‘No One Ever Talks To Us’\n\nI was blown away by M(h)aol’s powerful post punk sounds when I saw them live at The Shacklewell Arms last year, and this track was a real highlight. Taken from their debut EP Gender Studies, it’s a brooding, much needed antidote to toxic patriarchal standards. (KC)\n\nSelf Esteem – ‘How Can I Help You’\n\nI don’t know why chanting along to “I don’t know shit!” throughout this Self Esteem song is so cathartic, but I fully recommend doing the same. Rebecca Lucy Taylor has proved she’s an alt-pop icon twice over with her album Prioritize Pleasure, and this track in particular is my favourite. (KC)\n\nWet Leg – ‘Too Late Now’\n\nBest friends Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers aka Wet Leg look like they’re having a blast touring their tongue-in-cheek indie bangers across the country. The GIHE caught their debut headline show at Omeara last year and knew they’d be icons from the moment they walked on to the stage to ‘Concerning Hobbits’ from The Fellowship Of The Ring soundtrack. I really, really enjoy the lyrics in this track, especially the line: “I don’t need no dating app to tell me if I look like crap / to tell me if I’m thin or fat / to tell me should I shave my rat.” Their self-titled debut album is set for release on 8th April and I can’t wait to hear it. (KC)\n\nARXX – ‘The Cat Song’\n\nI couldn’t not include a song from total faves ARXX in this playlist celebrating friendship and love, as Hanni and Clara are two of the loveliest folks in the world – and their love of each other is evident in everything they do. ‘The Cat Song’ – as well as paying homage to our feline friends – is also about the love we have for our friends. As Hanni sings “I’m going to hold you up like this”, I think of how my friends hold me up throughout the bad times and good. And there’s added actual cat sounds – what’s not to love?! (ML)\n\nRobyn – ‘Dancing On My Own’\n\n‘Dancing On My Own’, and what’s wrong with that!? Often I prefer to dance on my own. More space. Robyn is also an outspoken ally for LGBTQ+ rights and we all know romance isn’t just for the heterosexuals out there! So whether you honour Galentine’s, Valentine’s, or even Palentine’s Day; make sure you have a good old dance. (TW)\n\nChromatics – ‘Girls Just Wanna Have Fun’\n\nA great cover of a great track, need I say more? (TW)\n\nElodie Gervaise – ‘Free Babe’\n\nOne of my favourite discoveries of 2021: mixed beats, intricate synths and electronics from French-Australian artist Elodie Gervaise. When I first played this song I described it as some kind of audible light show. Elodie Gervaise’s EP, Syzygy (undoubtedly my word sound of the year) is great – go listen if you haven’t heard it yet! (TW)\n\nML Buch – ‘I’m a Girl You can Hold IRL’\n\nThis song is taken from Danish electro-pop musician ML Buch’s album Skinned which came out in 2020, but I spent a lot of the winter break listening to it so thought I’d share it with you all in 2022. I love its futuristic techno electro tones and all the FEELINGS. (TW)\n\nLizzo – ‘Like A Girl’\n\nTurning the common derogatory phrase ‘Like A Girl’ on its head to create something wonderfully empowering, this is another ferociously fun offering from GIHE fave, Lizzo. With references to other powerful women of colour, including Lauryn Hill and Serena Williams, it’s the perfect ode to the power of being female and the power felt when women unite. So, this Galentine’s Day, I’ll leave you with the Lizzo’s words of wisdom: “If you fight like a girl, cry like a girl, do your thing, run the whole damn world”. An ultimate feel-good anthem for women everywhere. (ML)\n\nAretha Franklin & Annie Lennox – ‘Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves’\n\nIt it even a Galentine’s playlist if this absolute classic isn’t on it? These two talented women coming together to sing about equality and independence never fails to make me feel good. It may have been released in 1985, but the lyrics are just as relevant today. (KC)\n\nSheryl Crow – ‘All I Wanna Do’\n\nHaving just celebrated her 60th birthday, Sheryl Crow has been a hero of mine from a young age. With her perfectly catchy anthems, she’s been my go-to uplifting soundtrack over the years. This song reminds me of dancing around the kitchen with my oldest friend during carefree times, and it still makes me wiggle and sing-a-long on each listen, over 20 years later. (ML)\n\nGirl Ray – ‘Friend Like That’\n\nAn ode to friendship, ‘Friend Like That’ flows with the trio’s colourful energy, creating a dreamily uplifting offering. Of the track, the band explain: “This is a friendship anthem. Reminds us of a really smashing high five with great contact. In music, friend love is often overshadowed by romantic love and IT’S JUST WRONG. This one goes out to the mates of the world.” (ML)\n\nFightmilk – ‘Overbite’\n\nAs the raw emotion and distinctive smooth-yet-husky charm of front-person Lily’s vocals deliver a heartwarming sentiment (“You don’t have to smile if you don’t want to darling, you’re perfect as you are”) alongside scuzzed-out riffs and an infectious, shimmering energy, Fightmilk have created the perfect, alternative fuzzy love-song. A totally joyous ode to your best pal or lover, or both, it offers another slice of blissful power-pop from one of my favourite bands. Fightmilk headline for us at The Shacklewell Arms on 25th March and we can’t wait! Tickets on DICE. (ML)\n\nBAXTR – ‘Grace On Fire’\n\nReflecting on the feelings of helplessness that come with seeing someone you love suffer, ‘Grace On Fire’ is a sweeping slice of alt-pop. Propelled by an uplifting energy, it’s a wonderfully anthemic ode to looking out for your friends – as singer Floss expands: “These days, I try not to overlook those simple yet precious 3 words that did so much to help douse my own flames… ‘are you ok?’” BAXTR were due to play their first ever gig for us on 24th February, but have sadly had to pull out as one of them is currently recovering from surgery – we’re sending them all loads of love and Galentine’s wishes, and look forward to them playing for us later in the year! (ML)\n\nCarole King – ‘You’ve Got A Friend’\n\nCarole King’s Tapestry continues to be one of my most favourite albums. It’s my mum’s favourite too, and I have many memories of singing along with this uplifting message of unity and platonic love with her over the years, both reaching for the tissues when we saw it live in the musical, Beautiful. So, this heartfelt anthem goes out to her, my all time favourite gal, who inspires me every day. (ML)\n\nJackie Shane – ‘Any Other Way’\n\nI know I’m guilty of adding this tune to multiple GIHE Playlists, but it’s so good I can’t help it! Jackie Shane’s wonderfully smooth vocals, sophisticated style and defiance in the face of transphobia in the early ’60s make her a true GIHE icon. Whenever I hear this song, I think of using it as an opening track to many a GIHE radio show, sitting next to Tash & Mari in the studio, chatting about our favourite music on air (and laughing at my penchant for sad girl bangerz off air too.) This tune is dedicated to them both and to all of our followers who keep GIHE going. We wouldn’t have it any other way. Big love. xxx (KC)\n\nThe GIHE team have unearthed more new music gems for you to listen to on our October Playlist! There’s an eclectic mix of indie anthems, gritty guitar tunes, alt-pop tracks & immersive electronic sounds. Take some time to scroll through our track choices below and make sure you hit play on the Spotify playlist at the end of this post.\n\nFollow GIHE on Spotify to hear all of our previous playlists too.\n\nBoy Harsher – ‘Tower’\n\nIt’s almost Halloween (aka Goth Christmas) so this shadowy electronic tune is a great way to kick off our October Playlist. Boy Harsher are fully leaning in to their cinematic tendencies on ‘Tower’ which is taken from their upcoming album The Runner. Set for release on 21st January, the record will be a “musical counterpart” to an accompanying short film written, produced & directed by the talented duo. (Kate Crudgington)\n\nBrimheim – ‘poison fizzing on a tongue’\n\nThe recent single from Danish alt-pop artist Brimheim, ‘poison fizzing on a tongue’ oozes a glitchy, ethereal splendour. With its soaring, other-wordly allure, it reminds me of the dark majesty of Massive Attack, which is no bad thing! Brimheim releases her debut album Can’t Help Myself Into A Different Shape in January next year. (Mari Lane)\n\ndeep tan – ‘Tamu’s Yiffing Refuge’\n\nFollowing the recent release of their stirring, and utterly unique EP creeping speedwells, East London trio deep tan return with a special one-off single, taken from the label Speedy Wunderground’s new compilation. As strangely kinky as the name would suggest, ‘tamu’s yiffing refuge’ is an explicit tale of furry hedonism. Maintaining all the immersive, seductive allure that we’ve come to know and love from the band, this latest offering oozes an added dark, psychedelic haze and frenzied post-punk drive reminiscent of the likes of legends The Slits. A truly mystical, compelling soundscape that’ll peculiarly entice you into its swirling, fur-filled cacophony. (ML)\n\nNew Pagans – ‘Find Fault With Me’\n\nI am thrilled that Belfast’s New Pagans are BACK with this brilliant new single after the release of their debut album, The Seed, The Vessel, The Roots And All earlier this year. Vocalist Lyndsey McDougall says this track is about “checking in with each other and recognising when someone around you needs support.” (KC)\n\nDeath Valley Girls – ‘It’s All Really Kind Of Amazing’\n\nA stand alone single from LA dystopian punk band Death Valley Girls, ‘It’s All Really Kind Of Amazing‘ offers a swift glimpse of positivity. As the raw, impassioned splendour of Bonnie Bloomgarden’s vocals soar throughout, it seems to be slightly less doom-laden in tone than previous offerings, but is no less stirring. Oozing a shimmering, trippy allure and swirling, vibrant energy reminiscent of The Kinks’ ‘Sunny Afternoon’, ‘it immerses the listener in its glistening euphoric haze, reminding us to relish those rare moments of beauty that can keep us going through challenging times. A mystically captivating retreat for the ears and mind. (ML)\n\nLaura Lee & The Jettes – ‘Craigslist Boy’\n\nI have drummer Eilis Frawley to thank for introducing me to this BANGER from German-based band Laura Lee & The Jettes. Eilis provides the beats for this playful anthem about vocalist Laura Lee’s experience of being pursued romantically by random men on the German version of eBay. Its relatability will make you laugh and eye roll in equal measure. Check out the accompanying video here. (KC)\n\nWet Leg – ‘Wet Dream’\n\nLike everyone else with ears, I am OBSESSED with Isle of Wight duo Wet Leg. I caught them at their debut London show at Omeara last week and it was a JOY to listen to their infectious indie anthems. They also walked on stage to ‘Concerning Hobbits’ from The Lord Of The Rings soundtrack, which is an iconic move in itself. (KC)\n\nQueen Cult – ‘Show & Tell’\n\nThe latest single from Cheshire band Queen Cult, ‘Show & Tell’ builds with a gritty, swirling energy to an empowered call to arms. I just can’t get enough of its relentless, searing force. (ML)\n\nNghtfall – ‘Evil Eye’\n\nFollowing the heartfelt release of ‘I’ll Be Fine’ earlier this year, Toronto based non-binary artist Bradley Milosevic-Hill aka Nghtfall has recently shared ‘Evil Eye’. A sweeping slice of catchy anthemic pop, it oozes swirling feelings of anticipation and desire, creating a twinkling, emotion-strewn ballad. (ML)\n\ngirlhouse – ‘boundary issues’\n\nI love this latest track from indie artist girlhouse, taken from her recent EP which is aptly titled, the second EP, quite simply lovely stuff. (Tash Walker)\n\nHAVVK – ‘Halfway Out’\n\nTaken from total faves HAVVK’s epic new album Levelling, stirring single ‘Halfway Out’ oozes an ethereal splendour as the haunting, celestial power of Julie’s vocals immerses the listener instantly. The whole album intertwines this captivating, twinkling majesty with a grunge-tinged grit throughout, and I can’t stop listening to it. I had the pleasure of chatting to front person Julie about the album and more last week – have a read of the interview here. (ML)\n\nSprints – ‘Modern Job’\n\nI first heard Dublin’s Sprints on The Irish Jam radio show and I’m super grateful to them for the introduction. ‘Modern Job’, which is also the title track on the band’s upcoming EP (due on 11th March) is a scathing “critique of modern existence” and “an exploration of growing up queer” according to vocalist Karla Chubb. I can’t wait to hear the record in full. (KC)\n\nNova Twins – ‘Antagonist’\n\nGIHE faves Nova Twins have shared this MASSIVE anthem about believing in yourself, full of their trademark lethal riffs and powerhouse vocals. (KC)\n\nTiger Mimic – ‘Silence Of The Night’\n\nPropelled by an eerie energy, ‘Silence Of The Night’ reflects on the grim reality that women have to navigate on a daily basis. As the rich, sleek vocals of front woman Jess soar with a soulful power, it builds with a stirring tension to an impassioned statement of intent. A poignant call for justice and accountability at a time when we so desperately need it. You can catch the band live at The Victoria in Dalston on 9th December. (ML)\n\nSister Lucy – ‘Big Kid’\n\nThe second single from her upcoming EP Big Girl Pants, Sister Lucy aka Abi Sinclair’s single ‘Big Kid’ is a lush, grunge-tinged reflection on growth and womanhood. She’ll be playing a gig at The Shacklewell Arms on the 10th November to celebrate the EP’s release. (KC)\n\nElodie Gervaise – ‘Free Babe’\n\nI am so into this song! All its mixed beats, intricate synths and electronics, it’s such a visually evocative track, you can just imagine the light show watching this being performed live. French-Australian artist, Elodie Gervaise’s new EP, Syzygy – which just feels oh so good to say – is out now. (TW)\n\nErrunhrd – ‘Ruminate (Meditate)’\n\nNiagra Falls based artist Errunhrd has penned this buoyant new track which shifts away from her previously more melancholic sounds. ‘Ruminate (Meditate)’ is taken from her debut album You Can Be You, I Can Be Me, which is set for release on 19th November. (KC)\n\nBlonde Maze – ‘One House’\n\nThe latest single from New York artist Blonde Maze, ‘One House’ revolves around the comfort of finding a home in someone, especially after a long time of feeling misplaced. Oozing a blissful, soulful splendour, it flows with an utterly dreamy allure as Amanda’s soothing vocals ripple alongside twinkling electro hooks. Lately, as I’ve been going through a bit of a tough time, I’ve had this pretty much on a loop, and its sweeping euphoric energy helps to calm my mind instantly. Thank you Blonde Maze for another perfectly cathartic creation. And I’m SO excited that Blonde Maze’s debut album Something Familiar is set for release next week, 3rd November – haven’t looked forward to an album this much for a long time! (ML)\n\nMai – ‘Control’\n\nAn evocative electronic gem that urges listeners to surrender to the inevitability of change, I love Essex-based musician & vocalist Mai’s has debut single ‘Control’. Released via Cool Thing Records, the track is a collaboration between Mai aka Rosie Gulliver of Petty Phase, and songwriter and producer Liam Watkins from A Cause In Distress. (KC)\n\nBISHI ft. Nikesh Shukla – ‘Language Is an Ocean’\n\nMulti-instrumentalist and GIHE fave BISHI released her third album Let My Country Awake earlier this month, which this single is taken from. The record explores dual identities and urges listeners to lean into compassion and empathy in a chaotic and disconnected world. (KC)\n\nDesire Marea – ‘You Think I’m Horny’ (Planningtorock’s ‘Planningtobehorny’ Version)\n\nTash & I are still on a high after seeing Planningtorock at Scala earlier this month, so when their remix of Desire Marea’s track ‘You Think I’m Horny’ dropped into my inbox I knew it was going straight on to our playlist! A great collaboration from two fantastic, unique artists. (KC)\n\nAZADI.mp3 – ‘NAZAR’\n\nI’ve been listening to the We Are Lady Parts playlist on Spotify recently and the algorithms led me to AZADI.mp3 – aka Juliette Motamed who plays drummer Ayesha in the hit Channel 4 show. She has a great set of electronic tunes that I’ve been listening to ever since. (KC)\n\nAtna – ‘Smile’\n\n“Why why why why why” …give me bizarre warped repetitive vocals from German avant-pop duo Atna ANY DAY. (TW)\n\nLittle Simz – ‘Speed’\n\nLittle Simz has done it again, latest album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert (in my case it’s always) is a total, immense masterpiece. ‘Speed’ is my favourite track on the album, in the same vein as previous faves ‘Boss’ and ‘Offence’, it’s propelled by a gritty, driving energy and Simz’s spot on lyricism, with a touch of orchestral grandeur. The perfect motivational anthem I’ve needed lately to get me through the day. (ML)\n\nKay Young ft. JNR WILLIAMS – ‘I’ve Got You’\n\n‘I’ve Got You’ by London based artist, rapper and producer Kay Young featuring JNR Williams is such a feel good song! It’s taken from her EP This Here Feels Good, released via Play It Again Sam. (TW)\n\nDuval Timothy ft. Lil Silva & Melanie Faye – ‘Fall Again’\n\nI am totally obsessed and in love with this song. Rhythmic piano to start, before it slowly layers and builds with hazy, gentle vocals sweeping over the top. Such a dreamy sonic soundscape that feels so good in my ears. (TW)\n\nAnna Vincent – ‘Naxos’\n\nHaving previously charmed us fronting indie-pop outfit Heavy Heart, and as a touring member of Happyness, after two decades making music London based Anna Vincent has now launched her first solo venture. With her debut album, Under The Glass (out today on Max Bloom of Yuck’s new label Ultimate Blends), she has recently been charming our ears with a number of shimmering singles, like the beautifully heartfelt ‘Naxos’. Exuding a spellbinding majestic grace alongside the stirring heartfelt emotion of Anna’s exquisite sparkling vocals, each track offers a truly blissful, captivating soundscape. (ML)\n\nCMAT -‘No More Virgos’\n\nBorn from her desire to “marry her love of 80’s Italo disco with her hatred of Virgos,” Irish pop sensation CMAT’s playful new tune is a wry nod to her compulsive romantic decisions. “My mental health is banking on my chastity / and you’re bad for me” she jests over buoyant melodies, gently resisting the urge to circle back and repeat the same pattern of behaviour in her previous relationships. I’m so excited to hear CMAT’s debut album, If My Wife New I’d Be Dead, which is set for release via AWAL Recordings on 25th February 2022 (KC)"
