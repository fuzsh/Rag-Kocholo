        "text": "Gervais History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nThe ancestors of the Gervais family arrived in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. The name Gervais came from the Norman personal name Gervase. The surname Gervais indicates that the bearer is a descendant of someone named Gervase. 1\n\nGervase of Canterbury (Gervasius Dorobornensis) (fl. 1188), was an English \"chronicler, was born, apparently of a Kentish family, about 1141. As he had a brother Thomas in his monastery, who is conjectured to be identical with one Thomas of Maidstone, we have a possible clue to his birthplace; but the information is too imperfect to warrant more than an hypothesis. Gervase became a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, on the first Saturday in Lent, 16 Feb. 1163.\" 2\n\nGervase of Chichester (fl. 1170), was an English commentator, one of the band of learned young men who gathered round Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury and Gervase of Tilbury (fl. 1211), was author of the ‘Otia Imperialia,’ was no doubt a native of Tilbury in Essex, though he appears to have been brought up in Rome, and to have spent some years of his early life in Italy. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Gervais family\n\nThe surname Gervais was first found in Cornwall. The Gervais surname also spelled Jarvis, Gervays and Gervis, was first found in Mobonnaiss and Vallee, in Brettagne, the ancient name for Brittany, and arrived in England with William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066. 3\n\nThe first records of the family were listed in their Latin form, as in John filius Gervacii, Cambridgeshire; William filius Gervasii, Huntingdonshire; and Stephen Gervcis, Cambridgeshire. All were listed in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Gervais family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Gervais research. Another 176 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1262, 1268, 1273, 1379, 1393, 1397, 1410, 1587, 1616, 1621, 1625, 1628, 1629, 1640, 1653, 1654, 1666, 1667, 1675, 1693, 1739, 1799 and 1804 are included under the topic Early Gervais History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGervais Spelling Variations\n\nIt is only in the last few hundred years that the English language has been standardized. For that reason, Anglo-Norman surnames like Gervais are characterized by many spelling variations. Scribes and monks in the Middle Ages spelled names they sounded, so it is common to find several variations that refer to a single person. As the English language changed and incorporated elements of other European languages such as Norman French and Latin, even literate people regularly changed the spelling of their names. The variations of the name Gervais include Gervais, Gervays, Gervis, Jarvis, Jervis and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Gervais family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nJohn Gervais, (died 1268), an early English clergyman, Bishop of Carlisle in 1262 and Bishop of Winchester (1262-1268)\n\nGervais World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Gervais is the 6,036th most popular surname with an estimated 4,974 people with that name. 5 However, in Canada, the name Gervais is ranked the 248th most popular surname with an estimated 16,388 people with that name. 6 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Gervais is the 146th popular surname. 7 France ranks Gervais as 336th with 11,930 people. 8\n\nMigration of the Gervais family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Gervais family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 229 words (16 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGervais migration to the United States +\n\nFaced with the chaos present in England at that time, many English families looked towards the open frontiers of the New World with its opportunities to escape oppression and starvation. People migrated to North America, as well as Australia and Ireland in droves, paying exorbitant rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, but those who did see the shores of North America were welcomed with great opportunity. Many of the families that came from England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America carried the name Gervais, or a variant listed above:\n\nGervais Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nThomas Gervais who settled in Maryland in 1634\n\nGervais Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nPierre Gervais, who settled in Louisiana in 1756\n\nCharles Nicholas D.
