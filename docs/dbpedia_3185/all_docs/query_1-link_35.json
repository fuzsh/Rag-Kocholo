If you want to search for records for a spelling variant of Gervaise, or for any other family name, just click below on the first letter of the\n\nfamily name you are interested in. This will open a new tab in your browser giving you a list of family names beginning with that letter,\n\nfor which there are baptism records in our database of half a million church and public registry records.\n\nYou can also select marriages or burials. Select the name you want\n\nand when the list of records is displayed you can easily refine the search, choosing a single parish, given name(s) and/or start and end dates.\n\nThe records are displayed 30 to a page, but by selecting the yellow Wiki Table option at the top left of the page you can open a full, scrollable list. This list will either be displayed in a new tab or a pop-up window. You may have to edit the settings of your browser to allow pop-up windows for www.jerripediabmd.net. For the small number of family names for which a search generates more than 1,500 records you will have to refine your search (perhaps using start or end dates) to reduce the number of records found.\n\nNew records\n\nFrom August 2020 we have started adding records from non-Anglican churches, and this process will continue as more records, held by Jersey Archive, are digitised and indexed. Our database now includes buttons enabling a search within registers of Roman Catholic, Methodist and other non-conformist churches. These records will automatically appear within the results of any search made from this page.\n\nIf you can help with information about the Gervaise family, please contact editorial@jerripedia.org, using Jerripedia as the subject of your email. We are particularly interested in information which will help create further family trees, family histories and photographs\n\nA blue link anywhere in the text will lead you to another page with more information on this family\n\nOrigin of Surname\n\nGeorge Balleine refers to the personal name of Gervaise of two 13th Century English writers, Gervase of Canterbury and Gervase of Tilbury, to explain the derivation of this Jersey surname, which appears first in the Short Inquisition of 1274.\n\nThe name is very common in Normandy today, spelt Gervais, and it is far from certain whether the name came to Jersey from Normandy or England, although the former is probably more likely. Some suggest that the name may have originated in Jersey, but there is no real evidence of any names originating in Jersey and then becoming common in Normandy, or elsewhere in France. Several surnames, which early researchers suggested were of Jersey origin, have, with the benefit of access to wider records, now been conclusively proved to have originated elsewhere and to have been brought to Jersey by immigrants.\n\nIt certainly derives from the personal name \"Gervase\", composed of the elements \"geri,\" meaning a spear, and possibly \"vaulx\", a valley. The name as a personal name was popular throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, because it was originally that of a Christian saint martyred by the Roman Emperor Domitian in the 3rd century AD.\n\nA secondary developed source of the name in England is from the abbey and village of Jervaulx in North Yorkshire. This is a Norman French 11th century form of the river name \"Ure\", and \"vaulx\", a valley.\n\nJohn Geruas, a landowner in Shropshire, appears in the tax rolls of King John, in the year 1202.\n\nPayne's Armorial of Jersey\n\nThe family of Gervaise has long held a highly respectable position in its native parish, where, for some generations, it possessed the Franc-fief of St Brelade.\n\nD'Hozier, in his Armorial General, Regestre II, mentions a Peter Gervaise, who was Secretary to Henry VIII of England, and who, by tradition, was supposed to have been a member of a family of that name settled at St Malo, in Brittany. It is far more probable, however, that this Peter Gervaise was a Jerseyman, and belonged to the family in this island; for among the muniments now in the possession of its descendants, is the original of a curious letter addressed by the Dean and Jurats of Jersey to Cardinal Wolsey, complaining of the mal-practices of their Bailly, Helier de Carteret.\n\nIt appears impossible to account for the preservation of this document in a quarter so remote, except on the ground that the then secretary, being a native of the island, should naturally be consulted on insular affairs, and thus obtain possession, officially, of so interesting an instrument. Nor would such an appointment be without precedent, for, if I am correctly informed, it was very usual, until the close of the last century, to attach natives of the Channel Islands to the service of the Houses of Parliament as secretaries, in consequence of their familiarity with both English and French.\n\nVariants\n\nGervaise, 1309\n\nGervese, 1331\n\nGervaese 1400\n\nGervoise 1309\n\nJervaise 1299\n\nGerasius 1274\n\nGervasy\n\nGervais (France)\n\nGervase England)\n\nGervex (France)\n\nFamily records\n\nJersey family trees\n\nDescendants of Thomas Gervaise\n\nChurch records\n\nTips for using these links\n\nGervaise baptisms in Jersey\n\nGervaise marriages in Jersey (groom)\n\nGervaise marriages in Jersey (bride)\n\nGervaise burials in Jersey\n\nFamily wills\n\nThese wills created by members of the Gervaise family are now held by Jersey Archive.

These lists replace earlier Family page baptism lists, which were not regularly updated. They have the added advantage that they produce a chronological listing for the family name in all parishes, so you do not have to search through A-Z indexes, parish by parish.\n\nWe have included some important spelling variants on some family pages, but it may be worth searching for records for a different spelling variant. Think of searching for variants with or without a prefix, such as Le or De. To search for further variants, or for any other family name, just click on the appropriate link below for the first letter of the family name, and a new tab will open, giving you the option to choose baptism, marriage or burial records. You will then see a list of available names for that type of record and you can select any name from that list. That will display all records of the chosen type for that family name, and you can narrow the search by adding a given name, selecting a parish or setting start and end dates in the form you will see above. You can also change the family name, or search for a partial name if you are not certain of the spelling\n\nThe records are displayed 30 to a page, but by selecting the yellow Wiki Table option at the top left of the page you can open a full, scrollable list. This list will either be displayed in a new tab or a pop-up window. You may have to edit the settings of your browser to allow pop-up windows for www.jerripediabmd.net. For the small number of family names for which a search generates more than 1,500 records you will have to refine your search (perhaps using start or end dates) to reduce the number of records found.\n\nNew records\n\nSince August 2020 we have added several thousand new records from the registers of Roman Catholic, Methodist and other non-conformist churches. These will appear in date order within a general search of the records and are also individually searchable within the database search form"
