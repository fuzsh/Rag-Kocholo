Recorded in august 2012. Let's also point out a bootleg: Quartet (Salzburg) 1985 - 05.19 sports the 46-minute Composition 105a, 110a, 40c, 40h, recorded in may 1985 with the leader on reeds, John Lindberg on bass, Gerry Hemingway on drums and Marilyn Crispell on piano. Still Braxton: Duo (Amherst) 2010 (Firehouse, 2014) features the reedist with his longtime collaborator Taylor Ho Bynum in their first stand-alone concert, recorded in september 2010, from which were extracted two 45-minute performances.\n\nThe 2 CD set The Complete Bura-Bura: Masahiko Togashi 30th Anniversary Concert - Now and Future (Movie Gold, 2014) restores the complete may 1986 concert (previous LP and CD editions released only four of the ten tracks) performed by drummer Masahiko Togashi, Don Cherry (pocket trumpet, piano), Steve Lacy (soprano sax), and Dave Holland (double bass). Among the recovered tracks, let's mention Cherry's Mopti and Togashi's 18-minute Spiritual Nature. Togashi, died in 2007, has been on stage since late '60s, and released many credited albums, particularly his \"solo\" Rings (november 1975), on which he played drums, percussion, vibraphone, marimba, celesta and glockenspiel.

Later, without Formanek, the lineup, with Angelica on electric piano, recorded live several gigs, collected in the two volumes of Alive In Brooklyn (september 2003). The core trio became a quintet in the following Life Between (december 2007), thanks to Marc Ducret (electric guitar) and Drew Gress (double bass). A Little House (Clean Feed, 2011) is a solo album recorded in april 2010, on which Angelica plays piano and toy piano, featuring 13 pieces, mostly theme-oriented, but also totally improvised (but no children lullabies). On the same session, Angelica recorded the six tracks of Wires And Moss, more hard bop oriented, in a quintet with Marc Ducret (guitar), Tony Malaby (tenor sax), Drew Gress (double bass) an Tom Rainey (drums). The six lenghty pieces are a mixing of jazz fusion and counterpointed hard bop. Twine Forest is instead a collaboration with trumpetist Wadada Leo Smith, eight pieces recorded in april 2013, featuring a sound more intimate (particularly the minimalistic Echolocation), even if mostly improvised. Dias De Sol, is a duet with Omar Tamez (guitar, kalimba and harmonic). The seven pieces (all quite brief but the starting 11-minute Carion Y Amenecer) feature a peaceful, lyric and bluesy sound, also still improvised. The collaboration has a follow-up in Recuerdos De Monk, recorded as the Kaheri Quartet, with Ratzo B. Harris on acoustic bass and Satoshi Takeishi on percussion. The album featuring basically group improvisations. Angelica also collaborated in several prominent projects, especially with Wadada Leo Smith (Heart's Reflections and Ten Freedom Summers).\n\nJohn Zorn keeps to produce his Book of Angels serie.

That intrigued me because sometimes what we do as improvisers is to go on instinct and intuition, making stuff that may not always be precisely explainable\". The two, obviously, play their piano and trumpet. The ten pieces were recorded in december 2013.\n\nBorn and raised in Moscow, then relocated in North Carolina, pianist and composer Yelena Eckemoff began her career working as a piano teacher and gaving solo concerts, and also spent several years digging into electronic music. Her albums, mostly released by L & H label he cofounded, mix jazz and classical, especially in trios.

The pianist, always classical oriented, and Mark Turner on his sax alternate their solos with collective improvisations.\n\nThe vinyl New York Electronic, 1965 (Sub Rosa, 2014) restores from archives the drone-based experiments by Angus MacLise; these are only electronic compositions, the follow-up of Cloud Doctrine.
