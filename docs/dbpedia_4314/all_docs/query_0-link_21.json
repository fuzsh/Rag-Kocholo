        "text": "The UVic School of Music and the Survivor-Centred Visual Narratives Project present a musical program reflecting on humankind’s ability to endure and persevere in the face of authoritarianism and adversity featuring flutist and researcher Dr. Suzanne Snizek, joined by violist Joanna Hood and pianist Dr. Alexandria Le.\n\nThe program will include music by Korean born German composer Isang Yun, Serbian American composer Nebojsa Macura, Sarajevo based composer Samir Fejzic, Hungarian Jewish composer Hermann Pál and Austrian composer Hans Gál.\n\nFree admission.\n\nLight reception to follow, celebrating the new album release of Renewed Voices.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nDr. Suzanne Snizek is currently an Associate Professor of Music at UVic where she teaches flute, chamber music and courses in musicology. Her performance-based research and academic scholarship focusses on twentieth century music that was suppressed under Nazism and/or Communism. She is an expert in Suppressed Music, and has published on the topic and performed this repertoire extensively. She was the 2017 REACH award recipient for “Excellence in Creative Expression” from the University of Victoria, where her first recording (2017) was “Chamber Music (Re)Discoveries”. Her second album is “Renewed Voices”, which was just released on April 26, 2024.\n\nJoanna Hood is an avid chamber music player both in modern and period styles. She is a founding member of the Lafayette String Quartet, formed in 1986 and based at the University of Victoria. She is the violist of the Historically informed performance groups, The Loma Mar Quartet, founded in 1997 and the DNA Quintet formed in 2008, both based in New York. Their first recording of the newly discovered chamber works of Domenico Dragonetti won the prestigious Classical Recording Foundation Award in 2009. Joanna has performed with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, Victoria Baroque Players, Early Music Vancouver, Seattle and Pacific Baroque Orchestras, Pacific Music Works, Oregon Bach Festival, and The Serenade Orchestra. Hood was a student of Isadore Tinkleman, Abraham Skernick and baroque violinist Stanley Ritchie. She plays on a viola labeled Johan Samuel Fritsche, 1805, and a viola by Edmond Aireton, 1754. Joanna has recorded for the EMI, Tzadik, Dorian, CBC, Adlar, and Vervue labels.\n\nDr. Alexandria Le is an internationally acclaimed concert pianist, teacher, and arts advocate. Her multifaceted career has brought her dynamic presence to the world’s most illustrious concert venues, like NYC’s Carnegie Hall and Paris’ Salle Cortot, to the farthest-reaching places where music is hardest to reach, like the jails of Riker’s Island and the Las Vegas Rescue Mission. She is a laureate of over 20 first-prize music awards, including the Pro Musicis International Music Award, and holds a Doctorate of Musical Arts degree in piano performance from SUNY Stony Brook. After establishing her career for over 15 years in New York and completing her fellowship with Carnegie Hall and the Juilliard School, she returned to her roots in Las Vegas to make a difference through performing, teaching, and community outreach. Dr. Le is a Yamaha Artist. More at www.alexandriale.com.\n\nThis concert will be available as a live stream."
