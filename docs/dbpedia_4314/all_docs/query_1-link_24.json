        "text": "From being a Beefheart fan Gary became Don’s manager along with his then wife, Ling. He occasionally performed on stage during the 1980/81 tours – reciting a poem (usually “One Man Sentence”, sometimes “Untitled”) or performing the solo guitar piece “Flavor Bud Living”. For the album “Ice Cream For Crow” he took up lead full-time alongside Moris Tepper while Rick Snyder moved to bass.\n\nSince the end of the Magic Band he has been very prolific in his own right, solo and within a band, releasing almost an album a year since 1991. His virtuoso solo live shows are awesome in the sounds he extracts from his guitar.\n\nFor more in depth information about his career see Gary’s website.\n\nBelow is a list of the recordings featuring his playing. Apart from these Gary has other songwriting credits with folks like Fred Schneider (B-52’s), Sissel, and most recently Warren Haynes (Gov’t. Mule, Allman Brothers); also numerous tv and film composing credits.\n\nMagic Band Albums\n\nIce Cream For Crow\n\nSolo\n\n1991 US CD Skeleton At The Feast on Enemy Records EMY 126-2\n\n1997 US CD Evangeline on Paradigm Records PME 0012-2\n\n1998 US CD Busy Being Born on Tzadik Records TZ7121\n\n1998 US CD @Paradiso on Oxygen Music Works OMWCD11\n\n2000 US CD Street of Lost Brothers on Tzadik Records TZ745\n\n2001 US CD The Edge of Heaven on Indigo Records\n\n2003 US CD Operators Are Standing By: Essential Gary Lucas 1988-1996 on Knitting Factory Records KFW316-2\n\nThe Magic Band Reunion\n\n2011 US CD Oxford UK June 6 2005 on Sundazed\n\n2005 UK CD 21st Century Mirror Men on Proper Records\n\n2003 US CD Back To The Front on All Tomorrows Parties\n\nFast ‘n’ Bulbous: The Captain Beefheart Project\n\nA seven piece tribute band put together in 2001.
