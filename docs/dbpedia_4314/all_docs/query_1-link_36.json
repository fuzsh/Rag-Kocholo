Eugenia\n3. eunoïa\n4. Many-minds in many-worlds\n5. A land of both substance &amp; shadow\n6. Succumb to gravity\n7. Crépuscule\n8. Merlin&#39;s music box (an hommage to Janacek)\n9. Motion-pictured\n10. The sunflower who does not like to turn to the sun\n11. The modern dance for the advanced in age\n12. A lullaby\n13. Oneiromancy : a dream with a view\n\nA filmic adventure where luscious string arrangements convey a whole world of emotion, and the organic sound of instruments is never outshadowed by machines.\r\n\r\n&quot;Post-Classical&quot; soundtrack FOR FANS OF Kronos Quartet – Tom Waits - Efterklang – Brian Eno - Tunng - The Books - Max Richter...\r\n\r\n&quot;Cordophone&quot; is a French word which refers to musical instruments whose sound comes from the vibrations of one or several strings.\r\nCORDOPHONY shows Philippe Petit playing with string parts by many talented friends in order to create an imaginary world of dense mixtures of electro-folk acoustic instrumentation, post-classical orchestral arrangements filled with collected field-recordings, vanguard soundscapes, manipulations of glass and vinyls.\r\nPetit&#39;s taste for risk-taking and for flights of sonic poetry has seen him working on musical motifs that can evoke at times a stormy, cinematic, or contemporary atmosphere. He has always favoured the human touch and thus no less than 20 instrumentists are participating to his most ambitious project: &quot;Cordophony&quot; \r\n\r\nPursuing a tradition he had started with his &quot;Reciprocess&quot; project, given away with The Wire magazine issue 301, Petit is benefiting from the talent of 18 of his friends-musicians, creating a mini-ensemble without whom nothing could be possible and emphasising that according to him music is a collaborative affair.\r\nEven if he creates some original music Petit would rather be introduced as a &quot;musical travel agent&quot; than a composer : \r\n&quot;I try to tell a story, with a beginning and an end, invite you to share my world for a while. I edit and cut &quot;sound-images&quot;, to process textures and their resonances into vertiginous travellings of tones ; conjuring up flashes of black &amp; white grainy timbres, behind-the-sound close-ups, addictive stop-motion harmonic effects.&quot;",
