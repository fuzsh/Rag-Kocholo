The American Accordionists Association presented a US$500.00 donation to the ATG Galla-Rini Scholarship fund, while Faithe Deffner presented a US$500.00 gift from Ernest Deffner affiliates of Titano, Pancordion and Ernest Deffner publications. Mrs. Deffner is pictured below with Mr. and Mrs. Myron Floren at the Birthday Banquet.\n\nGalla-Rini became the first inductee into the newly established International Accordion Hall of Fame which has been inaugurated by the Accordionists and Teachers Guild, International (ATG). This award recognizes his outstanding and lifelong contributions to the accordion movement, work that continues to this very day!\n\nGalla-Rini's next scheduled appearance will be at the 2003 ATG Festival in Chicago from June 25th to 29th, where he will conduct the festival orchestra as well as enjoy a performance of his Concerto No. 2 in E Minor which he wrote in 1976.

All competitions are held by the Confederation Interntionale Des Accordeonistes (C.I.A.) founded in 1935 in Paris. The CIA is a member of the International Music Council (IMC-UNESCO).\n\nThese cities of Sturovo and Esztergom were once connected by a bridge across the Danube River until 1944 when it was torn down during war times. Finally in 2001 the Maria - Valeria Bridge was rebuilt allowing Sturovo, Slovakia and Esztergom Hungary to be reunited by a quick trip across the Danube. The focus of the Coupe Mondiale will be uniting the two cities with music with some classes being held in Hungary and some across the River in Slovakia.\n\nThe World Accordion Championships in Slovakia and Hungary will be held in six categories including:\n\n1) Coupe Mondiale\n\n2) Junior Coupe Mondiale\n\n3) International Piano Accordion Competition\n\n4) Virtuoso Entertainment Music Competition\n\n5) Junior Virtuoso Entertainment Music Competition\n\n6) International Chamber Music Competition\n\nContestants wishing to qualify for any of these competitions should contact the USA members of the Confederation Internationale Des Accordeonistes (CIA) the American Accordionists Association or the Accordionists and Teachers Guild, International who will each hold qualification competitions at their national festivals this summer.\n\nFor further information, please contact the CIA.\n\nCongratulations to Anthony Falcetti, pictured right, son of Sam and Peggy Falcetti of Springfield, MA, who was one of eight new members recently elected to the NAMM Board of Directors.\n\nAnthony competed with success in both ATAM and AAA accordion competitions and has given numerous workshops on the MIDI capabilities of the accordion during his musical career. He currently manages the Falcetti Music based in Springfield, MA.\n\nOn January 17th, the official NAMM marching band kicked off the opening of NAMM 2003 with the traditional \"once around the fair grounds\" to a rousing rendition of the Beach Boy's hit song \"Round Round I Get Around\"! The doors of the event then opened for the public to view the great variety of displays. Many accordion makes and models were on display this year.\n\nThis year's premier event was the all-star concert with Sir Elton John featured in a concert entitled \"Elton & Friends Rock for Music Education\". Other artists included Bruce Hornsby (accordionist - pictured right), Vanessa Carlton, Ray Charles, Nikka Costa, Amy Grant, Jewel, Norah Jones, Diana Krall, John Mayer, Michael McDonald, Brian McKnight, Take 6, Rufus Wainwright and Brian Wilson (of the Beach Boys). Emmy award winner Eric McCormack, from NBC's \"Will & Grace\" hosted the concert honoring Sir Elton John. An award was presented by Yamaha to Sir Elton entitled the \"2003 Lifetime Achievement in Musical Excellence Award\". Proceeds from the concert will go toward AMC and NAMM's other music education charities: the International Foundation for Music Research and Museum of Making Music.\n\nIn a year filled with challenges, more people around the world turned to music and music making, said Joe Lamond, president and CEO, NAMM. Research has shown that making music can help a child reach their full potential in school, help older adults achieve significant health benefits and provide meaningful fun and recreation at all ages. They say you can tell the relative health of an industry by the strength of its trade shows, Lamond continued. By that measure, the future of music making is bright indeed!\n\nThe International Music Products Association, commonly called NAMM in reference to the organizations popular NAMM trade shows, is the not-for-profit association that unifies, leads and strengthens the $16 billion global musical instruments and products industry. NAMMs activities and programs are designed to promote music making to people of all ages. NAMM is comprised of approximately 8,000 Member companies. For more information about NAMM, interested parties can visit www.namm.com or call 800-767-NAMM (6266).\n\nNAMM holds two shows per year, and the upcoming shows are as follows:\n\nSummer Session - July 18-20, 2003 - Nashville, TN, USA\n\nAnnual Winter Show: January 15-18, 2004, Anaheim, CA, USA\n\nNinety-one Salt Lake City, Utah accordion enthusiasts met Tuesday evening, January 14, 2003, and amid animated shouts at the meeting's end duly formed the Salt Lake Area Accordion Club and made the front page to boot! (pictured left are Husband-and-wife team Gary and Mindy Garff of West Jordan performing a duet during the inaugural meeting of the Salt Lake Accordion Club.)\n\nA Deseret News reporter and photographer from one of the cities' two daily newspapers were on hand to record the happy event and make big-time news. Both city newspapers, the Deseret News and the Salt Lake City Tribune, had run a major feature announcing the potential of an area accordion club.\n\nThe inaugural meeting was a gala occasion focusing in part on the somewhat unknown-even-to-themselves rich accordion heritage of the city. Introduced were former and present accordion studio owners, teachers, distributors, and three former accordion champions living in the area. The club is headed by Jay M. Todd, founder-president, with co-founders Janet Todd and Paul Pasquali, and tentatively set its meeting schedule for the third Tuesday of each month.\n\nThose in attendance voiced optimism about the club's future, many already making plans to inform numerous former accordion associates not in attendance of the club's formation. Pictured right is Ralph Hubrich of Sandy, UT. Ralph used to walk several miles to his weekly lesson with his accordion strapped to his back, played a virtuoso version of the delicate, fast-moving \"Hungarian Czardas.\"\n\nLet the word for forth! The accordion is alive and well in Salt Lake City!\n\nThe next meeting of the Salt Lake Accordion Club will be on Tuesday, Feb. 18, at 7 PM at the South Valley Unitarian Church, 6876 S. Highland Drive. For more information please contact: Jay or Janet Todd: 801-272-3263 e-mail: jaja64@msn.com or www.slaac.com\n\nAcclaimed musician Frank Marocco has been keeping a busy concert schedule and is about to release a new CD Recording.\n\nFrank was recently flown to Japan on two occasions, once for a concert and the second time for a TV show, to work with Japanese Superstar Singer, Yuki Koyanagi. Having recorded with her while in Los Angeles, when she did the concert and TV show in Tokyo, she sent for Frank to come to Japan to accompany her again.\n\nWhile in Japan, Frank also did a concert with top Japanese accordionist Coba Kobayashi (pictured below.) Probably the most well-known accordionist in Japan, this gave a rare opportunity to combine the talents of two world famous artists on one concert. Featuring eleven accordionists performing all different styles of music and two bandoneon players.\n\nDuring a recent appearance in Los Angeles, Los Angeles Times reporter Don Heckman wrote: \"Marocco, a veteran of hundreds of recording dates, made a convincing case for the instrument's capacity to effectively deliver all the core elements of first-class jazz\"...\n\nBy the time the set was concluded, thoughts of polkas and squeezeboxes had long disappeared, as Marocco's fascinating performance thoroughly affirmed the fact that it's not the instrument that makes the music, it's the imagination and creativity of the person who is playing it.\"\n\nBorn and raised in a suburb of Chicago, Frank began the accordion at age seven, when his parents enrolled him in a six-week trial program on the accordion.\n\nFrank studied with George Stefani for nine years, a man who provided him with much inspiration. Studying classics, his teacher encouraged him to explore other areas. As a youngster Frank played piano and clarinet, he studied music theory, harmony, conducting and he was a member of his high school band.\n\nEventually settling in Los Angeles with his wife Anne, Frank found the proximity to Hollywood provided opportunities never available in the Midwest. He began a career which includes traveling with Bob Hope visiting the servicemen in many countries; being featured on the Les Brown Band, including six Love Boat cruises. He has also been very active doing studio work: movie soundtracks, TV movies, TV series , records and advertising jingles. Frank has also composed and arranged many accordion works in jazz and classical music.\n\nFrank will be appearing in Plano, Texas as part of the Texas Accordion Association Annual Convention from March 7-9, 2003 and also at the Accordionists and Teachers Guild, International Convention in Chicago, from June 25-29, 2003 where he will perform, conduct workshops and direct the ATG Festival Jazz Orchestra.\n\nThe Alcoa Singers, composed of 30 employees, contractors, and retirees of multinational Alcoa Inc. headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have recently completed their 41st concert series which was directed by conductor and accordionist Henry Doktorski. The Singers performed ten concerts at various venues throughout the city of Pittsburgh during their 2002 Christmas season, including concerts at Allegheny General Hospital, Magee Womens' Hospital, First Lutheran Church, Carnegie Library, USX Steel Tower and other locations.\n\nTheir repertoire, with accompaniment expertly provided by Eric Dzugan, a Duquesne University alumni with a Masters Degree in piano performance, consisted of a dozen anthems consisting of sacred and secular Christmas music, ranging from the 1599 Renaissance classic \"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming\" to the 1990 contemporary carol \"Grown Up Christmas List,\" as well as a medley of traditional Chanukah songs.\n\nMarlene Galluze, Alcoa Singers Co-chair, said, \"The medley of Chanukah songs was especially memorable for us and very popular with our audiences, not only because the songs were from the authentic Jewish holiday repertoire but also because our illustrious director accompanied us on his 12-bass accordion. The melodious strains of the accordion highlighted the folk origins of these simple and beautiful songs and inspired us to sing them in a similarly poetic fashion. We enjoyed watching the children in the audiences who were mesmerized by the opening and closing of the bellows, since many of them may have never before experienced live accordion music. I hope he includes his accordion accompaniment in our 2003 season also.\"\n\nThis photograph (above) of the Alcoa Singers was taken immediately after their Carnegie Library concert.\n\nThe Alcoa Singers performed at:\n\nAllegheny General Hospital Auxiliary, Magee Womens Hospital, First Lutheran Church, USX Tower, Alcoa Corporate Center Holiday Celebration, Alcoa Corporate Center P.H.

David Nadel founded Ashkenaz in March 1973 as a home for Balkan music and dance. For this reason we have set aside this special day to honor the Bay Area's Balkan Music and Dance community and\n\nit's pivotal roll in the history of Ashkenaz.\n\nWe would like to invite all performers of Balkan music to participate. This is an open and inclusive event intended to showcase the depth and range of Bay Area Balkan music. We know how rich this experience can be and we are hoping to share this experience with a larger public as well as gather and acknowledge our community. Everyone please join us for this special night.\n\nThe number of people who respond to this invitation dictates how much performance time each group will be given. For example, if six groups respond, each group may be given 45 minutes. If 30 groups respond... well, time will be short, and we'll just have to figure that one out, possibly using the dance studio in the back of the club.\n\nBecause this is a fundraiser for Ashkenaz, we are asking performers to donate their time. However you will have great exposure! The deadline for signing up is March 1, 2003.\n\nFor further information contact us at: lisegeorge@earthlink.net or call Lise Liepman or George Chittenden at 510 525-4342"
