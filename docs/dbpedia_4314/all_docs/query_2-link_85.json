        "text": "Masada 30th Anniversary Edition: The Complete Studio Master Takes\n\nTaken from the press release: \"The premier ensemble of Radical Jewish Culture,\n\nMasada is one of Zorn's most popular, personal, long-lasting, and powerful projects. Here you find the mother lode-the long-awaited Tzadik release of the original quartet's first studio recordings.\"\n\nI, for one, am pretty excited to finally be able to get them all in one place. There is some bonus content too, which I gather will be the demos that John Zorn released as a one-time release edition on vinyl a few years ago, Sanhedrin (1994-1997 Unreleased Studio Recordings).\n\nI had Alef & Beit.\n\nIn the 90s I didn't really get into Masada and was never a \"jazz-guy\". And then somehow I never got the rest of the Masada recordings.\n\nFor a kid those imports were also quite expensive you had to choose wisely.\n\nI saw OG Masada last year (along with New Masada) and I was blown away by the chaotic beauty. Went to Discogs and tinkered with the idea to buy them all … but ... that was not feasible.\n\nAnd then this came along.\n\nBought it, love it. It's a Box-Set done right. Great quality without eating too much space.\n\nStartet with Yod and will – day by day – make my way to Alef.\n\nThis music really is timeless.\n\nDoesn't look like the bonus tracks on disc 4 have been released previously ie on the Sanhedrin double CD or LP\n\nI ordered (before Christmas) my copy from DMG (Downtown Music Gallery, NYC) - came yesterday. Apparently they are the only people selling it according to the Tzadik site but I've seen them for sale on the Spanish Jazz Messengers site.\n\nExpensive but quality set (up there with Mosaics) - managed to partially fund it by selling 5 original DIW discs to a friend\n\nYes, DMG is the only place to get it now. Unfortunately, Limited Run (who had been distirbuting this and the other limited Tzadik releases) went bankrupt, and apparenlty Tzadik is out $70,000. Word is that many who ordered through SEcond City also never received their box. This is the second time Tzadik has been burned by a distributor--they were part of the Pledge Music disaster in 2019. There's a series of benefit concerts this month & also a donation link if any of you are interested:\n\nImprov Nights 2024: A Tribute to Derek Bailey (night 1)\n\nApril 5th release !\n\nA SPECIAL VINYL RELEASE TO BENEFIT TZADIK RECORDS—\n\nAll funds from the sale of this LP will go to benefit the Tzadik label.\n\nSCP, the online distributor for our direct-to-consumer mail order projects has shut down owing Tzadik $70,000. To help rebalance this loss we are releasing this special vinyl version of six selections from New Masada Quartet Volume One.\n\nNew Masada Quartet is one of the best groups Zorn has ever had. Bristling hot guitar master Julian Lage, bass wizard Jorge Roeder and 30-year Zorn veteran Kenny Wollesen perform with a crackling live energy that brings the Masada music to life like never before! Led by Zorn’s versatile sax and stop-and-start conducting, the music is filled with burning solos, telepathic group interaction, heartfelt lyricism and hypnotic grooves. Please purchase this limited edition LP and help Tzadik continue its mission to support and document new music in the 21st century.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Sarah Robertson, Marisa Rolish, Scott Hull, Heung-Heung Chin, Bruce Gallanter, Stephen Svacina, Glenn Dicker, and Redeye for donating their time and services to help Tzadik with this special benefit vinyl release."
