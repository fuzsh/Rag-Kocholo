        "text": "Jon Raskin has been a member of Rova Saxophone Quartet for the last 42 years exploring the relationship of improvisation and composition, developing and honing the language of ensemble music and researching linguistic possibilities of the saxophone. He has performed and/ or recorded with Anthony Braxton, Fred Frith, Sam Rivers, Tim Berne, Phillip Johnston, Leo Smith, Frank Gratkowsi, Phillip Greenlief and Henry Kaiser Continue to biography »\n\nRova\n\nRova Saxophone Quartet explores the synthesis of composition and collective improvisation, creating exciting, genre-bending music that challenges and inspires.\n\nRova is one of the longest-standing groups in the music movement that has its roots in post-bop, free jazz, avant-rock, and 20th century new music, and draws inspiration from the visual arts and from the traditional and popular music styles of Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States.\n\nJon Raskin Quartet\n\nThe quartet was created to explore the my graphic scores and develop group improvisation sound. It has had a rotating caste of members: Liz Allbee—trumpet/electronics, George Cremaschi—bass / electronics, Jon Raskin—alto / bari / electronicx, Gino Robair—drums/electronics/piano, John Shiurba— electric guitar and Ches Smith—drums. There are two recordings that have been released of our work: The Jon Raskin Quartet on Rastascan Records and Open Box on Tzadik that is a collaboration with the poet Carla Harryman.\n\nThe Long Table\n\nThis started as a form to compose in for a group with two saxophones, electric bass and guitar and drums. The form follows how a meal unfolds at a long table with many friends. A surprise to start, something familiar reimaged, something new, side conversations, interruptions, toasts, quiet moments and so forth. The members are Phillip Greenlief—alto sax, John Hanes—drums, Jon Raskin—baritone sax, Dan Seamans—electric bass, John Shiurba—electric guitar."
