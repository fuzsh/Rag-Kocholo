He was a guest of the Artists-in-Berlin Program of the DAAD for 2012.\n\nwww.adachitomomi.com\n\nSusan Alcorn is a Baltimore, Maryland-based composer and musician who has received international recognition as an innovator of the pedal steel guitar, an instrument whose sound is commonly associated with country and western music. Alcorn has absorbed the technique of C&W pedal steel playing and refined it to a virtuosic level. Her original music reveals the influence of free jazz, avant-garde classical music, Indian ragas, Indigenous traditions, and other musics of the world. The UK Guardian describes her music as \"beautiful, glassy and liquid, however far she strays from pulse and conventional harmony.\"\n\nIn addition to frequent tours throughout North America and Europe, Susan has performed in the UK at the London Festival of Experimental Music, the On The Outside Festival in Newcastle, and the Glasgow Improvisors Orchestra Improvisation Festival; in France at the Musique Action Festival in Vandoeuvre-lÃ¨s-Nancy, Ateliers Tampon and Instants Chavires in Paris; in Germany at the Leipzig JazzTage and with the ICI Ensemble in Munich; The Stone, CBGBs, and Issue Project Room in New York; Il Continiere in Rome; and at Arsenic and Cave 12 in Switzerland.\n\nThough mostly a solo performer, she has collaborated with numerous artists including Pauline Oliveros, Eugene Chadbourne., the late Peter Kowald, Chris Cutler, Fred Frith, Maggie Nicols, Joe Giardullo, Joe McPhee, Mike Cooper, LÃª Quan Ninh, Ellen Fullman, Evan Parker, Ellery Eskelin, Michael Formanek, and John Butcher.\n\nAndrew Bernstein is an American musician and composer. He is possessed by a minimalist drive to endlessly explore the subtleties of timbre, simple rhythmic variation, and the sense of timelessness in listening to long sustained tones. Andrew plays music to quiet the mind and open it up to higher states of consciousness.\n\nSonically his work is diverse, ranging from quiet solo alto saxophone improvisations and electronic drones to loud, rhythmically complex and hypnotically repetitive ensemble pieces. He often works with microtonal scales, dabbles in acoustic instrument construction, and programs custom synthesizers.\n\nBernstein is a member of the High Zero/Red Room Collective, plays with minimalist rock band Horse Lords, and is an M.A. candidate in Goucher College's Digital Arts program. He lives in Baltimore with his incredibly attractive wife and 3 unnaturally large cats.\n\nPeter B is webmaster of ciat-lonbarde.net, where he develops analog synthesizer products, such as \"Sidrazzi Organ\", \"Tetrax Organ\", \"Plumbutter\", and \"Cocoquantus\". Â Other activities at ciat-lonbarde.net include paper circuits, free synthesizer designs for various noise/chaotic touch sensitive interfaces. Â Peter B has conducted workshops in Berlin, Providence, Vancouver, California, Montreal, DC, and Manchester. Â During a typical workshop, synthesizers are built, either from paper or kitted form. Â If the synthesizer is installation oriented, such as the \"Deerhorn\", participants and Peter B then realize it vis a vis the architectural space of the workshop. Â If the synthesizer is performance oriented, such as \"Mr. Grassi\" or \"Sidrazzi Organ\", then there is an ensemble to end the workshop. Â However, most of Peter B's life form is spent soldering. Â He is also webmaster of shbobo.net, which produces the new \"Shnth\", a \"squish synthesizer\" that uses computer music to emulate the processes of the analog synthesizers.\n\nciat-lonbarde.net\n\nBased in Baltimore, Maryland, Christina Blomberg has performed with groups ranging from The Barrage Band Orchestra to the Out of Your Head Collective. She improvises regularly with the Red Room Collective, most recently during Artscape at High Zeroâs Worlds in Collusion. She started playing experimental music at the Lawrence University Conservatory in Wisconsin. There she studied music under Tom Washatka while majoring in Psychology. From Fall 2010 through Spring 2011, Blomberg taught in Turkey on a Fulbright grant, also participating in folk music culture, and studying Turkish popular and traditional music.\n\nBlomberg creates memory-evoking musical environments, calling on music traditions from swing jazz to Makam from Turkey. She enjoys exploring the music that unfolds when intention intersects with coincidence.\n\nDecryption Key:A->T:E->F:I->J:O->B:U->Y:M->N:P->L:R->Z:S->C:T->Q:remaining roman characters not encoded.\n\nQbn Bbztn jc t nycjcjtn tnd vjdfb tzqjcq fzbn Btlqjnbzf, Ntzyltnd.

It's not necessary. You'll have to figure out how to merge motivation and self-love, or else be pointlessly miserable and self-deceiving.\n\n(This analysis probably only scratches the surface, of course, but I hope this puts you off to a good start.)\n\nYou're perfect. You've done amazing, beautiful things, and you still can and will do amazing, beautiful things.\n\nphoto credit: Milo Beach Creature\n\nBonnie Jones is a Korean-American writer, improvising musician, and performer working primarily with electronic music and text. Born in 1977 in South Korea she was raised in New Jersey on a dairy farm, and currently resides in Baltimore, MD. Bonnie creates improvised and composed text-sound performances that explore the fluidity and function of electronic noise (field recordings, circuit bending) and text (poetry, found, spoken, visual). She is interested in how people perceive, âreadâ and interact with these sounds and texts given our current technological moment. Bonnie has received commissions from the London ICA and has presented her work in the US, Europe, and Asia and collaborates frequently with writers and musicians including Ric Royer, Carla Harryman, Andy Hayleck, Joe Foster, Andrea Neumann, Liz Tonne, and Chris Cogburn.

Heâs worked a variety of day jobs, the most exciting of which involved burying fabricated fossils in a Kansas desert, as well as moving a baby mummy from one high school in suburban Chicago to another high school in suburban Chicago. Mummies smell a bit like honey, which makes sense.\n\nphoto credit: Phil Kaufmann\n\nKelvin Pittman plays saxophone dealing with space, exigencies of space, and select sets of textures.\n\nHe began playing acoutic guitar as a dare at a California high school. Acoustic became electric, electric became clarinet, and then saxophone. Pittman also plays contact mic'ed bicycle, computer generated sine waves, and various objects. Beginning with \"free jazz,\" he moved on to much, much quieter and restrained music, partially due to the influence of playing companions, partially due to desire.\n\nHe's performed in Phoenix, across the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, Vancouver, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, New York City, and Baltimore.

He is currently pursuing a BFA in sculpture from MICA. Willâs work in improvisation stems from his interest in electricity, synthesis, people, the mind, listening, dials, switches, and waveforms.\n\nwww.willschorre.com/\n\nDrummer/percussionist Karen Stackpole began her career as a rock drummer in the late â80s and soon became fascinated with improvised music and multi-media collaboration. She joined forces with SF Bay Area musicians, playing new music and stretching beyond established boundaries as well as working with dancers and experimental film. In 1991 she was exposed to the wonder of gongs (Paiste in particular) and immediately altered her trajectory to include these incredibly versatile instruments into her musical vocabulary.\n\nIn her explorations of metals, she has cultivated some distinctive techniques for drawing harmonics out of tam tams with various implements: rubber mallets, felt and yarn mallets, ball chains, bass and cello bows, kitchen utensils, and other small objects. Karen specializes in dynamic soundscapes and textures, but has also contributed gong sounds to more conventional musical genres as well as contributing source material for film soundtracks.\n\nShe is active in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles creative music scenes and has participated in music festivals and performed solo in Seattle, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, and the Bay Area as well as collaborating with other gongists from the UK, Poland, and the US. Over the years she has played with Gino Robair, John Schott, Vinny Golia, Myles Boisen, Moe Staiano, Chris Heenan, Rod Poole, Steve Roden, Dean Santomieri, Le Quan Ninh, The Bay Area Chamber Symphony, Mark Growden, Malcolm Mooney, and others.

Since moving to Hamburg in 1982 she has been involved in free improvisation and experimental music. Since then she has developed an individual musical language. She works mainly on extending the sounding possiblities of the trumpet and has developed her own extended techniques and preparations for producing these sounds.\n\nBesides this material research she is especially interested in the relation between sound and silence. She performs solo, with her working ensembles, dancers, visual artists and one-time collaborations with musicians from around the world. Collaborations with Ute Wassermann, Gino Robair, Leonel Kaplan, Christoph Schiller, Heddy Boubaker, Gregory BÃ¼ttner and Forbes Graham, amongst others.

Discovering and producing the unheard, the intimate, in relation to sound production within the flute, is her main focus of exploration. She takes the sounds from the inside of her flute - the microcosm of her flute world â and transports these sounds, with the help of amplification, into a sound-able-hear-able world. Bringing what is inside into the outside. She then combines this world of sound with self-made field recordings- the natural macrocosm of existing sound, forming a composed mixture between the macro and microcosmic. She then uses this as the material for a composition. Recently, with the support of STEIM in Amsterdam, she developed foot- and sensor controllers for her electronic set-up, which aid in this process and enrich the experience.\n\nHer current projects are: ORNIS; an audio-visual Duo with british artist Kathy Hinde, a Duo for flute and church organ with australian pianist/organist Chris Abrahams, a Duo with canadian musician Jamie Drouin, Landscape quartet, an enviromental, soundart project with Bennett Hogg, Matt Sansom, Stefan ÃsterjÃ¶. She is a memeber of the SPLITTER ORCHESTER, a 24 piece improvising orchestra, based in Berlin. She has played and worked a.o. with Anthony Braxton, Arto Lindsay, Tony Buck, Jim Denley, Chris Abrahams, Alex Nowitz, Andrea Neumann, Schwimmer, the Walter Thompson Soundpainting Orchestra.\n\nSabine Vogelâs grants and residencies include: 2007, artist-in residence at EMS in Stockholm and STEIM in Amsterdam; 2008 and 2012, a working grant for music by the Senat fÃ¼r Wissenschaft, Kultur und Forschung, Land Brandenburg; 2008, artistic residency at STEIM; 2010, 2-months working grant of the Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern at KÃ¼nstlerhaus LUKAS in Ahrenshoop; 2012, guest composer at EMS, Stockholm; 2012-2014, British AHRC research grant for the project âLandscape Quartetâ in the UK (project director: Benett Hogg).
