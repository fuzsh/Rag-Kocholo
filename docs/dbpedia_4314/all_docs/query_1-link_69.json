        "text": "AIMS Marketing Program/ Featured Titles Promoted This Week:\n\nDanny Brown – Quaranta CD/LP+MP3 (Warp)\n\nAs the intro notes, Quaranta is Italian for “forty.” According to Brown, Quaranta is the spiritual sequel to XXX, his breakout album released on Fool’s Gold in 2011, that infamously cataloged a life lived on the edge at 30. The whirlwind of parties, tours, collaborations, and achievements that followed that landmark release seemed to fly by fast–ten years later, when COVID-19 brought the world to a halt, Brown found himself in downtown Detroit, living alone for the first time ever. After years of escapist escapades, he was forced to adjust to the stillness and silence, and the bars on Quaranta are diaristic in a distinctly Danny Brown way. There’s no shortage of Brown’s typical blitzing verses over angular, mesmerizing production from some of his oldest collaborators including Quelle Chris, Paul White & SKYWLKR, but the Alchemist produced “Tantor” is just the kind of cold-steel contradistinction which he’s been celebrated throughout his career. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nNeil Diamond – The Thank You Australia Concert: Live 1976 DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nThis concert from the Sydney Sports Stadium was the culmination of Neil Diamond’s Australia & New Zealand tour in 1976, an event which marked his comeback to the live stage after a creatively fruitful four-year sabbatical from live performance. The vast crowd was typical of this record-breaking tour, still one of the most memorable in Australian history, and Neil Diamond delivered the enthralling performance of a true showman. Includes a restored version of “Morningside”, a track that was partly cut due to a commercial break in the original live broadcast, a 50-minute interview with Neil Diamond filmed during the Australian tour, and more.\n\nGreen Day – Saviors CD/LP/Cassette (Reprise)\n\nGreen Day is not your savior. But the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll might be. And as the greatest punk band alive, they’re the loudest vessel we have… to give it a shot. Green Day is ready to flip off the famous, stupid, and contagious, by putting a mirror to the present tense like only they can, with Saviors, their inspired new studio album. Amazingly, Saviors is Green Day’s 14th studio album, yet somehow this enduring power trio, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tré Cool & Mike Dirnt, remain devoted to their defiant craft that has fueled their career-long destruction of every boundary bestowed on the genre, and landed 3 East Bay punks in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame. [Several indie store exclusive editions are available: pink w/ black color vinyl; and autographed CD. A deluxe 180gm vinyl pressing is also available.]\n\nMary Halvorson – Cloudward CD/LP (Nonesuch)\n\nCloudward is the new release by Brooklyn-based guitarist, composer, and MacArthur fellow Mary Halvorson. The album features eight new compositions by Halvorson, performed with her sextet Amaryllis; the improvisatory band that performed on her critically praised 2022 albums Amaryllis and Belladonna comprises Halvorson, Patricia Brennan (vibraphone), Nick Dunston (bass), Tomas Fujiwara (drums), Jacob Garchik (trombone), and Adam O’Farrill (trumpet). Labelmate Laurie Anderson also is featured on the album track “Incarnadine.” The dual 2022 releases’ acclaim included being named Jazz Album of the Year in DownBeat’s annual Critics Poll.\n\nLizzie No – Halfsies CD/LP (Thirty Tigers)\n\nHalfsies is the third album from Brooklyn, NY singer songwriter, guitarist and harpist Lizzie No. Genre is a construct. To categorize artists might make it easier to organize record stores and playlists but there’s no one term that could define any artist, least of all one like Lizzie No. You could say that Lizzie No makes Americana music, in that her work pulls from the rhythms and traditions of blues, folk, and country – not unlike the artists to whom she’s most often compared: Allison Russell, Rhiannon Giddens and Adia Victoria – but her collaborations with Brian Dunne, Pom Pom Squad and Domino Kirkie display an undeniable indie influence that allows her to move frequently and seamlessly between overlapping musical circles. The erasure of Black artists is central to the myth of country music – what it means, what it stands for, where it comes from – and so simply by standing on stage and singing, whether it be in theaters across the country with the Black Opry, or leading Queer Line Dancing nights with the Lavender Country tour, Lizzie No is staging a kind of protest. [A limited-edition purple color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSleater-Kinney – Little Rope CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\nSleater-Kinney returns with Little Rope, one of the finest, most delicately layered records in the band’s 30-year career. On the surface, Little Rope‘s ten songs veer from spare to anthemic, catchy to deliberately hard turning. But beneath that are perhaps the most complex and subtle arrangements of any Sleater-Kinney record, and a lyrical and emotional compass pointed firmly in the direction of something both liberating and terrifying: the sense that only way to gain control is to let it go. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBrittney Spencer – My Stupid Life CD/LP (Elektra)\n\n“Nashville’s new star” (CBS This Morning) Brittney Spencer releases her highly anticipated debut album, My Stupid Life. The first track, “Bigger Than The Song”, showcases Spencer’s ability to excel on the fringe of genre periphery with her honest and free-spirited songwriting. The album’s 13 tracks are a culmination of her experience during her time trying to “make it” in Music City, discovering herself in the process. The Baltimore native moved to Nashville ten years ago, and this album is Spencer’s commitment to be unapologetically herself.\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nWarren Haynes – Man In Motion [Reissue/2011] 2xLP (Stax)\n\nTranslucent 180gm translucent ruby red colorway. Warren Haynes has been almost ubiquitous since he joined the Allman Brothers Band. Making his Stax Records debut, Man In Motion is Haynes’ first conscious effort to fully indulge his love for this music, and his first solo record with backing musicians since 1993. Originally released in 2011, the album was co-produced with Gordie Johnson and boasts a stellar cast: George Porter, Jr. (bass,) Ivan Neville (organ, clavinet, backing vocals,) Ian McLagan (Wurlitzer, piano,) Raymond Weber (drums,) Ron Holloway (tenor saxophone,) and Ruthie Foster (backing vocals.)\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nBlack Grape – Orange Head CD/LP/2xLP (Dgaff)\n\nBlack Grape could only have been made in Manchester. The swagger, fun and cryptic humor seem hewn from a city historian AJP Taylor once described as offering an archetypally different way of English urban life to London. Both Shaun Ryder and Paul Leveridge, known as Kermit, came from edgy-but-cool parts of the city. In Shaun’s case Salford, with Kermit originating from Moss Side. Black Grape always was a grimily cosmic musical jigsaw, melding rock, hip-hop, acid house, psychedelic pop and reggae with Ryder’s gutter poetry, delivered in his inimitable shyster’s bark. [A deluxe expanded orange 2xLP version is available.]\n\nBloodgood – Out Of The Darkness [Reissue/1989] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nThere are some bands that specialize in melodic metal anthems – those songs that make you want to stand up, raise your hands in the air, sing at the top of your lungs, and jump around the room playing your finest air guitar. Bloodgood is one of them.\n\nBlue & Nottz – Afrika CD/LP (Nature Sounds)\n\nAn independent hip-hop fixture for more than 15 years, famed Los Angeles emcee Blu has mastered the lost art of the album, imbuing each new project with unique themes, and often recruiting a single producer to craft a cohesive sonic experience. Now, Blu and Nottz are reuniting for the new album Afrika, a celebration of the rich history and culture of their ancestral homeland. With Swahili song titles and thunderous beats from Nottz, the collection finds Blu proudly embracing his roots, connecting black struggles in the US to those of African peoples worldwide.\n\nBride – Show No Mercy [Reissue/1986] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nBride – Live To Die [Reissue/1988] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nBride – Silence Is Madness [Reissue/1989] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nThe first three Bride albums define the hard rock and metal styles of the big ‘80s era. All three albums are absolute Christian metal classics. [Limited-edition color vinyl pressings are available.]\n\nDanny Brown – Quaranta CD/LP+MP3 (Warp)\n\nAs the intro notes, Quaranta is Italian for “forty.” According to Brown, Quaranta is the spiritual sequel to XXX, his breakout album released on Fool’s Gold in 2011, that infamously cataloged a life lived on the edge at 30. The whirlwind of parties, tours, collaborations, and achievements that followed that landmark release seemed to fly by fast–ten years later, when COVID-19 brought the world to a halt, Brown found himself in downtown Detroit, living alone for the first time ever. After years of escapist escapades, he was forced to adjust to the stillness and silence, and the bars on Quaranta are diaristic in a distinctly Danny Brown way. There’s no shortage of Brown’s typical blitzing verses over angular, mesmerizing production from some of his oldest collaborators including Quelle Chris, Paul White & SKYWLKR, but the Alchemist produced “Tantor” is just the kind of cold-steel contradistinction which he’s been celebrated throughout his career. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBrown Horse – Reservoir CD/LP (Loose Music)\n\nThe songs of Reservoir are rooted in a country-rock tradition. While the band acknowledges an indebtedness to the turn-of-the-millennium alt-country sounds of Uncle Tupelo, Silver Jews, Lucinda Williams, and Jason Molina, the songs on the album also resonate with the preceding Last Waltz‘s generation of ‘70s folk-rock artists, as well as more recent works.\n\nBTS – Dark & Wild [Reissue/2014] CD (Bighit Music/Hybe)\n\nBTS – Skool Luv Affair [Reissue/2014] CD (Bighit Music/Hybe)\n\nCD reissues of the debut studio album and second mini album from the seven-piece Korean boy band.\n\nCarter The Unstoppable Sex Machine – 1992: The Love Album [Reissue/1992] CD/LP (Chysalis)\n\nFormed in 1987 by Les “Fruitbat” Carter and Jim “Jim Bob” Morrison, Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine burst onto the scene with their signature style of punk-pop infused with samples, drum machines, and social commentary. 1992: The Love Album was Carter USM’s debut release on Chrysalis Records and reached the No. 1 spot album on the UK Album Chart in May 1992, propelling the band to pop stardom. [A limited-edition blue w/ yellow colorway is available.]\n\nCobrakill – Serpent’s Kiss CD (Frontiers)\n\nPlayful and riveting, Cobrakill blends metal, rock, sleaze and glam and in doing so make music that not only reminds the listener of the glory days of ‘80s hair metal but also reminds them that rock and roll is still alive and kicking today.\n\nThe Corrs – Best Of The Corrs CD/2xLP (Rhino)\n\nOriginally released in 2001, Best Of The Corrs is the double platinum hits collection covering the incredible Corrs first three hugely successful studio albums Forgiven Not Forgotten, Talk On Corners and In Blue. This newly reissued collection now features three new songs recorded in tribute to Fleetwood Mac’s Christine McVie.\n\nDire Straits – Live 1978-1992 8xCD/12xLP (Rhino)\n\nDire Straits Live 1978-1992 features remastered, extended, and unreleased recordings from some of their most coveted live albums and performances. The collection includes Live At The Rainbow, Alchemy, On The Night, Encores, Live At The BBC, plus artwork prints and an exclusive 16-page booklet.\n\nElzhi & Oh No – Heavy Vibrato CD/LP (Nature Sounds)\n\nKnown for weaving together complex rhymes with style, Elzhi has been rapping circles around the competition for more than two decades. After years as a member of iconic group Slum Village, Elzhi’s impressive solo career has included projects produced by acclaimed artists like Black Milk, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Khrysis, and Will Sessions. Now, the Detroit emcee is linking with California beat maestro Oh No for the new collaborative album Heavy Vibrato. A multitalented underground hip-hop luminary, Oh No has built a formidable resume behind the boards, crafting tracks for Mos Def, Freddie Gibbs, MF DOOM, Action Bronson, Talib Kweli, Ab-Soul, Danny Brown, and more. Heavy Vibrato is a thrilling showcase for Elzhi’s lyrical wizardry and cinematic storytelling, as Oh No breathes new life into a compelling tapestry of jazz samples, producing the entire collection.\n\nFinal Axe – Beyond Hell’s Gate [Reissue/1989] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nFinal Axe – Axe Of The Apostles [Reissue/1990] CD/LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nBeyond Hell’s Gate specializes in profound hooks, speedy riffing, shredding guitars and a full-on heavy metal assault. Written and partially recorded in 1990, some might say that with The Axe Of The Apostles, Final Axe captured heavyweight status by showcasing their catchiest, most accessible set of tunes yet.\n\nGotus – Gotus CD (Frontiers)\n\nFormed in 2019, Gotus initially emerged as a live project conceived by guitarist Mandy Meyer and drummer Pat Aeby. The band, boasting current and former and actual members of Swiss rock giants Krokus, Gotthard and Storace, regrouped in 2022 after a pandemic-induced hiatus from live performances. The lineup solidified with the addition of Ronnie Romero as frontman, bassist Tony Castell (ex-Krokus, Crystal Ball), and keyboardist Alain Guy, creating a dynamic and powerful quintet. The album, Gotus, is a testament to the band’s evolution and musical prowess.\n\nGrand– Second To None CD (Frontiers)\n\nGrand, hailing from Sweden, carries on the tradition of exceptional AOR bands.\n\nGreen Day – Saviors CD/LP/Cassette (Reprise)\n\nGreen Day is not your savior. But the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll might be. And as the greatest punk band alive, they’re the loudest vessel we have… to give it a shot. Green Day is ready to flip off the famous, stupid, and contagious, by putting a mirror to the present tense like only they can, with Saviors, their inspired new studio album. Amazingly, Saviors is Green Day’s 14th studio album, yet somehow this enduring power trio, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tré Cool & Mike Dirnt, remain devoted to their defiant craft that has fueled their career-long destruction of every boundary bestowed on the genre, and landed 3 East Bay punks in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame. [Several indie store exclusive editions are available: pink w/ black color vinyl; and autographed CD. A deluxe 180gm vinyl pressing is also available.]\n\nMary Halvorson – Cloudward CD/LP (Nonesuch)\n\nCloudward is the new release by Brooklyn-based guitarist, composer, and MacArthur fellow Mary Halvorson. The album features eight new compositions by Halvorson, performed with her sextet Amaryllis; the improvisatory band that performed on her critically praised 2022 albums Amaryllis and Belladonna comprises Halvorson, Patricia Brennan (vibraphone), Nick Dunston (bass), Tomas Fujiwara (drums), Jacob Garchik (trombone), and Adam O’Farrill (trumpet). Labelmate Laurie Anderson also is featured on the album track “Incarnadine.” The dual 2022 releases’ acclaim included being named Jazz Album of the Year in DownBeat’s annual Critics Poll.\n\nKeyon Harrod – Foreverland CD (Concord Jazz)\n\nAcclaimed trumpeter-composer Keyon Harrold makes his Concord Jazz label debut with his much-anticipated new album, Foreverland. Blending a unique hybrid of jazz, hip-hop and R&B, this special curation of ten original tracks includes special guests Common, Robert Glasper, PJ Morton and more. [Vinyl version due April 24.]\n\nEthan Iverson – Technically Acceptable CD (Blue Note)\n\nPianist and composer Ethan Iverson follows-up his 2022 Blue Note debut Every Note Is True with Technically Acceptable, a far-ranging new project that presents two different trios-Thomas Morgan/Kush Abadey and Simón Willson/Vinnie Sperrazza-performing a set of striking new Iverson originals plus singular new versions of “Killing Me Softly With His Song” and “‘Round Midnight”. The album concludes with the recorded premiere of Iverson’s Piano Sonata which is given a tour-de-force performance by Iverson himself.\n\nRobby Krieger – Robby Krieger And The Soul Savages CD/LP (Players Club)\n\nRobby Krieger knows that when you assemble the right bunch of musicians, and trust in the creative process, magic happens. As a founding member of The Doors, the guitarist intuitively understands the beauty of free-flowing collaboration and telepathic group interplay. Robby Krieger And The Soul Savages was recorded in an old-school style with a bunch of friends jamming and recording in a relaxed studio setting. Tracked at Robby’s own Love Street Studios in Glendale, California, it finds Robby stretching out over cinematic groove music inspired by classic soul, 1960s jazz, blues, rock, psychedelic rock, and beyond. The 10-song album explores the soul-jazz, dirty blues, and noir-ish roots of The Doors while also furthering Robby’s career as a jazz-fusion guitarist. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nLaufey – Everything I Know About Love CD (Laufey LLC)\n\nReleased last year on CD – now available on vinyl. Raised between Reykjavík and Washington, DC, Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter Laufey makes music that is the byproduct of rich cultural heritages and mixed musical influences. Inspired in part by her mother, a classical violinist, Laufey took up piano and cello early on. But it wasn’t until deep diving into her father’s record collection, consisting of jazz artists Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, that she launched into her musical journey. Through free-form scatting and reposeful vocal styling, Laufey transforms her heartfelt truths into a revived classic-sound for contemporary audiences to resonate with.\n\nMasterplan – Masterplan [Reissue/2003] CD+DVD/2xLP (AFM)\n\nCD and vinyl reissues of a German-Euro melodic power metal masterpiece [A limited-edition silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMetalite – Expedition One CD/2xLP (AFM)\n\nFifth album from the Swedish power metal act. [A translucent baby blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nNeck Deep – Neck Deep CD/LP (Hopeless)\n\nNeck Deep’s current outlook is “Don’t Overthink it.” The songs on upcoming self-titled album “are just fun, and we’re not taking ourselves too seriously. We’ve basically done 90% of the production and recording ourselves… We’ve pretty much built this record fro the ground up with little to no outside help By that factor alone, it’s the most Neck Deep record there’s ever been, or at least since our first record, Wishful Thinking. It’s the first time since then that we’ve done everything ourselves” explains Ben Barlow. [Two vinyl colorways are available: indie store exclusive pink and limited-edition orange.]\n\nNMIXX – Fe3O4: BREAK [Mixx Blood Version] CD (Jyp Ent/Republic)\n\nNMIXX – Fe3O4: BREAK [Square One Version] CD (Jyp Ent/Republic)\n\nSecond mini album from the 4th generation K-pop all girl group.\n\nLizzie No – Halfsies CD/LP (Thirty Tigers)\n\nHalfsies is the third album from Brooklyn, NY singer songwriter, guitarist and harpist Lizzie No. Genre is a construct. To categorize artists might make it easier to organize record stores and playlists but there’s no one term that could define any artist, least of all one like Lizzie No. You could say that Lizzie No makes Americana music, in that her work pulls from the rhythms and traditions of blues, folk, and country – not unlike the artists to whom she’s most often compared: Allison Russell, Rhiannon Giddens and Adia Victoria – but her collaborations with Brian Dunne, Pom Pom Squad and Domino Kirkie display an undeniable indie influence that allows her to move frequently and seamlessly between overlapping musical circles. The erasure of Black artists is central to the myth of country music – what it means, what it stands for, where it comes from – and so simply by standing on stage and singing, whether it be in theaters across the country with the Black Opry, or leading Queer Line Dancing nights with the Lavender Country tour, Lizzie No is staging a kind of protest. [A limited-edition purple color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPlush – Find The Beautiful CD (Pavement Ent.)\n\nTwo years ago, Plush emerged on the rock scene with its dynamic, self-titled debut album. “The mission of Plush is to bring the heart of rock back to the mainstream with a new, fresh spin on the sounds you already love,” said singer and guitarist Moriah Formica.\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Hackney Diamonds (Live Edition) 2xCD (Geffen)\n\nThis special double-CD set of Hackney Diamonds includes Live at Racket NYC, featuring seven tracks the band performed at the intimate launch event in New York City on October 19, 2023, with debut live performances of “Angry”, “Bite My Head Off”, “Whole Wide World”, and “Sweet Sounds Of Heaven”, with Lady Gaga.\n\nSaxon – Hell, Fire And Damnation CD/LP (Militia Guard Music)\n\nNew album from the veteran UK metal band. [An indie store exclusive vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSister Sadie – No Fear CD (Mountain Home)\n\nSister Sadie is a straight-ahead bluegrass band comprised of five good friends born out of what was originally supposed to be a onetime jam at The Station Inn in Nashville, TN. Shortly after that sold-out show, the band began getting calls for gigs and the girls decided to officially form Sister Sadie. They decided that each member would remain in their own bands and from time to time get together for special events to perform. The name, Sister Sadie, was inspired by a Tony Rice song, “Little Sadie”, and the fact that the ladies feel as though they are sisters.\n\nSleater-Kinney – Little Rope CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\nSleater-Kinney returns with Little Rope, one of the finest, most delicately layered records in the band’s 30-year career. On the surface, Little Rope‘s ten songs veer from spare to anthemic, catchy to deliberately hard turning. But beneath that are perhaps the most complex and subtle arrangements of any Sleater-Kinney record, and a lyrical and emotional compass pointed firmly in the direction of something both liberating and terrifying: the sense that only way to gain control is to let it go. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSlift – Ilion CD/LP+MP3 (Sub Pop)\n\nSlift’s third album Ilion is a towering work of rock music, a steamrolling record that starts at the highest peak and never lets up. If that sounds overwhelming, trust that this Toulouse, France trio have you in good hands. Ilion feels massive and oceanic, merging the furious intensity of metal and the wigged-out guitar heroics of psych rock with post-rock’s epic sense of scale. ILION is the kind of music where you listen to it and think to yourself, “This came from only three people?” [A limited-edition red w/ black ‘loser edition’ color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Spacelords – Nectar Of The Gods CD/LP (Tonzonen)\n\nThe Spacelords – the galactic grooving space rockers in the stoner space-time continuum – grace our solar sound system with their latest album, Nectar Of The Gods.\n\nBrittney Spencer – My Stupid Life CD/LP (Elektra)\n\n“Nashville’s new star” (CBS This Morning) Brittney Spencer releases her highly anticipated debut album, My Stupid Life. The first track, “Bigger Than The Song”, showcases Spencer’s ability to excel on the fringe of genre periphery with her honest and free-spirited songwriting. The album’s 13 tracks are a culmination of her experience during her time trying to “make it” in Music City, discovering herself in the process. The Baltimore native moved to Nashville ten years ago, and this album is Spencer’s commitment to be unapologetically herself.\n\nSpiritualized – Amazing Grace [Reissue/2003] CD/LP (Fat Possum)\n\nCD and vinyl reissues of the fifth album by the British rock band Spiritualized, so named to indicate its considerable gospel influence. After working with free-jazz collective Spring Heel Jack on one of their albums and tour, frontman Jason Pierce was inspired to make a record with the same principles. His approach meant that the rest of Spiritualized was given the songs on the same day as they were recorded, meaning the record (including orchestral overdubs) was completed in three weeks. This is a huge difference compared to its predecessor, Let It Come Down, which took four years to record.\n\nTheocracy – Mosaic CD/2xLP (Atomic Fire)\n\nNew album by power/progressive metal act. [A limited-edition clear w/ smoke color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nTravis Japan – Road To A [Standard Edition] CD (Capitol)\n\nTravis Japan – Road To A [Limited Edition] CD (Capitol)\n\n“A” stands for “Authenticity”, capturing Travis Japan’s “dedication to delivering the genuine essence of entertainment signifying their commitment to delivering authentic and trustworthy entertainment.” Lol.\n\nColter Wall – Imaginary Appalachia [Reissue/2015] CDEP/12” (RCA)\n\nColter Wall – Colter Wall [Reissue/2017] CD/LP (RCA)\n\nColter Wall – Songs Of The Plains [Reissue/2018] CD/LP (RCA)\n\nColter Wall – Western Swing & Waltzes And Other Punchy Songs [Reissue/2020] CD/LP (RCA)\n\nCD and limited-edition red color vinyl reissues of Colter Wall’s debut EP and first three albums. His style is folk, Americana, blues, and country. His voice has a resemblance to Johnny Cash, and performance and lyrics in the vein of Townes Van Zandt and Hank Williams.\n\nSteve Wilson – Grace For Drowning [Reissue/2011] CD (Snapper Classics)\n\nCD reissue of the second solo studio album by Steven Wilson, producer, songwriter, and frontman of Porcupine Tree. Originally released in 2011.\n\nJohn Zorn – The Hermetic Organ Volume 11 – For Terry Riley CD (Tzadik)\n\nThis newest edition of The Hermetic Organ is a beautiful and evocative tribute to one of Zorn’s biggest mentors, the pioneer West Coast visionary, Terry Riley. Performed at San Francisco’s historic Grace Cathedral during the epic concert series presented by Fred Barnes at the Great American Music Hall in September 2023 for Zorn’s 70th birthday, this is one of the most touching and personal of all Zorn’s organ recitals. Present in the audience were a large number of the composer’s closest and oldest friends, and as a result the music has a deep spiritual edge. Looming over much of this music is the spirit of Terry Riley, one of Zorn’s early influences, and one of his dearest friends.\n\nDVDs + Blu-ray:\n\nNeil Diamond – The Thank You Australia Concert: Live 1976 DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nThis concert from the Sydney Sports Stadium was the culmination of Neil Diamond’s Australia & New Zealand tour in 1976, an event which marked his comeback to the live stage after a creatively fruitful four-year sabbatical from live performance. The vast crowd was typical of this record-breaking tour, still one of the most memorable in Australian history, and Neil Diamond delivered the enthralling performance of a true showman. Includes a restored version of “Morningside”, a track that was partly cut due to a commercial break in the original live broadcast, a 50-minute interview with Neil Diamond filmed during the Australian tour, and more.\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\nThe 90 Day men – We Blame Chicago 5xLP (Numero)\n\n90 Day Men spent a decade boldly in conflict with the world, catering to no one and careening toward its own abyss. Forged by Midwestern teens amid a late- ‘90s spike in angular indie rock, the band wrote itself into the lexicon of Chicago music history. Eschewing trend and time, 90 Day Men was as ornate as it was alienating, transcending genre, and embracing the strange. This 5xLP set, remastered by Heba Kadry, collects the band’s three studio albums and a previously unreleased 2001 Peel Session, plus EPs, singles, and outtakes, all detailed within a 68-page oral history curated by Joan Of Arc’s Tim Kinsella. [A multi-color vinyl edition is available.]\n\nÓlafur Arnalds – For Now I’m In Winter (10th Anniversary Edition) LP (Mercury)\n\nCelebrating the 10th Anniversary Edition of Olafur Arnalds For Now I Am Winter, the album has been remastered for vinyl and pressed in a limited edition clear color with exclusive art prints inside.\n\nLloyd Banks – The Course Of The Inevitable 3 2xLP (RRC)\n\nThe Course of the Inevitable 3: Pieces of My Pain” marks a triumphant return for rapper Lloyd Banks, as he delves deep into the intricacies of his life and experiences, unveiling raw emotions and profound wisdom. In this highly anticipated album, Banks collaborates with legendary artists such as Method Man, Cormega, 38 Spesh, Vado, Dave East, and Tony Yayo, creating a powerful narrative that resonates with listeners.

Creed Taylor signed Benson immediately after Wes Montgomery’s passing in 1968 – he was being groomed for it by Verve’s house producer, Esmond Edwards, and arranger, Tom McIntosh, before he ever came to CTI. Taylor paired Benson with arranger Don Sebesky (who had done plenty of work on Montgomery’s A&M sides) and engineer Rudy Van Gelder. Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter (both members of the Miles Davis Quintet with whom Benson had guested earlier that year), bassist Richard Davis, and pianist Hank Jones were all guests.\n\nBillow Observatory – Calque / Soliton LP (Felte)\n\nWhirlpool blue colorway. Billow Observatory’s second EP Soliton follows up last year’s Calque EP. Soliton maximizes the compact format by further illuminating lesser-traveled paths. Contemplation and exploration weave harmoniously through five mysterious tracks. Influenced by a wide range of styles and sounds, such as Japanese ambient, the muted dissonance of Pharoah Sanders, and the chilly dub of the ~scape catalog, Soliton evokes visions of lonely night drives punctuated by bright moments of bliss.\n\nBirthmark – Birth Of Omni LP+MP3 (Polyvinyl)\n\nGoldenrod colorway. On Birthmark’s latest album, Birth Of Omni, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Nate Kinsella delivers his most thematically dynamic and experimental album to date. The album highlights the gargantuan shift in perspective that comes along with becoming a parent, including core themes of identity, duality, sexuality, overwhelming responsibility, feminism, and fear of men. Over the course of the album’s ten songs, Kinsella takes the listener on a wild ride, full of emotions and inner thoughts.\n\nBlack Josh x Wino Willy – Today’s The Day LP (RRC)\n\nManchester emcee Black Josh joins forces with New Orleans analog instrumental warrior Wino Willy on collaboration project Today’s The Day. Since the epic opening joint Habitat and throughout the seven joints on this project the two show an incredible chemistry, with the English lyrical maverick delivering some incredible wordplay on Wino Willy’s grimy productions. As a member of Cult Of The Damned, and Levelz, and one of the standout artists of the Blah roster, Black Josh has been killing it whatever the backdrop and this record is no different, with fellow nationals Lee Scott and SonnyJim joining on the first single “E R M8” as well as Da$h on “Vince Carter”. An electrifying collaboration by two masters of their craft.\n\nGianni Brezzo – Filigrani LP (Jakarta)\n\nFresh from success of his 2022 opus, “Tutto Passa,” sync in HBO’s Gossip Girl, and baroque excursion “Music for Harlequins,” Gianni Brezzo, aka producer and multi-instr Marvin Horsch, unveils EP “Filigrani.” The tracks, meticulously crafted, were born live in the studio, capturing the raw energy and creativity of Brezzo’s jazz-driven genius. “Filigrani” introduces a unique fusion, seamlessly blending jazz progressions w/ a touch of electronica. Brezzo weaves a tapestry of sound, inviting listeners into a world where guitar melodies intertwine with subtle drumbeats, dreamy harps, and the enchanting whispers of saxophones and flutes. The result? A groove-driven masterpiece that expands the boundaries of sonic artistry.\n\nClifford Brown – Memorial Album [Reissue/1956] LP (Blue Note)\n\nThe incomparable trumpeter Clifford Brown recorded two leader sessions for Blue Note in 1953 (a co-led quintet date with Lou Donaldson and his own sextet date) that were compiled on the Memorial Album shortly after his tragic death in 1956. Brownie’s star burns bright from the blistering “Cherokee” to the stunning ballad “Easy Living.”\n\nCrimeapple/ Clovis Ochin – Cacio & Pepe LP (RRC Music)\n\nConceived in Paris and brought to life in Roma during a spring day flooded with good wine and even better food, Cacio & Pepe is the perfect mélange between the NJ rapper of Colombian descent and the Parisian bon vivant, always doing what they do best: enjoying the fine pleasures of life.\n\nCannons – Fever Dream [Reissue/2022] LP (Columbia)\n\nCannons – Heartbeat Highway LP (Columbia)\n\nHeartbeat Highway is the fourth album released by Cannons, and their second album on Columbia Records following their breakout 2022 album Fever Dream. Unlike Fever Dream, which was written during the COVID-19 pandemic, Heartbeat Highway was written and produced while the band was touring across the United States, Japan, and Australia, which also inspired many of the songs. Speaking about the album, singer Michelle Joy describes it as “a soul stirring journey through the intricacies of love, desire, heartbreak and passion”. In speaking about Fever Dreams, Michelle Joy says: “Fever Dream represents everything Cannons is. There are some lonely songs, some longing songs, and some love songs. Over the last couple of years, writing lifted our spirits and provided a medium to escape reality. These songs kept us going, so I hope people will find a piece of themselves inside of the record. I’ve realized how important it is to feel connected to others and hope this album helps everyone feel a little less alone.” [A metallic gold colorway of Heartbeat Highway is available.]\n\nCobrah – Succubus LP (Atlantic)\n\nCobrah’s new EP features “Tequila” – a signature hard hitting bass and club feel was produced by Medium and is a raunchy party song simply put about sex, money and drugs. Cobrah uses her catchy voice to carry over the simplistic grungy electro beat almost acting as a percussive instrument.\n\nCosmic Analog Ensemble – Les Grandes Vacances LP (Jakarta)\n\nJakarta Records is proud to present Les Grandes Vacances courtesy of Beirut’s Cosmic Analog Ensemble, aka multi-instrumental phenom Charif Megarbane. The LP is an expansive musical odyssey, one that paints a melodic tapestry woven from an eclectic panorama of sonic tools.

From vibrant funky energy to introspective moods and library-inspired tunes, Les Grandes Vacances captures the essence of past and present, inviting you to indulge in the perfect balance of “groove-stalgia.”\n\nCough – Ritual Abuse [Reissue/2010] 2xLP (Relapse)\n\nCough – Still They Prey [Reissue/2016] 2xLP (Relapse)\n\nTwo new splatter colorways. Richmond’s Cough delivered thoroughly massive, psychedelic doom on their aptly titled Relapse debut Ritual Abuse. The albums five epic tracks are impenetrable walls of sludge; at points suffocating and claustrophobic, at others warped and hallucinogenic. ‘Ritual Abuse’ is an impressive monolith of sound and volume, and one of the finest moments yet of 21st century doom.Produced by Electric Wizard’s Jus Oborn and recorded by Oborn and Windhand’s Garrett Morris, Still They Pray is the kind of monolithic cosmic doom that will take the listener to the heights of despair and the bottom of the abyss. With Still They Pray, Cough summon psychedelic feedback-driven melodies just to deconstruct them to their core. This is easily Cough at their most focused: pessimistic riffs and tortured grooves collide in melodic agony alongside a hallucinogenic blend of harsh and clean incantations, crushing and cathartic yet utterly mesmerizing. Step through the gates of madness and stare into the void.\n\nDeadmau5 – for lack of a better name [Reissue/2009] 2xLP (Mau5Trap Recordings)\n\nBlue colorway. Originally released in 2009, ‘for lack of a better name’ is the fourth studio album by Canadian electronic music producer & composer deadmau5. Comprised of some of deadmau5’s biggest hits, including fan favorite “Ghosts ‘n’ Stuff” featuring Rob Swire, which reached 2x RIAA Platinum certifications.\n\nElzhi & Oh No – Heavy Vibrato LP (Nature Sounds)\n\nKnown for weaving together complex rhymes with style, Elzhi has been rapping circles around the competition for more than two decades. After years as a member of iconic group Slum Village, Elzhi’s impressive solo career has included projects produced by acclaimed artists like Black Milk, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Khrysis, and Will Sessions. Now, the Detroit emcee is linking with California beat maestro Oh No for the new collaborative album Heavy Vibrato. A multitalented underground hip-hop luminary, Oh No has built a formidable resume behind the boards, crafting tracks for Mos Def, Freddie Gibbs, MF DOOM, Action Bronson, Talib Kweli, Ab-Soul, Danny Brown, and more. Heavy Vibrato is a thrilling showcase for Elzhi’s lyrical wizardry and cinematic storytelling, as Oh No breathes new life into a compelling tapestry of jazz samples, producing the entire collection.\n\nLee Fields & The Expressions – Emma Jean LP (Truth & Soul)\n\nClear vinyl pressing. Coming at a time when many new artists are trying to emulate the soul and swagger of the 1960s, Mr. Fields showers us with authenticity on the 11-track set, highlighted by first single “Magnolia”. Hear the refreshed cover of the JJ Cale track that embodies the late, great American singer-songwriter and the Tulsa Sound he helped create. Since releasing his first album in 1969, Fields has continued to make music for the last 45 years. They’ve pushed their sound in new directions, moving from being content as contemporary soul music royalty and instead delving into and exploring its next steps. There’s a sharper wisdom in the songwriting–from the having loved, lost, and learned vibe of “Don’t Leave Me This Way”, backed by crooning guitar and wailing horns, to the sophisticated arrangements and studio acumen that’s pared with Lee’s straightforward sincerity in “Just Can’t Win”.\n\nJerry Garcia – Run For The Roses [Reissue/1982] LP (ATO)\n\nJerry Garcia’s fourth and final full-length studio album originally released in 1982, Run for the Roses was produced by Garcia and John Kahn from sessions held at the Dead’s Club Front studio and Devonshire Studios in Los Angeles.

In addition to Garcia and Kahn, Run For The Roses features Merl Saunders and several past, present or future Jerry Garcia Band members including Ron Tutt, Liz Stires, Jimmy Warren, and the debut of Melvin Seals.\n\nGrandson – I Love You I’m Trying LP (Fueled By Ramen)\n\nStandard black vinyl pressing. Where his past work tackled political and social issues in nature, 2023’s I Love You I’m Trying turns the lens inward resulting in a 12-track collection of Grandson’s most personal and vulnerable songwriting to date.\n\nRiley Green – Ain’t My Last Rodeo LP (BMLG)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Riley Green’s new album Ain’t My Last Rodeo delivers more of the signature no-gimmick, undeniably Country sound fans have come to know, love and obsess over. The music and lyrics, both heavily influenced by blue-collar roots and small town life, exemplify Green’s homage to his experiences, passions and love of family. The title bares its name from his poignant track, “My Last Rodeo,” which Green wrote solo following one of the final conversations he had with his late Grandaddy Buford Green.\n\nGoya Gumbani – When The Past Bloomed LP (RRC Music)\n\nGoya Gumbani’s music just oozes soul. He always bares his heart on instrumentals that are incredibly lush and dense, with his openness and introspection to go with it. When The Past Bloomed is another great project from an artist who is only getting better.\n\nGusGus – Mobile Home LP (Oroom)\n\nWorld-renowned group GusGus return with their 11th studio album, the highly emotive Mobile Home, marking their first album release since 2018. The collective once again prove their commitment to pushing their artistic boundaries as they release one of their most ambitious and powerful albums in decades.\n\nHard-Ons! – Very Exciting [Reissue/2003] LP (Hey Suburbia)\n\nOne of the most enduring bands in the Australian rock scene, the Hard-Ons’ 35-year legacy in the punk rock world is invaluable. This is the first vinyl reissue of their 2003 album, the second after their 1998 comeback, originally released on the Chatterbox label in Australia and Bomp! Records in the USA.\n\nJoe Harrison – Shadowboxing LP (Madlib Invazion)\n\nThe Madlib Invazion Music Library Series Entry #7: Producer/multi-instrumentalist Joe Harrison (El Michels Affair/Gunna) fuses modern production with vintage instruments, drawing a line between J Dilla and David Axelrod. This is the next up in a series of music library releases, with future volumes produced by DJ Muggs, Karriem Riggins, and more. The Madlib Invazion Music Library Series was created by Madlib and Egon to give their creative friends a chance to stretch out and indulge in whatever type of music they wanted. This music was created for easy, one-stop clearance in film and television synchronization usage and for sampling. You can also enjoy these albums in the way that many do with the best of the best vintage library catalogs — listen, ponder, repeat\n\nWarren Haynes – Man In Motion [Reissue/2011] 2xLP (Stax)\n\nTranslucent 180gm translucent ruby red colorway. Warren Haynes has been almost ubiquitous since he joined the Allman Brothers Band. Making his Stax Records debut, Man In Motion is Haynes’ first conscious effort to fully indulge his love for this music, and his first solo record with backing musicians since 1993. Originally released in 2011, the album was co-produced with Gordie Johnson and boasts a stellar cast: George Porter, Jr. (bass,) Ivan Neville (organ, clavinet, backing vocals,) Ian McLagan (Wurlitzer, piano,) Raymond Weber (drums,) Ron Holloway (tenor saxophone,) and Ruthie Foster (backing vocals).\n\nDaniel Johnston – Alive In New York City LP/Cassette (Joyful Noise)\n\nClear vinyl pressing. Daniel played several shows in New York City in April of the year 2000, but there is no way to know for certain the exact date this recording was made, or the venue in which the performance took place. Sorry. This LP was mastered from a DAT Kramer found 20 years later. It contains one brilliant Daniel Johnston performance in its entirety, unedited, unaltered, and unforgettable. These memories conclude with a brief excerpt from a street interview Daniel gave in New York City, recorded during the same period in his extraordinary life.\n\nKing Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard – Demos Vol. 5 + Vol. 6 2xLP (Reverberation Appreciation Society)\n\nCareer spanning demos recorded between 2010 – 2022 by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard Limited to 1000 splatter gatefold 2×12″ LPs. First pressing in a gatefold jacket. Each 12″ in a poly-lined inner-sleeve. A unique hypnotic op art inner label for each 12″. LP 1 pressed on milky clear with cobalt blue splatter color vinyl. LP 2 pressed on milky clear with apple red splatter.\n\nKing Pari – Mary EP [Reissue/2021] 12” (Acrophase)\n\nPink colorway. King Pari is an almost accidental project. Cameron Kinghorn (Nooky Jones) and Joe Paris Christensen (PHO) didn’t even set out to start a band. When Joe texted Cameron some jams whipped up on his tape machine, Cameron hit him back with “what is this? I want in”. Ten minutes before they first linked up, Joe built the loop for their first single, “Sunshine”, which they then wrote on the spot in a flurry on collective inspiration. The rest of the Mary EP grew from recording sessions in Joe’s Northeast Minneapolis bedroom, a guest house in New Orleans and a cabin in rural Wisconsin. Minneapolis left an obvious mark – the influence of Prince and the Minneapolis Sound, approached from a fresh psychedelic angle. It’s been called stonersoul, lo-fi R&B, dub meets ‘80s electro with a heavy dose of funk.\n\nLazarus A.D. – The Onslaught [Reissue/2007] LP (Brutal Planet)\n\nOrange colorway. The Onslaught is a state of the art, ripping thrash album, with all the best bits of Slayer, Exodus, Testament and Anthrax.\n\nSteve Marcus/ Miroslav Vitous/ Sonny Sharrock – Green Line [Reissue/1970] LP (Endless Happiness)\n\nThough only ever released in Japan and in sore need of reissue (affordability not being among the virtues of an original copy), Green Line sits easily alongside the most progressive jazz albums of the early ’70s, many of which featured the work of the quartet’s alumni – namely Sharrock’s uncredited appearance on “Yesternow” for Miles Davis’ A Tribute to Jack Johnson, Vitous’ early fusion-defining tenure with Weather Report, and Marcus’ collaboration with Japanese jazz-rock outfit Jiro Inagaki and Soul Media. And so, Green Line was ultimately the beginning and end of its own trajectory, but damn, what a glorious path it blazed.\n\nMouthbreather – Self-Tape LP (Good Fight Music)\n\nTwo colorways: gold and red & white splatter. Self-Tape is a culmination of everything that MouthBreather has been. While some parts are reminiscent of the earlier blistering sounds of the Pig EP and others allude to the wider range of I’m Sorry Mr. Salesman, Self-Tape is a more dynamic sound than we have ever created. Many of the tracks blend seamlessly into each other, but each is unique in its texture. The lyrics/music for each song are inspired by a scene from a different movie; this is a concept that we’ve been planning on using since Nick (Cates, drummer) came up with it last year. The feeling and message is up for interpretation.\n\nJordan Munson – Heartless Fools LP (Joyful Noise)\n\nColor vinyl pressing. Heartless Fools is a collection of works exploring multiplicity and often contradictory ideas. Supported by a Creative Renewal Fellowship from the Arts Council of Indianapolis, many of the works were realized and recorded in January 2018 at Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavík, Iceland. Since these initial recordings, the music has grown through far-reaching collaborations with musicians in the worlds of jazz, classical, and pop. Album credits include experimental pop trio Square Peg Round Hole, vocalists Isaiah Robinson and Hanna Benn, and Icelandic cellist Þórdís Gerður Jónsdóttir.\n\nμ-Ziq – 1977 2xLP (Balmat)\n\nYellow vinyl color repress. The British producer μ-Ziq has been an inspiration to label co-founders Albert Salinas and Philip Sherburne since the 1990s. In fact, his album-length remix project The Auteurs Vs μ-Ziq was one of the very first pieces of electronic music that Philip bought, way back in 1994. To have the opportunity to release his music now feels like a real full-circle moment. Paradinas, of course, needs no introduction. Under a slew of aliases, chief among them μ-Ziq, the British artist revolutionized leftfield electronic music in the 1990s — coincidentally, this year marks the 30th anniversary of his debut album, Tango N’ Vectif, for his friend and sometime collaborator Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label — and his label Planet Mu has built up a formidable catalog of visionary, forward-looking records, mapping virtually every corner of the electronic spectrum. With 2023’s 1977, he turns the clock backward in a sense, and not just with the album’s title: Rooted in classic ambient and electronic sounds, these 15 tracks evoke the anything-goes spirit of the early ’90s, before the tools and tropes had calcified into cut-and-dried styles.\n\nBud Powell – The Amazing Budd Powell, Vol. 1 [Reissue/1955) LP (Blue Note)\n\nThe amazing bebop piano genius Bud Powell made his most enduring recordings as a leader for Blue Note. Powell’s 1949 and 1951 sessions were compiled in 1955 on The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1. Featuring the pianist with the likes of Sonny Rollins, Fats Navarro, Roy Haynes and Max Roach on bebop classics including “Un Poco Loco” and “Bouncing with Bud”.\n\nOmar A. Rodriguez-Lopez – A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume One [Reissue/2004] 2xLP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez – Omar Rodriguez [Reissue/2005] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez – Se Dice Bisonte, No Bùfalo [Reissue/2007] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Calibration (Is Pushing Luck And Key Too Far) [Reissue/2008] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez – Megaritual [Reissue/2009] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Old Money [Reissue/2009] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez – Solar Gambling [Reissue/2009] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez – Xenophanes [Reissue/2009] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nEl Grupo Nuevo De Omar Rodriguez Lopez – Cryptomnesia [Reissue/2009] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez – Mantra Hiroshima [Reissue/2010] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nEl Trío De Omar Rodrmguez-López – Ciencia De Los Inutiles [Reissue/2010] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nAn acoustic album, written and recorded in a quiet and natural environment in Mexico-City.\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Arañas En La Sombra [Reissue/2016] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Blind Worms Pious Swine [Reissue/2016] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Roman Lips [Reissue/2017] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Zen Thrills [Reissue/2017] LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nOmar Rodriguez-Lopez – Is It The Clouds? LP (Clouds Hill)\n\nA grip of solo albums released by Omar Rodríguez-López (The Mars Volta, At The Drive In). Many are available on vinyl for the first time (outside of the 57-LP box set, Amor de Frances released last month).\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela – Rodrigo y Gabriela [Reissue/2006] 2xLP (ATO)\n\nDeluxe green w/ silver colorway. Rodrigo y Gabriela’s breakthrough self-titled album was released in 2006 and has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide. Affectionately known to fans as “the Crocodile album,” the Mexican duo have dipped into their archive for the Deluxe Edition which features the original album remastered, plus a live set recorded in 2006 at the Olympia Theatre in Paris\n\nScanner – Hypertrace [Reissue/1988] 2xLP (Roar! Rock Of Ages)\n\nScanner – Mental Reservation [Reissue/1995] 2xLP (Roar! Rock Of Ages)\n\nScanner – Ball Of The Damned [Reissue/1996] 2xLP (Roar! Rock Of Ages)\n\nColor vinyl reissues of the veteran German heavy metal band’s first, third, and fourth albums.\n\nSkullcrusher/ The Hated – Words Come Back 7” (Numero)\n\nWhite colorway. Never said it’d be like this, right? Skullcrusher’s 21st century rendering of The Hated’s 1985 early emo blueprint “Words Come Back” reinvents the song as subtle, ambient folk music. The flip features two versions of the original, including Dan Littleton’s home demo, cut in a maddening double groove, and housed in an elegant black and silver sleeve, with embossed braille lettering for the visually impaired. “This is my way of making a punk song,” Skullcrusher’s Helen Ballentine said, “ignoring structure and letting everything just pour out-though quite a bit quieter.”\n\nStatik Selektah – Mahalo 2 (More Hawaiian Instrumentals) 12” (Be With)\n\nTwo seminal 12″ mixes of a pair of enormous tracks from The Whispers. Both boogie/street-funk flavored, these sought-after versions have never been paired on the same record. Side A features the notorious anthem “Keep On Lovin’ Me” (the one with *that* life affirming video) whilst Side B houses the outstanding, semi-slept-on “Turn Me Out”.\n\nSwervedriver – 99th Dream [Reissue/1998] LP (Outer Battery)\n\nRed colorway. Swervedriver’s legendary 99th Dream is available again on vinyl. Initially released in 1998, the band broke up shortly after and this classic LP was lost to the ages. Now reissued as a proper double LP, with a bonus 4th side of remixes from Alan Moulder (My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Lush, etc.).\n\nUlver – Bergtatt – Et Eeventyr I 5 Capitler [Reissue/1995] LP (Century Media)\n\nUlver – Kveldssanger [Reissue/1996] LP (Century Media)\n\nTranslucent purple and translucent blue color vinyl pressings of the genre-spanning Norwegian band’s first two albums. On their demos and first album, Bergtat I 5 Capitler, they played black/folk metal, 1996’s Kveldssanger is an entirely acoustic folk album.\n\nWindhand/ Cough – Reflection Of The Negative [Reissu/e2013] LP (Relapse)\n\nBlack, white & gray splatter colorway. “If ever there were an optimal time for Virginia doom acts Cough and Windhand to release their best music to date, this moment seems like the right one. During the last few years, both Richmond bands have fostered a buzz that’s escalated steadily enough to mirror the electric crawls of their music.” – Pitchfork\n\nYusuf (Cat Stevens) – King Of A Land LP (BMG)\n\nLimited white color vinyl pressing. 2023’s King Of A Land is an epic body of work. More than a decade in the making, its 12 new songs are full of extraordinary surprises. Unique and transportive, Yusuf’s music, words and melodies paint a vivid picture of a world which embraces the lost lands of truisms and stainless youth and brings it into touching distance. His poetical storytelling invites the listener on a journey towards the gates of an alternative universe to that which we presently inhabit – where happy endings can possibly happen.\n\nCassettes:\n\nGreen Day – Saviors (Reprise)\n\nGreen Day is not your savior. But the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll might be. And as the greatest punk band alive, they’re the loudest vessel we have… to give it a shot. Green Day is ready to flip off the famous, stupid, and contagious, by putting a mirror to the present tense like only they can, with Saviors, their inspired new studio album. Amazingly, Saviors is Green Day’s 14th studio album, yet somehow this enduring power trio, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tré Cool & Mike Dirnt, remain devoted to their defiant craft that has fueled their career-long destruction of every boundary bestowed on the genre, and landed 3 East Bay punks in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame.\n\nDaniel Johnston – Alive In New York City (Joyful Noise)\n\nClear vinyl pressing. Daniel played several shows in New York City in April of the year 2000, but there is no way to know for certain the exact date this recording was made, or the venue in which the performance took place. Sorry. This LP was mastered from a DAT Kramer found 20 years later. It contains one brilliant Daniel Johnston performance in its entirety, unedited, unaltered, and unforgettable. These memories conclude with a brief excerpt from a street interview Daniel gave in New York City, recorded during the same period in his extraordinary life."
