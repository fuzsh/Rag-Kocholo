        "text": "Masada: Live in Sevilla 2000 (2000)\n\nThe quartet that finally gained Zorn notoriety and for good reason. The Masada Songbook is a genius collection of Zorn compositions that take in all influences (hardcore punk, Sephardic, Arabic, jazz, rock, surf, and classical) that Zorn classifies as \"Radical Jewish Culture\" music. Standout tracks from this concert include \"Beeroth,\" \"Ne'eman,\" and \"Bith Aneth.\" The empathy is inspiring and leaves the listener awestruck. MUCH more than Ornette Coleman meets klezmer!!!\n\nJamie Saft: Sovlanut (2000)\n\nNothing short of a stroke of genius. Saft creates music that uses electronic and acoustic instruments to draw upon reggae, Arabic, and Jewish influences, and the result is an innovative original effort that is club music at its best. Joining Saft's wizard-like keyboard skills are Chris Speed on clarinet, Jim Black on drums and Jonathan Maron (from Groove Collective) on bass. One of the hippest selections in the Tzadik catalogue.\n\nJohn Zorn: Filmworks Vol. I (1986-1990) (1997)\n\nThe first in a 14-volume series that exposes Zorn's talents as a film score composer, here from 1986 - 1990. Zorn uses inventive instrumentation throughout, times range from 5 minutes to 15 seconds, and the styles range the gammut: \"Sex-Shop Boogaloo\" is New Orleans-influenced; \"Going to Dinner\" sounds like a Seijun Suzuki film noir blues; and \"Death Waltz Fantasy\" finds the central nerve of your spine to give you icy goosebumps.\n\nMarc Ribot: Shoe String Symphonettes (1997)\n\nRibot's first film music effort for Tzadik is amazing! Ribot has an instantly indentifiable sound on his guitar, and his film compositions are just as unique. This palette of weird, strange, and beautiful textures has significantly contributed to the Tzadik film catalogue. Dave Douglas and even Zorn himself also appear here.\n\nJohn Zorn: The Big Gundown: The Music of Ennio Morricone (1990)\n\nTake Morricone's wonderful, lyrical melodies for such films as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly , The Big Gundown , and The Sicilian Clan , and run them through the ever- innovative Zorn filter. The result is pure, intense, musical magic. Zorn creates various sonic soundscapes that instantly create a picture in the mind. With classics such as \"The Ballad of Hank McCain,\" sung by Mike Patton, \"Poverty (Once Upon a Time in America)\" featuring Toots Thielemans, and \"The Sicilian Clan\" featuring Mark Feldman, Erik Friedlander, and Greg Cohen (later known as the Masada String Trio) with Joey Baron, Cyro Baptista, and Marc Ribot, one can sees that this a Downtown NYC tour de force. Exceptional music, exceptional arrangements, exceptional musicians.\n\nMasada String Trio: The Circle Maker (1998)\n\nThis string trio consists of Mark Feldman (violin), Erik Friedlander (cello), and Greg Cohen (bass). Their performance of and improvising over compositions from Zorn's Masada Songbook provide aural testament to Zorn's infectious musical concoctions: It doesn't matter if it's Zorn, Douglas, Baron, and Cohen playing these compositions, or not  Feldman, Friedlander, and Cohen keep the same excitement level of \"masada magic.\"\n\nSteven Bernstein: Diaspora Soul (1999)\n\nBest known for his work with Sex Mob, Bernstein emits tantalizing and zany arrangements of Jewish music within the contexts of Afro-Cuban and New Orleans styles. Funky, groovin', and just pure genius at work! Bernstein has had many successful projects in the past, but nothing like this effort. This will remain in your CD player for months.\n\nJohn Zorn: Bar Kokhba (1996)\n\nThe Masada Songbook set for chamber groups. Zorn's music in the hands of musical masters like Ribot, Joey Baron, Cyro Baptista, John Medeski, David Krakauer, Douglas, Cohen, and Anthony Coleman creates outrageous moments and some tear-jerking moments too. Outstanding tracks are \"Maskil,\" a duet between Ribot and Cohen, \"Nefesh\" in a Bud Powell-esque swingin' piano trio, and \"Sheloshim\" with Dave Douglas. Must have for any Zorn fan, and a great find for any fan of Jewish music.\n\nIkue Mori/ Fred Frith/ Kato Hideki Death Ambient (1995)\n\nMusic like no other  brooding, dark, and ominous music you will not find anywhere else. Frith's guitar mastery and Mori's drum samplings are simply amazing. Hideki's bass (from Groove Collective) is one of the most poignant traits of the entire effort. Definitely experimental, undiluted in its pure artistic vision and form, and could only happen on Tzadik.\n\nNaked City: Black Box (Torture Garden / Leng Tch'e) (1997)\n\nNaked City, like Masada, draws upon many influences: Film music, surf, jazz, classical, rock, and most especially hardcore. What a musical marvel! The speed metal and energetic outpouring on Torture Garden will leave any listener in a frenzy from the tightness, precision, and cohesiveness between Zorn, Baron, Frisell, Frith, Horvitz, and Yamantaka Eye. On the other hand, Leng Tch'e is more like an ambient suite that gradually climaxes to universal catastrophic proportions by the end, providing perfect complement and balance.\n\nMilton Babbitt: Occasional Variations (2003)\n\nOne of the most interesting and misunderstood composers of contemporary music in the 20th Century here delivers three world premieres; the set includes difficult and challenging string quartets, an electronic music composition that creates sonic landscapes the mind could never conjure up alone, and a guitar piece definitely indebted to guitarist Eddie Lang.\n\nJohn Zorn: Chimeras (2003)\n\nInspired by Arnold Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire,\" Zorn concocts this wonderful creation with the same instrumentation that Schoenberg used with the addition of percussion. Zorn writes each movement to avoid a specific designated pitch to create one of his most beautifully haunting works, leaving the listener with an icy hand ferociously gripping their heartstrings."
