        "text": "Anthony Coleman: Lapidation\n\nIt was sometime in 1974 that a number of composition students were sitting at a table in the cafeteria of the New England Conservatory discussing the various musical issues of the day when Donald Martino, one of our Faculty Fearless Leaders,turned to Anthony Coleman and said “You know, Anthony, you are a truly literate musician.” Over the years, this condition has only intensified. I remember this quote now, in 2007, not only because it was true at the time, but also because after listening to the music on this CD I am deeply impressed that Anthony is able to draw from so many varied, disparate, and even contradictory sources, and still emerge with such a singular and consistent voice. It takes a truly literate and sophisticated mind to perceive the common threads of many languages and to sense their underlying unity.\n\nListening to any of the five works on this CD is to enter into a particular world, highly specific in material but nearly hallucinatory in formal development. The music starts, becomes linear, suspends, goes vertical, goes backward, goes forward, produces vague memories, and ends. What happened? Something.\n\nAnthony was born in New York City in 1955 and is a pure product of that city’s musical energy. In high school he obsessed over Duke Ellington (a not-so-common thing for a high school kid in the late sixties and early seventies), hearing the band live for the first time on his fourteenth birthday. He subsequently got to know Ellington and the band personally, hanging out with them at gigs, and attending a workshop that they gave at the University of Wisconsin in the summer of 1972. Their influence was pervasive.\n\nAnthony then began his Bachelor’s degree at the New England Conservatory in 1973, going there at the urging of Jaki Byard, the legendary pianist and sideman in the Mingus bands, with whom Anthony had studied since he was thirteen and who was a member of the NEC faculty at that time. While there Anthony studied with the important jazz composer and theorist George Russell, and also with the classical composers Donald Martino and Malcolm Peyton. Anthony has worked this “jazz/classical” dichotomy hard for the last thirty-some years. Along with these mentors, Anthony counts among his influences Webern, Feldman, Varèse, Monk, Wolpe, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Schoenberg, Ornette, Gamelan Gong Kebyar, Bartók, and Janáček. Naturally, this is only a partial listing. Coleman, being a first-rate composer, is also a fine rip-off artist, and has mined the fertile territory these musicians have left him with great dexterity and elegance.\n\nHe completed a master’s degree from Yale in 1979 before hightailing it away from academia and moving back to his spiritual home, New York City. Over the next two decades he would become an integral part of the burgeoning downtown improvisation scene, working with John Zorn, Glenn Branca, and Elliott Sharp during some of the most crucial phases of their individual musical developments. Anthony also led some of the best and most interesting bands of that era, including by Night, Sephardic Tinge, Selfhaters, and Selfhaters Orchestra, each group exploring a particular aspect of his inexhaustible musical personality.\n\nAs one might imagine would be the case with a composer who has spent many years working in many improvising bands as both a leader and side person, there is a strong element of collaboration in Anthony’s music. Several musicians on this recording (most notably Doug Wieselman, Marty Ehrlich, Jim Pugliese, and Joseph Kubera) have worked with Anthony for several decades and the individual “sounds” of each of these outstanding musicians have contributed to Anthony’s palette and voice. This is, in many ways, very similar to the way Ellington worked with and was shaped by members of his band. In looking at the scores of Coleman’s music (all of which are clearly and fully notated) one can hear the transformation on the recording of the written music into the living sound. The effect of the individual musicians who play his music is palpable and an essential part of each of these compositions.\n\nI spoke with the percussionist Jim Pugliese about what it was like to rehearse and perform this music. He said that he realized after a rehearsal of Lapidation that he should be prohibited from operating heavy machinery or driving a car for several hours after rehearsing a piece of Anthony’s. This intoxication can be possibly attributed to a number of factors. One is the insistent but irregular repetition of motive. In a completely un-minimalist way, Anthony takes a motive and obsesses over it, taking it apart and looking at it from every possible angle, expanding it and contracting it, until leaving it for another motive which is frequently another version of, or an expansion of the very same motive. By doing this in such a rhythmically irregular and unstable way, one’s perception of the music enters a state of suspension. Speaking with Marty Ehrlich about rehearsing and recording this music, he said he wished he had a video camera to record Coleman’s conducting because his attitude reflected the music so well. Anthony would smile, laugh, or cackle at the music as it proceeded, taking delight in its sheer perverse existence.\n\nLapidation (2002), for ten players, was written for House Blend, the late, great, resident ensemble at The Kitchen. Shortly after September 11, 2001, Anthony was reading an article in the French newspaper Libération which described the stoning( lapidation in French) of a Sudanese woman, hence the title. The piece begins in iconic fashion. Anthony uses a Varèsean technique of creating a melody by having each instrument blast a separate pitch in a particular register. At the very opening one hears an E in the clarinet followed by a C-sharp in the tenor sax; an octave lower we hear the trombone on a G-sharp followed by the trumpet on a B, with the violin and cello in the middle alternating G-sharps, Gs, and F-sharps. The piano and bass provide support with octave C-sharps, and the two percussionists whack objects (usually drums and cymbals) almost always in rhythmic unison. This creates a fascinating kaleidoscopic effect as it evolves, blurring the identity of each instrument and, as new elements are introduced, transforming the music into new harmonies and timbres. For instance, the sonority evolves from the pervasive minor third at the opening to a minor third with an added minor second (for example,E–C-sharp–C natural). This pitch collection (referred to back in the day as “the cosmopolitan trichord” because of its myriad uses and possibilities) comes to play a dominant role in the rest of the composition. Gradually, as it moves forward,the music seems to question its identity. A fragmentation occurs, continuing until the arrival of a piano solo, which attempts to re-combine the fragmented elements into a new identity. The new motive in the piano then finds itself in the presence of a modified version of the opening, culminating in a very unexpected and very sweet phrase for violin, cello, and tenor sax. A motor rhythm in the bass then announces the presumed move to the end. There is a blast of energy, with all pitches locked in register, and all instruments locked on pitch, but things again fall apart. We find ourselves in tentative territory with fragmented memories of the cosmopolitan trichord before giving way to a cohesive, abrasive blast that is a paraphrase of the end of Octandre by Edgard Varèse.\n\nEast Orange (2006), from Coleman’s suite Three Places in New Jersey, is a brief work for solo piano that is played with stylistic authority by Joseph Kubera. The major seventh, which turns up again in I Diet on Cod, anchors the piece with a jabbing insistence. In fact, the piece essentially deals with two elements—arpeggiation and the jabbing chords, along with the occasional outburst of a melodic figure. Structurally, it is as if Anthony were reminiscing about the first movement of Webern’s Variations for Piano (perhaps while listening to a Thelonious Monk solo record) and deciding it was time to respond. The sound world of East Orange is many miles from the Webern, but the germ for the piece I think can be found there. The piece is also an outgrowth of Anthony’s work as an improvising pianist, and his singularly physical approach to the instrument is fully in evidence.\n\nI Diet on Cod (2007) is as elusive as it is obsessive. To my ear the piece is in five unresolved sections. It begins with a mournful, descending four-note pattern that undergoes continuous change, played first by two altos, and then, halfway through the section, by bassoon and trombone. Underneath this motive is a revolving, slow-moving, and unstable harmonic pattern supplied by the piano, accordion, and bass. This unstable harmonic motion, typical of Coleman’s music, allows the motive-obsessed upper line to be perceived in a continuously changing context. The listener tends to focus on the prominent upper register, while the lower, restlessly roaming background creates the dark resonance and tension. After around three minutes of this, the music turns precariously vertical, with thin-textured statements by the electric guitar, piano, and accordion evolving into a more sure-footed passage where the ensemble begins to function as a unified group for the first time. But not for long. A brief passage ensues with the members of the ensemble trading wailing riffs that are related to, but twice removed from, the opening motive. Then everything comes to a complete halt, there is a silence (the first in the piece);then the piano plays, salvaging the major seventh interval from the wreckage that had preceded it. The silence marks the halfway point in the piece and implies a palindromic structure that never quite materializes. The music temporarily freezes around the major seventh before making a series of attempts to reinstate the more linear music of the opening. In the end,however, we are left with only the major seventh, the last remembrance of the opening four-note motive being a passage near the end played with grotesque vibrato by both the guitar and trombone. Much is left unresolved, but that is part of the dream-like state in which this piece exists.\n\nMise en Abîme (1997—written for the Bang on a Can All-Stars) begins with a direct quotation of the beginning of the third movement of Schoenberg’s Five Pieces for Orchestra, the famous Summer Morning on a Lake. Why quote it here, and what does the music of Anthony Coleman have to do with a summer morning on a lake? I’m not sure about the latter, but Mise en Abîme has plenty to do with the Schoenberg. Both pieces are about the subtle transformation of generally quiet chords from instrument to instrument. Why not provocatively and wittily give a tip of the hat to uncle Arnold, before taking his inspiration into a completely different realm? Another aspect of this intriguing piece is, again, the use of register. The instrumentation is for three low instruments (bass clarinet, cello, and bass), plus guitar, piano, and percussion. However, the vast majority of the piece is written well above middle C. This creates a palpable tension (and high level of difficulty) in the sound world and in performance, as the instruments are constantly working against type. The use of register is quite important in Anthony’s music, but here it takes on particular significance—it becomes the essence of the piece. This is music also reminiscent of the aural delicacy of Feldman and, again, Webern, but with a subtle starkness that is entirely its own. Its pitch world is ambiguous and changing, but still with many cosmopolitan trichord references. All of this delicacy and ambiguity is given a spectacular jolt near the end, when the entire ensemble joins into a series of forte major triads that provide a rude, very funny, and effective wake-up call before drifting back into the abyss.\n\nThe final work on the program, The King of Kabay, is a fine piece of shrieking melancholy that might be the hit single on the album if we lived in a different culture. It’s accessible, riotous, and has a catchy tune. The historic inspiration for this piece seems to my ear to be the opening of Stravinsky’s Symphonies of Wind Instruments (the raw and wild original 1920version, not the California-ized 1947 version), but in this case the wailing and gnashing remain the central element of the piece. It’s also the only work on the recording that employs serious use of improvisation. The tune is fixed but the accompanying players are given a range of notes to play within each chord. The harmonic cycle is repeated three times, with each repetition becoming more expansive and energetic. The instrumentation—piano, organ, accordion, three clarinets,trombone, and percussion—is unique and perfectly suited to this music. The King also contains a B section of pure Ellingtonian elegance, about which Marty Ehrlich commented that he thought he could almost see Harry Carney, Ellington’s baritone player, sitting to his right during the recording. The piece is a fitting collaborative ending to a compact disc that presents a compelling portrait of the fully composed music of Anthony Coleman, one of the most original, literate, and versatile musicians working today.\n\nLee Hyla\n\nLee Hyla is a composer and is the Wyatt Chair of Music Composition at Northwestern University.
