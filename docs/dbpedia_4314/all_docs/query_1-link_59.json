The sound of the traffic light in the city was quite different from that of the United States and Korea. It was fun, effective, and musically intriguing. During the day, this sound was a theme song for the people in a metropolis. During the night, it became part of the flora and fauna surrounding the city.\n\nback to program\n\nKyong Mee Choi : Slight Uncertainty is Very Attractive\n\nThe attractiveness of somewhat unfocused images in photography served as the inspiration for this piece. The flute and electronics are blended in such a way that it is not always clear which is sounding. Pitch bend, airy sounds, whistle tones, and other extended techniques enhance this “fuzzy” effect.\n\nback to program\n\nGabriel Bolaños : los minisculos\n\nLos Minúsculos​ is an homage to the over 300 victims who have been killed by the Nicaraguan government since April 2018, and to all my fellow Nicaraguans who have suffered under Daniel Ortega’s regime. The first lady and vice president disparagingly calls protesters \"minúsculos grupos alentadores del odio” (miniscule groups inciting hatred). As a reaction, hundreds of thousands of self-proclaimed minúsculos have repeatedly taken to the streets in protest, demanding justice for the victims of oppression. This piece, for bassoon and electronics, was written in close collaboration with Dana Jessen and performed at SPLICE institute. It is an examination of collective movement and growth, a study on how multiple small things can converge, grow and develop into a larger, cohesive, even uncontrollable whole. Many thanks to Dana for the brilliant performance and a fruitful collaboration, and to SPLICE institute.\n\nback to program\n\nBecky Brown: Etude\n\nAs per the title, this piece is meant to be performed by its engineer, and to a lesser degree by anyone else who may happen to be in the space concurrently. Maintain attention on everything you can: the room, its walls, the speakers, the cables, the stage, your neighbors, your body, the air. You may find this difficult, as many parts of \"everything\" will attempt to become forgettable.\n\nback to program\n\nJoo Won Park: Large Intestine\n\nIn no-input mixing, a performer controls an audio mixer by creating and manipulating a feedback loop without an external sound source. With proper patching and some practice, a no-input mixer becomes a powerful and expressive electronic instrument. Large Intestine uses the said instrument to narrate the following story: I am a taco on a journey in a man’s digestive system, and this is what I heard inside the bowel.\n\nback to program\n\nKyong Mee Choi : too bright to see\n\ntoo bright to see is based on theme of Gustav Mahler's \"Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen\" whose poem was written by Friedrich Rückert.\n\nI am lost to the world\n\nwith which I used to waste so much time,\n\nIt has heard nothing from me for so long\n\nthat it may very well believe that I am dead!\n\nIt is of no consequence to me\n\nwhether it thinks me dead;\n\nI cannot deny it,\n\nfor I really am dead to the world.\n\nI am dead to the world's tumult,\n\nAnd I rest in a quiet realm!\n\nI live alone in my heaven,\n\nIn my love and in my song.\n\nback to program\n\nBios\n\nGabriel José Bolaños (b. 1984 Bogotá, Colombia) is a Nicaraguan-American composer of solo, chamber, orchestral and electroacoustic music.

As a performer of chamber music with Wet Ink and other groups, in addition to his own works, Sam has performed and premiered works by Peter Ablinger, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Katharina Rosenberger, George Lewis, Ben Hackbarth, Alvin Lucier, Chiyoko Szlavnics, Alex Mincek, Kate Soper, and Eric Wubbels among others.\n\nAs an improviser, Sam has collaborated with some of the finest creative musicians in the world, including Peter Evans, Evan Parker, Ikue Mori, Craig Taborn, Ingrid Laubrock, Anne La Berge, and George Lewis. Sam is a member of multiple improvisation-based ensembles, the jazz influenced Peter Evans Ensemble, the free improvisation-based Rocket Science (with Evan Parker, Craig Taborn and Peter Evans), the analog synth and laptop duo exclusiveOr (with Jeff Snyder), and his longstanding duo with Peter Evans. Sam has also performed with the Evan Parker Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. With these various groups he has toured Europe and America and performed at major festivals and venues, such as the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, the Moers and Donaueshingen Festivals in Germany, Bimhuis in Amsterdam, and The Vortex in London.\n\nDr Pluta studied composition and electronic music at Columbia University, where he received his DMA in 2012.

The electronic part of the piece involves water sounds that are associated with the composer's name and the plainsong that she wrote for her husband. The piece attempts to reflect the balance between lighthearted nature and the depth of connection, which the couple appreciates throughout their life together. \"Du\" also has a special meaning to the composer in that Du is the word that her parents who were German literature scholars used to call each other.\n\nback to program\n\nElainie Lillios : Immeasurable Distance\n\nImmeasurable Distance was composed in memory of my percussion colleague Roger Schupp. Roger asked me to write a piece for him but passed away before the piece could be brought to fruition. My sincere appreciation and thanks to Scott Deal, who agreed to join me to imagine and complete the journey of this piece. While Immeasurable Distance was initially composed as a tribute to Roger, I think it has become a piece about the immeasurable distance that can exist between any of us.\n\nback to program\n\nSam Pluta : points against fields\n\nPoints Against Fields (tombeau de Bernard Parmegiani) is a collaboration in the truest sense of the word, and is based on improvisations with Dana Jessen. The electronics part is comprised mostly of components created in our improvisations. The bassoon part embraces Dana's skills as both a performer of notated works and as an improviser. Points Against Fields is dedicated to Bernard Parmegiani, one of the great composers of the twentieth century, who died at the end of 2013. The end of the piece is a direct quote of the end of Parmegiani's 1974 masterwork de natura sonorum.\n\n- Sam Pluta\n\nback to program\n\nChristopher Biggs : We All Fall In\n\nwe will all fall in was written for and is dedicated to Scott Deal. The work draws on imagery from Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder’s graphic novel “A.D. After Death.” A scene in the graphic novel paints a picture of a family playing on a frozen lake and the juxtaposition between the family’s experience of joy and freezing water below the ice. “...part of you refuses to ignore what’s beneath, to ignore the fact that at some point...the ice will give way to the cold, black water below it. And, one by one, your friends, your family, and you, will all fall in.”\n\nFor me, this scene evoked the feeling that I often have right now: all the joy and beauty created by humans is at risk because of climate stability. That feeling and dread for humanity’s future colors all the creative, beautiful, and empathetic acts I witness. Without rapid and dramatic action we will all fall in.\n\nback to program\n\nPer Bloland: Los murmullos\n\nLos murmullos is based on a highly influential yet little known (at least in the US) novel from the 1950s: Pedro Páramo, by the Mexican author Juan Rulfo. It is the surreal tale of a man’s return to the town in which his parents lived, long after that town has fallen into decay. Comala is now more heavily populated by the dead than the living, and exists in a blurred twilight realm in which such distinctions are meaningless. The descriptions of the environment are exceptionally vivid, often invoking the four elements to transition between the past and the present, and between the living and the dead. Sound is particularly important to the narrative. The original title of the novel was in fact Los murmullos, a reflection of the murmuring and whispering of the dead heard at various points throughout. Contrary to the gentle implications of the word, it is the intensity of these murmurs that overwhelms and suffocates the protagonist just over half way through the narrative.\n\nMy composition, for piano and electronics, shifts between four recurring material types, each inspired by one of the above-mentioned elements as described in the book. The electronics for this piece were generated using a physical model of the Electro-Magnetically Prepared Piano – a device consisting of a rack of twelve electromagnets that can be installed on the frame of any grand piano. The EMPP is somewhat like an EBow in that the electromagnets cause the strings to vibrate. However, because the electromagnets receive audio signals from a computer, there is a much higher degree sonic variability. The physical model of this device, called the Induction Connection, was developed during an Artistic Research Residency at IRCAM in Paris. The Induction Connection is currently built into IRCAM’s software Modalys.\n\nThe short version of this piece, Los murmullitos, has been around for a while, and performed many times by Keith Kirchoff, for whom it was written. I’m thrilled to finally get the full version out there, and even more so to hear Keith work his magic on it. I believe this confirms that he is indeed an alien. At the outset he’d asked for something with a bit of noise – hopefully this does the trick.\n\nLos murmullos is dedicated to Keith Kirchoff (obviously).\n\nback to program\n\nBios\n\nChristopher Biggs is a composer, electronic music performer, and multimedia artist residing in Kalamazoo, MI, where he is Associate Professor of Music Composition and Technology at Western Michigan University.

Mellon Foundation.\n\nNotes\n\nDan VanHassel : Camouflage\n\nCamouflage is a work for piano with interactive live electronics. All of the electronics are built from sounds sampled in real-time from the piano. In the first section of the work, the computer responds to the sharp attacks of the piano with colorful rhythmic patterns built from the very sound that triggered the pattern. In this way the music has a regular pulsing rhythm, without resorting to continuous sequenced patterns. The electronics act as an extension of the instrument, creating a hybrid entity in which both elements are necessary for the music to make sense. As the piece progresses, the underlying harmonic progression gradually becomes more prominent, enhanced by sustaining electronics, creating blurry impressionistic washes of color. As the piano moves increasingly towards an ecstatic outburst of romanticism the electronics respond by becoming increasingly noisy and aggressive.\n\nback to program\n\nScott L. Miller : Katabasis III\n\nIn my electroacoustic music, I am fond of manipulating recordings using granular synthesis in a way not originally intended. The original concept of granular synthesis involves \"clouds\" of sound \"grains,\" each grain only milliseconds in duration. I use grains of tens of seconds in duration, reading through samples of acoustic instruments performing melodic lines. Multiple streams of grains overlap and can be thought of as windows slowly moving along a melodic line, the musical material in each window looping back on itself, gradually progressing along the melodic path. The speed and size and direction of each window is different, producing a unique kind of polyphony based on a single melodic line. These studies work out a purely instrumental realization of this synthesis approach, without computer processing.\n\nback to program\n\nCaroline Miller : Antiphony\n\nAntiphony is a revision of the first movement of Ansible which was composed for the SPLICE Ensemble and is dedicated to the memory of Ursula K. Le Guin.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin coined the term “Ansible” in her 1966 science fiction novel Rocannon’s world. The Ansible is a device that enables instantaneous interstellar communication, alleviating the significant time lag between the transmission and receipt of messages that could previously only travel at the speed of light. In Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle, a loosely connected group of sci-fi novels that take part within the same universe, the Ansible is sometimes present and sometimes absent – for a variety of reasons, economic, political, or because it hasn’t been invented yet. In circumstances where the Ansible is absent, communication between entities is often frustrated or inflected by vast distances of time and space, causing interstellar political troubles as messages received 50 or 100 years later lose their relevance. The Ansible, an open-source, open-science communications device invented by an Anarchist physicist, is conceived by Le Guin as having utopian potentials, enabling a peaceful interstellar coalition called the Ekumen. In spite of its Utopian potential, its presence produces conflict as well, a rich metaphor for globalization. Struggles are waged for control of the Ansible technology itself, by entities who wish to capitalize on exclusive rights to its use. The rapid exchange of information across galaxies also interacts in unpredictable ways with different societies, in the very worst circumstances causing a technocracy (see The Telling).\n\nAntiphony is a meditation on pre-ansible communication, as messages from almost a century ago (conveyed by classical music recordings from the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s) finally are received in a not-so-distant future. Keith responds by playing extrapolations on these old tunes on a decaying piano. These old recordings, first heard in Antiphony, are carried throughout the other three movements; snippets placed in a variety of contexts – borne on the wind from a distant house maybe, or heard broadcast over the radio. The theme of embedding the same information in a multitude of spatial and temporal contexts carries throughout the rest of the piece.\n\nback to program\n\nChristopher Biggs : Decoherence\n\nDecoherence is dedicated to Samuel Wells and was commissioned by a consortium consisting of Samuel Wells, Aaron Hodgson, Scott Thornburg, and the UMKC Trumpet Studio. The work abstractly reflects on a phenomenon in quantum physics and a possible explanation for the phenomenon.\n\nDecoherence is a phenomenon whereby particles that have probable locations always take on a specific location when observed by a human. This is represented through the presentations of hundreds of possible ways to a play a single pitch on the trumpet followed by the performer’s decision to play the pitch in a specific manner. Also, when the performer is making a decision about what to play, he or she becomes part of the video. One possible explanation for how probable locations collapse into a specific location is that all probable locations come to exist in their own parallel universe upon observation. As the work progresses the trumpet player has less and less freedom as the specific universe he or she inhabits is increasingly defined by past decisions.\n\nback to program\n\nPaula Matthusen : Performing Artifacts\n\nThe woven together fragments presented here represent a small selection of an extended project which is the outgrowth of over a decade long period of research and conversation with Mammoth Cave, its history, and the many people connected to it. This specific set of compositions marks the return of the SPLICE Ensemble (Keith Kirchoff, Adam Vidiksis, Sam Wells) and Jennifer Beattie to Mammoth Cave following a recording session originally completed in 2019. Hopefully this will be followed by yet other opportunities to interact with the cave and its numerous complexities.\n\nWe have conducted this creative research through the gracious support of Mammoth Cave National Park, and owe special gratitude to Rick Toomey, Brice Leech, Janet Bass Smith, and Jerry Bransford, whose hands, conversations, and research (if not literally their voices) make appearances in this collection.

Miller is an American composer best known for his electroacoustic chamber music and ecosystemic performance pieces. His music is characterized by collaborative approaches to composition and the use of electronics, exploring performer/computer improvisation and re-imagining ancient compositional processes through the lens of 21st century technology. Inspired by the inner-workings of sound and the microscopic in the natural and mechanical worlds, his music is the product of hands-on experimentation and collaboration with musicians and performers from across the spectrum of styles. His recent work experiments with VR applications in live concerts, first realized in his composition Raba, created for Tallinn-based Ensemble U:.\n\nMiller’s ecosystemic works model the behavior of objects from the natural world in electronic sound, creating interactive sonic ecosystems. Ecosystemic pieces are the result of autonomous sounds competing with each other for sonic space. Individual sounds tend to find a balance, which can be upset by changes to the sonic landscape, such as the introduction of new sounds. Because of this, sonic ecosystems are intimately tied to the space they are presented in. With or without humans, repeat performances produce unique results each time—sometimes subtle, sometimes drastic—while maintaining a recognizable identity. Recordings of his music are available on New Focus Recordings, Innova, Ein Klang, and other labels; many of these recordings feature his long-time collaborators, the new music ensemble Zeitgeist (whose albums he also produces). His music is published by the American Composers Edition, Tetractys, and Jeanné. His most recent albums include COINCIDENT (FCR337), Havona (#SR002), Lab Rat (ekr 070).\n\nMiller is a Professor of Music at St. Cloud State University, Minnesota, where he teaches composition, electroacoustic music and theory. He is Past-President (2014—18) of the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the U.S. (SEAMUS) and presently Director of SEAMUS Records. He holds degrees from The University of Minnesota, The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and the State University of New York at Oneonta, and studied composition at the Czech-American Summer Music Institute and the Centre de Création Musicale Iannis Xenakis.\n\nMiller has been named a McKnight Composer Fellow three times (2001, 2013, 2018), a Fulbright Scholar (2014—15), and his work has been recognized by numerous state, national, and international arts organizations. He has been the featured artist at several festivals, including the Chicago Electro-Acoustic Music Festival, the Lipa Festival, and the Estonian Academy of Music’s Autumn Festival, Sügisfest.\n\nback to program\n\nCaroline Louise Miller (they/them) is a US composer based in Portland, Oregon.

A simple chord progression reoccurs throughout the piece, first as a deconstructed and sparse piano texture, and later as fully stated straight forward chords, and outlined melodies in the trumpet. As the texture and energy of the piece increases, the overarching themes of the piece persist with repeating and hypnotic rhythmic textures, simple tonal melodies, and sustained tones that are transformed and given life by the live electronics, adding interest and complexity to simple beauty. Within the piece, each instrument has a moment to stand on its own, giving each performer a chance to show their own vulnerability through exposed improvisations.\n\nThe final moments of the piece brings the instruments together for a pop/dance music inspired celebration of the simple elements presented throughout the earlier sections, showing the versatility and beauty of simple ideas.\n\nback to program\n\nShahrzad Talebi : Eternal Embrace of the Sea\n\nEternal Embrace of the Sea is written for the Splice ensemble, inspired by the poem “Quietness” by Rumi. The poem centers around spiritual awakening and rebirth, representing the act of killing one's ego and breaking free from the prison of thought. The music is expressing this idea by creating an eerie, soft yet intense atmosphere that is periodically disrupted by sudden loud attacks. As the piece progresses, these sudden attacks occur more frequently, eventually becoming the defining texture and character of the music.\n\nInside this new love, die.\n\nYour way begins on the other side.\n\nBecome the sky.\n\nTake an axe to the prison wall. Escape.\n\nWalk out like someone suddenly born into color.\n\nDo it now.\n\nYou’re covered with a thick cloud.\n\nSlide out the side. Die,\n\nand be quiet. Quietness is the surest sign\n\nthat you’ve died.\n\nYour old life was a frantic running\n\nfrom silence.\n\nThe speechless full moon\n\ncomes out now.\n\n“Quietness” by Rumi\n\nback to program\n\nTed Moore : nand\n\nElectrons oscillating high and low, edgy square waves that turn on and off different tones, noise, oscillating with silence, in turn turning off and on themselves. A complex system creating simple sounds (repeating phrases consisting of square waves, filtered noise, and silence), each gesture has microvariations, just enough entropy to keep me listening for the next squealy tone.\n\nback to program Zouning (Anne) Liao : Rupturing Signals\n\nTThe inspiration for this composition project is to explore the electromagnetic signals that surround us but are not audible in everyday life. Humans emit electromagnetic radiation when making decisions or engaging in activities like driving or choosing what to wear. These brainwave activities alter the electromagnetic field (EMF) signals. I find it fascinating that these physical EMF signals can be transformed and amplified into audio signals, allowing us to hear the sonic differences between devices like laptops and iPhones.\n\nTo prepare for this project, I used electromagnetic sensors to detect various gadgets that emit EMF. These sensors convert the magnetic signals into audio signals. I am fascinated by the diverse musical qualities present in these recordings. Some have strong rhythmic grooves, while others have distinct and persistent frequency content. However, these signals are fragile and unstable, depending on the position of the sensors. Even a slight movement of the sensor can significantly weaken the audio signal or completely change the sound. Sometimes, moving the sensors closer to the source can trigger a dangerously loud boom, followed by a signal break.\n\nIn Rupturing Signals, the ensemble and electronics collaborate to recreate different rhythmic and frequency patterns of the EMF. This composition aims to highlight the unstable, ever-changing, and instantly breaking characteristics of the recorded audio signals.\n\nback to program\n\nBella Rose Kelly and Ziaire Trinidad Sherman : Yield\n\nYield was written about a character's relationship with a singular moment. They relive and rewrite what happened trying to justify their actions. This ultimately leads to them being stuck in a feedback loop, unable to break out. Through microtonal interactions and contrasting electronics, reality begins to tear leaving the character where they started. By the end, there is no time for them to stop or start down a new path; All they can do is yield.\n\nback to program\n\nBios\n\nSPLICE Ensemble is a trumpet, piano, and percussion trio focused on cultivating a canon of electroacoustic chamber music.

It features a versatile scratch delay and a powerful live graphic sound processing environment. Collaborative creation lies at the core of the Spectral DJ Duo. By design, the Spectral DJ instrument restores the art of listening as the most important of musical skills. When combined with Will Yager’s double bass, the possibilities include not only live synthesis and processing, but also counterpoint between the instruments and combining to form a fused sonic entity.\n\nback to program Marcea McGuire : Body\n\nBody explores the effects of generational trauma. Black women have been subjected to alarming rates of sexual violence for generations. The cycle of silent suffering has only just begun to change with the #MeToo movement. This piece illustrates the impact of sexual assault on one’s self image and interactions within their community.\n\nback to program Nina Shekhar : Honk if You Love Me\n\nIn any large city, the sound of car horns riddles every street. But whenever I visit a city in India, the level of this traffic-filled soundscape is taken to an extreme, with a constant barrage of wild, animated, and exuberant car horns and songs like “Happy Birthday” which play every time a car is put into reverse. These unique horns almost sound too melodic and friendly to be recognized as traffic noises elsewhere, and hence they are used differently when driving – rather than honking out of anger, they are used to communicate to other drivers and make each car’s presence known, almost as a form of self-expression. In many ways, these drivers are reclaiming technology and using it to communicate – the most human and individual act possible. In essence, this piece Honk If You Love Me is a meta-version of this phenomenon, using electronics to disintegrate these traffic sounds and recontextualize them into something deeply personal and human.\n\nback to program Leah Reid : Jouer\n\nJouer is an immersive composition for amplified soprano saxophone and electronics that explores sounds associated with “play”—sports, balls bouncing or being hit, playground and amusement park sounds, sounds of various children’s toys, balloons, video games, swimming pool games, trampolines, casinos, racetrack sounds, and much more. The electronics lead the listener through various soundscapes associated with the theme, while the saxophone part interacts with the evolving timbres and unifies the various sound worlds.\n\nThe composition was written as part of Reid’s Guggenheim Fellowship for Kyle Hutchins and the Cube at Virginia Tech.\n\nback to program\n\nElliott Lupp : a warp along the length of the face\n\nThis piece was written for and in collaboration with double bassist and friend Will Yager over a two year period. The work uses a series of cue like notational ‘guides’ (provided in real time via laptop) to instruct the performer through a series of physical, semi-improvisatory performative instructions. These moments rely heavily on the performer’s ability to listen, watch, and move between each moment with well-timed procession and musicality, while also allowing the performer a good amount of agency to explore sonic/performative possibilities from cell to cell. The electronics, both live and fixed, are all synthesized from sounds of wood (a majority of which came from Will’s own double bass). The title comes from the idea that if a plank of wood is said to be 'bowed’, it is said to have a warp along the length of its face.\n\nback to program Wenxin Li : Wu\n\nWu is a live electronics piece working with motion detection in Max/MSP. It tracks the performer’s body movements with a camera and translates those movements to control commands for playing and mixing pre-recorded sounds. Wu (舞) in Chinese means dance. Normally dance comes after music. However, in this piece, dance creates the music.\n\nback to program Badie Khaleghian : Before I Became Aware Of This Moving Of Life\n\nBefore I Became Aware Of This Moving Of Life is a work that celebrates the spontaneity and power of improvisation, brought to life by the incredible talent of saxophonist Wilson Poffenberger. This piece was conceived during a close collaboration between Wilson and myself, and it had its world premiere at the Splice Institute 2022 in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nThe initial creative spark for the piece came when Wilson mentioned his passion for improvisation during brainstorming sessions with me. This mutual love for organic sonic processes provided the perfect foundation for a work that explores the limits of expression and freedom within a structured environment.\n\nThe piece itself is divided into several sections, each offering a unique space for Wilson to showcase his virtuosity and emotional depth. Each section presents a different sonic landscape, built upon a foundation of my guidelines and Wilson's creative input. The result is an ever-evolving dialogue between the saxophonist and the music as they together traverse the ephemeral landscapes that unfold before them.\n\nback to program\n\nBios\n\nWill Yager is a double bassist committed to experimental music, improvisation, and collaborating with other artists in the creation of new solo and chamber repertoire for the double bass.
