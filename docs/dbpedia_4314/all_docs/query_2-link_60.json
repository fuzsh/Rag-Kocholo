        "text": "One of the most prolific recording artists of all time (not necessarily a compliment), New York-based alto saxophonist John Zorn (1953) has certainly been very active. His gargantuan discography contains many ridiculous albums, released only because the cost of manufacturing CDs collapsed during the 1990s, but also a few important works that helped redefine the avantgarde at the turn of the century.\n\nJohn Zorn (1953) studied composition in New York but conducted his first experiments in improvisation when he lived in St. Louis, where he met Joseph Bowie and other promising African-American musicians. Zorn, however, was already influenced by a variety of musical sources, both classical and jazz and even by cartoon soundtracks.\n\nJohn Zorn emerged from the milieu of the solo creative improvisers, but his concept of \"improvisation\" was more closely related to John Cage's aleatory music than to Ornette Coleman's free-jazz. Game-pieces such as Lacrosse (first recorded in june 1977 with soprano saxophonist Bruce Ackley and guitarists Eugene Chadbourne. and Henry Kaiser plus electronics, violin, viola, dobro, banjo, clarinet), three versions of which are documented on the double-LP School (Parachute, 1978 - Tzadik, 1997), Hockey (composed in 1978 but first recorded in march 1980 by Chadbourne, keyboardist Wayne Horvitz and electronic musician Bob Ostertag), Archery (composed in 1979 but first recorded in september 1981 with flutist Robert Dick, trombonist George Lewis, keyboardists Mark Kramer, Anthony Coleman and Wayne Horvitz, guitarists Chadbourne and Bill Horvitz, bassist Bill Laswell, violinist Polly Bradfield, cellist Tom Cora, drummer David Moss), and Pool (also composed in 1979, with a 51-minute performance recorded in march 1980 with violinist Polly Bradfield, vibraphonist Mark Miller, percussionist Charles Noyes, Ostertag and trumpeter Lesli Dalaba) were partially structured improvisations that defined rules within which a cast of improvisers could improvise (improvisation being bound more by mathematical than emotional constraints, a` la Anthony Braxton). True to Cage's indeterminate aesthetics, Zorn composed uncomposed music and conducted unrepeatable performances. Zorn played indifferently alto or soprano saxophones and clarinets. But instrumental style was definitely not what his musical \"games\" were about.\n\nZorn embraced the aesthetic of the new wave and of punk-rock with the hysterical and laconic fragments of Locus Solus (september 1983), that employed both jazz musicians (keyboardist Wayne Horvitz) and rock musicians (including DNA's guitarist Arto Lindsay, the Golden Palominos' drummer Anton Fier, DNA's drummer Ikue Mori) plus turntablists (notably Christian Marclay). This time his own demented saxophone playing stood out as a major and shocking stylitic innovation, sometimes mocking animals and sometimes imitating synthesizers. The album is flooded by spoken-word, vocal samples and nasty vocal noises. The overall feeling is one of juvenile parody or irreverent cabaret. Zorn's noises are particularly stunning in pieces like A Case Arose and The Elf, well complemented by Marclay's warped samples, to the point that one barely notices Peter Blegvad's (obnoxious) spoken vocals. The cartoonish frenzy of Honey-Cab virtually invented a new genre, at the intersection of sloppy punk spirit and comical Zappa-esque iconoclasm. Bass And The Treble (digital collage, musique concrete and dadaistic noise) The Acquisition & Control Of Fire (samples and free-form electronic music) Juan Talks It Out Of His System (for gurgling mouth, animal zoo and exotic strumming) flow next to the rare \"musical\" skits like Switch (a deformed folk lullaby) and Getting Curly (a cacophonous no-wave jam). The latter begins a duel between Zorn's ear-splitting horns and Lindsay's atonal guitar that peaks around Add Water and Cold. with a notably hysterical detour in the brief Friar T and an agonizing nervous breakdown in Moi Non Plus. By comparison, the third (all-instrumental) part (the pieces from 23 to 30), with Horvitz on futuristic electronics and Mori on tribal percussion is \"sophisticated\", starting with the cryptic and sinister Heike Cipher Mystery and peaking with the manic equatorial wardance of When Arrows Meet via the jazzy and suspenseful Mysterious Island. Another genre emerged from You Only Live Twice Mr Bond, a wildly unorthodox deconstruction of a movie soundtrack. The last eight pieces feature hip-hop dj Whiz Kid and drummer Mark MIller, a collaboration that yields barbaric albeit reluctant raids like Where Are My Victims and The Slaves Of Vesuvius, and especially the orgiastic Kaiser In Borneo and White Zombie, as well as the warzone explosions of The Violent Death Of Dutch Schultz.\n\nHot on the heels of the large-scale game piece Track And Field (1982), Cobra (october 1985), a game piece originally conceived in 1984, marked another zenith of Zorn's chaotic and abrasive vision, a dadaistic symphony structured in twenty classical movements that, despite the pretentious premises, was the musical equivalent of a Marx Brothers' slapstick. The studio version featured Jim Staley on trombone, Carol Emanuel and Zeena Parkins on harps, Bill Frisell Elliott Sharp and Arto Lindsay on guitars, Anthony Coleman and Wayne Horvitz on organ, piano, harpsichord and celeste, David Weinstein on sampling keyboards, Guy Klucevsek on accordion, Bob James on tapes, Christian Marclay on turntables, Bobby Previte on percussion. Vestiges of popular music, from Jimi Hendrix's glissandos to cajun accordion, kept surfacing with frantic exuberance from the shroud of random dissonace, perhaps a metaphor for the post-modernist conflict between nostalgia and futurism, amid a concrete collage of power-drills and electronic oscillations, jackhammer rhythms and expressionist overtones.\n\nThe cassette The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms (1984), whose title is taken from a 1953 science-fiction movie, was a collaboration with Eugene Chadbourne. that also included Toshinori Kondo and Steve Beresford.\n\nXu Feng (composed in 1985, recorded in may 2000 by guitarists Fred Frith and John Schott, electronic musicians Chris Brown and David Slusser, percussionist William Winant and Slayer's drummer Dave Lombardo) closed the \"infinite series\" of game pieces (games in which the participants contribute to keep the game alive) and opened a new series, in which Zorn tried to recreate an environment via sound (in this case, kung-fu martial arts).\n\nA number of hyper-kinetic collages of subcultural genres such as The Bribe (1986) for small orchestra (with Marty Ehrlich on saxophones and bass clarinet, Jim Staley on trombone, Zeena Parkins and Carol Emanuel on harps, Robert Quine on guitar, Anthony Coleman and Wayne Horvitz on keyboards, Christian Marclay on turntables, David Hofstra on bass, Bobby Previte on percussion, Ikue Mori on drum machines) and Spillane (june 1986), off Godard Spillane, a melodic fantasia for almost the same ensemble (minus Ehrlich, Parkins, Horvitz, Marclay, Mori but with Frisell, Bob James on tapes and David Weinstein on sampling keyboards) that paid homage to the atmospheres of film noir, announced the new Zorn: the post-modernist (or, better, cubist) artist who \"quoted\", deconstructed and reconstructed musical stereotypes while injecting the cacophony, frenzy and violence of the 20th century. Zorn quickly established himself as the ultimate post-modernist (or, better, cubist) artist, capable of revising established canons in ways that bordered on blasphemy.\n\nThat artist moved closer to the world of rock music with Naked City (1989), a venture with rock guitarists Bill Frisell and Fred Frith, Boredoms's psychotic vocalist Yamatsuka Eye, keyboardist Wayne Horvitz and drummer Joey Baron offering brief bursts of irreverent jazz-surf-punk fusion music that referenced a broad spectrum of musical stereotypes, albeit drenched in urban neurosis. Zorn's works now fully revealed the influnce of the epileptic discontinuity of Carl Stalling's cartoon soundtracks, literally applied on Cynical Hysterie Hour (october 1988), one of his most ambitious attempts at deconstructing the western musical civilization. Even more uncompromising, Naked City's Torture Garden (1990) and Heretic (1991), without Laswell and with Frith on bass, were whirlwinds of recombinant pieces that applied John Cage to atonal improvisation. The two Painkiller albums (for a \"jazzcore\" trio with bassist Bill Laswell and Napalm Death's drummer Mick Harris), The Guts Of A Virgin (april 1991) and especially Buried Secrets (october 1991), were kaleidoscopic frescoes of unfulfilled semiotic events. Zorn's music was of abrupts shifts of style (whether within the same song or from one song to the next) was the equivalent of turning the tuning dial of a radio.\n\nRadio Hour (1991) contains two lengthy suites that are basically Zorn's musical autobiography: he talks and plays records of his main influences.\n\nZorn was also active as a composer of chamber music, as proven by For Your Eyes Only (1989), another Carl Stalling-style score, and Elegy (november 1991), a four-movement tribute to French writer Jean Genet scored for flute, viola, guitar, turntables, percussion and voice. Zorn's combinatorial exercises and cut-up techniques were in fact better pursued in his chamber music, which yielded large-scale works such as Kristallnacht (november 1992), for a Jewish ensemble (Mark Feldman on violin, Marc Ribot on guitar, Anthony Coleman on keyboards, Mark Dresser on bass, William Winant on percussion, David Krakauer on clarinet), Redbird (1995) for string trio (Carol Emanuel on harp, Jill Jaffe on viola, Erik Friedlander on cello), Aporias (1998) for piano and orchestra, and Chimeras (january 2003) for the same ensemble (voice and twelve instruments) as Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, as well as the wind octet Angelus Novus (1993) and several string quartets: Cat o' Nine Tails (1988), The Dead Man (1990), Memento Mori (1992), Kol Nidre (1996), Necronomicon (2003). Some of them betrayed the influence of Morton Feldman's latter-day chamber music.\n\nAfter Naked City's Radio (april 1993), another (and perhaps the ultimate) exercise in quotation and collage at manic speed, Painkiller's double-disc Execution Ground (june 1994) dominated by the ambient-dub aesthetic of Laswell and Harris, Zorn (disguised under silly monikers) concocted two noise-fests with Yamatsuka Eye: Nani Nani (march 1995) and Mystic Fugu Orchestra's Zohar (Tzadik, 1995).\n\nIn one of his typical turnarounds, Zorn also formed Masada, a more traditional jazz quartet (trumpeter Dave Douglas, bassist Greg Cohen and drummer Joey Baron) with an emphasis on klezmer melody, to explore the same vision of Kristallnacht, i.e. Jewish history, over the course of ten albums, titled after the first ten letters of the Hebrew alphabet, from Alef (february 1994) to Yod (september 1997), with an artistic peak in Hei (july 1995). Masada's music was also re-arranged first for chamber ensemble on Bar Kokhba (march 1996) and The Circle Maker (december 1997), and then for guitar only (Bill Frisell, Tim Sparks, Marc Ribot) on Masada Guitars (2003). Masada-style klezmer jazz also surfaced on some of his movie soundtracks, notably The Port of Last Resort (november 1997), scored for jazz sextet (Feldman, Friedlander, bassist Greg Cohen, guitarist Marc Ribot, pianist Anthony Coleman and pipa virtuoso Min Xiao Fen).\n\nAn endless series of albums titled Filmworks collected Zorn's monumental (quantity-wise) output for the cinema. Mostly mediocre, his soundtracks recycled all sorts of disparate ideas from jazz, rock, avantgarde music and cartoon music. For example: She Must Be Seeing Things (1986), with Staley, Frisell, Emanuel, Coleman, Horvitz, Weinstein, Previte, Hofstra, Nana Vasconcelos on percussion, Shelley Hirsch on vocals, Marty Ehrlich on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Tom Varner on French horn; The Golden Boat (1990), with Coleman, Quine, Emanuel, Dresser, Previte, Vicki Bodner on oboe, David Shea on turntable, Cyro Baptista on percussion; The Thieves Quartet (1993), that debuted the Masada line-up of Zorn, Douglas, Cohen and Baron; A Lot of Fun for the Evil One (released in 1997), a computer collage of musical samples; Tears Of Ecstasy (october 1995), 48 one-minute fetishes of popular music performed by guitarists Robert Quine and Marc Ribot and percussionist Cyro Baptista; Trembling Before G-d (released in 2000), his first feature-length soundtrack, scored only for clarinet (Chris Speed), organ (James Saft) and percussion (Baptista); In the Mirror of Maya Deren (2001), one of the most romantic, with tender cello (Friedlander) and piano (Zorn and Saft) counterpoint and exotic overtones (Baptista); Secret Lives (2002) for string trio (Cohen, Feldman, Friedlander), one of his simplest compositions; Invitation to a Suicide (june 2002), perhaps the best one, performed by Ribot, Freidlander, Tin Hat Trio's accordionist Rob Burger, rock bassist Trevor Dunn and percussionist Kenny Wollesen; Hiding and Seeking (april 2003), a virtually Jewish fantasia for classical guitar (Ribot), vibraphone (Wollesen), Brazilian percussion (Baptista), acoustic bass (Dunn) and voice (Ganda Suthivarakom); Protocols of Zion (october 2004) for an ethnic trio (Zorn himself on piano, Baptista and bassist Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz); the electronic Workingman's Death (2005) for Saft, Zorn, Ikue Mori (all on keyboards), Blumenkranz and Baptista; Notes on Marie Menken (2005) for a free-jazz trio (Zorn on alto, Blumenkranz and Wollesen) plus guitarist Jon Madof; the exotic The Treatment (2005) for Latin-jazz quartet (Feldman, Burger, Blumenkranz and Wollesen).\n\nZorn's main contribution to the history of music was the invention of an anti-jazz style, a frantic and chaotic hodgepodge of cartoon music, chamber music, punk-rock and sheer dissonance grafted onto the body of improvised music. The sense of an agonizing civilization radiated from his multi-faceted musical neurosis.\n\nA long-time fan of cartoon music, Zorn also wrote and arranged the soundtrack for the cartoon show Cynical Hysterie Hour (october 1988 - CBS, 1989), later reissued as Filmworks VII (Tzadik, 1996). Far from being a mere detour in his career, this was one of his most ambitious attempts at deconstructing the western musical civilization. An impressive number of instruments (banjo, harp, turntables, percussion, violin, viola, cello, guitars and keyboards) and musicians (Frisell, Emanuel, Horvitz:, Previte, Marclay, Mori, Hofstra, Lindsay, Quine, Mark Ribot, Peter Scherer, etc).\n\nNaked City's mini-album Torture Garden (Shimmy Disc, 1990) added the Boredoms's vocalist Yamatsuka Eye to the original quintet, and the result was quite devastating: 42 miniatures of psychotic hardcore that last one minute or less (one lasting only eight seconds). The vomiting vocals tend to dominate the atmosphere. The music finds a bit of orgasmic coherence in pieces like Sack of Shit, Trash Jazz Assassin and Osaka Bondage, but mostly this is just Zorn blowing his head off and Eye shrieking from hell. A bit more skilled is Speedfreak, a one-minute collage of a dozen different styles. In the middle of the apocalypse one can nonetheless enjoy an intermezzo of country & western music (Flat Top Box) as well as a cartoonish deconstruction of that genre (The Prestigitator).\n\nFilm Works (Wave, 1991) collects music for films composed between 1986 and 1990: 1986's mediocre White And Lazy (with Quine, Lindsay, Gibbs, Fier, Emanuel, Weinstein, and Ned Rothenberg on bass clarinet); 1990's brilliant The Golden Boat (with Coleman, Quine, Emanuel, Dresser, Previte, Vicki Bodner on oboe, David Shea on turntable, Cyro Baptista on percussion); and 1986's evocative She Must Be Seeing Things (with Staley, Frisell, Emanuel, Coleman, Horvitz, Weinstein, Previte, Hofstra, Nana Vasconcelos on percussion, Shelley Hirsch on vocals, Marty Ehrlich on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Tom Varner on French horn). This was the beginning of an endless series of \"film works\", most of them inspired by Carl Stalling's cartoon soundtracks.\n\nIncreasing his proximity to rock and punk music, Zorn also formed Painkiller with bassist Bill Laswell and drummer Mick Harris, and released The Guts Of A Virgin (Earache, 1991).\n\nTracks: Scud Attack, Deadly Obstacle Collage, Damage To The Mask, Guts Of A Virgin, Handjob, Portent, Hostage, Lathe Of God, Dr. Phibes, Purgatory Of Fiery Vulvas, Warhead, Devil's Eye.\n\nPainkiller's brief Buried Secrets (Earache, 1992) is a powerful psychological experience. In Tortured Souls the saxophone truly sounds like the screaming of a tortured soul. Grindcore drumming pummels One-Eyed Pessary, but here the saxophone exudes titanic passion rather than mere grief. Trailmarker is three seconds of noise and The Ladder is 22 seconds of punk-rock. The Blackhole Dub ventures beyond the usual dreamy atmospheres of dub with waves of saxophone squeals. Even more adventurous is the other dub number, Black Chamber, that is also the most jazz moment on the album. One of the highlights is the hypnotic crescendo of Buried Secrets, built on minimalist repetition and gradual variation of distorted pitches. After three minutes, colossal drumming enforce geometry on what has become a stream of shrill noise. The orgy of saxophone squeals of Executioner is one long agony. The closer, The Toll, is an ultra-demented psychodrama (Justin Broderick on vocals) framed by spare beats, eerie distortions and booming bass chords (and, only at the end, the most scorching sax solo of the album).\n\nPainkiller's Rituals (Toy's Factory, 1993) was recorded live in Japan in 1991.\n\nMore News For Lulu (hatART, 1992) is another collection of jazz themes performed by Zorn, Lewis and Frisell, while Live Vol 1 (Knitting Factory, 2002) documents a 1989 Naked City show.\n\nHeretic (Avant, 1992) is Naked City's most radical work (and Eye's tour de force), 24 recombinant pieces that apply John Cage to atonal improvisation. Naked City's Grand Guignol (Avant, 1992) is simply the entire Torture Garden plus the 17-minute Grand Guignol (a rather different work that leans towards Japanese and Western classical music) and a few works of classical composers (Debussy, Skrjabin, Orlando DiLasso, Ives, Messiaen). Naked City's 31-minute Leng Tch'e (Toy's Factory, 1992) was inspired by the Melvins. Torture Garden and Leng Tch'e were reissued as the double-disc Black Box (Tzadik, 1996).\n\nJohn Zorn did not play on Elegy (Eva, 1992), a short, four-part (Blue, Yellow, Pink, Black) tribute to writer Jean Genet, scored for flute, viola, guitar, turntables, percussion and voice. Its impressionistic nature was unique in Zorn's canon, but did not make for engaging music (avantgarde or otherwise).\n\nNor did he play on the even more tragic Kristallnacht (Eva, 1993), whose movements compose a historical requiem for the holocaust (with sequences of simulated audio verite') and an ideal summary of Jewish music: Shtetl for trumpet, clarinet, and violin; Never Again, Gahelet, the cartoonish Tikkun, Tzfia (noise of a crowd in the streets), Barzel (marching, pounding, sirens), Gariin. The (strictly Jewish) ensemble (Mark Feldman on violin, Marc Ribot on guitar, Anthony Coleman on keyboards, Mark Dresser on bass, William Winant on percussion) is unusually sober and subdued.\n\nNaked City's Radio (Avant, 1993) was another (and perhaps the ultimate) exercise in quotation and collage at manic speed. Again Zorn focused on abrupt shifts of style (whether within the same song or from one song to the next), just like turning the tuning dial of a radio. Basically, an extension of the experiment of Speedfreaks.\n\nWhile less satisfactory, its companion album Absinthe (Avant, 1993), an-all instrumental release, highlighted Zorn's alter-ego, the austere industrial nightmare of Grand Guignol and Leng Tch'e. The ambient music of some tracks (Val De Travers, Fleurs Du Mal, Notre Dame De L'Oubli, Rend Fou) was annoyingly static and uneventful; but elsewhere the musicians created psychedelic and ghostly atmospheres not too different from Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother (Une Correspondance, La Fee Verte).\n\nPainkiller's double-disc Execution Ground (Subharmonic, 1994) is dominated by the ambient-dub aesthetic of Laswell and Harris, both on the three cinematic (and somewhat horror) tracks (Parish Of Tama, Morning Of Balachaturdasi, Pashupatinath) and especially on the two stationary monoliths (the second disc) that are derived from manipulating the first disc.\n\nNot content with Naked City and Painkiller, Zorn created another outfit, Masada, to explore the apocalyptic vision of Kristallnacht (Eva, 1993), i.e. the Jewish holocaust. Masada was programmatically meant as a more traditional jazz band (mainly inspired by Miles Davis and Ornette Coleman), and it also displayed a more traditional approach to klezmer melody (Zorn wrote a canon of about 200 tunes). Dave Douglas on trumpet, Greg Cohen on bass, Joey Baron on drums and others helped Zorn achieve the status of jazz musician (composer, arranger and performer) that he never quite achieved. Shtetl sets the stage for the requiem by blending mournful and cinematic instrumental phrases, documentary nazi declamation and a Rota-like nostalgic melody. Never Again is dominated by an instrumental simulation of shattering glasses, artfully mixed with manipulated voices, that constitutes one of Zorn's most powerful uses of noise as metaphor. Tzfia bridges neoclassical chamber music and extreme cacophony, another metaphorical statement in itself. The concept ends with the discordant jamming of Gariin, mired in harsh minimalist repetition and prog-rock anxiety.\n\nMasada recorded exactly ten albums: 1 aka Alef (DIW, 1994), with the nine-minute Janohah, 2 aka Beit (DIW, 1995), with the ten-minute Hadasha, 3 aka Gimel (DIW, 1995), with the nine-minute Ziphim and the nine-minute Tannaim, the EP 4 aka Dalet (DIW, 1995), 5 aka Hei (DIW, 1995), with the eleven-minute Hobah (a stylistic and technical tour de force by the combo) and possibly the best of the series, 6 aka Vav (DIW, 1995), with Debir and Miktav, 7 aka Zayin (DIW, 1996), with Shevet and Kedem, 8 aka Het (Tzadik, 1997), with Schechem and Ne'eman, 9 aka Tet (DIW, 1998), with Chayah, Meholalot and Acharei Mot, 10 aka Yod (Tzadik, 1998), with the 14-minute Abrakala. With few exceptions, Masada managed to produce an impressive amount of mediocre music that sounds all the same.\n\nAn appendix to Masada, the double-disc Bar Kokhba (Tzadik, 1996), mostly composed for a documentary, contains new arrangements of 22 of Masada's songs for chamber ensemble (cello, violin, guitar, piano, clarinet, organ), and even a 13-minute version of Mochin for solo gutiar (Marc Ribot). Zorn resurrected the idea for another double-disc reinterpreation of (29) Masada tunes: The Circle Maker (Tzadik, 1998), structured in two disc-long cycles, Issachar for string trio and Zevulun for sextet (string trio, guitar, two percussions). The Masada String Trio consisted of Greg Cohen (bass), Mark Feldman (violin), and Erik Friedlander (cello), and the Bar Kokhba Sextet added Marc Ribot (guitar), Cyro Baptista (percussion), and Joey Baron (drums). Both Bar Kokhba and The Circle Maker basically removed improvisation, removed Zorn from the players, and flattened the moody dynamics of Masada's performances.\n\nCobra's Live At The Knitting Factory (KFW, 1995) collects 14 live performances of Cobra held monthly in 1992.\n\nFirst Recordings (Tzadik, 1995) collects unreleased (and awful) 1973-74 compositions, such as the three-movement Mikhail Zoetrope. Thankfully, The Parachute Years (Tzadik, 1997) collects his essential \"game pieces\" of 1977-80: Lacrosse, Hockey, Pool, Archery.\n\nZorn (disguised under the monikers, respectively, Dekoboko Hajime and Rav Tzizit) also recorded Nani Nani (Tzadik, 1995) and Mystic Fugu Orchestra's Zohar (Tzadik, 1995), two noise-fests with Yamatsuka Eye (disguised under the monikers, respectively, Yamantaka Eye and Rav Yechido),\n\nThe main collaborations of the period were Art Of Memory (Incus, 1995) with Fred Frith, Harras (Avant, 1995) with Derek Bailey and William Parker, In Memory Of Nikki Arane (Incus, 1996) with Eugene Chadbourne, Euclid's Nightmare (Depth Of Field, 1997) with Bobby Previte, and Downtown Lullaby (Depth Of Field, 1998) with Wayne Horvitz, Elliott Sharp and Bobby Previte.\n\nRedbird (Tzadik, 1995), almost entirely taken by the 41-minute Redbird, presented a new side of Zorn, very much in the tradition of Morton Feldman's latter-day chamber music. Armed with Carol Emanuel on harp, Jill Jaffe on viola and Erik Friedlander on cello, Zorn (who does not play) conducts one of his most inspired neoclassical works. The music flows slowly, its nuances barely audible, as if the instruments had to ponder which note should follow the note that is droning away. The timbres are dense and elongated, evoking the glittering of dewdrops at sunrise. They are surrounded by a heavy silence, like an invisible atmosphere exerting the pressure that keeps things from flying away. There is a discreet order behind the chess-like moves of the instruments, there is a rational force at work hidden in the irrational layout of the game. The watery languor\n\nJohn Zorn does not play either on The Book Of Heads (Tzadik, 1995), 35 \"etudes\" for solo guitar (originally composed in 1978 for Chadbourne but here performed by Marc Ribot).\n\nFilmworks II (june 1992 - Toy's Factory, 1995) contains the score for a Walter Hill film that Zorn composed but that (thankfully) was rejected (Ry Cooder scored the one that was chosen). Filmworks III (Toy's Factory, 1996) contains the jazzy The Thieves Quartet (1993), that debuted the Masada line-up of bassist Greg Cohen, trumpeter Dave Douglas, drummer Joey Baron and Zorn, Hollywood Hotel (a series of duets between Zorn and Marc Ribot), Music For Weiden And Kennedy, etc. Despite the fact that Zorn's is some of the worst music ever composed for the cinematic media, the series continued with no mercy. Filmworks IV (Tzadik, 1997) contains a computer collage of musical samples, A Lot of Fun for the Evil One. Filmworks V (october 1995 - Tzadik, 1996) contains Tears Of Ecstasy, 48 one-minute fetishes of popular music performed by Robert Quine, Marc Ribot and Cyro Baptista. Filmworks VI (july 1996 - Tzadik, 1996), which contains Anton Mailman, Mechanics Of The Brain and The Black Glove, Filmworks VII was a reissue of the old soundtrack Cynical Hysterie Hour (october 1988).\n\nFilmworks VIII (Tzadik, 1998) contains The Port of Last Resort (november 1997), scored for jazz sextet (Feldman, Friedlander, bassist Greg Cohen, guitarist Marc Ribot, pianist Anthony Coleman and pipa virtuoso Min Xiao Fen) and Latin Boys Go To Hell (percussion only).\n\nCobra's Tokyo Operations '94 (Avant, 1995) collects six collaborations with Japanese musicians on Japanese instruments\n\nNew Traditions In East Asian Bar Bands (Tzadik, 1997) collects unreleased music from 1986-90 that involves a narrator.\n\nDuras; Duchamp (Tzadik, 1997) contains two chamber works, the sparsely textured Duras for sextet of two keyboards (Anthony Coleman, John Medeski), two violins (Mark Feldman and Cenovia Cummins) and two percussions (Christine Bard and Jim Pugliese); and the cacophonous and hyper-active Etant Donnes for violin (Feldman), cello (Erik Friedlander) and percussion (Pugliese).\n\nZorn's neoclassical ambitions permeate the anthology Angelus Novus (Tzadik, 1998), particularly For Your Eyes Only (1989) for chamber orchestra (another Carl Stalling-style score), Carny (1991) for solo piano, and the wind octet Angelus Novus (1993); culminating with the 10-part requiem Aporias (Tzadik, 1998), composed in 1994, for piano and (75-piece) orchestra. This displays his chaotic cut-up technique at its best, each of the ten movements being a collage of unrelated themes, tempos and events. The String Quartets (Tzadik, 1999) contains four of them: Cat O'Nine Tails (1988), perhaps his most obvious tribute to Carl Stalling, The Dead Man (1990), an extension of Naked City's cut-up aesthetics, Memento Mori (1992), a cryptic and pensive piece of atonal stream of consciousness, and Kol Nidre (1996).\n\nThe Bribe (Tzadik, 1998) contains three multi-part works from 1986 (originally composed for three radio plays): Sliding On The Ice, The Arrest, and The Art Bar. The \"orchestra\", which comprises Marty Ehrlich on saxophones and bass clarinet, John Zorn on alto sax, Jim Staley on trombone, Zeena Parkins on harp, Robert Quine on guitar, Anthony Coleman and Wayne Horvitz on keyboards, Christian Marclay on turntables, David Hofstra on bass, Bobby Previte on percussion, Carol Emanuel on harp, Ikue Mori on drum machines, seemed to hint at a return to his mid-period anti-jazz style, the chaotic collage of cartoon music, bebop jazz, Morricone soundtracks, surreal orchestrations and punk-rock.\n\nMusic Romance Volume 1 (Tzadik, 1998) collects music for children.\n\nNot content with having flooded the market of mediocre Masada recordings, Zorn released a number of live performances: the Live (Jazz Door, 1995), Live In Jerusalem 1994 (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Taipei 1995 (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Middleheim (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Sevilla (Tzadik, 2000), Live At Tonic (Tzadik, 2001), First Live 1993 (Tzadik, 2002).\n\nLacrosse (Tzadik, 2000) is a 1977 recording of Zorn's atonal nightmare.\n\nAt times Taboo And Exile (Tzadik, 1999), the first \"music romance\" album, sounds like rock music (loud and rhythmic) but also minimalism (most songs use repetition), particularly Thaalapalassi (with Frith, Ribot and Laswell).\n\nXu Feng (1985), for six players (Fred Frith and John Schott on guitars, Chris Brown and David Slusser on electronics, William Winant and Slayer's Dave Lombardo on percussion), inspired to kung-fu martial arts, ended the series of the \"game pieces\" titled after sports (the \"infinite system\" series) and began a new series, titled with Asian names. They are collected on Xu Feng (Tzadik, 2000).\n\nCartoon S/M (Tzadik, 2000) revises some of his neoclassical compositions: the String Quartets, most of Angelus Novus and Music for Children.\n\nFilmworks IX (Tzadik, 2000) contains Trembling Before G-d, his first feature-length soundtrack, scored only for clarinet (Chris Speed), organ (Saft) and percussion (Baptista). Filmworks X (Tzadik, 2001), containing In the Mirror of Maya Deren, is one of the most romantic, with tender cello and piano counterpoint and exotic overtones (Zorn on piano, Jamie Saft, Cyro Baptista, Erik Friedlander). Filmworks XI (Tzadik, 2002) contains one of his least experimental works, Secret Lives for string trio (Cohen, Feldman, Friedlander), which is basically kletzmer new-age music; Filmworks XII (Tzadik, 2002) ranks as one of the least organic and least inspired Homecoming for vocalist Jennifer Charles, violinist Mark Feldman, pianist Jamie Saft, and Zorn himself on organ). Filmworks XIII (june 2002 - Tzadik, 2002) is surprisingly one of his best, the score for Invitation to a Suicide (Ribot, Freidlander, Wollesen, Dunn and Tin Hat Trio's accordionist Rob Burger).\n\nMadness, Love & Mysticism (Tzadik, 2001) contain chamber music, in particular Le Momo (1999) for violin and piano, a \"ritual of exorcism and possession\", and Amour Fou (1999) for violin, cello and piano.\n\nBy his standards, The Gift (Tzadik, 2001), ostensibly the follow-up to Taboo & Exile, is almost new-age music: calm, soothing, relaxing adagios for a thirteen-unit ensemble.\n\nSongs from the Hermetic Theater (Tzadik, 2001) is a collection of radical computer-based experiments, mostly trivial.\n\nZorn introduced new elements in his music via another \"music romance\" album, I.A.O. (Tzadik, 2002), which has nothing in common with the previous ones: it is, basically, an exoteric mass a` la Aphrodite's Child's 666, devoted to visions such as Lucifer Rising (an angelic a-cappella choir), Leviathan (a burst of distorted heavy-metal fury) and Sex Magick (thirteen minutes of tribal drums), indulging in lugubrious Sacred Rites of the Left Hand Path (actually, one of his most effective electroacoustic compositions). Clavicle of Solomon, nine minutes of hissing alien radio signals, is one of Zorn's most successful excursions into musique concrete.\n\nPainkiller's Talisman (Tzadik, 2002) documents a 1994 concert in Nagoya. Naked City's Live 1 (Tzadik, 2002) documents a 1989 concert.\n\nHemophiliac (Tzadik, 2002) is a collaboration with Mike Patton and Ikue Mori.\n\nResurrecting one of the best ideas of his career (the solo guitar version of Mochin on Bar Kokhba), Masada Guitars (Tzadik, 2003) presents 22 Masada tunes rearranged for guitars only (Bill Frisell, Tim Sparks, Marc Ribot).\n\nThe double-disc Voices in the Wilderness (Tzadik, 2003) contains yet another set of (24) Masada tunes arranged for chamber ensembles (trios and quartets).\n\nChimeras (Tzadik, 2003) documents another chamber work: Chimeras (2001) for operatic singer and twelve instruments. Zorn goes for sophisticated psychological atmospheres crafted via loose and abstract soundscapes. The highlight is a magic interplay of percussion and voice, 7. The operatic voice is not Zorn's most natural instrument and the effect is embedding its forceful wordless laments and declamations into brief instrumental chaos is mixed. The voice-less suspense of 9 comes as a welcome relief.\n\nThe Unknown Masada (Tzadik, 2003) collects a dozen unreleased Masada tracks but not performed by Masada.\n\nZorn also composed a new string quartet, Necronomicon (2003).\n\nFilmworks XIV (april 2003 - Tzadik, 2003) contains Hiding and Seeking for classical guitar (Marc Ribot), vibraphone (Kenny Wollesen), Brazilian percussion (Cyro Baptista), acoustic bass (Trevor Dunn) and voice (Ganda Suthivarakom). Filmworks XV (october 2004 - Tzadik, 2005) contains the soundtrack for Protocols of Zion (Zorn himself on piano, percussionist Cyro Baptista and bassist and oud player Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz). Filmworks XVI (2005) contains Workingman's Death (percussionist Cyro Baptista, Ikue Mori on electronics, John Zorn on gamelan and organ, Jamie Saft on keyboards and guitars, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz on bass). Filmworks XVII (2005) contains Notes on Marie Menken (Zorn on alto, Kenny Wollesen on percussion, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz on bass, Jon Madof on guitar). Filmworks XVIII (2005) contains the soundtrack for The Treatment (Mark Feldman on violin, Kenny Wollesen on vibraphone, Rob Burger on accordion, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz on bass, Marc Ribot on guitar). Mostly his soundtracks were childish, amateurish and often tedious. Filmworks XIX (2005) contains the soundtrack for Rainhorse (Erik Friedlander on cello, Greg Cohen on bass, Rob Burger on piano).\n\nThe biggest problem with John Zorn is not that he is a mediocre musician (on the contrary) but that he lived in an age in which it is very easy and cheap to release music. Thus the average quality of his recordings is very low. That does not detract from the fact that some of his music was, indeed, worth releasing.\n\nMasada String Trio (Tzadik, 2004) documents a live performance.\n\nNaninani (Tzadik, 1995) and Naninani II (Tzadik, 2004) are collaborations with Yamataka Eye. Since printing CDs is cheap, Zorn released several volumes of 50th Birthday Celebration in 2005, each a collaboration with some of his friends.\n\nMagick (Tzadik, 2005) is the real gem among so much filler. It contains the five-movement suite Necronomicon for strings and 2001 Sortilege for two bass clarinets, chamber music that highlights Zorn's talent for turning classical harmony upside down and shows how he has wasted most of his career in pointless collaborations.\n\nNaked City's seven studio albums are collected on the five-CD box-set The Complete Studio Recordings (Tzadik, 2005).\n\nRituals (Tzadik, 2005), unrelated to Painkiller's namesake album, is an opera for voice and ten instruments composed for the Bayreuth Opera Festival in 1988.\n\nJohn Zorn's 50th Birthday Celebration Vol. 12 (Tzadik, 2005) is a live album credited to Painkiller, but does not include Mick Harris (replaced by Hamid Drake) and features vocalist Mike Patton.\n\nAt the Mountain of Madness (2006) is a live album.\n\nMysterium (2006) compiled three major chamber compositions: Orphe for viola, harp, keyboard, percussion, electronics, flute; Frammenti del Sappho for voice, soprano, alto, soprano; Walpurgisnacht for violin, viola and cello.\n\nThe Stone - Issue One (2006) is a collaboration with trumpeter Dave Douglas, also featuring Mike Patton (voice), Rob Burger (keyboards), Bill Laswell (bass) and Ben Perowsky (percussion).\n\nMoonchild (2006) is a new experiment combining composition and improvisation in a rock format (the trio of vocalist Mike Patton, bassist Trevor Dunn and drummer Joey Baron) and dedicated to three controversial characters: magician Aleister Crowley, poet Antonin Artaud and musician Edgard Varese. The result is often pretentious and uninspired, despite Patton's vocal acrobatics and the frightening rhythm machine.\n\nAstronome (2006) was meant as the continuation of Moonchild, as it featured the same line-up, except that this time the album was a rock opera in three acts. The format (three lengthy suites) seem to better suit the musical personae of the trio who, thanks or despite Zorn's conduction, unleash an inferno of deviant hardcore and heavy-metal.\n\nSix Litanies For Heliogabalus (2007) was the third installment of music for the trio of vocalist Mike Patton, bassist Trevor Dunn and drummer Joey Baron (plus Ikue Mori and keyboardist Jamie Saft).\n\n(Translation by/ Tradotto da Marco Spagnuolo)\n\nAppassionato da sempre di cartoni animati, Zorn scrisse e arrangio anche la colonna sonora dello spettacolo di animazione Cynical Hysterie Hour (ottobre 1988 - CBS, 1989), inseguito reintitolato Filmworks VII (Tzadik, 1996). Lontano dallessere una semplice deviazione nella sua carriera, e in realtà uno dei suoi piu ambiziosi tentativi di stravolgere la civilta musicale occidentale. Unimpressionante numero di strumenti vengono utilizzati (banjo, arpa, turntables, percussioni, violino, viola, violoncello, chitarre e tastiere) e musicisti (Frisell, Emanuel, Horvitz:, Previte, Marclay, Mori, Hofstra, Lindsay, Quine, Mark Ribot, Peter Scherer, ecc).\n\nIl mini album realizzato con i Naked City, Torture Garden (Shimmy Disc, 1990) a cui si aggiunse il cantante dei Boredoms, Yamatsuka Eye, al quintetto originale, il risultato di questa collaborazione fu abbastanza devastante: 42 miniature di psicotico hardcore che durano su per giu un minuto (una di queste miniature dura solo 8 secondi)\n\nFilm Works (Wave, 1991) una raccolta di musica per film composta tra il 1986 e il 1990: la mediocre White and Lazy del 1986 (con Quine, Lindsay, Gibbs, Fier, Emanuel, Weinstein, e Ned Rothenberg al clarinetto basso); la brillante The Golden Boat del 1990 (con Coleman, Quine, Emanuel, Dresser, Previte, Vicki Bodner alloboe, David Shea al turntable, Cyro Baptista alle percussioni); levocativa She Must Be Seeing Things ( con Stanley, Frisell, Emanuel, Coleman, Horvitz, Weinstein, Previte, Hofstra, Nana Vasconcelos alle percussioni, Shelley Hirsch al canto, Marty Ehrlich al clarinetto e al sassofono tenore, Tom Varner al corno francese). Questo e linizio di una serie infinita di \"film works\", la maggior parte dei quali ispirati alle colonne sonore per i cartoon di Carl Stalling.\n\nAccostandosi sempre piu a sonorita punk e rock, Zorn mise in piede anche il progetto Painkiller con il basista Bill Laswell e il batterista Mick Harris, lalbum era intitolato The Guts Of A Virgin (Earache, 1991).\n\nIl breve Buried Secrets (Earache, 1992) dei Painkiller e una potente esperienza psicologica. In Tortured Souls il sassofono veramente sembra assumere le tonalita di unanima torturata. Il battito grindcore fa a pugni su brani come One-Eyed Pessary, ma in questo caso il sassofono trasuda una passione titanica piu che semplice dolore. Trailmarker , 3 secondi di rumore, The Ladder, 22 secondi di punk rock. Il brano Blackhole Dub si avventura al di la della solita sognante atmosfera dub aggiungendo una serie di onde per sassofono stridente. Ancora piu avventurosa e laltro numero dub, Black Chamber, che comunque e anche il momento piu jazz dellalbum. Uno dei vertici di questo album e il crescendo ipnotico di Buried Secrets, una title-track costruita su una ripetizione minimalista e una graduale variazione di toni distorti. Dopo 3 minuti un battito colossale rinforza la geometria di quello che e diventato un flusso di rumore acuto. Lorgia che si viene a creare attraverso gli strillii del sassofono di Executioner e una lunga agonia. Il brano di chiusura e The Toll, e un psicodramma ultra-demenziale (Justin Broderick al canto)circondato da ritmi scarni, distorsioni da brivido e romboanti figure di basso (e , solo alla fine , il piuinfiammato assolo di sax dellintero album).\n\nRituals (Toy's Factory, 1993) dei Painkiller fu registrato live in Giappone nel 1991.\n\nMore News For Lulu (hatART, 1992) e unaltra raccolta di brani jazz eseguiti da Zorn, Lewis e Frisell, mentre Live Vol 1 (Knitting Factory, 2002) testimonia uno show dei Naked City del 1989.\n\nHeretic (Avant, 1992) e il lavoro piu radicale dei Naked City(e anche il tour de force di Eye), 24 brani ricombinati che appartengono tanto a John Cage quanto allimprovvisazione atonale. Grand Guignol (Avant, 1992) dei Naked City e semplicemente lintero Torture Garden con laggiunta dei 17 minuti di Grand Guignol (anzi un lavoro molto diverso che si sposta piu verso la musica classica giapponese e occidentale)) e di alcuni lavori di compositori classici (Debussy, Skrjabin, Orlando DiLasso, Ives, Messiaen). I 31 minuti di Leng Tch'e (Toy's Factory, 1992) sempre dei Naked City, era ispirato ai Melvins. Torture Garden e Leng Tch'e furono ripubblicati insieme in un doppio cd Black Box (Tzadik, 1996).\n\nJohn Zorn non suono su Elegy (Eva, 1992), un breve tributo in quattro parti (Blue , Yellow, Pink , Black), allo scrittore Jean Genet, registrato con flauto, viola, chitarra, turntables, percussioni e voce. La natura impressionista di questo lavoro fu unica nelle idee di Zorn, ma esso non lo trasformava in musica affascinante.(avanguardia o altro).\n\nZorn non suono neanche sul ben piu tragico Kristallnacht (Eva, 1993), i cui movimenti compongono una sorta di requiem storico relativo allolocausto (con sequenze di audio-verite simulate) e una sintesi ideale della musica Ebraica: Shtetl per tromba, clarinetto e violino; Never Again, Gahelet, la caricaturale Tikkun, Tzfia ( rumore di una folla giu per le strade), Barzel (marce, battiti , sirene) Gariin. Lensemble (rigorosamente ebraico) (Mark Feldman al violino, Marc Ribot alla chitarra, Anthony Coleman alle tastiere, Mark Dresser al basso, William Winant alle percussioni) e insolitamente calmo e attenuato.\n\nRadio(Avant, 1993) dei Naked City fu un altro(forse lultimo) esercizio nella citazione e del collage a velocita maniacali. Di nuovo Zorn concentro la sua attenzione su rapidi cambiamenti di stile(sia allinterno di una stessa canzone o anche da una canzone alla seguente), anche soltanto muovere il tasto \"tuning\" di una radio. Fondamentalmente, risulta essere una estensione di quellesperimento che fu Speedfreaks.\n\nMentre desta molto meno soddisfazione, il suo album, per così dire gemello, tutto strumentale Absinthe (Avant, 1993), che focalizza lattenzione sullalter-ego di Zorn, laustero incubo industriale di Grand Guignol e Leng Tch'e. Sono presenti anche alcuni brani ambient (Val De Travers, Fleurs Du Mal, Notre Dame De L'Oubli, Rend Fou) fastidiosamente statici e inconcludenti. Tuttavia i musicisti riuscirono a creare atmosfere eteree e psichedeliche non molto differenti da quelle presenti in Atom Heart Mother dei Pink Floyd (Une Correspondance, La Fee Verte).\n\nIl doppio disco dei Painkiller Execution Ground (Subharmonic, 1994) e dominato dallestetica dub- ambient di Laswell ed Harris, visibile sui tre brani da cinema(a dire il vero piuttosto horror) (Parish Of Tama, Morning Of Balachaturdasi, Pashupatinath) e specialmente sui due brani monolitici del secondo disco, che risultano essere una manipolazione derivante dal primo disco.\n\nZorn , non contento di aver dato luce ai Painkiller e ai Naked City, \"partorisce\" una nuova esperienza , i Masada, per esplorare la visione presentata in Kristallnacht (storia Ebraica). I Masada assunsero una forma piu tradizionale, simile alle jazz-band(essenzialmente ispirata a Miles Davis e Ornette Coleman), assumendo anche un approccio piu tradizionale alla \"Klezmer Melody\"(Zorn scrisse un canone di 200 toni). Dave Douglas come trombettista, Greg Cohen al basso e Joey Baron alla batteria aiutarono Zorn a raggiungere lo status di musicista jazz (compositore, arrangiatore, e performer) che non aveva quasi mai raggiunto. I Masada registrarono esattamente 10 album: 1 aka Alef (DIW, 1994), con i 9 minuti di Janohah, 2 aka Beit (DIW, 1995), con i 10 minuti di Hadasha, 3 aka Gimel (DIW, 1995), con i 9 minuti di Ziphim e i 9 minuti di Tannaim, l EP 4 aka Dalet (DIW, 1995), 5 aka Hei (DIW, 1995), con gli 11 minuti di Hobah (un vero e proprio tour de force tecnico e stilistico del combo) e probabilmente il migliore della serie, 6 aka Vav (DIW, 1995), con Debir e Miktav, 7 aka Zayin (DIW, 1996), con Shevet e Kedem, 8 aka Het (Tzadik, 1997), con Schechem con Ne'eman, 9 aka Tet (DIW, 1998), con Chayah, Meholalot e Acharei Mot, 10 aka Yod (Tzadik, 1998), con i 14 minuti di Abrakala. Con poche eccezioni, i Masada sono i fautori di musica mediocre che sembra sempre la stessa.\n\nUnappendice dei Masada, il doppio disco Bar Kokhba (Tzadik, 1996), di cui la maggior parte composto per un documentario, contiene nuovi arrangiamenti di 22 brani dei Masada per ensemble da camera( violoncello, violino, chitarra, pianoforte, clarinetto, organo), e anche una versione di 13 minuti di Mochin per sola chitarra(Marc Ribot). Zorn riprese lidea per un altra re-interpretazione (in doppio disco) di (29) brani dei Masada: The Circle Maker (Tzadik, 1998), strutturato in due dischi long-cycles, Issachar per trio darchi e Zevulum per sestetto(trio darchi, chitarra, due percussionisti). Sia Bar Kokhba che The Circle Maker fondamentalmente hanno rimosso limprovvisazione , Zorn dai musicisti, e spianano le dinamiche lunatiche delle performances dei Masada.\n\nLive At The Knitting Factory (KFW, 1995) dei Cobra raccoglie 14 performances dal vivo del brano Cobra tenute con cadenza mensile nel 1992.\n\nFirst Recordings (Tzadik, 1995) raccoglie materiale inedito(e orrendo), composizioni del periodo 1973-74, come i tre movimenti di Mikhail Zoetrope. Per fortuna, The Parachute Years (Tzadik, 1997) raccoglie i suoi \"game pieces\" essenziali compresi tra il 1977 e il 1980: Lacrosse, Hockey, Pool, Archery.\n\nZorn (adoperando vari moniker, rispettivamente, Dekoboko Hajime e Ray Tzizit) registro anche Nani Nani (Tzadik, 1995) e Zohar (Tzadik, 1995) dei Mystic Fugu Orchestra, due lavori del rumore con Yamatsuka Eye (adoperando vari moniker, rispettivamente, Yamantaka Eye e Rav Yechido).\n\nLe principali collaborazioni del periodo furono Art Of Memory (Incus, 1995) con Fred Frith, Harras (Avant, 1995) con Derek Bailey e William Parker. In Memory Of Nikki Arane (Incus, 1996) con Eugene Chadbourne, Euclid's Nightmare (Depth Of Field, 1997) con Bobby Previte, e Downtown Lullaby (Depth Of Field, 1998) con Wayne Horvitz, Elliott Sharp e Bobby Previte.\n\nRedbird (Tzadik, 1995), quasi interamente coperto dai 41 minuti di Redbird, presenta un nuovo lato di Zorn, molto piu nella vena tradizionale dellultima musica da camera di Morton Feldman. A questo album partecipano Carol Emanuel allarpa, Jill Jaffe alla viola e Erik Friedlander al violoncello, Zorn(che non suona) conduce uno dei suoi piu ispirati lavori neoclassici.\n\nJohn Zorn non suona neanche su The Book Of Heads (Tzadik, 1995), 35 \"etudes\" per sola chitarra(originariamente composto nel 1978 per Chadbourne, ma in questo caso eseguito da Marc Ribot).\n\nFilmworks II (Giugno 1992 - Toy's Factory, 1995) contiene i brani per un film di Walter Hill composti da Zorn ma che (per fortuna) fu scartata(fu scelta in seguito i brani eseguiti da Ry Cooder). Filmworks III (Toy's Factory, 1996) contiene The Thieves Quartet (1993) che vira verso il jazz, fu il debutto della nuova formazione dei MASADA che vedeva tra le sue fila, il bassista Greg Cohen, il trombettista Dave Douglas, il batterista Joey Baron e Zorn; Hollywood Hotel ( una serie di duetti tra Zorn e Marc Ribot), Music For Weiden And Kennedy, ecc. Malgrado il fatto che rappresenta una delle peggiori musiche fatte per il cinema da parte di Zorn, la serie continua senza tregua. Filmworks IV (Tzadik, 1997) contiene un computer collage per sample musicali, A Lot of Fun for the Evil One. Filmworks V (ottobre 1995 - Tzadik, 1996) contiene Tears Of Ecstasy, 48 feticci da un minuto di musica popolare eseguiti da Robert Quine, Marc Ribot, e Cyro Baptista. Filmworks VI (luglio 1996 - Tzadik, 1996), che contiene Anton Mailman, Mechanics Of The Brain and The Black Glove, Filmworks VII era una riedizione della vecchia colonna sonora Cynical Hysterie Hour (ottobre 1988). Filmworks VIII (Tzadik, 1998) contiene The Port of Last Resort (novembre 1997), brani per sestetto jazz (Feldman, Friedlander, il bassista Greg Cohen, il chitarrista Marc Ribot, il pianista Anthony Coleman e il virtuoso della pipa Min Xiao Fen) e Latin Boys Go To Hell (solo percussioni).\n\nTokyo Operations '94 (Avant, 1995) dei Cobra raccoglie sei collaborazioni con vari musicisti giapponesi adoperando strumenti di quella nazione.\n\nNew Traditions In East Asian Bar Bands (Tzadik, 1997) raccoglie musica inedita eseguita tra il 1986-90 che coinvolge anche un narratore.\n\nDuras; Duchamp (Tzadik, 1997) contiene due lavori da camera, Duras scarsamente strutturata composta per un sestetto comprendente due tastieristi(Anthony Coleman, John Medeski), due violinisti (Mark Feldman e Cenovia Cummins) e due percussionisti(Christine Bard e Jim Pugliese); e la cacofonica e iper-attiva Etant Donnes per violino (Feldman), violoncello(Erik Friedlander) e il percussionista (Pugliese).\n\nLe ambizioni neoclassiche di Zorn permeano lantologia Angelus Novus (Tzadik, 1998), notevole For Your Eyes Only (1989) per orchestra da camera (altro brano alla Carl Stalling), Carny (1991) per solo pianoforte, e Angelus Novus (1993) per ottetto a fiato; le sue ambizioni culminano nel requiem in 10 parti di Aporias (Tzadik, 1998), composta nel 1994, per pianoforte e orchestra(75 brani). Questo lavoro mostra la meglio la tecnica caotica del \"cut-up\" di Zorn, ognuno di questi 10 movimenti costituisce un collage di temi , tempi ed eventi senza nessuna relazione. The String Quartets (Tzadik, 1999) contiene Quattro di loro: Cat O'Nine Tails (1988), forse il suo più ovvio tributo a carl Stalling, The Dead Man (1990), una estensione del \"cut-up\" dei Naked City, Memento Mori (1992), un brano criptico e penoso di uno \"stream of consciousness\" atonale, e Kol Nidre (1996).\n\nThe Bribe (Tzadik, 1998) contiene tre lavori in più parti datate 1986( originariamente composte per esecuzioni radio): Sliding On The Ice, The Arrest, e The Art Bar. LOrchestra, che comprende Marty Ehrlich al sassofono e al clarinetto basso, John Zorn al sassofono alto, Jim Staley al trombone, Zeena Parkins allarpa, Robert Quine alla chitarra, Anthony Coleman e Wayne Horvitz alle tastiere, Christian Marclay al turntables, David Hofstra al basso, Bobby Previte alle percussioni,Carol Emanuel allarpa, Ikue Mori alla drum machine, sembrava insinuare un ritorno al suo stile anti-jazz, e al collage caotico della musica danimazione, bepop jazz , colonne sonore alla Morricone, le orchestrazioni surreali e il punk-rock.\n\nMusic Romance Volume 1 (Tzadik, 1998) raccoglie musica per ragazzi.\n\nNon contento di aver inzuppato il mercato con le mediocri registrazioni dei Masada , Zorn da alle stampe diversi performances live: Live (Jazz Door, 1995), Live In Jerusalem 1994 (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Taipei 1995 (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Middleheim (Tzadik, 1999), Live In Sevilla (Tzadik, 2000), Live At Tonic (Tzadik, 2001), First Live 1993 (Tzadik, 2002).\n\nLacrosse (Tzadik, 2000) e una registrazione del 1977 di un incubo atonale di Zorn.\n\nTaboo And Exile (Tzadik, 1999), il primo album di \"music romance\", sembra piu vicino alla musica rock(sia in termini di volume sia di ritmica) ma anche vicino al minimalismo(la maggior parte dei brani fanno leva sulla ripetizione), notevole Thaalapalassi ( con Frith, Ribot e Laswell).\n\nXu Feng (1985), per sei musicisti (Fred Frith e John Schott alle chitarre, Chris Brown e David Slusser allelettronica, William Winant e dave lombardo degli Stayer alle percussioni). Ispirato al kung-fu, terminava la serie dei \"game pieces\" intitolata proprio \"Sports\" (the \"infinite system\" series) e ne comincio unaltra, intitolata con nomi Asiatici. Esse sono raccolte su Xu Feng (Tzadik, 2000).\n\nCartoon S/M (Tzadik, 2000) riprende alcune sue composizioni neoclassiche: String Quartets, la maggior parte di Angelus Novus e Music For Children.\n\nFilmworks IX (Tzadik, 2000) contiene Trembling Before G-d, la sua prima colonna sonora per lungometraggio, eseguita solo per clarinetto (Chris Speed, organo (Saft) e percussioni (Baptista). Filmworks X (Tzadik, 2001), contenente In the Mirror of Maya Deren, e uno dei piu romantici, con un delicato violoncello e piano contrappunto ed overtones esotici (Zorn al piano, Jamie Saft, Cyro Baptista, Erik Friedlander). Filmworks XI (Tzadik, 2002) contiene uno dei suoi lavori meno sperimentali, Secret Lives per trio darchi (Cohen, Feldman, Friedlander), la quale e fondamentalmente new age-klezmer; Filmworks XII (Tzadik, 2002) comprende una delle sue formazioni minori e risulta essere uno dei meno organici e meno ispirati, Homecoming per la cantante Jennifer Charles, il violinista Mark Feldman, il pianista Jamie Saft e Zorn stesso allorgano. Filmworks XIII (giugno 2002 - Tzadik, 2002) e sorprendentemente uno dei suoi migliori , notevole Invitation to a Suicide (Ribot, Freidlander, Wollesen, Dunn e la fisarmonica dei Tin Hat Trio, Rob Burger).\n\nMadness, Love & Mysticism (Tzadik, 2001) contiene musica da camera, in particolare Le Momo (1999) per violino e piano, un rituale di esorcismo e possessione, e Amour Fou (1999) per violino, violoncello e piano.\n\nPer i suoi standard, The Gift (Tzadik, 2001), apparentemente fa da seguito a Taboo & Exile, il quale risulta essere quasi musica new-age: calma, consolante, e adagi rilassanti per un ensemble di 13 unita\n\nSongs from the Hermetic Theater (Tzadik, 2001) e una raccolta di esperimenti per computer music, tutto allinsegna della trivialita\n\nZorn finalmente introduce nuovi elementi nella sua musica, e lo fa con un altro album \"music romance\", I.A.O. (Tzadik, 2002), il quale non ha niente in comune con gli album addietro; e , fondamentalmente, una messa esoterica a la 666 degli Aphrodite Child, devoto alle visioni come Lucifer Rising e Sex Magick (13 minuti di trialismo), indulgendo nella lugubre Sacred Rites of the Left Hand Path.\n\nTalisman (Tzadik, 2002) dei Painkiller documenta un concerto a Nagoya nel 1994. Live 1 (Tzadik, 2002) dei Naked City, documenta un loro concerto del 1989\n\nHemophiliac (Tzadik, 2002) e una collaborazione con Mike Patton e Ikue Mori.\n\nRiprendendo una delle migliori idee della sua carriera(la versione per sola chitarra di Mochin on Bar Kokhba), Masada Guitars (Tzadik, 2003) presenta 22 brani dei Masada riadattati per sole chitarre (Bill Frisell, Tim Sparks, Marc Ribot).\n\nIl doppio disco Voices in the Wilderness (Tzadik, 2003) contiene ancora un altro set di (24) brani dei Masada riadattati per ensemble da camera(trii e quartetti).\n\nChimeras (Tzadik, 2003) e unaltra musica da camera: Chimeras (2001) per voce e dodici strumenti\n\nThe Unknown Masada (Tzadik, 2003) raccoglie una dozzina di materiale inedito dei Masada ma non eseguiti dai Masada\n\nZorn ha anche composto un nuovo brano per quartetto darchi, Necronomicon (2003).\n\nFilmworks XIV (aprile 2003 - Tzadik, 2003) contiene Hiding and Seeking per chitarra classica (Marc Ribot), vibrafono (Kenny Wollesen), percussioni brasiliane (Cyro Baptista), basso acustico(Trevor Dunn) e voce (Ganda Suthivarakom).

Filmworks XVI (2005) contiene Workingman's Death (il percussionista Cyro Baptista, Ikue Mori allelettronica, John Zorn al gamelan e allorgano, Jamie Saft alle percussioni, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz al basso), Filmworks XVII (2005) contiene Notes on Marie Menken (Zorn allalto sassofono, Kenny Wollesen alle percussioni, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz al basso, Jon Madof alla chitarra). Filmworks XVIII (2005) contiene la colonna sonora di The Treatment (Mark Feldman al violino, Kenny Wollesen al vibrafono, Rob Burger alla fisarmonica, Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz al basso, Marc Ribot alla chitarra). La maggior parte delle sue colonne sonore sono bambinesche, amatoriali e spesso noiose.\n\nIl piu grande problema con Zorn non e il fatto che egli e un musicista mediocre(tuttaltro) ma egli vive in unepoca in cui stampare un cd e diventato facile e a basso costo. Quindi la maggior parte delle sue registrazioni risultano mediocri, tuttavia parte della sua musica rimane di notevole valore.\n\nMasada String Trio (Tzadik, 2004) documenta una performance live.\n\nNaninani (Tzadik, 1995) e Naninani II (Tzadik, 2004) sono collaborazioni con Yamataka Eye. Da quando stampare cds e diventato facile e basso costo, Zorn ha dato alle stampe diversi volumi del 50th Birthday Celebration nel 2005, ognuno dei quali e una collaborazione con parte dei suoi amici musicisti.\n\nMagick (Tzadik, 2005) e la vera gemma in mezzo a tanta spazzatura. Contiene la suite Necronomicon una suite in 5 movimenti per archi e 2001 Sortilege per due clarinetti basso, musica da camera che focalizza il talento di Zorn nel capovolgere larmonia classica e mostra come Zorn ha sprecato la maggior parte della sua carriera in collaborazioni inutili.\n\nI sette album dei Naked City sono raccolti in un box-set di 5 cd The Complete Studio Recordings (Tzadik, 2005).\n\nRituals (Tzadik, 2005), non relativo allalbum omonimo dei Painkiller, e un opera per voce e 10 strumenti composto per il Bayreuth Opera Festival nel 1988.\n\nJohn Zorn's 50th Birthday Celebration Vol. 12 (Tzadik, 2005) e un album live accreditato ai Painkiller, ma questo lavoro non vede la presenza di Mick Harris (sostituito da Hamid Drake) e ha come protagonista il cantante dei Faith No More, Mike Patton.\n\nAt the Mountain of Madness (2006) e un album live.\n\nMysterium (2006) raccoglie le tre maggiori composizioni di musica da camera: Orphe per viola, arpa, tastiera, percussione, elettronica, flauto; Frammenti del Sappho per voce , soprano , contralto; Walpurgisnacht per violino, viola e violoncello.\n\nThe Stone - Issue One (2006) e una collaborazione con il trombettista Dave Douglas, Mike Patton(canto), Rob Burger(tastiere), Bill Laswell(basso) e Ben Perowsky(percussioni).\n\nMoonchild (2006) e un nuovo esperimento nel combinare composizione e improvvisazione in un formato rock, al servizio del trio composto dal cantante Mike Patton, il bassista Trevor Dunn, e il batterista Joey Baron; questo lavoro e dedicato a tre controversi personaggi storici: il mago esoterico Aleister Crowley, il poeta Antonin Artaud, il musicista Edgar Varese. Il risulta e spesso pretenzioso e poco ispirato, malgrado lo spaventoso ritmo della batteria e le acrobazie vocali di Patton.\n\nAstronome (2006) che puo essere visto come la continuazione naturale di Moonchild, del quale riprende la stessa formazione, eccetto che questa volta lalbum e una vera opera rock in tre atti. Il formato (tre lunghe suite) sembra voler rispecchiare le tre personalita che compongono questo trio che , grazie o malgrado la conduzione di Zorn, mettono in scena un inferno di hardcore deviato ed heavy-metal.\n\nSix Litanies For Heliogabalus (2007) e il terzo album messo su da Zorn per il trio \"rock\" , Mike Patton(voce), Trevor Dunn(basso) e Joey Baron (batteria), questa volta con laggiunta di Ikue Mori e del tastierista Jamie Saft.\n\nZorn wrote a \"Book of Angels\" about the fallen angels of the Bible (usually associated with Satan) and then commissioned various musicians to compose music for each section.
