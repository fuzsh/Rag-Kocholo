His work has been hailed as âmesmerizingâ and âmusic of a composer with a personal voice and keen imaginationâ by The New York Times and âwondrously alluringâ by The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nAdams is currently a Mead Composer-in-Residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During his tenure with the CSO, Adams will create new works for the orchestra and co-curate the CSO’s critically-acclaimed MusicNOW series with fellow Composer-in-Residence Elizabeth Ogonek.\n\nAdams has received commissions from Carnegie Hall, San Francisco Symphony, New World Symphony, and St. Lawrence String Quartet and has collaborated with many of today's leading voices in contemporary music, including Spektral Quartet, The Living Earth Show, pianist Sarah Cahill and conductor David Robertson.\n\nRecent highlights include Quartet Movement for the Spektral Quartet and the world premiere of Light Readings by the Northwestern Bienen School of Music Contemporary/Early Vocal Ensemble and Members of the Chicago Symphony. In the spring of 2018, the CSO will feature his many words of love on their tour of the East Coast.\n\nFuture projects include a chamber concerto for violinist Karen Gomyo, which will have its premiere with members of the CSO under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen and a new work for the Australian Chamber Orchestra, which they will feature on their 2018 Australian tour.\n\nA committed educator, Adams frequently engages in projects with young musicians.

According to a few apps on his phone, his Kyu ranking is somewhere in the mid-to-low 20s. He’d like to get better at chess but never seems to find the time for it.\n\nChristopher Biggs is a composer and multimedia artist residing in Kalamazoo, MI, where he is Assistant Professor of Music Composition and Technology at Western Michigan University. Biggs’ recent projects focus on integrating live instrumental performance with interactive audiovisual media.

Her 2013 release A Sweeter Music (Other Minds) featured musical reflections on war by eighteen composer/activists, commissioned especially for the album. In 2015, Pinna Records released her two-CD set of Mamoru Fujieda’s Patterns of Plants, a fusion of nature and technology created by identifying the musical patterns in the electrical impulses of plants. Cahill recently finished recording a four-CD set of Terry Riley’s solo and four-hand music with pianist Regina Schaffer for release in fall 2017 on the Irritable Hedgehog label.\n\nHer radio show, Revolutions Per Minute, can be heard every Sunday evening from 8 to 10 pm on KALW, 91.7 FM in San Francisco.

Indeed, most spectral music filters pitch content in one way or another. In Christian’s work, he filters the spectral content through a diatonic (major/minor key) grid. Christian’s work Direct your step further along the road’s course, commissioned by the E-MEX Ensemble, uses a consistent spectral process across the work that unfolds at a glacially slow pace. This pacing allows the listener to aurally zoom in and explore the most minute changes and interrelationships between these disparate sound worlds.\n\nChristian has received commissions from the Fromm Music Foundation at Harvard University, the Lorelei Ensemble, the 59th Festival Les Musicales (2011; Colmar, France), the 19th and 20th Juventus Festivals (2009 and 2010; Cambrai, France), the 2011 Monadnock Music Festival, the Aurora Borealis Duo, the Playground Ensemble, Julien Libeer, Eryn Oft, and Matthias Geuting, among others. Christian is the recipient the Fulbright Fellowship to Estonia and the BMI Student Composer Award.

He lives in New Haven, Connecticut, with his wife Rosemary.\n\nWilliam Duckworth (1943-2012) was a composer, performer, author and teacher whose work is known worldwide. He was the founder of Postminimalism and his Time Curve Preludes for piano define the style. Since their 1979 premiere, these preludes have been heard on five continents, from Armenia and The People's Republic of China to Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Spoleto USA, the Brisbane Powerhouse, the Auditorium of Rome, and the Festival of Havana, where they were broadcast in the streets. Today, remixes of the preludes can be found on YouTube.\n\nIn 1997, Duckworth and media artist and programmer Nora Farrell began Cathedral, the first interactive work of music and art on the web. The Cathedral Project features a rich-media website; new virtual instruments, including the PitchWeb; and the Cathedral Band, a worldwide collective that bridges the virtual and live worlds. Band performances have been webcast from Australia and Japan, as well as from a variety of locations in the U.S., including such New York City venues as Roulette, Galapagos, The Cutting Room, LaMaMa, the Winter Garden, and the Hiro Lounge at the Maritime Hotel. In 2001, the Cathedral Project mounted a continuous 48-hour webcast, streaming 34 performances live from 5 continents. The New York Times called the event a fabulous idea; Time Out New York said Wow. Visitors to the Cathedral site now exceed five million, and the development of the project is chronicled in Virtual Music: How the Web Got Wired for Sound (Duckworth: Routledge, 2005).\n\nDuckworth and Farrell’s second project, an iPod opera based on the Orpheus myth, explores space, scale, memory, and echo through a 2-year unfolding of video podcasts and stage performances, culminating in a public opera, iOrpheus, staged in the streets and promenades of the South Bank Parklands in Brisbane, Australia (31 August 2007).\n\nBorn in North Carolina in 1943, Duckworth studied at the University of Illinois with microtonal composer Ben Johnston, himself a student of John Cage and Harry Partch. His first appearance in Europe was at the 1984 Pro Musica Nova festival in Germany. He has also recorded with the Electric Phoenix in London, given master classes in Rome, played the mobile PitchWeb in Tokyo, and participated in the composition forum at Darmstadt.\n\nDuckworth taught at Bucknell University from 1973 to 2011. In addition to numerous teaching awardsâRolling Stone magazine called his teaching hip, bright, and innovative,âDuckworth’s honors include four NEA and NEH fellowships, the 2001 ASCAP-Deems Taylor Internet Award, the 2002 Award in Music from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and a Senior Fulbright Specialist Award in Information Technology to Australia in 2007. He was also a Master Artist at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 2006, as well as the 2007 Inaugural Creative Arts Fellow for South Bank Precinct, Brisbane.\n\nDuckworth and Farrell returned to Australia in June 2009 to inaugurate a multi-year project titled Sonic Babylon, an art project planting gardens of sound around the world; invisible gardens hanging in the air and heard on mobile devices when visitors pass through. These gardens include the first permanent sound garden in Australia at the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra, which opened during Sound Day 2009.\n\nPaul A. Epstein's compositions include two chamber operas as well as works for string orchestra and for a variety of small ensembles.

He has received commissions from the RelÃ¢che Ensemble (The Leper’s Helix and AlgoRhythms 2) and baritone Thomas Buckner (Reading.) Epstein is a member of BMI.\n\nIn American Music in the Twentieth Century, critic Kyle Gann cites Epstein as âOne of the finest postminimal composers...â and calls Chamber Music: Three Songs from Home â...a vocal setting for winds and keyboards of great contrapuntal beauty.â Epstein's music has been presented in the U.S. and abroad by such ensembles as RelÃ¢che, counter)induction, the Circle ensemble of London, and ONIX Nuevo Ensamble de MÃ©xico. It is available on compact disk on the Mode, Navona, and Capstone labels.\n\nPaul A. Epstein is Professor Emeritus of Music Theory at Temple University, where he taught from 1969 to 2001. Born in Boston in 1938, he is a graduate of Brandeis University and the University of California at Berkeley. His composition teachers included Harold Shapero, Seymour Shifrin, and Luciano Berio, with whom he studied privately on a Fulbright grant to Italy in 1962-63. Epstein has been involved in closely collaborative work with artists in theater and dance. He was associated with the New York environmental theater group The Performance Group from 1969 to 1972, and from 1974 to 1987 he was composer and music director for ZeroMoving Dance Company of Philadelphia.\n\nAn article by Kyle Gann, âAmerican Composer: Paul A. Epstein,â appears in the December, 2004 issue of Chamber Music, a publication of Chamber Music America.\n\nJÃ¼rg Frey was born in 1953 in Aarau. Following his musical education, which finished with the examen de virtuositÃ© in the class of Thomas Friedli at the Concervatoire de Musique de GenÃ¨ve, he turned to a career as a clarinetist, but his activities as composer soon came to the foreground.\n\nHe developed his own language as a composer and sound artist with the creation of wide, quiet sound spaces. His work is marked by an elementary non-extravagence of sound, a sensibilty for the qualities of the material, and precision of compositional approach. Sometimes his compositions bypass instrumentation and duration altogether and touch on aspects of sound art.\n\nHe has worked with compositional series, as well as with language and text. Some of these activities appear in small editions or as artist's books as individual items and small editions. (Edition Howeg, Zurich; weiss kunstbewegung, Berlin; complice, Berlin). His music and recordings are published by Edition Wandelweiser.\n\nHe has been invited to workshops as visiting composer and for composer portraits at the UniversitÃ¤t der KÃ¼nste Berlin, the UniversitÃ¤t Dortmund and several times at Northwestern University and CalArts.\n\nSome of the other places his work has developed are the concerts at the Kunstraum DÃ¼sseldorf, the Wandelweiser-in-Residence -Veranstaltungen in Vienna, the Ny music concerts in Boras (Sweden), the cooperation with Cologne pianist John McAlpine, the Bozzini Quartet (MontrÃ©al), QO-2 (Bruxelles), Die Maulwerker, incidental music, as well as the regular stays in Berlin (where during the last years many of his compositions were premiered).\n\nJÃ¼rg Frey is a member of the Wandelweiser Komponisten Ensemble which has presented concerts for more than 15 years in Europe, North America and Japan. Frey lives with his family in Aarau (Switzerland), teaches clarinet, and organises the concert series moments musicaux aarau as a forum for contemporary music.\n\nRandy Gibson is an artist based in Brooklyn, NY composing with sound, time, light, and space. Gibson’s work unfolds at a glacial pace and treats the perception of time as a defining factor in thematic development and the experience of pure just intonation intervals. His work has been described as âengag(ing) with rhythms and temporality existing outside of our socially-constructed rhythms, offering a glimpse of time outside of timeâ (I Care If You Listen), \"luxuriantly unhurried, intensely focused\" (Thought Catalog), âan hypnotic mass of slowly mutating soundâ (Textura) âa booming, throbbing sine wave that filled the roomâ (New York Times), and âa gorgeously expansive dronescapeâ (Aquarius).\n\nGibson has received commissions from choreographers Kim Olson/Sweetedge, Ekmeles Vocal Ensemble, Transit New Music Festival, Erik Carlson, R. Andrew Lee, The Tapeworm, and Cassauna. The 2010 London Premiere of The Third Analog Pillar..., hailed by Liminal's Scott McMillan as \"a moment of relative calm, of stillness, and of pleasingly soporific and mind-emptying purity,\" was made possible by a grant from the American Music Center (now called New Music USA). Gibson was awarded a fellowship in Music and Sound from the New York Foundation for The Arts in 2016. His solo just intonation piano album, Aqua Madora V-ii-2008 21:07:26\" - 21:54:40\" (NYC), was selected by Textura as one of the top 10 albums of 2011.\n\nGibson’s studies of rÄga singing in the Kirana tradition with Khan Sahib La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, and Jung Hee Choi, and extensive direct exposure to many of Young and Zazeela’s seminal works, have brought intense focus to the environments he creates. In late 2009, inspired by Young’s systemic and eternal approach to pitch and Vertical Hearing, Gibson began developing a set of tuning theories called The Four Pillars which has provided the harmonic, conceptual, and tonal language for all of his subsequent work including his recent works with pure projected light.\n\nHe has presented performances and installations at festivals around the world including the Avant Music Festival in New York City, the Spark Festival of Electronic Music and Art in Minnesota, The Transit New Music Festival in Belgium, The Internationale Tanzmesse NRW in DÃ¼sseldorf, The Boulder and Minnesota International Fringe Festivals, HOT DAM: the opening festival of the Denver Art Museum, the Sans Souci International Festival of Dance Cinema, the ISIM 3rd annual conference, the Erick Hawkins Legacy Forum in New York, the Korea Experimental Arts Festival in Seoul, and the Internationale Ferienkurse fÃ¼r Neue Musik, Darmstadt.\n\nGibson was raised in Boulder, Colorado, traveling into the high mountains to look at the stars and the Milky Way and meditate on the expanses of life. This formative experience has instilled in his work a grand spaciousness and scale. In 2001, Gibson moved to New York City and since 2003, has studied music and composition with seminal Minimalist pioneer La Monte Young.\n\nIn 2003 Gibson founded Avant Media, a non-profit organization dedicated to expansive collaborative artistic endeavors, and, since 2010, curated the Avant Music Festival, celebrating composers’ singular visions in dedicated concerts and installation experiences.\n\nSteve Gisby is a British composer, bassist, writer, examniner and educator. He was born in 1975 and lives near London.\n\nSteve's music has been performed across the USA, Europe and the UK. Two of his works appear on Symmetry | Reflection, the debut CD by US percussion duo Novus Percutere, alongside music by Steve Reich, John Psathas, Chrisopher Adler, Ivan Trevino and Luis Rivera.\n\nSteve has given lectures and presentations at IRCAM in Paris, the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Furman University in South Carolina, California State University at Long Beach, Canterbury Christ Church University, Surrey University, the University of Huddersfield and the University of Birmingham. He is on the committees of the Society For Minimalist Music and the Music And / As Process Study Group. He also works as an examiner for Trinity College London on their Rock & Pop syllabus, having conducted exams in the UK, Northern Ireland, Italy, India, Vietnam, South Africa, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nAs a bassist, Steve performs with a wide range of ensembles thoughout the UK, including appearances at Ronnie Scott's, the Edinburgh Festival and on HTV (West), Channel 4 and satellite broadcasts to the USA, Canada, Mexico, Europe and the Far East. In May 2014, along with pianist Michael Bonaventure, he gave the world premiere performance of Tom Johnson's Intervals.\n\nWhen not playing music, teaching music, writing music, writing about music, listening to music or reading about music, Steve can usually be found drinking tea or making a fuss of his cats.\n\nEva-Maria Houben (born 1955) studied Music Education at Folkwang-Musikhochschule Essen and the organ with Gisbert Schneider. Following her exams she taught both German and Music Education at Secondary School. She received her doctorate and postdoctoral lecturing qualification in musicology and was called for lectures at Gerhard-Mercator-UniversitÃ¤t Duisburg and Robert-Schumann-Hochschule DÃ¼sseldorf. Since 1993 Professor Houben has been lecturing at Dortmund University`s âInstitut fÃ¼r Musik und Musikwissenschaftâ, with both music theory and contemporary music as her focus.

After 15 years in New York, he moved to Paris, where he has lived since 1983. He is considered a minimalist, since he works with simple forms, limited scales, and generally reduced materials, but he proceeds in a more logical way than most minimalists, often using formulas, permutations, predictable sequences and various mathematical models.\n\nJohnson is well known for his operas: The Four Note Opera (1972) continues to be presented in many countries. Riemannoper has been staged more than 30 times in German-speaking countries since its premier in Bremen in 1988. Often played non-operatic works include Bedtime Stories, Rational Melodies, Music and Questions, Counting Duets, Tango, Narayana's Cows, and Failing: a very difficult piece for solo string bass.\n\nHis largest composition, the Bonhoeffer Oratorium, a two-hour work in German for orchestra, chorus, and soloists, with text by the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, was premiered in Maastricht in 1996, and has since been presented in Berlin and New York.\n\nJohnson has also written numerous radio pieces, such as J'entends un choeur (commissioned by Radio France for the Prix Italia, 1993), Music and Questions (also available on an Australian Broadcasting Company CD) and Die Melodiemaschinen, premiered by WDR Radio in Cologne in January 1996.\n\nThe principal recordings currently available on CD are the Musique pour 88 (1988) (XI), An Hour for Piano (1971) (Lovely Music), The Chord Catalogue (1986) (XI), Organ and Silence (2000) (Ants), and Kientzy Plays Johnson (2004) (Pogus), Rational Melodies and Bedtime Stories performed by clarinetist Roger Heaton (Ants Records AG12) and Symmetries (Karnatic LabsKLR 010).\n\nRecent projects include Tilework, a series of 14 pieces for solo instruments, published by Editions 75 in 2003, Same or Different, a piece commissioned by the Dutch radio in 2004, and the Combinations for String Quartet, premiered in Berlin on the MÃ¤rzMusik festival in 2004, and more recently, scores such as Kirkman’s Ladies, Networks, Septet, and 55 Chords for two electric keyboards, all derived from combinatorial designs. As performer he frequently plays his Galileo, a 40-minute piece written for a self-invented percussion instrument.\n\nJohnson received the French national prize in the victoires de la musique in 2001 for Kientzy Loops. The latest orchestra score is 360 Chords, premiered in July 2008 by Musica Viva in Munich.\n\nElainie Lillios's music reflects her fascination with listening, sound, space, time, immersion and anecdote. Her music explores many sound worlds; sometime referential ones such as the human voice, cars, wind chimes, or water. Other times her materials are less obvious, like crunching branches, walking through snow or pebbles shuffling in water. Her compositional output includes electroacoustic and acoustic works, music for instruments with live interactive electroacoustics, and collaborative immersive multimedia audio/visual installation environments. Her research interests include sound diffusion as the performance practice of electroacoustic music, audio spatialization employing Ambisonics (3D audio), critical listening as a creative aid and Deep Listening.\n\nHer creative work and research has been funded through grants and commissions from organizations including the International Computer Music Association, La Muse en Circuit, New Adventures in Sound Art, Reseaux, ASCAP/SEAMUS, Kalamazoo Animation Festival International, Louisiana State Universitys Center for Computation and Technology, Sonic Arts Research Centre Belfast, Ohio Arts Council, Mid-American Center for Contemporary Music, Ohio Board of Regents and National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts.

McIntire was born in upstate New York and has had some training on the clarinet. Weekly exposure to Protestant hymnody and playing in a small town band were experiences that provided his entry into music. Hearing the music of Sibelius in the fifth grade also made a deep impact. He has maintained his livelihood for three decades through playing, teaching, composing, and writing about music. He has had an inexplicable interest in electronic and modern music since his early teen years, to the frustration of several of his teachers. He also played clarinet and saxophone in a number of eccentric and overly idealistic musical groups, most notably the Colorblind James Experience (with whom he toured and recorded extensively), the Whitman/McIntire Duo, and the Hotheads. Presently, he leads the Ensemble of Irreproducible Outcomes (EIO) an improvisational trio based in Kansas City. He also runs Irritable Hedgehog Music, a small label devoted to minimal and electroacoustic music. Several of their releases have been widely praised for their sound quality, historical importance and musical content.\n\nMcIntire holds music degrees from Nazareth College of Rochester, Ithaca College, and a DMA in composition from the University of Missouri-Kansas City where he was a Preparing Future Faculty Fellow. His research interests include soundscape composition, minimalism and postminimalism, the âAmerican Mavericksâ tradition, and the music of Harrison Birtwistle. He is a current board member of Electronic Music Midwest, a founding member of the Society for Minimalist Music, and has given papers at three of their international conferences.

Her career spans fifty years of boundary dissolving music making. In the '50s she was part of a circle of iconoclastic composers, artists, poets gathered together in San Francisco. Recently awarded the John Cage award for 2012 from the Foundation of Contemporary Arts, Oliveros is Distinguished Research Professor of Music at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, and Darius Milhaud Artist-in-Residence at Mills College. Oliveros has been as interested in finding new sounds as in finding new uses for old ones --her primary instrument is the accordion, an unexpected visitor perhaps to musical cutting edge, but one which she approaches in much the same way that a Zen musician might approach the Japanese shakuhachi. Pauline Oliveros' life as a composer, performer and humanitarian is about opening her own and others' sensibilities to the universe and facets of sounds. Since the 1960's she has influenced American music profoundly through her work with improvisation, meditation, electronic music, myth and ritual. Pauline Oliveros is the founder of \"Deep Listening,\" which comes from her childhood fascination with sounds and from her works in concert music with composition, improvisation and electro-acoustics. Pauline Oliveros describes Deep Listening as a way of listening in every possible way to everything possible to hear no matter what you are doing. Such intense listening includes the sounds of daily life, of nature, of one's own thoughts as well as musical sounds. Deep Listening is my life practice,\" she explains, simply. Oliveros is founder of Deep Listening Institute, formerly Pauline Oliveros Foundation, now the Center For Deep Listening at Rensselaer.\n\nCalifornia Composer Terry Riley launched what is now known as the Minimalist movement with his revolutionary classic IN C in 1964. This seminal work Provided a new concept in musical form based on interlocking repetitive patterns. It's impact was to change the course of 20th Century music and it's influence has been heard in the works of prominent composers such as Steve Reich, Philip Glass and John Adams and in the music of Rock Groups such as The Who, The Soft Machine, Tangerine Dream, Curved Air and many others. Terry's hypnotic, multi-layered, polymetric, brightly orchestrated eastern flavored improvisations and compositions set the stage for the prevailing interest in a new tonality.\n\nWhile working on a masters degree at UC Berkeley in 1960, he met La Monte Young, whose radical approach to time made a big impact and the two made a life long association.\n\nDuring this time Riley and Young worked out many of their seminal ideas while working with influential dancer Anna Halprin.\n\nDuring a sojourn to Europe 1962-64 he collaborated with members of the Fluxus group, playwright Ken Dewey and trumpeter Chet Baker and was involved in street theater and happenings.\n\nIn 1965 he move to New York and joined La Monte Young’s Theater of Eternal Music.\n\n1967 was the year of his first all night concert at the Philadelphia College of Art and he began a collaboration with visual artist Robert Benson resulting in more all night concerts.\n\nRecordings of In C, A Rainbow in Curved Air, Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band and the Church of Anthrax were all issued by CBS Masterworks in 1968-69.\n\nIn 1970, Terry became a disciple of the revered North Indian Raga Vocalist, Pandit Pran Nath and made the first of his numerous trips to India to study with the Master. He appeared frequently in concert with the legendary singer as tampura, tabla and vocal accompanist over the next 26 years until Pran Naths passing in 1996. He has co-directed along with Sufi Murshid, Shabda Kahn of the Chisti Sabri India music study tours 1993-2000.\n\nTerry regularly appears in concerts of Indian Classical Music and conducts raga singing seminars.\n\nI studied music with Larry Wallach and Thom Lipiczky at Simon’s Rock from 1974 to 1978, graduating with a BA. During this time, I studied classical guitar with Edward Flower.\n\nIn the fall of 1978, I moved to New York City, where I spent the next ten years, during which I focused on playing electric guitar (and for a while, Chapman Stick). While in NYC, I co-led and wrote for a band called People Falling, played (and wrote a couple of things) in Bill Obrecht’s group La Guapa Papa, and performed and recorded with several Downtown composers, notably Lois V Vierk, Scott Johnson, and Guy Klucevsek. I gave the the premiere performances and made the first recording of Vierk’s piece âGo Guitarsâ for five microtonal electric guitars, and also participated in the premier recording of her ensemble piece âRed Shiftâ. Along the way, I performed in a number of venues, including CBGB, Danceteria, The Kitchen, Alice Tully Hall, Dance Theater Workshop, the Walker Art Museum (Minneapolis), the Styrian Autumn festival (Graz, Austria), the American School (Paris), and the New Music America festival (Los Angeles). I left NYC in 1988, moving first to update New York then to southwestern New Hampshire, where I remain.\n\nAround 2004, I started writing and recording electronic music using Csound, with a focus on drone music and just intonation. I also moved from guitar to bass, playing with local free improv band Sisters and Brothers. I started performing live electronic music in 2006.\n\nMilky Way or Galaxy are traditional Korean translations of the first name of flutist Meerenai Shim Pronounced âme-ren-ay,â the unusual name befits this unique and forward thinking musician.\n\nMeerenai is a founding member of the innovative flute and percussion duo, A/B Duo. In 2016, she joined the award-winning contemporary flute ensemble, Areon Flutes. She is also one half of the newly formed contrabass flute and contraforte duo, Keyed Kontraptions. She has performed all over the United States as a soloist and chamber musician. Recent performances include the Soundwave Biennial in San Francisco, the Bang on a Can Summer Festival, the National Flute Association’s Annual Conventions, and numerous universities. In addition to regular broadcast of her recordings on classical radio stations, Meerenai's recordings and performances have been featured on Music from Other Minds, Live from WFMT, and New Music Box.\n\nIn 2015 Meerenai founded Aerocade Music, a record label specializing in contemporary classical, electronic, and experimental music. Her third solo album, the all-electroacoustic Pheromone, is the first release on the label. Regarding Pheromone, Fanfare Magazine says, \"Flautist Meerenai Shim has the chops and the heart to do these recently composed pieces full justice, and this inaugural release on her own Aerocade label is the proverbial proof of the pudding.\"\n\nAfter a practice-related injury almost derailed her flute career, Meerenai started studying the Alexander Technique, body mapping, and the Feldenkrais Method. She now teaches musicians how to play better by improving their movement. Her pedagogical philosophy of using the principles of the Feldenkrais Method in flute study can be seen in her book, Scale Studies for Beginner and Intermediate Flutists. She is currently training to become a Feldenkrais Practitioner.\n\nEver adventurous, Meerenai has never been afraid to learn new things. Whether it’s picking up the tenor banjo to play an informal concert at the Aspen Music Festival where she was conducting student, or trying her hand at producing an independent film, she has always been willing to rise to the occasion and learn new things. Between receiving her Bachelor of Music in flute performance from DePaul University and the Master of Music in flute performance from San Francisco State University, Meerenai worked in the Information Technology field and in Management Consulting. All of her past experiences and can-do attitude naturally led her to seeking out new repertoire and contemporary music.\n\nAs a part of A/B Duo, and on her own, Meerenai has commissioned new works from numerous composers including Daniel Felsenfeld, Andrea La Rose, Isaac Schankler, and Ken Ueno. Her frequent collaborator Matthew Joseph Payne has written Meerenai a few pieces with accompaniment by Gameboy or other circuit-bent instruments. She enjoyed playing in Matthew Joseph Payne's chiptune band The Mineral Kingdom and is constantly thinking of starting or joining a punk band as a drummer.\n\nMeerenai Shim is a fiscally-sponsored affiliate of InterMusic SF, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to small-ensemble music in the San Francisco Bay Area. She resides in Silicon Valley with her husband Dave, and their Great Dane mix, Lady.\n\nAnn Southam was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1937 but lived most of her life in Toronto.

As well as creating music for some of Canada's major modern dance companies and choreographers including The Toronto Dance Theatre, Danny Grossman, Dancemakers, Patricia Beatty, Christopher House and Rachel Browne, she was an instructor in electronic music at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and has also participated in many \"composer-in-the-classroom\" programs in elementary and high schools. While a great deal of her work was electroacoustic music on tape, in her later years she became increasingly interested in music for acoustic instruments. She composed concert music for a variety of acoustic instruments and instrumental ensembles, working with such artists and ensembles as Eve Egoyan, Christina Petrowska Quilico and Arraymusic. Ann Southam's work was commissioned through the Canada Council, the Ontario Arts Council, and the CBC, and has been performed in Canada, Europe and the U.S. She is a member of the Canadian Music Centre, the Canadian League of Composers and a founding member of the Association of Canadian Women Composers.\n\nShe was the recipient of the Friends of Canadian Music Award in 2001.\n\nAnn Southam passed away November 25, 2010.\n\nChristine Southworth (b. 1978) is a composer and video artist based in Lexington, Massachusetts, dedicated to creating art born from a cross-pollination of sonic and visual ideas. Inspired by intersections of technology and art, nature and machines, and musics from cultures around the world, her music employs sounds from man and nature, from Van de Graaff Generators to honeybees, Balinese gamelan to seismic data from volcanoes.\n\nSouthworth received a B.S. from MIT in 2002 in mathematics and an M.A. in Computer Music & Multimedia Composition from Brown University in 2006.

His performances have been described as âa ghostly, gorgeous lesson in how close, concentrated listening can alter and enhance perceptionâ (The New York Times). Since 2006, he has collaborated extensively with the composer Michael Pisaro, producing a large body of music comprised of pieces that focus on the magnification of small sounds through recording and layering, often in combination with field recordings and/or electronic sound. His role as an interpreter of Pisaro’s compositions has been called âa David Tudor to Pisaro’s Cageâ (The Boston Globe). Stuart's most recent collaboration with the composer, Continuum Unbound, a three-disc box set on Gravity Wave, grew out of the pair’s field recording work in Congaree National Park and was selected by The Wire as one of the best albums of 2014.\n\nStuart currently performs with fellow percussionists Tim Feeney and Sarah Hennies in the percussion trio, Meridian, and with computer musician Joe Panzner.
