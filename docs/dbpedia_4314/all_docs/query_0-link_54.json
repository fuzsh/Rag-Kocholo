Starting in the 70s, he released a number of truly amazing solo albums, most of them on the FMP label.\n\nUsing regular and self-made instruments, his music truly sounds like no one else's. This was his first and is the 1st time it has appeared on CD!\n\nConditionally hugely recommended!\n\n\"Originally released on FMP in 1973, this is the debut LP by legendary German guitar improvisor and instrument inventor...\n\n\"In 1998, at WNUR Radio, Evanston, the legendary German bassist Peter Kowald met two Chicagoans in the studio for a brisk set of string trios. Fellow-bassist Kent Kessler and cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm, essential members of the Chicago scene, are well known as international improvisors too, and the threesome dug in for a fierce face-off. The session was closely recorded in the studio’s intimate confines, which could barely contain their energy. Kowald proposed a set of six miniatures, all ranging around...\n\nSteve Lacy, soprano saxophone\n\nSteve Potts, alto saxophone\n\nIrene Aebi, voice\n\n\"Soprano saxophonist Lacy wrote the suite of tunes for Tips to feature the aphorisms of painter Georges Braque, as sung by Irene Aebi. Together with his right-hand-man, alto saxophonist Potts, he and Aebi recorded these 14 anthemic tracks in Paris in 1979, and the young hat Hut label issued them on a now-rare LP. The music allowed Lacy to extend and deepen his longstanding interest in setting text to music, and at the\n\nBilly Bang, violin\n\n\"The long out-of-print first solo record by American violinist Billy Bang (1947-2011), recorded in 1979 and first released on Hat Hut Records, featuring his own compositions, extrapolated at length in the intimate live concert, as well as traditional and improvised material. Remastered from original tapes and augmented by newly discovered recordings from the same concert. Part of the large cache of historical Hat Hut records that Corbett vs. Dempsey continues to release. Original...\n\nPeter Brötzmann, tenor saxophone\n\nFred van Hove, piano\n\nHan Bennink, drums, percussion\n\n\"Recorded at the height of their powers as the leading free jazz trio in Europe, 1971 includes some of the hottest and heaviest music ever made by Brötzmann, starting with an inflammatory, incandescent 26-minute live track recorded at the New Jazz Meeting auf Burg Altena. Only available on a nearly-impossible-to-find LP sampler issued at the time by the festival, this marks \"Just for Altena\"'s first...\n\nTenor Saxophone – Frits Krogh\n\nPiano – Tom Prehn\n\nBass – Poul Ehlers\n\nDrums – Finn Slumstrup\n\nRecorded in Copenhagen, October 13th, 1963\n\n\"Arguably the rarest LP of European free jazz, Axiom was recorded in 1963 for the Swedish label Sonet. Test pressings were released to the musicians, but they were not approved and the label never printed more than the two first copies.

All other tracks previously unreleased.\n\nRecorded for the German FMP label in 1972, this is one of the landmark recordings of free jazz in Europe, a mind-blowing studio session featuring Carl on tenor saxophone, Günter Christmann on trombone, and the astonishing Detlef Schonenberg on drums.

Brilliant and whimsical, the tracks bring to mind Honsinger's work with ICP Orchestra, for whom he has also composed extensively.

Projections also includes some of the art installation projects for Albert Oehlen works of recent vintage, such as \"Alarm,\" composed by Wertmüller, well known among other...\n\nRecorded March 10, 1963, Choreographer's Workshop, New York City.\n\nA special 2-CD reissue of the hyper-rare El Saturn LP, recorded in 1963, early in the Arkestra's NY period, paired with a full disc of extra material. Loaded with John Gilmore, one of the greatest & rarest slabs of Sun Ra vinyl, on disc for the first time!\"\n\nPhillip Wilson, percussion\n\nOlu Dara, trumpet, horn (serpent)\n\n\"In November 1977 and May 1978, months before drummer Phillip Wilson recorded his great LP Duet with trumpeter Lester Bowie for the Improvising Artists label, Wilson hit the studio for Esoteric, a recording of solos and duets with cornetist Olu Dara. Wilson (1941-1992) was one of the key percussionists in creative music, the Art Ensemble of Chicago's early trapsman, one third of the fusion band Full Moon, and an all around fount of inventi\n\n\"In July 2013, a few months after the passing of his mother, cornetist Rob Mazurek performed solo at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery, in Chicago. Mazurek is one of the highest profile figures in contemporary creative music, leading bands like the Exploding Star Orchestra, Skull Sessions Octet and Starlicker. On this occasion, he brought a box filled with various implements – his cornet, naturally, but flutes, bells, books, maracas, apples, and little electronics. This box became an inexhaustible resource...\n\n\"At the end of his time in Chicago, in 1999, Brian Calvin recorded a batch of new songs with poet Devin Johnston. Designed to be an album, mostly recorded and mixed by Jim O'Rourke, who also plays bass and contributes background vocals on some cuts, they were never released, languishing in the vaults for almost two decades. Calvin and Johnston had both been members of USA, the band that recorded an LP and an EP for Drag City in the two years before this music was recorded. On the occasion of...\n\nThurston Moore, guitar\n\nFrank Rosaly, drums, percussion\n\n\"Guitar hero Thurston Moore and improvising drummer Frank Rosaly met for a first encounter in 2012 at the Neon Marshmallow Festival, at the Burlington in Rosaly's hometown, Chicago. The results were monumental. The slow build of Moore's gigantosaur sound and Rosaly's clamorousness and gradually escalating propulsion made for an idea match over the course of an electrifying 35-minute piece, the thunderous conclusion of which left no ear...\n\n\"One of the most celebrated folks in improvised music, Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson made three ultra-limited edition vinyl LPs, each featuring a different dedication to a favorite musician from the past. Released in batches of 99, these records found Gustafsson playing compositions by Duke Ellington, Albert (and his brother Donald) Ayler, and the important post-bop baritone player Lars Gullin. Long out-of-print, these priceless slabs of free music have quickly become sought after collector’s items...\n\nOne of the greatest, most damaged albums ever. In any genre or category. Period. The only album that sounds like this one is this one.\n\n\"One of the absolute essentials of Chadbourne's oeuvre, what he described as \"free improvised country & western bebop,\" featuring his frantic, skewed interpretations of classic songs such as Merle Haggard's \"Swingin' Doors,\" Roger Miller's \"The Last Word in Lonesome is Me,\" and Willie Nelson's \"Mr. Record Man,\" There'll Be No Tears Tonight was recorded in Spring...\n\n\"In 1981, Joe McPhee culled together one of his greatest bands to record Topology, his classic outing for Hat Hut. Feturing an expanded version of Po Music, his ensemble with saxophonist André Jaume, guitarist Raymond Boni, and bassist François Mechali, the group included pianist Irene Schweizer, percussionist Pierre Favre, baritone saxophonist Daniel Bourquin, cellist Michael Overhage, and trombonist Radu Malfatti. One of the tracks left on the cutting room floor was a spectacular take on Ornette...\n\n\"Commissioned by Experimental Sound Studio in 2000 to create a radio work for the Outer Ear Festival, Kapsalis and Corbett returned to their investigation of film noir and pulp fiction, creating a half-hour work of non-narrative radio theater featuring music and text collage, as well as Kapsalis on violin and Corbett on analog synthesizer. Drawing on writers like Jim Thompson and David Goodis, as well as a lexicon of criminal terminology, it offers a Dada roller-coaster ride through diners, speakeasies...\n\nJoe McPhee, brass and reeds\n\n\"In his upstate NY secret laboratory, home-based in Poughkeepsie, Joe McPhee diligently documented his activities throughout the '70s, with the help of Craig Johnson, the producer who started CjR as an outlet for McPhee's music. Among the unreleased tapes waxed in that span, Alone Together is unique and especially beautiful. Like Sound on Sound (released by Corbett vs. Dempsey in 2010), these recordings make use of multitrack recording, overdubbing McPhee upon McPhee...\n\nWadada Leo Smith: trumpet, flugelhorn, flute, steelophone, percussion, gongs\n\n\"On the occasion of improvisor and composer Wadada Leo Smith's exhibition Ankhrasmation: The Language Scores, 1967-2015 at Chicago's Renaissance Society, Corbett vs. Dempsey is pleased to present Red Chrysanthemums, a previously unreleased live recording of solo performances by Smith, documented in Los Angeles in December, 1977.

Blue Line comes from a concert in Rouen, France, when McPhee...\n\n\"Chicago-based cellist and composer Tomeka Reid, a mainstay on the Windy City scene and an important contemporary member of the A.A.C.M., was commissioned to create original music for the first documentary to chronicle the Imagists, Chicago’s hometown post-surrealists who exhibited together starting in the mid-1960s. Reid composed theme music for the film and made a wide range of multi-track improvisations based on moods, creating a tableau from which the film drew as it unwound the artists’ circuitous...\n\n\"An epic outing on electric guitar, recorded in November 2013, as part of an evening of music and film at the Art Institute of Chicago. The CD features a single magnificent improvisation, ranging from brittle, delicate passages to full-throttle flame-throwing. Performing an accompaniment to James Nares’ brilliant film Street, Moore played with his back to the screen, letting the sounds and images converge and diverge of their own accord. The result was an extraordinary stand-alone live recording that...\n\n\"Glasses was recorded in October, 1977, during a highly significant period in McPhee's work, as he was pioneering the transatlantic, collaborative spirit that has helped to define the last three decades of his career. Documented in Tavannes, Switzerland, the set contains sensational tenor work, including the title piece, which finds McPhee ringing out a rhythm on a half-full wine glass, from which he extrapolates a melody on the saxophone, as well as a stunning version of John Coltrane's \"Naima.\" The...\n\n\"Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and Chicago saxophonist and clarinetist Ken Vandermark have worked together extensively since the mid 1990s, in groups of their own and as members of the Peter Brötzmann Chicago Tentet. Oddly, they had never performed duo before March 2013, when they squared off at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery. The result was a delirious journey through extended techniques, intimate improvisation, and full-throttle flame-throwing, with an emphasis on the more delicate, sensitiv\n\n\"This is a reissue of Eugene Chadbourne's album, first released as a cassette on No Prestige Records in 1988.\n\nDateline: Christmas Day, 1977, San Francisco.

Perhaps the pinnacle of the Suns Of Arqa discography, Seven was released in 1987 and was in fact the band's fifth LP. With its stunning cover design and outlandishly ambitious sound, steeped in dub but festooned with plainchant and Indian music, it was alone in the market, its closest relatives maybe African Head Charge or New Age Steppers, but with a host of original ideas and musical intersections and an incredible, almost...\n\nSteve Lacy, soprano saxophone and Japanese bird whistle Steve Potts, alto and soprano saxophone Irene Aebi, cello, violin, voice, bells Kent Carter, bass Oliver Johnson, drums Originally released in 1979 as a double-LP on Hat Hut, Stamps was Steve Lacy’s first for the legendary Swiss label, and it remains one of the strongest statements of what he termed the “scratchy seventies.”\n\nWith the classic lineup of Lacy’s soprano saxophone, Steve Potts on soprano and alto sax, Irene Aebi on cello...\n\nBeaver Harris, drums\n\nDon Pullen, piano\n\nHamiet Bluiett, baritone saxophone\n\nRicky Ford, tenor saxophone\n\nBuster Williams, bass\n\nFrancis Haynes, steel drums\n\nCandido, percussion (1)\n\nSharon Freeman, Willie Ruff, Bill Warnick, Greg Williams, french horns (1)\n\n\"Of all the never-issued-on-CD items in history’s dustbin, A Well-Kept Secret is perhaps the most egregious.

In the night air, he bowed and plucked in conversation with the environment, especially the vocalizing frogs, which seemed to take him on as an exotic member of their own.\n\nImpeccably documented by the experienced soundscape artist and field..\n\nKen Vandermark, reeds\n\nMichael Snow, piano\n\n\"Although he is best known as a groundbreaking experimental filmmaker, one of the architects of structural cinema, and visual artist, Michael Snow has been active as a musician since the 1950s. In Greenwich Village of the 1960s, his loft was the site of concerts by Cecil Taylor and other paragons of free jazz, and Snow’s film New York Eye and Ear featured a soundtrack by Albert Ayler’s group and starred its members.\n\nA brilliant keyboardist and..\n\nMats Gustafsson – alto, tenor and baritone saxophones\n\nJason Adasiewicz – vibraphone and balafon\n\n\"Discussing this impending studio date, the indefatigable saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and intrepid vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz decided to compose new pieces for one another.

It was December 1970, thirty-one-year-old McPhee was inspired by Amiri Baraka's poem 'It's Nation Time,' and the students at Vassar Collegedidn't know what hit them. 'What time is it?' shouted McPhee. 'Come on, you can do better than that. What time is it?!!' The music on Nation Time came out of a fertile, but little-known creative jazz scene...\n\nThe long-awaited first reissue of one of the most legendary albums in the history of free music. Recorded live in concert in 1976, when Graves' trio with saxophonists Arthur Doyle and Hugh Glover was at the height of its powers, Bäbi is a testament to the absolutely unique approach the drummer had established for himself. He had reconfigured the drum kit, removing the second heads on all the drums and replacing the snare with two toms, which allowed him a much more nuanced sense of indirectness in his...\n\n“It's easy to be cynical these days, maybe difficult to imagine that music can change the world, but not for Joe McPhee and Hamid Drake.
