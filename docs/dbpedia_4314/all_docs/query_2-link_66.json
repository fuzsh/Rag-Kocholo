        "text": "Welcome back idiotprogrammer, Robert Nagle, to OoOâs longstanding mini-feature. Â\n\nÂ\n\nIn it, he mentions an article from 2000 by Courtney Love and follows up, âhttps://www.salon.com/2000/06/14/love_7/Â Courtney LoeÂ wrote this long screed in 2000!Â\n\nRe-reading it, I see that her take was on the mark. I'm in the publishing business and face some of the same issues (sort of).Â\n\nA lot of older authors have a hard time getting their rights backÂ (It's called rights reversion), but there is a process for doing so. The labels grabbed a bit too much in the 1990s especially before digital sales was a significant chunk of their sales. But it all depends on your contract; if musicians got legal representation, they could know these things in advance, but labels signed people very quickly in the 1990s without musicians getting legal advice.Â labels used to beÂ a little too controlling of the small number of ubercelebrities they signed on.â\n\nOoO did not intend to take a three-month hiatus, but weâre glad to be back with idiotprogrammer, Robert Nagle.\n\nÂ\n\nDJ Poseur claims that DL is the best rock band to have its whole discography on Bandcamp on a âname your priceâ basis:Â https://dolefullions.bandcamp.com/\n\nFind S&Sâs debut on Discogs:Â https://www.discogs.com/master/107485-SavathSavalas-Folk-Songs-For-Trains-Trees-And-HoneyÂ\n\nÂ\n\nSTRUCTURE:Â War in Europe for Ukrainian & Russian Music (to 9:25) Doleful Lions âOut Like a Lambâ (9:25-16:00) Other critics & genre, Lazarus as a song premise (16:00-24:00)Â Being tame â> longevity? Bandcampâs future in licensing.Â Downsides of consistency (24:00-27:52) Doleful Lions âLook Homeward Angel Numbers,â Ratings, RIYLs (27:52-31:17)Â Comparison of very different album picks & Robertâs thoughts on Savath & Savalas, how excited to be about mellow music (31:17-44:08) Savath & Savalas âFolk Songs for Trees, Trains and Honeyâ electronic music around the turn of the 21st century (44:08-48:45) AMG & Pitchfork on S&S & what ambient is and is not, elderly electronic listeners, live music & instrumental music, unpredictability in repetitive musical styles (48:45-1:00:30) What we listened to that our parents couldnât stand, DJ Poseur goes racist to describe styles of music he doesnât like in misinterpretation of a question about Thai musical tastes, Trip-hop & downtempo versus jazz & lounge music, RIYLs (1:00:30-1:06:25) Rating S&S (1:06:25 to conclusion).\n\nÂ\n\nIn the Ukraine war intro, Robert does a great job with examples of how musicians on all sides are responding.Â UKRAINIAN MUSIC FOREVER!! Robert's \"Ukraine Pop Music is Cool\" Playlist on Spotify.Â https://spoti.fi/3MnVNTnÂ Also a Youtube playlist:Â https://bit.ly/3vMpeILÂ Â As always, check out his blog for more media.Â http://www.imaginaryplanet.net/weblogs/idiotprogrammer/\n\nÂ We also mention âRussian folk singers with a messageâ such as Alexander Rozenbaum.\n\nÂ\n\nAlbum reviews for âOut Like a Lambâ:Â https://chicagoreader.com/music/local-indie-rockers-doleful-lions-have-long-been-overlooked-but-theyve-never-lost-their-spark/ , https://chicagoreader.com/music/local-indie-rockers-doleful-lions-have-long-been-overlooked-but-theyve-never-lost-their-spark/ .Â AMG thinks very highly of them but hasnât updated their discography https://www.allmusic.com/artist/doleful-lions-mn0000141712 .Â Two others get the Pitchfork treatment https://pitchfork.com/artists/1261-doleful-lions/ .Â\n\nÂ\n\nDJ Poseur canât take psychedelic folk rock revivalism very seriously due to Spinal Tapâs âListen to the Flower PeopleâÂ\n\nÂ\n\nâOut Like a Lambâ is RIYL: Â The Beatles, The Beach Boys, His Name Is Alive, \"Kumbaya\", Junip/Jose Gonzalez, Simon & Garfunkel, Mamas and the Papas, Paul Simon, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, Papas Fritas.\n\nâLook Homeward Angel Numbersâ is RIYL:Â The Faint, Caesars, Many Birthdays, Dandy Warhols, Gentlemen\n\nDJ Poseur owns most of and recommends the entirety of the Hefty Records catalog for fans of instrumental, post-rock, experimental but still accessible downtempo electronica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefty_Records .Â\n\nÂ\n\nThe cohost and DJ Poseur disagree on whether DL would be RIYL or overall sounds similar to Of Montreal for their psychedelic chameleon rock discographies that vary over decades from the 1990s to the 2020s.\n\nÂ\n\nâFolk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honeyâ is RIYL:Â Bonobo, Boards of Canada, Thievery Corporation (& full stable of ESL Music in Washington D.C. = Eighteenth Street Lounge Music), DJ Farinaâs âMushroom Jazzâ.\n\nThe rest of S&Sâs discography is RIYL:Â Devendra Banhart, Junip/Jose Gonzalez, Cass McCombs\n\nÂ\n\nA very old Pitchfork review of it:Â https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7007-folk-songs-for-trains-trees-and-honey/Â\n\nÂ\n\nRobertâs favorite mellow music comes from Polly Scattergood & Goldfrapp, both comparable in his view to Stevie Nicks.Â Also\n\nAustralian singer Princess Chelsea .\n\n.\n\nÂ\n\nItâs been a long, unscheduled hiatus for OoO, but hereâs a morsel of what weâll talk about in OoO EI4, currently being edited.Â The albums up for arrangement from most to least famous in this quiz are as follows:\n\nÂ\n\nA. Dandy Warhols - \"Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia\" (2000).Â B. The Apples in Stereo - \"Fun Trick Noisemaker\" (1995).Â C. The Vryll Society - \"Course of the Satellite\" (2018).Â D. Doleful Lions - \"Out Like a Lamb\" (2002).Â E. Gentlemen - \"Secret Memories\" (2020).Â F. The Everly Brothers - \"Roots\" (1968).Â G. Guided by Voices - \"Bee Thousand\" (1994).\n\nÂ\n\nBy the guestâs request, I cross-checked the number of reviews on AllMusic Guide with the number on rateyourmusic.com .Â Impressively, the rankings were exactly the same in terms of comparing the number of user rankings for each album.Â Furthermore, the most-ranked album for each artist (which is usually the one chosen for the Obscurity Quiz) was also the same as on AMG.Â Letâs hear it for intercoder reliability or at least internet statistics generally!Â Woo consensuses!\n\nÂ\n\nOn Discogs, itâs much more labor-intensive to find out which of a bandâs albums has the most ratings.Â The albums in this quiz differed slightly there, with The Dandy Warhols more popular relative to GBV &Â The Everly Brothers more popular relative to The Apples in Stereo.Â I probably wonât do this much follow-up after every Obscurity Quiz going forward, however fascinating these subtle differences may be.\n\nBuy our album picks on Bandcamp, 3/4 on a âname your priceâ basis:Â https://capillaryaction.bandcamp.com/album/capsizedÂ &Â https://discorporate.bandcamp.com/album/squeeze-me-ahead-of-line\n\nÂ\n\nSTRUCTURE:Â OG introduces CA & his history w/ them, attending & booking concerts, the awe of discovering something completely new, the importance of venue, stripping down the band on tour, DJ Poseurâs ignorance of Oberlin but mutual co-op Hobart worship, CA is recommended for whom? (0:00-13:20) Drummers w/ energy & turning on a dime, composition versus improvisation, any accessible entry points?, NO Mr. Bungle!, âCapsizedâ & âSo Embarrassingâ, associates of CA, OGâs concert bookings in the bygone days of Myspace, the early days of social media, one doesnât get into music for the money, underground & âself-releasedâ music (13:20-24:18) Being an amazing opening act w/ a famous tour versus headlining, collaboration & exposure, ratings & critical reviews, Pitchfork readers poll & Joe Tangariâs reviews of CA (24:18-30:20) individual songs on âCapsizedâ, the convergence of extreme complexity & unintentionally genius incompetence, a van accident, the Kevin Shea tributes, side projects & day jobs as the tragedy of the millennial generationâs musical luminaries, WI (30:20-39:48) CAâs elusive discography, documentation of OGs glory days w/ CA, the meaning of CA, RIYLs (39:48-45:35) ratings, metal adjacency & the need for experimentation (45:35-48:50) transition between album picks (48:50-56:33) no such thing as bad music?Â acquired tastes & the need for repeated listening to appreciate versus being a rock edgelord (compared to the more American practice of getting really into obscure forms of Christianity), are they done making music?, pushing the boundaries of rock in the 2020s, hooks, complexity, drumming (56:33-59:59) electronics sour the rock purists, vocal comparison, unusual song structures & unpredictability > soloing.Â âSqueeze Me Ahead of Lineâ, Discorporate & Tzadik Records, collaborators famous and obscure, plugging Bandcamp call to action (59:59-1:06:25) review on âAll About Jazzâ and elsewhere & when screaming vocals are appropriate, then individual songs on âa subtle albumâ, quasi-jazz comparisons, songs blending versus being individually distinguishable, music for driving, the explosion of subgenres, is it offensive or an easy/âsoothingâ listen? (1:06:25-1:14:37) How serious are their boastful self-descriptions on Bandcamp?, mystique, avant-garde, the slow return of live music post-Covid (1:14:37-1:17:17) ratings & comparison to their previous EP âCaudle Cameoâ (1:17:17-end)\n\nÂ\n\nCapillary Action is RIYL: Â Mike Patton, FZ, The Season Standard, Basset Hounds, Jouska, Head of Femur, pele, The Book of Knots, Hi Red Center, Need New Body, Volcano!, Zs, Make a Rising, Many Arms & other raucously ambitious acts on Tzadik. I hear Elvis Costello in his voice; OG hears Sinatra (!) & says Mr. Pfeffer mentioned Archie Shepp as a big influence.\n\nÂ\n\nThe Season Standard is RIYL: Mahogany Frog, Capillary Action, Phil Manzanera, Deerhoof (\"Xylan\" especially), T.J. Kirk, King Crimson\n\nÂ\n\nA great, insightful interview w/ Jonathan Pfeffer of CA in a source Iâd never heard of (about the previous album, âSo Embarrassingâ:Â http://www.tokafi.com/15questions/interview-capillary-action/ . Â\n\nâSo Embarrassingâ is NYP on Discorporate Records.Â\n\nÂ\n\nA cool rendition of âSweepstakesâ in an indoor overpass. Â\n\nÂ\n\nI would absolutely have loved to see a double bill of CA & UÅ¾ Jsme Doma in Madison, mentioned by OG as his first meeting of the bandleader.Â Hereâs the music video for âMarianaâ.Â They should have an album pick on a future OoO episode.\n\nÂ\n\nOG also mentioned Charlie Looker , Psalm Zero, and Extra Life.Â Mike Watt as a collaborator & jamming partner also comes up.\n\nÂ\n\nPitchforkâs reviewer does a good, thorough job with CA, comparing them both aptly and humorously to Need New\n\nThis is a new mini-feature weâre trying out for the first time, though it was intended to accompany the very first episode of OoO. Â The idea is to give a very personal review in conversation about a âbest ofâ or âessentialâ albums list in a particular style for a list from a semi-authoritative source online.\n\nÂ\n\nWe begin w/ this list of âEssential Power Pop Albumsâ:Â https://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-power-pop-albums/Â (If you want to play along, donât look at the list until after the episode.)\n\nÂ\n\nThe list is discussed album-by-album, with each cohost giving his or her personal hot take and receiving a numerical score in relation to it.Â The scoring is rather complicated, but I hope itâll eventually be second-nature and easy enough for listeners to tally their own scores.Â It also admittedly favors people w/ large collections of physical or digital media rather than those who just stream music (as it should, I say!)\n\nÂ\n\nSCORING FOR EACH ALBUM:Â Never heard of band & album (-5 pts); Heard of Band but not album (-4); Heard of both but not heard & don't own (0); Heard It (+2); Own It (+10); Own It But Haven't Heard It (+3); Used to Own (and Listened) But Don't Now (+5). Own a different/additional album by the same band +1 each.Â Saw live +2 each time, saw frontman live +1 each time.Â 10pt. bonus if you would have put an album on your own list in the category.Â 5pt. bonus if you're sure a band that is on the list would be on your list but a different album.\n\nÂ\n\nObviously the goal is to have a positive rather than negative total score by the end, and there can be some competition between the cohosts to establish credibility or even expertise.Â Listeners are strongly encouraged to post their own scores in the comments, and congratulations are owed to anyone who can best the cohosts.Â Youâll just have to listen to know our scores (no spoilers in the description!) and whether we can keep our heads above water.Â I expect some negative scores in the future.\n\nÂ\n\nIf youâve read this far, we will say that OG approved of the list more strongly than DJ Poseur, finding 80% in the 20th century to be an unfair bias.Â A list of DJ Poseurâs favorite power pop albums would definitely have included Starlight Mintsâ debut & a Self album (an actual list is probably not forthcoming, barring popular demand).Â Optimus Grimesâ score should get the 5pt. bonus for calling one entry âTHE quintessential power pop band.âÂ I failed to include it b/c this was the first time doing this mini-feature.\n\nÂ\n\nWelcome any feedback on whether this is more or less interesting to listen to than our usual mini-feature, The Obscurity Quiz, and if you know a good list (preferably of 10 albums) to use in a future edition.
