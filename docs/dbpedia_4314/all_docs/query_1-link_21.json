        "text": "The Atomic Bomb Audition plays Pink Floyd's \"Animals\" (again!)\n\nYour 2nd chance to hear us perform Animals in it’s entirety! After that…who knows when or if! Don’t miss it.\n\nHeco’s Palace\n\n7th & Peralta (West Oakland)\n\nDerek Monypeny\n\nZebra Secrets\n\nRey Bubby\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Audition\n\nView Event →\n\nFred Frith Trio + Heike Liss + special guest @ Big Ears Festival\n\n“…a five-way, free-improvisation pull that [is] both wonderful to behold and impossible to absorb.” -Washington Post\n\nIn their ongoing collaboration Drawing Sound, Fred Frith generates soundscapes while visual artist Heike Liss draws her images directly on windows. Liss works in a variety of media, including video, photography, drawing, sculpture, site-specific installation, and public intervention. She has collaborated with choreographers, musicians, multi-media artists, painters, and poets, and her award-winning work has been exhibited internationally in museums, galleries, and at film festivals. Frith (electric guitar) and Liss (visuals), along with Jason Hoopes (electric bass), Jordan Glenn (drums), and a special guest trumpeter, confront the difficulties specific to improvising in both visual and audio fields in a world where the visual is generally perceived as primary. How to avoid the music being taken as a soundtrack? Should the listeners/viewers be able to understand it from the same point of view as the creators? What is the equivalent of silence in images? How does a visual “gesture” correspond to a sonic one, or indeed should it? In the end, what kinds of interaction are possible or desirable?\n\nView Event →\n\nFred Frith Trio + Heike Liss + special guest @ Constellation (Chicago)\n\nDrawing Sound: Over the last twenty years, improviser and composer Fred Frith and visual artist Heike Liss have collaborated on a number of different projects including video installations, interventions and performances. More recently they have been improvising together in a variety of contexts. Liss has been developing and refining digital tools (using software based on Max MSP/ Jitter) that allow her to digitally paint and draw over projected videos, both pre-recorded and from live feeds. Frith continues to explore the essential parameters and limits of the musical “instrument”. In this work, they are confronting the difficulties specific to improvising in both visual and audio fields in a world where the visual is generally perceived as primary. In 2018 the project was expanded to include Fred’s trio with Jordan Glenn and Jason Hoopes, along with a special guest. In this configuration they have played in Brazil and numerous US cities, most recently at an acclaimed performance at The Victoriaville Festival in Canada in 2023.\n\nFred Frith (electric guitar)\n\nJason Hoopes (electric bass)\n\nJordan Glenn (drums)\n\nHeike Liss (live visuals)\n\nSpecial Guest\n\nView Event →\n\nHost Family (myself, Jordan Glenn, Karl Evangelista) + Everything Oscillating (Seattle) + Echo Specter\n\nOn 2/21, my long time partner in improvised rhythm section crime Jordan Glenn and I, with our long\n\ntime guitar-wizard brother Karl Evangelista, will be improvising a trio set at Elbo Room (Jack London).\n\nWe’ll be sharing the stage with another brilliant guitar-wizard friend (not to be missed!) on the road from Seattle, Dave Webb (Moon Letters / Cryptic Slaughter) and his band Everything Oscillating, along with Echo Specter.\n\nCome get yer head shredded!\n\nView Event →\n\nSludgebucket / Snakemother / The Atomic Bomb Audition\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Audition opens a heavy show, our first of 2024, with Sludgebucket and Snakemother at The Elbo Room in Oakland!

Lemaire)\n\n10 PM - $46\n\nHeike Liss: live visuals\n\nSusana Santos Silva: trumpet\n\nJason Hoopes: electric bass\n\nJordan Glenn: drums\n\nFred Frith: electric guitar\n\nIn addition to his undeniable qualities as a guitarist, improviser and composer, FRED FRITH is also a great teacher who likes to continue playing with his most gifted students. The FRED FRITH TRIO was formed in 2013, when he was teaching at Mills College in Oakland. His acolytes, JASON HOOPES and JORDAN GLENN, compose the rhythm section of the unclassifiable group Jack o' the Clock. Together, they developed a rich language, a sense of improvisation with rock roots that recall the indescribable synergy that reigned in Henry Cow.\n\nThey published two albums with Intakt, then the double Road album with two guests: Lotte Anker and SUSANA SANTOS SILVA. The latter, a Portuguese trumpeter residing in Sweden, has had a dazzling career lately, whether with her groups Impermanence and Life and Other Transient Storms or in her collaborations with Anthony Braxton and Evan Parker, among other big names.\n\nAn internationally renowned visual artist, HEIKE LISS regularly collaborates with the trio. She will put the music in images in an exercise of fusion of the senses.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Audition (record release!!) + Oxide\n\nGolden Bull\n\n412 14th St.\n\nOakland, CA\n\n94612\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Audition plays this show in celebration of the release of our new record on December 9th!!\n\nThe Atomic Bomb AuditionOxide\n\n21+\n\n$10\n\nView Event →\n\nFred Frith Trio US West Coast\n\nJune 16th w/ Las Sucias - Albany, CA @ The Ivy Room\n\nJune 17th w/ Jon Bafus, Jon Raskin, John Shiurba - Sacramento, CA @ Red Museum\n\nJune 24th w/ Matthew Edwards and the Futurists - LA, CA @ Zebulon\n\nJuly 2nd w/ TWANS - Portland, OR @ Kelly’s Olympian\n\nJuly 3rd w/ Wayne Horvitz, Sheridan Riley, Neil Welch - Seattle, WA @ The Royal Room\n\nView Event →\n\nFRED FRITH TRIO - EUROPEAN TOUR 2022\n\nThurs, March 5 - Ferrara, Italy @ Jazz Club Ferrara - Torrione San Giovanni\n\nSun, March 7 - Tel Aviv, Israel @ Levontin 7\n\nTues, March 9 - Brussels, Belgium @ Les Ateliers Claus\n\nWed, March 10 - Zürich, Switzerland @ Moods\n\nThurs, March 11 - Geneva, Switzerland @ AMR - Sud des Alpes\n\nFri, March 12 - Hall in Tirol, Austria @ Kulturlabor Stromboli\n\nSat, March 14 - Paris, France @ La Dynamo de Banlieues Bleues\n\nSun, March 15 - Wien, Austria @ Porgy & Bess Jazz & Music Club\n\nMon, March 16 - Prague, Czech Republic @ Punctum\n\nTues, March 17 - Wels, Austria @ Alter Schlachthof Wels\n\nWed, March 18 - Barcelona, Spain @ L´Auditori de Barcelona\n\nThurs, March 19 - Braga, Portugal @ GNRation - Blackbox\n\nView Event →\n\nAmendola / Evangelista / Hoopes @ Makout Room\n\nMonday, 3/2\n\n8pm (8:30pm start)\n\nNo Cover / Donations Accepted\n\nSet #1: Quartet (Lee/Nucci/Oba/Weeks) (free improvisation)\n\nhttp://kimnucci.com\n\nMichelle Lee, Kim Nucci, Erika Oba, Tom Weeks - bari sax, piccolo\n\nSet #2: Amendola Trio (rock/jazz/experimental)\n\nhttp://scottamendola.com\n\nScott Amendola - drums\n\nKarl Evangelista - guitar\n\nJason Hoopes - bass\n\nSet #3: Kasey Knudsen Sextet (modern jazz)\n\nhttps://www.bayimproviser.com/artist/357/kasey-knudsen\n\nKasey Knudsen - Saxophone\n\nHenry Hung - Trumpet\n\nRob Ewing - Trombone\n\nDahveed Behroozi - Piano\n\nMiles Wick - Bass\n\nEric Garland - Drums\n\nView Event →\n\nTarasov / Brown / Raskin / Hoopes\n\nVladimir Tarasov (drums)\n\nChris Brown (piano, electronics)\n\nJon Raskin (saxes)\n\nJason Hoopes (bass)\n\nA free improvising quartet performing in preparation for recording their first record!\n\nMore details TBA\n\nView Event →\n\nTarasov / Brown / Raskin / Hoopes\n\nVladimir Tarasov (drums)\n\nChris Brown (piano, electronics)\n\nJon Raskin (saxes)\n\nJason Hoopes (bass)\n\nA free improvising quartet performing in preparation for recording their first record!\n\nMore details TBA\n\nView Event →\n\nFred Frith Trio - European Tour 2019\n\nWed, Oct 16 - Warsaw, Poland @ Pardon To Tu\n\nThurs, Oct 17 - Skopje, Nord Macedonia @ Macedonian Opera and Ballet\n\nFri, Oct 18 - Köln, Germany @ Stadthalle Köln-Mülheim Jülich GmbH\n\nSat, Oct 19 - Bari, Italy @ TBA\n\nSun, Oct 20 - Padova, Italy @ Teatro Torresino\n\nMon, Oct 21 - Piacenza, Italy @ Conservatorio Giuseppe Nicolini\n\nWed, Oct 23 - Paris, France w/ Susana Santos Silva @ La Dynamo de Banlieues Bleues\n\nFri, Oct 25 - Coimbra, Portugal @ Teatro Académico de Gil Vicente\n\nSat, Oct 26 - Zürich, Switzerland @ Schlosserei Nenninger\n\nMon, Oct 28 - Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Germany @ Stromraum\n\nTues, Oct 29 - Wels, Austria w/ Lotte Anker @ Alter Schlachthof Wels\n\nWed, Oct 30 - Hall, Austria w/ Lotte Anker @ Kulturlabor Stromboli\n\nThurs, Oct 31 - Ebersberg, Germany w/ Lotte Anker @ Altes Kino Ebersberg e.V.\n\nSun, Nov 3 - Tampere, Finland w/ Susana Santos Silva @ Old Customs House / Tullikamarin pakkahuone\n\nView Event →\n\nFred Frith Trio - The Stone Residency + Beyond\n\nFred Frith, Jordan Glenn, and myself in residency at The Stone, performing with very special guests.

In composing for the DSE, Clifford finds the balance between long form compositional structures, free improvisation, and short ditties while still maintaining musical freedom for his immensely talented ensemble. The music reflects a wide range of influences, running the gamut from Kool Keith to Bela Bartok. The Dirty Snacks Ensemble released their first full length record, Tidy Universe (Recollect Records), in June of 2016, and released a follow up album of rarities and basement recordings, Another Man’s Treasure in March 2017. The Dirty Snacks Ensemble is currently recording their second studio record, You Would Do Well, which is set to be released in the spring of 2020.\n\nAmendola Trio is the sound of three as one: Scott Amendola playing drums/percussion/electronics; Karl Evangelista on guitar; and Jason Hoopes, electric bass. Playing music written by all members, they explore the song to the sound. Together they have a unique connection that brings the music to interesting places. Never the same twice.\n\nThe Peralta Annex is a standalone warehouse in West Oakland of brick and wood that our neighbors, a photographer and a writer, that on occasion open up to share within the creative community and celebrate their love of music.\n\nFollow The Dirty Snacks Ensemble\n\ninstagram\n\nspotify\n\nbandcamp\n\nsoundcloud\n\nView Event →\n\nActive Music Series\n\nActive Music Series presents:\n\nJordan Glenn/Jason Hoopes/Danishta Rivero/Sandy Buschman quartet\n\nSeiyoung Jang\n\nWilliam Winant/Karl Evangelista/Tom Djll trio\n\nView Event →\n\nEndangered Blood + Amendola / Hoopes / Evangelista\n\nThe four members of Endangered Blood are some of the most influential jazz musicians of their generation.

Bassist Trevor Dunn has been touring the world with MR. BUNGLE and FANTOMAS as well as entering the Guinness Book of World Records by playing fifty gigs in fifty states in fifty days as a member of the MELVINS LITE. Oscar Noriega is fast becoming one of the rising stars of creative music as a member of Tim Berne’s acclaimed Snakeoil quartet.

He has also performed and/or recorded with Anthony Braxton, Chris Brown, Fred Frith, Sam Rivers, Tim Berne, Phillip Johnston, Leo Smith, Vladimir Tarasov, Phillip Greenlief and Henry Kaiser.\n\nCHRIS BROWN, composer, pianist, and electronic musician, makes music with self- designed sonic systems that include acoustic and electroacoustic instruments, interactive software, computer networks, microtonal tunings, and improvisation. His compositions are designs for performances in which people bring to life the musical structures embedded in scores, instruments, and machines.

He is a Professor Emeritus at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he taught electronic music, composition, theory, and ethnomusicology for 30 years.\n\nJASON HOOPES is a musician and educator living in Oakland. He is bassist for Fred Frith Trio, Jack O’ The Clock, Scott Amendola Trio, and has been bassist for many diverse and forward thinking bay area groups including Annie Lewandowski’s powerdove, Eat The Sun (w/ Gretchen Jude and Noah Phillips), Rova Saxophone Quartet, and Kyle Bruckmann’s Degradient, as well as working with modern choreographers such as Peiling Kao and Molissa Fenley. In addition to music, Jason is a painter and poet.\n\nDescribed as a ‘percussive dervish’ (Coda) DONALD ROBINSON is a technical master of the drums. He is a stalwart of the of San Francisco bay area avant-garde jazz scene, playing and recording with many of the area’s improvisational players, from saxophonists John Tchicai, Marco Eneidi and Larry Ochs to koto player Miya Masaoka and pianist Matthew Goodheart, and with prominent visitors like Cecil Taylor, Wadada Leo Smith, George Lewis, trumpeter Raphe Malik and Canadian pianist Paul Plimley. Much of this work has featured the combination of Robinson and bassist Lisle Ellis as rhythm section: ‘the best bass-drums tag team on the scene’ (Jazz Times). His longest musical association, dating from the 1970’s, was with the late tenor saxophonist Glenn Spearman. During the early 1970’s he served his musical apprenticeship in the jazz world of Paris, studying with Kenny Clarke and playing with Alan Silva, Anthony Braxton, Oliver Lake and Bobby Few among many others.\n\nView Event →\n\nKyle Bruckmann's Degradient @ Uptown\n\nActive Music Series presents:\n\nNakatani Gong Orchestra\n\nKyle Bruckmann’s Degradient\n\nSharon Tate Fetus Explosion\n\n$5-15 sliding scale\n\nView Event →\n\nRova Sax Quartet & friends presents Cecil Taylor's \"Dark to Themselves\"\n\nRova:Arts will produce Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!, a special tribute concert in honor of the avant-garde jazz composer, pianist, and poet Cecil Taylor, who died on April 5 of last year. Last year Rova presented their first tribute to Taylor, a concert entitled Air. Next month’s affair will be more extensive and involve many more performers.\n\nRova’s primary contribution will be a reworking of Taylor’s Dark to Themselves, an album-length composition. For this endeavor they will be joined by four additional players, guitarists Jean-Paul Bourelly and Henry Kaiser, drummer Don Robinson, and Jason Hoopes on bass. Rova has expanded its resources in the past, and these enlarged groups have performed under the name Orkestrova.\n\nIn addition, the duo B. combo of Lisa Mezzacappa on bass and Jason Levis on percussion will present excerpts from Mezzacappa’s transcription of Taylor’s album Air Above Mountains. The program will then conclude with a second duo performance, coupling reed player Oluyemi with vocalist Ijeoma Thomas. They will present interpretations of Taylor’s poetry, as well as original works.\n\nThis tribute concert will be given only one performance, beginning at 8 p.m. on Saturday, April 20. The venue will be CounterPulse, which is located near Union Square at 80 Turk Street, just West of where Mason Street intersects Market Street.\n\nTICKETS (Box office opens at 7:15pm)\n\nView Event →\n\nDamo Susuki (CAN) @ Ivy Room\n\nCANCELLED\n\nView Event →\n\nAmendola / Hoopes / Evangelista @ Jazz in the Neighborhood\n\nAmendola Trio blends improvisation with music written by all three members.

We played a few gigs many months apart, always had a blast, invited a couple of awesome guests (Lotte Anker and Jessica Lurie) and didn't think much in conceptual or any other terms. It took playing night after night during our European tour of 2015 or some themes to start emerging. I appeared to be channeling some of my earliest rock and roll experiences – jamming with members of Pink Fairies in 1969, a couple of sad weeks in a band with Syd Barrett, and attending Gong and Pink Floyd concerts where I had the chance to absorb the lessons of Daevid Allen and Dave Gilmour. Earlier my electric guitar heroes had been George Harrison and Pete Townsend, and then – as my horizons broadened – Muddy Waters and Sonny Sharrock. McLaughlin's playing in Tony Williams' Lifetime had been a revelation. On tour with the trio these voices all started clamoring for attention, and Jason's stunning ability to wring everything there is to be wrung out of an electric bass was as liberating as Jordan's playful, irreverent, and absolute authority. Anything can happen. Really. It's a bloody great feeling.”\n\n-Fred Frith\n\nSaariselka\n\nThere is an old Norse myth that says the great northern glaciers stored energy until they burst with fluorescent light, creating the Aurora Borealis. Saariselka is inspired by the meeting of earth and light, where slowly moving land masses merge with enveloping light fields. This sonic collaboration is between composers Marielle Jakobsons (Fender Rhodes, organ, synthesisers) and Chuck Johnson (pedal steel guitar and treatments).\n\nhttps://longformeditions.bandcamp.com/track/ceres\n\nVoicehandler\n\nJacob Felix Heule: percussion\n\nDanishta Rivero: voice and electronics\n\nVoicehandler plays intuitive, incantatory music grounded in the most primitive and somatic instruments -- the voice and percussion -- juxtaposed with contemporary, disembodied electronics. We situate ourselves in our physical and social environment through our music. Our improvisations are shaped by their setting and context, and we use site-specific installations to more deeply experience spaces. We deconstruct song forms in relation to mythology and literature to explore our humanity and the shifting discourse surrounding it.\n\nhttp://heule.us/voicehandler/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVw9lCt9HMY\n\nhttps://humbler.bandcamp.com/\n\nHi res photos: https://drive.google.com/open?id=164BeM9Q6_kbGSvRFvbbhBiJ9P3dSgjEe\n\nView Event →"
