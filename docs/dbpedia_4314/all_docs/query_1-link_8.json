A swirling mix of utopia\n6. Do not follow your own shadow...\n7. ... Beyond the mist\n\nsilk-screened\r\nPHILIPPE PETIT &amp; friends \r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Post-Avant Jazz&quot; soundtrack FOR FANS OF Four Tet – Alice Coltrane - Efterklang - Kammerflimmer Kollektief – The Drift - Strings Of Consciousness...\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Silk-screened” documents another direction from French artist Philippe Petit, whose aim is to always surprise his listeners by releasing records which follow each other while not sounding the same. \r\nFor now he is taking us in a cinematic world of dense mixtures of acoustic instrumentation and digital filtering, swaying and unfolding in ways that blend together jazz, modern classical and post rock. \r\nPursuing a tradition he had started with his &quot;Reciprocess&quot; project, given away with The Wire magazine issue 301, Petit is benefiting from the talent of many of his friends-musicians without whom nothing could be possible and emphasising that according to him music is a collaborative affair.",
