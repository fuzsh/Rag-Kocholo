        "text": "Former Supersport TT winner Lee Johnston, is planning to reaffirm his competitive affiliation with the fabled, mythical Mountain Course, taking in the 2024 Manx Grand Prix.\n\nInjuries, poor luck have as in 2023, largely dented Johnston’s pure road racing ambitions.\n\nHe recently was back on racing duty (British Supersport – Brands Hatch), having at TT 2024, the Northwest 200 undertaken TV, radio commentary, pundit roles.\n\nLightweight class conqueror in 2018, his real roads comeback will include two-stroke action, astride the Reed Racing, RS 250 Honda.\n\n‘General’ Lee is also amongst the Classic Superbike entry-list, campaigning sweet sounding RC45 Honda machinery.\n\n29 years ago, the Formula 1 TT race in 1995 saw four of the top five finishers, Phillip McCallen, the icon that is Joey Dunlop, Nick Jefferies, Steve Ward, aboard one of Honda’s most acclaimed SBK inventions.\n\nWhilst these halcyon days are in the past, the RC45 remains a well liked, pretty-competitive steed and it’s going to be great to see it again this month, up against fellow exotic yesteryear SBK models from Kawasaki, Suzuki, Norton and Ducati.\n\nPhoto credit: Nick Wheeler\n\nWords by Stevie Rial #dontletfearcontrolyou"
