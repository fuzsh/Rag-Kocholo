It includes important works published here for the first time, reissues of out-of-print recordings, and new performances. With this issue, virtually the entirety of Partchs recorded ouevre is publicly available for the first time. Taken with the rest of the Enclosures Series and the Harry Partch Collection on CRI, we can now begin to assess Partchs whole output.\n\nContents:\n\nUlysses Departs from the Edge of the World - (1971 Orion LP, Jack Logan, trumpet)\n\nRevelation in the Courthouse Park - (1960, Gate 5 Records, Issue F)\n\nSpoken introduction to King Oedipus (KPFA-FM, 1954)\n\nKing Oedipus - (1952, Mills College premiere with W.B.

It is presented in the original version using the translation by W.B. Yeats. Although Partch considered this his most important work (it took 19 years to write) and an excellent performance (featuring the incomparable Allen Louw as Oedipus and Rudolphine Radilpupil of Mahleras Jocasta), it was never released because of a permission dispute;\n\nThe Bewitched (A Dance Satire) is a live recording from a 1980 performance in Cologne, West (then) Germany featuring an extraordinary ensemble (produced by Kenneth Gaburo for the Berlin Festival, with Danlee Mitchell, music director and Isabelle Tercero as The Witch).\n\nPartchs own spoken introductions to two of the works are included as well as an extensive booklet.\n\nOrder \"Enclosure Five\" from amazon.com\n\nHarry Partch: Enclosure Six [innova 406]\n\nAfter being out of print since the late 1970's, the original Columbia recording of Partch's masterwork Delusion of the Fury is now available. Through the ceaseless efforts of Philip Blackburn, and produced in cooperation with Sony Music Special Products division, Enclosure 6 is the latest in the Enclosure series, an impressive and irreplaceable contribution to the Partch legacy. If you don't know about Delusion, it represents the apex of both Partch's mature compositional development as well as his most fully realized corporeal music/theater piece.\n\nIn this new edition you can enjoy, in addition to the power and force of the music, Partch's original notes on the piece, some of his correspondences surrounding the original production, an essay by Danlee Mitchell (music director of the Delusion production and long-time Partch associate) on the importance of the historic 1969 production, and finally, after years of neglect, credits for the musicians involved -- all with Blackburn's usual high production and artistic standards.\n\nOrder \"Enclosure Six\" from amazon.com\n\nThe Harry Partch Collection: Volume 1 [Composers Recordings Incorporated (CRI) CD 751]\n\nThe Eleven Intrusions are among the most compelling and beautiful of Partch's compositions, the main product of a lonely, isolated period he spent in Gualala California. They are short instrumentals, often with poetry intoned by Partch. Plectra & Percussion Dances are three relatively unrelated works that Partch wrote in a brief period after his successful production of Oedipus. Though they draw on Greek themes, they are Partch's first major works for a larger ensemble that are more instrumental (as opposed to theatrical) in conception. Ulysses at the Edge was originally written for (though never performed by) the great jazz trumpeter Chet Baker whom Partch met through mutual friends in Illinois in the mid-1950s. It is a lively work in which Partch, once a homeless man, relates to another wanderer, Ulysses.\n\nContents:\n\nEleven Intrusions (1949-50)\n\nStudy on Olympos' Pentatonic\n\nStudy on Archytas Enharmonic\n\nThe Rose\n\nThe Crane\n\nThe Waterfall\n\nThe Wind\n\nThe Street\n\nLover\n\nSoldiers - War - Another War\n\nVanity\n\nCloud-Chamber Music\n\nPrincipal vocals: Harry Partch (Recorded 1950-51 Gualala, California)\n\nPlectra & Percussion Dances - Satyr-Play Music for Dance Theatre (1952)\n\nCastor & Pollux\n\nRing Around the Moon\n\nEven Wild Horses\n\nGate 5 Ensemble (Sausalito), Horace Schwartz, conductor (Recorded 1953, Sausalito, California)\n\nUlysses at the Edge (1955) Gate 5 Ensemble (Evanston) (Recorded 1958, Evanston, Illinois)\n\nMeadows note: One of the bonuses of this disc, along with Volume 2 and 3 in the series, is that the liner notes are by noted Partch scholar, Dr. Bob Gilmore. They are extensive, insightful, and add greatly to the value and experience of this important collection.\n\nOrder CRI Volume 1 from amazon.com\n\nThe Harry Partch Collection: Volume 2 [Composers Recordings Incorporated (CRI) CD 752]\n\nLiving as a hobo from the mid-1930s until 1943, Harry Partch traveled on cross continental trains, occasionally working at fruit picking in orchards on the Pacific coast and at W.P.A. jobs. The Wayward is a collection of four works written during this period which together ultimately led to Partch's recognition in the New York music world in the mid-1940s.\n\nU.S. Highball is an autobiographical account of thoughts and experiences of a solitary hobo on a long journey. San Francisco is a haunting musical memory of the cry of newsboys on a foggy night. The Letter is a setting of a letter Partch received from a hobo pal in 1935. Barstow is a setting of a hitchhiker graffiti that Partch copied down from a railing along the highway near Barstow, California.\n\nDating from 20 years later, And on The Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma represents a high point in Partch's instrumental writing, involving virtuosic writing for twenty-two Partch instruments. Petals was also the first Partch composition recorded for a \"commercial\" label (CRI in 1967).\n\nContents:\n\nThe Wayward:\n\nU.S. Highball - A Musical Account of a Transcontinental Hobo Trip (1943, rev. 1955)\n\nThomas Coleman as \"Mac\"\n\nGate 5 Ensemble (Evanston), Jack McKenzie, conductor\n\n(Recorded 1958, Evanston, Illinois)\n\nSan Francisco - a Setting of the Cries of Two Newsboys on a Foggy Night in the Twenties (1943, rev. 1955)\n\nHarry Partch, voice & instruments, with Danlee Mitchell and Elizabeth Gentry\n\n(Recorded 1958, Evanston, Illinois)\n\nThe Letter (1943, rev. 1972)\n\nHarry Partch, voice and instruments with ensemble\n\n(Recorded 1972, Encinitas and San Diego, California)\n\nBarstow - Eight Hitchhiker Inscriptions from a Highway Railing at Barstow, California (1941, rev. 1968)\n\nThe Harry Partch Ensemble, Danlee Mitchell, music director\n\n(Recorded 1982, Oakland, California)\n\nAnd on The Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma (1963-64, rev. 1966)\n\nThe Gate 5 Ensemble directed by Harry Partch\n\n(Recorded 1964, Petaluma, California)\n\nMeadows note:\n\nOrder CRI Volume 2 from amazon.com\n\nThe Harry Partch Collection: Volume 3 [Composers Recordings Incorporated (CRI) CD 753]\n\nCorporeality was a key component to Partch's aesthetic. He often intended his music to be one part of a greater artistic experience that also involved drama, film, dance, or even gymnastics. As such, the four works on this disc display Partch's theatrical and collaborative abilities.\n\nThe eloquent and affecting The Dreamer That Remains was Partch's last work. It was commissioned by the patroness Betty Freeman for her film on Partch which was directed by Stephen Pouliot. Rotate the Body in All Its Planes was a spin-off of the \"Tumble On\" sequence in Partch's large-scale theatre piece Revelation in the Courthouse Park. It was premiered at the National Collegiate Gymnasts Championship in 1961. Windsong was also written for film, the soundtrack to a film by Madeline Tourtelot in which Partch saw the Greek myth of Daphne and Apollo. (A later version of the work was named Daphne of the Dunes). Finally, somewhat akin to a Broadway musical, Water! Water! is perhaps Partch's most lively and lighthearted work. It pokes fun at many targets, especially the rush of audiences for water at the interval; thus the subtitle: \"An Intermission with Prologues and Epilogues.\"\n\nContents:\n\nThe Dreamer That Remains - A Study in Loving (1972)\n\nHarry Partch, intoning voice and narrator\n\nThe Harry Partch Ensemble, Jack Logan, conductor\n\n(Recorded 1972, San Diego, California)\n\nWindsong (1958)\n\nAll instruments played by Harry Partch\n\n(Recorded 1958, Chicago, Illinois)\n\nRotate the Body in All Its Planes - Ballad for Gymnasts (1961)\n\nFreda Pierce, solo soprano\n\nChorus and instrumental ensemble conducted by John Garvey\n\nWater! Water! - An Intermission with Prologues and Epilogues (1961)\n\nCast, Chorus and Gate 5 Ensemble (Urbana)\n\nJohn Garvey, conductor\n\n(Recorded 1962, Urbana, Illinois)\n\nMeadows note:\n\nOrder CRI Volume 3 from amazon.com\n\nThe Harry Partch Collection: Volume 4 [Composers Recordings Incorporated (CRI) CD 754]\n\nThe full-length work The Bewitched is satire at its most grand. Partch's dance drama stars a witch and includes choruses of \"the bewitched\" including a college fraternity and a basketball team among many others. The composer's own detailed synopsis and commentary (reprinted in the CD booklet) is at least as enjoyable as the prologue and ten scenes. Partch conceived and wrote the work in California, 1952-55, and this recording was made at the University of Illinois' Champaign-Urbana campus in 1957.\n\nContents: The Bewitched - A Dance Satire (1954)\n\nCast, chorus and ensemble conducted by John Garvey\n\n(Recorded 1957 Champaign-Urbana, Illinois\n\nMeadows note:\n\nOrder CRI Volume 4 from amazon.com\n\nNewband: Partch, Cage, La Barbara, Drummond [Mode 18]\n\nNewband - Dean Drummond, Artistic Director\n\nThis is the first of three available recordings by Newband (current custodians of the original Partch instruments), the ensemble led by Dean Drummond. This first CD contains only one short Partch composition, the Two Studies on Ancient Greek Scales and it is not the original Partch composition but a transcription for flute and one of Drummond's instruments, the zoomoozophone. The arrangement was done before Newband had the original instruments; now the Studies are represented in their original (preferred) form on CRI Vol. 2. You might be interested in the other music on this CD, but knowing his antipathy for the man and his compositional style, Harry is probably rolling in his grave being paired with John Cage -- two iconoclasts with little, if anything, in common.\n\nMeadows note: I don't currently have an online link; it is available from Newband directly.\n\nNewband Plays Microtonal Works by Partch, Pugliese, Drummond, Rosenblum, Monk [Mode 33]\n\nNewband - Dean Drummond, Artistic Director\n\nI happen to like this one better. This disc contains, again, just one Partch work -- Daphne of the Dunes. Newband sets forth with a clean performance and quality recording of the piece; objectivity is impossible for me, having played this piece many times with the Partch Ensemble, and I can hear little things to tweak, but this is recording represents the piece well.\n\nThe rest of the disc is a mixed-bag of contemporary works, and it's the least likely candidate that catchs my ear the most: Drummond's arrangement for zoomoozophone and cello of Thelonious Monk's 'Round Midnight. Not set in a smoky bar, but in a very alien environment, with the z-phone wafting like vapors. No saxophones in sight...\n\nMeadows note: I don't currently have an online link; it is available from Newband directly.\n\nDance of the Seven Veils [Music & Arts 931]\n\nNewband - Dean Drummond, Artistic Director\n\nThis last Newband CD also only contains one Partch piece, Castor & Pollux. So far, the best performance of this piece remains out of print, on the old \"The World of Harry Partch\" LP (which Drummond played on); the performance from the 50's on CRI Vol. 1 is somewhat inept and muddy, and this Newband performance, while clean and clearly recorded, lacks fire. Of the two available, though, I'd take Newband's.\n\nDean Drummond himself is growing as a composer, and the longer he has the Partch instruments the more the music seems to actually come from them instead of being laid on them. The title track is a nice blending of the original instruments with some newer ones, and it might catch your fancy; post-Impressionistic scenes inspired by author Tom Robbin's Skinny Legs and All.\n\nOrder Dance of the Seven Veils from amazon.com\n\nHarry Partch: 17 Lyrics of Li Po [Tzadik 7012]\n\nStephen Kalm, intoning voice; Ted Mook, tenor violin\n\nCellist Ted Mook and baritone Stephen Kalm present, for the first time, all 17 Li Po settings that Harry revised over a period of thirty years. This is Harry at his most intimate (the first Gate 5 recording containing some of these was entitled \"Thirty Years of Lyrical and Dramatic Music\"). The amount of work involved in preparing these 17 settings was enormous, and Ted obviously cared about the project very much. Ten of these 'songs' are included on Enclosure Two, with Harry Partch (adapted viola) performing with vocalist William Wendtland. The differences between the two are significant.\n\nThe quality of this recording is, of course, far superior, and it appears that, technically speaking, the Mook/Kalm performances are more accurate (judging by the intonation between cello and voice). Whether accuracy is the ultimate benchmark is left to the listener. I simply offer this thought: Stephen Kalm possesses a lovely voice, in a Western European art-song style. While listening to this recording I keep conjuring images of the pristine salon culture and blue hair that Harry abhorred and avoided. For me, and for this reason, it just doesn't work, and I say this after an initial warming to their performance; maybe I was just happy to hear all 17. I am now spouting ambivalence, but it is a difficult call: the CD has a place in a collection for completeness, but I have a hard time offering support for the effort, noble as it may be.\n\nMeadows note: The booklet with the CD wins, hands down, the award for the worst combination of color choices and microscopic type-setting -- it is nearly impossible to read!! I therefore recommend, if you would like to peruse the lyrics to the Li Po settings, you see our page entitled Lyrical Partch, which has the poems write there on your CRT.\n\nOrder Li Po from amazon.com\n\nJust West Coast - Microtonal Music [Bridge 9041]\n\nJohn Schneider (guitar) with Amy Schulman\n\nThis CD includes both the Two Studies on Ancient Greek Scales (adapted for guitar and harp) and the only recording of the first version of Barstow, for guitar and voice. Also contained are microtonal pieces by Harrison, Young and Cage.\n\nI know that for John Schneider the Barstow project was a long labor of love, and that he went to incredible lengths to resurrect this version, including having a guitar custom adapted/made for the piece. I also know that he listened to Harry perform the piece. I know this from a wonderful article he wrote about the experience. So I recommend it, but with some hesitations (not including my long-standing problem with transcriptions).\n\nThis was recorded pretty soon after John had resurrected the piece, and I don't think he had enough time to \"inhabit\" the character of the lives contained theirin. It lacks the sense of waiting in the high desert at a guardrail for a ride: sad, desperate, lonely, giddy people that Harry filled in the cracks with fantasy. There is not enough dirt, little sweat. But, again, that may be me, overly familiar as I am. Your mileage may vary...\n\nOrder Just West Coast from amazon.com\n\nGenesis of a Music: An Account of a Creative Work, Its Roots and Its Fulfillments\n\nby Harry Partch\n\nDa Capo Press, 1979 (second edition reissued in paperback)\n\nHarry Partch is legendary as the quintessential American experimentalist and instrument inventor. He broke away from the European tradition of tonality, tonal structure, and instrumentation to such an extent that Jacques Barzun, intellectual historian, could say, \"I happen to think that only in music have truly new directions been found, and that these are two and only two: electronic music and the 43-tone works and instruments of Harry Partch.\" Partch invented a 43-tone scale, thereby providing a definitive model for microtonality, and he invented the instruments to play his music in that scale. This book can be read as both manifesto and explanation of his theories of tuning and instrument-building. The first version of this book was written in 1947, then enlarged to a second edition in 1972 which was published by Da Capo Press in 1974. This book is a reprint of that edition. 517 pages, photos, illustrations. Size 6\" x 9\". Da Capo\n\nOrder \"Genesis of a Music\" from amazon.com\n\nHarry Partch: A Biography\n\nby Bob Gilmore\n\nYale University Press, 1998\n\nBob Gilmore has written a superb biography of Harry Partch, one of the most original composers, instrument builders, and theorists of the 20th century. This book, based largely on interviews with Partch's associates and research in Partch's archives, is the first to tell the complete story of Partch's life, including his youth in the southwestern United States, his early musical education, his interest in speech intonation and rhythm, his immersion in hobo culture during the depression, and his relationships with the artworld. The book also tells the story of Partch's interest in intonation and instrument-building.\n\nOrder \"Harry Partch: A Biography\" from amazon.com\n\nEnclosure Three [innova 402: 5-lb artbook]\n\nby Dr. Philip Blackburn\n\nWinner of a 1998 Deems Taylor Special Citation\n\nA full-length portrait of an unconventional life, Enclosure Three (ISBN: 0-9656569-0-X) is a luxury limited-edition (800 copies, the first 200 autographed), 528-page, lavishly-illustrated, hardcover art-, bio-, scrapbook of Partch. It is the first biography of one of America's most original and influential artists told through over 1,000 facsimile documents in his own words: 330+ photos; essays; sketches; scores; correspondence with Anaïs Nin, W. B. Yeats, Edmund Dulac, John Cage, Lou Harrison, Martha Graham, Alwin Nikolais, Bruce Goff, Kenneth Anger, and Ben Johnston.\n\nPartch's life touched many of the central characters in American twentieth century art, literature, theater, architecture, film, dance and music. For Partch fans and neophytes alike, Enclosure Three contains essential source material for all those interested in unusual lives, Depression-era Americana, cultural history and creative educational approaches.\n\nContents: (include the following satires, writings, and commentaries by Partch himself)\n\nA Modern Parable 1 and 2\n\nThe Umbilical Chord Still Vibrates\n\nOn G-String Formality\n\nKPFA lecture series\n\nManual on the Maintenance and Repair of  and the Musical and Attitudinal Techniques for  Some Putative Musical Instruments\n\nSome Old and New Thoughts After and Before The Bewitched\n\nDrawings from Bitter Music and End Littoral\n\nBach and Temperament\n\nThe Kithara\n\nBarstow\n\nMusicians as Artists\n\nNo Barriers\n\nThe Ancient Magic\n\nA Somewhat Spoof\n\nToward a Ritual Music Consciousness\n\nVerbal Scenarios for Cry From Another Darkness (Delusion of the Fury), The Dreamer That Remains, The Bewitched, and other incomplete works\n\nMeadows note: This book is the twin-child of Bob Gilmore's biography; the two work in tandem as one to fill out a portrait of an artist in a more complete manner than may have been accomplished previously. To see Partch's words flow, year after year, as he struggles, nay, mud wrestles with his muse and his demons, is extraordinary. I have a small homage to Enclosure Three elsewhere on the site, but it is hard to do a work like this any justice at all. Of what will sure to be, at some point, legendary value.\n\nOrder \"Enclosure Three\" from amazon.com\n\nBitter Music: Collected Journals, Essays, Introductions, and Librettos\n\nby Harry Partch (ed. and with introduction by Thomas McGeary)\n\nUniversity of Illinois Press, 1991\n\nBitter Music presents Partch's ideas about the place of music in society, his work as a composer, his compositions, and his unique instruments. The anthology opens with \"Bitter Music,\" a journal Partch kept while he wandered the American West as a transient during the Depression. Partch himself had thought the journal was lost. Deeply personal, it provides important biographical information on a formative period in his life and hints at the insecurity that pervaded his career, the institutional support he enjoyed one year and the economic hardship he endured the next. An important work of American Depression literature, the journal is unique for its inclusion of musically notated speech and folk and popular music. A second journal, \"End Littoral\" records a hiking trip along the rugged California coastline.\n\nThe anthology also offers twelve essays detailing Partch's provocative analysis of the relation of music and the composer to society. Two are published here for the first time; the others appeared in often obscure or ephemeral publications between 1941 and 1972. Included as well are twelve extended discussions by Partch of his own compositions, in the form of introductions or program notes, of which ten are published here for the first time. The anthology concludes with librettos or scenarios for six of his major narrative or dramatic compositions.\n\nOrder \"Bitter Music\" from amazon.com\n\nHarry Partch: An anthology of critical perspectives\n\nEdited by David Dunn\n\nHarwood Academic Publishers, 2000\n\nFirst off, a fine and long-awaited entry into the academic book category. Editor David Dunn was an assistant to Partch and, to many ears, the Adapted Viola player that best captured Harry's sound on the instrument. A composer, researcher, author and artist in his own right, Dunn has compiled mostly writings scattered elsewhere and in obscure publication, while adding a couple of new items. Of prime interest is the introductory essay: Reflections, Memories and Other Voices, a dialogue between Dunn and the musician closest to Partch, Danlee Mitchell. Other chapters include analysis of his works, essays from other composers (Ben Johnston, Lou Harrison), interviews and dialogues, and a couple of Partch essays. Along with a nice selection of photos, there is a bonus CD which contains an interview and part of a broadcast from the preparations for Delusion of the Fury.\n\nDunn writes of the book: \"It has been my intention, in the editing of this anthology, to walk a middle line which reflects upon the significance of Partch's work while respecting the inclusive nature of his philosophical assumptions. Rather than resolving the inherent complexities of the work, this collection of critical perspectives emphasizes the often extraordinary contradictions surrounding, and deeply embedded within, the man and his work. It is my contention that these very contradictions account for the vitality that his life and music exuded.\"\n\nCorporeal Meadows rarely walks a \"middle line\", and I have sharp disagreements with some of the authors in this book; everyone must decide for themselves, and knowledge and experience are the engines of the decision making process. Coming from an academic publishing house, it isn't cheap, but for the true seeker and completist, recommended.\n\nOrder \"Harry Partch: An anthology of critical perspectives\" from Amazon.com\n\nHarry Partch: The Early Vocal Works 1930-33\n\nby Bob Gilmore\n\nBritish Harry Partch Society, 1996\n\nThis special edition publication of Gilmore's Ph.
