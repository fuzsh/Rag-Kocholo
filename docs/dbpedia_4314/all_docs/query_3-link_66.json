        "text": "FRIONA - The town of Friona might well be the only town in Texas who has maintained a summer drama workshop for 55 years. Although it might be not be the first place one would imagine a successful drama workshop being held, they have been hosting kids and teens and building confidence, talent and friends for five decades. The two-week summer event has turned into more than just a drama basics camp; it has bonded families and friends for generations.\n\nIn fact, the leading role, or “Great One” of the camp itself, is an active 86-year-old, Joy Morton, who has a twin sister, Gay, who works along with her in the wardrobe and costume area. She loves her job and has taught, or coached, hundreds of kids, many of whom are now teachers and have kids who return to the workshop.\n\n“She is royalty around the state and has judged many one-act plays and debates. I drove her around for a couple of contests she was judging (when Randall High School was involved), and one of the teachers said, ‘How do you know Morton?’ I said, 'oh, I’ve known Granny Joy all my life, she’s like family,'” said Jamie Lewellen, Executive Director of the workshop.\n\nJoy Morton had been a drama/debate teacher at Friona for some 43 years and was well known in the area world of theater and drama, a kind of “star” to her proteges, when she began the workshop five decades ago. She said she started it when one of the hometown boys who was doing some work in Broadway came home to visit his mother. They did a musical and then expanded to include little kids.\n\nNow, the workshop includes three directors for three groups: K-5 in the mornings, 6-8 grade in the afternoons and high school kids in the evenings. She said they had welcomed directors from Austin, Houston and from all around the state through the years.\n\n“It’s a good time for kids to connect without cellphones,” Joy said. “I take them up in a little box and keep them until class is over. We have an excellent group of junior high kids who help with the little ones setting up props and working with them. Almost the whole junior high cast comes in for the morning to help.”\n\nAnother contributor is Allison Johnson, choir director, who directed the little kids from 1998 til 2021. She still plays piano and helps out but doesn’t have time to direct.\n\nOne of the graduates of the program, Phillip Duggins, used to do a cruise ship thing and had his own theater in Houston. Another graduate, Mindy Johnson, graduated in 1992 and went to SMU and took the technical route to get her SAG card. Then she auditioned people for cruise ships and now works with conventions. She lives in Nashville, and she was there to watch her nieces, Lillian and Amelia, participate in the Friona program, along with her sister, Abbey Cramer.\n\nFamily ties enjoy the spotlight\n\nTwo sisters, Holly and Brooklynne Johnston, are part of three generations of actors and two generations of directors and currently participate in the workshop that takes place every year after the Fourth of July. Holly recalled one year when they travelled back from Houston with 10 cousins in her mother’s car, which was an Escalade. Brooklynne said they would cram \"a million and two suitcases\" in the vehicle, along with the kids, and she would fold up like a chair in the back.\n\n“At the end, the parents drove up and saw their final show and then drove back,\" she said. \"One of my cousins would get depressed for two weeks afterwards because she wanted to stay so bad.”\n\nWhen the Johnston sisters weren’t involved in the plays, they would act as stage managers. They have both been the directors of the elementary students for the last three years.\n\n“Lots of the kids come from out of town and this is the only time they get to see each other. When they’re older, they can text and email and keep in touch but the little ones miss each other and are happy to see one another each year.”\n\n“The thing to me,” said Jamie Lewellen, who functions as a coordinator and Executive Director and has been involved since she was 5 years old, “is that this workshop creates lifetime friends. This is how I met the Holly and Broolynne. I was friends with their family. I was a senior in high school when Holly was born and there are pictures of me holding her. And now she’s getting married. Both sisters are choir directors in the Amarillo school system.\n\n“It helps kids get confidence. One of the junior high girls was really shy at first and would barely talk but now she is full-blown drama. She did one-act plays in high school and served as director and now is at University of Texas in the drama program. One little boy came for his first time and cried the whole time but now he’s one of our main actors.”\n\nJamie’s daughter, Sophie, is also involved in the workshop and is currently in the junior high section but helps out during day. Jamie is married to the mayor of Friona, who also enjoys the play. The workshop takes place in the Friona High School which recently received additional colored stage lights and a new computerized light console, which Holly operates.\n\nThe two-week event costs only $25 and there is a cap for families with more than two kids participating. Students stay in Friona with local families or relatives and form lifetime memories. Every year, starting in April, the three directors decide which play they want to direct and let Jamie know. She applies for performance rights and pays the royalty fee and the play is shipped to them. After the Fourth of July, they hold a casting call and check the students for their positions in the play. Since many of them return, directors have a good idea of how to choose the plays depending on their talents.\n\nWith 55 years behind them, and many budding actors waiting in the wings, the group hopes to keep the show going on for another 55 years."
