        "text": "With the release of the Tzadik back catalog to streaming platforms, we now have an opportunity to catch up with the prolific output of John Zorn and others. This series attempts to highlight a handful of the more notable releases from each year. It is by necessity incomplete and many excellent albums will not be covered.\n\nRed Fiction – Visions of the Void (2020)\n\nRed Fiction is the brainchild of Jason Schimmel, long-time guitarist of Secret Chiefs 3. On Visions of the Void, he drops 11 tracks that vary dramatically in style and scope from moment to moment. Red Fiction touches on so many genres that it is easy to get lost among them. Metal, jazz, math rock, improv, klezmer, Eastern European folk, and even a touch of spaghetti western and noir are represented. Underlying the tracks are instrumental experimentation, including field recordings and unconventional studio techniques. The album exhibits a progression, from frenetic circular themes reminiscent of John Zorn’s Masada books played with heavy guitar, to tenor sax wailing over baritone sax and arpeggiated guitar chords, to shades of Mr. Bungle, to a spacious and melodic pair of tracks to cap things off.\n\nWyxz – ODYX (2020)\n\nWyxz’s debut album ODYX probably fits into the broad genre of progressive rock. And chamber rock. And technical metal. And math rock. And it probably could be slapped with a few other labels as well. Wyxz has Ben Coniguliaro playing drums, guitar, bass, piano, keyboard, and glockenspiel. His brother, Quinn, helps out on guitar, bass, and percussion. Matt Stober plays vibes on one track, Alex Verbickas also offers up guitar lines on another, as does Matt Hollenberg on two more. But a few listens give the distinct impression that this is a solo project, with Ben Coniguliaro handling the vast majority of the chores. Having said that, ODYX full of dizzying and never-ending changes in tempo, timing, and theme. Coniguliaro and company navigate labyrinthine riffs and micro-melodies that rarely last more than a few seconds. Keyboards and guitars duel in contrapuntal lines that challenge Zappa’s The Black Page and John Zorn’s short-attention-span moments in complexity. If anything, the completely over-the-top nature of ODYX can easily engulf the unprepared listener. But give the album a try or two, as its all-out assault is part of its charm.\n\nSam Eastmond / Spike Orchestra – Splintered Stories (2020)\n\nI first heard Spike Orchestra as contributors to John Zorn’s recent Masada efforts, and certainly appreciated the group’s take on his compositions. But in Splintered Stories, we have an opportunity to point out where Eastmond is both similar and different. Not unlike Zorn, Eastmond merges and blends styles, from free jazz to swing, rock to klezmer. This takes the form of heavy chording, marches, open-ended blowouts, as well as numerous powerful and distinct melodies that often overlap with one another. But Eastmond’s writing tends to tell stories and feature logical progressions that vary from Zorn’s approach. Assisting Eastmond is an army of performers with emphasis on walls of horn and reed-based instruments, as well as electric guitar, piano, bass, and drums. Case in point, Matriarch Variations includes a baritone sax solo over horn and reed explorations that are both jagged and playful. Then the rhythm section cuts in to support a multiphonic set of soloing backed by wandering rhythms and themes. The piece finishes up with a classically-oriented and percussive piano solo before returning to one of its main motifs. There is a plethora of activity on this album that takes time to unpack. Well done.\n\nJohn Zorn – Calculus (2020)\n\nLike many recent Zorn recordings, Calculus features other musicians playing his compositions, this time a piano trio. The rhythm section consists of long-time Zorn collaborators Trevor Dunn and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums, respectively. Brian Marsella mans the lead instrument. The scope and variety exhibited by each of the two 20-minute tracks are nothing less than remarkable. Marsella, Dunn, and Wollesen move fluidly from jazz, to atonal workouts, to lounge music, to chaotic breaks. Indeed, like its mathematical namesake, these pieces are all about change. While all of this dynamism can make the music come across as disjointed, anyone familiar with Zorn’s output over the last 40 years will not find it to be distracting. If anything, this particular style is ear candy for anyone with a knack for patterns and who does not require the repetition that most musical forms employ. Attentive listeners may recognize fragments that are similar to melodies or rhythms from Zorn’s other recordings."
