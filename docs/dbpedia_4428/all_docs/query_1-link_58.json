        "text": "Over the past three years, Scottish Fuels has increased its marine lubricants customer base by more than 600%. The increase is a result of re-introducing Castrol Marine Oil back into Scotland, says the company.\n\nScottish Fuels became the sole distributor of Castrol Oil to the marine trade in Scotland, after the company was awarded the inshore marine contract in 2009. Since then, the company has seen the number of customers using Castrol Marine rise from 23 to 139.\n\nThe steady customer growth has been attributed to Scottish Fuels’ 18-strong team which has been applauded in a recent Castrol report, for providing the highest standards of customer service compared to its other distributors.\n\nAndrew Salton, lubricants manager at Scottish Fuels, said: “At Scottish Fuels, we recognise that in the marine industry, the key to efficiency is reliability and ensuring we stock and effectively deliver the best products.”\n\nwww.scottishfuels.co.uk\n\nReturn to emailshot http://www.andpublishing.co.uk/fueloilnews.co.uk/email/index.php"
