        "text": "The definition of a premise includes land and mobile plant but does not include vehicles or vessels. Storage at all marinas (inland and coastal), on banks or on pontoons must comply with the regulations. Tanks in these locations should also be secured to prevent them lifting or floating away in the event of unusually high tides or floods.\n\nOil storage on barges at coastal marinas comes under the jurisdiction of the harbour master and as such is not covered by these regulations. The storage of petroleum is additionally controlled by the Petroleum Consolidation Act and a license is required from the petroleum licensing authority, usually the Fire Service or Local Authority Trading Standards Department. There may also be local bye-laws in place for inland waterways.\n\nNo. The oil within transformers is being used rather than stored.\n\nHowever, bulk tanks for storing these oils are regarded as oil in storage and will come under the requirements of the regulations unless otherwise exempt. Some transformer header tanks may come into this category if they are connected directly to the transformer by means of a 'one way - tank to transformer' feed pipe. If the transformer has an expansion tank (where oil leaves the tank and enters the transformer and on expansion leaves the transformer and re-enters the tank), the container is regarded as being part of the transformer with oil in use and is therefore not stored and does not come under the regulations. However, in order to minimise the risk of polluting the water environment we recommend following the requirements of the regulations where possible.\n\nTransformers in storage awaiting installation or disposal are not generally regarded as oil storage containers for the purposes of these regulations but it is good practice to provide secondary containment where there is a risk of oil spillage.\n\nIt depends on whether the oil is being stored or used.\n\nThe regulations apply to generators where the oil is being stored rather than used, and where no exemptions apply. They will therefore apply to stand-by generators which are storing oil for later use.\n\nWhere a generator is in regular or constant use and its day tank is of a capacity such that the oil will be used during an operating day, the oil will be regarded as 'in use' and the regulations will not apply. But if oil is not all used up in the operating day it will be regarded as being stored and the regulations will apply.\n\nEven if the regulations do not apply the potential for environmental harm from an oil spill remains and we therefore recommend that all generator tanks and pipe work are provided with secondary containment as good practice.\n\nThere is some confusion about the terms ‘double skinned’, ‘integrally bunded’, ‘twin walled’ and ‘bunded’ plastic and steel tanks in relation to above-ground oil storage, and which are environmentally acceptable.\n\nUnfortunately manufacturers and suppliers of these tanks have used a variety of these terms with different interpretations. Our explanations follow:\n\nA ‘double skinned tank’ is a primary tank with another ‘skin’ placed around it and a very small gap between the two. None of the pipe work or ancillary equipment is contained. The risk of oil being lost from ancillary equipment and pipe work is high, so the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (as amended) requires that tanks have all ancillary equipment such as sight gauges, taps and valves retained within a secondary containment system.\n\nDouble skinned tanks are not compliant with the regulations unless additional secondary containment is provided for the tank and its ancillary equipment, such as an in-situ constructed bund.\n\nProprietary tank systems come in a large range of designs and are produced by many different manufacturers who may make certain claims about the environmental performance of their products. To prevent the confusion described above, ‘Proprietary Tank System’ or just ‘Tank System’ is the preferred generic term for tanks often referred to as integrally bunded or twin walled. Some tanks systems may have adequate secondary containment to comply with regulation requirements, but some may be regarded as ‘high specification primary containers and would therefore be non-compliant without additional containment.\n\nSome proprietary integrally bunded tank systems take the volume of the primary tank into account when calculating secondary containment capacity, and provide additional secondary containment capacity of less than 110% of actual primary tank capacity. This is generally acceptable where, if there was a leak in the primary container, oil could find its own level in both containers. In this instance the primary container contributes to the total containment capacity, which as long as it totals 110%, will be acceptable. A similar position is achieved in a conventional bund, where the tank is situated low down.\n\nThe regulations state that the secondary container ‘must have a capacity of not less than 110% of the containers storage capacity...’, but this can be interpreted to mean that the secondary container must be ‘capable of containing 110% volume of the primary container and, where applicable, the volume provided by the primary container can be taken into account’.\n\nAn important issue in determining if a tank system is acceptable is whether the ancillary equipment is adequately dealt with, such as being within the secondary container, which is where some tank systems have fallen down in the past.\n\nYes, the regulations state that the secondary containment system \"must have a capacity of not less 110% of the container's storage capacity\". The volume provided by the primary container can be taken into account where applicable. Most proprietary tank systems are designed so that the oil finds its own level in both containers if the primary container leaks. In this instance the primary container contributes to the total containment capacity. A similar position is achieved in a conventional bund where the tank is situated towards the bottom.\n\nHowever, you should take into account that such systems may only provide a 10% containment capacity in the event of overfilling. For example, a maximum volume delivery made to a tank more than 10% full will result in a loss of oil from the secondary container. The use of an overfill prevention device is good practice and you should consider these or other additional pollution prevention safeguards, such as additional containment capacity.\n\nAnother important issue in determining if a proprietary tank system is acceptable is whether the ancillary equipment is adequately managed, such as being within the secondary container, which some proprietary tank systems may not provide.\n\nIt depends on what exactly is meant by loaning and what agreements and conditions are attached to the loan. A company supplying an unbunded tank to a customer would not necessarily be in breach of the regulations because it is the customer who has custody or control of the oil (not the tank). A company supplying tanks without bunds is unlikely to be in breach of the regulations, subject to any agreement/contract regarding the loaning of the tank.\n\nWe would urge customers to insist on being supplied with bunded tanks to reduce their liability under the regulations. A supplier could provide a tank that was not bunded for a user to install in a bund. The ultimate responsibility must rest with the site operator who has custody or control of the oil."
