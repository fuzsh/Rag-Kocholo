        "text": "New Top up fuel service\n\nTop up service suits my needs as I’m always sure that the fuel will not run out as this is a holiday let and I’m not always in a position to check the levels. It’s working well\n\nDate of experience : July 20, 2024\n\nA satisfied customer\n\nI wasn’t at home when the fuel was delivered, but had every confidence in the delivery man and his attention to the refill.\n\nI have always used Scottish Fuels during these past 30 years, and have never had cause to seek an alternative supplier.\n\nI confess to not being aware as to SP’s performance on price comparison, but I trust the company and assume that I am charged a fair price.\n\nThe process of ordering the fuel from Certas was easy and flawless - a professional response. Thank you.\n\nDate of experience : July 09, 2024\n\nComplete Turn Around From Last Purchase\n\nMade an order over the phone for heating oil, may I give praise to the pleasant,professional woman who answered my call. The oil was delivered within the week by another pleasant and professional man. Very happy after a nightmare of service I recieved previously. Well done all.\n\nDate of experience : July 19, 2024\n\nCalled early in morning saying I had…\n\nCalled early in morning saying I had run out of house fuel but there was no real rush as I was going to sea. Went shopping for an hour and it had been deljvered before I returned. Excellent service.\n\nDate of experience : July 23, 2024\n\nVery helpful staff, easy to work with\n\nThey offered a good service which adapted to technical issues. It was above and beyond my expectations so I highly recommend their service...\n\nThe only downside was the clumsy manual filler nozzle!\n\nDate of experience : July 16, 2024\n\nReply from Scottish Fuels\n\nGood morning - Thank you for taking your time to leave your positive feedback. I'm so so sorry to hear this, I have passed your feedback over to the relevant department. Kind regards, Scottish Fuels\n\nStaff were very helpful and as I was…\n\nStaff were very helpful and as I was anxious I was low on oil they arranged an urgent delivery. As it was, it appears the oil was fine and their projected next delivery was correct.\n\nDate of experience : May 31, 2024\n\nthe Delivery driver is extremely…\n\nthe Delivery driver is extremely efficient and very pleasant as well, helpful and friendly, it's a pleasure to meet with him. Equally the lady who dealt with the payment was incredibly efficient and helpful, again a real pleasure to speak with her. You should be proud of your staff, they make us want to come back.\n\nDate of experience : June 26, 2024\n\nI did not shop for prices but just…\n\nI did not shop for prices but just accepted the offer. I hope that after previous orders I was given the best (cheapest) price.\n\nI ordered and the following day the oil was delivered.\n\nI hope to get the same service in winter.\n\nDate of experience : July 11, 2024\n\nMy neighbour and myself ordered at the…\n\nMy neighbour and myself ordered at the same time to help reduce costs and carbon footprint. The driver arrived at my house without enough oil left onboard to fill my tank. My neighbour had a delivery a couple of days later and then a few days after that I had my final amount delivered. 3 visits that should have been done in 1 very poorly organised.\n\nDate of experience : July 16, 2024\n\nReply from Scottish Fuels\n\nGood Morning Ken - I am so sorry to hear this, please accept our sincere apologies. I have passed your feedback over to the relevant department. Kind regards, Scottish Fuels"
