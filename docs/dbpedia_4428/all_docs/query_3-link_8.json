        "text": "Governance\n\nThe Scottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel was established as an Non-Departmental Public Body (NPDB) from 19th September 2019 under the Fuel Poverty (Scotland) Act 2019.\n\nThe Panel members were appointed into position from 1st January 2022.\n\nThe Panel provides independent expert advice to Scottish Ministers. It does not employ staff or hold a budget. The Scottish Government makes resources available to the Panel, including a dedicated secretariat, to ensure the Panel is able to undertake its role. Its members are appointed by Scottish Ministers.\n\nThe Framework document sets out the relationship between Ministers, the Scottish Government and the Panel.\n\nWe will publish this document in due course.\n\nBudget\n\nThe Scottish Government has made funds available to the Scottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel for 2023/24.\n\nWe will update this page with the exact budget that has been made available soon.\n\nRemuneration\n\nThe Chair of the Scottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel is entitled to receive a fee of £208 per day for a time commitment of 15 days per annum. The member roles attract a remuneration of £156 per day for a time commitment of 12 days per annum.\n\nScottish Ministers may, exceptionally, approve additional remuneration for the Chair or Members for a particular financial year, if it is necessary in order for them to perform their functions and successfully deliver the Panel’s objectives.\n\nThe Chair and Members may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, such as travel costs, that arise from their appointment to the Panel.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nEach public body in Scotland is obliged to have a Code of Conduct for their appointed Members, to reflect the functions and characteristics of the individual body. These individual Codes are approved by Scottish Ministers and adapted from a Model Code of Conduct approved by the Scottish Parliament."
