        "text": "The climate and nature crisis is the greatest long- term global challenge that we face. The clean energy transition represents a huge opportunity to generate growth, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and give Scotland and the UK energy security once again. That is why clean energy by 2030 is Labour’s second mission.\n\nThe Conservatives have failed to grasp opportunities in this area for two related reasons. First, because they simply do not accept that economic growth, energy security, lower bills, and addressing climate change can be complementary. Second, because they are ideologically opposed to using the role of the state, including public investment, to guarantee that they are.\n\nThe damage done by 14 years of chaotic ‘sticking plaster’ policies was exposed when Putin invaded Ukraine. The cost of fossil fuel energy on the international market rocketed. The Conservatives’ neglect of the UK’s energy infrastructure – and the SNP’s failure to deliver on its own commitment to a public energy company or to improve the energy efficiency of homes – landed Scottish families with among the highest energy bills in Europe. That is just one way we are paying the price. While countries around the world are racing ahead to claim the jobs and wealth that the transition offers, Scotland is losing out.\n\nBut it is not too late. Scotland has tremendous untapped advantages: our long coast-line, high winds, shallow waters, universities, and skilled offshore workforce combined with our extensive technological and engineering capabilities developed in the North Sea. With a serious industrial strategy and a genuine partnership between the public and private sectors, Labour is determined that we can still make Scotland and the UK a clean energy superpower.\n\nLabour will take decisive action to seize this economic opportunity. We will shape markets and use public investment to crowd in private funding. At the heart of our approach will be our Green Prosperity Plan where, in partnership with business through our National Wealth Fund, we will invest in the industries of the future. Our plans to harness clean power and invest in home insulation upgrades will deliver the lower bills, good jobs, energy security, and climate leadership Scotland needs.\n\nLabour will provide leadership at home so we can influence others to ensure every country plays their part in meeting our collective obligations to future generations.\n\nLabour will also tackle the nature emergency, where Scotland’s peatlands, forests and natural habitat play an essential role. We will improve access to nature, promote biodiversity, and protect our landscapes and wildlife.\n\nLabour understands the route ahead – we have been clear that this transition presents an opportunity to create good jobs, with no community left behind, and well-paying jobs in existing energy industries. The Conservatives and SNP propose an alternative course which denies reality, delays action and will increase costs for Scotland with greater insecurity and the continuation of jobs and supply chains being offshored. Communities in Scotland are still scarred by the damage the Conservatives did in the 1970s and 1980s with this same chaotic approach. Labour is setting out a different choice, with a plan that will secure the energy jobs of the future in communities across the country.\n\nFamilies and businesses will have lower bills for good, from a zero-carbon electricity system. We have chosen this mission not because it is easy, but because working people can never again be left vulnerable to dictators like Putin.\n\nTo deliver our clean power mission, Labour will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. We will invest in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and marine energy, and ensure we have the long-term energy storage our country needs. A new energy act will establish the framework for Labour’s energy and climate policies.\n\nLabour will end a decade of dithering that has seen the Conservatives duck decisions on nuclear power, while the SNP opposes its development in Scotland completely. Nuclear power currently provides up to 23 per cent of the electricity consumed in Scotland and will need to remain part of our energy mix if we are to achieve energy security and clean power in Scotland. A UK Labour government will ensure the long-term security of the sector UK-wide, extending the lifetime of existing plants. New nuclear power stations in England and Small Modular Reactors will play an important role in helping the UK achieve clean power while securing thousands of good, skilled jobs. Scottish Labour believes Scotland should not miss out on the economic opportunity that nuclear energy offers.\n\nUK Labour will maintain a strategic reserve of gas power stations to guarantee security of supply. We will ensure a phased and responsible transition in the North Sea that recognises the proud history of our offshore industry and the brilliance of its workforce, particularly in Scotland and the North East of England, and the ongoing role of oil and gas in our energy mix.\n\nWe will embrace the future of energy production and storage which will make use of existing offshore infrastructure and the skills of our offshore workforce. Labour will not revoke existing licences and we will partner with business and workers to manage our existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. Crucially, oil and gas production in the North Sea will be with us for decades to come. The North Sea will be managed in a way that does not jeopardise jobs and our offshore workers will lead the world in the industries of the future.\n\nA UK Labour government will not issue new licences to explore new fields because they will not take a penny off bills, cannot make us energy secure, and will only accelerate the worsening climate crisis. In addition, UK Labour will not grant new coal licences and will ban fracking for good.\n\nTo support investment in this plan, Labour will close the loopholes in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Companies have benefitted from enormous profits not because of their ingenuity or investment, but because of an energy shock which raised prices for families. Labour will therefore extend the sunset clause in the Energy Profits Levy until the end of the next UK parliament. To deliver greater fairness for households struggling with the cost of living, a UK Labour government will also increase the rate of the levy by three percentage points, as well as removing the unjustifiably generous investment allowances. We will also retain the Energy Security Investment Mechanism.\n\nTo drive forward investment in clean, home-grown energy production, Labour will create a new publicly-owned company, GB Energy. It will be owned by the taxpayer and deliver power back to the public.\n\nGB Energy will partner with industry and trade unions to deliver clean power by co-investing in leading technologies; will help support capital-intensive projects; and will deploy local energy production to benefit communities across the country. To support this, Labour will capitalise GB Energy with £8.3 billion over the next parliament.\n\nThe company will create jobs and build supply chains in every corner of the UK. Scotland will be the powerhouse of our clean energy mission, with GB Energy headquartered here so it can harness the expertise and experience of Scotland’s world-renowned energy industry.\n\nLocal power generation is an essential part of the energy mix and reduces pressures on the transmission grid. UK Labour will deploy more distributed production capacity through a Local Power Plan. GB Energy will partner with energy companies, local authorities, and co-operatives to install thousands of clean power projects, through a combination of onshore wind, solar, and hydropower projects. Communities across the country will be invited to come forward with projects, and Labour will work with local leaders and the Scottish Government to ensure local people in Scotland benefit directly from this energy production."
