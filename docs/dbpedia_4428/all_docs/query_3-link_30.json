The regular ‘member update’ e-mails are priceless for keeping our TÜV SÜD staff up-to-date with developments and help us identify new opportunities. Being part of the Hydrogen Scotland member network has been invaluable for TÜV SÜD. We frequently take advantage of Nigel’s unrivalled knowledge to connect us with other members in this growing hydrogen sector. Don’t delay, join today!\n\nThe team have been instrumental in ensuring that Scottish-based SMEs like Logan Energy have a platform to be heard within government and industry. In addition to this invaluable support, the regular news bulletins, information and networking events allows members to effectively collaborate and ensure that Scotland remains at the forefront of the global hydrogen economy.\n\nWhen things get tough, going to one of SHFCA events, asking for a connection, or even just chatting with another member picks you up, puts you back on your feet and reminds you that through collaboration with a shared goal, we can help to change the world – together!"
