This is to ensure that no part of the country is left behind.\n\nThere are also interim targets set for the same metrics for 2030 and 2035. However the interim targets only need to be met at a national level.\n\nScottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel\n\nThe statutory Scottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel was established in January 2022. Members appointments were announced at the end of 2021. The panel provide external scrutiny of our progress towards meeting the fuel poverty targets.\n\nWe continue to work closely with the panel and other key stakeholders to progress delivery of our strategy towards our 2040 fuel poverty statutory targets. The panel also work alongside and collaborate with the Poverty and Inequality Commission to shape advice to Scottish Ministers.\n\nFuel poverty definition\n\nScottish legislation describes a fuel poor household as one where:\n\nmore than 10% (20% for extreme fuel poverty) of net income is required to pay for their reasonable fuel needs after housing costs have been deducted\n\nthe remaining household income is not enough to maintain an acceptable standard of living, defined as at least 90% of the UK Minimum Income Standard (MIS) once childcare costs and disability or care benefits are deducted\n\nThe legislation provides for uplifts to be applied to the MIS for households rural and island communities to take into account the higher cost of living in these areas."
