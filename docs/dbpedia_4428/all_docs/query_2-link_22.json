        "text": "Mura Technology (London) announced a continuation of the collaboration with WMG at the University of Warwick and Innovate UK (IUK) to continue their work on sustainability with a new IUK funded, two-year Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP).\n\nWMG will develop operational sustainability models for Mura’s Hydro-PRT advanced plastic recycling technology to identify opportunities for further improvements to the already sector-leading environmental performance of the process. Mura has already identified an annual carbon emissions saving of 40,000 tonnes at the first Hydro-PRT site in Wilton, Teesside, due to commence operations in 2024.\n\nMura Technology is an advanced recycler of waste plastics, producing fossil-equivalent recycled hydrocarbon feedstocks from post-use, mixed, multi-layered flexible and rigid plastics for the petrochemicals industry to create virgin-grade plastics, such as for use in food packaging. Mura’s patented, innovative next generation processing technology, Hydro-PRT, produces high quality hydrocarbon feedstocks with sector-leading sustainability attributes, creating a low carbon and circular model for a range of stakeholders working with polymers.\n\nThe company’s first commercial scale plant, at Wilton, Teesside, will become the world’s largest advanced recycling plant when it commences operations later this year, with two further plants being built under license with partners in South Korea and Japan, expected to come online by the end of 2024. Driven by increasing regulation on plastic waste, Mura has a global growth ambition for more than 1.5 million tons of recycling capacity in operation or development by 2032. KBR announced a $100-million investment in Mura in 2022. Other industrial partners include Dow, Chevron Phillips and Mitsubishi Chemical.\n\nWMG will create a modelling platform that will operationalise sustainability at all future Mura project sites, including Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), to demonstrate transparently how Hydro-PRT meets environmental requirements. The platform will be used to educate and inform stakeholders including global regulators, policy makers and the plastics value chain on the low carbon potential of Hydro-PRT.\n\nThe KTP is the continuation of the IUK Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging research partnership, where Reader of Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing at WMG, University of Warwick, Dr Stuart Coles successfully developed and published Life Cycle Analysis models, independent of Mura, for the Hydro-PRT process and the UK waste plastic recycling ecosystem. Dr Coles will also be the academic lead on this project.\n\nSimon Broome Innovation Manager at WMG, University of Warwick, who co-wrote the application for the project, said: “I was blown away by the potential of this project to transform the process for recycling contaminated waste plastic. The team are highly committed and have already demonstrated impressive growth on their journey to make real sustainability gains in this important material sector.”\n\nMura’s Head of Sustainability and R&D, Dr Geoff Brighty, said: “Continuing the collaboration with WMG is critically important to bring this new science into our core business operation. Hydro-PRT has sector leading sustainability credentials, but every prospective site will be unique, influenced by the local energy grid, plant configurations as well as its material supply chain. The KTP project models will inform options appraisals and decision making, ensuring sustainability is at the heart of our global growth program.”"
