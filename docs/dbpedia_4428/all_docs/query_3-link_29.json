When an employee has to go out of their way to fill up, it takes a lot of time. They need to drive to the fill station, fill the vehicle, and drive back to the facility. To avoid this, you can either choose on-site fueling tanks or Tevis Energy’s fleet fueling options.\n\nHigher Risk of Fueling Accidents When Refueling Vehicles at a Retail Pump Station\n\nThe risk of a collision is highly possible when driving to the fill station, leading to a significant cost to the company. When a collision takes place, the insurance provider may send out a poor insurance rating. One of the absolute best ways to avoid this problem is to use Tevis Energy’s on-site fueling services or our fleet fueling solutions.\n\nRisk Of Running Out Of Fuel in Scotland\n\nNo business wants to have reduced productivity and downtime as a result of running out of fuel. This can possibly be a huge financial impact and could be easily avoided. Our solution is to install tank monitors. A Tevis Energy type monitoring system signals our office when your tank(s) is reaching a critical level to be refueled.\n\nWater Contaminating Fuel Systems\n\nWhen you use either construction, manufacturing, farming, or even industrial equipment, it runs hot from working hard throughout the day. As a consequence, when you are finished working with your equipment, you shut it down and it starts to cool. This results in the development of condensation, which can wreak havoc on your equipment. This condensation leads to corroded lines and also injectors. It plugs filters and creates the ideal environment for the development of bacteria. This produces a situation of sludge in your fuel system.\n\nOur remedy is EcoPro Fuel Additive. This decreases water accumulated by condensation and it reduces corrosion and/or sludge formation.\n\nSludge and/or Corrosion in Diesel Fuel Systems\n\nUnfortunately, fuel systems that are contaminated result in lost productivity, downtime, and also an increase in equipment repair work and maintenance. As in the case of water contamination, our approach to handling sludge and corrosion issues in your diesel equipment is EcoPro Fuel Additive.\n\nDiesel Fuel Gelling in Scotland’s Cold Weather\n\nWhen temperature levels are low, the wax molecules, found in diesel fuel, can gather to form a gel-like substance. When this occurs, it leads to downtime and even more equipment expenditure. To avoid gelling, you can utilize EcoPlus Fuel Additive.\n\nPoor Control of Fuel Dispensing in Scotland\n\nWithout a supervised, on-site fuel solution or a fleet fueling solution, businesses encounter fuel loss as a result of employee theft. Also, companies tend to spend more in taxes when they utilize on-road diesel for their off-road vehicles. In addition, accounting and tracking is far more difficult to deal with.\n\nGive Tevis Energy a call right now to learn more about our FuelCloud system and Fleet Fueling options as a means to have seamless productivity and lessen company costs.\n\nComplete the form below to learn more about becoming a Tevis Energy heating oil delivery customer:"
