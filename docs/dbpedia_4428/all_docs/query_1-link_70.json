        "text": "The commercial extraction of North Sea oil began on the shores of Scotland in 1851, when Scottish chemist James Young began mining the black stuff in Scotland’s Midland Valley. However, it wasn’t until the 1970s that North Sea oil became a political hot potato, when it was discovered offshore, bringing great wealth to the UK government.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are 5 fascinating facts about Scotland’s North Sea Oil reserves.\n\n5. There are approximately 15 - 24 million barrels of oil remaining\n\nDespite wide-spread claims to the contrary, exploratory programs in the North Sea region have identified 11.4 billion barrels of oil remaining so far. Increased investment and investigation is likely to lead to further discoveries. Such investment is being pursued by the current UK government, who have promised to prioritise Scottish energy interests over the coming years.\n\nThe estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of an oil well is the process of estimating how much cumulative oil can be mined from that particular well over the entire course of its lifespan. You can read all about EUR in this article: How to Estimate the Ultimate Recovery of an Oil Well.\n\n4. The remaining oil reserves are worth in excess of a trillion pounds\n\nCurrent valuations are based on projected markets, which suggest the remaining North Sea oil is worth approximately £1.5 trillion. As global oil reserves decline, oil prices will soar, encouraging many to argue in favour of investment in renewable energy sources. The expansion of the global economy has already resulted in higher oil prices: during the 1990s, oil was worth approximately $10 a barrel - last year, a single barrel of oil was likely to set you back $112.\n\n3. North Sea oil is likely to last for several decades\n\nWhile environmentalists may encourage us to shift our attention away from the North Sea and onto more renewable energy sources, North Sea oil reserves are unlikely to run out for several decades. The UK government, in particular, insists that oil has a future “well beyond 2055”, while energy expert Doctor Richard Pike predicts a further century of North Sea oil.\n\nCommentators argue that the profits generated by North Sea oil over the coming decades should be invested in renewables. In this respect, North Sea oil may represent both an environmental challenge and an environmental opportunity.\n\n2. Westminster have wasted North Sea oil profits\n\nIn the past, successive UK governments have wasted the income generated by North Sea oil and gas reserves. Neither Labour nor Conservative governments have managed to establish an “oil fund”, though both have conceded that this was a big mistake.\n\n1. More than 90% of UK oil and gas revenue is generated in Scotland"
