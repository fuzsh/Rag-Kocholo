Using your data in this way does not affect your data protection rights.\n\nGetting Winter Heating Payment does not affect any other benefits you may get, such as Winter Fuel Payment.\n\nWhen you get it\n\nYou'll automatically get the single payment between December and February. This does not depend on how cold it is.\n\nYou'll get a letter or an email from Social Security Scotland telling you it's coming. It appears as 'WHP' on your bank statement, WHP stands for Winter Heating Payment.\n\nIf you think you missed it\n\nIf your data does not automatically result in a payment, a Social Security Scotland will:\n\nlook at your data again\n\nconsider whether you are eligible or not\n\npay you if you are eligible or\n\nwrite to you to explain their decision"
