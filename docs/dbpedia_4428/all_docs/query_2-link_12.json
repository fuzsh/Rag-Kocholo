        "text": "1. Overview\n\n1.1 What this notice is about\n\nIt tells you when you can use rebated diesel, biodiesel or kerosene in vehicles and other machinery.\n\n1.2 What is rebated fuel\n\nDiesel (also known as gas oil or DERV) is normally liable to the full rate of excise duty.\n\nThere are circumstances where a particular vehicle or machine may be able to use fuel taxed at a reduced (rebated) rate of excise duty. This is because of the type of vehicle or machine, and the purpose it’s being used for.\n\nWhere a rebate of excise duty has been allowed, fuel must be marked to show that the lower rate of duty has been charged and paid.\n\nA mix of chemicals is used to mark the diesel, and this includes a visible red dye. For this reason, diesel taxed at the rebated rate of excise duty is sometimes known as:\n\nred diesel\n\nmarked diesel\n\nmarked gas oil\n\nThe rebated rates of excise duty are shown in the rates and allowances list as ‘Marked gas oil’.\n\nBiodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) are diesel quality fuels derived from biomass. HVO is treated the same as heavy oil under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, and both of these fuels are liable to the same excise duty rates as diesel.\n\nThey can also be supplied at a reduced duty rate for the same uses as diesel, if all the requirements that apply to diesel are applied. They must be marked and can only be supplied by a registered dealer in controlled oils (RDCO). HVO can be fully rebated for heating use only if both been:\n\nrefined to meet the kerosene specification\n\nmarked with the kerosene marker\n\nFor this notice, references to using red diesel include using rebated:\n\ndiesel\n\nbiodiesel\n\ndiesel bioblend (produced by mixing diesel and biodiesel)\n\nhydrotreated vegetable oil\n\nKerosene is a heavy oil that may also benefit from a fully rebated rate. Rebated kerosene must also be marked and can be used only for generating heat for use in or on premises.\n\nKerosene bioblend (produced by mixing kerosene and biodiesel) also benefits from a fully rebated rate if it is intended to be used for generating heat.\n\nBioblend means a fuel produced by mixing biodiesel with heavy oil that has not yet been charged with fuel duty. Mixing biodiesel with heavy oil, such as diesel or kerosene, after the duty point does not produce bioblend. For example, rebated biodiesel cannot be mixed with rebated kerosene and to be used for commercial heating.\n\n1.3 Who should read this notice\n\nAnyone who:\n\nuses or supplies rebated diesel, biodiesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil or kerosene\n\nhas a vehicle or machinery that may be allowed to use rebated diesel, biodiesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil or kerosene\n\n1.4 The law covering this notice\n\nUK law:\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (HODA)\n\nThe Customs and Excise Management Act 1979\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil Regulations 1973\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil (Repayment of Rebates) Regulations 1996\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil (Marking) Regulations 2002\n\nThe Excepted Vehicles (Amendment of Schedule 1 to the Hydrocarbon Duties Act 1979) Order 2013\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil (Marking) (Amendment) Regulations 2007\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil (Marking and Designated Markers)(Amendment) Regulations 2015\n\nThe Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994\n\nFinance Act 2021\n\nFinance Act 2022\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2022\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2022\n\nThe Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Marking And Designated Markers) (Amendment) Regulations 2023\n\n2. When you can use rebated fuel\n\n2.1 Excepted machines\n\nCertain types of vehicle and machinery, when being used for a particular purpose, can use rebated fuel. These are known as ‘excepted machines’.\n\nAny vehicle or machine that is not an excepted machine cannot use rebated fuel.\n\n2.2 Vehicles\n\nThe types of vehicles that can use red diesel are:\n\nvehicles designed to operate on a railway\n\nagricultural vehicles\n\nspecial vehicles\n\nmowing machines\n\nunlicensed, including SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification) vehicles\n\nBut only when they’re being used for qualifying purposes, for example:\n\nfor agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming or forestry\n\non land maintained by a community amateur sports club (CASC)\n\non a golf course or driving range\n\non land occupied by a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\nNot all the qualifying purposes apply to all the vehicle types.\n\nYou should check that your vehicle, when being used for a particular purpose, is entitled to use red diesel.\n\nSpecific details on the acceptable uses of each type of vehicle are given in section 3.\n\n2.3 Vessels\n\nAll types of boats and marine transport, except for private pleasure craft, are expected machines and can use red diesel for any use.\n\nPrivate pleasure craft are not excepted machines. They can use red diesel in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), only if the user makes a declaration of how much fuel they’ll use for propulsion, and pays full excise duty on that amount.\n\nPrivate pleasure craft in Northern Ireland cannot use red diesel for propulsion.\n\nFor more details read Fuel used in private pleasure craft and for private pleasure flying (Excise Notice 554).\n\n2.4 Machines and appliances for heating and electricity\n\nMachines and appliances being used primarily to generate heat and electricity for premises that are not used for commercial purposes can use red diesel.\n\nA kerosene heating system is an excepted machine when it is being used to generate heat for any premises.\n\nThese uses are explained in section 7 of this guide.\n\n2.5 Other machinery\n\nOther machinery, engines, or appliances can use red diesel when being used:\n\nfor purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming, arboriculture, or forestry, and for any other purpose on land where it is used for any of these purposes\n\non a golf course (including a driving range) or land maintained by a community amateur sports club\n\nto operate or maintain equipment in a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\n3. Vehicles that may use red diesel\n\nThere are 2 elements to be considered when deciding if a vehicle is an excepted machine that can use red diesel. They are:\n\nwhat type of vehicle it is\n\nwhat it’s being used for\n\n3.1 Types of vehicle\n\nMany of the vehicles described in these paragraphs will be classed as ‘special’ or ‘agricultural’ vehicles by the DVLA, but this does not confirm eligibility to use red diesel.\n\nTo use red diesel, a vehicle must meet the specifications in, and be used only as allowed by the excepted machine categories listed in Schedule 1A to HODA.\n\n3.2 Agricultural vehicles\n\nTo be an ‘agricultural vehicle’ and use red diesel, the vehicle must meet one of the following 4 definitions, and be used for a purpose defined in paragraph 3.3.\n\nIt must be one of the following:\n\na tractor\n\na single-seat vehicle of no more than 1,000kg that is designed and constructed mainly for off-road use\n\na vehicle only used for agricultural, horticultural or forestry purposes, that is licensed by the DVLA to use public roads only when passing between 2 areas of land occupied by the same person, and that distance is less than 1.5 kilometres by road\n\na vehicle with permanently attached or built-in machinery used for handling or processing agricultural, horticultural, aquatic farming or forestry produce or materials — this category includes vehicles such as combine harvesters, crop sprayers, forage harvesters, pea viners, mobile seed cleaning machines and feed milling machines\n\nVehicles designed mainly for carrying goods, produce, and implements are trucks. They’re not agricultural vehicles even if the goods, produce, or implements being carried are for, or a result of, an agricultural activity.\n\nIn principle a Unimog would be classed by DVLA and HMRC as a truck and the previous paragraph will apply to it.\n\nWe would consider a Unimog to be a tractor for the purposes of HODA only if it:\n\nhas only front seats, for driver and no more than 2 passengers\n\nhas no load bay or only has an open load bay\n\nis licensed as an agricultural machine and used only as an agricultural tractor as described in paragraph 20B(2) of Schedule 2 to the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994\n\nA Unimog can also be an agricultural vehicle if it has permanently attached or built-in machinery used for handling or processing agricultural, horticultural, aquatic farming, or forestry produce or materials.\n\n3.3 When an agricultural vehicle can use red diesel\n\nAn agricultural vehicle defined in paragraph 3.2, can use red diesel when being used for:\n\npurposes relating to agriculture (including aquatic farming), horticulture or forestry\n\ncutting verges, hedges or trees that border public roads\n\nclearing or otherwise dealing with frost, ice, snow or flooding including when the vehicle is going to or from the place where it’s used for these purposes, and for collecting and returning the necessary equipment and materials\n\nAgricultural vehicles can also use red diesel when being used for any use on:\n\nprivate land where it’s normally kept to be used mainly for any of the purposes in the previous paragraph — for example, if a farmer or agricultural contractor keeps an agricultural vehicle on their own, or anyone else’s land mainly for agriculture use, they can use diesel in it for any other purposes on that land\n\na golf course, driving range, or land maintained by a community amateur sports club, where it’s kept\n\nRead section 12 for what we mean by activities falling within:\n\nagriculture\n\nhorticulture\n\naquatic farming\n\nforestry\n\n3.4 Special vehicles\n\nA special vehicle is a vehicle of any weight that is designed, constructed and used as mentioned in Schedule 1 part IV to the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, on the legislation website.\n\nThis covers such vehicles as:\n\ndigging machines\n\nmobile cranes\n\nmobile pumping vehicles\n\nworks trucks\n\nroad rollers\n\nWhere a special vehicle is used for a purpose set out in paragraph 3.5, it can use red diesel for that purpose and to travel to and from the place where it’s used.\n\nOther than weight, it must meet the specifications of, and be used in accordance with the restrictions described in the relevant part of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994.\n\nFor example, a digging machine, mobile crane or mobile pumping vehicle must not carry any load when used on public roads, except when it is necessary for its propulsion or operating the vehicle’s equipment.\n\n3.5 When a special vehicle can use rebated diesel\n\nA special vehicle defined in paragraph 3.4, can use red diesel only when it is used:\n\nfor purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming or forestry, including when it’s going to or from the place where it’s used for these purposes\n\non a golf course (including a driving range) or on land maintained by a community amateur sports club (read paragraph 7.8), including when it’s going to and from one of these places where it is used\n\n3.6 Unlicensed vehicles\n\nA vehicle is ‘unlicensed’ if:\n\nyou have submitted a SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification)\n\nit became untaxed before 1 February 1998\n\nit’s an unregistered vehicle that has never used the public road\n\n3.7 When an unlicensed vehicle can use red diesel\n\nAn unlicensed vehicle can use red diesel if it is being used:\n\nfor purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming, or forestry as long as it is not on a public road\n\non a golf course, driving range, or on land maintained by a community amateur sports club\n\non land occupied by a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\n3.8 Vehicles used between different parts of sports grounds\n\nWhere a vehicle is entitled to use red diesel because it’s being used on a golf course, driving range or community amateur sports club. It can also use rebated fuel when crossing a road that runs between 2 parts of the course or community amateur sports club land, by the shortest practicable route.\n\nThis does not apply to unlicensed or SORN vehicles if the road is a public road.\n\n3.9 Trains\n\nAny vehicle designed to be operated on a railway within the meaning of section 67(1) of the Transport and Works Act 1992 on the legislation website, can use red diesel.\n\nThis does not include:\n\ntrams\n\ncooling or heating units or other equipment mounted in or on railway carriages or freight wagons, except where these draw their power from the same engine that propels the vehicle\n\n4. Other machines and appliances\n\nAny other machine or appliance (that is not a vehicle or a vessel) can use red diesel when it’s being used:\n\nfor purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming or forestry\n\nfor purposes relating to arboriculture\n\nto operate or maintain equipment in a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\nfor generating electricity or heating primarily for use in or on non-commercial premises\n\nA machine or appliance (that is not a vehicle or a vessel) can also use red diesel when it’s being used for any purpose on:\n\nprivate land where it’s kept and used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming or forestry — for example, a farmer who keeps a machine on their own, or anyone else’s, land that they use in agriculture, can use the machine for any other purposes on that land\n\na golf course, driving range or land maintained by a community amateur sports club\n\nA kerosene heating system can use rebated fuel for generating heat for any premises.\n\nA machine or appliance should only contain rebated fuel if it’s being used, or was last used, for one of these purposes.\n\nA machine or appliance is liable to seizure and financial sanction, if it is found containing rebated fuel that should not be in it.\n\n5. Vessels and so on\n\nAll types of boats and ships can use red diesel at any time, except for private pleasure craft.\n\nA machine or appliance that is permanently on a boat or ship can also use red diesel. This does not include any machine or appliance on a private pleasure craft that uses the same fuel supply as the engine that propels the craft.\n\nPrivate pleasure craft\n\nThe definition of a private pleasure craft is given in section 11 of Fuel used in private pleasure craft and for private pleasure flying (Excise Notice 554).\n\nA private pleasure craft is not entitled to a rebate on fuel used for propulsion.\n\nFor this situation, users of private pleasure craft in:\n\nGreat Britain can fill up with red diesel, but must declare the amount that will be used for propulsion, and pay full duty on that amount\n\nNorthern Ireland that have only one fuel tank for propulsion and non-propulsion, must fill up with full duty-paid (white) diesel, but their supplier, if registered with us to do so, can allow and claim back a discount equal to the rebate, on 40% of the fuel supplied to allow for non-propulsion\n\nFor more details read Fuel used in private pleasure craft and for private pleasure flying (Excise Notice 554).\n\nMachines used for launching lifeboats\n\nA charity operating lifeboats can use red diesel in their tractors or gear they use to launch or haul in their boats.\n\n6. Mowing machines\n\nA mowing machine is a vehicle or machine designed only for mowing grass.\n\nYou can use red diesel in a mowing machine when it’s being used on:\n\nland maintained for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming or forestry\n\na golf course or on land maintained by a community amateur sports club\n\nland occupied by a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\n7. Terminology we use when describing excepted vehicles and machines, and allowed uses\n\nThis section explains what we mean by some of the terms we use to describe excepted vehicles and machines, and allowed uses in sections 3 to 6.\n\n7.1 ‘Built in’ or permanently attached\n\nBuilt in refers to equipment or features designed to be incorporated as an integral part of a vehicle, rather than being separate.\n\nThe equipment should perform the main function of the vehicle, such as:\n\nlifting\n\npumping\n\ndigging\n\nprocessing\n\nWe would expect these features not to be easily or quickly detachable.\n\nSeparate equipment, supporting apparatus and optional accessories are not considered built in, if they were not designed to be an integral part of the vehicle, but are simply attached to, or mounted on it for security or ease of transport.\n\n7.2 Using fuel in a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance\n\nUsing fuel in a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance means using it as fuel for:\n\nthe engine that propels a vehicle or vessel\n\nthe engine that powers a machine or appliance\n\na furnace or boiler contained in any machine or appliance\n\nAny machine or appliance on or in a vehicle is treated as a separate machine if it is not powered by the engine that propels the vehicle.\n\nWe do not permit any ‘dual tank’ fuel system that allows a vehicle or other machine to swap between:\n\nrebated fuel\n\nunrebated fuel\n\n7.3 ‘When being used for’\n\nThe types of vehicles and machines detailed in sections 3 to 6 can only use rebated fuel when being used for certain purposes (such as agriculture).\n\nThis includes the times when the vehicle is not actually in use, for example, a vehicle which has been used for an agricultural purpose today can have rebated fuel in its tank after use.\n\nA vehicle or machine that is not being used should not have rebated fuel in its tank unless it:\n\nis only used for allowed purposes\n\nwas last used for an allowed purpose\n\nIf you hire out vehicles, machines or appliances used for both allowed and non-allowed purposes, you will need to either:\n\nflush out the fuel tank to remove all traces of rebated fuel when switching uses\n\nmake sure your machines use full duty paid fuel for all uses\n\nYou’ll need to manage how you control the type of fuel your customers use. If you allow customers to use rebated fuel for qualifying purposes in your vehicles, machines, or appliances, you must make sure it does not have rebated fuel in it, if it’s then used for a non-entitled use.\n\n7.4 ‘Necessary for propulsion or operation of equipment’\n\nThis means goods, material, or equipment the vehicle must carry because it could not reasonably be operated without it.\n\nThis can include fuel, lubricants, and tools necessary to make adjustments, or to do any maintenance while the vehicle is being used.\n\nIt also includes any equipment required to comply with health and safety regulations, such as:\n\ncones to mark out a safe work zone\n\noperators’ personal protection equipment\n\nAny other goods, materials or equipment not directly needed for the propulsion of the vehicle or operation of the vehicle’s equipment can not be carried.\n\n7.5 Agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming, or forestry\n\nHMRC applies the following definitions of agriculture, horticulture, aquatic farming, and forestry:\n\nagriculture — the science and art of cultivating the soil, growing and gathering in crops, and rearing of livestock\n\nhorticulture — the science and art of cultivating or managing gardens, including the growing of flowers, fruits and vegetables and aspects of arboriculture involving the management of trees, shrubs and woody plants in gardens\n\naquatic farming — the science and art of breeding fish and other aquatic animals, or growing aquatic plants, usually for food, in fish ponds, tanks or other artificial enclosures or environments\n\nforestry — the science and art of forming and cultivating forests and the management of growing timber\n\n7.6 Activities relating to agriculture (including aquatic farming), horticulture or forestry\n\nSection 12 explains our interpretation of purposes relating to agriculture (including aquatic farming), horticulture and forestry in the ‘Memorandum of Agreement’, agreed by:\n\nHMRC\n\nDriver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)\n\nNational Farmers Union\n\nUlster Farmers Union\n\nNational Association of Agricultural Contractors\n\nConfederation of Forest Industries\n\nHorticultural Trades Association\n\n7.7 Arboriculture\n\nArboriculture mainly focuses on the growing, care and management of trees, shrubs and woody plants. These are usually in gardens, parks or other populated settings, for the enjoyment, protection, and benefit of people.\n\nMachines and appliances (other than vehicles) used for all forms of tree work can use red diesel. This includes, but is not limited to the use of the following by arborists and tree surgeons:\n\ngenerators\n\nwoodchippers\n\nstump grinders\n\nmobile elevating work platforms\n\nQualifying vehicle types can use red diesel for arboriculture uses that are accepted as purposes relating to horticulture or forestry (read section 12). Agricultural vehicles can also use red diesel for cutting trees bordering public roads.\n\n7.8 Public roads\n\nThe Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 defines a public road as “any road that is maintained at the public expense”, for example by the Highways Agency or by a Local Authority. This includes footpaths and bridleways the public has access to that are maintained at the public expense.\n\n7.9 Golf course\n\nAn area of land where golf is played, including the facilities used by golfers who play there, such as clubhouses and pro shops. It also includes driving ranges, whether on the site of a golf course, or not. It does not include golf courses under construction.\n\n7.10 Community amateur sports club\n\nThe definition of a community amateur sports club is at section 658 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010, on the legislation website.\n\nTo be a community amateur sports club it must:\n\nbe registered with HMRC as a community amateur sports club\n\nbe open to the whole community\n\nbe organised on an amateur basis\n\nprovide facilities for and promote participation in, at least one eligible sport\n\nRead the list of community amateur sports clubs (CASC) registered with HMRC.\n\n7.11 ‘Generating heat’ for premises\n\nUsing a system, boiler, or other appliance to:\n\nheat the premises\n\nheat water or other substances for processing, use or consumption in or on the premises\n\n7.12 ‘Generating electricity’ for premises\n\nUsing a fixed or mobile generator to provide electricity for use in or on the premises.\n\n7.13 Generating electricity or heat ‘primarily’ (for premises not used for commercial purposes)\n\nWhere 75% or more of the electricity or heat generated when a machine or appliance is being used is for premises, or parts of premises, not used for commercial purposes.\n\n7.14 Premises\n\nA house, building or other structure, together with its land and outbuildings. Premises can also include any land, means of transport or mobile premises that are being used for carrying on a business or for private use.\n\n7.15 ‘Commercial purposes’\n\nCommercial purposes means trading in goods or services with the intention of making a profit.\n\nThis does not include delivery of a service, where it’s intended that any profit made will only ever be used to cover the costs of delivering that service.\n\n7.16 Premises not used for commercial purposes\n\nDomestic premises\n\nPremises that are mainly used as someone’s home are not used for commercial purposes. This also applies where someone’s home is also where they work.\n\nOther examples\n\nOther premises we consider not being used for commercial purposes include:\n\npremises used to deliver central and local government functions or acts of public administration, for example, NHS hospitals, state schools, town halls, public libraries\n\nplaces of worship\n\npremises used by registered charities for their primary purpose trading, for example, educational charity delivering education or training, museums, and independent schools\n\ncaravans used for the accommodation of people who travel with a travelling fair or travelling circus\n\nThe type of activities done on these premises can include those that directly relate to the service you provide, and activities that indirectly relate to providing your service.\n\nFor example, a café selling food and drink in a library is not a necessary part of providing the library service. It enhances the overall experience of the facility for the public and encourages them to make use of it, and contributes to its running costs.\n\nYou can use rebated fuel to generate electricity and heat for the premises, even if commercial contractors work there, provided they contribute to the running of your service.\n\nFor example, services such as school catering and cleaning by commercial contractors do not mean that the premises are used for ‘commercial purposes’.\n\n7.17 Kerosene heating system\n\nA heating system that uses a furnace or boiler designed or adapted to use kerosene as fuel.\n\n8. Use of red diesel in exceptional circumstances\n\nThere may be situations where individuals or business, whose use of vehicles or machinery is essential, cannot get or use full duty-paid (white) diesel, but can get or use red diesel.\n\nIn these circumstances, we may allow you to pay the duty on the red diesel and then use it. You will need to apply for a ‘rebated fuel licence’.\n\nRebated fuel licences enable the continued operation of vehicles or machines used for essential and critical purposes.\n\nUsing red diesel will be allowed only in response to exceptional circumstances, such as fuel supply issues.\n\nThis might be necessary if:\n\nthe supply of full duty-paid diesel is interrupted\n\nyou are an individual user like a GP or midwife, or a business such as a water supply company\n\n8.1 When we might consider granting a licence\n\nWe will only grant a licence if we are satisfied that:\n\nthe vehicle or machine’s use is essential and critical\n\nthere is no viable alternative to using red diesel\n\nit would be unreasonable in the circumstances not to allow you to use it\n\nIt’s unlikely that we’ll approve your application if:\n\nthere is no obvious barrier to you using duty-paid white diesel\n\nthe circumstances interrupting the supply of white diesel, if applicable, were not unforeseen\n\n8.2 Essential and critical use\n\nUse of a vehicle or machine is essential and critical if, without that use, there would be a significant risk to:\n\nnational security\n\nthe continuity of emergency services and law enforcement\n\npeople’s health\n\nthe supply of essential goods and services, such as fuel, water and power\n\nthe welfare of livestock and other animals\n\n8.3 How to apply\n\nYou must get approval before you use red diesel in your vehicle or machine due to exceptional circumstances.\n\nTo apply for a licence you must send your request to the Mineral Oil Relief Centre by email at: morcapprovalsteam@hmrc.gov.uk\n\nYou’ll need to include details of:\n\nthe critical and essential service that the vehicle or machine is used for\n\nthe vehicle or machine you want to use rebated fuel in\n\nwhat the vehicle or machine is normally used for\n\nthe circumstances in which the vehicle or machine will use red diesel\n\nthe exceptional circumstance that prevents you using duty-paid diesel\n\nthe consequences of not being able to use the vehicle or machine\n\nthe journeys a vehicle is likely to make and the estimated distances\n\nthe vehicle’s DVLA tax classification\n\nwhere you’ll store the red diesel and the type of storage\n\nwhen you plan to start using red diesel in the vehicle or machine and how much you expect to use\n\nhow long you expect to need to use red diesel\n\n8.4 What we’ll do with your application\n\nWe’ll check to satisfy ourselves that:\n\nthe use of the vehicle or machine is essential and critical\n\nthe circumstances are exceptional\n\nthere is no alternative solution\n\nIf we decide not to issue a rebated fuel licence, we’ll advise you of our decision in writing.\n\n8.5 If we approve your licence\n\nIf we decide you can use red diesel, we’ll send you a licence which you must present when you buy red diesel.\n\nWe recommend you carry a copy of the licence with all vehicles or machines covered by it.\n\nThe licence will also tell you:\n\nwhat your accounting period dates will be\n\nany terms and conditions attached to your licence\n\nif applicable, when we expect to withdraw it\n\nYou must use:\n\nform HO72 to provide an estimate of the fuel you will use during the accounting period, and pay the fuel duty due before you use any red diesel\n\nform HO73 if you think you will use more than the volume you have paid duty on, to provide a further estimate and pay the duty, before you use any more red diesel\n\n8.6 Records you must keep\n\nThe law requires you to keep a daily record of all the red diesel you use in your vehicle or machine under the terms of the licence.\n\nYou must keep them at the same place as the vehicle or machine, or at any other premises agreed with our officer, for at least 12 months from the date of the last entry in them.\n\nYou must record the identifying marks of the vehicle or machine using red diesel, on the day it is used. This can be the registration number of a vehicle or serial number of a machine, showing:\n\nthe volume and description of red diesel used in the vehicle or machine\n\nfor vehicles, the date of, and number of miles travelled in, any journey and whether the vehicle was using rebated or duty-paid diesel\n\nthe volume of red diesel used in a vehicle other than for propulsion, for example, to drive machinery or pumps, providing this equipment is not powered by the engine that propels the vehicle\n\n8.7 Accounting period declaration\n\nAt the end of the accounting period you must declare the amount of rebated fuel used on form HO75, which should be submitted within 10 days.\n\nWe will repay any duty paid for fuel that was subsequently not used.\n\n8.8 Withdrawal\n\nA ‘rebated fuel licence’ remains in force until we cancel it.\n\nYou must tell us of any changes to the information in your application for the licence, including when the exceptional circumstance that required the licence no longer applies.\n\nWe may periodically visit you or write to you to confirm the details on the application remain correct and the reason for needing to use red diesel still applies.\n\nWe will also cancel your licence if we are no longer satisfied that you should be approved to use red diesel, for instance, if you:\n\nfail to meet the obligations that arise from the licence\n\nuse rebated fuel outside the terms allowed by the licence\n\nmisuse red diesel, or facilitate its misuse by anyone\n\nWe will write to tell you the date your licence stops, explain why, and give you an opportunity to respond. We will also tell you how to provide a final return.\n\n9. HMRC powers to check, sample and test fuel\n\nThe law gives HMRC officers the power to establish if the correct fuel is being used and stored by checking, sampling and testing the fuel in:\n\nvehicles\n\nmachines\n\nvessels\n\nappliances\n\nstorage tanks\n\nFor more information on what HMRC officers are allowed to do by law read paragraph 9.4.\n\n9.1 Making fuel available for testing\n\nAs the owner or operator of a vehicle or machine, you must make your fuel available for testing if one of our officers asks you to.\n\nIf our officers are unable to take a sample, for instance, because you cannot remove an anti-theft device, or you refuse to allow it, they may seize and remove the vehicle, machine, appliance or vessel until a sample can be obtained. We may also impose a penalty for your failure to comply with this legal requirement.\n\nWe may prosecute you if you obstruct, hinder or assault one of our officers.\n\n9.2 Fuel tested in your absence\n\nYour fuel can be tested in your absence. You will be told about the test and the result in writing.\n\n9.3 Testing for marked fuel\n\nHMRC will take action against those responsible for the presence of marked oils containing any UK or EU chemical marker. These include:\n\nAccutrace S10 — a marker used in the UK and Ireland\n\nCoumarin — a UK marker\n\nQuinizarin — a UK marker\n\nSolvent Yellow 124, a marker used in the UK and Ireland\n\nn-butyl phenyl ether — a marker used in the UK, Ireland, and other EU countries\n\n9.4 Powers of HMRC officers\n\nOur officers are allowed by law to:\n\nexamine any vehicle or machine, and any oil in or on it and to inspect, test or sample any oil in the fuel supply\n\nrequire vehicle or machine owners, or anyone in charge of a vehicle or machine, to open or cause to be opened the fuel tank or other source of the fuel supply so that the fuel can be located and inspected, tested or sampled — if there is anything in the supply which might hinder this, it must be removed\n\nrequire anyone in charge of a vehicle or machine, to produce any books or documents relating to the vehicle or to oil carried on it and which are carried by that person or on the vehicle or machine\n\nenter any premises (except private dwelling houses) and inspect, test and sample any oil on the premises, whether in a vehicle, machine or elsewhere — in entering the premises, an officer may bring with them any vehicle used for carrying out official duties\n\nrequire the occupier of the premises or the person in charge of them to facilitate the inspection, testing or sampling of oil on their premises or oil in the fuel supply of vehicles or machines on the premises, irrespective of whether the oil or the vehicle or machine belongs to that person or someone else — this includes attending normally unmanned premises when our officers require access to fuel\n\nrequire anyone concerned with the sale, purchase or disposal of any oil to produce on demand any relevant books or documents\n\nrequire you to provide satisfactory evidence that any fuel in your possession (including in your running tank) is fully UK duty paid\n\n10. Other rebated fuel matters\n\n10.1 Mixing rebated fuels with fully duty-paid fuel\n\nYou must not mix these fuels in any tank, or in the fuel system of any vessel or machine not allowed to use rebated fuel. We may seize the fuel and vehicle or machine if you do.\n\n10.2 Vintage vehicles\n\nSome vintage tractors (in production before 1960) and cars (in production before 1956) need to run on a mixture of kerosene and petrol.\n\nKerosene is a heating fuel and the excise duty on it is fully rebated (reducing the excise duty to nil). For this reason, it is illegal to use kerosene in any vehicle or to mix it with road fuels unless you have a permit from us allowing you to do so.\n\nTo apply for a permit email: oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk with details of:\n\nthe vehicle you want to use kerosene in, including year of production\n\nwhat the vehicle is normally used for, the frequency of use, and the anticipated annual mileage\n\nwhy kerosene needs to be used\n\nhow much kerosene you expect to use\n\nIf we decide to allow you to add kerosene to your vehicle’s fuel, we’ll send you a permit stating the circumstances in which you can use kerosene.\n\n11. HMRC response to illegal fuel use\n\n11.1 What will happen if you misuse rebated fuel\n\nWe will seize any vehicle, vessel, machine, or appliance that is using rebated fuel when it is not allowed to.\n\nWe may offer to restore your vehicle, vessel or machine to you for a fee and subject to any conditions we consider appropriate.\n\n11.2 Offences and penalties\n\nWe will take action against you if you commit offences involving rebated fuel.\n\nYou will be liable to a penalty under Section 9(2)(a) of the Finance Act 1994 if you:\n\ntake in or use rebated fuel as fuel for a vehicle, machine, vessel or appliance that is not an excepted machine\n\nmix rebated or duty-free fuel with fully taxed fuel\n\ndo not provide records when asked to do so\n\ndo not allow our officers to take a sample of fuel\n\nremove any designated chemical marker or dye from any fuel\n\nadd any substance to fuel to prevent the chemical marker from being identified\n\nWe will seize the oil and any containers and equipment used to commit any of these offences.\n\nYou may also have to pay:\n\nthe fuel duty evaded, going back up to 4 years\n\na wrongdoing penalty based on the extent of your illegal fuel use\n\nIn more serious cases involving assault, repeated offending or dishonesty, criminal action may be taken. The offender can be fined an unlimited amount or imprisoned for up to 7 years, or both.\n\n11.3 If you disagree with HMRC’s decision\n\nThe Finance Act 1994 contains the appeal and review procedures for challenging the following excise decisions:\n\nthe terms offered for restoration of a vehicle, vessel or machine we have seized\n\nour decision not to restore any vehicle, vessel or machine we have seized\n\na civil penalty or civil evasion penalty\n\ntax assessment of excise duty\n\nThe procedures are different depending on what decision or decisions you’re challenging. We’ll give you a decision letter, and tell you what your rights are, if you want to challenge our decision.\n\nInformation about challenging HMRC restoration decisions and linked decisions can be found in what you can do if things are seized by HMRC or Border Force.\n\nMore information is available on HMRC’s review and appeal procedures.\n\n11.4 Appeals against the seizure of your machine\n\nThe arrangements for challenging the seizure of things liable for forfeiture (rather than HMRC’s decision about whether to return them to you) are different from the arrangements on HMRC’s review and appeal procedures.\n\nIf you disagree with our decision to seize your vehicle, machine, vessel or appliance, you can appeal in writing to the seizing officer within one month of the seizure date. We must receive your appeal by this deadline.\n\nWe must then bring civil (‘condemnation’) proceedings in the courts to determine the matter, and you can challenge the seizure and forfeiture there.\n\nMore information on how to challenge the seizure of goods by HMRC can be found in what you can do if things are seized by HMRC or Border Force.\n\n11.5 How to report misuse of rebated fuel\n\nFind out how to report the misuse of rebated fuel.\n\n12. Memorandum of Agreement\n\nMemorandum of Agreement in respect of purposes relating to agriculture (including aquatic farming), horticulture and forestry.\n\nParties to the agreement\n\nClear guidelines have been written for the use of machines and vehicles in agriculture (including aquatic farming), horticulture or forestry. The following government departments and agencies, and industry associations, have agreed how legislation shall be interpreted and applied:\n\nHMRC\n\nDVLA\n\nNational Farmers Union\n\nUlster Farmers Union\n\nNational Association of Agricultural Contractors\n\nConfederation of Forest Industries\n\nthe Horticultural Trades Association\n\nThe purpose of this Memorandum of Agreement is to provide guidance to those engaged in agriculture, horticulture or forestry, and to agencies enforcing compliance with the legislation.\n\nAny disputes will be considered on an individual basis, with regard to relevant legislation, and any definitive interpretation of the law will be given by the courts.\n\nScope of agreement\n\nThis Memorandum of Agreement is restricted to the use of agricultural and special vehicles and machines by:\n\nthe occupier of the land or the owner of the crop\n\na contractor or other person engaged to perform an agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation\n\nThe definitions of vehicles and machines covered by this agreement for hydrocarbon oils duty purposes can be found in Schedule 1A to the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (HODA), as amended.\n\nDefinitions of agricultural vehicles covered by this agreement for vehicle excise duty purposes can be found in Schedule 2 to the Vehicle Excise Registration Act 1994 (VERA), as amended, on the legislation website.\n\nWhen vehicles covered by this agreement are not used on public roads other than for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry they are exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty. Other classes of vehicles that are exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty are not covered by this agreement.\n\nVehicles, machines and appliances covered by this agreement that are being used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry can use red diesel.\n\nMeaning of ‘purposes relating to agriculture’\n\nIn our view, agriculture is the growing and harvesting of crops, for food, beverages, fodder, fuel, or industrial purposes, or the rearing of animals of any kind for producing food, wool, leather or other substances. Using a vehicle for ‘purposes relating to agriculture’ includes using it to:\n\ntransport agricultural ‘inputs; such as feed, fertilizer, fence posts, and so on for use on your farm (by ‘your farm’, we mean the farm that you own or manage, but also the farm where you work)\n\ntake your produce and livestock to market or for processing (including slaughter)\n\nmove produce and livestock between your farm and an associated storage facility\n\ntransport material to be used for maintaining or improving your farmland (including drainage pipes)\n\ntransport materials to repair and maintain your farm buildings (other than the farmhouse itself)\n\ndeliver agricultural waste from your farm to a waste tip\n\ntransport vehicles and equipment for use on your farm\n\nMeaning of ‘purposes relating to horticulture’\n\nIn our view, horticulture is the cultivation and management of gardens (including vegetable plots, allotments and market gardens, but also flowerbeds, trees, shrubberies and ornamental lawns in public parks).\n\nBy cultivation and management, we mean growing and tending flowers, lawns, shrubs and trees, and harvesting flowers, fruits and vegetables for food (or animal fodder) and for ornament, as well as treating and enriching the soil and controlling weeds and pests.\n\nWe do not regard as horticulture the landscaping and maintenance of grassy recreational areas, such as playing fields and golf courses, or the grassed areas of parks that are made available for walks, picnics and general recreation. Using a vehicle for purposes relating to horticulture includes using it to:\n\ntravel to and from a place where it will be used for horticulture\n\ntransport trailed or mounted implements to be used for horticulture\n\ntake your horticultural produce to a market or to a place where it is to be sold or processed\n\nmove your horticultural produce between the place where it is grown and an associated storage facility\n\ndeliver horticultural waste from the place of production to a waste tip\n\ntransport horticultural inputs such as seed, fertiliser, pesticides and so on for use in your own garden or in land set aside for horticulture\n\nMeaning of ‘purposes relating to forestry’\n\nIn our view, forestry is the upkeep and management of forests including the growing and harvesting of timber and other forestry products.\n\nBy ‘forest’ we mean:\n\nan area of land where trees have been planted (often in rows and columns) with the intention that they will be grown and harvested for timber, or other forestry products\n\na pre-existing natural forest which is being maintained and managed so that it can be harvested for timber, or other forestry products\n\nUsing a vehicle for purposes relating to forestry includes using it to:\n\ntravel to and from a place where it will be used for forestry\n\ntransport trailed or mounted forestry implements and machinery to and from the place they will be used for forestry\n\nmove timber that you (or your co-worker) have harvested from where it was harvested to the place where it is to be stored, sold or processed\n\n‘Aquatic farming’\n\nThe breeding or rearing of creatures and the growing and harvesting of crops or plants are accepted activities whether they take place on land or in water. Therefore, activities accepted as being purposes relating to agriculture and horticulture include equivalent water-based activities involved in pisciculture and aquaculture. This includes the breeding and rearing of fish and other aquatic creatures and the growing of aquatic plants in artificial conditions such as in tanks, ponds, or reservoirs, for food.\n\nActivities accepted as ‘purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture and forestry’\n\nActivities we accept as falling within the definition of agriculture, horticulture or forestry include:\n\nbreeding or rearing of any creature kept for the production of food, wool, skin or for the purpose of its use in the farming of land\n\nslaughtering any creature reared for the production of food, leather or other substances\n\ndisposal of fallen stock and rendering of animal by-products at premises approved by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), where these activities are a necessary part of the

and habitats impacted by agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and areas of agricultural land under environmental management schemes\n\nrunning or participating in events which provide information and education that benefit agriculture, horticulture or forestry, including taking part in charitable activities that promote these industries\n\nActivities not accepted as falling within the definition of agriculture, horticulture or forestry include:\n\nthe breeding, rearing or keeping of any creature solely for purposes relating to sport or recreation.\n\ndealing in agricultural, horticultural or forestry products\n\nthe further processing and preparation of agricultural, horticultural or forestry produce, or slaughtered animals, except where this is a necessary extension of the agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation to facilitate the handling, storage and transport of them, for example hay baling\n\nlandscaping\n\ncultivating and managing trees, shrubs and woody plants outside of gardens (such as in recreational areas, and so on) except where these activities are purposes relating to forestry — as defined in this section\n\nthe maintenance of recreational facilities, such as tennis courts, parks, or beaches (read section 3 of this notice for the rules regarding the use of rebated fuel on golf courses, driving ranges, and on land used by community amateur sports clubs)\n\nflood protection\n\npeat or loam extraction\n\nexploitation of wild animal or plant stocks\n\nconstruction of buildings or other structures used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry\n\ntransportation of agricultural, horticultural, or forestry produce, livestock, implements, inputs or waste, other than where this is incidental to an agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation — accepted transportation uses are as set out in the following section of this agreement\n\nAccepted transport uses\n\nSubject to restrictions in the definition of the particular type of vehicle in HODA and Vehicle Excise Registration Act 1994 (VERA), vehicles exempt from vehicle excise duty or entitled to use red diesel when used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry are accepted as being used for those purposes when they’re being used in the following circumstances:\n\nMoving vehicles and other machinery\n\nThis includes:\n\ndriving an agricultural vehicle to and from a place where it is to be used or has been used for agricultural, horticultural, or forestry purposes\n\ntransporting trailed or mounted agricultural, horticultural or forestry vehicles, implements, machines or appliances and of equipment or inputs required for their use as part of an agricultural, horticultural, or forestry activity —

repaired, inspected or tested, including collection, servicing and return of vehicles and machines by garage operators\n\ndelivering or collecting an agricultural vehicle or machine that has been bought, sold, loaned or hired and is or will be used for agricultural, horticultural or forestry purposes\n\nThe moving of vehicles and machines by dealers, garage operators and others not engaged in agricultural, horticultural or forestry operations in circumstances other than those listed in the previous 2 paragraphs, is not covered by this agreement.\n\nMoving produce and livestock\n\nThis includes:\n\ntransporting agricultural, horticultural or forestry produce within or between different areas of land occupied by the same person\n\ntransporting livestock within or between different areas of land occupied by the same person\n\ntransporting agricultural, horticultural or forestry produce from the place of production to temporary storage\n\ntransporting livestock from the place it

livestock from where it’s reared, or from temporary storage, to where it is to be sold or slaughtered\n\nThe transportation of produce or livestock must be incidental to an agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation. The responsibility is on the person transporting the load to demonstrate that this is the case.\n\nTransportation of produce or livestock which needs a goods vehicle operator’s licence may not be accepted as being incidental.\n\nTransportation of produce or livestock by anyone not involved in the agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation, including by a contractor employed solely for that purpose by a buyer or any other person, haulage an is not included within this agreement.\n\nMoving agricultural, horticultural or forestry inputs\n\nCollecting inputs and equipment used as part of an agricultural, horticultural or forestry operation, and transported within or between different areas of land. The land must be occupied by the same person as the inputs and equipment used.\n\nThis includes:\n\nhand tools\n\nfertilisers (including farm produced manures and slurries)\n\npesticides\n\nseed\n\nanimal bedding, feed and water\n\nfencing materials\n\nroad plans for the repair of unsealed tracks\n\nThis does not include:\n\nhousehold furniture or fittings\n\nsupplies required for domestic use\n\norganic or inorganic waste that is not to be used for the benefit of agricultural land or in an agricultural operation\n\nMoving waste\n\nThis includes:\n\nmoving agricultural, horticultural or forestry waste, within and between different parts of land occupied by the same person — the waste should have been produced by the occupier of the land — this includes movement of farm slurry by an agricultural contractor using specialist equipment on behalf of the occupier of the land\n\ntransporting agricultural, horticultural or forestry waste by the producer from where the waste was produced to a licensed waste disposal site or to a place where it is to be collected by a licensed waste carrier — this includes inorganic waste such as plastic packaging and replaced agricultural fencing materials, but does not include dismantled or demolished buildings\n\nclearing the road after agricultural, horticultural or forestry operations, or cutting hedges and verges\n\n13. Examples of purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture and forestry\n\nWorking on someone else’s farm\n\nIf you are contracted or engaged to carry out agricultural work at a farm or other land used for agriculture, horticulture or forestry, you are using your tractor for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture and forestry when:\n\ndriving it to and from the farm (or where you are going to use it for the contracted work)\n\ncarrying the materials or equipment that you need to do the work\n\nremoving any produce or waste resulting from the contracted work\n\nUsing your tractor to transport agricultural produce\n\nYou can transport produce to where it will be sold or put to its intended use if you’ve been involved in the growing or harvesting of the crops.\n\nBut, if your involvement is limited only to transporting the crops, we consider the use of the vehicle to be for haulage, not for purposes relating to agriculture.\n\nThis would apply to someone contracted, for example, solely to transport crops from an agricultural producer to an anaerobic digestion plant. Such journeys are not considered a purpose relating to agriculture.\n\nUsing your tractor to transport livestock\n\nYou can transport livestock to where it will be sold or slaughtered if you’ve been involved in rearing the livestock.\n\nBut, if your involvement is limited only to transporting the livestock, we consider the use of the vehicle to be for haulage, not for purposes relating to agriculture.\n\nTransporting waste material\n\nYou can deliver waste material resulting from an agricultural activity on your farm to where it will be disposed of, sold or otherwise processed.\n\nYou can also move waste material within and between different parts of land you occupy.\n\nIf you are moving farm slurry you can employ an agricultural contractor using specialist equipment designed for the purpose to move it for you.\n\nYou can also collect waste material for agricultural use on your own farm, or the farm on which you work, or are contracted to carry out agricultural work, for example, spreading fertiliser on fields.\n\nExcept in the example of farm slurry being moved by a contractor using specialist equipment, you are not engaged in purposes relating to agriculture if you are only transporting the waste material and you are not engaged in an agricultural activity that produced it or in which it will be used.\n\nForestry work\n\nClearing felled timber is part of forestry harvesting. This must be in a forest, or a commercial forestry enterprise. Cutting down trees anywhere else is not forestry work, even if you sell the timber.\n\nChipping, shredding or fine cutting of woody material such as logs and branches you’ve harvested, is accepted as being part of your forestry operation.\n\nFurther processing of harvested timber by anyone not involved in the forestry operation is not a purpose relating to forestry.\n\nBiodiversity conservation, environmental management, and ecological restoration\n\nLand restoration, and ecological and conservation projects are accepted as agricultural, horticultural and forestry purposes. This is providing the work is intended to help reduce the impacts of agricultural land use, such as overgrazing, horticulture and forestry on ecosystems and habitats. This includes maintenance of areas of agricultural land under environmental management schemes.\n\nDitch clearing and drainage\n\nDitch clearing and drainage, including work carried out by, or on behalf of a risk management authority (given in section 6 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010), is accepted as a purpose relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry. This is only if the work you do is intended to benefit land used for agricultural purposes (including horticulture and forestry). This means the purpose of the work must, at least in part, be to avoid agricultural land becoming unfit to grow crops or rear livestock on.\n\nAny drainage work or flood and coastal erosion management activities with no agricultural benefit to the land, are not agricultural purposes, even if the work takes place on agricultural land.\n\nWorking on utilities and infrastructure on or crossing agricultural land\n\nLaying and maintaining utilities, such as telephone or electricity cables across agricultural land, is an agricultural purpose if the utilities are installed specifically for the agricultural benefit of that land. If it’s not, the work and the filling of holes or trenches to repair the land afterwards is not an allowed activity. However, where it is necessary to bring in a specialist contractor to apply agricultural practices and technologies to make sure the land is properly restored for growing crops or rearing livestock, the contractor’s work is a purpose relating to agriculture.\n\nGardening businesses\n\nIf your business involves the cultivation and maintenance of a garden or gardens, this within the definition of horticulture.\n\nIf you work somewhere that is not a garden, such as playing fields, a livery yard, stables, at the side of the road, on someone’s private land, then this is not horticulture and, the vehicle or machine you use is not an ‘excepted’ machine’.\n\n(Read the ‘meaning of horticulture’ in the ‘Memorandum of Agreement’.)\n\nRunning and participating in agricultural shows, and so on\n\nAn agricultural show is an outdoor public event. It demonstrates the skills and exhibits the equipment, and animals associated with agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\nThey are usually held on dedicated showgrounds and hosted in collaboration with several partners to:\n\ndisseminate information on best practice and farming techniques, and the latest farming technology to farmers\n\nprovide a source of information and education about the industry to members of the public\n\nraise charitable funds, which are used to further these educational aims and support local communities\n\nsell and showcase produce created from locally farm-grown ingredients\n\nBy attending agricultural shows, farmers are likely to receive beneficial farming advice from exchanging ideas.\n\nThey give farmers the opportunity to:\n\nlearn about new innovations\n\nmeet and ask researchers how different farming technologies can be used to improve productivity\n\nlearn how a particular innovation can be applied on their farm\n\nThe shows benefit agricultural purposes by providing information and education. The running or participating in agricultural shows, or taking part in charitable activities, such as tractor runs and ploughing matches, promote the farming industry. These are purposes relating to agriculture.\n\nSimilarly, running and participating in events which provide information and education that benefits horticulture or forestry are considered as purposes relating to horticulture or forestry.\n\nEvents hosted by a single company to convince farmers that its specific products are the best, or events aimed only at selling agricultural machinery, materials, livestock or produce, such as ‘farmers’ markets’, are not agricultural shows.\n\nHowever, farmers can use rebated fuel in a qualifying vehicle to transport their produce or livestock to where it will be sold.\n\nTraining and tuition\n\nProviding training or tuition in the safe and competent operation of a vehicle or machine that you use for agricultural, horticultural or forestry work is accepted as a purpose relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry. This does not include where vehicles or machines are used only for training purposes, such as at tractor training centres or driving experience days.\n\n14. Examples of activities that are not purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry\n\nSports fields and recreational areas\n\nMaintenance of grassed areas such as sports fields and recreational areas, is not regarded as horticulture.\n\nWasteland\n\nCutting down trees or vegetation on wasteland is not agriculture, horticulture, or forestry work.\n\nStables, livery yards and so on\n\nKeeping animals for sport or recreation is not agriculture. This includes fish farmed or kept only for recreational purposes.\n\nFlood defences\n\nBuilding or maintaining flood defences is not agriculture.\n\nService providers — hire companies, dealers, servicing and repair garages, and hauliers\n\nIf you’re not directly involved in as agricultural activity, you’re not regarded as using vehicles or machinery for agriculture, horticulture and forestry purposes. This includes if you’re:\n\na dealer in farm equipment or materials, delivering materials or equipment that a farmer has leased or purchased from you\n\nlending equipment to a farmer\n\na haulier employed to transport animals, produce, goods or equipment to or from a farm\n\nRead the section about moving vehicles and other machinery.\n\nIn all other circumstances, dealers and garage operators are not entitled users and must use white diesel for their own uses.\n\nIf you’re dealing in second-hand vehicles and machines previously used for accepted activities, we will allow the machines to contain marked diesel provided you can evidence that this is only for allowed use by the previous owner or user.\n\nRed diesel can be used if you’re a dealer and you loan a vehicle or machine for the purposes of a demonstration or trial that includes using the machine for accepted purposes, for example to a farmer for agricultural use. In those circumstances, the vehicle or machine will be treated as used and the previous paragraph will apply to it.\n\nIf you’re a garage operator, you can service, maintain, repair, or inspect vehicles and machines that are fuelled with red diesel if the vehicle or machine is otherwise used for accepted purposes. You can also collect and return a vehicle that you work on.\n\nYour rights and obligations\n\nRead the HMRC Charter to find out what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.\n\nHelp us improve this notice\n\nIf you have any feedback about this notice write to:\n\nEmail: oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk\n\nThis address is not for general enquiries.\n\nYou’ll need to include the full title of this notice.
