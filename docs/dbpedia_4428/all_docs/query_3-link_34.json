(10) of section 3 apply in relation to the definition of extreme fuel poverty under this section as they apply in relation to the definition of fuel poverty under that section.\n\n5Meaning of fuel poverty gap S\n\n(1)Where a household is in fuel poverty, the fuel poverty gap is the figure calculated in accordance with subsection (2) or the figure calculated in accordance with subsection (3), whichever is the lower.\n\n(2)The first figure referred to in subsection (1) is the difference between—\n\n(a)the annual fuel costs necessary for the home in which members of the household live to

sections 1(2)(c), 2(2)(c) and 2(3)(c) are to be increased or (as the case may be) decreased by the same percentage as the percentage increase or decrease in the annual average consumer prices index over the period from 2015 to the year to which the target relates.\n\n(6)In subsection (5), the consumer prices index means the all consumer prices index published by the Office of National Statistics.\n\n(7)The Scottish Ministers may by regulations amend this section to replace references to one prices index with references to another.\n\nFuel poverty strategy S\n\n6Preparation and review of strategy S\n\n(1)The Scottish Ministers must prepare a fuel poverty strategy.\n\n(2)The fuel poverty strategy must—\n\n(a)set out the approach the Scottish Ministers intend to take or

residential buildings—\n\n(i)which are used as homes by a household in fuel poverty,\n\n(ii)where improvements would be required to achieve, by 2030, an energy performance certificate band C or higher (within the meaning of the Energy Performance of Buildings (Scotland) Regulations 2008), and\n\n(iii)where it is technically feasible, cost effective and affordable to achieve an energy performance certificate band C or higher, and\n\n(i)set out how the Scottish Ministers intend to assess—\n\n(i)progress towards meeting the fuel poverty targets, and\n\n(ii)whether the fuel poverty targets are met.\n\n(3)The approach set out under subsection (2)(a) must include provision for how to remove low levels of energy efficiency as a driver of fuel poverty.\n\n(4)The fuel poverty strategy may include such other information as the Scottish Ministers consider appropriate.\n\n(5)The Scottish Ministers are to keep the fuel poverty strategy under review and may at any time revise it.\n\n(6)Unless the context requires otherwise, a reference in this Act to the fuel poverty strategy includes a reference to the fuel poverty strategy as revised following a review under subsection

additional funding required to take those steps), and\n\n(e)the steps that the Scottish Ministers propose to take in the next reporting period to address the four drivers of fuel poverty for the purpose of meeting the fuel poverty targets.\n\n(2)A report under subsection (1) must also set out, with respect to meeting the 2040 target in relation to each local authority area in Scotland—\n\n(a)the steps that have been taken during the reporting period for the purpose of meeting that target,\n\n(b)the progress made in that period towards meeting that target, and\n\n(c)the steps that the Scottish Ministers propose to take or consider should be taken in the next reporting period in order to meet that target.\n\n(3)A report under subsection (1) may include such other

period of 3 years beginning with the day on which the first fuel poverty strategy is published under section 8,\n\n(b)each subsequent period of 3 years.\n\n(6)For the purposes of subsections (1)(d) and (2)(c), where the next reporting period would include any period after 31 December 2040—\n\n(a)those paragraphs are to be read as a requirement to set out the steps that the Scottish Ministers propose to take or consider should be taken in the next reporting period in relation to fuel poverty, and\n\n(b)it is immaterial for the purposes of calculating the next reporting period that a report will not require to be prepared at the end of that reporting period by virtue of subsection (4).\n\n(7)For the purpose of subsection (1), “four drivers of fuel poverty” has the same meaning as in section 14(10).\n\n10Consultation on periodic reports S\n\n(1)In preparing a report under section 9, the Scottish Ministers must consult such persons as they consider appropriate.\n\n(2)The persons
