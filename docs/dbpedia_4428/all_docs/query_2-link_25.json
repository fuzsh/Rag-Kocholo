        "text": "Key dates for the WHD scheme\n\n13 August 2023 is the qualifying date for Core Group 1 and Core Group 2. You must meet the eligibility criteria on this date to be eligible for a rebate. If your benefits claim is backdated to this date or earlier, you may also become eligible for a rebate.\n\n16 October 2023 the WHD helpline opens for the 2023/24 scheme year and is for Core Group 1 and Core Group 2 customers in England and Wales. If you are eligible, the energy supplier who supplied your electricity on the qualifying date 13 August 2023 will be responsible for providing the rebate. You can contact the WHD helpline on 0800 030 9322.\n\nBetween October 2023 and December 2023, letters will be sent to qualifying customers for Core Group 1 and Core Group 2. The letter will confirm if you are eligible for an automatic rebate or advise you to call a helpline to check if you are eligible.\n\nIf you have not received a letter early January 2024, but you think you should be eligible for a rebate under Core Group 1 or Core Group 2, please check the government website gov.uk for more information on eligibility and contacting the helpline.\n\n29 February 2024 is the deadline to contact the Warm Home Discount helpline if you are advised to get in touch in your letter. Please contact the helpline included in your letter before this date if you're eligible to make sure you don't miss out on the payment.\n\nThere are two core groups for this scheme: Core Group 1 (in receipt of the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit), and Core Group 2 (customers who meet Low Income Criteria and High Energy Costs Criteria).\n\nIf you are in either group, you will receive a £150 credit into your energy account.\n\nCore Group 1: £150 for eligible pensioners\n\nTo receive the WHD in this group you (or your partner's) name must be on your energy account, and you (or your partner) need to:\n\nreceive the ‘Guarantee Credit’ element of Pension Credit.\n\nbe with an energy supplier who participates in the WHD scheme on 13 August 2023\n\nIf you are in this group you do not need to do anything.\n\nCustomers will be contacted in writing between October 2023 and December 2023 to be advised of their eligibility for the scheme.\n\nCore Group 2: £150 for eligible households (Low income/high energy costs)\n\nYou no longer need to complete an application form from your energy supplier.\n\nEligible customers will be identified based on Low Income Criteria and High Energy Costs Criteria.\n\nThe qualifying date for meeting these criteria is 13 August 2023.\n\nThe criteria to qualify for this scheme are:\n\nBe with an energy supplier that is part of the WHD scheme\n\nHave your name on a bill or account with that supplier\n\nYou (or your partner) were in receipt of a qualifying means-tested benefit, or tax credit, as listed in the Low Income Criteria section below, on the qualifying date of 13 August 2023.\n\nLive in a property identified as having high energy costs, which is explained in more detail in the High Energy Costs Criteria section below.\n\nLow Income Criteria\n\nIs based on being in receipt of means-tested benefits or tax credits, which includes:\n\nUniversal Credit\n\nIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance\n\nIncome-based Jobseekers Allowance\n\nIncome Support\n\nHousing Benefit\n\nPension Credits Savings Credit\n\nChild Tax Credits *\n\nWorking Tax Credits *\n\n* Households in receipt of Tax Credits must be below a household income threshold, adjusted according to household composition. More information can be found here.\n\nIf you meet the low income criteria, you also need to meet the new High Energy Costs Criteria.\n\nHigh Energy Costs Criteria\n\nThis criteria is set by the Government department of Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ). They will use data from the Valuations Office Agency (VOA) - another Government department - to identify households which are likely to have high energy costs.\n\nThe VOA will use the following benchmarks for this:\n\nFloor area: the larger a property, the more likely it is to have higher energy costs\n\nProperty age: older properties are likely to have below average energy efficiency and above average floor areas.\n\nProperty type: properties with more external walls - like detached houses - generally have lower energy efficiency, and higher energy costs.\n\nDESNZ will match property data from the VOA with means-tested benefits and Tax credit data held by DWP and HMRC. This will help them identify those who are on low incomes, and likely to live in a property that's more expensive to heat.\n\nWhere data on a property is missing, DESNZ will consider these additional criteria:\n\nInformation on other properties nearby\n\nThe Energy Performance Rating (EPC) of a property\n\nOther information available in the Land Registry\n\nKey Dates for the WHD scheme\n\n13 August 2023 is the qualifying date for a Core Group 1 rebate. You must meet the eligibility criteria on this date to be eligible for a rebate. If your benefits claim is backdated to this date or earlier, you may also become eligible for a rebate.\n\n16 October 2023 the WHD helpline will open for the 2023/24 scheme year and is for Core Group 1 customers in Scotland.\n\nIf you are eligible, the energy supplier who supplied your electricity on the qualifying date 13 August 2023 will be responsible for providing the rebate.\n\nBetween October 2023 and December 2023, letters will be sent to qualifying customers for Core Group 1. The letter will confirm that they are eligible for an automatic rebate or advise you to call a helpline to check if you are eligible.\n\nIf you have not received a letter by mid-January 2024, but you think you should be eligible for a rebate under Core Group 1, please contact the WHD helpline on 0800 030 9322.\n\n29 February 2024 is the deadline to contact the Warm Home Discount helpline if you are advised to get in touch in your letter about your Core Group 1 claim. Please contact the helpline included in your letter before this date if you're eligible to make sure you don't miss out on the payment.\n\nYour energy supplier will apply the rebate no later than 31 March 2024.\n\n23 January 2024 - Applications for the Broader Group have now closed\n\nUnlike the Core Group 2 scheme in England and Wales, customers who are on low income and on certain benefits need to apply for the Broader Group.\n\nThis is because Scotland has no equivalent of the Valuations Office Agency (VOA), as referenced in the Core Group 2 criteria for England and Wales.\n\nThis means there is no way to identify customers who may fall into the high energy costs criteria, so you will need to provide information as with previous years WHD schemes.\n\nThere are two groups for this scheme: Core Group 1 (in receipt of the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit), and Broader Group (customers who meet low income and vulnerability criteria).\n\nIf you are in either group, you will receive a £150 credit into your energy account.\n\nCore Group: £150 for eligible pensioners\n\nBroader Group: application scheme £150\n\nApplications for the Broader Group are now closed.\n\nApplications received before the scheme closed will still be reviewed. Successful applications will be approved and WHD payment applied before the 31st March 2024.\n\nYou can review the status of your WHD application in your online account."
