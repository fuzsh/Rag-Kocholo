Historical Context

Abu Dhabi’s past is a fascinating tapestry of culture, politics, and transformation. This section will guide you through the pivotal stages of development and the profound impact of the Nahyan family.

Founding and Growth

In the late 18th century, the area now known as Abu Dhabi was a small fishing village under the dominion of the Bani Yas tribe. The city’s name, “Father of Gazelle,” suggests the abundance of wildlife that early settlers might have encountered on the island. Your understanding of Abu Dhabi’s emergence as a city is intertwined with the discovery of fresh water on the island, catalysing its initial growth.

With the discovery of petroleum in the mid-20th century, Abu Dhabi underwent an economic metamorphosis, transitioning from a quiet fishing village to a bustling, modern metropolis, further solidified by its status as the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

The construction of the Sheikh Zayed Bridge, an architectural marvel and a symbol of connection to the mainland, captures the acceleration of development.

Influence of the Nahyan Family

The Nahyan family, a branch of the Bani Yas tribe, has been the seminal force shaping Abu Dhabi. From their rise to power in the 18th century, the family has steered the city through strategic partnerships, including a truce with Great Britain, which established the Trucial States and set the stage for the region’s future stability.

Under the guidance of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, widely respected for his visionary leadership, Abu Dhabi saw unprecedented growth in infrastructure, public welfare, and cultural patronage. This period he also marked the unification of the emirates, with Abu Dhabi playing a central role due to its wealth from oil revenues, thereby embedding the Nahyan family into the very heritage of the UAE.

Diversification and Investment

Underpinning the transformation towards a ‘falcon economy,’ Abu Dhabi has channelled efforts into diversification and investment, reducing reliance on oil revenue. Leveraging its Sovereign Wealth Fund, managed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the emirate has invested globally across various asset classes.
