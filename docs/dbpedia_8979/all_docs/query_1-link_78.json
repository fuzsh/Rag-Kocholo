        "text": "We are one of few firms authorized to provide formal legal training to all lawyers in the UAE. Our lawyers benefit from working in an environment filled with experienced legal professionals. Our lawyers also receive professional development training from the Dubai Legal Affairs Department and participate in global training programs such as the Associate Transfer Program.\n\nOur UAE offices also offer England & Wales Training Contracts, a two-year training program encompassing at least three areas of English law that provides trainees with the basic knowledge and skills to become qualified E&W lawyers.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nWe launched our BakerWomen Middle East initiative in 2015 to support the progression of women in the workplace at all stages of their careers. As part of the initiative, we host internal and client meetings to provide a forum for women to share their experiences and challenges.\n\nWe remain committed to the UAE Governmentâ€™s Emiratisation initiative and provide internships and reverse secondments to UAE nationals to undertake trainings with our firm.\n\nWe were named \"International Law Firm of the Year\" by LexisNexis in their Middle East Women in Law Awards for two consecutive years (2022-2023).\n\nPro Bono & Community Service\n\nWe promote and lobby to advance the fundamental rights and opportunities for persons in need together with our Baker McKenzie offices globally. In 2021, we co-hosted together with Terre des hommes Foundation the MENA preparatory meeting for the World Congress on Justice with Children, addressing the most current issues related to children in contact and conflict with the law."
