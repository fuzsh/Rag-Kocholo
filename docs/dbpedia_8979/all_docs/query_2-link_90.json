        "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, is bordered by the Persian Gulf to the north, Oman to the east, and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. It is a constitutional federation of seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Quwain, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Fujairah. The federation was formally established on 2 December 1971, and the capital is Abu Dhabi. Arabic is the official language of the United Arab Emirates, with English widely spoken and used in business, and the currency is the United Arab Emirates dirham (AED).\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has a well-established infrastructure, stable political system, and one of the most liberal trade regimes in the Gulf region. It continues to be increasingly important, relevant, and attractive to businesses from around the world as a place to do business and as a hub for the region and beyond. The United Arab Emirates is also one of the best examples in the region of an economy that has successfully moved away from reliance on the energy sector. A significant proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) is being derived from non-oil revenues.\n\nPwC has been practising in the United Arab Emirates for over a quarter of a century, and specialises in audit, assurance, business advisory services, and tax and legal services. Complementing our depth of industry expertise and breadth of skills is our sound knowledge of the local business and regulatory environments across the Middle East."
