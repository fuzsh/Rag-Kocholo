        "text": "UAE Residence by Investment\n\nThe UAE is one of the most attractive business destinations worldwide. UAE Residence by Investment is aimed at providing long-term residence to foreign investors, entrepreneurs, and talented individuals including specialists, students, and researchers who make a significant investment to the country.\n\nBenefits of a UAE golden visa\n\nGateway to Africa and the Middle East, Asia, and Europe due to the country’s strategic geographic positioning\n\nSafe, secure environment\n\nHigh standard of services and good quality of life\n\nApplicant’s spouse and unmarried children of any age may be added at no additional investment\n\nAmong the top 30 countries in the world for ease of doing business\n\nFavorable tax regime for investors — with no personal income, capital, net worth, or withholding tax (except for those levied in the domestic banking and oil sectors), and several double-tax treaties in place\n\nGood value from real estate investments\n\nStreamlined, efficient residence permit system\n\nMember state of the United Nations, the Gulf Co-operation Council, and the Arab League\n\nUAE golden visa requirements\n\nThere are numerous categories of beneficiaries for the UAE's Golden Residence visa, including real estate investors who can obtain a 10-year renewable residence visa by purchasing one of the following:\n\nA property worth a minimum of AED 2 million (approximately USD 550,000)\n\nA property worth a minimum of AED 2 million (approximately USD 550,000) with a loan from specific local banks\n\nOne or more off-plan properties worth a minimum of AED 2 million (approximately USD 550,000) from approved local real estate companies\n\nProcedures and time frame of the UAE golden visa\n\nApplications for UAE residence must include completed application forms and should be accompanied by the appropriate fees and supporting documents. Golden Residence visas obtained are valid for 10 years and can be renewed thereafter. Residing outside the UAE does not nullify the visa. Investments must be held for at least three years.\n\nOnce the initial due diligence checks have been completed and the retainer paid, then the application for UAE residence can be submitted to the government.\n\nOnce the requirements have been fulfilled, pending initial approval of the application, the successful applicant receives a six-month multiple-entry visa and travels to the UAE to apply for an ID card and undergo a medical check. Thereafter, full approval is granted and the client receives the residence visa.\n\nThe processing time for the residence application takes over eight weeks."
