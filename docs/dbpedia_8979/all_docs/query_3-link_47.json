        "text": "The emirate is also a pioneer in the global alternative and renewable energy industry. It is home to the world’s largest solar energy field at Noor Abu Dhabi and the Arab world’s first nuclear energy plant, Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant. It is a major developer of clean energy technology and sustainable urban developments through Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar). The emirate plans to rely on renewable energy to generate 50 per cent of its power needs by 2030.\n\nThrough its leading international financial centre, Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the emirate is advancing its position on the global financial map. ADGM is home to ADX, the largest stock exchange in the UAE by market capitalisation, as well as a dedicated crude oil commodity derivatives exchange at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, which trades ADNOC's flagship Murban Abu Dhabi crude oil futures contracts that help benchmark global crude oil prices, and a thriving ecosystem of fintech startups and SMEs.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also rapidly diversifying its economy by implementing initiatives and policies to create opportunity, stimulate innovation and enhance the contribution of the private sector to the emirate’s GDP.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Office's AED2 billion Innovation Programme supports new and innovative companies in high-growth sectors through globally competitive rebates and grants, which has led to several global innovators setting up in Abu Dhabi.\n\nMeanwhile, Abu Dhabi’s global tech ecosystem Hub71 and Ghadan 21 have attracted more than 100 global tech start-ups in its first two years.\n\nThe Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence was launched in 2019 as the world's first graduate-level, research-based artificial intelligence (AI) university.\n\nThis is particularly evident at Louvre Abu Dhabi, the first museum in the world to explore our shared humanity by highlighting similarities across civilisations. The museum has laid the groundwork for a new type of cultural collaboration centred on the creation of the first universal museum.\n\nThe emirate’s commitment to tolerance and interfaith harmony is also seen in the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, a masterpiece of modern Islamic architecture and design, open to people of all faiths and beliefs, as well as the development of the under-construction Abrahamic Family House, where a church, mosque and synagogue will share the same grounds.\n\nLed by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, the emirate is dedicated to conservation and preservation of its rich biodiversity and environmental ecosystem, with many world-leading initiatives that have already achieved significant success, such as a 22 per cent increase in the Arabian oryx population as part of the Mohamed bin Zayed Arabian Oryx Reintroduction Programme, the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital, the region's largest coral reef rehabilitation programme, and the successful rehabilitation of important plant species.\n\nThe emirate is also advancing its eco-tourism offering, with world-class nature-oriented activities from kayaking in mangroves to multiple nature parks open for education and leisure visits."
