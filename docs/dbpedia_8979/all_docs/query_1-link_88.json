        "text": "Climate in Dubai and Abu Dhabi\n\nWhile winter is the best time to visit the UAE, spring (March to May) and Autumn (September to November) are good times to visit too. Spring sees maximum temperatures ranging from 82.4°F to 93.2°F with temperatures steadily rising as it gets closer to summer. During autumn, expect to find temperatures in the range of 94°F to 102° F.\n\nIn the summer months of June, July, and August, temperatures can go as high as 115°F – 122°F with an average temperature of around 104° F.\n\nWhat to Pack for Dubai and Abu Dhabi Trips\n\nA shawl or cardigan will also come in handy when you are out and about in the metro or walking through souks and older parts of town and wish to cover up.\n\nWhile many areas in the UAE are quite westernized, the country is, nonetheless, a conservative one. Therefore, it’s a good idea to dress modestly while you are out and about. For women, it is best to wear clothes that cover your knees and shoulders. Likewise, men should avoid wearing shorts that are shorter than knee-level.\n\nHowever, these forms of dress aren’t the rule everywhere. For example, conventional beachwear such as bikinis, is perfectly acceptable provided they aren’t worn publicly elsewhere. Indeed, some travelers have been fined or even arrested for wearing beachwear in places such as shopping malls!\n\nBear in mind that dressing codes are slightly different in Sharjah and Ajman, which are both part of the UAE. Dressing rules are stricter with and women are expected to cover their upper arms and shoulders. Shorts are a complete no-no for men in these parts of the country.\n\nCarry a shawl, light cardigan or jacket while traveling in the UAE. Evenings can get chilly, especially in winter and some spring and autumn months. A shawl or cardigan will also come in handy when you are in the metro or walking through souks and older parts of town."
