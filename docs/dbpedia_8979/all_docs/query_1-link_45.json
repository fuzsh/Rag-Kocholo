        "text": "Interesting facts you really need to know about Dubai!\n\nAre you a little confused about what Dubai is and where exactly is it? How is it related to Emirates, and what exactly happens there?\n\nDon’t worry; you’re not alone if you are a little confused! Most international travellers are familiar with Emirates Airlines, and that’s where the knowledge ends.\n\nWe’re here to help demystify exactly “what is Dubai” and set you on the right track for exploring the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), an oil-rich country in the Middle East.\n\nIf you already know the basics and are ready to start planning a vacation or stopover through Dubai, pop over to our UAE homepage.\n\nIs Dubai a country or a city?\n\nDubai is an Emirate of the country called the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The United Arab Emirates has 7 “states,” if you like, called Emirates. Dubai is the name of the city AND the Emirate. Officially, Dubai is not a state but an Emirate.\n\nIs Dubai a City?\n\nYes. As well as being an Emirate of the UAE, Dubai is also a large city. The city is broken down to many smaller suburbs or neighbourhoods, but there is no one defining “city centre”; most of the population sprawls along the coast of Dubai.\n\nWhat are the seven Emirates of the UAE?\n\nGoing west to east, they are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah.\n\nIs Abu Dhabi in Dubai?\n\nNo. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are both in the country called the United Arab Emirates. Both are “Emirates” (like states) as well as being cities. Dubai and Abu Dhabi both face on to the Arabian Gulf, Abu Dhabi is 160kms south-west of Dubai and is, in fact, the Capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nLearn here more about how to get between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\nIs Dubai the biggest city in the UAE?\n\nYes, Dubai as a city is much bigger than the capital Abu Dhabi. However, the EMIRATE of Abu Dhabi is much larger than the Emirate of Dubai and accounts for most of the land mass and oil supply.\n\nWhat is Dubai’s population?\n\nWhilst there is no census in the country, Dubai’s population is currently estimated at 3.61m(1). Abu Dhabi’s population, in comparison, is 1.6 million. The total population of the UAE is estimated at 10.17 million (August 2023)\n\nAre there more men than women in Dubai?\n\nYes, due to the large expatriate population, there is a large skew towards males – believed to be as much as 70%/30% Male/Female ratio. A lot of this comes from construction and service workers from southern Asia, predominantly India & Pakistan, who are believed to make up over 40% of the population at present.\n\nWhat is the currency in Dubai?\n\nDubai’s currency is called the UAE Dirham, code AED. It is pegged to the USD at 3.67:1, and with many, many cash exchanges, it’s easy to get a cash rate close to parity.\n\nIt is straightforward to get money out at ATMs (they don’t all dispense gold bars, as you might be led to believe!!). You will get notes ranging from 5 AED through to 1000 AED.\n\nThere are also coins called fils. 100 fils = 1 dirham. You can also get half fils and quarter fils, though you’ll find most things are rounded to the nearest dirham – having said that, since the introduction of a 5% VAT, which should be included in the price of everything you purchase, you will often find some strange rounding and need the smaller coins.\n\nWhat is Dubai’s Time Zone?\n\nDubai operates on Gulf Standard Time – GST – which is GMT/UTC +4 hours.\n\nWhat is the Country Code for Dubai?\n\nDubai, along with all of the United Arab Emirates, uses the international dialing code +971.\n\nWhat is the GCC?\n\nGreat question; you may often hear GCC and UAE in the same sentence, along with OPEC and other acronyms, all waiting to confuse you!!\n\nGCC stands for Gulf Cooperation Council. Current countries in the GCC are Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar & Oman.\n\nGCC members may extend travel benefits to each other’s residents, among other things that impact travellers. Most apply to citizens, though, not resident visa holders.\n\n(And OPEC stands for Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries – there are 14 OPEC member countries around the world, many of them are in the Middle East).\n\nIs everyone in Dubai Muslim?\n\nNo. Whilst the country is an Islamic State, and Emirati people are Muslim, they make up a small percentage of the country’s total population.\n\nThe vast majority of the population (over 85%) are expatriate workers who come from over one hundred different nationalities and religions.\n\nWhilst the majority of the population, including expats, are Muslim and you are expected to observe Islamic law, you will just as readily find Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and Jews all working side by side in Dubai and the UAE.\n\nMulticulturalism, tolerance and acceptance of others are among the most important things to understand about Dubai.\n\nIs Dubai Sunni or Shia Muslim?\n\nThe majority of Muslims in Dubai are Sunni Muslims, though there is a Shia minority of around 15% in Dubai.\n\nDoes Dubai produce oil?\n\nDespite misconceptions, oil is not a large commodity for the Emirate of Dubai. Oil was discovered in Dubai in 1966, but reserves are not extensive – it is believed oil production makes up less than 5% of Dubai’s GDP.\n\nThe vast majority of oil reserves of the UAE are almost all in Abu Dhabi Emirate – the UAE as a whole is estimated to have the seventh-highest proven oil reserves in the world.\n\nWhat IS Dubai’s economy based on?\n\nSince around 1833, Dubai has been a trading port. Dubai’s economy today relies on trade, tourism, aviation, real estate and a growing financial services sector. Many international companies have their Middle East Headquarters in Dubai, and Jebel Ali Port is the largest marine terminal in the Middle East.\n\nCan you drink alcohol in Dubai?\n\nYes. Despite being a Muslim country, due to the size of the expat and tourist population of the city, there are many ways that alcohol can be drunk legally. Most hotels (though not all) have licenses that permit them to serve alcohol to tourists and non-Muslim residents.\n\nNon-Muslim residents can also apply for alcohol licenses, which permit them to buy alcohol from retail outlets for consumption at home. These shops are generally kept low-key with limited signage but are very much accessible to those who legally apply.\n\nTourists can now also buy alcohol from these retail shops on presentation of a passport, but you’re likely to get most of your drinks from hotels and bars. Alcohol is taxed on import, though the consumption tax on alcohol has been removed recently.\n\nDrinking in public and public drunkenness is strictly prohibited and can come with hefty fines and jail terms. Keep your drinking where it’s allowed and in moderation.\n\nYou can read more about Dubai’s alcohol rules here.\n\nDo I need to learn any Arabic to visit Dubai?\n\nNo. You may be surprised to hear this, but as a visitor, no, you will not need to know any Arabic – but you will need to be well versed in English.\n\nAlthough Arabic is the national language, with the volume of overseas visitors the city receives, English is used EVERYWHERE. Signage to menus; it will all be stated in both Arabic and English. Shop staff? Almost certainly will be of varying nationalities other than Emirati so I will address you in English.\n\nIt is, of course, appropriate to brush up on a few basic words for politeness – “Shukran” – thank you. And our family favourite, “yalla, yalla”- let’s go, let’s go!!!\n\nDo women need to be covered in Dubai?\n\nNo. Most Muslim ladies prefer to wear the hijab, and most Emirati women dress entirely in black with a black Shayla covering their heads. Some – though not many – will wear the full Niqab covering their face as well. This is not required of all women by law and is largely a personal choice, led by religion and fashion.\n\nNon-Muslim women are not asked to comply with the head covering, but tourists and expat residents should expect to dress conservatively. By this, we mean cover your shoulders and knees when in public and avoid clingy and revealing clothes. Within the grounds of a hotel resort, different rules apply.\n\nYou can read more about Dubai dress code here.\n\nWhen is the weekend in Dubai?\n\nUntil 2022, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates had their weekend on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe law changed in this regard from 1 Janaury 2022 to bring the UAE in line with most Western Countries who have their weekends on Saturday and Sunday. Additionally, the Emirate of Dubai has a half day on a Friday, making it one of the first places in the world to have an official 4.5-day Government work week (neighbouring Emirate Sharjah went so far as to declare a three-day weekend, Friday to Sunday!)\n\nNote that this applies to schools and Government organizations. Not all private sector firms followed suit. Many workers are still on 6 day weeks and may have only Friday, Saturday or Sunday as their “off” day.\n\nFriday, from prayer time through to Sunday night, is a busy time of the week at popular attractions and shopping areas, often until quite late at night.\n\nWhat happens in Dubai during Ramadan?\n\nRamadan is the 9th month in the Hijri Calendar and a Holy Month observed by Muslims.\n\nAmongst many things observed, daytime fasting is an important one. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims must not eat or drink (with some small exceptions). To create a respectful environment for this, Dubai has strict laws on eating in public during this time. That said, laws have relaxed over the years, and many, many eateries are now open during the day time, without the partitions or curtains you used to see.\n\nThe other big change tourists will notice is an adjustment in operating hours for many businesses. Life really moves to the evening, so many schools, Government offices and workplaces will change their hours to allow for a rest period in the afternoon, with things springing back to life after the evening “Iftar” – the breaking of the fast.\n\nYou can find a detailed guide on what to expect during Ramadan here.\n\nDo I need a visa to visit Dubai?\n\nYes. In some cases, you need to get this in advance, but there are many countries whose citizens are permitted to obtain a FREE 30-day visa on arrival to the UAE. Citizens of a further 40 countries can apply for a 90-day multiple entry visa.\n\nCheck out this guide from the UAE Government to ascertain your Visa eligibility.\n\nThere you have it! A very basic run-through of the facts you need to know about Dubai."
