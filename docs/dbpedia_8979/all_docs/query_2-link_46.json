E perfectly combines the conventional and modern values of East and West and synchronizes with different nationalities and cultures. Such an act makes this country and other advanced nations in the world. It is an unbelievable fact that the present United Arab Emirates (U. A. E), positioned in the Arabian Peninsula’s South-East corner, was only a desert land even during the 1950s. The shoreline of the country dotted with ridges and coral reefs was helping the local population to survive with natural pearls, fishing, camel herding and oasis farming. The thriving natural pearl industry of the region suffered a setback in 1930 when Japan introduced cultured jewels in 1930.\n\nA History\n\nThe Portuguese led by Vasco de Gamma was the first to come to the region in 1498 on their way to India. The British, who landed here in 1820, signed a treaty of peace with nine Arab sheikhdoms to safeguard their trade route to India from pirates. The truce signed gave the name to sheikhdoms as the Trucial States. After granting independence to India in 1947, the British continued their influence in the Gulf region for its oil potential.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the other kingdoms had encouraged the ruler Sheikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, to agree with Iraq Petroleum, for the detection of oil in the region. The desert conditions created problems in domestic oil exploration. The oil exploration agreement of Abu Dhabi with the British Petroleum helped in the discovery of oil in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about 8,755 feet in 1958. The development of oil in other places followed it. The finding of oil 1960 in Dubai further helped the region to introduce progressive reforms.\n\nThe decision of the Al Nahyan family to substitute the ruler Sheikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan with his brother Sheikh Zayed in 1966 also helped Abu Dhabi to make rapid progress.\n\nFormation of the Nation, The United Arab Emirates\n\nIn 1971, the British announced their intention to leave the country due to unfavorable economic conditions in the region. Among the nine Trucial States, the Kingdom of Bahrain and Qatar went independently on their own. The decision of Bahrain and Qatar enabled the formation of UAE on 2 December 1971.
