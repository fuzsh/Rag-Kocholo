Each UAE emirate has an emirate capital city with the same name as the emirate (emirates or states are the primary political or administrative divisions of the UAE, with each \"state\" governed by a royal ruling family). For a small emirate like Ajman, most of the population lives in Ajman City. For the much larger emirate of Abu Dhabi, a larger proportion of the emirate's population lives outside Abu Dhabi City.

As of Jun 2017, geonames data unchanged except for Dibba (location change from Sharjah to Fujairah). Many websites use the geonames data but with an obviously incorrect reference date. UAE city populations are substanially higher as of Jun 2017 (most recent check of geonames data). Assume city populations have more than doubled from 2007 to 2017.\n\nCategories\n\nParent category - UAE.

Dubai the name of both a city and an emirate. Dubai, the city, is part of Dubai, the emirate, which is one of 7 emirates which make up the country called the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nIs Dubai the capital of the UAE?\n\nNo, Abu Dhabi city is the capital of the UAE, and also the capital of the emirate of Abu Dhabi. Dubai city is the capital of the emirate of Dubai, but not the capital of the UAE.\n\nHow many cities are there in Dubai?\n\nThere is only one city in the emirate of Dubai: the city of Dubai. Dubai is not a country. There are however, 3-8 cities in the United Arab Emirates, a nation which Dubai emirate is a part of. Any other urban areas in the emirate of Dubai are either part of the Dubai metropolitan area or too small to be called a city. Hatta is the largest town outside the Dubai city area but still in the emirate of Dubai.\n\nHow many cities does the UAE have? How many cities are in UAE?\n\nIncluding the main or biggest cities of each emirate, there are 8 cities in the UAE: Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Al Ain, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain (UAQ). There are many more districts or metropolitan areas with the word \"city\" in the name but they are generally part of one of the previously listed cities, e.g. Khalifa City A or B, Masdar City, and numerous versions of Dubai \"something\" City. If a city is regarded as an urban area with population of more than 75,000 or 100,000 (not a strict definition but referenced by Wikipedia from Doxiadis' settlement heirarchy or population heirarchy from his book Ekistics), then there are 7 cities in the UAE. Umm Al Quwain would be a \"large town\". However, politically, UAQ would be considered to be a city as it is the largest city in the emirate of UAQ, and the capital city of UAQ. However (take 2), Wikipedia also says (on its City page) that a definition of city by minimum population size is commonly \"between 1,500 and 50,000 people\".\n\nWhat are the major cities of United Arab Emirates?\n\nMajor cities, as in large cities, are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Al Ain, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah. By population size, Fujairah is a small city, UAQ is a large town. If a major city is considered to be one with a population of more than 1 million, then there are only 3 major cities in the UAE: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. Al Ain might increase to a population of 1 million by 2025-2030.\n\nHeadings\n\nList of largest cities in UAE (biggest, main)\n\nList of cities in Dubai UAE\n\nOnly one city in Dubai, see FAQ \"How many cities in Dubai?\"\n\nList of top cities in UAE\n\nList of most populous cities in UAE\n\nMetropolitan areas in UAE\n\nUAE municipalities, emirate and city governments.\n\nDubai Government and Dubai Municipality for Dubai emirate and Dubai city.\n\nAbu Dhabi Municipality, Al Ain Municipality, Western Region Municipality for respective regions in Abu Dhabi.
