        "text": "Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's legislature. The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's northern coastline and heads up the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai is to host World Expo 2020. Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969. Dubai's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.\n\nThe emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Dubai was recently named the best destination for Muslim travellers by Salam Standard. Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events. The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce. Dubai's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008â09 following the financial crisis of 2007â08, but the emirate's economy has made a return to growth, with a projected 2015 budget surplus. As of 2012, Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle East. In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world, after Geneva. Dubai was rated as one of the best places to live in the Middle East by U.S. global consulting firm Mercer.\n\nMore information is available on Wikipedia\n\nDubai\n\nOverlay image (Before and After)\n\nOur tour today stops over the city of Dubai or Dubayy, a city in the north-east United Arab Emirates. It is the capital of the state of Dubai, on Dubai Creek, on the Persian Gulf. Dubai is on the west side of the creek; the eastern part of the town is known as Dayrah (Deira). Dubai was the residence of the British political agent for the former Trucial States from 1954 until 1971. Known as the Venice of the Gulf, Dubai is the chief port and commercial centre of the United Arab Emirates. Oil wells in the area have largely displaced the traditional occupations of pearl diving, fishing, and camel breeding. Until 1833 the town was tributary to the state of Abu Dhabi. Dubai is sometimes spelled Debai or Dibai.\n\nWith this demonstration of images taken by the Sentinel-1 (Radar SAR instrument) and Sentinel-2 (optical sensor), we aim to show to the large fild of application that the Copernicus satellite family can cover.\n\nView large format slider\n\nView Sentinel 2 high resolution image (JPG 4.6 MB)\n\nView Sentinel 1 high resolution image (JPG 5.2 MB)\n\nMap of area"
