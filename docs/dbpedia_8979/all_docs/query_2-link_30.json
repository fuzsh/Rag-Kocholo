        "text": "Is Dubai A Country?\n\nUPDATE JULY 2024. So I had a conversation with an American friend the other day, and he had never heard of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), he thought Dubai was the capital of Saudi Arabia and he thought their nationality was Muslim. Yup, really! Where do I start?! I tried to tell him the actual story but it got a bit long-winded. The UAE is a big tourist destination these days, and with so many people taking holidays to Dubai I thought the confusion would be over, but clearly not! So is Dubai a country or not? Is it one of the 197 countries in the world? Nope. Let me put things straight:\n\nWhat is the UAE:\n\nThe UAE is an abbreviation of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is a country, consisting of seven smaller ‘Emirates’ which are similar to states. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are 2 of those 7 states.\n\nThe seven emirates which make up the UAE are:\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nDubai\n\nSharjah\n\nAjman\n\nFujairah\n\nRas al Khaimah\n\nUmm al Qaiwain\n\nWhat is the Capital of the UAE:\n\nAbu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE.\n\nWait for a second, so you’re telling me neither Dubai nor Abu Dhabi is a country?!\n\nIs Dubai A country? No, Dubai is not a country and Abu Dhabi is not a country.\n\nWhat continent is Dubai in?\n\nDubai is on the continent of Asia. It’s in the Middle East of course, but that too is within the Asian border.\n\nSo, Is Dubai in Asia?\n\nYes! Remember, the Middle East isn’t a continenet. The middle east is part of the Asian continent. One of 7 continents in the world.\n\nSo why does Dubai, Abu Dhabi etc have their own flags?\n\nThey are the flags of their Emirate, all the seven emirates have individual flags BUT they also all fly the same UAE flag (seen below).\n\nHow does their Government work?\n\nThe UAE has a President (the Emir of Abu Dhabi) and a Prime Minister (the Emir of Dubai). Each Emirate retains autonomy over its region.\n\nWhere is the UAE:\n\nIt’s on the eastern side of the Arabian peninsula. It has Saudi Arabia to the West and Oman to the South. Check out the graphic and google map below.\n\nIs Dubai a country? Where is Dubai? Google map:\n\nShould I Visit the UAE?\n\nIf you enjoy experiencing very different cultures, then yes certainly! It’s a lot more liberal (in the Western sense) than much of the UAE so it breaks you in nicely. After than you can consider tours to Syria, or tours to Iraq, like the trips I took my readers on (read about them on those links, great trips!).\n\nApply for a Dubia tourist eVisa online using a website such as iVisa, and then make sure you do a regular Dubai visa check to keep up-to-date on the status of your application. Bumming on a beach in Thailand can only offer so many aspects to a holiday, so once you’ve ticked that box it’s time to put yourself to the test. The Middle East is back to ‘real’ travelling, no tourist buses, no dorms full of college students, you’re really on the road. And Dubai is a great starting point for that.\n\nWhy are so many people visiting Dubai these days!?\n\nDubai is the most famous place to visit in the region. Why? Cheap flights. Hot weather. And lots of instagrammable places. Quality food and pretty epic night life too mean that more and more influencers see it as the place to be. For better or worse.\n\nAnd there are certainly enough things to keep you occupied for a good few days but the UAE is not cheap so don’t stay too long! Budget for around $60 per day at the super low end, get in, soak it up and move on. It’ll be an experience like no other.\n\nIs Dubai Safe?\n\nIn a word, yes. Super safe. Unless that is you breach the cultural rules. Violent crime is almost non-existent. But if you disrespect the Mosques, or are drunk and disorderly in public, you can find yourself in trouble with the police quite quickly. Be sensible, and it’s one of the safest places on the planet.\n\nDo women need to cover up in Dubai?\n\nNo. Dubai is a liberal state within the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSome Muslim women do cover up, so don’t be shocked to see full hijabs in practice. However, you’re just as likely to see a Russian instagrammer in next to nothing right beside them.\n\nIs the Dubai weekend Saturday and Sunday, or Friday and Saturday?\n\nDubai follows the Islamic tradition of Friday/Saturday weekends. So that means Dubai brunch on a sunday morning has become an institution for expats. All you can eat (and drink). It has to be seen to be believed!\n\nCan You Drink Alcohol in Dubai?\n\nYes! It is of course a Muslim country. However, the vast majority of people who live in Dubai aren’t from Dubai. It has a HUGE expat population. And with that, there are venues to serve them. Most hotels have alcohol licences, and therefore have bars within them.\n\nThe pubs witin the hotels are designed to barely look like they’re part of a hotel, which means nightlife and drinking culture in Dubai is the same as anywhere else. In fact, it’s probably crazier. And a lot more expensive! Beers can run to $20, and cocktails can go all the way to $50!\n\nLocal Muslims are forbidden (however, that is practically never enforced).\n\nDo you need a visa to visit Dubai?\n\nFor the people who have found this article, generally not. The developed world gets a visa on arrival. Some developing countries still need to apply for a visa in advance however. UK/US/Ireland etc can just show up without doing anything.\n\nWhy is Dubai rich?!\n\nThe simple answer would be oil. However, the UAE is rich in oil, but Abu Dhabi has most of it! So much so, that Dubai has gone broke more than once in recent times. Hence the largest building in the world being named after Abu Dhabi’s leader, after he bailed Dubai out to finish it!\n\nDubai however is a huge trading port. And it’s often known as the GCC’s financial centre. So money continues to flow through Dubai.\n\nSo, is Dubai A Country After All?!\n\nNope! Dubai is 100%, not a country. The United Arab Emirates, or UAE, IS a country though. And I hope that helps clear things up, it can be quite confusing. So that should answer your ‘Is Dubai A country?’ quandary, and remember the UAE really is a great place to visit, great for shopping too, for more ideas on what to give to photographers, check this out, and while I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s a typical backpacker haunt it’s certainly an intriguing place. Happy travels!"
