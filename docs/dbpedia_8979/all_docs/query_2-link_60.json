        "text": "Official name: United Arab Emirates\n\nArea: 82,880 square kilometers (32,000 square miles)\n\nHighest point on mainland: Mount Yibir (1,527 meters/5,010 feet)\n\nLowest point on land: Sea level\n\nHemispheres: Northern and Eastern\n\nTime zone: 4 P.M. = noon GMT\n\nLongest distances: 544 kilometers (338 miles) from northeast to southwest; 361 kilometers (224 miles) from southeast to northwest\n\nLand boundaries: 867 kilometers (539 miles) total boundary length; Oman 410 kilometers (255 miles); Saudi Arabia 457 kilometers (284 miles)\n\nCoastline: 1,318 kilometers (819 miles)\n\nTerritorial sea limits: 22 kilometers (12 nautical miles)\n\n1 LOCATION AND SIZE\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Persian Gulf. Seven emirates (states) make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE): Abu Dhabi, Dubayy, Ash Shāriqah, Ra's al Khaymah, Al Fujayrah, Umm al Qaywayn, and 'Ajmān. With an area of 82,880 square kilometers (32,000 square miles), the UAE is nearly as large as the state of Maine.\n\n2 TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has no territories or dependencies.\n\n4 TOPOGRAPHIC REGIONS\n\nAbu Dhabi, extending along the Persian Gulf coast and into the interior of the Arabian Peninsula, occupies about four-fifths of the UAE's territory. The remaining six emirates are clustered together on the Musandam Peninsula to the northeast. The UAE is mostly a flat, sandy desert except for the easternmost region, where the northern tip of the Al Hajar Mountains stretches into the country from Oman to the east.\n\n5 OCEANS AND SEAS\n\nThe northern, and longest, part of the UAE's coastline borders the Persian Gulf, with a short section to the east bordering the Gulf of Oman.\n\nSeacoast and Undersea Features\n\nThere are coral reefs in the shallow waters off the UAE's eastern coast on the Gulf of Oman. Shoals lie off the UAE's Persian Gulf coast, which has no natural deepwater harbors, unlike the Gulf of Oman coast, which has several.\n\nSea Inlets and Straits\n\nThe UAE is situated at a strategic location along southern approaches to the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and is a vital transit point for global crude oil shipments.\n\nIslands and Archipelagos\n\nThe UAE includes more than one hundred islands, most of them owned by Abu Dhabi. The country's capital, the city of Abu Dhabi, is located on an island of the same name. Other islands, including the island of Dās, are used for oil and gas operations related to offshore drilling.\n\n6 INLAND LAKES\n\nThere are no lakes in the UAE.\n\n7 RIVERS AND WATERFALLS\n\nThere are no perennial rivers in the UAE; however, there are small areas of wetlands.\n\n8 DESERTS\n\nMore than two-thirds of the UAE's total area is a sandy and largely uninhabited desert, running from the westernmost tip of Abu Dhabi east to the land border with Oman and north to the Musandam Peninsula. Sand dunes in the southeast can reach heights of 100 meters (330 feet). The two major oases are the al-Liwa' Oasis in south-central Abu Dhabi and the Buraimi Oasis at Al 'Ayn, on the border with Oman.\n\n9 FLAT AND ROLLING TERRAIN\n\nMost of the UAE is very flat, including its coastal lowlands and desert interior.\n\n10 MOUNTAINS AND VOLCANOES\n\nThe UAE's eastern region comprises barren, rugged mountains that are the northernmost extension of neighboring Oman's Al Hajar range. The highest peak in the country, Mount Yibir, which rises to 1,527 meters (5,010 feet), is located in this region.\n\n11 CANYONS AND CAVES\n\nThere are many caves in the Al Hajar Mountains in the eastern part of the UAE.\n\n12 PLATEAUS AND MONOLITHS\n\nExcept for the mountainous area in the east, the UAE is a low-lying country with no significant plateaus.\n\n13 MAN-MADE FEATURES\n\nAll of the UAE's major ports are man-made, including Port Jabal 'Ali and Port Rashid, two of the largest artificial harbors in the Middle East. Irrigation canals support farming near the Buraimi Oasis at Al 'Ayn."
