        "text": "Neighboring Countries\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that border the UAE.\n\nWorkweek\n\nThe workweek in the UAE is from Monday to Friday, with Saturday and Sunday as the weekend. However, retail and many other consumer focused businesses are open six to seven days a week.\n\nClimate\n\nDecember through March is considered the mild season with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 22°C (about 68.5°F to 71.6°F). August is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 40°C (104°F). Humidity is high in the summer months. There is very little rain in Abu Dhabi from May to October, with January typically being the wettest month.\n\nTimezone\n\nThe UAE is in Greenwich Mean Time plus four hours. In Standard Time, the UAE is nine hours ahead of New York. During Daylight Savings Time, Abu Dhabi is eight hours ahead of New York.\n\nLanguage and Demographic\n\nWhile Arabic is the official language in the UAE, English is widely spoken, and is primarily used in education and business, particularly in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nSafety\n\nThe UAE is considered one of the safest countries in the world, with extremely low violent crime rates. However, incidents of property crime do occur, and appropriate alertness and safety measures should be taken as you would anywhere else in the world.\n\nNational Day\n\nThe United Arab Emirates celebrates National Day annually on December 2. NYU Abu Dhabi hosts lively events to educate the community about UAE traditions and culture."
