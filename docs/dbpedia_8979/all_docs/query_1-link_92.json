        "text": "Working to accelerate UAE’s sustainable growth through development\n\nThe UAE is a leading logistics hub and tourist destination, with strong investments in infrastructure driving its economy. Its growth ambitions are supported by the 'Projects of the 50' initiative, which aims to attract substantial foreign direct investment over the next nine years.\n\nWe have long supported the country’s growth, including key infrastructure projects like the state-of-the-art Terminal A building at Abu Dhabi’s Zayed International Airport. We’ve also worked across many iconic hotel and hospitality projects, from The Address Beach Resort, with its record high infinity pool, to Atlantis, The Palm resort, with its world-famous waterpark.\n\nInitiatives like Dubai’s 2040 Urban Master Plan and Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 are informing a new generation of mixed-use projects and driving urbanisation. Modern Methods of Construction and digitalisation are reshaping residential and commercial developments, while sustainable construction is on the rise, driven by the government’s Green Agenda 2030. These and other ambitions make UAE an exciting environment for construction.\n\nFocused on quality and innovation\n\nOur offices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai give us the capability on the ground to support our clients' projects and programmes effectively. Since opening our first office in the UAE in 2006, we have increased our workload and grown our headcount from ten to over 480. That growth demonstrates how our stature has expanded in the UAE market as clients have recognised the quality of our capabilities."
