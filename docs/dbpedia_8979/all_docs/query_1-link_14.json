        "text": "About Dubai, it is the most populous city and the capital of United Arab Emirates (UAE). Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st century with a focus on Real Estate, tourism and hospitality, having the second most five-star hotels in the world, and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.\n\nIn addition, it also been called the “shopping capital of the Middle East”. And, alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the world’s largest shopping centre and Mall. Dubai is also known for the historical souk districts located on either side of its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks. The Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai.\n\nJumeirah — A diverse district whose residents are the Europeans to the Filipinos to the Pakistanis; a mixed Little Europe, Karachi and Manila. Jumeirah is much favoured by Europeans due to the ease of access of the beach, Beautiful villas are seen here. Jumeirah Beach, Jumeirah Beach Residence’s the Walk and Jumeirah Mosque are the top attractions.\n\nDowntown Dubai — While Bur Dubai and Deira are traditionally considered “Downtown”, the Downtown Dubai development is smack in the center of the “New Dubai,” between Dubai Marina on the south end and the border with the city of Sharjah to the north. It includes the Burj Khalifa (tallest building in the world), the Dubai Mall (world’s biggest), Fountain, and lots of other skyscrapers and hotels.\n\nDubai Harbour — Set to open in October 2020, Dubai Harbour will be an iconic, innovative and luxurious waterfront development, creating a world-class maritime facility with the biggest and most advanced cruise terminal and marina in the region. Inspired by the Gulf’s long tradition with the sea, the Harbour is set to further enhance the position of Dubai as a leading global hub for maritime tourism, attracting visitors from all over the world. Located right in the heart of Dubai, in the vibrant area between the iconic Bluewaters and Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Harbour is a stone’s throw away from the city’s most recognised landmarks, beautiful beaches and world-famous attractions.\n\nDubai Marina — is a mega-development that borders Jebel Ali (the world’s largest man-made port). It is full of skyscrapers and hosts the “Jumeirah Beach Walk” with a number of restaurants, hotels an open-air market when the weather permits, and frequent shows. Marina houses one of the highest concentrations of Westerns in Dubai. There are many hotels surrounding Marina.\n\nSatwa — One of Dubai’s Little India and Little Manila, due to the presence of Filipinos and Indians, a rise in Filipino and Indian restaurants, shops, supermarkets are seen here. Gold and textiles is what people come here for, Gold Souk might be your top destination but Satwa too has gold shops and is hassle free, not so crowded.\n\nKarama — More of like a mixed commercial residential district, one of Dubai’s Little Indias and Little Manilas, cheap eats and cheap buys are the top things here.\n\nBur Dubai — A historical district and Bur Dubai is usual term for the area from Jumeirah to the creek, the creek separates Bur Dubai from Deira. Tourist attractions from abras to souks to floating restaurants to the famous creek are found here.\n\nBluewaters — is a vibrant lifestyle destination featuring distinctive residential, retail, hospitality, and entertainment options. All who arrive are spoilt for choice. Home to Ain Dubai, the world’s largest observation wheel, it is also a shopper’s paradise, housing unique retail and dining concepts.\n\nDubai World Trade Centre- a district that was only sand and emptiness only a decade ago but is now a free zone of commercial economic activity, from office spaces, co-working spaces, and entertainment attractions, to warehouses, expensive hotels, and lavish restaurants.\n\nDeira — Dubai’s old Financial centre, today Deira is a bustling commercial-residential district of Indian, Pakistani, Persian, and Arab cultures with some old souks, including one specializing in spices. Many Iranian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Pakistani, Indian, Afghani and other immigrants from poorer Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Central Asian countries call this area home.\n\nArabian Ranches and Emirates Hills — These are two separate places, residential rents here are expensive due to the land value, just like the whole of Dubai, these two are Man-made.\n\nMirdiff/Mirdif — A commercial-residential district which is somewhat newly built and lies directly under the flight path to Dubai International Airport. Mirdif City Center is one of the attractions. This is another residence for the well-to-do.\n\nInternational City — Just a simple residential area in the middle of the desert, what’s special about it is its architectural design, the residential rents here are cheap and is somewhat the next Chinatown as many Chinese businessmen and women reside here.\n\nAlso Jebel Ali, a city near Dubai which was once isolated from the main bulk of Dubai back in the 70’s and is now a separate major residential and industrial hub encompassing the edges of the southern portions. The main attraction popular with locals and tourists alike is the easily recognizable Ibn Battuta Mall, styled on the countries visited by the famous explorer. The mall is built adjacent to the Ibn Battuta Gate Hotel that’s large archway can be seen from afar. Surrounding the mall is the Gardens apartments, an ethnically diverse district with a strong Indian community. Jebel Ali village, a 35 year old community built on the side of Jebel Ali (Ali Mountain) for the European builders of Jebel Ali Port is still popular with western expats. The coastal side of the Sheihk Zayed Road in Jebel Ali consists of many unattractive power and desalination plants that somewhat ruin the view. The port was the 9th busiest in the world in 2011."
