        "text": "The world’s tallest building. Largest shopping mall. Busiest international passenger airport. They’re all here and it’s only the start; Dubai’s continuing to grow and innovate daily. Dubai’s transformation to a leading city—in nearly every way—gives us pride. That’s because we’ve been here for more than 60 years, helping and growing alongside the community.\n\nFrom our offices in the heart of Dubai, our 160+ staff members provide master planning, design, and construction supervision services for clients in the buildings, water, urban planning, and transport sectors.\n\nAcross the city, and beneath the streets you’ll find our contributions to shaping the urban landscape and driving progress. We’ve master planned landmark communities and designed award-winning healthcare facilities. We’ve helped set guidelines for getting automated vehicles on the roads of Dubai and right now, we’re working on the Deep Tunnel Storm Water System which will transform drainage for Dubai, and ease challenges within the rapidly growing Dubai South precinct."
