        "text": "Geography\n\nThe United Arab Emirates are a country in the east of the Arabian Peninsula on the Persian Gulf. The land has a total area of 83,600 km² (32,278 mi²) and a total coastline of 1,318 km (819.0 mi). This land area is approximately 105% of the area of Maine. The United Arab Emirates are thus the 19th smallest country in Asia and ranked 116th in the world. An exceptionally high proportion of residents (88%) belongs to the urban population. More than every third inhabitant lives in Dubai.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates are comparatively low at an average elevation of 149 meters above sea level. The highest mountain peak (Dschabal Yibir) is at 1,527 meters. The country has about 700 smaller and to a considerable extent man-made islands. There are direct national borders with the two neighboring countries Oman and Saudi Arabia. The distance between New York City and the Capital Abu Dhabi is about 11,030 km (6,854 mi)."
