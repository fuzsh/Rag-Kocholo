        "text": "01 of 20\n\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\n\nThe 20th century ended on a high — at least as far as rom coms are concerned. 10 Things I Hate About You is a film that EW’s critic describes as “the cheekiest 'literary' update yet — a post-riot grrrl gloss on The Taming of the Shrew.” Starring some of the hottest, young talent of the late-‘90s, 10 Things I Hate About You reimagines Shakespeare’s beloved play as a high school love story. Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls in love with Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), but learns she isn’t allowed to date until her older sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does. After Cameron manages to convince the high school bad boy (Heath Ledger) to woo Kat, Padua High School finds itself overrun with hormones and hijinks. A classic rom com with a killer soundtrack, 10 Things I Hate About You is the only film to answer the question of what would happen if Shakespeare went to high school in Seattle. —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch 10 Things I Hate About You: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gil Junger\n\nCast: Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik\n\nRelated content: Watch Julia Stiles get emotional as she reenacts iconic 10 Things I Hate About You scene\n\n02 of 20\n\n13 Going on 30 (2004)\n\nJennifer Garner launches a full-scale charm offensive in 13 Going on 30, a fantasy romantic comedy about Jenna Rink, a 13-year-old who wishes to be grown up after a disastrous birthday party. A cross between Big and The Devil Wears Prada, the film follows Jenna from her childhood home to her New York City luxury apartment and dream job at a magazine. As the teen in a 30-year-old's body attempts to understand what has happened to her in the last 17 years, she must reevaluate whether growing up was everything she had hoped for. One of the purest and most rewatchable rom-coms from the early aughts, 13 Going on 30 represents some of the best the genre has to offer and is a joy to watch regardless of your age. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch 13 Going on 30: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gary Winick\n\nCast: Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Judy Greer, Andy Serkis\n\nRelated content: Jennifer Garner remembers late director Gary Winick\n\n03 of 20\n\n50 First Dates (2004)\n\nSix years after Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore teamed up for The Wedding Singer, the two connected on screen for a second time, playing opposite each other in this daffy romantic comedy. Following a commitment-phobic veterinarian (Sandler) who falls in love with an artist suffering from short-term amnesia (Barrymore), 50 First Dates hones in on and heightens the game of finding the girl you can’t stop thinking about — and dealing with the reality that she’ll never remember meeting you. Set on the island of Oahu — a location so consistently beautiful that it alone negates the idea of time passing — this premise-driven comedy finds emotional resonance amidst all the silly gags. Barrymore and Sandler have just as much chemistry together as they did in their first film together, leading to what EW’s critic describes as, “an agreeably deranged romance with a geeks-in-paradise Hawaiian setting.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch 50 First Dates: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Peter Segal\n\nCast: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Dan Aykroyd\n\nRelated content: 50 First Dates wasn't originally set in Hawaii — and had a completely different ending\n\n04 of 20\n\n(500) Days of Summer (2009)\n\nWhile the movie's intro explicitly states that (500) Days of Summer is not a love story, it is a story of love lost and found. Five hundred days refers to the length of the relationship between Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), two young co-workers who begin dating but find their attitudes toward love and relationships to be incompatible. Structured in a non-linear fashion and employing plenty of devices that poke fun at the nature of dating and how we remember relationships, (500) Days of Summer isn't a typical rom-com — although it does include one of the ultimate examples of the \"manic pixie dream girl\". A fun watch featuring some solid acting by the film's two leads, EW's critic calls it a \"Gen-Y Annie Hall made by a new-style Wes Anderson who uses his cleverness for humanity instead of postmodern superiority.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch (500) Days of Summer: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Marc Webb\n\nCast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Zooey Deschanel, Geoffrey Arend, Chloë Grace Moretz, Matthew Gray Gubler\n\nRelated content: The untold story of the (500) Days of Summer dance sequence\n\n05 of 20\n\nBend It Like Beckham (2002)\n\nThis coming-of-age soccer movie (or rather football in England, where it’s set) catapulted Keira Knightley to movie star status, but it’s Bend It Like Beckham’s cultural perspective and commentary that truly make it special. The story follows Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), a teen girl obsessed with soccer (and with David Beckham, who gave the film permission to use his name because he wanted to promote girls’ soccer). Feeling suffocated by her strict Indian parents and their hope that she’ll someday become a homemaker and devoted wife, Jess secretly joins a soccer team and must juggle responsibilities for both her family and her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). The film resonates with anyone who knows the acute angst of pretending around those they love to be someone they’re not. The result is director Gurinder Chadha’s supremely watchable sports film about gender, culture, sexuality, diversity, and love — and it’s a touching one to boot. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Bend It Like Beckham: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gurinder Chadha\n\nCast: Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Anupam Kher, Juliet Stevenson, Shaznay Lewis, Archie Panjabi\n\nRelated content: How Bend It Like Beckham bent the rules and became a girl power classic\n\n06 of 20\n\nCrush (2022)\n\nPaige Evans' (Rowan Blanchard) only experience with love is her passion for art, but when she's forced to join the high school track team to evade suspension, she gets a lucky chance to hang out with her secret crush, Gabby (Love, Victor's Isabella Ferreira). But no matter how fast Paige runs toward the affection of Miller High's It Girl, her feelings for another teammate — Gabby's sister, AJ (Auli'i Cravalho) — swiftly catch up to her. With its charming storytelling and abundance of drama (both on and off screen), Crush is an LGBTQ+ rom-com that captures the beauty of queer joy and first love.—James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch Crush: Hulu\n\nDirector: Sammi Cohen\n\nCast: Rowan Blanchard, Auli'i Cravalho, Isabella Ferreira, Tyler Alvarez, Teala Dunn, Michelle Buteau, Megan Mullally\n\nRelated content: Moana star Auli'i Cravalho reflects on coming out: 'It is so joyful’\n\n07 of 20\n\nThe Family Stone (2005)\n\nThere’s no place like home during the holidays — unless you’re introducing your family to a new significant other. In the holiday dramedy The Family Stone, Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) brings his uptight girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) to his parents’ beautiful New England house to spend Christmas with his liberal, upper-class family. After struggling to win over Everett’s parents and adult siblings, Meredith invites her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her for moral support, and a game of romantic musical chairs ensues. An ensemble comedy led by Diane Keaton, who shines as the matriarch tasked with difficult personal issues, The Family Stone is a funny, endearing, underrated holiday classic. EW’s critic writes, “It dramatizes the attractive traps of bohemian-bourgeois aspirations (and snobbism) and, with a light comedic touch, also holds its ground as an old-fashioned and even sweet story about love — and the swapping of perfectly wrapped presents.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Family Stone: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Thomas Bezucha\n\nCast: Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T.

Inspired by Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, Fire Island finds Noah (Joel Kim Booster, who also wrote the screenplay) committed to helping his friend Howie (Bowen Yang) get some action, but he quickly finds that playing matchmaker is a thankless task — especially under the seemingly judgmental eye of a new acquaintance (Conrad Ricamora in the Mr. Darcy-equivalent role). EW's critic says it best: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a very small swimsuit must be in want of a rom-com to call his own; Fire Island sets the stage, messy and sweet, and lets its freak flag fly.\" —Angela Andaloro\n\nWhere to watch Fire Island: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Andrew Ahn\n\nCast: Joel Kim Booster, Bowen Yang, Margaret Cho, Conrad Ricamora, James Scully, Matt Rogers, Tomas Matos, Torian Miller, Nick Adams, Zane Phillips\n\nRelated content: The rise of the gay rom-com: Fire Island's Joel Kim Booster & Bros' Billy Eichner redefine the genre\n\n09 of 20\n\nGarden State (2004)\n\nZach Braff's Garden State — the story of a struggling young actor's return home to New Jersey after the death of his mother — is not a perfect movie. Written by Braff during a period of depression and inspired by his own feelings of numbness, the film interrogates themes like mental illness, medication, growing up, and falling in love, sometimes nailing the sentiments and other times falling short. In spite of its deficits, however, the romantic comedy was a sleeper hit when it premiered in 2004, a reception attributable to the film's excellent soundtrack, objectively sick cast, and resonance with a young generation staring down the barrel of adulthood. Starring Braff as Andy, the film's protagonist, and Natalie Portman as his eccentric and compulsively dishonest love interest, the film is often compared to The Graduate (1967), but remains a singular romantic comedy that demands an emotional reaction from its audience. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Garden State: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Zach Braff\n\nCast: Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm, Jean Smart, Jackie Hoffman, Ann Dowd, Method Man, Jim Parsons\n\nRelated content: Zach Braff reflects on writing Garden State's 'manic pixie dream girl': 'I was a very depressed young man'\n\n10 of 20\n\nHappiest Season (2020)\n\nAbby Holland (Kristen Stewart) and Harper Caldwell (Mackenzie Davis) are happy in their relationship nearly a year in. So happy, in fact, that Abby's ready to pop the question during their cozy holiday with Harper's family. She's in for a surprise, however, when she realizes her soon-to-be fiancé hasn't come out to her conservative parents. Now, Abby must navigate the delicate secrets of the Caldwell family if she wants to fight for the woman she loves. Marking Hulu's first LGBTQ+ holiday rom-com, Happiest Season isn't perfect (much like familial relationships) but it gleams with a festive cheer that's enjoyable to stream all year round. —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Happiest Season: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Clea DuVall\n\nCast: Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Dan Levy, Aubrey Plaza, Mary Holland, Mary Steenburgen, Victor Garber, Ana Gasteyer, Jake McDorman, Sarayu Blue\n\nRelated content: Kristen Stewart on making the Yuletide super-gay in Happiest Season\n\n11 of 20\n\nThe Hating Game (2021)\n\nThe two CEOs at this publishing company would be useless without their faithful assistants — who happen to hate each other's guts. Lucy (Lucy Hale) believes in bringing great fashion and an even better attitude to the office, but much to her dismay, her co-worker Joshua (Austin Stowell) has an opposite approach. And their cutthroat competitiveness only intensifies when an enticing managing editor position opens up. Based on Sally Thorne's best-selling romance novel of the same name, The Hating Game may lean into the predictable enemies-to-lovers trope, but that doesn't make it any less charming. —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch The Hating Game: Hulu\n\nDirector: Peter Hutchings\n\nCast: Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Kathryn Boswell, Damon Daunno, Sakina Jaffrey, Corbin Bernsen\n\nRelated content: The best comedy movies on Hulu\n\n12 of 20\n\nJuno (2007)\n\nIn Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning screenplay, quirky and loquacious 16-year-old Juno MacGuff becomes the talk of small-town Minnesota when she finds herself pregnant by track runner (and orange Tic Tac lover) Paulie Bleeker. Juno's razor-sharp dialogue — delivered by dry humor virtuosos Elliot Page and Michael Cera — infuses the film with a cozy and blithe feel, while its poignant moments beautifully capture raw humanity on screen. And Jennifer Garner's stand-out performance as half of the seemingly perfect couple looking to adopt Juno's baby leaves no heart untouched. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Juno: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jason Reitman\n\nCast: Elliot Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Rainn Wilson\n\nRelated content: Juno cast reunites to remember a 'preggo' eggo and 'pork swords' at the Oscars\n\n13 of 20\n\nLove & Other Drugs (2010)\n\nFive years after playing a married couple in the cowboy drama Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway reunite to play opposite each other in Love & Other Drugs. A romantic comedy that lets it all hang out — both physically and emotionally — the film follows a pharmaceutical sales representative (Gyllenhaal) who falls in love with a free spirit afflicted with an incurable disease (Hathaway). Based on Jamie Reidy's 2005 non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman, the film traffics in ideas about love, sex, sickness, health, medical ethics, and the brokenness of America’s healthcare system. Generally known for his more dramatic roles, Gyllenhaal gets a chance to show off his comedic chops through his character, the ethically dubious ne’er-do-well Jamie, and his and Hathaway’s chemistry is more alive than it was in Brokeback Mountain. The film’s nudity and sex scenes are intimate and effective, but side effects include discomfort when watching with the whole family. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Love & Other Drugs: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Edward Zwick\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Josh Gad, Gabriel Macht\n\nRelated content: Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal: Naked truths\n\n14 of 20\n\nPalm Springs (2020)\n\nThis sci-fi-meets-rom-com flick stars Andy Samberg as Nyles, who's on his way to celebrate his buddies Tala and Abe on their wedding day. The only problem? He's headed there again and again after getting stuck in a time loop in the desert, and things only get wilder when the maid of honor/sister of the bride, Sarah (Cristin Milioti), gets stuck there with him. This unexpected take on the romance genre is chock full of nihilism and existential dread as the pair desperately seeks a return to normalcy, but it all works because of the excellent cast. EW's critic notably praises the two leads, as \"Samberg nimbly walks the line between slacker cartoon and actual frustrated human… But it's Milioti who feels most like the revelation here; as great as she's been in brief turns on shows like Black Mirror and 30 Rock, she shines when given the chance to lead.\" —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Palm Springs: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Max Barbakow\n\nCast: Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J.K.

Aspiring editor Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) reluctantly serves as a personal assistant to dictatorial Margaret (Sandra Bullock), a Canadian executive editor-in-chief at a prominent New York City publishing house. When Margaret's U.S. visa application is denied — putting her at risk of deportation — she designs a plan to keep her life in the States by proposing a fake engagement to Andrew, promising him a promotion in return. The (un)happy couple then travels to Andrew's hometown in Sitka, Alaska, where Margaret meets her fake fiancé's family and learns a side to him she never expected. Reynolds and Bullock's undeniable chemistry effortlessly leaps off the screen, while the supporting ensemble (Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, the one-and-only Betty White) adds an extra layer of warmth to this tale set in the Last Frontier. —J.M.\n\nWatch The Proposal on Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Anne Fletcher\n\nCast: Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Malin Åkerman, Craig T.

When lovesick Dom (David Jonsson) cries in a gender-neutral bathroom stall, he's interrupted when an outgoing stranger named Yas (Vivian Oparah) overhears his faint sobs. The two embark on a day-long journey roaming the streets of South London's Rye Lane, bonding over their failed relationships and scheming chaos against their exes. Similar to the story's dynamic pacing, Oparah and Jonsson radiate effervescence, as they seamlessly bounce off each other's energy while the mise-en-scène bursts with a kaleidoscope of experimental camerawork. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Rye Lane: Hulu\n\nDirector: Raine Allen-Miller\n\nCast: David Jonsson, Vivian Oparah, Poppy Allen-Quarmby, Simon Manyonda, Karene Peter, Benjamin Sarpong-Broni, Malcolm Atabroh\n\nRelated content: Stars strike a pose at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival\n\n17 of 20\n\nPretty Woman (1990)\n\nIf you haven't yet seen this '90s classic...big mistake! Big! Huge! Garry Marshall's Golden Globe-nominated flick spins a modern Cinderella story starring the then-rising star Julia Roberts as the unpolished, down-on-her-luck escort Vivian and Richard Gere as leverage buyout executive Edward, who offers her a taste of the high life in exchange for her company at social gatherings. While it's undeniably a product of its time, steeped in outdated gender stereotypes and degrading convictions of sex work, the film was groundbreaking during its initial release, and its enduring charm lies in the palpable chemistry between Gere and Roberts. Even EW's critic, who notoriously panned it with a D grade, had a change of heart 20 years later, bumping it to a B — acknowledging its message that \"you can be a feminist and a seductress, a hooker and a princess, all at the same time\" and how it \"marked Pretty Woman as the rare Hollywood movie that doesn’t just channel the culture but changes it.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Pretty Woman: Hulu\n\nEW grade: D (read the review)\n\nDirector: Garry Marshall\n\nCast: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Ralph Bellamy, Jason Alexander, Héctor Elizondo, Laura San Giacomo, Alex Hyde-White\n\nRelated content: Julia Roberts says Richard Gere's Pretty Woman character is dead now\n\n18 of 20\n\nSleeping With Other People (2015)\n\nCheaters never prosper, except in Sleeping With Other People, a rom-com about two intimacy-challenged serial cheaters who find salvation in each other. After losing their virginities to one another in college, Jake and Lainey (Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie) reconnect after 12 years apart and — despite their admitted sexual attraction and chemistry — decide to just be friends. But when their platonic relationship becomes complicated by their romantic feelings, the two struggle not to let their past mistakes define their future. A modern, dirtier, more drug-filled version of When Harry Met Sally, Sleeping With Other People is, as EW’s critic writes, “a smart, flawed movie about smart, flawed people.” Written and directed by Leslye Headland (Bachelorette), if you’re going to watch one movie where the main characters show up at a children’s birthday high on MDMA, let it be this one. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Sleeping With Other People: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Leslye Headland\n\nCast: Jason Sudeikis, Alison Brie, Amanda Peet, Adam Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Jason Mantzoukas\n\nRelated content: The 10 best Jason Sudeikis movies and TV shows, ranked\n\n19 of 20\n\nTogether Together\n\nA delightful subversion of the single woman having a baby by herself trope, Together Together stars Ed Helms as Matt, a single fortysomething with a deep desire to be a dad — even if he has to do it alone. Matt hires Anna (Patti Harrison), a twentysomething single woman looking to finance her education to be his gestational surrogate, and as her pregnancy progresses, the two learn to navigate the platonic boundaries they’ve set for themselves. Unwilling to engage with typical romantic comedy tropes, Together Together doesn’t provide easy answers to hard questions, but the movie manages to find resolution and hope, even as it explores murky subject matter. Helms and Harrison are terrific and their supporting cast features some of the best — and most underrated — comic actors working today. Released during the pandemic, Together Together flew under the radar at the box office, but the film is well-deserving of a bigger fan club. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Together Together: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nikole Beckwith\n\nCast: Ed Helms, Patti Harrison\n\nRelated content: Patti Harrison and Ed Helms spark a friendship over a surrogacy in Together Together trailer\n\n20 of 20\n\nThe Worst Person in the World (2021)\n\nA Norwegian romantic comedy that enraptured critics and festival viewers alike, The Worst Person in the World tells the story of Julie (Renate Reinsve) over four years of her life in Oslo as she struggles to make sense of her career, love life, and the gap between who she is and who she wants to be. A refreshing look at life during the painful transition between a person’s late-20s and early-30s when life’s stakes seem higher than ever, EW’s critic writes that The Worst Person in the World “vibrates with real life, a film so fresh and untethered to rom-com cliché it might actually reshape the idea of what movies like this can be.” Reinsve is phenomenal in the role of Julie and it’s thanks to her performance, the film’s wistful and compassionate script, and Joachim Trier’s masterful direction that The Worst Person in the World is considered one of the best movies of 2021. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Worst Person in the World: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Joachim Trier\n\nCast: Renate Reinsve, Anders Danielsen Lie, Herbert Nordrum\n\nRelated content: The most shocking snubs and surprises of the 2022 Oscar nominations"
