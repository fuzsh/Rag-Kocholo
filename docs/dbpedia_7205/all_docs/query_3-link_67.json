        "text": "The Road to El Dorado is a 2000 American animated adventure musical fantasy comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation, and the studio's third film, after Antz and The Prince of Egypt.\n\nPlot[]\n\nTwo con-men named Tulio and Miguel (Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh) get hold of a map to the lost City of Gold, El Dorado, which is in Mexico. After stowing away onto one of the ships of the Spanish explorer Cortez, the pair escapes and eventually do find the city. There, a priest named Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) proclaims them to be gods in a scheme to win control of the city for himself. Meanwhile, they meet a beautiful girl named Chel (Rosie Perez) who helps them in their ruse.\n\nVoice cast[]\n\nKevin Kline as Tulio, a con artist and Miguel's friend. He is the strategic planner, often becoming anxious and overthinking things.\n\nKenneth Branagh as Miguel, a con artist and Tulio's friend. Miguel is more relaxed and laid-back in contrast to Tulio's more frantic nature. Miguel becomes accustomed to the peaceful life in El Dorado and values the city's people as opposed to the gold.\n\nRosie Perez as Chel, a beautiful woman from El Dorado who discovers Tulio and Miguel's con and decides to play along in hopes of escaping El Dorado with them for a life of adventure.\n\nArmand Assante as Tzekel-Kan, the fanatically vicious high priest who has a religious fixation for human sacrifices. He initially believes Tulio and Miguel are gods until he discovers the truth.\n\nEdward James Olmos as Chief Tannabok, the chief of El Dorado who was very skeptical of Tulio and Miguel being gods, but treats them with kindness and hospitality because of the good they show to his people.\n\nJim Cummings as Hernán Cortés, the merciless and ambitious conquistador leader of the expedition to find gold from the empires of the New World.\n\nLeonard Cohen as the cook on Cortés's ship, a warrior who gets stepped on by Tzekel-Kan's stone jaguar, and the native who warns Chief Tannabok about Cortés.\n\nFrank Welker as Altivo, Cortés' horse who befriends Tulio and Miguel.\n\nWelker also voices the Bull that chases Miguel and Tulio at the beginning of the movie.\n\nTobin Bell as Zaragoza, a sailor on the voyage to the New World of El Dorado and the original owner of the map, which he loses to Tulio and Miguel after a game of dice.\n\nElton John as The Singing Narrator\n\nAnne Lockhart as Girl in Barcelona (uncredited)\n\nBob Bergen as Jaguar (uncredited)\n\nDuncan Marjoribanks as Acolyte\n\nAdditional voices[]\n\nJack Angel\n\nBob Bergen\n\nRodger Bumpass\n\nGino Conforti\n\nJennifer Darling\n\nPatti Deutsch\n\nPete Docter\n\nBobby Edner\n\nAshley Edner\n\nPaul Eiding\n\nKatie Evans\n\nBill Farmer\n\nKeegan Farrell\n\nPat Fraley\n\nTerese Ganzel\n\nTaylor Gifaldi\n\nMarc John Jefferies\n\nJoe Lala\n\nNoah Luke\n\nSherry Lynn\n\nDanny Mann\n\nMona Marshall\n\nMickie McGowan\n\nLaraine Newman\n\nKay Panabaker\n\nPhil Proctor\n\nJosh Qualtieri\n\nJan Rabson\n\nLisa Raggio\n\nKatheine Ringgold\n\nDavid Silverman\n\nJim Thornton\n\nLee Unkrich\n\nWhy It's Pure Gold[]\n\nThe film has a very decent story about a pair of con artists ending up in a city where they're mistake for Gods by the residents of said town (with some other major plot points and supremely likable and humorous characters being added to kick the would-be thin story up and make it into a true extravaganza of a film).\n\nThe animation is beautiful and that the gold looked like actual gold (not to mention how the film is absolutely filled with gold). The color palette for said animation is also very lively and bright, especially for El Dorado itself (which is remarkable given the fact that it's, quite literally, a city made of gold, but don't let that fool you, as it's actually filled from top to bottom with bright and eye-catching colors). And the animation itself is smooth in a similar manner to DreamWorks previous 2-D animated movies (e.g., Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, The Prince of Egypt) and the characters' movements even have some slight hints of realistic human movement to them.\n\nAnother aspect about the animation that's truly remarkable is the fact that the animation for the backgrounds, characters, and settings all take influence from the art during ancient Mesoamerican times. Which really helps the city of El Dorado feel more like, well, El Dorado!\n\nTulio, Miguel, Chel and Altivo, funny, likable, and memorable characters/ The former trait of which especially applying to almost every single cast member, particularly when it comes to the main duo.\n\nMiguel is the more relaxed and easygoing out of the main duo who prefers to live in the present rather than look back-ahead of time. He comes to love the peaceful life in El Dorado and comes to see the city for more than just its gold.\n\nTulio is more of a strategic planner than his con-partner, Miguel, serving as the brains by being the one to come up with their schemes. He often becoming anxious and overthinking things.\n\nChel is a beautiful and snarky Mesoamerican woman from El Dorado who discovers Tulio and Miguel's con and decides to play along to get out from El Dorado. At first, she only tags along with Tulio and Miguel for the sake of adventure, but later ends up falling in love with one of them.\n\nAltivo is Cortés' horse who befriends Tulio and Miguel who's pretty much \"the Maximus from Tangled before there was Tangled\". He also makes a lot of complex and even pretty comedic expressions throughout the course of the movie.\n\nOn the subject of the film's characters, Tzekel-Kan is a very intimidating villain (despite not pulling all of the big punches towards the main duo's chemistry being tested). As he is a high priest who is absorbed in the belief that the Gods were actually merciless beings and is determined to make the civilians of El Dorado live in fear because of them by continuously offering sacrifices. And unlike most other animated movies villains, his main goal isn't to gain more power, but rather he is motivated by his beliefs, which makes him a more interesting and even threatening antagonist.\n\nA lot of funny moments like:\n\nMiguel and Tulio being stranded in the ocean on a rowboat with Altivo.\n\nThe bull chase scene.\n\nAn El Dorado warrior gets mauled, chewed on, and finally thrown to the ground by the jaguar statue.\n\nMiguel and Tulio, upon seeing the giant stone jaguar, performing the best girly scream ever to be featured in a movie unison.\n\nThe main duo's excuse that they come up with for not sacrificing an innocent man to Xibalba.\n\nMiguel and Tulio's first test as gods in El Dorado, involving the conveniently erupting volcano.\n\nPretty much any time Chel makes a snarky comment (which happens a lot in the film).\n\nSome of the songs such as \"Friends Never Say Goodbye\" and especially \"It's Tough To Be A God\" are pretty catchy.\n\nAmazing voice acting, especially by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh as Miguel and Tulio respectively.\n\nThe movie is highly quotable, to the same extent of Shrek. Quotes include \"On the one hard, gold. On the other hand, painful agonizing failure!\", \"HOLY SHIP!\", \"The stars are not in position for this tribute!\", \"Both is good\" and \"Don't blame me\", \"I blame you!\".\n\nSome of Miguel and Tulio's dialogue was improvised, such as where Tulio asked \"Where are the pickles?\"\n\nTobin Bell got to voice Zaragota in the opening before he became famous for Saw.\n\nJim Cummings was a placeholder for voicing Cortes, but his work is so good, the crew kept him as Cortes' voice actor.\n\nThe innuendos aren't as jarring as Antz.\n\nGiven how the main plot of the film is about Miguel and Tulio, a pair con artists, ending up in the City of Gold and being mistaken for Gods, it would likely be expected by some that the movie would follow the standard \"liar revealed\" plotline by having the two lie in order to stay in the city and then be forced to tell the truth and win by staying true to who they really are in order to save the day. But, on the contrary, that's not what actually happens. As instead, it focuses on Tulio and Miguel's relationship was one of the film's main plot points and how their relationship is tested over the course of the film, with a lot of obstacles being thrown in in an attempt to separate them, and to see if they are so close that they won't do so and find that they still care about each other.\n\nThe emphasis of humor and wackiness is quite ahead of it's time given the success of the similarly themed Shrek.\n\nKevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh got to record their lines together, making the characters' show some chemistry.\n\nBad Qualities[]\n\nSome forgettable songs.\n\nSome of the humor is rather weak and unfunny.\n\nThe plot, while decent, can get a bit thin at times.\n\nThe scene in which Chel is making out with Tulio is very suggesting and really inappropriate for a children's movie, given the sexual innuendo behind it. And judging by Chel's position while having fun with Tulio, it seems that her face was behind Tulio's. Really, it looks that the censors decided to take the day off when they should have checked this scene.\n\nTzekel-Kan's insistence to sacrifice many Mayans for their gods starts to look boring every time he brings it up, which makes Miguel firing him from his position very satisfying.\n\nThe CGI is at its most obvious when looking at the gold during the climax.\n\nReception[]\n\nThe Road to El Dorado received mixed reviews by critics and audiences alike upon it's release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 105 reviews and an average rating of 5.49/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Predictable story and thin characters made the movie flat.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nUnder the working title \"El Dorado: City of Gold\", the film was originally scheduled for release in fall of 1999.\n\nThe armadillo that follows Miguel and Tulio throughout is named Bibo, after co-director Bibo Bergeron.\n\nDenis Leary and Jim Carrey were considered the role of Miguel while Antonio Banderas and Adam Sandler were considered the role of Tulio.\n\nJim Carrey would later go on to play Horton the Elephant in 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky's adaptation of the Dr. Suess book Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 and Dr. Eggman in Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequel in the 2020's.\n\nTzekel-Kan's sacred book contains a picture of a man fishing from the moon, a take on DreamWorks' logo.\n\nThis is the only Dreamworks movie to use traditional animation to not have the word “of” in the title."
