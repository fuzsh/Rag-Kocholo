        "meta_description": "Limited Theatrical Release - Struggling after the loss of his wife, the future looks bleak for Jerry McDonald. As a single-parent, tennis has become his only semi-social outlet with his eccentric best friend, Miles, who’s working through anger management with the help of his life coach (Judd Nelson). Reluctantly, Jerry caves to Miles’ pressure to play in a local tournament that could earn them a once in a life-time slot in an exhibition match at a prestigious national tournament, The Open. But they‘ll have to meet the infamous Gollant Brothers (Eric Roberts and John Schneider) who haven’t lost club champions status for a decade. Let the training begin. Tyler, Jerry’s precocious 10 year-old daughter, has faithfully accepted that her mom has gone to heaven, but longs to see Dad “happy again”. For Jerry, the thought of finding love is as foreign as winning the tournament, until Tyler asks the looming question, “Do you think you’ll ever get married again?” Encouraged to step out, Jerry gets the guts to talk with Sam, a cute co-worker and new friend. Tyler loves her and it appears things are looking up. Life is full of twists and turns, and some are hard to overcome. But a second serve is a precious gift, and a double fault can be tragic. For Jerry, Road to the Open is a journey to live again, to love again. For movie goers, it’s a classic underdog story that is waiting to bring smiles and cheers.",

        "text": "Here is a story about renewing hope when hope is lost. Jerry McDonald (Troy McKay) is a widower and is raising his ten year old daughter, Tyler (Kasse McDonald). He is best friends with Miles Worth (Phillip DeVona) and Miles is his partner in tennis. Their goal is to win a tournament, especially against the Golant Brothers. Jerry doesn’t have the confidence he needs but things improve when he meets a young woman named Sam (Michelle Gunn) at work and they like each other. She believes in him and before he knows it Jerry is opening his heart up for the first time since his wife died of breast cancer some three years before.\n\nJust when everything is going his way, Jerry stumbles and loses his new self confidence. This leads to a decision he must make–should he forget about Sam since he feels he is not worthy of her, or is she the shot in the arm he desperately needs to move forward in his life? The quote, “No guts, no glory” is one of the focus points of the movie. We are pleased to award this inspirational story our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal for ages twelve plus. This one reminds the viewer that hope must be kept alive!"
