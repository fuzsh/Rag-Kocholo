        "text": "Laughter really is the best medicine. Netflix’s A Family Affair hits all the marks of true comic relief from the film’s opening scene until its last.\n\nDirector Richard LaGravenese took Carrie Solomon’s script about a young woman’s dilemma when her mother and movie star boss have an affair and turned it into rom-com gold. Viewers loved it and binge-watched en masse.\n\nThe film debuted at No. 1 on the Netflix Top 10 English Films List with 26.8 million views in just three days, making it the most-watched title of the week.\n\nNicole Kidman portrays Brooke Harwood, a successful writer, widow, and mother. Her daughter Zara, brilliantly portrayed by the very funny Joey King, works for one of Hollywood's biggest A-list movie stars, Chris Cole (Zac Efron). Zara’s worst nightmare comes true when her mom and boss fall madly in love. Chaos of the most hilarious kind ensues when she discovers the two in a compromising position soon after quitting her assistant job. King has a real gift for physical comedy and it’s one of the funniest scenes I’ve seen in years.\n\nBy bailing on Chris, she unwittingly set up the chance for her mom and former boss to meet after years of working for him with no such encounter. Kathy Bates stars as Kidman’s mother-in-law and King’s grandmother, a voice of reason amidst the madness.\n\nThe movie centers around a younger man falling for a woman 20 years his senior, which is a refreshing take on the romantic comedy genre. There is serious chemistry between Kidman and Efron, likely because they worked together before in the 2012 drama The Paperboy.\n\nOverall, this movie made me laugh from start to finish. If you loved this one too, and want to continue the binge, here are five romantic comedies currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nMother of the Bride\n\nHere is another charming rom-com that centers on a mother's love life. When Lana’s (Brooke Shields) daughter Emma (Miranda Cosgrove) returns from abroad, she drops a bombshell: she's getting married and the wedding is set to take place in Thailand in one month. Why is love always so complicated? Lana soon discovers that the man who captured Emma's heart is the son of the man (Benjamin Bratt) who broke her heart years ago. This gem spent five weeks in the Global Top 10 Films list, racking up 71.1 million views.\n\nIrish Wish\n\nIf you thought your mother dating your boss was tough, imagine being secretly in love with him yourself! When the love of her life gets engaged to her best friend, Maddie (Lindsay Lohan) puts her feelings aside to be a bridesmaid at their wedding in Ireland. Days before the pair are set to marry, Maddie makes a spontaneous wish for true love and finds herself in an alternate reality. Have you ever heard of the saying about being careful what you wish for because you just might get it? With her dream coming true, Maddie soon realizes that her real soulmate is someone else entirely. This comedy spent three weeks in the Global Top 10 Films.\n\nSet It Up\n\nIf you related more with Joey King’s beleaguered assistant than her lovestruck mother then this one's for you. Zoey Deutch stars alongside man-of-the-moment Glen Powell (now starring in Hit Man) as two overworked assistants who conspire to create sparks between their hotshot bosses, played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs. This longtime favorite has maintained a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes since its release in 2018.\n\nAlways Be My Maybe\n\nIf you are looking for another film that captures the difficulty of dating a celebrity, Ali Wong and Randall Park have you covered in this hilarious rom-com about famous chef Saha (Ali Wong) and hometown musician Marcus (Randall Park) who are reunited after 15 years apart. The old sparks of attraction remain stronger than ever, but the two struggle to adapt to each other’s worlds.\n\nYour Place or Mine\n\nReese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher star in Your Place or Mine as best friends, Debbie and Peter. They are total opposites; she craves routine with her son in Los Angeles and he thrives on excitement and change in New York. When they swap houses and lives for a week they discover what they think they want might not be what they need.\n\nThe road to love is often paved with sharp rocks and confusing detours but these rom coms will make you laugh out loud along the way. Enjoy the binge!"
