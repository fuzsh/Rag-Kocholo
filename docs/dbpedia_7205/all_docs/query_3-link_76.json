INTERNATIONAL TITLE: A Journey to Love. Company: Linmon Pictures Weibo ; ---> Drama Weibo\n\nJuly 20, 2022 - the show released a concept poster and officially announced the full lineup with a stellar cast including 6 main leads (Cecilia Liu / Liu Shishi 刘诗诗, Liu Yuning 刘宇宁, Alen Fang / Fang Yilun 方逸伦, He Landou 何蓝逗, Amy Chen / Chen Haoyu 陳昊宇, Chang Huasen 常华森).\n\nThe drama was to be directed by Zhou Yuan Zhou 周远舟 (who formerly directed 2016 Noble Aspirations, season1 &2, and Sparrow, and 2018 Guardian), and Zou Xi 邹曦 (who worked on 2016 The Mystic Nine, 2018 The Tomb of the Sea, 2020 Ultimate Note). Dubbing Directors were: Bai Haozan 白杺瓒, Ke Kaiwen 柯凯闻, Li Na 李娜, Zhang Huilin 张惠霖\n\nSome actors/actresses are dubbed :\n\nLiu Shishi (Ren Ruyi / Ren Xin, top assassin) by Bai Xin Zan\n\nChang Huasen (Li Tong Guang) by Qian Wen Qing\n\nChen Du Ling (Xiao Yan empress of Wu) by Zhang Zhe\n\nZhang Tian Yang (Yang Xingyuan, emperor of Wu) by Wei Chao\n\nZeng Ke Lang (Yang Xingjian /Prince Dan Yang supervisor of Wu) by Yu Chang Yu\n\nGuo Xiao Tian (Xu Jun, \"calvary\" member of Liu Dao sect and imperial guard of Wu, in ep.1) by Yi Fan\n\nZhang Qiao Er (Liu Li, former maid in Scarlet Guards) by Liu Man\n\nChen Ze (Yu Lang, Liu Li's lover and Mr. Yue's apprentice) by Zhang Si Wang Zhi\n\nHuang Meng Ying (Jin Mei Niang) by Li Shi Meng\n\nFilming took place in Hengdian Film and Television City from September 13, 2022, to January 3, 2023, while final shots and wrap took place on January 13, 2023.\n\nDuring that filming, Liu Yuning was injured on set and suffered a broken foot. He nevertheless went on filming stoically, despite he needed crutches and wheelchair outside the shots. He was still recovering during the CNY festival gala in February.\n\nThe crew went to Dunhuang for the \"Battle of Tianxing Gorge\" scene in the play. It took half a month and more than 800 shots to complete.\n\nHengdian Film and Television City, founded in 1996, are the largest cinema studios in China. They are located in Hengdian Town, Dongyang City and Jinhua City in Zhejiang Province. More than 4,000 film and television works have been filmed there, to date. It is also a high level tourist attraction, with easy transport access from Hangzhou, 180 km away (bus links), or Jinhua's Yiwu airport, 90 km away, or closer still, Wenzhou (WNZ) Airport or Taizhou (HYN) airports, which are about 45 km distance, about 1h away by taxi.\n\nThe small Dongyang Hengdian airport, close to studios, was built from 2018-2022 mostly for emergency purposes, but will also have business jet operation and tourist charter flights next.\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the drama released the \"On the Road\" version of the group portrait poster and the \"Taofeng Rimu\" poster behind-the-scenes.\n\nIn December 2022, a controversy arose about videos of\"injured martial artist personnel defending their rights\", following a claim by one man that the crew of \"One Thought Guanshan\" (word-for-word translation of the Chinese title of the drama) was unwilling to resolve the issue of injury expenses. It sparked heated discussion until the crew published a response on their Weibo social media page, on December 8, 2022, saying that the contents of the reporter's video were all untrue remarks.\n\nThis drama was Liu Shishi's comeback to wuxia costume drama since 2017 Lost Love in Times. --Note: she is voiced by Bai Xin Zan in this drama.\n\nIn January 2023, the production released final pictures, one kiss scene between Liu Shishi and Liu Yuning Reuters.\n\nOn May 1, the play was selected into the 2023 iQiyi World Conference film list. A first TRAILER was released.\n\nIn September 2023, the production released a new trailer and, a Mid-Autumn Festival poster.\n\nNovember 1, a poster with over one million reservations was published; and on November 3, the play was selected into iQiyi’s November film list, to be aired from November 24. Behind-the-scenes footage and a 3rd trailer were released on the 23rd ; three posters and stills were published on the 24th ; the OST playlist was revealed on the 25th, followed by an MV on the 26th, and a poster with reservations exceeding 2 million, in addition to the character connection diagram ; next day, a poster announced 3 million reservations together with the theme song MV. On the 28th, a4th trailer, the international version poster, the drama calendar, and again a poster announcing over 3.5 million reservations.\n\nNovember 1, a poster with over one million reservations was published; and on November 3, the play was selected into iQiyi’s November film list, to be aired from November 24. Behind-the-scenes footage were released on the 23rd ; three posters and stills were published on the 24th ; the OST playlist was revealed on the 25th, followed by an MV on the 26th, and a poster with reservations exceeding 2 million, in addition to the character connection diagram ; next day, a poster announced 3 million reservations together with the theme song MV.\n\nOn the 28th, a new trailer, the international version poster, the drama calendar, and again a poster announcing over 3.5 million reservations\n\nLikewise, the production released posters celebrating the heat index of the drama, after its release on November 28, 2023 at 19:00 hrs, Beijing time, on original network iQiyi (infuriating international audiences in several countries for being \"geoblocked\" there for \"copyright\" issues). The first 8 episodes were released rapid-fire in two days, with this mention \"iQiyi members will be updated with 6 episodes for the first time, and 2 episodes will be updated every day for 7 consecutive days. Starting from December 7, members will be updated with 2 episodes every Thursday to Sunday at 19:00. So there will be a hiatus with no episodes for three days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) to further frustrate audiences ;-)\n\nIn three hours from 21:02 to 22:22 on premiere date Nov.28, the heat index skyrocketed from 6000 to 7000, and by mid-morning on November 29, it had broken 8000, rising to 9000 in the popularity index before the day was over, yet again reaching 9500 (max is supposedly 10000) late at night. Almost too fast to publish the relevant popularity posters! It finally broke 10,000 on Dec.3, 2023 at 22:00 hrs Beijing time.\n\nOn November 29, the production released a set of large \"Gobi\" desert sepia colored pictures (戈壁大片) :\n\nand some funny cartoon-like ones :\n\nOn November 29, a short presentation by the cast was aired as mini \"interactive interview\" (1'07) :\n\nDespite the continuing trouble in end of November to watch it on iQiyi in several countries, the drama could be accessed on other platforms ; it is on Viu in the Philippines with this trailer.\n\nAnd on Nov.29, 2023, media reports confirmed that South Korea had purchased the broadcast rights of the drama : \"the broadcast method will be the original sound plus subtitles\".\n\nMany different posters have been released such as the one to the left. The (provisional) latest were published on Dec.1 : it may be too difficult to track all the different posters release. For the visuals, many are in the MDL photo gallery of the drama.\n\nPictured above : Dec 4, 2023 Cast team building activity at Sina, with live streams etc.\n\nThe poster Calendar of airing (28 Nov-23 Dec 2023) warned about key moments, battles etc.\n\nLink to Weibo mini feature with cast and crew comments (in Chinese)\n\nscreenwriter: Zhang Wei 张巍\n\nproducer: Fang Yan Zhi 方晏之\n\nFL actress: Liu Shi Shi 刘诗诗\n\nML actor: Liu Yuning 刘宇宁\n\nSML actor: Fang Yilun 方逸伦\n\nSFL actress: He Landou 何蓝逗\n\nSML actor: Chang Huasen 常华森\n\nSupport actress: Chen Haoyu 陈昊宇\n\nSML actor: Chen Youwei 陈宥维\n\nSML actor: Wang Yizhe 王一哲\n\nSupport actor: Li Huan 李欢\n\nAssistant Director : Zhou Jingtao 周 靖韬 (3:33)\n\nChief Producer : Qi Shuai 齐帅 (3:40)\n\nDirector: Zou Xi 邹曦 (3:52)\n\nMUSIC : Baidu listed an impressive list of 60 numbers for the OST, released on 2023-11-25； 10 songs have been translated by Peachey Blossom (thanks for her efforts!).

(click to follow links)\n\nback to Table of contents\n\nOpening rating as of Dec.6 reporting by the Marcus Here! channel on YouTube - Not bad as the drama is still unfolding:\n\nChoosing among the comments these ones :\n\n\"A Journey to Love deserves a higher douban-- 9.0. The cast is excellent. Liu Yuning's Ning performance is charming and heart-warming, exuding a casual confidence ... Liu Shishi is brilliant, and that amazing young girl He Lan Dou delivers a memorable performance as the Princess/Prince. So far, the plot is quite compelling, we are halfway through the drama. And the music -- simply wonderful! Liu Yuning's rendition is awesome! I am running out of adjectives...\"\n\n\"Journey to love is a good drama. The humor is what making it very special. I look forward to every episode .\"\n\n\"I am quite happy with the opening rating of Journey to Love... I didn't expect much from it initially but to my surprise, it is really well done, so far the characters and the storyline has been quite engaging and exciting, I hope it maintains the quality till the end. So I will give 8 to AJTL It was quite disappointing and low of people to bully and criticise Liu Yu Ning for his looks, i truly respect him for handling such things strongly and maturely, despite having much industrial backup he is quite hardworking and I hope he keeps growing, still I wonder how ppl doesn't consider him good looking, are they blind???plus he doing a phenomenal job in AJTL:)\"\n\n\"I am also following Journey of Love. I love Liu Yuning’s response, and sometimes, you don't have to talk about what they said, and he did what I would have done. I think he is pretty attractive to me. He received a Weibo award today, which shows that he is promising. I do agree; his singing is excellent, but his acting is not bad too. The ratings ...are not high; I would give ... at least an 8, though. \"\n\n\"I really liked a journey to love.the cast is great and the acting on point \"\n\nA Journey to Love was TOP among the 10 most watched c-dramas of the week ending Sunday Dec.10, 2023\n\nthe production also issued this poster :\n\nand Sina activity of Dec.4, 2023 picture (when the cast had a live streaming activity) :\n\n[Dec.24 comment/edit] Roller-coasting all the way up to 8.5 on the Weibo score, with many in the cast (especially Chang Huasen as Li Tongguang) gaining much recognition, the Douban score went down to 6.9, after fierce battles on screen between the contending kingdoms, and off screen between fans who were also divided in many factions, some demanding an unlikely end fitting their own preferences. Still, it maintained its spot as number one drama watched by audiences in China for two weeks running, until ceding the top spot to The Last Immortal in the week ending Dec.23, despite stiff competition from that anticipated dramas. It garnered 599 points then to TLI's 605 so both can be said to have been \"super popular\".\n\nSo, to sum it up: many pure wuxia lovers hailed the drama as exemplary, in the vicinity of 10//10, while romance lovers (those who had grown too invested in the very well individualized characters) were angry about what they felt was hasty, depressing end and wanted to shoot the drama down accordingly, even claiming it did not fit the \"original narrative\" (disregarding that there was no novel or story pre-existing : this was a totally original script). Especially the international audiences, misled by the \"...to Love\" title; but also Chinese audiences, who only saw the allegorical title \"thought about the Close Mountain /Guan Shan 关山\" Chinese title. -- My view: 10/10. Characterization, cinematography, gripping plot, and despite some side cast that sometimes just vanished \"on the roadside\" of that fateful journey . Not really plot holes: these characters had served their purpose, and it is only normal, in such a sprawling saga, where these were just \"supporting\" or \"guests\", that they should not hog more time than necessary; so, either leave them to heal their wounds somewhere, or kill them off, which could have been too cruel, thus only a random number did \"die\". (Or did they somehow survive through plotting their public demise once again, but managed to get away to their wished for anonymous \"after-life\" down on Earth or on another plane of existence?). The lines were sometimes too well defined, but thoughtfully left also something to imagination, helping the anticipation, and even allowing a seed of hope of a \"hidden end\" after the conclusion.\n\nFor once, I would agree with Avenue X's final appreciation of this drama as \"the BEST period drama of 2023\". I didn't totally agree with her estimates of age for LTG (I thought is he was older - 10 years at least passed between he was left by Ren Xin and his servant was dismissed, ending up as laundry maid before LTG saved her from the death sentence pronounced by Consort Chu, although he did mention in ep.22 that he was 22 then), still, Chu Yue can't be middle aged, sick and dying , in the end, she was in her early twenties (ep.24 mention), to be betrothed to LTG, and only 10 years went by after the final battles. Also, if I do agree that the obsession of LTG was too protracted and should not have been used to \"kill off\" the Liudao warriors, Chang Huasen was still interesting and memorable, whether or not it was written in by the studio to help him rise in career with them. Everybody agrees that He Landou was a star to discover here, so I am pleased with that, as I am by Avenue X's defense of Liu Yuning who is just an excellent actor. Liu Shishi was too, in her \"cold\" assassin role with perfectly controlled ballet like movements (not surprising that she was, indeed, trained as ballerina!) The two had adequate chemistry on screen, and it was nice to see that they had good cheer together off screen too. I rather liked that the drama did not fall into the mushy tons of kisses category: wuxia should not be like that.\n\nBut one romantic scene could get a poetical explanation : After Ning Yuanzhou and Ren Ruyi bowed to each other in the series, what do the three butterflies fluttering on Ning Yuanzhou's shoulders mean?\n\nCould these be the souls representing Qian Zhao, Sun Lang and Yuan Lu or the brothers who died in Liudaotang, coming to witness the confidential wedding, even after sunset?\n\nback to Table of contents link\n\nPLAYLISTS AND MVs\n\nSubsections below :\n\nOST from A Journey of Love\n\nOST Songs from Liu Yuning\n\nSome non OST Songs from Liu Yuning\n\nSongs covers from Liu Yuning\n\nSinging together with Liu Yuning\n\n1/ OST SONGS FROM A JOURNEY TO LOVE\n\nLovely singing by Liu Yuning in this Weibo TV and Internet summit 2023 awards ceremony (2:05 to 5:40)\n\nand the official MV (opening theme song《奉上》) [Fèng shàng] Offer\n\n+ Peachey Blossom's Lyrics MV of 《奉上》 (Hanzi, pinyin, English translation) and 10 songs playlist + sneakpeek and \"full OST MV\" on YouTube.\n\nAlternatively : Sarann's Full OST with timestamps, lyrics in Hanzi and pinyin + subtitles :\n\n00:00 1. 奉上 (Offer) - 摩登兄弟 刘宇宁 (Modern Brothers Liu Yuning)\n\n03:52 2. 一念关山 (A Journey to Love title song)- 任贤齐 (Ren Xianqi)\n\n07:57 3. 立剑 (Standing Sword) - 张杰 (Zhang Jie)\n\n11:30 4. 长醉 (Long Drunk) - 光良 (Guang Liang)\n\n15:49 5. 何故春回 (What is the reason for Spring's return) - 张栋梁 (Nicholas Teo)\n\n20:06 6. 半世风霜 (Half a lifetime of suffering) - 袁娅维 (Tia Ray)\n\n24:22 7. 别梦寒 (Don't dream of the cold) - 摩登兄弟 刘宇宁 (Modern Brothers Liu Yuning)\n\n28:03 8. 怕梦 (Afraid of Dreams) - 黄霄雲 (Huang Xiaoyun)\n\n32:35 9. 还未曾 (Not Yet/Still Haven't) - 不才 (Bu Cai)\n\n37:28 10. 长醉 (Long Drunk, chant version) - 冯甜甜 (Feng Tiantian)\n\nOfficial MV of title song A Journey To Love, sung by Ren Xianqi :\n\nOfficial MV of Half a Life of Suffering, sung by Tia Ray :\n\nEnd theme song by Guang Liang 光良 (illustrious stage name of celebrated mandopop singer Michael Wong) : Long Drunk (长醉) :\n\n2/ OST SONGS FROM LIU YUNING\n\nHe has so many well-known songs that it would be impossible to list them all below.
