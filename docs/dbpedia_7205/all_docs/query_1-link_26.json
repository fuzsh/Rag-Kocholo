        "text": "Festival favourite Frederick Lau (THE PERFECT SECRET GFF21, VICTORIA) delivers an outstanding performance in ONE FOR THE ROAD, a deeply touching and distinctly authentic story set between Berlin’s famous bars and sober therapy rooms. Mark (Lau) seems to have easily mastered life between his demanding job as a construction manager and rambunctious forays into Berlin’s nightlife. That is, until he is stopped by the police one night, and temporarily loses his driving license until he completes a course. Mark bets his best friend Nadim that he will not drink any alcohol until he gets his license back, but his friends are skeptical that he will succeed. During the course he meets Helena (Nora Tschirner, RABBIT WITHOUT EARS) who also doesn't believe in his determination. While at first Mark is confident of victory, disillusionment follows, causing him to evaluate whether he has a more serious problem than he thought. Temptations lurk everywhere in this amusing tragicomedy from director Markus Goller (25KM/H GFF19) that dives into the highs and lows of drinking and the meaning of true friendship."
