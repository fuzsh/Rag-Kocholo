        "text": "We’ve all had that dream – leaving our worldly possessions behind, grabbing our boards, and embarking on the surf-road-trip of a lifetime. For most of us, uprooting our whole lives to surf simply isn’t an option, and we are left living vicariously through folks like Matty Hannon, and his new film The Road To Patagonia.\n\nThis documentary film was shot over 16 years and masterfully condensed into 90 minutes. It is a testament to his patience, intimacy, and the journey itself. Without a dedicated camera crew, and on a very limited budget, Matty somehow produces what is certainly one of the great surfing stories of our age.\n\n“The greatest mistake of all, would be to live in fear of making one.”\n\n– Matty Hannon\n\nAside from some great surfing and stunning visuals, it raises deep and introspective questions about our relationships with the natural world and how capitalism has disrupted them.\n\nThe Road To Patagonia gives us a first-hand experience of Matty’s epic surfing journey – starting at the northern edge of Alaska, down the west coast of the Americas, and finally ending at the southern tip of Patagonia. It’s an epic journey covering 50,000 kilometres, with many twists and turns – with an unexpected love story that becomes the heart of it all.\n\nFirst on a motorcycle, Matty is eventually joined by a few loyal companions, including the love of his life, Heather Hillier, a permaculture farmer from British Columbia, who buys a bike and joins him down in Mexico. They eventually ditch the bikes in favor of four loyal horses – presenting new unique challenges but also deepening their connection to the land, and slowing their journey to a more intimate pace.\n\nThroughout their epic journey, Matty and Heather (and their horses) face numerous challenges that, on multiple occasions, threaten to bring the voyage to an abrupt halt. But through it all, Matty is driven by a boundless curiosity and desire to uncover new ways of understanding the world – learning from local cultures and engaging with indigenous wisdom to question and redefine his relationship with nature.\n\nIt’s an epic personal odyssey – and at its core, a reminder that most adventures are made by the journey rather than the destination.\n\nIt’s an epic personal odyssey – and at its core, a reminder that most adventures are made by the journey rather than the destination.\n\nA fixation on the destination seemed to cripple Matty for most of the journey. He was under constant pressure to keep moving forward, which was enough to coax him away from perfect waves, and from Heather. But his arrival in Patagonia seemed anticlimactic, and a stark realisation came to light. It wasn’t about the destination at all – no matter how stunning Patagonia is. It was instead the countless hours spent on the road and on horseback, the breakdowns, barriers, and near-death experiences – along with perfect waves, stand-up barrels, and beautiful sunrises – that made this story one worth telling.\n\nThe final product, I’m sure, is far from what Matty had initially envisioned during his first few days of biking along the dirt roads of northern Alaska. On paper, it was a reasonably straightforward plan. In practice, it was anything but that – growing organically and mutating into an epic journey with unpredictable twists and genuine character. It would be so easy to romanticise the journey, but instead, Matty and Heather documented it in a raw and honest manner, even when they were left in dire straits. It balanced the good with the bad and managed to tell a captivating story, with stunning cinematography and stylish surfing as an added bonus.\n\nThe Road To Patagonia is reflective, political, and introspective as hell. Mesmerising in its cinematography, soundtrack, and surfing. Sappy, and a little cheesy, sure. But it is a love story, after all …\n\nOne thing’s for sure: Matty’s journey is one that most of us have only dreamed of and will keep your eyes (and hearts) glued to the screen. But watch with caution: if there’s any film that will inspire you to quit your job, drop everything, and road trip the coast with your surfboard, it’s this one.\n\nBut watch with caution: if there’s any film that will inspire you to quit your job, drop everything, and road trip the coast with your surfboard, it’s this one.\n\nWIN TICKETS!\n\nEnter to win a double ticket to see The Road To Patagonia in theatres!
