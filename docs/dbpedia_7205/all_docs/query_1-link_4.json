Armando and Lucía are the aged parents, and Cecilia, Rigoberto (known as \"Toronja\"), Breiner and Darío are their adult children. Fabián, known as \"Peluche\", is an adoptive son. Armando wins a truck race with Cecilia as his co-pilot. In doing so Cecilia reveals that her brothers taught her to drive trucks, which Armando disapproves of. She runs away with the truck, unaware that the prize had been stored in it. Tulio gave pursuit, as the Briceño had a monetary debt and he intended to confiscate their truck. Tulio gets the truck and, unknown to the family, gets the prize money as well. The initial plots are about the attempts by the Briceño to get their truck back.\n\nCecilia discovered that she was pregnant. Armando banished her from the family home for getting pregnant out of wedlock. She leaves with Peluche to inform Samuel of his impending fatherhood, only to find that he was getting married. Samuel, however, finds out about this, causing conflicts with his wife and Cecilia. Rigoberto falls in love with Amalfi, the wife of rival trucker Octavio, and both start singing as a duet in secrecy. Breiner, an internet celebrity, tries to conceal his real life circumstance from a rich girl that likes him. Darío engages in several open relations, with Pilar falling in love with him anyway and getting jealous of the others. She gets pregnant and then hates him because he was with someone else when she had a miscarriage. Armando gets his hand damaged by age-related injuries, but ignores the doctor's orders to avoid driving.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nKatherine Escobar Farfán as La Chiquis AK cecilia\n\nJuan Manuel Restrepo as Fabián Molano \"Peluche\"\n\nMario Espitia as Samuel\n\nCésar Mora as Don Armando\n\nCarmenza González as Lucía\n\nJosé Daniel Cristancho as Toronja\n\nMayra Luna Uribe as Ilse\n\nMaría Laura Quintero as Tatiana Gerlein\n\nToto Vega as Don Tulio\n\nCamilo Amores as Breiner\n\nLinda Lucía Callejas as Doña Amalfi\n\nMelissa Bermúdez Soler as Majo\n\nTania Fálquez as Neiva\n\nSantiago Rodríguez as Don Carlos\n\nLorna Cepeda as Minerva"
