        "text": "This is the first exhibition to feature Krimes’s two major installations, Purgatory (2009) and Apokaluptein:16389067 (2010–13), and they will be presented in dialogue with 19th-century photographs by the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon\n\nExhibition Dates: October 28, 2024–July 13, 2025\n\nExhibition Location: The Met Fifth Avenue, Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography, Gallery 851\n\nNew York, NY (August 7, 2024) — This October, The Metropolitan Museum of Art will open the exhibition Jesse Krimes: Corrections that will explore the critical role photography has played in structuring systems of power in society, policing, prosecution, incarceration, and identification from the singular perspective of artist Jesse Krimes (American, born 1982). The exhibition will present three major immersive contemporary installations by Krimes alongside 19th-century photographs from The Met collection by the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon, who developed the first modern system to target and identify people charged with crimes before the adoption of fingerprinting. A precursor of mug shots, this system was developed to combat rising rates of recidivism in 19th-century Paris by linking an alleged suspect’s anthropomorphic measurements with an identifying photograph. This exhibition marks the first time that Krimes’s two installations, Purgatory (2009) and Apokaluptein:16389067 (2010-13), created while serving a six-year prison sentence, will be shown together in their full iterations. Purgatory was acquired by the Museum in 2024. Jesse Krimes: Corrections will be on view October 28, 2024, through July 13, 2025.\n\nThe exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel.\n\n“This exhibition offers an important view into some of the complex histories that surround the powers and perceptions of incarceration,” said Max Hollein, The Met’s Marina Kellen French Director and Chief Executive Officer. “The presentation of Krimes’s remarkable reflections of his own lived experiences alongside Bertillon’s stark prints will surely serve as a catalyst for conversations about the significance of identity and the enduring impact of imagery.”\n\nShown alongside nearly 150 cartes de visite of suspected anarchists by Bertillon, Krimes’s monumental image-based installations present an opportunity to reconsider the perceived neutrality of our systems of identification and the hierarchies of social imbalance they create and reinscribe. The pairing underlines how Bertillon’s system contributed to the problematic ways in which these images dehumanize their subjects.\n\nLisa Sutcliffe, Curator in the Department of Photographs at The Met, said, “It is vital for collections that include photographs from the history of policing and criminology to consider perspectives from justice-involved individuals. In this exhibition, Krimes interrogates how the circulation of photographs in the media build on and reinforce structural hierarchies. Examining his work in dialogue with the system produced by Bertillon provides an opportunity to correct prejudices and biases in how we read photographs depending on the contexts in which they are presented.”\n\nKrimes’s Purgatory and Apokaluptein:16389067 reflect the ingenuity of an artist working in a federal penitentiary without access to traditional materials. Purgatory transforms nearly 300 prison-issued soaps, playing cards, and newspapers into a work of art that seeks to disrupt and recontextualize the circulation of photographs in the media. Using a hand printing technique invented over the course of a year in solitary confinement, Krimes transferred faces of “offenders” from newspapers onto the surface of the wet soap. These portraits were placed into a hole cut into a deck of playing cards, replacing the faces of kings, queens, and jacks to critique and comment on the social and circumstantial influences of society and our ability to play the hands we are each dealt."
