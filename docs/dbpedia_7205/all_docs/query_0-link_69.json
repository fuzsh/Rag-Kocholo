        "text": "Director Alfred E Green, 1933, USA\n\n71 min, 35mm, B&W, unclassified 15+\n\nBarbara Stanwyck, Theresa Harris\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nPromoted with the tagline âShe had it and made it payâ, Baby Face is a risquÃ© landmark of pre-Code Hollywood. We first meet our protagonist, whip-smart Lily Powers (Stanwyck), waitressing in a speakeasy. One night, a Nietzsche-reading barfly encourages her to âuse men to get the things you wantâ. Moving to Manhattan, Lilyâs rise through the corporate ranks and into a millionaireâs penthouse is swift. With a giddying performance by Stanwyck (whose face practically lights up as she switches to steely seductress), the story was conceived by Warner Brothers as a feminine equivalent to the gangster film. Its brazen depiction of cunning sexuality and the corruption of corporate America shocked censors, who demanded extensive cuts, and used the film as a reason to hasten the introduction of the Motion Picture Production Code (or Hays Code). Pulled from distribution, Baby Face was largely unseen until 2004, when an original version was discovered. It screens in a restored, uncensored 35mm print courtesy of the Library of Congress.\n\nSunday 18 August, 2pm session will be introduced by Tilly Lawless\n\nTilly Lawless is a queer, Sydney-based sex worker, writer and sometimes performer. Her debut novel Nothing but my body was published by Allen & Unwin in 2021 and her second novel Thora was published by Worms in 2024.\n\nDirector Edward Dmytryk, 1962, USA\n\n114 min, digital, B&W, unclassified 15+\n\nJane Fonda, Capucine, Laurence Harvey, Barbara Stanwyck, Anne Baxter\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nStanwyck, Fonda, Baxter: three generations of Hollywood grand dames unite in this steamy Southern Gothic melodrama. Hallie (Capucine) is the main attraction for clients at the Doll House, a New Orleans bordello run by ruthless madam Jo Courtney (Stanwyck, in one of Hollywoodâs first major lesbian characters). Her life is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of an ex-flame and his free-spirited travelling companion, Kitty Twist (Fonda). On the filmâs release, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called it âlurid, tawdry and sleazyâ, criticisms which have subsequently been reclaimed to celebrate the filmâs high-camp theatrics. Pay close attention to the opening and closing title sequences created by legendary designer Saul Bass: a sultry black cat, reminiscent of the filmâs leading women, stalks through back alleys and down water pipes, slipping through the cracks.\n\nDirector Alan J Pakula, 1971, USA\n\n114 min, 16mm, colour, rated R18+\n\nJane Fonda, Donald Sutherland\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nKlute is one of the great New York City films of the seventies. Itâs also a leap forward for Hollywood in its dignified depiction of sex work. This neo-noir thriller follows Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda in the role that won her an Oscar), a high-priced call girl who is being stalked by a serial killer, with detective Klute (Sutherland) hot on his heels. As the title suggests, Klute was originally intended to centre the investigator, but director Alan J Pakula (All the presidentâs men) found himself concentrating on Breeâs inner world. This is Fondaâs film. To prepare for the role, she spent a week with some of New Yorkâs most expensive escorts and madams, accompanying them to after-hour clubs in search of clients. The depth of her commanding performance remains âa benchmark for psychological realism in American screen actingâ â critic Mark Harris, Criterion.\n\nDirector Kinuyo Tanaka, 1961, Japan\n\n93 min, 35mm, B&W, unclassified 15+\n\nAkemi Kita, Chisako Hara, Chieko Nakakita\n\nJapanese with English subtitles\n\nKinuyo Tanaka was one of the most celebrated actors of golden age Japanese cinema. She was also a filmmaker, directing six features between 1953 and 1962. Having herself played the role of a sex worker in movies by YasujirÅ Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, Tanaka crafts an empathetic story of lives on the margins. Shot in wide-screen TohoScope in inky black and white, Girls of the night is a bracing portrait of âfallen womenâ living in correctional facilities for rehabilitation. Kuniko (an excellent Chisako Hara) drifts from job to job, seeking to overcome the stigma of her past. Released just three years after Japan criminalised sex work, Tanaka explores the conflict and camaraderie of women navigating the hypocrisies of patriarchal social mores. 35mm print courtesy of Japan Foundation, Tokyo.\n\nDirector Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1981, West Germany\n\n113 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, rated M\n\nBarbara Sukowa, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Mario Adorf, Udo Kier\n\nGerman with English subtitles\n\nFassbinder reimagines the erotic decadence of Weimar classic The blue angel (directed by Josef Sternberg in 1930, with Marlene Dietrich) as a Technicolor melodrama set in small-town West Germany. The year is 1957. Lola (Sukowa) moonlights at a bordello owned by Schuckert (Adorf), a crooked developer seeking to benefit from the countryâs reconstruction boom. When building commissioner von Bohm (Mueller-Stahl) comes to town, he begins collecting evidence to expose Schuckert but quickly falls for Lola and is thrown off course. âLove,â in the words of the filmâs director, âis the best, most insidious, most effective instrument of social repression.â Showcasing Fassbinderâs gimlet eye for satire and lavish kitsch, Lola examines the extravagant corruption behind Germanyâs post-war âeconomic miracleâ. âThe years from 1956 to 1960 were more or less the most amoral period that Germany ever experiencedâ - Fassbinder.\n\nPreceded by: Â\n\nRemoved\n\nDirector Naomi Uman, 1999, USA\n\n7 mins, 16mm-to-digital, colour, unclassified 18+\n\nStarting with a piece of vintage porn, filmmaker Naomi Uman painstakingly removed each female figure from the footage using nail polish remover, leaving a striking absence where thereâs usually fleshy presence.Â\n\nDirector Lino Brocka, 1988, Philippines\n\n136 min, digital, colour, unclassified 18+\n\nDaniel Fernando, Allan Paule, Jaclyn Jose\n\nFilipino with English subtitles\n\nThis slippery suds-and-bubbles melodrama is one of the most influential gay films from the Philippines. Eighteen-year-old Pol leaves his rural hometown and finds work in Manilaâs red-light district as a âmacho dancerâ, an erotic performer in a nightclub. The film dazzles in fantasy sequences where Pol and his comrades gyrate and striptease to power ballads. But beyond these splashy scenes lies an unflinching portrayal of coming-of-age amid endemic poverty, police corruption and government abuses. The filmâs political and sexual content led censors to order extensive cuts, yet director Lino Brocka managed to smuggle an uncensored print out of the country. Macho dancer has since found acclaim as a landmark of queer Southeast Asian cinema.\n\nPreceded by:\n\nHow you like my cutÂ\n\nDirector Peaches, 2015, Canada/Philippines\n\n4 min, digital, colour, unclassified 15+\n\nChoreography and performance by Eisa Jocson\n\nIn this music video by iconic electroclash musician Peaches, Filipinx artist and dancer Eisa Jocson learns and performs a macho dance, an erotic routine expressive of masculinity traditionally performed by young men.\n\nDirector Shirley Clarke, 1967, USA\n\n105 min, 35mm-to-digital, B&W, unclassified 18+\n\nJason Holliday\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nOn a winter night in 1966, director Shirley Clarke and a tiny crew convened in her New York apartment at the Hotel Chelsea to make a film. There, for 12 straight hours, they filmed gay African American man Jason Holliday as he improvised tales of his life as a hustler, sometimes houseboy and aspiring cabaret performer in the heat of the civil rights movement and before the Stonewall uprising in 1969. The film was shot in a cinema veritÃ© style, but as the night unfolds (and Holliday grows exceedingly drunk), our grip on the truth starts to slip, with the camera shifting in and out of focus. A complex, often-times uncomfortable reflection on the relationship between documentarians and their subjects, Portrait of Jason might be the ultimate film about hustling and being hustled. Or, in Hollidayâs words: âIt gets to be a joke sometimes as to whoâs using who.â\n\nDirectors Bruce LaBruce and Rick Castro, 1996, USA\n\n79 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, rated R18+\n\nTony Ward, Bruce LaBruce, Rick Castro\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nContent warning: contains unsimulated masturbation and real sex, some scenes of fetishistic sexual activities, including portrayals of bondage and sadomasochism.\n\nDirector Bruce LaBruce teamed up with famed fetish photographer Rick Castro for this cult homage to Hollywoodâs golden age. It begins with a nod to Sunset Boulevard (1950), with hustler Monti (Ward) lying face down in a jacuzzi. Shortly after, weâre introduced to an eccentric anthropologist (LaBruce), who is researching an exposÃ© on male sex workers. So begins an odyssey through the gay scene of Los Angeles, from the sidewalks of Santa Monica Boulevard to hotel rooms where all manner of sex-for-hire stereotypes and scenarios play out. Whatâs the difference between art and pornography? The lighting, claimed LaBruce, in the filmâs tagline. While its graphic content will not appeal to all audiences, Hustler White remains a key work of 1990s queer cinema in the tradition of Jean Genet, Derek Jarman and Kenneth Anger.\n\nScreens with a pre-recorded introduction by LaBruce and series curator EO Gill (the Art Galleryâs assistant curator of film).\n\nDirector Antonio GimÃ©nez-Rico, 1983, Spain\n\n90 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, unclassified 18+\n\nEva PÃ©rez Cobos, Nacha MarÃ­a SÃ¡nchez, Loren Arana Orellano, Josette Ruiz OrejÃ³n, ReneÃ© Amor, Tamara MuÃ±oz Santiago\n\nSpanish with English subtitles\n\nContent warning: contains graphic footage of gender-affirming surgery.\n\nIn this remarkable docufiction set in 1980s Madrid, six transgender women candidly discuss their personal experiences working in the sex industry during Spainâs transition to democracy. Ingeniously framed around a ladyâs luncheon, the camera style is quiet and curious, allowing its subjects â Eva, Nacha, Loren, Josette, ReneÃ© and Tamara â to speak for themselves. Their commentary on class dynamics, gender roles and religion before and after the fall of Franco is delivered with sass and fast-paced wit. Hailed as âone of the best trans films youâve likely never heard ofâ, Dressed in blue âbroke the ice on a culturally taboo topic that would later make possible the films of Pedro AlmodÃ³var and other Spanish directors.â â The Hollywood Times. Screens in a new 2K restoration.\n\nPreceded by:Â\n\nValerie\n\nJoseph Horning, 1975, USA\n\n15 min, 16mm-to-digital, B&W, unclassified 18+\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nA stunning veritÃ© portrait of Valerie, a Black transgender sex worker living as a housewife in Ohio in the Midwest of the 1970s, during a period when âcross-dressingâ was still illegal and punishable with prison time.\n\nDirector Chantal Ackerman, 1975, Belgium/France\n\n201 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, rated M\n\nDelphine Seyrig, Jan Decorte\n\nFrench with English subtitles\n\nIn 2022, for the first time in 70 years, the British Film Instituteâs Sight and Sound poll was topped by a film directed by a woman. Whatâs more, it was a film exploring sex and care work. Chantal Ackermanâs Jeanne Dielman brilliantly evokes the daily domestic routine of a middle-aged widow (Seyrig) over the course of three days. Jeanneâs chores include making the beds, cooking dinner for her grown son, and turning the occasional trick. At first her activities are rigid and precise, though slowly Jeanne begins to falter, wandering aimlessly between activities and different rooms. Whether seen as an exacting character study or one of cinemaâs most hypnotic and complete depictions of time and space, Jeanne Dielman is an astonishing film experiment.\n\nDirector Juliet Bashore, 1986, USA\n\n87 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, rated R18+\n\nTigr, Sharon Mitchell\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nContent warning: contains unsimulated drug use and unsimulated sex.\n\nBy turns mesmerising and unsettling, Kamikaze hearts is both a fascinating record of pre-gentrification San Franciscoâs X-rated underground and an intense love story. It might first appear as a documentary exposÃ© about the adult entertainment industry and the experiences of its performers. But due to constraints while filming, and participants who didnât want to be incriminated by the United Statesâ strict laws on pornography, director Juliet Bashore got creative. The film interweaves the relationship of real-life lovers Sharon âMitchâ Mitchell and Tigr with fly-on-the-wall footage of a porn shoot â though not a real one, as it was staged for the film without telling most of the cast. Originally titled Fact or fiction, Kamikaze hearts dropped out of mainstream distribution, circulating via bootleg discs and torrents for decades. A recent 2K restoration has ensured the filmâs longevity as a time-capsule portrait of 1980s punk rock, polysexuality and porn.\n\nDirector Paul Verhoeven, 1995, USA\n\n131 min, 35mm, colour, rated R18+\n\nElizabeth Berkley, Gina Gershon, Kyle MacLachlan\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nFamously touted as the worst film of all time, Showgirls stars Elizabeth Berkley as Nomi Malone, a young stripper yearning for stardom. After hitchhiking to Las Vegas, she meets an established entertainer (Gershon), who mentors the plucky ingÃ©nue but later sabotages her career prospects. Nomi retaliates, nails out. The critical flogging that Showgirls has received since its release is part of its mystique. Berkleyâs earnest performance was initially subject to sexist and classist dismissal. From cat-crawling pole routines to her infamous aqua-aerobic romp with Kyle MacLachlan, her performance has more recently been celebrated as radically feminist. âA tour de force of hysterical excess.â â Film at Lincoln Centre. Screens on 35mm.\n\nDirector Spike Lee, 1996, USA\n\n108 min, 35mm-to-digital, colour, unclassified 18+\n\nTheresa Randle, Spike Lee\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nBoasting cameos by Naomi Campbell and Madonna and a soundtrack by Prince, Girl 6 is a 1990s hotline fever dream. Spike Lee collaborated with acclaimed playwright Suzan-Lori Parks for this bubblegum tale of a struggling actor who takes a job as a phone-sex operator. She finds friendship and camaraderie with her fellow workers who guffaw and eye roll at the absurd, sometimes terrifying fantasies coming down the line. A playful, sharp examination of race, gender and performance through mediated forms of intimacy (the old-school hotline), the film was praised by author and scholar bell hooks as offering âthe most diverse images of Black female identity ever seen in a Hollywood film.â\n\nPreceded by:Â\n\nSalacia Â\n\nDirector Tourmaline, 2019, USA\n\n6 min, digital, colour, unclassified 15+\n\nRowin Amone\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\n\nSalacia follows the life of Mary Jones, a Black transgender sex worker who lived in New York in the 1800s and imagines her in Seneca Village (now Central Park), then one of the only areas in New York City where Black people owned land.
