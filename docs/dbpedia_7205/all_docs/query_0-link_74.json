        "text": "A/an and the with types of nouns\n\nCountable nouns\n\nWe only use a/an with singular countable nouns:\n\nI have a sister and a brother.\n\nThat was an excellent meal.\n\nWe can use the with singular and plural countable nouns:\n\nThe lion roared.\n\nThe tree fell.\n\nThe lions roared.\n\nThe trees fell.\n\nUncountable nouns\n\nWe don’t use a/an before uncountable nouns:\n\nCould I have rice instead of potatoes with my fish?\n\nNot: Could I have a rice\n\nI hope we have nice weather.\n\nNot: I hope we have a nice weather.\n\nWe can use the before uncountable nouns when they refer to a specific example:\n\nThe rice we bought in the Thai shop is much better than the supermarket rice.\n\nThe weather was awful last summer.\n\nTo talk about an individual quantity or more than one quantity of an uncountable noun, we use expressions such as a bit of, a piece of or a [specific measure] of:\n\nThat’s an amazing bit of news.\n\nNot: That’s an amazing news.\n\nWe just made a big bowl of pasta.\n\nNot: We just made a pasta.\n\nCould I have a litre of milk, please?\n\nNot: Could I have a milk, please?\n\nThe with dates\n\nWhen we say a specific date, we use the, but when we write it, we don’t use the:\n\nSpeaking: ‘I’ll see you on the twenty fourth of May.’\n\nWriting: I’ll see you on 24th May.\n\nWhen we talk about months, we don’t use the:\n\nMy birthday is in September.\n\nMay is my favourite month of all.\n\nWhen we talk about seasons in general, we can use either in or in the. In without the is often used in more formal or literary contexts:\n\nThese birds arrive in Britain in summer, and leave as the winter begins.\n\nIn the summer, we usually go to the mountains.\n\nWe rarely get snow in the winter.\n\nWhen we talk about a specific season, we use the:\n\nThe winter of 1947 was one of the coldest in Britain.\n\nWe’ll definitely visit you in the summer. (meaning next summer)\n\nSee also:\n\nNouns\n\nThe with go to, be at, be in hospital, school, prison\n\nWhen we talk about the activity that happens in a building rather than about the building itself, we don’t use the.\n\nCompare\n\nwithout the\n\nwith the\n\nWe don’t use the with bed when we go there to sleep:\n\nI always go to bed at eleven o’clock.\n\nNot: I always go to the bed …\n\nWe don’t use the before work when we talk about the place where we do our job:\n\nThey go to work at 8 am every morning.\n\nNot: They go to the work …\n\nThis, that and articles\n\nWe can use this instead of a/an or the, and these instead of zero article or some when we tell stories and jokes to create a sense of the present:\n\n[beginning of a joke]\n\nThere was this chicken who wanted to cross the road … (compare There was a chicken who wanted to cross the road …)\n\nThese tourists came into the restaurant once and they ordered fifteen Irish coffees. (compare Some tourists came into the restaurant once and they ordered …)\n\nSpoken English:\n\nIn informal speaking, we can use that as an alternative to the in stories when we refer to something familiar or known to the listener. That highlights the fact that the thing being referred to is known to the speaker and listener:\n\nA:\n\nWhere did you buy your skirt? I really like it.\n\nB:\n\nI got it at that new shop next to Green’s Hotel. (compare I got it at the new shop next to Green’s Hotel.)"
