        "text": "Why don't the kids watch the Hope movies anymore?\n\nBob Hope was one of the most popular comedians for an entire lifetime, and now... ROAD TO MOROCCO is probably the only one most people could mention off-hand.\n\nSome jokes made me chuckle, the sets are big and lavish, and Director David Butler keeps things moving, but this is the definition of a slightly amusing comedy that someone older than forces you to watch because they loved it when they were a kid.\n\nNow, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO, THE THREE STOOGES, LAUREL AND HARDY, THE MARX BROTHERS, those boys still hold up.\n\nAnyway, Bing Crosby is such a jerk in this.
