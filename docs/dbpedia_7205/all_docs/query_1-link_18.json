        "text": "Tickets\n\n$ 17\n\nGeneral Public\n\n$ 14\n\nStudents, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities\n\n$ 12\n\nMembers\n\nFilm at Lincoln Center presents a selection of films handpicked by Lulu Wang that influenced her new Prime Video series, Expats, featuring the filmmaker in-person on February 15th for a Q&A following the feature-length Expats episode “Central,” and an introduction to her 2019 hit The Farewell.\n\nThe series includes a wide range of influences, from 1970s classics to harrowing horror films to documentaries and narrative features tackling the intersection of class, race, and abuse of power, with several selections presented on 35mm. Highlights include well-known filmmakers’ works, such as Triangle of Sadness writer-director Ruben Östlund’s 2011 film Play; the overdue New York theatrical premiere of A White, White Day (2019) from filmmaker Hlynur Pálmason (recently shortlisted for an Oscar with his latest film Godland); and classics including a 4K restoration of Robert Altman’s Nashville (1975) and Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now(1973), which will be presented on an archival 35mm print on Valentine’s Day along with 35mm presentations of Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011) and Bong Joon Ho’s Mother (2009) for the ultimate relationship horror trifecta.\n\nOrganized by Florence Almozini, Tyler Wilson, and Lulu Wang.\n\nJump to:\n\nExpats Ep. 5: “Central”\n\nQ&A with Lulu Wang\n\nLulu Wang casts her penetrating gaze on the intersection of race and class in Hong Kong’s milieu of expats, and the migrant domestic workers employed by them, in this vivid adaptation of Janice Y. K. Lee’s widely acclaimed novel, The Expatriates (1998).\n\nThe Farewell\n\nIntroduction by Lulu Wang\n\nAwkwafina turns in a staggering lead performance as the Chinese-born, U.S.-raised Billi, who reluctantly goes from New York to Changchun to find that, although her entire family knows their beloved matriarch Nai Nai has been given a few weeks to live, everyone has decided not to tell her.\n\nThe Helper\n\nU.S. Theatrical Premiere · Introduction by Lulu Wang and Joanna Bowers\n\nIn Joanna Bowers’s debut documentary, the reality of the migrant domestic worker industry is plumbed with heartfelt intuition, shedding light on the thousands of women who, each year, travel from around Southeast Asia to seek employment as live-in caretakers for Hong Kong’s wealthiest families.\n\nDon’t Look Now\n\nPresented on 35mm · Buy one ticket, get one free for Valentine's Day!\n\nArguably one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century, Nicolas Roeg’s contemporary Gothic features a married couple who relocate to a wintry, off-season Venice—where a serial killer menaces its emptied-out canals and alleys—some time after their young daughter drowns in an accident at their English country home.\n\nJoshua: Teenager vs. Superpower\n\nJoe Piscatella’s Sundance Audience Award–winning documentary chronicles Hong Kong activist-politician Joshua Wong—just 14 years old and taking to task the Chinese government’s pro-Communist education program in Hong Kong.\n\nMother\n\nPresented on 35mm · Buy one ticket, get one free for Valentine's Day!\n\nBong Joon Ho returns to small-town intrigue with this searing melodrama that also functions as a female-fronted whodunit featuring a career-best performance by veteran actress Kim Hye-ja. An NYFF47 selection.\n\nMy Love, Don’t Cross That River\n\nBuy one ticket, get one free for Valentine's Day!\n\nDirector Jin Moyoung’s documentary portrait of the 76-year companionship of “100-year-old lovebirds” became an unexpected blockbuster in South Korea and remains one of the country’s most successful films.\n\nNashville\n\n4K Restoration\n\nRobert Altman’s monumental, kaleidoscopic musical pushed the limits of collective filmmaking to render not just a portrait of a city but a radically prophetic panorama of 1970s America’s grandiose contradictions, incidental resonances, and culture-shifting tragedies.\n\nPlay\n\nRuben Östlund's unabashedly impolite feature is a controversial record, inspired by actual court cases, of five Black teenagers harassing white and Asian youths through scams and role-playing. An NYFF49 selection.\n\nTwilight’s Kiss\n\nQ&A with Ray Yeung and Tai Bo\n\nRay Yeung’s gut-wrenching tale of forbidden love between two married men in their golden years shines a light on the isolation and heartache faced by those who dare to love outside the lines, delivering a powerful and unforgettable portrait of a love that refuses to be denied.\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nPresented on 35mm · Buy one ticket, get one free for Valentine's Day!\n\nWith a deft deployment of tropes that call to mind the great lineage of “bad seed” horror, Lynne Ramsay marked the end of a near-decade-long hiatus with this adaptation of Lionel Shriver’s 2003 novel, which follows the before-and-after life of a mother whose teenage son carries out a school massacre.\n\nA White, White Day\n\nNew York Theatrical Premiere\n\nWhat begins as a richly textured portrait of loss gradually descends, with dreamlike pacing, into something more offbeat and shocking in Hlynur Pálmason’s follow-up to his award-winning debut Winter Brothers (ND/NF 2018).\n\nTickets are now on sale! $17 for the General Public; $14 for Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities; and $12 for FLC Members.\n\nSee more and save with a 3+ Film Package. $15 for the General Public; $12 for Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities; and $10 for FLC Members.
