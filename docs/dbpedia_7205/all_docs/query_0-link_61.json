        "text": "This course is for people who love film. It encourages you to watch, analyse, discuss and write about films from different perspectives. Film Studies is about how we engage with films on a textual level, its form and aesthetics, how it produces meaning and how it articulates our world to us. This is underpinned by making films, as this is how you truly learn to ‘see’ films. The course works to the OCR A level film specification and is a two year linear course.\n\nThis course is perfect for those who are open to studying a wide range of different types of films from blockbusters, indie, foreign language films and experimental cinema. In film history, we trace cinema from US and European silent cinema to the studio system through to New Hollywood. This is alongside European Film movements such as German\n\nExpressionism and Surrealism. In critical approaches to film, you will look at debates around the nature of cinema. Underpinning this is the practice of film production - you will\n\nshoot and edit short tasks throughout the year to experiment with cinema forms, alongside workshops on creative writing, cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. All students produce either a short film or a screenplay (with photographed storyboard)."
