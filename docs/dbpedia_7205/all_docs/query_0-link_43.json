The movie tells the true story of Manoj Kumar Sharma, an IPS officer from Chambal, a small town in India, who bravely started the preparation for the UPSC exams, one of the country's most difficult exams.\n\nHe failed, got back up, and then failed again. Upon experiencing every setback, he would analyse the pattern of his shortcomings and take steps to improve upon it.\n\nManoj elevated his concentration on the objective by viewing every criticism as a challenge. No matter how harsh the criticism or consequences, if you truly have a clear purpose or goal in life, you will follow the route to success."
