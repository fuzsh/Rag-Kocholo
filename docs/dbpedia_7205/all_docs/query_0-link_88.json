        "text": "Gui Xiao and Lu Yan Chen met at school – in a middle school playground. They fell in love with one another at first sight. And as they grew older, their feelings for one another grew ever stronger. They became inseparable and hoped to spend the rest of their lives together. But life has other plans for them. Gui Xiao’s family circumstances change. And Lu Yan Chen ends up training as a special police officer – which takes him to a completely different part of the country. Lu Yan Chen’s training is tough, physical, and intense. Gui Xiao, meanwhile, ends up on a career path that will take her into the world of finance. Despite the fact that they now live in different worlds, their love is still strong – and they try to keep up a long-distance relationship. This peters out – until one day, years later, Gui Xiao finds herself with a special reason to call Lu Yan Chen once more.
