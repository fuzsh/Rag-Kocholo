        "text": "Two Lane Blacktop\n\nJames Taylor (yes that one) and Dennis Wilson (from the Beach Boys) and a tricked out sleeper of a 55 Chevy. Put them together and you have the coolest road movie ever.\n\nNational Lampoon’s European Vacation\n\nChevy Chase and family cross the Old Continent as the perfect approximation of the American güber. A classic of comedic errors.\n\nDuel\n\nSpielberg’s first feature and a terrifying ode to sustained road rage.\n\nThelma and Louise\n\nIn the top ten because girls love it. And so do we.\n\nEasy Rider\n\nDefinitive Americana with Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine\n\nSweet, succinct and features a killer VW camper. What’s not to like?\n\nMotorcycle Diaries\n\nThe reason Che Guevara is an icoc of revoution is because he knew how to live a true road trip.\n\nMad Max\n\nClassic Aussie apocalyptica before Mel Gibson went weird.\n\nSideways\n\nTwo men of a certain age get on the road to taste fine wine and have menopausal misadventures. The Saab 900 convertible reflects the washed-up nature of the main characters. Elegant and touching.\n\nVanishing Point\n\nExtreme GTO-pedalling in the mode of the sexually promiscious seventies.\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\nDepp as Hunter S Thompson into the Dantean inferno of Vegas. On Acid.\n\nFeel free to tell us your additions to the list…"
