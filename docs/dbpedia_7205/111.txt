The “on the road” theme has such staying power, in part, because there is a shared ethic at work in these stories. Some people would argue it’s a God-breathed and essential ethic—that each of these stories reflects a fundamental desire for spiritual improvement or progress toward sanctification or, more simply, a moment of epiphany or grace. Produced in 2012 by the Arts & Faith online community, this list spans 80 years of cinema, from 1939’s The Wizard of Oz to 2009’s Up.

The Top 25 Road Films is sponsored by Image, a literary and arts quarterly founded in 1989 to demonstrate the vitality and diversity of well-made art and writing that engage seriously with the historic faiths of the West in our time. Now one of the leading literary magazines published in the English language, it is read all over the world—and it forms the nexus of a warm and lively community. Explore Image here.
