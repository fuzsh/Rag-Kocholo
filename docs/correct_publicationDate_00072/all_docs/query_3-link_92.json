        "text": "Kilgore Trout may be the most interesting character I’ve ever read about. He is a character in Slaughterhouse Five, and he has a very interesting role in the story. He is a science fiction author who wrote several ironic novels that have a huge influence on Billy and his life. He is under-appreciated and not a very good person, either. He’s unpopular, as only Billy and a fellow war veteran named Eliot Rosewater are the only two people who have ever heard of him.\n\nHe influenced Billy’s life quite a bit because his science fiction tales are very similar to the way Billy saw (or thinks he saw) Tralfamadore. But that’s not what I find most curious about the character. What I find most curious about him is that he has not only appeared in Slaughterhouse Five, but he has also appears in Kurt Vonnegut’s other work. I find this very interesting and Kurt Vonnegut seems like he was a very innovative author with his stories, hence the out of order storytelling, and himself appearing in the story. Kilgore is actually just one of Vonnegut’s gimmicks.\n\nKilgore Trout functions as Kurt Vonnegut’s alter-ego in his stories. But I am very impressed with the unique way Vonnegut has written this story, and some of his other stories as well, and I greatly respect that in an author, as strange as it can be. Kilgore Trout proves to be both an interesting character to read about, and a product of innovative writing style. Kilgore lives in the same hometown as Billy, and they have both met before. He has written stories that are strangely similar to Billy’s beliefs brought back from the Tralfamadorians, such as the fourth dimension, a man and woman being brought from Earth and put into an alien zoo, and he even wrote about an alien that oddly looks like a Tralfamadorian.\n\nThe oddest part is, he didn’t steal any of these ideas from Billy. He just made them up! So in conclusion, I think that the character Kilgore Trout is both interesting and innovative, and I would like to read more of Vonnegut’s work to find out more about this character.\n\nSources:\n\n“Kilgore Trout.” Shmoop.

Yahoo!, 13 July 2012. Web. 16 Dec. 2013.\n\nSo this is an analysis of the tralfamadorians. They do have an odd name, (at least I think so.) and they may seem rather odd, but their beliefs and culture are very interesting to me. In the novel, Slaughterhouse Five, Billy is whisked off of Earth and brought to a zoo on Tralfamadore to be examined by the Tralfamadorian populace. They may look and seem rather odd at first glance, but their philosophies are rather interesting to me. They are described as upside down green toilet plungers that are two feet tall, and their eyeballs are located in the palm of one hand, which comes out of the top of its body.\n\nI can understand why one would find them weird or strange. They have the ability to see in the fourth dimension, which means they can see through time. They prefer to look at the more positive sides of life, for example, when a person dies, they believe that the person is dead only at a particular time, and that person is still alive and well somewhere else in a different time. The tralfamadorians also believe in fate, which means that your life has one path, and your life will only end one way. The Tralfamadorians play a very large role in the story, as they are the explanation for the jumbled sequencing of the book’s events. (Being “unstuck in time”.)\n\nAs I said before, the Tralfamadorians captured Billy, and put him in a zoo on Tralfamadore. The zoo is described as a transparent geodesic dome. Not only that, but the Tralfamadorians also captured a Hollywood movie actress named Montana Wildhack so the Tralfamadorians could observe them mate. While Billy was there, the Tralfamadorians explained to Billy their way of life and their beliefs. They are responsible for Billy being “unstuck in time” and essentially, in a way, they tell the story for us, or at least help put it together.\n\nThey are very interesting characters and I personally really like them and the novel would not be what it is without their presence in the story. Actually, the story may not even be considered science fiction without them. They are vital to the story and I really enjoyed reading about them.\n\n“Plot Overview.” SparkNotes. SparkNotes, 30 Oct. 2013. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.\n\nThe link to the spark notes is right here. Just click it and it’ll send you right to it.\n\nThe conflict in Slaughterhouse Five can be confusing. I personally think that the conflict is man vs. self. Billy Pilgrim is reliving random moments in his life as he has trouble trying to understand the senseless murder and slaughter that World War II was known to be. He has witnessed it firsthand in the fire bombings of the German town of Dresden. The book mainly follows Billy throughout his life and him piecing together each part of his life, also while trying to understand the purpose of war. And the sickest part is, there really isn’t a purpose.\n\nThat’s why Billy has such a hard time overcoming it in the story. He’s dealt with so much destruction and pain in his life, (see my earlier post that analyzes Billy Pilgrim.) he may have trouble trying to figure out why all this conflict and destruction happened in the world due to his mind possibly being damaged by what he’s experienced in the past, which is what makes this conflict so interesting because you’re not sure what’s real and what’s not because Billy’s mind could possibly be disturbed or damaged in some way. The whole story could be made up! Kurt Vonnegut is a very talented storyteller in making his audience think about the book in different ways from different angles. Throughout the story Billy is continually thinking about making sense of war.\n\nBut this may not be the only conflict throughout the story. The main conflict is him struggling to making sense of why war happens but there are also other conflicts sprinkled into the plot such as Billy being captured by the Nazis, the death of Billy’s wife, Billy being captured by the tralfamadorians, and more. In conclusion, Billy has had a rough life. He really did. He was attacked, captured, witnessed one of the most chaotic tragedies in human history, and lost just about everyone and anyone he ever loved, all while trying to figure out the purpose of war.\n\nEssentially Billy is dedicating his life to figuring out a purpose that doesn’t really exist. It’s governments fighting with each other over sometimes silly things, like money or power over land, but there sometimes can be a purpose to war, such as a country attacking another country with no real reason for doing it. That’s how I see it. There are rare situations where a country will actually inflict damage and chaos and panic within another country with no real motivation, but there are other situations where countries attack other countries over money or power. It can be very silly sometimes and I think we should try to accomplish peace and never fall into a war again.\n\n“Slaughterhouse Five Plot.” Shmoop. Shmoop University, 2013. Web. 13 Nov. 2013.\n\nCommons.wikimedia.org. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Dec. 2013.\n\nIn ‘Slaughterhouse Five’, the main idea of the story is World War II, and it’s also a significant part of the setting. It is an antiwar book about the firebombings of the German town of Dresden. Kurt Vonnegut, the author of ‘Slaughterhouse Five’ was present at the Fire bombings, and the story was actually based off of the event. Kurt Vonnegut had tried for twenty years to write about the event, but was just incapable of doing it. Then he found a solution.\n\nHe used a different strategy to tell the story, with the setting playing a big part in it. He told the events in a random order. That is how Billy Pilgrim’s being “unstuck in time” came to be. The strategy is called shifting. A strategy used for dealing with the destruction and aggression that he witnessed was Vonnegut’s solution to the problem.\n\nIt took Vonnegut twenty years to write about the event. He just couldn’t find an efficient enough way to tell the story. I find it interesting in how some people have a very hard time coping with war and the trauma that follows. I don’t understand it because I’ve never been in a war, and I certainly have never been in World War II, which is arguably the most destructive war in human history. It can certainly damage many people and affect them even in their later lives, similar to Billy Pilgrim, who may have fallen into insanity because of the brutality of war.\n\nAnd I don’t blame him. War is a terrible thing. Kurt was at the bombings of Dresden because he was a POW (Prisoner of War) at the time. Like Billy Pilgrim, he was put in a Slaughterhouse. Slaughterhouse Five specifically.\n\nThey survived the bombings, but the residents of Dresden were not so lucky. The fires were so large, all of the oxygen in the city was consumed by the fires. No one escaped. It wasn’t as destructive as the bombings of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, but it was still destructive and devastating nonetheless. That is why I think Kurt Vonnegut chose to write his fictional tale in World War II.\n\nHis fictional tale could have taken place in any other time period, but I think he chose it because of personal experience. War is an excellent setting for a story because of its pure devastation and emotion.\n\nSparkNotes. SparkNotes, 2002. Web. 06 Nov. 2013.\n\n“Bombing of Dresden in World War II.” Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Dec. 2013. Web. 16 Dec. 2013.\n\nBilly Pilgrim was one of the most unlikely people to become an antiwar hero. He was weak and unpopular even before the war. In ‘Slaughterhouse Five’, Kurt Vonnegut inserts himself into certain points in the story, which I really liked. I thought it was interesting how When Billy became a soldier, all of the other soldiers hated him, and he was abruptly put into duty without training or preparation at all. Billy lived a life full of indignity and dishonor.\n\nBilly’s mind has been disturbed by war and the heavy amount of loss he’s had to deal with in his life. He believes that he has been captured by a strange alien species known as the Tralfamadorians, but they could very easily just have been made up by his mind so he could cope with seeing all of the death and destruction that happened in World War II. I find the story fascinating in how it describes the events the way Billy sees it. Billy has dealt with a lot of death and loss in his life, his father died in a hunting accident right before he entered the war, several thousand people died during the fire-bombing of Dresden, his wife died from accidental carbon-monoxide poisoning, and more. Because of his visit to the Tralfamadorians, Billy claims has the ability to see into the 4th dimension, which allows you to see time.\n\nIn ‘Slaughterhouse Five’ Billy becomes “Unstuck in time” which basically means that he travelled to random points in his life, and he had no control of when and where he would end up in his life. He was able to predict the exact time of when, how, and where he would die, and he didn’t do anything to stop it. He accepted it. This is either because of his undignified life, or because of the Tralfamadorian philosophy of accepting death.\n\nKurt Vonnegut described the Tralfamadorians as aliens shaped like an upside-down toilet plunger, and are green-colored. Each one has a hand with an eye in it. These creatures could have been real or a figment of Billy’s disturbed mind. I personally think that the Tralfamadorians are real because the story is told out of order because of Billy being “Unstuck in time”. Kurt Vonnegut used a writing style that both interested me and kept me reading. The story is told out of order, as Billy lives his life in random points, which explains the “Unstuck in time” Part. I liked the character of Billy, and I thought he was very well-written by Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nSources:\n\n“Slaughterhouse Five Character List.” SparkNotes. SparkNotes, 2013. Web. 30 Oct. 2013."
