        "text": "Analysis Of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five\n\n1981 Words | 4 Pages\n\nhas to face is post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is “an anxiety disorder that can occur after someone experiences a traumatic event that caused intense fear, helplessness, or horror. PTSD can result from personally experienced traumas (e.g., rape, war, natural disasters, abuse, serious accidents, and captivity) or from the witnessing or learning of a violent or tragic event.” Otherwise meaning something happened in your past keeps triggering and haunting you in present day and experiences that could put you into a mental shock. Even though Billy Pilgrim is no longer involved with the war, he still is involved with the war. (National Alliance on Mental Illness) Billy Pilgrim had to face many different types of traumatic events. In the Slaughterhouse-Five the book mention Maniacs in the Fourth Dimension by Kilgore Trout stated “It was about people whose mental diseases couldn’t be treated because the causes of the diseases were all in the fourth dimension, and three-dimensional Earthling doctors couldn’t see those causes at all, or even imagine them (Slaughterhouse-Five 104).” Saying that the Earth doctors wouldn’t know what they were dealing with. If someone would tell they would think the person who did was bizarre. But Billy Pilgrim didn’t realize that he read the book before when he was at a veteran hospital. When Billy Pilgrim was a prisoner of war he remembers that\n\nFutile Search for Answers in Slaughterhouse Five\n\n834 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe main event that leads Billy to all his confusion is the time he spent in Dresden and witnessed the fire-bombings that constantly pop in his head along with pictures of all the innocent people Billy saw that fled to Dresden the \"safe spot\" from the war before the bombing. When Billy sees the faces of the innocent children it represents his fear of the situation. Billy can't acknowledge the fact that they were innocent and they were killed by Americans, Americans soldiers just like himself. The biggest issue Billy cannot come to grasp with is why the bombings took place. That question has no answer; it's just something that happened that Billy couldn't get over. During all Billy's travels back to Dresden he couldn't change what had really happened there although that was the closure he was looking for. Dresden purely represents Bill's past and fears of the truth about what happened.\n\nWar and Heroism in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five\n\n780 Words | 2 Pages\n\nSlaughterhouse Five is not a book that should be glanced over and discarded away like a dirty rag. Slaughterhouse Five is a book that should be carefully analyzed and be seen as an inspiration to further improve the well-being of mankind. Vonnegut makes it clear that an easy way to improve mankind is to see war not as a place where legends are born, but rather, an event to be avoided. Intelligent readers and critics alike should recognize Vonnegut’s work and see to it that they make an effort to understand the complexities behind the human condition that lead us to war.\n\nTwo Sides of Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five\n\n411 Words | 1 Pages\n\nDenial is also crucial to Billy Pilgrim's character. The Dresden bombing intensifies the damage to his personality. He can survive only by denying his experiences at Dresden and he divides himself into two halves: a social half that says, \"Yes,\" and a private half that says, \"No.\" His conflicts force his \"surrender to the world,\" first with a mental breakdown, then with an escape into fantasy. Publicly, he agrees with the Marine major who wants more bombing, more Green Berets, while internally, he sees a war-film backwards, in which he wishes to undo the ravaging effects of war. Looking for an outlet, Billy discovers science fiction, which gives him perspective and consolation. This perspective forces him to teach others, to improve not people's physical sight but their spiritual vision, which eventually leads to his commitment.\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder In Slaughterhouse Five\n\n1035 Words | 3 Pages\n\nSlaughterhouse Five and the Impact of War on the Individual War effects people in multiple ways, some worse than others. “Studies suggest that between twenty and thirty percent of returning veterans suffer, to varying degrees, from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, a mental-health condition triggered by some type of terror, or a traumatic brain injury, which occurs when the brain is jolted so violently that it collides with the inside of the skull, causing psychological damage (Finkel 36).” Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the most common form of affect on an individual involved in warfare, whether it is the victim or the perpetrator. In Slaughterhouse Five, written by Kurt Vonnegut, Billy Pilgrim, the main character, is struggling with PTSD looking for a way to justify everything that occurred. This story reflects Kurt Vonnegut’s side effects from his war experience.\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five -- A Great American Novel\n\n1390 Words | 3 Pages\n\nFor a novel to be considered a Great American Novel, it must contain a theme that is uniquely American, a hero that is the essence of a great American, or relevance to the American people. Others argue, however, that the Great American Novel may never exist. They say that America and her image are constantly changing and therefore, there will never be a novel that can represent the country in its entirety. In his novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut writes about war and its destructiveness. Vonnegut tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, an unlikely hero, mentally scarred by World War Two. Kurt Vonnegut explains how war is so devastating it can ruin a person forever. These are topics that are reoccurring in American history and have a relevance to the American people thus making Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five a Great American Novel.\n\nSilence Of The Lambs Themes\n\n644 Words | 2 Pages\n\nSilence of the Lambs, is commonly said to be one of the most famous thrillers made. After watching the film for the first time, I noticed the director had many interesting themes and concepts. Some of these themes included, good vs. evil, the search for peace, judging a book by its cover, and gender and sexuality in the workplace. The theme I found most interesting, and what I found the director made most apparent, was gender and sexuality in the workplace. The director showed that gender and sexuality in the workplace was the most noticeable theme because of the constant contrasts set between Clarice and her male co- workers, her continuous denial about her femininity, and the amount of danger Clarice runs into because as a women, she is always having to do things on her own.\n\nNight And Slaughterhouse Five Themes\n\n668 Words | 2 Pages\n\n‘Post-traumatic stress disorder starts out with nightmares, flashbacks and actually reliving the event. And this happens over and over and over and over in your mind. If you let it go on, it can become chronic and become hard if not impossible to treat.’ This is a quote by Dale Archer, a famous psychiatrist, and the quote explains the central theme of Night and Slaughterhouse-Five; Traumatic events in your life can haunt you. MORE EXPLAINATION\n\nWhy Slaughterhouse-Five Is an Anti-War Novel\n\n659 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn conclusion, Slaughterhouse-Five is an anti-war novel because Vonnegut, the character, says it is in the first chapter, the terrible damage it left on Billy, and how it exposes war's horrifying practices. Knowing these elements, one might wonder why people still have wars. Although these anti-war novels cannot completely stop wars, they are important. The role that such novels play is one of raising awareness of war's actions and wrongdoings. Since the role of the novels is important, authors should continue to write them to keep people informed and educated about a problem of such a huge magnitude.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five Analysis\n\n746 Words | 2 Pages\n\nWho would have guessed that? Along with war comes experiences that many haunt a person or will never be able to let go of. 70% of adults in the U.S. have experienced a traumatic event (PTSDUnited). PTSD or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder comes home with many soldiers. Most of the time they can't make sense of what is going on and why they are acting the way they are. In the book Slaughterhouse-five Billy Pilgrim goes through many stages of PTSD. Back when World War II was happening doctors weren’t aware of PTSD. The majority of the time doctors just thought that their patients were going crazy, much like what Billy’s daughter was thinking about her father. Classical authors such as Vonnegut put in the element of Billy seeing aliens to make him seem crazy and people to wonder what was wrong with him, because in that time that was the strangest thing that could occur. PTSD is seen as a very large problem after many different situations such as rescuers after a fire, war, and the operators helping someone talk through a tough situation. This book is apart of the literary canon because it is real. It talks about real problems people have and makes it interesting, not only is it fun to read but it's eye opening to see what others\n\nBilly Pilgrim Character Analysis\n\n639 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThough he was able to escape war unharmed, Billy seems to be mentally unstable. In fact, his nightmares in the German boxcar at the prisoners of war (POW) camp indicate that he is experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): “And now there was an acrimonious madrigal, with parts sung in all quarters of the car. Nearly everybody, seemingly, had an atrocity story of something Billy Pilgrim had done to him in his sleep. Everybody told Billy Pilgrim to keep the hell away” (79). Billy’s PTSD is also previously hinted when he panics at the sound of sirens: “A siren went off, scared the hell out of him. He was expecting World War III at any time. The siren was simply announcing high noon” (57). The most prominent symptom of PTSD, however, is reliving disturbing past experiences which is done to an even more extreme extent with Billy as Slaughterhouse-Five’s chronology itself correlates with this symptom. Billy’s “abduction” and conformity to Tralfamadorian beliefs seem to be his method of managing his insecurity and PTSD. He uses the Tralfamadorian motto “so it goes” as a coping mechanism each time he relives a tragic event. As Billy struggles with the conflict of PTSD, the work’s chronological order is altered, he starts to believe\n\nComparing Themes in Cat’s Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five\n\n1891 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThroughout his career, Kurt Vonnegut has used writing as a tool to convey penetrating messages and ominous warnings about our society. He skillfully combines vivid imagery with a distinctly satirical and anecdotal style to explore complex issues such as religion and war. Two of his most well known, and most gripping, novels that embody this subtle talent are Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five. Both books represent Vonnegut’s genius for manipulating fiction to reveal glaring, disturbing and occasionally redemptive truths about human nature. On the surface, Cat’s Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five are dramatically different novels, each with its own characters, symbols, and plot. However, a close examination reveals that both contain common themes and ideas. Examining and comparing the two novels and their presentation of different themes provides a unique insight into both the novels and the author – allowing the reader to gain a fuller understanding of Vonnegut’s true meaning.\n\nWhy Is Billy Pilgrim Insane\n\n1051 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBilly Pilgrim is also not like Pilgrim who is the main character in the “The Pilgrim’s Progress”, although they have same last name. His experience is very horrible in the war, there are just have violence and cruel, like the soldier who is in the “Three musketeers”. Imaginary, a man who just naive and have a great lucky, how can he keep his life in the war, just lucky? It is funny. Thus, though the whole novel “Slaughter-Five” by Kurt Vonnegut, the main character, Billy Pilgrim is a contradictory person who has the naive and sane attitude together, in almost time he looks like a child, but his wise can “see” at his speaking and action, likes his speaking “So it goes.” (2) Not only is the indifference to the lives, or the hatred and"
