        "text": "James Franco has a soft spot for the literary classics.\n\nHe recently adapted two William Faulkner novels, As I Lay Dying and The Sound and the Fury, and is currently in post-production on an adaptation of John Steinbeck’s In Dubious Battle. He has also played Allen Ginsberg in circa-1950s San Francisco as he worked on his epic poem Howl.\n\nNow, he lends his voice for Audible’s audio book of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five.\n\nVonnegut’s satirical, semi-autobiographical novel that features World War II, time travel, alien abduction, human zoos and an optometrist appeared on Times‘ list of 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\n\nA film adaptation of the Slaughterhouse-Five came out in 1972, premiering at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe book can be purchased through Audible here.\n\nListen to Franco reading Vonnegut in the player below."
