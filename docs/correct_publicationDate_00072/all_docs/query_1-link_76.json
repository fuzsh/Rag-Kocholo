        "text": "❉ George Roy Hill’s adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.’s acclaimed semi-autobiographical novel.\n\nBilly Pilgrim is an ordinary World War II soldier with one major exception: he has mysteriously become “unstuck in time”. With his life happening in a seemingly random order, Billy goes on an uncomfortable trip back and forth from his birth in New York to life on a distant planet and back again to the horrors of the 1945 fire-bombing of Dresden.\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr’s classic sci-fi novel comes to life in this haunting film from acclaimed director George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting).\n\nStarring Michael Sacks as Billy Pilgrim, this dazzling and thought provoking sci-fi drama co-stars Ron Leibman (Rachel’s father in Friends) and Valerie Perrine (Superman, Superman II). Sacks retired from film in 1984, ending up as a Chief Operating Officer for Morgan Stanley on Wall Street.\n\nIn 1972 Slaughterhouse Five was nominated for the Palme D’or and won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDuring World War II Kurt Vonnegut Jr survived the Allied firebombing of Dresden which killed 130,000 people. He was also a prisoner of war and was captured at the Battle of Bulge on December 22, 1944. He used these experiences in his book.\n\nWith regards to the adaptation of Slaughterhouse Five, Kurt Vonnegut Jr said “I drool and cackle every time I watch that film, because it is so harmonious with what I felt when I wrote the book.”\n\nCast: Michael Sacks, Ron Leibman, Valerie Perrine, Eugene Roche, Sharon Gans, Holly Near, Perry King.\n\n❉ ‘Slaughterhouse Five’ (Certificate: 15, Running Time: 106 mins) is released by Fabulous Films Ltd/Fremantle Media Enterprises on DVD, 27 March 2017, RRP £9.99 – pre-order now; and on Blu-Ray, date tbc, RRP £14.99.\n\n❉ Source: Fabulous Films\n\n❉ We Are Cult is not responsible for the content of this news release."
