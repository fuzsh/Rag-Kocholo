        "text": "Despite the reputation of both the author, and this book in particular, this was my first time reading anything by Kurt Vonnegut and it is, arguably, his most well-known work, Slaughterhouse-Five.\n\nI’ll admit that going in I knew very little of it other than it was vaguely science fiction and had an anti-war message so I was surprised by a couple of things.\n\nFirst was its brevity, and then as it read on quite how much Vonnegut manages to pack into its brief duration.\n\nIn this, amongst other ways, it reminded me somewhat of Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange which was published at a similar time.\n\nThe story, something a shaggy dog story in many ways, concerns a World War Two veteran called Billy Pilgrim who, it transpires, was not only present at the bombing of Dresden in 1945 as a prisoner of war (an event that is the central pivot of the story) but who also experiences shifts in time.\n\nThis device means we trace the story of his life, almost in its entirety, in fragmented and disjointed fashion, shifting with him from place to place and time to time.\n\nIt also adds what would in film be described as a Lynchian feel, though maybe Lynch was inspired by Vonnegut, as does the final conclusion that, like Lynch’s work very much leaves the reader to make up their own mind about what they have read.\n\nFor me then, the ambling nature of the story, which is, astonishingly, semi-autobiographical, as told by a specific narrator, left something of a feeling of futility.\n\nPredominantly about the futility of war, about its cruelness and pointlessness and also about how it renders humans into automata (again reflecting A Clockwork Orange).\n\nIt also though, in a strangely positive way, gives a broader message of hope in that, while it says we can’t change what happens to us, our existence is also key to all of history.\n\nThese are just my ideas upon just finishing the book, but I would imagine they will develop with further reflection and that different readers will likely get rather different things out of it.\n\nIn that sense then I find it hard to see Slaughterhouse-Five as the un-challenged classic it is touted as, however it is packed with ideas while also being a compelling story and certainly more than worth a read, particularly if you like the work of David Lynch."
