        "text": "It took me so long to get into this that I can tell you I read Sinead O’Connor’s autobiography, Rememberings, twice no less, in the time it took me to finish Slaughterhouse-Five. I think that’s partly due to Vonnegut’s prose insomuch as I never felt compelled to pick the book up. Well, that and I went on an absolute Sinead O’Connor side quest (one which is far from over). A shared theme in both books is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from which Vonnegut suffered (as a result of the war) but sadly before it was diagnosable and O’Connor suffered from (as a result of an abusive childhood) but was disgracefully misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.\n\nOnce I started to get into the rhythm of the novel, I finished the second half in one setting. Slaughterhouse-Five is a semi-autobiographical account of Vonnegut’s witnessing World War II in general and the catastrophic firebombing of Dresden in particular. The story, while fictionally attributed to a ‘Billy Pilgrim’, is told from Vonnegut’s experience as a prisoner of war who was held, at the time of the bombings, in a Dresden slaughter-shed from which the book takes its name. The novel, at its core, is an anti-war story which explores the senselessness of war while also exploring the mundane and the frivolous.\n\nThe narrative is nonlinear (another reason I struggled with the reading) and incorporates elements of science fiction, such as the ‘Tralfamadorian’ concept of time and their deterministic view of the universe. I was particularly drawn to the theme of determinism as this is a philosophical concept that interests me greatly. I read on the Wikipedia entry for the novel, that it was seen as a critique of determinism. I don’t have time here to discuss the nuances of hard vs. soft determinism but I was curious enough to follow the link. What I found was some fascinating secondary scholarship by David L. Vanderwerken:\n\nIn Billy’s fractured mind, Tralfamadorian determinism collides head-on with Christian determinism […] For Vonnegut, belief in an omnipotent Creator involved in directing human history has resulted in two great evils: the acceptance of war as God’s will; the assumption that we carry out God’s will and that God is certainly on our side. Sodom, Gomorrah, Dresden, Hiroshima — urbicide is just God’s will. Vonnegut directs his rage in Slaughterhouse-Five at a murderous supernatural Christianity that creates Children’s Crusades, that allows humankind to rationalize butchery in the name of God, or Allah, that absolves people from guilt. Since for Vonnegut, all wars are, finally, “holy,” “jihadic,” he urges us to rid ourselves of a supernatural concept of God.\n\nThis made me finally understand why the full title of the book is actually Slaughterhouse-Five, or the Children’s Crusade. Not sure I am ready for another Vonnegut novel just yet but I will have plenty to say on determinism and Sinead O’Connor."
