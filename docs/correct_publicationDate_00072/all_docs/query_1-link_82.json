        "text": "Description\n\nFirst Edition, Publishers' Original Binding, With Dustwrapper\n\nFirst UK Edition.\n\nIn the publisher's original unclipped dust wrapper.\n\nThis is a wonderful copy of Vonnegut's popular fiction novel, which follows the life of Billy Pilgrim from his time as a soldier in World War Two, and his life afterwards. The book is told in non-linear order, often switching back and forth to flashbacks during Billy's time as a prisoner of war, and is one of the most enduring anti-war novels of all time.\n\nKurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) was an American author with a long writing career, having published fourteen books, three short story plays, and five works of nonfiction. Some of his most popular novels other than 'Slaughterhouse-Five' include 'Cat's Cradle', 'Welcome to the Monkey House', and 'A Man Without a Country'.\n\nCollated, complete.\n\nCondition\n\nIn the publisher's original cloth binding, in the original unclipped dust wrapper. Externally, excellent, with just a bit of fading to the top edge of boards and a few marks to spine.Dust wrapper is very smart, with minor edge wear to the wraps and a few marks. Dampstain to the top edge of the reverse of wraps, with some wear to the left of fly leaves. Internally, firmly bound. Pages are very bright and clean throughout, with light age-toning to margins of text.\n\nOverall: Near Fine\n\nDelivery & payment\n\nWe send all of our books via courier which is a fully tracked and insured service. In our experience we find this to be the most reliable and quickest form of delivery. Our primary courier is DHL, but we are able to accommodate special requests if required, including postal delivery for items under 2kg. See More Details"
