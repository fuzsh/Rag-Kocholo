        "text": "Nonsense and humor can be powerful tools\n\nThomas Jenkins\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nThe Coastline is Quiet\n\n·\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 19, 2017\n\n--\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five is funny, absurd, and irreverent. It also deals with some of the most tragic events in human history. It’s no small achievement, then, that this book uses its remarkable irreverence to convey the horror and death of war in a meaningful manner. In some ways, this irreverence is its greatest tool.\n\nI love reading works of fiction that are based on real-world, historical events. I just finished Denis Johnson’s Tree of Smoke, and I came away quite impressed. I was drawn to Slaughterhouse-Five because of a Reddit post that quoted the book. Based on the beauty of this quote and my taste for historical fiction (though that label is somewhat misapplied here) I picked up the book and read through it quickly. It’s a short read, and its historical imaginings and beautiful writing make it well worth the time.\n\nMy ultimate conclusion about Slaughterhouse-Five isn’t just that it’s a good book (though it is). The novel’s biggest importance is how it uses humor and absurdity to tell history. Given the often horrific nature of human history, this is a lesson well worth learning. Vonnegut may not be trying to redefine the field of history with this novel, but his work conveys the tragedy of World War II far more personally than any work of academic history ever could.\n\nOne of the best examples of Vonnegut’s style is the excerpt that convinced me to read the book. Here it is, below:\n\n“It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.”\n\nMost people probably understand that the bombing runs in World War II were dangerous for everyone involved, a long list that included the bomber crews, fighter pilots, and (most tragically) civilians below. It’s far more different to understand just how much death and destruction these attacks caused however, and Vonnegut’s re-imagining of these events in reverse reminds readers that these campaigns were devastating. This is not a quantitative table that shows the number of people who died on any given date, but rather a far more emotional reminder of the human cost. There are no heroes, no villains, just death.\n\nThis excerpt is indicative of the entire book. Vonnegut tells the story of World War II through the mind of Billy Pilgrim, a soldier who has become “un-stuck in time.” Pilgrim travels through different events — before, during, and after the Second World War — and Vonnegut uses this device to frame the different events of his narrative. There’s a certain irreverence to his prose, as Vonnegut never appears to take any societal institution or belief seriously. The human deaths in the war never fall prey to this irreverence, though. Vonnegut’s sincerity is on full display in these parts.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five is so original, so compelling, that it almost creates its own genre on what the best ways are to remember human tragedies. Academic historians do a wonderful job of historicizing the narratives and importance of events, and the world of academic history is incredibly valuable. I think it falls to other disciplines (at least usually) to record the more human side, and thus the full emotional impact, of events like the Dresden bombing or the Holocaust. Many historians have started to incorporate more personal writing and language into their work, and I applaud their efforts. Nobody would confuse Vonnegut’s work for an academic history though, and this fact give it much of its power.\n\nAs valuable as Vonnegut’s technique is though, I’m not sure how applicable it is to other writers. I don’t think anyone could write a book like this unless he or she had actually lived through the Dresden bombing, meaning that much of Slaughterhouse-Five is impossible to replicate. Vonnegut is also a masterful wordsmith, meaning that his expertise lies at the intersection of a Venn Diagram on “experience” and “skill.” It takes unbelievable ability to write an absurd book about a deeply tragic subject, and Vonnegut’s skill alone would be worth another post.\n\nThere is still a lesson from this book, even for those who aren’t great writers or lack historical experience. Even if historians and or journalists can’t replicate the full appeal of Vonnegut’s book, the principle of using every possible tool to write about history is still valuable. Perhaps this means interspersing academic history with personal vignettes (something historians Kate Brown and Edward Baptist are both experts at). Perhaps it also means taking a moment to reflect on the human experiences of events, but this is something that every good historian should already do. In any case, it should be easy to admit that this book is one of the finest works of history about World War II."
