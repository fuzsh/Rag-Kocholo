        "text": "“Slaughterhouse-Five” by Kurt Vonnegut was published in 1969. It is a science fiction story about Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who becomes unstuck in time.\n\nHis conscience is transferred to his past self in the POW camps, and to his future self in an alien zoo on the planet Tralfamadore.\n\nHe learns of the Tralfamadorian’s view of time. The species sees time in “four dimensions,” seeing all of time at the same time.\n\nThus, death means nothing to them. They just say, “So it goes.”\n\nThe book is considered semi-autobiographical, as it is based on Vonnegut’s experience about the firebombing of Dresden in World War II.\n\nThe novel portrays a nihilistic perspective of war while examining what it means to be human.\n\nThe Tralfamadorian philosophy is held up in contrast with the intensely human despair of the war.\n\nSome interpret Billy’s time travel as post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nBilly transporting back to the field of war could be seen as a flashback and his travels to the future as hallucinations.\n\nAccording to this theory, the Tralfamadorians and their philosophy is just Billy’s lethargy as a result of the trauma he’s been through.\n\nThe novel has been banned from schools over the years, mainly for profanity.\n\nDespite this, the novel has been called a classic. Time magazine named it one of the 100 best English-language novels of all time.\n\nMr. Chris Schmidt, quiz bowl and chess coach, enjoys Vonnegut’s work.\n\n“He’s a lot like John Steinbeck,” Schmidt said. “He uses simple language. He isn’t elitist by the way of someone like James Joyce.”\n\nAs for me, “Slaughterhouse-Five” is my favorite book. The way Vonnegut plays with the timeline of the story is genius.\n\nVonnegut’s trademark sarcastic writing style fits perfectly with the feelings of the soldiers."
