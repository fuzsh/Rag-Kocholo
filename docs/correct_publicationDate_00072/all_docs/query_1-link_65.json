Slight rubbing at the base of the spine, a faint splash to the closed text block, previous owner's name on the first blank and half-title. Dust jacket with a faint splash on the front panel and a small bit of white paint at the heel of the spine.\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s masterful satire about the bombing of Dresden and the strange time traveling experiences of Billy Pilgrim. The book was nominated for both a Hugo and Nebula Award the year it was released and was ranked 18th by Modern Library on its list of the 100 best books of the century. Slaughterhouse Five was partly autobiographical, as Vonnegut served in the army and witnessed the bombing firsthand during World War II. Though controversial around its release due to its depictions of sex, the novel grew to be quite popular and was adapted into a film in 1972, which would win the Prix de Jury at the Cannes Film Festival later that year. “…Slaughterhouse Five is an extraordinary success. It is a book we need to read, and to reread. It has the same virtues as Vonnegut’s best previous work. It is funny, compassionate and wise… Kurt Vonnegut Jr is a true artist.” (Contemporary New York Times Review) Very Good + in Very Good + dust jacket. (Item #5814)"
