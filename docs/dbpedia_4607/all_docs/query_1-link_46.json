        "text": "Physical safety\n\nAt the scale of the neighbourhood, Downtown Minneapolis participants were the most attentive to micro-features of the surrounding environment. Noted elements included heavy traffic, uneven pavement, brief crosswalk timing and seasonal snow piles. Participants such as Trudy explained the stress and danger of navigating difficult terrain:\n\nWhen you cross the street at the corners, you've got to climb the snow mounds. And then when you get on the snow mounds, it's icy … It's like the city doesn't care that there are senior people and disabled people. (Trudy, 60, Downtown Minneapolis)\n\nTrudy felt worn down by physical struggles around her building and neighbourhood. The walkway of her apartment entrance was treacherous given its uneven surface and slick bricks. After several falls while accessing disability transit, Trudy requested to switch her pick-up location to the back door. She taught herself to navigate the three steps with a walker while laden with groceries and house supplies. Trudy and others enhanced physical insideness (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983) through proactive steps. Frank (77, Downtown Minneapolis) taught himself the safest route to commute to and from the senior centre. He learned exactly where the icy spots were to avoid, and memorised the location of benches along his commute to rest. With limited access to cars, participants like Frank relied heavily on buses and ‘skyways’ (indoor pathways) to shield from weather and dangerous street traffic.\n\nThe older housing stock of North Minneapolis posed physical safety hazards to residents as their dwellings literally aged around them. Participants worried about their multi-storey houses and being unable to afford necessary modifications such as grab bars, sturdy ramps and accessible furniture. Some participants implemented low-cost strategies to boost personal safety, including de-cluttering to remove tripping hazards, putting a chair in the shower and wearing a fall pendant. They relied on physical insideness by memorising home layouts and knowing spaces with intimate body-awareness (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983). Often unable to afford home improvements, participants pointed with concern to crumbling stairs, mould, peeling paint and poor ventilation that posed health and fire hazards. They could not afford to hire services to remain safely at home, including cleaning, handy work, yardwork and home-based care. Participants weighed the benefits of remaining in their familiar home and neighbourhood with the escalating risk of falling, burdensome home maintenance and health hazards.\n\nInstability and emotional insecurity\n\nLong-time renters, homeless participants and those in transitional housing exposed the exclusive and unrealistic stereotype that older people reside comfortably in a long-term residence. Their experiences countered assumptions that older individuals desire and expect to age in place in a familiar home environment of their choosing for as long as possible (e.g. Wahl et al., Reference Wahl, Iwarsson and Oswald2012). Financial resources impacted the ability to stay put and choice of living situation (Wahl and Oswald, Reference Wahl, Oswald, Bengtson and Settersten2016). Participants without stable housing expressed statements of anxiety and insecurity because of their transient residential situations. Mary (66, Downtown Minneapolis) had only recently secured a government-subsidised apartment after a workplace injury caused her to lose her job: ‘In a moment, your whole life changes. You lose your job, you lose your income, you lose your home, you lose your savings. It was a nightmare, all of it. I'm still recovering.’ Displacement was traumatic. Those in unstable situations desperately wanted more long-term, secure and autonomous living accommodation. They exhibited unequal access to and uneven opportunities for place attachment given unexpected life circumstances and resource limitations.\n\nFurther, the home was not necessarily an extension of the self. Experiences in subsidised housing emphasised prohibitive rules that restricted a ‘homey’ atmosphere. Apartments were not necessarily central gathering points or repositories for treasured memories (Gieseking et al., Reference Gieseking, Mangold, Katz, Low and Saegert2014). Some participants could not inhabit residential spaces in a way to make them feel like home. Personal space in subsidised housing was routinely violated with mandatory home inspections and restrictive rules against modifications and decorations. These restrictions limited the creation of a homey autonomous space, and made some participants feel ‘stuck in place’ without the financial resources to relocate to more comfortable and secure living situations. Elective belonging (Phillipson, Reference Phillipson2007) was not an option for all participants. When the researchers entered subsidised apartments, participants often apologised for the bare or outdated surroundings. They expressed frustration at the lack of autonomy and minimal level of personalisation allowed in the home. Participants stated desires to replace carpeting, repaint and refurnish to feel more comfortable, such as installing a softer carpet underfoot for arthritic joints.\n\nAmbient sounds of yelling, banging and gunshots, as well as being robbed by neighbours, made some participants feel defenceless and insecure. Richard (77, Downtown Minneapolis) explained on his mobile interview: ‘There's been robberies and attacks right outside here. Right outside. In fact, one of the residents was severely beaten and robbed right here.’ As a result of his fears, Richard was largely homebound and did not enjoy living in his apartment. He felt unsafe and desperately wanted to move back to South-East Asia in order to be closer to his friends and youthful aspirations. His situation countered assumptions of the home as an anchor of identity and source of wellbeing (Hay, Reference Hay1998). Socio-economic barriers limited Richard's ability to achieve continuity and control over his domestic situation and optimise place attachment. Ageing in place for some was an isolated and precarious existence (Aldwin and Igarashi, Reference Aldwin and Igarashi2012; Finlay, Reference Finlay2018; Finlay and Kobayashi, Reference Finlay and Kobayashi2018).\n\nThe homeless participants in Downtown Minneapolis felt keenly vulnerable to their surroundings. Their safety strategies included queuing for early entry to the shelter and going to sleep in the late afternoon to avoid rowdy night-time crowds. Ian (60, Downtown Minneapolis) locked himself in his small single room at the homeless centre by dusk and did not use the communal bathroom at night to avoid the regular fights and crime just outside in the hallways. Iris (68, Downtown Minneapolis) bounced between hospitals, group homes and homeless shelters since eviction from her last apartment for hoarding. Living in her current shelter for the past seven months, Iris struggled to feel comfortable or safe. She had not showered due to the lack of secure women's facilities:\n\nThey have one room for the men, and then way over there (indicating a room approximately ten metres away) another room for the women. We eat together, but then men want to stay in the dining room and always come into the women's room. I have to walk from here all the way to over there (indicating a room approximately 20 metres away) to go to the bathroom. That's no privacy. I haven't taken a bath since I've been here because there's no privacy. [I'm] waiting [to shower] until I get a place because I don't trust it. There's no privacy.\n\nAs a result of physical and emotional insecurity, Iris stated that there was ‘no point’ in conducting the mobile interview because ‘nowhere around here matters’. She travelled daily around downtown in search of free meals from churches and charity organisations. The shelter was a constant source of distress and restricted autonomy: ‘I'm sad I'm in this shelter. I can't do what I want to do.’ Because of repeated evictions, Iris was barred from moving back into Minneapolis public housing. Lack of security and safety were constant sources of frustration, disappointment and fear. Both Iris and Ian desperately wanted their own private apartments and reliable places to call home (Wahl and Oswald, Reference Wahl, Oswald, Bengtson and Settersten2016). The inability to own or rent a home, and thereby participate in normative civic life (Hayden, Reference Hayden1995), inhibited the cultivation of residential belonging ‘in place’ (Relph, Reference Relph1976).\n\nAdjusting to adversity\n\nDowntown Minneapolis participants expressed feeling safer with building security features such as cameras and locked entryways. In North Minneapolis, participants similarly mentioned locked doors, alarm systems and night-time lighting that made them feel safer. Residents with a weak sense-of-place felt unsafe living in close proximity to drug trafficking, crime incidents and foreclosed lots. Shirley (72, North Minneapolis), a recent immigrant in subsidised housing, noted: ‘The neighbourhood's no good. Too much drinking, fighting, smoking, using abusive language. It's not good. People drive by shooting at things.’ Shirley's fearful situation represented a temporary situation while she tried to sort out a better residence. She did not feel that it was a good place for her or other older individuals, but given severely restricted finances had no other options. Her observations reflect Blokland's (Reference Blokland2008) study of place-making in New Haven (Connecticut) housing projects, where home – a connection and rootedness to one's place of dwelling – is routinely denied, especially to the poor and people of colour in Western settings. Shirley felt unsafe and lost, which meaningfully limited opportunities to feel rooted ‘in place’. Structural issues and social injustice impacted opportunities to live in stable, safe and comfortable homes.\n\nLong-term North Minneapolis residents expressed that a certain level of vandalism and petty theft was normal and felt unperturbed by minor incidents. Long-time resident Timothy (77, North Minneapolis) explained: ‘Doesn't make a difference what neighbourhood you live in, you're going to have some type of vandalism.’ Participants strategically invoked memory and imagination to cultivate a sense of belonging and a re-assuring sense of living in a ‘good place’. Timothy overlooked local crime hotspots and dilapidated services to focus instead on the strengths of his community. He fondly pointed to worn-down storefronts during the mobile interview and remembered the corner store as a familiar sight of childhood summer trips for soda, teenage employment and milk runs as a young parent. The now-closed barbershop was still vibrant in Timothy's mind as it cohered warm memories and youthful ambitions. Participants referenced a plethora of ‘incident places’ that spanned their entire lifetimes and contributed to a rich and comforting sense of autobiographical insideness (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983). The quality and intensity of these reflections helped Timothy maintain a largely positive connection to his local environment. He exemplified a strong sense of belonging (Wahl et al., Reference Wahl, Iwarsson and Oswald2012) through subjective evaluations and selective emotional interpretations of the immediate neighbourhood.\n\nFor widows now living alone, however, this sense of safety could diminish. Participants such as Millie (78, North Minneapolis) felt frightened and unsettled by house break-ins. Her neighbourhood had socio-economically declined with the intrusion of transient renters, crime and abandoned lots. Now alone at home, Millie felt invaded and her sense of security reduced. The police were disinterested in her following up on calls and complaints. The physical and social neighbourhood setting no longer corresponded to her needs or identity, yet she felt defensive about remaining ‘in place’. Millie anxiously weighed deep-rooted affection for her home against the safety risks and lack of responsive emergency services.\n\nVital locations\n\nRetail and recreation sites were essential activities and destinations built into everyday habit. Service destinations not only functioned practically; they were also primary sources of entertainment, sites of comfort and belonging, and reasons to ‘get out the door’. Senior centres in Eden Prairie and Downtown Minneapolis were valued locations to gather and interact with others, learn new skills and have fun. Male participants especially mentioned these locations, such as spending every weekday morning in the woodshop ‘with the guys’ seeking companionship and purpose. Retail sites were vital to individuals such as Brenda (73, Eden Prairie): ‘If I get really depressed or down, I leave the building. Get in my car and go. I go to a lot of thrift shops, [food shelves], Goodwill, or just browse around [the local department store].’ Brenda felt ‘at home’ in these shops where she was greeted by familiar employees and storefronts. She transformed local retail spaces into meaningful places, and through regular visits developed insider status (Hay, Reference Hay1998). Grocery stores and coffee shops were similar sites of entertainment and connection, and participants often went every week. Such trips represented an affordable stimulation strategy and method to connect with others: employees and staff, regular customers, neighbours and ambient multigenerational contact. Opportunities to build social relationships cultivated a rooted sense-of-place in varying geographic locales (Low and Altman, Reference Low and Altman1992; Hay, Reference Hay1998).\n\nSense of community and interconnection through local sites enabled everyday life ‘in place’ (Kyle and Chick, Reference Kyle and Chick2007; Scannell and Gifford, Reference Scannell and Gifford2010). Affection and rooted connection to a local coffee shop shone through Rachel's (74, Downtown Minneapolis) mobile interview. Rachel lived alone and was estranged from her children. She found community through the little coffee shop on her block. After walking in, the staff greeted Rachel with familiarity and warmth. An employee immediately began her usual coffee and cookie order while asking about her upcoming dentist appointment and opinion about a nearby art show. Rachel frequented the coffee shop daily, accumulating a monthly tab that she paid immediately after her welfare cheque arrived. This shop represented a site of comfort, care and attention, and one of the primary reasons she enjoyed her apartment and wanted to remain living there. Rachel mentioned memory concerns and struggled to live alone. Rotting food, dirty surfaces and perilous stacks of belongings flagged researchers’ attention to her perilous living situation. Despite these risks, Rachel planned to ‘live to 100’ years old in the apartment. She was content with her situation given the coffee shop downstairs and two grocery stores within walking distance. These observations complicate assumptions that place attachment is fundamentally good. Due to a deep sense of belonging, Rachel put herself at risk to remain in her apartment. She and others prioritised rootedness and insider status even in sub-optimal living conditions and hazardous residential situations.\n\nLimited options\n\nIn North Minneapolis, participants were frustrated by the lack of nearby grocery stores. Jeremy (72, North Minneapolis) reported the dearth of nutritious food services: ‘If you're living on Mountain Dew and potato chips, you're fine. If you're looking for fresh fruit and vegetables, lean fresh meats … it's much harder to do.’ In this food desert (Cummins and Macintyre, Reference Cummins and Macintyre2002; Walker et al., Reference Walker, Keane and Burke2010), fast food, convenience stores and liquor outlets were dominant, with participants travelling downtown or further into the suburbs for groceries. Jeremy was focused on his health given recent scares: ‘I spend a lot of time trying to eat well, exercise, be healthy and make healthy choices so that my quality of life will stay good for as long as possible. That's where I spend my energy.’ He felt increasingly unsatisfied by the lack of local healthy food options and pessimistic about the suitability of his neighbourhood.\n\nParticipants expressed further frustration at the shortage of amenities and lack of investment in North Minneapolis’ low-income areas. In addition to grocery stores, this included a dearth of coffee shops, cafes and restaurants. Raquel noted:\n\nThere are a lot of seniors that are our friends who are isolated. I think it's because we don't have places where you can just go sit down, have a cup of coffee, see who comes in, visit with one another. (Raquel, 74, North Minneapolis)\n\nThe lack of services was a barrier to cultivating a sense of inclusion, belonging and enjoyment in the community. One exception was a newly opened YMCA with a senior-specific gym and exercise classes. Ingrid explained:\n\nThey built a YMCA for us 50-plus … The people there, we're all older. It's just like a big social club. We work out, but we also laugh and have fun. It's just a bunch of old people getting together and hanging out. I always felt that laughter is very healthy for you. I feel rejuvenated going there, both mentally and spiritually. It's just like a safe haven to go to, plus we get healthy. (Ingrid, 66, North Minneapolis)\n\nParticipants visited ‘the Y’ for exercise, and to socialise with fellow attendees and friendly staff. They appreciated the culturally relevant and age-appropriate services offered to local African American residents. Churches across North Minneapolis also provided meaningful connection and belonging through a network of services and support for residents. Members stated that their faith communities ‘look out for you’ and ‘check in’ on a regular basis. Participants both provided and received supportive services such as rides, meals, luncheons, organised activities and grief counselling through their churches. Local organisations, shops and centres catering to seniors contributed meaningfully to feeling able to age well in the home and community. Participants cultivated place attachment to multiple locations beyond their homes and immediate environments. They leveraged local community strengths, including the YMCA and churches, to overcome disadvantages such as the lack of grocery stores and coffee shops.\n\nEssential community\n\nParticipants such as Raquel (74, North Minneapolis) cultivated strong friendship groups and felt firmly embedded in the local social fabric. Raquel relied on a network of close friends during widowhood:\n\nI have very good friends. I've been widowed since 1978, and had I not had those friends, it would have been very difficult for me. And then they're like family … very close good friends that care about you.\n\nOverall, North Minneapolis participants reported the lowest levels of isolation and loneliness. Primarily African American, these participants were often deeply entrenched socially and enfolded within local multigenerational networks. They reported satisfaction from regular interactions with grandchildren, family, friends, neighbours and community members. Racial inclusiveness was a valued element. Participants purposefully chose homes in the diverse area, and stated desires to continue living in a racially inclusive community. Harmonious living enabled participants to cultivate mutual identification with a community of shared group morals, norms and expectations (Rowles, Reference Rowles, Skinner, Andrews and Cutchin2017).\n\nLong-time residents were fiercely proud and passionate about their community, and expressly rejected what they viewed as unfair media portrayals and negative racial stereotypes of North Minneapolis. Both African American and White North Minneapolis residents felt that it was the ideal place to live given the robust multiracial and multigenerational community. This resilient attitude was common among long-term residents and those enmeshed within strong family networks. Sally (67, North Minneapolis), for example, had supportive neighbours and immediate family who helped with chores, transportation and watched out for each other: ‘I know everybody in [my neighbourhood]. No one will mess with you, we're just like family, we really are. Everybody helps each other.’ These participants relied upon a web of supportive community connections and ‘common sense’ to feel secure and interconnected. Participants benefited from intimate social and cultural networks built up over time. This led to concern about having to move due to declining health and independence, and the incumbent social and emotional upheaval. Without suitable age-friendly housing stock (e.g. one-floor apartments), assisted living or appropriate services in North Minneapolis, there were limited opportunities to age ‘in community’. What was ‘good’ about the community – leafy streets, single-family homes, quiet neighbourhoods – were age-specific to accommodate earlier phases of life. Participants worried that the neighbourhood could not physically accommodate changing needs, and that they would burden family members. Participants requested that affordable, age-friendly, one-floor apartments and assisted living options be built to enable them to remain in the community close to kin.\n\nStruggles to stay connected\n\nParticipants living geographically far away from family and friends struggled with loneliness and felt less rooted ‘in place’. Several female participants in Downtown Minneapolis and Eden Prairie moved to be closer to their children and expressed the heartache of missing their ‘real home’ and long-time friends. They lamented at how difficult it was to be a transplant and break into already-existing social groups, which lowered residential satisfaction. Built form affected opportunities for socialisation, such as shared hallways and courtyards in apartments to regularly interact with neighbours versus more-isolating single-family homes. Participants in high-rise buildings took advantage of elevator conversations with neighbours and building staff (Finlay and Kobayashi, Reference Finlay and Kobayashi2018). They appreciated maintenance and social workers who provided social stimulation and support.\n\nHarsh weather, including intense summer heat and winter snow, challenged participants’ abilities to stay connected and content. Participants curtailed activities to only necessary trips during inclement weather to ensure their safety, which diminished opportunities for socialisation (Finlay, Reference Finlay2018). Rebecca (77, Downtown Minneapolis), for example, felt cooped up and was afraid to venture outside. She was afraid to walk outside on the ice but felt ‘very trapped’ and ‘bored to tears staying home’. Rebecca occupied a unique position: her building was previously entirely subsidised housing and then transitioned into high-end market rentals. Rebecca lived in one of 20 units still subsidised, and knew that she had ‘won the lottery’ to be a low-income woman living in a luxurious apartment building. Yet Rebecca was desperately unhappy and preferred the old entirely subsidised model because of the organised social activities and sense of community. She previously felt ‘at home’ and connected to other residents, with all of her needs accommodated. Rebecca expressed feeling foolish at her desire to move into less-nice subsidised housing, but emphasised that community and companionship were her top priorities.\n\nA major fear for isolated individuals such as Betty (78, North Minneapolis) was dying alone: ‘What I am most afraid of is that I die inside my home, without anybody else living here or coming to the house, and that they won't find me until I've been decomposing for a few days.’ To combat this, Betty and others developed buddy-systems with friends and family. They checked on each other regularly through phone calls and visits to feel more comfortable and safe. Pets also provided comfort and companionship. Participants stressed the importance of living somewhere that afforded regular social interaction and interpersonal connection.\n\nThe tipping point\n\nOne's level of social connectedness often represented a ‘tipping point’ for participants dealing with challenges of the built environment. They did not have the resources of more affluent participants to invest in social strategies such as seasonal travel to warmer destinations, restaurant meals with family and cultural events with friends. When low-income participants felt isolated and unsupported, they tended to feel unhappy with their residential situation and advocated for moving. Lack of social insideness (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983) was crippling. Shannon (71, Downtown Minneapolis), for example, was fed up with the smoke infiltration and vermin infestation of her subsidised apartment building. Her frustration multiplied after her daughter moved out and she no longer had any friends in the building. Feeling separated, alienated or excluded – what Relph (Reference Relph1976) termed outsideness – undermined residential wellbeing. Conversely, those with robust social connectedness overlooked and overcame built environment challenges. The elevator in Frank's (77, Downtown Minneapolis) building often broke and he could not climb the seven flights of stairs safely. Though the building did not accommodate his physical needs, Frank thought that it was an ideal location for him because he had cultivated a valuable network of friends and relationships in the building and local area. He desired to maintain ‘rootedness’ despite sub-optimal living conditions (Fang et al., Reference Fang, Woolrych, Sixsmith, Canham, Battersby and Sixsmith2016).\n\nIngrid (66) lived in a dilapidated North Minneapolis house with moulding walls, gapped floorboards and broken concrete steps. She overlooked this and considered it a good place to live because of her long-time community:\n\nI'm comfortable. I feel safe here. I was born here – I'm probably only three or four miles away from where I grew up. I know lots of people. My church is here; my whole life is here.\n\nThe proximity and depth of social connections were major factors in any sense of rootedness and satisfaction with living situation despite physical risk. Participants such as Ingrid remained rooted in places that had changed and disintegrated over time, presenting daily fall hazards and health risks. Ingrid refused to consider leaving her decaying home due to an unwillingness to abandon long-cultivated insideness. She perceived that to abandon the home would be to give up her identity (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983). In fact, the physical decay of Ingrid's home precipitated even stronger emotional attachment to the home as she felt defensive of the house so tied to her self-identity (Proshansky et al., Reference Proshansky, Fabian and Kaminoff1983). Ageing in place thus produced hazardous situations for some with sub-standard housing and lack of appropriate support.\n\nEveryday routines\n\nSmall-scale activities such as reading, writing, knitting, cooking, gardening, watching television, talking on the phone and receiving/providing care meaningfully filled the day. Participants often recounted daily migration through the home at uniform and regulated times – such as Warren (65, Eden Prairie) who ate ‘breakfast at 7 o'clock in the kitchen, followed by reading the newspaper in the sunny front room, 11 o'clock lunch, afternoon chores and 3 o'clock tea in the shady back room’. He felt immensely happy to enjoy his own space after successfully applying for a first-time home-owner's subsidy. He alluded to the importance of a familiar and comfortable environment with reliable spatial and temporal structure.\n\nParticipants honed rich micro-geographies around their homes. Nicola and Steve (both 85, Eden Prairie) demonstrated their deep residential attachment during the mobile interview. Due to Steve's severe mobility limitation, they provided an interior tour. Steve took frequent breaks in chairs strategically placed throughout the home. They spoke emotionally of treasured belongings, sentimental artwork and family photographs. Their accumulated lives were on display as Steve ‘do[es] more remembering than doing’ these days. He expressed contentment to surround himself with pictures of grandchildren, friends and departed loved ones. Autobiographical insideness (Rowles, Reference Rowles1983) reverberated through Nicola and Steve's mobile interview as they paused frequently to discuss the photographs and memories of the people and places that shaped their lives. Rich cognitive and affective ties to home instilled a sense of identity, purpose and a meaningful life (Kyle and Chick, Reference Kyle and Chick2007; Scannell and Gifford, Reference Scannell and Gifford2010).\n\nParticipants found reasons ‘to get up in the morning’ through routines around their neighbourhoods and broader communities. Sally (67, North Minneapolis) went to great effort to keep busy despite a pinched nerve and diminished mobility. She began organising regular trips on assisted transit after her husband passed away: ‘It helps me keep going. I think now if I didn't do this, I would probably be crippled. Just sitting around doing nothing. I have to get out.’ These efforts helped her maintain a sense of connection and purpose in her local community. Sally and many others stated their reliance on affordable and free activities given limited resources. They particularly appreciated subsidised rates for public transit and recreational amenities.\n\nWalking was a common everyday activity, and therefore a component of residential satisfaction for many participants. Supportive street and neighbourhood elements, as well as nearby destinations (e.g. parks, stores, landmarks), facilitated walking for recreation and utilitarian purposes. Participants with impaired eyesight, hearing and mobility felt more vulnerable to the built environment. They particularly appreciated pedestrian accommodations including longer-timed crosswalks, smooth curb cuts (sidewalk ramps), sturdy handles and railings, ‘skyways’ and covered bus stop shelters. Outdoor activities such as gardening decreased boredom and boosted quality of life. Participants appreciated small-scale features, including pocket parks, shaded benches and local wildlife (e.g. birds, squirrels, deer). Indirect exposure, such as views through a window in the home, offered stimulation and enjoyment – particularly for those with mobility limitations (Finlay et al., Reference Finlay, Franke, McKay and Sims-Gould2015).\n\nEnduring hardship\n\nThose without long-term or autonomous housing could cultivate meaningful routines, connections and place attachment. Iris (68, Downtown Minneapolis), for example, countered her lack of stable housing and unsafe homeless shelter by focusing on her positive connection to the downtown senior centre. Iris travelled there daily to take advantage of the free snacks, socialise with peers, and enjoy a safe and supportive environment. She made friends and appreciated experiences of belonging. When she arrived each day, Iris entered into her community to belong, see, do, help and be cared for (Cutchin, Reference Cutchin2003). The senior centre was a spatial metaphor for home: the enduring place in which Iris felt that she belonged (Imrie, Reference Imrie2004).\n\nDenise (72, Eden Prairie) was distressed that disability following a stroke and limited resources kept her cooped up:\n\nI wish I could get around. I wish I could walk over to [the lake]. I've always done a lot of hiking for vacations. It never dawned on me that I wouldn't be able to drive or walk. That's not fair.\n\nDenise wanted to live in a building with more amenities, services and entertainment; but lack of resources made this difficult or impossible to achieve. She felt unhappy with her residential situation, but did not want to become overly anxious or distressed. Denise instead entertained herself with plants on the windowsill, knitting when her arthritis permitted and mailed books from the local library. She sought out meaningful activity and crafted fulfilling routines in a resilient manner. Denise had a history of frequent moves depending on variable finances and health status. Her set of family photographs and memorabilia carefully moved with her each time. Each environmental change involved a process of transference of being ‘in place’ (Rowles, Reference Rowles, Skinner, Andrews and Cutchin2017): Denise felt ‘at home’ in whatever space (e.g. hospital, nursing home, new apartment) as long as she had these significant objects. In creating place attachment and a sense of home, these cherished objects (and the memories and routines attached to them) were more important than the physical space itself or duration of residence (Aldwin and Igarashi, Reference Aldwin and Igarashi2012; Wahl and Oswald, Reference Wahl, Oswald, Bengtson and Settersten2016). The personal artefacts enabled Denise to feel competent, in control of and personally connected to her living environment despite economic and functional limitations (Cutchin, Reference Cutchin2003; Golant, Reference Golant, Binstock and George2011). Denise determinedly developed ‘at homeness’ (Seamon, Reference Seamon1979) by seeking out comforting and familiar surroundings and objects. They were essential to routine and identity."
