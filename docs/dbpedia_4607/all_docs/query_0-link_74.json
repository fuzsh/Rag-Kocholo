        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nIn Specters of Marx, Jacques Derrida (1994) observes that both Karl Marx and William Shakespeare shared an obsession with specters. He coined a neologism “hauntology,” as opposed to “ontology,” to refer to something that is not present, not real, not there, but that nonetheless enters into and disrupts the closure of whatever is present, real, and there. “Everything begins by the apparition of a specter,” Derrida states, “a specter is always a revenant. One cannot control its comings and goings because it begins by coming back” (4–11, original emphasis). Despite the accusation of mysticism and nihilism usually targeted at Derrida, “hauntology” opens up possibilities to think about time, space, beings, identities, histories and memories as well as many other social, political and cultural issues including globalization (Benedicto, 2008) and nationalism (Anderson 1983). In this chapter, I draw on “hauntology” to discuss the construction of Chinese gay identity in a popular queer online fiction Beijing Story. In doing so, I propose to consider the intersectionality of sexuality, masculinity, and class in contemporary China in the context of globalization and neoliberalism, and assess the role of “queer Marxism” (Liu 2015) in a transnational Chinese context. Beijing Story Published online by “Beijing Comrade” (Beijing Tongzhi 北京同志, pseudonym) in 1996 and adapted as a film titled Lan Yu 藍宇 by Hong Kong director Stanley Kwan 關錦鵬 (born 1957) in 2001, Beijing Story (Beijing gushi 北京故事) is one of the most popular gay novels in mainland China. The story narrates a decadelong romantic and tragic love story between two men in Beijing in the 1980s and early 1990s. At the beginning of the story, the protagonist Lan Yu travels from a small country town to Beijing to attend university. He prostitutes himself to pay for his university tuition and in the process meets his first patron Chen Handong (hereafter Handong). As the son of a retired communist cadre, Handong makes a successful business in international trade through his connections with 4 Haunted Chinese Gay Identity Sexuality, Masculinity, and Class in Beijing Story Hongwei Bao 74 Hongwei Bao government officials. Handong showers money and gifts on Lan Yu, who refuses most of them. They begin to fall in love with each other, yet Handong still maintains sexual relationships with other men and women. It is only after experiencing the Tiananmen Incident in 1989 that Handong realizes how important Lan Yu is to him. Despite this, he still marries a woman and breaks his relationship with Lan Yu. Years go by before they meet each other by chance and Handong, divorced now, tries to resume their relationship. When he is put into jail because of illegal financing, Lan Yu buys him out of prison. As they are prepared to live a happy life together, Lan Yu is killed in a car accident, leaving Handong heartbroken . Years later, Handong remarries and emigrates to Canada, cherishing the memory of Lan Yu. This story has gained great popularity in mainland China’s gay community after its online publication. It was recently translated into English and published in the USA in 2016 under the title of Beijing Comrades (Bei Tong 2016). Both Remy Cristini (2005; 2006) and Loretta Ho (2007) regard this work as representing a “new” literary genre, namely “comrade literature” (tongzhi wenxue 同志文學), and as social commentary, with its tragic ending reflecting “the harsh realities of the gay world in China” (Ho 2007, 63). I am, however, suspicious of whether “comrade literature” as such can be categorized as an independent literary genre, for the narrative structures and techniques of “comrade literature” are not uncommon in classical or modern literary romance. The melodramatic ending of the story is perhaps not so much about “the harsh realities” of China for gay people; rather, it is about how the anonymous author (Beitong, literally “Beijing Comrade”) utilizes conventional narrative strategies of literary romance to develop the story. Many Chinese readers and writers believe that tragedy, closely intertwined with the aesthetics of the sublime, has more literary value (wenxue jiazhi 文學價值) than comedy. In the widespread “high culture fever” in post-Mao China, people usually find a story more convincing and more worthwhile reading when it has a tragic ending. Besides, as Lisa Rofel (1999) suggests, “telling bitterness” (suku 訴苦), or narrating tragic experiences, was one of the most important ways for people in post-Mao China to construct their new subjectivities . Tragic endings in gay fiction, as such, help both the author and reader to imagine a shared identity and community based on their shared experiences and affects in..."
