        "text": "Introduction\n\nWithin mainland China’s HIV epidemic, rapidly increasing incidence rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have drawn deep concern from medical, public health, and nursing researchers. Fifteen years ago, MSM accounted for less than 1% of all newly diagnosed HIV cases in mainland China, but as of September 2018, MSM constituted 22.7% of year-to-date diagnoses (National Center for STD/AIDS Prevention and Control, National Center for STD Control, & Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). National HIV prevalence among MSM is estimated to be 7% (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2019), reaching as high as 10–30% in some regions of mainland China (Chen et al., 2018; Ye & Giri, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). Consequently, regular female sexual partners of men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) are also experiencing elevated risk for HIV infection. These women are referred to as tongqi—a portmanteau of tongxinglian (gay person) and qizi (wife)—and are estimated to be around 14 million in mainland China (Cheng, 2016; Zhu, 2018). As a result of cultural norm expectations that men should get married and have children to pass down their family names, 17–35% of MSM are currently married to women (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016), and the proportion of Chinese MSM who have had female sexual partners is high, ranging from 26% to 40% in the past 6 months and 45% to 70% over a lifetime (Chow, Wilson, & Zhang, 2011; Tao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). Although tongqi are a recognized subpopulation in news coverage and on social media, limited formal research has been done to characterize their HIV risk (Chow, Koo, & Zhang, 2013; Tao et al., 2013).\n\nMany researchers have proposed that tongqi are at an elevated risk for HIV based on the high HIV prevalence among MSM and the frequency of unprotected sexual contact between MSMW and their partners, both male and female (Chow et al., 2013; Pandya, Pandya, Patil, & Merchant, 2012). A meta-analysis indicated that consistent condom usage during anal sex of MSM in mainland China was approximately 44.8% (95% confidence interval: 39.4–50.2) in 2010–2013 (Huang et al., 2015), which is far from the “100% condom use” target set by the Chinese government (Chen, Schillingb, Cai, Wang, & Shan, 2008). Moreover, compared with MSM without female partners, MSMW tend to have a lower frequency of consistent condom use, more frequency of commercial sex and substance use, and a higher HIV infection rate (Davis et al., 2016; Wang, Xu, et al., 2015). Among MSMW, condom usage was 23% with regular female partners during the past 6 months in one study (Chow et al., 2011). This suggests that tongqi are vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because of biological susceptibility as well as social and economic factors, including poverty, low education, gender inequality, and civil rights inequities (Rangel, Tainara, Silva, & Vargens, 2016).\n\nHowever, Chow, Wilson, and Zhang (2012) argued that the HIV risk of tongqi might be overstated. They calculated the relative HIV risk of tongqi using a mathematical model based on published articles on sexual practices between MSMW and their female partners (Chow et al., 2012). The results showed an HIV incidence rate among tongqi of 0.88 per 1,000 person-years (PY), which was much lower than that of HIV serodiscordant couples (5.4/1,000 PY; Chen, Pan, Yang, Xu, & Cheng, 2011) and female sex workers (34/1,000 PY; Xu et al., 2010) in mainland China. However, the major limitation to this conclusion is that only one study (Xiao et al., 2010) reported the frequency of sexual contact, which might lead to an inaccurate estimation of the risk for HIV transmission from MSMW to their regular female sexual partners.\n\nIn 2012, Zhang et al. (2014a, 2014b) conducted an Internet-based survey among tongqi to investigate their quality of life, including marital life, HIV/STI knowledge and infection status, and mental health (Li, Zhang, et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014a, 2014b). The results showed that only 28% of the participants had ever been tested for HIV, and among the study participants (n = 144), two were positive for HIV infection (Zhang et al., 2014b). High levels of mental distress and suicidal ideation were reported (Li, Zhang, et al., 2016). However, without in-depth interviews, it is unclear what factors have affected access to HIV testing and how specific characteristics of their sexual relationships with MSMW may have affected their risk.\n\nMost research studies have assessed the HIV risk for tongqi based on studies conducted from the perspective of MSMW. Very little reliable research has been done to elucidate tongqis’ perspectives on their experiences, their relationships with MSMW, and HIV/STI risk. Thus, this study used an exploratory qualitative research design to understand HIV risk perceptions of tongqi (past or present female partners of MSMW) in mainland China and to describe their relationships and sexual experiences. A clearer understanding of HIV risk for tongqi can inform future HIV/STI prevention strategies and appropriate nursing care for tongqi who are HIV infected.\n\nResults\n\nStudy Participant Characteristics\n\nA total of 24 women from 14 provinces in mainland China participated in this study ( ). Nineteen participants (including one woman living with HIV) were recruited from the online chat group after they saw the posted study flyers and voluntarily contacted the research team. At the time of recruitment, the group had approximately 200 total members and more than 180 active members. Three women living with HIV were referred through a CBO for people living with HIV; all three enrolled in the study. Two participants heard about the study through word of mouth and contacted the study team. No participants were successfully recruited from the HIV clinics.\n\nTable 1.\n\nNo.Age, yearsProvinceHighest EducationCurrent Status With PartnerDuration of Marriage (Years)Number of ChildrenSTI DiagnosisBeen HIV TestedHIV StatusDescription of Partner’s Sexual OrientationPartner’s HIV Status127ACollegeDivorced40NoNo—GayNegative226BMaster’sMarried<1—UnknownNo—GayUnknown332ACollegeMarried50NoNo—GayNegative450CPrimary schoolMarried281NoNo—GayPositive530DCollegeEngaged—0NoYesNegativeGayPositive630ECollegeDivorced<10NoYesNegativeGayNegative748FMiddle schoolMarried241NoNo—GayNegative835GCollegeMarried101Genital wartsYesNegativeGayUnknown966HMiddle schoolMarried412NoYesNegativeGayPositive1043ICollegeMarried151NoNo—GayNegative1131BPrimary schoolMarried11NoYesNegativeGayPositive1242JMiddle schoolMarried173NoYesNegativeGayPositive1330IMiddle schoolDivorced61NoNo—BisexualNegative1432GCollegeDivorced71NoYesNegativeBisexualNegative1527GCollegeMarried11NoNo—GayUnknown1643KMiddle schoolDivorced201NoYesNegativeBisexualPositive1731LCollegeDivorced82Syphilis and pubic liceNo—BisexualUnknown1826LVocational schoolMarried11UnknownYesPositiveBisexualPositive1932MHigh schoolDivorced51NoYesNegativeGayUnknown2040IMiddle schoolMarried131Genital wartsYesPositiveHeterosexualPositive2142IVocational schoolMarried51NoYesPositiveHeterosexualPositive2256IMiddle schoolWidowed301Genital wartsYesPositiveHeterosexualPositive2335NCollegeMarried81NoNo—BisexualNegative2440ECollegeDivorced101GonorrheaYesNegativeGayPositive\n\nThe mean age of the participants was 36 years old, with a range from 26 to 66 years. Sixteen of the participants were married, 6 were divorced, 1 was engaged, and 1 was widowed. The duration of the marriages ranged from 5 months to 41 years with a median of 8 years. Most women (n = 16) described their husbands as gay, whereas 5 women said their husbands were bisexual and 3 women believed their husbands were heterosexual. Fourteen participants had had at least one HIV test before the interview, and four participants self-reported as living with HIV.\n\nSurprise, Initial Disbelief, and Negative Attitudes About Their Husbands’ Same-Sex Sexuality\n\nMost participants reported that their marriages felt uncomfortable, but they could not identify why. None of the participants knew about their husbands’ same-sex sexuality or sexual history when getting married. Participants were particularly surprised when they learned of their husbands’ same-sex behaviors, although they considered their husbands to be a “good man.” Many women expressed negative attitudes toward same-sex sexuality, viewing it as “psychiatric disease” or a flaw in moral character. Some women described themselves derogatorily as “a baby-delivery instrument” or “a fig leaf,” which is a term for a female companion used to conceal a man’s same-sex sexual orientation (similar to a “beard” in English slang).\n\n“I was shocked when I learned he was a gay man. It was difficult for me to believe that.” —No. 22 (56 years old, widowed, living with HIV).\n\n“I felt like I had been totally deceived, and it crushed me. I went crazy. You can’t imagine that year. I jumped off a building, tried to overdose on sleeping pills, drank alcohol, cut my wrists. I tried every way to kill myself. Before every attempt, I wrote a note to my dad. Later he said I was insane.” —No. 12 (42 years old, married, HIV uninfected).\n\nMany tongqi refused to accept their husband’s same-sex sexuality and took proactive steps to maintain or increase the frequency of sex. A common belief was that sexual orientation could be changed with increased heterosexual sex. When they first learned the truth, most tongqi tried many ways to change their husbands’ sexual orientation, including using “traditional medicine,” “Viagra (sildenafil),” “psychological counseling,” “good nutrition,” and “witchcraft.” In order to conceal their same-sex sexuality, many husbands reluctantly accepted the tongqi’s sexual invitations and conversion efforts.\n\n“I didn’t take him being gay seriously. I was always confident that I could change him, like by giving him healthy food and having more sex. I searched online for different sexual positions and tried to improve our sex life.” —No.12 (42 years old, married, HIV uninfected, who knew her husband was gay before she knew he was living with HIV).\n\nThree of the four participants living with HIV—one participant’s husband had already died from AIDS—believed that they had successfully curbed their husbands’ desires to pursue gay sex and that their husbands were heterosexual. These participants supposed that their husbands felt guilty for transmitting the infection to them; for this reason, their husbands tried their best to care for them and to follow their wishes.\n\n“I think he was gay before, but now he is heterosexual … I think [being gay] can be changed, like through psychological counseling or if friends can talk with him and get through to his feelings. Yeah, it can be changed.” —No. 21 (42 years old, married, living with HIV).\n\n“When I found out [about my husband’s gay sex partners], I only had one thought and that was to save him …. After all, for a person to keep on going, yin and yang [the philosophy about balance in Traditional Chinese Medicine] have to be balanced …. But he was getting lost.” —No. 20 (40 years old, married, living with HIV).\n\nParticipants were particularly negative toward a perceived promiscuity among gay men and commented on how often their husbands frequented gay bathhouses:\n\n“They’re not looking for love, just for sex. They only date someone if it’s easy to meet up, and they share photos with each other. Sometimes, multiple men get together for sex. They also use [poppers] and abuse drugs.” —No. 14 (32 years old, divorced, HIV uninfected, learned after reviewing her husband’s chat history on a gay messaging platform).\n\n“He told me he has had sex with men since he was 20 years old, so for almost 50 years. He’s been with many men. He said he is [the bottom], and he loves masculine men and having sex with two men at the same time. He told me that there is a guy at the bathhouse who has had sex with 40 to 50 men.” —No. 9 (66 years old, married, HIV uninfected, male partner living with HIV).\n\nMaintaining Regular Sexual Contact Particularly Before Pregnancy\n\nMany participants said that their husbands tried to maintain an active sexual relationship with them. The primary motivations were to conceive a child or to disguise their same-sex sexuality. The tongqi said that during sex, their husbands would try strategies like asking them to be quiet, closing their eyes to imagine having sex with a man, taking sexual enhancement pills, or looking at gay porn during sex. Tongqi did not enjoy these sexual encounters, but they thought that sex was necessary to fulfill their obligations as wives.\n\n“Before sex, he would never talk to me, touch me, or kiss me. He just inserted himself into my body. It was as if he were checking off a weekly responsibility.” —No. 10 (43 years old, married, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview, describing their sexual activities before she became pregnant).\n\n“Before we married, one of his gay friends persuaded him to keep having sex with me. The friend warned that if he didn’t regularly have sex with me, he would be found out as being gay. ‘So just take a [Viagra] pill and do it!’” —No. 2 (26 years old, divorced, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview, as recorded in her diary).\n\nUnprotected Sex With Marital and Extramarital Partners\n\nMisunderstanding about condom use for HIV/STI prevention was common. Most couples did not use protection, regardless of whether conception was the primary motivation for sex.\n\n“We never used condoms because we thought it wasn’t necessary for couples” —No. 20 (40 years old, married, living with HIV).\n\n“I’ve heard of condoms, but I don’t know much about using them. I never use them. I’ve never thought about this seriously.” —No. 7 (48 years old, married, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview).\n\n“Neither of us liked the feeling of using a condom, so we would usually throw it away during sex” —No. 23 (35 years old, married, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview, knew her husband had been diagnosed with syphilis).\n\nSeveral participants thought condoms were used only to prevent pregnancy rather than for disease prevention, so if they had an intrauterine device, they never needed condoms. Other couples who did not like using condoms would use the rhythm method (fertility awareness) or having the husband pull out before ejaculation.\n\n“I never knew that we could use condoms to prevent diseases. I thought condoms were used just for avoiding pregnancy” —No. 11 (31 years old, married, HIV uninfected).\n\n“I thought we didn’t need condoms because I had an intrauterine device”—No. 22 (56 years old, widowed, HIV positive).\n\n“He doesn’t like to use a condom, so he just finishes outside of me”—No. 18 (26 years old, married, HIV positive).\n\nFor tongqi who were unhappy with their sexual relationships with their husbands, it was not uncommon to seek extramarital partners for sex and for emotional intimacy. They usually did not use condoms with these partners. They tended to believe their intuition that they had found a good and healthy man.\n\n“There are many tongqi who go out looking for sex [with other men]. Just among the tongqi I know, three of them still maintain their legal marriage but also have other [extramarital] partners.” —No. 8 (35 years old, married, HIV uninfected).\n\n“I would break down if I did not have my boyfriend. We don’t use condoms because I am sure he is a good person, not promiscuous, and can be trusted” —No.16 (43 years old, divorced, HIV uninfected).\n\nIn some cases, tongqi’s relationships with extramarital partners were encouraged by their husbands.\n\n“Initially, I just needed an escape from the despair [from finding out about my husband] so I searched for another man. My husband didn’t accuse me of anything and seemed to encourage me to go out and date. I like the feeling of having sex with other men because it makes me feel like a woman … I don’t use condoms with these men.”—No. 12 (42 years old, married, HIV uninfected).\n\nLow Perception of HIV Risk\n\nAlthough the majority of participants were at some risk of acquiring HIV, most were unaware of that risk. Among the 24 participants—most of whom had already received some informal HIV education and counseling through the tongqi’s online chat group—only 14 had ever had an HIV test before their study interview. Among those who had not been screened for HIV, the most common explanation was simply that they had never thought about the need to be tested. Participant No. 10 (43 years old, married, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview) had sex 1–4 times per month during the first 3 years of marriage. After she became pregnant, she stopped having sex with her husband. She had not had an HIV test prior to the study, explaining: “Even though my husband is gay, I haven’t had any risk of getting HIV and I never will.”\n\nParticipants’ estimation of their HIV risk was usually low. Many had inaccurate HIV-related knowledge, including not knowing that there is rising HIV prevalence among MSM and not knowing how HIV can be transmitted or prevented. Because they did not perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV, they did not seek out testing. Participant No. 21 (42 years old, married) was living with HIV and said she believed AIDS was “very horrible.” Before she was diagnosed with HIV, she thought HIV and STIs could be transmitted through indirect contact:\n\n“For example, I never took the seat right after a person stood up on a bus because the seat would still be warm from their body heat. I thought HIV or STIs could be transmitted through the warm seat.”\n\nBefore participants learned of their husbands’ same-sex sexual history, they had no suspicions that they were at risk of an HIV/STI. This was especially true for the participants who had frequent sexual contact with their husbands, which included the four participants living with HIV.\n\n“He didn’t attract women, and he didn’t flirt, so I never thought about HIV/AIDS before he came out” —No. 22 (56 years old, widowed, HIV positive).\n\n“I felt like something was abnormal about him. He showed no interest in women and wasn’t a promiscuous man, so I never thought that I could get a sexually transmitted disease.” —No. 8 (35 years old, married, HIV uninfected, had been diagnosed with genital warts).\n\nAmong the participants who had an understanding of the HIV/STI risk from unprotected sex, this knowledge did not consistently translate into behavior change or correlate with the frequency of intramarital sex. These participants prioritized the pressure to have children and accepted the accompanying health risks. With their husbands, they would use condoms except when trying to conceive. Participant No. 17 (31 years old, divorced, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview) was typical of this subgroup; she used condoms almost every time except when planning to become pregnant. She saw no need for an HIV test, saying, “I could not get infected since we used condoms almost all of the time.”\n\nAnother reason for overlooking the HIV risk and not seeking HIV testing was the overriding aim to change their husbands’ same-sex sexuality as discussed above.\n\n“Getting tested is not important to me. I would prefer to get infected if having more sex with him could help him change his sexual behaviors. Compared to getting infected, changing his sexual orientation is more important to me.” —No. 13 (30 years old, legally divorced but still living with her husband, had not had an HIV test prior to the study interview). She maintained regular frequency of sex with her husband without condoms for 3 years after learning that her husband had male sexual partners.\n\n“When I found out [about my husband’s gay sex partners], I didn’t know then that he and I were both already HIV-infected.” Three months after learning of her husband’s same-sex sexuality, she was diagnosed with HIV after a screening during prenatal care. “Afterwards, I was able to save him. I changed him [to being heterosexual], so we are getting along well now.” —No. 20 (40 years old, married, HIV positive).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis qualitative study is among the first to directly address tongqis’ attitudes toward same-sex sexuality, sexual experiences, and potential HIV risk. In mainland China, the tongqi population is estimated to be 14 million (Cheng, 2016; Zhu, 2018). Among our 24 participants, there was a wide variety of emotions felt and actions taken after they found out about their husbands’ sexual contact with other men and/or HIV-positive status. Some women stopped having sex with their husbands, but many women strove to maintain regular sexual contact to fulfil perceived societal roles and familial duties—most importantly, having children or to “change” their husbands’ sexual orientation. A previous qualitative interview study of married MSMW in mainland China identified similar themes to those identified in this study (Wang, Song, et al., 2015). Because mainland China’s HIV epidemic is worsening among MSM (Cui et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014), we were particularly interested in tongqis’ understanding of HIV transmission, perceived HIV risk, and history of HIV testing. Because this population is hard to access, very few previous HIV studies have presented the direct words and stories of tongqi.\n\nSexual education is often lacking, and misinformation about safe sex and HIV/STIs is common (Zhang, Ma, Gao, Wang, & Peng, 2018). However, we found that these were not primary factors influencing how tongqi thought about their intramarital sexual lives and their husbands’ sexuality. The most common theme was the pressure to bear children, which was enforced by cues from internal, familial, and societal sources (Liu & Tang, 2014). Due to the social role of women and ethical constraints in the context of Confucian culture in mainland China, women were expected to comply with the childbearing duty of continuing the family line (Jiang & Ye, 2014). Most tongqi in our study had at least some period of regular sexual contact with their husbands in order to conceive. A qualitative interview study also found that MSMW were burdened by social and psychological pressures to marry and raise a younger generation (Wang, Song, et al., 2015). During this period, tongqi are at the highest risk of HIV/STI infection because they are having unprotected sex while not being aware of the transmission risk. In line with the study of Wang, Song, et al. (2015), MSMW maintain infrequent but mostly unprotected sexual behaviors with their female partners; we found that this period of attempting to achieve pregnancy by having condomless sex ranged from several months to several years. Some couples continued a low frequency of heterosexual sex after having children.\n\nHIV risk perception was not a major factor in deciding whether to continue having sexual intercourse with their husbands. Although most of the women in this study were at some risk of acquiring HIV, most had judged themselves to be at no risk. For the 10 participants who had never been tested for HIV before the study, they simply had not considered the need for testing. This result was in line with the low rate of HIV testing of tongqi in the existing literature. A quantitative study based on an Internet-administered questionnaire indicated that only 28% of tongqi had ever had an HIV test (Zhang et al., 2014b).\n\nFor these participants, HIV risk—and by extension, HIV testing—was not a priority compared with having a child or “changing” their husbands’ sexual orientation. Due to the dominance of traditional heterosexual culture, women had insufficient knowledge on homosexuality and related culture, some of them even considered homosexuality as “psychiatric disease” and that it can be changed (Yan, Li, & Zhang, 2016). In mainland China, some literature still reports conversion therapies that attempt to change an individual’s sexual orientation (Beijing LGBT Center, 2014; Yang & Wu, 2015), which exacerbates the women’s beliefs that sexual orientation could be changed. In our interviews, most tongqi initially focused on “changing” their husbands’ sexual orientation, and some believed they succeeded.\n\nHomosexuality in mainland China was decriminalized in 1997, but same-sex marriage is not legal. Many MSM keep their same-sex sexual history hidden from those around them, including their families and female sexual partners (Wang, Song, et al., 2015). There are extremely high personal and social barriers for MSMW to disclosing their HIV serostatus and sexuality (Wang, Song, et al., 2015; Wu, 2016; Zhao et al., 2015); According to 90–90-90 goals (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2014), 90% of all people living with HIV (PLWH) will be aware of their infection by 2020. However, a survey has estimated that only half of MSMW living with HIV in mainland China have disclosed their HIV diagnosis to a regular female partner (Yan et al., 2019) and other MSMW are living with HIV but have not yet been tested and diagnosed.\n\nThe four participants living with HIV in our study all reported having regular ongoing unprotected sex with their husbands who were MSMW living with HIV. This lends some evidence to other studies that suggest that MSMW are a bridging population for HIV/STI transmission from MSM to female sexual partners (Chow et al., 2011). Earlier studies have mathematically calculated the potential transmission risk based on MSMW’s self-reported sexual frequency and unprotected sexual contacts in the most recent 6 months (Friedman et al., 2016; Ruan et al., 2014). There was little evidence to support viral bridging hypotheses in the study of Friedman et al. (2016), whereas Ruan et al. (2014) found that 3.4% of MSM in Chongqing and Beijing would have the potential to transmit HIV to their female partners. This estimation strategy might understate the potential transmission risk because it does not differentiate the periods before and after pregnancy.\n\nAmong our participants, most believed that condoms were only used as contraception, and condom usage was very low overall. A common belief was that it is not necessary to use condoms with a spouse or other regular sexual partners. This is further evidence that condom use is not normalized in mainland China in the general population (Liu et al., 2014), which contributes to the high proportion (approximately two-thirds) of new HIV cases in mainland China transmitted through heterosexual sex (National Health and Family Planning Commission, 2015). Other antipregnancy methods were often preferred including using intrauterine devices, ejaculation outside of the body, and the rhythm method (fertility awareness). Extramarital sex also contributes to HIV infection risk. This study and our 2012 Internet-based survey among tongqi (Li, Zhang, et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014a, 2014b) has shown that a significant proportion of women had unprotected extramarital sex; in our quantitative online survey, this proportion was one third (Zhang et al., 2014b).\n\nIdentifying and recruiting tongqi for health research and interventions is extremely challenging because of their marginalization and invisibility. The participants in our study were very concerned about data security and personal privacy; breaches of confidentiality would likely bring secondary stigma on themselves and their families. Moreover, it is even more challenging to recruit tongqi living with HIV. Although we disseminated recruiting information to three HIV clinics, we received no referrals through this system. Although there were most likely tongqi living with HIV receiving care at these clinics, they did not want to be identified or did not know they were tongqi. We also suspect that tongqi living with HIV are less likely to be socially connected to tongqi social groups because they are more likely to be having regular sex with their husbands; thus, they could be less likely to know of their husbands’ same-sex sexual history. Tongqi living with HIV also experience dual burdens of stigma, which may reinforce a reluctance to join either a tongqi or an HIV support group. We agree with the statement of Chow et al. (2013) that “paradoxically, by no means can Chinese health stakeholders know about the epidemic in tongqi, if this population are not even identifiable by themselves”.\n\nGiven the nature of this population, innovative strategies must be implemented in order to deliver any interventions. We suggest that the Internet is a reasonable starting point for recruitment and information delivery because there are already several self-organized online spaces for tongqi. Because of mainland China’s extremely high levels of online engagement in the general population, these existing spaces are a social nexus for women who are looking for others who identify as tongqi. The participants who were recruited from the online chat group mentioned that they had learned about HIV risk and knowledge from others in the group. This could be a natural entry point for a more rigorous and comprehensive educational module designed by trained HIV counselors and health care providers because many participants still had incomplete or inaccurate knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention.\n\nFor women who self-identify as tongqi, there are opportunities to provide psychological counseling, marital counseling, and safe sex education interventions (including condom use promotion). Most critically, HIV testing should be strongly encouraged and made easily accessible. It should be emphasized to couples affected by HIV that by adhering to antiretroviral treatment and achieving undetectable viral loads, the risk of transmission to a partner or to a child is functionally nil. Nearly all participants in our study had children with their husbands, and some participants were exposed to HIV while trying to conceive.\n\nWe strongly urge that in order to avoid exacerbating existing levels of homophobia, any interventions for tongqi should be designed and conducted with close input from MSM CBOs and/or LGBT health researchers. We also think that HIV/STI prevention interventions for tongqi would be most likely to succeed if done in tandem with similar campaigns for MSMW. General public education campaigns to reduce homophobia are needed, although broader cultural forces and social politics limit the feasibility and potential effectiveness of such campaigns.\n\nAs discussed above, the main limitation of our study is that by definition, we could only access and recruit women who were aware of their tongqi status, willing to talk openly about their relationships with researchers, and connected to other tongqi. This results in selection bias. In our study, the majority of participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling methods through one primary source, the online QQ chat group. Moreover, we did not interview the tongqi participants’ male partners, so we cannot describe their experiences and perceived HIV risk, and we are not able to externally validate our participants’ responses. We also did not purposively recruit women in so-called lavender marriages between self-identified lesbian women and gay men (Zhu, 2018). These marriages may have some similarities to the marriages we describe (e.g., engaging in heterosexual intercourse in order to conceive). Finally, Finally, this qualitative study could not quantify HIV risk, and any descriptions of experienced risk are based on self-report of unprotected sex."
