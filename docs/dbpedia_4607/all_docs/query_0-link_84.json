        "text": "Tze-lan Deborah Sang's teaching and research focus on modern Chinese literature and visual culture. Among her major publications is The Emerging Lesbian: Female Same-Sex Desire in Modern China (Chicago, 2003), which traces the rise of a new system of sexuality in twentieth-century China. Examining changing epistemes and conceptual paradigms of same-sex desire, the book argues that sexuality became organized around the homosexual/heterosexual binary--of which the woman-preferring woman was a critical, contested link--in urban Chinese cultures beginning in the early twentieth century. By closely examining fiction, the mass media, popular medical discourse, and feminist and queer identity movements, the study details the localization, in the Chinese-speaking world, of global regimes of sexual knowledge and disciplines of the self. Another book, Documenting Taiwan on Film: Issues and Methods in New Documentaries (Routledge, 2012), is the first full-length study in Western languages on nonfiction film from Taiwan. Sang's current research focuses on three areas: 1) the Chinese \"modern girl\" discourse in the first half of the twentieth century, situating it in a transnational context; 2) Chinese cinema—especially independent documentary films—from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China; and 3) representations of postindustrial cities. Her research has appeared in journals such as GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Studies in Documentary Film, Chinese Literature Today, Frontiers of Literary Studies in China, China Information, 《當代》(Contemporary), and《視界》(Horizons) and numerous edited volumes.\n\nSang's research has received support from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation. She taught at Stanford University and the University of Oregon prior to joining Michigan State University. She has also held a faculty appointment at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nBesides research and teaching, she enjoys creative writing.《時光膠囊》(Time Capsules: Selected Poems of Tze-lan Sang), comprising over a hundred poems written before and during the pandemic, was published in Taipei in 2021 and won Honorable Mention at the Awards for Overseas Works in Chinese 海外華文著述獎佳作 in 2022.\n\nTYPICAL COURSES\n\nIndependent Chinese Documentaries\n\nIntroduction to Chinese Culture\n\nModern Chinese Literature and Film\n\nThe Chinese New Woman and Modern Girl in a Global Context\n\nIssues in Modern Chinese Studies\n\nGender and Sexuality in Modern China\n\nFilm and Literature from Taiwan\n\nIntroduction to Taiwan Studies\n\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\nBooks:\n\nThe Emerging Lesbian: Female Same-Sex Desire in Modern China.
