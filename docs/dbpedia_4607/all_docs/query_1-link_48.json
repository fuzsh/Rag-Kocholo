        "text": "3This special issue of Sextant seeks to further this interdisciplinary effort, looking not only at geographical margins (Hong Kong, Guizhou, Xinjiang) in the strict sense, but also at physical and intangible spaces that have been understood as marginal by a variety of actors. The six articles of this issue take us on a journey which starts from the political margins of China in Hong Kong to diasporic Chinese communities of Mexico City’s popular markets, from alternative spaces within mainstream Internet platforms to underground bars within the capital heartland of Beijing, and back to the geographical frontiers of the PRC in Guizhou and Xinjiang. In the same movement, these articles reach beyond margins in their strict geographical sense: to varying degrees, they examine gender with attention to its intersections with age, religion, race, ethnicity, class, labour, and linguistic differences. In the first article, Gina Marchetti uses a case study of two films by female Hong Kong filmmakers, Ann Hui’s A Simple Life (2011) and Flora Lau’s Bends (2013), to unpick how class, age and gender intersect to entrench the precarity of cross-border lives in the special administrative region. The second article by Ximena Alba Villalever follows another group of migrants to the peripheries of the overseas Chinese diaspora in Mexico. Villalever analyses how cultural constructions of gender and race are used by Chinese migrant women workers in Mexico’s markets to resist the precarity of their marginal position and build allyship with Mexican women merchants in a male-dominated business world. Moving from the diaspora to the online world, Fan Wang’s article explores how online publishing platforms have provided space for fiction that centers non-normative gender roles, including matriarchal fiction, and the ambiguous relationship they maintain with market capitalism and state regulations. Blurring gender binaries further, Liu Yilong explores embodied queer experiences of sex, happiness, and precarity through the lens of Qiu Jiongjiong’s Madame (2010). Their night scenes of crossdressing performers in Sanlitun’s pubs bring us to the spatial undergrounds that lay within the geographical heartland of Beijing, and to the peripheries of mainstream socio-cultural norms. Finally, we come to the geographic frontiers of the PRC and the sometimes-fraught relationships that they entertain with gender, ethnicity, nation, and religion. Drawing on rich archival sources, Steven Pieragastini explores how state efforts to collectivise agriculture played out along gendered lines in Guizhou in the 1950s. For the same time period, Arianne Ekinci explores the CCP state construction of “modern” Uyghur women subjects through the case study of a former illiterate shepherdess turned model Chinese-speaking proletarian secular performer, hailing from Hotan, Xinjiang.\n\nThe Margins of China Through Interdisciplinary Perspectives\n\n7And yet, one cannot be endlessly relativist and follow the frequent exceptionalist postulation that China absolutely cannot be discussed in certain terms because China would be somehow incommensurably “different”. The dynamics of marginalisation that are at play when projecting that quintessential “Other” smack of Orientalism and share similar dynamics to the kind of power relations that intersectional scholars are trying to unpack. We are ourselves scholars from white and Han middle-class backgrounds working in privileged institutions and academic fields which have, only in recent decades, started to come to terms with their colonial roots. As such, we have witnessed the historical tendency that the study of “China” should stay tightly snug within sinology or area studies departments, in a way that has made it difficult for many of us to engage with our colleagues in history, literature, or gender studies. While the issue is structural, we are nevertheless particularly grateful to Sextant, a generalist gender and sexuality journal, for having welcomed us within its pages and pushed through to build up dialogue.\n\nIntersectionality in the Chinese Context\n\nWhere the Margins of China Lie\n\n13Global market forces have a role to play in shaping where the margins of China lie. Marchetti reveals how Hong Kong, once a hub of global trade, has since its return to the PRC in 1997 become increasingly overshadowed by new powerhouses of trade and commerce across the border in Shenzhen. Hong Kong residents are at the mercy of the vagaries of their mainland business partners as well as shifting state policies at the internal border. People can often “fake it” in such rapidly changing circumstances, moving from the centre to the periphery of class, wealth, and gender norms with dizzying speed. This is illustrated in the roller-coaster life story of Anna the housewife in Flora Lau’s 2013 film Bends, who rises from humble origins and is then pitched into a dramatic decline in fortunes as she is abandoned by her husband. Neo-liberal capitalism has also resulted in the feminization of migration patterns, in the movement of Chinese women to Mexico, or in the flow of female domestic labour to Hong Kong. Marchetti’s insight that “women negotiate borders differently,” could also be applied to Villalever’s article that highlights how women hailing from different regions of China and speaking different languages have negotiated their positions as transnational agents, but also as marginal outsiders in Mexico’s informal economy.\n\n14The margins are therefore essentially porous and precarious zones in themselves, and their contours and visibility are circumscribed by the caprices of the State. This is particularly the case in Pieragastini’s article where rapidly shifting policies towards private land ownership of bride lands in the 1950s had a seesawing effect for minority women, rendering them at the mercy of local and national cadres powerplay. Who gets to speak for and from the margins is also controlled by the State. A similar power dynamic is at work in Ekinci’s work, where former shepherdess Shalamaiti is made to speak with the voice of the State in her stage performances of Uyghur women’s new subjectivity, thus enacting her transformation from “helpless victim” of a supposedly “backward patriarchy” to enlightened and productive State subject. Those who are empowered by the centre to speak “for” and “from” the margins accordingly face a double process of marginalization and self-erasure: they must conform to the narrative of the paternalist centre in order to be made visible and able to speak.\n\n15Some articles allow us a fragmentary peep inside the margins from the perspective of those living there. The articles highlight the affective and embodied impacts of life on the margins. In Liu’s article we are allowed a view into the embodied emotional effects of precarity on the queer identity construction of both Fan Qihui and their drag-queen stage persona Bilang de Linphél, as presented in Qiu Jiongjiong’s 2010 film Madame. Marchetti’s article highlights the physical toll pushed onto gendered labouring and aging bodies within Hong Kong’s underfunded public healthcare system. Women’s bodies on public display in Mexico’s informal markets are subjected to sexualization and harassment in Villalever’s work. The health, labour and reproductive potential of minority women’s bodies come under state interference and are subject to campaigns in both Pieragastini’s and Ekinci’s contributions. And while the inner world of the twirling Shalamaiti who performs her ‘modern gendered Uyghur identity’ on stage remains unknown, the reader wonders what the affective impact is on Shalamaiti as her body becomes both a site of precarity and the promise of a better tomorrow.\n\n16Negotiating the precarity of life on the margins and its embodied affects, is also a concern of this issue. As Marchetti highlights, those living in such rapidly changing circumstances must have a “chameleon-like” ability in order to survive. Mutual dependency and trust are also key power dynamics at play as actors negotiate their marginal existences. Villalever uncovers a relationship of mutual dependency and allyship between Chinese and Mexican women in the informal economy in Mexico City, in which the main ingredient for success is mutual trust. While Marchetti also illustrates relationships of mutual dependency at many levels, such as that between Hong Kong and China, in which the main feature is mutual suspicion, the power dynamics that they entail are also made clear. Intersections of class, age and gender create mutual dependencies between Roger and her employer Ah Tao in Ann Hui’s 2011 film A Simple Life. However, Roger’s emotional dependency on Ah Tao can be seen as less existential than that of Ah Tao’s economic dependency on Roger, without whom she would not be able to pay for her care. Meanwhile Shalamaiti’s career as a Uyghur performer is absolutely dependent on the paternalism of the state in Ekinci’s article.\n\n17As such, all of the articles highlight the exclusions, but also at times the possibilities, that being on the margins of China represent. In Gina Marchetti’s work, the relative marginality of Hong Kong women filmmakers within their industry both exclude and empower them. They work from a place of relative privilege in contrast to the workers they depict despite their own marginalisation within the film industry, and use this privilege partly to tell others’ stories, partly for their own advancement. They rely on guanxi in their productions, but also use their cross-border positions, networks, mastery of the English language, and fewer travel restrictions to benefit from the cosmopolitanism of Hong Kong society and get access to global networks and audiences. In Ximena Alba Villalever’s work, Chinese women in Mexico also benefit from their position as interlocutors who have access to transnational networks, while they remain in positions of vulnerability as women and visible foreigners in the often violent, male dominated world of the informal economy. In both Steven Pieragastini and Arianne Ekinci’s work, minority women benefit from their exclusion from state campaigns and control: minority women are able to keep a higher proportion of their bride lands for private cultivation before the Great Leap Forward, and Uyghur women of the early PRC who manage to go beyond the reaches of the state’s view also move beyond its control. On the other hand, this invisibility means that they are excluded from access to state benefits including healthcare.\n\n18Taken together, these articles reveal how the constantly fluid constellations of gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity continue to define and circumscribe the margins of China, yesterday and today. We learn of the extent to which marginal identities can empower, while they simultaneously exclude, and how the affective bodily experience of living on the peripheries is negotiated through layers of mutual dependency, the ability to adapt, transform and perform according to continually changing state and market demands that is crucial to survival in these precarious spaces. In the process of construction of the margins in China, questions remain about the locus of power. If, as scholars of postcolonial history have taught us, the centre and the periphery are mutually constitutive, where and how do the peripheries of China impact on the identity formulations of a male, heteronormative Han-Chinese centre? And, in final analysis, what does the experience of precarity in China, constructed through these intersections of class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality tell us about the ways in which state-sponsored Chinese nationalism has flexed itself to subsume and appropriate the voice of the margins, for its own ends?"
