        "text": "Brittany Clottey\n\nContemporary Political Thought, Spring 2022\n\nOn January 9th, 2022, 17 residents of the New York City borough of the Bronx were killed in a fire that suffocated an apartment complex known as the Twin Parks North West[1]. Nine of the victims killed in this fatal accident were children and almost all of them came from West African countries[2]. According to the New York Daily News, this tragic event was due to a space heater malfunction that spread through an open door and across several apartments within the complex. Although the smoke detectors rang furiously, this alarm was ignored, due to the series of false alarms that residents knew to ignore; a common occurrence that took place frequently as a result of poor electrical maintenance. The mayor of NYC, Eric Adams was quick to blame the tenants, stating: “If we take one message from this …Close the door. Close the door. Close the door.” But this wasn’t the fault of the tenants that occupied the apartment building. Throughout the winter, several tenants have complained about the lack of heat in the apartment complex. Over the years, more than six violations have been placed on the building by New York’s department of housing preservation and development[3]. As a result, the tenants took it into their own hands to purchase a space heater to keep them warm during New York’s harsh winter season; and due to a broken self-closing door,[4] -a fault of poor maintenance- the fire spread furiously throughout the apartment complex.\n\nThis infrastructural neglect is a serious issue that is unfortunately not unique to the Bronx. In addition to the crumbling infrastructure, food deserts and inaccessible modes of transportation are also phenomena that have become significant features of poor urban communities. Black and Brown communities have been demanding healthy and safe living environments across the United States, and whether it be a lack of government funding or politicians with capitalistic stakeholders, legislators are willful to neglect these communities. This willful neglect affects the livelihood and well-being of the residents, oftentimes leading to devastating and deadly situations like the Bronx fire.\n\nUsing Achille Mbembe’s concept of necropolitics, we can begin to understand why such communities are neglected. A historian and philosopher, Mbembe defines necropolitics as the ability of a state (or nation) to kill, allow to live, and/or expose to death[5]. With necropolitics, Mbembe offers an insightful analysis of the tactics partaken by the state to get rid of unwanted populations. And in the case of the Bronx fire, as well as other contemporary issues in the United States like the Flint water crisis and the influx of police brutality over the last few decades, jurisdictions have flexed their necropolitical muscle. With Mbembe’s theoretical framework it is revealed how poorly managed urban communities experience a form of passive necropolitics in which lack of funding and infrastructural neglect indicates the state’s unwillingness to care for its residents, allowing them to die.\n\nIn addition to poor maintenance of infrastructure, food deserts are also another example of this passive form of necropower embedded within the structure of urban populations. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a food desert is an environment where a significant number or at least one-third of a population lives “one-half mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area.”[6] They have become a growing concern within the United States, disproportionately affecting Black and Brown communities. Often within poor urban populations, access to healthy and nutritional food exists miles from their homes, and smaller convenience stores lack a robust menu of options. In addition, the income per capita in poor urban communities makes food shopping in major supermarkets unaffordable[7]. In an article written by NY City Lens, journalist Paroma Soni interviews several residents of the Bronx community, who’ve been experiencing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. She interviews Janet Clark, a single mother of 5, who states that it is more accessible to buy groceries at a deli than it is to access expensive supermarkets which are over 7 blocks away from her neighborhood[8]. The unwillingness of the state to provide access to nutritious food can have long-lasting effects on the health of these communities, making them at risk of developing long-term health conditions like diabetes[9], which Janet was recently diagnosed with.\n\nIn addition to food and healthcare insecurity, there exists another layer of necropolitical power that engages with the space and location of these urban populations. How these neighborhoods are physically arranged are essential to the food and healthcare insecurity they experience. Mbembe describes this spatial arrangement as the state of exception, a strategic tactic of necropolitical power where the state of law and judicial order is suspended.[10] Within this spatial arrangement, the political legislators have the ability to enact total sovereign rule and control over its inhabitants. This includes limiting access to resources that affect their livelihood. Although Mbembe focuses on instances of direct violence on colonized lands such as African colonization and the occupation of Palestine when describing the state of exception,[11] it is a framework that can be applied to the makeup of urban landscapes. According to Medical News Today, “many food deserts also provide limited or unaffordable healthcare services. This contributes to negative health outcomes for people living in these areas.” The spatial arrangement that urban communities occupy limits their access to necessary services vital for their well-being, leaving them with limited options to care for themselves and their families.\n\nMbembe’s assessment of the present-day necropolitical occupation of Palestine demonstrates how sovereign states enact violence on those within the Global South. The spatial arrangement of US urban populations is akin to the territorialization of Palestine as Mbembe describes. According to Mbembe, territorialization is the process of organizing a territory and producing artificial boundaries and borders around certain populations of people. The act of territorialization establishes hierarchies and affects the distribution of resources[12]. Like Palestine, urban populations are subjected to this territorialization through legislation like redlining, which is the illegal practice of denying entry to certain neighborhoods based on racial discrimination[13]. Redlining pushes Black and Brown people out of communities that have access to necessary resources like the healthcare facilities and supermarkets aforementioned. Although redlining can take many forms, it is an aspect of territorialization that establishes spatial boundaries and zones that enables states to enact sovereignty over these populations.\n\nThe necropolitics of Black and Brown life in America is a serious and critical investigation and is oftentimes ignored due to its unrecognizable, yet violent characteristics. The establishment of food deserts, the willful negligence of crumbling infrastructure, and the racialized territorialization of land are all methods of necropolitical power present in the United States. Our inability to reckon with the destruction of these populations may be because we view poor urban neighborhoods as isolated instances of underfunding, which can be simply solved through active legislation and better policies. However, necropolitics brings us closer to uncovering the intentionality behind these acts. Through this lens, it becomes revealed to us that the treatment of these urban populations is state-sanctioned, and occupies a similar social situation to other populations in the Global South, who have been subjected to colonial rule. Let us not write off the treatment of urban populations as an issue of policy making. Instead, positing the mistreatment of urban populations as an intentional act of sovereignty allows us to take these issues seriously, and pushes us to fight for better legislation that diminishes the state’s ability to rid these populations completely.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1]Hernández, Diana. “Heat, Housing and the Horrific Bronx Fire.” New York Daily News, 14 Jan. 2022,\n\n[2]Westhoff, Kiely, and Alaa Elassar. “New York Mayor Signs Fire Safety Order after Fatal Bronx Fire.” CNN, Cable News Network, 20 Mar. 2022\n\n[3]“Why Is New York City’s Mayor Blaming Tenants for the Deadliest Fire in Decades? | Ross Barkan.” The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 13 Jan. 2022\n\n[4]Sommerfeldt, Chris. “NYC Law Mandating Self-Closing Doors in the Spotlight after Fatal Bronx Building Blaze.” New York Daily News, 11 Jan. 2022\n\n[5] Mbembe, “Necropolitics,” 12\n\n[6]Food Access Research Atlas.” USDA ERS – Food Access Research Atlas\\\n\n[7]“Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food Is Limited in ‘Food Deserts.’” USDA ERS – Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food Is Limited in “Food Deserts”\n\n[8]Soni, Paroma. “How the Bronx Is Fighting Food Insecurity during a Pandemic.” NY City Lens, 8 Jan. 2022\n\n[9]“Food Deserts: Definition, Effects, and Solutions.” Medical News Today, MediLexicon International\n\n[10] Mbembe, “Necropolitics,” 13\n\n[11] Mbembe, “Necropolitics,” 24\n\n[12] Mbembe, “Necropolitics,” 26\n\n[13]Weintraub, Elizabeth. “Redlining.” The Balance\n\nHayden Ventrella\n\nContemporary Political Thought, Spring 2022\n\n“Man dies after setting himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court,”[1] reads the CBS headline of an article that glosses over an extremely important event on Earth Day, April 22, 2022. Wynn Bruce, a Buddhist climate activist, set himself on fire in an act reminiscent of the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk protesting the persecution of Vietnamese Buddhists in 1963.[2] As the article provides no insight into Bruce’s actions, Kirtee Kanko, a Buddhist priest, and friend of Bruce, took to Twitter to explain the context of his self-immolation: “This act is not suicide. This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to [the] climate crisis.”[3]\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon that requires immediate radical local and global action. The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, released on April 4, 2022, paints a grim image of our future at the current rate of action: “Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced prior to COP26 [26th annual Convention of the Parties] would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius during the 21st\n\ncentury.”[4] Simply put, climate change mitigation efforts after the year 2030 will not prevent global warming from exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius that is expected to effect irreversible climate consequences. The Paris Climate Agreement, enacted in 2016, set the global goal to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and it is this goal that is no longer achievable without extremely radical action within the next seven years.\n\nUnfortunately, global climate agreements like the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an agreement to convene annually for the Conference of the Parties (COP) to discuss mitigation efforts, have zero enforcement power over the countries in the agreement. There is no legal requirement for countries to meet the goal of their NDCs, nor punishment for failing to meet these NDCs. This forces the people of the world to rely on each country’s desire to maintain positive international reputations relating to mitigation efforts as the enforcement mechanism—which is discouraging as it has become increasingly clear that reputations relating to climate change are insignificant to top emitting countries. China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan, the top five emitting countries that make up 58.41%[5] of global carbon emissions, continue to emit at the highest rates with no consequence other than countless extreme climate deaths they are ensuring for the world.\n\nThis power over the life and death of every person on earth lying in the hands of these five countries is what Achille Mbembe, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand, describes as necropower. Necropower identifies the “ultimate expression of sovereignty” for the state as the “power and capacity to dictate who may live and who must die.”[6] The intentional perpetuation of, and the inaction in addressing, climate change by the countries mentioned above is an exertion of necropower which expands beyond the territorial definition of sovereignty as climate change is a global phenomenon. The lack of climate mitigation efforts from these top five countries is an extremely blunt dictation of “who must die” by extreme climate death in the present and future; and, often, the who of “who must die” is the people of the Global South where extreme climate events are more frequent and many of these countries lack the resources and adaptive infrastructure to withstand these events.\n\nThe catalyst for state action is the people; the people become that catalyst through protest. Global climate protest, however, has continuously failed to produce much meaningful action from these top five countries. Here, we need to look toward bell hooks’ “Killing Rage: Militant Resistance,” in which she argues that the struggle for Black liberation requires the movement to recognize its anger and use that anger in its reaction to and protest of its oppression. We can effectively use hooks’ idea of “killing rage”[7] for the climate protest movement as we view perpetuation and inaction relating to climate change as necropower. hooks’ argument is especially relevant as she explains that the Black liberation movement is justified in using “killing rage” as it is responding to the exercise of necropower by the white supremacist state.\n\nKilling rage is an empowering rage—it empowers the individual to act angrily, yet productively, against necropower. hooks channels her own killing rage into her writing; the climate protest movement can channel its killing rage into consistent, provocative, non-cooperative disruption and coercion. In a 2020 study on the effectiveness of climate protest, sociologist Dylan Bugdan found that peaceful protest and civil disobedience are complementary in raising public support for climate policy.[8] The Scientist Rebellion provides incredible examples of the killing rage protest needed: in November of 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow, scientists with the Rebellion occupied a bridge for five hours and glued themselves to a Scottish Power building, both of which resulted in several arrests.[9] Using these tactics of civil disobedience in embracing killing rage exemplifies the kind of provocative action required to effect productive climate progress.\n\nDisruptive, non-cooperative protest empowered by killing rage can be an effective response to this exercise of necropower, but it will require greater participation. Not acting is complicity; embracing your killing rage to take persistent action in whatever ways you are able is resistance. Climate progress requires what Kirtee explained as “deeply fearless act[s] of compassion.” Wynn Bruce set himself on fire in a terrifying coercive act of self-violence, but we shouldn’t have to burn ourselves alive to produce the action we need; yet here we are. Earth does not have to burn. Climate protest needs to get louder, more provocative, and more disruptive, to force global leaders to act.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Victoria Albert, “Man Dies after Setting Himself on Fire in Front of the Supreme Court, Police Say,” CBS News (CBS Interactive, April 24, 2022), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-person-sets-themselves-fire/.\n\n[2] Andrei Tapalaga, “The Monk Who Burned Himself to Death as a Form of Protest,” Medium (History of Yesterday, July 26, 2020), https://historyofyesterday.com/the-monk-who-burned-himself-to-death-as-a-form-of-protest-35008d0ed8e2.\n\n[3] Chris Cameron, “Climate Activist Dies after Setting Himself on Fire at Supreme Court,” The New York Times (The New York Times, April 24, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/us/politics/climate-activist-self-immolation-supreme-court.html.\n\n[4] “WGIII Summary for Policymakers Headline Statements,” IPCC.ch, April 4, 2022, https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/resources/spm-headline-statements/.\n\n[5] “CO2 Emissions by Country,” Worldometer, 2019, https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/.\n\n[6] Mbembe, A.

Sandy Hook had always been in the back of my mind, but I never thought Remington would be held accountable. However, the families were finally able to\n\nexpose Remington’s marketing schemes and gain justice.\n\nI remember, as if just yesterday, sitting in my fourth-grade classroom in Monroe,\n\nConnecticut, just 19 minutes away from me in Sandy Hook Elementary in December of 2012. A 20-year-old named Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people committing one of the deadliest\n\nshootings ever. Having working parents, there was no one to pick me up from school. Still, I watched as my friends went home with their parents. My teacher reassured me that everything\n\nwould be okay. My school went into a complete lockdown. We were surrounded by armed police, concerned there would be a second attack at nearby schools. As I left for school in the afternoon, I was escorted to the buses by armed officers. When my mother finally returned\n\nhome, relief filled our faces when we realized we were both safe.\n\nGuns were a big part of my life over the next few years. Locked doors were implemented in the front of our schools, security checkpoints were created leading to our school, and armed officers were stationed around the premises ready for anything. My middle school was right next to an abandoned school, Chalk Hill, that ultimately was reconfigured to be used by the students of Sandy Hook. As I would walk over to the shared field armed officers would track our every\n\nmoment, and so over time I became numb to seeing guns. Parents in the town were distressed as 12-14 year olds were constantly surrounded by weapons, and everyone was treated as a threat. When we arrived to school, officers would approach us with hands on their guns and would thoroughly interrogate parents before sending them to the next checkpoint.\n\nSince 1970 there have been 1,316 school shootings, and 18% took place after the Sandy Hook tragedy. The families of nine of the Sandy Hook victims argued that Remington marketed the weapons to target people such as Adam Lanza. The Remington gun company ultimately\n\nsettled for 73 million dollars. However, the money was not the main focus of suing Remington, but the desire to make a societal change. Guns companies up until this settlement were protected\n\nby the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). However, the victims’ families were able to use Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law. The Sandy Hook families argued that Remington attempted to reduce risk of dangerous gun use, but instead promoted it. They argued that they suffered a measurable loss because of the result of the unfair and deceptive acts of Remington. Adam Lanza was one of the people Remington targeted. His walls were covered with posters of guns and other military equipment. He spent\n\nhours playing video games such as Call of Duty where he was exposed to such weapons like the ones produced by Remington.\n\nMarketing is a large part of companies. It promotes the new user to purchase the product and existing users to continue purchasing. In today’s generation, because of the desensitization to\n\nguns, younger people often overlook the lethality of such items in marketing. Activision Blizzard, a creator of “Call of Duty,” gives thanks to companies such as Remington. Gun producers, like Remington, use marketing that can be considered unethical. Instead of trying to\n\nprevent young people from being exposed to guns, most of the gun producers see video games as\n\na way of free marketing. One of Remington’s notable brands is called Bushmaster, which is the\n\nbrand of gun Adam used. In one of their AR-15, there was a caption “consider your man card reissued.” Remington plays on the desires of younger males to be seen as masculine, especially\n\nthose who might feel emasculated from bullying at school.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Victims’ families have opened the discussion to how the unethical marketing of products such as guns leads to violence that causes mass trauma. Now that big companies are held accountable for how they market their guns, we have hope that there will not\n\nbe another Sandy Hook. The door has been cracked open into the world of gun marketing now; we must act to protect future lives. I feel a sense of relief knowing that gun control is becoming a\n\nprevalent topic in America.\n\nOlivia Henry\n\nContemporary Political Thought, Fall 2021\n\nWhat makes an “It” bag? For years, the most coveted “It” bags have come from luxury brands like Chanel and Hermes. With price points over 3,000 dollars, how do these brands maintain such intense desirability? Recently, there’s a new “It” bag on the rise: the Telfar Shopping Bag. The bags, which consistently sell-out in minutes, retail for a range of 150-300 dollars. Disruption is built into every aspect of the Telfar Shopping Bag, not necessarily because of the design, which was modeled off of the Bloomingdale’s shopping totes. Instead, Telfar as a fashion house is fundamentally redefining luxury and fashion across the globe. From its establishment in 2005, Telfar has been paving the way for accessible androgenous fashion, representing “black-adjacent, queer-adjacent” consumers.[1] For a bag that is built to maintain accessibility and represent groups that are historically excluded from high fashion, the design has been highly sought after by white communities and companies. The Telfar Bag’s new position as an “It” item has contributed to the recent growth and intense desirability, but it has also had implications for the disruptive nature of the company and its revolutionary ideals. The Telfar Bag represents how Black queer fashion is frequently co-opted and consumed by white audiences, ridding the creative practice of its’ subversive potentials. White consumers ought to hold themselves to a higher standard of interrogation when it comes to Black designs and fashion practices.\n\nOriginally released in 2014, the simple unisex monogram bag has quickly become one of the hottest accessories on the market. The bag itself is a faux leather tote featuring the Telfar logo in a variety of colors. The ubiquitous bags are credited to Telfar Clemens, a Black and queer, self-made designer. The Telfar Shopping Bag has quickly risen to levels of fame similar to that of designers like Virgil Abloh, the creator of fashion house Off-white and former artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s menswear until his recent passing. One thread stands out in both Telfar and Abloh’s rise to fame: “they weren’t supposed to be there.”[2] Telfar previously noted that being a queer, Liberian-American eighteen year old in 2004 trying to establish 100% unisex fashion was trying “to make clothes that do not exist on the market – just as you don’t exist in the world.”[3] As an outsider to the realm of high fashion, Telfar was unintelligible to wealthy white audiences, but as the desire to consume Black culture became more apparent in white spaces, Black independent labels began to see mainstream appreciation.\n\nWhile the brand’s foundation is rooted in “genderless, democratic, and transformative” values, there have been recent discussions about the consequences of a brand like Telfar occupying white spaces. According to Clemens, the design is “about visibility and power,” and the “trend for diversity without change” is something he has attempted to push back against.[4] Some may say the Telfar Bag’s recent growth can be credited to the Buy Black movement, justifying the mass consumption of the bag without the historical recognition. While white audiences may have good intentions regarding uplifting Black experiences and stories, in practice they can have adverse effects on Black resistance and expression. Even if the desire to participate in the Buy Black movement explains the dilution of Clemens’ message, it doesn’t rectify the harm. Clemens has noted his dissatisfaction with the language used to describe Telfar and the lack of authenticity behind representation.[5] Telfar is always used as an example of inclusive brand practices, but there are a plethora of consumers who aren’t interested in becoming more inclusive—they’re interested in the association that comes with owning a Telfar Shopping Bag. Often white activists take over minority movements and confound the messages to be less radical, which can be seen in movements like Buy Black and #BlackOutTuesday. The colloquial name for the Telfar bag, the “Bushwick Birken,” has the direct consequence of associating the bag with symbols of white respectability. Bushwick is a neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City that has been experiencing high levels of gentrification similar to other Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Ridgewood by wealthy and white New Yorkers. Comparing the Telfar to the infamous Birken, a luxury handbag famous for its exclusive nature, is an equally problematic juxtaposition. The likening of Telfar’s designs to products that were always intended for wealthy people strips the Telfar bag of its defining characteristic: its attainability. The role of Telfar as a brand is to sell to common consumers typically excluded from the realm of fashion, not to assert its position as a luxury bag designer. When white and wealthy consumers create images of scarcity and tradition, it’s at the expense of Telfar’s mission. The bag is taking the world by storm because it’s unique in its purposeful accessibility; the design subverts our notion of luxury because it was always meant to be for everyone.\n\nMuch like in bell hooks’ critique of Paris is Burning, white audiences have made a “spectacle” of Telfar’s accessible and subversive design practices and commodified the brand’s values and ideals. The values and ideals behind Telfar’s designs have been removed and watered down. According to the Telfar artistic director, Radboy, the brand turns down sponsors that want to market to the “desire for vicarious black authenticity.”[6] The brand wants to work with companies “that can introduce Telfar to people beyond cosmopolitan centers.”[7] In her essay titled “Is Paris Burning?,” hooks explains the process through which Black ballroom culture and queer experiences were mythologized by Jennie Livingston in the film Paris is Burning. Livingston, a white, gay woman, documents ballroom culture in New York City during the late 80s in her film. hooks critiques Livingston’s production as exploitative because she has no relation to the subject matter as an outsider and does not interrogate her position’s effect on the film. The same process hooks critiques, in which white audiences view Black creativity from an outsider position, contributes to the popularity of Black fashion brands like Telfar and the commodification of their values and designs. This can be seen with the juxtaposition of the Telfar Bag’s new symbol of luxury and scarcity in the fashion industry to Clemens’ foundation of the brand. The fundamental tenets of accessibility and gender nonconformity have been twisted into a watered-down and neutral position, robbing the brand of its subversive nature.\n\nOne of hooks’ central critiques is that Livingston avoids confronting the role of her position as a white woman in the production of Paris is Burning. Avoiding commodification requires “awareness of the way white supremacy shapes cultural production.”[8] There is an understanding that white audiences have the power to determine “what representations of blackness are deemed acceptable, marketable, as well worthy of seeing.”[9] White consumers like Livingston who ignore this understanding and context will always be consuming Black creativity as entertainment from the position of neutral outsiders looking in. hooks writes that the “ability to assume” a position of neutrality “without rigorous interrogation of intent is rooted in the politics of race and racism.”[10] At first, the popularity of Black brands seems deserving and impactful. When white audiences remove the value of the brand and creators from a product, it starts to feel much more divorced and commodified. Purely demonstrative purchases strip Black art of its value while white consumers gain social credibility on the backs of Black artists. It is because of this that white and wealthy audiences who want to participate in up and coming fashion trends or the relevance of Black creativity need to do the necessary interrogation of how their actions are inline with the brand’s values.\n\nAt its core, Telfar is a brand built upon accessibility and approachability. Their motto of “it’s not for you, it’s for everyone” is meant to challenge how fashion has historically been an indicator of luxury and rampant consumerism. While these values may resonate with everyone, white consumers should abandon their sense of neutrality in favor of thoughtful interrogation. The only way to avoid the spectacularization of Black fashion is for white consumers to be cognizant of the long-standing effect they have had on the respectability and acceptance of Black fashion and culture.\n\nReferences\n\nAllaire, C.

Barton-Hanson makes an estimated $1.06 million per month selling sexual photos on the platform. “I know a lot of people who have struggled with body confidence in the past and since doing OnlyFans, they now feel beautiful and it makes them happy.”\n\nFor many women who open an account on the site, the reality Barton-Hanson describes is the reality they go in expecting.\n\nIt’s get-rich-quick without the scheme.\n\nIt’s empowerment without exploitation.\n\nProclamations like these lure in often young and economically vulnerable women, naive to the OnlyFans’ dark underbelly, leading to long-term damage that more nuanced characterizations of life on the platform could prevent. OnlyFans is only one such pornographic social media platform, but its prevalence in the zeitgeist positions it as the perfect lens through which to examine the way we market soft sex work as a means of female empowerment.\n\nThrough OnlyFans, content creators sell photos and other digital services, overwhelmingly pornographic in nature, to subscribers, or “fans.” Subscribers pay any given creator $4.99 to $49.99 per month, providing them access to the creator’s general feed (think Instagram liberated of those pesky adult content restrictions) in addition to messaging privileges with the creator and personalized photo requests. OnlyFans takes a hefty 20% cut of any and all transactions made on their platform, a loss many creators supplement with ‘tips,’ off-platform payments that subscribers make via apps like Venmo for access to even further exclusive content.\n\nBefore March 2020, the platform saw perfectly respectable growth. COVID changed that. Furloughed, hordes of cash-strapped individuals flocked to and set up shop on the site, quintupling the creator count to 1.6 million. Viewers matched creators’ enthusiasm, leading to a 2020 revenue of $400 million, 540% growth in a single year. The appeal of OnlyFans was clear; it combined the entrepreneurial spirit of the gig economy with the convenience of working from home.\n\nNaturally, this staggering growth vaulted OnlyFans to near-ubiquity in the national conversation. Liberal feminists began touting its myriad benefits for women, as most creators identify as female, most subscribers as male. They said it was economically and bodily empowering, a means of raising self-esteem. Proponents of OnlyFans spouted the buzzy aphorism “Sex work is work,” encouraging listeners to set sexual stigma aside and think critically about the actual differences between “normal” work and sex work. Sure, being an OnlyFans creator can put a strain on personal relationships, and clients can be difficult… but are those not the same side effects of the average 9 to 5? If so, what’s wrong with joining up?\n\nWell, the answer is complicated. To clarify, I do not question whether soft sex work is legitimate. Women’s rights to autonomy dictate that they can do anything they like with their bodies, from selling risque lingerie photos to videographed, consensual pornography. Criminalizing sex work doesn’t stop sex work, but it does stigmatize and endanger sex workers by eliminating safe spaces and painting them as criminals.\n\nIssues arise, however, when successful women in the trade market OnlyFans, and sex work by extension, as a fastpass to economic and internal empowerment. These women, often white, often both financially secure and self-secure, hold an incredible amount of influence. By nature of the ‘content creator’ condition, a strong OnlyFans following often goes hand-in-hand with a powerful presence across all major social platforms. As is the case with Megan Barton-Hanson, her OnlyFans following owes itself to her substantial Instagram following from Love Island. Thus, when Barton-Hanson speaks, her message does not only fall upon the ears of her subscribers. It reaches potential creators as well.\n\nWhile promotion of the platform by non-users, such as its male owners, is ethically difficult to navigate, female creators engender in women on the fence about joining a level of trust that non-creators cannot. In “The Problem of Speaking for Others,” author Linda Alcoff warns speakers of prominent social locations against using a single facet of their identity to speak for all those who share it. In the case of OnlyFans, these influential women are the ‘speakers,’and their gender the “facet,” which they use to conflate their experiences on the site with those of the less privileged. When outrageously wealthy creators like Barton-Hanson speak for “other” creators and ambiguously assert that they have found happiness and confidence on the site, they mischaracterize the experiences of many. Alcoff states that “the practice of privileged persons speaking for or on behalf of less privileged persons has actually resulted (in many cases) in increasing or reinforcing the oppression of the group spoken for,” which begs the question; what harms does OnlyFans bring about, and how does this false advertising of empowerment affect groups of a lower social location?\n\nIn terms of economic empowerment, we can’t ignore the financial life raft that OnlyFans possibly provides. Countless creators make more money on OnlyFans alone than in their previous full-time jobs. The recent aforementioned bump in creators however, exacerbated an already all-too-common finding among new users- making a significant income on the site is very very difficult. The average creator takes home about $150 per week, hardly a fortune to quit one’s job over. And for those who do view $150 as a fortune, we must recognize the coercive factors that drive them toward OnlyFans as a lifeline- racism, unequal pay, suboptimal childhood education, and lack of gainful employment with a livable salary- for what they are. For these women, a meager online following is likely, one that’s just as unlikely to lift them up and out of poverty. It’s not as simple as snapping a few photos before bed. Creators often have to buy photography equipment, lingerie, and more to remain competitive in an already saturated market. And investments aren’t just monetary- creators must promote themselves across various social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter, upload constantly and consistently, and heed their subscribers’ incredibly specific requests. It takes time to make real money, time a woman already working a low-paying job may not have.\n\nWhen comparing the fortunes advertised by top creators to the reality of building and maintaining a profitable account, OnlyFans begins to lose its economic luster. The difference between the monetary challenges posed by minimum wage and those posed by OnlyFans is that the latter holds much more negative influence on future employment complications, child custody battles, and housing discrimination. Though this assessment may seem to place more blame on the woman for entering sex work than on an unfair, stigmatizing, puritanical society, women deserve to know the reputational risk they take before entering the world of sex work.\n\nAlthough we should not actively shame women for joining OnlyFans, we should critically evaluate the less quantifiable side of female empowerment, the side that imbues women with heightened love for their bodies. When influential users advertise OnlyFans as a means of self-actualization, this too harms those of a lower social location. In the words of Alcoff, these adverts beget “often, though not always, erasure and reinscription of sexual, national, and other kinds of hierarchies.”\n\nNumerous creators report heightened self-esteem from OnlyFans. There, it matters not if your body diverges from the platonic ideal- someone, multiple someones, will find it attractive enough to want to see it naked. The problem here is that said self-esteem is propped up by the objectifying male gaze, in the form of male financial contribution, and then conferred by that same gaze, time and time again, as one’s platform grows. In this respect, OnlyFans engenders an extrinsic, and therefore not entirely legitimate, brand of self-love.\n\nAlso important to consider is the fact that the type of attention given to these bodies that don’t fit the societal ideal differs from the attention given to those that do. “I have been asked before, ‘Do you do race play?,’ said creator Lena Lolita, offering a sample of messages she received that fetishized her Black identity. Cisgender, white women like Barton-Hanson field subscriber requests relating to every possible sexual fantasy, some of which they choose to turn down. For minorities who are forced to field these same requests in addition to requests relating to a fetishization of their minority identity, that self-esteem boost comes with a reinscription of the degrading, oppressive forces that affect their lives off-platform. Established workers who operate outside of WASP-y beauty ideals, such as curvy, Black creator Wynter Moseley, can afford to reject requests that make them uncomfortable, embracing her body and her identity on her terms. Moseley, however, possessed an online following before OnlyFans. More notably, she is an adult who already felt secure in her body.\n\nFor one key group of OnlyFans hopefuls, we must note the absence of these two factors.\n\nYou have to be an adult to open an account on the platform, but you can also figure out how to cheat the age-screening process long before your eighteenth birthday. On any given day, about ⅓ of Twitter accounts utilizing the hashtag “nudesforsale” belong to minors, and it’s not unreasonable to extrapolate at least a fraction of that finding to the makeup of OnlyFans creators. While these disturbing statistics obviously necessitate more aggressive policing for traffickers and minors on these sites, it also highlights the population most vulnerable to the promise of empowerment, economic or otherwise, through OnlyFans: young girls. Though it’s possible to find success on OnlyFans, literal children’s absorption of the empowerment narrative exemplifies all the ways a user can fall victim to the dark side of the platform outlined above.\n\nWhile we attempt to find the balance between destigmatizing OnlyFans creators and encouraging the de-objectification of women, OnlyFans and its most powerful creators must self-identify with nuanced language, foregoing “empowerment” for “empowerment, but with a high possibility of exploitation.” Before speaking for others, influential creators need to invoke Alcoff’s key question- “will it enable the empowerment of oppressed peoples?” Doing so can save countless women from making a decision that they themselves (as well as a still-puritanical society) may make them regret.\n\nReferences\n\nAlcoff, Linda. “The Problem of Speaking for Others.” Cultural Critique, no. 20, 1991, pp. 5–32., https://doi.org/10.2307/1354221.\n\nBarton-Hanson, Megan. “Megan Barton-Hanson’s Guide to Cleaning Up on OnlyFans.” VICE, 12 May 2021, https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnndj/megan-barton-hansons-guide-to-cleaning-up-on-onlyfans.\n\nBernstein, Jacob. “OnlyFans Reverses Its Decision to Ban Explicit Content.” The New York Times, A.

But when the time finally came to cast my vote, I couldn’t. My mail-in ballot never arrived–even after multiple calls to my county registrar. Thousands of miles from my voting center, I was stuck at home as others went out to vote. Still, I wasn’t missing out on much.\n\nWe typically believe that our right to vote is sacred and that elections are a fundamental part of democracy. Voting decides who sits in office and, by extension, what policies are made. Yet I can hardly argue that my vote would have decided anything–not just because I would’ve cast it in a state that was obviously sending its electoral votes to Joe Biden, but also because it’s unclear if our votes have much influence over policy at all. One widely-cited study found that legislation caters to corporations rather than the public,2 and most Americans agree.3 As philosopher Alexander Guerrero describes, we cannot depend on elections to hold legislators accountable to us. Most Americans lack the capacity or will to keep track of what their representatives do. When Americans know nothing about issues, incumbents can do whatever they want–including catering to powerful corporate interest groups–without fear of facing repercussions at elections. Furthermore, even if voters did want to vote out an incumbent, they often lack good alternatives. Challengers to incumbents face a plethora of electoral disadvantages, such as the financial barriers to running for office, meaning that voters rarely find candidates that they would vote for over the incumbent on their ballot.\n\nSince we can’t hold the people we vote for accountable, it hardly seems appropriate to say voting is a meaningful right. Voting is supposed to mean participating in politics, being a part of deciding our future. But it seems clear that this isn’t the case. Worse, our elections undermine a foundation of democratic participation: our ability to respectfully discuss issues with each other.\n\nBelgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe argues that democracies need institutions that promote respect between political opponents by grounding them in a shared commitment to liberty and equality and giving them the space to discuss political issues.4 Without such institutions, those who have political disagreements are inclined to see each other as enemies. Thus, they forsake the idea of working with each other and instead engage in a battle of identity politics, where each political group attempts to dominate the other.\n\nAs such, we need these institutions to protect our right to political participation. Without them, political groups will resort to identity politics, denying outsiders the right to partake in democratic governance. Further, without speaking to people of diverse viewpoints, we’ll be unable to develop and share reasonable beliefs, undermining the meaning of our political participation. Thus, we need institutions that foster respectful relationships across the aisle, especially since most Republicans and Democrats have negative or strongly negative views of the opposing party.5 However, our election system is not such an institution. Rather, it is the exact opposite: a driving force of political polarization.\n\nConsider how our elections work. As an institution, they are structured as a high-stakes game, not a discussion forum. There are clear teams led by candidates, distinct winners and losers, and visible scores (such as polling results or the final vote count). While this structure effectively allocates the limited representative seats available, it also pits Americans against each other and compels us to forget our democratic values in favor of victory.\n\nWe vote to decide how to govern ourselves, but the nature of elections reduces this goal to ensuring that our team gets more votes than our opponent. While getting more votes could mean discussing issues with voters across the aisle, it could also mean pushing voters that already agree with you to the voting booth, targeting undecided voters in swing states, and gerrymandering voters of the opposing team out of relevance–tactics that, while perhaps undemocratic and inflammatory, are much easier and more effective.\n\nSure, we don’t have to adopt this “whatever it takes to defeat the enemy” mentality, but our electoral system encourages us to–and we generally do. A study found that an overwhelming majority of participants would vote for their party even if it meant forsaking democratic principles.6 Campaigns often frame elections in terms of defeating the opposition, with one 2020 campaign literally named Defeat Trump.7 The media is happy to play along, announcing victors and losers based on vote counts. Yet considering this system only fuels political polarization while corporations get their way, the reality is that we’re all losing.\n\nThis might seem like a drastic conclusion. Plenty of others who dislike our electoral system only propose modest reforms. For instance, we might implement ranked-choice voting to increase the likelihood that a representative will reflect a voter’s views or require campaigns to disclose their donors so voters know who is trying to influence them. However, such reforms fail to address how the gamified nature of elections encourages political polarization. We could increase campaign finance transparency, but candidates will still look to vote counts as a score, voters will still divide themselves into teams, and the goal will still be to win office. Nor do such reforms ensure that legislators are accountable to us after being elected. Even if we elect a legislator by ranked-choice voting, the vast majority of citizens will still remain ignorant of their actions, allowing them to neglect public interests.\n\nThe only solution is to replace elections with an institution that gives citizens more power in decision-making processes and fosters respectful discussions across the political spectrum. Guerrero suggests we replace Congress with several legislatures. Each would write legislation on a single issue and be made up of 300 randomly selected adult US citizens.8 This system has numerous advantages over elections. For instance, it is not competitive in nature and thus would not be as polarizing as elections. Further, legislators wouldn’t receive campaign donations from interest groups, preventing corporations from having undue influence over policy. Legislators also couldn’t solve ideological differences by electorally kicking the opposition out of the room, so they would be encouraged to work across the aisle. While the media might still declare winners based on who is selected, journalists would write about how legislators might reach agreements rather than how parties could win the next election.\n\nI expand on Guerrero’s idea to give every American more opportunities to participate. Let’s have a national open-response poll every two years to create a list of issues that concern a statistically significant number of Americans. We’ll form one of Guerrero’s legislatures for each problem on the list. We’d pick the 300 legislators for each from Americans interested in the issue.\n\nUnder this system (let’s call it Participocracy), election campaigning would be less polarizing. Although interest groups would still campaign to get their issues on the list, they would do so by motivating Americans to consider others’ concerns instead of antagonizing them against a political party. Since the poll is open-response, political parties would no longer appear on the ballot and identifying with a political party wouldn’t help everyday citizens vote. Thus, Participocracy’s issue-based voting system would empower Americans to identify less strongly with traditional political parties, weakening our propensity to hate those of the opposing political party.\n\nParticipocracy could also increase political participation. While up to 60% of Americans today don’t vote because it seems pointless or they don’t identify with a candidate,9 Participocracy would make participation more meaningful and personal by empowering everyone to identify what matters to them and giving them an equal chance to write legislation. Further, since multiple legislatures require more legislators, lawmaking would no longer be the duty of an elite class of politicians. Thus, Participocracy would make meaningful political participation more widespread and base lawmaking in discussions rather than strategic attempts to defeat political opponents.\n\nAs we’ve been conditioned to believe that elections are a sacred part of democracy, it’s hard to imagine doing away with them. But as they continue to fuel the rising political animosity in America, we need to rethink how we participate in democracy. Participocracy shows that imagining a more meaningful and democratic replacement to our electoral system is hardly impossible. It’s time for us to start making these replacements a reality.\n\nNotes\n\nMontanaro, Domenico. “The Most Consequential Election in a Lifetime (and This Time They Mean It).” NPR.

I hoped that my hard work inside and outside of the classroom would culminate in a Harvard acceptance. But, disappointment quickly set in when I learned that I was waitlisted. I felt despondency spread throughout my body. The disappointment continued in the shadow of the recent appeal of the case SFFA v. Harvard College in which the Students for Fair Admission continue to accuse Harvard of unlawfully discriminating against White and Asian-American applicants by practicing race-conscious admissions. The true reason that I was waitlisted may never be known, but as a white female applicant, I couldn’t help but wonder if my decision was made for the sake of diversity. Despite not having a seat at Harvard this year, I continue to support affirmative action and argue that it is ethical.\n\nAffirmative action is necessary in order to create equal opportunity for people of diverse backgrounds, and it takes on forms in business and university admissions. In business, hiring processes that favor underrepresented groups are considered to be affirmative action. For example, The State of California mandated that companies have female representation on their Boards of Directors in light of the common lack thereof. Universities create diversity via race-conscious admissions, and to do this, they favor previously underrepresented groups. Despite seeming unfair to some on the surface, affirmative action is critical in business and higher education admissions to build diversity and ensure equal opportunity.\n\nAffirmative action is utilitarian. Utilitarianism strives to maximize general happiness and well-being, and affirmative action accomplishes this in two ways. First, it reaps great benefit to minority students over time while inflicting virtually no harm on non-minority students. Disappointment on an individual basis, much like my experience being waitlisted, is the only harm that non-minority applicants suffer. Berkeley Economist Zachary Bleemer conducted a study that shows that banning affirmative action in California (Proposition 209) harmed Black and Hispanic students while barely benefitting Whites and Asian-Americans. Adverse effects on Black and Hispanic students included significantly lower levels of income and matriculation at other schools with much fewer resources. White and Asian students, on the other hand, were minimally positively impacted by Proposition 209. They did not make significantly more money than they otherwise would have. Affirmative action is ethical because the positive impacts on minority students outweigh the negative impacts on non-minority applicants, therefore maximizing utility.\n\nSecond, affirmative action increases diversity which benefits everyone. The Supreme Court has supported diversity and affirmative action. The case Grutter v. Bollinger solidifies that race-conscious admissions practices are legal because of the enrichment resulting from diversity. Race can be considered a “plus factor” in admissions, and it is one. As a Northeastern University student, my educational experience is enhanced from learning in an environment that unites a variety of experiences and opinions. Additionally, diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams in business, and they broaden knowledge in educational settings. These teams manifest significantly higher innovation rates, and diversity in the classroom challenges students to consider things from a variety of perspectives, therefore enhancing learning. Since diversity benefits everyone, the general well-being is maximized, making it utilitarian.\n\nOpponents see affirmative action as indefensible quotas and reverse discrimination. They argue that discrimination cannot be remedied with discrimination and that admissions should be merit based. There are two critical considerations here. The first is that diversity brings benefits to everyone, including opponents. The Supreme Court is spot on in the decision that affirmative action is valid due to the benefits of diversity, and this is the primary argument in favor of affirmative action in general. There are no quotas, and it is no longer a question of correcting past wrongs; rather, it is forward-looking and exists to enrich businesses and universities by welcoming various backgrounds and experiences. The second consideration is that merit-based admissions cannot rule in practice with the existence of implicit bias. With implicit biases, all things will never be equal. Admissions decisions cannot be purely merit-based when admissions officers unconsciously act on the basis of prejudice. The only way to overcome implicit bias is to confront it and engage in practices that consciously support diversity and inclusivity, much like affirmative action does.\n\nSo, back to the Harvard applicant portal. It is possible that a seat that could have been mine was filled by an applicant that would help Harvard build a diverse class. But, my personal loss of not being able to attend Harvard is minuscule compared to the value that diversity brings to the college. Affirmative action is ethical because it increases diversity in business and higher education to everyone’s benefit and creates a society with more equal opportunity for all.\n\nDevon Burrill\n\nContemporary Political Thought, Fall 2020\n\nIn 1953, at the height of the Red Scare, a Republican member of the Indiana Textbook Commission argued for the removal of all references in state teaching materials to the legendary figure of Robin Hood. The mythology, she argued, was being employed as propaganda for communism, glorifying the hero who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. Although this brand of paranoia was typical of the McCarthy era, the motion failed, and the only tangible result was a student organized protest in defense of the mythological hero.\n\nToday, public perception of Robin Hood varies. For some, he represents class struggle and the fight against economic injustice. For others, he represents rebellion against tyranny, and a commitment to liberty. For socialists and libertarians who so often disagree, the virtue of Robin Hood is a rare point of convergence. This may owe to the fact that Robin Hood predates capitalism by several hundred years, and in his day political and economic power were more explicitly synonymous. The greedy Prince John acted as both the decadent Bourgeoisie and the oppressive state, villain to both sides. Some may ask if Robin Hood’s archetypal mission “to take from the rich and give to the poor” is obsolete in our modern, capitalist economy. I will argue it isn’t.\n\nBefore I discuss the merits of redistribution, I should acknowledge that in several key ways, capitalism is distinct from the oppressive monarchy of Robin Hood’s time. The free market carries information about supply and demand throughout the economy, incentivizes innovation, directs resources towards productivity, and encourages competition between companies. All of these have positive effects on the standard of living, the quality of goods and services, and the affordability of products, even for the working class. Unlike Prince John, who hoards his tax revenue, companies like Apple and Amazon contribute to society through employment, the development of products, and the spending of revenue on other goods and services within the economy.\n\nIn fact, Jason Brennan argues that the basic structure of capitalism is not only practical, but also morally preferable to the socialist alternative. In Why Not Capitalism?, he considers both the realistic and ideal cases of human nature. In the realistic case, people are selfish and uncooperative, while in the ideal case, people are altruistic and cooperative. If people are selfish, then capitalism exploits that selfishness for universal benefit, employing human greed for economic growth. If people are altruistic, then they still maximize their altruism by operating within the capitalist market due to its ability to coordinate vast systems of individuals along with their desires and preferences. Brennan details many functions of the market, some of which I mentioned above, but the core argument is that capitalism successfully coordinates much more information than a central authority can manage, and that natural coordination allows individuals and businesses to flourish.\n\nDoes this mean we should write off the figure of Robin Hood as a remnant of simpler economic times? I don’t think so.\n\nWhile our system may be preferable to some alternatives, it is by no means perfect. As Martin Luther King Jr. famously pointed out, “this country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.” Government bailouts of large corporations, business stimulus during the pandemic, and federal subsidies are clear examples. But more fundamentally, there’s something inherently unsettling about the growing inequality in our country, with a few individuals passing the $100 billion mark while the bottom half struggles to get by. If capitalism has so many positive effects on society, why do the benefits seem to flow towards the upper class, rather than “trickle down” to the lower classes?\n\nThe typical justification is that CEOs and founders contribute value to society. For example, if I use Amazon, Jeff Bezos surely deserves some compensation. Critically, however, this system overcompensates founders by protecting intellectual property. The success of Amazon is a result of the efforts of many people, but only Jeff Bezos can control the distribution of profit among his employees. In a hypothetical market without governance, there would be no intellectual property, and competitors could create their own versions of Amazon to attract customers. By enforcing intellectual property rights, the government protects Jess Bezos’s monopoly on Amazon, artificially distorting market forces to his advantage.\n\nOne of the central ideas here is economic rent. A rentier is someone who derives value from the passive ownership of a means of production such as a factory, a piece of land, or a piece of intellectual property. In the United States today, most of the immensely wealthy have gained their fortune through intellectual ownership of large economic entities which include the efforts of many other people. These entities usually occupy a critical position in the market with limited competition. For example, Warren Buffett intentionally seeks out companies that resemble small monopolies, such as pharmaceutical companies that can inflate prices by owning patents for drugs. The possibility of these monopolies is not an inherent feature of markets, but is a direct result of government enforcement of intellectual property.\n\nSo while markets may offer important benefits to society, our version of capitalism inherently leads to monopolies and increasing wealth inequality. By giving founders total power over the profits generated by their ideas, we give them control over large portions of the economy. This begs the question: should we abolish intellectual property? Again, I don’t think so. Intellectual property provides an important incentive to entrepreneurs. While Jeff Bezos may not be responsible for all of the success of Amazon, the very existence of founders and their willingness to start companies depends on intellectual property rights. By abolishing intellectual property, we would not only reduce Jeff Bezos’s incentive to start Amazon, but also the incentive of his competitors to start analogous companies. Much like the market itself, intellectual property has many important functions, and its benefits are worth defending.\n\nInstead, I think we need to counter the stratifying tendencies of the system through redistributive taxation, a Robin Hood policy for modern capitalism. Rather than abolish the incentive to start companies, we can partially siphon the profits generated by those companies through individual and corporate taxes, and then redistribute the revenue to society as a whole. Income taxes for individuals are susceptible to loopholes and workarounds, so in order for this taxation to function properly we must eliminate the numerous tax breaks that can be exploited by the upper class. Unlike abolishing intellectual property, taxing the wealthy can be managed without destroying the incentive to innovate. In fact, the value added to the lower classes would itself have many practical benefits for society. For example, decreased inequality leads to lower crime rates, increased cohesion, decreased health problems, and an increased capacity of those in the lower classes to compete in the market.\n\nSo while the functions of the market are necessary, they are not sufficient. Modern American capitalism in particular has a tendency to produce monopolies and inequality, largely as a result of our protection of intellectual property. The best way to address this problem is with redistributive taxation, which reduces the injustice of an imperfect system and, like Robin Hood, returns value directly to those who have been deprived of the benefits and special protections granted to the privileged and the powerful.\n\nWord Count: 1210\n\nSources\n\nEschner, Kat. “Students Allied Themselves With Robin Hood During This Anti-McCarthyism Movement.” Smithsonian.com, Smithsonian Institution, 13 Nov. 2017, www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/students-allied-themselves-robin-hood-during-1950s-anti-mccarthyism-movement-180967156/.\n\nKramer, Leslie. “What Are Current Examples of Oligopolies?” Investopedia, Investopedia, 29 Sept. 2020, www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121514/what-are-some-current-examples-oligopolies.asp.\n\nNutting, Rex. “Billionaires Haven’t Earned All They Have.” MarketWatch, MarketWatch, 9 Feb. 2019, www.marketwatch.com/story/billionaires-take-more-than-they-make-2019-02-07?mod=article_inline.\n\nNutting, Rex. “Why Raising Taxes on the Rich Isn’t so Crazy.” MarketWatch, MarketWatch, 14 Dec. 2019, www.marketwatch.com/story/why-raising-taxes-on-the-rich-isnt-so-crazy-2019-12-09.\n\nJasmine Chan\n\nSex in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Fall 2020\n\nAn update from Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs David Madigan regarding COVID-19 policies for the Spring 2021 semester at Northeastern opens with the statement, “Working together this semester we successfully reimagined almost every aspect of university life — from teaching to dining to recreation.” The keyword here is “almost.” All official statements about adapting to the public health crisis on campus have avoided the elephant in the room: The sex life of students.\n\nCollege is often regarded as a place where young adults have sexual freedom, and this sentiment will not be erased amidst a pandemic. Northeastern’s COVID-19 policies that ignore sex and dating in student life jeopardize the health of the Northeastern community.\n\nHarm reduction strategies have been proven to be more effective at reducing adverse consequences associated with substance abuse and sex than promoting abstinence, particularly in adolescents. The philosophy of harm reduction involves accepting the continuation of a certain behavior and providing resources to lower the potential risks when the behavior does occur.\n\nWhile COVID-19 is not classified as a sexually transmitted disease, we know the spread of infection through sexual contact is highly likely. The virus is not going away anytime soon, so Northeastern should implement the harm reduction philosophy to promote safer sex practices during the pandemic. This is a more effective and sustainable option than expecting students to abstain from sex. While the university encourages harm reduction strategies for safe socialization — through outdoor, socially-distant hangouts with masks or in a virtual setting — Northeastern offers no adaptations for physical intimacy which can be just as important for mental health as interacting with friends.\n\nThe update to Northeastern’s visitor protocol prohibits any guests in student housing. Sanctions for attending or hosting unsafe gatherings (defined as lacking masks and not staying six feet apart at all times) both on and off campus include suspension and/or expulsion. The university is not explicitly saying “do not have sex,” but to fully comply with the rules as stated, sex is not an option.\n\nWith the school’s urban location and a national spike in dating app usage, however, these rules do not stop students from secretly engaging in sexual activity off campus where the policies cannot be enforced. Therefore, if students will continue to have sex anyway, and Northeastern is committed to “protecting the pack,” the school has a responsibility to inform students on how to be as safe as possible if they choose to be physically intimate with a partner.\n\nThis resource from the Office of Prevention and Education at Northeastern, or OPEN, provides information on how to navigate safer sex during the pandemic, including where you can get free sexual health supplies and how to talk to a sexual partner about one’s boundaries related to COVID-19. However, I believe it is not a mistake that this resource was hard to find and not linked anywhere in Northeastern’s main communications with students. COVID-19 related conversations will never be sexy, but an upfront, open dialogue about sex and health concerns from the university would normalize their necessity.\n\nAnother troubling consequence of Northeastern’s lack of consideration for the sex life of students is that those who choose to be sexually active during this time will avoid seeking medical care that is crucial for their health. For some students, Northeastern is their only resource for sexual health resources such as contraception and STI testing. When most instances of sexual activity go against Northeastern’s COVID-19 policies, students can be deterred from turning to the University Health and Counseling Services out of fear of punishment.\n\nSome may argue that a school should have no say in private matters like a student’s sex life, but Northeastern’s existing policies already control how students conduct themselves everyday. So why is sexuality left out of the conversation? I admittedly would feel awkward if Provost Madigan addressed sex in an official capacity, but that is simply because it is expected that educational institutions hold conservative values when it comes to sex. Northeastern’s silence on sex as a part of social life is a reflection of the Protestant framework of morality that governs public life in the United States. At the very least, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, sex becomes a public matter with relevant health consequences.\n\nNo one will die from abstaining from sex for a year, or however long being sexually active during the pandemic is seen as a selfish choice that puts the lives of others at risk. However, no one passes moral judgment on those who prefer to attend in-person classes even though it still involves potential risks, and online learning is another viable alternative. Universities can and should play an active role in reimagining a sex-positive society. That involves looking the elephant in the eye by adjusting policies to reflect a harm reduction approach to sex, just as universities do for every other part of student life.\n\nJasmine Chan is a recently graduated Media & Screen Studies and Communications combined major.

Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck till he died while three others assisted him after a call about an alleged fake $20 bill. The riots and destruction of property that took place in the following days were loudly condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike. In September, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi expressed her support of “peaceful demonstrations” and made sure to note “that does not include looting, starting fires, or rioting.” The question of the “right way” to protest has come up yet again, as another Black life is taken at the hands of the police with the discussion around the form of protests in Minneapolis dominating much of the early coverage of Floyd’s death.\n\nFrom politicians, to news anchors, to the average American, the belief that Black protests must be peaceful is widespread and deeply rooted in our society. Those on both sides of the aisle have used the words of Martin Luther King Jr. to call for peaceful protests, arguing for both its moral superiority and effectiveness. But in the half-century since the civil rights movement, Black Americans continue to face systemic white supremacy permeating through every level of the United States criminal justice system and are all the while universally expected to protest peacefully in the face of these injustices. The basic demand for Black protest in America to be peaceful is misguided at best and must be reevaluated. The recent riots over the summer are not acts outside of real and justified protest, instead they should be understood as legitimate expression of Black anger at continued racial injustice in a society that values the destruction of material capital over Black lives.\n\nThe current Black Lives Matter movement is constantly compared to the civil rights movement of the 1960s as a means to condemn violent protest and champion Black pacifism. In a campaign speech over the summer, President Elect Joe Biden declared that “rioting is not protesting,” adding that it “makes things worse across the board” and is “not what Dr. King taught.” This understanding of the 1960s movement has been told, and even taught in schools, to the point that it is now seemingly understood as basic knowledge. However, when taking a closer look, this popular narrative turns out to be premised on a significant degree of falsehood.\n\nIn her 2016 article, “Black Lives Matter and the Paradox of US Black Politics,” Professor Juliet Hooker dissects the underlying false assumptions that make up the very shaky ground for arguments against Black uncivil protest. One such assumption is what Hooker refers to as a “romantic narrative of the civil rights movement,” a whitewashed retelling of the events in a way that ignores the important role of more radical players in the movement like Malcom X and the Black Panther Party and advantageously leaves out any disagreement between Black activists at the time over the most successful forms of protest. She argues that this misconception of the movement “functions to foreclose other (possibly more radical) forms of black politics, and preemptively delegitimizes them.”\n\nHooker is right. King did not encapsulate the entire civil rights movement. In fact, important actors like Stokely Carmichael, once chair of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, along with many other young activists gradually came to oppose King’s slow nonviolent method of peaceful integration, forming the influential Black Power movement. Similarly, riots like the Little Rock Uprising in 1968, were integral parts of the movement for justice. Even King himself was viewed as a potential violent threat to the government so much so that the FBI launched a COINTELPRO investigation, believing he was on path to become a “messiah” of a violent army. The current misrepresentation of the civil rights movement as a peaceful and popular Black pursuit of equality is extremely counterproductive to the Black Lives Matter protests of today. This narrative places Black activists into what Hooker refers to as a “tragic political trap” in which they are condemned to peaceful protest based upon a false perception of the past.\n\nAfter setting the historical record straight, we can better understand rioting as legitimate means of expression of anger and pain for Black citizens living in a country deeply ingrained with white supremacy. Between 2013 and 2018, one in every thousand Black men died at the hands of the police, making them two and a half times more likely to be killed than white men. In Minneapolis, police are at least seven times more likely to use force against Black citizens rather than whites. For Black women, especially transgender women, this racial injustice coupled with sexism and transphobia amounts to widespread discrimination across all facets of daily life. Juliette Hooker’s article was in response to the discussions following the death of Eric Gardner in 2016. Four years and many peaceful protests later, we are still having the same discussions today with little to no progress towards righting this country’s deep racial wrongs. How can we justifiably ask Black citizens to protest peacefully when their incessant oppression has been anything but peaceful?\n\nIn an article he wrote for the Cincinnati College of Law, Paul Butler points out that because of such limited Black progress since the 1960s and the evidence of widespread racial inequality today, “there is a surprisingly robust debate about exactly what good the civil rights movement did for African-Americans.” Black Americans have been peacefully protesting year after year, and yet they still continue to face systemic white supremacy across the board. Riots in response to such unchanging oppression should not be anything but expected and understood.\n\nUnderstanding rioting as a means of protests becomes even more clear when taking a closer look at how news is shared today. The events over the summer have shown that news media networks are incentivized to portray chaos to their audience, making violence the central focus of surrounding discussions. According to a study from the US Crisis Monitor, 93% of all racial justice protests this summer were peaceful, yet the violence against private property is what captures our attention most and is thus most emphasized in the news. A familiar response from those in favor of progress but against rioting is the notion that looting and burning pulls attention away from the overall message of racial justice. But if destruction of material property is enough to distract from the incessant loss of Black life and the devastating injustices that Black citizens continually face in this country, it seems the peaceful cry for change had no chance of truly being heard to begin with.\n\nThe US has become numb to years of Black oppression and peaceful unrest. With each police execution of a Black citizen, calls for peaceful protest follow, before the news switches stories and forgets the issue until the next death. Riots may be the inevitable and much-needed shock to this all too comfortable cycle. The discussion around recent Black Lives Matter protests, in large part due to the constant coverage and debate surrounding the riots in Minneapolis and across the country, has brought a new level of awareness to current problems of racial injustice.\n\nPraising the civil rights movement while condemning current uncivil protest is both means for politicians to deny culpability for injustices that drive the unrest and overall counterproductive to the movement’s goals. For real anti-racist change to occur we can no longer deny these riots as legitimate protest. Instead of condemning violence against storefronts and hotel buildings, it’s time we truly listen to the riots, what Dr. King himself referred to as “the language of the unheard,” and shift our focus towards achieving its so necessary and justified demands.\n\nReferences\n\nButler, Paul. “The System Is Working the Way It Is Supposed to: The Limits of Criminal Justice Reform,” Freedom Center Journal: Vol. 2019: Iss. 1, Article 6, 2020, https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/fcj/vol2019/iss1/6.\n\nEdwards, Frank, et al. “Risk of Being Killed by Police Use of Force in the United States by Age, Race–Ethnicity, and Sex.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, National Academy of Sciences, 20 Aug. 2019, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1821204116.\n\n“Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).” The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute, Stanford, 21 May 2018, kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/federal-bureau- investigation-fbi.\n\nGlobal News. “Joe Biden Condemns Violence in Ongoing U.S. Protests: ‘Rioting Is Not Protesting.’” YouTube, 31 Aug. 2020, www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzVc-f5g6EY.\n\nGstalter Morgan. “Twitter puts warning on Trump ‘THUGS’ tweet, says it violates standards, glorifies violence.’ The Hill, 15 March 2020, https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/500072-twitter-says-trump-thugs-tweet- violates-standards-glorifies-violence.\n\nHooker, Juliet. “Black Lives Matter and the Paradoxes of U.S. Black Politics: From Democratic Sacrifice to Democratic Repair.” Political Theory, vol. 44, no. 4, Aug. 2016, pp. 448– 469, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0090591716640314.\n\nHRC Staff. “Report Details the Experiences of Being Black & Trans in the U.S.” Humain Rights Campaign, 3 Oct. 2017, www.hrc.org/news/new-report-details-the-experiences-of-being-black-and-transgender-in-the-u.\n\nKirk, John A. “Little Rock Uprising of 1968.” Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Central Arkansas Library Systems, 20 Oct. 2020, encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/little-rock-uprising- of-1968-9181/.\n\nKishi, Roudabeh, and Sam Jones. “Demonstrations & Political Violence in America: New Data for Summer 2020.” Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, 11 Dec. 2020, https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/.\n\nOppel, Richard A., and Lazaro Gamio. “Minneapolis Police Use Force Against Black People at 7 Times the Rate of Whites.” The New York Times, 3 June 2020, www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html.\n\nPruitt, Sarah. “How the Black Power Movement Influenced the Civil Rights Movement.” History.com, A&E Television Networks, 20 Feb. 2020, www.history.com/news/black-power-movement-civil-rights.\n\n@thehill.

However, the US medical system fails to uphold this premise, as its structure inherently contributes to the death of African Americans. It remains a graveyard and a site of loss and distrust, especially for the most marginalized groups such as Black women. For example, regardless of income or education level, Black women are 3-4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Also, Black Americans are 22% less likely to receive any pain medication than their white counterparts.\n\nMany of us are very familiar with the current disparities in medicine, and historical disasters such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and other inhumane practices done by the U.S. medical system have caused Black Americans to become fearful and avoid participating within it. These racial underpinnings of the medical system are rooted within the framework of essentialism, more specifically race essentialism, which describes race as a biological grouping of people with distinct inherent qualities and genetic predispositions that determine one’s personality, characteristics, behaviors, and abilities.\n\nProponent of scientific racism and social Darwinism, Francis Galton, coined the term ‘eugenics’ as a way of framing race essentialism within a context of sexual selection, and the elimination of flawed peoples. Racist and sexist essentialist ideologies were what constituted a so-called healthy and just lifestyle in the United State, and such ideologies continue to permeate today, establishing themselves as a legitimate force to analyze Black bodies. Pulling from the scholarship of Sabrina Strings, Michel Foucault, and bell hooks, I call for the reimagination and undoing of healthcare and medical practices in the US. I call for a system that doesn’t ground itself within white ideologies and normative clauses of human flourishing, but rather one that models its practices under a phenomenological structure, concentrating on the direct experiences of the most marginalized.\n\nThe US medical system’s racial and hierarchical origins are a historical account. During Reconstruction, when slavery was no longer a plausible clause for the separation of the races, the eugenics movement became a popular force for establishing differences and providing ‘legitimate’ justifications for racial hierarchies. While slave-master relations had originally been designed to position Black people as inferior, essentialism and eugenics in the late 1800s to 1900s drew this distinction farther and wider apart. The eugenics movement relied upon racist philosophical and scientific predispositions as to what constitutes one as human, and the ongoing efforts to get closer to this truth relied upon improving the quality of humankind. This feat required the continuous extrapolation of traits that were not seen as necessary for the pinnacle of humanity. Eugenics required the constant erasure of characteristics and phenotypes that did not align with what it means to be human within a white supremacist context. As a result, scientists and theorists deemed phenotypes and ways of living that were associated with Blackness as non-human, thus, the demonization of such characteristics was necessary to ‘cleanse’ the human genetic makeup, leading to the desire to erase Blackness as a whole.\n\nFor example, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Irvine, Sabrina Strings draws the connection between fatness as a racial category, and as a negative ideological construct that has gained its popularity and legitimacy through the medical system. She states, “the phobia about fatness and the preference for thinness has not, principally or historically been about health. Instead, they have been one way the body has been used to craft and legitimate race, sex and class hierarchies.” From this excerpt and her book at large, String proves that hierarchies of body type have no true basis in health, but rather scientists and medical practitioners have used body type as a way of separating the races. Scientists, Rebecca M. Puhl and Chelsea A. Heuer have researched how obesity and fatness have been stigmatized and associated with characteristics such as “lazy, weak-willed, unsuccessful, unintelligent, lack self-discipline, have poor willpower]”— characteristics that are often also associated with Blackness. As fatness was (and is) often associated with Blackness, the desire to erase fatness was derived from this desire of furthering oneself away from or eliminating Blackness.\n\nFurthering Strings’ point, it is the dehumanization of Othered groups that upholds these eugenic standards of human life which are practiced today. Michel Foucault states, “racism justifies the death-function in the economy of biopower, by appealing to the principle that the death of others makes one biologically stronger.” As biopower functions as a tool for controlling the life of populations, the healthcare system has been used as a disciplinary technology for eliminating criteria that did not promote this biopower. This explains that the ongoing efforts to prioritize a “healthy and thereby good citizen,” as stated by Strings, rely on the exclusion and extrapolation of Black bodies. Norms about the “healthy citizen” are directly antithetical to what is deemed as “black characteristics” as the dehumanization of Black people was necessary to promote such eugenic standards of human life. This dehumanization continues to affect Black individuals today.\n\nFor example, statistics supporting the under-diagnosis of pain amongst Black women have both racial and gendered origins because the very construct of gender itself was born out of the need to separate whiteness from Blackness. The ungendering of Black women initially occurred during slavery as a means of justifying inhumane treatment and rape. Perceiving Black women as objects relieved the moral pressure of seeing them as human beings, and therefore justified the idea that they are incapable of experiencing pain. To objectify them also meant to take away their womanhood, and in efforts to separate white women from Black women, categories of femininity and womanhood had to be constructed in direct opposition to what Black women “were.” This has contemporary manifestations as Black women are constantly masculinized. Consequently, white women became the standard of femininity, and characteristics such as fragility, softness, and gentleness became attributed to (white) womanhood, therefore allowing the public to be more empathetic to white pain. Understanding the racial and gendered underpinnings of fatphobia and pain management sheds light on how Black people have been used as a category to measure “humanness” against, and thereby creating healthcare that is fundamentally anti-Black.\n\nGiven the historical precursors that have established the approaches of diagnosis and treatment in medicine, I propose the answer to undoing these injustices must be rooted within a framework of phenomenological analyses as a significant method. Although medicine and scientific inquiry are generally removed from subjectivity of any kind, scientific inquiry still operates within a social framework. Thus, assessing medicine from a race and class perspective is important for alleviating these issues. In an article written by Neubauer et al., the authors see phenomenology as a valuable tool for health professional education (HPE) scholars. They quote phenomenology as, “an approach to research that seeks to describe the essence of a phenomenon by exploring it from the perspective of those who have experienced it.[14]” This means that researchers and practitioners in medicine should approach research and practice from the direct experiences of groups that are experiencing the domain of investigation materially. Consequently, one cannot look at medicine from a pedagogy of objectivity.\n\nI agree that phenomenology is necessary for assessing the reality of health situations in the US. However, to undo the harm that the US medical establishment has produced against Black Americans, I propose that this phenomenological approach be based upon bell hooks’ theory of the centralization of the most marginalized. Although hooks’ argument, in her book, Feminist Theory from Margin to Center, is based upon the inclusion of Black women within feminist spaces and movements, these ideas are necessary within the medical system as well, simply because the medical system is a social reality and necessity for all kinds of human life. hooks states that Black women are situated within a unique position, as they collectively occupy the bottom of the occupational ladder and the social strata. She thereby states, “occupying such a position, we bear the brunt of sexist, racist and classist oppression.” Although both Black men and women deal with racism, hooks states that Black male sexism undermines the struggle to erase racism. Also, the ‘ungendering’ of Black women has shown how they’ve been excluded from the assessment of issues that affect women, such as maternity. Viewing issues of medical disparities from the perspective of Black womanhood accounts for the intersections of race,"
