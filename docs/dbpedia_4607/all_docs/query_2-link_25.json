        "text": "Dir Chen Kaige, 1993; Drama\n\nUsually reticent about discussing his most famous work, director Chen Kaige gives a rare interview to Time Out about our number one film, Farewell My Concubine\n\nAt the 1988 Cannes Film Festival Chen Kaige was given a copy of a book by Lilian Lee, a Hong Kong-based writer. Chen found the novel, about two Peking opera stars living through decades of political upheaval in China, a bit thin. Lee didn’t have an emotional grasp on the Cultural Revolution, he thought. She hadn’t lived through it. But the story was compelling, and after a meeting with Lee the pair recruited a Mainland screenwriter, Lu Wei. In 1991 they completed the first draft of Farewell My Concubine. The resulting film remains the only Chinese-language movie to have won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, a prize it shared with Jane Campion’s The Piano in 1993.\n\nIn Chen’s previous films, King of the Children and Life on a String, allegory, elliptical narratives and poetic but enigmatic images convey socio-political undercurrents. In contrast, Farewell My Concubine is a vivid, even brash examination of the personal cost of China’s troubled decades, a subject that haunts much of Chen’s canon. Is it possible, Farewell My Concubine posits, to remain faithful to your ideals – to your family, friends, to your art – in times that demand a constant reinterpretation of values? Can humanity trump the direst of circumstance?\n\n‘To us the Cultural Revolution was worse than the Second World War, because we lost a sense of respect, of human dignity,’ says Chen, who is now 61. When he was 16, Chen was sent to the countryside in Yunnan province as part of the mass movement that uprooted the country’s urban youth. It left a deep impression. ‘I’m not trying to criticise anyone,’ Chen continues, ‘I’m saying this is history and if you know nothing about history you don’t have a future. That’s clear but no one listened to me, unfortunately. My generation’s voice is weak.’\n\nFarewell My Concubine charts the troubled relationship of two Peking opera actors, Cheng Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) and Duan Xiaolou (Zhang Fengyi) from 1925 to 1977. In an opening scene a prostitute and her son watch a troupe of child performers in the street. Master Guan, their leader, refuses to enroll the boy Dieyi because he has six fingers on one hand. The mother disposes of the handicap with a butcher’s knife, signs a contract with the bloodied stump and abandons her son to his fate.\n\nTo survive the rough justice and leg-snapping disciplines of the academy, Dieyi relies on his close friend, Xiaolou. When a powerful patron arrives to examine the troupe, Dieyi, who plays female roles, fumbles his line, ‘I am by nature a girl, not a boy’, substituting ‘boy’ for ‘girl’. Only after Xiaolou forces a pipe down his throat – in one of many phallic references – does Dieyi say it correctly. Time passes and the friends become celebrities; in their most vaunted performance, Dieyi plays a concubine devoted to Xiaolou’s king, mirroring their offstage dynamic. Xiaolou’s marriage to a prostitute, Juxian (Gong Li), devastates Dieyi. As the trio becomes ensnared in bigger events their mutual jealously, deceit, betrayals and desperation chime with the real-life drama that ravaged China at the time.\n\n‘Every film, whether it’s a historical story or not, reflects what’s happening in society,’ says Chen. ‘I don’t want to tell people what is the truth and where to find the truth. But the [Chinese film] market is growing and we are not touched by many films that are huge box office successes. Why? Money is not the final goal, this is more than clear. This market, let me tell you, is blind.’\n\nFarewell My Concubine is one of the defining works of the crop of directors who graduated from the Beijing Film Academy around 1982, China’s so-called Fifth Generation. (Chen uses the term with caution.) Like his classmates Zhang Yimou and Tian Zhaungzhuang, Chen had a rhapsodic vision of cinema and blended the personal and political with a nuance at odds with the staid propagandic films of previous decades. But Chen says that in Farewell My Concubine, society and politics are secondary. At the forefront is the blurred distinction between life and stage and the confusion of identity.\n\n‘I always create characters that I can relate to and that can represent me,’ Chen says. ‘Life is not perfect but you should allow yourself to create a perfect world and perfect characters. I believe Dieyi was me.’\n\nDieyi is a misfit. A boy born with too many fingers, he is coaxed into female roles, suffers sexual assault and, in a maternal act befitting his befuddled sense of gender, adopts a baby from the street. When Dieyi plays the concubine he inhabits his female self and is free to adore Xiaolou. Offstage he must relinquish that role.\n\nFor Chen, Dieyi’s integrity is the soul of the film: ‘He is the one who refused to grow up, he doesn’t want to tell lies to the world in order to protect himself.’ In the film’s final act the duo rehearse their old opera, but Dieyi again fumbles his line. ‘Dieyi can’t find his true self until the last,’ says Chen. ‘In it he tells Xiaolou: you are my king and I am your concubine. I think that in this sense, people should admire Dieyi because he is able to love,’ he says. ‘I think that a lot of social problems that we see today came from the Cultural Revolution. Because during that time our leader called on us to have something called class struggle, and then we had to learn to hate, not to love. But to love is everything.’ Appropriately operatic, Chen’s Farewell My Concubine is sumptuous in every respect. Intelligent, enthralling, epic\n\nDir Fei Mu, 1948; Melodrama\n\nIn a small town maimed beyond recognition by war, a housewife ambles along the ruined city walls every day. Clasped between the woman’s fingers is a basket filled with medicines for her ill husband, though the mere sight of him makes her sick, so fixated is he on the past. But it is spring, and for once, the distant wail of the train does not signal someone leaving, but the arrival of a face not yet forgotten: a doctor in Western medicine, her husband’s childhood classmate and – unbeknown to her husband – the woman’s first and only love.\n\nToday revered as the pinnacle of Shanghai’s Golden Age of filmmaking, Spring in a Small Town seemed, upon its release in 1948, as if it would be relegated to the dustbin of history by State censors. Its portrayal of individuals as psychologically tormented and morally conflicted, rather than as part of an ideologically enlightened mass that had transcended banalities like human suffering, was deemed reactionary and bourgeois. For perhaps the first and only time in the history of such things, the censors likely got it right.\n\nThe husband’s ailments, the Western-trained doctor making things superficially better but ultimately worse, and the ruined city walls that bind the characters to a traumatic past and act as an impediment to a better future, could all be read as a comment on the condition of China. Withdrawn from cinemas by censors after just a handful of screenings, Spring in a Small Town was rediscovered in the 1980s with the reopening of the China Film Archive. Watching the film today, one is struck by how acutely it managed to diagnose the then-historical condition of China, and its daring formal experimentation. Emotional skirmishes are made all the more discordant by director Fei Mu’s choice to dissolve between shots within a scene rather than cutting conventionally.\n\nThough unmistakably of its time, the film also in this sense transcends it. Like the wife’s narration, which seems to belong to no place and no specific time – as if she, too, died with Old China and is recounting the events from some distant future – the film positions itself as inhabiting the condition of a haunting spectre.\n\nIn those impertinent dissolves that sever the film’s most achingly romantic scenes, we sense a suppressed and traumatic past that is both personal and public, erupting into the fabric of the present from some unknowable future. A swoon has never seemed so irredeemably sad.\n\nSpring in a Small Town wears its veil of mourning like a widow whose spirit has departed along with her beloved spouse. Though its characters accept that they may never truly live in this life, they persist in trying to find dignity in being alive."
