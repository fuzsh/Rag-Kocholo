        "text": "Sexual identity can be defined as the term and meaning that individuals ascribe to themselves based on their sexual attractions, desires, fantasies, behaviors, and relationships (Savin-Williams, 2011). There has been a growing body of literature on sexual identity development among sexual minorities globally. The majority of the research has come from Western countries, highlighting the process of sexual identity development and its clinical implications for sexual minority people (e.g., Ali & Barden, 2015; Bishop et al. 2020). In China, the most populous country, research on sexual identity development is much more limited. Recent evidence suggests that Chinese sexual minority men experience significantly high rates of mental health issues, which are linked with negative experiences related to one’s sexual identity (e.g., Liu et al., 2018; Sun, Pachankis, et al., 2020). Therefore, advancing the understanding of sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men may facilitate further research on their mental health and inform clinical services concerning this population.\n\nSexual minority men in the context of China\n\nHistorical and cultural contexts in China have shaped sexual identity formation among Chinese sexual minority men as a community. Throughout Chinese history, Chinese sexual minority men have continued to navigate and negotiate the intersecting systems of heterosexism and hegemonic masculinity in a dynamic way (Wong, 2015). In pre-modern times, China tolerated same-sex love (Wu, 2003). Although same-sex behaviors and relationships were documented in the literature, the concept of sexual identity did not appear until the 1980s. Historically, same-sex attraction was viewed as a type of sexual behavior rather than an essential trait of the individual (Wei, 2007). In the case of cisgender men, in particular, their sexual practices would not receive special attention if they fulfilled their responsibilities related to filial piety (Wu, 2003). Filial piety, a prominent feature of traditional Chinese culture, emphasizes being respectful and obedient to one’s parents, and importantly, passing down the family bloodline through heterosexual marriage and procreation (Hu & Wang, 2013; Wong, 2015). Built upon this cultural value, the construction of traditional Chinese masculinity centers around two components related to family commitment, namely responsibility and respectability (Ho et al., 2018; Kong, 2019a). Chinese masculine ideals require men to fulfill the responsibilities of a son, a husband, and a father in a heterosexual marriage (Sun Budge et al., 2020). In terms of respectability, men need to be socially acceptable and avoid doing anything that may disgrace the family name (Kong, 2019a; Kong, 2019b). When attempting to meet the masculine ideals, Chinese men inevitably face pressure to conform to heteronormativity. Studies indicated that both sexual minority men and women in China feel hindered by filial pressure to marry and have children, with men’s sexual identity-related concerns particularly connected to cultural and familial factors (Wong et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2018; Sun, Budge, et al., 2020).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1997, same-sex sexual behaviors were criminalized as a form of “hooliganism” which referred to deviant behaviors against the law (Sun et al., 2006; Wu, 2003). In the 1980s, China underwent economic reform and opened up the country to foreign investment. As a result, an influx of information from the external world started to reshape Chinese people’s understanding of same-sex love, including a pathological perspective informed by early Western psychiatry, which added another dimension to the already existing oppression (Wong, 2015). Meanwhile, influenced by the Western and Asian gay rights movement, Chinese LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) communities began to emerge in the late 1990s (Cao & Lu, 2014; Wang et al., 2009). Gay men from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the West brought Western models of gay identity into mainland China, where identity politics had rarely been part of the discourse. Through dialogues and explorations, sexual minorities in China came to meet with each other, expanded their knowledge, accumulated personal agency, and actively created a unified identity “Tongzhi1” as a group (Cao & Lu, 2014; Li et al., 2010). The “Tongzhi” identity was invented as an endeavor to localize and reclaim a Chinese cultural identity for LGBTQ people (Wong, 2015). With the emergence of gay and Tongzhi identity, Chinese sexual minority men sought to create their own gender script by developing gay/Tongzhi masculinity that challenged and critiqued the hegemonic heterosexual masculinity rather than being subordinate, although still constrained by it (Kong, 2019b). As a result of economic development, geographical mobility also provided opportunities for sexual minorities to migrate, leave their home environment, and explore their sexual identity more freely (Li et al., 2010; Wong, 2015). Moreover, scholars have pointed out that, Chinese sexual minorities have started to present a more individualized sense of self and identity, separate from societal and family values (Miles-Johnson & Wang, 2017; Kong, 2019a).\n\nSince 2001, the political environment for Chinese sexual minorities has slowly improved, particularly after “homosexuality” was removed from the third edition of the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-III) (Wu, 2003). However, sexual minorities continue encountering systemic barriers and regressive policies, such as government censorship of “non-heterosexual” content in TV shows and movies, and the compulsory closure of gay bars and cultural events to safeguard “public morality” (Miles-Johnson & Wang, 2018). Nevertheless, under the “Triple No Policy” (no approval, no disapproval, and no promotion; Miles-Johnson & Wang, 2018), Chinese LGBTQ communities continue to thrive despite the restrictions placed on their space and voice.\n\nSexual identity development theories\n\nGlobally, scholars have developed different theoretical models aiming to describe the process of sexual identity formation among sexual minorities. Cass (1979), along with other scholars (e.g., Coleman, 1982; Martin, 1991; Milton & McDonald, 1984; Troiden, 1979, 1988), laid the foundation for the body of research by proposing stage models that begin with identity awareness and end in identity integration. Despite their significant contribution, the stage models are subject to criticism for their inherent linearity, lack of regard for contextual influences, and minimal empirical validation (Savin-Williams, 2011). Subsequent models were developed from a life-span developmental and ecological perspective and emphasized the role of sociocultural factors in the identity development process. (Belmonte & Holmes, 2016; Horowitz & Newcomb, 2002). They argued that personal subjectivities as well as proximal and indirect social environments shape an individual’s sexual identity in a continual and reciprocal way. As these factors change throughout a person’s life, sexual identity remains mutable and flexible across the lifespan. This perspective provided a new framework that has thereafter informed the understanding of sexual identity development, including the approach taken in this study.\n\nNotably, the early models primarily sampled members of the White gay and lesbian community in Western countries (e.g., Cass, 1979; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996; Morris, 1997; Troiden, 1988). Although the diversity of experiences of sexual minority (e.g., Galupo et al., 2016; Panfil, 2019) and gender minority communities (e.g., Lerner & Lee, 2021; Minero et al., 2021) are becoming increasingly recognized, as well as experiences shaped by multiple marginalized identities (e.g., Santos & VanDaalen, 2016; Nadal et al., 2017; Wilkinson et al., 2015), there is still a lack of research attention on sexual identity among sexual minorities in China. Exploration of this issue in a cultural context such as China could provide not only localized understanding but also offer important insight into the role of cultural factors among sexual minorities globally and complement existing identity development theories.\n\nUntil recently, sexual identity development theories have not named or addressed how power, privilege, and oppression intersect to impact individuals’ and communities’ interpretations and explanations of sexual identity development. Intersectionality was originally introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989) in relation to the unique racist and sexist experiences Black women experienced within the U.S. legal system. Patricia Hill Collins (1990/2000) provided additional analyses of how systems and institutions perpetuate and reinforce oppression based on a multitude of layered cultural and historical factors. Moradi and Grzanka (2017) extended these analyses by critiquing the ways in which the field of psychology has misused and misrepresented these theories—often by simply listing marginalized identities rather than by addressing and analyzing the systems of power that create unique forms of power and privilege, and a lack thereof. One of the goals of the current study is to understand and address how identity developmental trajectory is shaped by multiple social systems and to provide an analysis of how this trajectory manifests for Chinese sexual minority men.\n\nFacilitative factors for sexual identity development\n\nIn the current study, we define the term “facilitative factors” as external factors that positively influence the processes of sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men, including factors that prompt progress in the processes and the ones that allow identity development to happen. Several factors have been identified to foster greater identity acceptance and integration among sexual minorities, including family and friend support (Kavanaugh et al., 2019; Shilo & Savaya, 2011), a supportive school environment (Brandon-Friedman & Kim, 2016), and involvement with LGBTQ community or individuals (Hanna, 2017; Sanscartier & MacDonald, 2019). The Internet and new media have also been found to provide opportunities for sexual minorities to explore identities, build self-acceptance and confidence, and come out online (Craig & McInroy, 2014; Haper et al., 2016).\n\nHowever, the quantitative research designs adopted by the majority of the previous studies restricted researchers’ ability to explore other possibilities for facilitative factors other than the ones they hypothesized and measured. Katz-Wise and Hyde (2017) sought to fill in this gap by proposing the facilitative environments model established on qualitative data from interviews with sexual minority young adults in the U.S. They discovered that in addition to the aforementioned factors, facilitative environments also include interpersonal factors such as exposure to a specific label and going to college, as well as societal factors such as social norms of acceptance of diverse sexual identities. Notwithstanding, their sample consists of predominantly White individuals in homogenous geographic locations, which limits the generalizability of their findings to other racial and ethnic groups under various cultural contexts. To date, there has been no research focused on facilitative factors for sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minorities, therefore attention to this critical issue is warranted.\n\nA Need for Context\n\nAt this point, the majority of empirical studies on Chinese sexual minority men were concerned with sexual health (e.g., Sun et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017), mental health (e.g., Beijing LGBT Center, 2014; Liu, 2018) as well as social perceptions and attitudes (primarily stigma and discrimination) (e.g., Kang, 2012; Xie & Peng, 2018). Previous research on sexual identity was mostly centered on the impact of Chinese familism and heteronormative culture on sexual minority men’s perception of their sexual identity and coming out (e.g., Hu &Wang, 2013; Kong, 2019c; Miles-Johnson & Wang, 2017). Generally, sexual minority men who endorse strong filial piety are more likely to negatively perceive their sexual identity and find it more difficult to come out (Sun Budge et al., 2020).\n\nLimited research has explored the identity formation process among sexual minority men in the context of China. Through a qualitative investigation in Shanghai, China, Sun et al. (2006) identified critical aspects of sexual minority men’s experiences with sexual identity, including the terms participants adopted to identify themselves, how they came to that identification, and how they managed identity disclosure and concealment in different social contexts. However, this research did not place a specific emphasis on identity development. Li et al. (2010) summarized four types of sexual identities practiced by sexual minority men in Guangzhou, China through an ethnographic approach: establishing a deliberate non-homosexual identity, accumulating an individual homosexual identity, forming a collective homosexual identity, and adopting a flexible sexual identity. However, the developmental trajectory remained unclear in this study. Recently, Song et al. (2021) studied sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men in a heterosexual marriage in rural areas of southeast China. Their participants experienced same-sex attraction and/or behaviors at a young age, met the “straight expectations” and entered a heterosexual marriage, and engaged with the “gay circle” which led to recognition and commitment to their minoritized sexual identity, although the challenges in sustaining the sexual life in the marriage also arose. These scholars have described different facets of Chinese sexual minority men’s experiences with sexual identity formation in varied geographic locations. Nonetheless, the existing studies are far from sufficient for presenting a comprehensive picture of the identity developmental trajectory shaped by multiple social systems, and no study to date has focused on the factors that contribute to the process in the context of China.\n\nExtant sexual identity development theories have informed targeted services and interventions for sexual minorities. An adequate understanding of identity can only be gained by taking individuals’ sociocultural context into account, as by nature, identity is a socially constructed concept (Gergen, 1985). Given the high prevalence of mental health issues among sexual minority men in China (Liu et al., 2018; Sun, Pachankis, et al., 2020) and their great need for psychosocial services, gaining a contextualized understanding of identity development among Chinese sexual minority men could inform culturally responsive services for this population.\n\nThe Current Study\n\nAlthough previous research solidified the foundation for the current investigation, none of the existing studies comprehensively explored the issue of sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men. A culturally informed understanding of this issue is imperative. Furthermore, most of the previous work focused on the inhibitive factors that impede the process of sexual identity development. There continues to be a need to explore the facilitative factors for Chinese sexual minority men to form their sexual identities. Therefore, this study aimed to address this research gap by examining the following two issues:\n\nWhat is the experience of Chinese sexual minority men in forming their sexual identity?\n\nWhat facilitative factors help Chinese sexual minority men to navigate the process of sexual identity development?\n\nIt should be noted that the approach taken in the present study focused on sexual minority identity rather than separate identities, such as “gay”, “bisexual” or “queer”. This perspective by no means sought to omit the diversity that exists within sub-identities. As sexual identity is yet to be understood in the Chinese socio-political environment, a unifying approach is needed before any further investigation is undertaken, in order to build a basis for understanding sexual minority identity among Chinese men.\n\nMethod\n\nRecruitment\n\nThis study was part of a research project that aimed to understand mental and behavioral health among Chinese sexual minority men. Recruitment information was posted on Chinese LGBTQ websites and WeChat-linked webpages. Prospective participants contacted the researcher via phone and were enrolled in the study if they met the following criteria: (a) 18 years of age or older; (b) Mandarin Chinese speaking, and; (c) self-identified as Chinese sexual minority men, meaning that they identified as men who experience persistent romantic and/or sexual attraction towards men. Following initial contact with the interviewer, an in-person meeting was scheduled. Interviews were conducted in Beijing, the capital of China, and Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in central China. The study was approved by the Education and Social/Behavioral Science Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. This paper followed the JARS–Qual guidelines (Levitt et al., 2018) for reporting qualitative research. The work in the study was not preregistered.\n\nInterview Protocol\n\nThe interviewer (the principal investigator of the study) was raised in China and speaks Mandarin as her native language. Before the interviews began, the interviewer explained the issue of consent to the participants. Participants were encouraged to seek additional information and clarification regarding the consent form, and provided their written informed consent. Interviews were 50-90 minutes in duration. Each participant received 200 RMB (32 USD) as compensation for participation in one interview. Interviews were conducted from October 2016 to April 2017 and audio-recorded.\n\nEach interview began with an open-ended question that asked participants to describe their sexual identity. The interviewer then asked participants to describe their life experiences related to sexual minority identity, as well as sexual identity-related experiences in family, social (e.g., friends), and professional (e.g., work) contexts. The interview guide is included as the supplemental material for online publication and can be accessed on APA servers. The data is confidential and thus will not be available.\n\nParticipants\n\nParticipants in this study included 24 Chinese sexual minority men. The average age of the participants was 31.8 years old (SD = 11.8, Range = [20, 79]). shows participants’ demographic characteristics, including all salient sexual identities. Among all of the participants, 18 identified as “gay or tongzhi”, two identified as “bisexual”, one identified as “unsure; gay or asexual,” one identified as “gay but unsure,” one identified as “non-labeled,” and one identified as “sexually fluid”. To safeguard the confidentiality of the participants, pseudonyms are used throughout the paper.\n\nTable 1\n\nNameAgeSelf-described Sexual OrientationRelationship StatusOccupationCheng23Comrade/GayIn relationship with a manWorks in a non-profit organizationMing35Comrade/GayCohabitated with a manWorks in a non-profit organizationFung23Sexually fluidSingleCollege studentHao38Gay, unsure if bisexualSingleSalesmanHyson32GayMarried to a womanEntrepreneurJin25GaySingleGraduate studentJu-long50Gay and “psychologically female”SingleWorked in militaryKong79BisexualMarried to a womanRetiredYan-yan35Gay and “internally female”SingleCross-dressing performerNing25“Shou”, “prefers men”, and “identity unsure”SingleUnemployedPeng28Undecided between gay and asexualSingleGraduate StudentHan29GaySingleWorks in a companyRong30GaySingleWorks in a companyShin21GaySingleCollege studentTong36GayIn relationship with a manHigh school teacherJerin24GayMarried to a manPreparing to be a government officialKenshin33GaySingleMedical doctorLee36Non-labeledSingleEntrepreneurMuchi28GayIn relationship with a manWorks for HIV education and advocacyNiran20GaySingleTeacherNaoki30GaySingleWorks in a companyRen-shu27GaySingleWorks in a companySung24BisexualSingleCollege studentWeng32GaySingleWorks in government\n\nData Analysis\n\nQualitative methods allow for an in-depth understanding of identity-related processes in a new sociocultural context. By listening to the voices of those from Chinese sexual minority communities, researchers can gain a better understanding of their perspectives and the context of their identity development process. The data analytic approach used in this study is the thematic analysis developed by Braun and Clarke (2006). Thematic analysis was chosen as the analytic method for three reasons: First, the thematic analysis includes identifying explicit themes from qualitative interviews, as well as identifying implicit themes and unspoken or implied patterns (Joffe, 2012). It was appropriate to adopt thematic analysis in this study, as we aimed to investigate processes and patterns related to sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men. Second, thematic analysis is context-sensitive. Thus, it can facilitate an in-depth understanding of participants’ identity-related processes in a sociocultural context. Third, using an inductive approach (i.e., bottom-up), thematic analysis can systematically identify common themes, which allows researchers to develop potential theoretical models that are derived from codes and themes. In addition, a reflexive approach to thematic analysis was taken in this study as we reflectively engaged with the data and the analytic process by acknowledging and examining the impact of our positionalities on data analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2019).\n\nWe analyzed the data in accordance with the steps described by Braun and Clarke (2006). Prior to carrying out the data analysis, the interview recordings were professionally transcribed by the team members. The first and second authors (GX & XW) were involved in the first step of the analysis. They familiarized themselves with the data by immersing themselves in the transcripts and reading them repeatedly. In this step, two authors individually coded the data to yield initial codes which identified units of the data that were descriptive and latent in terms of the participants’ experiences of their identity development. Only codes pertaining to the identity-related process were retained for the purpose of the analysis in the current study. The authors met regularly to discuss the coding process, identify differences, and reach an agreement regarding the final codes. Following this step, three of the authors (GX, XW, & SS) met to analyze the codes at a broader level, which involved organizing the codes into potential themes and subthemes. This process involved organizing and combining codes into overarching themes/subthemes that represent common response patterns. The authors then systematically reviewed and refined all of the themes and subthemes that had emerged. This process included engaging in a discussion about the thematic analysis, the coherence of the emerging codes and themes, and examining these themes within the context of the entire dataset. After carrying out this step, the authors met to further define and refine the names of the themes in order to ensure that they captured the essence of the themes. The next step involved writing and contextualizing the results in an accurate manner. The protocol for resolving any coding disagreements involved open discussion between coders as the first step, and if disagreement or ambiguity persisted, further discussion was made during regular team meetings. In the discussion process, we unpacked each disagreement and reflected on what influenced our viewpoints which was then communicated clearly to each other. We made efforts to reduce the power difference among team members (especially between professors and graduate students) and ensure that every team member has a free and equal voice in sharing their opinions, and that every decision was made collectively based on a team consensus. For example, it was emphasized in the meetings that differences in viewpoints are honored. Each team member acknowledged the limitations in their perspectives and responded to others in a non-judgmental way. Furthermore, graduate students were encouraged to express their opinions before professors if they felt comfortable so that their pressure to conform could be decreased. Lastly, we identified the frequency of each theme and subtheme (see ). However, it should be noted that the rarer occurrences in the data do not mean the themes are less meaningful as we do not intend to replicate quantitative patterns of excluding or controlling “outliers” (Clarke, 2005; Grzanka, 2021).\n\nTable 2\n\nThemeFrequency %\n\n(n) 1. Awareness of one’s attraction and corresponding reactions (a) Initial awareness of one’s attraction 70.83 (17) “I had a close relationship with a roommate in college. At first, I thought we were buddies or good friends, but then my feelings for him became somewhat different. For example, I had a weird feeling of jealousy when he said he wanted a girlfriend. Also, I really looked forward to seeing him during school breaks… This kind of affection just came naturally.” (b) Psychological and emotional reactions to this awareness, as characterized by internalized heteronormativity 62.50 (15) “I was very distressed and anxious because I didn’t know if I was sick. I grew up in a rural place where no one understood or accepted same-sex love. I kept asking myself “Why am I different? How should I deal with it when it’s time for me to start a family? How can I answer to my parents?” (c) Social isolation and withdrawal 12.50 (3) “After I found out that I had no feelings for girls at all, I became more and more introverted and reluctant to communicate with others.” 2. Identity Exploration (a) Engaging in romantic relationships 50.00 (12) “I officially started to accept my sexual orientation after I began a relationship with my first boyfriend.”\n\n“There was a period when I wanted to have a girlfriend and live a “normal” life, so I went out with a girl. We held hands and hugged, but I didn’t feel anything. To me, holding a girl’s hand was the same as ‘my left hand holding my right hand’. I didn’t feel any happiness and all I felt was pressure.” (b) Seeking information about sexual identity 50.00 (12) “I first learned about gay love from a movie named Lan Yu, which is adapted from the novel ‘Beijing stories’. After reading that novel, I realized that this is not an illness and there are actually lots of people who are like me. I was so relieved to find out that people of the same sex can also have true love!” (c) Involvement with other sexual minorities and the LGBTQ community 58.33 (14) “In 2003, I attended a national convention held for LGBTQ+ individuals across the country. It was inspiring to meet so many highly accomplished and successful gay people, which broadened my horizon. It turned out it is good to be gay!” 3. Moving toward identity acceptance and commitment (a) Self-acceptance and positive emotions associated with identity 33.33 (8) “As time went by, I became so much more accepting of myself. I don’t feel any inferior or want to hide in the dark because of my sexual orientation. The most important thing is that I enjoy being myself.” (b) Coming out or contemplating coming out 83.33 (20) “I only told my mom that I like some male celebrities. She didn’t seem to take it well. After all, she is my mother. I don’t want her to be unhappy… If I come out to my family, other relatives may find it out. I am afraid what they think might hurt her. So, I will not come out to my parents unless I am able to protect them.” (c) Life goals and future planning integrated with identity 33.33 (8) “I want to live as an “out” gay man, even though it means a tough life. My life goal is to create a new way of living for sexual minorities, which will be pioneering, because we don’t have a template to follow in our society. I need to explore how I can get along with my family, how to build a relationship with a partner, and how to raise a child, which is challenging but exciting.” (d) Embracing a group identity and responsibilities 62.50 (15) “All I wanted to do was to help the public learn more about us through my own action. If none of us came forward to make our voice heard, the public would never see or understand who we are…I thought I could show myself as a “living example” to help people like me better accept themselves and have the courage to face difficulties…” 4. Acceptance and support from others (a) Family 16.67 (4) “My partner was worried about his sister because she didn’t have any plans to date someone. Then I asked her. She said, ‘even though our family accepted your relationship, many people in our society cannot. Besides, your health is not in good condition. If I get married and have children, I won’t have enough time to take care of you two.’ I felt like no matter what kind of difficulties I may encounter, I have a family that I can lean on.” (b) The LGBTQ+ community 37.50 (9) “I felt less scared after seeing so many of us and their parents in the group, and I started to believe that I could become who I want to be… That event was the most powerful motivator for me to come out.” (c) Friends outside the community 20.83 (5) “Some of my classmates in college knew my sexual identity, but they never overemphasized it. I guess they have their own life. They just knew it and let me be myself.” 5. Environmental support (a) Inclusiveness in large cities 33.33 (8) “I was interested in boys when I was little. But it was not until I went to college in Beijing where I was able to learn about what “gay” is, did I start to understand myself.” (b) Increased openness over time 20.83 (5) “I think our generation has a clearer understanding of what we want. We don’t comply with the traditional norms. We don’t want the kind of life that fulfills others’ wishes. I believe this will be our future.” (c) The development of the Internet and social media 33.33 (8) “Back then, everyone (every sexual minority) I knew was from the QQ (a Chinese social networking platform) group called “big family”. There were more than one hundred of us in the group. QQ was the only tool we had to communicate with each other. Now we have almost ten applications designed for the LGBTQ population, so we can see who is around us instantly.”\n\nResearch Quality and Trustworthiness\n\nOur analysis satisfies three criteria of trustworthiness, i.e., credibility, transferability, and confirmability (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Nowell et al., 2017). Credibility was ensured by means of prolonged engagement and peer debriefing. Researchers performed prolonged engagement during both the data collection and analysis stages. During the research formation and data collection stage, the interviewer resided in China for nine months and was immersed in the local LGBTQ community throughout the period. The interviews were also characterized by prolonged engagement, as no time limit was specified. During the data analysis stage, transcript reading, coding, and regular team meetings lasted over six months. Peer debriefing, which included sharing and revising the data analysis, was performed to check the preliminary findings and interpretations of the raw data. Transferability of findings was supported by providing detailed accounts of the study methodology and presenting the findings in the context of participants’ lives, so as to assist others who may be interested in the analytic generalizability of this study.\n\nThe confirmability of this study was supported through the following steps: (a) memo writing and reflective practice, (b) discussion about researchers’ personal beliefs in order to avoid potential bias arising from their worldview, and (c) peer debriefing to ensure researchers’ understanding and presentation of the data are accurate. With respect to potential biases, team members all participated in regular conversations about how their social locations, relationships with power, values, and experiences related to sexual and gender identity may potentially affect the data interpretation.\n\nRegarding reflexivity, we recorded the biases and assumptions that team members might hold about Chinese sexual minority men and their sexual identity development. Notably, team members have some shared identities with participants (ethnicity, several members identify as sexual minorities), whereas all members identify as cisgender women. Qualitative researchers commonly conduct research outside of their own identities (Kerstetter, 2012), and we were intentional in examining our lived experiences and perspectives on gender, sexuality, and culture, with an acknowledgment that there may be limitations to the accurate understanding of participants. The three authors involved in the data analysis (GX, XW, & SS) were all born and raised in China and received higher education in the U.S. The third author is a White American who was born and raised in the U.S. Therefore, a conversation centered on the importance of avoiding taking a Western perspective which includes the established concepts, terms, and values within the western LGBTQ community.\n\nWe also noted that all team members had advocated for LGBTQ rights and been involved in LGBTQ health research and/or related clinical work. Thus, a discussion focused on caution against making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on personal experiences or knowledge informed by previous work. For example, an assumption that arose between the first and second authors was that Chinese sexual minority men would view their family, sociocultural, and political environments more as stressors than protective factors in their identity development process, and be negatively affected by these environments. Therefore, the three authors involved in the data analysis paid close attention to their propensity for this bias when interpreting data.\n\nIn addition, the researchers were mindful of cultural sensitivity throughout the study. During the research formation phase, the study PI (SS) sought feedback from stakeholders (e.g., community service providers) at Beijing LGBT Center in China to ensure the relevance and appropriateness of the study questions and the cultural sensitivity of its protocol. The PI conducted all interviews in Mandarin Chinese, the native language of both the study PI and participants, and consistently used the participants’ language regarding the description of their identities.\n\nResults\n\nThe following five themes emerged from the data analysis: a) Awareness of one’s attraction and corresponding reactions; b) Identity exploration; c) Moving toward identity acceptance and commitment; d) Acceptance and support from others; e) Environmental support. In particular, the first three themes described individual-based processes of sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men, while the latter two themes synthesized factors that facilitated the process of sexual identity development in the Chinese context. These facilitative factors have an impact on Chinese sexual minority men throughout the entire trajectory of their sexual identity development. presents additional sample quotes and frequency for each theme and subtheme.\n\nAwareness of one’s attraction and corresponding reactions\n\nThree sub-themes included: (a) initial awareness of one’s attraction; (b) psychological and emotional reactions to this awareness, as characterized by internalized heteronormativity; and (c) social isolation and withdrawal. Participants disclosed early feelings of sexual attraction at a young age (e.g., “had feelings for or interest in boys”, “vaguely felt different from other boys”) and that they found it difficult to understand where these feelings came from. Participants noted that they never heard of the terms “gay” or “homosexuality” before they became aware of their attraction. Under the influence of heteronormativity that intertwined with traditional Chinese masculinity, participants believed that they were abnormal because heterosexual marriage is the norm in society and “heterosexual attraction is the natural law” (Kong, a 79-year-old bisexual man). Participants also expressed varying levels of negative feelings such as shame, anxiety, and confusion following awareness of their attraction to men. Consequently, participants wished that they could “convert themselves” and be “a straight man” so that they could live a “normal” life and ease their emotional distress. The high-stigma environment also led to some participants once identifying as bisexual, so as to “avoid being gay.” Additionally, participants indicated their sense of social isolation and tendency to socially withdraw, which resulted from “feelings of insecurity and powerlessness around straight people,” such that participants isolated themselves from peers to avoid discrimination.\n\nIdentity Exploration\n\nThe second theme, identity exploration, included three components: (a) Engaging in romantic relationships; (b) seeking information about sexual identity; and (c) involvement with other sexual minorities and the LGBTQ community. Participants noted their first romantic relationship with men as a starting point in their journey towards understanding their sexual identity. The happiness they experienced in the relationship helped to nurture their acceptance of their sexual identity. Given that heterosexuality is the “default” social expectation for a responsible and respectable man, participants indicated that they felt pressured to date women to explore the possibility of forming a “heterosexual relationship,” but felt uncomfortable doing so.\n\nParticipants consulted all accessible information sources such as the Internet, books, and other forms of media in order to know more about sexual identity. Living in a heteronormative environment with little exposure to LGBTQ-related information, learning about the existence of the gay population was life-changing and freed them of the burden of feeling abnormal. However, homophobic information also deterred participants from any further exploration. Furthermore, getting involved with other sexual minorities and the LGBTQ community helped participants to gain a sense of social belonging. With little access to information about sexual identity, participants expressed that they felt normal for the first time in the presence of other sexual minorities, and that their sexual orientation no longer defined who they are. They also shared that being exposed to positive LGBTQ+ role models facilitated their confidence in who they are.\n\nMoving toward identity acceptance and commitment\n\nThis theme included four sub-themes: a) self-acceptance and positive emotions associated with identity, b) coming out or contemplating coming out, c) life goals and future planning integrated with identity, d) and embracing a group identity and responsibilities. Participants described that their negative feelings associated with their sexual identity were replaced by a sense of acceptance and confidence in their identity. They felt more content with life and had fewer concerns about being judged by others. Although some participants live openly as a sexual minority person, most participants selectively came out to very close friends and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Nevertheless, coming out is not an easy decision to make. For instance, one participant stated that they had to have “an extremely strong amount of determination and a clear life goal to be able to come out” (Yan-yan, a 35-year-old gay man). Participants indicated that coming out to family was crucial, yet challenging. Some chose to come out because they wanted to be understood and supported by their parents. Others came out in response to the formidable pressure they felt to get married. For most participants, however, coming out to family remained a struggle. Some were strategically preparing themselves for it, while others decided not to pursue that path for various reasons. Some reported that their family would never understand or accept their sexual identity; meanwhile, some concealed their sexual identity in order to protect their family from being hurt by the prejudice and discrimination from others.\n\nSexual identity began to exert an impact on participants’ life goals and future plans. Many participants expressed that one of their life goals was to move to a more inclusive place for sexual minorities (e.g. a foreign country allowing for gay marriage). Some participants stated that their life goal was to explore ways of living as a sexual minority man in China, and felt more optimistic about the possibilities. Group membership also deepened participants’ sense of responsibility to contribute back to the community. Participants had fought hard for greater visibility and legal rights of sexual minorities. Their efforts included but were not limited to coming out in the media to inspire other sexual minorities, committing to non-profit services for community members, and working on same-sex marriage proposals and promoting policy change.\n\nAcceptance and support from others\n\nThis theme describes acceptance and support from others as a facilitative factor in the process of sexual identity development among participants. Three primary sources of support included: (a) family; (b) the LGBTQ+ community, and (c) friends outside the community. Many participants reported that the support they had received from family members, including physical company and care, and emotional support, after their coming out facilitated their self-acceptance and ability to navigate challenges. Some participants also indicated that having an ally in the family alleviated their stress. For example, Jerin, a 24-year-old gay man, revealed that his cousin and uncle “acted as a mediator between [him] and [his] parents, and helped [him] communicate [his] sexual identity to [his] parents”.\n\nParticipants also found a source of acceptance and support in the LGBTQ+ community. They benefited from all kinds of services and help provided by the community, including support groups, individual counseling and consultation, skills training, leisure activities, and travel opportunities. These connections with the community helped participants to cope with negative feelings. Among all of the LGBTQ+ organizations, PFLAG China (同性恋亲友会, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) was discussed as particularly meaningful, as it not only inspired and guided participants to come out, but it also provided psychoeducation and support for participants’ parents. This is essential given the cultural value placed on family relations and filial piety. For instance, Tong, a 36-year-old gay man, described how PFLAG China provided an opportunity for his parents to learn about sexual minorities and connect with other parents of LGBTQ individuals:\n\nMy parents learned about homosexuality and met with other participants and their parents in the group. Some parents in PFLAG China had lots of experience helping people like my parents and me. They understood our feelings and gave us so much support. After attending that group, my parents felt we were not alone, and they gradually accepted me.\n\nIn addition, participants reported that friends outside the LGBTQ+ community created a more inclusive external environment for them. Many participants described their experience of being accepted by their friends right after coming out to them. For instance, Han, a 29-year-old gay man stated that “[he] was blessed by [his] friends when coming out and they said [he] was very brave.” Some participants also reported that, even though some of their friends did not show their support explicitly, they demonstrated a non-judgmental and respectful attitude toward their sexual identity, which participants regarded as a source of acceptance.\n\nEnvironmental support\n\nThis theme captured the protective factors from the external environment at a more macro level. The following three subthemes were identified: (a) inclusiveness in large cities; (b) increased openness over time; and (c) development of the Internet and social media. Participants shared that, in metropolitan cities such as Beijing, the public has a stronger capacity to accept and embrace diverse cultures and individuals who are “different.” In such a social environment, LGBTQ+ cultures and communities have a space to survive and develop. Some participants shared moving from rural regions to metropolitan cities in order to seek more acceptance. Participants reported that their self-acceptance improved in this relatively inclusive environment. For instance, Peng, a 28-year-old man who identified as undecided between gay and asexual, shared the following:\n\nThe environment (Beijing) is more tolerant here, so we feel freer. There are activities or workshops held in the community where we can improve our self-acceptance and make new friends. Since we have such advantages in Beijing, I think we should work together to do something and build up the community.\n\nIncreased openness over time reflected the changing social climate in China and worldwide. Participants who are elder witnessed the evolution of societal attitudes toward sexual minorities over the past decades. Participants also observed a shift in the mindset of the younger generation in the sexual minority communities, which enabled them to liberate themselves from the constraints of heteronormative culture and hegemonic masculinity. Ju-long, a 50-year-old gay man, described:\n\nThe concept of gay came into my consciousness around 1988 or 1989. It was the initial phase of the Reform and Opening-up in China when the society still found it difficult to accept sexual minorities. As the reform deepened, the media started to cover stories about sexual minorities from an affirmative perspective. Then, I learned about the LGBTQ protests and movements in other countries, and this was an international trend…Nowadays, more and more sexual minorities participate in community activities in China, and there are even LGBTQ clubs in college. This is big progress.\n\nDevelopment of the Internet and social media promoted participants’ self-understanding and connections with other sexual minorities. The Internet was particularly meaningful for participants who grew up in small cities, towns, and rural areas, where sexual minorities tend to remain hidden and local resources are rather limited. Participants indicated that they made contact with other sexual minorities through online forums and messaging software before the age of the smartphone. Thereafter, social media provided space for online community building.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current study examined the experiences of sexual identity development among Chinese sexual minority men from a comprehensive and contextualized perspective. Using thematic analysis, the findings demonstrated that the identity development process is embedded within a sociocultural context, and furthermore highlighted the factors that facilitate this process. Extant literature has made an important contribution to the understanding of the impact of HIV, psychopathology, and minority stress on Chinese sexual minority men (e.g. Sun, Budge, et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2017). But another side of the spectrum, Chinese sexual minority men’s positive experiences, has been largely overlooked. This research provides new insight into the sexual identity formation process among Chinese sexual minority men and highlights implications for relevant clinical intervention.\n\nConsistent with previous research (Li et al., 2010; Song et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2006), participants experienced confusion, anxiety, and other negative feelings which manifested in the form of internalized homophobia, as a response to their initial awareness of their attraction. Interpersonally, one might experience social isolation and withdrawal. Similarly, participants also explored their sexual identity, gradually experienced self-acceptance, and developed a positive self-image through social contact with other sexual minorities and the LGBTQ community. In addition, similar to previous findings on identity integration (Cass, 1979; Pfeffer, 2014), an individual’s acceptance of their sexual identity promotes a sense of group membership among Chinese sexual minority men, and the sense of group membership, in turn, supports the individual’s sexual identity development.\n\nUnique findings were also observed in the identity formation process of Chinese sexual minority men. One notable result of the current study is the critical role of romantic attraction and relationships as the context for identity development. During the identity exploration process, romantic relationships serve as an important avenue for helping participants to understand their sexual identity. Emotional experiences in same-sex romantic relationships, such as achieving happiness when dating a man, helped the participants to accept their sexual identity. A possible explanation might be that Chinese sexual minority men are more likely to define their sexual identity through romantic relationships (Wu, 2003; Sun, Pachankis, et al., 2020). That is, Chinese sexual minority men may be more likely to explore and understand who they are in the context of how they relate to significant others. It has been suggested that the concept of identity is essentially established and made meaningful via interpersonal relationships in China (Quach, 2014), thus constituting a “self-in-relation”. The self-identity in traditional Chinese culture was defined as a “process of becoming”, which involves “a process of developing, of connecting and of relating” (Cheng & Berman, 2012, p.115). Therefore, self-identity in China is considered as the focal point of a web of relationships connecting an individual to other important people in the individual’s environment (Yang, 2006). It can be postulated that this construction of identity may have influenced participants’ approaches to exploring and forming sexual identity.\n\nWhen participants worked toward identity acceptance and commitment, a meaningful finding is concerned with the role of identity disclosure in the developmental trajectory. It is widely believed that identity disclosure is a core developmental milestone and an indicator of an individual’s commitment to sexual identity for sexual minorities (e.g., Bishop et al., 2020; Quach et al., 2013). However, in the context of China, this topic should be discussed with discretion. In the current study, some participants indicated that they carefully chose their confidants for their coming out, and others indicated that their identity disclosure was pressure-driven (e.g., “it was hard to make up any more excuses for not getting married”; noted by Yan-yan, a 35-year-old gay-identifying man). In the Chinese context, both coming out as well as identity concealment may be appropriate coping mechanisms in response to stressors in the direct environment of sexual minority men and in the heteronormative social context (Sun, Pachankis, et al., 2020). Moreover, after analyzing the potential costs and benefits, some participants decided not to come out, as doing so may put them in a more vulnerable position and lead to unforeseeable consequences that they are unable to bear. This result was consistent with previous findings in the Chinese context (e.g., Huang & Brouwer, 2018; Song et al., 2021, Sun, Budge, et al., 2020; Wei & Liu, 2019). Thus, identity disclosure might be an essential step in identity development for some sexual minority men, though not all.\n\nFurthermore, family relationship is a significant consideration in the identity development process for Chinese sexual minority men. This is also the case in other cultures (Katz-Wise et al., 2016; McConnell et al., 2016), yet perhaps even more so in the Chinese context. Historically, the Chinese family has been a closely bonded unit that defined social responsibilities, offered job opportunities, arranged marriages, and provided social protection (Kong, 2019a), and it may be incorporated into one’s self-identity (Hu & Wang, 2013). It was argued that Chinese sexual minorities face “double closets,” meaning that heterosexism is prevalent in society and filial piety in the family realm (Kong, 2019b). Furthermore, the one-child policy implemented in 1979 had a multifaceted impact: on one hand, it intensified individuals’ pressure to meet the filial expectations; on the other hand, it also strengthened the emotional attachment between the child and the parents (Wong, 2015). Consequently, sexual minorities can experience shame and guilty if failing to fulfill their filial obligations. Chinese sexual minority men may be more burdened than women due to the tradition of patrilineal descent (Shao et al., 2018), a kinship system that preserves men’s power and privilege.\n\nIn this study, some participants concealed their identity, and one major reason for this concealment was that, rather than fearing rejection, participants believed that they had a responsibility as a son to protect their parents from being hurt by the truth, which concurs with the findings of a previous study carried out in China (Sun et al., 2006). Filial piety has likely been internalized by these participants and become an important piece of their values. It is believed that in fulfilling the responsibilities of a son, a Chinese man should take good care of his parents, both mentally and physically (Hu & Wang, 2013). In addition to this cultural norm, participants might have formed a strong emotional connection with their parents, so they genuinely wanted to avoid bringing anything hard to accept to their parents. Previous studies also found that some Chinese sexual minority men believed identity disclosure was “selfish and inconsiderate” to their family (Sun et al., 2021) and some were willing to fulfill their roles required by filial piety and took pride in it (Kong, 2019a; Shi et al, 2018). For these participants, their family can serve as a source of both support and stress. Participants who decided to come out wanted to be accepted and also strengthen their relationship with their parents. Some participants took their parents to the groups held by PFLAG China with the purpose of alleviating their parents’ concerns and restoring harmony in the family while also being accepted and supported by them. For many Chinese sexual minority men, sustaining family bonds is at least as equally important as being accepted for who they are, especially when the external environment is non-affirming and distressing. Thus, having structural support for not only sexual minorities but also their family is key in China.\n\nOne unique contribution of the current study is that it identified the factors that facilitated the development of sexual identity among Chinese sexual minority men, which has rarely been examined. It was discovered that acceptance and support from others as well as environmental support are two major facilitative factors for the process. The positive role of acceptance and support from others in sexual identity development was consistent with previous research (Shilo & Savaya, 2011; Sanscartier & MacDonald, 2019), which found that the acceptance and support from family, friends, and community members significantly facilitated self-acceptance and identity disclosure, and alleviated mental distress among sexual minorities. However, in the context of China, environmental support has not yet been studied. It has to be acknowledged that the cultural and socio-political environment of China causes multiple dimensions of inequity and challenges for sexual minority men, including but not limited to the stigmatization of same-sex relationships, interpersonal rejections and marginalization, and governmental restrictions (Miles-Johnson & Wang, 2017; Sun, Budge, et al., 2020). Nevertheless, environmental factors may assert power in both negative and positive directions. The current study found that positive changes participants witnessed in the environment, such as inclusiveness in major cities, increased openness over time, as well as the development of the Internet and social media over the past decades, allowed sexual minorities to actively explore their sexual identity, become more visible, and form a sense of community via physical and Internet-based avenues. A relatively more inclusive and open social environment, as well as the support of the LGBTQ+ community, motivated many participants to become highly involved in community activities in an effort to promote greater social change despite the restraints. Many worked as volunteers to hold community events, provided help with HIV tests, or interned at LGBTQ organizations. Progress in a society cannot be achieved without the efforts of members of the LGBTQ+ community, and this should be noted and documented. As the social environment is often discussed in a dichotomized matter (either good or bad), the findings suggest the need to understand the Chinese context for sexual minority men by adopting a more nuanced approach.\n\nLimitations and implications for future research and clinical practice\n\nThere are limitations to the current study. First, we focused on sexual identity development among sexual minority men in China in general instead of exploring specific subgroups, and there may be unique processes for men in subgroups that have not been identified by this research. Second, participants recalled their relevant experience of sexual identity in one interview, and this method may be prone to recall bias. Longitudinal data collection and regular follow-ups with sexual minority men, from youth to adulthood, would have provided a more comprehensive picture of the trajectory of sexual identity development.\n\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the findings of this study have direct implications for researchers and counseling psychologists conducting therapy. First, future research should investigate how identity development and facilitative factors for sexual minority men in China may relate to mental health and sexual risk behaviors. For instance, as participants in our study reported that they had difficult emotional experiences (e.g. fear or shame) when they first recognized their attraction to men, the initial awareness phase may be a particularly challenging time for maintaining a healthy level of self-esteem and well-being. Second, the results highlighted the relevance of an ecological perspective in sexual identity development. Therefore, future research may wish to further explore how larger sociocultural and policy factors may be implicated in identity formation and health among sexual minorities in China. These factors may include access to inclusive sex education, a city-level climate regarding LGBTQ populations, and LGBTQ representation in the media. Interventions that address structural stigma and promote environmental acceptance are also in need for development and evaluation. Third, future research may also investigate how experiences of sexual identity development may differ among subgroups of sexual minority men based on various characteristics, such as sexual orientation, age, area of residence (city, rural), etc. Fourth, longitudinal research would be a suitable method for understanding the trajectory of sexual identity development in this population.\n\nThe findings also have implications for clinical interventions with this population. Counseling psychologists who work with Chinese sexual minority men should aim to gain a contextualized understanding of their clients’ sexual identities. This may include gathering information about their client’s environment and relationships with family and important others. To promote an integrated sexual identity, counseling psychologists need to be attuned to where their client is in terms of identity awareness and exploration. As part of this process, counseling psychologists should normalize their clients’ experiences and difficulties, and explore potential resources and supportive factors with them. Mindfulness and acceptance-based treatment can also provide guidance for counseling psychologists regarding identity exploration and self-compassion (Stitt, 2014). Such approach can be used to assist clients with balancing their internal process of accepting their identity and external heteronormative pressure (Stitt, 2014). As noted by participants in the current study, an accepting societal environment is critical to sexual identity development. Thus, counseling psychologists should recognize their role as an active advocate for LGBTQ awareness and rights, both in their role as a therapist with individual clients and as a health professional who can advocate for and promote population health."
