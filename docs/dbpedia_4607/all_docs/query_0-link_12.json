        "meta_description": "Desperate for money, young student Lan Yu spends a night with businessman Handong. At first, Handong tries to minimise their interaction to a mere exchange of sex and favours, however, it soon becomes clear that they both harbour deeper feelings for each other. Despite their age and class differences, the two men develop a complex relationship with one another. Director Stanley Kwan tells the story of a clandestine love affair that took place in China at the end of the 1980s – the period between the economic crisis and the Tian'anmen Square protests. - This film is hailed as one of the most important queer films in Asian cinema.",

        "text": "About the Director\n\nStanley Kwan, together with Wong War-Kai, are some of the most important leading figures of the so-called Second Wave in Hong Kong cinema - a movement centred around the transitional period following the handover of the Crown Colony to the People's Republic of China. Kwan depicts the precarious situations in the 1990s in both his historical films as well as his moving melodramas. Because Kwan's parents had emigrated to Hong Kong, exile and homeland play a major role in his films. Kwan rose to fame in Hong Kong with his debut film NU REN XIN (WOMEN, 1985), and made international breakthrough three years later with YANZHI KOU (ROUGE, 1988). Kwan announces his homosexuality in his documentary on Chinese film history and won the Teddy Award at the Berlinale with YUE KUAI LE, YUE DUO LUO (HOLD YOU TIGHT, 1998).\"(edition Text+Kritik)\n\nPress Reviews\n\n“As a love story, Lan Yu brings to bear a thematic universality that renders the characters’ gayness incidental, or casually irrelevant.” (Fiona Ng, Indiewire)\n\nThe Director About the Film\n\n“Zhang Yongning was very moved by the story. He was very persuasive when he approached me with the project, and I felt that I could make this film. I asked him to let me read the novel first, and I was immediately taken aback by the first few chapters. Every single detail of lovemaking between the two men was depicted in very precise and explicit terms in the first few chapters, and it felt more like erotica rather than a love story at first."
