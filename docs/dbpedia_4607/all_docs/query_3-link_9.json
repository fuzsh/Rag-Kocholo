        "text": "Odyssey: a Chinese cinema season – 60+ films in 8 curated sections, 10 discussion panels, exclusive Q&As and 4 awards. A not-to-be-missed festival in the UK to celebrate international cinema!\n\nWith the aim to support more open communication in this turbulent and challenging age, Odyssey focuses on contemporary Chinese films in an extensive range of themes and genres to showcase the Chinese society’s diverse cultural elements and aesthetics to UK audiences.\n\n“The Emerging Waves” section brings the new generation’s independent, arthouse, and documentary productions that are made in China to a wider audience, to refresh the international perspective on China’s most recent trends in independent filmmaking. Six feature films will be screened in the section, available online between the 12th and 19th May.\n\nThis programme will also include two special offline screenings at the Picturehouse and The Prince Charles cinemas in London on 12th and 17th May. One of the two special screenings Lan Yu 4K, is among the best LGBTQ+ films that China has ever produced. It tells a romantic yet tragic love story of two men. The other one, River of Salvation unfolds a down-to-earth portrait of life in a small town in southern China, which draws enormous emotional power from the deeply buried history of millions of ordinary women and their everyday struggles.\n\nApart from these special offline screenings, four additional films will be shown online via Shift 72 from the 13th of May. Being Mortal reproduces the bitterness of life by depicting an Alzheimer’s patient’s family. The Fourth Wall is a story about self-salvation, in which the protagonist finds out about her “other” self by chance. The film creatively uses the parallel universe as a narrative technique to discuss how to reconcile with family, society, and ourselves. Black Tide Coast follows a poetic style, aiming to depict abstract emotions, ideas, and feelings beyond the control of the images. The Ark utilises documentary images to record the complicated relationship between individuals and society, science and religion during the period of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan.\n\n1.

In the summer of 2015, they made an appointment to meet in the Mountain of Yantai in Shandong province. So, Qin went there alone, waiting for Wu all night in vain. It turned out that Wu disappeared mysteriously. Qin was so absent-minded that she fell into the sea. Luckily, she was rescued by someone. Several years later, Qin commenced a tour from Dandong, Liaoning province, to the south along the coast, suffering from the tide and waves, but she kept thinking of Wu all the time. It was the summer in 2019, when Qin arrived in Bo’ao Town, on Hainan Island. She accidentally found a coastal café, named “Old House “, where every afternoon some old movies would be played. She was surprised to find that these films seem to be connected with Wu. At the same time, Qin noticed Lei Chen, the coffee shop waitress, because Chen was the one who formulated the screening program and had some seemingly strange relations with Wu. While they became familiar with each other in the process of sounding out, a drama crew emerged in the “Old House “. Qin happened to be the actor by chance in a repertoire, which would remind her of the innermost secrets …\n\nAbout Odyssey\n\nOdyssey aims to empower a shared appreciation of film, to create an inclusive cinematic experience, and to encourage cross-cultural understanding.
