        "text": "Chinese feminist cinema in the postsocialist era is shaped by the grand narrative of nation building that prioritizes economic development, transnational marketization, individual consumerism, and urbanization. As a result, it also becomes the contested site in which the postsocialist cultural discourse negotiates diversified gender identities and restructures subjectivity through the portrayal of female characters. The postsocialist conditions in China, therefore, refer not only to a historical period that starts roughly in the 1980s and lasts through the twenty-first century, when China witnessed unprecedented economic development and industrial modernization (since the implementation of the Reform and Opening-Up policy in Deng’s era), but also to a cultural politics in which “the residual socialist past and the emergent capitalist present concoct new imaginaries of a transitional society” (Lu 2007, 208). Postsocialist conditions in China are characterized by “the radical disintegration of traditional social fabric, the decentralization of power, the loss of moral and theoretical authority” (Zhang X. 2008, 7). Therefore, while postsocialist China prioritizes its rapid integration within the global capitalist system through economic marketization and modernization, it must also confront the challenges of maintaining both social stability and the legitimacy of its communist government.1\n\nCinematic representations of female gender identity in the last decade, contextualized within this postsocialist prioritization of economic globalization and urban consumerism, highlight the rising social and economic significance of what is popularly referred to as the Office Lady (OL 女白领). Representing a desirable part of the workforce in this newly globalized market economy, Office Lady characters are professional women from middle-class families who are well-educated, hardworking, and living in an urban environment. Such glamorization of urban women continues the politically correct, official gender discourse of the Mao-era, which emphasizes gender equality and women’s rights with such socialist slogans as “Women Hold Half of the Sky” (Funü neng ding banbiantian. 妇女能顶半边天). Yet this cinematic urban-feminism proves conspicuously inadequate as the increasingly widening gap between urbanity and rurality in social, economic, political, and cultural conditions renders the concept of “women’s cinema” deceptively homogenous. The majority of Chinese women, much like the majority of the entire population in China, live in rural areas or small towns, far away from and left out of economic and sociopolitical centers such as Beijing and Shanghai. Compared to their more fortunate sisters in the city, women from rural areas and underdeveloped regions enjoy far less social mobility and material comfort because the almost impenetrable class barrier that has resulted from the hierarchized dichotomies of urban and rural, postsocialist and socialist, and affluence and poverty. Living under the twin shadows of urban expansion and rapid transnational consumerism, women who come to the city from rural areas and small towns are restricted by the rigid hukou (户口) system of registered permanent residence, alienated by their awkward provincial dialects, commodified by their positions as menial laborers, and marginalized by the cultural and social vacuum that manifests a disturbing silence about this diasporic existence within the grand national narrative of modernization. With only slightly better financial circumstances than their rural sisters back in their hometowns, these migrant women drift from city to city in search of better work opportunities and living conditions. Deeply displaced by postsocialist economic development, migrant women laborers are disenfranchised during an urbanizing process that is embedded in the nation building initiative, and they are invisible from a popular cinema that glamorizes globalization, transnationalism, and metropolitanism. Because of their low socioeconomic status, these women are disproportionately underrepresented in contemporary films and therefore deeply marginalized in cinematic gender representations.\n\nAmong non-urban women, there is an even greater multiplicity and diversity of ages, regional differences, ethnic backgrounds, marital statuses, levels of education, and sexual orientations than female migrant workers. The experiences, challenges, crises, and expectations of a young, unmarried, heterosexual Han woman from a rural area who attends college in the city are drastically different from those of a middle-aged, married, ethnic minority woman who can barely write her own name. While some films do depict the former—those women who “made it” in the cities—few, if any, films position the latter group at the center of their narratives. Such geo-economic, social, anthropological, and political inequalities characterize the social reality of the majority of Chinese women, who live in a non-urban environment. What such a diversified and heterogeneous population of women do share in common, however, is that they are rarely visually represented in commercial cinemas, or even on popular TV, and are conveniently reduced to the background of social development, both in real life and in popular media. As a result, their desires, crises, social identity, and gender consciousness become not only invisible but also irrelevant in the cultural production and articulation of female discourse. Such stereotypically flattened and dismissive misrepresentation of the heterogeneity of women in China has transnational relevance and urgency. As Pratibha Parmar succinctly points out, media reconstructions of Asian women are politically contextualized and racially specific in the sense that “whereas white women are visible through the imagery provided through mass advertising and the popular media, Asian women either remain invisible or appear within particular modes of discussions which utilise assumed and unquestioned racialised gender roles” (2010, 388). In other words, the global unevenness of feminist conditions is determined by the combined hegemony of a Eurocentric ethnic discourse and a patriarchal racist narrative, which inevitably hierarchizes according to an intricately layered algorism that privileges according to race, ethnicity, economic status, social mobility, gender orientation, and cultural identity. Therefore, the specificities of contemporary Chinese cinema notwithstanding, its formulaic prioritizing on metropolitan women is unmistakably symptomatic of a globalizing commercial cinema.\n\nThe media’s overemphasis on urban women and disregard of their non-urban counterparts in contemporary feminist cinema demands an alternative cinematic feminism that visualizes and engages the pluralized, fragmented, and diversified conditions of Chinese women. While a growing number of alternative feminist films have recently given significant expression to female characters whose life trajectories are triangulated by the intersections between urbanity and rurality, globalization and tradition, and desire and crisis, most have sunk to anonymity due to little critical attention and negligible box office revenues.2 However, among these films, Li Yu’s Lost in Beijing (2007, Pingguo 苹果) and Li Yang’s Blind Mountain (2007, Mang shan 盲山) prove particularly critical, because they are not only commercially successful and politically aggressive, but more significantly socially engaging.\n\nBoth films were released in 2007, a year which marks China’s unprecedented economic boom—a result of a nationwide investment fever and grand-scale infrastructure development for the 2008 Olympic Games, hosted in Beijing. Given the context of a dominant (masculine) social discourse centering on real estate development, stock markets, and private ownership, these two films’ unusual focus on non-urban women and their gender and social crises is especially provocative. In other words, Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain reflect conscious and deliberate intellectual resistance to and reaction against urban-centrism in the uneven cultural production in postsocialist China. Both films obtained high visibility, commercial success, and international recognition via broad media coverage of their daring portrayals of female sexuality and gender consciousness, and both have been subsequently banned in China for this reason. Blind Mountain received wide international acclaim, winning the Grand Prix at the Bratislava International Film Festival in 2007, and FACE award at the Istanbul International Film Festival in 2008 for director Li Yang. Lost in Beijing, meanwhile, attracted major viewership thanks to its stellar cast of Fan Bingbing, Tong Dawei, Tony Ka Fai Leung, and Elaine Jin, all hugely popular film and TV actors whose star power in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan guaranteed not only box office profits, but also critical and scholarly attention. Most significant to our investigation, however, is that both films were made by independent filmmakers whose cinematic style, social critique, aesthetic representation, and political discourse become especially poignant due to their outsider vantage point and relative creative freedom. Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain, therefore, mark a significant shift for Chinese independent films in terms of problematizing the cinematic homogeneity of women’s representation and challenging the dominant narrative of nation building and a globalized consumer economy.\n\nUsing Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain as case studies, this essay investigates how Chinese independent films re-negotiate female gender identity and crisis through commercialized visual realism and social intervention, while the postsocialist grand narrative of nation building redefines the living conditions of female migrant workers and other women of limited resources. In these films, urbanity and rurality are represented in terms of social space and economic status as shaped by the frictions between rapid marketization and metropolitanism in the cities. Such frictions are symptomatic of an “incompleteness of modernization in the countryside” (McGrath 2008, 116, italics original) where the achievements of marketization come with the burden of limited productivity and resources in less developed areas. This incomplete and uneven state of modernization and economic development in rural regions is often characterized by cinéma vérité-style realism in Chinese independent films that attempt to present the unadorned truth of the struggles, desires, and crises of non-urban females as they encounter postsocialist changes to their country in their interactions with urbanites.\n\nLost in Beijing and Blind Mountain represent two different moments in independent Chinese cinema: while Lost in Beijing attempts to maintain a balance between high production value, commercial success, and artistic independence, Blind Mountain insists on visual realism and creative independence without appearing to be radical in its social and gender critiques. As “the first fully commercialized production” (Yu 2008, 62) by producer Fang Lizhi, Lost in Beijing’s all-star cast and high-profile marketing campaign made it a commercial success, with a box office revenue of RMB 20 million (USD 3 million). The cast of Blind Mountain, on the other hand, consisted of only one professional actor (a new graduate from Beijing Film Academy), and almost no marketing, so its reputation was achieved primarily via word-of-mouth advertisement. These dissimilar approaches notwithstanding, both films became models for emulation in their own sub-genres, and sources of inspiration for Chinese independent filmmakers.\n\nHighly controversial subject matter, focus on non-urban women, poignant social critiques, and strong sexual content are Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain’s most salient points of intersection. The critical discourses on both films are reflective of the government’s distaste for explicit female sexuality and sexual violence, and the social and intellectual debate on how the issue of feminism should be visualized in popular entertainment. Many scholars and popular culture critics question the social values and gender politics portrayed in Lost in Beijing, pointing out the film’s excessive sex scenes (Wang H. 2008, 27–28; Xie 2008, 10–11; Wang Z. 2008, 132–136), negative representation of contemporary Chinese society, and degrading morality (Ding 2008, 55–57; Lu 2007, 55). While no less daring in its representation, Blind Mountain receives little protest against its blunt visualization of sex and violence, but is faulted for oversimplifying the cause of its protagonist’s abduction (Yu 2008, 31; Wong 2012, 66), an evasive political stance, and an ineffectual condemnation of social injustice and crimes against women (Zhang J. 2007, 84; Ye 2007, 62). However, these critics overlook the deeper implications of Lost in Beijing’s audacious sex scenes and Blind Mountain’s refusal to impose moral judgment: both films employ a commercialized realism as a politicized representational strategy that exploits female gender issues for their embedded socio-economic discourses and transnational marketability.\n\nThough daring and relentless in their employment of documentary-style visual realism to simulate authenticity and immediacy, Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain fall short of initiating an alternative feminist cinema that reflects the realities of the non-urban women whose identities are in constant crises as they negotiate class, gender, and autonomy in a postsocialist world “fraught with experiences of fragmentation and anxiety in addition to the awakening of new desires and identities” (McGrath 2008, 2). More specifically, while both films contextualize their narratives within disjointed postsocialist realities, they prove inadequate in their representations of women as subjects with social gender agencies, since both films fail to explore non-urban women’s conditions as shaped by the intersectionalities of these postsocialist realities. Rather, Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain are powerfully reminiscent of films about women in the last century in their self-orientalizing and performatively eroticizing cinematographic techniques and visual styles, similar to Zhang Yimou’s earlier productions, including Raise the Red Lantern (1997) and Not One Less (1999), and other Fifth Generation directors’ works, such as Ermo (1994) by Zhu Xiaowen. Thus, as Shuqin Cui rightfully argues, non-urban women “remain a body image rather than a subjective entity” (2010, 191). Despite Lost in Beijing’s bold visualization of sexuality and Blind Mountain’s stark portrayal of rural lives, their stylistic and artistic expressions nonetheless reveal narrative and thematic resemblance to women’s cinema in the 1990s. The women in Li Yu and Li Yang’s films are still eroticized, silenced, and commodified.\n\nPoliticizing Discourse: An Alternative Feminist Cinema\n\nContextualized within the political narrative of economic transnationalism and national modernization, Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain form a poignant diptych whose juxtaposition accentuates the regressive gender politics and fossilized gender inequality in China. Both Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain exert their claim on realism by adopting true stories as the films’ plots, but neither adequately interprets or illuminates non-urban women’s identity crises in their gender discourse. Each film dramatizes socially marginalized and economically disenfranchised female characters that are hopelessly and helplessly at odds with their social conditions, permanently suspended between the enclosure of centripetal rurality and the exposure to centrifugal globalization. While Lost in Beijing explores female migrant workers’ identity crisis as a result of physical displacement, emotional estrangement, and psychological disassociation buried under the grand narratives of economic development and nation building, Blind Mountain magnifies the invisibility of rural women and the shockingly uneven development of contemporary Chinese society to a painful degree, as the victim-turned-victimizer protagonist is caught between an urban feminism and patriarchal gender stereotypes deeply ingrained in agricultural rurality.\n\nBoth Lost in Beijing and Blind Mountain are laudable attempts to remap contemporary Chinese cinema’s feminist exploration and practices, but neither initiates public attention for the right reasons: both use daring sex scenes that involve female nudity, which serves as an ironic proof of women’s commodification and subordination to masculine social expectations and conventions, as a marketing ploy. While the lack of audience interest, which often results in unsatisfactory box office returns, may be one explanation for commercial and mainstream cinema’s disinterest in featuring migrant workers as protagonists, independent films become a fitting production mode for an alternative feminist cinema because of their shared focus on politicized identity, peripheral position, and unconventional visual representations. As the career trajectories of several contemporary Chinese filmmakers, such as Jia Zhangke and Wang Xiaoshuai, demonstrate, independent films provide a necessary detour on the journey to mainstream commercial films. The intrinsic gender politics, class discourses, social hierarchies, and power dynamics that contextualize the representation of underrepresented, underprivileged, and undervalued female migrant workers and country women guarantee a moral high ground that legitimizes independent films and attracts international film awards and critical recognition from abroad. Such socio-political consciousness is often visualized in cinematic and cinematographic realism, in the sense that the camera facilitates a raw, unedited visuality that closely mimics the immediacy and transparency of documentary and news broadcast. By creating a cinematic realism that manifests as faithful to and critical of reality, independent films consciously attempt to promote an alternative feminist cinema using women in the periphery of market economic discourse as tropes of uneven social change and its debilitating consequences.\n\nHowever, stereotyping non-urban women and their anxiety and crises as symptomatic of social injustice and economic inequality incurs the danger of normalizing a “women-nation polarity” where “woman serves as a figure of the oppressed, bearing external invasions and domestic problems… and a symbol of a component in the building of the new nation-state” (Cui 2003, 174–175). In other words, when non-urban women are conceptualized and represented as merely reflecting and exposing socioeconomic problems as a default position, they forfeit any hope of negotiating subjectivity and constructing gender identity with agency because such demands become synonymous with generalized national discourses on social stability, institutional intervention, and government involvement. Thus what appears to be a postsocialist cinematic feminism that addresses non-urban women’s issues becomes inseparably embedded in the universal masculine nation building discourse, re-incorporated within the existing framework of dichotomizing gender politics, and de-legitimized from its pursuit of an alternative cinematic feminism that engages women whose subjectivity is both compatible with the changing socioeconomic landscape and reflective of female agency.\n\nIn light of these political, social, and gender inadequacies, the creation of a truly alternative feminist cinema demands a paradigmatic shift that de-iconizes women as representative of social problems. In other words, when female characters’ pursuit of subjectivity and feminist gender agency are subordinate to normalizing discourses that explain away women’s issues with generic references to social unevenness, such issues are necessarily rendered invisible. Specifically, an alternative feminist cinema engages non-urban women and their gender crises through the “criterion of class and not the particular criterion of nationality or nativism” (Grossman 2009, 146) to acknowledge the diversity of women even as their social identity and gender subjectivity are increasingly circumscribed by the socio-political indicator of class. Despite the plethora of scholarly discussions on Chinese cinema, there has been a collective critical aphasia on class representation and how actual class differentiation (resulted from uneven economic formations) effectively changes the cultural landscape of contemporary Chinese cinema. This is largely because of the official narrative’s reluctance to define Chinese society with class distinction in political terms. Instead, the rather ambiguous, politically correct term “people” is adopted to homogenize a society that is rapidly stratified by diverse economic, cultural, and geographic backgrounds. Yet this political homogenization proves lacking for accurately describing the acutely present issues of increasingly greater gaps between the rural and the urban in all aspects of people’s lives, particularly when rural poverty and social backwardness become the primary reason for rural women’s migration into metropolises where their physical labor, female bodily autonomy, and personal desires become marketable and consumable.\n\nThis conscious focus on socio-political class stratification and mediated representation of recognizable class differences captures the underlying cause of non-urban women’s crises and unveils the politicizing nation building discourse that regulates non-urban women’s negotiation for gender agency. While such a thematic shift employs cinematic realism for its transnationally marketable visuality and affective aesthetics, visual realism should be used only as a formal device and not a substantive expression of the narrative; that is, a documentary-style visual representation should be the medium rather than the message itself. Thus, while visual realism renders gender expression “unsettling,” as director Li Yu proudly announces (Sun 2007, 70), an alternative feminist cinema must also cognitively translate such raw and disruptive visuality into analyzable gender narratives and expressions in order to build its own gender and political discourse. The alternative feminist visual discourse obtains vitality and sustainability not by positioning non-urban women at the opposite end of dominating masculine gender dynamics and reducing the diversity of this population, but by recognizing that the cause of the crisis is complex and multifaceted (and sometimes nebulous and problematic), and engaging the issue of non-urban women’s gender consciousness as embedded in the nation building discourse.\n\nA strategic disengagement with such genderized dichotomies of urban/rural, center/marginalized, and privileged/disenfranchised potentializes a polycentric and pluralistic feminism and its visual expressions within a transnational context. The refusal to adhere to such essentializing and simplifying binary oppositions creates a critical space where discourses of female identity, feminism, and gender politics as historicized and relational, rather than totalitarian and conclusive, can flourish. Therefore, a conceptual departure from these regulative and normalizing logocentric systems that seek to contain a progressive feminist discourse within the perimeters of the isolated constants of gender, class, ethnicity, nation, and sexuality promises to lay the foundation for an alternative feminist critique that is truly empowering and liberating. While feminist cinema is inevitably contextualized by narratives of nation, subjectivity, and crises, an increasingly polycentric world demands a reimagining of the female identity as palimpsestic and always in flux. This critical approach “asks for a transnational imaginary that places in synergistic relations diverse narratives offering prospects of crucial community affiliations” (Shohat 1998, 52), so that the investigations of gender plurality, heterogeneous feminism, and polycentric female identities within a national cinema become mobilizing analytical apparatuses that are crucially relevant in a global context. While our current investigation of an alternative Chinese feminist cinema relativizes the global and the local, it proves illuminating to other communities of feminine articulations beyond the dissolving confines of geopolitical nation-states.\n\nIn light of this relational feminist critique, Blind Mountain and Lost in Beijing’s attempts to defy the monolithic masculine narrative of nation building and economic globalization collapse because they fail to dismantle the debilitating gendered binaries that cease to be paradigmatic in the transnational world. Each film utilizes visual realism for its respective political agenda: Blind Mountain commercializes Bai Xuemei’s struggle to escape her captivity by exploiting the shocking visceral representation of her devastation, and Lost in Beijing commodifies Pingguo’s female body via sexual excess and gender subordination. Neither film transforms cinematic realism into empowering articulations of gender subjectivity. Bai Xuemei and Pingguo represent two different trajectories in a centrifugal momentum that characterizes the process of urbanization and industrialization: while Pingguo’s hinted-at departure from the city seems an ever-so-slight suggestion of her disengagement with the subjugating urban masculine gender politics, Bai’s violent relief from captivity without her child potentializes a far more nuanced social critique of the institutional cause for her sufferings. Thus, Blind Mountain and Lost in Beijing manifest cryptically orchestrated cinematic representations that strategically equate the gender crisis with social crises, and thereby remain evasive on the ultimate issue of non-urban women’s problems. This silence neutralizes the films’ power for a potentially disruptive gender politics.\n\nNotes\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nThe author has no competing interests to declare.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nJinhua Li is Assistant Professor of Chinese Studies and Language at the University of North Carolina Asheville.
