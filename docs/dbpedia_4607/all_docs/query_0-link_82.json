        "text": "This chapter applies the critical scholarship of homonationalism to Sinophone contexts, and explores unfolding contestation over nation-state boundaries and imaginaries as China (officially People’s Republic of China, PRC) seeks to advance its dominant presence in Taiwan (officially the Republic of China, ROC), Hong Kong, and other Chinese-speaking communities. Different from Western societies where liberal democracy reigns as the predominant governing tenor, legal protection and discursive recognition of queer subjects are limited at the state level in these societies (except in Taiwan, where same-sex marriage has been in place since 2019). For subjugated groups located in and/or coming from these backgrounds, uncritically adopting the framework of homonationalism can create a conceptual conundrum. On the one hand, they are pressured to take a “culturally essentialist approach” that denies the cross-border circuit of Western sexual discourses. On the other, they have to wrestle with a “queer vanguardist approach” that views social recognition via a liberalist lens that is not only unnecessary but also pernicious to queer subjects and radical potential of queer movements. In response, we utilize a homotransnational framework to foreground everyday struggles of LGBTQ groups living in Sinophone contexts and unravel the intra-regional dynamics of queer politics and competing nationalisms between the PRC, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This approach complicates Puar’s conception of homonationalism by focusing on emerging challenges that queer subjects are confronted with across national borders. It also helps us delve into the geopolitical struggles that span PRC, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the “liberal” West to develop a new understanding of the relationship between nation-states and gender/sexuality. As our analysis demonstrates, grassroots activists across Sinophone societies are not only able to find resistance space amid rivalries between overpowering imperial forces for survival, but also identify fissures and ruptures afforded by brewing geopolitical competition and turn them into opportunities for concrete change on local levels.\n\nThis article examines and compares the emergence of ‘‘gay’’ identities in Hong Kong and in China, with special attention to the linguistic appropriation and creation of identity labels that have incited new modes of sexual subjectivity and politics. It argues that while global queering has been taking place, what ‘‘gay’’ means in New York may not be the same as what it means in Hong Kong or China. More attention should be given to the twists and turns of transnational cultural flows that result in different forms of hybridized identity. In Hong Kong, a pejorative use of ‘‘gay’’ became prevalent when it was transliterated with the same pronunciation as gei. By contrast, in China during the era of opening up a localized hybrid brand of gayspeak which appropriates the English lexical item ‘‘gay’’ enables one to engage in a stylish and modernized presentation of self. To counter the derogatory meanings of gay=gei, Hong Kong people create the label tongzhi (‘‘comrade’’), which signifies cultural specificity and serves to provide a positive sense of sexual identity. Yet, whether gay or tongzhi, sexual minorities in Hong Kong and China continue to open up the identity category for debate. The proliferation of identity labels foregrounds the contested nature of identity and the diverse ways of imagining sameness and difference with the West.\n\nThis thesis engages with the praxis of diasporic Sinophone biopolitics across East Asia exploring travelling imaginaries, hybrid material cultures, and articulations of embodied difference striking across geopolitical and temporal boundaries. By considering the interfaces of ethnic Chinese across local cultures in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong inflected by globalizing influences, I question how a cohesive Sinophone identity outside mainland China might be nurtured and managed through a multicultural approach. Through the lens of literary works by Li Yongping (李永平), Kuo Pao Kun (郭寶崑), and Wong Bik-Wan (黃碧雲), this thesis investigates the heterogeneous formation of Sinophone identities calibrated by the time and place specificities of each articulation and lived practice. Each author articulates distinct yet intersecting perspectives towards the Sinophone body as one that is gendered and (de)sexualized and the sociopolitical consequences of linguistic hybridity at the crossroads of international margins and routes. The first chapter takes up Kuo Pao Kun’s Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral 《郑和的 后代》 (1995) to tease out Singapore’s multilingualism, racial hybridity, and the impact of the city-state’s language policies on ethnic Chinese identity. The second chapter will focus on Li Yongping, a Sinophone Malaysian author who emigrated to Taiwan, and the affective images of wandering, ghostly ethnic Chinese women circulating in his work. The third chapter delves into Wong Bik-wan’s short story collection, Tenderness and Violence《温柔与爆裂》 (1994), and her misogynistic perspective on the corporeal manifestations of Sinophone Hong Kong modernity. By attending to the physical and conceptual movements that these texts each represent and enable, close analyses of the figures populating all three works illuminate the power of gendered and subaltern bodies as they intersect with critical frameworks of postcoloniality and Sinophone studies. Taken together, this thesis argues that Sinophone synergies across diverse Sinitic communities create a space for interaction and negotiation to reevaluate the Chinese identity and “Chineseness” vis-à-vis tradition, cultural uniformity, geographical boundaries, geopolitical boundaries, biopolitical manifestations, and transculturation."
