        "text": "Women Reservists\n\nUS Marine Corps\n\nThe same bill which created the WAVES established a women’s arm of the US Marine Corps. Initially less well-received than in other branches, it took until February 1943 for the first of these women to join the Corps. Like in the Navy, women joining the Marine Corps were part of the Reserve force, and were fully part of the Corps. Attempts were made to come up with a cute, catchy name for women in the Corps, with suggestions such as “Glamarines,” “Dainty Devil-Dogs,” and “Sub-Marines” being a few. Despite his initial reluctance to have women join the Corps, Major General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the Corps, refused all nicknames, saying, “They are Marines. They don’t have a nicknames and they don’t need one…They inherit the traditions of Marines. They are Marines.” With that edict, women joining the Corps were simply referred to as Women Reservists, WR for short.\n\nUnder director Colonel Ruth Cheney Streeter, women began joining the Corps in February 1943. The initial response was overwhelming, and the first platoon to graduate from US Naval Training School did not even have complete uniforms. Learning from the mistakes the other branches had made, the Marines quickly put themselves together, and by the end of the war had over 18,000 members. Like in the Navy, Women Reservists were initially limited to stateside service, eventually being allowed to deploy to Hawaii and Alaska. Unlike every other branch, the Women Reservists did not allow African American women to join during the war. The first African American woman to enlist, Annie E. Graham, did so in 1949.\n\nThis Women Reservists’ recruiting video, Lady Marines, was created to help recruit more women into the ranks of the WRs. From the National Archives.\n\nSemper Paratus, Always Ready\n\nUS Coast Guard\n\nFollowing the lead of the other branches, the US Coast Guard’s own women reserve force was authorized in late 1942. They too had a need for women to fill roles currently filled by men, allowing those men to go to sea. The first director came from the WAVES, Lieutenant Commander Dorothy Stratton. The initial recruiting drive was successful, but recruiting for the least-known service was always a challenge. African American women were not allowed to enlist until October 1944.\n\nSmaller than the other service branches, the SPARs as they were known, had just 10,000 women in service from 1942-1946. By the end of 1944, recruiting had stopped, save for replacements or to fill positions requiring specialized skills. Although the Coast Guard fell under the jurisdiction of the US Navy during the war, SPARs, like their male counterparts, were trained in Coast Guard camps and specialty schools. As with the Women Reservists and WAVES, SPARs were only allowed to serve within the United States, Hawaii, and Alaska.\n\nThis SPARs recruiting video, Coast Guard SPARs, was created to help recruit more women into the ranks of the SPARs. From the National Archives.\n\nWomen Airforce Service Pilots\n\nIn September 1942, women first began to fly (as civilians) for the US Army Air Forces (USAAF). Twenty-eight women were in the first group of ferry pilots, called the Women’s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). A training program began shortly after, called the Women’s Flying Training Detachment (WFTD). As women graduated from the WFTD, they became WAFS. When the work these women pilots did began to expand past ferrying aircraft, the USAAF renamed the organization Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in the summer of 1943. Led by pilot Jacqueline Cochran, WASP were officially federal employees, and though they worked with the US Army Air Forces, were not members of any US military organization.\n\nThis group of female pilots, numbering just over 1,100, was responsible for ferrying aircraft from factories to airbases, towing aerial targets for gunnery practice, and testing aircraft. They flew everything from B-17s to P-51s. WASP pilots ferried over 12,000 aircraft, even flying some to distant theaters. Two women, Dorothea Johnson and Dora Daugherty Strother, tested the B-29 Super Fortress when some male pilots refused to do so. The WASP were disbanded in 1944 due to a surplus of male pilots and public pressure to give the work to those pilots.\n\nThe first half of this Army-Navy Screen Magazine details WASP service. From the National Archives.\n\nInitially, women were brought into the various services branches to take over positions deemed culturally appropriate for women in the 1940s—clerks, typists, receptionists, and communications. Each branch quickly realized that women were capable of many types of work, often doing specialized, detailed work better than their male counterparts. Women became mechanics (both vehicle and aircraft), parachute riggers, air traffic control operators, drivers, and some even became instructors teaching male service members specialties such as aerial gunnery. Women were assigned to roles which required top secret clearance, putting together intelligence information from around the world. In all, there were over 200 jobs available to women in service, providing them with skills that gave their postwar lives more possibilities.\n\nBringing women into a “man’s world” in the early 1940s was filled with challenges. The overwhelming mindset of the time was that women were needed at home to keep house and raise children. What would happen if they left? It wasn’t considered feminine to wear a uniform, despite all branches having feminine uniforms consisting of skirts, not slacks. First in service, WAACs (and then WACs) bore the brunt of negative feelings and publicity. Letters written by soldiers to their families were initially very negative toward women in the Army. Many servicemen, who had never even met a woman in uniform, were led to believe WACs were there solely to keep up morale, which led to a negative perspective. Rumors got so bad that at one point, some believed women in the service were nothing more than government sanctioned prostitutes. Naturally, with these false perspectives and bad rumors, many families did not want to see their daughters put on a uniform.\n\nMany women were treated with disdain not only by service members, but by service members’ families. The concept of freeing a man to fight was used by every branch as part of their recruiting, and many women joined because they truly felt it would help bring a loved one home sooner. But for those men and families who had men stateside, the idea that they would be “freed” to fight was quite frequently not an alluring idea. Many men would have preferred to stay in a safe job in the States. Not everyone in uniform wanted to fight. The idea that they were to be replaced by a woman to be put in harm’s way made some men and their families dislike women in uniform.\n\nWith the celebrations of VJ Day in August 1945, the future for women in the US Armed Forces became uncertain. They had served their country well—432 women were killed, 88 taken prisoner. Sixteen women were wounded in service due to enemy action and awarded the Purple Heart medal. For her action at Pearl Harbor, First Lieutenant Annie G. Fox of the Army Nurse Corps was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. The Bronze Star was awarded to 565 women, and nurses received 1,619 commendations, medals, and citations. With the end of the war, most branches severely cut back on the number of women in their ranks, some eventually disbanding entirely.\n\nThe largest of the women’s reserve units, the WACs, were able to retain a larger number of women after the war. In 1946, the Army requested authority to make the WAC a permanent part of the Regular Army. The bill was delayed, but finally passed in 1948—the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act. In 1978, the WAC was finally abolished, and all female members of the US Army were fully integrated.\n\nThe WAVES discharged most of their ranks after the war. A small number of WAVES were retained to assist with the Navy’s general demobilization, and upon the passage of the Integration Act, the US Navy became open to women as permanent members.\n\nWomen Reservists, numbering around 18,000 by the end of the war, were reduced to fewer than 1,000, but they too were released in 1946. In 1948, three women were sworn into the regular Marine Corps, and the Corps was once again open to women.\n\nThe SPARs were not retained, and all 10,000 were discharged by July 1946, but the service was reestablished three years later. In 1973, the Women’s Reserve was ended, and women were fully integrated in the US Coast Guard, although restrictions remained in place regarding what positions they could hold until 1978.\n\nDespite their hard work and sacrifices, WASPs did not gain veteran status until 1977. Finally recognized as part of the military, WASPs were able to obtain veteran benefits. The Integration Act opened up the newly formed US Air Force to women. WAC veteran Sgt. Esther Blake was the first woman to enlist in the US Air Force."
