Also this flag is used as a flag next to the national flag, not instead of it.\n\nNote that the Military Aviation of the Royal Netherlands Army wasn't active in the Netherlands Indies. The Military Aviation of the KNIL (Royal Netherlands Indies Army) was, which never had a flag.\n\nBTW, both sections merged when the KNIL was dissolved in the early 1950's after Indonesia became independent.\n\nMark Sensen, 2 Jun 2002\n\nI have corrected the blue colour.\n\nMiles Li, 22 Aug 2005\n\nRoyal Netherlands Airforce former flag\n\nimage by Miles Li, 22 Aug 2005\n\nThe Dutch Air Force former flag features the badge of the Order of William (Militaire Willemsorde), fourth class, awarded to the Air Force for service during World War II.
