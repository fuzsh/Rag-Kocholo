They assisted each other in the Dutch annexation of Japan in the WTO.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCreation []\n\nThe RNLAF was created by General Concorde on the 7th of February to secure the Netherlands Air Space and make it safe. It soon began to gain members and became quite active.\n\nFirst General Command[]\n\nThe first general command of the RNLAF was formed with Concorde in the middle. Concorde, of course, became the first CIC of RNLAF with LoneWolf737 as 2IC and ZÃ¼wling as 3IC. There were also other important generals such as Bgen. Manek (D-2)(RNLAF)(IAF) and Dawson. At this period the only war the RNLAF currently experienced happened, the Belgium Madness War.\n\nDecrease in Activity[]\n\nThe RNLAF became severely inactive starting from November. With Concorde becoming the only one active in the RNLAF. Concorde soon decided to take a break in GeoFS saying that she would come back within 3 years (by 2022).\n\nSecond General Command[]\n\nAfter the retirement of Concorde and RNLAF losing activity Dawson decided to take control of the RNLAF, even though it is considered illegal as neither Concorde or RNLAF members weren't notified of the situation. Dawson is known for leaving the RNLAF server for some reason and then never creating a new one.\n\nThird General Command[]\n\nNot long after Dawson supposedly took control of RNLAF Concorde came online on discord for a short visit. After she heard about the news of Dawson taking control of RNLAF with nor his or his high command's approval and soon appointed Supreme1004 as the CIC of RNLAF. Soon Dawson was forced to resign from the rank of RNLAF CIC and Supreme officially became the CIC of RNLAF. After Supreme took control he immediately started a massive server and rank remap. ACMshl. A. James became the 2IC who helped a lot with setting and reorganizing the server and Fluttert became 3IC. After that, he started a massive recruit which helped out regain its activity. After things settled down the RNLAF HC decided to start another remap which created the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Netherlands Space Office and Supreme went off to become the PM of Netherlands. James and Fluttert took the CIC and 2IC's spot. AMshl. Gurses is the RNLAF's current 2IC Until Concorde rejoined on the 3rd of March of 2020, when Concorde came out of retirement. ACMshl. A. James had retired for a brief period in August 2020, making Fluttert the new CIC. James. has recently come out of retirement, becoming the 3IC and the Netherlands CIO.\n\nForth General Command[]\n\nACMsh. A. James and ACMsh. Fluttert retired from the Royal Netherlands Air Force and MRP due to in real life issues. DPM. Supreme immediately began searching for a new RNLAF HC team. In result the RNLAF had a massive reforms on its squadron and HC team. The position of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister became non existent and PM. Concorde and DPM. Supreme stepped down and became the CIC and 2IC of RNLAF while AVM. Slap and ACdr. SpaceRage took the spot of 3IC and CIO of the Royal Netherlands Air Force.\n\nFifth General Command[]\n\nThe Forth General Command was considered to be a failure as RNLAF HC Activity decreased by a lot. How ever RNLAF was quick to respond with the situation. CIC. Concorde stepped down from the position of Commander in Chief retiring from RNLAF entirely while AVM. Slap, AVM. Phoenix and ACdr. SpaceRage retired as well. 2IC. Supreme became the CIC of RNLAF while Dylan became the 2IC of RNLAF along with EnZed becoming the 3IC of RNLAF. Furthermore Thunderbolt took the spot of AVM. This massive reform once again helped RNLAf regain its activity. With RNLAF stabilized there has been a few changes in the RNLAF such as 3IC. Enzed retiring from post. The fifth general command was finalized when CIC. Supreme stepped down from the rank of CIC handing it over to Dylan while he himself became Air Commodore Supreme. AVM. Thunderbolt became the new 2IC while AVM.Slap came out of retirement reclaiming the rank of AVM along with a promotion to 3IC. The Fight General Command showed major success with RNLAF winning strategic wars which further increased the reputation and capabilities of the RNLAF.\n\nSixth General Command[]\n\nThe Sixth General Command is considered to be the 'Golden Age' of the RNLAF, with CIC Dylan and King Konrad leading the RNLAF through victory after victory. Activity went up, as did recruiting. Dragon168 was the 3IC of the RNLAF before stepping down to allow Split to fill the spot. Soon after however, Volkel became 3IC and Leader of the Air Force and Navy. Dylan started as Queen of The Netherlands, before abdicating her throne to Konrad, and in turn she became the CDS. High Command saw many newcomers from other Air Forces, and the power began to be distributed. However, activity decreased little by little, and Dylan and Konrad both retired within days of each other, naming Prince Split to become King and 3IC Volkel to become the CIC of the RNLAF. Both Dylan and Konrad were awarded the Star of William, the highest honor in the RNLAF, and became Honorary RNLAF members.\n\nAchievements[]\n\nThe RNLAF has had many achievements in its long history, Some notable examples are:\n\n- Victory in Both Russo-Ukraine wars - Annexation of Belgium\n\n- Victory in the ATO-Warsaw Pact War - Annexation of Luxembourg\n\n- Victory in the Dutch-Anglo war - Annexation of Germany and Taiwan\n\nAnd many more\n\nRelations[]\n\nThe Netherlands is friendly with almost every nation in the UN, save for neutral relations with the GBE(Great British Empire)\n\nRoyal Canadian Air Force - Non-Aggression Pact\n\nFrench Air Force- Non-Aggression Pact, Defense Pact\n\nRussian Federal Aerospace Forces- Non-Aggression Pact\n\nItalian Air Force- Non-Aggression Pact\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force- Non-Aggression Pact\n\nUN United States Air Force- Non-Aggression Pact\n\nCountries Interested in relations should dm Konrad (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±)#7030\n\nDutch Royal Family[]\n\nThe Royal Family is now head by King Split after King Konrad retired and abdicated his Kingship.
