        "text": "1. There’s Been Debate About the ‘D’\n\nWhat the “D” in “D-Day” stands for has been a subject of disagreement among military historians and etymologists, according to the National World War II Museum. “Departed,” “disembarkation” and “decision” have all been raised as possibilities.\n\nProbably the most widely accepted explanation is that the “D” simply stands for “day” — specifically, the day on which a combat attack or operation is to be launched. “D-day” and “H-hour” designate the initial day and hour of an operation when those elements have not yet been determined, or where secrecy is essential, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History. June 6, 1944, therefore, is not the only D-day, but it’s the one that’s come to be known popularly as D-Day.\n\n2. It Was Initially Set for 1 Day Earlier\n\nSuccess on D-Day would require multiple weather-related conditions, including long days for maximum air power usage, a near-full moon to help guide ships and airborne troops, and tides strong enough to expose beach obstacles at low tide and float supply-filled landing vehicles far onto the beach during high tide. The tides needed to be rising at H-Hour and there had to be an hour of daylight beforehand for bombardment accuracy. Only nine days in May and June seemed to fit the requirements. Commanders settled on June 5, but unfavorable forecasts spurred Eisenhower to decide last-minute to switch D-Day to the early hours of June 6.\n\n3. Not Everything Went According to Plan\n\nDespite careful planning, Allied forces still had to improvise and adapt to overcome unexpected difficulties. Many of the airborne troops were widely scattered as they landed. Cloud cover interfered with the preliminary aerial bombardment. Rough seas meant that amphibious tanks intended to support the infantry were delayed or never made it to shore. However, chance sometimes favored the Allies. For example, U.S. soldiers landed at the wrong location on Utah Beach – in what proved to be a more lightly defended area than their original objective.\n\n4. Eisenhower Wrote a Press Release in Case of Failure\n\nIn the afternoon on June 5, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower scribbled a message on a pad of paper, intended for release in case the assault failed. The message (mistakenly dated July 5) said, in full: “Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.”\n\n5. Decoding ‘Enigma’ Helped the Allies Win\n\nThe Allies and the Axis powers both needed machines to turn military orders into secret codes. The Germans had a code machine known as Enigma, which was thought to be unbreakable — but a team of Polish and British experts successfully cracked the Enigma code.\n\nOfficials said the German codes intercepted before D-Day precisely pinpointed nearly all of the German fighting units in the Normandy area. On D-Day itself, the device also helped Allied commanders get word of their troops' progress quicker than through their own communication channels."
