In the present difficult circumstances this was in no sense an easy task.\n\nIt would scarcely be possible for me to mention by name all the people who have in various ways helped me in the preparation of this book. May I here, then, take this opportunity to thank them collectively.\n\nI must, however, make an exception for Mrs. Olive Renier, who not only gave me the utmost assistance as part of her normal work in the Netherlands Government Information Bureau, but who also, outside her official capacity, spared no pains to help me over the many problems which arose.\n\nA few of the photographs reproduced in the book have been taken from illustrations in the Netherlands periodical De Militaire Spectator. It was, unfortunately, impossible to obtain permission beforehand for their use. I hope and trust, however, that the editor will forgive me for taking this liberty. The rest of the photographs, however, were supplied by courtesy of the R.A.F. Nor can I conclude without expressing my gratitude for the wholehearted co-operation I received from this quarter.\n\nP. L. G. D.\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThe moment has not yet arrived when a complete picture can be given of the events which occurred in Holland during the \"Five Days' Campaign.\" The data which would be required for that purpose, both from Dutch and from German sources, are not available.\n\nIf, nevertheless, we endeavour in the following pages to present a brief account of these military operations, it is because it has been repeatedly observed that an erroneous view was widely held with regard to the course of events in that campaign, a view which in many instances has been made the basis of ill- founded criticism.\n\nThe pages which follow, therefore, are dedicated to those who, under difficult circumstances, willingly laid down their lives for their country, and to the body of expert military instructors who, in the pre-war years, were called upon to discharge the onerous task of training the Dutch people for the duties of war. These duties, indeed, owing to the long period of peace which had gone before, in which the people had enjoyed to the full the opportunities of cultural development, were particularly difficult.\n\nFinally, they are dedicated to all those in Holland who are dear to us, and who, in these years of stress, are being called upon to suffer for our omissions in the past.\n\n--3--\n\nI. THE TASK OF THE NETHERLANDS ARMED FORCES\n\nOn the 13th September, 1938, the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs declared, in the Assembly of the League of Nations, that Holland recognized no obligation, even under Article 16 of the League Covenant, to take part in any common action, or to permit the passage of foreign troops through its territory. Thus Holland had reverted to the old policy of independence which she followed before 1914.\n\nThe object of the Netherlands Government, in issuing this declaration, was to make it manifest to the entire world that in case of any conflict which might possibly arise in the future there was but one attitude to be expected from the Netherlands Government: that of strict neutrality towards all belligerents. This declaration was not, however, in the least meant to imply that the attitude of Holland in a future conflict would be limited to issuing a declaration of neutrality. On the same occasion, indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said: \"By arming itself as thoroughly as possible in order, with all the forces at its command, to defend its frontiers against any violation of its integrity, no matter from what quarter, and by thus being able to maintain an armed and effective neutrality, such a state does its national duty, and this attitude will at the same time best serve European interests.\"\n\nIn this way, therefore, the foreign policy of Holland was defined with perfect clarity. At the same time, moreover, the task which the forces at the disposal of the Government of the Netherlands would have to carry out was laid down. This twofold task consisted of:\n\nMaintenance of Dutch neutrality.\n\nDefence of Dutch independence against any attack from without.\n\nII. THE FORCES AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE KINGDOM\n\nDuring the period which immediately followed the world war of 1914-1918 the armed forces of Holland fell more or less into a decline. There were two reasons for this. In the first place many sections of the Dutch held over-optimistic views about the newly formed League of Nations and the general disarmament foreshadowed in connection therewith. The second reason was that during the long years of mobilization so many financial and personal burdens had necessarily been shouldered for purposes of defence, that throughout practically the entire nation there was reluctance to face further sacrifices.\n\nThe financial crisis during those years was also a contributory factor in reducing expenditure, particularly defence, to the lowest level.\n\nThe result of all this was that between 1918 and 1936:\n\nThe strength of the levies was reduced from 23,000 to 19,500; in the period 1920 to 1922 to as little as 13,000 men.\n\nThe cadre of professional officers and non-commissioned officers was cut down considerably.\n\nMany peacetime formations were abolished.\n\nThe period of first training for unmounted forces was reduced to five and a half months, and in the case of men liable to service, who had already taken part in preliminary military training, to as little as six weeks.\n\n--4--\n\nThe most essential supplies of material were neglected, or else were on so modest a scale that whole decades would have been needed for the attainment of anything like tolerable conditions.\n\nNor was this all. During those years when training and supplies were below reasonable limits, the state of preparedness had also fallen off considerably. The number of peacetime formations was cut down to such an extent that each formation had to be multiplied six or eight times to put it on a wartime basis. Such an expansion could not be carried out all at once. It required an intermediate phase in the form of pre-mobilization, in which the nuclei of the wartime formations had to be created. The general mobilization which followed shortly afterwards then raised the nuclei in question to full war strength. Owing to this fact the entire process of putting the forces on a war footing was prolonged for some days.\n\nIn the meantime, circumstances in the world around underwent a complete change.\n\nAfter power in Germany had passed into the hands of Hitler in 1933, there followed in rapid succession the events the object of which was to unite all German, or presumed German, territories in a \"Greater Germany\" and to put this state in a position to dominate the Continent.\n\nThe year 1935 began with the plebiscite in the Saar territory, as a consequence of which the Saar reverted to Germany.\n\nIn March of the same year Germany introduced the militia system, and in doing so threw over one of the most important provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The return to the militia system meant that within a few years the German armed forces would again have grown to such an extent as to rank among the most powerful in the world.\n\nJune witnessed the Naval Treaty with England, while in October of the same year Italy entered on the war against Abyssinia, a war which not only ended with the complete occupation of that territory, but also drew Italy, as a result, into the wake of Germany.\n\nThe Franco-Russian pact, concluded in the beginning of 1936, afforded some relief. It looked as if a balance of forces was in process of slowly coming into being on the Continent. The occupation of the Rhineland, however, destroyed any such expectations.\n\nOwing to the possibility of converting her western frontier into a strong wall of defence, Germany was able to provide herself with a defensive flank. This gave her freedom of action in the south and the east. The armies of the Western Powers would now no longer be able, in case of need, to come quickly to the aid of their hard-pressed allies in Central and Eastern Europe. It was once more possible for the German General Staff to operate on internal lines. In 1938 and 1939 the moment had arrived for Hitler to harvest the crop which had been sown during the preceding years. Austria, the Sudeten territory and later the whole of Czechoslovakia became his victims.\n\nItaly, which had now entirely been absorbed into the orbit of Germany and also wished to gather in her share of the profits, began her operation against Albania in the spring of 1939. Such was the position when, in the autumn of the same year, Hitler prepared for the next coup: the Corridor and Danzig. It was a coup which was to mark the beginning of a new world war.\n\nApart from the fact that the above events had prompted the Dutch Government to review its entire foreign policy, and, as has already been pointed out, to revert to complete independence, a review of the army policy adopted during the previous years likewise became inevitable.\n\n--5--\n\nIt was not merely the fact that day by day there was a greater likelihood of events developing in course of time into a military conflict in which Holland might be involved, but new factors emerged as regards the tactics and strategy to be expected in such a conflict.\n\nAmong these factors was the appearance of tank troops and motorized units in the organization of the Great Powers surrounding Holland, and also the immense growth of the air force.\n\nGermany in particular, in building up her new armed forces, included a number of armoured and motorized divisions in her organization. These units already possessed a very high degree of military readiness even in peacetime. Consequently the units in question could be called into action and employed in operations within a few hours. The same may be said of the powerful air arm, which was spread over a large number of airfields and was also in perpetual readiness.\n\nIf, in the light of these facts, we examine the condition of the Dutch forces (of which, during certain periods of the year, there were practically no trained soldiers at all in the barracks), it becomes clear that such conditions could not be allowed to endure and that, except at the cost of the abandonment of every possibility of successful defence of our territory, a change in the policy so far adopted as regards defence was essential.\n\nThis could not be more pointedly expressed than in the words which Minister Colijn addressed in 1936 to the representatives of the people: \"We no longer have an army; it will have to be created at the time of mobilization.\" In point of fact, having regard to the system then in operation, under which the nuclei of the formations had first to be created during the period of pre- mobilization and then raised to wartime strength during the general mobilization some time later, in order finally, during the period of concentration, to take up their war positions, at least four to five days were needed before the Dutch forces could be ready for fighting. It was clear to all that, under the circumstances then prevailing, there was nothing to justif\n\ny the belief that Holland would be allowed this period for undisturbed preparation. In 1936, therefore, there followed the change in the policy of defence, and this change finally received its confirmation in the Military Service Law of 1938. Under this law:\n\nThe strength of the levies was increased by 8,000 men, and thus raised from 19,500 to 27,500 men.\n\nThis extension had become essential in order to remedy the extreme anaemia from which the Dutch infantry was suffering.\n\nBut an army system requires time to become effective. As the war army was made up of fifteen levies, it would take fifteen years before this increase of strength attained its full effect. It was evident that a period of such length could not be reckoned on. In order to make up to some extent for this difficulty, it was decided that the 1939-1943 levies should comprise 5,000 additional men. For those years, therefore, the levies would amount to 32,500 men.\n\nThe period of service was fixed at eleven months.\n\nAs the infantry came to the colours in two batches every year, and as it may be considered that a soldier is suitable for certain forms of fighting after five months' training, the result of this measure was that one half of the infantry levy was always available as trained troops. From this trained portion of the levy twenty-four frontier battalions were formed. They were stationed close to the main roads into Holland, and their object was to repel an unexpected attack, and in this way to allow the Dutch forces sufficient time to mobilize and concentrate.\n\n--6--\n\nThe twenty-four battalions in question were, however, not sufficient for the discharge of this duty. Therefore an additional organization was created, by which certain sections could, apart from a general mobilization, be called to the colours separately in order to be available for this strategic measure. These sections also consisted chiefly of infantry units. They, however, likewise included the air force and air defence units. (As these units were called up by means of a telegram with the letter Q, they were everywhere known as Q sections). As regards the infantry, the Q sections consisted chiefly of older levies having their place of residence in the frontier territories.\n\nFinally:\n\nA defence fund was formed with the object of making good within the shortest possible time the great deficiency which existed as regards supplies of material.\n\nThe period during which the new Military Service Law was in operation before war came was too short to allow of complete success. Nevertheless its result was that on the second day of Easter 1939--the day of the Italian attack on Albania--the frontier battalions and the Q sections were able to take up their war positions, in order to safeguard a general mobilization which might take place later. This did not occur till the end of August, however, when the Dutch forces were raised to complete war strength. In the months September 1939 to May 1940 great efforts were made to improve training and efficiency to the utmost possible extent. Unfortunately little could be clone to make up for the shortage of equipment, the reason being that in this respect Holland was practically dependent on foreign countries. Among other things, the light howitzers ordered in Germany, which were so urgently needed to strengthen the divisional artillery, were only delivered in very small quantities, and even then practically without ammunition. At the outbreak of the conflict Holland possessed the following armed forces (see also Appendix I):\n\nFour army corps each consisting of: The staff. Two infantry divisions, each consisting of the staff, three infantry brigades, one machine-gun company, one regiment divisional artillery, consisting of the staff and three brigades (two brigades armed with field guns of 7 cm. and one brigade with 12 cm. or 15 cm. howitzers) and one company of pioneers. The army corps troops consisting of: One regiment of hussars, consisting of the staff, two mounted squadrons, four cyclist squadrons, one machine-gun squadron, one anti-tank squadron, one platoon of mortars, and one platoon of tanks. One regiment of army corps artillery, but consisting only of one brigade of three batteries armed with 10 cm. medium artillery. The army corps train.\n\nOne light division, consisting of the staff, two brigades of cyclists, two regiments of motor cyclist hussars, the corps of horse artillery, consisting of a staff and two brigades of artillery, armed with 7 cm. light field guns and the divisional train.\n\nTwenty-four brigades of infantry, made up of the older levies. These brigades were numbered from 23 to 46 inclusive; part of them were combined into brigade groups.\n\nTwenty-four frontier battalions of infantry.\n\nFourteen regiments of army artillery. These regiments were, however, to a large extent armed with obsolete material (guns of 8 cm. steel, 12 cm. length\n\n--7--\n\nand 15 cm. length 24, guns with rigid carriages, without recoil). The Fifteenth Regiment Artillery only was armed with the modern howitzer of 15 cm. length 15, and motorized. In the remaining regiments the guns were horse drawn, or else they were entirely non-mobile and could therefore only be used in fixed positions.\n\nA regiment of hussars consisting of the staff and four mounted squadrons.\n\nA number of detachments for the occupation of existing permanent works, and for guarding important objects within the country.\n\nDepot troops. The brigade of infantry consisted of the staff, three battalions of infantry, one mortar company and one anti-tank company.\n\nIn all, each infantry battalion had thirty-six light and twelve medium machine guns.\n\nThe infantry division, therefore, in the main possessed guns as follows:\n\n9×36 = 324 light machine guns.\n\n9×12 + 18 = 126 medium machine guns.\n\n3×12 = 36 anti-tank guns (the companies were, however, not yet at full strength).\n\n3×6 = 18 mortars of 8 cm. (3-inch mortars).\n\n2×12 = 24 7 cm. light field guns.\n\n1×12 = 12 howitzers of 12 cm. length 14, or 15 cm. length 17.\n\nAs regards the Air Force, there was one bomber squadron, one squadron for strategic reconnaissance and four squadrons of fighter aircraft. In addition the organization included five squadrons intended to co-operate directly with the ground forces.\n\nThe anti-aircraft defences consisted of a moderate number of batteries armed with modern weapons, Vickers and Bofors, supplemented by a number of batteries armed with fairly obsolete guns. In addition the organization included a number of independent platoons of anti-aircraft machine gunners. A number of these were combined into companies, allocated to the big units. Others were allotted the task of guarding important objectives in the interior.\n\nIf we consider the composition of the Dutch forces with a critical eye, the weak points necessarily strike us at once.\n\nWe may mention the following as the chief among them:\n\nInsufficient artillery power. The division with an infantry strength of nine battalions possessed only thirty-six guns, which were in addition not quite modern. The army corps artillery proper numbered only twelve guns. Altogether the army corps, with an organic strength of eighteen battalions of infantry only, had seven brigades of artillery--that is to say, about one-half of what is adopted as the normal in foreign organizations. True there were fourteen regiments of army artillery, but their weapons were so much out of date that, though they could be used on less important parts of the front, they were quite unable to provide the necessary artillery support at decisive points.\n\nInsufficient anti-tank weapons. In the organization of each brigade of infantry or cavalry regiment there was only one anti-tank unit, and even this unit was armed with only a few guns.\n\nEntirely inadequate anti-aircraft defence. In small countries, the air force of which cannot be expected, in the long run, to maintain a fight with the air forces of great Powers, it is essential in particular that the ground anti-aircraft defences shall not only be of specially great relative\n\n--8--\n\nstrength, but that they shall also be perfectly armed. In the Dutch forces neither of these conditions was fulfilled.\n\nInsufficient training of personnel.\n\nThe majority of the levies had only completed a first period of training, varying from five and a half months to six weeks, while in the years which followed repeat drill had only been practised for a short time and only once or twice. Owing to these circumstances manoeuvres on a large scale could only be held sporadically.\n\nIt need hardly be said that the Dutch Army Command were acutely aware of these weak points.\n\nThe circumstances to which the inadequate equipment of the forces was due have already been pointed out, with the added fact that when at last this inadequacy was generally recognized there was no time to make good the deficiencies.\n\nOnly the insufficiency of training could to some extent be remedied during the period between September 1939 and the outbreak of hostilities in May 1940. Notwithstanding all these deficiencies the Dutch armed forces were, when the conflict broke out, from the highest to the lowest, ready to devote themselves with complete self-sacrifice to the lofty task which awaited them.\n\nIII. THE GEOGRAPHICAL CHARACTER OF THE NETHERLANDS FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT\n\nHolland belongs almost in its entirety to the basin of the great rivers, the Meuse and the Rhine.\n\nAs regards the southern portion of the country, the high lying ground is south of the line Bergen op Zoom-Roosendaal-Breda-'s Hertogenbosch-Ravestein. The land here consists, however, of alternative heath and woodland, containing a number of clearings and settlements. Yet, generally speaking, this territory is far from presenting clear and open spaces, and it is therefore not very well adapted for military operations. On the border between Brabant and Limburg lies the entirely open area of the Peel. This was originally marshland, but the peat moor area has been partly cleared. Still, the land, off the roads, continues even now to be impassable for large masses of troops.\n\nIn Limburg the hilly land approaches very close to the Meuse at various points, the east bank of which is usually on a higher level than the west. South Limburg proper, an important Dutch industrial area, and the only place in Holland where coal is mined, is particularly hilly. The river Geul which cuts through this area is for the most part deep, but otherwise is not in any sense a considerable military obstacle.\n\nFrom the east there are a considerable number of roads running through Dutch territory to Belgium, but only four of them pass over the Meuse by means of bridges--namely, at Maastricht, Roosteren, Roermond and Venlo. From east to west the following continuous waterways are met with successively in the southern provinces, in the direction south to north:\n\nThe Meuse, duplicated at some points by the Juliana Canal. The Meuse, especially since it has been canalized by dams, has become a waterway of great military importance. A drawback, however, is that it lies only a few kilometres\n\n--9--\n\nfrom the German frontier, and that at various points the west bank is dominated by the east bank.\n\nThe Noorder Canal, joining on to the Peel area, and prolonged northwards by the Raam. The first-named canal is narrow and runs in part through wooded land. The Raam is not an obstacle of any importance, especially in its southern part, but the strength of this river for purposes of resistance can be increased at various points by means of flooding.\n\nThe Zuid Willemsvaart. The canal has high dykes on both Bides, while shrub land and inhabited areas extend over great distances along the banks. For this reason it is not very well adapted for a prolonged defence.\n\nThe Dommel.\n\nThe Mark.\n\nThe two small rivers last mentioned are of practically no importance as obstacles, and in addition they run to a great extent through woodland and inhabited places.\n\nFinally, there is a waterline from east to west in the form of the Wilhelmina Canal, running from Beek-en-Donk through Tilburg and Oosterhout to Geertruidenberg.\n\nThe area lying north of the high land of Brabant and south of the Meuse, especially north and north-east of 's Hertogenbosch, is entirely open. Only the Langstraat presents a narrow strip of groups of villages forming an almost uninterrupted line.\n\nThe territory lying between the rivers Meuse and Waal, and between the Waal and Lek, is generally speaking very open. Only the orchards, during certain seasons of the year, provide some cover against visibility from the air. The dykes along the river are high, while the roads generally speaking are narrow, stand out sharply and for the most part are located on the open dykes.\n\nPermanent bridges pass over the Meuse at Grave, Hedel, Heusden and the Keizersveer. Over the Waal, on the contrary, the only bridges are at Nijmegen and Zalt-Bommel, while the only bridges over the Lek are at Arnhem, Culemborg and Vianen.\n\nThe rivers are some hundreds of metres wide, and the rate of flow is such as to make crossing in small assault barges difficult.\n\nThe territory of Holland proper (the provinces of North and South Holland) lying north of the river area and west of the line Wijk bij Duurstede-Utrecht - Naarden, is a very open polder area intersected by innumerable ditches, channels and canals. The roads are generally open. Only along the coast, beginning at The Hague, and extending as far as the sea dyke at Petten, is there an area of dunes having a width of some kilometres. The approaches from the sea at the Hook of Holland and IJmuiden, and also the naval bases at Den Helder, call for special attention from the military point of view. Furthermore, the banks of the IJsselmeer, with the ports of Medemblik, Enkhuizen, Hoorn, Edam, Volendam and Amsterdam, constitute a gateway of attack for an enemy who has conquered Friesland, Overijssel or Gelderland, and is able from there to command the IJsselmeer.\n\n--10--\n\nSouth of the Nieuwe Waterweg extends the island territory of South Holland and Zeeland. These islands also are quite open. They, however, possess passive security in the great rivers and arms of the sea which wash their shores. The chief island in this territory is Walcheren, both because the approach to Antwerp is controlled from that point, and because Flushing is a seaport of some importance.\n\nSouth Beveland is joined to the mainland of North Brabant by means of a dam, with adjoining polders, while between Walcheren and South Beveland there is the Sloedam. South Beveland itself is intersected by the Hansweerd Wemeldinge canal, which canal, however, owing to the high dykes and the built-up areas around, is less suitable for a prolonged defence than the territory farther eastward at the Zanddijk, where the possibility of flooding may render an approach from the east exceedingly difficult.\n\nLikewise the land at Bath, the most easterly portion of South Beveland, forms a strong natural obstacle.\n\nThe eastern part of Utrecht and the Veluwe consists of undulating hilly ground. Extensive forests alternate with large open areas of heath and sand drifts. Between both these areas is the Gelder Valley, constituting the basin of the Eem and the Grift. This area also, in which extensive portions can be flooded, especially in the north, has natural defences of great strength.\n\nThe basin of the IJssel extends from Arnhem to Kampen. In the southern portion the high lands of the Veluwe approach very closely to the river, so that there the west bank dominates the east bank, which fact is very favourable to defence on an eastern front.\n\nFurther to the north the land is flat, and the river there is surrounded by high dykes. The river itself is of considerable width, and for that reason has great natural strength. Bridges connect the two banks at Arnhem, Doesburg, Zutphen, Deventer and Zwolle.\n\nThe Spankeren-Apeldoorn-Hattem-Zwolle canal is of little military importance. It is narrow and runs for a great deal of its length through wooded land and built-up areas, while in addition a destruction of the lock at Spankeren would drain the canal in some places.\n\nThe land lying east of the IJssel is very well adapted for an advance from an easterly direction. The waterways in this region flow from east to west, so that a continuous waterline in the direction south to north is not met with anywhere. The ground, therefore, is not very suitable for delaying actions. The Deventer Ð Raalte-Lemelerveld canal might be of some importance for this purpose, but it lies outside the most obvious line of advance for an opponent coming from the east. The Twente canals also run from east to west, so that these again are of little importance for the defence of the country.\n\nThe northerly provinces, as cattle-raising, agricultural and industrial regions, are of particular value in the defence of the country. Apart from the high land in Drenthe, the soil for the most part consists of peat land and clay. Thus, along the eastern border, from Gramsbergen, by way of Coevorden, Ter Apel and Stadskanaal, a peat area extends, intersected by ditches, channels and canals, and this is a kind of land which is very well adapted for delaying actions. Winschoten commands the whole of East Groningen as a bastion.\n\n--11--\n\nFinally in Friesland, entirely open, a natural line of defence is encountered in the old Frisian line of lakes extending from Sloten to east of Leeuwarden. The clay land lying north of this, however, affords a very good passage for troops and would require a very large number of men for prolonged defence.\n\nAnother important point for the defence of the country in this region is Zurig, the place where the outer dyke of the Zuider Zee which runs from the Province of Holland to Friesland reaches the coast.\n\nIV. THE NETHERLANDS PLAN OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe task which the Dutch forces would have to fulfil in case of a conflict was clearly defined by the foreign policy which had been specifically laid down -- namely:\n\nMaintenance of neutrality.\n\nDefence of the territory against any act of aggression.\n\nMaintenance of neutrality meant that at every point on the frontiers of the territory forces had to be present or at least available for being brought up speedily, in order to repulse those who might violate the country's neutrality. In practice, therefore, troops had to be maintained for this purpose at all important points on the frontiers or on the lengthy coastline. Frontier and coastguards, supplemented by naval and air patrols, played the chief part in carrying out this duty.\n\nThe defence of the territory, really the principal task, made quite different demands, however.\n\nOf necessity the aim was to defend every part of Dutch territory, as was in truth repeatedly declared by various Ministers at the assemblies of the States General. But the Dutch frontier is not only long--the eastern frontier alone, from Vaals to the Dollard, measured as the crow flies, has a length of about 400 km.--but, as has already been stated, the nature of the ground, owing to the absence of any natural obstacles, is such that lengthy portions are not in the least suited for prolonged defence. The same applies to the southern frontier, which has a length of fully 300 km., likewise without any natural protection.\n\nEven the waterway which would rank in the first place for a continuous line of defence with the eastern front--namely, the Meuse and IJssel with the Meuse - Waal canal lying between--has a length of fully 200 km., which means that a stubborn defence would require a number of troops exceeding many times that of the Dutch forces. Even the defence of the part of the IJssel between Arnhem and Kampen, with a length of 70 km., is a task beyond the powers of the forces available.\n\nTherefore the Dutch Army Command had necessarily to confine itself to the heart of the country, as regards continuous defence of the territory.\n\nEven in the past a line had been constructed for this purpose, the \"New Holland Waterline,\" later called the East Front of the Holland Fortress, along the line (from north to south) Muiden-Weesp-Breukelen, and then to the east of the town of Utrecht. Thereupon the line followed Schalkwijk-Leerdam-Gorinchem, where support in the south was provided by the water area of the Biesbosch, the Hollandsch Diep and the Haringvliet (south front of the Holland Fortress).\n\n--12--\n\nThe great strength of this line was derived from the fact that, as regards the chief zone of resistance, flooding could be effected to a width of 1 to 5 km. over its entire length, except for a portion at Utrecht. The entire zone was provided with permanent defensive works, which were, however, to a large extent obsolete in their construction. Nevertheless, great value was still attached to these works as points of infantry support, owing to the large surface, the massive earthworks, and the safety against attack provided by the presence of wide, wet ditches. This was particularly true where, as was the case at various points, modern casemates had been built into these earthworks. Such casemates were also constructed at all points where roads traversed the area of the position.\n\nThe length of the east front of the Holland Fortress was about 60 km. Allowing for the number of natural obstacles in the region, the defence of this position did not exceed the powers of the Dutch forces.\n\nNevertheless, the position was not without its drawbacks. Among these the following must be mentioned:\n\nThe fact that the high ground in the eastern part of the province of Utrecht would have to be yielded up to the enemy, which gave him the possibility not only of finding covered positions, but positions which dominated the actual zone of resistance.\n\nThe growing strength of modern artillery fire and air bombing.\n\nIn most instances, too, the floods on our own side ended against dykes and quays. In the first place this compelled the defender, if he wanted to have a field of fire, to take up linear positions on the dykes. Moreover, a disadvantage of these dykes was the risk that heavy bombardment would destroy them, thus inundating our own positions.\n\nThe city of Utrecht, in which the built-up areas approached very closely to the position, was a drawback to the defence, lying as it did in the centre of the east front.\n\nThe impossibility of ever making contact by land with possible allies. The broad river area in the south formed an absolutely insuperable obstacle to all who might have been able to render help.\n\nThe impossibility of our ever breaking out ourselves from behind the wide floods.\n\nIn view of the foregoing considerations, the attention of Army Command in the years preceding the war had been directed more and more to the Valley- position.\n\nThis position, too, which runs from north to south, from Eemnes eastward by way of Amersfoort, thence along the line Woudenberg-Veenendaal-Rhenen, possesses great natural strength, because in several places, especially in the northern part, flooding can be effected.\n\nFurthermore, the high ground in the eastern part of the province of Utrecht would now be on our own side, and as a result the position would at several points dominate the ground on the east front.\n\nThis position has an advantage over that of the east front of the Holland Fortress: it allows for the covered construction of defences in depth and the concentration of reserves.\n\nThe length, from the IJsselmeer to Rhenen, is not more than 40 km., so that a prolonged defence of this position was not beyond the powers of the Dutch forces.\n\n--13--\n\nAn opportunity for breaking out was provided along the parts remaining dry in the flooded area, while by an extension through the area lying between the Meuse and the Lek, along the line Rhenen-Apeltern, contact could be made with the Dutch and possibly the Allied forces present in North Brabant.\n\nOn the basis of all these considerations the Dutch Army Command decided to select the Valley position as the line in which the Dutch forces should carry on the main defence.\n\nDuring the last years preceding the war, the natural strength of this line was increased to the utmost limit by the construction of a large number of casemates and steel cupolaed bunkers. A ditch extending the whole length of the position likewise provided it with the necessary defence against tanks In addition to defence along this line, for reasons already stated--the safeguarding of mobilization and concentration-an enemy advance would be delayed in the outer provinces.\n\nParticular value was attached to this delay, which Army Command pictured as taking place in the east of North Brabant.\n\nIf the situation in Brabant is viewed in connection with what happened as regards territorial defence in Belgium, one is struck by the fact that Weert, the southern wing point of the link formed by the Raam, the Peel region and the Noorder Canal, lies only 40 km. from Hasselt, on the Albert Canal.\n\nAlthough the policy of strict neutrality adopted by Holland excluded the possibility of any contact being made with foreign powers with regard to contemplated military preparations, Army Command nevertheless had to take into account the possibility that Holland and Belgium would simultaneously be involved in a conflict with Germany. It was important in this connection to examine what were the theoretical possibilities open to the Belgian Army Command in such a case.\n\nHaving regard to the nature of the land, these were found to be the following:\n\nThe Belgian forces would maintain a persistent defence on the Meuse as far as Liége, and this defence would be extended to the north along the Belgian Zuid-Willemsvaart. In such a case the Belgian defence front could join up with the Dutch at Weert.\n\nThe Belgian forces would extend the Meuse defence to the north, as indicated under (1), along the Albert Canal, ending at the wing point of Antwerp. In this case a few divisions interposed between Hasselt and Weert would also be able to maintain a continuous defence.\n\nThe Belgian principal defence would be conducted on the Meuse as far as Namur and from that point by way of Louvain to Antwerp.\n\nIn this latter case the south wing of the Raam-Peel position at Weert would be liable to be outflanked.\n\nWhat the Belgian Army Command contemplated doing was not known to the Dutch General Staff. In the preparation for defence of their own territory, however, it was obvious that the above possibilities had to be taken into account. Therefore particular attention was paid to the development of the Raam-Peel position. At first designed as a purely delaying line, the possibility that the line might be persistently defended was later envisaged.\n\nTherefore, the Dutch plan of operations, as regards an attack from the east, comprised:\n\nDelaying an enemy advance in the territory east of the IJssel (chiefly for the purpose of covering the destruction to be carried out in this area).\n\n--14--\n\nDelaying an enemy advance along the line the Meuse-Meuse-Waal canal - IJssel.\n\nDelaying an enemy advance in the position Raam-Peel with the possibility of changing these delaying tactics into a 1 persistent defence, depending on what might be done by possible allies.\n\nPersistent defence of the Valley position extended through the area between the Lek and the Meuse, and afterwards along the Meuse in order to join up at Grave with the Raam-Peel position. Further:\n\nDelaying an enemy advance in the sense indicated under (a) in the territory of South Limburg, lying east of the Meuse.\n\nDelaying an enemy advance (on the east canal front) in the northerly provinces, and persistent defence of the head of the outer dyke of the Zuider Zee.\n\nDelaying action on the lines mentioned under (b) and (c) was prepared in such a manner that a continuous firing front was secured by guns set up in casemates or steel cupolaed bunkers.\n\nAs regards the lines mentioned under (e) and (f) there were casemates at the chief passages over canals or approach roads.\n\nOn the basis of this plan of operations, on the 10th May, the day on which the conflict broke out, the Dutch forces were disposed as indicated on Map 1. When considering this disposition the following should be noted: Until shortly before the moment when the conflict broke out the Raam-Peel position was occupied by the Third Army Corps and the Peel division, while, in order to cover the open south wing at Weert, the Light Division was disposed to the rear in echelons.\n\nWith this disposition of troops in the Raam-Peel position, therefore, defence was the foremost object. True, the length of the Raam-Peel position between Weert and Grave was still quite 60 km.--that is to say, one which far exceeds the powers of defence of three divisions under normal conditions--but it must be borne in mind that the entire middle section of the Raam-Peel position, extending between Mill and Nederweert--that is to say, a section of about 45 km.--is naturally so strong that weak forces may suffice for the defence of the approaches traversing this territory. Therefore, the strength of the defence could be concentrated on the Mill-Grave part, where at the outset the main body of the Third Army Corps was disposed.\n\nA few days before the outbreak of the conflict the Dutch Supreme Command realized that only a few weak sections of the Belgian forces were on the Zuid Willemsvaart, so that, in case of an attack from the east, the resistance on the raid canal would presumably only be of short duration. It could likewise not be regarded as probable that Allied forces could arrive in time to close the gap south of Weert. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief of the Land and Sea Forces decided to adopt only delaying tactics in the Raam-Peel position. The Third Army Corps and the Light Division had now as a matter of course to be allocated to the defence of the south river front, and in case of necessity as reserve for the occupation of the Valley position. With this in view the Third Army Corps was withdrawn, leaving a few battalions in the Raam-Peel position, and was concentrated in the region shown on the map. If an attack really took place from the east, this army corps would take up a position behind the Waal, in the space between Ochten and Gorinchem, while the Light Division would be transferred to the environs of Rotterdam.\n\n--15--\n\nObviously, it would have been possible to get the units in question to carry out the necessary displacements for this purpose at once. The reason why this was not clone was that it was thought desirable:\n\nTo leave an enemy in uncertainty as long as possible with regard to the resistance to be expected in North Brabant.\n\nFor reasons connected with neutrality, to maintain a considerable force as long as possible south of the big rivers.\n\nThe task of the First Army Corps, depending on the circumstances, was: Defence of the coast front.\n\nTo form the reserve for the occupation of the Valley position.\n\nOccupation of the most important parts of the east front of the Holland Fortress, which was itself the second line of defence.\n\nFor the rest the most important parts of the fronts of the Holland Fortress were occupied by guard detachments consisting, of infantry troops, strengthened at some points by brigades of artillery, all of which were, however, armed with out-of-date weapons.\n\nThe IJsselmeer itself was guarded by a small flotilla consisting of a few armoured boats, mine sweepers, one torpedo boat and a number of motor boats.\n\nV. CONSIDERATIONS IN RELATION TO THE NETHERLANDS PLAN OF OPERATIONS\n\nIf we examine the disposition of the Dutch forces on the eve of the outbreak of the conflict, it is evident that this disposition, in consequence of the attitude of strict neutrality adopted by the Government, was intended to allow for all possibilities which might arise.\n\nAn attack from the east, apart from the delaying actions on the Tines mentioned, would be held in the Valley position, while in that case the Third Army Corps, by occupying the Waal front, would create a continuous defence with the south front of the Holland Fortress. The First Army Corps and also the Light Division would finally form the reserve at the disposal of the Chief Command.\n\nIf an attack took place from a southerly direction, it would, after being delayed in North Brabant, particularly on the Wilhelmina Canal, be held on the Waal and the south front of the Holland Fortress. In addition to the troops of the Third Army Corps available for this purpose, and the sections belonging to the security garrison of the Holland Fortress, there could also be employed for this defence the First Army Corps and also units from the Valley position, which position under these circumstances would no longer be important.\n\nFrom a westerly direction, an attack would be held on the coast by the security garrison of the west front of the Holland Fortress, the First Army Corps, the troops in Zeeland, and those occupying the position of Den Helder, while in these circumstances the whole of the forces occupying the Valley position and the troops in North Brabant could strengthen this defence in a later phase. The disposition was therefore designed to meet the task imposed on the Dutch Supreme Command by the foreign policy of Holland. The question must, however, now be put whether this disposition was also in keeping with the principle generally applied in strategy of the economy of forces. In dealing with\n\n--16--\n\nthis question we will confine ourselves to the case which actually occurred - namely, an attack from the east.\n\nIt is particularly desirable to examine whether there were not too many forces allocated to subsidiary strategic functions, forces which in the final outcome would cease to be available for the main strugg\n\nle, for which in the nature of things there never can be sufficient strength. Let us examine the distribution of forces a little more closely in this connection. As has already been stated, the total forces available were:\n\nBattalions. 24 brigades of infantry of the field army 72 24 brigades of infantry, i.e. numbers 23 to 46 inclusive 72 24 frontier battalions 24 2 brigades of cyclists 6 5 regiments of hussars, amounting to 5 2 regiments of hussar motor-cyclists, amounting to 2 In all a force of 181 These forces, in case of an attack from the east, were allocated as follows: Battalions. (a) Delaying action east of the IJssel 5 (b) Territorial defence of South Limburg 4 (c) Ditto Northern Provinces 7 (d) Delaying action on river line Meuse-IJssel 16 (e) Delaying action in south part of North Brabant 3 (f) Territorial defence of Zeeland 4 (g) Delaying action in the Raam-Peel position 14 Total for subsidiary strategic tasks 53 Battalions. (h) As guard security garrisons on the fronts of the Holland Fortress and in occupation of important objects in the interior 32 (i) Defence of the Valley position, a strength of 39 (j) Defence of the region between the Meuse and the Lek 12 (k) Defence of the Waal, to the south front of the Holland Fortress (those troops withdrawn from the Third Army Corps and the Light Division) 26 (l) General reserve (First Army Corps) a strength of 19 Total strength for the principal action 96\n\nIf we reckon that the troops mentioned under (e) in the case of attack from the east would be allocated for defence of the south front of the Holland Fortress, the figure for the respective duties becomes 50-32-99.\n\nFor the performance of the principal task, the defence of the heart of the country, fully one-half of the available forces were therefore allocated. The allocation of a fighting strength of fifty battalions, quite one-fourth of the total available forces, for the performance of strategically subsidiary tasks appears high.\n\nLet us examine; therefore, to what extent the distribution and allocation of the troops in each of the territories mentioned was strategically justified.\n\nThe troops intended for delaying action east of the IJssel were chiefly meant to safeguard the work of destruction which had been prepared there. A figure of\n\n--17--\n\nfive battalions for an area fully 100 km. in length, with a depth varying from 20 to 60 km., is certainly not too high for this.\n\nSouth Limburg is an area of great political importance. If only for that reason it would have been inadmissible to leave this part of the country entirely undefended and open for a German advance against the Belgian system of defence. The allocation of four battalions to this duty is certainly a minimum.\n\nThe northern provinces, as has been said above, were of great economic importance for the conduct of war. The fundamental idea which gave rise to the decision to defend this area territorially was that an opponent must be prevented from occupying these provinces with very weak forces. If an opponent knew that in order to conquer them considerable forces--or, to put it more definitely, from one to two divisions--were needed, there was the possibility that he would refrain from attacking this territory. And if there were such an attack, the forces engaged there would in any case be drawn from the troops which had to light the decisive action on the chief centre of operations, and this would indirectly benefit the main Dutch defence or our allies.\n\nTerritorial defence of the northern provinces was therefore strategically fully justified. In view of the extent of the territory the number of battalions allotted was essential.\n\nAs regards the troops intended for delaying action on the river line Meuse- IJssel, it must be recalled that originally the reason for the intended delaying tactics on this line was to give the main body of the forces the opportunity of mobilizing and concentrating. This reason, however, was no longer operative, since the Dutch forces had in September 1939 carried out mobilization and taken up war positions without hindrance by enemy action. Nevertheless, the idea of delaying action on this line was adhered to in order to give the units in the principal defence some time to attain complete readiness for action. The lack of depth of Dutch territory, together with the great mobility of German motorized units, rendered this necessary.\n\nIf delaying tactics are to be at all effective the very least which must be demanded is that a continuous firing front can be formed. From Roermond to Zwolle the length of this line is about 180 km. If it was held by sixteen battalions, therefore, each battalion would have charge of a length of 10 to 15 km. Any further dilution of this cordon disposition would have made the entire resistance worthless, because it would then have been a very simple matter to roll it up. When once delaying tactics had been decided upon, therefore, the number of sixteen battalions could not be reduced.\n\nThe battalions intended for delaying action in the southern part of North Brabant were, in case of an attack from the east, to be allocated to the defence of the southern front of the Holland Fortress, and therefore can be left out of account.\n\nWith respect to Zeeland, it was essential in all circumstances to prevent an important port, such as Flushing (Vlissingen?), being captured by an enemy by surprise. Therefore, there was unquestionable justification for the battalions allocated to the defence of this territory.\n\nDelaying action in the Raam-Peel position was strategically justified with a view to the possibility of support being obtained from possible allies. The presence of Franco-British forces in northern France made this a possibility. In order to reach North Brabant, those units would have had to cover distances of about 200 km., which requires a time of one to two days. Therefore, the longer the troops in the Raam-Peel position could hold up an enemy advance from the east, the more likelihood was there that the Allied\n\n--18--\n\ntroops would reach North Brabant in time, and the farther east would be the point at which they would perhaps be able to bring an enemy advance to a standstill.\n\nEvery hour of additional delay might lead to the result that a larger portion of North Brabant remained in our hands. This consideration was well worth the allocation of fourteen battalions to the Raam-Peel position.\n\nFinally, the strength of thirty-two battalions as security guard for the Holland Fortress, and for the interior, must be considered as a minimum. In particular the anticipated use of air-borne infantry and paratroops made it absolutely essential to retain a considerable number of troops in the interior for the defence of vital points. The story of the campaign proves in actual fact that the number of battalions allotted for this purpose was itself very far from sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the disposition and the distribution of the Dutch forces at the outbreak of the conflict can be fully justified.\n\nVI. EVENTS SHORTLY BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF THE CONFLICT\n\nThe Dutch Supreme Command necessarily possessed some data concerning the strength of the German forces posted on the Dutch eastern frontier. Shortly before the outbreak of the conflict it was estimated that there were--\n\nOn the Dutch frontier in the territory north of the Rhine about ten German divisions.\n\nOn the Dutch frontier in the territory between Cleves and the line Munich Ð Gladbach-Düsseldorf about nine divisions.\n\nFacing South Limburg in the area south of the line mentioned under (b) and Monschau about thirty divisions.\n\nFrom this disposition of troops it could be inferred that if an attack was to take place from an easterly direction, it would presumably occur along the following axes:\n\nA drive against the heart of the country in the territory north of the great rivers, with subsidiary action, perhaps, against the northern provinces and the outer dyke of the Zuider Zee.\n\nA drive through North Limburg and the eastern part of North Brabant, directed against the Belgian positions on the Albert Canal, west of Hasselt, and perhaps also against the westerly part of North Brabant and Zeeland. It was to be expected that this drive would take place north and south along the Peel territory.\n\nA main attack against the Belgian defensive system on the Meuse and the Albert Canal, south and north of Liége respectively. The northern axis of this attack would presumably run through the southern portion of the Dutch province of Limburg.\n\nPeriods of tension had already occurred several times during the winter of 1939 1940, and had rendered it necessary to issue further standby orders. Such a crisis occurred again on the 7th May. On that date, therefore, all leave (the ordinary periodical leaves and the longer periods of leave given for purposes of business and study) was cancelled, and at the same time order was given that all frontier and coast troops were to occupy their fighting positions in full strength.\n\n--19--\n\nThe result of this was that the strategic surprise at which the Germans aimed by their sudden attack on Holland on the morning of the 10th May was unsuccessful.\n\nVII. THE GERMAN PLAN OF OPERATIONS\n\nIn the eyes of the German Command Holland was a subsidiary field of operations.\n\nNevertheless, it was of the utmost importance for that command to occupy Holland as rapidly as possible when attacking in the west, in order to be covered on the right flank in the operations against Belgium and France. Therefore, the forces employed against Holland were considerable.\n\nThe German Eighteenth Army, which was to carry out the attack on Holland, comprised the following forces:\n\nAbout five infantry divisions,\n\nOne tank division,\n\nOne cavalry division,\n\nThe Twenty-Second Air-borne Division,\n\nThe Second Regiment of Paratroops,\n\nThe Seventh Air Division,\n\nin addition to the necessary auxiliary troops. The entire force was under the command of General von Küchler.\n\nThe German plan of attack comprised:\n\nAn attack by air-borne infantry and paratroops on the heart of the country, in order, if possible, to seize the centre of Government on the very first day of the war, and in this way to paralyze the entire resistance (see Appendix II).\n\nAn attack on the Valley position and the east front of the Holland Fortress along the axis Arnhem-Rhenen-Utrecht.\n\nAn attack through North Brabant with the intention of pushing on as quickly as possible through Moerdijk-Dordrecht-Rotterdam, in order to make contact with the airborne troops to be landed there.\n\nA subsidiary attack for the purpose of seizing the northern provinces and the Zuider Zee dyke, in order to penetrate into the Holland Fortress by this way also.\n\nStrategically, therefore, the operation presented the aspect of a frontal attack combined with double outflanking, while the air-borne infantry together with the paratroops were to give the stab in the back.\n\nIt would be of the utmost importance, especially if the attack mentioned under (a) did not attain the desired success, that the troops operating in North Brabant should make contact as rapidly as possible with the air-borne infantry to be landed at Moerdijk, Dordrecht and in the environs of Rotterdam.\n\nThe German commander expected that this attacking group would have to overcome the following resistances:\n\nThe obstructions east of the Meuse.\n\nThe Meuse itself.\n\nThe Raam-Peel position.\n\nThe Zuid Willemsvaart, and also\n\n--20--\n\nThe Wilhelmina Canal.\n\nGreat rapidity of operation was therefore particularly desirable in the southern outflanking group.\n\nVIII. THE COURSE OF MILITARY EVENTS ON THE 10TH MAY\n\n1. The Attack on the Heart of the Country.\n\nOn the evening of the 9th May, headquarters had already received reports from various quarters, from which it was to be inferred that an attack on the early morning of the 10th May was highly probable. Then shortly after midnight reports came to hand from the aircraft spotters of great German air activity, practically over the entire territory of Holland.\n\nThe question whether an air attack on England was contemplated or whether this activity was the first phase of an attack on Holland was speedily settled, when reports were received of air attacks on the airfields of Schiphol, Bergen, Waalhaven, de Kooy, Soesterberg, Haamstede and Hilversum. In addition, a number of the aircraft dropped mines in the outlets to the sea along the Dutch coast, in order to prevent Dutch ships from running out and the possible arrival of help from allies.\n\nWith the object of frightfulness, and in order to create confusion from the very outset at the centre of Government, at 5 o'clock and at 10 o'clock air raids were carried out on The Hague.\n\nThe Dutch air forces, which had, since the early morning hours been in a state of complete readiness for action, took to the air wherever possible for their struggle against the overpoweringly strong enemy. They succeeded in bringing down a large number of German machines, but their own losses were necessarily heavy. The Dutch anti-aircraft artillery also exacted a heavy toll at the outset from the attacking German aircraft.\n\nThree hours after the air raids had begun, however, the German Ambassador handed a note to the Dutch Government suggesting that all resistance should cease at once.\n\nThe Dutch Government, of course, rejected this suggestion, and declared that, by reason of the German attacks which were taking place, a state of war existed between Holland and Germany.\n\nMore serious than the air bombings themselves was the fact that paratroops were dropped at various points in the hart of Holland, and succeeded in obtaining control of a few airfields, in consequence of which German air-borne infantry could be landed from transport aircraft.\n\nThus, the garrison of the Valkenburg airfield, consisting of parts of the Third Battalion, Fourth Infantry Brigade, was, after air bombing at 3.30 a.m., partly destroyed by paratroops, while the rest of the garrison was forced to retreat. At 7.30 a.m. this airfield was in German hands, and from that moment onwards German reserves were continually brought up by Junkers transport aircraft.\n\nLikewise the garrison of the Ypenburg airfield, consisting of the Third Battalion, Brigade of Grenadiers, was forced to evacuate the airfield, and the airfield of Ockenburg, where the garrison were taken by surprise, also fell into German hands. At 6 a.m. this airfield was already occupied by 600 of the enemy.\n\n--21--\n\nIn addition to the airfields mentioned above, swarms of paratroops were landed near the Maaldrift, in the environs of Wassenaar, on the southern bank of the Meuse at Rotterdam, near Dordrecht and Wieldrecht near the Moerdijk, in the Westland, near Katwijk Binnen, and the Staalduinen.\n\nAt Rotterdam particularly, where the Germans were assisted by a strong fifth column, consisting of the big German colony living in Rotterdam and a few Dutch traitors, the position was serious. The Germans succeeded in gaining possession of the two bridges over the Meuse and also the bridge over the Oude Maas. The whole of Feyenoord and also the airfield of Waalhaven thus fell into German hands. Rotterdam, as a supply depot, only had a very small garrison.\n\nNotwithstanding the efforts made, in which a detachment of marines distinguished themselves, the Dutch troops did not succeed in regaining the bridges over the Meuse.\n\nTorpedo boat Z5, and also the torpedo motor boat 51, both on guard at the Hook of Holland, steamed up the Nieuwe Waterweg, and took part in the artillery action against the German forces at Feyenoord, until the war vessels in question had used up the whole of their ammunition.\n\nBesides this, the Netherlands naval vessel Van Galen was summoned from Den Helder to take part in the fighting at Rotterdam.\n\nAlthough destroyers are necessarily not quite suitable for this sort of action, the ship directed artillery fire on to the airfield of Waalhaven, but was finally destroyed by repeated German air attacks.\n\nThe Germans also succeeded in gaining possession, by means of surprise, and with the help of traitors, of the two bridges over the Moerdijk. In this way, in the early morning of the 10th May, the island of IJsselmonde and also a large portion of the island of Dordrecht were in enemy hands, while the troops landed around The Hague had spread out and had seized the Deyl and the Haagsche Schouw, in this way controlling the approaches to The Hague. Meanwhile the Dutch troops in South Holland immediately began a counter-attack.\n\nThe remaining portion of the Third Battalion, Fourth Infantry Brigade, proceeded to attack the airfield of Valkenburg, which airfield was also attacked from the north-west and the north-east by the first and the second battalions of the same brigade. The Third Brigade, Second Artillery Regiment, gave the necessary artillery support in these attacks. Katwijk on the Rhine, where the Germans had meantime also gained a footing, was recovered by Second Battalion, Fourth Infantry Brigade. On the 10th May at 5.30 p.m. the airfield was again in Dutch hands. The German garrison retreated to the village of Valkenburg, where it maintained its position. The Third Brigade, Second Artillery Regiment, subjected this village to heavy artillery fire.\n\nThe Haagsche Schouw and the Deyl were reconquered by young depot troops, the First Motor Cyclist Hussar Regiment also taking part in this operation. The German troops at these points also retreated to the village of Valkenburg. First Battalion, Brigade of Grenadiers, which was on the southern outskirts of The Hague, received orders to reconquer the airfield of Ockenburg by an attack from the north. This battalion, strengthened by depot troops, succeeded in retaking the airfield at 1.30 p.m. The attack, thanks to the excellent short-wave communications, was effectively supported by the fire of First Brigade, Second Artillery Regiment, which had taken up its position near its permanent station at Poeldijk. The First Battalion, Brigade of Chasseurs, which was to attack the airfield from the direction of Monster, encountered resistance, in the course of its advance, near the estate of Ockenburg. When the battalion had wiped out this\n\n--22--\n\nresistance at 4 p.m. the airfield was already in Dutch hands. The German garrison had retreated in a south-westerly direction.\n\nMeantime, the airfield of Ypenburg had also been recovered by the Second and the Third Battalion, Brigade of Grenadiers, and young depot troops from The Hague.\n\nIn the latter city itself the fifth column had also displayed brisk activity. As early as the night of the 10th May men of the depot troops had installed a powerful guard service in the interior of the town. All action on the part of traitors was energetically countered and there were several instances of exchange of fire with fifth columnists inside houses.\n\nUnder the threat of the German paratroops who had landed outside The Hague, the depot troops stationed at that place had occupied a position of defence on the north and east borders of that city. The enemy, however, did not carry out an attack on the city itself.\n\nThe Dutch troops in the Polder of the Hoeksche Waard and around Dordrecht took up defensive positions in order to prevent any extension of the success of the paratroops landed.\n\nln themselves, however, these units were not strong enough to undertake a counter-attack. The batteries of artillery at Strijen, armed with the out-of-date guns of 15 cm. 24 length, directed fire during the whole of the day against Willemsdorp, the Moerdijk bridges and the Brabant shore. Unfortunately, the bridges were so strongly built that even continuous fire with high-explosive shells was not sufficient to render them unsuitable for traffic.\n\nIn the afternoon, the enemy landed reinforcements from aircraft on the shore south of Katwijk. These troops were fired on effectively from the sea by the Dutch naval vessel Van Galen, and they were also subjected to attacks by the Dutch air force. Finally, these troops were destroyed by units of the First Army Corps and depot troops.\n\nAn attack by German air-borne troops on the Staff Headquarters of The Hague group of the west front of the Holland Fortress at Wateringen was also beaten off with the aid of depot troops.\n\nThe Dutch air forces had meantime sustained heavy losses. What remained was concentrated on airfields concealed from the enemy. From there they were repeatedly sent out to attack, from the air, an enemy who continued to grow in overwhelming strength.\n\n2. The Struggle in the Southern Provinces.\n\nAfter the Dutch had carried out the work of destruction east of the Meuse (which was clone before midnight of the 9th-10th May), the German troops passed over the Dutch frontier on a broad front in the early morning of the 10th May.\n\nThe main forces were directed on to the frontier section Lottum-Eysden, where subsidiary troops were sent forward against the part of the Meuse lying between Vierlingsbeek and Mook and the Meuse-Waal Canal.\n\nThe weak frontier guards east of the Meuse were speedily overpowered, after they had performed their duty of reporting the passages over the frontier.\n\nApart from the railway bridge at Gennep, all bridges over the Meuse were destroyed in time. The troops holding the bridge at Gennep, who were surprised by a German shock force, did not succeed in destroying the bridge. Because of this the structure lying in the second line, the railway viaduct at Beugen, the destruction of which had also been prepared, likewise fell undamaged into German hands. The consequence was that as early as 4 o'clock on the morning\n\n--23--\n\nof the 10th May a German armoured train, followed by a train filled with infantry, passed over the Gennep bridge and the viaduct and steamed on to the railway halt called Zeeland in the rear of the Raam-Peel position.\n\nAs early as 4 a.m. German infantry appeared on the east bank of the portion of the Meuse between Sambeek, Boxmeer and Gennep, while the Dutch casemates on the west bank were speedily subjected to machine-gun and artillery fire. As the Dutch had no artillery at their disposal on the Meuse, the Dutch positions were defenceless against this artillery fire.\n\nBetween 5 and 9 o'clock a.m. the attacker made five attempts to reach the west bank on the Mook-Gennep section with infantry, but all these attempts were repulsed by the well directed machine-gun fire from the casemates occupied by troops of the Fifteenth Frontier Battalion and Second Battalion Twenty-Sixth Infantry Brigade.\n\nBetween 9 and 9.30 a.m. the attackers succeeded in reaching the west bank in the neighbourhood of Gennep. The same was the case at Sambeek at about 10 a.m. and at Mook at about 12 noon. After this the enemy was able to roll up the Dutch cordon position. At about 3 p.m., therefore, the troops posted farther south on the Meuse were withdrawn to the Raam-Peel position.\n\nAt Venlo the German attack had been directed against the positions of the Third Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Brigade of Infantry, and the Second Frontier Battalion. From 4 to 9 a.m. the enemy attempted to cross the Meuse in the vicinity of the blown-up bridge, and similar endeavours were made on that part of the Meuse lying south of Venlo and north of Kessel. At 9.15 a.m., under the protection of a smoke screen, the enemy succeeded in putting over a pontoon bridge south of Venlo, after which the Dutch position was rolled up there too. Some casemates, however, continued to offer resistance right into the morning of the 11th May.\n\nAfter Grubbenvorst and Lottum had been subjected to artillery fire a passage of the river was also successfully effected at Lottum, which meant that the Dutch positions at Broekhuizen could also be taken in the rear. In this section, likewise, the troops remaining were ordered at 10.30 a.m. to fall back on the Raam-Peel position.\n\nIn South Limburg, the first German tank division in action there had been able, by means of its artillery, to clear up the isolated casemates on the approach roads in a relatively short time, after which it pushed on towards Maastricht.\n\nThe orders of this division were:\n\nTo gain mastery of the bridges at Maastricht, and\n\nAfter that, with the help of paratroops, to gain possession of the bridges, west of Maastricht, over the Belgian Albert Canal.\n\nThe bridges at Maastricht were, however, destroyed, so that the armoured division was only able to pass over to the other bank during the night of the 10th-11th May, after constructing a heavy pontoon bridge. The infantry troops had already got across.\n\nOn the Meuse-Waal Canal the bridge at Hatert was only partly blown up, so that the enemy was able to make his way over to the western bank into the positions of the First Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Brigade of Infantry, and to roll up the position on the west bank. On the afternoon of the 10th May the Dutch troops stationed there began their retreat to Tiel.\n\nIn this way, notwithstanding the heroic defence and self-sacrifice of the various troops occupying the casemates, the river line on the section Maastricht-Nijmegen had been broken through at several points by about 12 o'clock, and the enemy was able to continue his advance to the west.\n\n--24--\n\nMeantime troops belonging to the forces occupying the Raam-Peel position had also come into action.\n\nThe sector lying between the railway line Gennep-Uden and the Meuse, having a width of 10 km., was defended by there battalions belonging respectively to the Third, the Sixth and the Fourteenth Infantry Brigade. The troops were not equipped with up-to-date anti-tank guns, nor had they any mortars, or any means of defence against attack from the air. The only artillery support available was one brigade armed with guns of 8 cm. steel (out-of-date guns without carriage brake and without gun-shields).\n\nThe German armoured train with the goods train following, which, owing to the negligence at the bridge of Gennep, had been able to drive through as far as the railway halt Zeeland, in the rear of the Raam-Peel position, landed German infantry units there, who immediately began an attack on the rear of the casemates lying north of the railway line and the casemates situated between the railway line and the metalled road Volkel-St. Huber.\n\nLocal reserves were not available. The artillery brigade Third Brigade, Twentieth Artillery Regiment, turned its guns round 180 degrees, however, and was in this way able to repel the attack on the casemates north of the railway. It was, however, not possible to prevent a number of casemates lying between the railway and the metalled road from falling into German hands at 7.30 a.m.\n\nAs a result of these events the commander of the Third Army Corps, who also had command of the light division, placed the Second Regiment of Motor Cyclist Hussars at the disposal of the territorial commander in North Brabant, with the object of recapturing the part of the position that had been lost.\n\nThe armoured train, which had meantime gone back, was derailed on the return journey owing to obstacles placed upon the line. A fight lasting hours developed between the occupants of this train and the casemates near the railway. The counter-attack of the Second Motor Cyclist Hussars Regiment begun in the open area between the railway and the Volkel-St. Huber road was brought to a standstill by enemy machine-gun fire, and therefore did not attain the successful result which had been hoped for.\n\nMeanwhile the German troops who had crossed the Sambeek-Mook portion of the Meuse had reached Mill, and at noon an attack developed from the environs of this place on the front of the position. The attack, however, was repulsed by the First Battalion, Third Brigade of Infantry, which battalion occupied this part of the position.\n\nBetween 4 and 6 p.m. the German artillery then began violent fire on the Dutch section west of Mill, and this fire was between 6 and 7 p.m. followed by bombing by German aircraft. The village of Escharen lying farther north was also bombed and set on fire.\n\nHaving regard to the fact that the part of the section of the First Battalion, Third Brigade of Infantry, south of the railway line was in German hands, and that the counter-attack by the Second Motor Cyclist Hussar Regiment had not produced the desired result, while no reserves were available to carry out a fresh counterattack, the whole of the troops occupying the Raam-Peel position were ordered to withdraw to the Zuid Willemsvaart during the night of the 10th-11th May. A screening force which stayed behind in the position till 4 a.m. on the 11th May concealed this operation from the Germans, who therefore did not press on during the night.\n\nApart from certain troops who had not received the order of retreat, all the units had, in the early morning of the 11th May, taken up the positions ordered behind the Zuid Willemsvaart.\n\n--25--\n\nMeantime, as had been decided earlier, the Third Army Corps had moved from the encampment area south of 's Hertogenbosch to the front allocated to this unit behind the Waal between Ochten and Gorinchem.\n\nThe retreat was effected over the existing great connecting road between 's Hertogenbosch and Zalt Bommel, and by way of a second road farther east, the necessary pontoon bridges being constructed over the big rivers for this purpose. Although the retreat had to be carried out by day and for the most part over entirely open terrain, the operation took place without enemy air attack.\n\nThe retreat of the Light Division was not so simple an affair.\n\nThis unit, too, had received orders in sealed envelopes for the retreat, which was to take place on the first night following an attack, if any. As in the case of the Third Army Corps, however, the Commander-in-Chief decided that the retreat was to start at once on the morning of the 10th May.\n\nThe two regiments of motor cyclist hussars had been withdrawn from the division. The First Regiment of Motor Cyclist Hussars had already been placed at the disposal of the commander of the Holland Fortress even before the outbreak of hostilities. This was done in view of the danger from the air in the heart of the country. The second regiment was, as described above, placed under the orders of the territorial commander in North Brabant on the morning of the 10th May.\n\nThe Light Division now consisted, apart from the trains, of the two regiments of cyclists and the motorized corps of horse artillery.\n\nAccording to orders prepared beforehand, the retreat was to take place:\n\nWith the motorized section along the line of march Moerdijk, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, to the encampment point north of this place.\n\nWith the First Cyclist Brigade along the axis Drongelen-Brakel-Herwijnen.\n\nWith the Second Cyclist Brigade along the axis Keizersveer-Gorinchem.\n\nAs there was no bridge at this point, this brigade was to be transferred by ferry to the other bank.\n\nIn the early morning the staff of the Light Division received the news that the Moerdijk bridges were in German hands.\n\nOrders were now modified, so that the motorized section, with the exception of the Horse Artillery Corps, was to follow the line of march of the Second Cyclist Brigade, while the Horse Artillery Corps was at first to do the same, but after passing over the bridge at Keizersveer, was to diverge to the marching route of the First Cyclist Brigade.\n\nThe Light Division was thus confronted with the difficult task of carrying out a march by day over roads for the most part narrow and open, with units having different marching paces. This, too, in a conflict with an opponent possessing air supremacy, while the anti-aircraft defence consisted only of a few obsolete batteries, set up at the bridges Keizersveer, Drongelen, and Brakel-Herwijnen, and a few platoons of anti-aircraft machine guns. The ferry at Sleeuwijk, indeed, had no protection whatever in the form of anti-aircraft defences.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that occasional hold-ups occurred, owing to the above circumstances, and that the columns were exposed to the attack of German aircraft, few losses were sustained.\n\nAt 10 a.m. the commander of the light division received orders from the commander of the Third Army Corps to place himself, with the troops under his command, at the orders of the commander of the Holland Fortress, to be used, if necessary, for the occupation of the Merwede front lying between Dordrecht and Gorinchem. A brigade of cyclists was to proceed as quickly as possible to Gorinchem.\n\n--26--\n\nThe commander of the light division thereupon gave orders for the occupation of the Merwede section by the two brigades of cyclists attacking side by side. In the evening, however, the said commander received fresh orders from the commander of the Holland Fortress. These were to the following effect:\n\nTo advance in the direction of IJsselmonde and attack the German troops which had landed at Waalhaven. The airfield in question was to be bombed by the R.A.F. during the night of the 10th-11th May, but this bombing would have ended by 2.20 a.m.\n\nTo place one battalion at the disposal of the cantonment commander at Dordrecht.\n\nAt 5.45 p.m. the commander of the Light Division issued fresh orders in this connection, whereby the division was to proceed to the Noord in two marching groups in order to cross this river at Alblasserdam.\n\nOn the River Noord itself the commander of the Light Division did not expect any resistance.\n\nFor the attack against Waalhaven the commander of the Light Division still disposed of five battalions of cyclists and two brigades of artillery (four batteries, sixteen guns in all). The battalion of cyclists intended for Dordrecht was, after crossing the bridge at Alblasserdam, to diverge towards Zwijndrecht.\n\nThe brigades of cyclists were meantime engaged in occupying the Merwede front, and therefore it was some time before the troops could begin the movement in execution of the new order. Not till 10.30 p.m. did the Second Cyclist Brigade start the movement from Sliedrecht, while the First Cyclist Brigade was at that moment marching forward near Laag Blokland.\n\nMeantime it had become evident to the commander of the Light Division that the west bank of the Noord at Alblasserdam was occupied by the enemy and that the bridge had been swung open.\n\nThe battalion of cyclists intended for Dordrecht was therefore ordered to attain its objective by way of Papendrecht. In view of the lateness of the hour, the commander of the Light Division decided to postpone the attack on the German troops on the west bank of the Noord at Alblasserdam till the morning of the 11th May.\n\n3. The Events in the Valley Positions, in the Area East of the Latter, and in the Northern Provinces.\n\nIn accordance with the orders given, the troops east of the IJssel carried out the destructions and set up the obstructions which had been prepared. The only case in which destruction was not successful was that of the bridge over the Twente Canal at Diepenheim. In accordance with their instructions the troops operating to the east of the IJssel withdrew thereafter behind the latten waterway.\n\nAll the bridges over the IJssel were then blown up.\n\nIn the early morning of the 10th May the German forces, operating chiefly along the axis Emmerik-Zevenaar-Arnhem, had already crossed the frontier. The frontier there being only a few kilometres away from the IJssel, this river was already reached by the Germans early in the morning. Supported by overwhelming artillery strength, the Germans succeeded at 10 a.m. in crossing the IJssel at Westervoort and continuing their march along the axes Arnhem Ede and Arnhem-Wageningen.\n\nMeanwhile the troops in the Valley position had fully occupied their lines at 3 a.m. on the 10th May. All the preparations for a prolonged defence had been\n\n--27--\n\nmade. The artillery units had made their preparations for firing at all the important points in the terrain facing them, from their normal position and two reserve positions. Only the flood water in some depressions was lower than during the preceding period, probably in consequence of weather conditions.\n\nThe light troops belonging to the two army corps which occupied the Valley position were pushed forward--namely, First and Fifth Hussar Regiments in the section of the Fourth Army Corps and Fourth Hussar Regiment in the section of the Second Army Corps.\n\nThe task of the light troops in question was:\n\nTo delay an enemy advance in the area west of the IJssel.\n\nTo co-operate in, and to cover the execution of, the plan of destruction which had been prepared for this area.\n\nAs the field army fighting in the Valley position did not possess large reserves, the commander of the field army was very anxious, if possible, to get these regiments back intact inside the position area, and for this reason particular emphasis in the order was laid on its second part.\n\nThe delaying action by the said regiments was to begin in the line the IJssel from Arnhem to Spankeren, and afterwards along the Dieren Canal. The main bodies were to effect delay along the line Oosterbeek-Harskamp-Garderen-Ermelo-Harderwijk.\n\nWhen the troops on the canal had carried out the work of destruction on the morning of the 10th May, they fell back on the main body.\n\nThe German troops who had broken through and passed over the IJssel at Westervoort soon came into contact with the Fourth Hussar Regiment, which regiment fought successive delaying actions at Oosterbeek, Heelsum, Renkum and Ede, finally retreating on the evening of the 10th May before the overwhelming strength of the Germans, behind the Valley position, and rallying at Leersum.\n\nIn consequence of the forced retreat of the Fourth Hussar Regiment the right wings of the First and Fifth Hussar Regiments were exposed, so that these regiments were drawn back to the line Groote Hoef-Klaarwater-Nijkerkerveen-Nijkerk.\n\nMeantime, the events in the heart of Holland had prompted the Commander-in-Chief to withdraw six battalions of the field army from the defence of the Valley position. The large units in the front line were in this way deprived to a great extent of their reserves, so that the commander of the field army considered it necessary also to draw back the mounted squadrons of the First and Fifth Hussar Regiments behind the position, in order to form new reserves from these after their conversion into cyclist units. On the evening of the 10th May, therefore, all that remained on the terrain in front of the Valley position was the unmounted part of the First Hussar Regiment, which was in the line Klaarwater-Nijkerk.\n\nWhile these events were in progress, the cordon disposition of the Dutch troops in the northern provinces had also been broken through by the German troops operating there. The port installations and the locks at Delfzijl were destroyed, and the entrance to the harbour was blocked, with a view to depriving the Germans of the use of the harbour as long as possible.\n\nIn the evening the troops which had operated in the northern provinces passed through the Wons position at the head of the outer Zuider Zee dyke. From there they were transported to Den Helder, where they were reorganized in order to continue the fight.\n\n--28--\n\n4. The Situation at the End of the First Day of War.\n\nTherefore the position at the end of the first day of war was as follows:\n\nThe troops operating east of the great rivers, after carrying out the task allotted to them--namely, safeguarding the destruction which had been prepared in these regions had either retreated or been destroyed.\n\nThe waterline formed by the rivers Meuse and IJssel, with the Meuse-Waal Canal lying between, and the line of canals in the northern provinces had been broken through, after they had, however, delayed the German advance for four to six hours.\n\nApart from one single structure, all the bridges on the waterline were destroyed, with the result that the German armies operating to the west of the rivers experienced great difficulties in their supplies and rear communications. A part of the troops occupying the line of the rivers had been able to withdraw into the Valley position or the Raam-Peel position.\n\nThe light troops east of the Valley position had been withdrawn into that position except for a small number on the northern front. The enemy, however, had not yet made contact with the advance posts.\n\nThe Raam-Peel position had been broken through south of Mill, and the troops occupying this position were to withdraw to the Zuid Willemsvaart on the night of the 10th-11th May.\n\nThe German attack on the heart of the country, the object of which was to gain possession on the very first day of the centre of government, The Hague, had been repulsed, and all the airfields around The Hague had been recovered. The small bodies of paratroops which were still north of the Meuse no longer presented any real danger. Clearing them up was only a question of time. Rotterdam, however, in so far as it lay south of the Meuse, with the airfield of Waalhaven, had not been recovered. The entire island of IJsselmonde, and the greater portion of the island of Dordrecht, with the two Moerdijk bridges, were in German hands.\n\nIn addition, the entire First Army Corps was engaged with this enemy and was therefore diverted from its proper task, that of forming the reserve for the field army in the Valley position, and, in case of need, re-occupation of the eastern front of the Holland Fortress. In addition, six battalions of the reserve of the great units in the Valley position had been taken away from these units and despatched to the Holland Fortress.\n\nThe Third Army Corps and the Light Division had carried out the retreat indicated above under difficult circumstances practically without loss. The said army corps had taken up its positions on the Waal, while the Light Division had marched forward for the attack on the Waalhaven airfield.\n\n--29--\n\nIX. THE MILITARY OPERATIONS ON THE 11TH MAY\n\n1. The Fighting in the Heart of the Country and on the Southern Front of the Holland Fortress.\n\nOn this day, too, the fifth column operating at The Hague proved very active. The troops composing the first division were engaged for the most part in destroying the last centres of resistance occupied by paratroops in the environs of The Hague.\n\nThe First Battalion of the Brigade of Chasseurs for this purpose carried out engagements at Belvedere in the neighbourhood of Ockenburg, while the Fourth Brigade of Infantry, which was later on reinforced by the Ninth Brigade of Infantry of the third division, was fighting for the possession of the village of Valkenburg. The remaining troops continued to occupy the recovered airfields. At Rotterdam and IJsselmonde the German forces had, however, meantime been continually reinforced.\n\nTrue, the airfield at Waalhaven had been made useless as such by the artillery fire directed on it, but in its place the parking space of Feyenoord was used by the German aircraft in order to land reinforcements.\n\nAs regards means of access to the southern front of the Holland Fortress, the bridge at Heusden had meantime been blown up. The bridge at Keizersveer was in Dutch hands, but was exposed to German air attack during the course of the 11th May, while the Moerdijk bridges were still in German hands.\n\nMeanwhile mechanized parts of the seventh French Army, after marching through Belgium, had reached North Brabant on the 11th May.\n\nRequest was made by the Dutch to the French Supreme Command to push on as rapidly as possible with these forces in order to attack the Moerdijk bridges from the southern side.\n\nThe expectation that German resistance on the island of Dordrecht and IJsselmonde would be broken by the action of the French forces in question, and also by the attack of the light division on the 11th May, was, however, not fulfilled. It is true that a French mechanized squadron made its appearance on the southern bank of the Hollandsch Diep opposite Strijen, but attacks by German bombers compelled these troops to withdraw. The attack of the Light Division over the Noord also made no progress.\n\nAccording to the order of attack of the commander of the light division issued during the evening of the 10th May, at 11 o'clock, the two brigades of cyclists were to cross the Noord on the morning of the 11th May, north and south of Alblasserdam respectively.\n\nAs one battalion of cyclists had been sent to Dordrecht and another was to form the divisional reserve, four battalions were available for attack. When day dawned, the Second Brigade of Cyclists succeeded in getting over a few patrols by surprise. They were, however, unable to maintain themselves in the area occupied by the enemy.\n\nAn attempt made later with bigger forces, 1 km. south of Alblasserdam, was successful to the extent that a first echelon of sixty men reached the west bank. The enemy having meantime received reinforcements, however, these troops were unable to follow up the success they had secured, and it was likewise impossible to reinforce the echelon which had crossed.\n\nAn attempt at crossing north of Alblasserdam was nipped in the bud by murderous fire of enemy machine guns. No artillery support could, as yet, be\n\n--30--\n\ngiven on our side, because the Corps of Horse Artillery had not yet been able to take up any position.\n\nTherefore, on the morning of the 11th May, four battalions of cyclists lay extended along the eastern bank of the Noord.\n\nAt 10.10 a.m. heavy German air attacks were made on these forces. In these circumstances the commander of the Light Division felt that it was impossible for him, with the means at his disposal, to carry out the order to advance to Waalhaven.\n\nThe commander of the Holland Fortress, having been informed of this view, changed his order to the following:\n\nA part of the Light Division was to clear the island of Dordrecht of the enemy and afterwards to endeavour to move on to Waalhaven by way of Wieldrecht, the ferry of 's Gravendeel, and Barendrecht.\n\nThe rest of the Light Division were to hold the east bank of the Noord.\n\nIn addition, another battalion of cyclists was to be placed as speedily as possible at the disposal of the cantonment commander of Dordrecht.\n\nThe execution of this last order was allocated to the First Battalion of the Second Brigade of Cyclists, which was on the farthest southern wing of the position on the Noord.\n\nMeantime, the units in the foremost line were again subjected to violent air bombing at 12.40, 12.50, 2 and 2.15 p.m. The Second Battalion of the Second Brigade of Cyclists were in this way broken up and retreated to the east after the First Battalion of the Second Brigade of Cyclists had marched off at 2 p.m. to Papendrecht, and therefore there were only two battalions of cyclists left on the east bank of the Noord.\n\nMeantime, the Light Division had been reinforced by the Second Motor Cyclist Hussar Regiment, which, having suffered very heavy losses in the fighting at Mill on the 10th May, had returned once more to the division, while the commander of the Third Army Corps also placed the First Brigade of the Eleventh Regiment of Artillery (armed with 10 cm. medium artillery) at the disposal of the Divisional Commander.\n\nThe new orders which were issued by the commander of the Light Division directed that:\n\nA holding group on the Noord should be formed by the First Cyclist Brigade, minus the Second Battalion and First Brigade of the Horse Artillery Corps.\n\nThe principal group, which was to mop up the enemy in the island of Dordrecht, and afterwards to push on to Waalhaven, would consist of the Second Brigade of Cyclists, the Second Battalion of the First Brigade of Cyclists, and the Second Brigade of the Horse Artillery Corps.\n\nThe battalions of cyclists already sent to Dordrecht could therefore be included in this group.\n\nFinally, the divisional reserve could be formed by the machine-gun squadron belonging to the division and Second Motor Cyclist Hussar Regiment. The air forces on that day bombed the German forces south of the Moerdijk. At the same time they brought in reports of the presence of several hundred paratroops, who were stated to be south and south-east of Dordrecht.\n\nThe remainder of the fighter aircraft squadrons, which had fought so bravely, were grouped together. All together these units were left with no more than twelve damaged machines.\n\n--31--\n\n2. The Military Operations in North Brabant.\n\nAfter a night march during the night of the 10th-11th May, the troops occupying the Raam-Peel position, reinforced by some units, which had remained intact, of the troops which originally held the Meuse, reached the Zuid Willemsvaart on the early morning of the 11th May, and occupied the west bank of this canal.\n\nThe retreat took place without interference by the enemy, who, probably misled by the screening force left behind in the position till 4 a.m., did not discover until the morning of the 11th May that the Raam-Peel position had been abandoned by the Dutch troops.\n\nIn order to cover the retreat the First Battalion of the Forty-First Brigade of Infantry had also taken up a position on the eastern border of Helmond.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the troops had been in actual operations uninterruptedly for nearly thirty-six hours, they immediately set to work to put the west bank into a state of defence, and proceeded to destroy the bridges over the canal.\n\nAs was already pointed out when dealing with Dutch geography from the military point of view, the Zuid Willemsvaart is unfavourable as a position. Not only do the dykes restrict the field of fire extremely and make it necessary to arrange the guns in a straight line, without depth, but in addition to this there are extensive built-up areas on the east bank.\n\nA strength of about twelve battalions was still available to hold this position. Here, just as in the Raam-Peel position, anti-aircraft defence and anti-tank defence were entirely lacking, and again, as regards artillery, only a few batteries of 8 cm. (steel) were available. If, in addition, it is taken into consideration that the length of the section to be defended was about 70 km., no great hopes could be entertained as regards the length of time the resistance might last.\n\nOn the morning of the 11th May the Germans drew near chiefly along the axes:\n\nGrave-'s Hertogenbosch;\n\nMill-Uden-Vechel;\n\nVenlo-Helden-Meyel-Asten; and\n\nRoermond-Weert.\n\nAt 11 a.m. German patrols appeared on the east bank.\n\nLittle by little the pressure increased, especially in that part of the position which lay between Someren and Stiphout.\n\nThe Dutch troops tried to prevent passage of the canal with all the weapons at their disposal. Several armoured cars were disabled by the 6 cm. light artillery. The attackers, taking advantage of the very much greater strength of artillery which they possessed, the fire of which they directed particularly to those parts of the canal where there were conglomerations of tall buildings, were able shortly after noon to reach the west bank at several points, among others at Someren and south of Vechel, whereupon they began to roll up the Dutch position.\n\nIn these circumstances a retreat was again ordered, with a view to falling back successively on the lines formed by the Dommel and the Wilhelmina Canal.\n\nMeantime, conditions had become very unfavourable for the Dutch forces fighting here.\n\nThe supply trains of several sections of the forces had fallen into German hands. Other units, which reached the Zuid Willemsvaart at the moment when the bridges over this canal had already been "
