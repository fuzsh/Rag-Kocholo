        "text": "All countries in the region remain vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations or individuals inspired by extremist ideology with little or no warning. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists in Morocco. Long an important counterterrorism partner with the United States, Morocco’s capable security services have taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks. Moroccan authorities continue to disrupt groups seeking to attack U.S. or Western-affiliated and Moroccan government targets, arresting numerous individuals associated with international terrorist groups. Nevertheless, credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in the region, including Morocco. Lone wolf attacks are difficult to detect and disrupt and can occur without warning. In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by three Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) supporters in the Imlil Mountains near Marrakesh. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regards to their personal security.\n\nEstablishments that are identifiable with the United States are potential targets for attacks. These may include facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, movie theaters, U.S. brand establishments, and other public areas. U.S. citizen campers should camp in guarded campgrounds rather than isolated campsites.\n\nDemonstrations: Demonstrations occur frequently in Morocco, are typically focused on political or social issues, and are only rarely confrontational or violent.\n\nDuring periods of heightened regional tension, large demonstrations may take place in major cities.\n\nBy law, all demonstrations require a government permit, but spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations, which have greater potential for violence, can occur. In addition, different unions or groups may organize strikes to protest an emerging issue or government policy.\n\nTravelers should be aware of current events in Morocco and stay informed of regional issues that could resonate in Morocco and create an anti-American response.\n\nAvoid demonstrations if at all possible.\n\nIf caught in a demonstration, remain calm and move away immediately when provided the opportunity.\n\nExercise increased vigilance in areas that attract large crowds, such as sporting events.\n\nWestern Sahara: From 1975 to 1991, Western Sahara was the site of armed conflict between Moroccan government forces and the POLISARIO Front, which continues to seek independence for the territory. Tensions along the border in Western Sahara heightened in November 2020 when Moroccan forces conducted an operation on the border to clear a blockade by the POLISARIO Front; both sides have since engaged in a low intensity conflict along the border. There are thousands of unexploded mines in the Western Sahara and in areas of Mauritania adjacent to the Western Saharan border. Exploding mines are occasionally reported and have caused death and injury. There have been instances in which U.S. citizens suspected of being participants in political protests or of supporting NGOs that are critical of Moroccan policies have been expelled from, or not been allowed to enter, Western Sahara.\n\nCrime: Crime in Morocco is a serious concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas.\n\nUse common sense and the same personal security measures you would normally use in a large U.S. city or tourist destination.\n\nDo not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses, or on tables in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or larger travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, train stations, restaurants, and other public locations.\n\nAggressive panhandling, pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, theft from unoccupied vehicles, and harassment of women are the most frequently reported issues.\n\nCriminals use weapons, primarily knives, during some street robberies and burglaries. These crimes have occurred at any time of day or night, not only in isolated places or areas less frequented by visitors, but in crowded areas as well.\n\nResidential break-ins also occur and have on occasion turned violent, but most criminals look for opportunities based on stealth rather than confrontation.\n\nTravelers should avoid soccer stadiums and their environs on days of scheduled matches as large groups of team supporters have been known to become unruly and harass and assault bystanders.\n\nJoggers should be mindful of traffic and remain in more heavily populated areas. It is always best to have a jogging companion, dress modestly, and avoid isolated areas or jogging at night.\n\nAt night and when moving about unfamiliar areas, avoid traveling alone and utilize “petit” taxis which vary by color in the major cities (Casablanca-Red, Rabat-Blue, Marrakech-Tan, etc.).\n\nTaxis* in Morocco are generally crime-free during day time, although city buses are not considered safe.\n\nTrains are generally safe, but theft, regardless of the time of day, sometimes occurs.\n\nAvoid carrying large sums of cash and be particularly alert when using ATM machines. In the event you are victimized by crime or an attempted crime, please report the incident to the local police and the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca as soon as possible.\n\n* NOTE: Some popular web-based ride-sharing services have operated in Morocco; however, the French-based company Heetch is currently the only service legally authorized to operate by the Moroccan Government. Media report that drivers of web-based ride-sharing services have been harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers in the recent past.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crimes should contact the local police at 19 from a land line or 190 from a mobile phone, and the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca at (212) 522 64 20 99. Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care;\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police;\n\nwith written consent, contact your relatives or friends;\n\nexplain the local criminal justice process in general terms;\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys;\n\nprovide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States;\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution;\n\nhelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home;\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated in major tourist areas. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. However, outside of these areas, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nCrimes of fraud, including passing bad checks, non-payment of bills (including hotel bills), or breach of contract are considered serious in Morocco and can often result in imprisonment and/or fines.\n\nBail generally is not available to non-residents of Morocco who are arrested for crimes involving fraud.\n\nDebtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties.\n\nPassports may be seized by the Moroccan government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases.\n\nDebtors may be unable to work in Morocco without passports while still being held responsible for their debts.\n\nPrior to entering into a contract, you may want to consider consulting an attorney.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: Islam is the official religion in Morocco. However, the constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion. The Moroccan government does not interfere with public worship by the country’s Jewish minority or by expatriate Christians. Proselytizing is, however, prohibited. In the past, U.S. citizens have been arrested, detained, and/or expelled for discussing or trying to engage Moroccans in debate about Christianity. In February 2014, several U.S. citizens were expelled from Morocco for alleged proselytizing. Many of those expelled were long-time Moroccan residents. In these cases, U.S. citizens were given no more than 48 hours to gather their belongings or settle their affairs before being expelled. See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report.\n\nLGBTI Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Morocco. Penalties include fines and jail time. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Morocco, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is customary in the United States.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: Women walking alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are particularly vulnerable to assault by men. They should exercise caution when in public spaces, including nightclubs or other social establishments. Women are advised to travel with a companion or in a group when possible and to ignore any harassment. See our tips for Women Travelers.\n\nCustoms: Travelers must declare large quantities of U.S. dollars brought into the country at the port of entry. The export of Moroccan currency (dirhams) is prohibited; however, Moroccan currency can be converted back into U.S. dollars prior to departure only if the traveler has a bank or money transfer receipt indicating he or she exchanged dollars for dirhams while in Morocco.\n\nMoroccan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Morocco of items such as firearms, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drones, religious materials, antiquities, business equipment, and large quantities of currency. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C., or the Moroccan Consulate General in New York for specific information concerning customs requirements.\n\nPlease see our information on Customs and Import Restrictions.\n\nCitizenship: The Government of Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In addition to being subject to all U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who also possess the nationality of Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Morocco. Recently, Morocco has begun allowing Moroccan mothers of children born outside Morocco to petition for their children’s citizenship. For further information on that process, please contact the Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C., or the Moroccan Consulate General in New York.\n\nResidency Permits: In order to obtain a residence permit, travelers must present (among other requirements) a criminal history record check. This record check can only be obtained in the United States. The U.S. Consulate and Embassy are unable to take fingerprints to send for FBI record requests. For specific information, individuals seeking residency should visit their local police station.\n\nThe following documents must accompany a residency renewal application:\n\nBirth Certificate\n\nCopy of the current passport\n\nCopy of the current Moroccan residency card\n\nMedical certificate from a doctor stating that the requester is free from any contagious disease\n\nCourt record (Casier Judiciaire) obtained from the Ministry of Justice in Rabat\n\n100 MAD stamp\n\nIndividuals planning on residing in Morocco or relocating to the U.S. may be asked to provide a notarized change of residence form. This form is available at the U.S. Consulate by appointment.\n\nSending Passports through the Mail: According to Moroccan law, it is prohibited to send passports by mail across international borders. Passports sent to or through Morocco via Fedex, DHL, or other courier will be confiscated by Moroccan authorities. Confiscated U.S. passports are eventually sent to the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca after being processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If your passport has been confiscated, you can contact the American Citizens Services section at acscasablanca@state.gov to ask if it has been received.\n\nProperty: U.S. consular officers are prohibited by law and regulation from accepting personal property for safekeeping regardless of the circumstances involved. If there is concern over the protection of property left behind in Morocco due to confiscation or deportation for political, legal, or other reasons, U.S. citizens should take every precaution to ensure that available legal safeguards are in place either before, or immediately after, purchasing property in Morocco or taking up residence there. U.S. citizens are also encouraged to consider assigning a Power of Attorney, or Procuration, to be used in Morocco if necessary. More information and sample Power of Attorney forms are available on the Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in New York website.\n\nPhotographing Sensitive Locations: Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities. As a general rule, travelers should not photograph palaces, diplomatic missions, government buildings, or other sensitive facilities and when in doubt should ask permission from the appropriate Moroccan authorities.\n\nProfessional Basketball in Morocco: The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is aware that there are local professional basketball teams who have made contracts with U.S. citizens to play on Moroccan teams. Some of these players have subsequently claimed they were not paid as stipulated per the terms of the contract. Individuals considering playing basketball professionally in Morocco may wish to consult with a lawyer regarding the terms of their contract prior to signing. A list of lawyers can be found on the Embassy's webpage."
