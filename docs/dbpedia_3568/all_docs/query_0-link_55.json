        "text": "Welcome to the Royal Air Forces Association’s (RAFA) Amsterdam Branch’s new website which is under construction. RAFA is a forward looking organization and a registered charity, with over 63,500 members world-wide, and provides friendship and welfare support for serving and ex-serving RAF personnel and their dependants – over 40,000 individuals are helped each year. We hope that as you read further through the links on our website that you will be enthused to join our Branch. Over the years that our Branch has been active, we have been very fortunate in having people prepared to give of their time and talents in assisting the Royal Air Force Family; sadly many are no longer with us, but if you are a member who has not joined in for a while it would be great to see you again, we know you will still have plenty to offer. Join our branch or get involved."
