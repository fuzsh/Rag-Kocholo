[1]As such, it was designed as a cheap and small, but rugged aircraft, which had respectable performance for its time. Entering service in the early years of World War II, it provided yeoman work for both the Luchtvaartafdeeling (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force also a few were built by the Carmoli factory before the factory fell into Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n-Wikipedia\n\nThis unit uses the fighter animations, please point there in your XML.\n\nPoly Count: 728\n\nFokker G.I:\n\nThe Fokker G.I was a Dutch heavy twin-engined fighter plane comparable in size and role to the German Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the British Mosquito.\n\n-Wikipedia\n\nThis unit uses the bomber animations, please point there in your XML.\n\nPoly Count: 706\n\nFokker T.V:\n\nThe Fokker T.V was a twin-engine bomber, described as an \"aerial cruiser\"[1], built by Fokker for the Netherlands Air Force. It was modern for its time but by the German invasion of 1940 it was outclassed by the airplanes of the Luftwaffe. Nevertheless the T.V was used successfully against the German onslaught. The T.V and Fokker G.1 were the only aircraft of the Dutch air force that were equipped with retractable landing gear. As the T.V lacked self-sealing fuel tanks they gained a reputation for rapidly catching fire when hit by enemy fire.\n\n-Wikipedia\n\nThis unit uses the bomber animations, please point there in your XML.\n\nPoly Count: 744\n\nDOWNLOAD HERE\n\nENJOY!\n\n-Smitty\n\nesnaz\n\nKing\n\nJoined\n\nMay 7, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n708\n\nLocation\n\nUSA\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#2\n\nAnother great looking unit, good job\n\nGaius Octavius\n\nDeity\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n4,016\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#3\n\nThank you!\n\nI know several places where they will get lots of use...\n\nsnafusmith\n\nUnit Maker\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,549\n\nLocation\n\nI've been everywhere, man\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#4\n\nThank you!\n\nI know several places where they will get lots of use...\n\nThanks!\n\nThey'll go especially well in a WW2 Pacific mod - though the camo is appropriate for the RNAF, the markings are actually those of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force.\n\nWolfshanze\n\nCFC Historian\n\nJoined\n\nNov 12, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n5,689\n\nLocation\n\nFlorida\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#5\n\nGreat Snafu... simply great. Now we have some proper Dutch Air Force units.\n\nOne special note worth mentioning... and I know it's not your fault... but when you use the \"bomber\" animations on a fighter (which has previously been done with the American P-38 Lightning), the interception animations get really freaky... because you'll see the twin-engine fighter go after the enemy aircraft, but instead of shooting at the enemy plane (as the fighter animation does), the twin-engine fighter will string a trail of bombs from mid air miles away from home, all the way back to his HOME BASE!\n\nSo if a twin-engine fighter intercepts an enemy plane six squares away from it's base, it will chase after the enemy aircraft then string a trail of bombs back to it's starting friendly base!\n\nThe devil is in the details, I know!\n\nGreat work as always Snafu!\n\nsnafusmith\n\nUnit Maker\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,549\n\nLocation\n\nI've been everywhere, man\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#6\n\nOne special note worth mentioning... and I know it's not your fault... but when you use the \"bomber\" animations on a fighter (which has previously been done with the American P-38 Lightning), the interception animations get really freaky... because you'll see the twin-engine fighter go after the enemy aircraft, but instead of shooting at the enemy plane (as the fighter animation does), the twin-engine fighter will string a trail of bombs from mid air miles away from home, all the way back to his HOME BASE!\n\nSo if a twin-engine fighter intercepts an enemy plane six squares away from it's base, it will chase after the enemy aircraft then string a trail of bombs back to it's starting friendly base!\n\nThe devil is in the details, I know!\n\nYeah, I know - I don't use it as a fighter, but as a ground-pounder with good defense.\n\nGeneralMatt\n\nEmperor\n\nJoined\n\nJul 10, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,980\n\nLocation\n\nCanada\n\nJan 13, 2008\n\n#7\n\nNot to sound dumb, but the Netherlands had a Airforce in WWII.

Their navy didn't last much longer either. Oh, and that nice model of the USS Langley got sunk ferrying fighters to Dutch Java in 1942.\n\nasioasioasio\n\nFallout Scrubber\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n3,058\n\nLocation\n\nPoland, EU\n\nJan 14, 2008\n\n#9\n\nBeuatiful.
