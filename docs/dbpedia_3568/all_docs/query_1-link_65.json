        "text": "Philadelphia, Nov. 14, 2022 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] delivered the 20th CH-47F Chinook to the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), concluding the country’s latest fleet update.\n\n“Our continuing partnership with the Royal Netherlands Air Force exemplifies the value of a modern and versatile Chinook fleet,” said Ken Eland, vice president and H-47 program manager. “These state-of-the art aircraft will significantly improve their defense and humanitarian assistance capabilities.”\n\nThe Netherlands is one of eight NATO countries to operate the Chinook and has fielded the aircraft continuously since receiving its first CH-47D models in 1995. In 2016, the RNLAF purchased14 new CH-47F Chinooks through the U.S. Department of Defense’s Foreign Military Sales program. In 2017, the RNLAF signed an agreement to upgrade their remaining six D-model Chinook helicopters to the latest F-model configuration, ensuring commonality of systems for their entire 20-aircraft fleet.\n\n“This is a milestone for us. We have newer radios and newer equipment which help our pilots operate better in different environments than we do already,” said LTC Wil van Rijn, senior system integrator of the Chinook, Dutch Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe CH-47F Chinook is an advanced multi-mission helicopter containing a fully integrated, digital cockpit management system compatible with Common Avionics Architecture System. Its advanced cargo-handling capabilities further complement the aircraft’s mission performance and handling characteristics.\n\nPhoto courtesy Boeing"
