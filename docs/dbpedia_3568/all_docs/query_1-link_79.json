        "text": "McConnell Air Force Base has recovered and injuries are few after a violent storm raked the flightline ahead of a large airshow on Aug. 25. Surprisingly little damage was inflicted on the 80 or so static display operational and historic aircraft on display.\n\nThe Space Force’s highest ranking enlisted leader offered more details on a new training program for noncommissioned officers, the latest move by the service to customize its training and development enterprise.\n\nA social media storm kicked off earlier this month about whether Airmen at Nellis Air Force Base can wear boonie hats during the hot summer months.\n\nThe Air Force’s first mission-ready EA-37 Compass Call aircraft flew into Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., last week, the start of a major upgrade to the service’s electronic warfare fleet.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force’s plan to operate from an expanded network of bases around the Pacific is facing a familiar but fundamental challenge: how to protect those locations from a Chinese missile attack. The Air Force and Army say they are working on a solution.\n\nFour of the last F-15Cs stationed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan flew back to the U.S. for retirement or reassignment on Aug. 24. As the F-15C/D presence winds down, its replacement, the F-15EX, is spooling up, with new aircraft added and a declaration of initial operational capability stateside\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. John E. Shaw is often credited as the Pentagon's trailblazer in advocating for dynamic space operations. Now, he wants the military to get more dynamic in how it monitors and tracks objects and threats in orbit, as part of a broader shift and upgrade in space domain…\n\nThe Space Force has awarded Northrop Grumman a $200 million contract to build a cutting-edge space radar in the United Kingdom, part of a joint venture between the U.S., U.K., and Australia to monitor 22,000 miles above the Earth around the clock."
