        "text": "U.S. Army Special Operations Forces\n\nTIMELINE\n\nWorld War I\n\nWWI\n\n28 JUL 1914 – 11 NOV 1918\n\nMost ARSOF units derive their lineage from World War II legacy units, but Psychological Operations and Civil Affairs/Military Government trace their roots to World War I, which the U.S. entered on 6 April 1917. In 1918, the War Department and American Expeditionary Forces established sections to perform propaganda activities. After the Armistice, the Army conducted Military Government operations in Germany and Russia. It also published American Military Government of Occupied Germany in 1920, which laid a solid groundwork for Civil Affairs during World War II. However, combat propaganda was a casualty of postwar demobilization and the lean Great Depression years, forcing the Army to re-learn this capability in the early 1940s.\n\n1917\n\nU.S. entered WWI\n\nContextual events\n\n6 APR 1917 U.S. declared war on Germany, citing its use of unrestricted submarine warfare, and declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on 7 DEC\n\n18 MAY 1917 President Woodrow Wilson the signed Selective Service Act into law, requiring American males aged 21 to 30 to register for the draft\n\n26 MAY 1917 American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) established\n\n25 JUN 1917 First AEF troops arrived in France\n\n7 NOV 1917 In the October Revolution, Bolsheviks seized Petrograd, toppling the Provisional Russian government and establishing the Russian Soviet Republic the following January\n\n22 DEC 1917 Led by Vladimir Lenin, Russia opened peace negotiations with Germany\n\n1918\n\nPsychological Subsection Established. CPT Heber Blankenhorn, Psychological (Propaganda) Subsection established under the purview of Military Intelligence within the War Department General Staff.\n\nPhoto: Captain Heber Blankenhorn\n\nAmerican Expeditionary Force’s Propaganda Campaign Began. The Propaganda Section disseminated more than 3 million leaflets targeting enemy forces during WWI.\n\nContextual events\n\nThe “Spanish Flu” began, killing some 50 million people worldwide over two years\n\n8 JAN 1918 President Wilson announced his postwar aims, called the \"Fourteen Points\"\n\n3 MAR 1918 Russia and Germany signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, ending Russian involvement in WWI\n\n15 JUL 1918-3 AUG 1918 In the Second Battle of the Marne, Allies checked the final German offensive of the war before it reached Paris\n\n26 SEP 1918 AEF began Meuse-Argonne offensive, the largest and costliest American military operation of WWI\n\n3 NOV 1918 Austria-Hungary agreed to an armistice with the Allies, ending combat on the Italian Front\n\n11 NOV 1918 Germany and the Allies agreed to terms for armistice\n\nPost-WWI\n\nPost-WWI\n\n11 NOV 1918 – 7 DEC 1941\n\nU.S. Military Government Began in Germany. Army occupation lasted until 11 July 1923.\n\nAmerican Military Government in Siberia. The Expeditionary Force conducted duties until 1 April 1920.
