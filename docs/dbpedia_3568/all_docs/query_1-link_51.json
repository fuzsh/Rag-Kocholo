        "text": "F-35â€™s of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) have arrived in Bulgaria. Together with the Bulgarian Air Force they will safeguard the NATO-airspace over Bulgaria out of Graf Ignatievo Airforce Base from April up and until May 31.\n\nThe surveillance of NATO airspace (Air Policing) is a task that is performed 24 hours a day, also in the Netherlands. Civilian and military aircraft that do not comply with the international agreements for the use of airspace or that approach NATO airspace without permission, may be intercepted by deployment of (armed) fighter aircraft (Quick Reaction Alert).\n\nWhile deployed in Bulgaria, Netherlands F-35s, will perform this task in co-operation with the Bulgarian Air Force. Air Policing shows that the Allies are willing to combine and share capabilities for the benefit of collective defence.\n\nThe F35s are originated to the 322 Fighter Squadron that operates normally out of Leeuwarden Air Force Base."
