        "text": "If the fans of Indian cinema take pride in how films today make use of cutting edge technology, credit should go to Sivaji Ganesan's Uthama Purthiran.\n\nFrom Tamil cinema’s first rock and roll dance to Indian film Industry's first introduction to zooming techniques, Sivaji Ganesan has been a pioneer. And he's done it all in Uthama Purthiran, as early on as 1958. Produced by CV Sridhar, S Krishnamoorthy and T Govindarajan, this historical Tamil film was first to feature Sivaji Ganesan in two distinct roles. This trilingual film ran for more than 100 days back then. Uthama Puthiran was a remake of PU Chinnapa’s 1940 film of the same title, and it was the first film in Tamil cinema to feature dual roles. Interestingly, even this film is loosely inspired by the Hollywood classic, The Man in the Iron Mask (1939).\n\nadvertisement\n\nStarring Sivaji, Padmini and M. N Nambiar in the lead, Uthama Puthiran was also known for roping in Bollywood actress Helen for a song, which was said to be the first song in Tamil cinema to have a rock and roll sequence. Yaaradi Nee Mohini was shot in exotic palace sets and became a raging hit.\n\nHow zoom lens came into cinema\n\nThe entire cast and crew of Uthama Puthiran were filming an outdoor sequence for the romantic song Unnazhagi, picturised on Sivaji and Padmini at Brindavan Gardens in Mysore. Sridhar, the writer, the director and the cinematographer Aloysius Vincent were helming the song. As the crowd cheered the shoot, a man of French origin walked onto the sets and change the fate of Indian cinema.\n\nWhen Vincent was composing the shot with Sivaji and Padmini, this man simultaneously composed the same shot at the same angle with his camera. Sridhar and the director asked him why he was filming the song. He, in turn, requested the producers of the film to allow him to shoot the same scene in his camera.\n\nWhen he started to film the song, everyone on the sets starred at his camera, as the lens on it began to move backwards. Sridhar quizzed him about it and he said his camera has a technology that can project the objects closer than they actually are. He said he could capture crystal clear pictures in motion. That’s when the zoom technique forayed into Indian cinema.\n\nWhen he showed the cinematographer the portion he had shot, he was immediately requested to give them the clip so they could use it in the song. The French man went back to his country and sent the crew the video clip. It was liked by all, and the makers of the film included his shot in the song, becoming the first Indian film to use the zoom technique. That shot is the one where Sivaji and Padmini would be seen in a close-up.\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Ram Gopal Varma hated Boney Kapoor for turning Sridevi into an ordinary housewife\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Dilip Kumar's Mughal-e-Azam was the first Bollywood film shot in three languages"
