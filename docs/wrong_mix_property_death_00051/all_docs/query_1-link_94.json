        "text": "Heroes' debut but legends endure. Sivaji Ganesan is a phenomenon, but faced unimaginable odds before his first film saw light of the day.\n\nIn 1951, Parasakthi was a popular play written by Pavalar Balasundaram, a Tamil scholar. At the same time, there was another play, titled En Thangai, which was also a hit. Perumal Mudalyar, a producer, picked up Sivaji Ganesan from a group of theatre artists, when he was performing for En Thangai as a man who sacrifices his love for the sake of his blind sister. Impressed by his acting talent, Perumal Mudalyar wanted to do a film featuring Sivaji in the lead.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe storyline of the play, Parasakthi, grabbed Perumal Mudalyar, who immediately decided to buy the rights of it through the patronage of AV Meiyappan of AVM Productions. Sivaji was roped in to play the lead and DMK supremo, the late M Karunanidhi, was roped in to write the script. The shoot began and everythign went as planned. More than 50 per cent of the film was shot and that's when the problem for Nadigar Thilagam began.\n\nWhen Perumal Mudalyar showed a few scenes that were shot to AV Meiyyappan, he wasn't satisfied. Even the directors of the film, Krishnan and Panchu, weren't impressed with the actor's screen presence. Meiyyapan asked Perumal Mudalyar to put the shoot on hold. He felt that audience would only want to see a handsome face on screen and asked him to replace Sivaji with actor KR Ramasami. However, Perumal Mudalyar, stood firm in his decision and said that he will be not replace him with any other actors. He felt that Sivaji is a gift to Tamil cinema and did his best to set right the actor's on-screen looks. He asked Sivaji to stay at his place until the issue gets sorted out.\n\nSivaji acted in Parasakthi, and the crew was also impressed with his performance. Also Raju Sulochana was initially cast as female lead in the film, but she was pregnant then and had to opt out of the project. She was replaced by Telugu actress Sriranjini Jr.\n\nAnother slew of troubles came the makers way. Few miscreants spread rumours that the film had blasphemous dialogues and elements that could stir controversy. A section of people demanded that the film be banned and delayed its release. There is a dialogue in the film in which Sivaji says, Ambal verum Kal (God is just a stone), which filmmakers decided to remove and release the film.\n\nSivaji Ganesan emerged as the hero, as his acting was loved by people and the film was declared a hit. From then on, he was flooded with offers from many industries. The rest is history.\n\nInterestingly, Sivaji shot for his second film, Poongodhai, even before Parasakthi. But then due to various reasons, Parasakthi turned out to be his debut film.\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Sivaji Ganesan's Andha Naal gave Kollywood its first flashback\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Why Andaz Apna Apna director Rajkumar Santoshi tied Karisma and Raveena to a pole"
