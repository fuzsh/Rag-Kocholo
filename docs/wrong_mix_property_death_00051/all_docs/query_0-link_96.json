        "text": "Nearly 10 years later, Ramarajan’s fans would get to see him on screen. The actor is back with Medhai. This film’s audio was launched recently by Abhirami Ramanathan and VC Guhanathan and R Parthiban received the first copy.\n\nSpeaking at the Medhai audio launch event, VC Guhanathan said that Ramarajan is one of the few actors after MGR and Sivaji Ganesan to act for small banners. He recalled that MGR had starred in 22 films for Devar Films because its founder Chinnappa Devar acted with him in a small role in a film. Likewise, Sivaji Ganesan also made his tailor as a producer.\n\nAn emotional Ramarajan said that his fans meant more to him than his parents."
