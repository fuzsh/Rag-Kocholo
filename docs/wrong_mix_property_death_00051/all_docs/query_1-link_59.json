        "text": "The Tamil film industry has been producing some highly engaging films in recent times. Amid all the releases, a film from the past was re-released recently. This film was none other than Vasantha Maligai, starring Sivaji Ganesan and Vanisri. The film was originally released in 1972 and became an instant hit with the audience. Now, it has been found that the film has been re-released for the sixth time and is still going strong.\n\nSivaji Ganesanâ€™s Vasantha Maligai was released last week at the Albert Theatre in Chennai. In 1972, Vasantha Maligai was released in three theatres in Chennai, and the first 271 shows were housefuls in all three theatres. This was an achievement at that time, as the film ran successfully for almost 750 days in theatres.\n\nAfter having a successful run, the superhit film was re-released several times. When it was re-released in 2019, the film ran for 100 days in Chennai. Currently, two shows are screened daily at 3:00 pm and 6:30 pm. at the Albert Theatre. The theatre owners have revealed that the number of people who came to see Vasantha Maligai was higher than the number who saw the new films on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nVasantha Maligai is a remake of the Telugu film Prema Nagar. It is a romantic film and the audience loved the performances of Sivaji Ganesan and Vanisri. The film was directed by KS Prakash Rao and produced by D. Ramanaidu under the banner of Vijaya Suresh Combines. The music was composed by KV Mahadevan, and the cinematography was handled by Vincent.\n\nEarlier, it was reported that Jayalalithaa was the first to be signed to play the lead role in the film. But at that time, her mother died, and she was unable to act in the film. As a result, Vanisri was chosen to play the female lead. Vasantha Maligai created various records during its release and continues to do so even after its several re-releases in theatre."
