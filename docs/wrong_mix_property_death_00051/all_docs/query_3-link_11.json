He aims to establish a non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Emerson, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service, but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high that he has to mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Emerson regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji falls in love with a girl named Thenmozhi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Thenmozhi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.\n\nFollowing the loss in the court case, Thenmozhi requests Sivaji out of fear not to come for her again. Sivaji is reduced to utter poverty. Realising that the methods he used are unlikely to work again, he decides to play the game his own way. Sivaji, with the help of his uncle Vittal Prasad, acquires evidence of ₹2 billion worth of illegal earnings in Emerson's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Emerson into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by hawala forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to Sivaji Foundation, making the money usable and legitimate.\n\nSivaji informs the Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Emerson) and gets them arrested. He reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu. Led by Emerson, those who were blackmailed by Sivaji exploit Thenmozhi's innocence to silence him. Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Emerson with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.\n\nEmerson and the police order Sivaji to unlock his laptop. When Sivaji refuses, Emerson tortures him, leaving him for dead. To cover this up, Emerson and the police organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like a murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Raphael, Thenmozhi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Raphael revives him using a defibrillator. Following Sivaji's \"death\", Emerson and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the voice-detection program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased.\n\nA few days later, while everyone wonders about the future of Sivaji Foundation, the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of an NRI friend, Luthfudeen. Though Emerson immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji, he is unable to prove this to the police due to the proof of Sivaji's \"death\" and Ravichandran's identity. Later, Sivaji confronts Emerson and the two fight atop the terrace of Emerson's medical college. During the fight, Emerson inadvertently strikes the campus's terrace roof causing money hidden in it to fly around the campus. The students spot the money and go after it, causing a stampede in Emerson which is trampled to death. Sivaji Foundation soon becomes a frontier for India's economic and industrial rise.\n\nCast[]\n\nVenkat Raghunathan as Sivaji (Luthfudeen)[4]\n\nSreeja as Thenmozhi[5]\n\nSairam Sukumaran as Vittal Prasad[5]\n\nJagapati Babu as Emerson[4]\n\nAkkineni Nagarjuna as Dr. Raphael[5]\n\nSathyaraj as Aalavandhan\n\nPremi Venkat as Mrs. Aalavandhan\n\nSreenivasan as F.

Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled Mudhalvan (1999) having Rajinikanth in mind for the lead role.[9] However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to schedule conflicts with Padayappa (1999).[10] Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja.[11] Post Anniyan (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.[12]\n\nIn August 2005, Rajinikanth signed up for his next film which was to be produced by Chennai's oldest operative studio, AVM Productions, which was run by M. S. Guhan and M. Saravanan.[13][14] This time Shankar was confirmed to be the film's director.[13] After consulting Sivaji Ganesan's family to avoid any issues with the film's name, the project was subsequently announced on 24 August 2005.[15] The film was titled Sivaji,[15] after Rajinikanth's name at birth – Sivaji Rao Gaekwad. A tagline, The Boss, which stands for \"Bachelor of Social Service\", was suffixed to the title.[16]\n\nIn addition to being AVM Productions' 168th film,[17] Sivaji was also Rajinikanth's 154th film,[13] his 100th Tamil film[c] and his ninth film with AVM Productions.[13] According to Rajinikanth's biographer Naman Ramachandran, the film was also made to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of the production company's founder, A. V. Meiyappan.[19] Sivaji was also noted for its change in the traditional yellow coloured Rajinikanth introductory text which made its debut with Annaamalai (1992). Instead the text is displayed in Chrome.[20]\n\nCast and crew[]\n\nThe first choice for the role of the female lead was Aishwarya Rai.[21] However, in October 2005, Shankar and Rajinikanth announced that actress Shriya Saran would play the female lead role.[22] Saran's voice was dubbed by actress Kanika, who was selected after a successful voice test,[23] thereby collaborating for the second time with Shankar.[d] Actor Vivek was signed up for the role of Sivaji's maternal uncle, Arivu, in November 2005.[24] Actress Sunaina made her acting debut through this film in a special appearance; the scene however was later removed from the final cut.[25][26] Nayantara, who had earlier worked with Rajinikanth in Chandramukhi, was signed up to perform alongside Rajinikanth in the song \"Baleilakka\".[27][28]\n\nSuman was confirmed in March 2006 to play the role of Adiseshan after Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal and Prakash Raj were considered.[29] Sathyaraj, who acted with Rajinikanth in Mr. Bharath (1986), said he declined the role because, \"After a film of the calibre of Mr. Bharath with Rajnikanth, I couldn't settle for anything less. So I didn't accept Sivaji.\"[30] For his role, Suman removed his moustache and used dentures to make his smile visible.[31] Shankar instructed one of the costume designers to give the character a spotless white dhoti, shirt, shoes, a Rolex watch and Ray-Ban sunglasses.[31] Prior to this, Suman had acted with Rajinikanth in Thee (1981).[32] Subbu Panchu Arunachalam, son of filmmaker Panchu Arunachalam, dubbed for Suman.[33] Debate speakers Solomon Pappaiah and Pattimandram Raja were selected to play supporting roles, with the latter making his cinematic acting debut.[34][35][36] Vadivukkarasi and Manivannan were selected to play Sivaji's parents.[37][38] Raghuvaran appeared in a small role as Dr. Chezhian.[5]\n\nShankar, who also wrote the film's story and screenplay,[39] was paid a then record salary of ₹30 million (Indian rupees)[e] for the project.[41] A. R. Rahman, who was selected to compose the film's soundtrack and background score, was also paid ₹30 million.[42][e] Sujatha Rangarajan was assigned to write the dialogues for Sivaji.[39] Tha. Prabhu Raja Cholan, who would later direct the film Karuppampatti (2013), worked as an assistant director in this film.[43] Rajinikanth's daughter Soundarya worked as a graphics designer, creating the title for this film; she had earlier worked in the same position on two of her father's films – Baba (2002) and Chandramukhi (2005).[44] K. V. Anand was hired as the cinematographer in August 2005.[45] Manish Malhotra was responsible for designing the film's costumes,[46] while Anthony and Thota Tharani were the editor and art director respectively.[39] Additional make-up for Rajinikanth was done by make-up artist Banu.[47]\n\nFilming[edit][]\n\nPrincipal photography commenced on 28 November 2005 with a puja at AVM Productions. The film's launch was a secret event, with only pivotal members of the cast and crew being called for the event's attendance.[24] The first schedule of Sivaji began on 14 December 2005 with the song \"Vaaji Vaaji\" featuring Rajinikanth and Saran being shot at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.[48][49] The idea of shooting at Ramoji Film City was suggested to Shankar by Tharani who felt that the place offered a lot of scope for him to utilise his skills and experience as an art director.[49] \"Vaaji Vaaji\" was picturised with an intention to showcase a Babylonian palace setting when Shankar requested Tharani to show \"a palace with lots of colour\".[49] Tharani created a four-storey Babylonian palace to accommodate 80 dancers and 100 junior artists for the number.[50] Shooting of the number, which according to K. V. Anand was filmed in Super 35 motion picture film format, was completed in eight days.[51] G. Dhananjayan mentions in his book The Best of Tamil Cinema that ₹35 million[e] was spent on the song's making.[52]\n\nI decided to have a glass dome depicting four seasons. But Shankar was specific, saying he wanted the desert and the flowers look. So, we decided to have desert on one side and rocks, waterfalls and flowers on the other.\n\nTharani described the set designing for the song \"Sahana\", which was also shot at Ramoji Film City, as \"extremely challenging\".[53] After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional calendar seasons, Tharani thought of using a concept titled Living in Seasons, which he used at a symposium held in Japan.[f] For the set's design which depicted the four seasons, Tharani proposed three concepts – a traditional Japanese house, a contemporary house and a futuristic house. Shankar chose the futuristic house concept, which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square, a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another.[53] The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock, which would seep under the set. Tharani made use of acrylic glass and normal glass with the former being implemented on the floor to make the dance movements more easier to perform. Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30 days.[55]\n\nIn addition to these two songs, Tharani contributed to similar creations for the music store where Tamizhselvi works as a saleswoman, the street surrounding the music store, the warehouse behind the music store, the interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house and Adiseshan's office room.[54] The music shop was designed in the Victorian architecture style, while the warehouse was constructed at AVM Productions with the fight sequence being filmed there as well.[56] Filming of another action sequence in an open-air theatre, which was also designed by Tharani, took place for approximately 15–20 days.[57] K. V. Anand used balloon lights brought from a French company Airstar Space Lighting for the sequence.[57][58] The interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house was designed using clippings of flats constructed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board.[59]\n\nThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao which features in \"Style\".[3]\n\nThe \"Style\" segment was filmed in May 2006 at the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain,[3][60] as well as the City of Arts and Sciences.[61] The fair look of Rajinikanth's character in the segment was created using computer-generated imagery, which was performed by V. Srinivas Mohan, the head of the Chennai-based firm Indian Artists. K. V. Anand re-shot every single movement of Rajinikanth with a British woman named Jacky, who was also one of the song's background dancers. All the shots featuring Rajinikanth in the song and those featuring Jacky were scanned in 4K resolution to enhance their clarity after which Jacky's skin colour was digitally implemented onto Rajinikanth's skin.[62] French hair-stylist Sandrin Veriar Seth designed two distinct hair-styles for the entire film and 13 hair-styles for the segment alone.[63] To avoid disruptions that could occur at the shooting spot due to Rajinikanth's fan following in Tamil Nadu, Brinda choreographed \"Balleilakka\", Rajinikanth's introduction song sequence in Wai, a hill station near Pune with 500 people for eight days.[28] To add more colour to the sequence, a 50-member team of Puli Kali artists from Thrissur were employed by Shankar as background dancers.[64]\n\nIn November 2006, sequences featuring Rajinkanth, Saran and Vivek were shot at the Pune Junction railway station.[65] Filming of a key portion involving Rajinikanth and Vivek took place in the Victoria Public Hall building in Chennai.[66][67] A fight sequence and the song \"Athiradi\" were filmed at Binny Mills. The sets for the song were made bearing resemblance to the city of Venice.[68] For the climax scenes, which were filmed at the Magarpatta city SEZ towers, Rajinikanth tonsured his head.[69][70] The scenes where Sivaji gets the money he transferred to his friends by forgery were filmed in New York City.[71] The completion of those scenes in February 2007 marked the end of the principal photography.[72] The climactic fight between Sivaji and Adiseshan was filmed at Vels University.[73] K. V. Anand told Shobha Warrier of Rediff that the portions other than the songs and action sequences were completed in 65 days.[74] For the film's dubbed Telugu version, Rajinikanth reshot some scenes.[75]\n\nThemes and influences[edit][]\n\nMany critics stated that the theme of Sivaji has been inspired from Shankar's previous films Gentleman (1993) and Mudhalvan (1999).[76] The film deals with the concept of corruption and money laundering and how the film's protagonist employs methods to get rid of those elements.[77] Gopinath Rajendran of The New Indian Express compared the film's title character to Robin Hood for being a hero \"who takes from the rich and passes it on to the poor\".[78]\n\nSivaji, who is a software engineer is frustrated with the corruption in India which is shown in the scene where he watches the pitiable condition of poor people stating that: \"The rich get richer, the poor get poorer\".[79] Sivaji's love for his country is also illustrated in a scene where he is advised by his uncle to go back to abroad but he says \"Where else will I go? This is home.\"[80]\n\nSoundtrack[edit][]\n\nMain article: Sivaji (soundtrack)\n\nAfter some re-recording of the background score in Paraguay,[81] A.R. Rahman had been to London for additional re-recording.[81][82]\n\nA month and a half prior to the film's official soundtrack release, three songs from the soundtrack were leaked into the Internet. The songs, however, were only unofficial with low quality, where the official versions were composed slightly different and sung by different artists.[83][84][85]\n\nRelease[edit][]\n\nThe television rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar TV for ₹40 million.[86] The film's distribution rights, as distributed by AVM Productions to various companies are ₹35 million (US$490,000) for the selling of rights to Kerala, ₹140 million (US$2.0 million) for Andhra Pradesh and ₹139.5 million (US$2.0 million) for the rights to Ayngaran, an international Tamil film distributor. The trailer was released by CNN-IBN on 30 May 2007 lasting for three minutes.[87] The official trailer was released by AVM to Galatta.com, the official online sponsor and Ayngaran International.[88] The film was supposed to be released on the Tamil New Year's day, 14 April 2007,[17][89] but due to post-production delays, the film was released worldwide on 15 June 2007.[90][91] On 15 July 2007, AVM Productions, the producers of the film, announced their decision to dub the film into Hindi.[92][93] That version was released on 14 January 2010.[91]\n\nM. Satyamoorthy, on 9 July 2007, sought to stop the film being screened, claiming that it defamed the Indian National Congress, a political party, as well as its president, Sonia Gandhi, and the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh. Satyamoorthy cited a scene in which portraits of Gandhi and Singh are visible behind Adiseshan's chair, implying that Adiseshan was a member of the Indian National Congress.[94] Satyamoorthy also claimed ₹500 million (US$7.0 million) in damages from the film's producer, director and lead actor to be paid to the Tamil Nadu section of the party.[95] Jaya Rajadevan, one of the film's assistant directors, sought an injunction in civil court to stop screening of the film for alleged plagiarism. Rajadevan claimed that he had written the film's story and had discussed it with Shankar's manager in 2005.[96] Although the court sent notices to Shankar, among others, the screening of the film was not stopped.[97]\n\nSpecial screenings[edit][]\n\nRajinikanth used his political affiliations to screen the film for several politicians. He went to Hyderabad to showcase the film for the former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Chandrababu Naidu, on 14 June 2007.[98] At the screening, Rajinikanth told the media that he would invite the Chief Minister, Rajasekhara Reddy, for a special viewing as well. Rajinikanth said that he had screened the film to current and former Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers, Dr. Karunanidhi[99] and Jayalalitha,[100] respectively, and that India's Finance Minister, P Chidambaram, was also keen to watch the film.[99] A private screening was also shown to Amitabh Bachchan.[101]\n\n3D re-release[edit][]"
