Arguably the preeminent leading man during the \"Golden Age\" of Tamil cinema, Ganesan was the first Indian film actor to win a \"Best Actor\" award at an international film festival, the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in Cairo, Egypt in 1960. He was also the first Indian actor to be made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He won the President's Award for more than 12 times, and was later conferred the highest and the most prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his contribution to Indian cinema in 1997. An iconic figure in Tamil pop culture, his work has continued to enjoy an enduring, far-reaching influence in Tamil society in general.",
