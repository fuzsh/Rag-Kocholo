        "meta_description": "Karunanidhi popularly known as Kalaignar breathed his last today, August 8th. It is a sad day for the state of Tamil Nadu. A leader who holds an important position in the history of Indian politics is no more. He has served as the chief minister of the state of Tamil Nadu for five separate terms in the 1969–2011 period.  Karunanidhi is a well-known screenwriter too. His contribution in the field of Tamil literature, plays and novels are immense. These are all known details of Kalaignar, but here we have compiled a few lesser-known facts about him for you.",
