        "text": "Sivaji Ganesan's best work with Rajini, Kamal Vijay films&nbsp | &nbspPhoto Credit:&nbspTwitter\n\nLegendary Tamil actor, Villupuram Chinnaiah Ganesan was born on october 1, 1928, popularly known as Sivaji Ganesan. He made his debut in Tamil cinema in 1952 with the film Parasakthi. He appeared in over 300 films in his cinematic career of nearly five decades in several languages including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi.\n\nGanesan won many hearts with his brilliant acting skills and had given uncountable hits throughout his career. He is fondly called 'Nadigar Thilagam' by everyone. In 1997, he was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in the field of cinema.\n\nOn the occasion of his 93rd birth anniversary, let us take a look at Legendary actor's best performances of Rajinikanth, Kamal Hassan and Vijay films.\n\nPadikkadavan\n\nSivaji played the role of superstar Rajinikanth's elder brother in the 1985 film Padikkadavan, which was directed by Rajasekhar. The story is about a man who strives hard to make his younger brother study. Ganesan's onscreen brotherhood with Rajini worked well, and they looked like real brothers on the big screen. The film was a blockbuster and had a run for more than 250 days in theatres.\n\nThevar Magan\n\nThevar Magan was one of Kamalâ€™s most popular films. Late legendary actor, Sivaji, played his father in the movie with Revathi and Gautami playing his love interests in the film. Sivaji's on-point dialogues as an old village man are still shared actively by fans on social media. The film was also made in Bollywood with Anil Kapoor, Tabu and Pooja Batra called Virasat.\n\nOnce More\n\nThalapathy Vijay also shared screen space with veteran actor Sivaji in the film Once More. Sivaji Ganesan played the role of Vijay's father in the film. The family entertainer was directed by S.A. Chandrashekhar. The ensemble cast included Saroja Devi, Manivannan, Charle and Simran. The film had a decent run at the box office. It was regarded as one of the landmark films in Vijay's career.\n\nPadayappa\n\nAfter playing the role of an elder brother, Ganesan later played Rajini's father in the action thriller Padayappa. Unfortunately, this was the veteran actor's second last film. Directed by K. S. Ravikumar, the film also features Ramya Krishnan and Soundarya as female lead roles. The film had a theatrical run of 100 days in 86 theatre centres, and was dubbed into Telugu under the title Narasimha."
