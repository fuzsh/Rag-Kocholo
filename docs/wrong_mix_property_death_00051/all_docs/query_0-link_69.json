His memorial is to be opened on Sunday which is also his 89th birth anniversary.\n\nThe memorial which is centred on a large statue, is located in Adyar, a fancy neighbourhood in Chennai.\n\nThe memorial was commissioned by J Jayalalithaa, actor-turned-politician, who died in December while she was Chief Minister. Her party's E Palaniswami or \"EPS\", who now heads the government, has assigned two ministers to throw open the memorial to the public.\n\n\"The scheduled small function by a minister will disrespect a legend,\" said Sivaji Ganesan's son, Prabhu, who is an actor, in a letter to the Information Minister. \"This is Jayalalithaa's dream project. She would have inaugurated if she were alive,\" he claimed.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nA statue of Sivaji Ganesan, built when the opposition DMK was in power, was removed in August from a main road leading upto the city's famous Marina Beach after the High Court said it was a traffic hazard and blocks the view of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIt is this statue that will be placed in the new memorial and sources say its provenance and links to the DMK may have spurred EPS to keep his distance from Sunday's ceremony.\n\n."
