        "text": "Screenplays in Indian cinema are now increasingly becoming complicated when compared to earlier films. Technological advancement has aided this. But a simple flashback sequence has always been - and still remains - Indian cinema's favourite.\n\nWhat if we tell you that Andha Naal, released in 1954, was the first film in Tamil to incorporate a flashback sequence in its screenplay? The critically acclaimed film is also said to be one of the first crime dramas in Kollywood.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDirected by renowned musician Veena Sundaram Balachander, Andha Naal had Sivaji Ganesan and Pandari Bai playing the lead roles.\n\nAround the 1950s, every filmmaker followed a similar screenwriting pattern with usual commercial ingredients. But it was Sundaram Balachander who broke the regular formula with this one. It was the time when songs were considered to be the most integral part of the story, but interestingly Andha Naal was one film that didn't have songs, dances or fight sequences in it.\n\nThe film's plot is set on the night of October 11, 1943, when the Japanese bomb Chennai. The next morning, in Triplicane, Rajan, a radio and communication engineer, is found dead with his handgun. One of the neighbours lodges a complaint with the nearby police station about having heard the sound of a gunshot. Police arrive at Rajan's house to solve the mystery. The story unfolds from that point.\n\nWhen the film released, people actually did not understand what was happening on screen. In the very first scene, Sivaji is shot dead and the flashback ensues. It was something new for the audience. People thought that the makers had pulled in-crowd, projecting the film as 'Sivaji Ganesan's film' and they had been cheated as the actor dies in the very first scene.\n\nWithout realising that there was a flashback sequence to follow, the crowd rushed out of the theatres. Initially, the film didn't do well as people were not used to such screenplays. The makers of the film re-released it after a week and it set the cash registers ringing at the box office.\n\nBonus Trivia:\n\nFrom the 1940s to 1960s Balachander directed many films which were trendsetters. In fact, several critics appreciated his bold attempts. Another one of Balachander's films, Avana Ivan, which was also based on solving a murder mystery, tried something different with its music. Balachander was both the composer and the director of the film too. The re-recording of the film was done with only one instrument - the piano. Unique, right?\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Sivaji Ganesanâ€™s Uthama Puthiran was the first Indian film to be shot using a zoom lens\n\nALSO SEE | Tuesday Trivia: Why Andaz Apna Apna director Rajkumar Santoshi tied Karisma and Raveena to a pole"
