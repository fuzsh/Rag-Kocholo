        "text": "1) Original Name : V.C.GANESAN (Villupuram C.Ganesan)\n\n2) Popular Name : SIVAJI GANESAN -- the title \"Sivaji\" was given to Ganesan by the great Rationlist,Thanthai Periyar E.V.R.Ramasamy for his best performance in the role of Sathrapathy Sivaji in the stage play \"Sivaji kanda Indu Saamraajyam\" in the year 1946.\n\n3) How Became An Actor: When he was 9 years old he ran away from his house. Nobody knew his whereabouts. After many days his mother and elder brother happened to trace him at a place near Trichirapalli where \"Kampalaththaan Kooththu\" a popular folk drama was taking place. Kattabomman's story was being enacted on stage in that Kooththu. Ganesan was very much interested in that particular drama. Even at that small age he had vowed that one day he would become an actor and do Kattabomman's role on stage.\n\nGanesan's mother brought him back to their house. She arranged through her elder son to get a placement for Ganesan in one of the popular drama troupes. Thus Ganesan first became a stage actor.\n\n4) First film : His first film is \"Paraasakthi\". It was released in the year 1952.\n\n5) Great Turning Point: \"Parasakthi\" was a great turning point not only in Sivaji Ganesan's acting Career but also for the entire Tamil Cinema Field. Before that there were mainly either Raja Rani Stories or religious and mythological stories with a number of songs which had great sway among Tamil Cinema audience. But \"Paraasakthi\" was a social film with revolutionery themes and lesser number of songs. More over the heart - catching, fiery dialogue by Kalaingar Karunanidhi made the film a super revolutionery one in terms of it's trend- setting nature and it's overall reformative impact on society.\n\n6) Milestones : The Greatest Merit of Sivaji Ganesan is that no other actor either in Tamil Cinema or Indian Film Industry or in the whole\n\nWorld has done such a great number of roles and acted in such a great varieties of roles depicting real life- like characters on screen and no other actor's acting carreer is so much saturated with such a great number of milestones in terms of unimaginable achievements as in that of sivaji Ganesan.\n\n7)Meritorious Awards:\n\n1) The Best Actor Award won in Afro- Asian Film Festival held in Gairo, Egypt in 1960.\n\n2) Padmasri Title - 1966.\n\n5) Padmabhushan Title - 1984\n\n4) Chevalier Award of France 1995.\n\n5) Dadha Saahib Paalkhe Award 1997.\n\n8)Meritorious Qualities :\n\n1) Modesty.\n\n2) Punctuality.\n\n3) Make-up Aptness and Physical Fitness that suit with 100% exactness any sort of role from Prince to Beggar and the Rugged Character to the Cultured Elite!\n\n4) Infinite Veriety In Acting And Dialogue -Delivery - An Unreachable Feat by any other World Level Actor.\n\n9)Unique Achievment: The No 1 ranked Actor the World has ever seen.\n\n10) Ambition: Wants to act until the last breath of life and he would be even more happy, he once said, should his physical existence comes to an end while acting.\n\n11) Total Number Of Films: Around 300\n\n12) Mother Tongue: Tamil\n\n13) Native Place: Villupuram, a small town in South Arcot district, in Tamilnadu, India.\n\n14) Academic Education: III std, at the preliminary level of school education.\n\n15) Father's Name: P.Chinniah Mandraayer. Though poor was very rich in his sprit of patriotism! Was imprisoned many number of times for his continued support and participation in the then Indian Freedom Stuggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Jail become his second home.\n\n16) Mother's Name: Rajamani Ammal. While her husband was in prison she had to undergo all sorts of hardships to feed her children and maintain the family.Lack of food made them at times to forgo food.\n\n17) Marriage: Married Kamala, already a relative of him, who was a resident of Nagappattinam near Trichirappalli, Tamilnadu. This couple begot two male children later named Ramkumar and Prabhu, and two female ones Shanthi and Thenmozhi. Today all the four are married. Ramkumar looks after and manages Sivaji Films. Prabhu has become one of the busiest, leading heroes of Tamil Cinema.\n\n18) Political Affiliations: From his first film onwards he was considered to be a staunch D.M.K. party sympathiser. After 1955 some dramatic changes took place. He was a neutralist for some years.\n\nBut at the end of 1961 he become a strong supporter of Congress Party. In that year he took part and delivered an address in the state Congress party Conference in which the then Prime Minister Pandid Jawaharlal Nehru and Kamarajar were the main participants. In 1982 Mrs.Indira Gandhi made him the Rajya sabha M.P. After 1687 came out of Congress and floated his own Political Party. 2 years latter became President of Tamilnadu faction of Janata Dal. After a few years he quit politics.\n\n19) Honours Bestowed Upon Sivaji Ganesan: In 1962 Sivaji Ganesan toured America as its Special Guest. There, he was given one of the highest houours of being the Mayor of Niagara City for one day. After Prime Minister Nehru, Sivaji was the only Indian to get this honour.\n\nIn Hollywood he met world famous actors like Marlon Brando and some leading Cinema technicians.\n\nEgyptian President Naasar, Singapore former Prime Minister, Ceylon President Chandrika, Indian former Prime Ministers Nehru, Indra Gandhi, V.P. Singh, former President Dr. Radhakirishnan, former Governer -General Rajaji, former Chief Ministers Kamarajar and Annadurai, Present Chief Minister Kalaignar Karunanidhi, Ex-Chief Ministers M.G.R., RamaRao and Jayalalitha were not only his associates but his very great admirers too!\n\nWhat \"Pillaiyaar Chuzhi\" is for Letters (Yezhuththu), Sivaji Ganesan is for acting. Without touching him or starting with him the dictionary of acting won't get completed. Actor Raj Kapoor has earned for himself respect and recognition in world countries. Like that among our South Indian actors Sivaji Ganesan has done us proud by his world level popularity. Wherever Tamils live there the name of Sivaji Ganesan has become the household word for them.\n\nIt is an 100% established fact that Sivaji has accomplished the rare feat or achievement of committing his entire life for the sake of the art of acting!\n\nAmong the world famous actors, each of them has an individuating, unique style and method of his own in acting. But we can see in the one single actor Sivaji, all these different styles and talents are put together that he is able to portray in his acting any such particular style in the most perfect manner possible. If we try to scan his acting abilities with the help of a computer, we would be greatly startled and astonished. Even Steven Spielberg who created the Dino through computer would remain helpless had he been entrusted with the assignment of scanning Sivaji's acting abilities in a computer. To explain and criticise Sivaji's acting ability one is expected to be endowed with special talents.\n\nMay be the number of films acted by Sivaji are more than 300. But the number of character roles and kinds of 'abhinayas' portrayed in those films by Sivaji are really countless and innumerable! It would make anyone wonder whether his physical features were especially created for the express purpose of acting! He has got such an unbelievable and beautiful type of cinematic facial shape and get-up that one could film his facial features in all the 360 degree angles with equal beauty, charm and captivating enchantment. His eyes - if we look at them at close range,would seem as if prominently standing out and flashing forth brightness. His voice - would be roaring like lion! At the same time it (his voice) is also capable of bringing out the breezy softness of feminine nicety, whenever it is required.\n\nFrom his boyhood to his youth he has put on different feminine get-ups and attires and has acted in the vastly different roles of national and world famous women characters! He has acted in the character role of Noor Jahaan as well as that of Mumtaj. The filmi characters of the popular film \"Manohara\" like the hero Manoharan, his mother Pathmavathi, father Purushoththaman, Vasantha Senai, her son 'asadan' Vasanthan---all these different character roles have been acted in perfect manner on different occasions by the single actor Sivaji in \"Manohara\" stage drama!\n\nThe quality of acting that Sivaji had shown in his performance in the feminine role of Padmavathi in \"Manaohara\" drama has not been matched even by such a great and fine actress like Kannamba who did that role in the film \"Manohara\", some critics say!. That's the unique feat of Sivaji. That feminine nicety that marked it's stamp in his acting in dramas didn't part ways with Sivaji later during his cinematic career too. Whenever he acted in such soft character roles in cinema, those past, stage experiences of having acted in feminine roles helped him a lot. In the film \"Theiva Mahan\", the second son Vijayan's style of walking, his mannerisms, abhinayas etc. are an example for this. Those characters of Puranas and epics as were depicted in books in the form of writing, that of photos and paintings were all shown before our very eyes when Sivaji acted in such roles in films which remains one of his great achievements. Apart from these he has accomplished yet another great feat by way of registering in the minds of the audiences with the never-dying memories of such unforgettable, popular character roles like the following : Gunasekaran in \"Parasakthi\", Muththaiyan in \"Kalvanin Kaathali\", Sengoden in \"Makkalai Petra Maharaasi\", Parthiban and Vikraman (double roles) in \"Uththama Puththiran\", Rengan in \"Padikkaatha Methai\" Kannaiyan in \" \"Bhagappirivinai\", Raja Sekar in \"Paasa Malar\", Sikkal Shanmuga Sundaram in \"Thillana Mohanambal\", Shankar, Kannan, Vijayan (triple roles) in \"Theiva Mahan\", Bharath in \"Sivantha Mann\", Prestige Padmaba Iyer in \"Vietnam Veedu\", Mookkaiya Servai in \"Pattikkaadaa Pattinamaa\", Barrister Rajni Kaanth in \"Gouravam\" etc., etc.\n\nWhen acting in extreme type of emotive scenes the eyes of Sivaji would seem reddish in colour. In colour films this would be seen in a crystal clear manner. That's not because of the application of any ointment. Whenever Sivaji acts emotionally or delivers dialogue ferociously or shows vigorous facial expressions, instantly his eyes would turn reddish automatically. When he comes back to normalcy his eyes would also turn to normal colour.\n\nWhen we talk about 'eyes', the different character roles Sivaji has done in Purana films come to our memory. There is a saying that our Gods always keep their eyes open. Neither they would wink their eyes nor sleep, it is said so. In the film \"Thiruvilaiyaadal\" Sivaji who has acted as Siva Peruman has in none of the scenes winked his eyes! For us even to take note of that point while seeing the film becomes a strenuous job.\n\nIf we join our friends in the playful game of trying to keep our eyes wide open for a long time, without doing any winking, then tears would naturally fill in our eyes with some irritating sensation. But putting on heavy costumes and ornaments on the body, speaking long dialogues in the midst of eye-blinding bright lights during film-shooting and at the same time keeping the eyes wide open without closing them even for a fraction of a second is not an easy job indeed! But Sivaji has managed it very easily. Not only that. While he was dancing in the 'Ruthra Thaandavaa' scene in the film he didn't at all wink his eyes. Now one could understand how great a trouble and pain Sivaji might have taken for doing that role with that much perfection and grammar!\n\nAs said above, in cinema, Sivaji has accomplished so many number of great feats. One of them is that he has, more than any other actor, acted in countless number of close-up shots in multi-different scenes. He has given infinite variety of expressions during such close-up shots. To shoot such remarkable close-ups of Sivaji it is a pre-requsite that the cameraman also has special abilities and creative tastes!\n\nTo-day there has been so many novel, technical advancements that the modern negative film has got special qualities that bright lighting during shooting won't hurt either the artists' eyes or body, nowadays. 25 years back such advancements were not there. There was only one type of film then. That needed too much lighting for shooting. Without make-up one can not withstand the effects of such lighting.\n\nIf such was the condition inside the studio sets in those days, the situation at out-door shooting locations would be much more horrible. In the broad day-light and at the peak hours of the burning sun one had to face the most unbearable heat-waves! The reflectors used for shooting on such hot days made the worse things worst! It was under such grim and hard conditions that Sivaji had to do most of his films during his peak days in cinema!\n\nThe 'Pillaiyar Chuzhi' for Sivaji's acting was drawn by a 'theru kooththu' drama (folk drama) titled \"Veera Pandia Kattabomman\". Only on seeing that he developed a craze for acting and joined 'Boys Company', a popular drama troupe! Even after his entry into cinema and even while his popularity was going on growing day by day, he didn't forget 'Kattabomman'. Through his 'Sivaji Nadaka Mandram' he enacted that drama on stage for 100 times! Even many more times it could have been enacted had not his throat got hurt and started bleeding because of his ferocious dialogue delivery. While he was acting in the climax scene he delivered emotional dialogue against Banerman, he bleeded and fell unconscious! All were shocked. It was that film enacted by him taking that much serious risks that fetched him the \"Best Actor Award\" at the Afro-Asian Cinema Festival at Cairo, Egypt in the year 1960! He was the first Indian actor to get such a Foreign Award.\n\nIn \"Neethi\" film excepting a single song scene he was wearing pant and shirt in the same colour throughout the film. He didn't bother about his image and all. Like that in the matter of continuity in costumes also his memory power is remarkable! Having acted wearing a particular dress in a scene and during when the shooting resumes after a gap of a number of days, even when the costumer forgetds the continuity in costume matter Sivaji won't forget that and he would ask for the right dress to wear.\n\nBy the help of the mere photographs (stills) one could clearly find out and name the different films of Sivaji. He is that much careful to change his make-up and overall get-up from film to film! To-day many leading artists are reluctant to wear wigs. Even those with slight baldness near forehead, try to manage without wig by pulling up the hair from the back portion of their head towards the front-side! But Sivaji inspite of his having beautiful, curled, original hair in most of his films he has used wigs. He himself applies finishing touches to his moustache and eyebrows!\n\nFor the role of Appar in \"Thiruvarutchelvar\" he has spent three hours daily for his exclusive make-up. To wipe it out an hour. To act in that role he has considerably reduced the quantity of in-taking food in order to make his body a little more lean.\n\nIn \"Theiva Mahan\" Sivaji has acted in the dual roles of father and son with a face that looks as if charred by fire. Whenever removing that make-up after the day's shooting his face's original skin also got stripped out here and there. After the regrowth of skin again the same make-up and same pain-taking!"
