Asya Musayeva, a longtime resident of Greenwich, passed away on April 16 at the age of 96. She was born in 1926 in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the former USSR, to Matvei (Sheyl) and Alexandra (Shifra) Ptashko. Asya lived much of her life in Baku, apart from the time as a child that she spent at a diplomatic outpost in Esfahan, Iran, and in the Far North in Norilsk, the world’s most northern city.

Asya attended a teachers college in Baku and worked as a physical education teacher, most recently at a locally renowned school No.160 in Baku, until she immigrated to Greenwich in 1992. She loved her job, was loved and respected by her colleagues and students, and was recognized by the government as one of the republic’s top educators. When Asya was young, she represented Azerbaijan in gymnastics and fencing competitions.

Asya remained at the heart of her large family her entire life. She lost Iosif, the love of her life for 60 years, 13 years ago, and her brother, Victor, 10 years ago. Asya is survived by her children – Eugenia and Mark, grandchildren – Sasha, Lala, Lina, and Gabi, and great-grandchildren – Tessa, Zoe, Aria, Liev and Ayla, as well as many relatives, friends and her former students now living around the world on whom she left her mark, and who remember and love her very much. She will always be remembered for her extraordinary character, wisdom, and kindness.
