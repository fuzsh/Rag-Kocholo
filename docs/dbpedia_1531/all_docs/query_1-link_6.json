He carries out research into people’s relationships to place and place-­ making processes after conflict, disasters, and migration. Intersecting this area of research is his research and writing on social memory: popular memory, contested and marginalized remembering and forgetting, traumatic memory, and performative enactments of commemorations and remembrances . He has written widely on the Bosnian diaspora, including his award-­winning book, Places of Pain: Forced Displacement, Popular Memory and Trans-­ Local Identities in Bosnian War-­ Torn Communities (2013). Asya Hekimoğlu received her BA from McGill University, Canada, before continuing her studies with a master’s degree in International Heritage and Law at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. Her thesis looks at definitions of heritage through the lens of the Bosnian diaspora.

Contributors xii Dino Kadich is a PhD candidate in Geography at the University of Cambridge, England. His doctoral research, rooted in feminist political geography , examines the emergence of “politics without a future” as a response to mass emigration and interminable gridlock in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a particular focus on youth. His publications and research interests explore art-­ academic collaborations, creative methods, and the politics of the digital world. Kadich is a diaspora Bosnian, born in Italy, raised in Arizona, and now perpetually on the run from the normative forms of belonging never quite available to him.
