        "text": "I am a professional online Russian, Hebrew and English teacher. I am 28 years old. I was born in Russia and in 1999 I have immigrated to Israel. In 2013 I have graduated from Tel Aviv University, where my major was English Literature and French Culture. I have been teaching languages for 8 years already to both children and adults of all ages and levels: beginners, intermediate and advanced. I believe that learning new languages involves more than just learning grammar rules. As I see it, learning new languages also involves learning about new cultures, traditions, literature, history, music and even cuisine. I always try my best to stucture our lessons in a creative way, so you could both learn new things and enjoy. I have a wide range of interests such as sports, literature and music. I also like traveling and meeting new people. In addition, I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology, which helps my in teaching as well. My lessons are typically based on your demands and requirements. So, the first lesson will include planning out a course and discussing what you want to get out of English classes:\n\n* We can have a simple conversation on a specific topic you are interested in.\n\nOR\n\n* We can have structured lessons which will include learning grammar and practicing your writing skills.\n\nI am especially good at working with teenagers and children. :) In any case, I am really looking forward to meeting you soon!\n\nI have a flexible schedule which makes me available during the morning and the evening hours of the day both on weekdays and weekends.\n\nRead More"
