        "text": "ABC's Claim to Fame closed out season 2 with a two-part finale on Monday. The celebrity relative guessing game — cohosted by Franklin Jonas and his own famous relative, brother Kevin Jonas — was jam-packed with all-star reveals, including the likes of Tom Hanks' niece (who had one hell of a meltdown on the premiere episode), Eddie Murphy's daughter, and former President Jimmy Carter's grandson.\n\nThroughout the reality competition, each player's famed family member was kept under wraps from housemates and viewers at home as hints were rolled out during weekly challenges. See below for the biggest clues we gathered all season for each contestant, our own predictions for their relatives, and who everyone's claim to fame turned out to be.\n\nGabriel\n\nBiggest clues: His brother won an NAACP Award and they look nothing alike. His relative was born in San Diego. Photo clues include a beanie hat with a spinner, drum sticks, and a red star logo. Says his brother was on Nickelodeon with Good Burger stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. His bottle clue is a man pushing a stroller, the number two, 10 baby emojis, '&,' a drum, and a star. His relative was a cast member on All That in the late '90s.\n\nStatus: Declared the winner on episode 10 on Aug. 28, 2023 after correctly guessing Monay.\n\nOur prediction: Devoting an hour to cross-checking every celebrity born in San Diego with NAACP winners? That's journalism, baby! And that led us to change our earlier wild guess of Wayne Brady to our final prediction that Gabriel's non-look-alike brother is actually prolific TV host and father Nick Cannon. All the clues since have supported this.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Nick Cannon is Gabriel's older brother.\n\nMonay\n\nBiggest clues: Says her father is an athlete with an Emmy, but one of these is a lie. Photo clues include a fedora, pink padlock on a chain necklace, and a cloud with a lightning bolt. Her bottle clue contains symbols for Saturday, night, satellite, &, curb, your, happy person, happy mask. Clues from the paper shredder dossier: born in 1965 in Plymouth; N.C., 6'2; associates: Larry [redacted], Kevin [redacted], Sia; last known whereabouts: Spotted renting a [redacted] at Blockbuster; won Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama; is face of [redacted] sportsbook commercials; starred in [redacted] of Hollywood. Her relative was in Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nStatus: Monay eliminated episode 10 on Aug. 28, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Gabriel for the win.\n\nOur prediction: Several contestants have made cases for clues pointing to Monay being Steve Harvey's daughter, including Carly on episode 1, which is actually a reason we are skeptical. Okay, that and looking through photos of Harvey's family members and not seeing anyone who looks like Monay. But there's another Emmy winner with a penchant for wearing hats who we thought of next, Curb Your Enthusiasm star J.B. Smoove, and, well, the proof is out there.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: J.B. Smoove is Monay's dad. (But her name is actually Jerrica!)\n\nChris\n\nBiggest clues: His relative is a singer, who he looks and sings like, and has a star on the Walk of Fame. Says his relative was big in the '70s. His bottle clue contains symbols for a puppy, heart/love, T-shirt, letter N, eye, doll, in, seven tees. Not related to Elvis or Elton John. Clues from the paper shredder dossier: born in 1957 in Ogden Utah; 5'9; associates: Andy Williams, Andrew Lloyd [redacted]; 11-year [redacted] residency wearing amazing colored dream coat, singing [redacted]. His relative won Dancing With the Stars season 9.\n\nStatus: Chris was eliminated episode 10 on Aug. 28, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Monay.\n\nOur prediction: Episode 2's clues changed everything. We're switching our first guess of John Mayer, to a bet-it-all prediction that Chris is related to \"Puppy Love\" singer and '70s teen idol Donny Osmond. Now, we're more curious if the youngsters in the house will be able to put this together.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Donny Osmond is Chris' dad (as all of our moms already knew).\n\nKarsyn\n\nBiggest clues: She says she's related to a male musician, but we don't yet know if part of this is a lie. Her bottle clue contains symbols for a trophy, eraser, minus, E, coin/penny, two record players, 4, and a mug. Not related to Jeff Gordan. Clues from the paper shredder dossier: born in 1974 in Kannapolis, N.C.; 5'10; associates: Danica [redacted], [redacted] Zuckerberg, Jay-Z; 2-time [redacted] winner, won the most popular [redacted] award 15 consecutive times, won Daytona [redacted] in 2004. Her relative was on Danica Patrick's podcast and spoke about his late father.\n\nStatus: Karsyn was eliminated episode 9 on Aug. 28, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Gabriel.\n\nOur prediction: The bottle clue seems to point to a trophy-winning racer who holds two records for… drinking a mug of beer? We might have watched Ford vs. Ferrari five times in the theater, but knowing race car driver stats is not our forte. But this season has featured pretty big stars, so we bet it's at least someone famous enough to name, which leaves our top picks as Dale Earnhardt or Mario Andretti. Karsyn does not seem like a very Italian name so…\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Dale Earnhardt, Jr. is Karsyn's uncle\n\nJ.R.\n\nBiggest clues: He has a famous brother who is not in the NBA. His relative was born in Lithia Springs, Ga. Photo clues include a chef's hat and a pacifier. His bottle clue is symbols for BIU (bold, italics, underline), artist, face, point, old, houses/town, road. Clues from the paper shredder dossier: born in 1999; 6'1; associates: [redacted] Harlow, Billy [redacted], BTS; first LGBT [redacted] to win a country [redacted] award; featured on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list; [redacted] was No. 1 on [redacted] longer than any other [redacted] in history. His relative ran a Nicki Minaj fan page.\n\nStatus: J.R. was eliminated episode 8 on Aug. 14, 2023 after incorrectly guessing Chris' relative as Billy Idol.\n\nOur prediction: The list of celebs from Lithia Springs is incredibly short, and of those only one is listed as actually being born in the city: Lil Nas X. The new clues also support this.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Lil Nas X is J.R.'s lil brother.\n\nHugo\n\nBiggest clues: His grandfather won a Nobel Prize and was at one point in time \"the most powerful man in world.\"\n\nStatus: Hugo was eliminated episode 7 on Aug. 7, 2023 after incorrectly guessing Chris' relative as Elton John.\n\nOur prediction: We're certain he's related to former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Jimmy Carter is Hugo's grandfather.\n\nOlivia\n\nBiggest clues: Says she is related to a Razzie winner, which we don't yet know is true. Photo clues include an alien headband, glittery glasses, and a red plus sign medical symbol.\n\nStatus: Olivia was eliminated episode 6 on July 31, 2023 after incorrectly guessing Karsyn's relative as Jeff Gordon.\n\nOur prediction: The newest clues are giving us Robin Williams vibes, but he is not a Razzie winner so we're still a little in the dark on this one and sticking with our very wild guess of Pauley Shore or Tom Green for now.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Jenny McCarthy is Olivia's aunt.\n\nCole\n\nBiggest clues: All we got from him during the Two Truths and a Lie icebreaker is that his famous relative is his father, which we can't be sure is a truth or lie. He thinks a statue of Swiss cheese is his clue.\n\nStatus: Cole was eliminated episode 5 on July 24, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Karsyn.\n\nOur prediction: We never got a solid clue to crack this one.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Alicia Keys is Cole's sister.\n\nShayne\n\nBiggest clues: She says her father is a musician who has won a Grammy, but we know one of these is a fib. Her bottle clue contains symbols for a crown, coin, traveling, the U.S., as well as a deer with antlers and wheat. We also know the relative was born in 1961.\n\nStatus: Shayne was eliminated episode 4 on July 17, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Cole.\n\nOur prediction: Otay! Based on that bottle clue, we are sure she is related to SNL's Buckwheat and the star of Coming to America, Eddie Murphy, who was born in 1961 and has a Grammy for a comedy album. (Funny enough, Murphy also received a Razzie, as did the Jonas Bros.)\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Eddie Murphy is Shayne's dad.\n\nJane\n\nBiggest clues: Two of these things are true and one is a lie: Her famous father is a musician who won a Grammy. Her relative was born in 1946. Photo clues include an orchid, a blue collar, and a parrot.\n\nStatus: Jane was eliminated episode 3 on July 10, 2023 after incorrectly guessing Chris' relative as Elvis.\n\nOur prediction: Jane came to play and she has us kind of stumped. The only concrete clue we have is her relative's birth year. There is an incredible list of big stars born that year, including the likes of Cher, Dolly Parton, Liza Minnelli, Steven Spielberg, Sylvester Stallone, Sally Field, Diane Keaton, Cheech Marin, David Lynch, Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, Tommy Lee Jones, and Andre the Giant. None of the men on the list have a daughter named Jane so we're betting \"father\" was the lie in her icebreaker clue and the relative could be more distant than a parent. Olivia may have been wrong to so easily dismiss Hugo saying all the wigs on the clue wall pointed to Jane being related to a rockstar. Could southern-twanged Jane be related to famous wig-enthusiast Dolly Parton, who has 10 Grammys and 11 siblings? We're ready to lose our minds seeing Aunt Dolly pop up on this show.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Dolly Parton really is Jane's aunt! (Also her name is actually Jada Star and she was named by Aunt Dolly.)\n\nTravis\n\nBiggest clues: He tells the group his father is an actor who has won a Critics Choice Award, but we know one of the latter two is a lie. He worries that reciting the first 100 digits of pi puts him \"in the nerd category,\" which he says is a risk based on who his father is.\n\nStatus: Travis was eliminated episode 2 on July 3, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Gabriel.\n\nOur prediction: Our calculations tell us he's related to celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Neil deGrasse Tyson is Travis' dad.\n\nCarly\n\nBiggest clues: Her uncle is an Oscar winner and \"one of the biggest actors in Hollywood ever since the '80s.\"\n\nStatus: Carly was eliminated episode 1 on June 26, 2023 after being correctly guessed by Hugo.\n\nOur prediction: N/A (But we swear we called this one before the reveal.)\n\nCelebrity relative revealed: Tom Hanks is Carly's uncle.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:"
