        "text": "All the benefits of virtual school, but with the bonuses of a statewide, campus-based system. Our Distance Learning students are supported by the work and knowledge of our full faculty from counseling to curriculum to tech. High school students can participate in our amazing Career-Based Learning program. And you are welcomed to social events and campus clubs, too, like Sophia pictured here, who is the president of Waipahu’s Pacific & Asian Affairs Council club.\n\nAll HTA schedules allow more time, but there’s an extra measure of this in Distance Learning. Our families enjoy having more time to spend together. And students have more time to explore interests outside the classroom. We have Distance Learning students who are full on into chess, robotics, riflery, body boarding, and more. You can find Distance Learning schedules in our video and guidebook.\n\nWe work hard to build a sense of community for our virtual families. Our quarterly community days are all about having fun together. These events are held on O‘ahu, Kaua‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i Island. We take on design challenges and enjoy outdoor activities and games. These get-togethers forge bonds that really carry over into our online classes.\n\nI am an educator because of the positive impact I can make in the lives of our students. It is important for me to create and nurture an inclusive learning environment and to inspire our youth to create a better future for our community. I am Kāne‘ohe born and bred. After completing my bachelor’s in fine arts in painting and drawing at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I returned home to earn my master’s of education in teaching at UH-Mānoa. I have taught kindergarten through Grade 12 and have been with HTA since 2017. I am an artist, I dance hula, and I’ve participated in several large choral performances. To me, there is nothing better than traveling and being outside in nature."
