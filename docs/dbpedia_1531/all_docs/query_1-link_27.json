        "text": "Behind every innovative program is a leader with a vision. Christina Fletcher, the first Director of the Department of Defense STARBASE at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, has big dreams for the program.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Fletcher possesses a diverse educational background with a focus on science, technology, engineering and math and special education. With over 20 years of experience in the educational field, Fletcher has taught every grade from kindergarten to 8th grade. Not only has Fletcher fulfilled a role as a teacher within the STEM world, she has held various positions to include the Director of Curriculum and Instruction and most recently as an Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction.\n\nFletcher’s vision for the Joint Base MDL DOD STARBASE is to open doors for youth in order to show them a world of possibilities outside of what they see on a day-to-day basis.\n\n“We’re at a time in education where there is so much to do and so much more we need to be doing. My passion has always been in uplifting students and ensuring that students receive the opportunities that they wouldn’t normally have,” Fletcher said. “While I was doing some college visits with my son, I thought about the opportunities that he’s had and the jobs that he’s been exploring and it was because he was exposed to those jobs. But what about the students who don’t have those opportunities to explore those jobs or to even understand that these fields exist? That’s what really drove me to this position, the opportunity to expose students.”\n\nThe DOD STARBASE Program presents fifth grade students with opportunities that they wouldn’t necessarily have within their current environment. The target audience for this effort being underserved youth from under-privileged backgrounds. Fletcher defines success for the program as touching as many students as possible.\n\n“I’m really excited to be here, I’m excited for this opportunity to direct the STARBASE, and I’m excited to get going,” Fletcher said. “I’m definitely the type of person that likes to get things done and we are so close! I will do everything in my ability to ensure the STARBASE is successful.”\n\nThe Joint Base MDL DOD STARBASE will open its doors for the first class of students on May 5."
