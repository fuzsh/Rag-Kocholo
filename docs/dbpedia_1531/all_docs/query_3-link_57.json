        "text": "What separates Generation Y from X? And hey Gen Z and Gen A, welcome to the party! What’s the cutoff? How old is each generation? Are they really that different?\n\nIt’s easy to see why there is so much confusion about generational cohorts.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt muddled by this \"alphabet soup\" of names — you’re not alone. The real frustration hits when you realize that Millennial consumers represent the highest-spending generation in 2020 — with a projected $1.4 trillion tab.\n\nAnd though their current wealth has been dragged down by not one but two “once-in-a-lifetime” economic crises during their most impactful career years, Millennials stand to inherit over $68 trillion from Baby Boomer and early Gen X parents by the year 2030, setting them up to potentially be the most wealthy generation in U.S. history.\n\nGeneration Z isn’t far behind, projected to hit $33 trillion in income by 2030 — that’s more than a quarter of all global income — and pass Millennials in spending power the year after. 3\n\nAnd coming up last but not least is Generation Alpha, the name given by social analyst Mark McCrindle to the youngest children on the planet. By the year 2025 there will be nearly 2 billion members of Generation Alpha across the globe.\n\nNo matter how you slice the data, the younger generations have never been more critical to your financial institution’s future.\n\nUnless you understand who they are and what they want, you won’t capture a dollar of their money.\n\nPeople grow older. Birthdays stay the same.\n\nA common source of confusion when labeling generations is their age. Generational cohorts are defined (loosely) by birth year, not current age. The reason is simple — generations get older in groups. If you think of Millennials as college kids (18 - 22), then not only are you out of date — you’re thinking of a stage in life, not a generation. Millennials are now well out of college, and that life stage is dominated by Gen Z.\n\nAnother example, a member of Generation X who turned 18 in 1998 would now be over 40. In that time, he or she cares about vastly different issues and is receptive to a new set of marketing messages. Regardless of your age, you will always belong to the generation you were born into.\n\nThe breakdown by age looks like this:\n\nBaby Boomers: Baby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. They're currently between 57-75 years old (71.6 million in the U.S.)\n\nGen X: Gen X was born between 1965 and 1979/80 and is currently between 41-56 years old (65.2 million people in the U.S.)\n\nGen Y: Gen Y, or Millennials, were born between 1981 and 1994/6. They are currently between 25 and 40 years old (72.1 million in the U.S.)\n\nGen Y.1 = 25-29 years old (around 31 million people in the U.S.)\n\nGen Y.2 = 29-39 (around 42 million people in the U.S.)\n\nGen Z: Gen Z is the newest generation, born between 1997 and 2012. They are currently between 9 and 24 years old (nearly 68 million in the U.S.)\n\nGen A: Generation Alphastarts with children born in 2012 and will continue at least through 2025, maybe later (approximately 48 million people in the U.S.)\n\nThe term “Millennial” has become the popular way to reference both segments of Gen Y (more on Y.1 and Y.2 below).\n\nSometimes labeled with the moniker “Zillennials”, those wedged at the tail end of Millennials and the start of Gen Z are sometimes labeled with this moniker — a group made up of people born between 1994 and the year 2000.\n\nOriginally, the name Generation Z was a placeholder for the youngest people on the planet — although Generation A has now taken over that distinction. However, in the same way that Gen Y morphed into Millennials, there is certainly a possibility that both Gen Z and Gen A may adopt new names as they leave adolescence and mature into their adult identities. While the label Gen A makes discussion easier, it may not be the last word on this group of humans.\n\nWhy are generations named after letters?\n\nIt started with Generation X, people born between 1965-1980. The preceding generation was the Baby Boomers, born 1946-1964. Post-World War II, Americans enjoyed newfound prosperity, which resulted in a \"baby boom.\" The children born as a result were dubbed the Baby Boomers.\n\nBut the generation that followed the Boomers didn’t have a blatant cultural identifier. In fact, that’s the anecdotal origin of the term Gen X — illustrating the undetermined characteristics they would come to be known by. Depending on whom you ask, it was either sociologists, a novelist, or Billy Idol who cemented this phrase in our vocabulary.\n\nFrom there on it was all down-alphabet. The generation following Gen X naturally became Gen Y, born 1981-1996 (give or take a few years on either end). The term “Millennial” is widely credited to Neil Howe, along with William Strauss. The pair coined the term in 1989 when the impending turn of the millennium began to feature heavily in the cultural consciousness.\n\nGeneration Z refers to babies born from the late 90s through today. A flurry of potential labels has also appeared, including Gen Tech, post-Millennials, iGeneration, Gen Y-Fi, and Zoomers.\n\nWhile some say Generation Alpha is named for the first letter of the Greek alphabet and denotes the first of a series of items or categories, Generation Alpha may also just be an easy way to round the corner into a new alphabet.\n\nSplitting up Gen Y\n\nJavelin Research noticed that not all Millennials are currently in the same stage of life. While all Millennials were born around the turn of the century, some of them are still in early adulthood, wrestling with new careers and settling down, while the older Millennials have a home and are building a family. You can imagine how having a child might change your interests and priorities, so for marketing purposes, it's useful to split this generation into Gen Y.1 and Gen Y.2.\n\nNot only are the two groups culturally different, but they’re in vastly different phases of their financial life. The younger group is just now flexing their buying power. The latter group has a more extensive history and may be refinancing their mortgage and raising children. The contrast in priorities and needs is stark.\n\nThe same logic can be applied to any generation that is in this stage of life or younger. As we get older, we tend to homogenize and face similar life issues. The younger we are, the more dramatic each stage of life is. Consider the difference between someone in elementary school and high school. While they might be the same generation, they have very different views and needs.\n\nMarketing to young generations as a single cohort will not be nearly as effective as segmenting your strategy and messaging.\n\nWhy are generation cohort names important?\n\nEach generation label serves as a shorthand to reference nearly 20 years of attitude, motivations, and historical events. Few individuals self-identify as Gen X, Millennial, or any other name.\n\nThey’re useful terms for marketers and tend to trickle down into common usage. Again, it’s important to emphasize that referring to a cohort only by the age range gets complicated quickly. Ten years from now, the priorities of Millennials will have changed — and marketing tactics must adjust instep. There are also other categories of cohorts you can use to better understand consumers going beyond age or generation.\n\nRemember, these arbitrary generational cutoff points are just that. They aren’t an exact science and are continually evolving.\n\nWhatever terminology or grouping you use, the goal is to reach people with marketing messages relevant to their phase of life. In short, no matter how many letters get added to the alphabet soup, the most important thing you can do is seek to understand the soup du jour for the type of consumer you want to attract.\n\nWhat makes each generation different?\n\nBefore we dive into each generation, remember that the exact years born are in dispute, because there are no comparably definitive thresholds by which the later generations (after Boomers) are defined. But this should give you a general range to help identify what generation you belong in.\n\nThe other fact to remember is that new technology is typically first adopted by the youngest generation and then is gradually adopted by the older generations. As an example, 96% of Americans have a smartphone, but Gen Z (the youngest generation) is the highest user.\n\nThe Baby Boomer Generation\n\nBoomer Birth Years: 1946 to 1964\n\nCurrent Age: 57 to 75\n\nGeneration Size: 71.6 million\n\nMedia Consumption: Baby boomers are the biggest consumers of traditional media like television, radio, magazines, and newspaper. Despite being so traditional, 90% of baby boomers have a Facebook account. This generation has begun to adopt more technology in order to stay in touch with family members and reconnect with old friends.\n\nBanking Habits: Boomers prefer to go into a branch to perform transactions. This generational cohort still prefers to use cash, especially for purchases under $5.\n\nShaping Events: Post-WWII optimism, the cold war, and the hippie movement.\n\nWhat's next on their financial horizon: This generation is experiencing the highest growth in student loan debt. While this might seem counterintuitive, it can be explained by the fact that this generation has the most wealth and is looking to help their children with their student debt. They have a belief that you should take care of your children enough to set them on the right course and don't plan on leaving any inheritance. With more Americans outliving their retirement fund, declining pensions, and social security in jeopardy, ensuring you can successfully fund retirement is a major concern for Boomers.\n\nGeneration X\n\nGen X Birth Years: 1965 to 1979/80\n\nCurrent Age: 41 to 56\n\nOther Nicknames: \"Latchkey\" generation, MTV generation\n\nGeneration Size: 65.2 million\n\nMedia Consumption: Gen X still reads newspapers, magazines, listens to the radio, and watches TV (about 165 hours' worth of TV a month). However, they are also digitally savvy and spend roughly 7 hours a week on Facebook (the highest of any generational cohort).\n\nBanking Habits: Since they are digitally savvy, Gen X will do some research and financial management online, but still prefer to do transactions in person. They believe banking is a person-to-person business and demonstrate brand loyalty.\n\nShaping Events: End of the cold war, the rise of personal computing, and feeling lost between the two huge generations.\n\nWhat's next on Gen X's financial horizon: Gen X is trying to raise a family, pay off student debt, and take care of aging parents. These demands put a high strain on their resources. The average Gen Xer carries $142,000 in debt, though most of this is in their mortgage. They are looking to reduce their debt while building a stable saving plan for the future.\n\nMillennials (Gen Y)\n\nMillennial Birth Years: 1981 to 1994/6\n\nCurrent Age: 25 to 40\n\nOther Nicknames: Gen Y, Gen Me, Gen We, Echo Boomers\n\nGeneration Size: 72.1 million\n\nMedia Consumption: 95% still watch TV, but Netflix edges out traditional cable as the preferred provider. Cord-cutting in favor of streaming services is the popular choice. This generation is extremely comfortable with mobile devices, but 32% will still use a computer for purchases. They typically have multiple social media accounts.\n\nBanking Habits: Millennials have less brand loyalty than previous generations. They prefer to shop products and features first, and have little patience for inefficient or poor service. Because of this, Millennials place their trust in brands with superior product history such as Apple and Google. They seek digital tools to help manage their debt and see their banks as transactional as opposed to relational.\n\nShaping Events: The Great Recession, the technological explosion of the internet and social media, and 9/11\n\nWhat's next on their financial horizon: Millennials are powering the workforce, but with huge amounts of student debt. This is delaying major purchases like weddings and homes. Because of this financial instability, Millennials choose access over ownership, which can be seen through their preference for on-demand services. They want partners that will help guide them to their big purchases.\n\nGen Z\n\nGen Z Birth Years: 1997 to 2012\n\nCurrently Aged: 9 to 24\n\nOther Nicknames: iGeneration, Post-millennials, Homeland Generation\n\nGeneration Size: 68 million\n\nMedia Consumption: The average Gen Zer received their first mobile phone at age 10.3 years. Many of them grew up playing with their parents' mobile phones or tablets. They have grown up in a hyper-connected world and the smartphone is their preferred method of communication. On average, they spend 3 hours a day on their mobile device.\n\nBanking Habits: This generation has seen the struggle of Millennials and has adopted a more fiscally conservative approach. They want to avoid debt and appreciate accounts or services that aid in that endeavor. Debit cards top their priority list, followed by mobile banking.\n\nShaping Events: Smartphones, social media, never knowing a country not at war, and seeing the financial struggles of their parents (Gen X).\n\nWhat's next on Gen Z's financial horizon: Learning about personal finance. They have a strong appetite for financial education and are opening savings accounts at younger ages than prior generations.\n\nIf you want to know more about Gen Z, check out this deep dive into their media consumption and banking habits.\n\nGeneration Alpha\n\nGeneration Alpha Birth Years: 2012 to 20256\n\nCurrently Aged: 0 to 9\n\nOther Nicknames: None that have stuck. Often the nickname centers on a defining event or characteristic.\n\nGeneration Size: 48 million and growing\n\nMedia Consumption: Alphas are being raised in homes with smart speakers and devices everywhere; technology is built into everyday items. Many of them attended school virtually thanks to the global pandemic and are gravitating toward online learning with programs such as Khan Academy, Prodigy, and IXL. Many have even had a digital presence since before they were born, with their Millennial parents creating social media handles for their infants.\n\nBanking Habits: Although some of the oldest Alphas may have accounts such as Greenlight, they do not have defining banking habits. They’re digital natives that will expect fully integrated, personalized consumer experiences. Based on current data, it appears that Alphas will be one of the most highly educated and wealthy generations. It is not clear if their banking habits will be influenced by their parents (i.e. “my parents bank here, so do I”) or by other factors.\n\nShaping Events: Global pandemic, social justice movement, Trump-era politics, and Brexit.\n\nWhat’s next on Generation Alpha’s financial horizon: As digital natives who view the world through a collection of screens, Alpha’s will be even more disconnected from the idea of cash. They will likely first encounter money as a number on a screen and spend it through apps and other forms of ecommerce.\n\nDo generations use technology differently?\n\nYounger generations have often led older Americans in their adoption and use of technology, and this largely holds true today.\n\nAlthough Baby Boomers may trail Gen X and Millennials on native technology usage, the rate at which Boomers expand their use of technology is accelerated.\n\nIn fact, Boomers are far more likely to own a smartphone than they were in 2011 (68% in 2019 vs. 25% then).\n\nAre generations the best way to categorize consumer behavior?\n\nKnowing generational trends is important, as they can unveil similar attitudes and behaviors among consumers who experienced world events at the same life stage as their cohorts. And it doesn’t hurt to understand these age groups since marketing tools and audience segmentations generally include age as a factor.\n\nBut the generations don’t tell the whole story and their behaviors can be hard to lock down. After all, every generation grows up. So. can you rely on age ranges alone? Here's what we think.\n\nDo generations bank differently?\n\nAbsolutely, and for several reasons.\n\nEach generation has been in the workforce for different lengths of time and accumulated varying degrees of wealth.\n\nBaby Boomers have an average net worth of $1,066,000 and a median net worth of $224,000.\n\nGen Xers average net worth is around $288,700, but the median is $59,800.\n\nMillennials have an average net worth around $76,200, but their median net worth is only $11,100.\n\nGen Z's average net worth is difficult to report on since so much of the generation has no net worth or career as of yet.\n\nEach generation is preparing and saving for different life stages; be that retirement, children's college tuition, or buying a first car.\n\nEach generation grew up in evolving technological worlds and has unique preferences in regard to managing financial relationships.\n\nEach generation grew up in different financial climates, which has informed their financial attitudes and opinions of institutions. However, in the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has become the great equalizer, as all generations have had to adapt to a new way of banking and living.\n\nHow are these banking differences appearing in the marketplace?\n\nEase of use vs. personal service.\n\nIf you think bots are taking over the world, you might be right. But for Millennial and Gen Z consumers, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, according to a recent Adobe Analytics study, 44% of Gen Z and 31% of Millennials have used a banking chatbot to answer their questions. And before you think that must be a terrible user experience, over half of both groups who actually used a chatbot said the experience was better than talking to a real person.\n\nHowever, for more complicated banking tasks, even the younger generations prefer the added assistance of a human representative.\n\nSecurity still comes first, always. But each generation has their own priorities.\n\nWhen choosing a new place to bank, “security” was the top-rated concern across Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers. “Reputation” (also known as your brand) finished second for both Gen Z and Millennial consumers.\n\nHowever, for Gen Z and Boomer consumers, branch locations was the second most popular result, with “reputation” close behind. Younger consumers still care about branch locations but weigh it around the same level as an institution’s digital and app services.\n\nFor Generation X, digital and app services were edged out by in-person support. For Baby Boomers, banking local was more important.4 However, before you write off the importance of your online and mobile banking for these consumers…\n\nTechnology isn’t just for younger generations anymore.\n\nThe trend has long been for each new generation to adopt digital and mobile banking services more readily. But the COVID-19 pandemic has turned on a new wave of late-adopters who now bank digitally, too.\n\nAccording to a recent Zelle survey, now 82% of seniors age 55+ are banking online more frequently — with 61% and 55% turning to social media and mobile banking more frequently too.5\n\nThat lines up closely with the start of the Baby Boomer demographic (currently ages 57 to 75). And while only time will tell how lasting this shift to digital tools and services will be, the more positive your digital experience, the more likely you are to extend your digital reach with this generation.\n\nToday, older generations are behaving more like younger generations. And if you want to succeed in tomorrow’s market, you already need to meet these younger generations where they are. Now is the time to extend your brand of great service beyond the branch.\n\n1 SOURCE: https://www.5wpr.com/new/research/5wpr-2020-consumer-culture-report/\n\n2 SOURCE: https://blog.coldwellbankerluxury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBGL-Millennial-Report_SEP19_FINAL-4a.1-1-1.pdf\n\n3 SOURCE: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gen-z-economic-impact-outlook-spending-permanently-change-investing-bofa-2020-11-1029822486\n\n4 SOURCE: https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/11/20/adobe-analytics-research-how-different-generations-bank.html#gs.pjzilf\n\n5 SOURCE: https://www.zellepay.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/Senior_Polling_FINAL.pdf"
