        "text": "Dianne Pappas (Class of 2012) opens exhibition at Boston Sculptors Gallery's Launchpad. In \"mini monuments\", Dianne Pappas will populate Launchpad’s intimate stage with constructed compositions of symbols, lines, tallies, maps, markings, and characters. Fiberfill, vitamin capsules, rubber mold, tarlatan, clay, wire, masking paper, resin, corrugated metal, hangers, reflective mylar, and bubble gum are comforting, regimented, bouncy, accepting, foundational, transparent, shiny, supportive, distorted, and tasty. What do we want our monuments to be? What do we need our monuments to do?\n\nPappas is a visual artist who creates objects and installations. Using utilitarian materials and often in combination with photographic processes, she creates experiences for her viewers that question play, vulnerability and the feminine. The underpinning of her studio practice is built through decoding systems, parsing language, and highlighting the dismissed and imperfect.\n\nDianne has exhibited her work in a variety of venues around the U.S. In addition to her studio practice at the Everett Mills in Lawrence, Dianne teaches Three Dimensional Foundations for the Art & Design department at NECC.\n\nPictured: installation view of \"threading the needle,\" 2024, wire, dyed fiberfill, paint, and porcelain on reflective mylar\n\nMFAST Faculty Nadia Hironaka's collaborative work titled Video Letter Exchange: Community Of Images (2024) will be screened in two upcoming events in Philadelphia and New York. Video Letter Exchange: Community Of Images (2024) pays homage to an earlier film, titled Video Letter (1983), which is an exchange of letters in the form of videos that took place between artists Shuji Terayama and Shuntaro Tanikawa. The film to be screened at this program was led by Nadia Hironaka, who organized a video letter exchange between US and Japan-based artists, Shinpei Takeda (San Diego), Hikaru Suzuki (Tokyo) and Yu Araki (Kyoto).\n\nScreenings at the Asia Art Archive In America in Brooklyn on August 1, and at Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia (new date TBD).\n\nAdditionally, a video installation titled Field Companion, 2021, will be on view at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, as a part of the Sketching Splendor exhibition on view through December 29.\n\nAnnouncing Aysha Akhtar's solo exhibition at the Transverse Gallery in Poughkeepsie, NY.\n\nAysha Akhtar is an artist, writer, activist, and neurologist. A Pakistani-American, she was born in London and now lives in Maryland with her husband and two felines. Aysha spent most of her childhood exploring nature and marveling at its shifting and transient wonders—at how certain trees wove together as though embracing one another, how the wind carried the whispers of the pine trees, how a trickle of water invited daydreams. It is in these times and places that she is closest to reaching a state of beauty. In her paintings, she strives to recapture that elusiveness of not just place, but also of time: specifically, the in-betweens of time and place. Her brushstrokes, loose and intuitive, mirror the spontaneity inherent in the natural world, allowing the paintings to emerge organically on the canvas.\n\nAn emerging artist, Aysha is an MFA candidate at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Her paintings have been exhibited in multiple group exhibitions, including the Circle Gallery, District Arts Gallery, and Silvermine Galleries. This is her second solo show.\n\nMFAST fourth-year Rachel Stein is one of ten artists featured in \"Awaken,\" a group exhibition at Towson University's Holtzman Gallery from June 18-July 26.\n\n\"Awaken\" explores the senses: how we perceive the world through sensation, and how our senses can be challenged. The senses are neurological phenomena, shaping our perception of self and our surroundings. The artists in this exhibition bridge the gap between personal sensation and the tangible world, transcending the conventional boundaries of consciousness and evoking feelings of nostalgia, playfulness, and wonder.\n\nAs a special event, Rachel Stein will be leading a hands-on zine making workshop inspired by the themes of the Awaken Exhibition on Wednesday, June 26th 5-8pm.\n\n\"Awaken\" On View June 18 – July 26\n\nClosing Reception July 26\n\nHoltzman MFA Gallery, Center for the Arts, Towson University, Towson, MD 21252,\n\nGallery Hours: Tuesday – Saturday 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. (closed June 19)\n\nKaren Middleton (MFAST 2027) will be exhibiting her quilting work and leading demonstrations at two Maryland events this summer! \"Quilts by the Bay,\" a two-day quilting showcase hosted by the Annapolis Quilt Guild will feature three of Karen's quilts as well as a wide variety of other displays at Severna Park Middle School, 450 Jumpers Hole Rd, Severna Park, MD 21146, on June 21-22. Karen will also be doing a quilting skills demo at noon on Saturday, June 22.\n\nAnother opportunity to see Karen's work will be at the Tuckahoe Steam & Gas Show at 11472 Ocean Gateway, Easton, MD 21601, where she will be demonstrating quilting techniques on Saturday and Sunday, July 13-14, along with many other artisans in metalwork, basketry, leatherwork, and pottery.\n\n(Pictured below: two of Karen Middleton's quilts featured in \"Quilts by the Bay\" exhibition).\n\nRecent MFAST graduate, Ashton Phillips recently opened a solo show at Tiger Strikes Asteroid Los Angeles. \"Ashton Phillips: Worm Hole - A Portal For Plastic Bodies,\" uses sound, text, chromatic light, and pyres of partially-metabolized polystyrene plastic, preserved in egg tempera, beeswax, and mealworm-fertilized mud, to transform the gallery space into a speculative portal for plastic bodies. At a time when trans and nonbinary people are being targeted by statehouses, neo-fascist Tiktok celebrities, and schoolhouse bullies, Worm Hole imagines a cosmic pathway to an alternative reality where the plasticity of material bodies, including their capacity to morph shape, transmute substance, and heal, is celebrated and revered.\n\nOn April 27th at 7pm, the artist will perform an activation to open up the Worm Hole, using touch, movement, and sound to connect and expand the materiality of the space and the plastic bodies within it.\n\nA closing reception will also be held on Saturday, May 25th with readings from the Phillips’ Trial by Pyre - a poetic, nonlinear research brief of facts assembled through the artists’ experimental and materially-driven practice, including meditations on plastic, metamorphosing mealworm/beetles, purple, (anti) transness, environmental justice, evolutionary biology, testosterone, and pump jacks.\n\nMFAST second year Asma Waheed was recently awarded a Graduate Student Fellowship through the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (NCECA). Asma’s research will be focused on Pakistani ceramics in Multan, Pakistan. In addition, Asma will be a panelist at NCECA’s 58th Annual Conference, Coalescence, in Richmond, Virginia. The panel, “Finding Clay People in Foreign Lands” investigates ceramic traditions and innovations over time and from around the world, and includes Fabiola De la Cueva (Moderator), Asma Waheed, and Japheth Asiedu-Kwarteng. A preliminary description of the panel states: “It takes great resilience, perseverance, determination, and courage to thrive and negotiate new spaces away from your homeland. Clay has been a medium of contact to build and embrace a community of belonging as we negotiate and tackle the trauma of being displaced on foreign land.”\n\nIn addition to her work with NCECA, Asma was a keynote speaker at Stockton University in Galloway, NJ as part of a celebration of Islamic Heritage month. Asma’s lecture highlighted Islamic art, particularly calligraphy, geometry and biomorphic patterns, and the impact art has in preserving religious and cultural heritage.\n\nBrooklyn-based artist, Fabienne Lasserre presents Listeners, an immersive and responsive installation consisting of a series of sculptures made of clear vinyl spray-painted with translucent gradients of color. The works obstruct, frame and direct vision, passage and movement. They always imply bodies: people who look through, walk around, and peer over. Simultaneously, the inert objects are dynamic as they reflect light and sway slightly when a viewer walks by.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, Fabienne Lasserre’s work has been deeply indebted to feminist thought. She thinks of her early sculptures as bodies envisioned outside of traditional dichotomies such as male/female, self/other, inside/outside. With time, these interests extended to the context surrounding bodies rather than to corporeality itself. Thinking of the body as a locus for political and philosophical metaphors, she makes objects that can enclose or frame a human. In these new works, Lasserre explores form, shape, and color in order to point to the many ways in which movement and location affect our ways of relating to the world and to one another.\n\nThe installation will be activated by a commissioned dance by choreographer, Beth Gill and an accompanying sound piece by experimental composer, Jon Moniaci. The new work will premiere at the Athenaeum on March 15 and 16.\n\nThis exhibition is supported by a grant from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and a Public Impact Grant from the Willson Center for Humanities and Arts.\n\nMFAST third year Katie Murphy presents \"Slippers of Fire,\" an exhibition of paintings at Galerie Tangerine in Nashville. In a statement about the exhibition Murphy writes: \"These paintings represent and explore my relationships: with my self, my family, my friends, and with Southern culture, especially in the context of being a woman. I consider the places and spaces where I’ve been allowed to exist, and I find myself questioning the containers offered. I am looking for avenues of choice and agency, for cracks within the traditional narrative that was drawn up for me.\"\n\nThe exhibition runs from September 28 - November 29, 2023, with an opening reception on September 28.\n\nAs part of “Outside In,” the MFAST 2nd & 3rd year group show held at the MICA Lazarus Graduate Center, Tamara Payne (Class of 2025) created a home-like space in the gallery, covering the walls with African textiles, antique furniture, mirrors, and frames, as well as embroidered and printed quotes from collaborators reflecting on experiences of black girlhood. At the closing reception, held in the galleries on North Avenue on Wednesday, July 19, Tamara led a procession of other black women and girls across North Avenue and into the installation. “It was an installation and performance piece,” said Payne in an exclusive interview with BMORENews.com. “I just aimed to bring light to Black women and show how we have to show up in the world. The light is unmatched. We’ve made so many contributions to the world and other families. We’ve invested in other cultures. When are we going to have our time? Yesterday we had our time. And it’s not over.”\n\nMFAST Director Fabienne Lasserre opens a new exhibition of work at Zalucky Contemporary in Toronto. \"With What Eyes\" presents a series of new paintings continuing to expand upon a visual language that prioritizes the viewer's experience of space. In this latest series of work, geometric forms painted in vivid colours line the walls of the gallery, lean into corners and dangle from the ceiling. The works encroach into the space, drawing attention to certain architectural features­­­­ while obstructing others. In this way, Lasserre’s abstract paintings behave much more like sculptures, coaxing the body’s perpetual movement throughout the space.\n\nThe show runs from April 6, 2023 - May 6, 2023, with the Opening Reception on Thursday April 6, 6-8PM.\n\nMFAST alum Fritz Horstman's first exhibition with Municipal Bonds in San Francisco features a selection of work from his Folded Cyanotypes series. The work comprises deep blue images of shapes that emerge from the confluence of folded paper and sunlight. Made by first folding paper by hand into an intricate pattern, they are then unfolded and cyanotype photographic fluid is applied by brush. Working in the dark to protect the light-sensitive material, the paper is refolded and placed in natural light, which the artist sometimes manipulates using mirrors and lenses. The paper is then rinsed in water, and pressed flat to dry. What was exposed to light in the process turns blue when developed, and what was not remains white, furthering the spatial complications by reversing lightness and darkness.\n\nMFAST Faculty Nadia Hironaka and long-time artistic collaborator Matthew Suib open \"Understories,\" an exhibition of new and recent films, sculpture, and holograms at Locks Gallery in Philadelphia. The show focuses on the theme of nature - growth, nurture, cultivation, cycles. The show's title 'understory' refers quite literally to the underlying layer of vegetation, specifically the trees and plants between the forest canopy and the ground cover.\n\nAt the heart of the exhibit is the film \"Field Companion\", a work set in a microcosmic forest, based loosely on the pine barrens that dot Southern New Jersey near the artists’ home. Like many, the duo found refuge and solace throughout the COVID-19 pandemic hiking and foraging in these remote, natural landscapes. As America’s social fabric frayed deeply over recent years, they considered forest ecosystems in terms of symbiotic and collaborative relationships that sustain coexistence and community. In \"Field Companion\", the forest has been condensed and transplanted to a terrarium in the artists’ studio. Twelve cubic feet of pines, shrubs, ferns, moss, fungus and carnivorous plants are reflected infinitely in the terrarium’s mirrored walls and captured with a motion-controlled camera and specialized macro lens that dramatically shift the scale and perspective of this miniature landscape. This exhibition will not only feature the film - which was shown as an immersive experience last year at Rowan University Art Gallery then Locusts Project in Miami - but also an accompanying terrarium.\n\nAlso featured will be \"Pink Carnations\" - an experimental reflection of a Japanese American family’s history at an internment camp during WWII. Through family photos, historical films, home movies, original 16mm footage and oral accounts from family members, Pink Carnations portrays a deeply poetic narrative spun from a mutating garden vegetation.\n\nEntitled ‘Tangible nothingness: An unfinished becoming’, the show will be up from May 6th through June 16th, 2022. The exhibition will examine the intersection of experience and perception. Tangible Nothingness is an opportunity to consider how our interactions within our world shape us and we then shape our world, how we affect and are affected by our environment and by our experiences, translated through psychology, biology/physiology, technology and installation design.\n\nThe multi-media exhibition will be designed with consideration of contemporary ways in which we move through our world, notice speed and time, and interact with others around us. The work illustrates and invites the audience to consider how perception and association are the basis for what may be understood.\n\nFrom April 8 to May 12, the Art Association of Harrisburg, PA, is showing On Site, a sculptural exhibition by MFAST alumna Nicole Herbert.\n\n'Herbert’s artistic practice is guided by the question, “How can art be used to call attention to things that we take for granted?” This question is inspired by her anthropology studies as an undergraduate and her time living abroad in Niger, West Africa as a Peace Corps volunteer. Studying other cultures helped cultivate a respect for different perspectives. Living in a foreign country for an extended period of time challenged what Herbert took for granted and provided a new perception of her home when she returned. In keeping with Victor Skhlovsky’s idea of ostranenie, or having the familiar or commonplace made strange, Herbert seeks to highlight overlooked aspects of the everyday in her work'.\n\nExcerpt from the artist’s statement\n\nMFASt alumna Mary Stuart Hall is part of a group show called “City as a site” in Atlanta Airport. The Artist’s is showing an installation entitled “As the Crow Flies” comprising a framed 12 ft cyanotype , hundreds of ceramic houses, and a text on the windows that refers to the horizon line.\n\n“A string of moments compressed or deflated into one location, As the Crow Flies considers our place in space and time as one that is shifting and relational. Whether we are moving through space at the speed of flight or the incremental pace of everyday life, our understanding of a moment in time cannot be separated from our spatial encounter. We can move through space, but not time. And yet, it is time that lets us know we have moved, time must be motion, it must be forward motion. Although limiting time to the fluidity of our experience of it, seems reductive. The interval between here and there, then and now is the predominant force that shapes our past, our future, and where both of those are located. Lost, floating between the fields of space and time, a horizon line is an illusion that locates us, anchors us between a here and a there, an up and down. We are here at this time, in this space, for now” Artist’s statement.\n\nThe show will be up for at least a year at concourse E in Atlanta Airport. It includes 6 artists dealing with place in and history in several different ways. The curator of the show, Jess Bernhart, was particularly interested in the way the airport was a unique venue to explore the idea of a non-place.\n\nGlacial Movements is a solo show by MFAST alumnus Fritz Horstman, opening March 31at Ishibashi Gallery, Concord, MA . Horstman will be showing several sculptures from his U-Shaped Valley series, as well as new Folded Cyanotypes\n\n“Folded Cyanotypes is a series of two-dimensional objects, which carry the memory of light, three-dimensional space and manual manipulation, and which stem from an interest in natural structure. Made by first folding paper by hand into an intricate pattern, they are then unfolded, and coated with cyanotype photographic fluid. Working in the dark to protect the light-sensitive material, the paper is refolded, then placed in natural light, and sometimes manipulated using mirrors and lenses. The paper is then rinsed in water, and pressed flat to dry. What was exposed to light in the process turns blue when developed, and what was not remains white, furthering the spatial complications by reversing lightness and darkness.”\n\nExcerpt from Artist's statement\n\nOpening reception from 7-8pm on Thursday, March 31\n\nAfter the opening the gallery is open by appointment until May 14, 2022.\n\nFaculty member Jackie Milad opens a show at Luis de Jesus Los Angeles gallery. This exhibition is the artist’s first solo exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition will be on view from February 26 through April 9, 2022.\n\nJackie Milad’s practice is motivated by a need to record and tell her personal story, and in doing so, assert stories like her own into the collective history. As a child in a multi-cultural immigrant family, Milad struggled to connect the history of her Honduran and Egyptian ancestry to her life as an American. For this reason, she deeply considers authors of history and how those stories are recorded and shared across generations and borders.\n\n\"We Are All Swiftly Fleeting\" is a virtual exhibition showing recent work from the graduating classes of 2022 and 2023, open from February 1st to June 15, 2022.\n\nThe emphasis of the MFAST program is in integrating practice with theory, where students are encouraged to be independent thinkers and researchers who may focus on one specific medium or work across various media. During each 6 week summer intensive, graduate students in their 2nd and 3rd academic years of the MFAST program, are invited to participate in a public exhibition of their work. “We Are All Swiftly Fleeting” is an online iteration of that annual event.\n\nMFAST Director Fabienne Lasserre is participating in the White Columns 'Looking Back' exhibition in NYC from January 22 to March 5, 2022. This 12th iteration of the Annual show, is curated by the New York-based artist Mary Manning. \"The 'Annual' exhibitions hope to reveal something of the complexities involved in trying to negotiate – and engage with – New York’s constantly shifting cultural landscapes. The format of the exhibition inevitably encourages highly subjective and personal responses to the realities of viewing art in New York City. The ‘Annual’ exhibition series hopes to illuminate aspects of the specific, yet highly idiosyncratic networks – historical, social, aesthetic, etc. – that individuals follow in an increasingly expansive and fragmented cultural environment. Writing about their experience working on the exhibition Manning said:“As the global pandemic raged on for another year in 2021 I felt that I was still working with confusion and some heartbreak, so the experience of getting to go look at art with a purpose of sorts had a different, more joyful register. I primarily used love as a guiding metric to select these works, being aware of the messy hard work that comes with love and the rigorous emotional work that went into making these pieces.” – Mary Manning, 2022.”\n\nSolange Roberdeau (Class of 2012) is showing her newest work along with London-based Artist Jochen Holz at the Blunk space gallery, Inverness CA from December 11, 2021 to February 6, 2022\n\n“Solange and Jochen work across different mediums – drawing and glass – but share a penchant for spontaneity and experimentation. Both artists push the limits of their materials by incorporating and combining innovative processes and techniques. Additions of lusters and gilding, wood rubbings and textures, add depth and richness to their work. For this exhibition, Solange produced three series of drawings using sumi and walnut ink, including a collection of pieces made at the JB Blunk house, which will be presented alongside handmade tableware and neon lights by Jochen. Working with ink, paint, paper, wood, fabric, and nontraditional gilding (applying metal leaf to a surface), Solange creates drawings that reflect the cadences of the natural world and her immediate surroundings.\"\n\nZhàomíng Illumination 照明 is a new solo show by MFAST alumna Lindsey Bailey (Class of 2016) at the Pence-Chowning Art Gallery in Campbellsville University, Kentucky.\n\n\"Utilizing a variety of mixed media, I have created installations in each of the three spaces at the Pence-Chowning Art Gallery. Each installation is lit at various angles to create shadows on objects and walls. These shadows may be abstract or representational, and are loosely based on my experience living in China for three years. Some of the shadows are outlined with silver tape to reinforce the shapes. Threads of tiny bunting seemingly connect each installation, decorating found objects and discarded items, hiding their wear and tear. My process involves a lot of play and a vibrant energy. I want my work to energize the space or the space to be dynamic\"\n\nExcerpt from Bailey's statement\n\nOpening: December 30th, 2021 to January 29th, 2022\n\nReception and artist talk: January 27th, 5 - 7pm\n\nWorkshop for students, January 27th in the afternoon\n\nEntitled \"Prototype for a Landscape\", the show shines a light on the unspoken connections that hold our communities together. Artists Alice Keeney, Mary Stuart Hall and Kate Hooray Osmond explore themes of Power, Transcendence, and Generation within our land. Portraits of healers, agricultural field maps, celestial constellations, and molecular forces reveal the deeper threads that bind us to our land and to each other. With over 50 new artworks that range from small black and white photographs to large, bright printwork and gilded paintings, the show reflects a shared humanity and reveals that there is much more to a landscape when we consider the connections beyond what can be seen. The show is on view at City Gallery October 22 through December 21, 2021.\n\nThe first time I heard of Annette Wehrhahn, I was standing in front of a huge painting of hers at a mutual friend’s apartment. It was an extraordinary work! At once garish, glamorous, cool, and vulnerable—it was total magic. When I finally met her several years later, it was during the preparation for Soloway gallery’s inaugural show, Parts and Labor, in 2010. Annette and three other friends, one of whom, Munro Galloway, was the person who had Annette’s dazzling painting in his living room, had just opened the space in Brooklyn and invited about forty artists to contribute small works. Years later, Annette and I had a two-person show at Safe Gallery in Brooklyn in 2016, and then traveled together to Luxembourg for an exhibition curated by Wallace Whitney at Ceysson & Bénétière Gallery in 2017. I still smile when I remember how much we laughed and the many stories she told me as we worked on those shows. Annette and I had a really strong connection right when we met and have been big fans of each other’s work since.\n\nAnnette lived behind Soloway for seven years and was the director for eleven. Her current solo exhibition at the gallery, Human Remains, marks her retirement as director after these many fruitful years.\n\n—Fabienne Lasserre\n\n“The word Cervidae describes the large family of even-toed, hoofed mammals that possess deciduous antlers. Members of the order Artiodactyla, these animals include deer, elk, moose, and the like. Growing up in Texas, Damon Arhos reflects on a variety of expectations for his behaviors and interests. “Hunting, for example, was a strong should”. The artist makes the parallel with expectations for gender and sexuality that he describes as inherently social.\n\nWith the solo exhibition Cervidae, Arhos explores gender and sexual identity via the image of a so-called “trophy buck” – one that, for him, represents pride, strength, and honesty. “By repeating this form, I am reenacting and contemplating my own actions – in many cases, those influenced by the beliefs and expectations of others. In addition, as I produce the work, I am imagining how I might have affirmed myself during many uncomfortable moments” notes Arhos.\n\nAt the MFAST low-residency graduate program, most of a calendar year is not, in fact, spent on campus. The nature of MICA’s pedagogy also emphasizes the necessity of ongoing practice and its personal stakes—facilitating the exploration of how one makes work across mediums newly encountered or long-beloved, without the intensity of expectation (by students or others) to engage the art market or certain professional art worlds. As layoffs, this year have spread across the art world, with museums closing their doors to limited reopening and so many arts organizations being shuttered altogether, the professional opportunities for being an artist have faltered, and those remaining have searched themselves for why they make art, and how they might continue.\n\nIt is a truism that all art is rooted in the spheres of the personal, however during this year, the personal sphere has been a particularly pressured category and space for experience and exploration—with trajectories of life and thresholds upended, one’s a sense of kin wrecked by fear, illness, and grief, and the home now simultaneously an office, studio, ICU and school. And so it is no wonder that the work I saw investigated the personal as a realm organized by architecture, history, and matters of public concern.\n\nExcerpt from an essay by Dr. Jeannine Tang\n\nCity Gallery is honored to present Legacy & Rupture, a group show curated by interdisciplinary artist and educator Howard el-Yasin. Work by artists Nathaniel Donnett, Sika Foyer, Merik Goma, James Montford, Ransome, Kamar Thomas, and Marisa Williamson will be on display from May 1 through May 30.\n\nLegacy & Rupture brings together these seven wonderful contemporary black artists whose work expresses the multiplicity of our identities framed by the everydayness of precarity, trauma, and memories. Critical black consciousness thinker Christina Sharpe reminds us that “the past that is not past reappears, always, to rupture the present.” If rupture, as such, is also understood to mean resistance, black aesthetic practitioners have the capacity to resist the historical materiality (race, class, gender, and sexuality) and the subjectivity of blackness. The artwork in this show explores differences in representation rather than the reproduction of blackness.\n\nContributed by Sangram Majumdar / I think I met Angelina first through a mutual friend Karla Wozniak when Karla and I were residents at the Sharpe Walentas Residency in 2009. Soon we realized we had other things in common, including MICA, where she went for a brief time. I met Fabienne when she began teaching at MICA, and over many drives between Baltimore and Brooklyn we learned a lot about each other. Both Fabienne and Angelina are also part of a studio group that have been meeting for a while, seeing each other’s work evolve and grow over time. On the occasion of their respective solo exhibitions in New York –– Angelina Gualdoni at Asya Geisberg Gallery and Fabienne Lasserre at Turn Gallery — we sat down via Zoom to talk about their recent work.\n\nApril 2 - May 14, 2021\n\nThe Maryland Institute College of Art’s low-residency MFA (MFAST) program has always transcended significant distances, bringing together geographically-dispersed artists already established in their practices for intensive sessions of learning and critique. Rather than mediums, approaches, or themes, these artists hold in common the desire to develop their art within a tight community while they maintain their connection to their home locations and careers. The class of 2020, comprised of eight students living from Baltimore to Berlin, also share the unique experience of a pandemic disrupting their plans for a final in-person, on-site gathering and exhibition last summer. Consequently, the period for producing their culminating works has extended into unprecedented months of protests against social injustice, a presidential campaign reflecting extreme divisions in American society, and widespread uncertainty about personal and economic health. - Excerpt from essay by Kristen Hileman\n\nIn conjunction with the MFAST Class of 2020 exhibition at VisArts, join us for an outdoor public performance in front of the Gibbs Street Gallery on April 18th at 3PM. This performance will be led by Liz Miller, whose work is on view from April 2 – May 14, 2021 in the Kaplan Gallery.\n\nThis performance is a ritual cleansing of one of the sites where three African-Americans were lynched in the 1880s. Sidney Randolph was lynched a block from VisArts. Four performers will ritually cleanse the space. Each performer will serve as a surrogate for one of the lost lives; the creator of the ritual will preside as high priestess over the ceremony. The artist Liz Miller has conceived the ritual cleansing concept in conjunction with her wearable hair sculptures."
