        "text": "Asya was born in Russia and her early life and rich cultural heritage has created a storehouse of visual imagery in terms of subject matter, colour, and form, from which she now draws her inspiration. Her artistic interests are wide ranging, creating figurative sculptures, paintings, and engaging multi-dimensional reliefs, often exploring favourite themes and motifs.\n\nSince relocating to the UK in the 2000â€™s, Asya has attained a 1st Class Honours Degree in Interior Design, tutored both novice and established students in several established Art Schools, and exhibited her work widely. She is a unique and distinctive artist."
