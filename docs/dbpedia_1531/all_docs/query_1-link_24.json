        "text": "In Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the West 102nd & 103rd Streets Block Association\n\nBy Caitlin Hawke\n\nIt is a very rare pleasure to meet people like Asya and Ted Berger whose zest for community and sense of history and rootedness in Bloomingdale are as strong as ever. At the March 2021 Block Association meeting, which due to the pandemic, was held virtually, Asya and Ted gave a loving talk about the early days of their lives on W. 103rd Street and the community members -- some larger than life -- who came together to build this association. It was so well received, that we caught up one recent weekend and recorded it for the blog. And so, it is my pleasure to give you this recording of Asya and Ted reprising their slideshow and remembrances. For those of you reading in an email subscription to the blog, click on this link for the embedded video. For those of you who prefer to read, scroll down for the transcript and images.\n\nThe Bergers have the gift of making even newcomers nostalgic for a freewheeling time when lives were lived on stoops, chatting up neighbors, and in basements planning for big events with a sole purpose of weaving the fabric of a community.\n\nThe Block Association is 50, and you can show your love by making a contribution here.\n\nEnjoy this trip down Bloomingdale's Memory Lane! And remember, if you cannot see the video, click here or scroll down for a transcribed version of their live presentation.\n\nOn the Streets Where We Live by Asya and Ted Berger\n\n​\n\nLen, Asya, Donna, Ted, Cherie, and Our Snow Friend\n\nAll of us with our son Jonathan and Mel\n\nTED: We’re so grateful to the Block Association and to Ginger Lief, our great neighborhood resource, for asking us to talk a bit about its early years. We also want to thank Bob Aaronson, Nancy Gropper, and Caitlin Hawke for their technical help in preparing and helping us show some pictures with this talk.\n\nThinking about these years is somewhat like starting a Proustian Journey. It’s like eating a madeleine and remembering things past. It’s hard to believe it’s been fifty years since a founding group had the smarts and vision to get the Block Association going.\n\nPlease forgive us if, as we reminisce, we haven’t given equal time to both 102nd and 103rd St. or West End. We suspect we’ve thought a bit more about 103rd St. because that’s where we live. Forgive us as well if we don’t mention all the people and events we know we should, and we apologize if we get any facts and names wrong. (After all, we’re not historians – and at this stage in our lives, we’re lucky we remembered to show up today!)\n\nWe also regret we’ll probably be reading too much, but my tech skills leave much to be desired, and I couldn’t figure out how to turn the computer into a teleprompter.\n\nAlso, we apologize for the quality of many very old photographs. I’m not much of a photographer either.\n\nAs Asya and I thought about all the years on these streets where we’ve been fortunate to live so long, we’ve been flooded with memories of some of the dearest people we have ever known. To us, this trip down memory lane is not only the story of these streets; it’s the story of people –and how people can effect change and, most especially, how our friendships turned to love and will be forever with us.\n\nWe’ve lived on 103rd St. for nearly 57 years.\n\nRight after we were married, we moved to 103rd St. in the fall, 1964 – first renting at 305; then, in 1971, we moved next door to 303 –renting first the ground floor floor-through; then, when we purchased the building with another couple in ’74, creating the duplex where we still live with our current upstairs neighbors, Peter Frischauf and KC Rice, who in 1982 bought their share from our original partners. As you may know, Peter and KC have worked hard on the 103rd St, Open Street Project and the recent terrific celebration of Earth Day.\n\nASYA: When we lived at 305, one day we were fortunate to meet a neighbor, our beloved Donna Lavine, who lived with her husband Mel in the floor-through next door, where we now live. Little did we know then – on the day we met Donna – how our lives would forever change, how her friendly “hello” destined us to become “family.”\n\nDonna and Mel had moved to the block a few years earlier when he attended Columbia’s Journalism School. He then became a producer on the Today Show. Donna soon introduced us to another couple in the neighborhood, Len and Cherie Tredanari, who had moved to the block in 1954 with their two children, Adriana and Gregory. A few years later, they bought the brownstone at 307 W. 103rd. ​\n\nWe all became very close friends. Ted and I were a bit younger than the four of them, and we all really connected. Len and Cherie seemed to know everyone in the neighborhood. They had been involved in an earlier effort with neighbors to get a playground built in Riverside Park between 104th and 105th Sts. They understood the need for do-it-yourself, grassroots organizing and advocacy if you wanted to effect change in the neighborhood in those days.\n\nTED: If you know anything about the history of NYC in the 60’s and 70’s, you may know that West Side was then very different from what it has become. The setting for the musical “West Side Story” is where Lincoln Center is now. What is now known as the Lincoln Square neighborhood was formerly San Juan Hill. The construction of Lincoln Center was an urban renewal project spearheaded by Robert Moses.\n\nLeft to right above: The San Juan Hill Neighborhood-West 63rd St.\n\nThe \"West Side Story,\"\n\n​\"Something's Coming...\"\n\nWhen I was a graduate student at Columbia in those days, the Park at 72nd and Broadway was known as “Needle Park.” You may have heard of the film, “Panic in Needle Park.” The Upper West Side had a reputation of being more like the Wild West when it came to safety. Many blocks and buildings were astoundingly beautiful and very stable; others somewhat dicey. However, it was also very affordable. Our first apartment in the brownstone at 303 W. 103 was $110/month.\n\n102nd and 103rd were really beautiful streets. Tree-lined, anchored by large apartment buildings at the corners, such as the well-known landmarked Master Apartments and the Candela buildings at 865 and 875 West End. Brownstones were in-between; many – like our row of brownstones where we live, built in 1895. The subway and the Park were nearby. We all knew we lived in a special neighborhood, yet we were very much aware we were in the midst of an economically challenged city at the time, with growing crime, racial tensions, and an increasing decline in the general quality of life.\n\nBut we really loved the neighborhood!\n\nTechnically, Asya and I are not actual founders of the Block Association. Before we became involved, a few neighborhood veterans started meeting and decided, if the neighborhood was going to thrive, the formation of a block association was needed. And so in 1971, the 102nd-103rd Block Association came into being.\n\nVolume 1, Issue 1: Our very first newsletter - May 20, 1971\n\nThe first issue of the newsletter reads: “From small beginnings, great things grow. Little more than an idea two months ago, the 102nd-103rd Street Block Association has become a reality.\n\nOriginally planned to meet the common need and interests of the people living between Broadway and Riverside Drive and West End Ave, between 102nd and 103rd Streets, the association’s steering committee voted to include 102nd St. The interest expressed by the residents of 102nd St. have been overwhelming and pooling our resources will certainly strengthen the association.”\n\nExisting Committees at that time were formed: Social Committee, Ecology, Safety, Housing, General Membership. The first Co-Chairs were Carol Goldstein and Ed Warner.\n\nWe found the above article in the archives of the Block Association’s newsletters (thanks to Ginger Lief!), so we just want to take a moment to mention how the Block Association’s continuing publication of the newsletter – and now our website - have been so vital to our sense of community all these years. We salute all the editors and writers throughout the years who’ve kept up the communication, letting us know what we need to know about each other and our blocks . We especially want to thank our present newsletter group, now spearheaded by Hedy Campbell.\n\nASYA: But back to the start –\n\nOne of the newly formed Block Association’s first victories came in the Fall, 1971 when 11 new trash baskets were placed on all the street corners. Of course, chains had to be attached to discourage stealing.\n\nBecause of the common concerns about safety, one of the Block Association’s primary goals was to raise money to hire a security guard for the area. Similarly, in these years, much effort went into raising money to get better lighting in the area.\n\nWe want to highlight some events in these early years which brought attention to our blocks and became cornerstones of some of our present activities.\n\nA few years after the Block Association started, a prime strategy emerged to both bring people together and to raise money for the block association’s commitment to guard service - the development of our first ever block party. In those days, block parties and street fairs were not as common as they now are.\n\nAfter a number of block parties were held, a group of us decided we needed to make an even greater impact. We were determined that our block parties should be something people would remember. We recall forming a Planning Committee of the Block Association, including Len and Cherie Tredanari, Ginger Lief, Jennes Eertmoed, Joe Hussey, John and Liz Berseth, Edna Guttag, Gertrude Ellis, and the two of us.\n\nTED: Organizing these block parties became a great community-building effort spearheaded by board members with other neighbors volunteering as we needed more help. We met frequently to deal with the many details of the event.\n\nThe basement of our brownstone served as headquarters. Week after week we created booths, painted signs under Cherie Tredanari’s artistic expertise; we joked and laughed, and always shared a glass or two or three of Tred Red, the homemade red wine, Len Tredanari joyfully made in the cellar of their house at 307.\n\nIndeed, one of the most successful booths at every block party in those early years was the annual one in front of the Tred’s house. Using multiple grills, we grilled many, many Italian sausages with peppers and onions on rolls. As an extra bonus you could sample some Tred Red. Of course, this probably wasn’t legal, so naturally, there was always a long line waiting. We brought in a lot of money.\n\nASYA: One of our blocks’ major cultural assets at that time was the Equity Library Theater (ELT), a showcase for acting and theater talent, located in the auditorium of the Masters Institute since 1961 through its final season in 1989. (In fact, one of our son’s first jobs was as an usher at the theater when he was 7 or 8.)\n\nThe Block Association began a collaboration with ELT for the next few years as we developed our Block Parties. One year we focused the block party on celebrating George and Ira Gershwin who lived on 103rd St. near Riverside. ELT organized an array of talent throughout the day to sing and play a great range of Gershwin songs.\n\nThe block party drew a large crowd. People loved it. We were a hit! And we made money too. The Block Association’s reputation started to grow, for both people in the immediate neighborhood and for people in the surrounding area\n\nTED: Here are some pictures from various block parties from 1977-1986. ​\n\n​\n\nBesides the Gershwin-themed Block Party, we also remember another outstanding one, “Turn of the Century NY” where neighbors came in costume.\n\nOur block parties continued to bring in the revenue we needed. Moreover, they were important community events bringing us all closer. Admittedly, these were big productions that required a lot of volunteer effort.\n\nThere were some other Block Association program/fundraising highlights we remember in these early years.\n\nIn 1973, Fred Fried, who lived in 875 WEA, presented a slide lecture, “How the West Was Won.” Fred, a Smithsonian Fellow and NY historian and author, told the history of the West Side from 1810 to the present.\n\nIn 1975, Gretchen Cryer, our neighborhood award-winning theater artist and writer who lives in 885 WEA, produced the “Best of the West.” This musical showcase brought together celebrated performers in the neighborhood and on the West\n\nSide for the benefit of the Block Association.\n\nThe Block Association also produced a successful Cookbook in the late 70’s, gathering recipes from residents in the area.\n\nASYA: Another equally important community-building event that started perhaps 40 years ago is our now famous Halloween Parade. Originally it was a small event so the kids in the neighborhood would have an opportunity to show off their costumes. We seem to recall the Halloween Parade was Cherie Tredanari’s brainchild. A few tables were set up on WEA between 875 and 865; members of the block association board handed out doughnuts and apples. The kids then circled around showing off their costumes. Everyone in costume won a prize.\n\nOver the years, as the number of kids grew larger and larger, it was a challenge for the judges to have enough categories so that every child could be recognized. As the event grew, more apples and doughnuts were needed; people agreed to bake cakes and cookies. Cherie and I spearheaded a crew to assemble packages of treats long before the event itself. Then, along with others such as Mildred Speiser, we sat at a long table, distributing the treats so everyone came away with something.\n\n​\n\nJonathan as Peter Pan and ready for the Halloween Parade\n\nThe Parade!\n\n.As we all know, our Halloween Parade has become one of the signature events of the Block Association. Eventually 102nd St. was blocked off so more people could mingle and assemble before and after the parade.\n\nTED: As you may have gathered, our beloved friends, Len and Cherie, were mainstays of our neighborhood. Len, who liked to think of himself as the Mayor of 103rd St., knew everyone. Cherie adored this neighborhood and took enormous pride in what she and Len had done to make this area more liveable and friendly. The day her sculpture was installed on the median strip at 106th and Broadway, where it still remains, may have been one of the proudest days of her life. How appropriate it is that with the Block Association’s leadership, a memorial bench on the upper level of Riverside Park near 103rd St., overlooking our streets, was dedicated in their honor in recognition for all they did for all of us. The plaque below reads, \"Len and Cherie Tredanari – For what they gave our neighborhood…They love life, family, friends, food, wine, art, and this park --- Always, Our Treds.\"\n\nASYA: During these beginning years of our Block Association, other block associations started to form on the Upper West Side. Soon we were all starting to talk to one another about common issues. As a result, the first steps were taken to form the area Coalition of Block Associations above 96th St. We discovered the name “Bloomingdale District” was used to refer to part of the Upper West Side – from 96th St. to 110th St and bounded on the east by Amsterdam Ave. and Riverside Drive. Its name was a variation of the description given to the area by the Dutch settlers, likely “Bloemendaal,” a town in the tulip region.\n\nAccordingly, the Coalition was named the Bloomingdale Area Coalition, and we started getting more attention from elected officials, city agencies, and the police precinct.\n\nAs indicated earlier, in the early 70’s when the Block Association was formed, certain streets were really rough. The lower part of 103rd St,, between West End and Broadway, then had two of the worst SRO’s (Single Room Occupancy) buildings in the city. The past glory of the Marseilles Hotel had deteriorated significantly and parts of it burned-out. The Alexandria had become a haven for drug dealing and crime.\n\nThe Block Association was determined to do something about this. Accordingly, when we learned that the West Side Federation for Senior Housing (WSFSH) might possibly be interested in developing the Marseilles into senior housing, we decided to try to help to make this happen. WSFSH needed funds to engage legal support for this transition. Accordingly, the Block Association committed itself to a grassroots fundraising campaign to help. We organized teams of people to be at the subway each morning and evening asking for donations towards this effort. People also did this going door to door in their apartment buildings. The funds raised and the support of the Block Association were vital to the eventual successful transformation of the Marseilles.\n\nHotel Marseilles\n\n\"...an ideal stopping place\"\n\nHotel Alexandria\n\nAnother partnership which has had a significant impact on the Block Association developed when the Lynwood Nursing Home on 102nd St. was sold to become the Saint Luke’s Halfway House which opened in 1974. Initial nervousness soon abated as the Block Association and the Halfway House worked hard to strengthen our relationship and collaborations. Residents at Saint Lukes have been supportive throughout the years of many of our Block Association events.\n\nTED: Over these 50 years the Block Association has been a constant, despite the transition of many buildings from rental apartments to coops, despite the many changes that happened in our neighborhood, despite how often the streetscape on Broadway has changed!\n\nWhen we first came to the neighborhood, on the northwest corner of 103rd St., for example, Mr. Abolafia had a wonderful flower stand there for many years. Directly across the street, where Subway used to be and where the Purple Circle Nursery School will soon be, there was a coffee shop, the Red Chimney. Where Janovic’s was until recently, there used to be Lamston’s, our local five and dime store that sold everything. On the West Broadway block between 102nd and 103rd, there was a Chinese restaurant, the Harbin Inn. Some of you may recall the fact that the Tredanari’s son, Gregory, opened a cheese and pasta store and restaurant where Café du Soleil is now located.\n\nOn the east side of Broadway between 103rd and 104th was the Edison Theater, a movie theater built in 1913, where for most of its life it showed second and third run double bills, occasionally first runs. In the late 60’s it showed films with Spanish subtitles, then all Spanish films. It was eventually demolished to build the new apartment building there. On the same block, at the southeast corner of Broadway and 104th St., now the location of City MD, is one of the extraordinary architectural treasures of our area, a former Horn and Hardart Automat which closed in 1953 and was declared a NYC Landmark in 2007. The building’s fanciful Art Deco ornamentation was covered over for many years until it was uncovered when City MD moved in.\n\nBroadway certainly changed, but the sense of community strengthened in large part because of the Block Association. It’s been like our own grassroots government, helping to make this area often seem like a small town.\n\nWe love knowing that Humphrey Bogart and George Gershwin and the award-winning composer, Charles Wuorinen lived in this area! We take pride that Norman Rockwell lived nearby, on 103rd St., east of Broadway.\n\nBut we especially value the Block Association because it’s always thinking about our blocks’ past, present, and future. We love knowing the architectural history of the buildings surrounding us, but we appreciate the Block Association is making sure our streetlamps are working so we can see our buildings. We cherish the many ways the Block Association brings us together. Our continuing Block Parties remain important community events and revenue generators – and yes, they always require a lot of work to organize them!\n\nBesides the Halloween Parade, another signature event has become the Holiday Caroling. For nearly 40 years Anthony Belov has magnificently led with skill and style our Block annual Winter Solstice Caroling, bringing good holiday cheer and the spirit of small-town life to our neighborhood. Annually, we also celebrate our own Rite of Spring, with our own tree-well plantings, reminding us all of the beauty of nature and the importance of our trees. All of these activities shape our sense of community, helping strangers become neighbors and friends, even extended family.\n\nASYA: From the start we wanted our Block Association to be something special. How grateful we all are that it still remains so! It is the spirit of this community that has always made it something special!\n\nThanks to all the people over the years who have led the organization for all of us – and thanks to the many, many people who, under their leadership, have generously volunteered their time and energy, creativity, and support which have allowed us to get to this special anniversary moment.\n\nTED: One of my favorite books about New York is EB White’s New York. In it, he says:\n\n“One of the oft-quoted thumbnail sketch of New York is, of course: “It’s a wonderful place, but I’d hate to live there.” I have an idea that people from villages and small towns, people accustomed to the convenience and the friendliness of neighborhood over-the-fence living, are unaware that life in New York follows the neighborhood pattern. The city is literally a composite of tens of thousands of neighborhood units. There are, of course, the big districts and big units: Chelsea and Murray Hill and Gramercy (which are residential units), Harlem.., Greenwich Village.., and there is Radio City, Peter Cooper Village, the Medical Center..,and many other sections each of which has some distinguishing characteristic. But the curious thing about New York is that each large geographical unit is composed of countless small neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is virtually self-sufficient, usually it is no more than two or three blocks long and a couple of blocks wide. Each area is a city within a city within a city.”\n\nNo matter where you live in New York, generally you’ll find within a block or two or three, a self-contained city – more or less – with its grocery store, newsstand, cleaners, laundry, deli, flower shop, shoe repair, etc. – because there’s a critical mass who need such services.\n\nYes, we do live in an extraordinary neighborhood- Yes, it is like a small town.\n\nOur Block association newsletter masthead\n\nThanks for our 102nd and 103rd St. Block Association for these 50 years! Despite all the changes we’ve seen and lived through in this area, we’ve all been woven into the history and tapestry of these blocks, this Bloomingdale area, and the ever-changing magnificent fabric of this great city we think of as “home.\n\nAnd, as we all know, there really is no place like home!\n\nAnd so, we raise a glass of – you guessed it! – Tred Red!- still lovingly made by the Tredanari Family.\n\nASYA: We salute those who started this Block Association.\n\nWe celebrate everyone who has worked so hard to help it flourish. We thank all those have contributed their generosity of coin, time, and spirit to keep it going.\n\nWe pass on with pride and honor the legacy of these 50 years of the 102nd and 103rd St Block Association to all those who will follow us in this neighborhood and shape its future.\n\nThank you all. There really is no place like home!\n\nTred Red\n\nEnter your email address:\n\nDelivered by FeedBurner\n\nSitting Down with Neighbor Anthony Bellov in Candela Corners\n\nRosario Candela designed 865 West End Avenue (built 1924-5). It sits across W. 102nd Street from the St. Andoche (far left, partial view) built in 1895 by famous actor Maggie Mitchell.\n\nIf you enjoy reading this blog, spread the word!\n\nYour friends and neighbors may subscribe at bottom to receive blog posts directly via email.\n\nLike the Blog? Spread the Blove.\n\nBy Caitlin Hawke\n\nIf you missed Anthony Bellov's \"Candela Corners\" talk for the West 102nd-103rd Streets Block Association last week, fret no more. The recording will be posted here tomorrow for your viewing pleasure. Blog subscribers will have to click on the title of the blog to view the embedded video online.\n\nIn the meantime, I caught up with Anthony, a former Block Association board member and longtime neighbor. We share a fondness for the corner at W. 102nd Street and West End Avenue where most every pre-war era collides in an explosion of styles and housing variations. I've written before about the early buildings like the Townsend House and my personal favorite, the St. Andoche.\n\nNow it's time to pay some mind to the great Sicilian American architect Rosario Candela who left a mark on the way New Yorkers live by way of the incredible number of residential buildings he designed in the 1920s and 1930s. The Upper East Side boasts a fair number of them, but Candela Corners belong to us, Bloomingdalers. With fine examples of his work at 800, 820, 865, 875, 878, and 915 West End and more south of here, you can't hold a candle to us!\n\nYou'll enjoy the intimacy of Anthony's talk as he infiltrated almost every Candela on West End to bring alive the architectural features that Candela was known for and that make living in one of his buildings a classic New York experience.\n\nSo keep your eye out tomorrow for the blog post with the video. And, now, as a little hors d'oeuvre, read on for my sit-down with Anthony.\n\nQ&A with Anthony Bellov\n\nCaitlin: How long have you lived in the neighborhood?\n\nAnthony: I moved into 865 West End immediately after graduating from Pratt Institute School of Architecture in 1979. I really wanted to try \"the City thing\" for a while and Bloomingdale reminded me so much of my native Park Slope I felt right at home. Over 40 years later... I'm still here.\n\nCaitlin: Ha! With echoes of Elaine Stritch. So how long did it take you to get involved in the Block Association?\n\nAnthony: Not long! Lil Oliver, an 865 neighbor and Sy Oliver's wife and head of the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA), invited me to produce a show for one of the Block Parties - titled \"On the Streets Where You Live\" given in the early 1980's. I used my students - along with the many other things I do, I've taught singing since 1978, trained by my own teacher to do so - and I was immediately embraced by this wonderful community. It's terrific to feel so at home in supposedly uncaring, unfriendly Manhattan.\n\nI've been active with the Block Association in many ways since then. I was a board member for seven years and spearheaded the efforts to stagger traffic lights on West End and have stop signs installed on the Riverside Drive service road. After stepping down I've continued being active; I deeply believe in community involvement. I've always believed that if I'm not part of the solution then I'm part of the problem.\n\nI suggested to the board that we hold a Yard Sale in the spring to bookend the one 104th Street does each fall - I guess that was around 2004? I offered to manage the vendors in order to kick it off. I then served in that function for 13 years consecutively. In 1983 I thought it would be nice to do some holiday caroling and initially organized friends in my building to wander around singing. The Block Association offered to get involved and our Annual Solstice Caroling was born. Since then I've been happy to lead it each year, with the exception of three years when the weather was simply too brutal for us to hold it. This is our first pandemic - and virtual caroling - however. (Note: to join in the remote Caroling on December 21, you should write to [email protected] for details).\n\nCaitlin: It's an impressive amount of leaning in. And now you've just given your Candela Corners talk for the BA. What sparked your interest in Rosario Candela?\n\nAnthony: I first learned of him when I was studying architecture at Pratt institute in the 1970s. Paul Goldberger of the New York Times had \"outed\" him around then, and I recall my instructors praising his work. Years later I was thrilled to learn I had been living in a Candela building when Andrew Dolkart's report for the West End Avenue Historic District was published.\n\nCaitlin: Yes, Dolkart is epic and that report is a Rosetta Stone for folks interested in our history. I know these research projects are really about the hunt. As an introvert, I've found that getting lost in a topic is one of life's great gifts, conjuring our forebears and imagining who came before. Could you describe a little about how you did your research and what resources were of most value to your story?\n\nAnthony: Andra Moss of Landmark West! approached me with the idea to do a series of talks on the Upper West Side. Among the topics we explored, never realizing what a \"hit\" it was going to be, was one on Rosario Candela, since we were both fans and both disappointed at the exhibition the Museum of the City of New York had put together.\n\nAs soon as word got out that I was preparing a talk several people approached me, like Alan Sukoenig and other residents of 915 West End Avenue who had been avidly fighting their building's owners over the disfigurements in the name of \"renovation\" that were going on in that building. They put me in touch with the Candela family and Andrew Alpern, the author of \"The New York Apartment Houses of Rosario Candela and James Carpenter,\" who were all happy to share info, support and advice.\n\nCaitlin: That's exactly what I mean about the hunt: it's all about the journey. One thing you did so beautifully in your talk was give us that \"you are there\" feeling by shooting the interiors. So smart. How did you pull that off?\n\nAnthony: Two local realtors, Leonard Gottlieb and Jesse Berger, arranged for me to gain access to several buildings I was especially interested in, and my singing teacher happened to live in Candela's first project - The Clayton, on 92nd and Broadway - so I had access to that building as well. Everyone was so helpful and committed to letting me into spaces so I could see firsthand what a Candela unit felt like and share it in my talk.\n\nCaitlin: Did you coin “Candela Corners” for our stretch of West End?\n\nAnthony: Yes. When I realized there was such an extraordinary density of Candela-related buildings centered around the intersection of 103rd and West End I jokingly coined it \"Candela Corners\" in passing one day and then realized how apt that nickname was, so I used it in my presentations. Now there's talk that we petition the City to rename that intersection \"Candela Corners\" permanently - which I find very exciting.\n\nCaitlin: What is it like to live in a Candela apartment and what features have been preserved in yours?\n\nAnthony: As fate would have it, 865 is one of the worst-kept buildings on West End Avenue. And so, my unit is more intact than those in many other Candela buildings because so few improvements have been made. Apart from the kitchen (which was thankfully updated prior to my moving in - new sink, new stove, that sort of thing) and some other minor changes, Rosario would have no trouble recognizing his original choices in details. The fact that I've been in the unit for so many years has contributed to its \"preservation\" as well. I've kept the \"remuddler\" at bay all these years.\n\nLong before I knew I was living in a Candela unit, friends and visitors would comment regularly on how my apartment didn't feel like an apartment, but rather, it felt like a home. The layout is gracious, and it's easy to live in the unit and feel comfortable. And I love the wonderful single-paneled doors, the oversize crystal doorknobs, the high ceilings, the gorgeous oak parquet flooring and the gracious moldings throughout - elegant without being fussy.\n\nAlthough it was an \"accident\" that I moved into a Candela unit, one could argue it wasn't. Of all the apartments I saw when apartment-hunting, the one I chose simply stood out from all the rest. It was that \"Candela magic\" I guess.\n\nCaitlin: Yes, maybe it was destiny or maybe as Louis Pasteur said \"Chance favored the prepared mind.\" As you know, I’ve also been a lover of Bloomingdale history having researched 855 WEA which preceded 865 by roughly 30 years. I have a soft spot for the intersection of W. 102nd Street and West End because so many different eras are represented just at this crossroad. I know you are a Candela groupie, but what’s your second favorite building at or near this intersection?\n\nAnthony: LOL! You're assuming a Candela building is my FIRST favorite building! I can't really rate them numerically but I, too, am enamored of the 102/WEA intersection. Just to name a FEW of my local faves:\n\nI love the Ralph Townsend House (link above) at 302 W. 102nd because of its charm, its antiquity (built in 1884, it's the oldest house in the vicinity) and its unique history of having been built first on West End and later lifted and moved around the corner to 102nd as you recount in your talk and blog post - to make room for your beloved 855! I'm very fond of the Dewey at 850 West End because of the truly unique carved details on the building - take a look at the supports under the bay windows - one has a bird being stalked by two cats, and another has two monkeys fighting over a pineapple - not to mention the portrait of Admiral Dewey on one of the buildings cartouches.\n\n858 WEA is outstanding as well - that wonderful tower serving as an exclamation point on the corner of 102nd and West End (I hear tell there's a Mary Pickford/Douglas Fairbanks connection to this building) and across the street those wonderfully ornate window surrounds on the 102nd St side of 860 WEA... and as I walk home from the 103 St subway station I always delight in the fanciful carvings in the row of brownstones, one of which was Humphrey Bogart's birthplace.\n\nSo, honestly, I can't pick a \"favorite\" building - I simply revel in the richness of the architecture on our blocks. It lifts my spirits and elevates me above the everyday stresses of life.\n\nCaitlin: I completely concur. I also love 858. It reminds my partner of the building near City College on Convent Avenue that was a main character in the film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\". And how funny it would be to have a Mary Pickford connection directly across from 855. In 1915, Pickford made the film version of \"Fanchon the Cricket.\" It was Maggie Mitchell's stage presence in the play decades earlier that made her wealthy and enabled her to build 855 in 1895. So it would be ironical to trace them to living quarters directly opposite one another...if only for an afternoon delight in Pickford/Fairbanks case. We'll have to dig on that to see if Pickford and Mitchell crossed paths on West End.\n\nOf the Candelas on WEA, which is your favorite?\n\nAnthony: THAT is a REALLY TOUGH question - but I think I would have to pick 875, on \"Candela Corner\" per se. That lobby simply can't be beat - and the apartments are laid out really well, in Candela's mature style - so I suppose, if wrestled to the mat, that would be my fave. But honestly, I love 'em ALL!\n\nCaitlin: I can hear all my friends in that coop swooning with pride. It is a fabulous lobby which you can't quite tell from the little entry.\n\nWhat is Candela’s biggest legacy to the city and to New York living?\n\nAnthony: Rosario Candela showed us that a skilled architect, with the proper training and perspective, could create spaces that are gracious, easy to live in, and that contribute to a positive experience while living in a large, multi-unit building in a dense urban environment in a building which could still be economical to build. He laid out his rooms in the way people live best. I'm sorry to say his was an approach that ended with the collapse of the economy in the 1930s. When development resumed after WWII it was largely \"pack 'em in as tight as you can, give 'em as little as possible, and charge 'em through the nose.\" I feel truly fortunate that I lucked into a Candela apartment.\n\nCaitlin: What’s your next research project?\n\nAnthony: I actually don't have anything in the pipeline right now. I just completed a series of three documentary-style videos for the Merchant's House Museum - on its architecture, and its furniture and lighting collections - that have left me exhausted. But you're not the first person to ask me this. It has crossed my mind that Candela's mentor, Gaetan Ajello, might be a really interesting project, and I've become very aware of just how important the Paterno Brothers were for the development of the Upper West Side, Bloomingdale and Morningside Heights. Potentially there are really interesting stories there. But I have not committed to anything at the moment.\n\nCaitlin: What’s the best and worst kept secret about Bloomingdale?\n\nAnthony: I'm sort of sorry to say the formerly best kept secret about Bloomingdale is now the worst kept secret: that is what a GREAT part of Manhattan this is to live in. It used to be \"you live all the way up THERE?!\" which has now changed to \"Oh wow - you live up THERE?! It's really NICE up there!\" I'm afraid our secret's out....\n\nCaitlin: Yeah, I used to get that all the time. As the song in \"Hamilton\" goes: \"You don't know til you know...\" So to loop back, I guess Maggie Mitchell was ahead of the game when she sunk her flag here and built our first 'high-rise' -- The St. Andoche -- at 855 West End. It was only a matter of time before Candela and other architects of the \"grande dames\" of West End caught on with the subway opening things up.\n\nThanks for sharing all this with me. I hope readers will tune in tomorrow for the video of your talk.\n\n​\n\nDon't miss our news!

Version 2.019. Today has me thinking about Independence Days Gone By. An America that preceded this America. One of nostalgic childhood memories of fireflies in the backyard and 'Our Bicentennial' fireworks on the great DC Mall -- and the colossal city-wide traffic jam that ensued. Three quarters of a million folks showed up for the fireworks and the Boston Pops under Fiedler's baton (lagniappe embedded below -- click on the post title to see the video and see if it doesn't stir you when the audience rises one by one to their feet to the rousing trills and flourishes of piccolos and flutes). Here, there was the incredible spectacle of the tall ships in New York Harbor dubbed by Abe Beame \"the most magnificent and glorious display of maritime splendor of th[e] century.\" Barkers dressed as colonial town criers and and hawkers on stilts with outsized Uncle Sam top hats milled around the foot of the Trade Center towers promoting the birthday events. Americans were spurred on to engage with this national event. Two hundred years young with Vietnam and Tricky Dick in our rearview mirror, we were scarred, socially shaken, but looking ahead; the country was dusting itself off and ready for the party, proud of the democracy that we were rebuilding in a new image of cleaner politicians, of inclusion, and of opportunity. Standing in front of Independence Hall that fourth, President Ford (in an address that I urge you to watch for how is resonates two score later--also embedded below) heralded \"the two great documents that continue to supply the moral and intellectual power for the American adventure in self government.\"\n\nFord made the most of the birthday celebrations in '76, a hotly contested campaign year. A bizarre if not utterly opportunistic example early on in the year of how his administration maximized the occasion was how he handled the appearance of one sole case of swine flu at Fort Dix in New Jersey. For health authorities at the CDC, the case set off a group-think panic that the 1918 flu was back. At the time, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld were padding around the west wing as Ford's trusty advisors. With Ronnie Reagan nipping at Ford's heels in the GOP primaries coupled with a young, idealistic peanut farmer on the rise on the left, the White House signed on to the notion that a vaccination campaign was immediately in order to combat the specter of flu that could fell Americans left, right and center. Heaven forfend on our birthday Americans dropping like flies. From a draft memo I once dug up in the Atlanta branch of our national archives, the Ford Administration's health officials argued in favor of a rapid intervention: \"undertaking the [Swine Flu vaccination] program in this manner provides a practical, contemporary example of government, industry, and private citizens cooperating to serve a common cause, an ideal way to celebrate the nation’s 200th birthday.\" (Emphasis mine).\n\nJust think about that especially in light of the measles recently! Vaccinating citizens to celebrate the bicentennial. Hard to make this up!\n\nBut the strategy behind the strategy was one -- likely concocted by Cheney -- akin to a Rose Garden offensive: keep Ford's name in the newspapers all year long with this great vaccination campaign and the birthday appearances, and he'd sail through as a strong, protective, patriotic leader of our nation, and twinkletoe his way in to a November '76 victory (not his normal mode of bipedality!). For the flu campaign, he even coaxed arch enemies and heroes Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, of polio vaccine fame, to a détente and enlisted their help in advocating for the flu shot program and branding it for the nation. (That's a whole long story in and of itself). Out of nowhere, cases of so-called Legionnaire's disease showed up in Philly in July 1976 -- the place and date chosen by the American Legion to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Cases of the illness that struck convention goers were immediately mistaken for Swine flu as the symptoms are similar, and with this scare, health authorities were eventually able to connive and jackhammer away the legal roadblocks to Ford's national flu vaccination campaign.\n\nOf course this whole strategy failed spectacularly for reasons I will write about another time, the primary one being there was in fact no pandemic at all. The fiasco came to be known as \"The Swine Flu Affair.\"\n\nFord lost. Carter won. Reagan was but four years stalled.\n\nAll this -- and so much more -- came galloping back to me with the fabulous archival footage in Martin Scorsese's new Netflix film \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" -- a mixed-up, crazy quilted, unreliably-narrated, utter joy of a romp back to 1975 and 1976.\n\nIf you do yourself and loved ones a single good deed to celebrate our nation's birthday this week, fire up Netflix and watch this gorgeous, lush \"documentary.\"\n\nYou see, Bob Dylan, too, had a vision for our nation's 200th. He, too, had been watching our leaders with cold eyes during Vietnam and Watergate. He, too, had yearned to see a better nation reboot. And reappearing after a multi-year, self-imposed fame detox, he'd conjured a traveling road show with his friends. An ideal way to celebrate our nation's 200th birthday!\n\nThis post was triggered by the visual seen on Broadway above. It is a shot in front of Lincoln Center earlier this month when the Scorsese film premiered. The Rolling Thunder Revue tour, mysteriously mythic for fans, was equally mythic for those musicians and artists who rode shotgun with the bard for its first leg up and down the northeast corridor, dipping into Canada. The Rolling Thunder caravan first put down stakes in Plymouth Rock for goodness's sakes. From there, a quick stop in Lowell, Massachusetts, paid homage to Jack Kerouac, natch. By day, Dylan and Allen Ginsberg made a pilgrimage to the grave to sit and wonder a while. By night, the roving gypsies became a possessed musical ensemble, jamming for four hours a show.\n\nVignettes -- some true, some conjured -- abound in the Scorsese film. Sam Shepard lured in Joni Mitchell who then wrote \"Coyote\" in reply. Virtuoso and tour-sound-defining violinist Scarlet Rivera had a sword fetish, or did she? Joan Baez donned a fedora and painted her face white in a commedia dell'arte tradition and was mistaken for Dylan by the roadies. The tremendous talent, Roger McGuinn of Byrds fame, took the stage with Bob in the most intense and eye-talking duet you'll ever see. And that first leg of the tour all culminated just on the eve of the bicentennial year at Madison Square Garden for the epic \"Hurricane\" concert with Muhammad Ali present to bless the cause of justice for the 'Hurricane'. Through their eponymous song, Jacques Levy and Bob Dylan brought the plight of falsely-accused boxing champ Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter to the attention of the country. The song itself is a film -- an economically-written poem set to music whose narrative flickers through your mind with all the real-life characters and racists in full flesh.\n\nI know that fireworks and picnics and bbqs and even the occasional military parade are the more traditional nods to national holidays. But by the time you've read this, it will already be the 5th. So treat yourself to streaming this film, and walk back in time with me to our bicentennial to think about all that has come since.\n\nThe best possible way to end this is in the words spoken by Allen Ginsberg at the end of the film musing on the raucous, joyful road trip and its ragtag ensemble:\n\n\"Take from us some example. Try to get yourself together, clean up your act, find your community. Pick up on some kind of redemption of your own consciousness, become more mindful of your own friends, your own work, your own proper meditation, your own proper art, your own beauty. Go out and make it for your own eternity.\"\n\nIn four sentences, Ginsberg redeemed himself forever for me. And how timeless these words are.\n\nReaders, this is your community at a time we truly need one. The Block Association is a perfect example of what the Beat poet spoke. I know this was a long, winding way to get here. And don't misunderstand: it's still a great idea to get your vaccinations. But these were the thoughts jangling in my mind on the morning of July the fourth in the year two thousand and nineteen.\n\n​Happy 243rd to U.S. all. And here's to a more perfect 'union' built together.\n\nI couldn't find the clip with Ginsberg, but above is a whistle-wetter for the film of Dylan singing \"One More Cup of Coffee.\" For those reading this in an email subscription, click here for the video above, here for the Fiedler video below and here for the Ford address at bottom with a great look at the tall ships of OpSail 1976.\n\n​\n\nDon't miss a post!
