For more than three decades, Cirrito welcomed refugee families from all over the world into her home and helped them establish in the Greater Lansing area.\n\nAs a descendant of survivors of the 1915 Armenian Genocide, Cirrito’s commitment to helping those in need was ingrained in her. In 1992, as Armenians were displaced by the Nagorno-Karabakh war, Cirrito founded the Armenian Resettlement and Refugee Assistance Trust Fund using her resources, and time. She worked closely with St. Vincent Catholic Charities to secure opportunities for the new arrivals. Cirrito also facilitated employment, education, transportation, and medical care, setting the stage for success and integration into the Lansing community.\n\nWhat truly sets Cirrito apart is her ability to remember and celebrate the milestones of each person she has helped. Her commitment to the well-being and growth of these individuals is a testament to her dedication and care. As the Armenian American community flourished under Cirrito’s guidance, her efforts continued to expand; more than 90 percent of the refugees she assisted purchased homes, opened local businesses, and provided employment opportunities to other community members. Cirrito s influence has rippled through generations, as young Armenian Americans achieve academic, artistic, and athletic success on national and international stages.\n\nCirrito’s profound service has not gone unnoticed by her community. Her selflessness and generosity have garnered deep respect and gratitude from everyone she has helped. The Armenian American community stands united in support of her nomination, echoing sentiments of appreciation for her dedication and life-changing work.\n\n“Helen Cirrito is an amazing woman who cherished all of us as her own family and gave us another chance to build a new life in America and succeed. She is worthy of hundreds of awards and recognitions, but she never sought or expected anything in return for all her hard work,” said Asya Vardanova, a member of the Lansing Armenian community. “We are all forever grateful for everything she has done for our entire community.\"\n\nCirrito’s legacy is one of unwavering compassion, boundless dedication, and a resounding belief in the potential of every individual to thrive. Her lifetime achievement of saving lives, creating opportunities, and fostering unity is a shining example of how one person's actions can truly make a profound and lasting impact.\n\nLifetime Humanitarian Award\n\nAn individual or family that has demonstrated a lifetime of outstanding civic and charitable responsibility to communities and organizations.\n\nRoland Hwang\n\nNorthville\n\nRoland Hwang has exemplified an unwavering dedication to serving his community, fueled by a belief in justice, equality, and social progress for all. Hwang's remarkable service history spans multiple decades and organizations, leaving a lasting mark on Michigan's civic landscape.\n\nAfter first visiting in 1954 at the age of 5, he has contributed 25,000 volunteer hours to the International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit. The group was founded in 1919 by volunteers who sought to help legal immigrants learn English, appreciate freedom and democracy, become citizens, be assimilated into their communities, and learn to understand each other's cultures. Hwang has been on the board since the mid-1980s and has twice served as president.\n\nHwang’s service demonstrates his hands-on approach to community building. During his ongoing involvement with the American Citizens for Justice he has held pivotal positions within the organization, including president, vice president, and chair of the Attorney Committee. Roland's influence also extends to the Michigan Roundtable for Diversity and Inclusion, New Detroit, and the United Way of Southeastern Michigan.\n\nIn the legal realm, Hwang's contributions have been monumental. His involvement in the State Bar of Michigan's Public Outreach Committee led to significant legal milestones. Moreover, his leadership roles in the Michigan State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights shed light on critical civil rights and social justice issues. He is a life member of the State Bar Foundation. Furthermore, he uses his influence to advocate for Asian Americans and minority groups. His role on the Michigan Governor's Advisory Council on Asian-Pacific American Affairs has allowed him to offer invaluable insights and contribute to special projects and events that addressed community needs. Hwang’s impact was also felt through his leadership as secretary and President of the Association of Chinese Americans. He has also served in various positions for the Association of Chinese Americans and OCA Asian Pacific Advocates. As part of the Attorney General's Hate Crime Prevention Task Force, he has researched Michigan's provisions for the prevention of crimes against the properties and persons of ethnic and racial minority backgrounds. On a national level, he has dedicated time to the National Asian-Pacific American Bar Association as Central Region Governor and played an instrumental role in the Michigan Asian-Pacific American Bar Association, serving as its President in 1985. His impact extends beyond civic and legal domains to education as well. He has served as both President and Vice President on the Northville School Board, overseeing the education of thousands of students and teachers.\n\nRoland Hwang's lifetime of service, spanning across decades and organizations, demonstrates the impact service can have on a community. His hands-on approach and contributions to the legal realm have driven profound change and illuminated crucial issues. Hwang's legacy is one that showcases the potential of individual action to transform lives and communities.\n\nExcellence in Philanthropy\n\nA foundation or organization that has demonstrated outstanding civic and charitable responsibility to communities.\n\nGilbert Family Foundation\n\nDetroit\n\nDan and Jennifer Gilbert believe that big problems require big solutions. This belief informs both their commitment to curing neurofibromatosis (NF) and building opportunity and equity for Detroit residents. They established the Gilbert Family Foundation in 2015 to advance groundbreaking, cutting-edge NF research and are focused on supporting the best ideas, no matter how radical they may seem at first. Dan and Jennifer’s commitment to NF research began when their oldest son, Nick, was born with NF1. Nick passed away in May 2023, but his optimism and passion continue to inspire this work each day. The Gilbert Family Foundation has made more than $54 million in NF1 investments.\n\nDan and Jennifer’s commitment to building opportunity and equity for Detroit residents is rooted in their love and long-time passion for their hometown. Through Dan’s “For More Than Profit” philosophy, the Rocket Community Fund, the philanthropic partner of Rocket Companies, and the Gilbert Family Foundation committed $500 million over 10 years to Detroit through investments in organizations and programming that help achieve greater housing stability, educational attainment, and economic mobility for every resident.\n\nThe Gilbert Family Foundation and Rocket Community Fund’s commitment to their home city builds on a decade of impactful investments, including the historic decision to relocate the Rock Family of Companies to downtown Detroit in 2010.\n\nThe organizations have recently launched initiatives to assist minority contractors with access to capital, provide homeowners with funding to make critical home repairs, assist renters facing eviction with obtaining counsel, give startups access to funding and mentorship programming and more. The Rocket Community Fund additionally manages team member volunteerism and engagement for the entire Rock Family of Companies and works alongside dedicated partners to bridge Detroit’s digital divide.\n\nFred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation\n\nBirmingham\n\nTogether, Fred and Barbara Erb’s collective passions and values inform the funding strategies of the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation. Established in 2007, the Foundation has a mission of advancing an environmentally healthy and culturally vibrant metropolitan Detroit and a flourishing Great Lakes ecosystem. Their funding supports urban and agricultural runoff reduction, Great Lakes stewardship, environmental health and justice, sustainable business, jazz education, arts, and — in recognition of Fred’s hard-fought battle at the end of his life — Alzheimer’s research. The Erbs believed that the key to creating a better world for both current and future generations is working collaboratively and respectfully together to make wise and compassionate decisions to achieve meaningful and lasting change.\n\nFred and Barbara’s desire to create a better world, paired with their successful family business experience, shared love of the outdoors, and deep sense of fairness and justice, naturally led them to view their philanthropy through the lens of sustainability – development that harmonizes economic, environmental, and social interests in order to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future. The Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation has become the legacy of the life they lived and the result of their desire to make an impact in Michigan and beyond.\n\nHaving both been born and raised in metro Detroit, Fred and Barbara Erb knew the value of the Great Lakes to their beloved city. Barbara’s admiration of nature began as a young child spending summers in Bayfield, Ontario on Lake Huron with her family. As an adult, she became passionate about organic gardening and wholesome eating — teaching others the importance of growing their own food, supporting local farmers, recycling and other environmentally friendly practices.\n\nFred traveled as a young adult, canoeing at Camp Temagami in Ontario, studying engineering in Upstate New York and serving in the United States Army. While stationed near New York City, he developed his lifelong love of jazz music. Upon returning to Detroit and joining his family’s lumber company, Fred committed himself to growing a successful sustainable business. By the 1970s, Erb Lumber became the largest lumber supplier in Michigan.\n\nSince 2007, the Foundation has made more than $150 million in grants to hundreds of organizations.\n\nSpirit of Hope\n\nIndividuals serving as a beacon of hope for many and one who lifts up others and inspires people to make a difference.\n\nJohn Zaretti\n\nDetroit\n\nDuring the last 35 years, John Zaretti has volunteered countless hours as the President of the Verdi Opera Theatre of Michigan to promote goodwill and friendship among all people through music for everyone’s enjoyment and cultural enrichment. He organized many concerts, presentations, exhibits, and lectures on opera and collaborated with various organizations including the Detroit Institute of Arts, the University of Michigan School of Music, Detroit Opera House, the Dante Alighieri Society of Michigan, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada, and many others. Most notably, he brought the La Scala Instrumental Ensemble of Milan, Italy, and the Parma Opera Ensemble from Parma, Italy, to perform concerts with the Michigan Opera Theatre. He has worked hard to infuse others with his enthusiasm and passion for opera and classical vocal music as he helped provide cultural entertainment at the Canton International Fest, Livonia Symphony Orchestra, Wayne County Parks and Recreation, Livonia Italian American Club, Italian-American Cultural Center, Saginaw Museum of Art, Detroit International Institute, Dearborn Symphony Orchestra, Michigan Philharmonic Orchestra, Birmingham-Bloomfield Symphony Orchestra and more. Zaretti, 82, also has given young singers numerous opportunities to sing publicly and worked with musical professionals to mentor them. Zaretti instituted an annual Italian Songs and Arias Vocal Competition for Michigan high school students, now in its 29th year. The winners and finalists receive cash prizes to help further their post-high school educations. Several winners and finalists of this competition are now performing with major opera companies, including New York's Metropolitan Opera House and Milan's La Scala, as well as working as musical professionals outside of opera. This competition inspired Detroit icon and opera trailblazing tenor George Shirley to create the George Shirley Vocal Competition for African American Vocal Repertoire for high school and college students, where Zaretti has served as one of the distinguished judges from its very beginning.\n\nZaretti’s life work has resulted in several awards, with the highest honor being awarded by the Italian government with the distinction of Cavaliere of the Order of Merit (Knight of the Order of Merit), an honor bestowed by decree of the President of the Italian Republic. Zaretti has shown a tireless commitment to bringing opera to the forefront and is influential in inspiring young singers to pursue a career in music.\n\nTracy Edwards\n\nLansing\n\nTracy Edwards serves as a catalyst of inspiration for other black women who are considering a career as a physicist. In the near future, Edwards will be one of 150 Black women in the nation to ever be awarded a PhD in physics. She is currently in her third year of a five-year Nuclear Physics PhD program at Michigan State University (MSU), which is the top PhD program for physics in the country. The last time a black woman enrolled in MSU’s PhD physics program was in 1997, which was the year Edwards, 25, was born. Her love for physics began after she learned that the diagnostic test used to identify her brother’s autism was the work of a physicist. The early detection allowed him to get therapy and improve his autism to high functioning. Even with therapy, her brother struggled, resulting in her and her mother spending hours at the library researching Autism. As a result of reading complex material and charting her brother’s progress, Edwards quickly grasped advanced math concepts and excelled academically from her early years in school. At MSU, she thrives academically and is currently engaged with the national research laboratory on campus – the facility for Rare Isotope Beams. Her primary research is focused on creating zinc isotopes that can be used in future medical devices. Outside of the classroom, Edwards supports others to be successful; she is engaged in many of MSU’s diversity initiatives. She volunteers as a mentor for MSU Insight, a program that supports first-generation college students to improve their research, writing, poster presentation, and networking skills. She serves in the Inspiring the Next Generation summer intensive program to expose high school students to advanced physics research and endless career options. Edwards is an active member of MSU’s Physics Graduate Organization where she is responsible for the selection of guest speakers and serves as the host for events. She is the webmaster for the MSU Women and Minority in Physical Sciences. Edwards is also active outside of the university; she serves on the National Society of Blacks in Physics conference committee to ensure workshops are engaging and extended to the local communities. She has been asked by the Michigan U.S. Senators to educate them on the U.S. nonproliferation stance and supporting policies. Edwards has won many awards and received a lot of recognition for her work, but ultimately her goal is to extend the encouragement, respect, and support that she has received from endless resources to others who are following in her footsteps.\n\nJeremiah Steen\n\nDetroit\n\nJeremiah Steen has been advocating for the amplification of youth voices and equitable opportunities for underinvested people in communities since he was in high school. In 2018, Jeremiah became the youngest Jane Goodall Roots and Shoots Fund II National Fellow. In that role, he and Jane Goodall strategically designed systems to amplify youth voices in policy development. Jeremiah, 22, founded the Steen Foundation to allow youth to be engaged in grant-making, tailor their career pathway development, and conduct structured organizational critiques for organizations. The Steen Foundation has provided over 100 youth with paid internships and fellowships in conservation, arts, and culture, along with funding to support a youth mural challenge program. In 2022, Jeremiah was selected to become the youngest trustee at the Skillman Foundation in its 62-year history. In this role, he advocates for the aspirations of Detroit’s youth, especially around future building and the problem of underinvestment in communities and families. The Skillman Foundation, in partnership with the Steen Foundation, developed and executed the Gen-Z Design Sessions project to allow Detroit youth the ability to advise leaders of major organizations. Jeremiah serves on various boards and committees including: Kresge Innovative Projects: Detroit Plus (KIP:D+), Detroit Audubon Society, Friends of the Rouge, The Soul of Philanthropy - Michigan, Association of Fundraising Professionals, Emerging Practitioner in Philanthropy, Life Leaders, and was on the Skillman Foundation’s inaugural President's Youth Council Cohort. He has received various recognitions including: 2023 Michele Corey Child Advocacy Summit Rising Star Award- Michigan's Children, 2022 Sparky Anderson Youth in Philanthropy Award - Association Fundraising Professionals, 2022 Changemaker Award - SEEN, and the 2017 Ernest Loft Junior Goodfellow of the Year Award. Jeremiah Steen has an unwavering commitment to service, advocacy, and justice for all people — especially Michigan’s youth. He is constantly finding new ways to amplify the youth’s voice across multiple industries and support the mobilization of youth power. Jeremiah Steen is a catalyst for ethical leadership, mission-driven fundraising, and sustainable philanthropy. It is his quest to create opportunities to ensure communities receive the resources they need and create a pipeline, which will ensure underinvested people remain at the front lines when working toward justice.\n\nBruce Millan and Barbara Busby\n\n(Posthumously)\n\nIn 1957 Bruce Millan and Barbara Busby founded the Millan Theatre Company, while students at Wayne State University. At that time segregation at theatres was common so Millan and Busby decided to make it their mission to prove the power of diversity acting in unity by casting the best actor for the job regardless of the color of skin, race, or ethnicity.\n\nThe policy was controversial in its time and still is unique today. They were very motivated to support an anti-racist society by bringing together black and white actors to create the touring group that created shows for children.\n\nIn the early 1960s they moved the Theatre to Detroit and gave it a new name – The Detroit Repertory Theatre. They began producing plays for adults and kept the same inclusive casting policy.\n\nTheir production of plays maintained a commitment to stories about racial justice, civil rights, stories of the downtrodden and race transcendent casting. Under their leadership, the Theatre became a home for local artists, underground theatre, local jazz music, and a beacon of light in the community.\n\nNeighborhood residents regarded the theatre a safe place during the 1967 riots, as tanks rolled down the street. Since its beginning until they retired, Millan and Busby were involved in every single performance. Together they developed many programs that had a goal of making Theatre more accessible and reaching the unreached.\n\nBusby and Millan remained dedicated to the theatre for 64 years until 2021, when they retired Busby was 88 years old and Millan was 90. They were both fixtures at the theatre until their death – Busby last August and Millan this February. For 66 years the Repertory Theatre has been a fixture in the community, thanks to the tenacity of Millan and Busby. They never wavered from their belief that theatre should be accessible to all and this effort has made them legends in the Detroit area and the entire country. Their commitment of telling stories about racial justice, civil rights, stories of the downtrodden and race transcendent casting continues today.\n\nHealth Impact Award\n\nMaking an impact on the health and wellness in communities\n\nThe Black Women's Health Initiative (BWHI) is a groundbreaking organization that has worked tirelessly to improve the physical, mental, and financial health of the United States' 21 million Black women and girls. Reproductive and social justice are at the heart of the organization's work in policy, advocacy, education, research, and developing leaders. Byllye Avery, a pioneer in reproductive justice, founded BWHI, which has spent more than $65 million on initiatives to remove barriers to Black women's health over the course of its 40 years. Notably, BWHI launched Fair Work, an evidence-based program that addresses workplace discrimination, and strengthened its Rare Disease Diversity Coalition, which advocates for patients of color who face unique challenges. The organization's impact extends beyond legislative advocacy, with signature programs addressing critical aspects of health and well-being reaching thousands. This year, BWHI celebrated 40 years of impactful work in recognition of its pivotal role in shaping the landscape of Black women's health and well-being.\n\nYouth Volunteer of the Year Award\n\nIndividuals aged 25 and younger who work hard to make an impact in their community through volunteerism. These individuals create solutions to make lives better and demonstrate the spirit of being change makers.\n\nSawyer Hendrickson\n\nLudington\n\nSawyer Hendrickson, 14, began serving veterans at just six years old, inspired by her brother’s enlistment in the Marines Corps. It sparked her desire to support those who sacrifice so much for our country. She started by sending a few dozen care packages to her brother and his fellow Marines. Her efforts then escalated, and she created a nonprofit organization named Miss Sawyer's Kids with A Cause. Sawyer annually delivers over 25,000 care packages and 10,000 filled Christmas stockings to veterans and active-duty military members. In addition, she attends about 100 events a year to show her support for the veteran community by speaking about mental health, homelessness, and the hard transition from military to civilian life. She is an advocate for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action and works closely with Gold Star Families to make sure that their lost loved ones are not forgotten. She also successfully recruits students to engage in service. She is a role model for all ages. Sawyer commits herself to the mission of “Remember, understand, and never forget that our freedom isn’t free.”\n\nSkyler McAlpine\n\nWarren\n\nThrough the first 12 years of his life, Skyler McAlpine faced numerous challenges and experienced 53 different living arrangements including homeless shelters, cars and garages. He finally was adopted but lost the adoptive parent to a battle with cancer, and he was placed back into foster care. Living within the foster care system, he developed an awareness of how dramatically it impacts one’s life, the trauma it can cause, and the importance of having mentors and advocates willing to help. Skyler, 17, appreciates his current adoptive family, as it is with their support that he became the first person in his biological family to graduate from high school. Since then, he has become a certified firefighter and is now working on obtaining his paramedic license. Through the years, Skyler has served numerous hours towards the expansion of the Macomb Foster Closet and has helped children in transitional living by providing his friendship and comfort to those experiencing what he once did. His efforts have benefited over 2,000 children in foster care. He also has served with the Warren Wood Food Pantry and distributed over one million pounds of food to over 28,000 people in need. Skyler has turned victimization on its head, going from a severely abused and neglected child to a community change agent.\n\nVishal Swamy\n\nNovi\n\nVishal Swamy has played a crucial role in promoting STEM education among students in Michigan and nationwide. He established the Michigan chapter of the Shooting Stars Foundation (SSF), which empowers youth to help communities break the cycle of generational poverty through STEM education. Swamy, 15, is currently serving as the SSF National President. He is also the Founder and Chair of the Steward Sustainability Leadership Institute (SSLI) 4-H Club, a platform for youth to engage in environmental projects, promote sustainability, and raise awareness about climate change. As a part of SSLI, he collaborated with the Chief of Environmental Sustainability and Planning for Oakland County Parks to install solar bollards in Michigan. Recently, he served as a speaker, representing SSLI, at the 2023 EGLE Michigan Sustainability Conference and was honored as a 4-H National Youth-in-Action Finalist.\n\nIn addition to his environmental work, he has successfully implemented projects and fundraising efforts in support of healthy living, cancer treatment, and community engagement. Vishal’s story is one of determination, empathy, and a deep-rooted desire to create positive change. He has shown that individual actions can have transformative impacts on communities. Vishal’s passion and leadership will serve as an inspiration to others, reminding us of the power we possess to contribute to a better future.\n\nJulian Morris\n\nSaginaw\n\nJulian Morris has demonstrated a great resolve and determination to make an impact in his community. He lifts the voices of youth and assists them in understanding how they can make a difference. Morris, 16, has done this through his reporting, mentoring and teaching of writing. When he was 13, Morris started a teen magazine during the pandemic named SWAG (Students with A Gift). The goal of SWAG was to give his peers a platform to talk about the pandemic and how it affected them. The magazine has led Morris to be a strong community voice on issues such as education loss, youth mental health and American Rescue Plan Act funding. Outside of SWAG, Morris spends time with various organizations tutoring and mentoring. In the last two years, he has spent upwards of 300 hours volunteering with the Heads-Up Mentoring Program, helping young students learn to read and write. He also serves with Saginaw STEM as a peer mentor on STEM Saturdays, teaches writing workshops at Jessie Rouse Elementary School, hosts a book club at Arthur Eddy Academy, and created an after-school journalism program at Thompson Middle School. His poise, presence, and positive attitude have led to him becoming a great role model in the Saginaw community.\n\nMason Schlafer\n\nNorton Shores\n\nWhen Mason Schlafer joined the Boy Scouts of America, he participated in the popcorn fundraiser and set a goal to sell enough to win a tablet for himself. He did not realize the significance that fundraiser would play in his effort to support his community. Inspired by the success of his sales and his ability to dedicate the funds to needs in his community, he decided to be the nation’s top seller the next year. Mason has been the top Scout for the popcorn fundraiser in the nation five different times. He holds the record for most popcorn sold in a season ($102,209) and is the top all-time seller with over $500,000 in lifetime sales.

This vision drives all acts of service to prioritize relationship building and reflection. Students are constantly put in situations where they interact with those being served and are given time to question the acts of service themselves. Was it the right thing to do? Who did you meet? What is their story? Did you empower those being served? Did you come from a place of privilege? Students are supported in their learning and asked to carry the lessons with them throughout life.

The fund was created after its founder, Dave Aro, experienced the tragic aftermath of the suicide of his neighbor and friend. Distressed by the lack of support for the grieving family, Aro and community members personally financed the necessary cleanup and repairs. This incident propelled Aro and others to explore the prevalence of such situations and advocate for assistance in handling post-suicide issues. With 22 suicides each year in the county, half by firearm, law enforcement officials estimated that half of those families didn’t have the resources to hire a company to clean the scene. Through collaborative efforts with local community leaders, the Suicide Survivors Fund was established. They then identified a state nonprofit, Six Feet Over, to oversee the distribution of funds when needed. Six Feet Over leadership envisions a world free from the pain of suicide loss and strives to offer diverse communities access to resources. The Suicide Survivors Fund has garnered substantial community support, receiving over $40,000 in donations.
