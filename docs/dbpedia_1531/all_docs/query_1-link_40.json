His work is characterized by its play with translucency and opacity, darting between a wide variety of mediums including acrylic paint, glass, and multimedia installations. His abstractions are informed by the conflation of recent and collective memory, as well as everyday life; for example, his freehanded paintings reference his mother’s cheongsams and grapes harvested at only certain times a year in Japan. Taken together, his work probes the possibility of Asian Americanness, or the feeling of belonging amidst feelings of placelessness. As an active member of Godzilla: Asian American Arts Network, Huang has been a key player in broadening opportunities for Asian Americans in the Arts and Asian American activism more broadly.\n\nHis most recent exhibit, Just Between Us, was in partnership with Pearl River Mart and Think!Chinatown, along with Corridor Glance, in partnership with Pearl River Mart, the Asian American Arts Alliance, and Chelsea Market.\n\nOriginally from Mumbai, India, Jainil Mehta is a 24-year-old dancer, choreographer, and is currently freelance teaching, creating and performing across the United States, predominantly New York City.
