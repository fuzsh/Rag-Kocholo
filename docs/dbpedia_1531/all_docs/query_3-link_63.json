        "text": "Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = m c 2 {\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} , which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909). However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.Except for one year in Prague, Einstein lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, during which time he renounced his German citizenship in 1896, then received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900. After being stateless for more than five years, he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. The same year, he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned annus mirabilis (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26. Einstein taught theoretical physics at Zurich between 1912 and 1914, before he left for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\" and recommending that the US begin similar research. This eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon. He signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. He was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner wrote of Einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that \"Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement.\"\n\nBilly Crystal, a versatile actor and comedian, carved out an unforgettable niche in the realm of entertainment with his distinctive performances and unique sense of humor. Born on March 14, 1948, in Long Beach, New York, Crystal's love for performance art was evident from an early age. His father, Jack Crystal, a jazz promoter and producer, played a crucial role in shaping Billy's passion for the arts by introducing him to many influential artists of the era. Crystal's career took off after his breakthrough role on the popular television series Soap, where he played one of the first openly gay characters on American television. This groundbreaking performance paved the way for his subsequent success, establishing him as a fearless and forward-thinking performer. His exceptional talent for comedy was further recognized when he became a cast member on the iconic show Saturday Night Live. However, it is his film career that truly solidified Crystal's place in Hollywood. Notably, he starred in the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally, which has since become a classic. His portrayal of the lovable Harry Burns showcased his ability to balance humor with heartfelt emotion, a trait that has become a hallmark of his acting style. Aside from acting, Crystal also made his mark as a director with movies such as Mr. Saturday Night and Forget Paris. His contributions to the entertainment industry have not gone unnoticed, with numerous nominations and awards, including six Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nBorn Maurice Joseph Micklewhite on March 14, 1933, in London, the man who would become known to the world as Michael Caine has lived a life as rich and varied as the characters he's portrayed on screen. The son of a fish-market porter and a maid, Caine grew up in a working-class family and experienced the hardships of World War II firsthand. He honed his acting skills during his military service in Korea, where he was a part of the Royal Fusiliers. Caine's career breakthrough came with the film Zulu in 1964, where he played Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. His portrayal of the aristocratic officer set him on a path to stardom, and he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces in British cinema. His role in The Ipcress File (1965) solidified his status as a leading man, and over the years, he has been lauded for his performances in classics such as Alfie (1966), The Italian Job (1969), and Get Carter (1971). Caine's talent has not gone unrecognized by his peers. He's a two-time Academy Award winner, earning Best Supporting Actor for his roles in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and The Cider House Rules (1999). But perhaps what sets Caine apart is his longevity and adaptability. He has worked with some of the most respected directors of multiple generations, from Sidney Lumet and John Huston to Christopher Nolan and Steven Soderbergh.\n\nSteph Curry, born as Wardell Stephen Curry II on March 14, 1988, in Akron, Ohio, has become one of the most influential figures in the realm of professional basketball. The son of former NBA sharpshooter Dell Curry, and older brother to fellow NBA player Seth Curry, basketball was embedded into Steph's DNA from an early age. Despite being overlooked by major colleges due to his slender frame, he proved himself at Davidson College, where he led the nation in scoring and was nominated for the John R. Wooden Award during his junior year. In 2009, Curry was drafted as the seventh overall pick by the Golden State Warriors, a team with which he would create a lasting legacy. His uncanny shooting accuracy, innovative ball-handling skills, and unmatched court vision revolutionized the game, earning him two consecutive Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards in 2015 and 2016 - the latter being the first unanimous decision in NBA history. Moreover, under his leadership, the Warriors clinched four NBA championships in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022, solidifying their dominance during that period. Off the court, Curry is known for his philanthropy and activism. He established the \"Eat. Learn. Play.\" foundation with his wife Ayesha, aiming to end childhood hunger, ensure access to quality education, and provide safe spaces for children to play and be active. Furthermore, he has been vocal about social justice issues, using his platform to promote change. Beyond athletics, Curry's influence extends to inspiring the next generation with his commitment to community service and his embodiment of the power of resilience and determination."
