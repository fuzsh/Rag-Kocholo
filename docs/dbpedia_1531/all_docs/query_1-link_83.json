He professed a love for Christ at an early age and was baptized at Christ Temple Apostolic Church.\n\nRicky loved and delighted in his children, Little Ricky, now deceased, Kara, and Jessica. For the past 22 years he was devoted to his life partner and best friend, April, who loved him dearly and cared for him during his illness.\n\nRicky held various positions at Greenbriar Rehabilitation, Time Life Distribution, Advanced Marketing Services and Subaru of America from which he retired. Prior to his illness, on any given day you could find Ricky on the bank of a river with a fishing pole in his hand. This pastime was his most favorite hobby and he enjoyed many hours fishing with his big brothers Johnny and Joey. He was also an avid artist. His paintings revealed a distinctive mastery of his craft. His easel was found after his death on which he had written: “One can only appreciate the true meaning of art, if he understands the true meaning of himself.” Ricky was a sharp dresser with a hat for every occasion. In his laid-back reserved manner, he was charming, fun-loving, and could crack a joke with the best of them.\n\nRicky lost his battle with liver cancer, but won his wings on Tuesday, July 9, 2024, at the age of 68 years, 6 months, and 9 days.

She was the 9th child born to Lowell and Grace Sanders Jones. She was the youngest girl and was nick named “Bodie” by her brother Jim Boy because of her pretty bow legs.\n\nShe attended George Washington Carver School #87 from Kindergarten through the 8th grade. She loved her school and the neighborhood that she grew up in. Life long friendships were formed on 87’s playground. She would many years later organize a reunion committee to celebrate the neighborhood and School #87. The yearly reunions lasted for more than 20 years. It was at #87 that she developed a love for classical music.\n\nBoldie loved the Lord. She grew up in a devout, faith believing home. She attended Grace Apostolic Church Sunday School as a child. What many may not know was that she also attended 25th St. Baptist church Sunshine Band, BTU and Vacation Bible School. She said that it was the “snacks” that made her go. She received the “Holy Ghost” at Grace in December 1965 and dedicated her life to God. She sang with the Indianapolis Pentecostal Mass Choir and taught Sunday school. Unfortunately however she had to give up her cheer leading and dreams of becoming a dancer because of the then rigid church rules.\n\nShe married in 1968 and although this marriage was later dissolved she was gifted with her greatest treasure. Her darling son, Thomas Keith who she affectionately called “Tokie”. She was a great mother. She taught him just as she had been taught to believe in God and to love the word of God. Tokie remembered all of the scriptures that he had learned. He took special pride in Genesis 1:28 that read “and God said to them, be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth.” And he did his best blessing her with grandchildren, Amira, Deante, Shamyr, Thomas Keith, Thomys Keith, Tyler Keith, Thomari Keith, Trevon Keith and Christian.\n\nBoldie loved working with children. She was employed at Fahondzi Day care, Noble Center and the Indiana School for the Deaf. She taught herself American sign language so that she could communicate with her students. As she grew stronger in this form of expression she began to experiment with signing songs to music. This was a perfect way for her to pick back up her love for dance. She could use her hands to express in a dramatic fashion the lyrics of the song in a rhythmic sway using American Sign language, which was no different than a operatic diva performing an aria in latin.\n\nBoldie met Frederick Walker in 2014. They were a perfect match! He would become her husband in 2017. The two of them decided to move to Murfreesboro Tennessee. It was their “Shangrilai” They spent 6 wonderful years together.

A gift that came out feet first and ready to walk in her purpose of being the Light of the World.\n\nEdythe’s light was experienced by everyone that had ever crossed her path whether it be from her presence and involvement in her siblingsupbringing; when she walked the halls of Howell High School as one of it’s first African Americans ever to attend; and in the major role she played as mother and grandmother of which she was very protective.\n\nEdythe, named after her grandmother “Edith” was simply the epitome of class, beauty, elegance and excellence in all that she did in life. Her very presence exemplified a dignified grace that engendered a certain contagion that inspired others to look towards her light for guidance. Her delicate attention to detail in providing love and care for her family, her meticulous thoughtfulness in how she presented herself and her home at ALL TIMES.\n\n“Aunt Edy,” as she was affectionally called by her nieces and nephews, look to her as if she was Superwoman, because of the ways she was able to reach them even when their own parents couldn’t reach them.

Fall Creek Parkwaywith visitation there from 3:00-5:00pm\n\nRev. Eugene Wesley Smith\n\nThe Rev. Eugene Wesley Smith entered this world on March 7, 1954 and was received into the loving arms of The Rev. Eugene Smith and Mrs. Norma Marie Fields Smith.\n\nIn II Timothy 4:7-8 (KJV), the Apostle Paul writes “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”\n\nEugene Wesley was a man who left a rich legacy based upon a deep abiding faith. That faith was deeply steeped in lessons taught by example, generosity and love toward the path of oneness with God our Creator, family, and business accomplishments.\n\nEugene Wesley was deeply spiritual in his studies, and shared his knowledge of the revelations God allowed him to discover. He encouraged others to be spiritually grounded and to embrace God’s will for their lives. He always looked for and saw the best in others.\n\nAs the years went by, with much being revealed through the COVID-19 pandemic, wars, violence, and total lack of regard for human life, he taught with a sense of urgency as a “dying man teaching to a dying world.”\n\nFamily was at the center of to Eugene Wesley’s life. His family gave him a sense of foundation and purpose. As a child, he realized he was the answer to his mother Norma Fields Smith’s prayers for a child – much like Hannah, the mother of Samuel in the Bible.\n\nWhen God answered that prayer, Eugene Wesley became the eldest of three siblings born to Mrs. Norma Marie Fields Smith and The Rev. Eugene Smith. There was Eugene Wesley, The Rev. Dr. Ronald Drew Smith and Ms. Robin Smith Nichols.\n\nThese three siblings did everything together. They were each other’s best friends and soul mates. Sometimes they were referred to as the “Three Musketeers.” Like many families with kids growing up through the years, they learned so much about themselves through the sacrificial love made for and with one another.\n\nEugene Wesley never wanted to let anyone down. He was loving, kind, protective, and generous to others.\n\nMost saw Eugene Wesley in his professional and serious mode. Actually, he had funny sayings that would make you laugh so hard that he got tickled and referred to himself, “as Gene Smith, the funny guy.” Hearing his belly laugh would make everyone hysterical – you couldn’t stop laughing at his jokes.\n\nEugene Wesley was a brilliant businessman. He started his career in the steel business at Jones & Laughlin Steel in Indianapolis, IN in the mid 70’s. He learned all the various steel products and rose to become one of the youngest inside sales persons in the company.\n\nEugene Wesley’s career in the steel business soared as a brokerage consultant, taking him to various cities and capacities until he launched his own steel brokerage company. Eugene Wesley learned the highs and lows of the business world, and God blessed him to continue to grow his own company.\n\nIn November 2019, Eugene Wesley started a new company, G S Metals, LLC, in Riverside California. He was excited because this is now a family company and part of his legacy.\n\nEugene Wesley Smith joined his parents as part of the great cloud of witnesses on April 8, 2022 -- twelve years to the date that his father, Rev. Eugene Smith, passed away. He completed his earthly mission on at the age of 68, and took flight from his earthly tent.\n\nHis father was Pastor Emeritus of Christ’s Open Door Baptist Church in Indianapolis at the time of his passing, while Gene was a licensed minister of Christ’s Open Door as well.\n\nEugene Wesley and Leanett Loury Smith were married 40 years when Leanett completed her Earthly mission in July 2021. God blessed their union with three surviving sons — Eugene Loury, Wesley Matthew, and Everett Drew Smith (Mrs. Shannon Shawnte’ Smith Eugene Wesley proudly referred to as “Daughter”).\n\nEugene Wesley also has two surviving sons, Edward Eugene (Angela) and Johnathan Wesley Smith, with his first wife Barbara Ann Anderson.\n\nEugene Wesley loved his children, and his four surviving grandchildren – grandsons Dimitri Akira, Dorian Ascher, and Everett Drew Jr., and granddaughter, Gianna Taylor Smith. His two siblings, The Rev. Dr. Ronald Drew Smith (The Rev. Dr. Angelique Walker-Smith), and Ms. Robin Smith Nichols (Mr. Mark Nichols) survive to carry on his legacy.\n\nEugene Wesley also is survived by a host of family and friends who love him dearly – brothers, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nOscar Thomas\n\nIf there were enough words in our language, we could use this space to make the world realize what a wonderful man, Oscar D. Thomas Sr. truly was. We could explain the impacts he made on all of our lives, and all the ways in which he made lives better for all who knew him. We could begin by talking about his life growing up with five sisters, and his deep love for each of them. Or we could discuss his achievements as an All-Star basketball player and his dreams of playing in the NBA. We could talk about the sacrifices he lovingly made as a parent to all of his children, including step-children that he was a father to as if they were his own. We could linger on the fact that he was the rock of his family, that he worked harder than anyone, and somehow still provided support and guidance that was above what anyone could ever even dream. About how he somehow always had the right words and actions to change any situation. But, sometimes there are just not enough words in any language to express what a wonderful man he truly was. Filled with such honor, dignity and grace, the legend that Oscar leaves behind is unparalleled, and worthy of so much more than words can describe.\n\nThe world was blessed with the birth of Oscar D. Thomas Sr. on May 23, 1960, in Jackson, Mississippi. His late parents, Oscar and Evangelist Ruth Thomas, could not have been more proud of their one and only son. Oscar grew up attending Indianapolis Public School No. 41 and Crispus Attucks High School where he loved to lead his team on the basketball court. He was a man full of integrity, and even made the honorable sacrifice of enlisting in the Marines in order to not only serve our country, but to have the means to take care of his mother's car, which he had accidentally damaged prior.\n\nOscar graciously devoted over 30 years of his life to caring for adults with Autism as a Direct Support Professional for St. Vincent New Hope, where he earned much respect and admiration from fellow colleagues. The level of passionate care, protection and understanding that he gave his patients, set the bar high for anyone following in his shoes. His love of helping others extended far beyond his occupation. Oscar was the type of man who would give a stranger the last bite of food on Earth, even if it meant that he would have none. His caring and compassionate ways were not lost on anyone who crossed his path.\n\nWhen Oscar wasn't working or spending time with family, you could most often find him either watching sports with his friends, or enjoying his old school rides. He loved his Oldsmobile, and over the years, also had Cadillac's and Lincoln's that stole his heart. Full of class and style himself, Oscar loved to drive his old cars and turn heads. He also loved to make people laugh. He was a funny man with a quick-wit who could make a joke about almost anything.\n\nThough Oscar accomplished so much during his life, his greatest legacy is one filled with pride and love; his family. A family-man in every sense of the word, Oscar was the pillar of support, hope, and strength to all who loved him. Oscar was a loving father and step-father to sons; Jerel Dean, Justin Dixon, Sean Dixon, Oscar D. Thomas Jr., and Diah Thomas ; and daughter, Don'ya N. Thomas. In addition to his children, he loved being a grandfather to his four grandchildren; Anthony Moon, Anliyah Moon, Lmyah Moon and Blessyn Moon. He had a special bond that can never be broken with each of his sisters, Patricia Brown-Bacon, Kathleen Cowherd, Jackie Denny and including his two sisters who passed away prior to his death; Judy Last and Sandra Thomas.\n\nWhen Oscar succumbed to cancer on March 17, 2022, in Indianapolis , Indiana, his family and friends were more than devastated. They lost their father, grandfather, brother, friend, and their uncle; but in that moment, they also lost their world, their pillar, their rock, their confidant, their supporter, and the man that made them feel special no matter what.\n\nCelebration of Life service will be held on Saturday, April 2, 2022 at 12:00pm at Resurrection Community Church, 2502 E. 38th., with visitation there from 10:00-12:00pm. Burial will take place at Floral Park Cemetery. Final arrangements entrusted to Ellis Mortuary.\n\nMichael Jones\n\nIf space allowed, we could write about Deacon Jones’s formative years, his school days, and the time he spent in the Marine Corps. We could tell stories of the years he spent raising a family and establishing his place in the world. We could attempt to chronicle the many construction projects that he completed around the city of Indianapolis and beyond – projects that stand as monuments to his skillfulness and talent – which includes the building you’re sitting in today. We could tell you about the many trips that he took to destinations scattered around the globe. We could consider the worldly goods that he amassed and the goals he achieved. But, at the end of the day, Deacon Jones’s greatest legacy is one of faith, family and friendships.\n\nIf you knew Deacon Jones in his early years, you might not have recognized him in his later years. While Deacon Jones was a dedicated, hard-working husband and father, he openly admitted that the “younger Michael” didn’t know how to express love. Deacon experienced a great spiritual transformation while serving as a member of Agape Apostolic Faith Assembly. Guided by the leadership of his gifted pastor, Bishop Burt, and shaped by the influence of his first wife, Sister Jessie, Deacon Jones began a journey of change. After many years of yielding to the life-altering power of the Holy Ghost, Deacon Jones learned how to love well.\n\nDeacon Jones went on to develop rich relationships with each of his children, their spouses,, his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren. He was always present in their lives. He was quick to offer counsel, lend a hand or share a laugh. He fulfilled his God-given role in their lives as only a father can, and for that they are grateful. Because of him, his family can quote the Psalmist who said, “Yea, I have a goodly heritage.”\n\nDeacon Jones was heard to say that God blessed him to hit the marital jackpot twice. After the passing of his first wife, Deacon Jones greatly desired to remarry. When he met Sister Lorine Kelley of Alabama, he knew that she was “the one.” In Sister Lorine, he found a woman who is godly, gracious and kind. She lovingly embraces his family in the same way that he embraced hers.\n\nDeacon Jones was a witness for Christ, and his method was simple. He carried Agape business cards in his wallet and invited people to church whenever he saw an opportunity. He invited waitresses, grocery clerks and bank tellers. In the last week of his life, with a limited ability to speak, he even invited his hospice nurse to come to church. Deacon Jones wanted everyone to know the transforming power of the Holy Ghost. We’re glad you’re here today. In honor of him we’ll ask, if you don’t have the Holy Ghost, will you come back to visit with us this Sunday? In the words of Deacon Jones, “Who wouldn’t serve a God like this?”\n\nDeacon Michael R. Jones, Sr., went to sleep in Jesus on March 6, 2022, with his family by his side. He leaves to cherish his fond memory his wife, Lorine R. Jones; sons, Michael R. (LaShonda) Jones, Jr., Christopher A. (Genevie) Jones; daughters, Michelle D. (Brian) Starks, Joyce T. (Jeremie) Bell, Melissa L. (Jayson) Officer, Courtney M. Orville) Demery; sister, Frances Jones Robinson; 29 grandchildren; 3 great grandchildren; brothers and sisters in love; a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and extended family members and the Agape Apostolic Faith Assembly Church.\n\nCelebration of life services will be held on Saturday, March 12, 2022 at 12:00pm at Agape’ Apostolic Faith Assembly, 6240 Georgetown Rd. with visitation there from 10:00-12:00pm.\n\nCharles R. Hughes\n\nCharles R. Hughes (aka Chip) was born in Indianapolis on October 3, 1939. He was an adventurous child. Many a day, he would be out and about on his tricycle riding through the neighborhood.

Franklin - a tiny little Angel wrapped in a 6 lb. 9oz. 19” long …loud…package with the teeniest feet and hands ever. Looking at her cute little round face absolutely demanded that this precious package be named “Crystal” Rene’ Franklin. She was born articulating what she wanted…and became well known for one who could express herself.\n\nHer four big brothers were mesmerized by this tiny curious human with beautiful big bright eyes - who was continually wrapped in PINK… and they refused to let her sit still long without them - so – at 9 months she shocked the family. She crawled…. up the stairs… and WALKED back down… with a half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in her hand. To this day it has not been determined … whose sandwich she claimed! She was FEARLESS.\n\nCrystal Rene’ Franklin received Christ at a very young age and sang beautifully and faithfully - in all of the church choirs. One of her favorite songs was “Let Go and Let God.” She loved singing with her sisters – while her younger brother played the drums, and her parents played guitars.\n\nCrystal was a sister who took pride in showing her younger sisters “how to be beautiful.” This tenacious Lady was always the daughter who stayed by her Mother’s side and asked, “What do you need me to do Mama?” You could find her instructing the younger children – as well as scrutinizing anyone who wanted to “date” ANY of them.\n\nCrystal excelled in school – often staying on Honor Roll. She started on a path to be an anesthesiologist … and although she changed her profession… she was most often found in managerial positions. She focused on “caring for others.” That type personality is one reason her siblings - lovingly - called her small framed but BIG personality …”Big Mama”\n\nThe insight and abilities Crystal exhibited were always far beyond the normal woman. She was a true “Warrior Woman” who never gave up - making sure to do the best in her power - for her beautiful, beloved children. Her sacrifices to ensure they were safe and cared for - will always be remembered - and their stories will be told over and over and over to her children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews by her parents and siblings.\n\nThis beautiful Woman is the loving Mother of 6 children – Skyler Shanae’, Taylor, Rashaad Lamont, Terrell DeWayne, Mya Angelica, and Nola Blue.\n\nShe is preceded into glory by her baby sister, Cheri Shana’ Franklin and Kevin DeWayne Franklin II. To lovingly and accurately continue her memory - and be a “village” to her children – she is blessed with 9 more protective brothers; Jerry Michael, Joseph Carl, Silas Ray, Abel Lewis, Travis Daye, Christian Isaiah, Solomon Isaac, Noah Abraham and Malachi Elijah… and 4 more sisters; Carianne Elaine, Courtney Joy, Kavina Angelica and Carmen Lorraine…as well as a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nJune Ellis\n\nJune Arnita (Brooks) Ellis was born on July 23, 1972, to Margaret Ann Hines-Brooks (Ellis) and James Ellis, Jr. Her first name was named after her paternal Aunt (Aunt June and her Paternal Grandmother, Arnita Golden Ellis).
