She is now a Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour, working in schools locally in Rotorua. We have two children, our son is almost 21 and is at Waikato Uni in his last year completing his Bachelor of Business, and our daughter is in her last year of high school.\n\nAs a new migrant all those years ago Settlement Support network personally helped me to get started and pointed me in the right direction by introducing me to the New Kiwis program, etc. (conducted by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce). However, I know the migrant journey isn’t an easy one and most new migrants don’t know where to go or who to ask. Therefore, I am all the more passionate about this role as I am now in a position where I can help those who come in to our city to get settled in by being that “go to” person. The Welcoming Communities Coordinator’s role is part of the Thriving Communities group of the Rotorua Lakes Council.\n\nNatalie Paterson\n\nWelcoming Communities Facilitator, Hurunui District Council\n\nAfter spending some time abroad Natalie returned home to North Canterbury about 10 years ago.

She is looking forward to getting started in the Welcoming Communities role which complements the partnerships and networks she has already developed.\n\nNatalie and her husband have travelled extensively, even taking a year off pre-covid to do just that. That experience gave them an opportunity to learn, listen and explore life that was very different to life in NZ. Upon arriving home, they embarked on another adventure converting an old Anglican Church into a home in the Hurunui High Country.\n\nHeather Barnes\n\nWelcoming Communities Coordinator, Marlborough District Council\n\nHeather is from Canada and came to Aotearoa on the working holiday programme as a sea kayak guide 10 years ago.

She has lived the majority of her life in East Africa but was educated in Scotland and New Zealand. In 2018, Heather moved back to New Zealand as a single mother with 3 daughters. Although New Zealand was familiar to her, she was struck by how hard it was to “fit in” for her family. Heather’s role as an ESOL Tutor highlighted the additional struggles for migrants learning an entirely new language and culture. This ultimately led her to become a member of the Welcoming Communities Advisory Group in Central Otago, which has evolved into the role of Welcoming Communities Officer. She continues to work as an ESOL Tutor.\n\nHeather feels so lucky to have work that is meaningful and fulfilling – and to work in a space that aims to breakdown boundaries and build strong, sincere connections.\n\nJess Hurst\n\nConnected Communities Coordinator, Timaru District Council\n\nHe aha te mea nui o te ao?\n\nHe tangata, he tangata, he tangata!\n\nJess is a people person – she thrives on interacting and building relationships with individuals and groups from all walks of life, from all corners of the community.\n\nWith a background in advocacy and communications, along with having strong and trusting relationships in the community, Jess is well-placed to ensure that the Timaru District is a welcoming community.\n\nPrior to working at the council, Jess worked for the local Member of Parliament, providing support and advocacy to constituents and helping them navigate various government agencies.

She started volunteering at her tamariki’s kindergarten and as an ESOL tutor.

She met her now husband while he was on his classic Kiwi OE – working at a ski hill in Canada.\n\nSarah first became invested in making the world a more equitable place while volunteering for the Elizabeth Fry Society – a feminist organisation dedicated to helping women through the criminal justice system. Years spent working hospitality alongside mostly immigrant staff opened her eyes to the automatic privileges given to her due to her Caucasian looks. At a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion conference Sarah learned that diversity without inclusion is tokenism. This insight gave her the determination to leverage her privilege by holding space for others to share their stories and have a voice at the decision table.\n\nHaving spent her first 5 years in New Zealand working in Infrastructure, Sarah is happy to be back in the Community space and to her passion. As New Zealand is the third country she has called home, Sarah is no stranger to the immigrant experience. She understands the intricacies of adapting to her new home while remaining true to her heritage. Thus, she has decided to develop her programme based on a Canadian analogy, describing immigration as a salad bowl. Simply put, people come as all kinds – lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc. Individually we are pretty good, but combined we make for something more vibrant and fulfilling. Yet even when everyone is mixed in, our unique cultural identity remains intact and celebrated.\n\nPartnership websites\n\nMinistry for Ethnic Communities"
