Asya Simon, born and raised in Moscow began painting as a young girl, and from 2008 to 2013 studied at the University of Art and Design in Moscow mastering her talents in both painting and graphic design. In seeking her personal artistic voice, she began to explore contemporary art form, in particular pop art. Here she was able to use her years of classical training, in color, composition and drawing to her advantage, allowing herself the freedom to explore and create her unique artistic expression.

Her creative process is defined by stages; first the composition is worked over until the sketch is finished, then, once satisfied with the result, she begins to paint the original work, specific and singular. Photography is another art form that she has studied and loves, incorporated in her unique pieces. Her use of color is an important element in her creative process, using acrylic, oil paint, medium gels, and varnishes, often mixed with sand, powdered glass and other textural materials to complete the painting.

In her series of portraits of women, Asya focuses on the eyes of her subjects, emphasizing the glance and expression that immediately catches the attention of the viewer, communicating specific emotions of joy, tranquility or sadness and melancholy. The aesthetics of her portraits are important in her presentation of her subjects; she explains in her own words: âeven when the character I am portraying is aesthetically pleasing, I try to beautify even more, emphasizing her personality and individuality as a message to the onlooker.â Married in 2013 in the United States, she continued to create and exhibit her works in group exhibitions and solo shows in the USA, Singapore, England, and China. She is represented in several galleries in Israel where she has lived since 2016 with her husband and two young children near Tel Aviv.
