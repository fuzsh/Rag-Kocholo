On June 9th 1891 - in the small town of Peru, Indiana - the musical genius Cole Albert Porter was born.

Emerging as a brilliant and prolific songwriter ahead of his time, Cole went on to compose over 1500 songs for Broadway productions, movies, and television.

You know his timeless music in an instant: “Anything Goes” - “Begin The Beguine” - “Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall In Love)” - “Don’t Fence Me In” - “Be A Clown” - “Night And Day.” The pop hits of his day have become encyclopedic references in the evolution of music.

Cole lived a life of high-society luxury… and also faced immense personal challenges that would test his spirit. Enduring through the toughest of times, he continued to delight the world with surprising new songs. Cole Porter was laid to rest in Peru, Indiana 1964. His music lives on across the world.

Every year, we honor Cole's legacy during the Cole Porter Festival... taking place on the weekend nearest Cole's birthday of June 9th, in his charming hometown of Peru, Indiana.
