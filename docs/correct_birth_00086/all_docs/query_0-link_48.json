        "text": "Cole Porter was born on June 9, 1891, in Peru, Indiana. His name derived from his parents, Kate Cole and Sam Porter. Kate's father, James Omar (J.O.) Cole, was an influential man both in the community and in Cole's early life. Cole learned piano and violin at age six and began writing his own tunes at the age of ten, which his mother would pay to have published and distributed to friends.\n\nCole wrote the fight song for Yale's football team, as well as musicals for fraternities and the Yale Glee Club performances and the Yale Dramatic Association. He left Yale having written approximately 300 songs and six full scale productions. Cole Porter spent the years immediately after leaving Yale flailing in an unsuccessful Harvard law career. Cole's grandfather J.O., disapproved of men choosing careers in the arts and tried to convince Cole to become a lawyer. Cole eventually moved to the Yale club in New York, and began his music career.\n\nIn 1937, Cole was involved in a horse riding accident and fractured both of legs. This was a personal tragedy for a vain man who placed an enormous value on looks for both social and sexual reasons. He was in the hospital for months, but his mental and physical health waned. It got worse with the eventual amputation of one of his legs. This did not stop Cole from writing music. During this period were Cole's popular songs \"Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love\", \"From Now On\", and \"Get Out Of Town\"."
