        "text": "Dinner and a book is supported by the Rex and Alice, A. Martin Foundation of Elkhart, celebrating the spirit of Alice Martin and her love of good food and good friends.\n\nThe incomparable Cole Porter's songs were the essence of wit and sophistication.\n\nFamously wealthy, his life was marked by tragedy, courage, sorrow and secrecy.\n\nIn Cole Porter, a biography by William McBrien.\n\nLet's meet my guest.\n\nBill Firstenberger.\n\nWhat's up tonight, Bill?\n\nAnything goes today, Gail.\n\nHey, we're ready.\n\nIt's party.\n\nParty, party, isn't it?\n\nOh, it is indeed.\n\nI'm going to be preparing a prawn cocktail with my own homemade sauce.\n\nAnd what are you doing?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nhors d'oeuvres assorti.\n\nAssorted.\n\nAssorted assorted hors d'oeuvres.\n\nSeveral.\n\nWe'll hear.\n\nWe're going to have some lobster, creamed lobster.\n\nWe'll have some sardines.\n\nAnd we're going to have stuffed eggs, deviled eggs.\n\nAnd then we're going to have stuffed potatoes.\n\nSo we're ready to party, aren't we?\n\nOne more thing.\n\nYes.\n\nPop the cork s'il vous pla√Æt.\n\nLet's get this party started.\n\nI tell you, this we're way behind in Cole Porter's arrangements.\n\nBut, you know, this I found was a very interesting book.\n\nAnd to think this man came from Peru.\n\nOr do they really say Peru?\n\nI think they do say Peru.\n\nSome folks do there.\n\nAt least I've met some.\n\nGosh, night and day they say Peru.\n\nBut, you know, you have me on with some regularity because we're talking about hoosier writers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo today we switch things up a little bit.\n\nWe're talking about a hoosier songwriter.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Great American Songbook and Cole Porter being a part of that.\n\nSo we couldn't pass that up.\n\nNo, he is he's a gem of the of America.\n\nAnd what I discovered, too, were these this life in which he hey, there was a lot of that in his life wasn't there.\n\nWas a lot.\n\nOf a lot of popping of corks and cocktails and, you know, we found we learned a lot about him that maybe he didn't know before.\n\nWhat was his family like, his life in Peru?\n\nWell, he came from wealth.\n\nThat's that's really one of the most important things to to recognize and think about is that he came from a family of means and that also his grandfather, who I think was the initiator of most of that wealth, didn't always approve of everything that Cole wanted to do with his music career and his personal life.\n\nAnd he had no problem keeping grandpa in the dark.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd it was probably good for him to keep him in the dark because he did have kind of a dark life.\n\nWe should start with a toast.\n\nTo Cole Porter.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd yes, absolutely.\n\nTo our to our home guest.\n\nWe're so glad you're here for the opening of Anything Goes, which I think was one of his most popular.\n\nIt plays.\n\nThat's not a play.\n\nMusical musicals.\n\nYes.\n\nWell, that song really defined the jazz era in the jazz age.\n\nDidn't it?\n\nThere were breaking of norms and so many different revolutions and things happening in the world and in America and in popular culture.\n\nAnd Cole Porter just kind of stepped right into that doorway and, you know, put, put songs by it, put it to music.\n\nYou that's very well said.\n\nYou know, this starts in the twenties.\n\nHe was born 1891.\n\nIn the twenties, he starts writing, plays, musicals.\n\nBut before let's let's go back to he has his life in Indiana.\n\nIt doesn't say too much about his life.\n\nIt talks a little bit about his family.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd his mother.\n\nHe adored his mother and she adored him.\n\nShe kind of went around the grandfather and we don't hear much about the father.\n\nOh, that was a devil.\n\nMay care.\n\nWell, okay.\n\nWhat I'm doing is we're we're going to be doing our prom cocktail.\n\nYou know, you can buy it in the store in the frozen section, and it's already precooked and it looks so beautiful and nice, those prawns.\n\nBut I think that that I wanted to go the next step.\n\nSo we got the raw prawns okay and we're going to show how you cook raw prawns into a prawn cocktail.\n\nAnd believe me, it's so much better.\n\nYou're going to love it.\n\nI'll be the judge of that?\n\nSo I just put in half a lemon and I'm going to put in about, oh, a teaspoon or so of I like Himalayan salt.\n\nOh I do too.\n\nAnd just a few peppercorns.\n\nYou don't have to really.\n\nThat's enough.\n\nYou just knock seven or eight, whatever.\n\nSmell that.\n\nSo now we want to bring this to a rolling boil.\n\nA rolling boil.\n\nAnd while we're waiting for that to roll and boil, I just wanted to say that his mother wants him to go to a finishing school, not a finishing school for girls, but a private school.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd he goes to Worcester and he's there and and then he goes off to Yale right now where.\n\nHe writes 300 songs.\n\nYeah, hundred songs.\n\nAnd his four years at Yale.\n\nAnd you know, it really changed his life.\n\nBut what was the key ingredient that pushed him always into the public eye, into a party?\n\nAnd he became the focal point at the piano?\n\nOh, yes, of course.\n\nWell, the the instrument of composition and and music writing.\n\nAnd so he was a natural.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe would just go right to the piano and everybody knew him.\n\nHe became instantly, instantaneously popular on both schools.\n\nHe wrote he wrote a couple of school songs for Yale that they.\n\nTheir fight.\n\nSong.\n\nYeah.\n\nThey started in something called Bull or something.\n\nIt's another Right, right.\n\nAnother song they sang.\n\nWell, he was very interested in doing all these plays with his friends.\n\nSo there were very some very famous people that went to school with him.\n\nThere was, let's see, there was Clifton Webb and who?\n\nWell, let's see, um, Archibald MacLeish and Dean Acheson.\n\nHe was Secretary of State.\n\nSo he met these people.\n\nAnd of course, he drew everybody in with his personality and his singing and his piano playing.\n\nSo whose.\n\nNaturalism.\n\nIt was?\n\nCharisma.\n\nCharisma?\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nYou want to talk a little bit about when he then was encouraged to go to law school by his grandfather?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nWell, he said, sure, I'll.\n\nI'm not I did.\n\nThat and wasn't too excited.\n\nBut he told his grandfather that he was going to law school.\n\nHe enrolled for a little while in his professors at Harvard Law School.\n\nSuggested that he study music.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nMusic was his thing and he'd be quite good.\n\nAnd he changed.\n\nHe changed, unbeknownst to his grandfather, who was footing the bill, kind of released his law coursework and went into music, and his grandfather was none the wiser.\n\nWell, and he studied composition and he studied all kinds of technical things.\n\nAnd, you know, so he gets to law school and he starts composing and his his musicals get on Broadway.\n\nAnd three of the people who always seem to appear in his plays are Ethel Merman, Bert Lahr, Bob Hope.\n\nAnd I don't know who the other one was.\n\nJimmy Durante.\n\nSo I think they were kind of what what would you call that kind of music in play?\n\nIt was kind of corny.\n\nYeah.\n\nPop culture.\n\nI think that was another reason why his grandfather did not approve of his music career was because you know, this is like being a rock star, you know?\n\nOh, it wasn't serious enough.\n\nIt was something that just wasn't viewed as being a worthwhile.\n\nYes, you're going to be a musician.\n\nFrom Wealth and Means.\n\nYes.\n\nHere are my raw, uncooked prawns, and I've turned the water off and so I'm just going to run.\n\nWell, he's doing that.\n\nI'm making my deviled eggs.\n\nSo just ask any of these guys.\n\nAnd it's very important that the water is off and often going out on your own.\n\nNo oh thank you.\n\nAll right.\n\nAnd then you cover it and we wait.\n\nAnd it's very important that you don't keep the prawns on heat or continue to let them boil.\n\nJust let them cook in the hot water off three or 4 minutes.\n\nRight.\n\nFor that's many probably about six or seven.\n\nAt the most.\n\nWe don't want them to turn to rubber.\n\nThat's what happens if you overcook shrimp.\n\nBut if that happens today we will not say a word.\n\nIt will be perfect prawn.\n\nPerfect prawns.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I am making some hors d'oeuvres And since I don't have any caviar, I'm chopping up some black olives to make them look like caviar.\n\nAnd then I have little circles of green olives, and I like that.\n\nAnd I am just getting a little bit of water together and some more ice, because after the prawns are cooked, we're going to put them into an ice bath.\n\nAll right?\n\nAnd that's the part of the to to kind of seal in the juices and and keep them tender.\n\nAnd to stop cooking.\n\nTo stop.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nAll of that.\n\nOkay.\n\nI've started on my my deviled eggs with my faux caviar and some green olives and here's some lobster with some crackers here.\n\nOh, and that's divine over here.\n\nAnd since this is just opening cans, I didn't go fishing for them.\n\nI just decided to put them out and let them saturate the studio with the aroma of oysters and sardines.\n\nSo you are going.\n\nYou're preparing the bath.\n\nLook at that.\n\nYeah, that.\n\nbowl is with.\n\nNeed a little more water.\n\nA little more water.\n\nOkay, So he.\n\nHe doesn't quite flunk out of law school.\n\nHe's starting to.\n\nHe's starting to compose, and he's composing many naughty songs that he loves to sing at private parties.\n\nAnd it's a little bit like Dorothy Parker and her group at the Algonquin.\n\nI mean, they they were more snide and sarcastic.\n\nThese are kind of funny, but they do get a little over the top now.\n\nWe're going to just take a minute so your prawns.\n\nThrough the ice bath.\n\nAnd then when we come back, I'll be doing my sauce.\n\nAnd we're going to do a list of the productions, the most famous productions of Cole Porter.\n\nAnd we'll be right back.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nWe're still preparing for our big party tonight.\n\nWe are indeed.\n\nBut look at that.\n\nThe prawns have cooked and it's time to put them into their ice bath.\n\nIce.\n\nThey had ice bath.\n\nAnd what does that do?\n\nIt kind of seals in the juices.\n\nSo they they don't continue to cook and they don't get rubbery, like you said.\n\nSo I'm just going to continue to fish these guys out and then I'll do that to start on my sauce.\n\nYou know, I like that idea of putting a lemon in there, half a lemon while you're cooking and that extra.\n\nWell, I'm going to use the lemon on my final.\n\nIs this a Firstenberger?\n\nNow I wish I could say it was, but no, I learned how to do this.\n\nIt's now it's not a developed skill.\n\nOkay.\n\nI think we have them all.\n\nYou've got them.\n\nAll right?\n\nYou do what you need to do.\n\nAnd I just want to say I'm cutting some more.\n\nI cooked boiled, some little potatoes, marbles, and I always cut down a little bit off the bottom because you don't want it tipping and falling over.\n\nSo I will do some more of the cheese and I am using a set cheese.\n\nNormally I'd use sour cream, but I thought, let's do something different.\n\nYou know, Anything goes, right?\n\nAnything goes.\n\nYeah, that's anything got.\n\nSo that's our motto now anything goes.\n\nSo I started with a base of just Heinz ketchup, which by the way, is rather disappointed I couldn't get an original glass bottle because I'm an anti squeeze bottle type of guy, but I couldn't find any.\n\nI didn't know that about you.\n\nBut it's a little known secret.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then a little dash of Lee and parents Worcestershire and of course, some cracked pepper.\n\nProbably about not quite a full tablespoon of brown sugar.\n\nI like to put ginger in just about everything.\n\nSo a little dash of ginger.\n\nGinger is good, you know, It really is.\n\nMy also favorite secret ingredient.\n\nA little couple of drops of Frank's red hot sauce.\n\nI bet you're partying all weekend long.\n\nYou and your wife.\n\nYou're having shrimp, aren't you?\n\nAnd it wouldn't be Bill Firstenberger or without maple syrup.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nAnd you party all weekend long?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nAnybody who's been to my house knows that's probably not the case.\n\nBut, hey, you know how to party.\n\nAnd we're just going to gently.\n\nThis is really whisk this together.\n\nWe're having a nice little hors d'oeuvres bar here.\n\nAnd if you have some friends in, you don't have to always have dinner.\n\nJust say we're having early hors d'oeuvres and we'll have some.\n\nAre duff, as they say in French, and we'll have a little cava.\n\nSo come on over.\n\nWe should.\n\nIt's time for.\n\nOh, more cava So more.\n\ncava Cheers again.\n\nCava is the name for Spanish champagne.\n\nAnd there was he has one play, one musical he did that had a lot of Spanish Caribbean music in it.\n\nSo that's two that it's a toast to that program.\n\nAnd so he's you're already aren't you.\n\nAnd maybe a. little squeeze of some lemon juice in there too.\n\nI'll get the seed out though.\n\nYeah.\n\nLet's take the seed out.. And I have to say, he and his wife were married 35 years.\n\nAnd the thing is, Cole Porter preferred men.\n\nHis wife loved him.\n\nThey stayed together, They traveled separately.\n\nThey didn't always live together, but they were close companions.\n\nFor over 35 years.\n\nShe had problems with asthma, breathing.\n\nShe had to go to Arizona quite a few years in a row, and maybe every year she would go someplace dry.\n\nSo and he then moved on to California.\n\nAnd that's where his life got a bit wild and a little out of hand.\n\nAnd that luxury was always part of the Cole Porter lifestyle.\n\nWe didn't talk about their time when they lived in Venice and they rented a palace in Venice that at the time was $4,000 a month, which in today's dollars would be $64,000 a month.\n\nAnd he would throw these extravagant parties and he wasn't necessarily spending money that he had made through his songwriting and he was spending inheritance money from his grandfather.\n\nWho wants to be a millionaire.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nHe did.\n\nYeah, he did.\n\nAnd he loved it.\n\nAnd he shared it and he had parties and he and Elsa maxwell brought Venice back on the map is the party town.\n\nAnd then they bought a place in Paris, and then they had a place in the east, I think it was in New York.\n\nAnd so they they were everywhere.\n\nEverybody wanted to meet him.\n\nI mean, they were never alone.\n\nAnd he would call people and say, Oh, come and join us tonight for dinner.\n\nWe're just having a little supper and you'll be with us.\n\nThe only ones and they would come, Everybody drop everything to go and have dinner with Cole Porter.\n\nAnd, you know, how would you like to be like that Sounds cool.\n\nYou are.\n\nYou are.\n\nYou are.\n\nThis sounds good to me.\n\nI know you have to talk about the fact that he had a life changing accident.\n\nOh, let's talk about that.\n\nIt's very sad.\n\nIs he?\n\nYou know, of that era?\n\nYeah.\n\nOne snuck out on me.\n\nWell, pick it up.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nOkay.\n\nBrave person.\n\nThat's your prawn!\n\nYeah.\n\nMy.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's talk about what happened because he was never the same after that.\n\nHe was not.\n\nYeah, he had a riding accident, horse riding, and, you know, again, a wealthy and elite activity and thing to do, but the horse fell on him and crushed his legs badly.\n\nSo much so that he never walked properly ever again.\n\nAnd he was in a lot of pain.\n\nAnd so that led to painkiller addictions and more alcohol.\n\nAnd and actually, I noticed in the book here the photographs of him from a young man to an old man sent some people you can kind of see that person all the way through.\n\nHe almost looked like an entirely different person by the end of his life.\n\nWell, he was very sad.\n\nIt was such a painful it was a painful experience.\n\nAnd at first the doctors told him, you should have your leg, both legs amputated.\n\nOh, no, he couldn't do that.\n\nI mean, that was too much of a jump.\n\nAnd so probably ten years later, he did have them both amputated and they told it was never going to be well, the marrow of his bone that have been ruined in this accident.\n\nAnd so pain was just with him all the time.\n\nAnd I think I need a little bit more cava And the the irony of that, when you think about it, is, of course, that, you know, here's somebody who brought joy.\n\nYeah.\n\nWith his music to everyone and all of his songs were kind of flippant and airy and nothing was a downer.\n\nAnd yet he had this dramatic side of sorrow and pain in his life and in the fact that he couldn't be himself as a homosexual.\n\nI mean, it was illegal.\n\nYes.\n\nFor him to go to jail for just being himself.\n\nAnd so the fact that he married and had this loving relationship with a person who understood him is remarkable.\n\nI think it is remarkable.\n\nAnd I think I was amazed by all these details and all these friends that came to see him.\n\nHe would he'd still went on trips to like Egypt or Morocco, and they would get him on a donkey and they would pull him up.\n\nAnd.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd he had a he had a lot of people that followed him and helped him.\n\nAnd I don't know what his last big number was that he composed.\n\nWell, Kiss Me.\n\nKate was a huge success.\n\nThat was that was that.\n\nWasn't the last.\n\nBig musical that he made in the 1950s.\n\nAnd he won the very first Tony Award.\n\nYes.\n\nFor Kiss Me.\n\nKate.\n\nSo in.\n\nThe Shakespeare based on Shakespeare.\n\nIt's based on The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I mean, Indiana has a lot to be proud of in Cole Porter.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and so if you've ever been to Peru or Peru, Indiana, he is buried at the cemetery there.\n\nAnd it's a very unusual and sort of idyllic setting.\n\nThat's cemetery.\n\nI encourage anybody driving through that part of the state to take a few minutes and go see it.\n\nIt's not the tombstones.\n\nDo not say Porter They say.\n\nCOLE So people are looking for Porter and they don't find it.\n\nSo that's a hint if you decide to go to the cemetery in Peru.\n\nIn fact, you can make quite a tour of Indiana.\n\nYou can see where Jimmy, Jim James.\n\nOh, James Dean.\n\nJames Dean Sure.\n\nAnd the whole.\n\nThere are some wonderful sights to see all across.\n\nThis.\n\nAnd Jean Porter.\n\nJean Straton Porter has two historic sites, one in Noble County and the Limberlost swamp.\n\nAnd so we're just going to keep talking about Indiana authors here.\n\nand writers.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, we just have a minute before we go to our next segment.\n\nAnd I just want to say we have we've worked on an hors d'oeuvres table and a presentation and we have our cava.\n\nRemember, Spanish champagne.\n\nThat's what it is.\n\nBrought me here in a tux.\n\nAnd look.\n\nOh, that shrimp cocktail or prawn cocktail and cocktail sauce.\n\nAnd you don't have a spot on your foodie apron.\n\nLiving dangerously today and survived.\n\nWell, they needed help.\n\nSo, you know, we came in and now we're going to the party.\n\nWe're going to get ready and we want you to join us.\n\nWe'll be right back Oh, I so enjoy these parties, don't you?\n\nI do indeed.\n\nIt's it is absolutely marvelous.\n\nAnd we just want to kind of recap what we are serving tonight or today, whatever.\n\nSo talk about what you brought.\n\nWell, I made a prawn cocktail from raw shrimp.\n\nYes.\n\nNothing to nothing to put down the ring of shrimp that you can buy in your grocery store.\n\nThat's perfectly okay.\n\nBut if you want to take it to the next level, this is the way to do it.\n\nThis is the way to do it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd what did you make?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nWe have some deviled eggs.\n\nWe have some stuffed potatoes, little baby potatoes or marble potatoes, Sardines, oysters.\n\nAnd then we have a lobster salad and our cava, our Spanish champagne.\n\nAnd it's marvelous, isn't it?\n\nIt is.\n\nJust like Cole Porter was.\n\nMarvelous.\n\nMarvelous.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNow, tell me what you were struck by or what you really enjoyed in this book.\n\nYou know, I learned a lot about Cole Porter.\n\nI think that my biggest takeaway is that for somebody who is thought of, for making all these sort of happy go lucky and flippant songs, that he had a great deal of courage personally to persevere through, through some of, you know, his his own personal life struggles.\n\nAnd then definitely, you know, toward the end of his life with the the accident and the pain that he endured.\n\nYou know, he lived after that accident for almost 20 years.\n\nYeah, not quite.\n\nBut but that's a long.\n\nIt is to be in pain.\n\nYeah, it absolutely is.\n\nI never realized.\n\nThat longer than 20 years.\n\nWas it.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\n37 to 60.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd yes.\n\nAnd so I think he had great friends.\n\nHe loved music to entertain people.\n\nHe kept entertaining, he kept writing.\n\nAnd so we say to Cole Porter, We're glad you're from our state.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd we wish he'd come back.\n\nAnd the rest of you know, we're glad you're here.\n\nAnd thank you for watching.\n\nRemember, good food, good friends, good books, good memories make for an excellent life.\n\nAnd thank you, Bill.\n\nThank you Gail for having me back.\n\nIt's always a pleasure.\n\nIt's always fun.\n\nAnd so we'll see you next time.\n\nCheers.\n\nCheers.\n\nThis WNIT local production has been made possible in part by viewers like you.\n\nThank you.\n\nDinner and a book is supported by the Rex and Alice A. Martin Foundation of Elkhart, celebrating the spirit of Alice Martin and her love of good food and good friends."
