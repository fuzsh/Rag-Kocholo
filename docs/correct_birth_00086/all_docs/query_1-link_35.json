        "text": "(1891–1964). American composer and lyricist Cole Porter was widely successful in the field of American musicals. His large output of work reflects a sophisticated, polished musical style.\n\nCole Albert Porter was born on June 9, 1891, in Peru, Indiana, the grandson of a millionaire speculator. He began violin study at the age of six and piano at eight. When he was 10 he composed an operetta in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan; his first composition, a waltz, was published a year later. Before graduating from Yale University with a bachelor’s degree in 1913, he composed about 300 songs, including “Eli,” “Bulldog,” and “Bingo Eli Yale.” Porter later studied at Harvard Law School (1914) and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in music (1915–16). He made his Broadway debut with the musical comedy See America First (1916), which closed after 15 performances."
