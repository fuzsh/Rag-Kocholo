All dialogue within each song is printed in the score to prevent flipping back and forth during rehearsals. All books are spiral-bound and double-sided.\n\n1 Piano/Conductor Score\n\nA keyboard score that is a key part of the show’s actual orchestration.

Each detailed instrument staff is always right in front of you--giving you the most comprehensive layout for full control of your orchestra.\n\n$125/Print, $100/Digital, $175/both\n\nTurnKey Transpositions\n\nBroadway stars change the keys of songs all the time...so why not you?
