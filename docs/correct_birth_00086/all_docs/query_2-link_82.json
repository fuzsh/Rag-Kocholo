        "text": "Cole Porter\n\nCole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana in 1891 and died in Hollywood 73 years later. In between, he wrote some of the most memorable songs ever heard on stage or screen, among them “Night and Day,” “Begin the Beguine,” “You’re The Top,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” “Love For Sale,” and “Just One of Those Things.” During the 1930s, his most productive decade, he provided a series of sparkling scores for such hits as Gay Divorce, Anything Goes, Jubilee, Born to Dance and Red, Hot and Blue. Despite a crippling riding accident in 1937 which left him in constant pain, he achieved his greatest commercial success in 1948, with Kiss Me, Kate. His name remains synonymous with wit and sophistication to this day."
