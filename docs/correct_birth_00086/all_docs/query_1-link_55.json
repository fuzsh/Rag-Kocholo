        "text": "At least 10,000 years ago, people lived in the area now called Indiana. About 2,000 years ago a mysterious culture now called Hopewell Tradition filled earthen mounds with tens of thousands of artifacts, giving Indiana one of the most important archaeological sites in the United States. Native American tribes, including the Illini, Miami, and Shawnee, lived on the land thousands of years later. (And the Miami, Shawnee, and Potawatomi tribes still live here today.)\n\nAround 1614 French explorer Samuel de Chaplain visited the area, one of the first Europeans to see the land. By the late 1600s the land was controlled by the French. Between 1754 and 1763, the French and English fought for control of the region in the French and Indian War. The English were victorious and won the land. Later these lands would become known as the Indiana Territory.\n\nAt the end of the American Revolution, in 1783, Britain ceded Indiana to the United States, and in 1816 Indiana became the 19th state. During the Civil War (1861-1865) the state fought in favor of the Union.\n\nIndiana was named after the American Indian tribes who lived there when Europeans arrived.\n\nThe nickname Hoosier was first used to describe a person during the 1820s, but experts don’t agree on its meaning. The word might come from an old English term for “hill” that was used as slang for people who lived in Indiana’s hill territory.\n\nThis midwestern state is bordered by Michigan and Lake Michigan in the north, Ohio and Kentucky in the east, Kentucky in the south, and Illinois in the west. The state can be divided into three main regions.\n\nThe Great Lakes Plains region covers the northern part of the state. Here the sand dunes of Indiana Dunes State Park rise along Lake Michigan. Farther south, the land becomes dark and fertile with small lakes and low hills.\n\nThe center of the state is covered by the Till Plains, which has low hills and valleys. The area is part of the midwestern “Corn Belt,” so named because that’s one of the top crops in this region. The state’s highest point, Hoosier Hill, is here. It rises 1,257 feet in the air.\n\nThe Southern Plains and Lowlands region covers southern Indiana. Here, steep hills called knobs stand out on lowlands. There are also limestone caverns and caves. The Ohio River creates the state’s southern border."
