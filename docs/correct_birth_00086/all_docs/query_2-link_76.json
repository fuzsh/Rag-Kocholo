        "text": "Cole Porter (UNITED STATES)\n\nCole Porter (1891–1964) was an American composer and songwriter. His worksinclude the musical comedies Kiss Me, Kate (1948), Fifty Million Frenchmen and Anything Goes, as well as songs like \"Night and Day,\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" and \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\" Porter was born in Peru , Indiana, into a wealthy family; his grandfather was a coal and timber speculator. His mother started Cole Porter in musical training at an early age. Porter's grandfather wanted the boy to become a lawyer, and with that career in mind, Porter attended Yale University beginning in 1909, and spent a year at Harvard Law School in 1913. Porter enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and served in North Africa. He was transferred in 1917 to the French Officers School at Fontainebleau and was assigned to teach gunnery to American soldiers. He set up a luxury apartment in Paris and alternated between his officer duties and leading a playboy lifestyle."
