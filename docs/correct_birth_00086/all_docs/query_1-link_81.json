        "text": "A group of musical enthusiasts in Peru, Indiana, is transforming the house where Cole Porter was born into a museum dedicated to the composer's life and work. Led by town mayor Jim Walker and working largely from donations, the group raised the cash to buy the house last year. They plan to refurbish it and open it to the public next summer.\n\nUntil recently, the building was in a sorry state. Windows were smashed, and the roof and foundations needed major renovation. In 2003, police discovered and destroyed an illegal methamphetamine lab in one of the upstairs apartments, and since then the house has stood empty.\n\n\"It's a shambles,\" says Walker. \"We're going to need around $105,000 to get it finished up.\" Porter lived in the house on South Huntington Street until he was a teenager. There he learned to play piano and violin, and even composed a few of his earliest songs. Despite a career that took him around the world, he often returned to his native Indiana, and when he died in 1964 he was buried in the town cemetery.\n\nSome of Porter's family still live in the town and have agreed to donate memorabilia.But the museum's most unusual feature will be the offer of bed and breakfast. \"Being able to stay in the home will be a nice attraction,\" Walker says. \"The room he was born in will be much sought-after.\""
