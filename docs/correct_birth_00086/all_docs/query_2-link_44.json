        "text": "Cole Porter wrote both words and music for a vast repertoire of songs. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing, and his musical talent was encouraged. He left Harvard Law School to pursue music in New York but moved to Paris in 1917. There he led a glamorous social life throughout the â20s. He married socialite Linda Thomas in 1919. Cole was gay but the couple filled each otherâs needs and remained devoted to each other until Lindaâs death in 1954.\n\nIt was Coleâs âLetâs Do Itâ from Paris (1928) that established his reputation. After an unsuccessful Hollywood venture writing for film he returned to New York in 1929 for Fifty Million Frenchmen, the first in a string of hit shows. Coleâs lyrics are sophisticated and often risque as in 1930âs âLove for Sale.â His hits include âWhat Is This Thing Called Loveâ 1930), âNight and Dayâ (1932), âI Get a Kick Out of Youâ from Anything Goes (1934), âBegin the Beguineâ and âJust One of Those Thingsâ (1935). âIâve Got You Under My Skinâ and âEasy to Loveâ are from the 1936 film Born to Dance.\n\nA riding accident in 1937 crushed his legs and left him in severe pain, but he continued to write: âGet Out of Townâ (1938), âEverything I Loveâ (1941), and âI Love Youâ (1944). âDonât Fence Me Inâ (popularized by cowboy actor/singer Roy Rogers) appeared in the 1944 film Hollywood Canteen.\n\nColeâs biggest Broadway successes were still to come. Kiss Me Kate (1948) ran for over 1,000 performances; then came Can Can (1953) and Silk Stockings (1955). His right leg was amputated in 1958 and he was unable to attend 1960âs âSalute to Cole Porterâ at the Metropolitan Opera House. Night and Day (1948) was an unrealistic biography of Porterâs life, but 2004âs De-Lovely covers elements omitted from the earlier film."
