        "text": "As I’ve said before, musical theatre has always had its influential and successful composers, and few fit this description from the 1930s onward better than composer Cole Porter. He was a composer for Broadway shows during the 1930s and onward. Some of his most popular musicals are Anything Goes (1934), Kiss Me Kate (1948), Can-Can (1953), and more. He also composed music for the 1956 MGM movie musical High Society. Porter’s power was felt the most in the 1930s, an era his music epitomized. Songwriter Johnny Mercer comments on this, saying ,”Cole Porter is definitive of an era. He IS those years you know? He is the style of all those shows, all that period. He represents it better than anybody else.” (Stempel 264). This 30s style that Porter represented was one of “urbanity and (…) cultural resonance”. The music of the shows during this era were sophisticated, urban, and stylish. No show during this time fits that description more than Porter’s Anything Goes. It is a comedy about the crazy adventures aboard an ocean liner going from New York to London. The show not only spoofed cultural foibles of the time, but many of its songs are now considered musical comedy archetypes including the torch song (“I Get a Kick Out of You”), the list song (“You’re the Top”), the love balled (“All Through the Night”), late-in-the-show showstopper (“Blow, Gabriel Blow”), and the title song (“Anything Goes”). His later shows were no less successful, with Kiss Me Kate being his longest running hit and winning the first Tony for Best Musical. Cole Porter was one of the most successful composers of his time with many culturally relevant hits that are still revived today.\n\nBelow is a clip of the titular song from the 2011 revival of Anything Goes."
