Cole — and due to his upbringing, young Cole Porter enjoyed a privileged childhood, according to the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nAt the age of 6, Porter started playing both the violin and piano — and became quite good at both instruments, says the same source.\n\nBy age 10, the young prodigy was already composing songs.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JUNE 8, 1969, MICKEY MANTLE'S NO. 7 IS RETIRED BY NEW YORK YANKEES\n\nIn 1902, at age 11, Porter composed a piece called \"The Bobolink Waltz,\" says the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nAt age 13, Porter left his home to attend Worcester Academy, an elite boarding school in Massachusetts.

During his years at Yale, he wrote a total of 300 songs, according to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAfter Yale, he enrolled in Harvard Law School in an attempt to please his grandfather — but eventually followed his heart and changed his major to music during his second year of studies, notes the Indiana Historical Society.\n\n\"It is said that his mother hid this fact from his grandfather,\" says the same source.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 31, 1930, ACTOR-DIRECTOR CLINT EASTWOOD IS BORN IN CALIFORNIA\n\nWith his musical degree from Harvard, Porter ventured to New York City in search of work.\n\nPorter’s noteworthy success arrived in 1928, when he wrote the score for a musical comedy, \"Paris\" — one of the musical’s songs, \"Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love,\" became a huge hit.\n\nPorter’s first musical, \"See America First,\" made an unsuccessful appearance on Broadway in 1916 — and Porter went to France the next year, Biography.com notes.\n\nThere are reports that during World War I, Porter sent home untrue notices that he had joined the French Foreign Legion — in reality, he was participating in an active Parisian social life, the same source indicates.\n\nIn 1919, Porter married a divorced socialite named Linda Lee Thomas in 1919.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Porter’s noteworthy success arrived in 1928, when he wrote the score for a musical comedy, \"Paris.\"\n\nOne of the musical’s songs, \"Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love,\" became a huge hit, notes Biography.com.\n\nThis success was the springboard for other achievements.\n\nSome of Porter's most famous musicals and songs include \"Fifty Million Frenchmen,\" \"Wake Up and Dream,\" \"Anything Goes,\" and \"Jubilee,\" the same source recounts.\n\nIn 1936, the movie musical \"Born to Dance\" featured \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" and Jimmy Stewart singing \"Easy To Love.\"\n\nIn 1936, Porter had another Broadway musical, \"Red, Hot and Blue!\" starring Ethel Merman, Bob Hope and Jimmy Durante; it included \"It's D'Lovely,\" says the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 11, 1888, IRVING BERLIN, COMPOSER OF ‘GOD BLESS AMERICA,’ IS BORN\n\nAlso in 1936, the movie musical \"Born to Dance\" featured \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" and Jimmy Stewart singing \"Easy To Love.\"\n\nAnd a 1937 film, \"Rosalie,\" introduced \"In The Still Of The Night,\" notes the same source.\n\nIn the summer of 1937, when he was just 46 years old, Porter was thrown from a horse.\n\nThe animal fell on top of him, crushing his legs. He was paralyzed for the remainder of his life, according to the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nYet still he continued to compose.\n\nCole Porter received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007.\n\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s, his Broadway musicals \"Kiss Me Kate,\" \"Can-Can\" and \"Silk Stockings\" were very successful — with \"Kiss Me, Kate\" winning the first Tony Award for Best Musical in 1949, says the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring the 1950s, he remained an American music icon.\n\n\"He wrote the music and lyrics for \"High Society,\" the 1956 MGM film version of \"The Philadelphia Story\" — which starred a young Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and the alluring Grace Kelly, PBS points out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPorter died at age 73 in 1964 of kidney failure in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn May 2007, Porter posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as the Associated Press reported at the time — and in Dec. 2010, his portrait was added to the Hoosier Heritage Gallery in the Office of the Governor of Indiana."
