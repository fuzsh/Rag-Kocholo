        "text": "Cole Porter Suite\n\nThis suite contains a queen size bed, a full size bed, and a beautiful claw-foot tub (no shower), as well as a kitchen with microwave, coffee maker, hot plate, and fridge. This suite contains the room where Cole was believed to be born and cared for as an infant back in 1891. Great for longer stays.\n\nAnything Goes Suite\n\nThis suite contains one queen size bed, a twin daybed, a claw-foot tub with a shower, and a kitchenette with microwave and small fridge. This suite is named after one of Cole’s most popular musicals that included songs: Anything Goes, You Are the Top, and I Get A Kick Out of You. The suite showcases multiple Cole Porter pieces along with a hand painted city skyline mural, piano keys on the floor, and an authentic, theatrical poster.\n\nNight and Day Suite\n\nThis suite contains two queen size beds, a shower, and a full kitchen with microwave, countertop oven, hotplate, and fridge. Perfect for extended stays. This suite is named after one of Cole’s most popular songs, which has been recorded by dozens of artists including: Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James and U2. It was written in 1932 for the play Gay Divorce. The song was so associated with Porter, that when Hollywood first filmed his life story in 1946, the movie was titled Night and Day.\n\nKiss Me Kate\n\nThe Kiss Me Kate suite is located on the first floor and is an open concept studio apartment with full kitchen. The apartment is at the Cole Porter Inn, the birth Place of musical genius Cole Porter. Built over 100 yers ago, the home boasts 10 foot ceilings. This space was Coles mother’s parlor and has ceiling to floor mirrors as well as huge windows. This space is newly renovated and has new shower, king sized bed, and stackable washer and dryer. Perfect for extended stays.\n\nAll suites have a sun room for reading and relaxation, as was typical in Mr. Porter’s time, as well as entertainment accommodations, including a smart TV and internet access."
