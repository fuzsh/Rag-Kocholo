        "text": "Born to the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Cole Porter learned the violin and piano from the age of six. Cole soon devoted his attention to the piano, practising two hours a day. His first (privately) published composition was a piano piece called Song of the Birds in 1901;\n\nPorter attended the Worcester Academy from 1905 and went from there to Yale where he composed around 300 songs for various college productions. He then began studies in Law at Harvard but switched to Music before eventually abandoning his studies in 1916. Later in 1923 he attended the Schola Cantorum in Paris.\n\nHis first Broadway show, 'See America First', staged in 1916 was a flop. He then moved to Paris as a civilian in 1917 and spent the war and part of the 20's in Europe. He eventually returned to New York and it was there that Porter had his first Broadway success with 'Greenwich Village Follies Of 1924'. This launched a career that lasted until 1958 and included (amongst many others). The 1934 worldwide stage hit 'Anything Goes' and the 1948 'Kiss me Kate' both of which were made into films. His witty, sophisticated lyrics and subtle melodies have made him one of the most notable figures in popular music.\n\nIn 1958 Porter's right leg, which he had injured in a 1937 riding accident, was amputated. This had a marked effect on his creative productivity - and happiness. It also affected his health, which deteriorated until his death."
