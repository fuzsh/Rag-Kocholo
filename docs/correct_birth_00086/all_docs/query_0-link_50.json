Not having to work for a living and finding he had a talent for songwriting, he was able to pursue his love of both music and the Broadway stage. After attending both Yale and Harvard (where he wrote some college fight songs that are still sung today) he tried his hand with a Broadway musical called ‘See America First.’\n\n‘See America First’ was not very successful. In fact, much of Cole Porter’s output met with little success, but what was successful left us many memorable tunes: “Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love),” “Anything Goes,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” “Night and Day” and “You’re the Top.” He also had a few successful numbers written for the big screen such as “I've Got You under My Skin” and “In the Still of the Night.”\n\nPorter lived a rather flamboyant lifestyle with homes in Paris and Venice. But a horseback riding accident in 1937 left him with a crushed leg which, in spite of 30 surgical procedures over the course of twenty years, still had to be amputated. Unable to walk and in constant pain, Cole Porter’s output declined but he was able to write the music for what could arguably be considered his best production: “Kiss Me, Kate.”\n\nCole Porter died in Santa Monica, California, in 1964 at the age of 73. He was buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery back in his hometown of Peru.\n\n(Source: biography.com)\n\nDescription:\n\nSee Long Description above.Date of birth: 06/09/1891Date of death: 10/15/1964Area of notoriety: EntertainmentMarker Type: HeadstoneSetting: OutdoorVisiting Hours/Restrictions: noneFee required?: NoWeb site: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nTo post a visit log for waymarks in this category, you must have personally visited the waymark location.
