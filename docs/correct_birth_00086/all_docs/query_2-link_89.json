        "text": "The musical \"Anything Goes\" and one of the main characters, Reno Sweeney, is loosely based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson 1890 -- 1944.\n\nAmiee was an Evangelist, born near Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. She was the daughter of a Salvation Army soldier. She married a Pentacostal missionary and was widowed \"way, way out in China\" in 1910. She returned to North America with her daughter and set out on a career as an evangelist, offering a fundamentalist message of hope and salvation that brought in enormous money contributions over the course of some 25 years. She'd \"marry 'em and divorce 'em, marry 'em and divorce 'em\" again, (thus all her names!}. Often accompanied by her mother, she traveled around the U.S.A. to conduct her revival meetings. Flamboyant and innovative, she expanded her Los Angeles-based (after 1918) evangelical empire by adding a radio station, a Bible school, and a magazine. She was often accused of improprieties, but nothing was ever proved. She died in Oakland, Calif., of an overdose of sleeping powders."
