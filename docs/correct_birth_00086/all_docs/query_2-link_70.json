        "text": "About\n\nSongwriter and winner of the 1948 Tony Award for Best Musical for Kiss Me, Kate. He wrote such American musical theater and popular standards as \"Night and Day,\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" and \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\"\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe wrote an operetta, albeit with his mother's help, when he was just ten years old.\n\nTrivia\n\nMany of his hit songs, including \"Well, Did You Evah!\" and \"You're the Top,\" were performed by such legendary vocalists as Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nFamily Life\n\nDespite being a homosexual, he married Linda Lee Thomas in 1919. Thomas was at peace with Porter's homosexuality and was willing to provide him cover during an extremely homophobic age due to the fact that he treated her much better than her first husband had.\n\nAssociated With"
