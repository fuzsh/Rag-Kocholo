        "text": "The anomalous sale came about because the songwriter's home sat on two adjacent plots of land, which were auctioned separately. The owner lost the land because of a failure to pay overdue taxes. According to AP, Peru local Brian Boyce came out on top for the first parcel with a proxy bid of $800. Boyce was outbid for the second, however, by Michigan native Keith Wegner's $9,000 pledge. Both bidders expresses a desire to have the house restored. However, Boyce and Wegner must wait a year, during which time the owner can reclaim the plots by paying the taxes due.\n\nPorter lived at the 102 E. Third St. address until the 8th grade. He was born in an upstairs bedroom on June 9, 1891 to Samuel and Kate Porter."
