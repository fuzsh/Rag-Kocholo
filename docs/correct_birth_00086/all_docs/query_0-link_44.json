        "text": "Retro Indy: \"Anything Goes\" with songwriter Cole Porter\n\nIndiana-born songwriter Cole Porter wrote more than 1,500 songs for stage, movies and television, including such standards as \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" \"Night and Day,\" \"Begin the Beguine,\" and \"Anything Goes.\"\n\nBorn June 9, 1891 in Peru, Indiana, Porter grew up in a wealthy, socially powerful family. His maternal grandfather, J.O. Cole, was one of the richest men in Indiana and though he disapproved of his grandson's obsession with \"musical nonsense,\" he financed Cole's early career.\n\nPorter left Indiana as a teenager in 1905, attending Worcester Academy in Massachusetts and then Yale University. While at Yale, he found that his musical talents and his gift of entertaining enabled him to make friends easily. He threw himself into musical programs at Yale and composed numerous pieces including football fight songs \"Bulldog\" and \"Bingo Eli Yale\" aka \"Bingo, That's The Lingo!\" which are still played at Yale today. He briefly studied law at Harvard but soon left school for a life of high society parties in New York while writing songs for musical theatre. His first efforts were financial and critical failures, but by 1919 Porter had his first hit, \"Old-Fashioned Garden\" from the revue Hitchy-Koo.\n\nThat year, he also married Linda Lee Thomas. They remained together until her death in 1954, though according to some biographers, Porter was gay and the marriage a platonic friendship. By the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, Porter was at his peak of popularity.\n\nHis first Broadway hit was Paris in 1928 and over the next 25 years, Porter would enjoy a string of success with Du Barry Was a Lady (1939), Panama Hattie (1940), Let's Face It (1941), Something for the Boys (1942), Mexican Hayride (1943), Kiss Me Kate (1948) which won the first Tony Award for Best Musical., Can-Can (1953) and Silk Stockings (1955).\n\nAfter a crippling horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter went through years of surgeries on his damaged legs, eventually losing one of them to amputation in 1958. Porter never wrote another song after the amputation and spent the remaining six years of his life in relative seclusion. He suffered from ulcers, alcoholism and depression, particularly after the deaths of his wife and his mother. He was 73 when he died in 1964 and his body was sent back to Indiana for burial at Mount Hope Cemetery in Peru."
