        "text": "Estimate the Cost of\n\nYour License\n\nStart planning your production with a cost estimate you can save and share with your team. Just answer a few questions.\n\nThis estimator is only for non-Equity/amateur productions. Equity/professional customers should contact the Licensing department directly at [email protected].\n\nImportant:\n\nThe cost quoted is an estimate only and may differ when you apply for a license.\n\nIn this tour-de-force one-woman show, Linda Lee Thomas (Mrs. Cole Porter), candidly recounts, through song and story, her life’s journey with Cole Porter. From the first time she lays eyes on the very young Cole, she knows that he’s the refreshing change of pace her life is crying out for, after an abusive marriage to an overbearing first husband.\n\nCole’s homosexuality is of no consequence to Linda, as long as she has his love. After a whirlwind honeymoon around the world, Linda and Cole settle in Paris, and begin to develop Cole’s career. Linda introduces Cole to some of the greatest artists residing in Europe at the time, and with Cole’s great talent and discipline, she enlists friends such as Irving Berlin, to open the doors that lead Cole to his first successes on Broadway.\n\nIn the course of the show, Linda takes us behind the glitter of their sensational social life, sharing intimate, and at times heartbreaking moments, such as the dashed dreams of having a child, Cole’s occasional hurtful sexual escapades, his crippling horse accident and her own failing health. To quote Linda from the show, their journey together was far from “a picture-perfect postcard”, but by the end of her story, she has definitively made the case that “just because a love between two people may be difficult to define, that doesn’t mean it didn’t exist.”\n\nMusical numbers, cleverly taken out of their original context, include the hits \"So In Love,\" \"I Love Paris,\" \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" \"Night and Day,\" and \"Wunderbar,\" plus lesser-known gems like \"When A Woman’s In Love.\""
