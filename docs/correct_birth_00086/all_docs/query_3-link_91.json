It remains in our database for historical reference. **\n\nThe Cole Porter Society launched in January 2014 with the mission to ensure future generations know and appreciate the music and unique contribution of Cole Porter to The Great American Songbook.\n\nCole Porter is an American Treasure.\n\nBorn in Peru, Indiana in 1891 of a well-to-do family, he displayed an unusual interest in music and verse. It is said that he inherited his mother’s musicality and his father’s love of poetry. Cole wrote over 800 songs in his lifetime, including “What is This Thing Called Love,” “Night and Day,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” “You’re the Top” and “Begin the Beguine.” The recent uncovering of a lost collection of his songs including “The Ambassador Revue” brought news coverage in all the major newspapers across the country.\n\nAnd yet. When we look out at the audience for his concerts, we do not often see the younger generation. Indeed, even the students we speak to who are enrolled in music programs often do not know of Cole Porter.\n\nOur objective is to build the audience of those who appreciate Cole Porter to partner with us to keep his legacy and music alive and to bring his music to younger audiences through concerts and lectures.\n\nOur funding comes from proceeds from performances and private donors.\n\n** NOTE: This organization is no longer in operation.
