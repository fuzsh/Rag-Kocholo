        "text": "Welcome to the Cole Porter Inn.\n\nBorn in 1891 to Samuel and Kate (Cole) Porter, Cole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, and spent the first ten years of his life at 17-19 South Huntington Street. It is in this residence Cole began his career as an unparalleled composer and lyricist, composing several of his early songs, including \"The Bob-O-Link Waltz.\"\n\nIn the following years, Cole's birthplace was converted into a privately-owned apartment complex and fell into a state of disrepair. In 2003, the property was turned over to the City of Peru.\n\nIn 2004, Ole Olsen Memorial Theatre (the civic theatre group was founded in 1964 as the namesake of vaudeville actor John Siguard \"Ole\" Olsen) purchased the Cole Porter Birthplace and over the next four years, restored to its 1891 condition! Part of that restoration included turning part of the home into a historical Inn.\n\nThe Cole Porter Inn currently features four elegant suites—The Cole Porter Suite, The Anything Goes Suite, The Night & Day Suite, and The Kiss Me Kate Suite which is set up for extended stays.\n\nThe Cole Porter Inn is currently owned and operated by Jill Ash."
