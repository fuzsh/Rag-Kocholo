        "text": "\"Moviri Integrator for TrueSight Capacity Optimization – IBM Tivoli Monitoring\" is an additional component of BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization. It allows collecting information from IBM Tivoli Monitoring and it is able to extract and summarize resources performance data, configuration data and relations between infrastructure entities.\n\nCollected data can be levearged by BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization, in order to:\n\nAnalyze resources usage\n\nPerform trend analysis and forecast analysis\n\nGain at-a-glance control over IT infrastructure capacity with BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization Virtual Farm Views\n\nPerform capacity optimization and planning\n\nThe connector supports configuration parameters that allow systems and metrics collection filtering, historical recovery, limiting data volume processed in a single run, specifying data resolution and many other settings.\n\nRequirements\n\nOfficial name of data source software\n\nIBM Tivoli Monitoring\n\nSupported versions of data source software\n\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring 6.2.1\n\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring 6.2.2\n\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring 6.2.3\n\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring 6.3.x\n\nFor different version of data source software please contact Moviri (www.moviri.com)or BMC Support (http://www.bmc.com/support).\n\nSupported configurations of data source software\n\nMoviri Integrator for TrueSight Capacity Optimization - IBM Tivoli Monitoring supports ITM mandatorily configured with Tivoli Data Warehouse component. The supported DBMS versions are:\n\nOracle Database 11g, 12c\n\nDB2 version 9, 10\n\nSQL Server 2005, 2008, 2012\n\nFor different version of data source software please contact Moviri (www.moviri.com)or BMC Support (http://www.bmc.com/support).\n\nMoviri Integrator for TrueSight Capacity Optimization - IBM Tivoli Monitoring is able to import metrics generated by four Tivoli Agents \"families\", each including the following Tivoli Agents\n\nNT: Windows OS Agent\n\nLZ: Linux OS Agent\n\nKUX: Unix OS Agent\n\nAIX: AIX Premium Agent, CEC Base Agent, HMC Base Agent\n\nInstallation\n\nPreparing for installation\n\nBefore you can install the service pack, you must have previously installed one of the versions of BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization listed in Section 2.2.\n\nDownloading the additional component\n\nThe Additional Component File can be downloaded from the BMC Electronic Product Distribution site http://www.bmc.com/support/downloads-patches and consists of the following archive:\n\nMoviri Integrator Version 4.7.00 for TrueSight Capacity Optimization - IBM Tivoli Monitoring.zip\n\nlater versions of the integrator are guaranteed to be backward compatible.\n\nInstalling the additional component\n\nTo install the connector in the form of a TrueSight Capacity Optimization additional package, follow the instruction reported here.\n\nDatasource Check and Configuration\n\nThis section provides outlines the process required to setup the data source for the integration.\n\nPreparing to connect to the data source software\n\nAs a first step, please ensure that the correct version of Tivoli is installed. You can perform this check from the \"About\" section of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.\n\nPlease also ensure that the DBMS version is compliant with the requirement shown in Section 2.4.\n\nFirst you have to ensure data is properly collected through the deployment for each target platform of the correct Tivoli Agent Type, i.e.:\n\nWindows Servers: Windows OS Agent\n\nLinux Servers: Linux OS Agent\n\nGeneric Unix Servers: Unix OS Agent, AIX Premium Agent\n\nPowerVM AIX Hosts and Guests: AIX Premium Agent, CEC Base Agent, HMC Base Agent\n\nFor Agents' configuration and deployment refer to Tivoli official documentation and coordinate with Tivoli administrator.\n\nAs an additional requirement for the connector, Tivoli needs to store historical metrics in the Tivoli Data Warehouse. History Collection needs to be configured with the proper aging parameters.\n\nFor all Tivoli Data Warehouse tables listed proper historical collection needs to be setup. Examples are shown in Figure 10 (for Linux monitored systems), Figure 11 (for Windows monitored systems), and Figure 12 (for Unix monitored systems).\n\nEnsure also that the Summarization and Pruning Agent is up and running.\n\nConnector configuration\n\nConnector configuration attributes\n\nThere are three sections (tabs) in the ETL run configuration page where the behaviour of \"Moviri Integrator for BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization - IBM Tivoli Monitoring\" can be specified:\n\nTivoli – Data Selection\n\nTivoli – Settings\n\nTivoli - Workloads\n\nConnection Parameters\n\nTivoli – Data Selection\n\nIn \"Tivoli – Data Selection\" section the following can be specified:\n\nAgent families to import:\n\nAIX: data collected by AIX Premium Agent, CEC Base Agent, HMC Base Agent\n\nLinux: data collected by Linux OS Agent\n\nUnix: data collected by Unix OS Agent\n\nWindows: data collected by Windows OS Agent\n\nImport workload data only: if set to \"yes\" only process level data will be extracted from Tivoli Data Warehouse and then aggregated by the connector into \"workloads\"\n\nSql expressions applied to include systems: a \";\" separated list of string that will be used to limit the servers imported by the connector. In the example above (\"cat%\") only servers whose name starts with \"cat\" will be imported by the connector\n\nSql expressions applied to exclude systems: a \";\" separated list of string that will be used to exclude servers. In the example above (\"%ux\") servers ending in \"ux\" will be skipped by the connector\n\nTables to be imported: a \";\" separated list of Tivoli Data Warehouse tables that limit the sources where the connector extracts data from. A complete list of the tables that the connector is able to manage is listed in next paragraphs. This list can be further reduced if \"Import workload data only\" setting is set to \"yes\"\n\nTables to be excluded: a \";\" separated list of Tivoli Data Warehouse tables that are not to be considered by the connector. A complete list of the tables that the connector is able to manage is listed in next paragraphs.\n\nTivoli - Settings\n\nIn \"Tivoli – Settings\" section the following can be specified:\n\nSchema for TDW tables: the database user owner of the Tivoli Data Warehouse tables\n\nDefault last counter: the default starting timestamp of the data import (format is YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS). This will be used only the first time each Tivoli Data Warehouse table is managed by the connector, all subsequent times the connector will start from where it ended the previous time.\n\nData resolution: Raw for importing raw data as recorded by Tivoli agents in the Tivoli Data Warehouse (typically 15 minutes), Hour for hourly data, Day for daily. Aggregation is not performed by the connector, the connector selects from the Warehouse the already computed level of aggregation.\n\nLoad statistics: (available for resolution greater than Raw) if set to \"yes\" minimum and maximum statistics are transferred to BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization together with the default statistic of each metric\n\nMax Duration for raw samples: duration of raw data is computed as the timestamp difference between subsequent samples. This property prevents inactivity periods of monitored servers to be incorrectly imported as long-duration samples.\n\nMax days to import in a single run: maximum number of days to be imported for data at Raw resolution (Default value: 15)\n\nBMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization Tree Entities:\n\nUpdate hierarchy (track entities and remove from the tree if not imported): this mode aims at replicating what found in the Tivoli Data Warehouse in the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization Tree. The population of servers is inspected across subsequent executions of the ETL: what is missing will be removed from the tree (not deleted), what is new will be added.\n\nOnly add imported entities: this mode simply add to the tree the entities discovered during the execution. This mode is useful when you have entities with intermittent presence. If \"Update hierarchy\" mode would be used instead, intermittent entities (the ones not present every day, e.g. \"workloads\") will appear and disappear from the tree according to the fact they have data in the latest execution.\n\nAssign timezone shifts to samples: makes the ETL associate each sample with the time zone indication on the time zone it refers to, if such information is available in ITM.\n\nTivoli - Workloads\n\nIn \"Tivoli – Workloads\" section the following can be specified:\n\nFor each imported workload force attachment of host to BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization tree: in BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization both the workloads and the hosts that contain them are entities, the relationship between a host and its workloads will be always loaded whereas\n\nif this property is set to \"yes\": the hosts will be directly attached to the root domain associated to the ETL (defined in the \"Object relationships\" tab of the run configuration page). If the host happen to be an LPAR: the LPAR will be attached to its frame if that information is imported by this ETL (or another one sharing the lookup table) AND the LPAR will be attached to the root as well\n\nif this property is set to \"no\": the hosts will not be attached to anything. Hosts (and therefore attached workloads) will appear in the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization tree only if this ETL (or another one sharing the lookup table) will attach them to some domain or parent system\n\nWorkload lists: a \";\" separated list of the workloads definition. Each process found in the processes tables in Tivoli Data Warehouse is sequentially checked against each workload definition, as soon as one definition matches the process is labeled to belong to that workload. If no definition is matched process is labeled to belong to the default \"zzz\" workload, defined for each server\n\nCriteria: for each dimension a regular expression can be specified. For a process to belong to a workload all defined criteria needs to be satisfied (AND logical operation).\n\nuser [USR]\n\ncommand [CMD]\n\ncommand fullpath [CMDPATH]\n\ncommand arguments [ARGS]\n\nserver [SERVER]\n\nzone [ZONE]\n\nlabel: if criteria are met the label can be dynamically computed on the basis of the regular expression criteria, using regular expression capturing groups. In the example above a process started by the oracle user whose command is oracleDBSID1 will be placed in the \"db_instance_DBSID1\" workload, while a process started by the oracle user whose command is oracleDBSID2 will be placed in the \"db_instance_DBSID2\" workload. If no macro (%[DIMENSION]_GROUP1\n\nConnection Parameters\n\nFinally, the \"Connection Parameters\" must be set to enable the connector to reach the data source. Three DBMS technologies are supported, for which you can find the properties to be set below.\n\nDB2\n\nDatabase type: \"Other Database\"\n\nDatabase user: <<user>>\n\nDatabase password: <<password>>\n\nJDBC Driver: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver **\n\nJDBC Url: jdbc:db2://<<host>>:<<port>>/<<databasename>>\n\n: DB2 driver is not shipped with BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization or with Moviri Integrator for CO, so your DB2 driver of choice must be manually placed in <<CO_BASE_PATH>>/etl/libext on each BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization server where the connector needs to be executed\n\nOracle\n\nDatabase type: \"Oracle\"\n\nDatabase user: <<user>>\n\nDatabase password: <<password>>\n\nJDBC Driver: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\n\nHost name: <<host>>\n\nPort: <<port>>\n\nService Name: <<tns_entry>> **\n\n**: make sure tns_entry is present in the machine's tnsnames.ora file\n\nSQL Server (SQL Server Authentication)\n\nDatabase type: \"Microsoft SQL Server\"\n\nDatabase user: <<user>>\n\nDatabase password: <<password>>\n\nJDBC Driver: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver\n\nHost Name: <<host>>\n\nPort: <<port>>\n\nDatabase Name: <<databasename>>\n\nSQL Server (Windows Authentication)\n\nDatabase type: \"Other Database\"\n\nDatabase user: <<user>>\n\nDatabase password: <<password>>\n\nJDBC Driver: net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver\n\nJDBC Url: jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://<<host>>/<<databasename>>;domain=<<windows_domain>>\n\nHistorical data extraction\n\nIn order to perform a historical recovery of data, please use the default, \"lastcounter\"-based mechanism of CO, i.e. change the current value of the desired lastcounter. \"Max days\" property can be useful during historical imports of raw data, enabling the split the overall load in smaller chunks.\n\nIf the ETL is newly created and has no lastcounter defined, the \"default lastcounter\" is used.\n\nThe pre-condition for an historical extraction is the presence of data inside the Tivoli data source.\n\nWorkloads import notes\n\nProcess-level detail can constitute a large amount of data volume, both unaggregated on Tivoli Data Warehouse side, and aggregated as workloads on the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization side. A general indication is to use this feature for highly shared critical server only, and for a limited period of time only.\n\nFollowing what described in the present section a suggested setting to import workload metrics would be:\n\nOne (or more) ETL importing all data except the workloads. This can be achieved by specifying an empty workload list in the \"Tivoli – Workloads\" tab of the run configuration page. Set this ETL to \"Update hierarchy (track entities and remove from the tree if not imported)\", so that dismissed entities are removed from BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization tree once not present any more in Tivoli\n\nOne (or more) ETL importing only workloads. This can be achieved by setting \"Import workload data only\" in the \"Tivoli – Data Selection\" tab to \"yes\". Set this ETL to \"Only add imported entities\", so that \"intermittent\" workloads remain visible under the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization tree\n\nThis configuration also helps balancing the tasks load.\n\nSupported Platforms\n\nMoviri Integrator for TrueSight Capacity Optimization connector supports following platforms and BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization Entity Types:\n\nSupported platforms:\n\nStandalone OS Instance\n\nAIX Power VM Hosts and LPARs\n\nSolaris Containers\n\nSupported BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization Entity Type:\n\nSystem (Generic)\n\nAIX LPAR\n\nAIX SPLPAR\n\nAIX Virtual Host\n\nSolaris Zone\n\nSolaris Virtual Host\n\nResource Pool\n\nSupported metrics are listed in Appendix A. Configuration and Performance Metrics Mapping\n\nManaging Virtual Farm Views\n\nAIX Virtual Farm\n\nThe AIX Virtual Farm is a built-in BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization view that allows you to manage the capacity of a virtualized infrastructure running IBM LPAR and WPAR based virtualization system. It presents key capacity metrics and charts for LPARs and frames. You can use AIX views to see the total capacity, used capacity, remaining capacity and growth trend for CPU and memory sub-systems. Refer to the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization documentation for further details.\n\nThe AIX Virtual Farm view enables you to identify:\n\nwhich host should the new domains be added to\n\nwhether certain hosts require a better load balancing between them\n\nwhich systems in a particular domain have exceeded their threshold values\n\nThe present connector is designed to integrate the required metrics that lets you leverage this view capabilities.\n\nPowerVM View\n\nThe PowerVM View tab provides an overview of all available hosts in the AIX virtualization environment.\n\nThe following figure shows the PowerVM View tab displaying all Frames present in the Moviri domain.\n\nPowerVM Partitions View\n\nThe PowerVM Partitions View tab provides an overview of the available partitions in the AIX virtualization environment, including details about online processors, CPU and memory utilization, memory configured, and more.\n\nThe following figure shows the PowerVM Partitions View tab.\n\nThe PowerVM Partitions table lists all partitions present in the selected PowerVM host. Each row corresponds to a PowerVM partition and shows the following information:\n\nSolaris Virtual Farm View\n\nThe Solaris Virtual Farm is a built-in BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization view that allows you to manage the capacity of a virtualized infrastructure running Solaris based virtualization system. It presents key capacity metrics and charts for Zone hosts and zones. You can use Zone views to see the total capacity, used capacity, remaining capacity and growth trend for CPU and memory sub-systems. Refer to the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization documentation for further details.\n\nThe Solaris Virtual Farm view enables you to identify:\n\nwhich host should the new domains be added to\n\nwhether certain hosts require a better load balancing between them\n\nwhich systems in a particular domain have exceeded their threshold values\n\nThe connector is designed to integrate the metrics required to leverage the view capabilities.\n\nZone Host View\n\nThe Zone Host View tab provides an overview of all available hosts in the Solaris Zone virtualization environment.\n\nThe following figure shows the Zone Host View tab displaying all Host present in the Moviri domain.\n\nThe Zone host table lists all hosts present in the selected domain. Each row corresponds to a zone host and shows the following information:\n\nZone View\n\nThe Zone View tab provides an overview of the available zones in the Solaris virtualization environment, including details about CPU and memory utilization.\n\nThe following figure shows the Zone View tab.\n\nThe Zone table lists all zones present in the selected Zone host. Each row corresponds to a single zone and shows the following information:\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nThe status of the ETLs can be quickly verified from the list under ADMINISTRATION >SCHEDULER >ETL tasks, as in Figure 21.\n\nAs described in the online Administration Guide https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/public/bcmco95/Working+with+ETLs, three exit statuses exist for BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization tasks:\n\nOK - The ETL task completed successfully.\n\nWARNING - It can be generated by a large number of causes (missing or corrupted data, etc.), for which a complete stop of the ETL is not considered necessary.\n\nFAILED - The ETL task was aborted, due for example to a network failure or a bad configured parameter that could prevent an ETL from connecting to a database or mounting a network folder. An example of this is detailed in Figure 22, in which the ETL was configured with wrong access credentials to the database.\n\nThe log shown in Figure 22 can be accessed from the BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimization web interface as shown in Figure 23.\n\nMissing data can also represent a common problem; as shown above, in this case a WARNING would be associated to the ETL task. This can be due to a number of scenarios, among which:\n\nData is not available on Tivoli. In this case, it is recommended to check the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, and to run reports associated to the desired systems and time ranges to check for the existence of data. Possible reasons for their absence might be an erroneous status of the distributed Agents (a correct one is presented in Figure 24) or of the Summarization and Pruning Agent (a correct one is presented in Figure 25), or an incorrect configuration of the data aging period (Section 4.1).\n\nData is available on Tivoli, but the ETL is not able to extract it. For Raw data, this can be due to the lack of overlap of the \"extraction window\" (which starts from the date shown either in the property \"Default Last Counter\", or in the actual lastcounter for that table, and whose timespan is listed in the property \"Max days to import at Raw Resolution\" – please refer to Figure 15 for more details), as shown in Figure 26. In the Figure, the ETL is trying to extract data from March 01 to March 15, in an environment where the data collection was started on March 20. In any case, it is possible to manually run the actual queries used for data collection against the Tivoli DataWarehouse, as they are displayed in the ETL log (when the ETL Log Level is set to 5 – Medium), in order to ascertain the presence of the data in that desired time range.\n\nMoreover, it is strongly recommended to avoid creating an Integration Studio ETL Module with the same name as this ETL (ETL.extractor.ITMME), which would likely cause unexpected behavior.\n\nConfiguration and Performance Metrics Mapping\n\nThe ETL connects to the Tivoli Warehouse instance and extracts data from a set of defined tables. The metrics supported by the ETL are stored in tables populated by the following Tivoli agent “families”:\n\nNT: Windows OS Agent\n\nLZ: Linux OS Agent\n\nKUX: Unix OS Agent\n\nAIX: AIX Premium Agent, CEC Base Agent, HMC Base Agent\n\nBelow, data for the respective “families” are acquired by the ETL. The connector on the basis of reported ones may compute additional BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimizationmetrics.\n\nMetrics with * were previously custom, remapped as standard after v 4.4.00\n\nProcess-level data present in the following tables\n\nKLZ_Process (LZ)\n\nKPX_PROCESSES_DETAIL (AIX)\n\nProcess (KUX)\n\nNT_Process_64 (NT)\n\nWhich are aggregated by the connector to compute the following workload metrics:\n\nW_ALIVE_PROC*\n\nW_CPU_UTIL\n\nW_MEM_ALL (Previously W_MEM_RESIDENT_SIZE_C)\n\nW_MEM_VIRTUAL_SIZE*\n\nW_THREADS*\n\nLookup Fields\n\nMoviri Integrator for BMC TrueSight Capacity Optimizationconnector uses standard BMC TrueSight Capacity OptimizationETL lookup mechanism. One single entry is used as entity identifier: Lookup field = “DEFAULT”. The following table shows, for each supported entity, what information is used as lookup value field.\n\nHere below some lookup tables as example:\n\nObject Relationships\n\nThe ETL arranges the collected systems under a domain of choice. Additionally the following relationships are imported from the datasource:\n\nSolaris Virtual Host contains Solaris Zone\n\nAIX Virtual Host contains Resource Pool\n\nAIX Virtual Host contains AIX LPAR\n\nResource Pool contains AIX SPLPAR\n\nGeneric contains Workload\n\nBMC TrueSight Capacity Optimizationautomatically creates a hierarchy rule associated to the ETL to process the Object-Relationship data."
