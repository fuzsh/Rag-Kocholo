        "text": "Chris O’Connor, Vice President of Development of Tivoli at IBM, discusses changing the name of Tivoli and where the focus is now live inside theCUBE with Wikibon’s Dave Vellante and Stu Miniman from the floor of the recently concluded IBM Edge 2013 in Las Vegas. See the full, archived video of the broadcast below.\n\nChris role at IBM is to help clients optimize their business infrastructures and technology through improved visibility, control, and automation across end-to-end operations. In an internal re-organization, IBM’s Tivoli and its SmartCloud service management offerings are now to be clustered under IBM Cloud & Smarter Infrastructure division. The new division, as per Connor, reflects the evolution of client needs and IBM’s portfolio.\n\nHow IBM is addressing current IT needs\n\nWhile answering to current development in the IT industry and infrastructure in particular, Connor said over the past decade, the infrastructure needs of clients have grown well beyond traditional IT systems management with the accelerated adoption of cloud, mobile, and smarter physical assets. BM has responded by evolving their portfolio to meet these demands, helping clients transform their infrastructures and business models to better achieve desired outcomes.\n\nIn the current economic climate, where enterprises are reluctant to make large capital investments, and the operating expenses model of cloud is shifting towards capital expenditure to operational (from Capex to Opex), which allows companies to stay nimble and spend money wisely in assets for more useful activities (such as data center, cloud etc.).\n\nConnor adds that IBM is extending the reach of its Tivoli systems management product into the hybrid cloud. According to Connor, increasing numbers of organizations are looking to leverage the scale and flexibility of applications, but are concerned about losing control of resources. Hybrid cloud solution can be used for enterprises looking to simplify the integration, security and management of cloud components that combine remote and local services into a hybrid model.\n\nHe then briefed IBM’s SmartCloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) product and its ability to allow the capability for real-time business analytics. IBM is looking at various technologies to improve performance, made possible by virtualizing resources, automating processes and standardizing tasks, and also applies analytics to the infrastructure platforms.\n\n“The convenience of automation offers companies a cost-effective way to gain enterprise-level business functionality. You are going to see a large percentage of environments run on analytics driven, organized sorts of practices and processes,” says Connor.\n\nSee his full segment below."
