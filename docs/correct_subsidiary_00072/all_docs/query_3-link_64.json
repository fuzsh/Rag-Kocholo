Intelliden's intelligent network automation is an important addition to IBM's portfolio to extend automation across all business and IT assets.\"\n\n\"Networks have become a critical part of the overall IT fabric, and organizations are demanding tighter integration and management of the entire infrastructure including applications, storage, servers and networks,\" said Alan Black, president and CEO of Intelliden. \"Intelliden provides leading open, scalable and comprehensive network automation solutions, and this acquisition opens a world of new opportunities for our customers, partners and employees. We are excited to be part of the IBM team to raise the bar by delivering the industry's most advanced IT service management solutions backed by world-class sales, services, support and alliances organizations.\"\n\nIntelliden technology will be integrated into IBM Tivoli Software, which produced revenue growth of 7 percent for 2009.
