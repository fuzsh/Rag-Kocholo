        "text": "NTT Communications Corp. (NTT Com.), IBM Japan Ltd. and Tivoli Systems Inc. announced Tuesday that they have agreed to form a business alliance to promote NTT Com.'s e-business outsourcing services. Clients ranging from large companies to home-based businesses will be offered consultation and design support, as well as services for network building and information technology solutions. In addition, NTT Com. will offer e-business management services for corporate intranet, extranet and Internet servers. NTT Com. President Masanobu Suzuki told a press conference that the telecommunications company is planning to start cultivating online clients in April 2000. IBM Japan will provide server-hosting technology, while Tivoli Systems will contribute software solutions for controlling various platforms and computers it will supply. The business alliance will be in effect for four years, according to Tivoli Systems Chairman and CEO Jan Lindelow. \"Online business is becoming an important tool for companies to increase profits and reduce operating costs,\" said Suzuki, who declined to reveal a sales target. \"We will offer a total service to a company that wants to expand its business and increase sales channels by doing e-business.\""
