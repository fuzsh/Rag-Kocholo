        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas - August 1, 2000 - Tivoli Systems Inc. today announced multiple joint development solutions with Cisco Systems, Inc., the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet, building on the relationship the two companies began last year. Together, Tivoli. and Cisco are delivering complementary technology management solutions, with Cisco managing network resources and Tivoli providing a customer and service-oriented set of tools that offer economic benefits to customers. The joint development work is an extension of Tivoli's Net Generation initiative that assists companies in cutting the cost of service delivery while improving the quality of customers' experiences.\n\n\"The teamwork between Tivoli and Cisco will result in solutions that extend the boundaries of traditional enterprise network and systems management into the area of service providers,\" said Alan Cohen, Cisco's senior marketing director, Communication Software Group.\n\nOne area of immediate focus for Tivoli and Cisco is technology management solutions for enterprise virtual private networks (VPN). The market opportunity for commercial VPNs alone is expected to grow over 1,100% from 2000 though 2003, from $400 million to $5.1 billion, according to Infonetics Research. Tivoli is providing Cisco with monitoring capabilities for IPSec-based VPNs as well as building provisioning management for VPNs into its family of solutions offerings.\n\n\"As market leaders in their respective areas, Tivoli and Cisco are collaborating to equip companies with the tools to rapidly respond to customers' needs and the needs of their networks,\" said Robert Davis, vice president and general manager, Service Provider Business Unit, Tivoli Systems Inc.\n\nTivoli Manager for Network Hardware version 2.2, shipping now, streamlines network management with a single approach to collecting and managing inventory data for multi-vendor networks. It improves systems manager productivity by maintaining system and network inventory data in the same repository and simplifies the deployment of enterprise-wide applications with quick verification of network upgrades.\n\nTivoli Manager for Network Hardware consists of a network inventory application and a set of Tivoli developed device scanners, including one that works with CiscoWorks2000. The CiscoWorks2000 family of network management solutions is targeted at the wide-area and local-area operations of enterprise networks, allowing customers the flexibility to deploy end-to-end network management.\n\nEach Tivoli device scanner collects network inventory information which, when combined with the system configuration information, enables customers to manage their entire enterprise inventory from a single point. The stored data can be accessed easily by a robust set of relational database queries provided with Tivoli Manager for Network Hardware. This offers critical configuration information on the current capacity of the network devices for adding users, mission critical applications, and for performing asset management.\n\nTivoli is providing measurement applications for use in CiscoWorks2000 Service Management Solution (SMS). SMS provides an integrated combination of Cisco hardware and software for users to validate their service level agreements describing wide area connections and network services. The software allows network administrators to define service-level contracts and the service-level agreements associated with them, and to create both business and technical reports at a summary or detailed level.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nTivoli Manager for Network Hardware became generally available on June 30, 2000. Pricing is based on each network's complexity starting at $6200.\n\nAbout Tivoli Systems Inc.\n\nTivoli software manages the foundations of e-business, extending the boundaries of traditional network and systems management from the data center across the Internet, from the desktop to pervasive devices. Leading companies around the world use Tivoli software, Tivoli Ready third-party products and Team Tivoli partner services to reduce the cost and complexity of managing heterogeneous IT environments.
