        "text": "IBM Corp. has agreed to buy small, privately held application management software maker Cyanea Systems Corp. for an undisclosed sum, the companies said Thursday. IBM plans to add Cyanea’s application development and management technology to its Tivoli systems management software portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition fits the IBM software group’s pattern of buying its partners to boost its infrastructure technology. Three-year-old Cyanea already works closely with IBM, and its flagship product, Cyanea/One, is resold by IBM under the name WebSphere Studio Application Monitor.\n\nIBM expects Cyanea’s five employees to join IBM, with Cyanea Chief Executive Officer James Chong becoming IBM’s vice president of application management.\n\nOakland, California-based Cyanea is also a partner of BEA Systems Inc. Chong said he expects to continue supporting rivals to IBM’s WebSphere platform, including BEA’s WebLogic Platform.\n\n“Application management is application management. We’re platform agnostic,” he said. “We’ll support .Net as well.”\n\nIBM plans to release a road map for Cyanea’s technology within the next two months. IBM expects to use Cyanea’s technology in its Rational and WebSphere lines, as well as in Tivoli, said IBM executive Robert LeBlanc, who is wrapping up his tenure as general manager of Tivoli and taking over as the WebSphere group’s leader.\n\n“We can take the technology we’ve got, and with Candle, we think we’ve got the capability here to build out a tool set for really end-to-end application management,” LeBlanc said.\n\nThe largest acquisition of the past year by IBM’s US$14 billion software group was Candle Corp., a well-known management software vendor. It has also scooped up a handful of smaller software companies, such as analytics developer Alphablox Corp., data synchronization specialist Trigo Technologies Inc. and integration software maker CrossAccess Corp."
