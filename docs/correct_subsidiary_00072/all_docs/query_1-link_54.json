        "text": "When Robert LeBlanc was named general manager of IBM’s Tivoli Software Group in June 2001, Steve Mills, IBM senior vice president and group executive, made his priorities clear: He wanted to see a more efficient and profitable Tivoli — fast. Here’s more of Computerworld‘s interview with LeBlanc about his work at Tivoli and what lies ahead for the company. What was your vision for Tivoli when you took over the helm, and how has it changed? Coming in, I had spent a lot of time in the software business — I had run the strategy for the division in IBM. So I had a fair sense of what value propositions it had, what challenges it faced. The first thing I did was take a page out of [former IBM CEO] Lou Gerstner’s book: I visited 60 customers in 60 days. And I asked them, “Where are we strong, what value do we provide, and what areas do we need to focus on and improve?” They were very direct about their frustrations in dealing with Tivoli and support, about quality and the deployability of the software. It took too long to get it fully deployed; it was too frustrating. When it was fully deployed, the customer got a lot of value, and their satisfaction level went way up. So where did you start making changes? We had a lot of products, but it wasn’t clear how they fit a strategy. The answer was that we didn’t have a clear strategy. So the first focus we had was to get back to our core business — systems management for the enterprise — and develop a strategy based on four areas of systems management: configuration and operations, performance and availability, security management, and storage management. We had had 150 products. To sell and maintain 150 products is very difficult. Now we have 50 that represent a core set of products. What tasks have you accomplished? What ones remain to be completed? If I were to look at it in phases, I’d say Phase 1 was understanding the marketplace and where the customer pain is and articulate our strategy. That was the first six months.\n\nThe next six months was to plan what capital we would need to accomplish it, to improve the quality of our core product, increase customer satisfaction and add new technology. The third six months we articulated where the technology is going and made strategic investments. Phase 4, the next six months, is execution of what we’ve laid out. What’s next? We have a two-year plan. Execution of the rest of that plan is what’s next. We’ll continue to develop the next generation of systems management. When I look at the current way of managing systems, it’s very reactionary: When the server goes down, you take action. That’s too late. We want to get to it before it goes down. You need to view the end-to-end entity from an applications view. You can say you have 99.999% availability of your server, but it doesn’t mean anything to the business if your database is down. We’re looking at how to manage and maintain your service-level agreements based on a business view. We’re starting to integrate that view so systems management with Tivoli will become more predictive and proactive. How, specifically, does that work? Partly, we’re using a DB2 data warehouse to capture environmental information specific to the customer’s environment and extrapolate from that data to predict, based on the history of that customer’s systems, that this server may fail or that you’ll need more storage for a particular application. Where has your greatest challenge been? The biggest set of challenges is the speed with which the market has changed. It means you’re always aiming at a moving target. But I think we’re getting there — the first three quarters of this year have been very positive. At the end of the day, it’s all about the customer and solving customer problems. And we go back to the customers we saw in those first 60 days to check on how we’re doing, because the discussion we’d have today would be very different than that of 18 months ago. That’s why I’m focused, even maniacally focused, on the customer."
