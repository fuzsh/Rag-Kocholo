        "text": "'); //-->\n\nWorld Media Digest\n\nTivoli back on track\n\nLORI HAWKINS,\n\nCox News Service\n\nAUSTIN, Texas _ The tough love that began three years ago at Tivoli Software is paying off.\n\nUnhappy with the Austin-based division's performance and undisciplined culture, IBM Corp. started to shake things up.\n\nOnce a problem child, Tivoli now is a bright spot for IBM.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2004, it posted 25 percent revenue growth from a year earlier, the best among IBM's software units. Tivoli's software helps companies manage large computer networks.\n\nThe relationship between Tivoli and IBM has been a work in progress. When Tivoli agreed to be acquired by IBM in 1996, it wanted a hands-off approach. IBM obliged for years, looking the other way while Tivoli called its own shots on marketing and software development.\n\nBut it wasn't working. Tivoli had rushed products to market, and its technology had developed a reputation for being hard to deploy and use, analysts and IBM executives say.\n\n\"A lot of customers at the time were thinking about throwing Tivoli out. It was that bad,\" says Donna Scott, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner Inc.\n\nIt was time for some changes. To make them, IBM sent veteran manager Robert LeBlanc to Austin in the middle of 2001.\n\n\"When I arrived, it was almost like Tivoli was in a funk,\" LeBlanc said in 2002. \"Some within IBM were questioning whether Tivoli even fit in with IBM's strategy. My job was to revitalize and refocus Tivoli and get it back to big growth.\"\n\nLeBlanc tapped into IBM's worldwide sales force and research and development strengths, which Tivoli had mostly ignored.\n\nHe simplified its sprawling product line, reducing it from more than 140 products to fewer than 50. And in an effort to improve communication, he moved Tivoli workers from their longtime home in Northwest Austin to cubes in the heart of IBM country on Burnet Road.\n\nTivoli's headcount in Austin is down slightly, from about 1,200 workers in 2002 to 1,000 now.\n\nWorldwide, however, employment is about 4,500, up from 4,000 in 2002.\n\nAt its peak five years ago, Tivoli had 2,000 workers in Austin and 5,000 around the globe.\n\nLeBlanc's changes salvaged the merger and positioned Tivoli for a new wave of growth, say industry analysts and IBM executives.\n\n\"We had a really strong fourth quarter and a really successful 2004,\" says Al Zollar, another longtime IBM executive who replaced LeBlanc as general manager in July. \"Robert did a great job of integrating Tivoli into IBM's business strategies. My job is to keep that going and take it as far as we can.\"\n\nTivoli's competitors, namely Houston-based BMC Software Inc., Computer Associates International Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., are making that job easier.\n\nEarlier this month, BMC reported a sharp decline in software license bookings in its most recent quarter and a lower-than-expected earnings forecast. Meanwhile, Computer Associates is emerging from an accounting scandal that led to the indictment of its former CEO in September, and H-P is in a state of turmoil after firing CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nTivoli already dominates the systems management market, with 35 percent market share, according to Gartner. Its closest competitors are BMC, with an 11.2 percent share and Computer Associates, at 10.6 percent.\n\n\"Tivoli is in a great position right now,\" says Richard Ptak, an industry analyst with Ptak, Noel & Associates. After a difficult few years, when many corporations put purchases on hold, demand for Tivoli's offerings, systems management, identity management and storage, is gaining strength, he said.\n\nTivoli was the company that showed Austin how startups work. Today, it's an example of how entrepreneurial companies must be willing to evolve to survive.\n\nFounded in 1989 by two former IBM programmers, the company created groundbreaking software for managing large computer networks.\n\nAt the time, software startups _ and the idea of quitting your day job to take a chance on something that might fail spectacularly _ were novelties in Austin. Tivoli was the place to go if you wanted to take risks. IBM, a staid group by comparison, gave Tivoli lots of space for five years after the merger. Tech acquisitions fail more often than then succeed, and culture clashes often are the culprit.\n\nTivoli, however, suffered from limbo. It was a unit that wasn't independent but also wasn't connected to its owner.\n\n\"IBM didn't want to ruin the spark and the sense of urgency that Tivoli had, but it got out of hand,\" says Scott, the Gartner analyst. \"Finally, when their customers started screaming, that's when they realized they had a problem.\"\n\nTivoli was fixable. But it would take work.\n\n\"You don't wake up one day and say, 'Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's integrate,' \" says Wally Casey, Tivoli's vice president of worldwide sales, who joined Tivoli in 1999 from IBM. \"It's a long process. It's not without bumps.\"\n\nThe first task was to unite Tivoli workers with their IBM counterparts and integrate Tivoli's software into IBM's big-picture strategy of \"on demand\" technology. Moving Tivoli workers to the Austin IBM campus was more than symbolic: It put them in the center of world-class researchers as well as a sales force that was selling IBM products but rarely Tivoli software. Tivoli developers began to tap into IBM labs, and its salespeople joined forces with IBM teams.\n\nBefore the move, it was common for a hardware salesperson to set up one meeting with a customer and a Tivoli salesperson to set up a second meeting to discuss how to make the hardware work with the software.\n\n\"Now it's one meeting with one IBM team,\" Casey says. \"We approach it as trying to solve the customer's problem, not just selling a software piece or a hardware piece of a solution.\"\n\nWith the integration complete, Zollar's job is to push Tivoli forward, analysts say.\n\n\"Now that they've fixed the basics, it's time to look at product innovation and bringing their customers to the next stage,\" Scott says.\n\n\"The complexity of the overall product set is still very high. There's demand for something easier, more out-of-the-box. They're not done by any stretch of the imagination. But they're on the right track.\"\n\nLori Hawkins writes for the Austin American-Statesman.
