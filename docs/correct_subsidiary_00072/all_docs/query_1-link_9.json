        "text": "IBM (IBM) management software subsidiary Tivoli Systems next week will add new capabilities to make it easier for large networks to manage the distribution of information, such as widely disseminated reports.\n\nThe new software, consisting of a module that integrates into Tivoli's TME 10 enterprise management suite and a standalone application, essentially acts as a central point of control and management for publishing business reports. This type of software is important when airlines are sending passenger manifests to various gates in an airport, for example.\n\nTivoli purchased the technology as part of the $170 million acquisition of Unison Software, announced in September. The company specializes in software for scheduling network-based computing and administrative jobs.\n\nPaul Mason, an analyst with International Data Corporation, said the output management capabilities acquired in the Unison acquisition were incidental to the company's core strength in scheduling software. The new tools do give Tivoli an edge in the checklist of management capabilities against competitors such as Computer Associates, he said.\n\nTME 10 Output Manager integrates into Tivoli's larger management scheme, allowing administrators to use Java-based interfaces to automate policies and report delivery. An administrator, for example, can set rules as to how a report is delivered to a marketing department. A standalone application called Tivoli Destiny offers similar functions.\n\nPhil Sheridan, product line manager at Tivoli, said the software has previously focused on mainframes and is now coming down to support distributed systems running popular client- and server-based applications."
