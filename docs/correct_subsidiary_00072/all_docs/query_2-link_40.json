        "text": "Tivoli, Intel Collaborate To Make Intel LAN Adapters Tivoli-Ready\n\nCustomers to Gain Instant Manageability on Intel-based Desktops, Servers, and Mobile Platforms\n\nATLANTA, Ga. and HILLSBORO, Ore., Oct. 21, 1998 -- Tivoli Systems Inc. and Intel Corporation announced today an agreement to ship the Tivoli Management Agent on IntelÂ® 10/100-megabits-per-second (Mbps) desktop, server and mobile LAN adapters.\n\nNew and existing Intel-based desktop and server platforms with Intel 10/100-Mbps LAN adapters will become instantly manageable by Tivoli software when added to a customers' computing environment. This results in customers saving significant time and costs when deploying manageable devices throughout their company.\n\n\"Speed in deploying management products is a critical component in enabling IT environments to serve as a competitive weapon,\" said Leo Cole, director of Tivoli's Network Management development. \"Today's announcement enhances the ability of Intel and Tivoli customers to quickly load agents on PCs and servers, adding precious time to their day to work on more pressing business issues.\"\n\n\"Intel and Tivoli have long recognized the need for solutions that allow customers to better manage their desktops,\" said Greg Lang, business unit manager for Intel's Network Products Division. \"Customers implementing Tivoli-based management capabilities should experience a significant reduction in both the cost and time associated with deploying manageable solutions.\"\n\nThe new agreement combines Intel's strength in networking hardware with Tivoli's leadership in enterprise management. Customers gain access via the Tivoli Management Agent and Intel network adapters to management activities such as software distribution, inventory, user administration, and distributed monitoring across multiple platforms.\n\nCustomers gain significant productivity advantages through the Tivoli Management Agent's \"One-Touch Management\" capability. The Tivoli Management Agent is both self-installing and self-updating so customers never have to manually manage the agent again.\n\nThe Tivoli Management Agent is also available on all personal computers which meet the Intel-led Wired for Management (WfM) baseline specification. Other leading companies, including IBM and Microsoft, also offer the Tivoli Management Agent in their products.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe Tivoli Management Agent will be available for download from Intel's Web site, www.intel.com, in early November. Intel 10/100-Mbps mobile adapters will be Tivoli-ready in 1999.\n\nTivoli Systems Inc. provides the industry's leading open, highly scaleable and cross-platform management solutions that span networks, systems, applications, and business-to-business e-commerce. Leading companies around the world use Tivoli software and compatible third-party products to reduce the cost and complexity of managing networks, systems, databases and applications.
