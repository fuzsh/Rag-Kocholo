        "text": "HILLSBORO, ORE. and AUSTIN, TEXAS, April 27 , 1998 - Personal computers based on the Intel-led and industry-supported Wired for Management (WFM) Baseline specification now will be \"Tivoli-Ready,\" Intel Corporation and Tivoli Systems Inc. announced today. \"Tivoli-Ready\" means that Intel® Architecture-based workstations, desktops and laptops can be managed \"out-of-the-box\" by Tivoli Management Software. This is achieved by the automatic downloading and installation of a Tivoli Management Agent when the PC is initially installed, reducing the manual effort required to get new PCs online and managed.\n\n\"Tivoli and Intel have long recognized the importance of integrating leading desktop and enterprise management solutions,\" said Will Swope, vice president of Intel's Business Platform Group. \"This new capability takes another step in realizing the goal of the Wired for Management initiative to support interoperable management for PCs.\"\n\n\"Tivoli and Intel recognize that the greatest pain for customers is the cost and difficulty associated with installing agents on tens of thousands of desktops and mobile computers,\" said Martin Neath, senior vice president of Tivoli's Product Group. \"By automating the installation of our management agents on PCs, we've eliminated the time and expense associated with loading CDs on PCs in order to manage them.\"\n\nThis announcement extends Tivoli's support of the Wired for Management Baseline specification, a widely-supported set of industry guidelines that define a common level of manageability for PCs. More than two dozen of the industry's leading hardware manufacturers now have Wired for Management-enabled PCs available.\n\nThe two companies also announced they are working towards improving the management capabilities of legacy, or non WFM-enabled, PCs later in 1998.\n\nWell-Managed IT environment: How it Works The Tivoli Management Agent can be automatically installed on a new WFM-enabled PC in one of two ways. In the first scenario, the PC uses its built-in pre-boot execution Environment (PXE) inherent in the WFM Baseline specification to locate a PXE server on the network to access the Tivoli Management Agent. Or, PCs that ship with Intel's LANDesk® Client Manager v3.3 can locate a Tivoli server on the network and automatically download the agent.\n\nOnce the PC has the Tivoli Management Agent installed, Tivoli Management functions are instantly available.\n\nThe WFM Baseline specification offers the following capabilities:\n\nAsset management - Built-in instrumentation identifies the internal contents of a system, including hardware and software components as well as static and dynamic data such as the amount of memory in use.\n\nNew system setup - The service boot feature makes it possible to configure or reconfigure a system remotely, even with a blank hard disk drive.\n\nOff-hours maintenance - This remote wake-up feature gives technicians the ability to run maintenance tasks remotely during off hours.\n\nReduced power consumption - Built-in power management reduces the computer's use of power, allowing it to go to a low-power sleep state, and lowers the cost of operating the system.\n\nTivoli customers can extend the value of the above WFM Baseline capabilities in their Tivoli Managed Environment to also include:\n\nDeployment Management - Automatically manages software configuration across the enterprise from a single central location; a complete solution for managing initial installation and subsequent upgrades.\n\nAvailability Management - Ensures reliable, predictable user access to key applications and computing resources\n\nSecurity Management - Provides comprehensive protection of mission-critical applications and information assets by offering complete control of user accounts and system security services\n\nOperations Management - Provides management tools to automate routine administrative tasks, including job scheduling, storage, remote system management, remote system control and help desk transactions\n\nApplications Management - Improves application availability and performance, increases end-user satisfaction and productivity, lowers IT costs by streamlining problem isolation and resolution, and creates a tighter fit between IT and the business\n\nProduct Availability\n\nTivoli will provide documentation on adding the PXE server capability free of charge on its web site, www.tivoli.com, this summer. Intel's LANDesk Client Manager Version 3.3 begins shipping to PC OEMs in May.\n\nAbout Tivoli Systems Tivoli Systems Inc., provides TME 10, the industry's leading solution for end-to-end management of distributed computing environments, from mobile computers to mainframes. Thousands of companies around the globe use TME 10 and compatible third-party products to reduce the cost and complexity of managing networks, systems, databases and applications.
