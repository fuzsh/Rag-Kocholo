        "text": "IBM may have lost some of its resonance but it is still a global force to be reckoned with – especially after jettisoning its hardware business to focus on innovative software and consulting services. Will the giant stay vibrant?\n\nIn 2004, IBM announced amidst global surprise that it was selling its PC business to Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is partially owned by the Chinese government, for $650 million in cash and $600 million in Lenovo stock. The reason: IBM’s hardware division was bleeding red ink. Under successive CEOs, IBM’s laptops and desktops – and mainframes– had become the victims of low-cost Asian PC makers. IBM was increasingly focusing on its consulting and services business. Selling its flagship hardware division, though emotionally wrenching, made eminent business sense.\n\nThe deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States in March 2005, and was completed in May 2005. IBM now has a 19 percent stake in Lenovo, which under agreement moved its headquarters to New York State and appointed an IBM executive as its CEO. IBM revenue from continuing operations meanwhile increased 8 percent over the preceding year to $96.5 billion, while income from continuing operations increased 11 percent to $8.4 billion. The company’s 329,009 employees and 660,628 shareholders know that despite the sell-off of its PC division, consulting and services are where the global action and profits are. In them lies IBM’s future.\n\nTHE PAST\n\nThe company that became International Business Machines Corporation was incorporated in 1911. It is one of America’s most iconic information technology companies and a weathercock of the state of health of the US IT industry.\n\nBig Blue, as it is more commonly known, is headquartered in Armonk, NY. IBM is the biggest information technology company in the world. It holds more patents than any other tech company. It ranks no. 10 in the Fortune 500. Its software services and consulting future is inextricably linked with Asia’s IT powerhouses and its own extraordinary hardware past.\n\nIn the course of 118 years, surviving a World War and the Great Depression, IBM is testimony to innovative thinking and daring decisions by its top management. IBM began with an extraordinary set of ideas and products and the company has gradually morphed itself into a provider of custom-made services to its customers.\n\nIBM’s history dates decades before the development of electronic computers. Before modern computers were invented, IBM developed punched card data processing equipment. The genesis of IBM has a fascinating preface: in 1890, during the zenith of the industrial boom, the US was experiencing a high rate of immigration.The census bureau realized that its traditional methods of counting would be inadequate and sponsored a contest to find a more efficient means of tabulating census data. The winner was Herman Hollerith, a German immigrant, who then formed the Tabulating Machine Co. in 1896.\n\nIn 1911, Charles R. Flint, a noted trust organizer, engineered the merger of Hollerith’s company with two others, Computing Scale Co. of America and International Time Recording Co. The combined Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., or CTR manufactured and sold machinery which ranged from commercial scales and industrial time recorders to meat and cheese slicers as well as tabulators and punch cards. Based in New York City, the company had 1,300 employees in its offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York, Dayton, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Toronto, Canada.\n\nThe rules of industry were changing rapidly and Flint realized that it was time to look for some outside help. He turned to a former executive at the National Cash Register Co. (NCR), Thomas J. Watson. In 1914, Watson, age 40, joined the company as general manager.\n\nWatson was born in Campbell, New York. His formal education consisted of a course in the Elmira School of Commerce. His first job was at the age of 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley’s Market in Painted Post, New York. Later Watson sold sewing machines and musical instruments before joining NCR as a salesman in Buffalo. Eventually, he worked his way up to general sales manager. When Watson took over, the company had less than 400 employees.\n\nWatson had the mind of an innovator. He knew that the success of a fledgling company hinged on the people who represented it and their clients. He gave employees generous sales incentives and insisted on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen. Watson boosted company spirit with an employee sports teams, family outings and a company band. He preached a positive outlook. His favorite slogan, “THINK,” became a mantra for CTR’s employees.\n\nWatson also stressed the importance of the customer, understing that the success of the client translated into the success of his company. Within 11 months of joining the company, Watson became president. The company’s focus was on providing large-scale, custom-built tabulating solutions for businesses. It left the market for small office products to others.\n\nDuring Watson’s first four years, revenues doubled to $2 million. He also expanded the company’s operations to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. In 1917, CTR entered the Canadian market under the name of International Business Machines Co., Limited. In 1924, to reflect CTR’s growing worldwide presence, its name was changed to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). An icon was born.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, IBM managed to grow while the rest of the US economy floundered. This was basically due to IBM’s policy of taking care of its employees. IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance in 1934, survivor benefits in 1935, and paid vacations in 1936.\n\nWith great foresight Watson saw that when the depression was over there would be great institutional demand for machines. So while other companies were laying off workers and shutting down, IBM continued to produce new machines and created a large inventory of equipment. In 1935, IBM was ready. The Social Security Act brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. It was called “the biggest accounting operation of all time,” and other government departments quickly followed.\n\nIn 1939, with the advent of World War II, IBM began concentrating on expanding its product line to include bombsights, rifles and engine parts. Watson set a nominal one percent profit on those products and used the money to establish a fund for widows and orphans of IBM war casualties.\n\nThe WW II brought both opportunities and threats. Watson converted the burgeoning war demand for machine computation to IBM’s enduring advantage. In 1944, IBM co-sponsored the Mark I computer together with Harvard University, the first machine to compute long calculations automatically. It was over 50 feet long, 8 feet high, and weighed almost 5 tons. The Mark I took less than a second to solve an addition problem, but about six seconds for multiplication and twice as long for division, much slower than any pocket calculator today. By that time Watson, ever the visionary, had already begun to groom his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., for a bigger role in what was destined to be a bigger company.\n\nIBM introduced its Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) in 1948. It was 120 feet long. Four years later Remington Rand Corporation launched a machine which was much faster. The pressure on IBM mounted to anufacture better, smaller and faster computers. With a lot of pressure from his son Thomas, Watson put the company’s resources behind developing the new technology.\n\nIn 1952, as the US economy expanded, the company introduced the IBM 701, the first large computer based on the vacuum tube. These tubes were quicker, smaller, and more easily replaceable than the electromechanical switches in the Mark I. The 701 executed 17,000 instructions per second. It was used primarily for government and research work. Vacuum tubes rapidly moved computers into business applications including billing, payroll and inventory control.\n\nNEW LEADERSHIP\n\nA new generation of IBM leadership oversaw the period of rapid technological change. After nearly forty years as IBM’s chief executive, Thomas Watson, in 1952, passed the title of president on to his son, Thomas Watson Jr. Arthur K. Watson built the World Trade Corporation and handled IBM’s foreign operations. He built the company into such a dominating force that by the 1960s, it had installed 90 percent of the computers in Europe.\n\nAs Thomas Jr. had said in 1952: “ In the history of IBM, technological innovation wasn’t the thing that made us successful. Unhappily there were many times we came in second. But technology turned out to be less important that sales and distribution methods. We constantly outsold people who had better technology, because we knew how to put the story before the customer, how to install machines successfully and how to hang on to customers once we had them.”\n\nIn 1956, a significant upgrade to the 701 appeared. The IBM 704 was considered the world’s first supercomputer and the first machine to incorporate floating-point hardware. By 1960, the 7090 computer became the fastest computer in the world. IBM was dominating the mainframe and minicomputer market for the next twenty years with its 700 series.\n\nJust as Watson Sr. saw the company’s future in tabulators rather than scales and meat slicers, ThomasJr. foresaw the role computers would play in business. It was a shrewd innovator’s mind at work, reading the curve ahead of everybody else. He led the company’s transformation from a medium-sized maker of tabulating equipment and typewriters to an industrial giant aimed at the emerging business computing market. During his stewardship, revenue grew from $900 million to $8 billion, and the number of employees rose from 72,500 to a gargantuan 270,000.\n\nIBM was the largest of the eight major computer companies ahead of UNIVAC, Burroughs, Scientific Data Systems, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, RCA and Honeywell through most of the 1960s. On April 7, 1964, IBM introduced the System/360, the first large family of computers to use interchangeable software and peripheral equipment. It was extremely innovative for its time as it gave customers the choice to upgrade parts of their hardware as and when they wanted. It was a risky move for IBM and Fortune magazine dubbed it as IBM’s $5 billion gamble. But again, Watson had read the incipient trend well and the System/360 was a big hit.\n\nIn 1969, IBM made another bold move that changed the computer industry for ever: it began o sell hardware, services and software individually. This gave birth to the multibillion-dollar software and consulting services industries. Today IBM is the world leader in both industries.\n\nThomas Jr. stepped down as CEO in 1971 and T. Vincent Learson and Frank T. Cary took over the company’s management in 1973. Watson served as US ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1979 to 1981 and remained a member of IBM’s board of directors until 1984.\n\nNEW EXPANSION\n\nThe computer industry was about to expand and weave its way into everyday life. During Cary’s tenure, IBM introduced the floppy disk in 1971. In 1973, IBM computers could be found at supermarket checkouts and banks. Until the early-1980s, IBM was an example of a vertically integrated corporation. Almost all stages of design, production and commercialization of computers remained internal to the firm. IBM was the world leader in computer manufacturing and it seemed that the company’s leadership position would remain unchallenged for many years.\n\nJohn R. Opel was appointed CEO in 1981, a decade that would be transformational for the computing industry. It was the beginning of a new era in IBM. While IBM did not invent the personal computer, its IBM PC soon became the industry standard. The IBM PC was introduced on August 12, 1981, and the IBM brand entered homes, small businesses and schools. Demand was burgeoning from these segments and IBM continued to stay ahead of the sociotechnological curve that engenders innovation.\n\nWhen designing the PC, IBM for the first time contracted the production of its components to outside companies. The processor chip came from Intel, while the operating system, DOS, came from Microsoft. In those two moves, IBM had created two future info-tech giants.\n\nIn 1985, Opel was succeeded by John F. Akers as CEO. His focus was to streamline operations. IBM’s typewriter, keyboard, and printer division was sold to the investment firm of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. and became an independent company, Lexmark Inc. Over the next few years IBM concentrated its efforts on R&D. This produced four Nobel Prize winners in physics, achieved break throughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications, and made great strides in expanding computing capabilities. The IBM local area network, introduced in 1985, gave PC users a new way to exchange information and share printers and files within a building or complex.\n\nBut trouble lurked around the corner. Since the position of IBM had been unchallenged for so many years, even decades, it had not developed a strategy to cope with fierce competition. UNIX soon became the next big thing, rather than personal computing, and IBM was under serious attack. UNIX was an open operating system, supported by Sun and Hewlett-Packard, which offered customers the first attractive alternative to IBM’s mainframe computers.\n\nAt the same time, IBM’s revenues began dipping. With all its foresight IBM, had missed some strong changes in the environment. In the 1980s and 1990s, companies changed purchasing patterns. It was no longer one individual who took the decision but a complete department. As IBM had always strived for one-on-one personal relations with its buyers, it found this difficult to deal with.\n\nIBM also displayed myopia by underplaying the role PC’s would have in the work environment. As IBM had given control over the operating system to Microsoft in the early-1980s and over the microprocessor to Intel, by the early-1990s IBM’s leadership position started to crumble.\n\nIndeed from 1987, its stock price dropped by more than a fourth, from almost $170 to a low of $40 by late- 1993. The company’s annual net losses reached a record $8 billion. Louis V. Gerstner Jr. arrived as IBM’s chairman and CEO on April 1, 1993, and he had the difficult task to transform crisis-ridden IBM in such a way that it could regain its competitive position. Gerstner brought with him a customer-oriented sensibility and strategic-thinking expertise. The company soon began to tap into the passions of its senior managers for an outpour of new ideas.\n\nENTERING THE INTERNET ERA\n\nThe Internet emerged as a major force in the mid-1990s. It brought customers who valued companies that could provide software solutions, and embed technology into the processes of enterprises. Another major change in usage in the decade was the emergence of the networked model of computing. IBM realized that computing infrastructure and software was the future. IBM forged ahead in spite of the difficulty to find a marketplace insight for a market that does not exist.\n\nDespite mounting pressure to split IBM into separate, independent companies, Gerstner decided to keep the company together. He recognized that one of IBM’s enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers. Splitting the company would have destroyed a unique IBM advantage. So it was only logical that IBM should turn its attention toward services and software, and in addition the company decided to sell and license leading-edge technology to its competitors. Vertical integration, Gerstner decided, was the way forward. He was to prove right – for a while.\n\nDavid Grossman, a computer programmer, and John Patrick, an IBM strategist, formed an Internet group. They hired employees from divisions across IBM, bundling all web technology that people had been working on in the company. IBM’s first showcases came in 1994 with IBM’s Global Network as the world’s largest Internet Service provider and a Web browser that preceded Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft’s Explorer.\n\nThat year IBM acquired Lotus Development Corp. The year after it acquired Tivoli Systems Inc. Services became the fastest-growing segment of the company, its growth was at more than 20 percent a year. In the period between 1993 and 1996, the market value of the company increased by more than $50 billion. Had IBM rediscovered the elixir of youth?\n\nIn May 1997, IBM dramatically demonstrated the PC’s entertainment potential with Deep Blue, a computer programmed to play chess at world-class level. In a sixgame match in New York, Deep Blue defeated World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov. It was the first time a computer had beaten a top-ranked chess player in tournament play.\n\nNETWORKING STRATEGIES\n\nIBM gradually employed networking strategies in a variety of Internet-related products and services. It introduced services such as Internet browsers, ThinkPads, WebSphere and other e-business applications. Though IBM still concentrated on computer hardware and software, the focus of attention was slowly shifting to Internet and e-business solutions.\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, IBM stood on the threshold of the new century. It has reestablished itself as a leading information technology innovator. So in a relatively short period of time – less than a decade – IBM had managed to change from a laggard to a leader in global Internet services. This was achieved through internal organizational transformation as well as through a new portfolio of networking strategies.\n\nIn 2000, IBM received the US National Medal of Technology for the company’s record of innovation in storage technology. IBM’s revenue climbed to $85.09 billion, and net earnings spurted to $8.1 billion. IBM was back. This also marked the seventh time that IBM had received this award, more than any other company or organization. Suddenly, IBM seemed infused with new energy and urgency.\n\nAll through 2001, IBM kept turning out one innovative product after another. The company was the first to mass-produce computer hard disk drives. It used a revolutionary new type of magnetic coating that is expected to eventually quadruple the data density of current hard disk drive products. In December 2002, Gerstner Jr., was succeeded as CEO by Samuel J. Palmisano. At the same time in a move critically important to IBM’s future and changing business profile from a PC maker to a service power house, IBM acquired Pricewaterhouse Coopers’ global business consulting and technology services unit, PwC Consulting. The transaction gave IBM an unmatched capability to help customers with specific business solutions and to exploit world-class technology for improved business performance. The company also launched a new services business, IBM Engineering & Technology Services that focused on helping companies across a variety of industries.\n\nIBM introduced a first-of-its-kind initiative, the IBM On Demand Community, in 2003. This program has trained employees with valuable IBM technology tools targeted for non-profit community organizations and schools in over 90 locations around the world. By linking IBM’s tradition of community service with its on-demand business strategy, the company created a new model for helping employees improve the communities where they lived and worked.\n\nShorn of its hardware business, IBM last year plunged into the big boom market of the future: mobile computing. In a joint R&D operation by IBM, Sony Corporation, Sony Group and Toshiba Corporation, IBM developed a cell phone microprocessor. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company meanwhile selected IBM to create an ondemand technology infrastructure to automate many IT tasks and increase system performance.\n\nAt the same time, in keeping with its streak of innovations for the thirteenth consecutive year, IBM earned more US patents than any other company. The 2,941 patents issued to IBM in 2005 were from the innovative work done by its army of more than 4,500 scientists and engineers.\n\nIBM: MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPLES\n\nFollowing the sale of its hardware division to China’s Lenovo, IBM operates in three segments: Systems and Financing, Software, and Services.\n\nIBM’s resurgent success has often been attributed to its being a customer-centric business culture. Traditionally, the company has stressed customer needs and how to anticipate them. This has led to a special work culture based on knowing what the customer wants, helping them use the product and providing outstanding after sales.\n\nAs Louis V. Gerstner Jr., ex-CEO of IBM, says: “Until I came to IBM, I probably would have told you that culture was just one among several important elements in any organization’s make-up and success – along with vision, strategy, marketing, financials, and the like… I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect of the game, it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value.”\n\nTalking about the relationship IBM had with its users, Bob Gill, an author, says: “IBM customers are the least vulnerable, the least likely to switch. While customers of Hewlett-Packard and Sun are among the most [likely to].” With 330,000 employees worldwide and revenues of $91 billion annually, IBM is one of the few companies with a history that dates back to the nineteenth century. It has resident engineers and consultants in over 170 countries. Its development laboratories are located all over the world. In all segments of computer science and information technology, IBM has created a place for itself and its products in the minds of consumers.\n\nAs Al Ries, a legendary marketing strategist, says: “It’s the first company to build the mental position that has the upper hand, not the first company to make the product. IBM didn’t invent the computer; Sperry Rand did. But IBM was the first to build the computer position in the prospect’s mind.”\n\nBig Blue? Try Huge Blue. Today IBM is the one of the biggest providers of computer services. It is a leader in almost every market in which it operates. At ever fork in its long history, IBM’s strategy has been predicated on a simple yet innovative kernel of business success: customer first. But it is the ability to foretell a trend that has kept IBM a young-in-mind-and-at-heart company. Critics slammed its flagship hardware product’s sale to Lenovo last year. They are eating their words this year. IBM is leaner, meaner and more profitable with its unrelenting new focus on services, systems and consulting.\n\nIBM has foretold future business trends often in its century-plus history. It remains ahead of the curve, seeing value in segments crucial months and even years ahead of competitors like HP and Dell – and indeed its new clutch of competitors in services and consulting ranging from Accenture to McKinsey. In transformational terms, IBM has been unique – changing its business focus seamlessly and without missing a step, or a beat."
