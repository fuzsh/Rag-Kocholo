        "text": "Note: Many topics at this site are reduced versions of the text in \"The Encyclopedia of Networking and Telecommunications.\" Search results will not be as extensive as a search of the book's CD-ROM.\n\nSystemView is an IBM enterprise-wide network management system that recognizes and manages systems in heterogeneous environments. It was one of IBM's first products to recognize industry-standard protocols such as TCP/IP, and not just IBM's own SNA (Systems Network Architecture) protocols. In 1996, IBM acquired Tivoli Systems, Inc., and in this process the Tivoli division took over development of IBM's SystemView products. It also linked SystemView with its own environment, TME (Tivoli Management Environment).\n\nCopyright (c) 2001 Tom Sheldon and Big Sur Multimedia.\n\nAll rights reserved under Pan American and International copyright conventions."
