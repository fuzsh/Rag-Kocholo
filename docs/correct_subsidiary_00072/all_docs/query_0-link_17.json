        "text": "IBM plans to acquire privately held Consul Risk Management Inc. to enhance the compliance and security auditing capabilities of its Tivoli systems management software family.\n\nIBM said today that it expects to close its purchase of Consul in the first quarter of 2007. At that point, Consul will become part of IBM’s Tivoli Software business unit. IBM didn’t provide any financial details on the proposed transaction.\n\nConsul’s software lets customers track, report and investigate unauthorized access of corporate information by their employees. The company has two main software suites: InSight, which focuses on the needs of enterprise users, and zSecure, which targets mainframe users specifically.\n\nThe breadth of coverage of both distributed and mainframe systems appealed to IBM, according to Joe Anthony, the company’s program director for Tivoli Integrated Identity Management. “It offers a lot of very good value and is very unique,” he said. Some of IBM’s customers are particularly keen to use their mainframes as security hubs, so the addition of Consul’s zSecure will likely prove appealing to them, he added. Aside from Consul’s software running on IBM’s System z mainframes, the companies previously had no formal relationship.\n\nAlthough some industry analysts have put Tivoli Security Operations Manager, which debuted in July, and Consul’s InSight in the same security information management category, Anthony doesn’t see them as competing products. “Once you drill down, in terms of what they have, there’s very minor overlap with Tivoli,” he said.\n\nIBM plans to provide details on a road map for Consul’s software when it closes the acquisition next year. The vendor hopes to quickly integrate the technologies with Tivoli. “They should dovetail nicely together,” Anthony said.\n\nConsul will complement the security management functionality IBM has within Tivoli software and the technology it gained from its $1.3 billion acquisition of Internet Security Systems Inc., which closed in October, he added.\n\nConsul will help Tivoli define and flag what customers determine to be “acceptable use” of their data by those permitted to view that information, Anthony said. “We were definitely not as deep in that area,” he added. “Consul is much more thorough.”\n\nFor instance, a bank may allow tellers to access customer information, Anthony said. Using the Consul software, the financial institution could track user behavior, monitoring access of that data so it would be alerted that an individual teller was viewing 800 customer records per day when his peers were examining only 200."
