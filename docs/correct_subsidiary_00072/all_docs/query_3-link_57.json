The decision to support Linux, the world's freely distributed open-source operating system, and the timing of when to make these products available, was made based on customer demand. As the industry's leading supplier of open, cross-platform management solutions, Tivoli has a large number of customers with increasingly heterogeneous IT environments, to which Linux is rapidly being added. \"Having been users and advocates for Linux since its first release, we have been anxiously awaiting Tivoli's management solution for Linux,\" said Bjart Kvarme, chief engineer, Center for Information Technology Services, University of Oslo. \"We currently have over 250 Linux workstations that we plan on managing with Tivoli solutions. Participating in the beta program to test this code will give us the quickest opportunity to provide our Linux systems with the same level of support we have received from Tivoli for other platforms.\" \"Announcing our support for Linux is part of our overall initiative to help organizations align IT more closely with the requirements of their business,\" said Mike Turner, vice president, Tivoli Enterprise Business Unit. \"We understand only too well the economic pressures our customers face in trying to deliver higher performance and greater functionality at lower cost. Being able to run key Tivoli products transparently on Linux, as part of an integrated yet heterogeneous environment, will enable them to guarantee the stability and availability of their Linux applications, in addition to simplifying the management task.\" Tivoli Systems is no stranger to using Open Source products and has been using Open Source tools, such as GNU compilers, since its inception to develop its framework and applications. Within its labs, Tivoli has been running the framework and certain core applications on Linux for over a year, waiting for customer demand to reach appropriate levels before releasing Linux support. \"As software vendors such as Netscape Communications, SAP and Oracle announce their support for Linux, Network and Systems Management (NSM) starts to become an important factor for enterprises to consider,\" said Milind Govekar, senior research analyst for Gartner Group. \"The two important areas that affect NSM are management of Linux and management on Linux, i.e. NSM applications for managing Linux and NSM applications on Linux. Through 2001, NSM applications that use Linux as a platform of choice for managing heterogeneous computing environments will see an increase in the installed base, in excess of 100 percent. Enterprises should not implement NSM applications from vendors that modify Linux OS and do not make these modifications part of the Linux open-source-code process.\" The first Tivoli product lines to support Linux will be Tivoli Enterprise products and the Tivoli Management Suites. In addition to the Tivoli Management Framework, applications supporting Linux will include Tivoli Software Distribution, Tivoli Inventory, Tivoli Distributed Monitoring, Tivoli User Administration, Tivoli Security Management and Tivoli Enterprise Console adapters. These products will initially support the Red Hat version of distribution, in order to fulfill the requests of Tivoli customers. Tivoli will support other versions of Linux and other applications in the future as demand warrants. \"The power, stability and performance of the Red Hat Linux operating system provides an ideal platform for Tivoli and other vital management solutions that businesses rely on every day to manage their network,\" said Tim Buckley, senior vice president and Chief Operating Officer at Red Hat, Inc. \"In addition, Tivoli's support of Red Hat Linux lets large organizations easily bring the growing number of Linux-based systems into the fold of ongoing systems management practices.\" \"As demand for Linux on Dell PowerEdge servers grows, so do our customers' needs for cost-effective systems management solutions to help them run their networks,\" said Jack Steeg, vice president, Enterprise Alliance Marketing, Dell. \"Tivoli systems management tools on Dell PowerEdge servers helps our customers simplify and standardize systems management of their Linux networks.\" Pricing and Availability Product pricing can be obtained from your local Tivoli sales office. Products are available at the end of the year. About Linux Linux is a free Unix-type operating system originally created by Linus Torvalds with the assistance of developers from around the world.
