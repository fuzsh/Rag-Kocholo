        "text": "IBM Move adds to Virtualization, Tivoli Tools\n\nQuoting from CIO India\n\nIBM Corp. is buying software firm Rembo Technology to bolster its Tivoli management tools and virtualization offerings, the company said. Rembo makes software to help administrators automate software installation and upgrades on PCs and servers through a central dashboard. IBM will incorporate Rembo's operations into its Tivoli software division, and will integrate its technology into the Tivoli Provisioning Manager and IBM Director software.\n\nIBM also plans to offer the Rembo products as part of its Virtualization Engine software, hardware and services, to help businesses manage sprawling virtual environments. Market-research company IDC estimates spending around server virtualization alone will increase to nearly $15 billion worldwide by 2009.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal, which IBM expects to close in the second quarter of 2006, were not disclosed.\n\nThe acquisition comes on the heels of IBM's purchase earlier this year of CIMS Labs Inc., which makes software that tracks the use of servers, storage, networks, databases, applications and operating systems in virtualized environments. IBM also incorporated CIMS into its Tivoli division.\n\nThe original article is here.\n\nCalendar\n\n<May 2006>\n\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa301234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303112345678910"
