Originally named the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), it emerged from the merger of four companies specializing in business equipment.\n\nFlint's vision was to create a company that could provide innovative solutions for the growing demand in data processing and business efficiency. IBM quickly evolved from focusing on tabulating equipment to becoming a leader in computer technology, playing a crucial role in the advancement of computing and information technology services. This adaptability and commitment to innovation have cemented IBM's status as a global technology leader.\n\nâ\n\nThe IBM Mafia\n\nThe IBM Mafia has founded 1,353 companies and raised $31.3 billion in total, as per Crunchbase data.\n\nPS: Are you a IBM Mafia member interested in bringing your community together to invest in innovative ventures (and enjoy potential profits and other perks along the way)?
