        "text": "Maximo (An Enterprise Asset Management system) was published by MRO Software(Maintenance, Repair, & Overhaul), Inc based in Bedford, Massachusetts – formerly known as PSDI founded in 1968 by Bob Daniels, and was headed by Norman “Chip” Drapeau.\n\nIn Dec 2000, Project Software Development, Inc. (PSDI) announced a formal change of company name to MRO Software. PSDI merged its e-business unit with its application software group, they came up with two offerings: a traditional EAM software product, Maximo, and an Internet-procurement-focused product, MRO.com.\n\nAdvertising Maximo as a “demand” product and MRO.com as a “supply” product MRO Software indicated a supply chain oriented software solution as a link between customers and suppliers\n\nTivoli was founded in 1989 by former IBM employees Bob Fabbio, who now serves as CEO of Austin’s Cesura Inc.; Steve Marcie, Todd Smith and Peter Valdes. It was as an independent software vendor which developed and sold “systems management” software and services. Tivoli went public in 1995 and a year later, IBM acquired the company for $743 million to bolster its systems and network management capabilities.\n\nAccording to IT analyst research firm Gartner, Inc., IBM currently owns the largest share of the “IT Operations Management” software market, with an 18% market share.\n\nMRO Software was acquired byIBM in an all-cash transaction at a price of approximately $740 million, or $25.80 per share in August 3,2006 and in April1,2007 transfer of trade to IBM took place.\n\nAfter the acquisition, IBM:\n\n– Established MRO Software’s operations as a business unit within IBM’s Tivoli software unit led by general manager Al Zollar.\n\n– Incorporated MRO software technology into IBM’s Tivoli software offerings.\n\n– Marketed and sold MRO software products through IBM’s and MRO’s worldwide sales channels and IBM Business Partners.\n\n“Few years back in IBM study, 40 percent of CEOs indicated that asset utilization would be a key focus in strengthening financial performance,” said Al Zollar, general manager, IBM Tivoli software .\n\n“As technology increasingly becomes the backbone for all business operations, companies require the ability to efficiently manage both industrial and technology assets,” said Chip Drapeau, president and CEO, MRO Software .\n\nHaving read that, overtly we will explore “Asset”\n\n– An asset is a useful or valuable thing .\n\n– Financial accounting considers an asset is an economic resource .\n\n– An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity\n\nHence for reaping future economic benefits, Asset Management becomes critical\n\nWiki Says:\n\nAsset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or group. It may apply to both tangible assets such as buildings and to intangible concepts such asintellectual property andgoodwill. Asset management is a systematic process of deploying, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets cost-effectively.\n\nBy Industry Asset management can refer to :\n\nFinancial asset management\n\nInfrastructure asset management\n\nEnterprise asset management\n\nPublic asset management\n\nIn our context we need to focus on Enterprise asset management which can be sub-divided to\n\nPhysical asset management\n\nInfrastructure asset management\n\nFixed assets management\n\nIT asset management\n\nDigital asset management\n\nWe will focus a little more on Asset and Asset Management in subsequent posts."
