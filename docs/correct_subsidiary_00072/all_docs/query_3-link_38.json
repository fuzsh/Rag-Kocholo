        "text": "TSO Automations has recently bewildered many of my co-workers...\n\nI'm writing this on their behalf.... If ANYONE can direct me toward a publication that can shed some light on this dilemma...would sincerely appreciate it.\n\nLast Saturday the Automations on TSO within one of our LPARs took down the wrong system ...\n\nupon browsing the netlog you could see that it was repeatedly selecting the wrong outstanding response, i.e. in this situation the subsystem was \"Mint\" (a test system) .... It kept issuing the XXChe Freeze command (it was using outstanding response numbers that \"Mint\" had used prior to its current outstanding reply number.\n\nEventually it took down the wrong system with the \"xx Che Freeze\" command... in this case it was \"IMS\"\n\nYes.... and it did this the next day as well.\n\nIt's as if the Automations was confused.\n\nTo top things off...it has worked fine since then, yet we are still taking precautions with workarounds.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of this? TSO has no outstanding response, so automation has no need for that.\n\nProblems could arise at a lot of places :\n\nMPF\n\nAutomation tables\n\nAutomation REXX routines\n\nAutomation Policy\n\nWrong execution of INGREQ\n\nSo you have to find out if anything was changed in before mentioned places. That will be searching the syslogs,the netlogs and eventually\n\nJES joblogs.\n\nProbably the automation people can tell you something if they want to.\n\nYou will not find any publication for your problem, cause my guess is that\n\nthe problem was man made. Well.... Seems as though we have an answer to this... \"It's a \"PARM\", (parm - /parm/ Further-compressed form of param. This term is an IBMism, and written use is almost unknown outside IBM shops; spoken /parm/ is more widely distributed, but the synonym arg is favoured among hackers. Compare var.)\n\nand it's not a recent change...\n\nThat is probably about the most descriptive explanation I'm going to get since I'm \"an operator\" of the Systems and not in the Automations group.\n\n(and yes TSO has no outstanding response, as the \"outstanding response\" number is in \"MVS\", another trade mark name for an IBM system.)\n\nDon't know if this \"Parm\" is part of *System Table etc. either...\n\n*System Tables (\"System tables uses to track the database objects. In essence, access is a set of relational database tables (the system tables) about a set of relational database tables (the user project). System tables should not be altered directly by any user. For example, do not attempt to modify system tables with DELETE, UPDATE, or INSERT statements, or user-defined triggers.\n\nSystem tales are much like the tables you create in a database - with a few exceptions. First, they are identified internally as system objects so that you can differentiate your regular tables from system tables. Secondly, some system tables are inherently read-only. ...etc\")\n\nSo I'm going to let this go with my public Inquiry on this forum... again, thanks you guys for the info..\n\nJust a PS .... Sometimes when something , a Subsystem, a Server, etc., doesn't start on Automations.... or won't start with the \"Autodown\" command within TWS... We've had success just entering this command on the MVS Master Console: S <address>\n\nMike in Pennsylvania Your last post is clear as mud ( much more PC than makes no sense at all ) ...\n\nlittle chance of getting any answer or favorable comments\n\nplease reread it slowly and meditate on it honestly ...\n\nreword it in order that we might understand what You are trying to tell/ask\n\nsince You are in\n\nQuote: IBM Mainframe Operations\n\nYou should have realized already that many of the terms used are IBM trademarks\n\nand for MVS, part of the os culture since the appearance of PCP, MFT, and MVT operating systems in 1966.\n\n( a bit of time before the appearance of hackers )\n\nthe PARM keyword is part of the jcl common terminology starting from the above date\n\n//<stepname> EXEC PGM=<pgmname>,PARM='.....'\n\nand also for the programming side as an abbreviation for parameter\n\nnothing to bicker about\n\nanyway, IHMD on, somebody just told You in a very bad format that ...\n\nsome system tables ( nothing to do with database tables ) were clobbered with some invalid data/parameter Yes..... upon your request:\n\n...\"please reread it slowly and meditate on it honestly\"...\n\nThis might come across as \"PC\"... yet..just trying to abide by the \"rules\"..\"do your homework\"...\n\nand:\n\n...\"little chance of getting any answer or favorable comments\"\n\nMaybe the wording doesn't make sense in some countries... here in the USA... when someone says, \"Let it go\"...or \" I'm letting it go\".... it means:\n\nI'm going to forget about this...and move on... (basically)\n\nSo, in this Post I'm not looking for any response.\n\nI would like to clarify one thing.... when I mentioned TSO (again), I meant Z/OS Automation ..... and in my final advice on starting something : I said \"TWS\" ..... correctly it should have said : Tivoli Automations.\n\nFrom the Tivoli Automatioons SDF Main Menu: If you can't start a subsystem, or it won't start with the \"UP\" or \"Autodown\" command...\n\nWe have successfully started them on the MVS Master Console for that system with the Start Command: S (sp) <subsystem>\n\nCiao\n\nMike in Pennsylvania"
