        "text": "Systems management operation, Tivoli Systems Inc has entered into the small and medium business market with the introduction of a new product suite. The Tivoli IT Director product is based on Windows NT and has been designed to be used by companies who employ hundreds of staff, as opposed to thousands. Users can manage networks from a single point of control, and features include applications management, automation and Internet enabled management, as well as software distribution, inventory and network management. The product will be sold through distributors and resellers, the first time the company has sold products in this way. Eventually, Tivoli, which is owned by IBM Corp, intends to have some 20 distributors across the world. According to figures published by International Data Corp, the adoption of systems management capabilities is expected to grow 30% this year, and will be worth $1.2bn as a market, by 2001. English language version of IT Director will be available in July, with prices starting at $10,800. German, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese versions are expected in September. Additional products in the range are expected later in the year."
