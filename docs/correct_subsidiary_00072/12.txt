IBM and its systems management unit, Tivoli Systems Inc, are planning to bundle and eventually fully integrate their network and systems management software products. Tivoli’s Telecommunications and Networking Business unit last month took over development of Nways Manager, the network management software from IBM’s Network Hardware Division’s, and is now working on integrating it with Tivoli Enterprise, the IBM subsidiary’s systems management software.

Mike Zibaie, IBM NHD Business Line Manager for Nways Manager Applications, told a group of journalists and analysts at a networking conference in Cannes yesterday that the two products sets will have some degree of interoperability by the end of the year, and will be sold together as a bundled package. Zibaie said Tivoli will be announcing a complete road map for delivery of a unified application which will allow the management of both enterprise systems and network hardware through a single interface next month.
