        "text": "“There’s No Business Like Show Business” took on a whole new meaning during the filming of Annie Get Your Gun. The production seemed to be cursed from the beginning, even though it all started innocently enough. Ethel Merman triumphed as Annie Oakley when the show opened on Broadway on May 16, 1946. It went on to run for 1,147 performances. Immediately after the opening, every singing actress in Hollywood wanted to play the role on film. Not only was it a great part and a great show, but each one of Irving Berlin’s songs was great as well. Naturally, Arthur Freed wanted to make the film version starring MGM’s premier musical leading lady, Judy Garland. Irving Berlin agreed. Judy, however, was not physically nor mentally up to taking on the demands of such a strenuous role.\n\nJudy began Annie on March 7, 1949, with wardrobe work and song rehearsals. She had been promised a vacation but was coaxed into preliminary work. Pre-recordings segued into rehearsals and costume tests and so on. The vacation never happened. The result is that Judy went into the production running on half the energy at which she normally functioned. Musical supervisor Lela Simone recalled a day that she and Roger Edens were present as Judy recorded some of the songs: “In the monitor booth, for the first time Roger and I smiled each other into a more or less artificial enthusiasm, ‘that was very nice, wasn’t it?’ we said. ‘Nice’ was a term we had never used for Judy before.”\n\nActual filming began on April 4, 1949, without Judy, who wasn’t needed that day. As Hugh Fordin pointed out in his book about The Freed Unit titled The World of Entertainment, “it seemed as though the production office had set up the shooting schedule to keep Judy away from director Busby Berkeley as much as possible. The choice of Berkeley as director is a clear indication that producer Arthur Freed had little to no understanding about the extent of Judy’s issues at the time, nor her intense incompatibility with Berkeley. Freed chose Berkeley in an effort to give the director, who Freed revered but whose career was in decline, a chance at a comeback. That Berkeley was called a “taskmaster” was no exaggeration. As far back as 1939 and his work on Babes In Arms, there were signs of incompatibility between him and Judy. The final straw came with 1943’s Girl Crazy and the “I Got Rhythm” number. He drove everyone into the ground, putting Judy on bed rest for several weeks.\n\nOn the second day of shooting Judy’s co-star, Howard Keel fell off his horse. His absence naturally shifted the burden of filming to Judy. Her first scenes shot for the film were devoted to the “Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly” sequence on the exterior set of the “Wilson Hotel.” She first worked with dance director Robert Alton on the rehearsals and staging. Reportedly, on the first day of filming for the sequence, Berkeley began shouting at the crew. This upset Judy enough to prompt her to leave the set for the day feigning illness. Allegedly, when she saw some of the dailies a few days later, she got up, went over to a water cooler, and downed a handful of Benzedrines. The sequence was completed on April 9th.\n\nDays later rehearsals began for the “I’m An Indian Too” production number with dance director Robart Alton rather than Berkeley in the director’s chair. Contract dancer and assistant choreographer Alex Romero reported that in some instances he had to hold Judy up to keep her from falling flat on her face. He said he had “never seen anyone so far gone on drugs.” Freed came to the set one day and witnessed Judy losing her footing. He ran over to her and began shouting at her, to the embarrassment of the cast and crew. Clearly, the stress of the experience was taking its toll on everyone involved.\n\nFinally, on May 3rd, Freed looked at the existing footage and fired Berkeley. He said “[Berkeley] had no conception of what the picture was all about. He was shooting the whole thing like a stage play. Everyone would come out of the wings, say their lines, and back away upstage for their exists.” That next day he contacted director Charles Walters (Judy’s original first choice) who later recalled: “Arthur asked me to come in and look at the Annie footage. So I went – and my God – it was horrible! Judy was at her worst. She couldn’t decide whether she was Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, Martha Raye, or herself. ‘I want you to take over the picture,’ Arthur said, ‘Okay, but first I must have a long talk with Judy.'” When they met a day later, Judy told Walters “It’s too late, Chuck, I haven’t got the energy or the nerve anymore.” In spite of her plea, Walters was able to convince her to carry on.\n\nJudy tried again. The surviving footage reveals her to be in much better shape than had been reported over the years, but there’s no denying the fatigue showing in her face and (at times) a lack of that special Garland sparkle. This is most noticeable in the “Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly” footage. If Judy had been at her usual brilliant best, she would have worked wonders with the role.\n\nOn May 10, 1949, Judy was fired from the film. That day was a particularly harrowing one for her. At 7:30 a.m. she had called the assistant director, Al Jennings, stating she had a bad night and wasn’t sure if she would be able to get to the studio. She felt better during the call and said she’d be in but would be late. At 10:10 a.m. Judy checked through the front gate. After being made up she reported to the set, but not in costume. She said she had a severe migraine and was unsure if she could perform the number “I’m An Indian Too.” She rehearsed with Robert Alton until 11:55 when the production stopped for lunch. At 1:30 p.m. Judy was given a letter from L.K. Sidney firing her from the film, specifically citing her as being “responsible for substantial delays.” It was a devastating blow, made worse by the fact that no one in the production (not even Walters or Alton) was aware the letter of suspension was being delivered. Production manager Walter Strohm told Jennings to get Judy in an attempt to continue shooting. Judy’s reply was “I shall never come back – now or ever.” L.B. Mayer ordered the production closed. According to Fordin: “Only a few technicians were still wrapping up their equipment when Judy’s hairdresser emerged from her dressing room. ‘Where is everybody?’ she asked Jennings. ‘Get them all back: Judy is on her way.’ When Judy came out everybody had gone.”"
