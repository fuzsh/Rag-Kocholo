        "text": "This week, Ukrainian cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot and killed by actor Alec Baldwin on the New Mexico film set for the movie Rust.\n\nThe film's director, Joel Souza, was also hit and injured but has since been released from hospital.\n\nWhile an investigation into the incident continues, we take a look at the use of firearms on film and television productions and the safety protocols in place.\n\nWhat is a prop firearm?\n\nIt's a loose definition and could apply to anything from a rubber toy to a real firearm that can fire a projectile.\n\nHowever, if it's used for firing — even just blanks — it's considered a real gun.\n\nA blank is a type of gun cartridge that contains gunpowder but no bullet.\n\nStill, it can seriously hurt or kill someone who is close by, according to the Actors' Equity Association.\n\nFilm firearms-safety coordinator Dave Brown wrote a 2019 piece for American Cinematographer about gun safety on set.\n\n\"Blanks expel gunpowder and hot gases out of the front of the barrel in a cone shape,\" Brown wrote.\n\n\"This is harmless at longer ranges, but the explosion can seriously injure someone if it's too close.\"\n\nPolice are still determining what kind of projectile killed Halyna Hutchins on set.\n\nWhat are the rules for using firearms on set?\n\nGenerally, a weapons master or armourer oversees all weapons that are used on a production.\n\nWeapons masters are required to abide by state and federal laws and hold proper operating permits.\n\nThis can mean anything from selecting the correct items for a certain period in history, to taking care of the weapons on set and making sure they are being used safely and properly by actors and stunt performers.\n\nIt's a new position in the history of film production. Prior to the 1980s, the prop master handled all props.\n\nRecently, it's become more common to enlist specialists.The weapons master is required to be on set whenever a weapon is being used.\n\nAccording to the Actors' Equity Association's guidelines, a gun must be test-fired off stage and then by the actor involved, before each use.\n\n\"Watch the prop master check the cylinders and barrel to be sure no foreign object or dummy bullet has become lodged inside,\" the guidelines state.\n\nArmoury coordinator Sam Dormer said all weapons would be checked, before blanks were added.\n\n\"The blanks themselves are never loaded until the very last minute when all crew is in position, so the armourer knows exactly where every member of the crew is.\n\n\"That ensures no one's walking through any danger areas the armourer has set up.\"\n\nWhy would an actor point a gun at a cinematographer?\n\nWe don't know what happened on the set of Rust, but it is quite common to have a gun pointed at the camera and, by extension, the cinematographer.\n\nSteven Hall, a veteran second unit director and cinematographer who has worked on films like Fury and Thor: The Dark World, further explained the process.\n\n\"We've all seen the very famous shots in films where you get that dramatic effect of a gun being pointed at you, the audience, and of course, it's being pointed towards the camera,\" Mr Hall said.\n\n\"To minimise that, one would put a remote camera in that place or, if someone does have to operate the camera, [they would] be protected by safety goggles, a safety visor and a perspex screen that withstands pretty much anything.\n\nWhy not use special effects?\n\nIt is becoming more common to add in gunfire in post-production when working on visual effects.\n\nBut visual effects can be expensive, and it can be easier, and cheaper, to use props.\n\nThere can be advantages to using props and blanks, like getting an authentic reaction from an actor.\n\nRust is set in the 1880s, which requires actors to use period weapons that have been checked and deemed safe, according to Mr Hall.\n\n\"I have known live rounds to be fired out of revolvers to make sure that they function in a way that when you put a blank in, it isn't going to blow up or explode in the actor's hands,\" he said.\n\nHow has Hollywood responded?\n\nThere has been an outpouring of dismay and anger from all levels of the industry that something like this could have happened.\n\nDirector James Gunn tweeted that his greatest fear was that \"someone will be fatally hurt on one of my sets\".\n\nActor-filmmaker Alex Winter tweeted, \"Crew should never be unsafe on set\".\n\nHe said that, when they are, there was always an obvious reason."
