        "text": "Battlefield 2042 is a first-person shooter developed by Swedish game developer DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It is the twelfth main entry in EA's large-scale Battlefield FPS series, and is the first entry to take place in a modern/near future setting since 2013's Battlefield 4.\n\nA direct sequel to Battlefield 4, the game is set in the year 2042 and features the United States and Russia as Earth's last two superpowers, after environmental disasters, economic crises, rising sea levels, and resource shortages plunged the world into chaos. As the world recovers from a decade of crises, the two nations use former military personnel from refugee groups, who call themselves \"Non-Patriated\", in Task Forces to fight each other in proxy wars for control of the new world that has emerged. These refugees are distrustful of the governments that exiled them and refused them safety in the previous years of hardship, but must choose a side to fight for their future.\n\nAll-Out Warfare is the regular mode similar to the multiplayer of previous Battlefield titles, featuring maps set in worldwide locations like Egypt, Singapore, Seoul, Antarctica, and French Guiana with extreme weather events like sandstorms and tornadoes rolling in mid-match to affect the flow of gameplay.\n\nPortal mode allows use of remastered maps, weapons, vehicles, gadgets, classes, TTK values, movement and factions from older Battlefield games, namely Battlefield 1942, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, along with those from the rest of the game. Creation of custom \"Portal\" servers using remastered content is done via a web-based service, which allows players to customise rules and settings (including the use of new 2042 content) in order to create a properly unique Battlefield experience. New content is planned to be added Portal mode in future updates. As of the Season 2 update in August 2022, Portal weapons are made available in the 2042 All-Out Warfare mode via assignments, starting with the M16 and M60E4. For the purposes of the wiki, these weapons, known as \"Vault Weapons\" are marked with (*).\n\nThe following weapons appear in the video game Battlefield 2042:\n\nOverview\n\nBefore Update 3.2, Battlefield 2042 went away from the class system of all previous Battlefield games, instead using a system called \"Specialists\", who each have their own unique active and passive abilities, though they were still grouped into four different categories named after the previous games' classes based on their abilities (this is merely descriptive and does not affect gameplay). The rest of their loadout, including primary weapons and the second gadget, is fully customizable, allowing players more freedom in their loadouts. There are 10 specialists at launch, each with unique abilities and gadgets.\n\nUpdate 3.2 brings back the class system, with the Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon, while tying the Specialists to a rigid set of equipment based on class. However, unlike in previous games, the Engineer now specializes in light machine guns, and the Support now specializes in faster revives alongside the traditional ammunition support and specializes in submachine guns. Primary and secondary weapons are unrestricted like before, but their special gadget remains, with a unique class gadget (similar to how players carry Gas Masks in Battlefield 1 and Fortification Tools in Battlefield V), and class-specific gadgets are now restricted in a traditional way. With unrestricted primary and secondary weapons, each class has a specific Weapon Proficiency: Assault Specialists favor Assault Rifles with extra magazines, Engineer Specialists favor Light Machine Guns with pinpoint accuracy, Supports for Submachine Guns with faster deployment, and Recons favor Sniper Rifles with constant scope steadying. This makes 2042 in line with the returning factions in the Portal mode that use the old class system, with the precise classes available depending on their original game.\n\nGeneric AI soldiers of the United States and Russian factions appear in certain modes, and they appear to be based around the traditional classes such as having a regular assault rifleman, rocket-demolitions kit, support gunners, and marksmen types.\n\nBoth the base 2042 modes and Portal weapons have initial spawn/equip animations, a feature new to the series (sans some irregular appearances such as the M1 Garand in Battlefield V).\n\nA new \"attachment plus\" system allows weapons to be customized during gameplay, akin to the Crysis series or Warface.\n\nBattlefield 2042\n\nHandguns\n\nDesert Eagle Mark XIX\n\nThe Desert Eagle Mark XIX appeared in Season 5 as the \"BFP .50\", which stands for \"Big Frame Pistol\".\n\nGlock 18\n\nThe Glock 18 appears in the game as the \"G57\". It is depicted with fourth-generation Glock elements; actual G18s only exist in the 2/3 Gen spec (though there are Gen 4 Khyber Pass \"copies\" of the Glock 18C). The frame is fitted with a futurized Recover Tactical RC12 rail adapter.\n\nIts alternate fire mode is a three-round burst, as opposed to the real G18's full-auto. In the pre-Alpha build of the game it incorrectly held 16+1 rounds instead of 17+1; while this was likely a simple oversight (setting it to hold \"17 rounds\", not unlike the CZ 75 from Battlefield 4 before it was corrected), the Beta and final game double down on this error by lowering the ammo count to 14+1, with options for (all underloaded compared to real life) a 15-round subsonic, 20-round extended stick magazine, or a 30-round drum magazine. As of Season 2: Master of Arms, the magazine capacities have been updated to 17, 17, 27, and 35, respectively. When entirely out of ammo, the slide will remain locked back.\n\nKel-Tec P50\n\nThe Kel-Tec P50 was added in Season 2: Master of Arms, as the \"PF51\"; this makes 2042 the weapon's first known media appearance. Being (presumably) a fictional future variant, the PF51 is select-fire, unlike the semi-auto-only P50. It is marked as being made by \"Gunther Firearms\" and is apparently of German origin.\n\nLaugo Alien\n\nAppearing under the name of \"L9CZ,\" the Laugo Alien was added in Season 6.\n\n\"NVK-P125\"\n\nA fictional bullpup pistol dubbed the \"NVK-P125\" was added with Season 3 as a sidearm.\n\nSIG-Sauer P320 (in Flux Defense MP17 chassis)\n\nA SIG-Sauer P320 in a Flux Defense MP17 chassis appears as the \"MP28\". In the game's universe, the P320 pistol itself is called \"M28\" (as seen in the loadout menu description), in a reference to the M17 and M18 variants. As with the DSR-1 sniper rifle, the MP17 features a reserve magazine in its foregrip that is used during the first reload. The slot is unused if the drum magazine attachment is equipped.\n\nTaurus Raging Hunter\n\nA Taurus Raging Hunter revolver appears as the \"M44\" (actually a different Taurus revolver entirely that was the \".44 Magnum\" in prior titles); it operates exclusively in single-action, with the player character manually cocking the hammer between each shot. The hammer is cocked upon first drawing the weapon, and will subsequently remain cocked when holstered. Recocking the hammer cannot be skipped by swapping weapons (much like rechambering pump/bolt action weapons) - though once an entire cylinder is spent, the hammer is erroneously cocked at the start of a reload (this locks the cylinder in place in reality). Much like the G57's slide staying locked back when entirely out of spare ammo, the hammer will remain down until more ammo is obtained. Unfired rounds are retained when reloading, with casings simply dumped out of the cylinder after catching the unfired rounds, then a speedloader is used; due to this, the empty reload is actually faster than partial reloads as it skips that step.\n\nOn launch, it was inexplicably portrayed as having a 5+1 capacity; this was claimed to have been fixed in the 2nd December patch, but in fact was not. Only later patches after the December patch eventually fixed the bug.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nBrügger & Thomet APC9 K PRO\n\nThe Brügger & Thomet APC9 K PRO made its debut in Season 4 as the \"AC9\", and uses the same magazine as the B&T MP9, with the same 30 and 20-round capacity. An either underloaded or overloaded 35-round magazine (30-round magazine with a +5 base plate) is available, holding 30 rounds of \"Standard Issue\" ammo or 40 rounds of \"Close Combat\" ammo. Interestingly, it is also the only weapon of 2042 so far that is capable of equipping the legacy Russian Kobra reflex sight with a special reticle. Note how the 12 and 6 o'clock Picatinny rails have been replaced with the game's standard powered rails, while the side rails have been left as-is. A modelling choice that may not be as arbitrary as it seems, as the only electronics one can attach to 2042 specific guns are for the top (optics) and bottom (lasers and weaponlight) rails\n\nBrügger & Thomet MP9-N\n\nA Brügger & Thomet MP9-N with a TP9-style underbarrel rail appears under the \"MP9\" moniker. It fires at 900 RPM, which makes it the second fastest SMG, beaten only by the Vector. At first, it is equipped with a 30-round magazine (with the model of a 15-rounder), with options for a 20-rounder (also with the same model), a 40-round extended magazine (modeled as a 30-rounder), or a 50-round drum magazine.\n\nCZ Scorpion Evo 3 A1\n\nThe CZ Scorpion Evo 3 A1 was added in Season 7: Turning Point, under the name \"SCZ-3\". The weapon is an intermediate model that has most improved parts of late Scorpion Evo 3 A1 models, but the receiver of early versions.\n\nKRISS Vector\n\nThe 2nd generation KRISS Vector appears as the \"K30\", seemingly alluding to it being a successor to the KRISS K10 prototype that previously appeared in Battlefield Hardline. Despite functioning like a full-auto Vector SMG, the beta version was modeled after the civilian SBR variant, as it lacked a select-fire lever. The retail release changed this by adding full-auto and burst pictograms to the safety at the rear, but this is incorrect, as the fire selector (Semi/Burst/Auto) of the real Vector SMG is separate from the safety. The resulting selector (depicted as Safe/Burst/Auto) seems to reflect the fact that the weapon can only be used in full-auto or two-round burst during gameplay, but not semi-auto.\n\nIt uses 20-round magazines by default (implied to be .45 ACP) as well as 40-round extended mags (possibly in 9mm), with an option for a 20-round subsonic and a 50-round drum magazine, and is fitted with Diamondhead's Diamond Integrated Sighting System flip up sights.\n\nAI US Command troops can be seen with the Vector in gameplay.\n\nLWRC SMG-45\n\nThe LWRC SMG-45 first appeared under the name \"PBX-9\", and as of the first public test is instead named \"PBX-45\". Markings on the side read \"9MM|45 ACP\", and it can indeed be swapped between 9mm in 30 and 40 round magazines or .45 ACP in 20-rounders. It also has a 35 round magazine in \"Close Combat\" ammunition. Its stock appears to use the bronze finish of the early models.\n\nA secret, M1 Garand inspired reload involves the stick magazine being pushed down through the top of the weapon, clipping through it into the magazine well.\n\nPP-19 Bizon-2\n\nA PP-19 Bizon-2 modified with a custom forend, an AK-400-styled top rail, and a Zenit stock appears as the \"PP-29\". It can equip its standard 64-round (assumably 9x18mm Makarov) helical magazine, or use high-power and subsonic (assumably 9x19mm Parabellum) 53-round magazines. It is the default SMG for the Russian AI faction in gameplay.\n\nShotguns\n\nCrye Precision SIX12\n\nA Crye Precision SIX12 can be mounted as an underbarrel option to the AK-12, MCX-SPEAR, Sako TRG, and LWAMG. It is named the \"Masterkey\" in reference to the Knight's Armament Masterkey.\n\nRemington 870 MCS\n\nThe Remington 870 MCS appears as the \"MCS-880\", fitted with an M4 stock adaptor, a combination M-LOK and smart rail pump, and Mossberg 590A1-style ghost ring sights. Its tube magazine cannot be extended, but it can load buckshot, flechette, and slug shells, and the pump can mount a few foregrips.\n\nSaiga 12\n\nA Saiga 12 with full-auto capability and customized by Hatcher Gun Company appears as the \"12M Auto\". By default, it comes with an 8-round buckshot magazine - it can accept 8-round flechettes or slugs, 10-round buckshot stick mags, and a 20-round buckshot drum. AI Russian close-quarters troops use the Saiga 12.\n\nSerbu Super Shorty\n\nA Mossberg 500-based Serbu Super Shorty makes an appearance in Season 4 as the \"Super 500\", fitted with a smart rail system and iron sights. As with Battlefield 4's 870-based Serbu, it is classified as a secondary weapon in-game.\n\nStandard Manufacturing DP-12\n\nA stylized Standard Manufacturing DP-12 makes an appearance in Season 3 as the \"NVK-S22,\" with an ammo counter and smart rail. It functions as a self-loading shotgun in-game, despite being a pump action design in reality. The pump is only used when the weapon is empty after a reload.\n\nRifles / Carbines\n\n\"AC-42\"\n\nThe \"AC-42\" is a fictional futuristic bullpup assault rifle, in-game described as being of Russian origin and is chambered in 5.45x39mm. Despite this, the design takes visual cues from the Australian Thales F90MBR (with its in-file name being NBR further supporting this) and the Israeli IWI Tavor series. \"AC-42\" also follows typical Russian-style naming conventions; \"A\" for \"Avtomat\", \"C\" for the designer's name, a dash, and \"(20)42\" for the year of introduction.\n\nAt 1,200 RPM, the AC-42 is the fastest-firing assault rifle, but is locked to semi-auto and burst fire modes only. By default it starts with a 30-round magazine, with options for a 39-round extended magazine, 30-round subsonic and 21-round high power options.\n\nInterestingly, the AC-42 does not feature the +1 chamber mechanic, which was likely intentionally done so every magazine is easily divisible by 3.\n\nAK-12\n\nThe 2018 production version of the AK-12 appears as the \"AK-24\". It was first seen in the reveal trailer, fitted with an olive drab handguard, stock, and polymer magazine, as well as various attachments, including an OKP-7 sight. Holding 30 rounds by default, it can also be equipped with \"High-Power\" ammo (assumably 9x39mm) in 20-round mags; these magazines share the same model as the polymer 5.45x39mm 30-rounders, but in a black finish instead of tan, as well as an underloaded \"PUFGUN SG545 60\" 60-round quad-stack magazine holding 40 rounds, and an underloaded RPK-16 95-round drum magazine holding 50 rounds. Regular Russian AI Naval Infantry soldiers use the AK-12 as their standard rifle in the 2042-era.\n\nAccurate to the real AK-12, it can switch between full-auto, semi-auto, and also a two-round burst. Equipping the \"Target 8T 4.25-1.25x\" canted optics changes the AK's chambering style when empty.\n\nAM-17\n\nThe AM-17 is featured in Season 2: Master of Arms, as the \"AM40\", described as a hybrid of an assault rifle and an SMG (carbine), similar to an AKS-74U. By default, it uses High-Power ammo loaded in AK-12 magazines only to 20 rounds (possibly meant to emulate the 9x39mm AMB-17 version), with options from the base AK-12 available as well (extended High Power, regular 5.45, and a drum magazine).\n\nBofors Ak 5C\n\nAs of Season 7, the Ak 5C has been added as an available assault rifle.\n\nDaniel Defense DDM4 V7 PRO\n\nA Daniel Defense DDM4 V7 PRO with a Strike Switch safety lever, dark earth Raptor charging handle and earlier DDM4 V7 trigger appears as a semi-auto marksman type weapon. This is strange considering that the US Armed Forces use 7.62 NATO rifles for their designated marksman role, however the one in-game appears to use what looks to be either 6.5mm Grendel or 6mm ARC, both of which explain its extended range capabilities. Originally named the \"4V9\" in the reveal trailer, by the EA Play trailer it had been renamed to \"DM7\", a name it retains in the final game. Curiously, its description states that it has a 16\" barrel (like the original DDM4 V7), even though the in-game model clearly has the PRO variant's 18\" barrel. Nevertheless, it has two suppressor options affixed to a 16\" barrel. Initially, it used 12-round magazines in trailers, but this has been changed to 15-round magazines (in both \"Standard Issue\" and subsonic), with options for a 20-round magazine in \"Close Combat\" ammunition (using the DD 32-round mag with a Magpul), as well as high power and armor piercing options that use flush 10-round magazines.\n\nUS Command AI marksmen use the DDM4 V7 PRO as their standard DMR.\n\nFN SCAR-H CQC\n\nThe FN SCAR-H CQC appears as the \"SFAR-M GL\" (which presumably stands for Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle - Modern, as opposed to Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle - Heavy). It has the underbarrel EGLM grenade launcher for the SCAR-H permanently attached, and cannot swap it out for other underbarrel attachments.\n\nIt starts with its standard 7.62 20-round magazine, and can be swapped for a 30-round magazine (SCAR-L, 5.56x45 - albeit uses the same 20-rounder model), 20 rounds of armor piercing, or a 40-round drum magazine based on the PMAG D-50 LR/SR .308 drum, with a much longer tower and a smaller drum section. The Long Barrel customization turns it into the STD variant.\n\nIt is shown used by Lis's JW GROM unit in concept art.\n\nHeckler & Koch G36C\n\nThe Heckler & Koch G36C returns from previous games as the \"GEW-46\", as part of Season 5 content. It and the Desert Eagle are the only firearms specifically made for the main All Out Warfare segment of 2042 to not feature the fictionalized smart rail accessory mounts.\n\nHS Produkt VHS-K2\n\nThe HS Produkt VHS-K2 assault rifle appears in Season 6, dubbed the \"VHX D3\".\n\nKel-Tec CMR-30\n\nThe Kel-Tec CMR-30 appears as the \"VCAR\"; notably, 2042 marks the carbine's first known media appearance. It is classified as a marksman rifle in-game, filling a similar role to the pistol-caliber carbines in BFV. It features a rather long extended magazine by default; curiously, this only holds 30 rounds of \"Close Combat\" ammunition (with options for a shortened 25-round magazine or 40-round drums of the same ammunition, or 20 round magazines of \"Standard Issue\" or subsonic ammo using the same length as the default model) - this is in stark contrast to the real weapon, whose default flush-fitting magazines hold 30 rounds of .22 Magnum (hence the name). Markings on the right side of the \"VCAR\" indicate it is made by \"Gunther,\" which are also present on the P50.\n\nLoneStar Future Weapons RM277\n\nThe LoneStar Future Weapons RM277 makes an appearance in Season 4 as the \"RM68\". The one depicted in-game is a hybrid of three prototypes of the RM277, combining the first prototype's buttstock, trigger guard, vents above the trigger guard, and vents in front of the charging handle and behind it, the third prototype's left-side ejection port and a handguard resembling this version, and the fourth prototype's fire selector lever and sliding bolt release (although the latter is only depicted on the right side, similarly to the previous prototype). In addition, the magwell has a similar shape to the first prototype, but with a rib like later models.\n\nDue to its canted iron sights, optics are required to aim the RM277 in-game, and comes in 20 and 30-rounders. Despite being modelled with its open/closed-bolt switch, the in-game weapon is stuck to open-bolt fire despite its switch being set to closed-bolt.\n\nMarlin Model 336 Dark Series\n\nThe Marlin Model 336 Dark Series appears with a Midwest Industries M-LOK handguard. It is identifiable as a Model 336 due to the shape of the ejection port. It is referred to as the \"GVT 45-70\", although the .45-70 Government caliber is used by the Marlin Model 1895 in reality, not the 336.\n\nAI marksman classes may use the Model 336.\n\nSIG-Sauer MCX-SPEAR\n\nThe 2019 prototype of the SIG-Sauer MCX-SPEAR appears in the game as the \"M5A3\", implying that it won the NGSW program contract and was adopted by the US as the \"M5\"; its in-game description states that it was adopted as the standard rifle of the US military in 2034, and in gameplay, it is the default assault rifle used by AI US troops. It is fitted with KRISS USA AR-15 flip-up iron sights by default. It is also present on the cover art of the game, equipped with a SIG-Sauer ROMEO 8 and a suppressor. It is incorrectly (and strangely) chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO by default using 30- and 40-round PMAGs with other options including: .300 BLK 30-round PMAGs, 20-round 6.8x51mm FURY L7 AWM mags (the real life default chambering), or 35-round 9mm mags (oddly using 30-round MP9 magazines made by B&T instead of MPX magazines made by SIG).\n\nIn real life, the MCX-SPEAR is used almost exclusively with a custom SIG SLX suppressor designed for the weapon, as its 6.8x51mm SIG hybrid-cased ammunition is fairly powerful and has a strong muzzle blast; the standard military-issued MCX-SPEAR also comes with a 13\" barrel. In BF2042 however, it is used without a suppressor by default, along with having a longer 14.5\"-ish barrel, though it can be modified with a 13\" barrel with or without a suppressor.\n\nAs of 2022, the MCX-SPEAR has won the NGSW program and was designated the XM5 (although the designation has since been changed to XM7), which means BF2042 correctly speculated about the SPEAR's winning, though whether it will actually be adopted or not remains to be seen.\n\nSniper Rifles\n\nChukavin SVCh\n\nThe Chukavin SVCh appears as the \"SVK\", which was the name of the prototype version that was displayed in 2016. It appears to be a 7.62x51mm variant, and by default uses 5-round magazines of high-power ammo - it can switch to a 15-round extended magazine, the standard 10-round mag, or use AP 5-round magazines. The short five rounders appear to be from the .338 variant.\n\nAI Russian snipers use the SVCh as their standard DMR in gameplay.\n\nDenel Mechem NTW-20\n\nA stylized/hypothetical man-portable variant of the Denel Mechem NTW-20 appears as the \"NTW-50.\" The actual caliber is not clearly defined, although the name infers that it may be .50 BMG or possibly 12.7x108mm - the Indian Vidhwansak clone of the NTW-20 apparently has a caliber conversion for the latter chambering. The \"NTW-50\" has limited Attachments+ options due to its specialized nature. It can change optics and comes with a bipod permanently affixed. It comes with four round Anti-Material magazines by default, with \"High-Power Anti-Material\" three round magazines as the only other unlockable ammo option.\n\nDSR-Precision DSR-1\n\nThe DSR-Precision DSR-1 appears as the \"DXR-1\". As with the third-person views of the AK-12 and SCAR-H, the DSR appears to have its bolt and magazine bugged in the reveal trailer.\n\nIt uses 5-round high-power magazines by default, with a 5-round armor-piercing alternative, or 8-round or 12-round extended magazines in \"Standard Issue\" ammunition. Like the Flux Defense MP17, when doing a reload with the initial reserve magazine, the character will take the reserve magazine and use it to replenish ammo.\n\nHeckler & Koch G28\n\nThe Heckler & Koch G28 was added in Season 6 as the \"G428\".\n\nSako TRG M10\n\nThe Sako TRG M10 initially appeared in prerelease materials as the \"TG-24\", but by release had been renamed to the \"SWS-10\". It is the first sniper rifle available. It uses 10-round magazines by default, and can switch to a notably smaller cartridge in 14-round magazines; the magazine well adapter for the latter type is labelled as the \"SWS-10 Magazine Adapter\" (originally under the TG-24 moniker). It also features a 12-round extended magazine, or a 6-rounder in high power or armor-piercing.\n\nTTS Xceed\n\nThe TTS Xceed makes its debut in Season 5 as the \"XCE Bar\".\n\nVSS Vintorez\n\nA VSS Vintorez is included as part of Season 1: Zero Hour content as the \"BSV-M\" (presumably \"Бесшумная Снайперская Винтовка - Модернизиированная\", or \"Besshumnaya Snayperskaya Vintovka - Modernizirovannaya\", meaning \"Silent Sniper Rifle - Modernized\"); contrary to what its description (which calls it \"The last iteration of the classic Russian rifle\") and its name would suggest, it is not a modernized VSSM variant, as it lacks that variant's railed dustcover and adjustable stock. It has a Zenit B-13 scope mount for attachments, with a PSO-1M3 as default, and a black-colored stock. By default, it is equipped with its 10-round subsonic magazine, and can be fitted with a 20 or 30-round subsonic or regular close range magazine, as well as the 20-round high power ammo, allowing it to function as a suppressed assault rifle akin to the AS Val due to its select-fire capability. In the Portal logic editor, it is referred to by its real name.\n\nIt features a shortened barrel by default; barrel options include a shortened and an enlarged suppressor, with the latter allowing a complete VSS build, and the former making it as short as the SR-3 Vikhr.\n\nThe Bad Company 2 VSS was shown in a Portal promotional image but has not been released.\n\nMachine Guns\n\nFightLite MCR\n\nSeason 7 has introduced the FightLite MCR in the LMG class, under the name \"DFR Strife\". It feeds from belts, with the option to use PMAGs inserted into the magwell, unlike the Beta C-Mags from Battlefield 4.\n\nFN EVOLYS\n\nThe FN EVOLYS 7.62 was added in Season 2: Master of Arms, as the \"Avancys\", albeit using what appears to be 5.56x45mm NATO in 100-round boxes by default (extended 200-round belts can also be used). 7.62 ammunition can be equipped when using the \"High-Power\" or \"Armor Piercing\" ammunition options, both in 50-round belt boxes. Described as an LMG made from polymer and 3D printing, the EVOLYS in-game possesses the most controllable aspects for the in-game LMGs, probably mirroring the real life incarnation designed to be as lightweight as possible.\n\nKalashnikov RPL-20\n\nThe Kalashnikov RPL-20 light machine gun makes its debut in Battlefield 2042 as the \"RPT-31\" in Season 4. By default, it fires \"high-power\" ammo at 600 RPM, and features an extended barrel (corresponding to the real weapon's barrel length) and a foregrip similar to the bullpup PKP. It can be tuned to fire standard ammo and shorten its barrel to increase its rate of fire up to 900 RPM, and is also the only weapon in the game to equip the 1P87 holographic sight.\n\nKnight's Armament LWAMG\n\nThe Knight's Armament LWAMG appears as the \"LCMG\" and is the default MG available from the start. It is fitted with the telescoping stock of a KAC LMG A1, and has the ability to select-fire with a semi-automatic mode, even though the real weapon is full-auto only. The LWAMG is used by US AI support gunners.\n\nPKP Pecheneg Bullpup\n\nThe PKP Pecheneg Bullpup appears under the name \"PKP-BP\", with an AK-12 rear sight mounted on its rail. By default, it fires from a 200-round belt box (incorrectly modeled as a 100-rounder) at 800 RPM, and can switch between armor-piercing, high-power, and subsonic ammo, all of which hold 100 rounds in a smaller belt box. Russian AI machine gunners use the bullpup Pecheneg as their standard LMG.\n\nIt also appears as part of the \"SG-36 Sentry System\" that Specialist Pyotr \"Boris\" Guskovsky has access to, fitted with a large muzzle brake.\n\nLaunchers\n\nBates & Dittus ExD-37\n\nThe \"SPH Explosive\" launcher introduced in Season 4 is modelled on the B&D ExD-37, a civilian flare launcher and is equipped with a SIG Romeo 5 red dot sight. It fires two high-explosive rounds from a superimposed Metal Storm style cartridge.\n\nCarl Gustaf M4\n\nThe Carl Gustaf M4 appears as the \"Recoilless M5\" for the Engineer class (in early builds it was named the \"Carl Gustaf M5\", but this was changed by the Beta), featuring a built-in rangefinder in its optic mount, which updates every time the launcher is aimed. When fired, it advises the user to load a new shell.\n\nAI Engineer/Demolition-type soldiers of both sides use the Carl Gustav by default.\n\n\"G-84 TGM\"\n\nSpecialist Ewelina Lis, added in the Zero Hour season, has a unique version of the M4 as her gadget; known as the \"G-84 TGM\", it fires short-ranged, slow-moving TV-guided missiles. These are apparently caseless; while it does use a similar reload animation to the basic version, no spent case is removed after firing, and the round inserted appears to simply be the entire projectile.\n\nCZ 805 G1\n\nA CZ 805 G1 grenade launcher is used as the 40mm Smoke Launcher gadget introduced with Season 1: Zero Hour. It has a fairly standard arc sight for aiming, and the projectile disperses into three smoke plumes upon landing.\n\nFGM-172 SRAW\n\nThe FGM-172 SRAW was added in Season 7.\n\nFIM-92 Stinger\n\nThe FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft launcher appears in the game. It was mentioned in official blog posts as the \"FIM-33 AA Missile\", and was first seen in the Exodus short film, used by returning character Irish from Battlefield 4. As of the beta and current release, it is now called the \"FXM-33 AA Missile\".\n\nThe weapon is \"reloaded\" by simply discarding the empty launcher, and the new one having its tracking device flapped before deployment (as of the December update).\n\nAn unmodified FIM-92 is available in Portal as part of the legacy BF3 equipment.\n\nFB GP\n\nThe FB GP underbarrel grenade launcher can be mounted on the MCX-SPEAR, \"AC-42\", DDM4, RM277, SVCh, Sako TRG, and LWAMG. The model featured in-game is the original design with an angled foregrip, even though this version was abandoned in favor of a more conventional design in reality.\n\nFN EGLM\n\nAn FN EGLM is the permanent underbarrel attachment for the SCAR-H (SFAR-M GL). It can swap between normal 40mm, armor piercing, smoke, and incendiary grenades via the Plus menu when set up.\n\nGP-30M\n\nThe GP-30M can be mounted on the AK-12's handguard, and can be used with the AN-94 and AEK-971 in Portal.\n\nHeckler & Koch XM25\n\nSeason 3 Specialist Rasheed Zain uses an \"XM370A\" airburst grenade launcher as his gadget, which appears as a resurrected, futurized Heckler & Koch XM25, previously featured and functions similarly to its Battlefield 4 incarnation. The only main divergence is the XM370A has five-round magazines, and doesn't +1 in the chamber.\n\nRM M203PI\n\nAn RM Equipment M203PI was added into All Out War as an optional attachment for the Ak 5C in Season 7.\n\nGrenades & Explosives\n\n\"EMP Grenade\"\n\nThe \"EMP Grenade\" appears to be a (heavily) futurized Breda Mod. 35, with a similar overall profile and distinctive curved spoon that sits flat against the body; as the name implies, the in-game grenade produces a gadget-disabling (and, in some cases, gadget-destroying) EMP upon detonation. Curiously, this affects player characters' HUDs, implying that they are the result of some form of electronic device (despite few of the game's characters wearing anything in front of their eyes that could be responsible for it); even more bizarrely, the EMP does actual damage (albeit not very much), allowing enemies with sufficiently low health to be killed by it.\n\n\"Incendiary Grenade\"\n\nThe \"Incendiary Grenade\" appears to be of fictional design, with a roughly cylindrical body (made of red-anodized aluminum) that tapers up towards the top; several grenades could have served as the basis, though the most reasonable (both in terms of design and its in-game function) would be an M34 White Phosphorous grenade with the fuze assembly stuck in the opposite end.\n\nLiberty Dynamic Enhanced Distraction Device\n\nThe \"Concussion Grenade\" is based on the Liberty Dynamic Enhanced Distraction Device, only significantly deviating in its fictional markings. The in-game name is misleading - a concussion grenade is simply an explosive grenade that produces no shrapnel (relying solely on the pressure wave produced by the explosion to deal damage); they are not less-lethal devices, with examples like the MK3 offensive hand grenade and No. 69 High-Explosive Grenade being explicitly intended to cause fatal injuries. Regardless, the in-game grenade functions as the actual EDD does (i.e. as a typical flashbang).\n\nNammo Scalable Offensive Hand Grenade\n\nA futuristic hand grenade that heavily resembles the Nammo Scalable Offensive Hand Grenade (SOHG) appears as the default fragmentation grenade in the 2042-era. Its markings appear to be inspired by those of the German-made DM51 hand grenade, reading \"SPLITTER\" (meaning \"FRAGMENTATION\"), \"DM65A2\", and \"LOS DN-3-283\"; curiously, it lacks the DM51's top-line marking, \"HGR\", which clarifies that the device in question is a hand grenade.\n\nRKG-3\n\nThe \"Anti-Tank Grenade\" added in Season 5: New Dawn appears to be a futurized RKG-3 anti-tank grenade. Like the real grenade, it is impact-detonated; unlike the real grenade, however, it only detonates on impact with vehicles (exploding on a 5-second timer otherwise), and is not fin-stabilized, simply damaging vehicles with its blast rather than using a directional shaped charge like the actual RKG-3.\n\n\"Smoke Grenade\"\n\nThe \"Smoke Grenade\" is another seemingly-fictional design, with a stout cylindrical body that tapers slightly towards the top; it may have been based on the Australian F1 hand grenade (albeit smoothed out, and with the same fuze-end-inversion as the Incendiary Grenade), or possibly a substantially re-profiled M15 White Phosphorous grenade, though it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nT13 Beano\n\nAdded in Season 5: New Dawn, the \"Spring Grenade\" is a futurized T13 Beano. Whereas the real weapon was simply a ball-shaped impact grenade, the in-game one instead detonates on a timer, with a small thruster (supposedly spring-activated, hence the name) to launch it into the air just prior to detonation, in a similar vein to bounding antipersonnel mines like the S-Mine, or the M397 \"jump-up\" 40x46mm HE grenade (though both of these use secondary explosive charges instead of thrusters to launch themselves). For whatever reason, the Spring Grenade also leaves behind an orange tracer-like trail when thrown.\n\nV40 Mini Grenade\n\nSundance's Scatter grenade gadget appears to be several V40 Mini Grenades tied together to some sort of apparatus that allows it to perform as a guided grenade when thrown.\n\nThe V40 itself was added as a usable gadget in Season 5: New Dawn; it behaves similarly to its past incarnations in the series, offering extra grenades (3, to be exact) and a longer throw distance in exchange for reduced damage and a smaller blast radius.\n\nMounted & Emplaced Weapons\n\nBrowning M2 QCB\n\nThe Browning M2 QCB is mounted on various vehicles and robots.\n\nDillon Aero M134 Minigun\n\nDual M134 Miniguns appears mounted on the \"MD540 Nightbird\" helicopter in the reveal trailer and Griffon-type hovercraft in promotional images. Three are also mounted on the nose of the \"MV38-Condor\" transport; the pilot's HUD and passenger list strongly imply that each of its three Miniguns is operated independently by three different passengers in the vehicle. Specialist Charlie Crawford has access to a tripod-mounted M134 with a bulletproof shield surrounding it that is referred to as the \"Mounted Vulcan,\" a reference to the far larger 20mm M61 Vulcan that the Minigun is a scaled-down version of.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GAU-22/A\n\nThe \"F-35E Panther\" (a 2042-era updated F-35B Lightning II variant) uses the General Dynamics GAU-22/A in a correct underslung gun pod.\n\nGeneral Electric M61 Vulcan\n\nThe GE M61 Vulcan is seen on a CIWS installation from a Battlefield Portal promotional image, and a F/A-18E Super Hornet that carries the M61A2 variant is also shown. It is also available as a stationary emplacement for Season 5 in the \"Reclaimed\" map.\n\nZU-23-2\n\nZU-23 are mounted onto the \"EBAA Wildcat\" which appears to be an EBRC Jaguar. Judging by pre release screenshots, the vehicles in game might have customization not unlike BFV. There seems to be options to change parts such as primary armament to a \"40mm cannon\" or \"57mm cannon\" as alternates to the \"AA double cannon\".\n\nGryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-57 is the standard fighter jet for the Russian-aligned No-Pat faction, and the Sukhoi Su-35BM from Battlefield 3 is included in the Portal mode. Both feature the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 autocannon.\n\nM230 Chain Gun\n\nThe 2042-era futurized \"AH-64GX Apache Warchief\" and the AH-64D Longbow in BF Portal content have the M230 Chain Gun as secondary armament used by the gunner position.\n\nShipunov 2A42\n\nThe Kamov \"Ka-520 Super Hokum\" and the legacy content Mil Mi-28N and BMP-2 all have Shipunov 2A42 autocannons. A \"BMD-3\" was introduced for the Bad Company 2 Russian faction, though the model is actually a BMD-4.\n\nOther\n\nBeretta M9 (Unusable)\n\nAn unused Beretta M9 is present in the drop-leg holster of Navin Rao's typical kit. Kimball Graves/Irish's \"True Patriot\" uniform from Battlefield 4 also has one holstered.\n\nGlock 17 (Unusable)\n\nGlock 17 pistols are also visible in the holsters of several Specialists. They visibly lack the selector of the usable \"G57\" and have black frames - likely, these are the same G17 model from previous games.\n\n\"Rorsch Mk-4\" Railgun\n\nThe successor to Battlefield 4's Final Stand's Mk-1, the Mk-4 appears in Season 3, this time as a mag-fed, bullpup railgun.\n\nThe Mk-4 functions as a jack-of-all-trades weapon through its underbarrel battery system. The battery can be changed in the Plus system to utilize full-auto with low energy, burst-fire with medium energy, and semi-auto with high speed, high energy projectiles. Equipping its proprietary \"NVK-NXT 2x\" optic allows for visual cues on charge times.\n\n\"S21 Syrette Pistol\"\n\nSupport Specialist Maria Falck uses the fictional S21 Syrette Pistol as her exclusive equipment. It has the loose silhouette of the Pneu Dart X-2 Tranquilizer Pistol, though its details are different, and its dart loading port is located at where the X-2's pressure gauge is located in reality. It is fitted with a C-More red dot sight instead of the proprietary sight.\n\nBattlefield Portal\n\nLegacy weapons have access to the same Attachments+ system if it is enabled in the game rules. As of the Season 2 Update, BF1942 weapons have access to some vintage optical sights, mostly ported from Battlefield V (including the Nydar sight).\n\nNearing the end of Season 4 in preparation for Season 5, various Vault Weapons can accept attachments from the main 2042 All-Out Warfare mode.\n\nHandguns\n\nBeretta 93R(*)\n\nThe \"M93R\" returns as an available sidearm for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions, and it is available for 2042 multiplayer as of Update 3.1. This time it is an actual Beretta 93R instead of the modified M9s that appeared in the original games. It uses extended 20-round magazines.\n\nColt M1911A1\n\nThe M1911A1 returns as an available sidearm for 1942 and Bad Company 2 factions, with the 1942 variant slightly more worn than its BC2 counterpart.\n\nSimilar to P38, interrupting the empty reload results in the hammer disappearing entirely.\n\n\"MEU(SOC)\"(*)\n\nA modern M1911 variant is available to the Battlefield 3 factions, apparently standing in for the actual MEU(SOC) that was originally used in BF3. It resembles either a stainless Kimber Target II or Springfield Armory Loaded, given the finish, adjustable target rear sight, and grip panels. As of Update 2.1 is available in regular 2042 multiplayer.\n\nMP-412 REX(*)\n\nThe MP-412 REX revolver returns as an available sidearm for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions, and for No-Pats in 2042 as of Update 2.2.\n\nMP-443 Grach(*)\n\nThe MP-443 Grach returns as an available sidearm for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions, and for 2042 multiplayer as of Update 4.1. The model has a much more correctly-shaped slide and set of sights compared to its appearances in previous games.\n\n\"Tracer Dart Gun\"(*)\n\nThe fictional \"Tracer Dart Gun\" from Bad Company 2 returns as a sidearm for Bad Company 2 factions, and is available for Recon Specialists as of Update 3.2.\n\nWalther P38\n\nThe Walther P38 returns as an available sidearm for 1942 factions.\n\nWebley Mk VI\n\nThe Webley Mk VI returns as an available sidearm for 1942 factions as of Update 3.1.2.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nFN P90 TR(*)\n\nThe FN P90 TR returns as an available submachine gun for Battlefield 3 factions. As of Update 2.1, the P90 is now available in regular 2042 multiplayer. It has markings on the side of the receiver that state \"Freedom National Boston MERICA\" on the nameplate, with an inscription beneath of \"FNB UGA LOS ANGELES CA\" and \"RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY.\"\n\nM1A1 Thompson\n\nThe M1A1 Thompson returns as an available submachine gun for 1942 and Bad Company 2 factions - note that while Bad Company 2 featured a weapon named the M1A1, it was actually a mislabelled M1928. It has a 30 round magazine and is simply called \"Thompson\"; its in-game description misidentifies it as an M1928A1.\n\nMP40\n\nThe MP40 returns as an available submachine gun for 1942 factions.\n\nPP-2000(*)\n\nThe PP-2000 returns as an available submachine gun for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. It is also available for 2042 multiplayer as of Update 3.2.\n\nSten Mk II\n\nThe Sten Mk II returns as an available submachine gun for 1942 factions as of Update 3.1.2.\n\nShotguns\n\nBrowning Auto-5\n\nThe Browning Auto-5 returns with the same \"12g Automatic\" name from Battlefield 1 and V for 1942 factions as of Update 3.1.2. Like its original incarnation, it fires at a slow rate of fire.\n\nFranchi SPAS-12\n\nThe SPAS-12 returns as an available shotgun for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. It has a fixed eight-round capacity, whereas it had a limited four (+1 with BF3) capacity by default in the original games - an extended magazine was available as a specialization or attachment in those games, and can now fire in semiauto and pump-action modes.\n\nM26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System\n\nUpdate 2.1 brought back the M26 MASS for the Battlefield 3 Assault Rifles - though only as an underbarrel, as with the M320. It is available on the M16A3, HK416, and G3A3, and can fire buckshot, slug, flechette, and FRAG-12 rounds.\n\nSWD/Cobray Street Sweeper\n\nBattlefield 3's \"DAO-12\" returns under the same name, and appears to be a SWD/Cobray Street Sweeper based on the winding knob.\n\nRifles\n\n5.56A-91(*)\n\nThe 5.56A-91 returns as an available carbine for Batlefield 3 factions, and is available in All-Out Warfare as part of Season 3's Vault Weapons.\n\nAEK-971(*)\n\nThe AEK-971 has been introduced as part of Season 2 content, available under both its Bad Company and BF3 style incarnations for each versions' style of content. As of Update 4.1, the BF3 version is now available for 2042 multiplayer. When mounting optics, it uses a special mount based on AK platform mounts for optics.\n\nAKS-74U(*)\n\nBad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 Engineer kits have access to the AKS-74U - in BC2, Engineers carried submachine guns or compact carbines, and BF3 Engineers carried carbines by default. It was added to All-Out Warfare as of Season 2 and is oddly classed under the SMG category (Soviet style), though this might be to due to the similar AM-17 already being classified in 2042's rifle category.\n\nAN-94\n\nThe AN-94 returns as an available assault rifle for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. It correctly features its reciprocating barrel, canted magazine, and accurate hyperburst rate of fire akin to BF4. It also features its unique two-round hyperburst when firing in full auto, a mandatory feature of the AN-94 that was added in Update 4.2.0.\n\nAS Val\n\nThe AS Val returns for Battlefield 3 factions, as in that game classed as a \"PDW\" or submachine gun. It uses 20-round magazines by default (modeled in actual 10-rounders), and an extended 30-round mag modeled in the actual 20-rounder can be selected with the Attachments Plus system.\n\nColt Model 901(*)\n\nThe \"M16A3\" returns as an available assault rifle for the Battlefield 3 factions. This time, it is actually modeled after a select-fire Colt Model 901 (marketed as an M16A3) instead of the original game's Colt Sporter Competition. While the animation of the selector switch during spawn is a great detail to have, the selector itself is upside-down. In gameplay the rifle also has Auto/Burst/Semi settings, which isn't technically correct but may have done to allow the function of the original game's true A4 variant. The default rear sight carry handle appears to be rather haphazardly taken from the M16A2 below and kitbashed with the rail mount section of a detachable carry handle. The resulting rear sight assembly sits rather noticeably higher than it should be, especially compared to the A2 above.\n\nAs of Season 2, the M16A3 can be unlocked for use in regular 2042 multiplayer.\n\nFN SCAR-H CQC\n\nThe FN SCAR-H CQC returns as an available carbine for Battlefield 3 factions. It is a third generation model instead of the first generation model of the original game.\n\nGewehr 43\n\nThe Gewehr 43 returns as a semi-auto rifle option for 1942 Scouts and Engineers as of Update 3.1.2, with the former sporting a ZF4 optic.\n\nHeckler & Koch G3A3\n\nThe G3A3 returns as an available assault rifle for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. Despite both games featuring the G3A3, the version for Bad Company 2 factions follows that game's lead by just naming it the \"G3\". Attaching accessories to the handguard such as vertical foregrips or lasers will modify the weapon model to feature a tri railed handguard.\n\nHeckler & Koch HK416(*)\n\nThe Heckler & Koch HK416 returns as an available assault rifle for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. The model appears to be based on the HK416 D14.5RS a la the incarnation from Battlefield 4, as opposed to the D10RS from Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3. It has a rare easter egg reload, which shows 416 being flipped upside down after flinging a magazine midair. As of Season 3, the 416 is available for 2042 All-Out-Warfare modes.\n\nHeckler & Koch XM8\n\nThe Heckler & Koch XM8 returns as an available assault rifle for Bad Company 2 factions.\n\nHeckler & Koch XM8 Compact Carbine\n\nThe Heckler & Koch XM8 Compact Carbine returns for Bad Company 2 factions, as in that game classed as a submachine gun. It is shown with a tan color scheme, which in reality was only applied to the Heckler & Koch XM8 Automatic Rifle.\n\nIMI MTAR-21(*)\n\nThe latest 3.2 update adds the MTAR-21 for Battlefield 3 and 2042 loadouts. In addition to the standard full-auto and semi-auto firemodes, it has an incorrect 3-round burst mode.\n\nM1 Carbine\n\nThe Season 2 update added an \"M2 Carbine\" as part of the BF1942 content set (despite the M2 never appearing in said game); it appears to be a modified version of the BFV model, sans that version's Plainfield foregrip, metal upper handguard, and, bafflingly enough, its fire selector, technically making the weapon an M1 Carbine instead.\n\nM1 Garand\n\nThe M1 Garand returns as an available rifle for 1942 and Bad Company 2 factions. A sniper variant, the M1C Garand, has been added for 1942 as of Update 3.1.2.\n\nM16A2\n\nThe M16A2 appears as an available assault rifle for the Bad Company 2 factions, replacing the misidentified M16A4 from the original game. It mounts the Kobra sight on a dogleg extension off of the carry handle, and the ACOG scope attaches via the optic mount hole drilled into the top of the carry handle. Equipping an M203 also modifies the weapon model with a M203 heatshield.\n\nRemington ACR(*)\n\nThe Remington ACR returns as an available carbine for Battlefield 3 factions, as in that game named the \"ACW-R\", and has been added to All-Out Warfare as of 2.2. It also retains the unique 6.5 Grendel chambering, with a 26+1 capacity.\n\nSturmgewehr 44\n\nThe Sturmgewehr 44 returns as an available rifle for 1942 factions.\n\nSniper Rifles\n\nBarrett M95\n\nThe Barrett M95 from Bad Company 2 was added as part of Season 2 content.\n\nBarrett M98B\n\nThe Barrett M98B returns as an available sniper rifle for Battlefield 3 factions. Previously it had a full 10+1 magazine capacity akin to Battlefield 4, however it has been reverted to the original's reduced 5+1 capacity. Latest updates added functionality to the M98B's BORS, adding a rangefinder measured in yards.\n\nGOL Magnum(*)\n\nThe GOL sniper rifle returns as an available sniper rifle for Bad Company 2 factions, and is available in All-Out Warfare as of Update 2.1.\n\nKarabiner 98k\n\nThe Karabiner 98k returns as an available rifle for 1942 factions.\n\nLee-Enfield No. 4 Mk. I\n\nThe Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I returns from Battlefield 1942. Like that game, it will have a five-round capacity if the map features classic settings—half its actual one. As of Update 3.1.2, an unscoped version was provided for the Engineer class, but it will still reload with loose rounds and does not use clips.\n\nM24 Sniper Weapon System\n\nThe M24 sniper rifle returns as an available sniper rifle for Bad Company 2 factions.\n\nM39 EMR(*)\n\nThe M39 EMR is an available sniper rifle for Battlefield 3 factions, replacing the misidentified M14 in a Sage chassis the original game had. Previously, the M39 had fully-loaded 20-rounder magazines - they were reduced to 10 in BF3's multiplayer for balancing reasons, which is its current capacity. As of Update 3.2, the M39 is now available for 2042 multiplayer.\n\nThe related Mk. 14 Mod 0 that was in Bad Company 2 is not part of Portal content.\n\nSVD Dragunov(*)\n\nThe SVD Dragunov returns as an available rifle for Battlefield 3 factions - or rather, it replaces the NDM-86 masquerading as a Russian SVD that game had. As of Season 4, it is available for 2042 multiplayer.\n\nMachine Guns\n\nBren MkII\n\nAs of the Season 2 update, the Bren Mk2 returns as a light machinegun for the 1942 factions. The menu description erroneously states that it fires the same round as the Browning Automatic Rifle.\n\nHeckler & Koch XM8 Automatic Rifle(*)\n\nThe H&K XM8 Automatic Rifle returns as an available light machine gun for Bad Company 2 factions, as in that game named the \"XM8 LMG\", and as of Season 3, available in 2042 multiplayer.\n\nM1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle\n\nThe M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle returns as an available light machine gun for 1942 factions.\n\nM240B(*)\n\nThe M240B returns as an available light machine gun for Battlefield 3 factions, and as of Update 3.1, available for 2042 factions.\n\nM249 SAW\n\nSeason 2 reintroduces the M249 SAW variants for the Bad Company 2 and BF3 factions. The former has the short barreled M249 Paratrooper variant, and the latter has the standard clubfoot stock and Mk.46 rails.\n\nM60\n\nThe M60 returns as an available light machine gun for Bad Company 2 factions.\n\nM60E4(*)\n\nThe M60E4 returns as an available light machine gun for Battlefield 3 factions. As of the Season 2 update, it can be unlocked for the 2042 era by an assignment, and can have a rare chance to get an easter egg reload where the character throws the entire MG before replacing it with a new one.\n\nRPK\n\nThe RPK returns with Update 4.1, as part of Bad Company 2 content - while not originally in that game, it was featured in its Vietnam DLC. As with the DLC incarnation, it uses the 75-round Molot drum magazines, though with a 90-round capacity.\n\nRPK-74(*)\n\nA RPK-74 appears as a new light machine gun for Battlefield 3 factions, and base 2042 multiplayer as of Update 4.1. This time the model is an actual polymer furnished RPK-74 and not a black-colored RPK, though still not quite the actual \"RPK-74M\" that has been used as an in-game name since BF3 (the folding stock hardware is not present). It can equip 60-round quad stack magazines, which was an available attachment in BF3 though it did not alter the 40-round 7.62x39 magazine model in that game.\n\nQJY-88(*)\n\nThe QJY-88 returns as an available light machine gun for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions, and as of Season 4, for 2042 multiplayer.\n\nLaunchers\n\nFGM-148 Javelin(*)\n\nThe FGM-148 Javelin returns as an available launcher for Battlefield 3 factions, and as of Update 3.2, for 2042 multiplayer for the Engineer class. The Javelin features both top-down and direct attack modes.\n\nHeckler & Koch M320\n\nThe Heckler & Koch M320 returns from Battlefield 3 as an available underbarrel attachment for that game's versions of the M16A3 and HK416. Unlike the original game, it is only available as an underbarrel attachment and cannot be used on its own, due to being classed as a weapon attachment instead of as a gadget.\n\nHeckler & Koch XM320\n\nThe XM320 returns from Bad Company 2 as an available underbarrel attachment for the XM8.\n\nM1A1 Bazooka\n\nBF1942 factions have access to the M1A1 Bazooka. Originally, this was the foregrip-equipped M1 model in 1942 but the M1A1 model from BFV has been reused for Portal instead.\n\nPansarskott m/86\n\nThe Saab Bofors Dynamics Panserskott m/86 moonlighting as an M136 AT4 returns as an available launcher for Bad Company 2 factions, with the same SACLOS functionality.\n\nM203 Grenade Launcher\n\nThe M203 grenade launcher returns from Bad Company 2 as an available underbarrel attachment for that game's versions of the M16A2 and HK416.\n\nMk 153 SMAW\n\nThe Mk 153 SMAW returns as an available launcher for Battlefield 3 factions.\n\nPanzerschreck\n\nThe Panzerschreck returns as an available launcher for 1942 factions. As in that game, it is the RPzB 43 variant, which lacks the blast shield.\n\nRPG-7\n\nThe RPG-7 returns as an available launcher for Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 factions. As in the original games, the version available for Bad Company 2 factions has a PGO-7 scope while the Battlefield 3 version has iron sights.\n\nSA-18 Grouse\n\nBattlefield 3 factions have access to the SA-18 Grouse/9K38 Igla MANPADS launcher.\n\nGrenades & Explosives\n\n\"HG-2\" Grenade\n\nThe fictional HG-2 hand grenade returns as the sole grenade available to Bad Company 2 factions, as in that game referred to simply as a \"Frag Grenade\". It still resembles the original fictional hybrid of a Mills Bomb with the fuze assembly from a M67 frag grenade, complete with the iconic Smiley Face pin. Which was apparently too iconic and had to be changed due to copyright reasons....\n\nM15 Anti-Tank mine\n\nThe M15 anti-tank mine returns as a gadget available to Battlefield 3 factions.\n\nM18 Smoke Grenade\n\nAs of an update, M18 smoke grenades are usable for all legacy Portal factions.\n\nM18A1 Claymore(*)\n\nThe M18A1 Claymore returns as a gadget available to Battlefield 3 and 2042 factions, with the latter as of Update 3.2.\n\nM67 Hand Grenade\n\nThe M67 hand grenade returns as the sole grenade available to Battlefield 3 factions.\n\nMk 2 hand grenade\n\nThe Mk 2 hand grenade returns as one of two grenades available to 1942 factions.\n\nModel 24 Stielhandgranate\n\nThe Model 24 Stielhandgranate returns as one of two grenades available to 1942 factions.\n\nTellermine 42\n\nTellermine 42s are used by the BF1942-era Engineers.\n\nTS-50\n\nThe same fictionalized TS-50 anti-personnel mine style mine from the Bad Company series games is recreated for the Bad Company 2 factions in Portal. It is physically enlarged and stylized, and serves as an anti-vehicle mine.\n\nMounted & Emplaced Weapons\n\n21 cm Mörser 18\n\nSeveral German 21 cm Mörser 18 howitzers are seen on the \"Battle of the Bulge\" and \"El Alamein\" maps.\n\n2A38M autocannon\n\nThe 2S6M Tunguska is usable by the BF3 Russian forces as their anti-air ground vehicle. It has twin 2A38M autocannons.\n\nAT-14 Spriggan\n\nAT-14 Spriggan/9K135 Kornet ATGM emplacements are found on Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 maps that feature modern Russian ground forces.\n\nBGM-71 TOW\n\nBGM-71 TOW launchers can be found on the BC2 and BF3 maps as the standard ATGM of the US Armed Forces. The M3A3 Bradley and LAV-25 also have usable TOW launchers as selectable secondary weapons.\n\nBrowning M2 Heavy Barrel\n\nOlder Browning M2HB machine guns are present in Portal, usually mounted on various vehicles. They can be found as stationary emplacements on the BF1942 maps. The Bad Company 2 Humvee uses the Browning, while it had an XM312 in the original game.\n\nBrowning AN/M2\n\nUSAAF B-17 bombers return from Battlefield 1942, armed with numerous Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns.\n\nBofors 40mm\n\nThe Bofors 40mm appears on El Alamein as part of Battlefield 1942 legacy content.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GAU-12/U\n\nThe USMC's LAV-AD equipped with the GAU-12/U returns as part of the legacy Battlefield 3 content, although its incorrectly shown as a 6-barreled weapon instead of its true 5 barrels.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GAU-17/A\n\nThe UH-60 Blackhawk that serves as the modern US forces transport helicopter in Portal has its two standard side-mounted GAU-17/A miniguns.\n\nGeneral Electric GAU-8/A Avenger\n\nAs of an update, the A-10C Thunderbolt II is available to the Battlefield 3 USMC faction. It has the General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger as its primary armament.\n\nGIAT M693\n\nThe same update also brings back the South African upgraded Mi-24 \"SuperHind\" of the original Bad Company series returns for the BC2 Russian faction. It has the distinct South African made GIAT M693 20mm nose autocannon.\n\nGryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-2\n\nAn update to Portal has brought the Sukhoi Su-25TM \"Grach/Frogfoot\" back as an attacker aircraft for the Battlefield 3 Russian forces.\n\nHispano-Suiza HS.404\n\nSupermarine Spitfires return from Battlefield 1942, armed with Hispano-Suiza HS.404 autocannons.\n\nKord\n\nThe Kord heavy machine gun is mounted on various Russian Army vehicles.\n\nKVPT\n\nThe GAZ-3937 Vodnik from Battlefield 3 has a turret mounted KPV machine gun, rather than the remote KORD that it had in the original game. Oddly, it isn't available for the Bad Company 2 Russian Army despite also being in that game.\n\nM240\n\nModern American armored vehicles have mounted M240C coaxial machine guns, and the reimagined \"UAV-1\" (Northrop Grumman MQ-8) from Bad Company 2 has a nose mounted M240 variant similar to the M240D or M240H.\n\nM242 Bushmaster Chaingun\n\nThe M3A3 Bradley and LAV-25 have mounted M242 Bushmaster chainguns as their primary weapons.\n\nMG17\n\nGerman Ju 87 \"Stuka\" dive bombers have wing-mounted MG17s.\n\nMG 34\n\nThe MG 34 with the Patronentrommel 34 drum magazine is mounted on the roof of the Pz.IV tank turret, replacing the MG42s from the original game.\n\nMG 34 Panzerlauf\n\nThe MG 34 Panzerlauf is mounted coaxially within the turret of the Pz.IV tank.\n\nMG42\n\nMG42s are mounted in German emplacements on the El Alamein and Battle of the Bulge maps.\n\nMk 19 Grenade Launcher"
