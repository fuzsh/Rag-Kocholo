        "text": ".44 Magnum\n\nAs seen in: Dirty Harry (1971)\n\nThe iconic handcannon of the Seventies almost didn’t appear onscreen: in his original script, John Milius had specified a “.44 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 29 with a four-inch barrel”, but the Model 29 was no longer in production. In fact, it took a gruff personal plea from Clint Eastwood himself before Smith & Wesson technicians agreed to cobble together the guns from spare parts. At which point two extra long barrels - an 8 3/8\" and a 6 1/2\" barrel – were added for Inspector Harry Callahan to wave around phallically throughout the film.\n\nAK-47\n\nAs seen in: Lord Of War (2005)\n\nDirectors! Does your screenplay contain a) ill-defined Middle Eastern terrorists types, b) bloodthirsty sub-Saharan militias or c) someone sinister and Chinese looking? Then be sure to ask your weapons wrangler for a clutch of these 7.62mm assault rifles. Since being first developed during WW2 by Mikhail Kalashnikov, the AK-47’s incredible reliability and low production costs practically redefined modern warfare - appearing everywhere from Serbia to Kashmir to the Mexican drug wars to the Mozambique national flag. Even today, an estimated 75 million AK-47s are still in circulation worldwide. Making it, arguably, the human invention responsible for the most death in history.\n\nMcMillan TAC-338A\n\nAs seen in: American Sniper (2014)\n\nChief Petty Officer Chris Kyle was known as “Shaitan Ar-Ramadi” among Afghan insurgents – the Devil of Ramadi. And his long-range tactical rifle, clutched so authentically by Bradley Cooper in this year’s controversial biopic, was one lethal reason why. Perched on a Harris bipod with a Leupold Mark 4 scope, the TAC-338A possessed a phenomenal range. In 2008, Kyle killed an insurgent outside Sadr City at a range of 2,100 yards (1,920 m). And the TAC-338’s older brother, the TAC-50, was even more deadly: in 2002, Canadian sniper Corporal Rob Furlong set a record by killing an enemy combatant from 2,430 metres. That’s over a mile and a half away.\n\nBeretta 92F\n\nAs seen in: Lethal Weapon (1987), Die Hard (1988)\n\nBuilt by the oldest firearms company in the world (Beretta of Brescia in Italy, in business since 1526), the 92 model of 1972 only really became popular... when Mel Gibson put one in his mouth. While playing suicidal cop Martin Riggs in 1987’s Lethal Weapon, you understand. Such cheeriness prompted a huge sales spike, and after it was further popularised in the Far East by action hero Chow Yun Fat, the 92F model became Hollywood’s gun of choice, appearing in over 500 films - including 1988’s Die Hard, where Bruce Willis used the original Lethal Weapon prop gun to shoot through the boardroom table. The prop now assumes pride of place at the National Rifle Association’s Firearms Museum in Virginia. In 1985 the 92F replaced the .45 ACP pistol as the standard semi-automatic of the US Armed Forces.\n\nLAPD 2019 blaster\n\nAs seen in: Blade Runner (1982)\n\nBrandished by a rain-drenched, slightly robotic Harrison Ford throughout Ridley Scott’s future classic, the police-issue blaster became a favourite prop of sci-fi fans everywhere. And yet it was cobbled together from existing 20th century guns – specifically parts of a Steyr-Mannlicher Model SL .222 rifle and a Charter Arms Bulldog .44 police revolver, concealed by plastic side covers and six LED lights (which malfunctioned through filming). Despite the fact the gun is only onscreen for 18 minutes, it became one of the most beloved props ever created for a movie: the film’s original blaster sold for $270,000 in 2009. And 50 high-end limited edition replicas, costing $900 apiece, sold out in minutes after going on sale in 2014.\n\nWalther PPK\n\nAs seen in: The James Bond franchise\n\nLaunched by German manufacturer Carl Walther back in 1931, the Polizeipistole Kriminalmodell (Police Pistol Detective Model) became standard issue for the Luftwaffe during WW2. And, indeed, Hitler himself: it was with his PPK (a 7.65mm/.32 ACP) that the Führer shot himself in his Berlin bunker in 1945. Weird, then, that this stubby, low-capacity pistol would eventually become the trademark of a fictional Mi6 agent. Indeed, Bond author Ian Fleming originally gave Bond a Beretta pistol in early novels, but switched to the PPK in Dr. No (1962) - chiefly because it could be holstered inside a dinner jacket without causing an unsightly bulge. Elvis Presley owned a silver-barreled PPK, inscribed \"TCB\" (\"Taking Care of Business\").\n\nPoint-of-View Gun\n\nAs seen in: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)\n\nCreated by Douglas Adams specially for the movie adaptation, before his death in 2001, the POV gun’s firepower is more existential than explosive: when used on someone, it merely causes them to see things from the point of view of the person firing the gun. According to the Guide it was built by Deep Thought, but actually commissioned by the Intergalactic Consortium of Angry Housewives, a group tired of ending every argument with their husbands with the phrase, “You just don't get it, do you?” Innocuous, you might think – until placed in the hands of the most depressed robot in the universe, Marvin the Paranoid Android. Then? That’s Death Star-level destruction.\n\nM16A1\n\nAs seen in: Platoon (1986), Scarface (1983), Planet Terror (2007)\n\nHollywood’s go-to assault rifle has proved even more adaptable onscreen as in real life. Vietnam films such as Platoon and Apocalypse Now highlighted the M16A1’s lean spec – the US military’s 1963 adaptation of the Colt AR-15 rifle. Attach an M203 Grenade Launcher to the underside, however, and it becomes ”My Little Friend” – to be waved maniacally by a cocaine-powered Al Pacino. (And, later, by any male over the age of 35 when holding a tennis racket.) But strap that same firearm combo to Rose McGowan’s leg stump, as Robert Rodriguez did in Planet Terror? Then you create the ultimate prosthetic for the discerning zombie killer. Although how she actually fires the thing is yet to be properly explained.\n\nBio-Organic Gun\n\nAs seen in: eXistenZ (1999)\n\nUnlikely to feature on the cover of Guns ‘n’ Ammo, this one. Brandished by Ted Pikul (Jude Law) in the film’s second act, the Bio-Organic Gun mostly resembles an overcooked turkey drumstick. However, this is director David Cronenberg’s idea of futuristic weaponry: an organic firearm built entirely out of bones and muscle fibres, that uses human teeth for ammunition. Intriguing indeed, but with limited visual menace - just try robbing a bank with this in your hand. Or, indeed, a branch of KFC.\n\nGE M134 Minigun\n\nAs seen in: Predator (1987), Terminator 2 (1991)\n\nGeneral Electric’s six-barreled, electrically-driven rotary gun was already deemed a mite excessive when first mounted on helicopters during the Vietnam War. Which makes the handheld version seen in 1987’s Predator all the stupider. The prop itself - nicknamed \"Ol' Painless\" - was heavily modified, with an electric motor powered by wires hidden in the actors’ trousers, and the rate of fire decreased from 6,000 RPM to 1,250 RPM, as director John McTiernan wanted to see the barrels visibly turning. But be under no illusions: the arm-breaking recoil and weight made the gun impossible for a human being – even Jesse Ventura - to operate in real life. And then there’s the issue of ammunition: at full speed, the gun’s 550-round magazine held a maximum of, er, five seconds of ammo.\n\nWinchester rifle\n\nAs seen in: Shaun Of The Dead (2005)\n\nEssential to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost’s final stand against the zombie hoards is this Model 1866 \"Yellow Boy\" lever-action rifle, built by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. But director Edgar Wright’s firearm choice was deliberate – referencing the gun’s heritage in cowboy films like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), True Grit (1969) and Unforgiven (1992). And the rifle has a long lineage of its own: the subsequent Model 1873 gained the reputation as \"The Gun that Won the West\". And the final Model 1894 was even more popular. Over 6 million rifles were manufactured before production ceased – over 112 years later - in 2006.\n\nDesert Eagle\n\nAs seen in: The Matrix (1999)\n\nDon’t be fooled: what looks like a Toblerone with a trigger is now the most powerful mass production handgun in the world. Originally built by Israel Military Industries, the current Mark XIX model fires .50 Action Express rounds, large enough to even make Dirty Harry feel not quite so lucky. As such, this gas-operated semi-automatic is now standard issue for the Israel Defense Forces. As well as any movie villain of note: after appearing in roughly 500 motion pictures and TV films, along with several video games, it’s best known for appearing in the wibbly green-numbered hand of Agent Smith in The Matrix.\n\nThe Boomstick\n\nAs seen in: Army of Darkness (1992)\n\nThe cinematic preserve of old timers in Wild West movies, the double-barrelled shotgun only earned the action-hero seal of approval during the Evil Dead movies. Brandished by Ash (Bruce Campbell), the “Boomstick” was actually a 12 gauge Stoeger Coach Gun – not Remington as he declares to the \"primitive screwheads\". But as he did manage to fire and reload the gun several times, and defeat the She-Bitch, despite having a chainsaw for a hand, we’ll let it pass.\n\nGlock 17\n\nAs seen in: Die Hard 2 (1990), The Dark Knight (2008), 21 Jump St (2012)\n\nTypically clutched by expendable henchmen, the Austrian Glock 17 is the squarish, non-descript semi-automatic most memorably wielded by Jack Bauer in 24. Or – when converted to a ridiculous 33 round full-auto machine pistol – by Heath Ledger’s Joker. But this belies the Glock’s embarrassing secret: it’s actually made of plastic. Or rather, a special polymer that was initially feared to make it invisible to airport metal detectors. But no such fears now – hence why it’s currently standard issue to 65% of US law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and SCO19, the specialist firearms unit of London’s Metropolitan Police.\n\nM60\n\nAs seen in: First Blood (1982), Commando (1985), Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993) Tropic Thunder (2008)\n\nApparently designed to be fired in slow motion, ideally while shirtless, the M60 general-purpose machine gun quickly became the signature weapon for musclebound 1980s action stars. And, hence, the obvious choice when that genre was parodied by Charlie Sheen and Ben Stiller decades later. But no wonder: at over a metre long and fed by a 200-round belt of 7.62 mm bullets, it’s supposed to be operated by two soldiers. Or, in Hollywood terms, a Stallone.\n\nUzi\n\nAs seen in: The Terminator (1984)\n\nDesigned for the Israeli Defence Force by Major Uziel Gal in the late 1940s, the Uzi’s small, lightweight design and reliability helped it sell over 10 million by the 1990s - more than any other submachine gun ever made. For Hollywood, however, the appeal was more visual: as the T-800 proved, it could be fired one-handed. Such trigger-happy insouciance ensured that the Uzi – and its handbag-sized brother, the Micro Uzi – would cameo in hundreds of movies, from The Dogs Of War in 1978 all the way to 2014’s The Raid 2. In Invasion USA (1985), Chuck Norris held two - one in each hand.\n\nHeckler & Koch MP5\n\nAs seen in: Hard Boiled (1992) S.W.A.T. (2003), White House Down (2013)\n\nDesigned in 1964 in Germany, the Heckler & Koch Maschinenpistole 5 – and its 100 variants – have since been adopted by 40 nations worldwide, making this lightweight, air-cooled 9mm submachine gun one of the most widely used in the world. It gained prominence after being seen in the hands of SAS commandos during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London, but is now chiefly associated with American SWAT teams. Hence why it features in practically any film, TV show, game or pop-up children’s book featuring police you care to mention. Although perhaps most memorably in Die Hard (1988), when Bruce Willis ingeniously uses the strap of a Heckler & Koch HK94 to shin down a lift shaft.\n\nCodpiece Revolver\n\nAs seen in: Desperado (1995), From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)\n\nNot content with installing a MAC-10 machine pistol into a guitar case for his Hollywood debut Desperado, director Robert Rodriguez had another trick up his sleeve. Or rather, pants: a cheerfully puerile spring-loaded crotch pistol, boasting – of course - two twin revolving cylinders. However, Rodriguez had to wait until his 1996 vampire flick to actually fire the thing – when Sex Machine (Tom Savini) unleashes his weapon against Razor Charlie (Danny Trejo). Nothing subliminal to see here, people."
