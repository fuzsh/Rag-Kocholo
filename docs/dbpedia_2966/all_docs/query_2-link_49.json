        "text": "Chapter 1: An overview – frequently asked questions about firearms licensing\n\nWhat is meant by the term ‘firearm’?\n\n1.1 ‘Firearm’ means a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile with kinetic energy of more than one joule at the muzzle of the weapon, can be discharged.\n\nSee Chapter 2 for further details.\n\nWhat are the basic principles of firearms law in GB?\n\n1.2 GB firearms policy is based on the fact that firearms are dangerous weapons and the State has a duty to protect the public from their misuse. Gun ownership is a privilege, not a right. Firearms control in GB is among the toughest in the world and, as a result, firearms offences continue to make up a small proportion of recorded crime.\n\nWhat kind of firearm can be held on certificate?\n\n1.3 Some firearms and shot guns may be held on a firearm or shot gun certificate issued by the police. Low-powered air weapons are not licensed in England and Wales unless they are of a type declared specially dangerous by the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) Rules 1969, but there are restrictions on their sale. An air weapon is “specially dangerous” if it is capable of discharging a missile with kinetic energy in excess, in the case of an air pistol, of 6 foot-pounds or, in the case of other air weapons,12 foot-pounds. “Specially dangerous” air pistols (and certain other air weapons) are prohibited weapons and may not be held on certificate.\n\nSee Chapters 10 and 11 (on firearm certificate procedure and shot gun certificate procedure) for further details.\n\nCan anyone apply for a firearm certificate?\n\n1.4 Permission to possess, purchase or acquire a firearm will only be granted to an individual who is assessed by the licensing authority, the police, as not posing a threat to public safety and having good reason to own the firearm. Organisations such as target shooting clubs, museums and firearms dealers must also apply for licences if they wish to possess or use firearms. Persons who are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years or more cannot possess a firearm or ammunition (including antique firearms) at any time.\n\nSee Chapters 10 and 11 (on firearm certificate procedure and shot gun certificate procedure) for further details.\n\nWho authorises firearm and shot gun certificates?\n\n1.5 The police are the licensing authority for firearm and shot gun certificates, as well as for firearms dealers. The authority rests with local police forces rather than a central licensing authority because of the local information that police will use to inform their judgement. Applications for authority to possess prohibited weapons, such as handguns, in England and Wales are determined by the Home Office on behalf of the Secretary of State. Applications for such authority in Scotland are determined by the Scottish Government on behalf of Scottish Ministers.\n\nSee Chapters 10, 11 and 15 (on firearm and shot gun certificate procedure and on registration as a firearms dealer) for further details.\n\nWhat is a ‘good reason’ to own a firearm?\n\n1.6 Applicants should be able to demonstrate to the police that they require their firearm on a regular, legitimate basis for work, sport or leisure (including collections or research). Chief officers are able to exercise discretion over what constitutes a good reason, judging each case on its own merits.\n\nSee Chapter 12 for further details.\n\nHow are firearms stored?\n\n1.7 The conditions of a firearm or shot gun certificate stipulate that guns must be stored securely so as to prevent access by an unauthorised person. The manner in which they are stored depends on the individual property and circumstances.\n\nSee Chapter 18 for further details.\n\nWhat happens to firearms in the event of the death of the owner?\n\n1.8 In the event of the death of a certificate holder, the person inheriting the effects must surrender or declare the weapons to the police or a registered firearms dealer. Failure to do so would result in the inheritor being in breach of the law by having the firearms in their possession; it is the responsibility of the inheritor to find out whether firearms are part of the deceased’s effects. Registered firearms dealers will be able to advise on the value of the items and how best to proceed in accordance with the inheritor’s wishes. Options include applying for a certificate, selling/transferring the firearm (for example, to a museum or a certificate holder) or destroying it.\n\nSee Chapters 5, 14 and 24 for further details.\n\nWhat should I do if I have concerns about a firearm owner?\n\n1.9 Any concerns should be reported to your local police force.\n\nWhat is the government doing to prevent 3D printed guns being used?\n\n1.10 If someone were to possess, purchase, manufacture or sell a firearm or its component parts otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of sections 1, 3 and 5 of the Firearms Act 1968, they would be liable to prosecution.\n\nSee Chapter 3 for more details.\n\nWhere can I find information about shooting clubs, museums or firearms dealers?\n\n1.11 Detailed information about firearms dealers can be found in Chapter 15, museums in Chapter 16 and shooting clubs in Chapter 17.\n\nChapter 2: Definition and Classification of Firearms and Ammunition\n\n2.1 This chapter provides definitions of firearms, component parts, shot guns, deactivated firearms and defectively deactivated firearms, imitation and realistic imitation firearms, including readily convertible imitations, some information on antiques (which are covered more fully in Chapter 8), and firearms conversion. It goes on to define various types of firearms and ammunition for which no certificate is required, including certain types of air weapons.\n\n2.2 The definitions of ‘firearm’, ‘lethal barrelled weapon’, ‘shot gun’ and ‘ammunition’ for the purposes of the Firearms Acts are set out in section 57 of the Firearms Act 1968 (“the principal Act”) and are set out below. The definition of ‘firearm’ extends to certain imitation firearms (see paragraphs 2.32 to 2.36).\n\nDefinition of ‘firearm’ and ‘lethal barrelled weapon’\n\n2.3 Section 57 of the principal Act (as amended) defines a ‘firearm’ as (i) a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged with kinetic energy of more than one joule at the muzzle of the weapon (ii) a prohibited weapon (iii) any relevant component part (see below and Chapter 12) of such a lethal barrelled or prohibited weapon, and (iv) any accessory to a lethal barrelled or prohibited weapon designed or adapted to diminish the noise or flash caused by firing the weapon.\n\nDefinition of ‘airsoft’ gun\n\n2.4 An ‘airsoft’ gun as defined in section 57A of the 1968 Act is not regarded as a firearm for the purposes of that Act. Section 57A defines an airsoft gun as a barrelled weapon of any description which is designed to discharge only a small plastic missile (whether or not it is also capable of discharging any other kind of missile) and is not capable of discharging a missile of any kind above the permitted kinetic energy thresholds at the muzzle of the weapon (see below). A ‘small plastic missile’ is defined in section 57A(3) as a missile that:\n\na) is made wholly or partly from plastics;\n\nb) is spherical, and\n\nc) does not exceed 8 millimetres in diameter.\n\nSection 57A(4) sets the maximum permitted kinetic energy levels for airsoft guns at:\n\na) 1.3 joules if the weapon is capable of discharging two or more missiles successively without repeated pressure on the trigger, and\n\nb) 2.5 joules in any other case.\n\nDefinition of ‘relevant component part’\n\n2.5 A ‘relevant component part’ of a lethal barrelled or prohibited weapon is a firearm in its own right and is defined in section 57(1D) of the 1968 Act as:\n\na) a barrel, chamber or cylinder,\n\nb) a frame, body or receiver,\n\nc) a breech block, bolt or other mechanism for containing the pressure of discharge at the rear of a chamber,\n\nbut only where the item is capable of being used as a part of a lethal barrelled weapon or a prohibited weapon.\n\nDefinition of ‘shot gun’\n\n2.6 A “shot gun” is defined in section 1(3)(a) of the 1968 Act and means a smooth-bore gun (not being an air gun) which:\n\na) has a barrel not less than 24 inches in length and does not have any barrel with a bore exceeding 2 inches in diameter. The length of the barrel is measured from the muzzle to the point of ignition (breech face). For a muzzle-loading gun, the point of ignition may be taken as the touch-hole or nipple that is nearest to the breech;\n\nb) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges (see paragraphs 2.12 to 2.14 for further information). It should be noted that under section 1(3A) of the 1968 Act a gun that has been adapted to have such a magazine only meets this criterion if the magazine bears an approved mark and the adaptation has been certified in writing either by one of the two Proof Houses or by such other person as the Secretary of State has designated, as having been carried out in a manner approved by the Secretary of State; and\n\nc) is not a revolver gun (that is, a gun containing a series of chambers, which revolve as part of the firing cycle).\n\n2.7 When considering the classification of smooth-bore guns, special attention must be paid to the length of the barrel and the overall length. With the exception of those chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges, section 5(1)(ac) of the 1968 Act raised to the prohibited category (see Chapter 3) all self-loading and pump-action models which are either short-barrelled (under 24 inches) or short in overall length (under 40 inches). For the purpose of calculating overall length any detachable, retractable or other movable butt-stock should be disregarded. References to ‘shot guns’ in the 1968 Act may be taken generally to mean shot guns which fall within section 2 of that Act, rather than those subject to sections 1 and 5 of the 1968 Act, unless otherwise stated.\n\n2.8 While overall length is not a relevant factor in regard to the classification of traditional single and double-barrelled smooth-bore guns and repeating shot guns with a bolt or lever-action, any such guns with barrels under 24 inches in length are subject to control under section 1(3)(a)(i) of the 1968 Act. Also controlled under section 1(3)(a)(ii) is any repeating shot gun, not otherwise prohibited by virtue of its barrel length or overall length, with a magazine capacity in excess of two cartridges.\n\n2.9 Section 5(1)(ad) of the 1968 Act raised to the prohibited category any smooth-bore revolver gun other than one that is chambered for 9mm rim-fire cartridges or is a muzzle-loading revolver gun. The first exemption is understood to cover ‘ratting’ or ‘garden’ guns. Since section 1(3)(a) of the 1968 Act does not permit any revolver gun to be regarded as a ‘shot gun’, smooth-bore revolver guns which are chambered for 9mm rim-fire or muzzle-loading guns are classed as firearms and subject to control under section 1 of the 1968 Act.\n\n2.10 For the purposes only of sections 3(1) and 45(2) of the 1968 Act, and in the definition of ‘firearms dealer’ in section 57(4), the term ‘shot gun’ also includes any component part of a shot gun and any accessory to a shot gun designed or adapted to diminish the noise or flash caused by firing the gun. For the purposes of all other sections/Acts, the component parts of shot guns are not subject to control under the Firearms Acts. See section 57(4) of the 1968 Act.\n\nDefinition of ‘ammunition’\n\n2.11 ‘Ammunition’ means ammunition for any firearm and includes grenades, bombs and other like missiles, whether capable of use with a firearm or not; and also includes prohibited ammunition. It should be noted that the definition of ammunition does not include ingredients and components of ammunition; it is only assembled ammunition that is controlled under the Act, not component parts. Empty cartridge cases, for example, are not ‘ammunition’. There are two exceptions to this. The first is missiles for ammunition prohibited under section 5 of the 1968 Act, for example, expanding ammunition which can only be used in a pistol, or armour-piercing bullets. Such missiles are themselves defined as ‘ammunition’ and are subject to control accordingly (see Chapter 3). The second is primers - section 35 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 introduced controls on the purchase and sale of a cap type primer designed for use in metallic ammunition (see Chapter 5).\n\nProof House certification of adapted shot guns\n\n2.12 Section 1(3A) of the 1968 Act as amended by section 2(3) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 requires that any smooth-bore gun adapted to have a non-detachable magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges must bear a Proof House mark and have been certified to that effect. This requirement applies not only to those smooth-bore guns already in circulation which have been adapted, but also to those smooth-bore guns which are adapted by the maker subsequent to manufacture but prior to distribution or sale. In both cases such guns are regarded as having been ‘adapted’ within the meaning of section 1(3A) of the 1968 Act, which was inserted by 2(3) of the 1988 Act.\n\n2.13 The marking and certification requirement does not, however, apply in the case of smoothbore guns, which are manufactured with a non-detachable magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges. Such guns are not regarded as having been ‘adapted’ within the meaning of section 2(3) since the capacity of the magazine will be secured during the process of manufacture. Although the guns need not comply with the Secretary of State’s specifications, the magazine must meet the requirement in section 1(3)(a)(ii) of the 1968 Act; that is, the magazine must be incapable of holding more than two cartridges.\n\n2.14 When assessing the magazine capacity of a firearm, consideration should be given to the number of cartridges that the firearm was designed or proofed to take. For example, where a shot gun has a magazine which is capable of holding three cartridges but was designed to hold only two, the shot gun should be considered a section 2 firearm rather than a section 1 firearm. Although interpretation of the law is ultimately a matter for the courts, it is thought unlikely, for example, that the insertion of a plastic or wooden plug into a large capacity fixed magazine would, of itself, be regarded as rendering that gun as having a magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges. The restriction would need to be of an equivalent standard to the methods set out in the Home Office approved specifications in order to meet the requirements of section 1(3)(a)(ii).\n\nDeactivated firearms\n\n2.15 Within the context of section 38 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, a ‘deactivated firearm’ means an imitation that consists of something which was a firearm but has been rendered incapable of discharging a shot, bullet, or other missile. Section 8 of the 1988 Act provides that, unless it can be shown otherwise, a firearm which has been deactivated to a standard approved by the Secretary of State, so that it is incapable of discharging any shot, bullet or other missile, is presumed not to be a firearm within the meaning of the 1968 Act and therefore is not subject to control if it bears a mark approved by the Secretary of State for denoting that fact. The 1988 Act requires that one of the two Proof Houses or some other person approved by the Secretary of State has marked the firearm and certified in writing (that is, provided a certificate) that it has been deactivated to the approved standard. No other person has been approved for this purpose. A deactivated firearm is also to be treated as an imitation firearm, and by virtue of section 24A of the 1968 Act can only be bought by or sold to someone aged 18 or over\n\n2.16 Deactivation specifications were first set by the Home Office in 1989. They were revised in 1995 and again in 2010. These specifications came into force on 1 October 1995 and 17 December 2010, and are not retrospective. Therefore, a gun deactivated to the old specifications prior to revisions, remains deactivated for legal purposes.\n\n2.17 The 1995 (and to some extent 2010) specifications encompassed a substantially greater range of firearms design and are generally more stringent than the preceding (1989) standards.\n\n2.18 Section 8 of the 1988 Act is an evidential provision and does not preclude the possibility that a firearm which has been deactivated in some other manner may also have ceased to be a firearm within the meaning of the 1968 Act. For example, guns held by museums that were recovered from wrecked ships and aircraft may be corroded to the point that they cannot be fired. This should not be confused with wear or missing parts that can be replaced. The final arbiter of whether the article fulfils the definition of a firearm for the purposes of section 57(1) of the 1968 Act is a court.\n\n2.19 See the GOV.UK website for published information on the current UK standards which are designed to ensure that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable. These standards came into force on 28 June 2018 and have been applied by the Proof Houses to firearms submitted to them on or after that date. The standards do not apply to firearms deactivated prior to then unless those firearms are transferred or placed on the market.\n\nDefectively deactivated firearms\n\n2.20 Section 8A of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 requires the Secretary of State to publish technical standards for deactivation. The link in the previous paragraph refers. The Act introduced a new offence of making a defectively deactivated weapon available for sale or as a gift to another person or to sell it or give it (as a gift) to another person. The offence does not apply if the weapon is made available for sale or as a gift to a person who is outside of the UK on the basis that if the sale or gift were to take place, the weapon would be transferred to a place outside of the UK.\n\n2.21 An exception under the 1988 Act applies to museums that hold a museum firearms licence. Such museums can continue to make available for sale or as a gift (as the case may be), defectively deactivated firearms to another museum firearms licence holder without the need for the firearms to be deactivated to newer standards.\n\n2.22 Something is a ‘defectively deactivated weapon’ if:\n\na) it was at any time a firearm\n\nb) it has been rendered incapable of discharging any shot, bullet or other missile (and, accordingly, has either ceased to be a firearm or is a firearm only by virtue of the Firearms Act 1982), but\n\nc) it has not been rendered so incapable in a way that meets the technical specifications for the deactivation of the weapon that apply at the time when the weapon is made available for sale or as a gift or (as the case may be) when it is sold or given as a gift.\n\n2.23 A person guilty of an offence under this section is, on summary conviction, liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months (or, in relation to offences committed before paragraph 24(2) of Schedule 22 to the Sentencing Act 2020 comes into force, 6 months) or to a fine, or to both. On conviction on indictment, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to a fine, or to both.\n\n2.24 See the gov.uk website for further information on deactivation specifications.\n\nNotifying the Home Office of the transfer or possession of a deactivated firearm\n\n2.25 The Firearms Regulations 2019 require the notification to the Home Office, as the relevant national authority, of possession of a deactivated firearm and their transfer – but only when the transfer is for a period of more than 14 days.\n\n2.26 Owners of deactivated firearms need to notify the transfer or possession as follows:\n\nDeactivated firearms being transferred for a period of 14 days or more, regardless of when they were acquired, need to be notified and the firearm must meet current deactivation standards before being transferred.\n\nHome Office Circular 010/2019 explains the changes in more detail.\n\nThere are two forms on GOV.UK to be used for the notification or transfer of deactivated firearms. The required information must then be submitted either by email to: deactivatedfirearmsnotifications@homeoffice.gov.uk or by registered post or recorded delivery to:\n\n2.27 It is an offence under regulation 2(1) of The Firearms Regulations 2019 if a person transfers a deactivated firearm to another person and does not give notice of the transfer to the appropriate national authority in accordance with regulation 2(2). A person guilty of an offence under regulation 2(1) is liable to a fine of up to £200.\n\n2.28 Under Regulation 3(1), a person in possession of a deactivated firearm for a period of more than 14 days commits an offence if they fail to give notice of the deactivated firearm to the appropriate national authority unless the deactivated firearm has been transferred to that person and the transfer has already been notified by the person transferring it. In most instances this will avoid the need for the same deactivated firearm to be declared twice. Where a person in possession of a deactivated firearm commits an offence under regulation 3(1), it is a defence for that person to show that they reasonably believed that the transferor had given, or would give, notice of the transfer in accordance with the arrangements set out within regulation 2. A person guilty of an offence under this regulation is liable to a level 1 fine (£200).\n\nReadily convertible imitation firearms\n\n2.29 Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1982 extended the provisions of section 1 of the 1968 Act to certain imitation firearms. Therefore, a firearm certificate is required to possess, purchase or acquire an imitation firearm which:\n\na) has the appearance of being a firearm to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies; and\n\nb) is so constructed or adapted as to be readily convertible into a firearm to which that section applies.\n\n2.30 Under section 1(6) of the 1982 Act, an imitation firearm is regarded as readily convertible into a firearm to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies if:\n\na) it can be converted without any special skill on the part of the person converting it in the construction or adaptation of firearms of any description; and\n\nb) the work involved in converting it does not require equipment or tools other than such as are in common use by persons carrying out works of construction and maintenance in their own homes.\n\nSection 1(5) of the 1982 Act provides a defence for a person accused of an offence to show that he did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the imitation firearm` was so constructed or adapted as to be readily convertible into a firearm to which section 1 of the Act applies.\n\nGuidelines on the 1982 Act\n\n2.31 Guidelines have been issued which advise on the technical measures that can be taken to prevent an imitation firearm from being readily convertible into a lethal barrelled weapon. These guidelines are intended primarily for the gun trade and are available from representative organisations, such as the Gun Trade Association.\n\nOffences involving imitation firearms\n\n2.32 Section 16A of the 1968 Act makes it an offence to possess any firearm or imitation firearm with intent to cause, or to enable another person to cause, someone else to fear that unlawful violence will be used against them or another person. It provides for a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine, or both.\n\n2.33 Under section 20 of the 1968 Act it is an offence to trespass with an imitation firearm. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 6 months imprisonment (for trespass in a building) or 3 months (for trespass on land). The offence of trespassing with an imitation firearm in a building (in contrast to the offence committed with a firearm as defined by section 57(1) of the 1968 Act) is triable only summarily. Section 46(1)(b) of the 1968 Act (police powers of search with a warrant) applies to the seizure of imitation firearms as well as real firearms. See Part 1 of Schedule 6 to the 1968 for a list of the penalties that apply to the criminal offences in that Act.\n\n2.34 Under section 19 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for a person to carry an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse (see also Chapter 21). The maximum custodial sentence is 12 months for this offence (as it relates to imitation firearms).\n\n2.35 Section 24A of the Firearms Act 1968, as inserted by section 40 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act, makes it an offence for anyone aged under 18 to purchase an imitation firearm and for anyone to sell an imitation firearm to someone aged under 18. There is a defence for anyone charged with the offence of selling an imitation firearm to someone under 18, where they can show that they had reasonable grounds for believing the purchaser to be 18 or over.\n\n2.36 Section 4A of the Firearms Act 1968 makes it an offence for a person, other than a registered firearms dealer, a) to have in his or her possession or under his or her control an article that is capable of being used (whether by itself or with other articles) to convert an imitation firearm into a firearm and, b) the person intends to use the article (whether by itself or with other articles) to convert an imitation firearm into a firearm. A person guilty of an offence under this section is, on summary conviction, liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months (or, in relation to offences committed in England and Wales before paragraph 24(2) of Schedule 22 to the Sentencing Act 2020 comes into force, 6 months) or to a fine, or to both. On conviction on indictment, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to a fine, or to both.\n\nRealistic imitation firearms\n\n2.37 Section 36 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 makes it an offence for a person to manufacture, sell, import or cause a realistic imitation firearm to be brought into Great Britain. The Act also makes it an offence to modify an imitation firearm so that it becomes a realistic imitation firearm. Section 38(1) defines a ‘realistic imitation firearm’ as an imitation firearm which:\n\na) has an appearance that is so realistic as to make it indistinguishable, for all practical purposes, from a real firearm; and\n\nb) is neither a deactivated firearm nor an antique.\n\n2.38 This definition of ‘realistic imitation firearm’ applies for the purposes of sections 36 and 37 of the 2006 Act. The term ‘real firearm’ is defined in section 38(7) as either a firearm of an actual make or model of a modern firearm, or a generic modern firearm. The term ‘modern firearm’ is defined in subsection 8 as a firearm other than one whose appearance would tend to identify it as having a design and mechanism of a sort first dating before 1870.\n\n2.39 Section 37 of the 2006 Act provides for a number of specified defences, which apply for the offence under section 36, where a realistic imitation firearm is made available for one or more of the following purposes:\n\ni) for the purposes of a museum or gallery\n\nii) for the purposes of theatrical performances and of rehearsals for such performances\n\niii) in the production of films (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988)\n\niv) in the production of television programmes (within the meaning of the Communications Act 2003))\n\nv) for the organisation and holding of historical re-enactments organised and held by persons specified or described for the purposes of this section by regulations made by the Secretary of State (see below)\n\nvi) for the purposes of functions that a person has in their capacity as a person in the service of His Majesty.\n\n2.40 Section 37(3) of the 2006 Act provides a further defence for businesses to import realistic imitation firearms for the purpose of modifying them so that they cease to be realistic imitation firearms.\n\n2.41 The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (Realistic Imitation Firearms) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2606) provides two further defences which apply to an offence under section 36 of the 2006 Act. The first is a defence for making a realistic imitation firearm available for ‘permitted activities’, defined as “the acting out of military or law enforcement scenarios for the purposes of recreation” and primarily intended to cover those participating in airsoft skirmishing. It is a requirement under the regulations that third party liability insurance is held in connection with such activities. The second is a defence for display of realistic imitation firearms at a ‘permitted event’, defined as a commercial event at which firearms or realistic imitation firearms (or both) are offered for sale or displayed (i.e. arms fairs).\n\n2.42 The Regulations also specify that those relying on the historical re-enactment defence must have third party liability insurance in connection with the organisation and holding of historical re-enactments. Where a person indicates that they wish to buy a realistic imitation firearm for airsoft skirmishing, retailers should seek to determine that the prospective buyer holds third party liability insurance in connection with the organisation and holding of the recreational acting out of military or law enforcement scenarios. In many cases airsoft players will be members of clubs which are members of the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailers Association (UKARA). UKARA operates a database, which keeps a record of participating airsoft players and game sites, and is used for identification purposes. Equally, where a person intends to buy a realistic imitation firearm for the purposes of historical re-enactment, retailers should check that the prospective buyer is a member of a club or society recognised by the National Association of Re-enactment Societies (NAReS) or an organisation of similar standing prior to making a sale.\n\n2.43 In determining whether an imitation firearm is to be considered a realistic imitation firearm, section 38(3)(a) of the 2006 Act states that its size, shape and principal colour are to be taken into account. Section 38(3)(b) confirms that an imitation is to be regarded as distinguishable if its size, shape or principal colour is unrealistic for a real firearm. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (Realistic Imitation Firearms) Regulations 2007 specify a set of colours and dimensions in order to distinguish between imitation firearms and realistic imitation firearms. An imitation firearm with dimensions less than 38 mm in height and 70mm in length is to be regarded as unrealistic. An imitation firearm which is principally coloured bright red, bright orange, bright yellow, bright green, bright pink, bright purple, bright blue, or which is transparent should also be regarded as unrealistic.\n\n2.44 An imitation firearm whose principal colour is not one of those listed in the Regulations does not automatically fail to be regarded as realistic, although it is more likely that that will be the case. In these circumstances, the general test of whether it is distinguishable from a real firearm, taking into account its size, colour etc. should be applied.\n\nSpecifications for blank firing imitation firearms\n\n2.45 Under section 39 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, it is an offence to manufacture or import an imitation firearm which does not conform to specifications set out in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (Specification for Imitation Firearms) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1754) (“the 2011 Regulations”). It is also an offence to modify an imitation firearm so that it does not conform to the specifications or to modify a firearm to create an imitation firearm which does not confirm to the regulations. Accordingly, all blank firing imitation firearms, i.e. imitation firearms capable of firing a blank cartridge, and blank firing imitation revolvers must conform to the specifications set out in regulations 4 and 6 of the 2011 Regulations respectively. Under regulation 7 of the 2011 Regulations, the offence in section 39(2)(d) of the 2006 Act of importing an imitation firearm which does not conform to the specifications does not apply where the imitation firearm was imported for one of the reasons specified in section 37(2) of the 2006 Act (see paragraph 2.39).\n\nSmall firearms\n\n2.46 Section 5 of the 1968 Act prohibits any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30cm in length or is less than 60cm in length overall, other than an air weapon, a muzzle-loading gun or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus. The intention was to prohibit certain particularly dangerous firearms which were easy to conceal. In general terms, this has meant the prohibition of handguns but it is important to remember that the legislation does not refer explicitly to handguns; instead it refers to small firearms. For exemptions to the requirement to obtain the Secretary of State’s authority to possess prohibited firearms see Chapter 3.\n\nAntiques\n\n2.47 Apart from sections 19, 20 and 21, Schedule 3, and any other provision of the 1968 Act so far as it applies in relation to an offence under the aforementioned sections, the provisions of the 1968 Act do not apply to antique firearms kept as curiosities or ornaments (section 58(2) of the 1968 Act refers) (see chapters 5 and 8). The Antique Firearms Regulations 2021 specify which firearms can be regarded as antique, and further details are set out in Chapter 8.\n\nFirearms and ammunition for which no certificate is required\n\n2.48 Firearm and shot gun certificates are required in respect of the majority of firearms and ammunition. However, the following types are exempt:\n\nAir and gas operated weapons and their ammunition\n\n2.49 Air guns, air rifles and air pistols are exempt from the certification requirement if they are not of a type declared specially dangerous by the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) Rules 1969 (SI 1969/47) (“the 1969 Rules”), as amended by the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) (Amendment) Rules 1993 (SI 1993/1490), or the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) (Scotland) Rules 1969 (SI 1969/270), as amended by the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) (Scotland) Amendment Rules 1993 (SI 1993/1541).\n\n2.50 The 1969 Rules provide that any air weapon is ‘specially dangerous’ if it is capable of discharging a missile so that the missile has, on being discharged from the muzzle of the weapon, kinetic energy in excess, in the case of an air pistol, of 6 foot-pounds or, in the case of an air weapon other than an air pistol, 12 foot-pounds. An air rifle with a muzzle energy in excess of 12 foot-pounds must be held on a firearm certificate. Any short air weapons (which either have a barrel less than 30cm in length or are less than 60cm in length overall), with a muzzle energy in excess of 6 foot-pounds are prohibited firearms.\n\n2.51 If there is doubt about a particular air weapon, police forces should seek advice from forensic science service providers. It should be noted that the firing capabilities have been found to differ between particular weapons of the same model. It should not be automatically assumed that all specimens of a particular model of air gun produce exactly the same muzzle energy, particularly if its published power level approaches the 6 foot-pounds or 12 foot-pounds levels, as appropriate to its type. Testing of air weapons for the purposes of determining their status under the current legislation should only be carried out under strictly controlled circumstances. Forensic science service providers can offer help and advice.\n\n2.52 By virtue of section 48 of the 1997 Act, firearms using compressed carbon dioxide as the power source are treated as air weapons and, if not regarded as ‘specially dangerous’ (over 6 foot-pounds in the case of a pistol or 12 foot-pounds in the case of other air guns and air rifles) are thus exempt from the firearm certificate procedure. Firearms using other gases are not so exempt.\n\n2.53 It should be noted that the majority but by no means all guns powered by carbon dioxide which discharge paint pellets and which are used in adventure games are unlikely to cause serious injury, nor were they designed as ‘weapons’. As such, they should not be considered to be firearms.\n\n2.54 Ammunition for air weapons and other weapons using compressed gas is exempt from the certification procedure.\n\n2.55 The 1969 Rules do not apply to an air weapon designed for use only when submerged in water, such as harpoon guns.\n\nAir weapons in Scotland\n\n2.56 Section B4 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 reserves the subject matter of the Firearms Acts 1968 to 1997. Section 10 of the Scotland Act 2012 amends section B4 to create an exception to that reservation. The amendment gives legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament in relation to the regulation of air weapons within the meaning of section 1(3)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 (air weapons not declared specially dangerous by rules made by the Secretary of State under section 53 of the 1968 Act). Section 2 of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2015 makes it an offence for a person to use, possess, purchase or acquire an air weapon in Scotland without holding an air weapon certificate issued by Police Scotland. For more detailed information about air weapons laws in Scotland please refer to the guidance issued by the Scottish Government: Air weapon licensing in Scotland: guide.\n\nShot gun cartridges\n\n2.57 A shot gun certificate is not required to possess or acquire shot gun cartridges containing five or more shot, none of which exceeds .36 inch in diameter. All ordinary shot cartridges are covered by this description. However, a shot gun certificate (or firearm certificate authorising possession of a section 1 shot gun) is normally required to purchase shot gun cartridges. All single bulleted ammunition, for example solid slug, spherical ball or projectiles for birdscaring equipment, is subject to the requirement for a firearm certificate.\n\nBlank cartridges\n\n2.58 Blank cartridges not exceeding 1 inch in diameter are also exempt from the certification procedure.\n\nDisplay Boards and decorative purposes\n\n2.59 In the absence of a court ruling, inert cartridges and ammunition mounted on display boards are not regarded as being subject to the Acts. Similarly, inert bullets mounted on key rings or cuff links are assumed to be exempt.\n\n2.60 It should be noted that exemption from the certification procedure does not automatically exempt a firearm from all the other provisions of the Act. A person found trespassing with a low-powered air weapon, for example, might still be charged with “armed” trespass. It is also an offence for a person prohibited by the terms of section 21 of the 1968 Act to be in possession of an air gun or ammunition for it.\n\nOther classes of firearms and ammunition\n\n2.61 When considering whether a particular weapon should be regarded as a firearm to which sections 1, 2 or 5 of the 1968 Act applies or which is covered by the 1982 Act, it is important to remember that the purpose of the legislation is to control the supply and possession of all rifles, guns and pistols which could be used for criminal or subversive purposes while recognising that individuals may own and use firearms and other devices for legitimate purposes. In the absence of a decision by a court, the Secretary of State takes the view that the following devices should not be regarded as firearms within the definition of the Act:\n\na) captive-bolt stunning devices (where the bolt remains attached to the barrel) used in the slaughter of animals, operated by blank cartridges or pneumatically;\n\nb) nail guns, designed as tools for the insertion of nails, metal pins and threaded bolts into solid objects;\n\nc) alarm guns, which are devices operated by a trip wire for the detonation of small explosive charges;\n\nd) line throwing implements used for saving life of those in vessels in distress;\n\ne) net throwing guns which are devices designed for the live capture of birds and animals (but not those net throwing guns which are designed for law enforcement purposes);\n\nf) rocket signal and illuminating devices (but not signalling pistols or hand-held devices using cartridges, and which discharge a signal or illuminating load from a fixed barrel);\n\ng) fuse igniting pistols designed to ignite a slow burning pyrotechnic fuse or shock cord by firing a primer or blank cartridge;\n\nh) cable cutters and cable spikers (designed to earth the residual electronic charge held in high voltage cables) fired by blank cartridges;\n\ni) harpoon guns utilising a spigot and fired by blank cartridge, such as the Greener harpoon gun;\n\nj) dummy and target launchers (designed to project a dummy for dog training or an artificial target for shooting), utilising a spigot and powered by blank cartridges;\n\nk) armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) smoke dischargers used to project pyrotechnics for smoke screening; and\n\nl) sleeve type chamber inserts for use in a shot gun or rifle); and,\n\nm) rifled choke tubes for shot guns are considered to be an accessory and not an essential component part of a firearm as specified by section 57 of the 1968 Act.\n\nConversion of firearms\n\n2.62 Section 7(1)(a) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 (as amended by the 1997 Act) provides that if any weapon has at any time been a weapon to which section 5(1) or 5(1A) of the 1968 Act applies, it shall be treated as a prohibited weapon regardless of anything done for the purpose of converting it into a weapon of a different kind. Thus a fully automatic weapon such as a Bren gun which has been smooth-bored and adapted to single-shot would still be classified as a prohibited weapon, as would a pistol that had a 24 inch or more smoothbore barrel fitted to it.\n\n2.63 Section 7(1)(b) provides an exception in respect of self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore guns which have at some time possessed a barrel under 24 inches (and would otherwise be caught under section 5(1)(ac) of the 1968 Act) and which at the present time have a barrel of 24 inches or more. This takes account of the fact that some self-loading and pump-action smooth-bore guns are manufactured so as to readily accommodate, and with equal facility, interchangeable barrels of varying lengths, which may be more or less than 24 inches. The exception therefore protects a person who acquires such a gun in its long-barrelled mode without being aware that in the past it had been fitted with a shorter barrel.\n\n2.64 Section 7(2) of the 1988 Act provides that a weapon which:\n\na) has at any time since the coming into force of section 2 of the 1988 Act (which required a firearm certificate for certain types of shot gun) been a weapon to which section 1 of the 1968 applies; or\n\nb) would at any previous time have been such a weapon had the 1988 Act been in force,\n\nshall, if it has, or at any time has had, a rifled barrel of less than 24 inches be a section 1 firearm, irrespective of any work done to convert it into a shot gun or an air weapon.\n\n2.65 However, section 7(3) of the 1988 Act exempts from the provisions of section 7(2) any firearm where the barrel has been shortened by a registered firearms dealer for the sole purpose of replacing part of it so as to produce a barrel not less than 24 inches in length. This allows firearms dealers to cut off from a rifled barrel which is 24 inches or greater in length a damaged or worn part, drill out the rifling from the remaining part of the barrel and add a smooth-bored section so as to produce a barrel not less than 24 inches in length.\n\n2.66 This exemption refers only to guns that have at some time had barrels less than 24 inches in length solely by virtue of such work having been carried out by a registered firearms dealer. Guns which have at any time had a barrel less than 24 inches in length for some other reason cannot benefit from this exemption even if they are subsequently shortened again by a registered firearms dealer for the purpose stated. This covers the conversion of firearms and does not impinge on the destruction of a firearm by a dealer cutting it into pieces, including the barrels.\n\nChapter 3: Prohibited Weapons and Ammunition\n\n3.1 This chapter defines weapons and ammunition prohibited under the terms of section 5 of the 1968 Act. It explains the arrangements whereby the Secretary of State grants authorities for possessing section 5 weapons and ammunition, and the various exemptions from the requirement to possess this authority. Where this chapter refers to an authority of the Secretary of State, that authority is exercised by the Scottish Ministers in or as regards Scotland\n\nDefinitions\n\n3.2 Sections 5(1) and 5(1A) of the 1968 Act, make it unlawful to purchase, acquire or possess, without the authority of the Secretary of State, any prohibited weapon or ammunition. There are additional offences under section 5(2A) covering the unlawful manufacture, sale or transfer of any prohibited weapon or ammunition, the unlawful possession of prohibited weapons or ammunition for sale or transfer, and the unlawful purchase or acquisition of prohibited weapons or ammunition for sale or transfer.\n\n3.3 Those weapons and ammunition which are prohibited consist of:\n\ni) any firearm which is so designed or adapted that two or more missiles can be successively discharged without repeated pressure on the trigger (section 5(1)(a));\n\nSection 5(1)(a) includes weapons such as machine guns, sub-machine guns, chain guns and the so-called ‘burst-fire’ weapons in which several missiles (typically 3-5) are discharged in succession on a single application of the trigger. Case law also suggests that the courts should consider the actual operation of the firearm rather than the intent of the designers.\n\nii) any self-loading or pump-action rifled gun other than one which is chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges (section 5(1)(ab));\n\nSection 5(1)(ab) includes carbines, which are included in the definition of a rifle in section 57(4) of the 1968 Act. Originally, a carbine was a short musket or rifle intended for use by mounted troops, but the term has come to mean any rifle with a short barrel.\n\nAlso caught in this category are the so-called ‘hybrid’ firearms such as the Colt Armalite AR-15 ‘pistol’. These weapons are self-loading versions of long arms made to operate in self-loading mode only and sold without a shoulder stock. The term ‘automatic’ is also sometimes incorrectly applied to self-loading pistols.\n\niii) any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in length or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, other than an air weapon, a muzzle-loading gun or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus (section 5(1)(aba));\n\nSection 5(1)(aba) affects small firearms that are easily concealed. Muzzle-loading firearms (including cap and ball revolvers) and flare pistols are excluded. It should be remembered that the 1997 Act did not ban pistols as such and was drafted in terms of small firearms. NB: section 5(1)(aba) includes ‘specially dangerous’ air pistols and ‘specially dangerous’ short air rifles.\n\nIn terms of measurement, section 57(6) of the 1968 Act makes provision for the barrel to be measured from the muzzle to the point at which the charge is exploded on firing. In measuring the overall length, any detachable, folding, retractable or other movable butt-stock should be disregarded in accordance with section 5(8) of the 1968 Act.\n\nAny long-barrelled pistols with dimensions greater than those stipulated in section 5(1)(aba) of the 1968 Act (such as the long barrelled Uberti Cattleman revolver) are not caught by this section of the Act and may legally be held on a firearm certificate.\n\nThe Olympic .380 BBM starting pistol was identified as readily convertible in 2010 and now falls within the definition of a prohibited firearm under section 5(1)(aba).\n\niv) any self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore gun which is not an air weapon or chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges and either has a barrel less than 24 inches in length or is less than 40 inches in length overall (section 5(1)(ac));\n\nSection 5(1)(ac) covers short-barrelled or short overall length pump-action and self-loading shot guns, which may have folding or retracting shoulder stocks. Short barrelled smooth bore ‘specially dangerous’ air weapons also fall into this category.\n\nv) any smooth-bore revolver gun other than one which is chambered for 9mm rim-fire cartridges or a muzzle-loading gun (section 5(1)(ad));\n\nSection 5(1)(ad) covers most smooth-bore revolver guns though an exception is made for the so-called ‘ratting guns’ chambered for 9mm rim-fire and for muzzle-loading guns, both of which are subject to control under section 1 of the Act. Section 57(2B) of the 1968 Act (as inserted by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988) defines a smooth-bore revolver gun as one containing a series of chambers, which revolve when the gun is fired. Examples of such guns are the ‘Dragon’ and the ‘Striker’.\n\nvi) any rocket launcher, or any mortar, for projecting a stabilised missile, other than a launcher or mortar designed for line-throwing or pyrotechnic purposes or as signaling apparatus (section 5(1)(ae));\n\nA section 5(1)(ae) rocket launcher is effectively a tube designed to launch a rocket-propelled missile, whereas a mortar uses an explosive charge to launch a bomb. All modern rocket launchers and mortars are caught by this sub-section. Antique or replica mortars (often used by historical re-enactment groups) are used to fire blanks or unstabilised projectiles, and are subject to control under section 1 or 2 of the 1968 Act, depending on the size of the bore and the length of the barrel.\n\nvii) any air rifle, air gun or air pistol that uses, or is designed or adapted for use with, a self-contained gas cartridge system (section 5(1)(af));\n\nSection 5(1)(af) applies to air weapons that are designed, or adapted for use with self-contained gas cartridge (SCGC) systems, for example the Brocock system. This category does not include weapons that use a CO2 bulb system because CO2 bulbs do not contain a projectile and, therefore, are not self-contained.\n\nSection 39(4) of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 makes provision for existing owners (i.e. those who possessed an SCGC weapon on 20 January 2004) to keep and continue to use their weapons, provided they were entered onto a firearm certificate. There is no provision in legislation for such weapons to be sold or transferred to other firearm holders. They may, however, be deactivated.\n\nSCGC weapon owners wishing to surrender their weapons can do so to the police or a Registered Firearm Dealer (RFD) in possession of a Home Office approval for section 5(1)(af) weapons. Those RFDs with the relevant Home Office approval may also repair or deactivate such firearms.\n\nviii) any rifle with a chamber from which empty cartridge cases are extracted using: (i) energy from propellant gas, or (ii) energy imparted to a spring or other energy storage device by propellant gas, other than a rifle which is chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges (section 5(1)(ag));\n\nSection 5(1)(ag) applies to rifles such as the VZ 58 Manually Actuated Release System (MARS) rifle and the Southern Gun Company SGC lever release rifle. These rifles are considered more dangerous than other firearms because they can discharge rounds at a much faster rate than conventional bolt-action rifles which may be held on a firearm certificate.\n\nix) any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing (section 5(1)(b));\n\nThe courts have held that stun guns are prohibited weapons under the terms of section 5(1)(b) of the 1968 Act (Flack v Baldry (1988) 1 All.ER 673). Anyone wishing to possess, purchase, acquire, manufacture, sell or transfer these and similar weapons, which give off an electrical discharge, must apply for the Secretary of State’s authority.\n\nCattle prods are not considered to be within this category because they are not designed or adapted as weapons. This section not only includes flamethrowers and poison gas projectors, but also personal protection sprays using CS, Mace or OC pepper.\n\nAdditionally, it covers dart guns and blowpipes for shooting drugged or poisoned darts (but see section 8 of the 1997 Act which provides an exemption from the need for authority to possess such weapons provided they are held on a firearm certificate conditioned to allow their use for the tranquilising or otherwise treating of any animal).\n\nx) any device (commonly known as a bump stock) which is designed or adapted so that: (i) it is capable of forming part of or being added to a self-loading lethal barrelled weapon (as defined in section 57(1B) and (2A)), and (ii) if it forms part of or is added to such a weapon, it increases the rate of fire of the weapon by using the recoil from the weapon to generate repeated pressure on the trigger (section 5(1)(ba));\n\nSection 5(1)(ba) covers bump stocks, which significantly increase the rate of fire of self-loading rifles.\n\nxi) any cartridge with a bullet designed to explode on or immediately before impact, any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any such noxious thing as is mentioned in (ix) above and, if capable of being used with a firearm of any description, any grenade, bomb or other like missile, or rocket or shell designed to explode as aforesaid (section 5(1)(c));\n\nSection 5(1)(c) includes cartridges containing explosive bullets and ammunition containing noxious substances such as CS. Explosive bullets are those containing an explosive charge, the purpose of which is to cause the bullet to explode on or immediately before impact with the target. Tracer bullets, which contain a chemical flaring compound designed so that the flight of the bullet can be seen, are not prohibited. Smoke canisters are not covered by this provision.\n\nxii) any firearm which is disguised as another object (section 5(1A)(a));\n\nSection 5(1A)(a) was introduced primarily to control walking stick shot guns, but covers any firearm disguised as something else, for example, a pen pistol. A disguised firearm can also be a small firearm for the purposes of section 5(1)(aba). A firearm with camouflage applied for legitimate use, for example, by gamekeepers or wildfowlers, is not considered to be a disguised firearm for the purposes of the Act.\n\nxiii) any rocket or ammunition not falling within (xi) above which consists of, or incorporates, a missile designed to explode on or immediately before impact and is for military use (section 5(1A)(b));\n\nSection 5(1A)(b) covers such things as air-to-air, air-to-ground or ground-to-air missiles that are fired from launch rails rather than through a tube. It also includes rocket grenades and torpedoes. It does not cover free-fall bombs, which are not considered to be ammunition.\n\nxiv) any launcher or other projecting apparatus not falling within (vi) above which is designed to be used with any rocket or ammunition falling within (xiii) above or with ammunition which would fall within that paragraph but for it being ammunition falling within (xi) above (section 5(1A)(c));\n\nSection 5(1A)(c) refers to such things as launch tubes fitted to fixed- or rotary- wing aircraft for category (xiii) missiles. Launch rails, which provide solely for carriage and release, are not considered to be launchers unless they also provide the initial guidance for the missile.\n\nxv) any ammunition for military use which consists of, or incorporates, a missile designed so that a substance contained in the missile will ignite on or immediately before impact (section 5(1A)(d));\n\nSection 5(1A)(d) refers to ammunition designed to have an incendiary effect at the target. This includes missiles containing napalm and similar substances. It does not include tracer rounds.\n\nxvi) any ammunition for military use which consists of or incorporates a missile designed, on account of its having a jacket and hard-core, to penetrate armour plating, armour screening or body armour (section 5(1A)(e));\n\nSection 5(1A)(e) is typified by tungsten-cored rounds designed to penetrate armour using kinetic energy alone. It extends to depleted uranium rounds and armour piercing discarding sabot ammunition.\n\nxvii) any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact (section 5(1A)(f));\n\nSection 5(1A)(f) refers to ammunition incorporating a projectile that is designed or adapted to expand in a controlled manner. Semi-jacketed soft point and hollow point are typical forms of expanding ammunition, but care must be taken to distinguish between expanding ammunition which is solely designed for use in pistols and expanding ammunition for use in rifles - only expanding ammunition for pistols is prohibited, whereas expanding ammunition for rifles is subject to section 1 controls and may be held on a firearms certificate. All bullets will distort on impact, but only those which were designed or adapted to do so in a predictable manner fit this category.\n\nxviii) anything which is designed to be projected as a missile from any weapon and is designed to be, or has been incorporated in, any ammunition falling within any of the preceding paragraphs (see xv, xvi and xvii above); or any ammunition which would fall within any of those paragraphs but for it being specified at (xi) above (section 5(1A)(g));\n\nSection 5(1A)(g) extends the prohibition on the various types of prohibited ammunition to the actual bullet or missile itself, not just the complete round of ammunition (a complete round consists of the bullet, the cartridge case, the propellant and the primer).\n\nComponent parts\n\n3.4 Note that the component parts of weapons falling under 5(1)(a), 5(1A)(a) or 5(1)(aba) are also subject to section 5 controls (see also Chapter 12).\n\n3.5 Section 57(1D) of the 1968 Act defines the relevant component parts of weapons as: a barrel, chamber or cylinder; a frame, body or receiver; a breech block, bolt or other mechanism for containing the pressure of discharge at the rear of a chamber; but only where the item is capable of being used as a part of a lethal barrelled weapon or a prohibited weapon.\n\nAdding to the list of prohibited weapons\n\n3.6 Section 1(4) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 enables the Secretary of State, subject to the approval of Parliament, to make an Order adding to the list of prohibited weapons and ammunition. This power applies only in respect of:\n\na) any firearm (not being an air weapon) which is not for the time being specified in subsection (1) of section 5 of the 1968 Act, was not lawfully on sale in Great Britain in substantial numbers at any time before 1988 and appears to the Secretary of State to be:\n\ni) specially dangerous (see Chapter 2); or\n\nii) wholly or partly composed of material making it not readily detectable by apparatus used for detecting metal objects;\n\nb) any ammunition which is not for the time being specified in that subsection but appears to the Secretary of State to be specially dangerous; or\n\nc) any air rifle, air gun or air pistol which is not for the time being specified in that subsection but appears to the Secretary of State to be specially dangerous.\n\n3D Printed firearms\n\n3.7 The manufacture, purchase, sale and possession of 3D printed firearms, ammunition or their component parts is fully captured by the provisions in section 57(1) of the Firearms Act 1968. The definition of firearm in the Act includes any component parts. 3D printed firearms are subject to strict control in the following respects:\n\na. under section 1 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for an individual to possess, purchase or acquire any component part of a firearm without a certificate;\n\nb. under section 3 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for a person who is not a registered firearms dealer or their servant to manufacture or possess for sale, by way of trade or business, a component part of a firearm; and\n\nc. under section 5 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for a person to possess, purchase, acquire, manufacture, sell, transfer, possess for sale or transfer, or purchase or acquire for sale or transfer, a component part of a prohibited weapon without the authority of the Secretary of State or of the Scottish Ministers in Scotland.\n\nAuthorities under section 5 of the 1968 Act\n\n3.8 This section sets out the arrangements under which the Secretary of State considers applications for authority to possess etc prohibited weapons and ammunition under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968.\n\nIn England and Wales, applications for authority to possess, purchase, acquire, manufacture, sell, transfer, possess for sale or transfer, or purchase or acquire for sale or transfer prohibited weapons or ammunition are determined by the Home Office.\n\nIn Scotland, the Scottish Ministers are the responsible body. Applications are determined by the Scottish Government:\n\nSee the gov.scot website for the Scottish Government section 5 application form.\n\nemail: firearms.enquiries@gov.scot\n\nTelephone: 0131 244 8525\n\nApplication for a section 5 authority in England and Wales\n\n3.9 In England and Wales, applications must be made to the Home Office electronically using the designated application portal. For detailed advice on how to apply, please consult the Home Office Guidance for the application for a section 5 authority for prohibited weapons and ammunition.\n\n3.10 References in the remainder of the guide to the Home Office should also be taken to mean the Scottish Government unless otherwise stated. Exemptions from the requirement to obtain the Secretary of State’s authority to possess prohibited items are set out in paragraphs 3.18 to 3.23.\n\n3.11 Before a decision is made concerning a particular application for an authority, the chief officer of police in the area from which the application has been received will be asked if they have any objections to the grant of the authority. If an authority is granted, it will be sent to the applicant and copied to the chief officer. As a matter of policy, the Secretary of State will normally only grant authorities for those with a legitimate commercial need to possess prohibited weapons, rather than for private use or speculative business interest. The chief officer will be informed of any case in which an authority is refused or revoked.\n\n3.12 The Secretary of State is responsible for granting authority, but will rely on information from, and the opinion of, the chief officer of police when reaching a decision. Prohibited weapons are subject to a more stringent control than other firearms and authority to possess or deal in such weapons is granted only if good reason is shown. The authority may restrict the holder to a particular category of prohibited weapon or prohibited ammunition and specify the range of transactions, which may be undertaken. Chief officers should report any circumstances that might justify revoking an authority to the Home Office or the Scottish Government.\n\n3.13 When an application for renewal of an authority is received, the Home Office or the Scottish Government will again seek the views of the police. It is essential, therefore, that applications for renewal are made well in advance of the expiry date.\n\n3.14 Prohibited weapons and ammunition are included in the definitions of ‘firearm’ and ‘ammunition’ in section 57 of the 1968 Act and are therefore subject to the restrictions applicable to other types of firearm and ammunition. No firearm certificate should be granted in respect of any weapon or ammunition to which section 5 of the 1968 Act applies unless authority for its possession has been given by the Secretary of State or they are exempt. If any person applies for a certificate for a prohibited weapon or ammunition already in their possession where they are neither exempt nor able to produce the original, valid authority from the Secretary of State, the application should be refused and the individual required to surrender the weapon or ammunition immediately.\n\n3.15 Where a person has been authorised by the Secretary of State to have possession of a prohibited weapon or prohibited ammunition, the chief officer of police has no discretion to refuse or to revoke the necessary firearm certificate in respect of the prohibited weapon or ammunition (section 31(1) of the 1968 Act). In the case of dealers authorised to manufacture, sell or transfer prohibited weapons, there is no discretion to refuse to enter their names in, or to remove them from, the register of dealers (sections 34(3) and 38(2) of the 1968 Act). When an authority is revoked, any firearm certificate relating to the weapon or ammunition in question must be revoked or varied accordingly (section 31(2) of the 1968 Act). The Secretary of State will consider revoking, or varying the conditions of, any authority if the chief officer thinks it necessary. If such a case should arise, a full report should be made to the Home Office or the Scottish Government (as applicable) as soon as possible.\n\n3.16 Under section 12(2) of the 1968 Act (as amended) (a parallel provision to Section 12(1) of the 1968 Act), an authority to possess prohibited weapons issued to a theatrical or cinematograph film producer may authorise the possession of the weapons by such other persons as the producer may select to have possession thereof whilst taking part in the performance, rehearsal or production.\n\n3.17 Section 5(4) of the 1968 Act provides that an authority shall contain conditions for the purpose of ensuring that the prohibited weapon or prohibited ammunition will not endanger the public safety or the peace. Conditions are stipulated by the Home Office or the Scottish Ministers (and these will vary in individual cases) although the opinion of the chief officer is also sought. Section 5(5) of the 1968 Act makes it an offence to fail to comply with any conditions subject to which an authority is granted. Under section 5(6) of the 1968 Act it is an offence, upon revocation, to fail to deliver up an authority to such person as may be specified in the notice within 21 days of the date of the notice of revocation.\n\nExemptions from the requirement to hold the Secretary of State’s authority to possess prohibited items\n\n3.18 Under the terms of section 54 of the 1968 Act (as amended) persons in the service of His Majesty acting in their capacity as such are exempt from the provisions of section 5 of the Act. For the purposes of the Act, persons deemed to be in the service of His Majesty include members of a police force, civilian officers, members of any foreign force when serving with British forces, members of any approved cadet corps when engaged as members of the corps in drill, or in target practice on service premises, and persons providing instruction to members of a cadet corps.\n\n3.19 Since the 1968 Act created section 5, it has been significantly amended by section 1 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, regulation 3 of the Firearms Acts (Amendment) Regulations 1992 and sections 1, 9 and 52 of the 1997 Act, Schedule 3 of the 1997 Act, section 39 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and, the Offensive Weapons Act 2019. In addition, sections 2 to 7 of the 1997 Act provide for certain special exemptions from the prohibition of small firearms. It is therefore critical that all revisions are taken account of when dealing with section 5 issues.\n\n3.20 Section 5A(1) of the 1968 Act refers to collectors and states that the authority of the Secretary of State is not required for a collector to possess, purchase, acquire, sell or transfer any of the firearms or ammunition listed in section 5(1A) provided they have a suitably conditioned, valid firearm certificate or permit. The weapons and ammunition listed under section 5(1A) are those in categories (xii) to (xviii) above.\n\n3.21 Section 5A(4) of the 1968 Act states that the Secretary of State’s authority is not required for shooters to possess, purchase or acquire, or sell or transfer expanding ammunition or expanding bullets prohibited by sections 5(1A)(f) and (g) providing they have a firearm certificate or visitors’ permit authorising their use in connection with four specific activities. These activities are:\n\ni. the lawful shooting of deer;\n\nii. shooting of vermin or, in the course of estate management, other wildlife (for more information see Chapter 12);\n\niii. the humane killing of animals; and\n\niv. the shooting of animals to protect other animals or people.\n\nThis exemption applies to expanding ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol (see Chapter 4 for further information on expanding ammunition).\n\n3.22 There is no need for the expanding pistol bullets to be listed separately on the certificate. However, where a certificate holder requests large quantities of bullets, it should be remembered that the total number of expanding bullets authorised counts towards their overall limit on possession of expanding pistol ammunition. The exception to the rule on listing bullets separately on a firearm certificate applies in the case of a certificate holder who wishes to possess a variety of different types of bullets. This may be reflected in a relatively higher overall limit on possession and, in these circumstances, the bullets should be listed separately to help avoid unnecessary stockpiling of complete rounds. The dealer making the sale must record transactions of expanding pistol ammunition and bullets for such ammunition on the buyer’s certificate and the sale must also be recorded in the dealer’s register. Provisions for registered firearms dealers are outlined in Chapter 4.\n\n3.23 Section 5A(5) of the 1968 Act allows licensed slaughtermen to have, without the authority of the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers, expanding pistol ammunition for use in a slaughtering instrument, defined at section 57(4) of the 1968 Act as being a firearm specially designed or adapted for the instantaneous slaughter of animals or for the instantaneous stunning of animals with a view to slaughtering them. Section 10 of the 1968 Act allows licensed slaughtermen, without the need for a firearm certificate, to have a slaughtering instrument and ammunition for it in any slaughterhouse or knacker’s yard in which they are employed. In addition, section 2 of the 1997 Act allows other people to possess a slaughtering instrument if they have a firearm certificate allowing possession of the weapon. This provision is meant to apply to those people such as vets, hunt servants and other suitably qualified individuals who could reasonably be expected in the course of their normal work to have to destroy sick or injured animals.\n\nChapter 4: Expanding Ammunition\n\n4.1 This chapter sets out the definition of expanding ammunition and the controls and prohibitions on its possession, purchase, acquisition, sale and transfer.\n\nDefinitions\n\n4.2 Section 5(1A)(f) of the Firearms Act 1968 prohibits “any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact”. Section 5(1A)(g) prohibits the bullets for such ammunition (missiles, in the words of the Act). The words ‘designed or adapted’ are important. Any bullet will deform on impact with a sufficiently hard surface, but only bullets, and ammunition containing bullets, which were designed or have been adapted to do so in a controlled manner are actually controlled by the legislation (see Chapter 3). If in doubt as to the design intention of a bullet, reference to the maker’s design specification should be made. Frangible bullets, do not fall under section 5(1A)(f) of the 1968 Act.\n\n4.3 The prohibition in section 5(1A)(f) previously also applied to expanding ammunition for rifles. However, this was changed by section 129 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017. As a result, expanding ammunition which can be used in a rifle is no longer prohibited and may be possessed on a firearm certificate. The prohibition on expanding ammunition which can only be used in a pistol remains.\n\nExemptions\n\n4.4 Section 5A(4) of the 1968 Act provides an exemption from the prohibition of expanding ammunition for pistols which is to be used in connection with any one or more of the following purposes:\n\ni. lawful shooting of deer;\n\nii. shooting of vermin or, in the course of estate management, other wildlife (for more information see Chapter 12);\n\niii. humane killing of animals; and\n\niv. shooting animals for the protection of other animals or humans.\n\n4.5 Persons who wish to acquire expanding ammunition for any of these purposes must first satisfy the chief officer of police that they have a ‘good reason’ to possess a pistol for any of the above. Once this ‘good reason’ requirement has been satisfied, the shooter’s firearm certificate or visitor’s permit must be conditioned to include expanding ammunition and, for home loaders, the bullets for such ammunition. The condition should restrict the use of the bullets or ammunition to the precise purpose for which it is intended (see also Chapter 3). These exemptions apply only to use in England, Wales and Scotland, as Northern Ireland has its own legislation.\n\n4.6 Section 5A(7) of the 1968 Act exempts dealers and their servants from the need for the authority of the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers to possess, purchase, acquire, sell or transfer any expanding ammunition for pistols, or the missile for any such ammunition, in the ordinary course of the business. Dealers may not possess any expanding ammunition for pistols for their private use unless they have a suitably conditioned firearm certificate.\n\nChapter 5: Restrictions on the Possession, Handling and Distribution of Firearms and Ammunition\n\n5.1 This chapter sets out some of the general requirements and prohibitions of the law on possession, purchase and acquisition of firearms and ammunition. It should be noted that additional information on many of these areas can be found in other parts of the guide.\n\nDefinitions\n\n5.2 Under sections 1 and 2 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for a person “to have in their possession or to purchase or acquire” a firearm or ammunition to which section 1 applies or a shot gun (but not shot gun cartridges) without holding the appropriate certificate. The case law suggests that possession is an absolute offence. It is not a valid defence that the defendant does not know that a bag in their possession contains a firearm (R v Steele 1993) or that a supposedly antique firearm is subject to certification (R v Howells 1997). Possession may be constructive (that is, having free access to the firearms rather than physically possessing them) (Sullivan v Earl of Caithness 1976).\n\n5.3 In some (very restricted) circumstances certain categories of people may be authorised by the Act to “have in their possession” firearms and/or ammunition without a certificate, but not to purchase or acquire. Such people might include licensed slaughterers, a person taking part in theatrical, television or film productions, warehouse operatives or carriers (see Chapter 6) and those authorised under section 7 of the Firearms Act 1968. See also Chapter 6 and Chapter 24, about firearms that may have been found amongst the property of somebody who has died. Chapter 6 also includes details of other exemptions from the need to have a certificate, including the use of borrowed rifles on private premises, as does Chapter 17 on clubs. See also chapters 14 and 26.\n\n5.4 The word “sell” is often used throughout the Act in conjunction with the word “transfer”. Transfer is defined in section 57(4) of the 1968 Act as including letting on hire, giving, lending and parting with possession.\n\nGeneral prohibitions\n\n5.5 Persons prohibited under section 21 of the 1968 Act may not possess any firearms or ammunition, not just those for which a certificate is required. Thus the prohibition extends to all air weapons, air gun pellets and shot gun ammunition. It should also be noted that:\n\n(a) The prohibition applies to persons sentenced in all parts of the United Kingdom, including those sentenced in Northern Ireland. Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 amended section 21 of the 1968 Act. In its unamended form, section 21 applied the prohibition only to those sentenced in England, Wales and Scotland; the amendment in section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 made the similar prohibition on possessing firearms and ammunition in Northern Ireland (previously section 19 of the Firearms Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, now Article 63 of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004) effective in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\n(b) The prohibition includes detention in a young offenders institution, or in youth custody. Paragraph 24 of Schedule 14 to the Criminal Justice Act 1982 added the words “or to youth custody for such a term” to subsections (1) (after “three years or more”) and (2) (after “less than three years”) of section 21 of the 1968 Act. Paragraph 6 of Schedule 8 to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 amended section 21(1) and (2) of the 1968 Act by inserting “or detention in a young offenders institution” after “youth custody”.\n\n5.6 Convictions overseas and periods of detention under the Mental Health Act or the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 do not count towards prohibition, although they might be relevant to fitness and public safety.\n\n5.7 A court in England and Wales that imposes a suspended sentence may order the forfeiture of a firearm or cancel a firearm or shot gun certificate. Even if a court does not make such an order, chief officers of police have the power to revoke a firearm or shot gun certificate in certain circumstances. The fact that an order has been made under section 52 of the 1968 Act in respect of the applicant (notwithstanding that only a suspended sentence was passed) might also be regarded by chief officers as giving them reason to believe that the applicant is unfit to be entrusted or to possess a firearm or shot gun without danger to the public safety or to the peace.\n\n5.8 Since 14 July 2014 suspended sentences have attracted the prohibition imposed by section 21 of the 1968 Act. Section 110 of the Anti-social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 extended the definition of a prohibited person to include persons with suspended sentences of three months or more.\n\nThe period of prohibition of five years begins on the second day after the date on which sentence has been passed so that a person who is in possession of a firearm or ammunition is not in immediate breach of the law when the sentence is passed. This timescale therefore provides an opportunity for a person to make arrangements to transfer or dispose of their firearm or ammunition.\n\n5.9 Since 14 July 2014 persons prohibited from possessing firearms under section 21 (including those with suspended sentences) are also unable to possess antique firearms (see Chapter 8).\n\n5.10 A person who has served a custodial sentence is informed of the provisions of section 21 of the 1968 Act on release. Section 21(6) of the 1968 Act enables a person who is prohibited by the provisions of the section to apply to the Crown Court (or the Sheriff in Scotland) in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 3 to the 1968 Act for the removal of the prohibition. This is usually done where the offence has not involved violence or firearms. Nevertheless, the removal of the prohibition can be opposed by the police and courts have ruled that possession of a firearm certificate presupposed an element of trust (Gordon v Northampton Crown Court 1999).\n\n5.11 Under section 25 of the 1968 Act it is an offence for a person to sell or transfer a firearm or ammunition to, or to repair, prove or test any firearm or ammunition for another person whom they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, to be drunk or of unsound mind.\n\n5.12 Restrictions on the possession, purchase and acquisition of firearms and ammunition by young people and on the sale and transfer to them are dealt with separately in Chapter 7.\n\nFirearms and ammunition for which a certificate is required\n\n5.13 Any person wishing to possess, purchase or acquire any firearm or ammunition must hold a valid firearm or shot gun certificate (as appropriate) unless exempt under sections 7 to 13, 15, 54 or 58(1) of the 1968 Act or sections 15 to 19 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, except:\n\na) an air weapon or a weapon powered by compressed carbon dioxide (not of a type declared by the Secretary of State under the Dangerous Air Weapons Rules 1969 (as amended) to be specially dangerous);\n\nb) ammunition for air weapons;\n\nc) cartridges containing five or more shot, none of which exceeds .36 inches in diameter (the exemption does not extend to the purchase of such ammunition);\n\nd) blank cartridges not more than one inch in diameter.\n\n5.14 Section 5 of the 1988 Act prohibits the sale of ammunition for a shot gun or smoothbore gun, and for which a firearm certificate is not required, to a person who is neither a registered firearms dealer nor a person who sells such ammunition by way of trade or business unless that person:\n\na) produces a shot gun certificate or a firearm certificate (the original, not a photocopy) authorising them to possess a smooth-bore gun;\n\nb) shows that they are entitled to possess a shot gun or smooth-bore gun without holding a certificate; or\n\nc) produces a certificate (the original, not a photocopy) of some other person together with a written authority from the holder of the certificate to purchase the ammunition on their behalf.\n\nThis section only applies to ammunition not subject to control under section 1 of the 1968 Act. There is no requirement for a vendor of shot gun cartridges to be registered as a firearms dealer.\n\n5.15 Unless exempt, a special authority from the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers is needed in addition to a firearm certificate for the possession of a prohibited weapon or prohibited ammunition (see Chapter 3).\n\nPrimers\n\n5.16 The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 introduced controls on the purchase and sale of cap-type primers designed for use in metallic ammunition for a firearm, including empty cartridge cases incorporating such a primer. Section 35 of the 2006 Act makes it an offence to sell these items unless the purchaser:\n\na) is a registered dealer;\n\nb) sells by way of any trade or business either primers or empty cartridge cases incorporating primers;\n\nc) produces a certificate (the original, not a photocopy) authorising them to possess a firearm of a relevant kind (i.e. a firearm other than a shot gun, an air weapon or a firearm chambered for rim-fire ammunition) or ammunition for such a firearm;\n\nd) is a duly authorised Crown servant;\n\ne) shows that they are entitled in law to possess a firearm or ammunition of a relevant kind without a certificate;\n\nf) produces a certificate (the original, not a photocopy) authorising another person to possess such a firearm, or such ammunition, together with that other person’s authority to purchase primers on their behalf; or\n\ng) shows that they are authorised by regulations to purchase primers. To date no such regulations have been made.\n\nSection 35 also makes it an offence to buy, or attempt to buy, primers unless the purchaser meets the same criteria.\n\nThe definitions used in section 35 mean that the offences do not apply to the purchase or sale of blank ammunition, shot gun primers or to percussion caps for muzzle-loading firearms.\n\nBusiness and other transactions\n\n5.17 A person commits an offence, if by way of trade or business that person is engaged in the manufacture, sale or transfer of shot guns or firearms or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies and is not registered as a firearms dealer. This requirement extends to persons who repair, test or prove such firearms or ammunition. A person also commits an offence if they expose for sale or transfer or have in their possession for sale, transfer, repair, test, or proof any such firearm or ammunition, or a shot gun.\n\nIn relation to air weapons; a person commits an offence if, by way of trade or business, they sell or transfer, expose for sale or transfer; or possess for sale or transfer air weapons without being registered as a firearms dealer (see Chapter 15).\n\n5.18 Persons who dispose of firearms or ammunition otherwise than by way of trade and business need not register, but all persons, including dealers, must observe the provisions of the Act regarding:\n\na) persons to whom firearms and ammunition may be sold or transferred (section 3(2) of the 1968 Act and section 5(2) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988) namely;\n\n1) a person producing a firearm certificate authorising them to acquire that firearm or section 1 ammunition;\n\n2) a registered firearms dealer;\n\n3) in the case of a shot gun, a person with a current shot gun certificate or a firearm certificate holder who possesses a section 1 shot gun;\n\n4) in the case of section 2 (shot gun) ammunition, someone who produces another person’s valid shot gun certificate, together with written authority from the certificate holder to allow them to purchase or acquire the ammunition;\n\n5) someone who shows that by virtue of the Act they are entitled to purchase or acquire the firearm or ammunition without a certificate.\n\nb) instructions in firearm and shot gun certificates and notification to the chief officer of police of the sale etc. of a firearm or shot gun to a person who is neither a firearms dealer nor otherwise exempt from holding a certificate (section 32(2)(b), 33(2) and (3) of the 1997 Act).\n\nThough not a statutory requirement, it is desirable that police forces should also comply with these requirements if they transfer a firearm or shot gun to a certificate holder from another force area, completing Table 1 on a firearm certificate and/or Table 2 on a shot gun certificate.\n\n5.19 Section 33 of the 1997 Act requires that, within seven days of the transaction, the transferor and transferee must send, electronically (for example, by email or fax) or by recorded or special delivery, notification to the chief officers of police who issued their own certificates. The transferor is the person who originally possessed the gun, and the transferee is the recipient (and it is the transferor who must write the details of the gun and its transfer onto the certificate of the transferee). The notice of the transaction must contain a description of the firearm or shot gun (including any identification number), state the nature of the transaction and give the name and address of the other person concerned. A firearm or shot gun placed with a registered firearms dealer or auctioneer for sale or return is not regarded as a transfer. Notification is only required once the transfer is complete when all three parties notify the police. As the transferor may not know the name of the ultimate transferee, it is sufficient for the transferor only to notify the police of disposal to the dealer or auctioneer.\n\n5.20 Section 34 of the 1997 Act requires that, on the deactivation, destruction or loss of any firearm to which a firearm or shot gun certificate or a visitor’s firearm or shot gun permit relates, the chief officer of police who granted the certificate or permit must be notified within seven days of the event. The notification must be sent electronically (for example, by email or fax) or by recorded or special delivery and must describe the firearm in question (including any identification number) and the nature of the event. Similarly, if any ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies and a firearm certificate or visitor’s permit relates is lost (whether by theft or otherwise), the chief officer who granted the certificate or permit must be notified within seven days by recorded or special delivery. The actual methods of destruction of firearms are not covered by legislation but to provide adequate safeguards it is generally more appropriate for certificate holders to surrender it either to a registered firearms dealer or to the police rather than to destroy it themselves (see Chapter 24 for further information).\n\n5.21 Section 35 of the 1997 Act requires that if a firearm or shot gun is sold or otherwise disposed of outside Great Britain by a person whose acquisition or purchase of the firearm or shot gun was authorised by a firearm certificate or shot gun certificate, the person holding the certificate must notify the chief officer of police within fourteen days by electronic notification (for example, by email or fax) or recorded or special delivery, or, if they are abroad, by the nearest available equivalent. The notification must contain a description of the firearm or shot gun (including any identification number) and the name and address of the person to whom the gun was sold or disposed of.\n\n5.22 Section 35 of the 1997 Act requires that if a firearm to which a firearm or shot gun certificate relates is deactivated, destroyed or lost (whether by theft or otherwise) or if any ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies is lost outside Great Britain, the chief officer of police who issued the certificate must be notified within fourteen days. The notice must contain the same information as the notice of sale or disposal and be sent electronically (for example, by email or fax) or by recorded or special delivery.\n\n5.23 A firearms dealer is also required to send a notification of a transaction involving a visitor under section 18(1) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 to the chief officer of police for the area in which they are registered. The notice must be sent within forty-eight hours of the transaction, electronically (for example, by email or fax) or by recorded or special delivery, and contain all the particulars entered in the register of transactions including the details of the purchaser’s passport, if any.\n\n5.24 Section 8(2)(a) of the 1968 Act also provides specifically that it is not an offence to part with possession, otherwise than by sale, hire, gift or loan, to a person who is entitled to possess the firearm or ammunition without a certificate.\n\n5.25 Further exemptions from the need to produce a certificate are made for persons collecting a shot gun from a dealer who has had it for repair, test or proof (section 8(2)(b) of the 1968 Act). It would be good practice for the dealer and persons to whom carriers or warehousemen or their servants are delivering a firearm or ammunition in the ordinary course of business to ask to see a certificate (section 9(4) of the 1968 Act) or proof that the person collecting the shot gun is entitled to possess it without a certificate.\n\nPawnbrokers\n\n5.26 Whilst section 3(6) of the 1968 Act prohibits pawnbrokers from taking in pawn any firearm or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, or any shot gun, a pawnbroker is not debarred from registration as a firearms dealer. In these circumstances, the police will wish to consider an application under the same terms as any other dealer.\n\nSales of firearms unproven or out of proof\n\n5.27 The provisions of the Gun Barrel Proof Acts are explained in Chapter 23.\n\nRecords of transactions\n\n5.28 Persons who by way of trade or business manufacture, sell or transfer firearms or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, shot guns, or air weapons, are required by section 40 of the 1968 Act to keep a register of transactions and to enter in it the particulars specified in Schedule 4 to the Act and Part 4 of Schedule 5 to the Firearms Rules 1998 (firearms dealer’s register of transactions) (as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) (No.2) Rules 2019). The Act does not specifically require a registered dealer to be satisfied before purchasing a firearm to which section 1 applies, or a shot gun, that the vendor is in possession of a certificate for that firearm, but the dealer is required to record the transaction in the register.\n\n5.29 It is good practice for firearms dealers to notify their local police where they take in firearms, including shot guns, which are not held lawfully on a firearm or shot gun certificate. This will enable the police to make checks to ensure they are not recorded as lost or stolen.\n\n5.30 Section 18(1) of the 1988 Act allows a visitor who has not been in Great Britain for more than thirty days in the preceding twelve months to purchase a firearm from a firearms dealer for the purpose only of it being exported without first coming into their possession without the need for a certificate. A firearms dealer is required to record the transaction in their register together with the number and place of issue of any passport in the purchaser’s possession. A passport will normally provide evidence for a firearms dealer that a visitor satisfies the thirty day criterion. Section 40(7) of the 1968 Act empowers the Secretary of State to make rules varying or adding to Schedule 4 of the 1968 Act. Such changes were made by Rule 10(5) of the Firearms Rules 1998 and by the Firearms (Amendment) Rules 2007.\n\n5.31 Section 38(8) of the 1968 Act provides for the surrender of a dealer’s register (or, if the register is kept electronically, a visible and legible copy of the information) and certificate of registration if their name is removed from the register of firearms dealers. It is an offence for the dealer not to comply within twenty-one days of a notice in writing requiring them to surrender the register.\n\nInspection of dealers’ records\n\n5.32 Persons who by way of trade or business manufacture, sell or transfer firearms or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, shot guns, or air weapons, are required by section 40(4) of the 1968 Act to allow any police officer (including civilian officers) duly authorised in writing by the chief officer of police to enter their premises and inspect all stock in hand and the register of transactions. In all cases, the inspecting officer must produce such written authority on demand. Form 122 is a convenient form of authorisation for this purpose. Under section 40(3A) of the 1968 Act, dealers are required to keep their register of transactions so that entries made in the register are available for inspection for a period of at least five years. If the register is kept on computer, dealers must ensure that a copy of the information contained therein can be produced in a visible and legible form which can be taken away by the inspecting officer. The register should include firearms taken in for repair or storage, although these are not regarded as transfers and consequently notification to the police is not required.\n\n5.33 Section 41 of the 1968 Act enables chief officers of police, at their discretion, to exempt from all or any of the provisions about keeping records persons who manufacture, test or repair components for manufacturers of shot guns but do not handle complete shot guns. Chief officers should satisfy themselves as to the facts in each case, including the type of work carried on and the extent of the danger that each situation presents as a possible source of firearms for criminals. Each case should be reviewed at regular intervals.\n\nChapter 6: Exemptions from the requirement to hold a certificate\n\n6.1 The exemptions in the Acts apply to a particular category of person and exempt them so far as firearms are held, purchased or acquired for some particular and specified purpose. The exemptions may be divided into two groups; those that concern possession and purchase and acquisition, and those that concern only possession. The exemptions are dealt with in this way in the following two sections of this chapter.\n\nPossession and purchase or acquisition of any type of firearm or ammunition without a certificate\n\nFirearms dealers and their servants\n\n6.2 The exemption in section 8(1) of the 1968 Act covers the possession, purchase and acquisition of firearms and ammunition in the ordinary course of the dealer’s business. It extends to dealers and their servants. There is no legal definition of a “servant”, but it should be noted that a letter of authority does not automatically make someone a “servant” for these purposes. An employee of the dealer working for a firearms-related business would be a “servant,” but it is not the case that anyone whose services the dealer uses on any occasion will necessarily be a servant e.g. a self-employed outworker (such as an engraver). In these circumstances the outworker would be required to register as a firearms dealer. The possession of the firearms and ammunition by a servant may only be for the ordinary business of the dealer as directed by the RFD holder.\n\n6.3 A registered firearms dealer must have a firearm certificate or shot gun certificate as appropriate for any gun they possess for uses unconnected with their dealership. Under section 3(3) of the 1968 Act, a person is prohibited from undertaking the repair, test or proof of a firearm or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, or of a shot gun, unless the person seeking the repair or other work produces a certificate authorising their possession of the firearm or ammunition, or the shot gun, or alternatively shows that they are entitled to have it without a certificate.\n\nMiniature rifle ranges\n\n6.4 Under section 11(4) of the 1968 Act, a person conducting or carrying on a miniature rifle range (whether for a rifle club or otherwise), or shooting gallery at which only miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch calibre or air weapons not declared by the Secretary of State to be specially dangerous are used, may, without holding a firearm certificate, purchase, acquire or have in their possession such miniature rifles and suitable ammunition. Persons using the range are exempt from holding a firearm certificate in respect only of the use of such miniature rifles and ammunition at the range or gallery.\n\n6.5 Any further exemption in the case of a club can only be secured by obtaining approval from the Secretary of State (see Chapter 17). It should be noted that “Exemption Certificates” issued by the Showman’s Guild or the National Small-bore Rifle Association have no legal force but can be considered proof that somebody was operating a miniature rifle range or shooting gallery. There is however no obligation on the operator of the range or gallery to produce any form of documentation, and the police would only be justified in taking action against such an operator where they are not meeting the terms of section 11(4).\n\nPersons in the service of the Crown and police\n\n6.6 Section 54 of the 1968 Act is a general provision relating to all Crown servants and to persons who are members of a police force or civilian officers (police staff employed by, or under the direction and control of, a chief officer of police).
