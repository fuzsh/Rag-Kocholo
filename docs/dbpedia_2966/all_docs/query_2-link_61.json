        "text": "This mostly centers around the bank heist, naturally. Kilmer and Deniro were both carrying US carbines, but what model? The guy called \"Slick\" had a Romanian assault rifle, but it didn't look like a classic AK-47. The black cop used a Benelli pump action, reminds me of the kind patrol cops pack in the back of their vehicles. I didn't recognize Pacino's rifle. Also, what was the sidearm that Deniro used throughout the movie?<P>Going off on a tangent: I understand why those two idiots in real life decided to pop off a Los Angeles Bank after watching the movie \"Heat\". You'd have to have nothing to lose to want to re-enact that crazy ass scene, but damn, what a way to go! The real life shootout was pretty dissapointing IMO. Two numbskulls in full kevlar suits took the LAPD over two hours to takedown. Plus they had to knockoff a local gun dealership to get some ammo and better weapons. What a bunch of amateurs. What were the guys wearing exactly? I think they actually had kevlar helmets and boots. I didn't know there were such things. I heard both guys between the two of them received dozens of rounds to the body, but since most of them were hippy-sized 9mm rounds fired off from a distance, they bounced off the kevlar or were easily absorbed. WTF?!?! I thought standard issue was a .40? I know the caliber depends on county, but this is Orange County. What were these officers thinking?<P>You'd think within twenty minutes of the shootout there'd be SWAT field snipers on roofs ready to put bullets in the guys' chests. How did one of the guys get killed? I know one got a pistol round to the back of the head at close range (cops cornered him). <P>The two crazies were looking for a challenge. I think what they got dissapointed them. The response from the LAPD was pretty unorganized and endangered public safety. Two thumbs down for the cops.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Two thumbs down for the cops.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Right. Like you'd do any fucking better. Two very heavily armed and well protected guys lumber out of a bank and open fire. Do you think you'd play Rambo and pick them off with your .50 Desert Eagle at 150ft? Or maybe go knives akimbo and spring from a bush, slashing those do-bad bank robbers to sushi?<P>No.<P>You'd fall back and plan, and try to find an opening. The SWAT team is mobilizing but they need an attack plan, something that never happens because the two suspects are constantly on the move. Sharpshooters never get their shot because both bank robbers are jumping from car to car, hiding, shooting back at anything remotely suspicious. So it comes down to the field officer who is methodical, organized and waiting to spring in to action. One of the suspects killed himself while the other opened up with his AK, hitting glass and metal. That gave the attacking officers time to acquire shots and take him down. There was initial panic but they gained control of the situation and didn't go gung-ho like so many lameass movies like to show. Two thumbs up to the police for being smart and keeping everyone innocent alive.\n\nHoyle your a bit off. From the movie Pacino was carrying a 1911 with pearl handles (bet you got that one). `Slick' didn't participate in the bank heist. IIRC Pacino used a M-14 to take down the guy carrying the kid (maybe not). Most of the time all the bank robbers had full auto M-16, look at the stocks, not collapsable (not quite sure about that one either). During the armored car heist they all had M-16 type thinks.<P>I am a bit more familar with the real life shoutout. It didn't happen in Orange County. The guys both had full auto AK type weapons with drums, and lots of armor. Their legs were not armored, one of them got shot in the legs then offed himself. The other was shot by a police officer with a rifle he had gotten from a gun store, and died of his wounds.<P>Most any full length rifle cartidges (30-06, 7mm, 7.62 NATO(.308Win)), and 5.56mm will go right through armor, even at medium range, due to their high velocity. Most cops just don't carry that kind of weaponry. No ordinary pistol round will beat armor, nor shotgun pellets (slugs maybe). That's why afterwords the Governor of CA announced the CA Natl. Guard was giving several thousand M-16's to the LAPD, and other Departments. Now every LAPD shift commander (about every third or fourth car) has an AR-15 (=semi-auto M-16) in addition to a shotgun. And street cops can use .45 in their sidearm if they choose, and slugs in their shotguns."
