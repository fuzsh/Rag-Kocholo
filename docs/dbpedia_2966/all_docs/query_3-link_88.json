(Persons with a disability which hinders them from drawing a bow/crossbow may use an arrowgun/airbow during archery seasons when in possession of an authorization form provided by DWR and signed by their physician.\n\n2 Slingbows may NOT be used for bear or elk.\n\nAll methods may be used to hunt nuisance species, crow, and small game.\n\nPlease refer to local firearms ordinances for any additional prohibitions that may be in your locality.\n\nOther Weapons Usage\n\nUnlawful to:\n\nHunt migratory game birds with a shotgun capable of holding more than three shells in the magazine and chamber, combined, unless allowed by federal regulations and authorized by the Department.\n\nDischarge a firearm, muzzleloader, arrowgun, or archery tackle in or across or within the right-of-way of any road.\n\nCast a light attached to a vehicle or from a vehicle beyond a roadway upon places used by deer without written permission of the landowner or at anytime while in the possession of a rifle, shotgun, pistol, muzzleloader, arrowgun, archery tackle, or speargun.\n\nHandle any firearm in a reckless manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person.\n\nShoot a rifle or pistol at wild birds or animals on or over the public inland waters of the state.

Open carry or having a valid concealed handgun permit does not authorize the possession of any weapon on property or in places where such possession is otherwise prohibited by law or by the owner of private property. Neither open carry nor a concealed handgun permit authorizes the use of a firearm for hunting. Lawful use of firearms for hunting remains controlled by law and regulation."
