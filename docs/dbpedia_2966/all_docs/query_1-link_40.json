        "text": "Few props are as inherently cinematic as firearms. For decades, creative filmmakers have been pushing past the bounds of reality to craft truly inventive and unique movie guns. Whether in the action, thriller, or sci-fi genres, there are many examples of writers and directors injecting an added dose of creativity into their shootouts by inventing fictional firearms. Join us in counting down the most creative guns in movies.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n15. Puppet Guns - Shoot ‘Em Up (2007)\n\nShoot ‘Em Up • G uns on strings\n\nShoot ‘Em Up is chock full of creative shootouts. This action sequence finds our protagonist trapped in a gun warehouse and, as usual, severely outnumbered. To turn the tide of battle, he makes use of numerous guns he has attached to strings and planted throughout the building, puppeteering them to deadly effect. It’s a creative use of movie firearms and one that fits perfectly well with the over-the-top tone of the film.\n\nMovie guns\n\nConclusion\n\nIn its essence it's nothing but a violent live action Bugs Bunny cartoon and I dug it.\n\nFull review - Felix Vasquez, Cinema Crazed\n\nGuns used in movies\n\n14. Golden Gun - The Man With the Golden Gun (1974)\n\nScaramanga assembles and uses his eponymous golden gun\n\nThe James Bond series is full of cool weaponry, but only one gun was so cool that it made its way into the title of a film. The Man With the Golden Gun isn’t one of the best Bond films, it isn’t even the best Roger Moore Bond outing, but it does have a great villain turn from Christopher Lee. And the golden gun itself became one of the most iconic props from the entire franchise.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nRoger Moore's Bond has got a rough deal over the year, but whilst this takes itself a little too lightly it has a lot going for it.\n\nFull Review - Ian Freer, Empire Magazine\n\nMovie guns\n\n13. Motorcycle Minigun - Machete (2013)\n\nMachete rides a motorcycle through the air in front of a massive explosion\n\nIn a movie jam-packed with crazy, over-the-top action sequences, the motorcycle minigun still manages to stand out as a big, fist-pump moment. The cool factor is through the roof. The only downside is that Danny Trejo’s titular Machete character doesn’t use it more.\n\nGuns used in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nThis gleefully excessive pastiche of an exploitation picture delivers everything promised by its own faux trailer.\n\nFull Review - Nigel Floyd\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n12. Noisy Cricket - Men in Black (1997)\n\nExamining the physics of the Noisy Cricket\n\nThe Noisy Cricket might not look like much but it is an extremely powerful little handgun. The small size makes the gun unassuming, but packed inside the tiny casing is quite likely the most powerful weapon in the entire MIB arsenal. Destructive and humorously contradictory, a perfect combo for a sci-fi, action, comedy film.\n\nMovie guns\n\nConclusion\n\n[Director Barry Sonnenfeld] establishes the premise in the wildly entertaining first 45 minutes and then glides along for the rest of the film on the strength of a poker-faced comic sensibility.\n\nFull Review - Michael Ollove, Baltimore Sun\n\nGuns used in movies\n\n11. Holy Shotgun - Constantine (2005)\n\nAssembling the holy shotgun\n\nConstantine, far from being a perfect film, has some really strong elements working for it in spite of any shortcomings. Perhaps the strongest aspects of Constantine are the production design and level of general inventiveness. The holy shotgun is a sight to behold and it gets plenty of usage from Keanu Reeves’ titular character.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nConstantine deserves a cult following and should be remembered for all the things it did right instead of its perceived wrongs.\n\nFull Review - Drew Dietsch\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n10. Gun Leg - Planet Terror (2007)\n\nCherry puts her machine-gun leg to use\n\nPlanet Terror is the second Robert Rodriguez film to make our list, and not the last either. Rodriguez has a keen sense for badass, creative weaponry. Planet Terror was the first feature film in the Grindhouse double-feature presentation, with the second half being written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Be sure to check out our ranking of the best Tarantino movies.\n\nThe film has a wonderfully fun style and the machine-gun leg is the perfect encapsulation of this movie’s goofy sensibilities.\n\nMovie guns\n\nConclusion\n\nGloopy and outrageous, this schlock horror tribute is pure trash... in the best possible sense.\n\nFull Review - Jamie Russell, BBC\n\nGuns used in movies\n\n9. Pulse Rifle - Aliens (1986)\n\nHow the pulse rifle was created\n\nJames Cameron’s Aliens was a fantastic follow-up to Ridley Scott’s original sci-fi horror masterpiece. Cameron traded some of the horror for a stronger emphasis on action, and with more action came new sci-fi weaponry. The M56 Smart Gun deserves some love too, but it is the classic colonial marine pulse rifle that gets the spot on our list.\n\nThe design is iconic, and the sound design for the gunfire is creative and highly memorable. If you are a fan of the original, you can likely learn a lot by reading the Alien screenplay.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nScene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.\n\nFull Review - Rick Kogan, Chicago Tribune\n\nMovie guns\n\n8. Guitar-Case Guns - Desperado (1995)\n\nGuitar case guns in action\n\nThe middle film in Robert Rodriguez’s “Mexico” trilogy is undoubtedly the strongest. It’s a full-throttle, guns-blazing action film with a great sense of style. The previous film in the Mexico trilogy gave viewers a guitar case full of guns. Desperado takes it one step further and delivers guitar cases that were literally guns themselves. A pair of machine-gun guitar cases and a rocket-launcher guitar case form a trio of cool movie weapons.\n\nMovie guns\n\nConclusion\n\nLike an R-rated, violent Roadrunner cartoon.\n\nFull Review - Nell Minow, Common Sense Media\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n7. Deadly Codpiece - From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)\n\nDon’t mess with Tom Savini\n\nOne last creative Robert Rodriguez weapon to round out the list. The codpiece revolver worn by Tom Savini, who dubbed it the crotch rocket, is a funny sight gag and a deadly last-resort for self-defense against vampire strippers.\n\nThis codpiece also appears in Robert Rodriguez’s earlier film, Desperado, but it doesn’t get used in that film, disappointingly.\n\nLuckily, From Dusk Till Dawn came along a couple of years later and put the prop to good use. Quentin Tarantino stars in and wrote From Dusk Till Dawn, meaning there is plenty of great Tarantino dialogue.\n\nGuns used in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nStill sizzles like a capsaicin-spiked grindhouse meatloaf baked and served just under the wire of its sell-by date.\n\nFull review - Nick Rogers, The Film Yap\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n6. Gristle Gun - eXistenZ (1999)\n\nBirth of the gristle gun\n\nThe gristle gun is a wholly unique cinematic weapon. From David Cronenberg, the master of body horror, comes a body horror firearm, and not the only one on this list either. The gristle gun makes use of Cronenberg’s penchant for stomach-churning special effects. This gun is comprised entirely of biological components and is inventive and grotesque in equal measure.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nDark, delirious fun.\n\nFull Review - Geoff Andrew, Time Out\n\nMovie guns\n\n5. Auto 9 - RoboCop (1987)\n\nRoboCop puts the Auto9 to use\n\nWhen the futuristic Detroit police department set about creating the ultimate law-enforcement hybrid of man and machine, they, of course, had to develop a highly-effective, personalized pistol for RoboCop as well. The Auto 9 is an automatic handgun that can deal with creeps with ultimate efficiency. It even has a nifty storage slot built right into RoboCop’s metallic thigh.\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nA sardonic but perfectly-realised depiction of a mayhem-fuelled near future.\n\nFull Review - Clark Collis, Empire Magazine\n\nMovie guns\n\n4. Sleeve Guns - Equilibrium (2002)\n\nChristian Bale busts out the gun kata\n\nProduced and released as a direct answer to The Matrix, the reception to Equilibrium has swung back and forth over the years. A new form of pseudo-martial-arts was devised for the film. It was dubbed “gun kata” and fused hand-to-hand combat with firearm usage.\n\nOne sci-fi advancement that makes the practice of gun kata possible are the high-tech sleeves that can reload your guns for you. If you are a fan, you might be interested in reading the screenplay for the Matrix.\n\nfamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nViolent post-nuclear sci-fi is Orwellian.\n\nFull Review - Nell Minow, Common Sense Media\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n3. Flesh Gun - Videodrome (1983)\n\nThe handgun fuses with James Woods\n\nWith Videodrome, David Cronenberg makes his second appearance on our list, this time with an even more horrific and sickening body horror handgun. The special effects for this gun-hand hybrid are astonishing and the visual is unforgettable. The flesh gun plays a pivotal role in the plot as well, it is not just for shock value.\n\nVideodrome is bursting with creativity at every level, and the flesh gun is a great example of Cronenberg’s brilliance. Videodrome made it onto our list of the best horror movies ever made. Find out what else made the cut.\n\nguns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's hard to overstate how premonitory David Cronenberg's masterpiece turned out to be.\n\nFull Review - Sean Fennessey, The Ringer\n\nGuns in movies\n\n2. Lawgiver Mk. II - Dredd (2012)\n\nJudge on judge violence\n\n2012’s Dredd, an alternate take on the Judge Dredd source material, was an underrated sci-fi, action flick. The Lawgiver Mk. II is the signature weapon of the judges, and it is a real beast. This high-tech handgun has a number of alternate fire modes and ammunition types, all of which get used throughout the film in the various shootouts. Fully automatic, armor-piercing, stun, incendiary, and more, it even contains a built-in miniature rocket launcher.\n\nfamous guns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nI may have never seen a non-horror film as relentlessly, brutally, and crowd-pleasingly violent as this skintight adaptation of the long-running British comic-book character.\n\nFull Review - Marc Savlov, Austin Chronicle\n\nFamous guns in movies\n\n1. ZF1 - The Fifth Element (1997)\n\nA demonstration of the ZF1\n\nWithin The Fifth Element, the ZF1 is a brand-new creation and is being pitched as the ultimate weapon to end all weapons. It is easy to see why. This thing has every conceivable option you would possibly want in a sci-fi gun: bullets, poisonous arrows, a net launcher, a rocket launcher, a flame thrower, and even a freeze-blaster.\n\nIt is truly the Swiss army knife of movie guns. The ZF1 has it all.\n\nGuns in movies\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Fifth Element has enough eye-appeal for two good movies.\n\nFull Review - Gene Siskel, Chicago Tribune\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Best Action Movies of All Time\n\nThose were the most creative movie guns to ever grace the silver screen. If all of this talk of firearms got you in the mood for some exciting shootouts, then you’ll be sure to enjoy our list of the best action movies ever made.
