        "text": "A forensics expert hired to examine the gun that discharged while Alec Baldwin was rehearsing with it on the set of the film “Rust” in New Mexico, killing the movie’s cinematographer, has issued a new report that determined the actor must have pulled the trigger, a conclusion at odds with his account.\n\nSince the fatal shooting of the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, in October 2021, Mr. Baldwin has said that he had pulled the hammer back and let it go just before the gun discharged, maintaining that he did not pull the trigger. The revolver was supposed to be loaded with dummy rounds, inert cartridges used to make it appear loaded on camera, but it turned out to be loaded with a round of live ammunition.\n\nProsecutors have been skeptical of his claim that he did not pull the trigger, and in January Mr. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the case. A new set of prosecutors dismissed the charges against him in April, saying new evidence suggested that the gun Mr. Baldwin had been rehearsing with that day might have been modified, potentially making an unintentional discharge easier.\n\nThe prosecutors said at the time that they would consider refiling charges against the actor after a new examination of the gun.\n\nThe report from the forensics expert, Lucien C. Haag, did not directly address whether the gun had been modified. But it concluded that the old-fashioned Pietta revolver would have needed about two pounds of pressure on the trigger to discharge a round.\n\n“Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver,” Mr. Haag wrote in the report, which was released through a public records request. He also included photos of Mr. Baldwin handling a revolver on set earlier in filming, highlighting the actor’s finger on or near the trigger as he was cocking the gun.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
