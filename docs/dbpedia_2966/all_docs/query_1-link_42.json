        "text": "Heat\n\nTheatrical Release Poster\n\nCountry United States Directed by Michael Mann Release Date 1995 Language English Studio Regency Enterprises Distributor Warner Bros.\n\nMain Cast Character Actor Lt. Vincent Hanna Al Pacino Neil McCauley Robert De Niro Chris Shiherlis Val Kilmer Michael Cheritto Tom Sizemore Waingro Kevin Gage Roger Van Zant William Fichtner Sgt. Drucker Mykelti Williamson Det. Casals Wes Studi Det. Bosko Ted Levine Trejo Danny Trejo\n\nHeat is a 1995 American crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first onscreen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high-end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro). Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the \"High Incident Bandits\" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout).\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Heat:\n\nWARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nPistols\n\nColt M1991A1 Series 80 Officer's ACP\n\nLieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) carries an ivory-gripped Colt M1991A1 Series 80 Officer's ACP with a full-sized trigger and ring hammer as his sidearm. Hanna carries his pistol on his waist in a cross-draw holster. Hanna's choice of sidearm might also be a nod to his service with the Marine Corps.\n\nHeckler & Koch USP\n\nNeil McCauley (Robert De Niro) uses a Heckler & Koch USP as his sidearm in the early scenes of the film. It is first seen during the armored car robbery, when he carries it in a holster on his tactical vest (along with five spare magazines). Note the checkered back of the grip and the shape of the external thumb safety and slide release, all uncommon to a SIG-Sauer P220. It is usually not seen clearly during the film, but the shape of the slide can easily be discerned during the shootout at the drive-in theater (when McCauley fires the gun through the windshield of his sedan at the assassin with the Steyr TMP). McCauley then dumps his USP for the SIG-Sauer P220, most likely to get rid of the evidence, since it was used during the drive-in theater shootout.\n\nNOTE: IMFDB previously identified this USP as the .45 ACP model. This is likely inaccurate, because the USP-45 was not around at the time that the movie was filmed (it was introduced in May 1995, nearly two years after the USP-9 and USP-40, while Heat was filmed mostly during 1994). The USP in the movie is most likely a 9x19mm model, since most pistols in Hollywood's prop houses were chambered in this caliber at the time. Further evidence of the pistol's caliber can be seen during the armored car robbery; the magazines visible on McCauley's vest are made out of polymer, consistent with the mags found only on full-size 9mm and .40-caliber USP magazines, whereas USP-45 magazines are metal and have ribbed sides.\n\nSIG-Sauer P220\n\nAfter dumping his H&K USP after the drive-in theater shootout, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) replaces his USP with a SIG-Sauer P220 in .45 ACP as his sidearm for the rest of the film. In the script it is also mentioned that he holds a .45 caliber pistol.\n\nStar Megastar\n\nWaingro (Kevin Gage), the unstable newcomer to Neil McCauley's (Robert De Niro) crew, carries a blued Star Megastar during the armored car robbery. He uses this one to first pistol-whip and then execute the first guard (stuntman Rick Avery) by shooting him in the face at point-blank range. He also carries a nickel one when he answers the door at his hotel room.\n\nBeretta 84FS\n\nChris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) is seen with a compact pistol in a holster next to him when McCauley walks in and sees him sleeping on the floor. He wakes up and then sticks the holstered gun in his pants. It appears to be a Beretta \"Cheetah\" variant. Judging by the thick floorplate on the bottom of the magazine, it appears to be a double-stack model, so probably a Beretta 84FS (or possibly the similar Beretta 84F), and not the similar single-stack 85FS. We know this is an F/FS variant and not an earlier 84 or 84B/BB variant because it has a matte black finish rather than a reflective black finish.\n\nBeretta 92FS\n\nThe LAPD patrol officers responding to the bank robbery return fire on Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and his crew with their standard issue Beretta 92FSs.\n\nBeretta 92SB-C\n\nSergeant Drucker (Mykelti Williamson) carries a Beretta 92SB-C as his sidearm, which is only drawn while he is pursuing Cheritto after running out of ammunition for his Mossberg 590 shotgun.\n\nM1911 variant\n\nOne of the SWAT officers checking Shiherlis' car has an unknown M1911 variant in his holster. Since Kimbers weren't issued yet to LAPD officers, it is doubtful it is a Kimber Custom II, the current sidearm of LAPD SWAT units.\n\nRuger KP90\n\nMichael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) has a Ruger KP90 in a cross-draw holster on his tactical vest during the armored car robbery. This is NOT the P90, as sometimes claimed, but the stainless KP90.\n\nGlock 19\n\nAfter McCauley executes Waingro, he leaves the room, and a detective working surveillance at the hotel draws a Glock 19 on him.\n\nTaurus PT92AFS\n\nA nickel Taurus PT92AFS can be seen in the holster of the bank guard that McCauley kicks to the floor during the start of the bank robbery. This may also be a PT99, depending on the sights, which are not visible while the weapon is holstered.\n\nRevolvers\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 36\n\nWhen Hanna and his men visit Alan Marciano (Hank Azaria) in Las Vegas to question him about his relationship with Charlene Shiherlis (Ashley Judd), Det. Casals (Wes Studi) is seen in the background holding a nickel Smith & Wesson Model 36 snub-nose revolver.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 38 \"Bodyguard\"\n\nDuring the armored car robbery, as soon as Waingro uses his Star Megastar to execute the first guard, McCauley guns down the second guard (Thomas Rosales Jr.) as he tries to grab a Smith & Wesson Model 38 \"Bodyguard\" from his ankle holster.\n\nSubmachine Guns & Machine Pistols\n\nHeckler & Koch HK94A3 (mocked-up as MP5A3)\n\nWhat appear to be Heckler & Koch MP5A3s are used by LAPD SWAT officers throughout the film; however, close inspection reveals that they are actually the same partially-converted full-auto HK94A3 carbines that have appeared in numerous other motion pictures (including Predator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, etc.). One of these weapons is used by an officer in a hiding position during the stakeout scene at the precious metals repository. Another HK94A3 is used by a surveillance team watching for Shiherlis, and more of these weapons are used by the SWAT team that is sent to the hotel in the climax.\n\nSteyr TMP\n\nThe assassin sent to the drive-in theater (Max Daniels) to kill McCauley brings a Steyr TMP.\n\nShotguns\n\nBenelli M3 Super 90\n\nAfter the assassin is gunned down at the drive-in theater, the pickup truck driver starts to drive towards the exit, but just as he reaches the gate, Cheritto steps out from behind cover and opens fire with a Benelli M3 Super 90 12-gauge shotgun. The shotgun is both pump-action and semi-automatic but Cheritto uses pump-action only.\n\nMossberg 590\n\nDetective Casals (Wes Studi) brings a Mossberg 590 to breach the door of Hugh Benny's (Henry Rollins) apartment. Sergeant Drucker (Mykelti Williamson) carries the exact same Mossberg 590 during the shootout outside the bank after the heist. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) later takes one from an officer towards the end of the film as he chases down McCauley on the tarmac.\n\nMossberg 500\n\nSome of the LAPD officers are seen armed with Mossberg 500s during the bank robbery shootout.\n\nIthaca 37 \"Stakeout\"\n\nAn Ithaca 37 \"Stakeout\" short-barreled shotgun can be seen resting behind a security desk when McCauley goes to kill Waingro in the hotel.\n\nRemington 870\n\nSome of the LAPD officers are seen armed with Remington 870s during the bank robbery shootout.\n\nRifles & Carbines\n\nColt Model 654\n\nDuring the armored car robbery, McCauley carries a Colt Model 654 carbine, a 14.5\" barreled predecessor to the M4, with M16A1-style lightweight barrel and sights. He uses this weapon to execute the second guard (the one who tries to draw the Smith & Wesson Model 38 \"Bodyguard\" in his ankle holster), who gets hit in his right arm, his shoulder and his chest. Based on configuration, it appears to be a 654 upper on a full-auto converted AR-15 SP1 carbine lower receiver group, with a drop-in auto sear to allow it fire fully-automatic (as evidenced by the pivot pin at the front, which is the \"screw hole\" design).\n\nColt Model 733\n\nDuring the armored car robbery, Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) uses a Colt Model 733 short-barreled carbine as his weapon of choice. During the bank robbery, Shiherlis and McCauley both carry the Model 733. These are compact versions of the M16 rifle family with 11.5-inch barrels.\n\nTrivia: Allegedly, footage of Shiherlis expertly reloading his rifle during the bank robbery shootout has been shown to American Marine and Special Forces trainees, with the message from their instructor, \"This is how I want you to reload\".\n\nFN FNC\n\nLt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) pulls out an FN FNC assault rifle during the shootout on Flower Street and uses it to kill Cheritto when Cheritto - who is firing at Drucker and several other cops - grabs a little girl as a human shield. According to the on-set armorer, Hanna's rifle was a select-fire FNC (as opposed to the semi-auto only civilian version) that was chopped down by the armorer to a Para length barrel, and an M16-style birdcage flash-hider was attached. Despite being a full-auto weapon, Michael Mann instructed Al Pacino to fire only in semi-automatic mode, because Hanna and all of the other cops who were involved in the shootout would be concerned about the possibility of endangering bystanders.\n\nFN FAL 50.61\n\nDuring the armored car robbery, Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) uses a 20\" barreled FN FAL 50.61 Paratrooper version with a side-folding stock. He uses this weapon to execute the third guard with a double tap to the sternum and a third shot to the head. This is a military tactic known as a Failure Drill or Mozambique Drill, and is a prominent feature in Michael Mann's films (it appears twice in Heat - this incident, and then at the end of the film, when McCauley executes Waingro in his hotel room).\n\nHeckler & Koch HK91A2\n\nAt the drive-in theater, Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) covers McCauley (Robert De Niro) with a Heckler & Koch HK91A2 fitted with a bipod, and manages to take out the Steyr TMP-wielding assassin with a shot to the back. Shiherlis can be seen holding the HK91A2 on the film's poster.\n\nIMI Galil ARM\n\nMichael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) uses an IMI Galil ARM Model 372 with a wooden handguard during the bank robbery and the shootout. While inside the bank, the stock is removed from the mounting bracket. However, it appears when he enters the car, an obvious continuity error. He gets separated from the rest of the crew during the shootout but manages to wound one of Hanna's men, Detective Schwartz (Jerry Trimble), by shooting him in the shoulder beside a transit bus. Oddly enough, Mann refers to the weapon as a 7.62mm in his audio commentary.\n\nM16A1 (with M16A2 handguard)\n\nSeveral M16A1 assault rifles are featured prominently in the film, fitted with M16A2-style handguards and Rapidex-type rear sight adjustment knobs. They are wielded by various L.A.P.D. detectives, including Detective Casals (Wes Studi), Detective Mike Bosko (Ted Levine) and Detective Schwartz (Jerry Trimble), and are also used by some of the SWAT officers. Casals uses one to assist in disabling the Lincoln Town Car being used as a getaway vehicle, and also manages to shoot and wound Shiherlis during the shootout. According to the on-set armorer, the director wanted the actors to fire in semi-automatic mode only. The reason given was that the police would be less interested in 'suppressing fire' and more interested in controlled shots given the proximity of so many innocent bystanders.\n\nNorinco Type 56-1\n\nDuring the armored car robbery, Trejo (Danny Trejo) carries a Chinese Norinco Type 56-1 assault rifle.\n\nHeckler & Koch SR9(T)\n\nA police sniper of the surveillance team watches over McCauley with a Heckler & Koch SR9(T) sniper rifle. This same sniper is also seen with the rifle during the stakeout for Shiherlis.\n\nTrivia\n\nIt appears that some of the shots composed for the film were inspired by several paintings."
