        "text": "1988\n\nCity Locations\n\nNew Mexico (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nRanch, Museum, Unusual\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana, Ranch Style, Southwestern, Neglected, Manufactured Home\n\nAbout Young Guns\n\nYoung Guns was directed by Christopher Cain and it features a cast that includes Emilio Estevez, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Dermot Mulroney, Terence Stamp, Casey Siemaszko, Jack Palance, and Terry OâQuinn. Released in 1988, the movie follows the story of William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), a petty criminal seeking refuge with John Tunstall (Terence Stamp), a British rancher.\n\nWith Tunstall's guidance and mentorship, Billy and five other outcasts form the \"regulators,\" who watch over Tunstall's ranch and seek justice for his murder. They face off against corrupt businessman Lawrence Murphy (Jack Palance) and the harsh realities of violence in the Wild West. Through it all, they each achieve personal growth as they learn to stand up for what's right, even if it means risking their lives.\n\nThe film was created with a focus on historical accuracy, particularly when compared to earlier movies about the Lincoln County War. Notably, the depiction of the relationship between Tunstall and Murphy closely aligns with the actual events, much like how it was portrayed in the 1970 Western Chisum.\n\nIt has since gained cult status among Western fans and was followed up by two sequels released in 1990 and 1994, respectively.\n\nYoung Guns Locations\n\nThe production of Young Guns primarily took place in New Mexico. The filming locations included Rancho de las Golondrinas, Cerrillos, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nMost of the Young Gun scenes were filmed at Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch, 15 Bonanza Creek Lane in Santa Fe, and Cerrillos Village on I-14 between Santa Fe and Albuquerque. The Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch in Santa Fe has served as a filming location for several other films, such as Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, Cowboys & Aliens, All The Pretty Horses, and James Mangoldâs (2007) remake of 3:10 To Yuma, among others.\n\nOther breathtaking locations in the area included Galisteo, Ojo Caliente Mineral Springs, and Tesuque Pueblo. All these locations are situated in the stunning Sangre de Cristo Mountains with amazing views and beautiful sunsets that provided a spectacular backdrop for the classic Western movie.\n\nA trip to the Young Guns filming locations would be highly worthwhile for any fan. Not only can visitors take in all the majestic sites used as backdrops for the movie, but they can also pay homage to some of Hollywood's biggest stars that made appearances in the movie, including Tom Cruise!\n\nThe area has several other attractions, including Hacienda Galisteo, with its orchard used for part of Lincolnâs wedding scene. And if you are up for some relaxation, stop by Ojo Caliente Mineral Springs to rejuvenate during your stay in New Mexico.\n\nThe film opens with scenes in the town of Lincoln, an old mining village set in New Mexico. The movie follows a group of âRegulators,â led by English cattleman John Tunstall (Terence Stamp), who hires a young gunman named Billy (Emilio Estevez) to join them.\n\nFilmed in Los Cerrillos Village, viewers catch glimpses of a bank, hideouts, and the typical small-town atmosphere. The film crew was tasked with transforming the little village into a historically accurate example of 19th-century frontier life. To do this, the production team added dirt roads, authentic buildings from that era, and period-appropriate dress for all cast members and local extras. They also changed some street signs and storefronts.\n\nFans still reminisce about the scene when Tunstall strives to enlighten and bring culture to the young men under his tutelage while facing off against his competitor, rancher Lawrence Murphy (Jack Palance). Murphy is a well-connected Irishman who collaborates with the dishonest Santa Fe Ring.\n\nLos Cerrillos Village still stands today as one of Santa Fe's most charming Old West towns. Located on Interstate 14 between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, visitors to this old mining village can participate in various activities, such as horseback riding or hiking on nearby trails, or explore historical sites like the infamous Cerrillos Hills State Park.\n\nTourists can also visit local landmarks like the historic St Joseph Catholic Church or browse artwork from local artists at various galleries around town. To get to Los Cerillos Village from either Santa Fe or Albuquerque, take I-14 or NM-14 N until you reach your destination.\n\nBefore returning to the band, Doc (Kiefer Sutherland) encounters Yen Sun (Alice Carter). They team up to eliminate Sheriff William J. Brady (Danny Kamin) and his associates who are involved in corruption.\n\nThe scene was recorded at Rancho de las Golondrinas, a historic site located in Santa Fe County, New Mexico. This location was used to depict the exterior of John Tunstallâs ranch, providing a beautiful backdrop for the climactic shootout between Doc Scurlock and Sheriff Brady.\n\nThe ranch has been around since the 18th century and is renowned for its breathtaking views, marked by rolling hills, lush vegetation, ancient buildings, old barns, and centuries-old stone walls. The great colonial military leader and governor, Don Juan Bautista de Anza, mentioned this place during his expeditionary force's stop in 1780. The ranch provided goods for trade and a stopover for caravans on their journey from or to Santa Fe.\n\nToday, visitors to this historical site can take a tour, enjoy its vistas, and attend cultural events, including traditional music concerts or festivals celebrating local customs. To get to Rancho de las Golondrinas from Albuquerque, take I-25 Northbound until exit 271 toward La Cienega/Farm to Market 50 F. At that point, Follow Entrada La Cienega to Los Pinos Rd in La Cienega, where you will find the entrance to Rancho de las Golondrinas.\n\nThe final scene in Young Guns depicts a chaotic gun battle between the protagonists and antagonists. Charlie (Casey Siemaszko) and Kinney (Allen Keller) shoot each other dead, while Steve \"Dirty\" (Dermot Mulroney) is killed helping Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips) ride away with Doc and Yen. Alex (Terry O'Quinn) is gunned down by a Gatling gun, and Billy (Emilio Estevez) escapes after shooting Murphy (Jack Palance) between the eyes. The intense shoot-out was filmed on Main Street in the small town of Los Cerrillos, New Mexico.\n\nThe Western atmosphere of Los Cerrillos Main St provided an ideal setting for the scene. Its false-front stores, wooden sidewalks, and dirt roads all resemble those of the Wild West era. This charming old mining village offers visitors an immersive experience, including shops, diners, galleries, museums, live shows, and more.\n\nIf you want to visit this historic location where Young Guns was filmed, it's easy to get to! Los Cerrillos is located south of Santa Fe off State Highway 14 at 30 Main St., Los Cerrillos, NM 87010, USA.\n\nBook a trip to the Albuquerque International Sunport. From there, take a private car ride using I-40 E and NM-14 N to reach Main St in Los Cerrillos.\n\nYoung Guns tells the tale of Billy The Kid, a notorious outlaw of the Old West. With a humorous and entertaining script, excellent performances from Emilio Estevez as Billy and Kiefer Sutherland as a sensitive type, and a visually dynamic showy style, Young Guns has become a classic Western movie.\n\nHowever, itâs the Young Guns filming locations that truly brought the story to life, and any huge fan of the film will enjoy going on a trip to where the magic happened. Other locations that provided backdrops to the movie include the Sonoran Desert and Tucson, Arizona.\n\nThereâs also plenty to do around Tucson, from visiting the Saguaro National Park to exploring the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. While there, also visit the Pima Air & Space Museum, Tucson Botanical Gardens, and the San Xavier del Bac Mission.\n\nYoung Guns made a lasting contribution to the movie industry by helping usher in a new Western era that combines fun action with serious drama. It paved the way for films like Unforgiven (1992) which won Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\n\nAll these factors make Young Guns worth watching for any fan of Westerns or just anyone who enjoys good storytelling and great acting performances. If you haven't seen it already, then it is highly recommended to check it out - you won't be disappointed!"
