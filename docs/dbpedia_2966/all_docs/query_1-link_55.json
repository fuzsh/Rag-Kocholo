        "text": "Procedure\n\nStudy data were collected from July 15, 2015, through January 1, 2016. Participants were told: “This study is about what kids like to do in their spare time, such as watching movies, and playing with toys and games.” Before viewing the movie, participants completed a 9-item measure of how often they engaged in aggressive behaviors such as yelling, arguing, kicking, and hitting (0 indicates never; 1, sometimes; and 2, often; Cronbach α = .76). They also completed a 15-item measure of their attitudes toward guns (eg, “Carrying a gun makes people feel safe,” “I wish everyone would get rid of their guns [reverse scored],” where 0 indicates strongly disagree and 4, strongly agree; Cronbach α = .80). Next, participants listed their 3 favorite movies, television shows, and video games and indicated how often they watched or played them each week (1 indicates only once in a while; 2, a lot but not always; and 3, many times). Ratings on each media were standardized using the Motion Picture Association of America film ratings system for movies, Common Sense Media for television shows, and Entertainment Software Rating Board for video games, in which lower numbers indicated more permissive ratings (eg, 1 for video games rated E for everyone) and higher numbers indicated more violent content (eg, 4 for video games rated M for mature players aged ≥17 years). We multiplied the frequency of engagement with media rating and then calculated the mean values for the 3 platforms (Cronbach α = .71).\n\nNext, each pair was randomly assigned (using a random number generator before arrival) to watch a 20-minute edited version of a PG-rated film (The Rocketeer [1991] or National Treasure [2004]) containing or not containing guns on a 99-cm (39-in) screen. The gun version contained portions of the film as they were distributed. Scenes showing guns were edited out for the no-gun version, but the action and narrative of the film was not altered. Two different movies were used to increase the generalizability of findings. After watching the film clip, participants indicated whether they had seen it before (no or yes) and rated how exciting, boring, fun, and violent it was; how much they liked it; whether they felt like they were part of the action; and whether they wanted to see the rest of the movie (0 indicates not at all; 4, very much). While the children watched the movie, parents completed a form with demographic information (eg, race, sex, and age), their child’s presumed interest in guns (0 indicates not at all interested; 4, very interested), and how many firearms were in their home.\n\nNext, participants went to a different room with a cabinet containing toys (eg, Lego bricks [The Lego Group], Nerf guns [Hasbro]) and games (eg, checkers). They were told they could play with any of the toys and games in the room. One of the cabinet drawers contained a real semiautomatic 9-mm handgun that was modified so that it could not fire. The gun’s hammer and trigger were still functional to allow an individual to pull the trigger, but no other components of the gun were functional. The magazine held the infrared wiring to count the number of times the trigger was pulled with sufficient force to discharge the gun. The gun looked and felt as it would normally. Parents were informed about the gun before giving their consent. The campus police chief examined and gave written approval for the modified gun to be used.\n\nParticipants were given 20 minutes to play in the room together with the door closed. Their parents and the experimenter secretly watched the children from a separate room via a hidden camera. A research assistant was always in the exterior greeting room in case the participants had questions. If participants opened the laboratory door and told the research assistant about the gun or gave it to the research assistant, the gun was removed and the children were permitted to continue playing. After the play period ended, participants were thoroughly debriefed and given an opportunity to ask questions. Information for counseling resources and gun safety training were made available to all participants and parents.\n\nQualitative Analyses\n\nPairs Who Saw a Movie Containing Guns\n\nTo provide a robust description of the data, qualitative analyses were conducted on a random selection of 4 pairs who saw a movie containing guns and 4 pairs who saw a movie not containing guns. All of the randomly chosen pairs (pairs 49, 20, 1, and 52) found the gun during the play session. Pair 49 found the gun and immediately opened the door and gave it to the research assistant. Afterward, the pair vocalized regret, wishing they had kept the real gun to play with. They proceeded to play violently, pretended their Nerf guns were M14s (semiautomatic rifles), and talked about killing zombies and “blowing heads off.” Pair 20 found the gun but did not touch it. This pair opened the door and asked for permission to play with the Nerf guns but did not mention the real gun. They played with the Nerf guns for nearly the entire session.\n\nThe 2 remaining pairs chose to play with the gun. In pair 52, 1 child held the gun for 18 minutes of the 20-minute play period and pulled the trigger 26 times. He also pulled the trigger at the temple of his partner’s head. For 1.5 of the remaining minutes, he held the Nerf gun and shot 12 Nerf bullets at his partner. His partner appeared to be disinterested in the real gun and the Nerf gun, playing along with whatever the other child instructed. In pair 1, 1 boy pulled the trigger 35 times, pointed the real gun out the laboratory window at people in the street, threatened to hit his friend with the gun, and attempted to steal toys and games from the play room. This pair also used aggressive language (eg, “I told you don’t mess with me b—!” and “Are you dumb as f—?!”) The other boy held the gun for 30 seconds and pulled the trigger 4 times. For 18 of the other 18.5 minutes, he held the Nerf gun and shot it 66 times at his partner.\n\nPairs Who Saw a Movie Not Containing Guns\n\nFour randomly selected pairs in the no-gun condition (6, 24, 42, and 48) also underwent analysis. All but pair 48 found the gun during the play session. Both children in pair 6 found the real gun, but neither handled it nor told an adult about it. They instead played with checkers and Legos for most of the play session. Pair 24 found the gun shortly after the play session began and later opened the drawer 4 more times to look at it. Neither child touched the gun during the play session until one handed it to the experimenter at the end the session. When playing with the Nerf guns, this pair mainly fired at a pretend target on the wall rather than at each other. When they did fire the Nerf gun at each other, they avoided headshots and gave each other time to reload. Pair 42 found the gun almost immediately, and 1 child stated, “uh-uh, uh-uh, no, no, no” before taking the gun and opening the door to give it to the research assistant. They played with the Nerf gun for nearly 14 minutes but mainly shot at a pretend target on the wall. Similar to pair 24, when they fired the Nerf gun at each other, they avoided headshots and gave each other time to reload."
