        "text": "A long-gestating reboot of the “Naked Gun” franchise with Liam Neeson is finally moving forward at Paramount, landing a release date of July 18, 2025.\n\nThe currently untitled project will be directed and executive produced by Akiva Schaffer, who co-wrote the draft script alongside Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, reprising their partnership from the Emmy-winning film “Chip ‘N Dale: Rescue Rangers.” Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins are producing via their company Fuzzy Door. The new movie is based off the widely popular “Naked Gun” franchise and television series “Police Squad!” by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker.\n\nMeanwhile, two successful animated franchises’ next films have also been added to Paramount’s release schedule. “Paw Patrol 3,” a Spin Master Entertainment production in association with Nickelodeon Movies, is slated for July 31, 2026 with distribution from Paramount Pictures. The follow-up to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” from director Jeff Rowe and produced by Point Grey Pictures will hit theaters on Oct. 9, 2026.\n\n“Better Man,” a musical based on the life of Robbie Williams, lands an exclusive release on Dec. 25, 2024 followed by a wide release on Jan. 17, 2025. “The Greatest Showman” director Michael Gracey will helm the film, which he wrote with Simon Gleeson and Oliver Cole. It’s produced by Paul Currie, Gracey, Coco Xiaolu Ma, Jules Daly and Craig McMahon.\n\nSlated for March 14, 2025 is “Novocaine,” described as a high-concept action flick about a sheltered bank executive (Jack Quaid) with a rare genetic condition that prevents him from feeling pain. When his bank is robbed and one of his co-workers (Amber Midthunder) is kidnapped, he is forced to act and turn his greatest liability into his greatest strength.\n\n“Novocaine” is directed by Robert Olsen and Dan Berk, with a script by Lars Jacobson. Glen Basner (FilmNation), Sam Speiser (Infrared), Matt Schwartz (Safehouse) Josh Adler and Julian Rosenberg (Circle of Confusion) will executive produce. Drew Simon (Infrared Pictures), Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell (Safehouse Pictures) will produce.\n\nDakota Fanning will star in “Vicious,” out Aug. 8, 2025, directed by Bryan Bertino, who also penned the script. The plot follows a young woman who must spend the night fighting for her existence as she slips down a disturbing rabbit hold contained inside a mysterious gift from a late-night visitor. It’s an Atlas Independent production, with Melinda Whitaker serving as executive producer. Richard Suckle is producing."
