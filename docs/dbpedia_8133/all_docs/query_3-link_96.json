        "text": "Little SEX/NUDITY 4\n\n– A woman flirts with a shirtless man who enters her apartment, writhing to background music, ripping off his T-shirt, and doing pelvic thrusts; we see the man with his back to the camera from the hips up as he pulls off breakaway pants (we see the outline of his buttocks in tight underwear and his upper thighs briefly) and the woman rubs his bare abdomen and he pulls back when he sees a 13-year-old girl with her and he leaves. Male and female shoes and clothing are strewn through a hallway and we see a shirtless man (his bare chest, back and abdomen are seen) in a kitchen and a woman wearing long pajamas in bed, suggesting they spent the night together.\n\n► A man and a woman dance by a hallway elevator and a woman comes out of an apartment, saying, “Do you have to do your sexy things in front of my daughter?”; the other woman jokes that the little girl is transitioning from a boy. A man enters a bedroom where a woman lies in bed wearing a nightgown that reveals bare legs to the mid-thighs, and they embrace but there is no sexual activity. A man kisses a woman on the cheek and she kisses him on the lips briefly. A teen girl hugs a man for too long and he pulls away, startled. A teen girl lies on top of a restaurant’s bar, and sings and twerks a couple of times, while a woman rubs the head of a bald man sitting at a table.\n\n► A teen girl flirts with a male teacher, staring and smiling as she calls him “Mr. Hard to Get”; he tells her he is an adult and not available to her. A teen girl, a woman and a man all stare at a male teacher wistfully. A woman tells an attractive man that she is a member of the Christian Mingle dating site. A man says that he believes his girlfriend has been hiding the fact that she has a child, but he wants to be a father. A clothed teen girl, who was once an adult, looks into a mirror and asks, “Where are my perfect teardrop boobs I paid for?”\n\n► A few teen girls wear miniskirts. Half a dozen women wear V-necked tops that reveal cleavage. A woman reveals substantial cleavage and bare legs. A woman wears an off-the-shoulder dress that bares one shoulder and significant cleavage. A woman wears short shorts that bare her legs to the upper thighs. A few men wear knee-length shorts.\n\nLittle VIOLENCE/GORE 3\n\n- A teen girl on a stage swings a large ball on a cable in an auditorium and it comes back close to her face but does not touch her; another girl grabs the ball and swings it into the first girl, knocking her into a pile of boxes and the scene cuts to a close-up of the victim in a wheelchair in a neck brace and a long cast on the right arm and she says that she is going to grow up and bully people before they can bully her. A woman pushes a young boy out of her way and off-screen. A teen girl pushes a boy and he knocks her down, but she is unhurt. A girl dancing on a stage accidentally hits a dancing boy in the crotch and he grunts and doubles over briefly. A woman knocks down a man accidentally and they both smile. In a fight outside a school, a woman slaps the clothed buttocks of a 13-year-old girl who kicks the woman in the buttocks; the woman grabs the girl and spanks her several times while a guard watches and mutters, \"Black mama\"; the woman calls out, \"Spank your children!\" A teen girl sends large amounts of torn paper into another girl's face on the top of risers on a stage and the second girl falls and rolls down the risers to the stage, but is unhurt. A teen girl tosses a bucketful of soapy water into the face of a man who falls off-screen. A woman takes an apple away from an employee and throws it over a balcony (no harm is done) and then hits a woman in the head with a partially closed fist and the woman yelps. A woman grabs the swivel chair of another woman and pushes her into a wall, making her slide off the chair. A woman and a teen girl shout and throw a couple of donuts at each other, but miss. A woman says to a man, \"I'm gonna body slam you\" (she does not do so).\n\n► A woman mocks and shouts at her staff and colleagues in a few meetings, and at her apartment's building valet. A woman's employees run when they see her arrive in a few scenes. A woman says about another woman, \"When people don't eat carbs, they see Satan.\" A teen girl lies on top of a restaurant's bar and sings (please see the Sex/Nudity category for more details), a woman shouts at her, and then sings among the tables, where the girl accidentally pulls off a man's toupee.\n\n► A young girl waves a wand at a woman saying, \"I wish you were little,\" and the woman blinks and staggers, waking up the next morning as a 13-year-old. A young girl waves a wand and a 13-year-old girl awakens in the morning as an adult. A children's services worker forces a woman turned into a 13-year-old to attend junior high. Many girls and boys at a junior high school mock and shout at a teen girl because she has a large Afro hairstyle, at a stuttering boy, a shy girl and a shy boy in half a dozen scenes. A boy dumps his lunchtime trash on a table in front of a shy boy in a school cafeteria for the shy boy to clean up. Teens stuff soda straws into a girl's hair and laugh.\n\n► A woman drives a large sports car erratically and other cars screech their tires as they dodge her in a few scenes. A 13-year-old drives a car erratically and other cars dodge.\n\n► A woman brushes her teeth, bent over her bathroom basin and we hear but do not see spit."
