        "text": "In Water Governance case studies, Netherlands is a quintessential coo in good that is in abundance. Too much water that threatens to inundate all the time. The social dilemmas have gone on for over a millennium where people used to use artificial hills or retreat to deal with too much water before 800 CE. But population, technology and wealth have introduced more and more structures such as dikes since about 800 CE. But these are common goods which required community actions. Communities managed water till about 1100 CE. As the scale of floods and hydraulic structures grew, public governance bodies emerged. Portions below sea level are a significant fraction. Centralisation of water governance with a water ministry evolved. Urbanisation and the deadly flood of 1953 increased the focus on flood risk reduction. Rules and norms have been altered over the decades to manage water, development and protecting peatlands, etc. Many acts to protect land use have been established. Community attributes between Arizona and the Netherlands are very different and the water management approaches are very different as well. Next up is water distribution as an aspect of water governance. #sustainability #sustainingthecommons #tragedyofthecommons #climate #climatechange #climatesolutions #climateaction #water #adaptation https://lnkd.in/dEwBfbUZ\n\nA global and American Ground Water Crisis - Most Americans don't know what they don't know about the importance of ground water. Note the following from this paper: \"Roughly half the world’s people, including about 145 million Americans, get their drinking water from groundwater. \" And then go look up the Ogallala Aquifer- not even mentioned in this paper - and it's importance to American agriculture in the Plains from Colorado to Nebraska to the Dakotas. The depletion of ground water in the Ogallala Aquifer is a real crisis for America. #cre #ccim #sior #naiop #uli #trepp #groundwater #ogallalaaquifer #agriculturalland https://lnkd.in/gMFzHsu5"
