The CIA (originally the OSS) and the U.S. military, along with the Vatican, were instrumental in exfiltrating war crimi- nals not just to Latin America, but to the United States as well. As the Reagan administration attempts to rewrite history, it is worthwhile to examine carefully the wartime and postwar machinations of the extreme Right. The President goes to Bit- burg claiming it is time to forgive and forget, when in reality he is merely cutting a crude political deal with the reactionary West German government for its approval of Star Wars by giv- ing his absolution to the SS. Harboring War Criminals As we demonstrate in the pages of this issue, war criminals like Josef Mengele, Walter Rauff, and Klaus Barbie did not simply vanish at the end of the war or gracefully retire. Most of them spent several years in the direct employ of the U.S. intel- ligence agencies and, when necessary, were set up in business in Latin America or the U.S. The Kameradenwerk-the Nazi old boy network-remained active over the years, vigorous enough to have planned and carried out the 1980 coup in Bolivia, for example, and to have held high places in Pinochet's government in Chile. And they are major figures in the international arms and drug trades as well-traffic which the U.S. tries to blame on the socialist countries. Hundreds of Nazis have been set up in scientific institutions in this country. Ironically, it now appears that Star Wars is merely an extension of the Nazis' wartime rocket research. Much of the U.S. space program was designed by them. When the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations learn- ed that the scientist responsible for the Apollo-1 I moon trip, Arthur L.H. Rudolph, was a war criminal who exploited slave laborers to their deaths in his Nazi rocket factory, he was al- lowed to depart the U.S. voluntarily with no prosecution and no public announcement until he was safely hack in West Ger- many. Rudolph was only one of thousands of fascist scientists, doc- tors, technicians, and, above all, intelligence operatives, as- Table of Contents Editorial 2 Nazi Doctors in U.S. 26 Allen Dulles and the SS By Peter Dale Scott 4 Knights of Malta Examined By Francoise Hervet 27 Klaus Barbie's Bolivian Coup By Kai Hermann 15 The Greek Civil War By Eleni Fourtouni 39 A Sophisticated Torture By Robert Cohen 21 The Real Eleni By Nikos Raptis 41 The Real Treason By William Preston, Jr. 23 Supplying the Contras By Fred Clarkson 56 Interview With Nuremberg Lawyer 24 About the Cover: Left photo: Greek women hanged at Volos, 1943, by Nazi occupiers and their Greek fascist collaborators.

Only slowly, and with painstak- ing research, does the information surface. All of the most ghoulish scientific experimentation by the Axis medical establishment was eagerly gathered up by the U.S. What carne of it, and of its practitioners, is a matter of speculation, though we do know that the CIA's mind control programs like MKULTRA, torture training through their Of- fice of Public Safety, and massive research in and use of chem- ical and biological warfare (begun in Operation NKNAOMI) were the backbone of CIA and Pentagon covert activities over the last 40 years. Torture, crude and sophisticated, was ex- ported to client states in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and else- where, and CBW was directly employed against Vietnam, Cuba, and it appears, now, Nicaragua. Recent events indicate that the doors of the Georgetown car barn (where OPS trained torturers from foreign police forces until 1974, when the pro- gram was banned by Congress) are being opened again. In the 1985 foreign aid bill the current Congress lifted the ban on such training at a time when, for example, death squad mur- ders in El Salvador have doubled this year. Torture, the policy of so many American allies, is getting better press under Reagan. Newsweek magazine of June 7, 1982 kicked off the campaign, carrying a column entitled The Case for Torture,\" by CCNY philosophy professor Michael Levin, who argued that torture is \"not merely permis- sible, but morally mandatory\" to save lives threatened by ter- rorists. And on November 13, 1985, the New York Times re- ported that \"liberal\" Senator Patrick J. Leahy (Dem.-Vt.) con- fessed to an audience that he did not care for lie detectors. \"I personally like thumbscrews. They work far, far better.\" The Knights of Malta For nine hundred years the Knights of Malta have built up a military and intelligence organization designed to protect the established order and the privileges of the ruling classes throughout the world, yet most people arc unaware of their existence. Little is known of their role in the Third Reich or, along with the Vatican and the CIA, in the protection of Nazis after the War, or today in the wars in Central America. The ar- ticle in this issue begins what must be a long and complicated analysis of this organization and others like it. Eleni and the Greek Civil War There is no better example 01' the power of disinformation than the hoopla which surrounded Nicholas Gage's hook, / :Irni (a cover story in the New York Times Maga=inr last spring) and the recent movie based on it. First the Nazis, then the British, and then the Americans-each with their fascist Greek col- laborators-were responsible from the 1940s through the 1970s for the brutal deaths of tens of thousands of Greeks, de- cimating the ranks of the progressive forces. Yet Gage would have us believe that it was the communists'Aho were evil and the fascists who were good. We hope the analyses presented here help rectify the 40-year-old lie Gagc has resurrected. The World Anti-Communist Leage While General John K. Singlaub makes the rounds of televi- sion talk shows touting the Nicaraguan rontra.% and hoping WACL's mercenary adventures in Central America, the ori- gins of his group are pointedly ignored. Many of the WACL's leaders have deep ties not merely to Rev. Moon's nryrmidons but also to Nazis and Nazi collaborators, who hobnob with high administration figures. The Overt Covert Wars Friends jokingly advise us to change our name. Covert ac- tion has become so overt as to make the term an anachronism. The President, having manipulated Congress into repealing the Clark Amendment, has now gone over their heads by Execu- tive Order to fund a covert war against the government of An- gola. As with Nicaragua, debate over this \"secret\" war will he finessed by shifting the focus of discussion from its legality or morality to its level of financing.

Number 25 (Winter 1986) Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 How Allen Dulles and the SS Preserved Each Other By Peter Dale Scott * Dr. Josef Mengele, the \"Angel of Death,\" the experimenter and executioner of the German concentration camp at Au- schwitz, is perhaps the most notorious of all the unconvicted Nazi war criminals. The exhumation in early 1985 in Brazil of a body which international forensic experts subsequently judged to be that of Mengele has momentarily quieted the de- mands that he be found and brought to trial. The supporting evidence and testimony was persuasive enough to silence many initial skeptics. Nevertheless other wanted Nazi criminals have been erroneously but persuasively reported dead. Adolf Eichmann, for example, had been declared dead in Austria in 1947, \"on the testimony of one Karl Lukas, who swore that he had been present when Eichmann died in Prague on April 28, This photograph was used by Josef Mengele in 1956 when he applied for an identity card in Argentina in his own name. It is the most recent authenticated photograph of the \"Angel of Death\" of Auschwitz. * Peter Dale Scott, a former Canadian diplomat with a Ph.D. in political sci- ence, and Professor of English at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of The War Conspiracy: The Secret Road to the Second Indochina War (Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs-Merrill, 1972), The Assassinations, Dallas and Beyond: A Guide to Cover-Ups and Investigations (New York: Vintage, 1976), and Crime and Cover-Up (Berkeley: Westworks, 1977). This article is from a larger work in progress. 4 CovertAction 1945.\"' And when in the same year a doctor wrote that she wished to testify against Mengele, the response of Telford Taylor, U.S. Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg, was \"to advise our records show Dr. Mengerle [sic] is dead as of October 1946.\"' (At the time of General Taylor's letter, U.S. Army Counterintelligence knew both of Mengele's survi- val and even his location, in the small Bavarian village of Au- tenried.') Four years before the emergence of the latest Mengele death report, a biography of Martin Bormann noted how the issuance of false death reports, substantiated in some cases by the plant- ing of skeletons, was the standard modus operandi of the post- war Kameradenwerk in South America to which Mengele, and allegedly Bormann, belonged.' Indeed the very abundance of such skeletons was enough, not only to weaken their credibil- ity, but to confirm that a powerful and ruthless organization was protecting the wanted criminals. In the case of Bormann himself, The [Israeli intelligence organization] Mossad was to point out that they have been witnesses over the years to the exhu- mation of six skeletons, two in Berlin and four in South America, purported to be that of Martin Bormann.` It is worth recalling that Mengele was reported dead in 1968, after the search for him had been fueled by revelations in the Eichmann trial. Then as now the major source for the report was a respected Brazilian policeman (Erich Erdstein in 1968) who \"specialized in narcotics smugglers.\"\" Erdstein sub- sequently published a vivid eyewitness account of Mengele's brief capture, release, subsequent recapture, and death by gun- fire on a barge at his own hands. When a respected Brazilian policeman with a record of im- portant narcotics arrests describes Mengele's death in vivid de- tail, it is hard to disbelieve him. But after a second respected Brazilian policeman with a similar record has supplied a differ- ent, wholly incompatible account of Mengele's death, then the credibility of such sources has to be reassessed. Even if the second report proves to be correct, the earlier report remains as evidence that a well-organized conspiracy existed to protect Mengele, like Bormann, with disinformation. 1.

To begin to understand it, one must be prepared to disbelieve authorities that would nor- mally be credible, and to explore alternative hypotheses that would normally be dismissed as sheer paranoid fantasy and de- lusion. The Mengele Kameraden and U.S. Intelligence By July 1945 Josef Mengele had been captured and iden- tified at an allied prisoner-of-war camp. Forty years later an eyewitness told a congressional committee how guards knew Mengele's name, and also the general nature of his crimes as doctor, experimenter, and executioner at Auschwitz.' Also in 1985 the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles released documents obtained from the U.S. Army under the Freedom of Information Act, according to which Mengele \"may have been arrested by U.S. authorities in Austria in 1947 and sub- sequently released.\"Yet like so many of his fellow members of the SS, the bureaucrats of death in the Nazi behemoth, Mengele was somehow allowed to disappear, to reemerge ten years later in Latin America. Twenty years ago only a few would have believed that the victorious allies in the so-called \"good war\" could have delib- erately allowed a sadistic mass murderer like Josef Mengele to go free. From the revelations since the Eichmann trial, how- ever, it has become only too obvious that the OSS, the wartime precursor of today's CIA, arranged for numbers of wanted criminals to \"escape\" from camps, and when necessary sup- plied them with new identities to protect them from justice. Murderers, far from being exempted from such protection, seem to have been among those most likely to obtain it. This is particularly true of those Schur:staf/e'! (SS: elite guard) veterans whose careers have been most closely linked to The \"Butcher of Lyon\" in the plaza of La Paz. 7. Washington Post, Fchruary 15, 1985, p. A4. 8. The Nation, March 2. 1985, p. 231: Number 25 (Winter 1986) Walter Rauff, inventor of the portable gas chamber. After the war, Rauff worked for the Gehlen Org and later in Chile for Pinochet as torture expert. Mengele's in Latin America: Klaus Barbie, the butcher of Lyon, in Bolivia; Walter Rauff, supervisor of the SS mobile gas chambers, in Chile; and Friederich Schwend, yet another wanted murderer, in Peru. Like Mengele, all three of these men developed links with neo-fascist elements in the military or interior ministries of their new countries, or both. All col- laborated in repressive operations against the Lcft, particularly at the time of the CIA-assisted overthrow of the Allende gov- ernment in Chile. Barbie and Schwend, at least, have acted in this capacity through arms deals with the German firm Merex AG, a proprietary firm of the German l3ntlclc.~tuu hrirhtr/ien,ct (BND: federal intelligence service), itself a descendant of the Gehlen intelligence network which in 1945 passed from the leadership of the Nazi SS to that of American intelligence, and eventually the CIA. We shall see that after World War 11, while the CIA and the Gehlen Organization (usually referred to as the \"Gehlen Org\") were being slowly organized on the U.S. payroll, both Barbie and Schwend worked for U.S. Army Counterintelligence (CIC); and at this time Schwend was working on setting up the secret SS escape routes to Latin America by which both men would eventually reestablish themselves. It has been charged that Rauff played an even more prominent role in setting up the CovertAction 5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 The ubiquitous Reinhard Gehlen served Hitler, Dulles, and Adenauer in succession. escape route, while also on the U.S. payroll, and that he did so with an immunity granted to him by Allen Dulles of the OSS, after the SS-OSS secret (and sometimes unauthorized) negotia- tions in north Italy in which, unquestionably, both Dulles and Rauff participated. The primary purpose of these secret talks was to secure a separate Nazi and fascist surrender in north Italy, and at least partly to prevent a de facto seizure of power by Italian com- munist partisans behind the Nazi lines. But even the intense fixation which the OSS and the SS shared about reducing the inevitable communist role in postwar Europe does not appear to diplomatic historians to explain the zealous intensity with which Dulles, at times in direct contravention of written or- ders, pursued negotiations for a surrender which in fact pre- ceded that of V-E Day by just six days. We shall study the same excessive zeal with which future CIA personnel protected the convicted war criminal Barbie and concealed him from the French authorities who knew very well that U.S. intelligence was hiding him from them. A recent U.S. Justice Department report on the U.S. handling of the Barbie case is clearly an essay in damage limitation, designed to blame low-level people in U.S. Army Counterintelligence while suppressing the rather obvious connections to the Gehlen Org and its then employers, the CIA. The role of Schwend (and almost certainly Rauft) in exfiltrating whole cadres of wanted SS criminals, while on the U.S. payroll, only confirms recent speculations that the SS networks were being preserved for postwar anticommunist activities, as the result of an ar- rangement negotiated with Dulles and his OSS superiors. 6 CovertAction Such an OSS-SS deal does not appear to have been approved at the time at any higher level. Indeed as late as December 1945 the U.S. War Department refused U.S. intelligence offi- cers permission to collaborate with even the Gehlen Organiza- tion, whose prewar origins lay not in the Nazi SS but the even- tually decapitated Abwehr or German military intelligence.\" More importantly, Roosevelt had already tabled, as too contro- versial, the memo from OSS chief William J. Donovan (which Dulles had drafted), for converting the wartime OSS into a per- manent CIA. \"' In dealing with the SS, Dulles and Donovan knew that this risky operation could easily backfire against the OSS, whose organizational future had already been challenged by J. Edgar Hoover and traditionalists in U.S. military intelligence. But they also knew that, just as the OSS was the best hope for the survival of the SS cadres, so in a sense these cadres were their highest trump card in the impending contest for the OSS's own institutional survival. What ultimately persuaded Truman in 1947 to authorize an operational CIA was in fact partly the need to find an institutional home for the postwar Gehlen Org. In 1948 Dulles, by now a civilian, helped write the memo per- suading Truman to take on the Gehlen Org, on Gehlen's own terms. One of these was that Gehlen could continue to work Allen Welsh Dulles, mastermind of Operation Sunshine, brought Nazis into U.S. spy service. 9. Tom Bower.

Such a hypothesis would once have been almost unthinkable. But we have since been told that his colleague in the Auschwitz human experiments, Walter Schreiber, was shielded by the Americans from a Polish conviction in absentia, so that he could help guide the postwar researches of the U.S. Air Force in bacteriological warfare. In 1952, Schreiber was helped by American officials to reestablish himself, via Argentina, in Paraguay.' That is the year that Mengele himself appeared in Argentina, moving to Paraguay two years later. In 1981 the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists revealed that Mengele's equivalent in Japan, Dr. Shiro Ishii, as well as his assistants, had been granted immunity by the United States in exchange for exclusive access to their researches in chemical and bacteriological warfare. This despite the fact that Ameri- cans had been among the more than 3,000 prisoners of war and civilians killed in the course of their treatment as human guinea pigs. A Soviet war crimes trial in 1949, based on these experi- ments, was denounced at the time by the United States as a simple exercise in propaganda.\" That Mengele's escape and immunity were arranged by the United States, like those of Schreiber and so many others, will seem more probable once we have studied the incredible post- war careers of Barbie, Schwend, and Rauff. But before doing so we must glance forward to the ways in which Mengele's postwar career has overlapped with those of these other SS murderers, whom we now know to have benefited from U.S. protection. Mengele and the Kameradenwerk Despite the hooks, articles, and TV programs about Mengele, the \"Angel of Death\" at Auschwitz, less is known for certain about his postwar activities than those of any com- parable war criminal.\" Apart from his extended residence in Paraguay, where he gained citizenship in 1957 and was stripped of it in 1979, little has been documented. But in one of the best hooks to appear about the postwar network of Rauff, Schwend, and Mengele, the so-called Kaineradennve rk, the career of Mengele is closely implicated. The hook is The Bormann Brotherhood by William Steven- son, himself a wartime intelligence operative with access to in- telligence sources, including the records of Donovan and their mutual friend, Sir William Stephenson of the British SOE. Ac- cording to Stevenson, Mengele had worked in a restricted mili- tary zone of Paraguay with the wartime Croatian dictator Ante Pavelic, whose Croatian Catholic connections undoubtedly (as we shall see) played central roles in the escapes of Rauff, I I Cookridge, op. cit., n. 10, p. 135: Thomas Powers, The Matt Who Kept the Secrets: Ruharel //elms and Ili,, CIA (New York: Knopf, 1479), pp. 24, 3. 12.

In the early 1960s Barbie did in fact set up a company called Estrella, ostensibly dealing in quin- quina bark. Although no records exist in the public registry in La Paz, at least one Bolivian arms dealer still remembers it as a weapons trading company.\" It appears that Barbie and Estrella did export quinquina bark as agents for the German drug firm Boehringer, which grew rich on quinine contracts to the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.\" But the primary business of Barbie and Schwend was arms trafficking, carried on through two German-based firms, Merex and Gemetex. The two Nazis acted as agents, negotiating pur- chases not only on behalf of the Bolivian and Peruvian gov- ernments but, through their friendship with the Nazi Hans Rudel, sales to Paraguay and Chile and, through Otto Skor- zeny in Spain, further deals in Madrid.\" Merex AG, itself set up in 1963, was an arms company owned and controlled by the Gehlen BND, while Skorzeny was one of the top go-betweens in the postwar deals between Gehlen, the SS, and the CIA.\" Barbie's arms deals, concerted in this way with western in- telligence, were politically influential as well as economically lucrative. They involved him, according to French sources, in the drug trafficking business of Auguste Joseph Ricord, a Cor- sican Nazi collaborator who like Mengele was established with high-level connections in Paraguay. It was apparently the Nixon administration's determination to break the Ricord ring which first made the CIA begin reporting on Mengele's own involvement in the drug traffic. The U.S. Protection of Klaus Barbie Like his fellow-escapee Klaus Barbie in Bolivia, Mengele was an old man who began to lose some of his political immun- ity in Latin America. But the well-placed networks which over the years enabled him to cross frontiers without detection arc still in place, still politically influential throughout the conti- nent. It remains important to understand that network more clearly in order to neutralize as far as possible its evident sup- port in Washington itself. A brief glance at the postwar career of Klaus Barbie shows how relatively small a role in his prosperity was played by postwar Nazi cabals such as the well publicized ODESSA or \"Die Spinne.\" Condemned to death by the French for genoci- dal murders in Lyon, Barbie was concealed and protected for 20 Stevenson. op. cit., n. 15, p. 276. 21 Magnus Linklatcr, et al..

S. Army's Counter Intelli- gence Corps (CIC), which was using him as an informant to spy on-ironically-the French.\" After the Communists were dropped from General De Gaulle's cabinet, the Nazi Barbie was reassigned to spy on the \"America Houses\" set up by the U.S. State Department, which were, according to Barbie's American handler, \"stocked with all kinds of leftwing litera- ture. Barbie's reports may thus have helped fuel the attack on this program five years later by Joe McCarthy, whose charges against the State Department were based on documents leaked to him by a source in Army Intelligence.\" As a mere policeman and persecutor of Jews, Barbie was not a candidate for the headquarters staff of the revamped Gehlen Organization, which was being transformed with CIA money and oversight into West Germany's postwar intelligence agency, the BND. Barbie's future would thus be less comforta- ble than that of his fellow CIC informant Emil Augsburg, who had worked directly under Eichmann on the SS \"final solution to the Jewish problem.\" Despite postwar stories that Augsburg had been saved from punishment by ODESSA and the Vatican, we now know that Augsburg went \"at once\" from Barbie's CIC unit into the Gehlen Org, to staff the offensive \"Special Forces\" against the Soviet Union being promoted by the CIA's Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner.\" Augsburg was teamed with Dr. Franz Alfred Six, whose twenty-six-year sentence for or- dering the executions of hundreds of Jews at Smolensk was commuted to time served by John J. McCloy. the U.S. High Commissioner of Germany (HICOG).'\" Barbie's Escape and the Ryan Cover-Up But HICOG was eventually unable to stall the more and more strident French demands for delivery of Barbie as a con- victed war criminal.\"' In 1951 the CIC provided Barbie with a package of false documents, funds, and references for his new identity, as \"Klaus Altmann,\" and sent him to Genoa down an underground railway, the infamous \"Rat Line,\" which the Austrian CIC had been operating for tour years.\" Barbie was received in Genoa by the Croatian priest Dr. Krunoslav Draganovic, an adviser to the wartime Croatian dic- tatorship of Ante Pavelic. Draganovic was an admitted mem- ber of the wartime Ustase terrorist organization which Pavelic had used to carry out a genocidal extermination of the Or- thodox Serbs in his puppet Catholic dictatorship. Through his Vatican and Latin American connections, Draganovic had ex- filtrated a number of wanted Ustase war criminals, including 25.

Ryan treats the U.S. Army's exfiltration of Bar- hie, handled at the time as a high-priority intelligence matter, as the solution to a disposal problem, a means of making a po- tential embarrassment vanish.\" Ryan's report is critical of CIC's decisions and gross lies in this period, but manages, with a skill that perhaps only lawyers are capable of, to excul- pate the cover-up in other branches of the U.S. government, as the innocent transmittal of CIC's misrepresentations. Ryan is particularly concerned to dispel the impression, which he ad- mits was shared by several of Barbie's CIC handlers, that the C'IC ever had any interest in Barbie. Ryan's documentation, however, shows evidence of a con- scious, coordinated cover-up of the Barbie case, at a much higher level of the U.S. government than the benighted CIC. Ryan himself notes instances when senior officials in HICOG, in internal memos, contradicted their own assurances of an ac- tive search for Barbie (p. I 23n): and revealed the existence of what he calls \"unofficial information\" or hack channels refut- ing their assurances (p. 1O1). Even more striking is the wide- spread bureaucratic hahit, at high levels of EUCOM (the U.S. military command in Europe), HICOG, and the Paris U.S. Embassy. of translating statements from the press or internal memos about \"Barbie\" into misleading inter-agency com- munications about a non-existent \"Barbier.\"\" Observers of the FBI and CIA will recognize this behavior, which can be used to withhold files about \"Barbier\" when pressed under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose files on Barbie.\" Ryan further notes the disappearance of many documents, including all those in the Barbie file at the time of his exfiltra- tion, before the file was microfilmed several weeks later (p. 149). This does not deter him from the lawyerly conclusion (p. 158) that Barbie did not have a relationship with any other U.S. government agency at this time, on the ground that There is no evidence in Barbie's CIC dossier that he worked at any time for any agency other than CIC.

The weakness in this logic is also apparent at the words ''any agency,\" where he ought to have written ''any U.S. agency.\" Ryan's report, here and throughout. significantly fails to ad- dress the possibility that the U.S. was reestablishing Barbie Altmann in Latin America as a future asset of thc rapidly grow- ing Gehlen Org, then still funded entirely by the united States.

Apart from CIA, there is no other agency, with the possible exception of the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) Ithe earliest name of the CIA component authorized to carry out covert activities], that would have had any connection with Barbie's activities. This investigation has yielded no hint or suggestion, let alone evidence however fragmentary, that OPC had any knowledge of or involvement with Klaus Bar- bie, the Merk net, or other activities described in this report. In evaluating this statement, we have to remember that OPC, under its aggressive chief Frank Wisner, was funding and recruiting for the Gehlen Org. That the CIC's Merk net of which Barbie was part had established contact with the Gehlen Org, which had tried to recruit Kurt Merk as its chief of coun- terintelligence operations. \"' That by March 1948 C'IC had es- tablished liaison with the CIA in Europe, because of the latter's interest in the Merk net.\" (This was three months before the creation of OPC in June 1948, but the interest of Dulles and Wisner in Gehlen went hack to 1945.)\" That Emil Augsburg, 36.

Also that CIC is taking current action in behalf of another Uncle Sugar agency.\"' Ryan's studied avoidance of the possibility that Barbie was detached to the Gehlen Org is the more eloquent when we re- call that this charge was made in detailed fashion by William Stevenson in The Bormann Brotherhood, by far the most au- thoritative treatment of the Barbie case in any American book before the Ryan report: Klaus Barbie . . . was a man adroit enough to get on the American payroll of the West German intelligence agency when it was run by General Gehlen. . . . Killers had es- caped by selling their talents to the intelligence agencies of East and West. Klaus Barbie had worked for an import-ex- port agency at Schillestrasse [sic] 38, in Augsburg. Such fronts are the favored fronts of spy rings. This one had been operated by the Gehlen Org.\" Ryan's documents confirm that in 1947 Barbie was working at 38 Schillerstrasse, Kempten (rather than Augsburg). Ryan notes that a search for him there two years later \"proved fruit- less.\" Ryan later translates this predictable fruitlessness of the belated inquiry into the undocumented statement that \"Barbie had never been 'on Schillerstrasse' \" (p. 114n). This is not a persuasive rebuttal of Stevenson's claim. Finally one can hardly ignore the fact that the protection and exfiltration of Barbie were handled, at the top and at the bot- tom of the U.S. hierarchy, by men with OSS/OPC/CIA con- 39.

George Neagoy, the Austrian CIC agent who secured Barbie's false documentation and would personally deliver him through Austria to Father Draganovic in Genoa, was himself about to enter the CIA.'\" At HICOG the preparation of mis- leading reassurances to the French was being handled by John Bross, a veteran of OSS paramilitary operations who in April 1951 would join the Eastern Europe Division of OPC (working closely with the Gehlen Org).\" A resolution of what \"other agency\" picked up Barbie in 1951 would be of great help in understanding the postwar care- er of Josef Mengele. For there is no doubt at all that in Latin America, Barbie became part of an international intelligence network working directly with proprietaries of Gehlen's BND, and little doubt that Mengele was intimately connected to this network also. The Barbie Kameradenwerk in Latin America The unlikely possibility implied by Ryan, that Barbie with his store of embarrassing secrets was left to start a new future on his own, has been refuted by Barbie himself. Though Ryan asserts that Barbie was the only Nazi to be exfiltrated by CIC down the Rat Line, Barbie himself recalls that the other occup- ants of his Genoa hotel \"were all Nazi fugitives-among them Eichmann himself. \"\"4 According to Barbie, Draganovic told him his reasons were purely humanitarian. He helped both Catholics and Protestants, but mostly they were SS officers, about two hundred in all. Anti-communists. He said to me, 'We've got to keep a sort of reserve on which we can draw in the fu- ture.' I think that was the Vatican's motive as well.\" Indeed the Vatican did have a program underway for the ex- filtration of anti-communists. This was the work of Bishop Alois Hudal of the Collegium Teutonicum, a priest close both to Pius XII and the future Paul VI as well as a public admirer of the Third Reich. After an interview in Rome with former Ges- tapo Chief Heinrich Muller, Hudal had begun the work of sup- plying Vatican documentation for such prominent fugitives as Muller, Eichmann, and perhaps Martin Bormann.?? It was Hudal who gave Father Draganovic the necessary introductions to the International Red Cross and other \"officials who, for a bribe, could smooth the fugitive's path. Between them, Hudal and Draganovic helped hundreds of Nazis to escape, and perhaps thousands of Croatian Ustase. Chief of these was the former Croatian dictator Ante Pavelic. According to William Stevenson, Pavelic had since withdrawn into an armed camp in Paraguay shared with German settlers in their restricted mili- tary zone northeast of Asunci6n. There he worked with Dr. Josef Mengele, the death camp experimenter, and [Walter] Rauff . . . who designed and built mass gassing chambers for Auschwitz.?\" 42. Ryan, op. cit., n. 32, p. 145. 43.

This network, the so-called Kameradenm'erk, has maintained close political, social, and business ties. By most accounts Josef Mengele was its leading representative in Paraguay.\" Operation Bernhard, Schwend, and the U.S. Army Two American books, by authors with wartime intelligence careers, have conditioned us to accept the debatable hypothesis that Martin Bormann, Hitler's Deputy and head of the Nazi Party bureaucracy, was the central organizing figure in this network.\"' On surer ground, they point to the role of the exten- sive postwar assets collected or plundered by the SS and Bor- mann. This came from three sources: the proceeds from the SS forgery of British pound notes (\"Operation Bernhard\"), the looting of Jews and other Nazi victims, and, most signific- antly, the corporate contributions to a special fund set up to guarantee the survival of German multinationals abroad after the impending collapse of Hitler.\" Soon after the war, OSS found the extensive documentation of a meeting in Strasbourg on August 10, 1944 to establish this fund, between representa- tives of the SS, Party, and firms like Krupp, I.G. Farben, and Messerschmidt. But as the Cold War encouraged the U.S. to see the German corporate presence in Latin America in a more friendly light, the role of these firms in providing new careers for war crimi- nals abroad was ignored. In fact, it was the key to the postwar status of the Kameraden. Otto Skorzeny (acquitted of his crim- inal charges by the intervention of western intelligence) be- came a sales representative of Krupp. Hans Ulrich Rudel (never charged, but an unrepentant Nazi ideologue in the post- war era) became a sales representative of Siemens. Walter Rauff (designer of the gas ovens at Auschwitz) found his first employment in Latin America with a subsidiary of I.G. Farben (an employer of slave labor at Auschwitz). Franz Paul Stang], chief of the Treblinka extermination camp, found postwar em- ployment in Latin America with Volkswagen, as did Eichmann with Mercedes-Benz. And so on.\" But U.S. intelligence may have played a more direct role in the exfiltration of Nazis with the proceeds of Operation Bern- hard, the SS forgery of British pound notes. Here again west- ern intelligence knew enough about Operation Bernhard to pro- tect the postwar pound, by the British government's timely issue of new notes and recall of the old. But by this time much of the SS profits, an estimated $300 million worth, had been converted to genuine currency. Most of this money has never been traced. The man in charge of laundering the forged banknotes was Friederich Schwend, who in 1945-1946, in north Italy, became 49. Ibid.. pp. 127-228. 276-279. 50. Farago. op. cit., n.

As recorded in Dulles's and other establishment accounts, Operation Sunrise con- cerned the surrender of German troops to Italy, to prevent the needless destruction of civilian property and help forestall a takeover of north Italy by the Communist partisans in the area.\" More recently revisionist historians have focused on the degree to which Dulles and Wolff, the principal negotiators, exceeded their authorization to negotiate and in so doing created a major political rift between Stalin and Churchill.\" Inasmuch as the armistice in north Italy only preceded that in the rest of Europe by one week, Operation Sunrise may have had less impact on the outcome of the war than on the survival of the cadres of the SS. One of the principal SS participants in the negotiations was Milan Gestapo Chief Walter Rauff, soon to be a fugitive through the Kameradenwerk:`'' According to Loftus, a promise by Dulles of amnesty for SS negotiators led him (Dulles) to exploit his connections at the Vatican to smuggle war criminals to South America. Rauff was set up one month after the armistice in Genoa, where, under cover of a Vatican-run refugee relief organization, he reportedly sent off some 5000 Gestapo and SS agents over a four-year period. Among them was Klaus Barbie.?' Dulles, Rauff, and the Genoa Escape Route On April 27, 1945, after being visited by Dulles's OSS agent Emilio Daddario in Milan, Rauff surrendered to Army CIC. According to recently declassified American intelligence documents seen by Loftus, He told Army CIC that he had made \"arrangements\" for his surrender in order to avoid further bloodshed in Milan\". . . . The arrangements could be confirmed \"by Hussman [sic-Max Husmann, a Swiss participant in Sunrise] and Mr. Dulles, allied agents in Switzerland. `2 surrender of the SS armies in Italy. He described [how he] went to Lugano in March 1945, to arrange the release of al- lied prisoners in Rauff's custody as a sign of good faith. In return for the surrender of all SS forces, Dulles promised that none of the negotiators would ever be prosecuted as war criminals.\"' Loftus then confirms the claim of Beata Klarsfeld that Rauff began to work for Dulles, and to exfiltrate Nazis through Cath- olic monasteries, while on the OSS payroll. Despite the [U.S.] Army interrogators' pleas that Rauff \"is considered a menace if ever set free, and failing actual elimi- nation, is recommended for life-long internment,\" Dulles kept his bargain and Rauff was released. According to usu- ally reliable intelligence sources, Dulles then employed Rauff on anti-communist operations in Italy, which was Rauff's specialty under the Nazis. Dulles asked the Vatican to continue his wartime arrangement of using Catholic monasteries and convents to hide OSS agents. After the war, Dulles explained, these safe houses were still needed to smuggle out anti-communist refugees. The Vatican's in- volvement with Dulles's program was minimal. The church provided food, shelter, and identity cards, as it did to all re- fugees. It was Dulles's contacts, not the Vatican, who han- dled the smuggling of Nazis. According to top secret State Department documents, the Italian police provided the false passports for allied agents; the visas came from the Argen- tine consulate in the allied intelligence unit based at Trieste; and the embarkation paperwork was handled by a U.S. State Department officer in Genoa. Genoa, incidentally, was Rauff's area of jurisdiction. All of them worked for Dulles, who set up the unwitting Vatican to he the scapegoat if it were ever discovered that Dulles's anti-communist refugees were really SS intelligence agents. To be sure, there were a few priests, and even one bishop, who smuggled a few of their own Nazi countrymen through Italy [this must allude to the Croatians], but that was at extremely low levels of the Vatican, and was quietly squelched after the exposure in the Italian press in 1948. The higher-level connection between the Vatican and Dulles is still classified by the government.\"' 58. R. Harris Smith, op. cit., n. 10, pp. 114-121. 59. Bradley F.

Loftus's charge of Dulles's amnesty and its consequences is remarkably at odds with Bradley Smith's contention that \"German and Italian Fascist prison- ers of war . . . received no special benefits from Sunrise'' (p. 185). Rauff was subsequently allowed to \"escape\" and reestablish himself with Vatican assist- ance, which would seem to corroborate Loftus rather than Smith. In his intro- duction, Smith notes how CIA officials were \"more than willing\" to release to him \"the only group of OSS field intelligence dispatches which has ever been declassified by the CIA\" (p. 4).

In his semi-authorized history of the OSS, R. Harris Smith notes that the leading Italian go-be- tween in the negotiations, the industrialist, baron, and Papal Chamberlain Luigi i'arrelli, was in 1948 63. Ibid. The reference is to a meeting of March 3. 1945 which in Allen Dul- les's memoir was with two SS representatives, Eugen Dollmann and Guido Zimmer. Loftus concludes \"that Dulles lied in his memoirs on one point: The SS colonel was Walter Rauff, not 'Dollmanlnl.' \" Dollmann's own autobiog- raphy is significantly unhelpful in resolving the issue. The hook ends early on that same morning at the Italian-Swiss crossing point to Lugano, with the Swiss go-between waving \"on the other side of the frontier.\" Citing an early Italian account of the \"pretentious\" hat he wore on that important day, Dollmann concludes enigmatically by saying, \"I cannot remember, but it is quite possible . . . Cur non' why not'?\" (Eugen Dollmann, The Interpreter: Memoirs (London: Hutchinson, 1967), pp. 345-346.) Dollmann clearly did play an important part in the early stages of Operation Sunrise. One year ear- lier he had helped negotiate the German evacuation of Rome which led to Wolff's first and only audience with the Pope (Dollmann, pp. 298-303). It seems possible however that on March 3 Dollmann did not accompany the SS party beyond the border; alternatively, that both Rauff and Dollmann accom- panied Zimmer to Lugano. 64. Ibid.

It was also rumored that he had concocted a plan to transport ex-Nazis from Ger- many to Paraguay.\"5 As a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), which issued its own diplomatic passports, Parrelli was a member of an international Catholic network well equipped to handle exfiltration. (See article on SMOM in this issue.) The leading Bavarian Knight of Malta, Baron Erwein von Aretin, was said to have arranged travel \"for no small number of ex-Nazis\" after the war.\"\" And Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI), the OSS contact at the Vatican, did indeed become the patron of Bishop Hudal's exfiltration efforts: Montini had under his supervision the Vatican bureau that issued the refugee travel documents and the Caritas Inter- nationalise the Church's international welfare organization, which was at this time (and for some years after the war) one of the main charitable institutions aiding the fugitive Nazis.\"' Like Parrelli, Montini was later deeply involved in the CIA's first major postwar covert operation, the efforts to block a communist victory in the 1948 Italian election. The Common Interests of the OSS and the SS We cannot in this article review the intricate contacts estab- lished throughout the war between the Nazis and the Papacy, the Papacy and the United States, and the U.S. and Ger- many.\" However, the common denominator in such infor- mal contacts became the postwar future of Europe, and possi- ble joint measures to exclude the Soviet Union from it. This was especially true after Churchill and Roosevelt had pro- claimed the policy of unconditional surrender at Casablanca, a policy which not only dismayed Allen Dulles but threatened the propriety of his continued contacts with members of the German opposition.\"\" Yet even after the failure of the July 1944 plot against Hitler, the OSS continued its increasingly questionable liaisons, now chiefly with representatives of SS leaders Himmler and Schellenberg. One motive for these contacts was clearly to limit the post- war influence in Western Europe of Soviet power, Communist resistance forces, and the civilian communist parties. Another however appears to have been to prevent the postwar breakup of German and U.S. intelligence assets, most particularly the 65. R. Harris Smith, op. cit.. n. 10, p. 114. 66.

In the last months of the war, Dulles's OSS network in Switzerland was enlarged to in- clude William J. Casey, today CIA Director and perhaps America's most fa- mous Knight of Malta, and Russell D'Oench, a cousin of the U.S. SMOM of ficer J. Peter Grace. D'Oench is said to have helped set up the CIA-Gehlen Org operation after the war, before retiring in 1949. Two of the highest honors bestowed by the Italian branch of SMOM were awarded in 1946 to James Ang- leton, who had not yet taken up his new responsibilities as chief of the Vatican desk of the CIA, and in 1948 to Reinhard Gehlen (Jonathan Marshall, \"Brief Notes on the Political Importance of Secret Societies.\" Parapolitics/U.SA 2.1, March I, 1983, Appendix, p. 18). 67.

It is interesting that Gehlen knew of Karl Wolf-i's contacts with Dulles as early as January 1945, the month in which they were initiated.\"' From this same period he began to consolidate his networks for survival after Hitler's downfall, which is to say he already expected to reach it modus i-iremli with the Americans.\" In April 1945, one month before the war ended, Dulles asked Frank Wisner to begin talks with Gehlen, who was not taken into U.S. custody until May 20.\" On the Gehlen side, a plan \"to gain contact with the Americans'' was ap- proved on April 4, and continued without interruption even after Hitler dismissed Gehlen on April 9. '' Curiously, the Operation Sunrise contacts between Wolff and Dulles became most intense in the second half of April 1945, even though at that time both Wolff and Dulles knew they had no authority to negotiate a surrender. On April 17 Wolff visited Berlin (where Gehlen and his headquarters were still located), to be told by Hitler personally that he should \"temporize in his talks with Dulles because it was still too early to consider it surrender, or even serious negotiation.

Accompanied for the first time by a German army representative (Col. von Schweinitz), Wolff came to Switzer- land counting on his \"personal reputation with the Anglo-Americans\" to ex- tract guarantees from Dulles that the \"idealistic\" and \"de- cent\" men of the army, party, and SS would be able to play \"an active part in the reconstruction. \"\" Dulles on his part misrepresented von Schweinitz's explicitly limited instructions as a \"full power\" to negotiate. Later, after Wolff had returned to Italy and found himself facing capture by Allied partisans, Dulles allowed an OSS team to participate (together with two SS men!) in the successful rescue and exfilt- ration of Wolff to Switzerland.\" The historian Bradley Smith calls this \"frenzied pursuit of Sunrise\" by Dulles \"a mere reflex action,\" and failure to realize that Allied victory was imminent in any case.\" In fact, Dulles and Donovan had to mislead their superiors, if their plans for the postwar use of the SS were to succeed. As R. Har- ris Smith, a former CIA officer, reports, dead-pan: Only Wolff's sudden and unexpected offer to sign an uncon- ditional surrender on April 22 convinced the State Depart- ment to reverse its earlier order and to allow SUNRISE to proceed.'\" But no such offer had been made by Wolff; it was merely an il- lusion from Dulles's unjustified commentaries, which \"ran roughshod over the minimal rules of caution and good sense. \"\"? The OSS policy of rescuing key fascist leaders appears, moreover, to have been systematic. The next day, on April 28, Dulles's aide Daddario risked his life in Milan to save the fas- cist Marshal Rodolfo Graziani from vengeful Socialist parti- sans.\" On April 29, in Rome, OSS officer James Jesus Angle- ton would similarly rescue Prince Valerio Borghese, by dis- guising him as a U.S. Army officer.\" After the war Graziani and Borghese became leaders of the neo-fascist MSI Party, while their wartime cadres were apparently helped to new anti- communist careers with the support of the Vatican, and ulti- mately, the United States.\" In the months after the war, Angle- ton helped other fascists and Nazis to \"escape\" from prison camps, supplying them when necessary with new identities.\" 75.

Martin, Wilderness of Mirrors (New York: Harper & Row, 14 CovertAction There seems no question that by April 1945 the OSS was re- cruiting Nazis and fascists to help mobilize against postwar communism. As a recent historian has observed: The history of OSS, which is indistinguishable from the se- cret political history of the war, is marked by a preoccupa- tion with Communism almost as intense as its commitment to victory against Germany.\" At least some of the SS men who in the last weeks of the war negotiated with the OSS were treated thereafter as allies. Wilhelm Hoettl, for example, who had transmitted an offer from SS Deputy Head Kaltenbrunner, worked after the war, like his former subordinate Schwend, as an informant for the CIC in Austria.\" Walter Rauff, who had negotiated in Milan with Dulles's aide Daddario, was also spared, despite having directed the mobile gas chambers in Nazi-occupied Russia. By his own ac- count, which has been reported as fact in the U.S. press, Rauff \"escaped\" after his arrest, by U.S. troops, to move with Vati- can help first to Vatican City and then to Syria.\" British and French sources agree however that Rauff, by as early as June 1945, had established himself in Genoa. There, with the aid of Cardinal Siri, Bishop of Genoa, Rauff organized a transit camp where as many as 5,000 fleeing Nazis were sheltered before their departure to Argentina, Syria, or Egypt.\" The French Nazi hunter Beata Klarsfeld agreed that, like his Kameraden- werk ally Schwend, Rauff too was working with U.S. intelli- gence before escaping to Chile.\" This seems probable, inasmuch as Schwend was working for the Austrian CIC while setting up the Merano station of what became known as the Rat Line. At some point, moreover, cer- tainly by the early 1950s, the CIA and the Gehlen Org were working together to move Gehlen agents (headed by Skorzeny) to Egypt.\"\" Long before these officially authorized movements, Donovan and Dulles must have seen that, with a global net- work of its men already in place, the Gehlen Org would be an even more impressive asset in their case for a postwar CIA. Through their connections with the Gehlen Organization, Skorzeny, Rauff, Barbie, and Schwend all became in effect in- struments of CIA intelligence and covert action policies. In so doing, they contributed significantly to the establishment of fascist style oppression in the new countries to which they had moved-in Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Peru. One legacy of this oppression is the system of Death Squads now operative in Central America. Another has been the in- volvement of men like Barbie and their political clients in the highly organized Latin American drug traffic. ? 1980), p. 19. 85. Powers, op. cit., n. I I, p. 25. 86.

He spent two years investigating Klaus Barbie, in- cluding a year in Bolivia, from which he made a hurried exit when his identity as an investigative journalist became known. A colleague continued the on-the-scene investigation, and the results of the work appeared in a series in Stern in May and June, 1984. The following translation is of one of the six arti- cles, explaining Klaus Barbie's major role in the 1980 Boli- vian coup. The first time we only saw Alfredo Mario Mingolla from afar. It was in front of the presidential palace in La Paz. Vice- president Jaime Paz, surrounded by his bodyguards, slowly went across the square and approached the palace. We had got- ten a hint that \"something would happen.\" But nothing indicated anything unusual on this morning. The old men on the benches moved into the shade. It was cool, but the sun was already beginning to burn the skin. The Boli- vian capital La Paz is almost 4,000 meters above sea level. The shoeshine children, the youngest barely older than four, with large, old eyes, begged in vain to shine the men's shoes. The pickpockets were still waiting for the tourists. Indian women begged, steadfastly stretching their felt hats into space, and were just as motionless as their children cowering on the ground with dirty faces. Then some kind of command was shouted. A man ran, at- tempted to escape into a side street, was overpowered and dragged into the palace. The man was the Argentinean intelligence agent, Lieutenant Alfredo Mario Mingolla. He was arrested for preparing the as- sassination of the Bolivian Vice-president. An accomplice had betrayed the murder plan. That was on November 28, 1982. A good year later we were sitting across from Alfredo Mingolla in the conference room of the Bolivian Ministry of the Interior. The Argentinean was fetched from a basement cell in the ministry. * Copyright ? 1984 by Kai Hermann. Published with the kind permission of the author. Translation by Marie Louise Ryback.

He was fed up with the fascists who had not lifted a finger to help him after his ar- rest. He was no longer a Nazi; he was now working for the democrats. Alfredo Mingolla thought we were contact people from the Austrian information agency, working for his release, in order to use him in an international narcotics investigation.

Most of them are in Central America. I went to Bolivia. In 1982 I was sent to Guatemala. There I worked primarily with the North Americans. That was the best time.\" Alfredo Mingolla belonged to that mercenary unit of interna- tional assassins and torture experts who were first tested under the leadership of the Argentinean intelligence agency during the Pinochet putsch in Chile in 1973. They then helped or- ganize and execute the political mass murder in Argentina be- fore being used in other Latin American countries against the \"subversives\"- against guerrillas, leftist democrats, or Cath- olic clergymen. Mingolla plays the role of the educated priest. He speaks softly, talks about banalities convincingly, folds his hands, looks the person across from him intently in the eyes. He was the fanatical ideologue among his equals; a national socialist priest. We asked him who he had worked for in Bolivia. Mingolla: \"What do you mean? For everybody; Argenti- neans, Bolivians, CIA.\" We were able to speak with Alfredo Mingolla two days later and read the transcript of his interrogation by the police. Stn RI,AD8 \"IN The Argentinean lieutenant gave information about the coup d'etat of 1980 in Bolivia. It confirmed the information about the fascist scene from investigations by the Bolivian Ministry of the Interior and statements by the French intelligence or- ganization. The 1980 Bolivian Coup The 1980 putsch was not just one of many coups d'etat by power-hungry generals in Bolivia. It was two years in the plan- ning and was supposed to complete a \"stable axis\" in South America-from Chile, through Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, to Bolivia. The coups in Chile in 1973 and in Argen- tina in 1976 were examples. That is how it is stated in a plan with the code name Amapole (poppy flower) which had already been devised in 1978 at the initiative of the Bolivian intelligence officer Klaus Altmann, i.e., Klaus Barbie. The political, economic, and military as- pects of the planned putsch were set forth in 145 pages. Klaus Barbie himself prepared the military part. The Bolivian banker, Dr. Enrique Garcia, had the responsi- bility of planning the economic direction of the \"new order\" after the putsch. U.S. institutions paid him for his work. Under the heading \"logical framework\" Garcia designed an economic order for Bolivia using Chile as an example. If one believes the designer of the plan, there were very definite for- eign promises of investments-under the stipulation that the economy in no way be jeopardized by leftist parties or \"sub- versive groups\" for at least ten years. U.S. concerns accord- ingly promised an oil refinery, a truck assembly plant and a Ford factory. Argentina wanted to secure the exploitation of the ore deposits in Mutun with long term credits. In Bolivia in 1978 another transition phase from military dictatorship to democracy began. Elections were held and an- nulled by the military. Barbie assumed that within the next two years it would come to the establishment of a powerless civil- Klaus Barbie's Bolivian intelligence ID, showing him as Klaus Altmann Hansen. 16 CovertAction Number 25 (Winter 1986) Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 ian government. He speculated that in the power vacuum of the transition period armed leftist extremist groups would again develop. A leftist guerrilla was supposed to be the alibi for an ''Argentinean solution\"-the physical liquidation of the left- ists in Bolivia. Early in 1978 Klaus Barbie flew to West Germany, among other reasons to recruit soldiers. He started with the buildup of his terror commandos. Barbie also took up contact with the Argentinean intelligence organization which, at the time, along with the CIA, insured the maintenance of the old dictatorships in various Latin American countries. The contact man to the Argentineans was the Italian, Dr. Emilio Carbone, steady guest at Barbie's table in the Cafe La Paz. Carbone was a member of a group supporting the Italian neofascist terrorist, Stefano delle Chiaie. The group had come to Chile in 1976 and had taken on special assignments for the intelligence organization DINA. The address of the group: Calle de la Asuncion 1173, Santiago. On the recommendation of an old SS comrade in Chile, Walter Rauff, the inventor of the portable gas chamber wagon and DINA employee, Barbie had brought the Italian Carbone to Bolivia at the end of 1976. Carbone was more of a theoretician than a practitioner of political assassinations. In La Paz he became secretary of the \"Black International,\" a fascist group. The other Italians from delle Ciliate's group moved on in November 1977 to Argentina, and there, under Colonel Moli- nari, the Secretary of State Security, were used in the \"Fight Against Subversion.\" Early in 1978 Barbie assigned his col- league Carbone to take up contact with the leader of the Italian execution commandos, Stefano delle Chiaie, and to recruit him for a mission in Bolivia. The Argentinean intelligence organization sent a special commando group to La Paz. Among the first Argentinean in- telligence officers who worked on the plans for the overthrow Number 25 (Winter 1986) in Bolivia was Lieutenant Alfred Mario Mingolla. The Argen- tinean had the order to contact Altmann, alias Barbie. Mingolla: \"I had not heard much about Altmann: however, before our departure we received it dossier on him. There it stated that he was of great use to Argentina because he played an important role in all of Latin America in the fight against communism. From the dossier it was also clear that Altmann worked for the Americans. They listed his contact people as well as his various trips to the U.S.\" Argentinean intelligence people and German soldiers who came to La Paz went the same route. They first reported to Dr. Alfredo Candia, the Bolivian leader of the \"World Anti-Com- munist League,\" an organization close to the CIA with head- quarters in Taiwan. Candia then brought them to Schneider's clock shop. The owner, of German descent, likes to show his comrades it picture in which Hitler's party secretary Martin Bormann, who had allegedly vanished in 1945, is to be seen in a monk's habit in La Paz. Schneider checked out the new re- cruits and ordered them to meet with Barbie the next day at the driving school \"Indianapolis\" on the Avenida Nlariscal, Santa Cruz. Barbie's secretary, Alvaro de Castro, then provided them with a two-year visa, Interpol identification, and firearm licenses from the Ministry of the Interior. The Argentinean agents moved into the offices of the mili- tary intelligence agency G2, department V11 for ''psychologi- cal warfare.\" In addition, some of the Germans, such as Joachim Fiebelkorn, became agents for the Bolivian intelli- gence organization. Joachim Fiebelkorn, left, giving Nazi salute after putsch in Bolivia. Fiebelkorn was commander of Bar- bie's battalion, the Fiances of Death. After Garcia Meza was deposed in October 1982, Barbie was deported to France, and Fiebelkorn was delivered to West German authorities on drug charges. In Frankfurt, Fiebelkorn's trial, which includes charges of torturing a girl, has been dragging on for al- most two years. He is also wanted in Italy, along with Stefano delle Chiaie, for the terrorist bombing of the Bologna railway station in 1980, which killed 85 people. Sources speculate that his trial may never be completed because of his claims that his work with the cocaine gen- erals was part of his assignment as a U.S. Drug Enforce- ment Administration operative. There is also considera- ble speculation whether Barbie will ever go to trial in France, because of his CIA ties. ? 1 ~ CovertAction 17 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Barbie wanted to launch a national socialist government from the planned coup. The leading rightists of the Bolivian military became members of the secret lodge \"Thule.\" During lodge meetings Barbie lectured underneath swastikas and by candlelight on national socialist principles. Barbie agreed with the terrorist leader Stefano delle Chiaie that armed rightist-extremist groups from the whole world should be brought together. Bolivia was to become the core of a national socialist revolution in all of South America. The \"Black International\" outfitted an ideological and paramilitary training camp for foreign comrades in buildings belonging to the \"Summer Institute of Linguistics,\" a CIA-controlled in- stitution. Barbie's closest colleagues organized a national socialist fighter's group, the Bolivia Joven, \"Young Bolivia,\" mo- deled after the example of the SA. The co-founders were Bar- bie's confidant Emilio Carbone and Barbie's secretary, Alvaro de Castro. The official leader of the Young Bolivians was the thirty-year-old Armando Leyton, intelligence agent and disci- ple of national socialism. Leyton proudly shows his membership ID with \"Reichs\" eagle and swastika. He would like to meet the German neo- Nazi Michael Kuhnen. He says that he admires the Germans, but qualifies this: \"Some of the Germans who came to us at that time-such as Joachim Fiebelkorn, for example-were not good national socialists. In my eyes they were simply mer- cenaries who knew nothing about national socialist morale and discipline. They only wanted part of the cocaine money.\" Final Preparations In the spring of 1980 Klaus Barbie and his accomplices made the last preparations for the putsch. In the meantime, in La Paz, a civilian cabinet had been sworn in and the tempered middle-left coalition under Siles won new elections. The left guerrillas, on whom Barbie had counted, did not exist. Then the Bolivia Joven, with the support of Barbie's foreign ter- rorist groups, stepped into action. Bombs detonated throughout the entire country. In May 1980, another commando of the Argentinean intelli- gence organization, SIE, came to La Paz. The group, working under orders from Lieutenant Colonel Julio Cesar Duran, was responsible for carrying out the putsch and for \"professional i z- ing the Bolivian security apparatus.\" Delegated to the group were both italian terrorists Stefano delle Chiaie and Pierluigi Pagliai, who was wanted, among other reasons, for murdering a functionary of the communist youth in Italy. The foreign agent team was later completed with two Israeli specialists. Barbie had nothing against Israelis when they were \"military security experts.\" The Bolivian military putsch of July 17, 1980 was almost exclusively directed and organized by foreigners. The only im- portant Bolivian players were General Luiz Garcia Meza and Colonel Luis Arce Gomez who had been earmarked as Junta leaders. They were considered the toughest in the right ex- tremist officers' clique. Nevertheless, Barbie encountered opposition from the mili- tary when he, together with the Argentineans, prepared an ex- ecution list: 185 politicians, union members, and intellectuals were supposed to be liquidated during the putsch. High ranking officers who learned of the plan discovered friends and rela- tives among the \"subversives\" who were supposed to be \"liq- uidated.\" Barbie and his accomplices could not put through the \"Argentinean solution.\" 18 CovertAction The mysterious and elusive Italian terrorist Stefano delle Chiaie, still at large. A few days before the scheduled date of the putsch, Joachim Fiebelkorn, the commander of the paramilitary troupe in Santa Cruz, received the order from Barbie's secretary, Alvaro de Castro, to come to La Paz with his armed battalion. Fiebelkorn called Barbie, who then confirmed the order. Barbie's secre- tary Castro received the German-Bolivian commando at La Paz airport and channeled two suitcases filled with weapons through customs. For two days Fiebelkorn inspected the capi- tal's strategically important points before returning once again to Santa Cruz with his comrades. Barbie and the commanding general of Santa Cruz, Echeveria, argued about the competency of Fiebelkorn's action unit, the \"Fiances of Death.\" The general insisted on using the Fiances in the putsch of Santa Cruz. Only one of the paramilitary men from Santa Cruz, the in- famous killer Mosca Monroi, arrived punctually in La Paz. There, by mistake, Monroi killed, among others, the guard of a secret U.S. transmitter. The putsch was more precisely planned and executed than any other putsch in Bolivia's history. The paramilitary stormed the union hall and the party headquarters. Almost all potential leaders of the resistance were arrested within hours. The brut- ality of the terrorist groups and the military frightened off the workers and students. Only the Indians from the tin mines des- perately resisted for another few days. As with any overthrow, most of the victims were among them. The coup of July 17, 1980 had many victors. The fascists celebrated the national socialist takeover of power with swas- tika flags and the greeting, \"Heil Hitler!\" Those supporting a free market system for Latin America believed that socialism had been averted. Washington, despite reservations about such officers as Garcia and Arce, could hope for a stable govern- ment, sympathetic to the U.S. The Argentinean military dic- tators had extended their sphere of influence. The Role of the Moonies The first official well-wisher who visited the newly coro- nated president Garcia was a surprise, at least for outsiders: He was the acting leader of the Moonies, Colonel Bo Hi Pak. The Number 25 (Winter 1986) Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 representative of the sect's founder Moon announced after his return to the U.S.: \"I have erected a throne for Father Moon in, the world's highest city.\" According to the legally recognized assessment of four cler- gymen from Hessen [a West German state], the Moon sect is a \"criminal union that espouses human psychological terror and proclaims a fascist system.\" The Moon sect possesses, among other things, munitions factories in South Korea and television channels in South America. They regard their founder, Moon, as \"Holy Father,\" President Reagan as the world's \"political savior. \" A representative of the Moon sect had come to Bolivia at the end of the 1960s. On the thirteenth floor of the Jazmin building in La Paz an Asian named Harumiko Iwasawa sat with some Americans and no one seemed to know what they were actually doing there. It was not until 1983 that the Bolivian Ministry of the Inter- ior and Bolivian journalists determined that the gentlemen from the Moon sect-as well as others-had invested about $4 million into the preparation of the coup. Membership lists of the political Moon organization \"Cauca\" were found. At the top of the lists were the names of almost all the leading military personnel who, at the same time, had been honoring the swas- tika in Barbie's lodge. Even junta leader Garcia had been con- verted to the \"Moonier\" for a time. Barbie was skeptical of the sect's activities but had to accept the Moon people as allies. On May 31, 1981, nine months after the cocaine generals' coup, almost the entire leadership of the Moon sect and their Latin American political organization Causa flew to La Paz. Before 200 invited guests in the Sheraton Hotel's \"Hall of Freedom,\" Moon's representative Colonel Pak and the Boli- vian junta leader Garcia began by praying for U.S. President Reagan who had been wounded in an assassination attempt. Pak then explained, \"God had chosen the Bolivian people in the heart of South America as the ones to conquer com- munism.\" The Moon organization Causa started their political mission- ary work throughout the entire country. Fifty thousand of the sect's books-according to a Bolivian intelligence agency re- port-were brought to La Paz by an American Air Force plane. Along with ideological \"enlightenment,\" the education of an anti-communist \"people's army\" for an \"armed church\" began. Around 7,000 Bolivians took part in the pre-military training. The Israeli Embassy supported the campaign and deliv- ered, among other things, instructional films about the fight against the Palestinian resistance. The leader of the Moon group in Bolivia was Thomas (Tom) Ward. Barbie and the pale American Ward, who always seemed to be absorbed in prayer, were often seen together. Tom Ward was also the man who delivered a payment from the CIA in early 1981 to the Argentinean intelligence Lieuten- ant Alfredo Mingolla. The $1,500 monthly salary for Mingolla was paid in the Causa office belonging to William Selig, Ward's representative. Selig put less stock in pious attitudes than his boss. He was an electronic specialist with experience in Vietnam and advised the Bolivian intelligence organization on technical matters. The third man in the CIA cadre of the Moonies was Paul Perry, who had already tried to organize an \"armed church\" in Brazil. The Argentinean agent Alfredo Mingolla at first knew little about the connection between the Nazi Barbie and the Moonie Number 25 (Winter 1986) Ward. Two days after his recruitment by the CIA, says Min- golla, he met the \"Old German\" in the courtyard of the Boli- vian General Staff. Mingolla cane out of department VII of the intelligence agency; Barbie came out of department Ill. Barbie greeted his colleague-as Mingolla remembers it, \"Hello, comrade, what do I hear'? Are you working for a new employer'?'' Mingolla answered with surprise, \"For what, for who, then'?\" Barbie: \"Na, for Mr. Ward, for example.'' Min- golla feared reproach. \"Yes. Doesn't the organization allow that'?\" Barbie laughed. \"It's okay. There has to be coopera- tion.\" Mingolla says that it was first clear to him on that day that Barbie had become a top man for the CIA. Because only top people knew the names of the other agency employees. The Moon man Tom Ward was Klaus Barbie's CIA contact man only preceding and directly after the putsch of 1980. Bar- bie's steady CIA contact person was the munitions dealer Fer- nando Inchauste. He boasted that he had direct contact with President Reagan, whom he allegedly knew during the latter's California governor days. Another one of Barbie's steady CIA contact people was George Portugal, also a munitions dealer. He was Inchauste's close co-worker and Barbie's business friend. The third man from the \"secret intelligence area\" with whom Barbie worked was Ludwig Alvez Pacheco. The first name, \"Ludwig,\" represents his German ancestry, something which Alvez Pacheco boasts about. The Bolivian is also proud of his real German passport. He received the passport, he says, for special services rendered to West Germany. The Intelligence Connections With regard to the quality of Barbie's activities as an agent for the American and West German information agencies, even those Bolivian government members who ought to know it best, speak about it only hesitantly. The defense minister of the pro-western government in Bolivia at the time, Manuel Cardenas Mallo, in an official in- terview, cautiously answered our questions regarding informa- tion about Barbie's work for foreign agencies. Cardenas: \"We have no documentation about it. They let those 'disappear' before President Siles took over the govern- ment. But that Barbie worked for foreign intelligence agencies CovertAction 19 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170004-5 Thomas J. Ward has been with the Moonies since the early 1970s. After the Bolivian coup he became Director of CAUSA and rose to Vice-President in 1984. He was active in CAUSA's indoctrination seminars for political and military leaders in the Southern Cone in the early 1980s. Ward successfully sued his parents for an attempted \"deprogramming\" several years ago. Moon theology calls for rejecting one's biological parents in favor of the True Parents, Rev. and Mrs. Moon. William Selig is Director of Publications for the CAUSA Institute in New York, which produces such publications as the CAUSA Lecture Manual, the basic teaching book used for Moon's ideological indoctrina- tion around the world. Current indoctrination and con- version targets are American clergy and retired military officers. ? is believable. Many people knew that and there are many people who can confirm that.\" Was Barbie merely an informant, or did he, working for for- eign agencies, influence the political development? Cardenas: \"Many people who worked with Barbie are still in service here. You must understand-it is dangerous if they find out that foreigners had so much influence here, that they did not just play an advisory role, but that they actually made decisions.\" Do you mean to say that the U.S.A. staged the 1980 coup'? Cardenas hesitates, then answers, \"Let me say it like this and then you can quote me: If there isn't a coup happening today, it is only because of one reason: Because it is the first time that the Americans are not interested in a coup.\" Washitgton was quick to note that Garcia's and Arce's mili- tary junta, which had come to power through the 1980 putsch, did not really serve the interests of the U.S. The complicated and seemingly perfect system of oppression that Barbie and his colleagues had instigated, sank in the swamp of the cocaine trade. The paramilitary units-conceived by Barbie as a new type of SS-sold themselves to the cocaine barons. The attrac- tion of fast money in the cocaine trade was stronger than the idea of a national socialist revolution in Latin America. The reigning military set the example. They wanted the monopoly on the cocaine trade. It is reported in the files of the Argentinean intelligence agency that the sum of a hundred mil- lion dollars went to the foreign private bank accounts of gener- als and colonels. To top things off, Garcia and Arce also plun- dered the national bank. The Bolivian nation and the Bolivian economy faced total bankruptcy. Following statements from Washington indicating a cooling in relations, sanctions against the military junta were imposed in 1981. The Moon sect disappeared overnight from Bolivia as clandestinely as they had arrived. Only the CIA trio of the Moonies-Ward, Selig, and Perry-stayed on for a while as advisers to the Bolivian information agency in order to assist in an orderly transition to a democratic form of government. In the beginning of March 1982, the Argentinean agent Min- golla met with the Moon-CIA agent Ward in the cafeteria \"Fontana\" of La Paz's Hotel Plaza. The seminary priest Mingolla remembered that it was St. Thomas Aquinas's name day. Mingolla's CIA involvement had silently expired. The Argentinean asked the American what was still going on. Tom Ward seemed resigned. He said the government in Argentina was finished. And the Argentineans had made a lot of mistakes in Bolivia: \"Your entire position is simply too reactionary. The whole affair with Altmann (Barbie), with the whole Fascism and Nazism bit, that was a dead end street.\" Ward ordered a drink after his first coffee. Mingolla was sur- prised that the bigoted ascetic had suddenly started to drink. But even the fanatical Nazi Mingolla seemed to have turned over a new leaf. \"You can't create a new order with the old Germans, with Hitler and all that. You have to find something modern. \" Tom Ward, under the influence of alcohol, started criticiz- ing himself severely. \"It was also stupid having Moon and Causa here.\" Mingolla was perplexed. \"You're saying that? You're the boss of the whole thing, the head missionary.\" Tom Ward suggested that it is better to enjoy life a hit. Both of them went into the disco-brothel \"Jetset.\" When they left the brothel, the curfew had started. There were no more taxis on the street. Both agents went to the Sheraton and shared a suite. A few days later, Ward flew to the U.S.; Mingolla to Guatemala. Swarms of starving Indians came to La Paz. The democrats took over the responsibility for billions in foreign debts, three digit inflation rates, and a rigid savings policy dictated by the World Bank. Salaries dipped below the subsistence level. A famine had broken out in Bolivia. ?

By Robert Cohen * RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5-\"If someone wants to buy fine glassware he goes to Czechoslovakia,\" Altamiro da Rocha Oliveira, a leading surgeon here recently noted. If he wants the best wine, he goes to France. But everybody knows that for plastic surgery you come to a Brazilian. . .- Rio de Janeiro has emerged as the plastic surgery capital of the world. . . . The leading aesthetic surgeons on Rio de Janeiro's social circuit are accorded superstar status and sometimes tend to see themselves more as artists than as doctors. It must have been sometime in 1973. I was living in Cuba, working as a journalist. One evening a good friend, Luis, came to my house, as he did often after a long day at the hospital. Luis is a plastic surgeon and burn specialist. Instead of crack- ing jokes and playing with the kids, this time he flopped down in a chair with a long, pale face and asked for a drink-a dou- ble. He sat for a long time without speaking, nursing his drink. All kinds of terrible things passed through my mind as I waited for him to share what was on his. The story he told me far surpassed in horror anything that had occurred to me during his prolonged silence. It is a story I have told few people over the years and never written down, perhaps to spare others, perhaps to spare myself the pain and rage it provokes. And yet, Luis's story"
