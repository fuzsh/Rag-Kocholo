        "text": "This trail was designed by ‘Elevation Mountain Bike Camps’ owner Paul Meiklkejohn. Paul is a 2-time Canadian Mens Downhill Champion and he named the trail in honour of the site of his first national title. Bromont is a skiing and Mtn. bike facility in Quebec’s Eastern Townships. The trail is fast and challenging – and not for beginners!\n\nCreated by Tim Oliver, Paul Meiklejohn, John Nutbrown and Phil Miguel. Named after a 1980’s cross dressing glam band – the trail is very twisty. The four creators were probably the original mountain bikers in Norfolk County. Jim Nutbrown sold Giant bikes and wrenched at ‘Independent Bikes and Boards’. Phil Miguel was a terrific rider, who unfortunately, passed away from a brain tumour at the age of 25 . Tim Oliver raced competitively and is rep for Rocky Mountain Bikes . Paul Meiklejohn is downhill mountain biking champion.\n\nCreated by Rob Martin, Doug Balsor, Rob Luke and his son Simon. The trail has an abandoned 30-gallon kerosene drum in the very middle and was used as a reference point while building the trail. “Pail trail” was much easier to say than “45 gallon drum”\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders. A flowy twisty turny singletrack utilizing every possible square meter of the quadrant to the point where you are pretty much dizzy at the end of the 2.9 km, mostly flat trail.\n\nTrail name is a reference to the fact that it is badly eroded and in places; easy to bury a front wheel and go over the bars.\n\nNamed by R. Luke in 2009 and references the fact that the trail traverses and encompasses most of the Anderson Tract and its trails. Trail is actually a reclaimed logging skid trail from timber cut in year 2000.\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders and developed by dozens of Club Volunteers. A challenging 2.5 km “effort vs. reward” single-track trail with enough hills to take your breath away and maybe make your quads lactate! A short but thrilling downhill section puts a smile on your face!\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders and developed by dozens of Club Volunteers. A 2 km blasting single track trail leading from the main dump area to Hot Flash at the bottom. Has several ups and downs, features, berms and rock gardens in between.\n\nCreated by Andy Palermo. This trail has a purpose…get riders from the LOST World junction E5 on Pail Trail to Charlotteville concession road 2 to the north as quickly as possible. The name Recycler incorporates the old dump theme. The trail runs faster north to south and incorporates some tight gaps that might leave some tree bark on your bar ends.\n\nThis is actually a County service road inside the old Charlotteville dump that circle around the clay cap. It allows riders to easily make their way from one trail entrance to another or to return to the parking area if necessary.\n\nThis is the old ’ White Tail’ trail reworked and lengthened by designer Kevin Saunders. If you like hills with lots if bottom-of-the-hill berms – this trail is for you! This trail will wear your legs and lungs out.\n\nCreated by Paul Meiklejohn, Tim Oliver, John Nutbrown and Phil Miguel. Named after a ski run at Whistler that has a very hard switchback at the end. Canadian Downhill champ Paul Meiklejohn used this trail to dial in his new competitive downhill bike for the upcoming season. If you can negotiate this trail with confidence; you are a bona fide mountain biker!\n\nThe first half was created by Rob Luke and built going uphill/second half created by Paul Meiklejohn and Josh DeWitt and was built going downhill and the two trails met in the middle. Original trail line was re-routed to avoid a fox den – the foxes and the den is still there and thriving. When walking into work on the trail, Rob Luke was greeted by all the foxes and their new-born kits (25-30) sitting around their den (it can be seen from the trail). The trail is also the name of a song by the groups “The Good Brothers” and “Sweet”\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders. A challenging but rewarding single track trail heading to Red Hat Junction. The construction of this trail over a few months scurried up dozens and dozens of our white tailed friends as this area is a main thruway for deer\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders. A windy flowy single-track trail that utilizes the natural sand spine within TPPP. Named after its creator, it has proven popular for new and seasoned riders. It starts and ends on Mole Road with a connection to “226” to lead riders through the Provincial Park to the West Side Trails.\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders. The creator fell on a purposely left in log on the inaugural ride and cut his ear. Could have been a head shot – but he insisted he hurt his ear. A challenging warm-up trail from Mole Road to Hump Back and Dizzy……..who says T.P. is flat??\n\nRoad allowance for the county used by the local gas company to service a main gas well at Hidden Valley Campground. The trail follows a natural gas line to a ‘Metalore’ gas well. It is the Northern border of Turkey Point Provincial Park and is actually a County easement for Charlotteville Concession 1. Generic reference used by local mtn. bikers and added to official trail list in 2012-2013 when club started signing trails.\n\nCreated by Sherri Schira and the LOST Girls. In an effort to increase the number of female riders, the Ladies On Single Track was started in 2013 and it seemed fitting that they create their own trail. This trail features input from several of the original LOST members and includes some great features including rock jumps and fast dips through the valley. The name is self-explanatory!\n\nCreated by Todd Major. Fast and flowy one way, a tough grunty uphill the other, it’s a trail with a split personality. We’re sure though, that no matter which one you meet, it’ll leave you with a grin and wanting more. You will not ride ‘Roughshod’ over this trail.\n\nThis fast connector trail is actually an old illegal quad and moto- cross trail that we adopted. Named in honour of local gentlemen/businessmen who plied a certain trade in Long Point Bay in the 1920s – See the Volstead Act 1919.\n\nThe first half of the trail was created by Paul Meiklejohn and Terry Stevens. Completed the next year by Paul Meiklejohn and assisted by Rob Martin , Rob Luke and Doug Balsor. The trail stopped halfway and we would carry our bikes out to the logging road through the Poison Ivy. The odometer on Rob Luke’s first bike (Giant ATX 870) was set in imperial units and the new trail measured exactly one mile.\n\nStarted by Rob Martin and Rob Luke but adopted and mainly created by Kevin Saunders. Original trail was supposed to go through 7 acres of plantation Jack Pine but then the Provincial Park did a prescribed burn and the trail skirts around the burned area and touches the edge twice. Hence the name. (nothing to do with lactic acid build-up in your quads)!\n\nThe trail was created by Provincial Park to go around manmade lake. When the dam failed in 2008, the fish hatchery was rebuilt and the trail was abandoned by the Park. TPMBC kept the trail open and renamed the northern section around the ‘Pile Driver’.\n\nThe trail starts in Turkey Point Provincial Park at Campsite # 226 in the ‘Fin and Feather’ campground. It’s called ‘226’ so campers in the park(that are hikers or mtn.bikers have a reference point to access the network. Also hoped it would make life easier for Park Attendant at Park front office answering questions.\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders with help from Ken Wedow, Claude LaPrarie, Wayne Van Groningan and Ron Armstrong. Named in honour of Mike Postma – retired Superintendant of Turkey Point Provincial Park. He encouraged us and facilitated the building of our trails. Suggested we sign a MOU with the park. This trail transitions from hills to open Oak Savannah that the area is famous for and leads to the church trails.\n\nCreated by Kevin Saunders and developed by dozens of Club Volunteers. Our first trail at the United Church Camp. Cut by dozens of club volunteers in the pouring rain. Second time through the trail, Rob Luke hit a stump and went over the bars and badly bruised his left lung. Trauma to the chest can lead to pneumonia and Rob developed it in his left lung only.\n\nCreated by Andy Palermo and Todd Major. This trail was designed to maximize the use of the elevation changes of the area. The trail runs faster North–South. A number of fast up and downs and bermed corners keeps the pace high. It also rides great in the opposite direction when you’re feeling the need to climb some hills. Named after the test stations along the way. It’s a natural gas!\n\nCreated by Brian Pond. This is an easy flowy trail, make it challenging by cranking up the speed. While making this trail, two children’s strollers were found, and now mark each trail-head,\n\nby Kevin Saunders and developed by dozens of Club Volunteers. A mystery trail scoping the highest point in TP and turning the natural downhill into a 3x flurry of spines and berms to take you from Red Hat Junction to Combustion Junction or vice versa. Triple Shred’s splits into 3 trails early and they then merge back together near the end of the trail. To avoid confusion, the trail building crews dubbed the split trails , ‘Larry, Curly and Moe’ for reference. TPMBC plans on placing silhouette likeness signs of our favourite stooges on each trail in 2020.\n\nCreated by Mike McArthur and Dave Pond along with the new crew from Long Point Eco-Adventures. The start from either end of the trail is exactly that – a grind. Rides best east to west.\n\nCreated by Dave Pond. A fast flowing and lengthy trail with a series of ups and downs and creek crossings. On route riders will pass the actual abandoned truck motor for which the trail is named. This trail was built in a day by about 40 members from the club. It was a great day!\n\nCreated by Ted Adams , Mike McArthur and Dave Pond. The trail instantly vanished in 2010 only to reappear 2017. Named after the song by Genesis that deals with a long journey that ends in the trick – an illusion and returning back home.\n\nThe last trail on ‘Luke Lake property. Trail designed and created by members hailing from the west end of Norfolk County. An Intermediate trail with some hills and hopefully some stunts. The name is a cultural reference to social divisions in Walsingham Township and Valley Heights Secondary School. ‘45’ is actually a County road but we’re not sure which side of the road is the preferred address?\n\nCreated by Ted Adams, Mike McArthur and Dave Pond. While supervising Dave and Mike who were creating the way to get over the large downed-tree along the deep ravine, Ted Adam’s bleary eyes spotted a nearby rock at the start of a side ravine which a tree was above and root exposed. Ted could only say “root” and “rock”, and so it was.\n\nCreated in by Ted Adams, Mike McArthur and Dave Pond. With Ted and Mike left to complete finishing work on a late afternoon, Ted decided to single-handedly attempt to lift and move a downed tree. Ted’s effort caused him to slip a disc in his back. All about Ted!\n\nCreated in by Dave Pond under the tutelage of Paul Meiklejohn. A .3 km trail shortcut is actually part of the old Lake Shore Road with patches of old pavement and a centre line still visible – reminiscent of the road in the poster for the original movie “Planet of the Apes”.\n\nCreated by Dave Pond, Mike McArthur and Ted Adams. The trails many features from those that like a pump track, to various obstacles and directions resembled the pathway of the area bird, the wild turkey. This trail was built over several days by the TPMBC club members.\n\nCreated in by Mike McArthur and Dave Pond. Runs along Long Point Eco-Adventures south of Front Road and oversees the Turkey Point Marsh in areas and winds through restored tall grass prairie habitat to connect with the winery.\n\nCreated by Dave Pond and Mike McArthur. Completed the trail in stages over 2 years and circles Burning Kiln Winery. A wide blend of various terrain and scenery. Named after the Genesis’s song of the same name.\n\nRe-established by the TPMBC executive with 26 MNRF staff supervising the efforts to revive an existing trail earlier created by Dave Pond, Mike McArthur, Ted Adams and Jeff Howe. Original trail went through the Picetum – a plantation that holds the largest collection of pine trees from all around the world.\n\nDesigned by Dave Pond. The trail was constructed during the COVID 19 lockdown in March and April . Mild weather allowed us to work in safe pods of 5-6 people and social distancing was strictly practiced. Big brother trail to’ Definite Mabee’ ."
