        "text": "Prepared by Daniel B Miller\n\nHarold Clayton Lloyd Sr. (April 20, 1893 – March 8, 1971) was an American actor, comedian, director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films.[1]\n\nLloyd ranks alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most popular and influential film comedians of the silent film era. Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and “talkies“, between 1914 and 1947. He is best known for his bespectacled “Glasses” character,[2][3] a resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who was perfectly in tune with 1920s-era United States.\n\nHis films frequently contained “thrill sequences” of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, for which he is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most enduring images in all of cinema.[4]\n\nLloyd did many dangerous stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand[5] (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, though the glove often did not go unnoticed).\n\nAlthough Lloyd’s individual films were not as commercially successful as Chaplin’s on average, he was far more prolific (releasing 12 feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four), and made more money overall ($15.7 million to Chaplin’s $10.5 million).[citation needed]\n\nEarly life\n\nHarold Clayton Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard, Nebraska, the son of James Darsie Lloyd and Sarah Elisabeth Fraser. His paternal great-grandparents were Welsh.[6]\n\nIn 1910, after his father had several business ventures fail, Lloyd’s parents divorced and his father moved with his son to San Diego, California. Lloyd had acted in theater since a child, but in California he began acting in one-reel film comedies around 1912.\n\nYoung Harold Lloyd\n\nCareer\n\nSilent shorts and features\n\nLloyd worked with Thomas Edison‘s motion picture company, and his first role was a small part as a Yaqui Indian in the production of The Old Monk’s Tale.\n\nHarold Lloyd in The Old Monk’s Tale (J.Searle Dawley, 1913)\n\nAt the age of 20, Lloyd moved to Los Angeles, and took up roles in several Keystone comedies. He was also hired by Universal Studios as an extra and soon became friends with aspiring filmmaker Hal Roach.[7]\n\nLloyd began collaborating with Roach who had formed his own studio in 1913. Roach and Lloyd created “Lonesome Luke”, similar to and playing off the success of Charlie Chaplin films.[8]\n\nHal Roach\n\nHarold Lloyd as Lonesome Luke\n\nHarold Lloyd as Lonesome Luke\n\nHarold Lloyd as Lonesome Luke\n\nLloyd hired Bebe Daniels as a supporting actress in 1914; the two of them were involved romantically and were known as “The Boy” and “The Girl”. In 1919, she left Lloyd to pursue her dramatic aspirations. Later that year, Lloyd replaced Daniels with Mildred Davis, whom he would later marry. Lloyd was tipped off by Hal Roach to watch Davis in a movie. Reportedly, the more Lloyd watched Davis the more he liked her. Lloyd’s first reaction in seeing her was that “she looked like a big French doll”.[9]\n\nBebe Daniels\n\nBebe Daniels\n\nBebe Daniels\n\nHarold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels in Look Pleasant, Please (Alfred J Goulding, 1918)\n\nThe Rolin Film Company – 1915\n\nBebe Daniels (1rst row, middle), Harold Lloyd (2nd Row, middle – in Lonesome Luke costume), Snub Pollard to his left, Hal Roach (3rd row, middle)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels\n\nBy 1918, Lloyd and Roach had begun to develop his character beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism.\n\nThe persona Lloyd referred to as his “Glass” character[10] (often named “Harold” in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with.\n\nThe “Glass” character is said to have been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing;[3] previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque “Lonesome Luke”.\n\nHarold Lloyd – The Glass Character\n\n“When I adopted the glasses,” he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, “it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable.”\n\nUnlike most silent comedy personae, “Harold” was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character’s debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd’s Kids.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Peggy Cartwright in From Hand to Mouth (Alfred J Goulding, Hal Roach, 1919)\n\nPoster for Captain Kidd’s Kids (Hal Roach, 1919)\n\nLloyd’s career was not all laughs, however. In August 1919, while filming Haunted Spooks (Alfred J Goulding, Hal Roach, 1919) posing for some promotional still photographs in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot.\n\nIt exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Mildred Davis in Haunted Spooks (Alfred J Goulding, Hal Roach, 1919)\n\nLloyd was in the act of lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, “I thought I would surely be so disabled that I would never be able to work again. I didn’t suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, ‘Life is worth while. Just to be alive.’ I still think so.”[11]\n\nBeginning in 1921, Roach and Lloyd moved from shorts to feature-length comedies. These included the acclaimed Grandma’s Boy, which (along with Chaplin’s The Kid) pioneered the combination of complex character development and film comedy, the highly popular Safety Last!(1923), which cemented Lloyd’s stardom (and is the oldest film on the American Film Institute‘s List of 100 Most Thrilling Movies), and Why Worry? (1923).\n\nPoster for Grandma’s Boy (Fred C Newmayer, 1922)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Dick Sutherland in Grandma’s Boy (Fred C Newmayer, 1922)\n\nPoster for Safety Last (Fred C Newmeyer, 1923)\n\nHarold Lloyd in Safety Last (Fred C Newmeyer, 1923)\n\nHarold Lloyd in Why Worry? (Fred C Newmeyer, 1923)\n\nHarold Lloyd in Why Worry? (Fred C Newmeyer, 1923)\n\nLloyd and Roach parted ways in 1924, and Lloyd became the independent producer of his own films.\n\nThese included his most accomplished mature features Girl Shy, The Freshman (his highest-grossing silent feature), The Kid Brother, and Speedy, his final silent film. Welcome Danger (1929) was originally a silent film but Lloyd decided late in the production to remake it with dialogue.\n\nAll of these films were enormously successful and profitable, and Lloyd would eventually become the highest paid film performer of the 1920s.[12] They were also highly influential and still find many fans among modern audiences, a testament to the originality and film-making skill of Lloyd and his collaborators. From this success, he became one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Jobyna Ralston (Fred C Newmeyer, 1924)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Jobyna Ralston (Fred C Newmeyer, 1924)\n\nPoster for The Freshman (Fred C Newmeyer, 1925)\n\nHarold Lloyd in The Freshman (Fred C Newmeyer, 1925)\n\nPoster for The Kid Brother (Ted Wilde, Harold Lloyd, 1927)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Jobyna Ralston in The Kid Brother (Ted Wilde, Harold Lloyd, 1927)\n\nLobby card for Speedy (Ted Wilde, 1928)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Ann Christy in Speedy (Ted Wilde, 1928)\n\nPoster for Welcome Danger (Clyde Bruckman, Malcolm St.Clair, 1929)\n\nHarold Lloyd and Barbara Kent on the set of Welcome Danger (Clyde Bruckman, Malcolm St.Clair, 1929)\n\nTalkies and transition\n\nIn 1924, Lloyd formed his own independent film production company, the Harold Lloyd Film Corporation, with his films distributed by Pathé and later Paramount and Twentieth Century-Fox. Lloyd was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nReleased a few weeks before the start of the Great Depression, Welcome Danger was a huge financial success, with audiences eager to hear Lloyd’s voice on film. Lloyd’s rate of film releases, which had been one or two a year in the 1920s, slowed to about one every two years until 1938.\n\nPromotional poster for Welcome Danger (Clyde Bruckman, Malcolm St.Clair, 1929)\n\nThe films released during this period were: Feet First, with a similar scenario to Safety Last which found him clinging to a skyscraper at the climax; Movie Crazy with Constance Cummings; The Cat’s-Paw, which was a dark political comedy and a big departure for Lloyd; and The Milky Way, which was Lloyd’s only attempt at the fashionable genre of the screwball comedy film.\n\nLobby card for Feet First (Clyde Bruckman, Harold Lloyd, 1930)\n\nPoster for Movie Crazy (Clyde Bruckman, Harold Lloyd, 1932)\n\nLobby card for The Cat’s Paw (Sam Taylor, Harold Lloyd, 1934)\n\nLobby card for The Milky Way (Leo McCarey, Ray McCarey, 1936)\n\nTo this point the films had been produced by Lloyd’s company. However, his go-getting screen character was out of touch with Great Depression movie audiences of the 1930s. As the length of time between his film releases increased, his popularity declined, as did the fortunes of his production company. His final film of the decade, Professor Beware, was made by the Paramount staff, with Lloyd functioning only as actor and partial financier.\n\nLobby card for Professor Beware (Elliott Nugent, 1938)\n\nOn March 23, 1937, Lloyd sold the land of his studio, Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company, to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The location is now the site of the Los Angeles California Temple.[13]\n\nLloyd produced a few comedies for RKO Radio Pictures in the early 1940s but otherwise retired from the screen until 1947. He returned for an additional starring appearance in The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, an ill-fated homage to Lloyd’s career, directed by Preston Sturges and financed by Howard Hughes.\n\nLobby card for The Sin of Harold Diddlebock AKA Mad Wednesday (Preston Sturges, 1947)\n\nThis film had the inspired idea of following Harold’s Jazz Age, optimistic character from The Freshman into the Great Depression years. Diddlebock opened with footage from The Freshman (for which Lloyd was paid a royalty of $50,000, matching his actor’s fee) and Lloyd was sufficiently youthful-looking to match the older scenes quite well.\n\nLloyd and Sturges had different conceptions of the material and fought frequently during the shoot; Lloyd was particularly concerned that while Sturges had spent three to four months on the script of the first third of the film, “the last two thirds of it he wrote in a week or less”.\n\nThe finished film was released briefly in 1947, then shelved by producer Hughes. Hughes issued a recut version of the film in 1951 through RKO under the title Mad Wednesday. Such was Lloyd’s disdain that he sued Howard Hughes, the California Corporation and RKO for damages to his reputation “as an outstanding motion picture star and personality”, eventually accepting a $30,000 settlement.\n\nGerman poster for The Sin of Harold Diddlebock AKA Mad Wednesday (Preston Sturges, 1947)\n\nRadio and retirement\n\nIn October 1944, Lloyd emerged as the director and host of The Old Gold Comedy Theater, an NBC radio anthology series, after Preston Sturges, who had turned the job down, recommended him for it. The show presented half-hour radio adaptations of recently successful film comedies, beginning with Palm Beach Story with Claudette Colbert and Robert Young.\n\nRehearsing the script for “The Palm Beach Story” are Robert Young, Harold Lloyd and Claudette Colbert – The Old Gold Comedy Theatre\n\nSome saw The Old Gold Comedy Theater as being a lighter version of Lux Radio Theater, and it featured some of the best-known film and radio personalities of the day, including Fred Allen, June Allyson, Lucille Ball, Ralph Bellamy, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Herbert Marshall, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Jane Wyman, and Alan Young.\n\nBut the show’s half-hour format—which meant the material might have been truncated too severely—and Lloyd’s sounding somewhat ill at ease on the air for much of the season (though he spent weeks training himself to speak on radio prior to the show’s premiere, and seemed more relaxed toward the end of the series run) may have worked against it.\n\nThe Old Gold Comedy Theater ended in June 1945 with an adaptation of Tom, Dick and Harry, featuring June Allyson and Reginald Gardiner and was not renewed for the following season. Many years later, acetate discs of 29 of the shows were discovered in Lloyd’s home, and they now circulate among old-time radio collectors.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Dick Powell – The Old Gold Comedy Theatre\n\nLloyd remained involved in a number of other interests, including civic and charity work. Inspired by having overcome his own serious injuries and burns, he was very active as a Freemason and Shriner with the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children.\n\nHe was a Past Potentate of Al-Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles, and was eventually selected as Imperial Potentate of the Shriners of North America for the year 1949–50.[14] At the installation ceremony for this position on July 25, 1949, 90,000 people were present at Soldier Field, including then sitting U.S. President Harry S Truman, also a 33° Scottish Rite Mason.[15] In recognition of his services to the nation and Freemasonry, Bro. Lloyd was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour in 1955 and coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, 33°, in 1965.\n\nHarold Lloyd in 1946, when he was appointed to the Shriners’ publicity committee\n\nHe appeared as himself on several television shows during his retirement, first on Ed Sullivan‘s variety show Toast of the Town June 5, 1949, and again on July 6, 1958. He appeared as the Mystery Guest on What’s My Line? on April 26, 1953, and twice on This Is Your Life: on March 10, 1954 for Mack Sennett, and again on December 14, 1955, on his own episode. During both appearances, Lloyd’s hand injury can clearly be seen.[16]\n\nHarold Lloyd on This is Your Life in 1950’s\n\nLloyd studied colors and microscopy, and was very involved with photography, including 3D photography and color film experiments. Some of the earliest 2-color Technicolor tests were shot at his Beverly Hills home (These are included as extra material in the Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection DVD Box Set).\n\nHarold Lloyd’s 3 D Photography Album\n\nHe became known for his nude photographs of models, such as Bettie Page and stripper Dixie Evans, for a number of men’s magazines. He also took photos of Marilyn Monroe lounging at his pool in a bathing suit, which were published after her death. In 2004, his granddaughter Suzanne produced a book of selections from his photographs, Harold Lloyd’s Hollywood Nudes in 3D! (ISBN 1-57912-394-5).\n\nHarold Lloyd’s 3 D Photography Album\n\nLloyd also provided encouragement and support for a number of younger actors, such as Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner, and particularly Jack Lemmon, whom Harold declared as his own choice to play him in a movie of his life and work.\n\nMarilyn Monroe photographed by Harold Lloyd\n\nMarilyn Monroe photographed by Harold Lloyd during a photo session with Philippe Halsman, 1952\n\nMarilyn Monroe photographed by Harold Lloyd\n\nRenewed interest\n\nLloyd kept copyright control of most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement.\n\nLloyd did not grant cinematic release because most theaters could not accommodate an organist, and Lloyd did not wish his work to be accompanied by a pianist: “I just don’t like pictures played with pianos.\n\nWe never intended them to be played with pianos.” Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyd’s price was high: “I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That’s a high price, but if I don’t get it, I’m not going to show it. They’ve come close to it, but they haven’t come all the way up”.\n\nAs a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more available. Lloyd’s film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Mildred Davis in 1935\n\nIn the early 1960s, Lloyd produced two compilation films, featuring scenes from his old comedies, Harold Lloyd’s World of Comedy and The Funny Side of Life.\n\nThe first film was premiered at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, where Lloyd was fêted as a major rediscovery. The renewed interest in Lloyd helped restore his status among film historians.\n\nThroughout his later years he screened his films for audiences at special charity and educational events, to great acclaim, and found a particularly receptive audience among college audiences: “Their whole response was tremendous because they didn’t miss a gag; anything that was even a little subtle, they got it right away.”\n\nLobby cards for Harold Lloyd’s World of Comedy (Harold Lloyd, 1962)\n\nPoster for The Funny Side of Life (Harry Kerwin, 1963)\n\nFollowing his death, and after extensive negotiations, most of his feature films were leased to Time-Life Films in 1974.\n\nAs Tom Dardis confirms: “Time-Life prepared horrendously edited musical-sound-track versions of the silent films, which are intended to be shown on TV at sound speed [24 frames per second], and which represent everything that Harold feared would happen to his best films”.[citation needed]\n\nTime-Life released the films as half-hour television shows, with two clips per show. These were often near-complete versions of the early two-reelers, but also included extended sequences from features such as Safety Last! (terminating at the clock sequence) and Feet First (presented silent, but with Walter Scharf‘s score from Lloyd’s own 1960s re-release).\n\nBelgian poster for Safety Last (Fred C Newmeyer, Sam Taylor, 1923)\n\nTime-Life released several of the feature films more or less intact, also using some of Scharf’s scores which had been commissioned by Lloyd. The Time-Life clips series included a narrator rather than intertitles. Various narrators were used internationally: the English-language series was narrated by Henry Corden.\n\nThe Time-Life series was frequently repeated by the BBC in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, and in 1990 a Thames Television documentary, Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius was produced by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, following two similar series based on Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.[17] Composer Carl Davis wrote a new score for Safety Last! which he performed live during a showing of the film with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra to great acclaim in 1993.[18]\n\nHarold Lloyd, The Third Genius (Kevin Brownlow, David Gill, 1990)\n\nHarold Lloyd, The Third Genius (Kevin Brownlow, David Gill, 1990) – VHS Release\n\nThe Brownlow and Gill documentary was shown as part of the PBS series American Masters, and created a renewed interest in Lloyd’s work in the United States, but the films were largely unavailable.\n\nIn 2002, the Harold Lloyd Trust re-launched Harold Lloyd with the publication of the book Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian by Jeffrey Vance and Suzanne Lloyd[19][20] and a series of feature films and short subjects called “The Harold Lloyd Classic Comedies” produced by Jeffrey Vance and executive produced by Suzanne Lloyd for Harold Lloyd Entertainment.\n\nThe new cable television and home video versions of Lloyd’s great silent features and many shorts were remastered with new orchestral scores by Robert Israel. These versions are frequently shown on the Turner Classic Movies(TCM) cable channel.\n\nA DVD collection of these restored or remastered versions of his feature films and important short subjects was released by New Line Cinema in partnership with the Harold Lloyd Trust in 2005, along with theatrical screenings in the US, Canada, and Europe. Criterion Collection has subsequently acquired the home video rights to the Lloyd library, and have released Safety Last!,[21] The Freshman,[22] and Speedy.[23]\n\nSafety Last – Criterion Collection Blu Ray Special Edition\n\nThe Freshman – Criterion Collection – Dual Format Edition\n\nThe Freshman – Criterion Collection – Blu Ray Special Edition\n\nIn the June 2006 Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program book for Safety Last!, film historian Jeffrey Vance stated that Robert A. Golden, Lloyd’s assistant director, routinely doubled for Harold Lloyd between 1921 and 1927. According to Vance, Golden doubled Lloyd in the bit with Harold shimmy shaking off the building’s ledge after a mouse crawls up his trousers.[24]\n\nHarold Lloyd Comedy Collection – DVD Release\n\nPersonal life\n\nLloyd married his leading lady Mildred Davis on February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles, California.[25]\n\nHarold Lloyd and Mildred Davis in a publicity photo for High And Dizzy (Hal Roach, 1920)\n\nHarold Lloyd, Mildred Davis and Douglas Fairbanks\n\nThey had two children together: Gloria Lloyd (1923-2012)[26][27] and Harold Clayton Lloyd Jr. (1931–1971).[28] They also adopted Gloria Freeman (1924—1986) in September 1930, whom they renamed Marjorie Elizabeth Lloyd but was known as “Peggy” for most of her life.\n\nLloyd discouraged Davis from continuing her acting career. He later relented but by that time her career momentum was lost. Davis died from a heart attack in 1969, two years before Lloyd’s death.\n\nThough her real age was a guarded secret, a family spokesperson at the time indicated she was 66 years old. Lloyd’s son was gay and, according to Annette D’Agostino Lloyd (no relation) in the book Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian, Harold Sr. took this in good spirit. Harold Jr. died from complications of a stroke three months after his father.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Mildred Davis\n\nHarold Lloyd and Freemasons\n\nHarold Lloyd at Al Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles\n\nLloyd’s Beverly Hills home, “Greenacres“, was built in 1926–1929, with 44 rooms, 26 bathrooms, 12 fountains, 12 gardens, and a nine-hole golf course. A portion of Lloyd’s personal inventory of his silent films (then estimated to be worth $2 million) was destroyed in August 1943 when his film vault caught fire. Seven firemen were overcome while inhaling chlorine gas from the blaze.\n\nLloyd himself was saved by his wife, who dragged him to safety outdoors after he collapsed at the door of the film vault. The fire spared the main house and outbuildings. After attempting to maintain the home as a museum of film history, as Lloyd had wished, the Lloyd family sold it to a developer in 1975.\n\nHarold Lloyd house fire\n\nHarold Lloyd Estate\n\nThe grounds were subsequently subdivided but the main house and the estate’s principal gardens remain and are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films like Westworld and The Loved One. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGreenacres was built in the 1920s in Beverly Hills, one of Los Angeles’ all-white planned communities.[29] The area had restrictive covenants prohibiting non-whites (this also included Jews[30]) from living there unless they were in the employment of a white resident (typically as a domestic servant).[31]:57\n\nIn 1940, Lloyd supported a neighborhood improvement association in Beverly Hills that attempted to enforce the all-white covenant in court after a number of black actors and businessmen had begun buying properties in the area.\n\nHowever, in his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke dismissed the action stating that it was time that “members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment.”[32] In 1948 the United States Supreme Court declared in Shelley v. Kraemer that all racially restrictive covenants in the United States were unenforceable.[33]\n\nDeath\n\nLloyd died at age 77 from prostate cancer on March 8, 1971, at his Greenacres home in Beverly Hills, California.[12][34][35]\n\nHe was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.[36] His former co-star Bebe Daniels died eight days after him and his son Harold Lloyd Jr.died three months after him.[citation needed]\n\nThe crypt of Harold Lloyd, in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale\n\nHonors\n\nIn 1927, his was only the fourth concrete ceremony at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, preserving his handprints, footprints, and autograph, along with the outline of his famed glasses (which were actually a pair of sunglasses with the lenses removed).[37][38] The ceremony took place directly in front of the Hollywood Masonic Temple, which was the meeting place of the Masonic lodge to which he belonged.[39]\n\nHarold Lloyd hand and foot prints\n\nLloyd was honoured in 1960 for his contribution to motion pictures with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1503 Vine Street.[40] In 1994, he was honoured with his image on a United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.[41][42]\n\nIn 1953, Lloyd received an Academy Honorary Award for being a “master comedian and good citizen”. The second citation was a snub to Chaplin, who at that point had fallen foul of McCarthyism and had his entry visa to the United States revoked. Regardless of the political overtones, Lloyd accepted the award in good spirit.\n\nFilmography\n\nSee also\n\nList of American comedy films\n\nList of Notable Freemasons\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nAgee, James (2000) [1958]. “Comedy’s Greatest Era” from Life magazine (9/5/1949), reprinted in Agee on Film.

She won the 1948 Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 1947 film The Farmer’s Daughter and received an Oscar nomination for her role in Come to the Stable in 1949.\n\nYoung moved to the relatively new medium of television, where she had a dramatic anthology series, The Loretta Young Show, from 1953 to 1961. The series earned three Emmy Awards and was rerun successfully on daytime TV and later in syndication.\n\nIn the 1980s, Young returned to the small screen and won a Golden Globe for her role in Christmas Dove in 1986. Young, a devout Roman Catholic,[1][2] worked with various Catholic charities after her acting career.[1][3]\n\nEarly life\n\nLoretta Young\n\nShe was born Gretchen Young in Salt Lake City, Utah, the daughter of Gladys (née Royal) and John Earle Young.[4][5] At confirmation, she took the name Michaela. When she was two years old, her parents separated, and when she was three, her family and she moved to Hollywood. Her sisters Polly Ann and Elizabeth Jane (better known as Sally Blane) and she worked as child actresses, but of the three, Gretchen was the most successful.\n\nThe Primrose Ring (Robert Z Leonard, 1917) – Loretta Young’s First Film Role\n\nYoung’s first role was at the age of three, in the silent film The Primrose Ring. During her high-school years, she was educated at Ramona Convent Secondary School. She was signed to a contract by John McCormick (1893–1961), the husband and manager of the actress Colleen Moore, who saw the young girl’s potential.[6] The name Loretta was given to her by Moore, who later explained that it was the name of her favorite doll.[7]\n\nLoretta Young aged 14\n\nLoretta Young aged 15\n\nLoretta Young aged 15\n\nLoretta Young aged 14\n\nCareer\n\nFilm\n\nYoung was billed as Gretchen Young in the silent film Sirens of the Sea (1917). She was first billed as Loretta Young in 1928, in The Whip Woman. That same year, she co-starred with Lon Chaney in the MGM film Laugh, Clown, Laugh. The next year, she was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars.[8]\n\nSirens of the Sea (Allen Holubar, 1917) billed as Gretchen Young\n\nThe Whip Woman (Allan Dwan, 1928) first billed as Loretta Young\n\nLaugh Clown Laugh (Herbert Brenon, 1928) Loretta Young with Lon Chaney\n\nHer silent films were followed up by a string of very successful Pre Code features. They included The Squall (Alexander Korda, 1929), Three Girls Lost (Sidney Lanfield, 1931), The Right of Way (Frank Lloyd, 1931), Platinum Blonde (Frank Capra, 1931), The Way of Life AKA They Call It Sin (Thornton Freeland, 1932), Taxi (Roy Del Ruth, 1932), Play Girl (Ray Enright, 1932), Working Wives AKA Week-End Marriage (Thornton Freeland, 1932), The Devil’s In Love (William Dieterle, 1933).\n\nYoung excelled in two seminal Pre Code films – Heroes for Sale (William Wellman, 1933) and Employees’ Entrance (Roy Del Ruth, 1933) and her deeply emotional performances helped her in becoming a major studio star.\n\nLoretta Young in Squall (Alexander Korda, 1929)\n\nLoretta Young with John Wayne in Three Girls Lost (Sidney Lanfield, 1931)\n\nLoretta Young with Conrad Nagel in The Right Of Way (Frank Lloyd, 1931)\n\nLoretta Young with Robert Williams and Jean Harlow in Platinum Blonde (Frank Capra, 1931)\n\nLoretta Young with George Brent and Una Merkel in They Call It Sin AKA The Way of Life (Thornton Freeland, 1932)\n\nLoretta Young with James Cagney in Taxi (Roy Del Ruth,1932)\n\nLoretta Young with Norman Foster and Winnie Lightner in Play Girl (Ray Enright, 1932)\n\nLoretta Young with Norman Foster and Aline MacMahon in Working Wives AKA Week-End Marriage (Thornton Freeland, 1932)\n\nLoretta Young with Victor Jory and Vivienne Osborne in The Devil’s In Love (William Dieterle, 1933)\n\nLoretta Young with Richard Barthelmess and Aline MacMahon in Heroes For Sale (William Wellman, 1933)\n\nLoretta Young with Warren William and Wallace Ford in Employees’ Entrance (Roy Del Ruth, 1933)\n\nIn 1930, when she was 17, she eloped with the 26-year-old actor Grant Withers; they were married in Yuma, Arizona. The marriage was annulled the next year, just as their second movie together (ironically entitled Too Young to Marry) was released.\n\nLoretta Young and Grant Withers\n\nThe Second Floor Mystery (Roy Del Ruth, 1930) Loretta Young and Grant Withers\n\nLoretta Young and Grant Withers\n\nIn 1935, she co-starred with Clark Gable and Jack Oakie in the film version of Jack London’s The Call of the Wild, directed by William Wellman.\n\nLoretta Young and Clark Gable in Call of the Wild (William Wellman, 1935)\n\nLoretta Young and Clark Gable in Call of the Wild (William Wellman, 1935)\n\nLoretta Young and Clark Gable in Call of the Wild (William Wellman, 1935)\n\nLoretta Young and Clark Gable in Call of the Wild (William Wellman, 1935)\n\nDuring World War II, Young made Ladies Courageous (1944; reissued as Fury in the Sky), the fictionalized story of the Women’s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron. It depicted a unit of female pilots who flew bomber planes from the factories to their final destinations. Young made as many as eight movies a year.\n\nLadies Courageous AKA Fury in the Sky (John Rawlins, 1944)\n\nLadies Courageous AKA Fury in the Sky (John Rawlins, 1944)\n\nIn 1947, she won an Oscar for her performance in The Farmer’s Daughter. That same year, she co-starred with Cary Grant and David Niven in The Bishop’s Wife, a perennial favorite. In 1949, she received another Academy Award nomination for Come to the Stable. In 1953, she appeared in her last theatrical film, It Happens Every Thursday, a Universal comedy about a New York couple who move to California to take over a struggling weekly newspaper; her costar was John Forsythe.\n\nLoretta Young with her Academy Award for The Farmer’s Daughter (HC Potter, 1947\n\nLoretta Young in The Farmer’s Daughter (HC Potter, 1947)\n\nLoretta Young in The Bishop’s Wife (Henry Koster, 1947)\n\nLoretta Young in Come to the Stable (Henry Koster, 1949)\n\nLoretta Young in It Happens Every Thursday (Joseph Pevney, 1953)\n\nTelevision\n\nYoung hosted and starred in the well-received half-hour anthology television series Letter to Loretta (soon retitled The Loretta Young Show), which was originally broadcast from 1953 to 1961.\n\nShe earned three Emmy awards for the program. Her trademark was a dramatic entrance through a living-room door in various high-fashion evening gowns. She returned at the program’s conclusion to offer a brief passage from the Bible or a famous quote that reflected upon the evening’s story.\n\n(Young’s introductions and concluding remarks were not rerun on television because she legally stipulated that they not be, as she did not want the dresses she wore in those segments to make the program seem dated.) The program ran in prime time on NBC for eight years, the longest-running primetime network program hosted by a woman up to that time.[citation needed]\n\nAncient Egypt Photograph – The Loretta Young Show, Aka Letter To by Everett\n\nThe program was based on the premise that each drama was in answer to a question asked in her fan mail. The title was changed to The Loretta Young Show during the first season (as of the episode of February 14, 1954), and the “letter” concept was dropped at the end of the second season. Towards the end of the second season, Young was hospitalized as a result of overwork, which required a number of guest hosts and guest stars; her first appearance in the 1955–56 season was for the Christmas show. From then on, Young appeared in only about half of each season’s shows as an actress and served as the program’s host for the remainder.\n\nMinus Young’s introductions and conclusions, the series was rerun as the Loretta Young Theatre in daytime by NBC from 1960 to 1964. It also appeared in syndicationinto the early 1970s, before being withdrawn.\n\nIn the 1962–1963 television season, Young appeared as Christine Massey, a freelance magazine writer and the mother of seven children, in The New Loretta Young Show, on CBS. It fared poorly in the ratings on Monday evenings against ABC‘s Ben Casey. It was dropped after one season of 26 episodes.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1990s, selected episodes from Young’s personal collection, with the opening and closing segments (and original title) intact, were released on home video, and frequently were shown on cable television.[citation needed]\n\nOn the set of The Loretta Young Show\n\nAwards\n\nIn 1988, she received the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women, who through their endurance and the excellence of their work, helped to expand the role of women in the entertainment industry.[9]\n\nYoung has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for her work in television, at 6135 Hollywood Boulevard, and the other for her work in motion pictures, at 6100 Hollywood Boulevard.[10] In 2011, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars, in Palm Springs, California, was dedicated to her.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\nYoung was married to the actor Grant Withers from 1930 to 1931.\n\nFrom September 1933 to June 1934, she had a public affair with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in Man’s Castle.[12] She married the producer Tom Lewis in 1940; they divorced bitterly in the mid-1960s.\n\nLewis died in 1988. They had two sons, Peter Lewis (of the San Francisco rock band Moby Grape) and Christopher Lewis, a film director. Young married the fashion designer Jean Louis in 1993. He died in 1997. Young was godmother to Marlo Thomas (daughter of the TV star Danny Thomas).[13]\n\nWith Grant Withers in Too Young To Marry (Mervyn LeRoy, 1931)\n\nWith Spencer Tracy in Man’s Castle (Frank Borzage, 1933)\n\nWith Tom Lewis on their wedding day\n\nWith Tom Lewis and children\n\nWith her last husband Jean Louis\n\nPregnancy by Clark Gable\n\nYoung and Clark Gable were the romantic leads of the 1935 Twentieth Century Pictures film The Call of the Wild, which was filmed early in that year. Young was then 22 years old, while Gable was 34 and married (to Maria “Ria” Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham). During the filming, Gable impregnated Young.\n\nLoretta Young with Clark Gable\n\nFor the next 80 years, those who knew of Gable’s paternity widely assumed the pregnancy to be the result of an affair between the two. However, in 2015, Linda Lewis, Young’s daughter-in-law (and Christopher Lewis’s wife) stated publicly that, in 1998, Young told Lewis that Gable had raped her and that, though the two had flirted on set, there had been no affair and no intimate contact save for that one incident.[14]\n\nYoung had not revealed the information before to anyone. According to Lewis, Young only stated it after having learned of the concept of date rape; she had previously always believed that it was a woman’s job to fend off men’s amorous advances and had felt the fact that Gable had been able to force himself on her was thus a moral failing on her part.[14]\n\nLoretta Young with Clark Gable\n\nYoung, her sisters and her mother came up with a plan to hide the pregnancy and then pass off the child as an adopted child.[14] Young did not want to damage her career or Gable’s, and she knew that, if Twentieth Century Pictures found out about the pregnancy, they would try to pressure her to have an abortion, which Young, a devout Catholic, considered a mortal sin.[14]\n\nWhen the pregnancy began to show, Young went on a “vacation” to England, and several months later returned to California. Shortly before the birth, she gave an interview from her bed, covered in blankets, stating that her long movie absence was due to a condition she had had since childhood. Young gave birth to Judith Young on November 6, 1935, in a house that she and her mother owned in Venice, California. Young named Judith after St. Jude, because he was the patron saint of (among other things) difficult situations.[14]\n\nLoretta Young and her daughter Judith\n\nThree weeks later, Young returned to moviemaking. After several months of living in the house in Venice, Judy was transferred to St. Elizabeth’s, an orphanage outside Los Angeles. When she was 19 months old, her grandmother picked her up, and Young announced to gossip columnist Louella Parsons that she had adopted the infant.\n\nFew in Hollywood were fooled by the ruse, and the child’s true parentage was widely rumored in entertainment circles. Young refused to confirm or comment publicly on the rumors until 1999, when Joan Wester Anderson wrote Young’s authorized biography. In interviews with Anderson for the book, Young stated that Judy was her biological child and the product of a brief affair with Gable.[15] The child was raised as Judy Lewis,[16] taking the last name of Young’s second husband.\n\nLoretta Young and Judith Lewis in 1960s\n\nJudy Lewis wrote in her autobiography, Uncommon Knowledge, that some people made fun of her because of the prominent ears she had inherited from her father. She states that at seven she had an operation to “pin back” her large ears and that her mother always had her wear bonnets as a child.\n\nIn 1958, Lewis’s future husband, Joseph Tinney, told her “everybody” knew that Gable was her biological father. The only time she remembered Gable visiting her was once at her home when she was a teenager; she had no idea he was her biological father.\n\nLoretta Young, Clark Gable and Judy Lewis\n\nSeveral years later he appeared on The Loretta Young Show after Young had been in hospital for several months. Lewis was an assistant and was right behind her mother when she noticed Gable. They never had a relationship, and she never saw him again.[17]Several years later, after becoming a mother herself, Lewis finally confronted her mother, who privately admitted the truth, stating that Judy was “a walking mortal sin.”[18]\n\nLinda Lewis said the family stayed silent about the date rape claim until after both Loretta Young and Judy Lewis had died.[14]\n\nJudy Lewis\n\nPolitics\n\nYoung was a lifelong Republican.[19] In 1952, she appeared in radio, print, and magazine ads in support of Dwight D. Eisenhower in his campaign for President.\n\nShe attended his inauguration in 1953, along with Anita Louise, Louella Parsons, Jane Russell, Dick Powell, June Allyson, and Lou Costello, among others.\n\nShe was a vocal supporter of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their presidential campaigns in 1968 and 1980, respectively.[20] Young was also an active member of the Hollywood Republican Committee, with her close friend Irene Dunne and Ginger Rogers, William Holden, George Murphy, Fred Astaire, and John Wayne.[21]\n\nLoretta Young with John Wayne, Lew Cody and Joan Marsh – promo for Three Girls Lost (Sidney Lanfield, 1931)\n\nLater life\n\nFrom the time of Young’s retirement in the 1960s until not long before her death, she devoted herself to volunteer work for charities and churches with her friends of many years: Jane Wyman, Irene Dunne, and Rosalind Russell.[22] She was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.[23] Young briefly came out of retirement to star in two television films, Christmas Eve (1986) and Lady in the Corner (1989).\n\nLoretta Young with Judy Lewis attending a charitable event\n\nShe won a Golden Globe Award for the former and was nominated again for the latter.[24]\n\nIn 1972, a jury in Los Angeles awarded Young $550,000 in a lawsuit against NBC for breach of contract. Filed in 1966, the suit contended that NBC had allowed foreign television outlets to rerun old episodes of The Loretta Young Show without excluding, as agreed by the parties, the opening segment in which Young made her entrance. Young testified that her image had been damaged by portraying her in “outdated gowns.” She had sought damages of $1.9 million.[25]\n\nLoretta Young in Christmas Eve (1986)\n\nLoretta Young in Lady in the Corner (1989)\n\nDeath\n\nYoung died of ovarian cancer on August 12, 2000, at the home of her half-sister, Georgiana Montalbán[26] (the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban), in Santa Monica, California.\n\nShe was interred in the family plot in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Her ashes were buried in the grave of her mother, Gladys Belzer.[27][28] Her elder sisters had both died from cancer, as did her daughter, Judy Lewis, on November 25, 2011, at the age of 76.\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1917 The Primrose Ring Fairy Lost; uncredited 1917 Sirens of the Sea Child As Gretchen Young 1919 The Only Way Child on operating table 1921 White and Unmarried Child Uncredited 1921 The Sheik Arab child Extant; uncredited 1927 Naughty but Nice Bit part Lost; uncredited 1927 Her Wild Oat Bit by ping pong table Extant; uncredited 1928 The Whip Woman The Girl Lost 1928 Laugh, Clown, Laugh Simonetta Extant; made at MGM 1928 The Magnificent Flirt Denise Laverne Lost; made at Paramount Pictures 1928 The Head Man Carol Watts Lost 1928 Scarlet Seas Margaret Barbour Lost (Vitaphone track of music and effects survives) 1929 Seven Footprints to Satan One of Satan’s victims Extant; uncredited 1929 The Squall Irma Extant, in Library of Congress 1929 The Girl in the Glass Cage Gladys Cosgrove Lost 1929 Fast Life Patricia Mason Stratton Lost (Vitaphone soundtrack discs at UCLA Film and Television) 1929 The Careless Age Muriel Lost 1929 The Forward Pass Patricia Carlyle Lost 1929 The Show of Shows “Meet My Sister” number Extant, in Library of Congress 1930 Loose Ankles Ann Harper Berry Extant, in Library of Congress 1930 The Man from Blankley’s Margery Seaton Lost (Vitaphone soundtrack discs at UCLA Film and Television) 1930 Show Girl in Hollywood Extant, in Library of Congress; uncredited 1930 The Second Floor Mystery Marion Ferguson Extant, in Library of Congress 1930 Road to Paradise Mary Brennan/Margaret Waring Extant, in Library of Congress 1930 Warner Bros.
