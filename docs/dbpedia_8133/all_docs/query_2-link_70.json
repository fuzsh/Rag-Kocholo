        "text": "The GB DIVIDE route runs the length of Britain, linking its wild places with its rich industrial past. Riders will experience a diverse range of geographies and micro cultures to give them a unique perspective of the rich history that has shaped the British Isles. Bursting with climbs and technical descents, this route will reward those with versatile ‘all-road’ setups and attitudes… expect road, gravel, singletrack, and everything in between.\n\nPhotos by Dan Monghan and Gruber Images\n\nWe sought to utilise the versatility of ‘all-road’ bikes by designing a route that links GB’s most remote off-road riding via small roads, following the most direct natural line possible. The route passes through several National Parks (NP), areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and other mountain ranges including Exmoor NP, Quantock Hills AONB, Mendip Hills AONB, Brecon Beacons NP, Cambrian Mountains (aka the Desert of Wales), Snowdonia NP, Yorkshire Dales NP, North Pennines AONB, Kielder Forest Park, Scottish Borders, Loch Lomond & the Trossachs NP, Cairngorm NP, and the Scottish Highlands. With ~30,000m of climbing packed into the ~2,000km route, this is one for the mountain lovers.\n\nThe route also pays homage to Britain’s past, passing sights such as Bristol’s Clifton Suspension Bridge and the Falkirk Wheel, as well as providing a glimpse into vibrant city life by passing through Manchester city centre. It will also give riders an insight into the similarities and differences of the three countries that make up Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland). It is also full of contrasts; from the buzz of city life to the remoteness of Wales and the Highlands; from remnants of dark satanic mills to state-of-the-art wind farms; from fast road/gravel sections to singletrack and the odd hike-a-bike.\n\nDifficulty\n\nMuch of the GB DIVIDE is on road and easy forestry tracks and is designed for gravel bikes. That said, many of the singletrack sections and mountain passes are more suited to mountain bikes (e.g. in Scotland, much of the route follows the easier bits of the Highland Trail 550 route). Riding a fully loaded gravel bike over this terrain takes skill and patience, with inevitable hike-a-bike sections in some places. In addition, despite the island’s high population density, the route can be devoid of resupply points for significant periods, particularly in Wales, northern England, and the Highlands.\n\nRoute Development\n\nThe route was created by Miles Resso, but it has been a collaborative effort from leading members of The Racing Collective; shout out to Ed Wolstenholme, Stu Allan, Liam Glen, Tom Probert, Luke Douglas, Katherine Moore, and many others for participating in the plan-recce-refine feedback loop. The route also makes use of several existing routes such as parts of the HT550, the Badger Divide, and the Second City Divide.\n\nIn theory the route follows the watershed (hence the name GB Divide), but geography was never our strong point and we make no apologies for deviating wildly from this theoretical line in order to take in the beauty of mid-Wales for instance. Some also claim the route should start in SE England rather than SW England but we don’t see the logic given the North Sea and English Channel are all part of the Atlantic, and besides, we’ll take Cornwall over the M25 any day.\n\nThe route is used for The Racing Collective’s GBDURO where it’s broken down into four timed stages, with the rider with the lowest aggregate time winning… nothing. The route was first completed by Lachlan Morton (EF Education First) on 28 June 2019 during the inaugural #GBDURO19 ride—make sure to watch the film.\n\nWe have deliberately provided minimum information (such as resupply waypoints etc) for this route as not knowing, and finding out, is half the appeal. A big reason for devising this route was to show UK based riders that they do not have to get on a plane to have an ‘adventure’; listing every water/food stop, dodgy hike-a-bike/singletrack section, etc etc would dumb it down and diminish future riders’ experience. So please respect our wishes and help preserve the unknown nature of this route for future riders to enjoy.\n\nOther rules for completing the route as an ITT are provided on the GB DIVIDE website.\n\nTerms of Use: As with each bikepacking route guide published on BIKEPACKING.com, should you choose to cycle this route, do so at your own risk.
