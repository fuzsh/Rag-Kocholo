Members present: Representatives Whitfield, Sullivan, Shimkus, Terry, Burgess, Scalise, McMorris Rodgers, Olson, McKinley, Gardner, Pompeo, Griffith, Barton, Rush, Castor, Dingell, Markey, Green, Capps, Doyle, and Waxman (ex officio). Staff present: Maryam Brown, Chief Counsel, Energy and Power; Allison Busbee, Legislative Clerk; Patrick Currier, Counsel, Energy and Power; Cory Hicks, Policy Coordinator, Energy and Power; Heidi King, Chief Economist; Ben Lieberman, Counsel, Energy and Power; Mary Neumayr, Senior Energy Counsel; Alison Cassady, Democratic Senior Professional Staff Member; Greg Dotson, Democratic Energy and Environment Staff Director; Caitlin Haberman, Democratic Policy Analyst; Elizabeth Letter, Democratic Assistant Press Secretary; and Alexandra Teitz, Democratic Senior Counsel, Environment and Energy. Mr. Whitfield. Today's hearing will come to order. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ED WHITFIELD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY Today we are going to focus on the cost and impact of the Utility MACT rule, or as EPA prefers to call it, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard. When the President was a candidate for the office he now holds, he attended a meeting in San Francisco, a fundraiser, and at that fundraiser, he made the comment that we will bankrupt the coal industry in America. While his administration was unsuccessful in passing the cap and trade legislation, the President was quoted after that failure as saying that ``there is more than one way to skin a cat.'' And he was right, because EPA did become the lead agency to significantly damage the coal industry in America, the industry that provides the base load for electricity in this country. When I talk about the coal industry, I am talking about the coal mining industry, yes, I am talking about utilities that burn coal as well. And with this new rule, EPA has made it very clear that in this area, they are not concerned about--they are not setting environmental policy, they are setting energy policy for America. More than one expert in the field has said that the stringency of the new unit--electric generating units that use coal standard means that under this rule, not one new coal- fired plant can be built and meet these standards, because no one can get a warranty which is necessary to get the financing to build a unit because of the Frankenplant standard that EPA is using. Now, the sad thing about it is when we asked about the cost of this regulation, EPA gives us no cost. In fact, they made the comment that that is not useful. But they did go out to the year 2016, they said that in 2016 that this would cost $9.6 billion that year. And of course, that is calculated by you borrow the money to meet these requirements, and the payment on that year will be $9.6 billion. We have repeatedly asked, we have sent questions, we have sent letters, we have called, asking for the total cost, and we still have no total cost. And we know that this is the most costly regulation relating to utilities that EPA has ever submitted. And the sad thing about it is, they do not even look at the cost of lost jobs. They said that the total gigawatts lost as a result of this regulation would be 4.7 gigawatts, and one company, FirstEnergy, has announced in the last few days the closure of plants that equals 3.3 gigawatts from one company. So I think EPA is misleading the American people and deliberately so, because when they talk about this regulation, all they talk about is mercury. The importance of reducing mercury and acid gases, and non-metallic components, and yet, when they did the benefit analysis of this rule, all of the benefits, with the exception of a very minute amount, comes from particulate matter, which was never even set out as a purpose of this regulation, to reduce particulate matter. Everyone you will hear today will talk about, oh, the mercury and how important it is we reduce that, and the benefits from that are minute. And I would just like to put on the slide real quick, the total global mercury emissions around the world are about 7,300 to 8,300 tons per year. About 70 percent of that is natural and U.S. utilities each year, out of that 8,300 tons per year worldwide, provides 29 tons of emissions of mercury. And the total benefit from this new regulation in reductions of mercury emissions in the U.S. will be about 20 tons per year, out of 8,300 worldwide. So I am quite disappointed in this regulation is going to have profound impact in a negative way on the American people and their ability to compete in the global marketplace. [The prepared statement of Mr. Whitfield follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.002 Mr. Whitfield. At this time, I would like to recognize for an opening statement the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Waxman of California. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the first 20 years after the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, visible air pollution decreased substantially. But we made very little progress on reducing toxic air pollution, the invisible heavy metals and other chemicals that cause cancer, brain damage, birth defects, and other devastating health problems. In the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, adopted by an overwhelming bipartisan majority on this committee, we addressed this issue: The new law directed EPA to set standards requiring industrial sources to use available pollution control technology to reduce their emissions of mercury, arsenic, and other toxic air pollution. Since 1990, EPA has adopted standards for almost every major industrial source of toxic air pollution. Every source, that is, except power plants, which emit more mercury than any other source. Owners of the dirtiest power plants have used political and legal tactics to block standards requiring them to clean up their pollution. When forced to act, the Bush administration issued weak standards for power plants that were scientifically and legally indefensible. The courts ultimately threw them out, forcing EPA back to the drawing board. Finally in December, after more than 20 years of study, litigation, and delay, EPA issued strong but achievable standards to cut toxic air pollution from America's dirtiest power plants. These new standards will cut emissions of toxic mercury by 90 percent. This is a major step forward. Exposure to mercury can damage the nervous system of infants and children, which can impair their ability to think and learn. We should be cheering this good news. But, instead, we are holding this hearing to criticize EPA for protecting the health of our children. Last year, the committee and House Republicans even voted to block EPA from acting. I think this committee has its priorities exactly backwards. We should be standing up for the health of infants and children, not the powerful coal and utility industries. These new standards will have tremendous health benefits. By cutting emissions of pollution that triggers asthma attacks and damages babies' brains, we could see up to $90 billion in health benefits every year. Ninety billion dollars in health benefits every year. These benefits far outweigh the costs of implementing these long overdue achievable pollution controls. We will hear from members today that these health benefits aren't real. But as you evaluate these claims, remember that some of the members who voted to deny that climate chang is real will be making these claims. We need to be guided by science. EPA's findings are supported by reams of peer-reviewed science on the health impacts of mercury and fine particles, including work by the independent EPA Science Advisory Board and the National Academy of Sciences. I am concerned about what is happening in this committee. Science denial should have no place in Congress. It is reckless and it is dangerous. If members have questions about our scientific understanding of air pollution and its health effects, bring in the researchers, bring in the experts and examine the peer- reviewed scientific literature. The last 40 years prove we can have both economic growth and a cleaner environment. We do not have to choose between jobs and toxic mercury pollution that endangers our children's brains. In fact, requiring power plants to invest capital and install modern pollution controls will create jobs. Fabricators and factory workers build the pollution controls, construction workers install them on the site, and skilled employees operate them. EPA says its rule will create 46,000 short-term construction jobs, and 8,000 long-term utility jobs. The EPA-- that is even more than the XL pipeline will create, in terms of jobs. The EPA rule will save American lives, protect our children from brain damage, clean up all polluting power plants, and even create jobs. I congratulate President Obama, Administrator Jackson, Assistant Administrator McCarthy, and the hardworking staff at EPA for finally getting the job done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE BARTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Barton. Thank you, Chairman Whitfield. Thank you, Ms. McCarthy, for once again coming before us. I have a prepared statement, and it is a very good prepared statement. I am going to put it in the record, but I am going to speak a little bit extemporaneously because I think this is a very important hearing. This Utility MACT rule is the most expensive regulation that has ever been proposed on the American economy, as far as I can tell. The annual estimated cost for the first 5 years is approximately $10 billion a year. It is estimated that by 2020 we are going to have a loss of about 1.5 million jobs, and the question is, what are the benefits? As you know, myself and others have sent a number of letters to you and the administrator, Mrs. Jackson, asking to try to flesh out these so-called benefits, these avoidable deaths and things of that sort. Mr. Waxman alluded to that in his opening statement. I have a letter that you signed to me. We received it 3 days ago, and it is the most extensive effort yet to try to comply with our request, so I am going to give a pat on the back for that. I have read it twice, and I honestly can tell you that I don't think you have told me anything. I think that we keep referring to these studies, these models. There is no real factual data in this response anywhere where they have gone out and done an emergency room study near a power plant and compared it to someone who lives in Yosemite National Park or something. I mean, you go from wherever you think the dirtiest area is to where you think the cleanest area is, compare those over time to get a base line for what the ambient environmental issues are, and then compare them. These are all models based on assumptions, and they are written in a way that the average person's eyes just glaze over it. I am going to keep trying. I am going to keep trying to understand it, and I am going to ask some people that are a lot smarter than me to take a look at it. But when Mr. Waxman said in his opening statement that these regulations could create 46,000 jobs--that is in your report that you put out with the rule--and I looked at that and, when you delved down into it, it is because of the increased jobs created to comply with the rule. Now, the more regulation you have, the more compliance cost you are going to have, but you are going to have to hire people, but they don't produce anything. If I go out and hire a coal miner and he digs an additional ton of coal a day, and that coal is burned to create electricity, there is something--a product is developed that is salable and that somebody uses. If I hire another compliance officer, he sits there and shovels paperwork all day. Now if the answer to our economic problem is more regulation so that we get more people hired for compliance, we could go out and start hiring people to go rob banks, so they would have to hire more bank guards for--to protect against the bank robbers. You would create jobs, but you would shut the bank down. Madam Administrator, I am afraid that is what we are doing right here. So I look forward to an honest debate. You are always honest in your answers. I appreciate that, but we have a fundamental disagreement about the result, and we hope to elaborate on that later. [The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.005 Mr. Barton. With that, I want to yield to Mr. Pompeo the remainder of my time. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE POMPEO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. Barton. You know, we will learn a lot about studies and reports and data today, but we don't have to go very far from where I live to see the real world impact of this rule. In Kansas, we have been trying to build a coal-fired power plant called Holcomb II for an awfully long time. It has been stopped by our former governor, our secretary of HHS through litigation, and it is a clean coal-fired power plant. This is a power plant that I would think environmentalists would advocate. We will retire some older coal. This is a good step forward, and yet, under the existing Utility MACT, I am anxious to talk to Assistant Administrator McCarthy today about how we are going to build that plant. I don't think it is possible. The company certainly doesn't. It hasn't been able to move forward on this for many, many years now so I am anxious to learn how under this new set of rules we can begin to continue to build coal-fired power plants in America. I think the Utility MACT rule is designed to create costs which prohibit that, and isn't about a good environmental policy but instead is about energy policy, trying to drive coal out as an affordable source for manufacturers and consumers all across the country. Mr. Pompeo. With that, I yield back to Mr. Barton. Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time is expired. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, for 5 minutes for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOBBY L. RUSH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, we are here today to hold yet another debate in a long series of subcommittee hearings on the costs associated with implementing the EPA's Utility MACT rules. I am curious to see, will we hear anything new or different from what we have already learned from the numerous hearings on this issue in the past? Mr. Chairman, I don't know, you know, I feel a sense of serious schizophrenia kind of settling in on this committee, because we have already passed the Train Act--to delay the rules and you know, with the majority's votes. Now we are saying well now, now that they are delayed, let us study them more. Let us look at the cost. Mr. Chairman, in all the hearings that we have had in the past, we have heard industry say that implementing these new Utility MACT rules will raise prices for everyone involved, and they advocate stalling and they are delaying these rules for five or ten or twenty more years down the road in order to give themselves more time to plan and prepare for the new standards? You know, Mr. Chairman, this schizophrenia in this committee, you know, yesterday we were saying let us hurry up and pass the legislation to force the administration to--within 30 days to approve the XL Keystone Pipeline. Another day, 24 hours later, we are saying let us stop, let us wait. Hold up. It reminds me of when I was in the service, you know, hurry up and wait. We were always running from here to there, running to the mess hall, running to this, running, and then you always had to wait in line. Hurry up and wait. So what we are doing here is yesterday we were hurrying up, and today we are saying let us wait. And those who subscribe from this horrific waiting and passing say that because many in the industry are not prepared for these new rules, they will have to shut down many old plants and spend money investing in retrofits and upgrades so they will be in compliance with the new MACT rules. Mr. Chairman, these folks have had years and years and years to prepare for these new rules. I am sensitive to the issue hiring as much as anyone on this subcommittee. My constituents that I represent want something just as important--and energy bills eat up a larger share of their hard-earned paycheck. But I believe it is a cop-out that we should scrap--to delay these new EPA rules, and give those who have been caught flat-footed more time to catch up, to get more forward thinking industry counterparts. Again, Mr. Chairman, my utilities--Edison, Exelon, they have already retrofitted their plants. They invested over a billion dollars. They were out in front of this. Now you are telling them that they didn't have to invest all of that money and they didn't have to take a very progressive and forward view? You are telling my constituents that what has happened is meaningless? Mr. Chairman, I think that these companies who did not take--see the writing on the wall, did not take this Congress seriously, did not take the work of this committee seriously, and decided that at the end of the day, they were going to try to manipulate the American people and manipulate this committee so that they have even more time, 10, 20 years to do something that is common sense and that is in the interest of the American people? I think, Mr. Chairman, that it is time for us now to try to deal--first of all, we have got to admit that we are a schizophrenic committee or subcommittee, and once we admit that we have got a problem, then we can get some help to try--an intervention to try to solve the problem. So let us--Mr. Chairman, I think this is a useless subcommittee, and I am glad that the administrator is here, but frankly, Ms. McCarthy, I think you have much more important work to do than to sit here and entertain us with the same old questions, the same old rigmarole, the same old game. You have got--the American people need you to be over doing your real work and not here entertaining us. Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Rush. Is there a psychiatrist in attendance this morning in the audience somewhere? Well, we have one person on the first panel this morning, and that is the Honorable Gina McCarthy, who is the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. McCarthy, thank you for joining us again today. We appreciate your taking time to come and talk about Utility MACT, or Mercury--or MATS, as you all call it. You are recognized for a period of 5 minutes, and at the end of that time, then we will go into a question-and-answer period. So you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF GINA MCCARTHY, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOR AIR AND RADIATION, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Ms. McCarthy. Thank you, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Rush, members of the committee. I really appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. Last December, EPA finalized the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, MATS. These standards required by the Clean Air Act are the first national standards to protect American families from power plant emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutions, like arsenic, acid gases, nickel, selenium, and cyanide. These long overdue standards will help make our children and our communities healthier. MATS will eliminate 20 tons of mercury emissions and hundreds of thousands of tons of acid gas and toxic pollution each year. The control equipment that reduces these toxic emissions also will reduce fine particle pollution. As a result, MATS will help protect children and adults from the effects of exposure to toxic air pollution, saving thousands of lives and preventing more than 100,000 heart and asthma attacks each year. We project that the annual public health benefits from MATS are $37 billion to $90 billion, far outweighing the annual projected cost of $9.6 billion. Technically, we know how to achieve these reductions. MATS relies on widely available, proven pollution controls that are already at use in more than half of the Nation's coal-fired power plants. These standards are affordable. EPA projects that electricity prices on average will rise only 3 percent as a result of MATS. With MATS and the cross-State rule combined, rates are projected to be well within the range of normal historic fluctuations, as this graph that is projected and as in my written comment shows. In addition, the updated standard will support thousands of good jobs for American workers who will be hired to build, install, and then operate the pollution control equipment. Furthermore, the country can achieve these reductions while maintaining a strong and reliable electric grid. Several EPA and Department of Energy analyses conclude that MATS will not adversely affect capacity reserve margins in any region of the country. A January 2012 Congressional Research Service report reached similar conclusions. The reliability concerns we heard were largely tied to concerns that 3 years was not enough time for compliance. We addressed those concerns. Sources would generally have over 4 years until the spring of 2016 to comply with MATS, and reliability critical units will have the opportunity for an additional year. All power plants will have at least 3 years. That is the compliance date that we established in the rules under the Clean Air Act. In addition, State or local permitting authorities can grant that additional year under certain circumstances. EPA recommends in its rule that this fourth year be broadly available to sources that require it for a wide range of activities, including constructing replacement power, upgrading transmission lines, maintaining reliability while other sources complete their compliance activities. My staff and I have already begun and we will continue to reach out to States to help develop clear, State-forward processes for requesting and granting these extensions. Additionally, EPA is providing a well-defined pathway for reliability critical units to get up to an additional year beyond the 4 years mentioned above by obtaining a schedule to achieve compliance with an additional year. This pathway is set forth in a policy memorandum from EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. While we don't foresee problems with the country maintaining a reliable electric grid as a result of our rules, we do believe that extra vigilance is appropriate to identify and address any potential localized reliability concerns that might arise. My staff and I have been and will continue to work with organizations that have the responsibility for maintaining the Nation's electricity reliability, including the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Resource Commission, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, and the Regional Transmission Organizations. We are working to help power plant owners understand their responsibilities, and remain confident that together, we do have the tools to address any challenges that may arise in connection with the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard. In summary, EPA's final MATS standard will reduce emissions of toxic air pollution from power plants. It will lead to healthier communities and a safer environment. For 40 years, we have been able to implement the Clean Air Act. We have been able to continue to grow the American economy, and we have kept the lights on. MATS will not change that. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. McCarthy follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.016 Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Ms. McCarthy. We appreciate your testimony very much. In the analysis that you provided the committee and that we have seen publically, you indicate that the annualized cost of this new regulation in the year 2015 will be $9.4 billion, and then you said that in 2020, it would be $8.6 billion, and in 2030 it will be 7.4 billion. How do you develop those annualized costs if you don't know what the total cost will be? Ms. McCarthy. Well, EPA follows the best practices as well as OMB guidance to develop the costs and benefits information. We use a standard best management practice for understanding what those annualized costs are. Mr. Whitfield. And what is the total cost? Ms. McCarthy. I do not have--the figures that you are asking me for, actually, Congressman Upton asked us for as well. Those are costs that we don't establish or---- Mr. Whitfield. So you don't have a total cost for this regulation? Ms. McCarthy. We have an annualized cost because the purpose of the cost---- Mr. Whitfield. Well, what is the annualized cost in 2016? Ms. McCarthy [continuing]. Compare costs and benefits. Mr. Whitfield. What is the annualized cost in 2016? Ms. McCarthy. The 9.6 billion is the annualized cost in 2016. That is compared to---- Mr. Whitfield. Nine point four billion in 2015? Ms. McCarthy. I am sorry? Mr. Whitfield. Nine point four billion in 2015. What is 2016? Ms. McCarthy. I believe it is 2016, but we can double- check. Mr. Whitfield. Well what is 2017? Ms. McCarthy. It would be less, but I don't have that exact figure. Mr. Whitfield. Do you have 2018? Ms. McCarthy. No, we used 2016 as the snapshot to compare both---- Mr. Whitfield. And when you look at these costs---- Ms. McCarthy [continuing]. Because it was the most conservative---- Mr. Whitfield [continuing]. Which you don't know the answer to, you don't know the total cost. When you look at cost, we have a number of letters from companies that have already announced they are closing down various coal-fired plants as a result of these regulations. Do you look at the cost--do you include the cost of a person who loses their job because of this regulation? Ms. McCarthy. We--in terms of our cost calculations, we look at the costs associated with the control equipment being purchased and installed, we look at the price of electricity and the changes---- Mr. Whitfield. But what about lost jobs? Do you look at that cost? Ms. McCarthy. We actually estimate in our analysis that this will actually create both short-term and long-term jobs. Mr. Whitfield. Do you look at the lost jobs, the cost of that? Ms. McCarthy. We look at benefits associated with increased job growth. Mr. Whitfield. Increased jobs, but do you look at lost jobs, the cost of that? Do you look at cost of a person who loses their health insurance and their family loses their health insurance? Do you consider that as a cost? Ms. McCarthy. I understand what you are asking, Mr. Chairman, but in this rule, we estimated that it would increase jobs, both short-term and long-term. Mr. Whitfield. OK. So you say it is going to increase jobs. We have plenty of experts who say it is going to lose jobs, but I find it rather appalling that this agency would issue a rule this widespread, this costly, and not even know what the total costs are. I mean, it is almost unbelievable that you would do this. And then, you know, another thing that is quite disturbing is just the name that you give it, Mercury Air Toxic--the MATS, and every time we hear people talk about it, we talk about oh, we are reducing mercury, we are reducing the acid gas, we are reducing the non-metallic components, and yet, all of the analyses indicate that the dollar value of the benefits from the reductions of those are almost nil. That if you didn't have the co-benefit of the reduction of the particulate matter, that you wouldn't have any benefit of any size. I mean, it appears to me it is misleading the American people. I know we have Mr. Hescox from the Evangelical Group here who have been running ads in various members' districts about how dangerous it is about this mercury reduction, it is important that we reduce mercury. And yet, there is no calculated benefit or very minute, because this rule does not reduce mercury to any calculated benefit. So it is a total misleading of the American people. The only benefit is reduction in particulate matter. So that is very disappointing to me, and at this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, for 5 minutes. Mr. Markey. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the Ranking Member, Mr. Rush, for allowing me this courtesy. In the movie ``Groundhog Day'' a weatherman named Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, finds himself repeating the same day over and over and over again. And here we are in the same committee room for this committee's tenth hearing relating to EPA's regulations to remove toxic chemicals from power plants and other industrial sources. For the fifth time, Gina McCarthy has come to defend her agency against the specious claims that President Obama just doesn't want Americans to have jobs, and on the House floor, Republicans have already voted to weaken, delay, or repeal these regulations at least 40 times so far. It is Groundhog Day here in the House with the same hearings, the same bills, the same votes over and over again. Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow, six more weeks of winter. Ms. McCarthy, you are just like Punxsutawney Phil, but you have eight more months of appearances before this committee to say the same thing over and over and over again. That is their plan. Clearly, this a Republican majority that has run out of new bad ideas, so they have just decided to recycle all of their old bad ideas. This may be the only type of recycling which the Republicans actually support. Of course, at each of these hearings, Republicans claim over and over again that Americans must choose between air conditioning and air quality. They tell us that we have to choose between pollution and power plants. What the Republicans are giving us are false choice. We may not have to choose between manufacturing and mercury. We do not have to choose between concrete and cancer. We do not have to choose between the next generation and generators. Just yesterday in this very committee during the debate on the Keystone pipeline, the Republicans said we should just ignore the environment, ignore pipeline safety, ignore public health, ignore the fact that none of the oil or fuel from this pipeline will stay in this country and benefit our citizens. And why do none of these things matter? Because of jobs, the majority says. Republicans even accused Democrats of not liking the blue-collar jobs they say the Keystone pipeline will create. According to the EPA, the regulations that are subject to today's hearings will create 46,000 short-term construction jobs. That is nearly eight times the 6,000 temporary jobs that the State Department estimated for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. An independent report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that this rule could create between 28,000 and 158,000 jobs by 2015. That could be as many jobs as 26 Keystone pipelines would create. The Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts found that EPA's Clean Air Act cross-State air pollution rule and the mercury rule would together create nearly 1.5 million jobs over 5 years. That is 250 Keystone pipelines. Ms. McCarthy, the Clean Air Act is one of the reasons for tremendous growth in the U.S. environmental technologies industry, and has been estimated to support 1.6 million jobs over the past 40 years. Is that your understanding? Ms. McCarthy. Yes, it is. Mr. Markey. So assuming Keystone is able to create the 6,000 jobs State Department generously estimates it would, we would need 267 Keystone pipelines under that math to create the equivalent number of jobs as U.S. environmental technologies that have been created under the Clean Air Act, is that correct? Ms. McCarthy. I will have to take your word for the math on this one. Mr. Markey. But assuming that division is correct? Ms. McCarthy. Yes. Mr. Markey. Isn't it true that EPA's mercury rule will create 8,000 long-term utility jobs? Ms. McCarthy. That is what our estimates project, yes. Mr. Markey. Well, that again is more permanent jobs than the number of temporary construction jobs the State Department estimates the Keystone pipeline will create. So while the Republicans are crying crocodile tears over the 6,000 temporary jobs that the Keystone XL pipeline will create, they make us vote over and over and over again to kill tens of thousands of jobs that are created simply by ensuring that our air is clean to breathe. This certainly would seem like a ridiculous comedy if the consequences weren't so serious. I can only wish when I rise and shine tomorrow morning this whole movie won't be repeated yet again here in this committee, because I like Bill Murray's version much better, how that movie turned out. I don't see a good ending to the way in which the Republicans want to deal with the environment and job creation in this country. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Markey At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, for 5 minutes. Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before Mr. Markey leaves, we have been debating pronunciations of bitumen and bitumen, so we did additional research, Mr. Markey, and if you go on the online Oxford Edition, unfortunately, we are both correct, because they will have a pronunciation of the words and I take the English version and you take the American. I have the old money version, you have the new money version. Mr. Markey. You are taking the British version of how to speak it. You are so Southern Illinois, and I am taking the American version. Mr. Shimkus. You know where the Industrial Revolution began, right? It was those old dirty coal packs in England that helped fuel their power. Mr. Markey. And they came to America, they came to Boston. Ms. McCarthy and I, we took their language which is Irish, and we said no, let us use it correctly here. Let us put the---- Mr. Shimkus. I just wanted to put that on for record, for those who followed Keystone yesterday. Mr. Markey. You said unfortunately we are both correct. That would be reconciliation, which is good. Mr. Shimkus. Hard to believe it would happen here. Mr. Markey. We hope that we can do the same thing with the EPA and the Clean Air Act, that we both---- Mr. Shimkus. All right, reclaiming my time. Ms. McCarthy, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your time, and I do appreciate every time you appear. Even though it seems contentious, we have discussed and talked offline. So a couple of questions. We do have concerns with this annualized impact analysis, 9.4 billion in 2015 and then we skipped to 2020 and say well that year, that annualized cost is going to be 8.6 billion, and then we skip to 2030 and you say then it is going to be 7.4 billion. You are testifying today that you cannot provide us with estimates for the intervening years, is that correct? Ms. McCarthy. Yes, I am indicating that the way in which we do this is we compare an annualized cost very conservatively with the cost that would be the highest with the annualized benefits. Mr. Shimkus. So I mean, I think we will have other folks on the second panel who say well, we can, and that is the problem. We are going to say--you are going to use these annualized numbers that industry will say it is just not in the ballpark. Let me ask this question, and I will--how long past 2030 do you envision these annualized costs occurring? Ms. McCarthy. Well we don't know. We can't project right now, and I certainly can't tell you how much lower they are going to go, nor can I tell you how much more increase in benefits will accrue through from this rule. Mr. Shimkus. Let me then follow up, because again, with my friend Mr. Markey--you know, people from my district want me fighting for coal, and as the chairman of the recycling caucus, I take offense. We had a great bill moved through this committee to make sure we could recycle coal ash, which is an additional cost. This is one of the multitude of attacks on coal and electricity generation, Boiler MACT, Mercury MACT, coal ash, I mean, that is our problem. So my folks send me here to fight for coal. My folks send me here to fight for low-cost power, because of jobs and incomes. There is--Atlantic Cities did an article, ``What Happens to Small Town When Its Coal Plant Shuts Down?'' The mayor of Eastlake was quoted as saying ``It is a huge hit in terms of lost revenue for our town and school district.'' In doing your analysis, did you consider what happens to small town America when they lose their coal-fired power plant? And we are losing three, based upon recent rules, in the State of Illinois. Ms. McCarthy. I will tell you that the rule itself didn't project a significant amount of closures that were the result-- as a result of---- Mr. Shimkus. But you can understand small town rural America, that is their only facility. Best wages, good benefits, good health care, what it does to the school system when that is no longer on the tax rolls, what it does to the local hospital when they no longer have a paying private- sector---- Ms. McCarthy. Yes. Mr. Shimkus [continuing]. Industry. It kind of follows up to our next panel, we have a representative from the Navajo Nation who says this rule will be cataclysmic to the Navajo Nation. Do you consider these economic impacts in your consideration of the rule? Ms. McCarthy. We certainly take a look and we are able to take a look nationally and regionally at what the impacts of the rule might be in terms of electricity capacity. We are also working really closely with local communities, with the Navajo in particular. I was there last week at the Navajo generating station. We are looking at these rules---- Mr. Shimkus. And if I can reclaim my time, I have 19 seconds. Their testimony will say you have not worked with them. So I would--we need to get a meeting of the minds. And just to finalize, you know, Mr. Markey's tirade on the Keystone XL pipeline, remember, it is the plumbers and pipefitters who support the Keystone pipeline, Laborers International, the AFL-CIO, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, operating engineers, many who support me, I am a pro-labor, building construction trade guy, so they are barking up the wrong tree trying to stop the Keystone pipeline. I yield back. Mr. Whitfield. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Dingell, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Dingell. I thank you for your courtesy, and I commend you for this hearing. Administrator McCarthy, first I would like to welcome you back to the subcommittee. I appreciate your willingness and patience to answer questions. I would also like to thank you for taking time last year to meet with two utilities from my home State of Michigan, DTE and CMS, and I am appreciative of the fact that you were able to take the time to listen to their concerns. Administrator McCarthy, you may know I wrote a letter last December, along with Senators Levin and Stabenow to Administrator Jackson. We expressed our concern for sensible measures to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants in order to protect human health and the environment. However, we also pointed out that some utilities may not have enough time to comply with emissions standards. Can you inform us what steps EPA has taken to address that concern? Ms. McCarthy. I can, Mr. Dingell, and thank you for your letter. We received a lot of comment concerning that timeline and the rule. As I indicated in my opening statement, we not only provided the 3 years that we are allowed to provide under the MATS rule for compliance, but we also directed States and provided guidance to them to be very forward leaning in terms of making available a fourth year for units that---- Mr. Dingell. You actually have potential for 4 and perhaps for 5 years? Ms. McCarthy. And we also developed an enforcement policy to utilize an Administrative Order that could provide a fifth year for reliability critical units. Mr. Dingell. Thank you, ma'am. Now in order for the utilities to request a one-year extension to comply with the new rule, what specific requirements or commitments will utilities have to meet in order to receive an extension? I won't object if you want to submit that to us for the record. Ms. McCarthy. I am more than happy to do that. Mr. Dingell. Now I know that the final rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register, but have any utilities contacted you to discuss the process of requesting a one-year extension discussed in the final rule? In other words, could you submit for the record to us what the utilities will have to do to secure that extension? Ms. McCarthy. We will. Mr. Dingell. Just submit that for the record, please. Now, as utilities prepare to upgrade their larger facilities and meet the new rule, some of these facilities will have to be taken offline in order to install the new technologies. While these larger facilities are offline, utilities may have to depend on older facilities in order to meet the basic peak demand. These older facilities will not likely be upgraded to meet the new rules. Now here comes the rub. As utilities are going to go through this retrofitting process, can they apply for a waiver for the older facilities to operate beyond the 3 years to ensure reliability during the transitioning? Yes or no. Ms. McCarthy. Yes. Mr. Dingell. Would you submit for the record how that would be done, please? Ms. McCarthy. We will. Mr. Dingell. Now, Madam Administrator, I understand that there have been two instances where the Department of Energy required utilities to reactivate generation facilities in order to meet reliability requirements. These facilities were not in compliance with Clean Air requirements, and it is my understanding that they were subsequently fined by EPA. Do you believe that the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards provide room and flexibility to ensure that reliability is not jeopardized? Ms. McCarthy. We will work together, Mr. Dingell, and I will provide you information on the case that you referenced. I do not believe that EPA fined that facility, but there certainly is a concern that those issues raise and we will address those to you in written comments. Mr. Dingell. I thank you for that. I would also like to see sufficient attention given to that, if we could have a good answer to those questions in the record, and if you would submit that for the record, it would be much appreciated because there is a great deal of concern amongst the utilities on this particular matter. Now, Madam Administrator, should this situation occur again, that is, what I have been referring to earlier, will the EPA explore ways to work with utilities so that the utilities are not fined? Ms. McCarthy. We are exploring with them the issues that they are facing and how to face those challenges together right now. We are raising these issues. We are working with the regional transmission organizations, we are working with each of the States and with individual utilities right now to ensure that there is a pathway forward where we will absolutely be able to provide reliable, cost effective electricity and achieve compliance with these rules. Mr. Dingell. Madam Administrator, I note that you have a number of agencies, Federal, State, EPA, and also, you have to address the concerns of the Department of Energy, which has its reliability responsibilities. You had said--and this is comforting to me--that you are working with the utilities, but it appears to me to be very necessary that you should also be working, for example, with the Department of Energy, with the several State agencies, perhaps with the reliability councils, and others so that you can achieve the necessary purposes of avoiding fining utilities behaving in good faith but trying to serve a number of different masters. Can EPA give us assurance that you will be working with these other agencies as well as the utilities to avoid this kind of situation? Ms. McCarthy. I can provide that assurance, and the President directed the agencies to work together and we are doing that. Mr. Dingell. Thank you, Madam Administrator. Mr. Chairman, you have been most courteous. I am 1 minute over time, and I thank you. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess, for 5 minutes. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank Ms. McCarthy for being here again. Could we talk for just a minute about the energy policy that is being followed by this administration? Of course, we got some clues 4 years ago when President Obama was running for president and he said so, if somebody wants to build a coal- fired power plant they can, it is just that we will bankrupt them. So could a new coal-fired power plant be built today that meets the new Utility MACT rule, or has the EPA effectively taken coal off the table for our future energy portfolio, consistent with what President Obama said when he was running for president? Ms. McCarthy. Let me just say that we believe that you can not only construct a new coal facility that meets the new coal standards, but we believe there is an existing facility that already does achieve the toxic standards in this rule. Mr. Burgess. No surprise that not everyone agrees with that. We may hear some testimony in the second panel that provides some additional insight into that. Let me ask you this. I come from a part of the country that does not produce coal. We do produce a fair amount of natural gas through a procedure known as hydraulic fracturing. Is the EPA planning further restrictions on the production of natural gas? Ms. McCarthy. Are you asking are we looking at additional emissions rules relative to oil and gas? I am just trying to-- -- Mr. Burgess. Correct, are there going to be further restrictions placed on the production of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing that the EPA is now contemplating? Ms. McCarthy. Well, we--I can speak for the air program, and we are finalizing an oil and gas new source performance standard that does relate to oil and gas development that looks at emissions associated with that. Mr. Burgess. And when will that appear? Ms. McCarthy. It is due to be finalized this spring. Mr. Burgess. Well is there--you just worry that--you take coal out of the equation, a lot of people feel nuclear no longer belongs in our portfolio--natural gas is under assault as well. Where do we get our energy? We heard testimony in this committee last session of Congress when the Waxman-Markey bill was being debated that without energy, life is cold, brutal, and short. I think that is still true. So where are we going to get our energy if we take all of these sources off the table? Ms. McCarthy. I believe that the MATS rule that we are discussing today allows existing coal to continue to run. I believe it allows new coal to be sited and constructed. I believe that the rules we are contemplating on the oil and gas industry, on natural gas will continue to allow natural gas to be utilized. The only thing we are doing in this rule in particular is using available cost effective controls to minimize harmful emissions of toxic chemicals that are impacting American families. That does not mean that we are precluding any type of energy from being utilized or constructed. Mr. Burgess. But on the one hand, it seems like you are eliminating other sources of energy, driving electrical suppliers to natural gas and on the other hand, there are going to be new regulations that make this problematic as well, not just in your department, but also on the studies of groundwater. We want it to be safe, but at the same time, we know we have to have energy available. You know, we have talked before and it doesn't take long in your testimony where you refer to asthmatics whose lives will be improved because of the things that you are doing. You didn't disappoint. It was in your third paragraph, prevent 100,000 heart and asthma attacks each year. I just got to tell you, I do not believe that the EPA is serious about reducing asthma in this country because as someone who suffers from asthma, I can no longer buy an over- the-counter asthma inhaler as of January 1 to remove it. You said that the CFCs were not permitted because there is going to be a hole in the ozone, and as a consequence Primatene Mist, which I relied upon for years and years and years, is now gone. Many of us are inconsistent asthmatics, that is, we are not asthmatic all the time so we may move away from our maintenance medications, but then at 2 o'clock in the morning, something happens, mountain cedar, someone goes by on a horse and carriage, triggers our asthma and we are in trouble. And at 2 o'clock in the morning, it used to be you could go down to the all-night pharmacy and buy a Primatene inhaler. You can't do that anymore. The only option you have is to go to the hospital emergency room and spend $800 to $1,500 getting a breathing treatment. How is that enhancing the life of asthmatics in this country? Ms. McCarthy. Mr. Burgess, as you know, there has been much review of the issue of Primatene Mist, not only at EPA but primarily at FDA in concert with many medical associations. The decision was made that the Primatene Mist did not--was available to be phased out because of concerns with the ozone layer without impacting the treatment that is medically available and that is useful for individuals---- Mr. Burgess. It didn't work. It didn't work, and as a consequence, we cannot buy the leftover Primatene in the pharmacy any longer, and we are left to find much more expensive solutions to those problems that occur. This is something that could be fixed, and people frankly do not understand why it cannot be fixed. We had Margaret Hamburg in here from the FDA at the Health subcommittee the other day, and she said that it wasn't their problem, it was the EPA's problem. Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman---- Mr. Burgess. I am asking you, fix this problem. People want it---- Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time is expired. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Whitfield. Recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, for 5 minutes. Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do share in your concerns, and I think the problems need to be fixed. Asthma is a very, very--high incidents of asthma and asthma-related illnesses in my district, and so I want you to know, I empathize with and I share your concern. But along those lines, Ms. McCarthy, I know that this has been kind of a protracting struggle that you have been engaged in here with us, and--but we are here today and I welcome you again, you know. I feel for you. The second panel--there are witnesses on the second panel who will allege that the EPA has enslaved the health benefits of the air toxics rule. In particular, they argue that EPA has over-estimated the value of reducing emissions of deadly fine particles which are linked to asthma, stroke, heart attacks, and premature deaths. Ms. McCarthy, do you have a response to these allegations, and could you share your responses? Ms. McCarthy. Thank you. I would respond by saying that EPA did its best job working with congressional panels who did a peer-reviewed study of how we do our cost and benefits approach. There are clearly benefits associated with the reduction of toxic emissions of mercury, arsenic, cyanide. Many of those toxic emissions and those benefits cannot be specifically calculated because of data and methodology problems. It doesn't mean that mercury doesn't cause neurological challenges for our children. We calculate those as best we can. But we also identify that the control technologies that are going to be put in place as a result of this rule also bring benefits associated with reductions in particulate matter. We counted those reductions. We used the best available science, both the science that is being driven by peer review, by our guidance with our Office of Management and Budget. We used the exact, most transparent way of calculating those, and we included them in benefits. There is no reason to deny the public the numbers associated with the full suite of public health benefits that are accrued as a result of this rule, just because the rule itself isn't targeting those reductions. It is coming with the rule itself, and that is what is driving significant public health benefits, as well as those benefits we just can't calculate that stem from reduction of toxic pollution that is impacting children and adults in this country. Mr. Rush. I think that should put to rest this fallacy that is being perpetuated, you know, at each one of these hearings, each one of your appearances that---- Ms. McCarthy. Mr. Chairman, these are all real benefits to real people. People should know about them and we are telling them about the benefits. Thank you. Mr. Rush. Thank you. Last year in September, the committee and the full House passed the TRAIN Act that nullified the EPA's Mercury Air Standards or Air Toxics rules, requiring EPA to start from scratch. This prohibits the EPA from issuing a new rule for at least 2 years and bars implementation for at least 5 years. I can't--it doesn't make sense. I can't see the rhyme or the reason that this committee, this subcommittee never, ever had a hearing on the public health implications of nullifying these rules before passing the bill. So Ms. McCarthy, just for the record, how will nullifying the Mercury and Air Toxics rules affect public health? Ms. McCarthy. The Mercury and Air Toxics rules are now 20 years overdue. If we are denied the ability to move this rule forward and implement it, you are denying significant public health improvements that Congress anticipated that EPA would produce for the American public. You are denying the ability for us to move forward with cost effective rules that will actually provide healthier families and healthier communities across the entire United States. Mr. Rush. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes. Mr. Barton. Mr. Chairman, could I defer at this point in time and let one of the other members who has been here ask questions? I do want to ask questions, but I still have some studying to do, so if you could go to somebody else who has sat here. Mr. Whitfield. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Olson, for 5 minutes. Mr. Olson. I thank the chairman, and good morning, Ms. McCarthy. Ms. McCarthy. Good morning. Mr. Olson. Thanks for coming today, and the people I represent back home in Texas 22 have a lot of questions they want me to ask you this morning. It is going to center on costs for the Utility MACT bill and greater liability. And just starting out, everyone in this room is entitled to their own opinion, but no one is entitled to their own facts, and that is why we are here today, ma'am, is the facts. My home State is still experiencing severe drought conditions. We just went through the hottest August in record. My district, the Houston district, we were over 100 degrees the entire month of August. While most people here don't think that is unique, that is. We will go over 100 maybe 10 times a year normally. We have 100 percent humidity a lot longer than that, but experts are going to predict that this pattern is going to continue. And so reliability of the grid is particularly important. And ERCOT, the entity that regulates our grid in Texas, expects capacity shortages. If we are going to have rolling blackouts in the soaring heat, young and elderly lives are going to be in danger, the very people that this supposed rule is going to protect. These aren't projected lives saved, but real lives lost. And the people in Texas 22, I have got to be honest with you, ma'am, are skeptical about the administration's motive. They remember then-candidate Obama's statements to a San Francisco editorial board that under his policies, energy prices will ``necessarily skyrocket'', basically making the cost of fossil fuels too expensive and making the other fuels, the alternative fuels, economically viable. I share their concerns. EPA claims that the benefits of this bill are $90 billion, but the experts say the benefits to the mercury are much, much lower, $500,000 a year. In this chart here, just to focus on the mercury issue, as you can see on this chart, blood levels are significantly low exposure levels. Look at this. This is the World Health Organization up here, and there are 20 micrograms per liter. The European Food Safety Authority down here, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency down here. Obviously, we have got the lowest mercury standards in the entire world. And we are above the limits in blood mercury levels of women ages 16 to 49, 95th percentile from 1999 to 2000. President Bush takes office, we go below for the first time, 4.6 milligrams per liter, 4.4 in 2003-2004, 4.5 2005 to 2006, 3.8 2007 to 2008. So this chart shows that EPA--we are below EPA's own standards right here, and yet you are calling this thing the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule. It can't be mercury, looking at this chart. So the question I have for you, and this is what my people back home want me to ask, are these numbers being used, the mercury being used, to get it to the miniscule mercury exposure to actually get reductions in particulate matter? Yes or no. Again, are you using mercury to get another target, particulate matter? Ms. McCarthy. This standard is about reducing toxic pollution. It has the co-benefit of reducing particulate matter. Mr. Olson. Total benefit. Ma'am, you are below the levels right now, and again, people are skeptical. We are over 95 percent. This is from, again--we will get you all the information. Ms. McCarthy. I am sorry, I don't know what--are those numbers reflective of what, the blood level mercury? Mr. Olson. Blood level mercury, yes, ma'am, the Y axis going up is the blood level mercury, and that is micrograms per liter, and then the level, the number here on just the--what has decreased, what has happened over a number of years. As you can see, this is the World Health Organization, European Food Safety Authority, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, your agency. We were above, EPA only, 1999 to 2000, and then since that point forward, from 2001 to 2008, we have had significant decreases. We have been below EPA's own levels. So I am very skeptical about this thing being called some sort of mercury bill, and not being used to get into particulate matter. But I have got to move on, ma'am, I have got a lot more questions from my people. The other thing I have got, in questions from our chairman here, he talked about jobs gained and jobs lost. You kept just talking about the jobs gained, jobs gained, jobs gained. That is only half the equation. I mean, we need to know about how many jobs are lost as well, because it is the net that is important. Not just the jobs gained, but the net of jobs gained versus jobs lost. I have got a bill, H.R. 1341, the Establishing Public Accountability Act, that is going to require EPA to do a study of the job impact overall, jobs they have lost, jobs gained, jobs sent overseas, and to do it before the public comment period so the public has the ability to determine whether or not they will get some of that information. Would you support that bill? Ms. McCarthy. Our job numbers are net, so I would be happy to have any additional information and participate. Mr. Olson. OK, thank you, because you just kept talking about jobs gained, so thank you very much. I appreciate that. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you very much, Mr. Olson. At this time, I recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes. Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, Administrator McCarthy. Ms. McCarthy. Good morning. Ms. Castor. And really to everyone that values clean air across America, I want to thank you for your perseverance, because after all, it has been 20 years--21 years since the passage of the Clean Air Act amendments, and we finally have a proposed air toxics standard that will regulate mercury and other toxic air pollutants that is based on the best science and technology. These substances are some of the most toxic, carcinogenic, and dangerous pollutants. Mercury is known to cause devastating damage to the brain. Mercury is of particular concern to women of childbearing age, infants, and children, because mercury exposure damages the nervous system, which can impair children's ability to think and learn. So I guess it is no surprise that a lot of public health groups see this as a great victory, like the American Lung Association, the Academy--American Academy of Pediatrics, but I think people across the country would also be interested in knowing that religious organizations, sportsman's organizations like hunters and anglers, also support the rule, but they may be particularly surprised to understand how many utilities support this rule. Thirty-six energy businesses and business associations, including Calpine, Constellation Energy, Entergy, Exelon, NRG Systems, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Public Service Enterprise Group have expressed their support. And in fact, in my home State of Florida, a number of utilities that operate coal-fired power plants have expressed their commitment to coming into compliance. I think that is very telling. See, many of those utilities over the years have invested in the technology. They have continued to make good profits, but part of that has been being responsible businesses. They have invested in technology to reduce their emissions. The technology is in widespread use all across the country, but the dirtiest power plants have put off installing pollution controls for decades. So hopefully this is going to spur everyone to come up to the best science, use the best technology. It will create jobs, but Madam Administrator, I understand that there will be some that are going to be affected. They have kind of stared in the face of the evolution of technology and haven't gone down that road, and now they are going to have to. But explain that compliance period. How long will businesses, utilities, have to come into compliance? Ms. McCarthy. We are generally talking about the ability for companies to have a 3- to 4-year window, which brings us to the spring of 2016. Units that are necessary for reliability purposes will have a defined pathway that they can come to the agency and get a fifth year added on to that, which brings us to 2017. We do not even anticipate that most will need a 4-year window, never mind a fifth year, but we are fully prepared to address those issues to ensure that we meet the President's clear directive that we keep the lights on while we address issues that are so critical to the health of American families related to toxic air pollution. Ms. Castor. I mean, 3 to 4 to 5 years? Some, I bet, have argued that that is too lenient. What is that compliance timeframe of 3 to 4 to 5 years based upon? What study went into that time period? Ms. McCarthy. Well, it is a statutory requirement that we look at what kinds of technologies are in the marketplace that are cost effective and available, and then we give sufficient time under the statute to be able to allow those to be constructed. We have looked at in detail with the Department of Energy and others have looked at this as to whether it is sufficient time. We know the types of control technologies that will be required. We understand the time it takes to construct those, to engineer them, to put them in place, and we believe that the timeline that is being provided with this rule and with the other pathways available to us will be more than sufficient to address the challenges associated with compliance and keeping the lights on. Ms. Castor. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. McKinley, for 5 minutes. Mr. McKinley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, my colleague from Massachusetts left, and he made an interesting analogy about Groundhog Day, but unfortunately he missed the point. Groundhog Day, by repeating the message, the actor of the story got the message finally and he became a better person. That is what we are trying to do here. We are going to repeat it and repeat and repeat it until America understands that these rules--what effect these rules are going to have, because what we have said to you and your predecessors and others is that just because you can doesn't mean you should. It is a business lesson. And for those of us that have come from the business community, we understand just because you can doesn't mean you should, because of your consequences of what you do. So for example, powerhouses all across America are shutting down because of the onslaught of EPA rules. If I could just show you, here is a visual for people to understand, here are the plants that are going to be closing across America, because of the short timeframe and the rules are simply too severe to comply. Just this morning a company announced three more powerhouses are going to close, in addition to the six they already--hundreds of jobs are going to be lost, health care benefits. Nationally, you can see the drama that will play out. But curiously, last December in your own testimony and then today again, you said that you only think the loss of gigawatts will only be in the neighborhood of 4.7 gigawatts. But yet, every other group in America that has studied this has said that you are grossly misleading the American public and concealing information apparently from Congress, because your number is down here, while all the others are up in a much higher level. I think there is a real question about your capability of doing your own mathematics. Some have said it could be as high as 75 gigawatts, not 4.7. Just in the last 48 hours, we have had one power company reduce 3.3 gigawatts. Earlier this year, AEP came out and said 6 gigawatts. Between the two of them are 10. That is twice the number that you suggested. It is so blatantly false what you are representing to us in this. What you are doing is this war on coal. It is not just a war on coal in the industry, but just a war on the miners and the families and the communities. You are devastating them with these kinds of threats. But more importantly, what you have to understand, and we have heard it throughout this whole thing, has been the increased cost of electricity. You say 3 percent. Utility companies are saying 13 to 15 percent. Again, what are we supposed to believe? Your numbers that you keep giving us are flawed, and they are proven out time and time again as being unreliable. Just in the last 10 years, half of the American families have seen their energy costs double, and you are saying it is only going to increase 3 percent? Now, I wish what you would do is the EPA--all of you, would take some of your resources and look at where possibly the real culprit is, that cost, and bear that in mind. All the quotes that we keep hearing coming from the other side of the aisle talk about asthma, heart, but no one differentiates between outdoor air and indoor air quality. You look surprised. Have you considered indoor air quality? Do you understand that 90 percent of our hours that we are on this planet, 90 percent of our day is spent in a building? Only 10 percent in that outdoor air quality, 90 percent--60 percent of it is in our homes. We have 56 million children and families that go into a school building every day and deal with bad air quality. Indoor air quality is one of the biggest issues we should be addressing, and when we talk about the asthma conditions that occur, why don't we look at the fact that historically, with all the drops in all of the contaminants that are occurring across America, asthma is increasing. All of this, all this money that is being spent by the powerhouses to reduce a particular matter, whether it is NOX, SOX, or whatever is going to be in the air to contribute to that, has not been offset the fact that asthma has actually increased across America. I would like to see you spend some time to do the research to find out what that is about, instead of spending--we have 700 powerhouses in America that need to be upgraded, and for you to say $9.4 billion annually is just patently preposterous. Everyone in this room that has any sense of engineering and facts knows that you can't do it for that amount of time. Unfortunately, my time has run out, but--so I didn't get a chance, but I hope that--I hope you can respond finally to some questions, issues that we have raised, because I have asked you for questions in the past--for answers--and you have not gotten back to me. Thank you. Mr. Whitfield. At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, for 5 minutes. Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The idea that EPA requirements to clean up air pollution will hurt the economy and kill jobs is now Republican economic dogma, but these are the same doom and gloom scenarios we have heard from industry since the Clean Air Act was first adopted in 1970, and none of them have come true. The truth is, it takes workers to install new pollution controls and construct cleaner power plants. That is why groups representing over 125,000 U.S. businesses support the air toxics standards. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a unanimous consent request to insert this letter of support into the record. Mr. Whitfield. Without objection. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6379.019 Mr. Waxman. The--during a recent call with investors and discussing the effects of the Mercury and Air Toxics rule, American Electric Power CEO Michael Morris even stated ``Once you put capital money to work, jobs are created.'' EPA has come to the same conclusion. The Agency estimates that compliance with the new air toxics standards will be a net job creator, not a job killer. Ms. McCarthy, how many jobs could be created as power companies comply with the new standards? Ms. McCarthy. We estimate that as many as 46,000 jobs will be created on a temporary basis to assist with the construction and installation, and 8,000 permanent jobs will be created. Mr. Waxman. Can you explain how complying with these new air toxics standards will create jobs? Ms. McCarthy. Yes, because the standards will require, in particular, some of the small inefficient coal-fired facilities to make a choice between continuing to run and investing. There are a number of facilities that will need to install control equipment. That will mean engineering jobs, that will mean construction jobs. We estimate that there will be investments made, as we indicated, up to 9.6 million in 2016 alone. That means that we will have construction jobs, and in the long- term, we will have permanent jobs at those facilities to manage that control equipment, and it, of course, will allow us significant health improvements that will really be of benefit to American families in terms of lower health care costs, and improved health of particularly our children. Mr. Waxman. Thank you. As economist Josh Bivens will point out in the second panel, these regulations are expected to have particularly positive effects under current economic conditions. American industry isn't short of cash, it is short of demand for its products, and spending capital to hire workers and buy equipment injects desperately needed cash into the economy, stimulating demand. The record bears this out. Over the last 40 years, the economy has continued to grow as EPA has set new standards to cut air pollution from every industrial sector. Can you discuss some other examples of how implementing the Clean Air Act has created jobs in engineering, manufacturing, construction, and other highly skilled areas? Ms. McCarthy. I certainly can, and there have been studies done of this which we are happy to provide to the committee. But you look at everything from our car rules, including the ones that we are contemplating now that are leading to new cost effective cars available to people that save them money. We are looking at the installation of catalytic converters that actually significantly helped to reduce emissions from cars that led to the growth of industries in the United States that are now exporting to other countries. There is great documentation about our rules initiating expertise in innovation and technology improvement that is bringing world- class industries developing in the United States that then export to other countries. Control technologies in the air pollution sector are, for the most part, have been designed in the United States, manufactured in the United States. A lot of that has been driven by the requirements under the Clean Air Act. Mr. Waxman. In addition to the overblown rhetoric about the impact of this rule on jobs, some have warned that this rule will cause electricity prices to skyrocket. EPA estimates that the rule will cause electricity prices to increase by just 3 percent on average by 2015, falling to 2 percent by 2020, and less than 1 percent by 2030. Can you put this 3 percent increase in context for us? Ms. McCarthy. I can. It is well within the normal fluctuations that we have seen, and it is--the increase that we would estimate as a result of this rule is less than what folks would have paid in 2009 for electricity. It translates into about $3 per household per month. Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Pompeo, for 5 minutes. Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. McCarthy, for being here today. Do any existing units currently meet the new unit standards? Ms. McCarthy. One. Mr. Pompeo. One? What plant is that? Ms. McCarthy. It is a plant in New Jersey. I think it is called Logan. Mr. Pompeo. Is this Logan 1? So there is a single--of all the plants in the United States today, there is a single existing plant that meets these new requirements. Did I ask the question correctly to get the answer I got, ma'am? Ms. McCarthy. Let me just indicate that we don't have all the information on all the plants in terms of whether or not they would comply. We are aware of one plant that I indicated that would meet this new---- Mr. Pompeo. So to the best of your knowledge with all the data that you have there, it is single plant that you are aware of that currently would comply with the new rule---- Ms. McCarthy. That we have data to verify, that is correct. Mr. Pompeo. Great, I appreciate that. That is not very many. That is a far cry from what you have described as a process that can be accomplished in 3 to 5 years. Ms. McCarthy. Well, the good news is for the existing plants and those standards, there are many dozens and dozens actually that will comply out of the gate. Mr. Pompeo. Sure, I understand. In Kansas, we have got a plant we have been trying to build that has an existing air permit, it has been granted the permit, but because it was unable to break ground to begin construction, it is now going to be trapped under the new regulatory regime. Your rule as issued, I understand, made no exception for plants that already had existing permits granted, but because the Sierra Club and other folks took them to task for years, they were unable to proceed. Am I--have I got that correct as well? Ms. McCarthy. I would be happy to look into it in detail, but generally, if you are constructing a new facility and you haven't broken ground, you are obligated to meet new source facility standards. Mr. Pompeo. Right, that is their understanding as well, so--we talked--Mr. Waxman asked you a question about cost. Testimony today--and I have heard from folks back in the district about increasing costs of a penny a kilowatt hour, 3 cents a kilowatt hour. You talked about 3 percent as if it was nothing. I will tell you that when I was in business, we tried to take costs out everywhere. We had to require--when your energy costs go up by any amount, it enormously impacts your business and causes you to consider seriously about whether to continue to manufacture or produce chemicals here in the United States. Did you consider the economic impacts to all of those businesses that will be affected by the cost increase for electricity when you promulgated the rules? Ms. McCarthy. We did, to the extent that methodology allows, look at the cascading impact on other sectors, yes. And that impact was negligible. Mr. Pompeo. Do you think that there will be new coal-fired power plants built in the United States following the implementation of this rule? Ms. McCarthy. Actually, I don't make those predictions, so I would hesitate to do that based on my personal knowledge. Mr. Pompeo. If there are no new coal-fired power plants built in America following this rule, would you be willing to at least consider the possibility that it was a direct result of this rule, that no such plants were ever built? Ms. McCarthy. Well actually, our analysis did take a look at whether or not the MATS rule, in and of itself, would change the dynamic in terms of decisions about building new coal, and we do not believe that it will. Mr. Pompeo. Mr. McKinley showed you some data that refuted your assessment that only 4.7 gigawatts of energy will be lost as a result of this. Do you think that data is just wrong? We have already got FirstEnergy's announcement. What is it about the data that Mr. McKinley presented you that you think causes that to be at such a wide variance from your very low prediction about the impact of the rule on retiring facilities? Ms. McCarthy. I think that we have to acknowledge that there is a transition in the energy world. We have to acknowledge that low natural gas prices is causing a transition, and when these issues come up, and I am sure they will consistently come up, you have to take a look at it and see what is actually happening. Whether it is the MATS rule or it is an overall business decision, that is reflective of that transition, and we could walk through what happened with FirstEnergy, but it appears to us on looking at this that FirstEnergy is making a business decision. And what we are attempting to do is work with the RTOs, with the energy world, to understand these dynamics so that we can be informed by this and ensure that the MATS rule can be complied with, but it is not changing the direction in which the industry is heading. Mr. Pompeo. I will tell you that FirstEnergy disagrees with you. I mean, their public statements, the folks who know the business best tell us that you are wrong about that, so their assessment is very different. So while you said you can't predict about what someone will do about a coal plant, apparently you can predict inside of a company's own business why it is making their own business decision better than the leaders of that business. Ms. McCarthy. Well, the units that they have announced that they are closing, they are closing now, 3 or 4 years in advance of being required to do it under the rule, and they are also an average of 53 years old. Mr. Pompeo. I have got one last question. The new coal- fired power plants, have you talked to any of the contractors about whether their permit to issue--they are prepared to issue certifications saying that they can meet these new rules? That is what a new--a company needs. If they are going to build a plant, they have got to get financing. They need the contractors to confirm that, in fact, when it is built it will be in compliance. Have you talked to any of the contractors who have assured you that they can provide that guarantee? Ms. McCarthy. I have not, but clearly, we expect that there will be concerns raised about many aspects of these rules, and we will take a look at it if people submit data and have concerns. Mr. Pompeo. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Whitfield. At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. McCarthy, welcome back. It is good to see you again. Ms. McCarthy. You, too. Mr. Green. I want to start like my colleague, Congressman Olson, we share East and Southeast Harris County together, and we are concerned about the reliability issues. Last year, Texas suffered two major reliability problems, and we actually experienced rolling blackouts throughout the State. Since that time, EPA has issued the Cross State Air Pollution rule, which is something that our utilities had not anticipated having to comply with, and now the Utility MACT rule on top of that. The North American Reliability Corporation recently looked at the reserve margins in 18 regions covering the 48 mainland U.S. States, and found that two regions, ERCOT in Texas, the Texas grid, and New England would experience margin--planning margins below the NERC reference level of 15 percent in 2015. According to the Congressional Research Service, the data suggests that ERCOT may experience reliability problems, but the Utility MACT would play a minor role. Of course, industry has different conclusions. Did you or EPA work with our regional grid, ERCOT, during the rulemaking process on the reliability issue, and if so, what were their concerns and how were they addressed? Ms. McCarthy. Actually, we did and we continue to work with them. I think I would just point out that I believe the study that you identified was on the basis of the proposed rule, and because of the comments that we received, we made significant adjustments in that rule because of the data we received. Recent analysis does indicate, we believe, that the MATS rule will not impact resource capacity in any region. So I think the issues that were raised for ERCOT and the New England States are no longer considered in the same framework, because of the changes that we made. Mr. Green. Does ERCOT agree with you on that? Ms. McCarthy. We actually had them on a phone call last week with a number of the RTOs. We are working hand in hand with them. I do not know exactly what their comments might be on the final rule, but if they have concerns, we are certainly open and we will be working with them. Mr. Green. OK. One of my concerns is that if we--because of the coal plants and in central Texas and in east Texas, if those are required to shut down, I know some companies are bringing natural gas facilities out of mothballs, but they are having--going through the permitting process. Is there any way that EPA could look at some of those--some of them are in Harris County, in fact, in Congressman Olson and I's district-- to look at bringing those back on in time? Hopefully we won't have 100 degree temperatures for, you know, 200 days or whatever it was last year, but is there an effort to make sure, whether it be ERCOT or even New England, that there are some additional power that will be coming online? And like I said, we have no shortage of natural gases, we know, in our country, but the permitting process may be longer through EPA to get those plants back up, those mothballed---- Ms. McCarthy. We will be working with those, Congressman. One of the things that I indicated is that we have developed an enforcement policy that would utilize and Administrative Order to allow up to 5 years for those types of issues to be addressed. But we will address those issues and we are working to identify them now so that there is more than sufficient time to look at what other generation will be constructed and how to address these issues. Mr. Green. I have a number of questions, Mr. Chairman. I would like to submit them in writing, but let me get to another one. In response to the stakeholder comments EPA received and operational concerns related to the magnitude in facilities the retrofit required by the standard, you are now providing sources the option to use more flexible facility-wide averaging approach, as long as it provides the equivalent reduction in mercury, for example. Can you elaborate on this, and if the facility-wide averaging program is something that has been pushed in the past, especially during the cap and trade debate, but would have often--would we hear often push back from EPA on looking at a system instead of per unit? Ms. McCarthy. Actually, we proposed an averaging system at the facility, not across facilities, that could be utilized under the rule. What we did in the final rule is to allow that averaging to be a little longer period of time with a little tighter standard to provide more flexibility to those facilities. We believe it is consistent with the law. It is not trading among facilities or within regions that would result in different exposure patents for communities. So we believe it is consistent and it is good under the law, and that it will provide opportunities for very cost effective methods to achieve compliance with the rule. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, I know I am out of time, and I just hope we will invite Ms. McCarthy to come enjoy our hospitality more often, because obviously we have a lot of questions that would, you know, I think it would help with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. So I thank you for you time. Mr. Whitfield. And I am sure that she would like to come back more often, too. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes. Mr. Barton. Thank you, and I appreciate the courtesy of being allowed to defer initially so that I could become somewhat better prepared. It is obvious that everybody in this room wants the best health environment we possibly can here in the United States. It is also, I think, a given that we want the best economic opportunity for people here in the United States. You are in an unenviable position of having to make decisions that, to some extent, trade off between those two noteworthy goals. I have really tried to understand this MACT rule, and I have really tried to look at the justification for it and tried to be able to substantiate that, and I just can't do it. I want to talk about health benefits briefly, and then I want to talk about costs. In your--not your rule, but the EPA rule, this is the statistical report that accompanies the rule. It was put out in December. It is, gosh, who knows, 500 pages long. On Table E5, it talks about the reduction in ES3, estimated reduction of incidents of adverse health effects of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard at a 95 percent confidence level. And basically, it says that 99.98 percent of the total benefits are going to be because of reductions in PM2.5, I think, that only .02 percent of the total benefits are with reductions in mercury. And yet, all the press is about mercury reduction. Isn't it true that you get almost no health benefit from the reduction--the new standards for mercury reduction, according to your own statistical analysis? Ms. McCarthy. I do not believe that that is an accurate statement. What I will---- Mr. Barton. That is what you say. Ms. McCarthy. No, we actually identify the benefits that we can count. We certainly know the toxic impacts associated with mercury. We know that other toxins---- Mr. Barton. I stipulate that mercury is toxic. Ms. McCarthy [continuing]. Cause cancer, we are just not able to quantify those sufficiently because of data, resource methodology. Mr. Barton. When you talk in your--I don't know if you talked in your testimony, but you gave us in an answer to a question, you just said that--you used the phrase ``real people.'' Ms. McCarthy. Yes. Mr. Barton. ``Real people.'' Is there a verified incidence of a real person in the United States either dying or being hospitalized because of mercury poisoning that results from a power plant emission? Ms. McCarthy. I don't think I can address that specificity. Mr. Barton. You just talked about ``real people,'' OK, I am asking you a straight question---- Ms. McCarthy. When we look at it on---- Mr. Barton [continuing]. About ``real people.'' Ms. McCarthy [continuing]. Populations, I can't name an individual---- Mr. Barton. Well, you can't name it because it doesn't exist. Ms. McCarthy. Well, I can tell you that power plants are the single largest source of mercury emissions. I can tell you that that mercury enters into the food chain. I can tell you that---- Mr. Barton. If you cannot tell me that somebody has gotten sick and died and gone to the hospital in the United States because of exposure to mercury from a power plant smokestack. You can't do it. Now, let me read you something. This is from your report. This isn't me making it up. Down in the sub-footnotes of this table ES3, and this is your table--not you personally, but the EPA's table. ``The negative estimates for certain endpoints are the result of the weak statistical power of the study used to calculate the health impacts and do not suggest that increases in air pollution exposure result in decreased health impacts.'' The weak statistical power of the study. Now, if you read this, these tables, and they have an estimated midpoint and then they have--on the downside and on the upside, and it turns out that they are all over the map. But the most negative impact, when you go through all of these, non-fatal heart attacks, hospital admissions, respiratory admissions, cardiovascular, emergency room, acute bronchitis, lower respiratory, upper respiratory, asthma exacerbation, it turns out that most of the impact is minor restricted activity days. Minor restricted activity days. From 2.5 million to 3.7 million in the eastern United States from 99,000 to 150,000 in the western United States, and from 2.6 million to 3.8 million nationwide. Minor restricted activity days. Now, minor restricted activity days is going to cost them probably--in your own numbers at least $10 billion a year for 10 years, but you estimate even in the out years it is about $7 billion a year. That is going to cost real jobs and real negative economic impact, and your own tables don't back it up. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Barton. At this time, I recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Doyle, for 5 minutes. Mr. Doyle. Well, that is quite a hard act to follow. Mr. Chairman, thank you for putting the hearing together today and Ms. McCarthy, thanks for your testimony. Mr. Chairman, we are here today to have another hearing on EPA's Utility MACT rule that was finalized in December of last year, and it seems to me that one thing that is often missing from the conversation is that these rules are finally being implemented after years and years of delay, so we shouldn't sit here and pretend like this has just sprung up on our utility and manufacturing sectors in the last year. In fact, EPA has been tasked with regulating mercury sin"
