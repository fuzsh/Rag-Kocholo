We dispose of most of it in as little as six months after we receive it. The byproducts of our quest to consume are creating an environmental crisis. Aja Barber wants to change this--and you can, too.\n\nIn Consumed, Barber calls for change within an industry that regularly overreaches with abandon, creating real imbalances in the environment and the lives of those who do the workâoften in unsafe conditions for very low payâand the billionaires who receive the most profit. A story told in two parts, Barber exposes the endemic injustices in our consumer industries and the uncomfortable history of the textile industry, one which brokered slavery, racism, and todayâs wealth inequality. Once the layers are peeled back, Barber invites you to participate in unlearning, to understand the truth behind why we consume in the way that we do, to confront the uncomfortable feeling that we are never quite enough and why we fill that void with consumption rather than compassion. Barber challenges us to challenge the system and our role in it. The less you buy into the consumer culture, the more power you have. Consumed will teach you how to be a citizen and not a consumer.\n\nWhat does Aja Barber see as the connection between skin color and the fashion industry?\n\nWhat connection does she make with colonialism? In what ways do you agree or disagree with her?\n\nCan you offer a definition for colonialism that the author would agree with? Do you see it differently than she does, and if so, how?\n\nHow did the book make you feel? Might there be a connection to how you feel and see yourself (skin color, majority, minority, economic status, gender, etc.)?\n\nWho does the fashion industry benefit? How? Is this system of hyper-consumption benefitting our world in any way?\n\nHow has the system of hyper-consumption hurt our planet and humankind?\n\nWhat is the connection between climate change and consumerism?\n\nWhat suggestions are offered to make the fashion industry more fair, just, and sustainable?\n\nAre you in any way associated/connected with the fashion industry? If so, do you feel that the industry is making progress in the areas discussed in Aja Barberâs book - if at all?\n\nWhat is your connection to consumerism and how has it been a part of your life, your familyâs, and/or your communityâs life for good or ill?\n\nHas this book changed your perspective to consumerism in the fashion industry and/or other industries re: stuff (food, housing, furniture, automobiles, etc.)?\n\nIs it possible to have capitalism without consumerism?\n\nIs consumerism so deeply rooted in American life and culture that we donât even recognize the extent that it plays at every level in our life, status, and values?\n\nVideo Interview with Aja Barber\n\nThe Story of Stuff Videos\n\nQuotes on Consumerism\n\nWe live in an era of consumerism and it’s all about desire-based consumerism. It has nothing to do with things we actually need. -Aloe Blacc\n\nWe always want more. Whether it is better clothes, a bigger house, faster cars, or the latest gadgets; satisfaction in these days of consumerism is a difficult find. -Tulsi Tanti\n\nThe corruption of the American soul is consumerism. -Ben Nicholson\n\nWe live in a society that, for the most part, is morally and spiritually bankrupt. Our culture is a culture of consumerism. How sustainable is that? -Benjamin Bratt\n\nSocialism may have failed as an economic theory, but global warming alarmism, with its dire warnings about the consequences of industry and consumerism, is equally a rebuke to capitalism. -Bret Stephens\n\nWhat consumerism really is, at its worst, is getting people to buy things that don't actually improve their lives. -Jeff Bezos\n\nConsumerism diverts us from thinking about women’s rights, it stops us from thinking about Iraq, it stops us from thinking about what’s going on in Africa – it stops us from thinking in general. -Pink\n\nEcological thought rejects consumerism at its peril. -Timothy Morton\n\nMy first rule of consumerism is never to buy anything you can’t make your children carry. -Bill Bryson\n\nSince the 1970s, we have witnessed the forces of market fundamentalism strip education of its public values, critical content, and civic responsibilities as part of its broader goal of creating new subjects wedded to consumerism, risk-free relationships, and the destruction of the social state. -Henry Giroux\n\nPop culture is not about depth. It’s about marketing, supply and demand, and consumerism. -Trevor Dunn\n\nI’ve long been interested in looking at the culture of consumerism and also was interested in this connection between the American dream and the house, and the house being kind of the ultimate expression of self and success. -Lauren Greenfield\n\nFeckless as it was for Bush to ask Americans to go shopping after 9/11, we all too enthusiastically followed his lead, whether we were wealthy, working-class or in between. We spent a decade feasting on easy money, don’t-pay-as-you-go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture. -Frank Rich\n\nConsumerism is at once the engine of America and simultaneously one of the most revealing indicators of our collective shallowness. -Henry Rollins\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nFen, Bog & Swamp: A Short History of Peatland Destruction and Its Role in the Climate Crisis\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nA lifelong acolyte of the natural world, Annie Proulx brings her witness and research to the subject of wetlands and the vitally important role they play in preserving the environmentâby storing the carbon emissions that accelerate climate change. Fens, bogs, swamps, and marine estuaries are crucial to the earthâs survival, and in four illuminating parts, Proulx documents their systemic destruction in pursuit of profit.\n\nIn a vivid and revelatory journey through history, Proulx describes the fens of 16th-century England, Canadaâs Hudson Bay lowlands, Russiaâs Great Vasyugan Mire, and Americaâs Okeefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. She introduces the early explorers who launched the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and writes of the diseases spawned in the wetlandsâthe Ague, malaria, Marsh Fever.\n\nA sobering look at the degradation of wetlands over centuries and the serious ecological consequences, this is âan unforgettable and unflinching tour of past and present, fixed on a subject that could not be more importantâ (Bill McKibben).\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\nThe Only Woman in the Room: Why Science is Still a Boys' Club\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nIn 2005, when Lawrence Summers, then president of Harvard, asked why so few women achieve tenured positions in the hard sciences, Eileen Pollack set out to find the answer. In the 1970s, Pollack had excelled as one of Yaleâs first two women to earn a Bachelor of Science in physics. And yet, isolated, lacking in confidence, and starved for encouragement, she abandoned her lifelong dream of becoming a theoretical physicist. Years later, she thought back on her experiences and wondered what had changed in the intervening decades, and what challenges remained. Based on six years of interviewing dozens of teachers and students and reviewing studies on gender bias, The Only Woman in the Room is an illuminating exploration of the cultural, social, psychological, and institutional barriers confronting women in the STEM disciplines. Pollack brings to light the struggles that women in the sciences are often hesitant to admit and provides hope that changing attitudes and behaviors can bring more women into fields in which they remain, to this day, seriously under-represented.\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\nEscape Undersea\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nInvited to the worldâs only undersea research station, Ezzy, Luke, and their father head to the Florida Keys and dive into an unexpected adventure. While visiting their ex-military friends in the Aquarius Sea Station, Ezzy and Luke encounter a strange algae bloom at the surface, giant goliath groupers, and a mysterious fish that threatens the coral reefs and their own safety. Itâs another wild ride filled with humor and action as Ezzy Skylar explores the depths of her courage while overcoming her insecurities. With new friends, she and Luke discover the wonders of the undersea world and what it is like to live underwater. But once again they unwittingly stumble into a plot that could have disastrous consequences for the local wildlife and must jump into action to save the day.\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\nThere's Something in the Water: Environmental Racism in Indigenous and Black Communities\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nDonât have time to read the book? You can find a 1hr 11min documentary of the same name on Amazon Prime. In this documentary, Elliot Page returns to his home province in Canada to meet with Black and Indigenous women who are working to end environmental racism in Nova Scotia.\n\nIn âThereâs Something In The Waterâ, Ingrid R. G. Waldron examines the legacy of environmental racism and its health impacts in Indigenous and Black communities in Canada, using Nova Scotia as a case study, and the grassroots resistance activities by Indigenous and Black communities against the pollution and poisoning of their communities.\n\nUsing settler colonialism as the overarching theory, Waldron unpacks how environmental racism operates as a mechanism of erasure enabled by the intersecting dynamics of white supremacy, power, state-sanctioned racial violence, neoliberalism, and racial capitalism in white settler societies. By and large, the environmental justice narrative in Nova Scotia fails to make race explicit, obscuring it within discussions on class, and this type of strategic inadvertence mutes the specificity of Miâkmaq and African Nova Scotian experiences with racism and environmental hazards in Nova Scotia. By redefining the parameters of critique around the environmental justice narrative and movement in Nova Scotia and Canada, Waldron opens a space for a more critical dialogue on how environmental racism manifests itself within this intersectional context.\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nDiary of a Young Naturalist\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nFrom sixteen-year-old Dara McAnulty, comes a memoir about loving the natural world and fighting to save it.\n\nDiary of a Young Naturalist chronicles the turning of a year in Daraâs Northern Ireland home patch. Beginning in springâwhen âthe sparrows dig the moss from the guttering and the air is as puffed out as the robinâs chestââthese diary entries about his connection to wildlife and the way he sees the world are vivid, evocative, and moving.\n\nAs well as Daraâs intense connection to the natural world, Diary of a Young Naturalist captures his perspective as a teenager juggling exams, friendships, and a life of campaigning. We see his close-knit family, the disruptions of moving and changing schools, and the complexities of living with autism. âIn writing this book,â writes Dara, âI have experienced challenges but also felt incredible joy, wonder, curiosity and excitement. In sharing this journey my hope is that people of all generations will not only understand autism a little more but also appreciate a childâs eye view on our delicate and changing biosphere.â\n\nSeptember 12, 2023\n\nDon't Look Up (Available on Netflix)\n\nTime: 8:00 PM Eastern Time\n\nVideo Conference Log In: meet.google.com/wnf-wuxm-dom\n\nPhone Dial In #: (âªUSâ¬) âª+1 401-285-4760â¬\n\nPin: 743 337 488#â¬\n\nKate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), an astronomy grad student, and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system. The problem - it's on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?\n\nMay 9, 2023 7:00 pm ET\n\nAll We Can Save: Truth, Courage, and Solutions for the Climate Crisis Edited by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine K. Wilkinson\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/cae-ewah-gtj\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 786-886-2384\n\nPin: 716 396 812#\n\nAll We Can Save is an anthology of writings by 60 women at the forefront of the climate movement who are harnessing truth, courage, and solutions to lead humanity forward.\n\nThere is a renaissance blooming in the climate movement: leadership that is more characteristically feminine and more faithfully feminist, rooted in compassion, connection, creativity, and collaboration. While itâs clear that women and girls are vital voices and agents of change for this planet, they are too often missing from the proverbial âtable.â More than a problem of bias, itâs a dynamic that sets us up for failure. To change everything, we need everyone.\n\nApril 11, 2023 7:00 pm ET\n\nClimate Champions by Rachel Sarah\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/bzd-jysy-ccu\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 402-744-0240\n\nPin: 204 040 572#\n\nThey are climate scientists, journalists, professors, academics, researchers, and policy makers from around the world who draft policies with real-life solutions, run science labs to find new solutions to old problems, and lead organizations at the forefront of change. These women do not shy away from showing how racial and social injustices lie at the root of so many climate-related issues.\n\nTheir stories are accessible and energetic, with spotlights on the triumphs and struggles of women who are working to protect the planet.\n\nAs young readers learn how these champions are rising up around the world, they will learn how to be part of the solution.\n\nMarch 14, 2023 7:00 pm ET\n\nThe Highest Tide by Jim Lynch\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/xtr-mrud-htd\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 612-361-0505\n\nPin: 576 707 89#\n\nOne moonlit night, thirteen-year-old Miles O'Malley sneaks out of his house and goes exploring on the tidal flats of Puget Sound. When he discovers a rare giant squid, he instantly becomes a local phenomenon shadowed by people curious as to whether this speed-reading, Rachel Carson obsessed teenager is just an observant boy or an unlikely prophet. But Miles is really just a kid on the verge of growing up, infatuated with the girl next door, worried that his bickering parents will divorce, and fearful that everything, even the bay he loves, is shifting away from him. As the sea continues to offer up discoveries from its mysterious depths, Miles struggles to deal with the difficulties that attend the equally mysterious process of growing up.\n\nFebruary 21, 2023 7:00 pm ET\n\nSaving Us: A Climate Scientists Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World by Katharine Hayhoe\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/xtr-mrud-htd\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 612-361-0505\n\nPin: 576 707 89#\n\nCalled âone of the nation's most effective communicators on climate changeâ by The New York Times, Katharine Hayhoe knows how to navigate all sides of the conversation on our changing planet. A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past fifteen years Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it â and she wants to teach you how.\n\nIn Saving Us, Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field â recently named chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy.\n\nDrawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. Saving Us leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change.\n\nJanuary 10, 2023 7:00 pm ET\n\nThe Intersectional Environmentalist by Leah Thomas\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/ntg-ebqg-xfc\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 470-735-3415\n\nPin: 893 497 585#\n\nThe Intersectional Environmentalist examines the inextricable link between environmentalism, racism, and privilege, and promotes awareness of the fundamental truth that we cannot save the planet without uplifting the voices of its people â especially those most often unheard. Written by Leah Thomas, a prominent voice in the field and the activist who coined the term \"Intersectional Environmentalism,\" this book is simultaneously a call to action, a guide to instigating change for all, and a pledge to work towards the empowerment of all people and the betterment of the planet.\n\nThomas shows how not only are Black, Indigenous and people of color unequally and unfairly impacted by environmental injustices, but she argues that the fight for the planet lies in tandem to the fight for civil rights; and in fact, that one cannot exist without the other. An essential read, this book addresses the most pressing issues that the people and our planet face, examines and dismantles privilege, and looks to the future as the voice of a movement that will define a generation.\n\nDecember 13, 2022 7:00 pm ET\n\nInconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Donât Know You Have by Tatiana Schlossberg\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/wqg-hcay-nkb\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 307-527-0783\n\nPin: 381 870 027#\n\nThis urgent call to action will empower you to stand up to climate change and environmental pollution by making simple but impactful everyday choices.\n\nWith urgency and wit, Tatiana Schlossberg explains that far from being only a distant problem of the natural world created by the fossil fuel industry, climate change is all around us, all the time, lurking everywhere in our convenience-driven society, all without our realizing it.\n\nBy examining the unseen and unconscious environmental impacts in four areas-the Internet and technology, food, fashion, and fuel - Schlossberg helps readers better understand why climate change is such a complicated issue, and how it connects all of us: How streaming a movie on Netflix in New York burns coal in Virginia; how eating a hamburger in California might contribute to pollution in the Gulf of Mexico; how buying an inexpensive cashmere sweater in Chicago expands the Mongolian desert; how destroying forests from North Carolina is necessary to generate electricity in England.\n\nCataloging the complexities and frustrations of our carbon-intensive society with a dry sense of humor, Schlossberg makes the climate crisis and its solutions interesting and relevant to everyone who cares, even a little, about the planet. She empowers readers to think about their stuff and the environment in a new way, helping them make more informed choices when it comes to the future of our world.\n\nMost importantly, this is a book about the power we have as voters and consumers to make sure that the fight against climate change includes all of us and all of our stuff, not just industry groups and politicians. If we have any hope of solving the problem, we all have to do it together.\n\nNovember 15, 2022 7:00 pm ET\n\nA Terrible Thing to Waste: Environmental Racism and Its Assault on the American Mind by Harriet A. Washington\n\nVideo Meeting Link: meet.google.com/nvs-ehoq-vsw\n\nTo Dial in Using Phone Only: +1 347-201-4316\n\nPin: 568 022 004#\n\nMiddle-class African American households with incomes between $50,000 and $60,000 live in neighborhoods that are more polluted than those of very poor white households with incomes below $10,000.\n\nWhen swallowed, a lead-paint chip no larger than a fingernail can send a toddler into a coma â one-tenth of that amount will lower his IQ.\n\nNearly two of every five African American homes in Baltimore are plagued by lead-based paint. Almost all of the 37,500 Baltimore children who suffered lead poisoning between 2003 and 2015 were African American.\n\nFrom injuries caused by lead poisoning to the devastating effects of atmospheric pollution, infectious disease, and industrial waste, Americans of color are harmed by environmental hazards in staggeringly disproportionate numbers. This systemic onslaught of toxic exposure and institutional negligence causes irreparable physical harm to millions of people across the country-cutting lives tragically short and needlessly burdening our health care system. But these deadly environments create another insidious and often overlooked consequence: robbing communities of color, and America as a whole, of intellectual power.\n\nIn A Terrible Thing to Waste, award-winning science writer Harriet A. Washington argues that IQ is a biased and flawed metric, but that it is useful for tracking cognitive damage. She takes apart the spurious notion of intelligence as an inherited trait, using copious data that instead point to a different cause of the reported African American-white IQ gap: environmental racism â a confluence of racism and other institutional factors that relegate marginalized communities to living and working near sites of toxic waste, pollution, and insufficient sanitation services. She investigates heavy metals, neurotoxins, deficient prenatal care, bad nutrition, and even pathogens as chief agents influencing intelligence to explain why communities of color are disproportionately affected â and what can be done to remedy this devastating problem.\n\nJoin us even if you have not been able to read the book! In A Terrible Thing to Waste: Environmental Racism and its Assault on the American Mind, Harriet A. Washington discusses many instances of the long-ranging impacts of environmental racism on black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities. Her extensively researched book documents communities suffering with the effects from chemicals causing severe health complications and a lowering of IQ which can serve as âa predictor of success in school, social settings, work achievements, and lifetime earnings.â She investigates heavy metals, neurotoxins, deficient prenatal care, bad nutrition and pathogens as agents influencing intelligence to explain why communities of color are disproportionately affected. Washington ends with suggestions on actions that can taken individually and collectively to remedy these problems. Harriet Washington is the Shearing Fellow at the University of Nevadaâs Black Mountain Institute, a research fellow in medical ethics at Harvard Medical School and a senior research scholar at the National Center for Bioethics at Tuskegee University.\n\nNPR's Sarah McCammon spoke with author Harriet A. Washington about the incidences of environmental racism. (https://www.npr.org/2019/07/27/745925045/book-a-terrible-thing-to-waste) She asked “Why are people of color are disproportionately affected by this?” Washington responded “For the same reasons they're disproportionately affected by many things. It's various racist policies that have persisted for decades - and in some cases centuries - have herded them into areas where they are exposed to toxins. Segregation is a factor in many urban areas. Do you see this in your community?\n\nWashington pointed out that environmental poisoning inflicts a loss of intelligence and behavioral problems but that alarms have not been raised to these issues. Were you aware of the pervasiveness of these problems and the relationship between intelligence and pollution?\n\nHave you experienced or seen examples of environmental pollution affecting your education environment?\n\nWashington uses the loss of IQ as one of the consequences of environmental pollution. She indicates that IQ tests can measure a loss of cognition but it is an imperfect instrument. Although IQ can be used as a relative test of intellectual ability, it has also been used to justify a biased, intentional ranking of world peoples. Do you agree with the use of IQ as a data point for studying the impacts of environmental pollution? Are there other measures we might consider?\n\nWashington indicates that the IQ gap caused by environmental pollution, nutritional deficiencies, alcohol, drugs and pathogens can be closed with proper action. She does not agree that IQ is innate and permanent and that we have failed communities of color by not addressing these factors. What actions can educators use to help counteract the causes and impacts of environmental pollution?\n\nThere are 60,000 chemicals approved for the workplace, but testing is not usually done prior to use. Poverty and especially, race, are drivers in environmental exposure. Chemicals are far more likely to find their way into African-American, Hispanic and Native American communities which affect all aspects of their lives, including water, land and schools. Flint’s water supply with contamination by lead and Native American communities contaminated by uranium and coal mines are just 2 examples highlighted in the book. These pollutants affect all members of the community but can impact children and infants even more. Even small doses can trigger lifelong disabilities by hampering proper development of the brain. Was there an instance of pollution highlighted in the book that especially spoke to you?\n\nThe book highlights many examples of government, industry and political leaders who have evaded responsibility for environmental pollution. Additional examples come to light every year. One recent example is the radioactive contamination of an elementary school in the Midwest. What can be done to support healthy environments for our children?\n\nWashington suggests many steps that individuals can take to fight for a less toxic environment. This includes uplifting the grassroots environmental justice organizing of black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities. She also provides a helpful glossary and long list of “Known Chemical Brain Drainers” in addition to supporting a positive connection to the natural environment in childhood to optimize mental and physical health. Many Planet Stewards projects have developed school gardens, study areas and natural areas for native plants and animals. Are there opportunities for your students to enjoy natural, healthy surroundings outside?\n\nClimate change will increase the incidence and spread of pathogens and disease. Vectors will expand their territories and disseminate infectious diseases to communities that are not wealthy enough to deal with the factors that increase exposure and spread of disease. Why is an understanding of the health effects of climate change critical for everyone? What resources have you used about the health impacts of climate change?\n\nWashington outlined steps that can be taken by individuals and communities to fight for a less toxic environment. These include:\n\nEnroll in Pre-K\n\nFight toxins in schools\n\nPoison-proof your home (air quality, vermin control, vacuuming, cleaning supplies)\n\nPoison-proof your water (HDPE, filters)\n\nProvide poison-free food (home canning, iodized salt, avoid processed food)\n\nAvoid heavy metals (batteries, lead, pesticides)\n\nWhat steps have you taken to develop healthy environments for your family?\n\nMonday, September 13, 2021\n\nHoot by Carl Hiaasen\n\nIn this 2003 Newberry award winning book weâre introduced to Roy, and his first acquaintance in Florida, Dana Matherson, a well-known bully. Then again, if Dana hadn't been sinking his thumbs into Roy's temples and mashing his face against the school-bus window, Roy might never have spotted the running boy. And the running boy is intriguing: he was running away from the school bus, carried no books, and here's the odd part - wore no shoes. Sensing a mystery, Roy sets himself on the boy's trail. The chase introduces him to potty-trained alligators, a fake-fart champion, some burrowing owls, a renegade eco-avenger, and several extremely poisonous snakes with unnaturally sparkling tails. Roy has most definitely arrived in Carl Hiaasen's Florida, where the creatures are wild and the people are wilder!\n\nThe World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Oceanâs are One by Sylvia Earle\n\nA Silent Spring for our era, this eloquent, urgent, fascinating book reveals how just 50 years of swift and dangerous oceanic change threatens the very existence of life on Earth. Legendary marine scientist Sylvia Earle portrays a planet teetering on the brink of irreversible environmental crisis.\n\nIn recent decades weâve learned more about the ocean than in all previous human history combined. But, even as our knowledge has exploded, so too has our power to upset the delicate balance of this complex organism.\n\nFortunately, there is reason for hope, but what we doâor fail to doâin the next ten years may well resonate for the next ten thousand. The ultimate goal, Earle argues passionately and persuasively, is to find responsible, renewable strategies that safeguard the natural systems that sustain us. The first step is to understand and act upon the wise message of this accessible, insightful, and compelling book.\n\nA Tale of 2 Planets by John Freeman\n\nIn A Tale of Two Planets John Freeman draws together a group of writers from around the world to help us see how the environmental crisis is hitting some of the most vulnerable communities where they live.\n\nIn the past five years he has compiled two anthologies that deal with income inequality as it is experienced. In the course of this work, one major theme came up repeatedly: Climate change is making already dire inequalities much worse, devastating further the already devastated. But the problems of climate change are not restricted to those from the less developed world.\n\nGalvanized by his conversations with writers and activists around the world, Freeman engaged with some of todayâs most eloquent storytellers, many of whom hail from the places under the most acute stressâfrom the capital of Burundi to Bangkok, Thailand. The response has been extraordinary. Margaret Atwood conjures a dystopian future in a remarkable poem. Lauren Groff whisks us to Florida; Edwidge Danticat to Haiti; Tahmima Anam to Bangladesh; Yasmine El Rashidi to Egypt, while Eka Kurniawan brings us to Indonesia, Chinelo Okparanta to Nigeria, and Anuradha Roy to the Himalayas in the wake of floods, dam building, and drought. This is a literary all-points bulletin of fiction, essays, poems, and reportage about the most important crisis of our times.\n\nThe Sea Around Us by Rachel Carson\n\nPublished in 1951, The Sea Around Us is one of the most remarkably successful books ever written about the natural world. Rachel Carson's rare ability to combine scientific insight with moving, poetic prose catapulted her book to first place on The New York Times best-seller list, where it enjoyed wide attention for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It remained on the list for more than a year and a half and ultimately sold well over a million copies, has been translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the 1952 National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal.\n\nThis classic work remains as fresh today as when it first appeared. Carson's writing teems with stunning, memorable images--the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds of fathoms below the surface; and incredibly powerful tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in the Bay of Fundy. Quite simply, she captures the mystery and allure of the ocean with a compelling blend of imagination and expertise.\n\nPlastic Free: The Inspiring Story of a Global Environmental Movement and Why It Matters by Rebecca Prince-Ruiz and Joanna Atherfold Finn\n\nWhen Plastic Free July founder Rebecca Prince-Ruiz made a commitment to try to avoid single-use plastic a decade ago, the decision started at her bin. In the first half of 2020, a year of unexpected change, the humble bin has been in the limelight again, though for very different reasons. Aussies, their laconic sense of humour coming to the fore during the pandemic, used their weekly bin outing as an opportunity to dress up in outlandish costumes, the theory being that our bins were going out more than we were.\n\nPlastic Free: The Inspiring Story of a Global Environmental Movement and Why It Matters is, at its heart, a book about how ordinary people can make extraordinary changes. It tells the story of Plastic Free July, a social phenomenon involving over 250 million people in 177 countries. Most importantly, it shows how a determined community can be a formidable force.\n\nBlackfish City by Sam J. Miller\n\nAfter the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical and social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The cityâs denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edgesâcrime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called âthe breaksâ is ravaging the population.\n\nWhen a strange new visitor arrivesâa woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her sideâthe city is entranced. The âorcamancer,â as sheâs known, very subtly brings together four peopleâeach living on the peripheryâto stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.\n\nBlackfish City is a remarkably urgentâand ultimately very hopefulânovel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection."
