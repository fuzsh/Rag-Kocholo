You can ignore their concerns if you think they are overblown but doing so doesn’t make them go away; on the contrary there was a real possibility we could have had an electoral result last night you would have been unhappy with (I would have been equally displeased).\n\n“…they’ll just go smoke on the sidewalks.”\n\nGreat, that’s where they should be smoking, not on the subway.\n\n“And the huge amount of money handed over to the police as overtime would be much better spent by directing it to the shelter system.”\n\nAgreed, but a lifetime of living here has shown that NYC government is not serious about improving the shelter system. Believe me, I wish they would. And I’ve never said or believed that the NYPD is the solution to the homeless issue. However, if a mentally ill homeless individual is posing a direct threat to the personal safety of subway riders, or worse, by committing an assault, that becomes a criminal issue, it has moved beyond the scope of a social safety issue.\n\n“…or harassing churro sellers…”\n\nI’m not in favor of harassing churro sellers either, but have you ever considered why the police are doing so? It’s not about collecting fines, though that is reflexively what many think. It’s so you don’t get food poisoning from eating something that is contaminated, being sold by an unlicensed vendor.\n\nSame concept as the Health Department food inspectors going to restaurants and assigning letter grades. It’s not so they can get their jollies by hassling small businesses. And since the Health Dept does not patrol the subways, and if you would rather the police not do this, who should undertake this task? Or maybe you don’t care who sells whatever, wherever?\n\nAnd speaking of small businesses, what about the guy who leases out a subway newsstand at a high rent and pays taxes and jumps through bureaucratic hoops just to keep his head above water? Is it fair that they have unregulated and unlicensed competition from someone who can just set up shop on a platform? The issue is no different than someone who sets up a table on a sidewalk in front of a store selling the same goods as found in the store. Is it fair for that shopkeeper, who pays taxes, fees, and follows a myriad of state and local laws, to be undercut from just anyone with a table and a bunch of cheap wares?\n\n“We went over this with Cuomo back in 2019, when the plan was to spend $249 million on cops to stop $200 million of fare evasion.”\n\nNot a fan of Cuomo, despised him, glad he is gone, don’t know if your figures are accurate, but my original point still stands. The subway is not free, full stop. There needs to be enforcement. It may cost more than the loss of revenue in the short term, but in the long term it will discourage the majority of those who are not habitual fare evaders but for whatever reason now feel it is OK to just not pay. I mean those who were not traditionally inclined to avoid the fare before the pandemic.\n\nIn the past it would be just kids having fun, or repeat offenders. Not so anymore. Now it’s people from all walks of life. Young couples out on dates, helping each other over the turnstile. Grown men, by all appearances not hurting for money, probably on their way to work, who are either jumping or going through the emergency gate. I have seen young women who pay their fare, and then hold the gate open for complete strangers, waving them through like they are doing them some huge favor.\n\nWhat is this all about? Are they making a political statement? Do they think they are sticking it to the “system?” Making themselves feel better because they believe they helped an economically disadvantaged person? On the contrary, they have placed themselves and the one they helped in legal jeopardy.\n\nIs it about economics? Maybe a little, but not entirely. There are programs in place to obtain a reduced fare for those who are economically disadvantaged, they should look it up on their phones and take advantage.\n\nAs an aside, in comparison to our world peer systems, the NYC Subway fare is a relative bargain, a flat fee not based on zones or distance. Each fare covers over 60% of the cost of carrying that rider, among the highest ratio among American transit systems.\n\nJust imagine for a moment if the fare had not been intentionally kept low for decades in the early to mid-20th Century and instead had tracked with inflation. Decades of disinvestment could have been avoided, but the fare could very well be hovering around $4 or $5 today. Can you imagine if that was the cost of taking a ride today? Would that be a license for everyone to just avoid paying?\n\n“These quality-of-life problems are problems, but cops are not the solution, and describing it through the “rising crime!” scare tactic is exactly the sort of thing that risks getting Zeldin elected.”\n\nYes, that was my point exactly, which I believe I made twice in my original comment, and again just above. Police are not always the right solution. Not every problem is a nail needing a hammer. The last thing I wanted to see was Zeldin anywhere near the Governor’s mansion in Albany, so I am ecstatic he lost last night.\n\nBut you and many others are just not getting it – not getting the mood of many people all around you. Some, maybe more than you think, are bothered by what is happening, and even if you think it’s overblown and their fears are unwarranted, there is enough disorder out there to have given many people pause when it comes to their electoral preferences. You should give that serious thought. Last night could have been a very regressive step for NY had Zeldin been elected. We dodged a bullet.\n\nThe broader issue of public disorder needs to be addressed. It should not be accepted as a “cool NY thing” which I’ve heard some say. Let’s look beyond the subway – look at the packs of illegal dirt bikes and ATVs that have run roughshod over the streets for the last couple of years (though the NYPD may finally be getting a handle on this); look at the proliferation of e-bike drivers who don’t give a damn about traffic laws and go wherever they want – crosswalks, sidewalks, running red lights, weaving in and out pedestrian crowds. The worst of the pandemic is mostly over and should no longer be an excuse for these types of anti-social behavior, which should have been addressed before it took hold.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a transportation blog focused on railways – so I’ll bring it back to that – the election of Kathy Hochul as the governor of New York State is the best outcome for the future of the MTA and the NYC subway. She is pro-infrastructure and pro-transportation. She is willing to trust the senior leadership of the MTA to do the right thing and not micro-manage them the way her predecessor did. She is championing the Interborough Express, a worthy project of immense value that could be a game changer for outer borough travel. She will be presenting a state budget in January when we will see what her transportation priorities are. I am optimistic."
