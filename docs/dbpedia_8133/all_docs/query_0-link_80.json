        "text": "“When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.’ So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.” Luke 19:5-6\n\nHave you ever considered that Zacchaeus gladly welcomed Jesus to his home? Given his occupation — a tax collector whom many despised — you might think he would have hid among the leaves of that sycamore tree. But he didn’t; he came down, escorted Jesus to his home, and threw a little party, and an unplanned one at that.\n\nI wonder who else joined them. Probably not those who watched this happen; they were muttering, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.” I can picture them with arms crossed and faces scowling.\n\nBut something tells me Zacchaeus would have welcomed his enemies to his home that day. Consider his new heart when he says, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” His generous heart flowed in love for the poor, and his pocketbook with justice for mistreated clients.\n\nWhat explains his change of heart? One clue is the reason he climbed the tree — “he wanted to see who Jesus was.” And who did he see? He saw someone worthy of calling “Lord.” Perhaps Jesus’ reputation preceded him. Maybe Zacchaeus knew that with Jesus, wine overflowed, blind saw, lame walked, and dead people revived. Jesus was a rock star and the rich taxman had to catch a look. And now, with Jesus present in the flesh, Zacchaeus humbled himself, acknowledged his wrong-doing, and sought to make things right.\n\nDear God, thank you for sending Jesus to show us a life worth imitating. May I bow in awe of His glory and from that place open my heart to people. Show me whom I may invite to my home to celebrate the presence of Jesus. Amen.\n\nBy Dr. Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nRECEIVE These Devotionals Daily by email: FOLLOW THIS Link to Subscribe\n\nFollow Us On: Facebook • Twitter • Instagram • Pinterest\n\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.” Revelation 4:8b\n\nRecently I heard someone complain about the over-use of the word “awesome”.\n\n“Let’s go out to McDonald’s for lunch” a friend poses. “Awesome!” someone responds.\n\n“Did you watch The Big Bang Theory?” a friend asks. “Yes, it was awesome.”\n\n“How do you like your 2002 Chevy Impala?” “Love it! It’s awesome.”\n\nBy definition, awesome means “causing or inducing awe; inspiring an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, or fear.” Perhaps the prospect of a fast food snack, a situation comedy, or an old car can inspire admiring reverent respect. Or maybe not, and better wording is due.\n\nGod is awesome. He is also holy, another term far too misused or over used. “Holy” has diverse meanings, yet when we think of God as holy, the definitions that stand out are “entitled to worship or veneration as sacred” as well as “inspiring fear or awe.”\n\nJohn’s glimpse of heaven in Revelation pictures God on a throne surrounded by four winged creatures who do not stop singing “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come,” and twenty-four elders whose job is to remove their crowns, place them before God and declare, “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created, and have their being.”\n\nCan we be in similar awe of God? Will we join the singers and crown-layers in giving God worth? Can we realize God’s holiness as grounds for us adoring and worshiping our Creator?\n\nDear God, you are holy and worthy of my worship. Help me understand afresh your mysterious and mighty role as the beginning, middle, and end of all things.\n\nBy Dr. Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFURTHER READING\n\n• Who Alone is Worthy? by Suzanne Benner\n\n• Ponder the Holiness of God\n\n• GOD IS HOLY . . . – by Dr. Bill Bright\n\nRECEIVE These Devotionals Daily by email: FOLLOW THIS Link to Subscribe\n\nFollow Us On: Facebook • Twitter • Instagram • Pinterest\n\nGod the Creator by John Calvin is a profound look at God’s role in creating, sustaining, and redeeming his creation, including us.\n\n“You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him, who formed it, ‘He did not make me’? Can the pot say of the potter, “He knows nothing”? Isaiah 29:16\n\nRecently an acquaintance expressed frustration with God. She felt he was allowing too many hardships in her life. While she did not say so, her words and attitude made me wonder if she blamed God for her misfortunes.\n\nIt’s easy to hang our heartaches on God. Why is my life so hard? Why can’t my life be happy like other people? When will you fix my world, God?\n\nThe apostle Paul reminds us of Isaiah’s metaphor: “Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”\n\nI am convinced I can become bitter toward God if I believe two myths: 1) I deserve to be happy, and 2) God is in charge of making it so. In truth, God is more interested in us becoming like Jesus and living life abundantly, and if we’re happy along the way that’s bonus. He also asks us to obey his ways and by doing so we enjoy many blessings.\n\nDo you find yourself whining at God? Do you give God credit as Creator and recognize us as created? What attitude should flow from understanding that God made us, that he doesn’t ‘owe’ us, and that he has given us guidelines to enjoy a redeemed life?\n\nGod, forgive me for grumbling about my lot in life; humble me to accept who I am and this life of mine. Guide me in your ways that I may enjoy your life abundant. Amen.\n\nThought: Buy a small potted plant. Nurture it.

That is, our struggles were considered to be against the Devil or demons who might trip us up as we tried to live for Jesus.\n\nMore recently I have come to appreciate the first half of the teaching. That is, we are not in a physical war of sword fights, cuts, and bruises, but one of power struggle against rulers and authorities who plan life without God. In more practical terms it means we ought to struggle against people in positions of power who lord it over those beneath them, taking advantage by treating them unfairly or squelching their freedoms to grow in faith.\n\nPut in different terms again, to say our fight is against rulers and authorities means there are times when we should stand up for what is right, to defend the widow and orphan and immigrant, and not allow powerful leaders to run rough shod over anyone.\n\nDo you see the misuse of power around you at work?\n\nDo you see it in your neighborhood?\n\nWhat might you do to give voice to those under the thumb of meanies?\n\nHow might you help ‘the least of these’ so you can love as Jesus called us to?\n\nGod, help me understand that You want me to be a change agent for what’s right and good at work and around my neighborhood. May I be a voice for the people who feel powerless to help themselves. Amen.\n\nAction Point: Step in to situations where you can make wrong situations right.

Conflict among believers? Conflict among Christian leaders! When we read the powerful stories of the Holy Spirit’s movements in Acts, this episode between Paul and Barnabas stands out as a blemish.\n\nBy now they had ministered in many cities throughout the Roman Empire, silenced a false prophet, explained Jesus’ place in Jewish history, performed miracles, and been mistaken as Zeus and Hermes (Greek gods). And they had weathered rejection, abusive language, even stoning. But in Pamphylia, their third partner, John Mark, suddenly left them to go home to Jerusalem (Acts 13:13).\n\nThat became a sore point. Acts 15:38 states Paul didn’t think having John Mark rejoin them was a wise decision. Perhaps Paul didn’t wish to trust a deserter with so much on the line. Paul had churches to visit, sermons to preach, Jews and Gentiles to enlighten about the Good News of Jesus. He valued gospel proclamation. Barnabas, it seems, wanted to give John Mark a second chance, to mend a fence, to build up a young believer who probably felt horrible about ditching them.\n\nWe can learn a few lessons here:\n\nWe may be called to unity of purpose (Romans 5:5-6), but our means might differ. Both Paul’s big picture approach and Barnabas’ relational one grew the church.\n\nConflict may be difficult, but good can come of it. In this case, Paul and Silas went one direction, and Barnabas and Mark another — all to visit new churches in order to build them up.\n\nConflict is a part of life, and good-meaning people rub each other the wrong way routinely. The question is how we will deal with it — either destructively or constructively?\n\nDear God, please help me see that conflict with people may be your way of growing me and people around me. May I not wish it away, or run from it, but may I find your good in it. Amen.\n\nBy Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFURTHER READING\n\n• Every Conflict – by Max Lucado\n\n• When Satan Hinders You – by Charles Stanley\n\n• God our Guide – by Phil Ware\n\n“Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn; look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth.” Isaiah 50:1-2a\n\nIn this passage, the Prophet Isaiah seeks to comfort the people of Israel. So, he begins with a plea: If you want to pursue a good and holy life, then listen to me. Pay attention to the One from whom you were created, and to the wise patriarchs from whom your identity was shaped.\n\nIsaiah’s words are poetic and beautiful, but what does it mean to listen to God? How might we listen to Him today?\n\nRecently I chatted with experts in listening attentively and empathetically to callers who suffer from depression, loneliness, or various life hang-ups. I asked, “What does it mean to listen to God? More than that, how do we listen to God?” The responses came quickly:\n\n1. Get still, and undistracted.\n\n2. Pray and commune with God’s Spirit.\n\n3. Read the Word and consider its meaning for you.\n\n4. Seek counsel from godly people you trust.\n\n5. Spend time in the grandeur of creation.\n\nAs follow-up, I asked another question. “What gets in the way of listening to God these ways?” One person smiled and said, “Just ignore the list above!” Upon further reflection, others offered that hindrances included busyness, computer screen time, worry, and not planning to listen.\n\nPerhaps it is time to pause, get quiet, and listen for God’s still small voice in silence of prayer, His Word, observing His creation, or in an intentional conversation with a respected and godly friend. But, if we do that, will we listen?\n\nDear God, thank you for your presence. May I take steps today to slow down, become aware of your prompting, meditate on your Word, and listen well to a wise person, so I may hear your voice of comfort and conscience. Amen.\n\nBy Dr. Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\n“…the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.’” Luke 1:30-31 (Read the whole chapter)\n\nHave you ever known a woman who is pregnant and whose baby is due around Christmas? Along with general anxiety regarding the delivery and health of her child, I wonder about other feelings and thoughts she may have. Will she rue that his or her birthday falls so close to Christmas? Will birthday celebrations get lost or muted amidst the hubbub of late December? Will the child feel cheated for not receiving gifts during another month of the year?\n\nThese matters only matter because of the holiday. What about the first Christmas? Have you ever wondered how Mary felt? Her anticipation must have been unique.\n\nMary learned of her pregnancy from the angel Gabriel. I wonder what Mary thought Jesus’ birth would bring. Did she expect hosts of angels trumpeting the news? Mary likely prepared her home for the delivery, expecting to have Jesus there. Did she anticipate a painful, awkward donkey ride to her in-laws’ town of origin? Could she ever have anticipated delivery in a barn? I wonder if she pondered how her God-child would look, act, live. Would he be like most kids? Could she ever predict he would be cherished and spurned, followed and chased, worshiped and demonized? Even with the Spirit of the Lord upon her, could she know that Jesus’ birth, while humble and simple, would be celebrated by millions upon millions for millennia? Could she have known that he would die a brutal death for her and our salvation?\n\nWe see these truths through history, and look forward to celebrating them. Yet like Mary we may not be able to predict all Christmas might bring, for we do not celebrate rituals, but the Christ-child, and when He is center to the party, angels may appear.\n\nDear God, thank you for the model of Mary who not knowing all that was to come still entered into your plan to save the world.

It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors.” Hebrews 8:8-9\n\nDo you remember the film Monsters, Inc? In one scene, Mike Wazowski arrives at work and bumps into Roz, his boss. Roz chides him for not turning in his assignment and tells him she is watching him closely from now on in case he slips up again.\n\nHave you ever felt like Mike Wazowski in your walk with God? Do you feel like God is sitting in heaven with his with arms crossed, waiting for you to mess up?\n\nThe children of Israel likely felt so. The original deal God made with them was a contract: If you obey my laws, then I will prosper you. Eat this, avoid that. Work now, rest later. Sacrifice a goat, and then I will forgive you.\n\nIn time, the number of laws grew from the original Ten Commandments to over six hundred! And while God’s intentions were honest — he wanted them to realize their need for him, and to enjoy a holy life — nobody could jump that high or possibly keep every single one.\n\nSo God made a new plan, a new covenant. God sent Jesus to live and die for us, and provided his Spirit to bring light and bear fruit within us — putting his law of love in our hearts and minds.\n\nSo instead of God waiting for you to mess up, and we all mess up, he provided a way to forgive the mistakes and a Helper to guide your heart and mind to do better.\n\n*Dear God, thank you for your new covenant, one that is “not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life” (2 Corinthians 3:6). May I rest in your grace to know that I need not ‘jump higher’ through hoops, but only trust in Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nIt is always best to confess as soon after we mess up as possible. Today, will you do that with God, and if your goof affected someone else, with them?\n\nBy Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFurther Reading\n\n• God’s Covenant – Devotional by Terry Stead\n\n• A Clean Plate – A Devotional by Idelette McVicker\n\n• Unshakable – A Devotional by Roy Lessin\n\nSUBSCRIBE BY EMAIL: FOLLOW THIS LINK\n\nFollow Us On: Facebook • Twitter • Instagram • Pinterest\n\nRead Contentment by Richard Swen\n\n“…I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.” Philippians 4:11b-13\n\nWhere I live October is a transition month. By October summer is all put away. The lawnmower sits idle in the shed, and deck chairs lean against the back of the house. Annual flowers once in full bloom now rot in compost piles, the wooden window boxes from which they came are empty, dusty, and gray. The garden hose is safely away where winter frost cannot freeze remaining water to bulge and crack its lining. Where I live October marks the time when maples once afire with reds and oranges begin looking skeleton, their stick bones arching into grey skies. Mornings turn cold, and you are happy to see the sun for half a day and rarely full-on warm. Geese cruise south in misshapen V’s, and somewhere up river salmon die by the millions after spawning. October is when we lessen outdoor activities and start trying to keep warm and dry. The morning mist and low clouds can get to you. In October the change from fun and sun to glum highlights the difference between happiness and joy of spirit. I have heard that the difference between the two is their source. Happiness derives from external things like merry-go-rounds, ice cream, and walks on the beach, while joy comes from an inner contentment from being known and loved.\n\nDo you know that God loves you? That he yearns for you to invite him more deeply into your life? That he hopes to be your strength and contentment when seasons change?\n\nHelp me Lord to rest in your provision, that you know and love and care for me deeply. Help me open my life to you so I may know your joy more fully.

Wow. That’s harsh judgment just for calling someone an idiot, don’t you think? Some people deserve to be mocked, put in their place, or deemed off their rocker, don’t you agree?\n\nOut of context Jesus’ words seem to be over the top. However, he’s saying something much more significant, something I need to hear, because way down deep I find it easy to judge others, to criticize, to find fault with them.\n\nHere’s the full text:\n\n“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca, ’[a term of contempt] is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.”\n\nWhy? The best I can figure is that Jesus wants us to value people as he does. He said he came to redeem people, not judge them (John 3:16-17), and reminds us that everyone is made in God’s image, a precious creation of the Father and worthy of respect.\n\nWhen we criticize, we play God. We sit on our puny little throne and look down at others with pointed finger and declare “I’m better than you, and you need to straighten up, get a life, and be as good as me!” How arrogant we are to see ourselves as so holy that we can judge others.\n\nAre you like me in finding it all too easy to judge and name-call? Can you agree that we too mess up and need to show humility? What do people need besides our critical comments?\n\nDear God, thank you for your grace toward me, because I don’t measure up any more than people around me. Help me extend grace and patience to them just as I hope you will do towards me. Amen.\n\nThought: Maybe you hammered someone with criticism in a holier-than-thou fashion.

But if it dies, it produces many seeds.” John 12:24\n\nIn a TV drama I recently watched, an artist sat deep in thought in front of a painting that hung in a gallery. The picture resembled two rectangles one atop the other, the bottom one black, the upper one yellow. On the horizon of the dark piece an errant bump broke the otherwise flat skyline.\n\nThe artist appeared despondent before the painting—his painting—and took out a knife to destroy it. His anguish rose over years as museum visitors ignored or derided his work. “Weird,” “dumb,” “meaningless” he heard, so he yearned to end the pain.\n\nBut today was different. A young boy approached the artist and thanked him for his art, and then handed him a “completed version” to consider. The child had redrawn the picture with one addition: the black bump sprouted a small flower. He said the bump spoke of the hope he longed for.\n\nJesus said similar things in John 12:24 when He predicted His death and spoke of seeds dying in order to multiply. In many respects His life was only a small black bump in the history of the universe, but down deep it offered hope for everyone. Through His obedience, and death, He provided a way for salvation and new life for all who believe. Jesus’ death and resurrection brings hope to those who lean on Him.\n\nGod, thank You for the sacrifice of Your Son, and for raising him up again. In faith I accept Your payment for my sin in Jesus’ death, and new life in You through Jesus’ resurrection. Amen.\n\nWhen you see flowers today, consider them a sign of new hope through the death and resurrection of Jesus.\n\nby Dr. Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFurther Reading\n\n• God does Big Things with Small Deeds– by Max Lucado\n\n• A Timely Word – A Devotional by Donna Mitchell\n\n• Seed Planters – What Seeds are You Planting? – by Shelaine Strom\n\n“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” Matthew 11:28\n\nJesus words to his disciples confused me as a child, and honestly they still do now. When I was young I thought a godly life meant avoiding things that others in town enjoyed freely. I was on the outside looking in as my youthful peers spoke of their first cigarette, drink, and engagements with girls. Their lives seemed carefree, and mine a burden.\n\nI remember commenting once to my father as a teenager that I wish I had come to faith from a life of drug addiction because then my testimony would be powerfully compelling. He smiled and said, “But just think of all the heartache you’ve avoided by the path you have taken.”\n\nDallas Willard speaks similarly in a chapter titled “The Secret of the Easy Yoke.” He writes, “To depart from righteousness is to choose a life of crushing burdens, failures, and disappointments, a life caught in the toils of endless problems that are never resolved. Here is the source of that unending soap opera, that sometimes horror show known as normal human life. The ‘cost of discipleship,’ though it may take all we have, is small when compared to the lot of those who don’t accept Christ’s invitation to be a part of his company in The Way of life.” (In The Spirit of the Disciplines).\n\nDo you seek reprieve from a “soap opera” life? Have you been fed the lie that following God will mean just one more burden? What’s keeping you from leaning on God and following his ways? Doing so may bring rest for your soul like you have never known.\n\nGod, I desperately seek the restful yoke of following you. Help me choose your way so that I may know your pleasure and peace rather than the horror show I know today.\n\nThought: Name one thing you know you want to do but will only lead to heartache.

She was thrilled. Sometime later her mother noticed that she kept touching the end of the cue, and mum asked her to stop. She removed her hand and declared, “I’m not touching it!” Again mum caught her, and requested her to stop, and again she boldly claimed “I’m not touching it!”\n\nMy wife winked at the 10-year-old and said, “Do you know what’s on the tip of that stick? Blue chalk. If you are not touching it, then your hand should be clean.” The youngster opened her hand to reveal a Smurf-blue palm. She froze, and made no comment. And never did.\n\nPutting oily hands on cue tips is a small transgression; the larger problem was the girl’s stubbornness to admit her fault. Even when caught blue-handed she refused to make amends for disobeying her mum.\n\nHave you met people who refuse to deal with sin in their life, who cross their arms and huff “I’ve done nothing wrong!”? Our pride makes it particularly hard to admit and confess our sin.\n\nAnd yet consider God’s great love for us, prideful as we are. Romans 5:8 says, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”\n\nGod’s show of goodwill in providing Christ as a sacrifice for our sin is a wonderful gift. The humble person will admit their sin and accept Christ’s gift. A foolish person will continue on with crossed arms believing they don’t need forgiveness.\n\nGod’s sacrificial love is here for the taking. Have you confessed your sin and welcomed his forgiveness?\n\nDear God, my hands are blue with guilt for things I know displease you. Forgive me, and help me live responsibly in the joy of your forgiveness. Amen.\n\nThought: Confessing to friends or family kicks in accountability to stay clear of future sin. Open up with someone close to you about sin in your life.\n\nAs we experience God’s love, it spills to people around us.\n\nRead ‘The Fruitful Life: The Overflow of God’s Love Through You‘ by Jerry Bridges\n\nBy Dr. Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFurther Reading\n\n• Sin Whispers\n\n• Aphids and Sin\n\n• Pressing the Reset Button on your Life\n\n“’But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.’” Luke 15:20\n\nThe story of the father with two sons captures the gospel story for two sorts of people. The first are like the younger son who decided against his better judgment to demand his inheritance early, move to a distant land, and squander it on loose living with women and wine. When he came to his senses, he realized that his father’s servants living under his care and provision had it better than he did. So he went home.\n\nThe parallel is to all of us who have thumbed our nose at God, demanded life on our terms, and trudged off to enjoy worldly pleasures only to find they satisfy for a season.\n\nThe second are like the older son who remained faithful to father and home, working the fields and earning an honest wage. Yet when his little brother returned, his heart burned with anger against sibling and father, for in his eyes the first wasn’t worth celebrating and the latter was foolish for doing so. “You’ve never thrown a party for me,” he hurled. Dad’s response? ““My son … you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ (Luke 15:31)\n\nWhich son are you like?\n\nIs God waiting for you to come down the lane, eager to throw his arms around you?\n\nOr is God reminding you of the riches you already have in Him—His purpose, peace, and plans?\n\nDear God, it is so easy to think that life without you is free, fun, and easy. Help me see that in You I find significance. And once there, may I glory in Your riches, for they are new each day. Amen.\n\nRepent of any narrow thinking that life on your terms is better than resting in the treasures of God.\n\nby Bill Strom\n\nUsed by Permission\n\nFurther Reading\n\n• Success to Significance – Rick Brekelbaum on Success\n\n• Your Dream Job – by Christa Hardin\n\n• A Most Important Work – by Caran Jantzen\n\nSUBSCRIBE BY EMAIL: FOLLOW THIS LINK\n\nFollow Us On: Facebook • Twitter • Instagram • Pinterest\n\n“So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace.” Judges 6:24\n\nThe story of God calling Gideon to deliver his people Israel begins unceremoniously. The Midianites are bullying their way through Jewish territory routinely, taking crops, slaughtering animals, and scaring Gideon’s people into the caves and ravines of local mountains. So desperate the times and dire their future, even Gideon, a soldier, threshed grain in the bottom of a dried up wine press so as to avoid detection from his enemies.\n\nAnd then God’s angel approached him, saying, “The Lord is with you, mighty warrior” even though Gideon looked more like a scared school boy in a hopeless fight with recess meanies. But the Lord continued, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?”\n\nWhen Gideon later realized that he had come face-to-face with the angel of the Lord and lived, he humbled himself and took up God’s call. He also built an altar and called it “The Lord Is Peace.”\n\nI wonder why Gideon called God peace. Was it for sparing his life despite their close encounter? Was it for strength to know he could take on the Midianites and win? In the end Gideon didn’t raise a sword as God worked miraculously through 300 men to turn the Midianites upon themselves. Perhaps in this instance God wanted us to understand his peaceful intentions, his presence to find peace despite adversity all around.\n\nGod, you are Yahweh-Shalom, The Lord Is Peace. Help me know your peace and your ways to handle difficult people and situations today.\n\nThought: One peaceful option for handling conflict is to forgive the perpetrator. Forgive someone who has hurt you.\n\nCan you call God your peace?
