        "text": "With less than 4 weeks to go until the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Races the formalities of the crew announcement took place today. So that means it’s time for me to have a close look at the various crews that will represent the two Universities in one of the oldest annual sporting contest in the world and do a seat-by-seat comparison.\n\nFirst of all the men’s crews.\n\nBow\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Patrick Elwood\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 23\n\nHeight: 192cm\n\nWeight: 85.3kg\n\nElwood learnt his rowing at Broxbourne Rowing Club in Essex. Reading for a PhD in Astrophysics he was a member of the losing Goldie crews in 2016 and 2017. Now he finally wins a seat in the Blue Boat and will be looking for his first victory over the Championship course.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Iain Mandale (President)\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 25\n\nHeight: 182cm\n\nWeight: 75.1kg\n\nThe Oxford President already has three race wins to his credit racing for Isis in 2013-15. Now reading for an MBA he is set to win his first Blue. He learnt his rowing at Kingston Grammar School and rowed for Great Britain at the U23 World Championships winning a silver medal in the BLM4- in 2014.\n\nVerdict: a narrow advantage to Oxford, two members of the reserves now stepping up to the Blue Boat. Mandale has the edge with his three reserve wins and his international experience\n\n2\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Charlie Fisher\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 23\n\nHeight: 198cm\n\nWeight: 90.7kg\n\nA member of the winning 2016 Cambridge crew, Fisher missed out on a Blue last season and raced in the losing Goldie crew. He learnt to row at Kings’ College Wimbledon and represented Great Britain at the Coupe De La Jeunesse in 2012 winning a gold medal in the JM8.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Felix Drinkall\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 18\n\nHeight: 196cm\n\nWeight: 83.8kg\n\nThe youngest man in the race, and the only undergraduate in the Dark Blue boat, Drinkall is an outstanding young oarsman. The old-Etonian won a bronze medal at the junior world championships in 2016 in the JM8 and followed that up with a gold in the JM4- in 2017. At the first GB trial in November he and partner Tobias Schroeder took the overall win in the 5K time trial (14 seconds ahead of the fastest Cambridge pair).\n\nVerdict: Fisher has greater experience of the Boat Race, which can be crucial in a tight race, but Drinkall is an outstanding young oarsman. I reckon this is even.\n\n3\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Dara Alizadeh\n\nNationality: American\n\nAge: 24\n\nHeight: 192cm\n\nWeight: 90.1kg\n\nA graduate of Penn University, Alizadeh learnt to row at Belmont Hill School in Massachusetts. In 2015 he made his international debut racing for the USA in the M8 at the U23 World Championships coming away with a silver medal. He spent the 2017 season coaching and teaching Economics at Winchester College.\n\nOxford\n\nName: William Cahill\n\nNationality: South African\n\nAge: 25\n\nHeight: 183cm\n\nWeight: 84.3kg\n\nCahill raced in the victorious Isis crew in 2017 and is a graduate of the University of Cape Town. He has international representative honours having raced for South Africa at the World University Games.\n\nVerdict: A narrow advantage to Cambridge. Cahill of Oxford has the advantage of having raced over the Championship course last year as a reserve, but Alizadeh’s greater international experience just gives him the edge.\n\n4\n\nCambridge\n\nName: James Letten\n\nNationality: American\n\nAge: 24\n\nHeight: 208cm\n\nWeight: 106.5kg\n\nThe heaviest man in this year’s race and also the tallest man ever to row in the Boat Race, Letten is set to win his 2nd Blue having been a member of the losing Cambridge crew last year. The University of Wisconsin graduate represented the USA at the World University Games in 2013 sitting in the 5 seat of the M8 that finished 6th.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Anders Weiss\n\nNationality: American\n\nAge: 25\n\nHeight: 195.5cm\n\nWeight: 91.5kg\n\nThe most experienced man in the Oxford boat in terms of international experience, Weiss raced for the USA at the 2013 U23 World Championships winning a silver medal in the M8. He made his senior international debut at the Rio Olympic Games where he partnered Nareg Guregian to an 11th place finish in the M2-. He raced the same event at the Sarasota World Championships last season, this time partnered by Michael Colella, again taking 11th place. A “Walk-On” at Brown University he helped them to a strong 3rd place at the IRA Championships.\n\nVerdict: In this battle of the Americans its advantage to the Dark Blues. Letten has the advantage of a Boat Race campaign already under his belt, but Weiss is a seasoned international which gives him the edge.\n\n5\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Spencer Furey\n\nNationality: American\n\nAge: 24\n\nHeight: 193cm\n\nWeight: 89.6kg\n\nThe 3rd American in the Cambridge boat, Furey is a graduate of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. Whilst at the “Big Green” he stroked the Varsity 8 that finished 9th at the IRA Championships last year. Dartmouth also made the trip to Henley Royal Regatta last season to race in the Ladies Plate narrowly losing to the German U23’s from Bayer Leverkusen in the first round.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Will Geffen\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 22\n\nHeight: 186cm\n\nWeight: 87.2kg\n\nGeffen is one of three returning Dark Blues, although he won his Blue as part of the outstanding Oxford boat of 2015. He also has a winning appearance with Isis in 2016. He learnt to row at Eton and in 2013 he raced for GB at the Junior World Championships finishing 6th in the JM4+.\n\nVerdict: I’m going to call this as evens, Furey has the experience of match racing from his days at Dartmouth, but Geffen already has one Boat Race win to his credit and knows what it takes to win.\n\n6\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Finn Meeks\n\nNationality: American\n\nAge: 23\n\nHeight: 191cm\n\nWeight: 87.3kg\n\nThe fourth member of the All-American engine-room of the Cambridge boat, Meeks was a crewmate of Alizadeh’s in the US U23 M8 that won silver in 2015. He was also a crewmate of Anders Weiss whilst at Brown. He sat in the bow seat of the Varsity eight in the 2014-15 season with Weiss in 5 seat that finished 4th at the IRA’s. He then went on to stroke the Brown varsity crew in 2016 and 2017 that made the IRA Grand Finals and last year raced in the Ladies Plate at Henley losing to the GB U23 crew (racing as Molesey & London) in the semi-finals.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Josh Bugajski\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 27\n\nHeight: 194cm\n\nWeight: 100.5kg\n\nThe heaviest man in the Oxford boat, and the 2nd of 3 returning Blues. Bugajski is set to win his 3rd Blue and has one win and one loss to his name. He made his international debut for Great Britain at the U23 World Championships in 2012 finishing 11th in the BM4X. He’s competed at the recent GB Trials this season finishing 3rd in the M1X in the 1st Assessment, 9th in the M2- at the 2nd Trials and 7th at the 3rd Trials (partnering Matt Tarrant). He also rowed with Oxford Brookes at Henley last season winning the Ladies Plate. It wouldn’t surprise me to see Bugajski make his (long overdue) senior debut between now and the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nVerdict: another really close battle with two outstanding oarsmen. But, with 2 Blues to his name the advantage is (just) with the Dark Blues.\n\n7\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Rob Hurn\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 23\n\nHeight: 194cm\n\nWeight: 86.5kg\n\nHurn started his rowing career in Australia and represented that nation at the Junior World Championships in 2012 and 2013. He attended Yale University reading Physics and was a member of the outstanding Varsity crew that won the Harvard-Yale race in 2015 and the Head of the Charles and the Ladies Plate at Henley in 2016. He made his debut for Great Britain in 2016 winning silver in the U23 M8 and another silver in the U23 M4- last year. He’s raced at the first 2 GB Senior Trials this season finishing 3rd in the M2- at the 2nd Assessment with fellow Yale oarsman Sholto Carnegie. He’s another oarsman who could well make his senior international debut during this Olympiad.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Claas Georg Mertens\n\nNationality: German\n\nAge: 26\n\nHeight: 180cm\n\nWeight: 73.9kg\n\nThe smallest and lightest rower in the race (he’s actually 2cm shorter than the Dark Blue’s cox), the German made his international debut in 2012 with a bronze medal in the U23 LM4X. He followed this up by making his senior debut the same year with a 5th place in the LM4X. After finishing 12th in the BLM1X in 2013 he switched to sweep finishing 4th in the BLM4- and then won senior World Championship gold in the last ever LM8 race.\n\nVerdict: yet another close thing. Hurn has age-group World Championship medals and was an integral part of the outstanding Yale Varsity boat. Mertens is a senior World Champion and has the tenacity and fight of an outstanding lightweight. I’m going to say Cambridge just have the edge.\n\nStroke\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Freddie Davidson\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 19\n\nHeight: 189cm\n\nWeight: 82.6kg\n\nThe youngest man in the Cambridge boat and Coach Steve Trapmore has entrusted him with the crucial stroke seat. Davidson is no stranger to the Boat Race having won a Blue in the 2 seat of the 2017 crew. He’s no stranger to the Tideway having learnt to row at St Pauls’ School. He’s one of the most outstanding young oarsmen in the country having made his international debut stroking the GB JM8 in 2015 and then winning a silver in the JM4- in 2016. In 2017 he stepped up to the British U23 team finishing 6th in the BM2-\n\nOxford\n\nName: Vassilis Ragoussis\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 24\n\nHeight: 193cm\n\nWeight: 88.2kg\n\nThe 3rd returning Blue, Ragoussis retains the seat he occupied for last year’s race. The former Abingdon School pupil studied for his undergraduate degree at Boston University in the USA. Whilst at Abingdon he won the Princess Elizabeth at Henley in 2011 and then the Thames Challenge Cup with the Abingdon alumni crew, Griffen, in 2013. Whilst at Boston he raced in the Varsity 8 in several match races including wins against Wisconsin, Dartmouth and Northeastern. At the 3rd GB Trials this season he partnered three-time Olympic champion, Pete Reed, finishing 14th.\n\nVerdict: Ragoussis finished 9 places ahead of Davidson at the recent British trials and I think he will have the edge over his younger rival. The Oxford man also has experience of stroking a winning Blue Boat which could be crucial.\n\nCox\n\nCambridge\n\nName: Hugo Ramambason (President)\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 21\n\nHeight: 175cm\n\nWeight: 55.3kg\n\nThis year’s President, Ramambason steered the Goldie crew in 2015 and 2016 and then stepped up to the Blue Boat in 2017. He’s yet to taste victory over the Championship course, but, along with Chief Coach Steve Trapmore, has constructed an excellent crew with a huge amount of potential, and one that could just deliver that first win.\n\nOxford\n\nName: Zachary Thomas Johnson\n\nNationality: British\n\nAge: 21\n\nHeight: 182cm\n\nWeight: 54.7kg\n\nCaptain of Coxes at Lady Margaret Hall, Thomas Johnson, reading Musicology, beat off Anna Carbery (cox of the Pembroke 1st 8) to secure the Blue Boat seat.\n\nVerdict: A clear advantage to the Light Blues, with Ramambason already having significant Boat Race experience.\n\nSo, that’s the men’s crew. I’ve picked Oxford ahead in 4 seats with Cambridge ahead in 3 and 2 evens. By that reckoning the Dark Blues should have the edge, but, as a unit Cambridge look to be the stronger. Oxford’s defeat to their neighbours, Oxford Brookes, will not have done Coach Sean Bowden any favours. Cambridge take on Brookes this weekend and that will give a “proper” comparative assessment. So, despite picking the Dark Blues just ahead in a seat-by-seat comparison, I’m going to go for a Light Blue victory. But, I think it could be very close, possibly one of the closest for many years.\n\nFollowing the look at the Women’s Boat Race squads it’s now time to look at the men’s squads.\n\nWhilst the 2018 Women’s squads are quite diverse in their relative levels of experience, the men’s squads look much closer. It was first blood to Steve Trapmore’s men at the Head of the River Fours when his Light Blues captured both the Band 1 and Band 2 coxed four’s pennants. The top Cambridge boat finished 13 seconds ahead of their Dark Blue rivals, but more importantly for Trapmore is that his crews also placed 3rd and 4th with the next Oxford boat finishing 6th. All was not doom and gloom for Bowden though, as his top coxless four finished 2nd behind Leander and 26 seconds ahead of their Cambridge opponents. So, who is in the mix for the Blue Boat in March?\n\nThis year’s President is Hugo Ramambason, cox of the 2017 Blue Boat – he and Coach Steve Trapmore have an impressive line-up from which to build a crew, although this is the first crew since 2000 not to contain an athlete with senior international experience.\n\nSome facts and figures:\n\nReturning Blues: 4\n\nAverage age: 22\n\nNationalities: 4 (19 Brits, 6 Americans, 2 Dutch, 1 Italian)\n\nInternationals: 4 (all at U23 level)\n\nDespite not having any senior internationals, this year’s Cambridge squad has a number of very talented U23’s. One of the pick of these is Robert Hurn. Australian born Hurn was an undergraduate at Yale and rowed in their Varsity 8 throughout his four years, including wins in the Harvard v Yale race, the Eastern Sprints and the Ladies Plate at Henley. He raced for Great Britain at the 2016 and 2017 U23 World Championships winning a silver medal both times.\n\nAnother medal winning U23 is Dara Alizadeh from the USA. He rowed for Penn University and spent the 2017 season coaching at Winchester College in the UK (interestingly, one of his top charges, Tobias Schroeder, is a member of the Oxford squad – it’ll be fascinating to see if he lines up against one of his former coaches in March, not sure if that’s ever happened before). In 2015 Alizadeh was selected for the US U23 M8 and won silver behind the Germans.\n\nA crewmate of Alizadeh’s from the 2015 US U23 M8 is Finn Meeks. He studied at Brown University and rowed in their Varsity 8 in 2015, 2016 and 2017 reaching the Grand Final of the IRA Championships each year. He also raced for Brown in the Ladies Plate at Henley this year losing to Molesey/London in the semi-finals.\n\nThe 4th U23 international in the Cambridge squad is Great Britain’s Freddie Davidson, he finished 6th in the U23 M2- at this year’s World Championships. He is aiming to win his 2nd Blue having rowed in the 2 seat of the 2017 crew. He’s also got a World Junior silver medal to his name and was a part of the outstanding St Pauls School crew that reached the final of the Princess Elizabeth at Henley in 2016. At the 2017 November GB trials he Hurn finished 4th, the fastest Goldie pair…but 14 seconds behind the winning pair from Oxford.\n\nAnother returning Blue is James Letten. He is a graduate of Wisconsin University having transferred from Villanova to pursue his rowing. He spent most of his time at Wisconsin in the 2nd Varsity 8 that finished 5th at the IRA’s in 2016. He’s got an impressive record on the erg having won the Crash-B’s in 2016 with a time of 5:49. He’s also the 19-29 year old world record holder for the 10K (31:43.1).\n\nThe 4th returning Blue is Charlie Fisher from Kings College School, Wimbledon– he raced in the winning 2016 crew and is this year’s Vice President.\n\nAs well as four returning Blues, Trapmore has four Goldie oarsmen, three of whom have raced in the reserves for two consecutive years. Patrick Elwood, from Broxbourne Rowing Club, was in both the 2016 and 2017 Goldie boats and is hoping it’ll be third time lucky to win a seat in the Blue Boat. The 2nd Goldie oarsman is Peter Rees who, like Elwood, was in the 2016 and 2017 Goldie boat will be hoping this year to win his Blue. The third returning Goldie oarsman is Piers Kasas who raced in the 2015 and 2016 reserve races. The final Goldie oarsman is Tom Strudwick who was in the 2017 Goldie boat. He was selected to race for Great Britain at the inaugural U23 European Championships this season coming away with a silver medal.\n\nA strong contender for a seat in the Blue Boat is American Spencer Furey. The 23 year old is a graduate of Dartmouth College where he stroked the Varsity 8 which finished in the petitie final at the IRA’s and raced in the Ladies Plate at Henley. He sat in the 2 seat of the top Cambridge 4+ which won the Head of the River Fours (along with Finn Meeks, Rob Hurn and Freddie Davidson).\n\nAnother good contender for the Blue Boat is Dave Bell, the oldest man in either the Oxford or Cambridge Men’s squads. He’s a familiar name on the domestic rowing circuit and a member of Molesey Boat Club. He raced in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley in 2014 and finished 4th in the February 2016 National Trials in the M1X and won the championship M1x at the Metropolitan Regatta and then the Champ 4X at Marlow Regatta. At the 2017 November GB trials he raced in a pair with club-mate Peter Rees finishing 21st (the 4th fastest Goldie pair).\n\nOther newcomer to the squad is 6ft 7in Gerard Kuenning. He’s a Yale graduate and raced in the Bulldogs 2nd Varsity 8 that finished 5th at the Eastern Sprints.\n\nAnother athlete to watch is Riccardo Conti, the Italian was a member of the victorious Eton College crew that won the Princess Elizabeth at Henley in 2014 and competed for his college, Clare in the Temple Challenge Cup in 2016 and then the Thames Challenge Cup with Cantabrigian in 2017.\n\nAs mentioned above, Cambridge had an excellent day at the Head of the River Fours with their top boat of Spencer Furey, Bob Hurn, Finn Meeks and Freddie Davidson were the fastest coxed four with Tim Nugent, Sam Ringer, Jonty Page and Riccardo Conti winning Band 2 coxed fours. The 2nd and 3rd Band 1 coxed fours also did well finishing 3rd and 4th.\n\nIn the Trial 8’s this week Trapmore selected the following crews:\n\n“Goons” “Goblins”\n\nBow: Dave Bell Robbie Harris\n\n2: Peter Rees Piers Kasas\n\n3: Callum Sullivan Thomas Strudwick\n\n4: Reggie Mitchell Gerard Kuenning\n\n5: James Letten Charlie Fisher\n\n6: Dara Alizadeh Patrick Elwood\n\n7: Spencer Furey Rob Hurn\n\nStroke: Freddie Davidson Finn Meeks\n\nCox: Hugh Spaughton Hugo Ramambason\n\nThe race was an absolute classic Trial 8’s contest, with the lead changing hands several times during the race with “Goblins” emerging as winners by just ½ length.\n\nReturning Blues: 3\n\nAverage age: 22\n\nNationalities: 6 (18 Brits, 2 Americans, 2 Germans, 1 South African, 1 Italian)\n\nInternationals: 4\n\nThis year’s President, Iain Mandale, has the most Boat Race experience of either squad, but is still yet to win a Blue. Instead he has 3 winning appearances for Isis in 2013 – 15. He made his international debut in 2014 winning a silver medal in the BLM4- at the U23 World Championships.\n\nMandale has three of the 2017 crew to call on, one of the strongest is Josh Bugajski who was also in the 2016 Blue Boat (and a stint in Isis in 2015). He learnt to row at Cardiff University and made his one and only international appearance in the U23 M4X in 2012. He’s been a regular trialist for Great Britain and at the GB trials last month he set the fastest 2K ergo of 5:45.5 and then took 3rd in the M1X time trial. It’s surely only a matter of time before Bugajski makes the senior GB team.\n\nThe 2nd returning Blue is the stroke of the 2017 Oxford Blue Boat, Vass Ragoussis. The former Abingdon school pupil took his undergraduate degree at Boston University where he rowed in the Varsity 8 that made the Grand Final at the IRA Championships in 2016.\n\nThe final returning Blue is old Etonian Will Geffen. He won his Blue in 2015 and then rowed for Isis in 2016.\n\nAs well as three returning Blues, Mandale has four more oarsmen with experience of racing for Isis. Benedict Aldous is another old Etonian, he has a junior World Championship medal to his name and was a member of the victorious Isis crew this year. He made headlines for the wrong reasons earlier this year when he was pictured at a fancy dress party dressed as a member of the Klu Klux Klan. – queue much outrage in the Daily Mail! The 2nd Isis oarsman in William Cahill. The South African learnt to row at St Andrew’s College, Grahamstown and represented South Africa at the World University Games.\n\nThe next Isis oarsman is Germany’s Claas Georg Mertens. He stroked the 2017 Isis crew. It’s not often a World Champion appears in an Isis crew, but Mertens has a gold medal from the LM8 in 2015 ( and will remain the reigning LM8 World Champion as the event has now been dropped from the programme).\n\nThe 4th Isis oarsman is Tom Commins from the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe. He was stroke of the winning 2016 Isis crew.\n\nThe pick of the newcomers to this year’s squad is US Olympian Anders Weiss. He raced the M2- in Rio finishing 11th. He also raced the M2- at this year’s World Championships again finishing 11th. He’s a graduate of Brown University with whom he won two IRA medals. He’ll be expected to be a major part of the Oxford challenge for the 2018 race.\n\nAnother talented newcomer is Chris Wales. The Harvard graduate raced for the USA at the U23 World Championships in 2014 finishing 11th in the BLM2X. Whilst at Harvard he won a medal in the lightweight 4 at the IRA Championships.\n\nCoach Sean Bowden also has two highly talented freshmen in his squad. Felix Drinkall of Eton and Tobias Schroeder of Winchester raced together as a M2- at the GB Trials last month taking 1st overall (14 seconds ahead of the nearest Goldie pair). Drinkall won gold in the JM4- at the Junior World Championships this year and Schroeder (the youngest athlete in either squad) took bronze in the JM8.\n\nSchroeder is one of three Winchester College pupils in the Oxford squad, all of whom have raced in the Great Britain junior team. Luke Robinson was a crew mate of Schroeder’s in the JM8 in 2017 and Alexander Wythe raced in the JM2- in 2016.\n\nThe final athlete to mention is the sole Australian in the squad, Josh Combs. The 27 year old is a graduate of Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. He’s renowned as an awesome ergo monster and is the reigning World Record holder for the 5K Dynamic Erg for the 19-29 year old age group.\n\nSean Bowden has selected the following crews for the trial 8’s on Wednesday 6th December:\n\n“Stable” “Strong”\n\nBow: Jonathan Olandi Luke Robinson\n\n2: Charles Buchanan Angus Forbes\n\n3: Will Cahill Nicholas Elkington\n\n4: Alexander Wythe Benedict Aldous\n\n5: William Geffen Tobias Shcroeder\n\n6: Anders Weiss Josh Bugajski\n\n7: Iain Mandale Claas Mertens\n\nStroke: Vass Ragoussis Felix Drinkall\n\nCox: Zachary Thomas Johnson Anna Carbery\n\nSo those are the squads. Neither look to be significantly ahead of the other. Cambridge gained the early season bragging rights at the Head of the River Fours, but Oxford produced some excellent results at the GB Trials. Oxford have the greater international experience with the likes of Weiss and Bugajksi, but Cambridge have some outstanding U23 international oarsmen in their squad. It really is too close to call as to who will take the win in March and it’s going to be really interesting to see how the crews develop in the next few months.\n\nI’ve finally found time to put “pen to paper” with some thoughts about the relative strengths of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race squads. They’ve made their first public appearances at the Head of the River Fours and, for the Brits at any rate, the GB Trials. First off it’s the women’s squads.\n\nCambridge won their first race since the event returned to the Tideway this year following two heavy defeats in 2015 and 2016. To be fair to those Cambridge crews their opponents from Oxford in 2015 were truly outstanding and in 2016 Cambridge struggled in the rough water and all but sank. But, in 2017 it was the Light Blues who had the stronger squad and they delivered a crushing 11 length victory and set a new course record. So, what does this year’s squad look like?\n\nA few facts and figures…\n\nReturning Blues: 3\n\nAverage age: 22.8\n\nNationalities: 4 (19 Brits, 7 Americans, 1 Irish, 1 German)\n\nInternationals: 5\n\nCoach Rob Baker and President Daphne Martschenko have an exciting group of athletes to work with. Martschenko is one of the two returning Blues and will be racing in her 3rd Boat Race. She suffered the ignominy of the crushing defeats of 2015 and 2016 but didn’t race in 2017. She’ll be looking to end her Cambridge career with a win. The 25 year old PhD student was a member of the US U23 W4X in 2012 and 2014 with a best result of 6th in 2012.\n\nThe standout name in this year’s Cambridge team is Olivia Coffey from the USA. She’s the only athlete in any of the University squads (men’s and women’s) to have won a senior World Championships gold medal having won the W4- title in 2013 and the W4X gold in 2015. The Harvard graduate has an outstanding record at world Championship level having made the podium each time she raced at either the U23 or Senior World Championships. She will surely be the first name on the team sheet.\n\nImogen Grant of Great Britain has a half-Blue from the Lightweight Boat Race and a full Blue from the Heavyweight Boat Races (losing as a lightweight in 2016 and then winning as a heavyweight in 2017). She made her international debut in 2017 as part of the GB U23 LW4X finishing 5th.\n\nAnother returning Blue is Alice White. She won a Junior World Championships bronze medal for New Zealand in 2011 before moving to the UK. She made her debut for the Great Britain team at the 2015 U23 World Championships taking a bronze medal.\n\nOne of the newcomers to the squad has one of the most famous names in Collegiate rowing – Abigail (known as Abba) Parker – daughter of the late, great Harry Parker the legendary Head Coach at Harvard. Abba attended Harvard and was a key member of the Radcliffe Varsity 8 winning gold at the Eastern Sprints.\n\nAnother athlete with a well-known rowing name is Eve Caroe – niece of RowPerfect’s Rebecca Caroe. Eve is no stranger to rowing in Cambridge having learnt her rowing at the town club Cantabrigian.\n\nThe 5th member of the squad with international experience is Olivia Jamrog from the USA. The Michigan graduate raced for the USA at the U23 World Championships in 2015 finishing 8th in the BLW4X.\n\nAnother Harvard graduate is Kelsey Barolak, she was a crew mate of Parker’s and was in the boat that won the Eastern sprints in 2015 and 2016 and was a trialist for the US U23 team.\n\nThe sole German in the squad is Paula Wesselmann. As a junior she won a number of medals at the German Championships and after school studied at Clemson University in the USA, racing in the Varsity 8 throughout her 4 year stay.\n\nThere are two returners from the 2017 Blondie crew, Lucy Pike and Rachel Elwood. They raced together as a W2- at the 2016 GB Trials winning the 1st Assessment.\n\nAt the Head of the River Fours Cambridge entered 6 crews, with the top W4+ of Martschenko, White, Coffey and Barolak taking the win 23 seconds ahead of their nearest Dark Blue rivals.\n\nReturning Blues: 3\n\nAverage age: 24.5\n\nNationalities: 6 (13 Brits, 5 Americans, 1 Australian, 1 New Zealander, 1 Finn, 1 Netherlander)\n\nInternationals: 2\n\nLike his Light Blue counterpart, Oxford’s Coach Andy Nelder has 3 returning Blues – Jennifer Herbert, Alice Roberts and cox Eleanor Shearer. This year’s President, Katherine Erickson is a Stanford graduate but didn’t learn to row until she came to Oxford to read for a DPhil in History. In 2017’s race she competed for the Oxford reserves, Osiris going down to their Light Blue rivals by 13 lengths.\n\nJennifer Herbert was a member of the Penn University Varsity crew and raced for the United States at the U23 World Championships in 2013. In the 2017 Boat Race she stroked the Oxford Blue Boat to a disappointing 11 length defeat.\n\nThe 2nd returning Blue is Alice Roberts. She was the youngest member of the Blue Boat in the 2017 race and is, once again, the youngest member of the squad for the 2018 race. She’s an Oxford local having attended Cheney School in the city and took up rowing when the school introduced the sport in 2012 under the guidance of former world champion Peter Haining.\n\nThe 3rd returning Blue is the cox of the 2017 race Eleanor Shearer, the former Westminster School pupil will be wanting to erase the memories of the 11 length defeat she and her crew suffered in the 2017 race.\n\nThere is another rowing half-Blue in the squad, Rachel Anderson. She was a member of the losing Oxford Lightweight Boat in 2017\n\nThe pick of the newbies at Oxford is American Morgan McGovern. The 30 year old Georgetown graduate raced for the USA at the 2016 World Championships finishing 5th in the LW4X. At the 2015 USA Championships she came away with gold medals in the LW1X, LW2X and LW4X.\n\nAnother strong contender for a seat in the Blue Boat is American Maddy Goss. The Texas University graduate stroked the 2nd Varsity 4+ to victory at the 2017 Big 12 Championships.\n\nSara Kushma from New York is a Princeton graduate and whilst a Tiger she rowed in the 2nd Varsity 8 and also won gold in the Varsity 4+ at the EAWRC Championships.\n\nThere is one member of last year’s reserves, Osiris, trying for a seat in the Blue Boat, Beth Bridgeman. She performed well to be selected for Osiris in 2017 having only started rowing when she went up to St Hughes College. She’ll be hoping to use that experience to go one better in 2018 and gain a full Blue.\n\nA newcomer with significant Tideway experience is Olivia Ambler. She learnt to row at Godolphin & Latymer School and then joined The Tideway Scullers School. As a member of the TSS she rowed for England at the Home International Regatta in 2016. She also raced for The Tideway Scullers at Henley Women’s Regatta last year winning the Intermediate Eights.\n\nThe oldest member of the squad is Sarah Payne Riches from New Zealand, she’s no stranger to the Tideway having completed a Masters degree at Imperial College. If she makes the Blue Boat she will become the oldest Blue in the history of the Boat Race.\n\nSo, on paper Cambridge look to have a much stronger squad with a double senior World Champion and four U23 Internationals against Oxford’s 1 lightweight international and 1 U23 international. Oxford also have a significant number of athletes in the squad who hadn’t rowed before going up. At the Head of the River Fours Oxford only entered 2 boats but they were both outgunned by Cambridge finishing over 1 minute behind the leading Light Blue Boat. Based on the strength in depth and experience of the Cambridge squad I have to pick them as the favourites – but there’s still a long way to go before the race starts at 4:31pm on Saturday 24th March.\n\nNow for the final part of the preview…the para-rowing events.\n\nThe classifications have changed since Rio so perhaps need a little explaining.\n\n“PR3 (Formerly LTA)\n\nPhysical Impairment, Visual Impairment and Intellectual Disability (ID). This sport class is for rowers who have the use of their legs, trunk and arms, who can utilize the sliding seat. Note that ID is not an eligible impairment for FISA events.\n\nExamples of PR3 impairments include (but are not limited to):\n\nLimb loss, at least full loss of three fingers on one hand, or at least a tarsal metatarsal amputation of the foot\n\nLoss of muscle strength e.g. equivalent to incomplete spinal cord injury at S1\n\nMinimal ataxia, athetosis, hypertonia. E.g. Cerebral Palsy, brain injury, stroke or MS, usually affecting only one limb\n\nPR2 (Formerly TA)\n\nPhysical Impairment. This sport class is for rowers who have trunk and arm movement, who are unable to use their legs to propel the sliding seat.\n\nExamples of PR2 impairments include (but are not limited to):\n\nLimb loss equivalent to a double around the knee amputation\n\nSignificant muscle strength loss in both legs equivalent to complete spinal cord injury at L3 level or incomplete lesion at L1\n\nAtaxia, athetosis or hypertonia from CP, brain injury or stroke which affects both legs or one side of the body\n\nSignificant permanently decreased range of motion in one or both knees\n\nPR1 (Formerly AS)\n\nPhysical Impairment. This sport class is for athletes who row predominately with their arms and shoulders. Athletes use strapping around their mid section to provide support and stability in the boat.\n\nExamples of PR1 impairments include (but are not limited to):\n\nAtaxia, athetosis or hypertonia from CP, brain injury or stroke who use a wheelchair, with both legs and the trunk involved\n\nLoss of muscle strength equivalent to complete spinal cord injury at T12 level”\n\nIt’s also worth commenting that this year all the Para-Rowing classes are racing over the full 2000m. It’s a massive feat of strength and endurance, especially for the PR1 events, for the athletes racing the full 2K with just their upper bodies.\n\nRight..so now that’s understood onto the events.\n\nPR1 W1X\n\n9 scullers\n\nChina, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, USA\n\nChina’s Lili Wang won silver at the Rio Paralympic Games. She’s not raced so far this season but comes into Sarasota as the athlete with one of the strongest pedigrees.\n\nThe favourite for the event may well be Israel’s Moran Samuel. She was 5th at the London Olympics and was World Champion in 2015 and bronze medallist at the Rio Games. She didn’t race at the Poznan World Cup (the only World Cup which fielded para-rowing events) but did race at the Gavirate Adaptive Rowing Regatta where she won gold.\n\nRunner-up to Moran in Gavirate was Norway’s Birgit Skarstein. She was World Champion in 2015 and just missed out on the medals in Rio. She dominated a small 3 boat field in Poznan winning by 45 seconds.\n\n48 year old Sylvia Pille-Steppart from Germany won bronze in Gavirate and followed this up with silver at the Poznan World Cup was runner-her first international medal.\n\nItaly’s Anita Hoxha finished in the bronze medal position in the three boat final at the Poznan Regatta and was 5th in Gavirate.\n\nAlso keep an eye out for the USA’s Hallie Smith from Washington D.C. She’s making her international debut after securing her spot on the team with victory at the US Trials. The US always produce strong para-rowing athletes and Smith could well be the dark horse of the event.\n\nMy picks…China in gold with Norway in silver and Israel just holding off the US for the bronze.\n\nPR1 M1X\n\n17 scullers\n\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, USA\n\nThis looks set to be a showdown between two fierce rivals, Erik Horrie of Australia and Roman Polianskyi of Ukraine.\n\nHorrie is one of the most experienced athletes in the field. The 37 year old won silver at the London Paralympics and then became World Champion in 2013, a title he successfully defended in both 2014 and 2015. In Rio he won his 2nd Paralympic silver medal. The man who beat him in Rio was Polianskyi. Horrie has yet to race internationally over the new 2K distance whereas the Ukrainian competed both at Gavirate and in Poznan, winning gold on both occasions. The first meeting of these two athletes for the 2017 season should be really interesting to watch.\n\nBehind these two the next favourite for a medal is Great Britain’s Andrew Houghton. Filling the mighty shoes of the legendary Tom Aggar, Houghton has made an impressive start to his 2017 campaign with a silver medal in Gavirate.\n\nAnother athlete chasing a medal is the USA’s Blake Hoxton. He finished just outside of the medals at the 2014 and 2015 World Championships and took 4th at the Rio Paralympics. A graduate of the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University he will be looking to go at least one better than his result in Rio.\n\nAlso keep an eye out for Brazil’s Rene Pereira, 7th in the world in 2015 and an A-Fnalist in Rio and was 6th at the Poznan World Cup.\n\nThe final athlete to mention is Russia’s Alexey Chuvashev. A bronze medallist at the Lodon Paralympics he won World bronze medals in 2013 and 2014. The suspension of the entire Russian team from the Rio Paralympics probably robbed him of another medal. So far in 2017 he’s raced at the Poznan World Cup finishing 9 seconds behind Polianskyi in the silver medal position.\n\nMy picks…Horrie for the gold just ahead of the Ukrainian with Houghton of GB in bronze.\n\nPR2 Mix2X\n\n5 crews\n\nChina, Netherlands, Poland, Ukraine, USA\n\nChina, Shuang Liu and Tianming Fei are the silver medallists from the Rio Paralympics. Fei also raced in London (with Xiaoxian Lou) winning the gold. These are the only 2 races Fei has done and he’s won medals in both. The Chinese pair will surely start as favourites in Sarasota.\n\nThe Dutch, Annika Van Der Meer and Corne De Koning, are acing both the PR2 and PR3 events. The PR2 in Gavirate and also took the gold at the Poznan World Cup. De Koning raced in the TAMix2X category in Rio (with Ester Van Der Loos) finishing 4th just 2 seconds off a medal.\n\nUkraine have a crew which contains the oldest competitor at the championships, 57 year old Iryna Kyrchenko. She, and partner Iaroslav Koiuda, finished 5th in Rio and so far this season have a bronze medal from the Poznan World Cup.\n\nAs well as the oldest competitor at the championships, this event also sees the youngest – 17 year old Isaac French of the USA. He’s partnered by 37 year old Laura Goodkind. She raced at the Rio Games with Roman Helman, finishing 10th overall.\n\nPoland have the long-established pairing of Michal Gadowski and Jolanta Majka. This double were 10th in London and reached the A-final in Rio. So far this season they have a bronze medal from Gavirate and 4th in Poznan.\n\nMy picks..China in gold ahead of the Netherlands and Ukraine.\n\nPR3 Mix 2X\n\n9 crews\n\nAustria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, USA\n\nOnly 3 crews competed in the PR3 event at the Poznan World Cup, with Germany emerging as the winners, however Germany have selected a different pairing to compete in Florida with Valentin Luz and Jessica Dietz. They raced at Gavirate finishing 3rd of 3 1.5 minutes behind the winners.\n\nThe gold in Gavirate went to the French, Antoine Jesel and Guylaine Marchand. Marchand was world champion in the LTAMix2X event in 2016 with Fabien Saint-Lannes. She and Jesel were members of the French LTAMix 4+ that finished 8th in Rio. They continued in that boat class for the Poznan World Cup taking the silver medal. They won in Gavirate in a small field by over 5o seconds ahead of Israel.\n\nAustria will be strong contenders for a medal with Johanna Beyer and Rainer Putz. This duo won silver at the 2016 World Championships and so far this season have a silver medal from the Poznan World Cup.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Netherlands are racing in both the PR2 and PR3 categories it’ll be interesting to see how they get on against athletes with less impairment.\n\nChina will be strong contenders for the medals, their crew of Qian Wang and Yunlong Wu raced as part of the LTAMix 4+ at both the London and Rio Paralympics – finishing 4th and 6th respectively. It remains to be seen how quick they are in the double, but they certainly have a wealth of experience under their belts.\n\nMy picks…France for the win, with Austria in 2nd and the Chinese in bronze.\n\nThe final event is the PR3 Mix 4+\n\n5 crews\n\nGreat Britain, Israel, Italy, Ukraine, USA\n\nGreat Britain will start as clear favourites in this event. They’ve not been beaten at a World Championships or Paralympics since 2010. There are two changes to the crew that won in Rio with James Fox and Grace Clough being joined by newcomers Oliver Stanhope from Molesey Boat Club and Lithuanian-born Giedre Rakauskaite of Worcester Rowing Club. New into the coxes seat is Anna Corderoy (also of Molesey Boat Club). They didn’t race at the world Cup but did compete at Gavirate (with Emma Todd racing in place of Rakauskaite) and recorded a 14 second win over Ukraine. It’ll be a major upset if the British don’t come away with another World title.\n\nLooking to spoil the British party are the Americans. They were runners-up to the British in Rio and have made just one change to that crew, with Michael Varro joining Jaclyn Smith, Zachary Burns, Danielle Hansen and cox Jennifer Sichel. The Americans will be getting fed up with playing 2nd fiddle to the British having done so in 2014, 2015 and 2016. They will be hoping that finally this year they can get to hear the Stars and stripes rather than God Save The Queen!\n\nThe last crew to beat the British at a Paralympics were the Italians in 2008 and for 2017 they have two of that crew on-board – Paola Protopapa and 55 year old Luca Agoletto (making his first return to international competition since 2011). They are joined by 2 fellow crew members from the boat that raced at the 2013,14 & 15 World Championships; Lucilla Aglioti and Tommaso Schettino. They had a best finish of 2nd in 2013. Only Schettino raced in Rio where the crew finished a disappointing 10th. Now, with much more experience in the boat they pose a serious threat to the British and Americans.\n\nUkraine are always strong in Para-rowing and their PR3 Mix4+ stand a very good chance of getting among the medals, the crew of Olexandra Yankova, Iryna Yarynka, Olexandr Bilonozhko, Maksym Zhuk and Volodymyr Kozlov finished 6th in 2015 and 9th in Rio. They’ve made a good start to the 2017 campaign with silver at the Gavirate Regatta and then gold in the 3 boat final in Poznan.\n\nThe final crew racing are the Israelis with Simona Goren, Achiya Klein, Barak Hazor, Shay-lee Mizrachi and Leah Marissa Sass. They raced in Poznan finishing 3rd in a tight three boat final.\n\nMy picks…hard to see anyone beating the British, but the battle for the silver and bronze will be quite a contest between the Americans and Italians, with the Americans coming out on top.\n\nSo that’s it. All events previewed. Hopefully the weather gods will be kind and we’ll have a fabulous week of racing.\n\nLW1X\n\n16 scullers\n\nCuba, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden, Tunisia, USA.\n\nThis has all the makings of a fascinating contest with no clear favourite and as many as 7 scullers in with a good chance of a medal. In the 4 European-based regattas so far this season there have been 4 different winners\n\nPatricia Merz of Switzerland was the first to grab gold this season when she won at the 1st World Cup in Belgrade, the first medal of any colour in her senior career. Last season she placed 7th in the world but like many of the Swiss sculling squad, she’s made a significant step change in performance under new head coach Robin Dowell. Last season she placed 7th in the world, but this season, along with her gold from Belgrade, she has bronze medals from the Europeans and 2nd and 3rd World Cups.\n\nLast year’s world Silver medallist, Emma Fredh of Sweden, claimed the title of European Champion in Racice and with it her first ever gold medal. The Swede followed this up with strong performances in Poznan and Lucerne making the A-Final on both occasions. In Poznan she just missed out on a medal in a blanket finish which saw just 0.5sec separate 2nd and 4th.\n\nSouth Africa’s Kirsten McCann took the honours in Lucerne, her first World Cup of the season, with a relatively comfortable 3 second victory. McCann has spent the last 3 seasons racing in the LW2x with Ursula Grobler with a best performance of 3rd in 205 and then ending up 5th at the Rio Olympics. Now in the LW1X she will probably start as marginal favourite.\n\nOne of her main challengers will be Poland’s Martyna Mikolajczak. She raced at the Rio Olympics in the LW2X with Weronika Deresz winning the B-Final. This partnership continued into 2017 with wins in Belgrade and the European Championships and silver medals in Poznan and Lucerne. But, for Sarasota her seat in the LW2X has been taken by Joanna Dorociak. Mikolajczak will be looking to end the season on a high with a World Championship gold and look to return to the Olympic class boat for 2018.\n\nDenise Walsh from Skibbereen in Ireland is another who will be a serious contender for a medal. After a disappointing 2016 which saw her finish 19th at the final World Cup she’s made a great start to the 2017 season taking silver in Belgrade and again at the European Championships.\n\nAnother exciting young sculler to watch is Marieke Keijser of the Netherlands. She’s already got a superb winning record under her belt with a Junior world title in 2015 and back to back U23 titles in 2016 and 2017. She made her senior debut in 2016 and came away with World Cup gold and silver medals. So far in 2017 as well as the U23 world title she has silver medals from both the European Championships and the Lucerne World Cup. She is undoubtedly a prodigious talent and could well end the season as U23 and senior World Champion.\n\nRunner-up to Keijser at the U23’s was Italian Clara Guerra. Still only 18 she’s another very talented young sculler and one to watch for the future. Junior World Champion in 2016 she made the A-Final of the European Championships. An A-Final finish would be an outstanding result for his young sculler.\n\nMary Jones of Cambridge Boat Club in Boston USA finished just outside of the medal at last year’s World Championships in Rotterdam. So far this season she’s made the A-Final at both the 2nd and 3rd World Cups missing the bronze medal in Lucerne by just 4/100ths of a second. An A-Final finish would be the minimum expected.\n\nThe final two scullers to mention are Germany’s Leonie Pieper and Mexico’s Kenia Lechuga Alanis. Pieper was a World Champion in the LW4X in 2014 and 2015 and she reached the A-Final in the LW1x at the European Championships. A similar result in Sarasota would be a great result. Lechuga Alanis won bronze at the U23 world Championships last year and has a best result of 9th so far this season.\n\nMy picks…it’s going to be really tight between McCann, Mikolajczak and Keijser. I think the Pole will just snatch it from the South African with the young Dutch woman in bronze.\n\nLM1X\n\n30 scullers\n\nBrazil, Canada, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Slovenia, Serbia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, USA, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, St Vincent.\n\nA big field and great to see some of the smaller rowing nations like Uganda, St Vincent and Uzbekistan represented.\n\nThe dynamic of this event changed significantly when the Irish O’Donovan brothers withdrew from the LM2X due to illness to Gary. This left younger brother Paul potentially high and dry. But he’s been entered into the LM1x, the event in which he is the reigning world champion. One of the most charismatic figure in World Rowing he and brother Gary had progressed steadily throughout the season following up a lacklustre performance in Belgrade with a silver medal at the Europeans and further medals in Poznan and Lucerne. Everything was set for a mouth-watering showdown with the French LM2X….but it wasn’t to be. But, O’Donovan Jr will be the one to beat in the single in Florida.\n\nLeading the chase of the Irishman will be Poland’s Artur Mikolajczewski. He also raced in the LM2X at the Rio Olympics making the A-Final. He’s spent all season in the LM1X and has been getting better and better all season. 4th in Belgrade and 5th at the European Championships he then stepped up in Poznan and Lucerne taking the gold medal both times. He’s definitely the form athlete of the season and will be a stern test for the defending champion.\n\nPeter Galambos of Hungary had also had a great season so far. The 2016 silver medallist has won medals at every regatta so far this season with a gold in Belgrade followed by silvers at the Europeans and Poznan and ending with bronze in Lucerne. He will definitely be in the mix for the medals.\n\nGalambos and Slovakia’s Lukas Babac have been rivals for the last few years. They’ve been finishing within 1 place or so of each other since 2010. The Slovakian hasn’t had as good a season so far as the Hungarian with a best performance of 3rd at the Poznan World Cup.\n\nAnother serious challenger for a medal is Switzerland’s Michael Schmid. He raced at the Rio Olympics with Daniel Wiederkehr that finished 13th. For 2017 he’s moved to the LM1X and has had a great season becoming European Champion in Belgrade. He also has 2 silver medals from the 1st and 3rd World Cups. Part of an incredibly strong Swiss sculling squad anything less than a medal will be a disappointment.\n\nAnother seasoned campaigner in the LM1X is Slovenia’s Rajko Hrvat. He’s been racing in the LM1X since 2010 and was a World silver medallist in 2015. He just missed out on a medal in 2016 and has a best performance so far this season of 4th in Poznan. He’ll be looking for an A-Final finish in Sarasota.\n\nKristoffer Brun from Norway is a firmer LM2X World Champion and won bronze at the Rio Olympics behind the French and Irish. He’s moved to the LM1X for 2017 and has A-Final appearances at the Europeans and in Poznan and Lucerne. He’ll be expecting to make it a 3rd A-Final at the very least at the World Championships.\n\nGreece’s Georgias Konsolas is making his season’s debut in Florida. He was a part of the LM4X that won the World Championships in 2013 and 2014. It remains to be seen what sort of speed he has in the single and could be the dark horse of the event.\n\nOther scullers to mention include the gold and silver medallists from the U23 World Championships Uncas Batista of Brazil and Alexis Lopez Garcia of Mexico.\n\nMy picks…O’Donovan in gold with Mikolajczewski in silver and Schmid in bronze.\n\nW1X\n\n21 scullers\n\nAustria, Bahamas, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Switzerland, Trinidad & Tobago, Ukraine, USA\n\nAnother sculling event where Switzerland will be one of the favourites to take gold. Jeannine Gmelin has stepped up to be the season’s leading sculler. After 5th places in 2014, 2015 and the Rio Olympics she won Switzerland’s first ever W1X gold medal at the Poznan World Cup this season and followed that up with her 2nd in Lucerne. She’s definitely heading into the World Championship as the form sculler and will be the one everyone is watching.\n\nOne of the main challengers to Gmelin will be Austria’s Magdalena Lobnig. She’s been one of the most consistent scullers over the past few years only failing to make the A-final twice since 2013. She made a step up in 2016 by winning the European Championships and ending the season with a 6th place at the Rio Olympics. This season she has raced at all three World Cups and has won medals at all three (including gold in Poznan). One thing you can always expect from Lobnig is that she will be in the mix for the medals.\n\nAnother highly experienced sculler is China’s Jingli Duan. She’s made a habit of finishing 3rd taking the bronze in 2014, 2015 and the Rio Olympics. She’s raced once so far this season at the Poznan World Cup and finished……3rd! Another sculler who will be in the mix for the medals.\n\nThe winner of the European Championships this year was Great Britain’s Vicky Thornley. That gold was the first senior W1X Championship gold medal by a British woman. The Rio W2X silver medallist was, perhaps, in the shadow of the great dame Katherine Grainger last season but her strength and technical ability cannot be underestimated. This season she has emerged from that shadow and established herself as a world class single sculler. She followed up her European gold with a silver medal in Poznan and 5th in Lucerne. She had a very odd race at Henley where problems with her boat meant she struggled and was off the pace against Annekatrin Thiele. But, she will relish the warm weather in Sarasota and if conditions are calm she will be one of the favourites for a medal.\n\nThe winner in Henley, Thiele of Germany, is one of the most experienced and decorated athletes in the field having made her senior debut back in 2005. She’s got two Olympic medals to her credit, including gold from Rio, and two World Championship golds. But, crucially all of those medals came in the W4X. Her best performance so far to date in the W1X has been a 3rd place at this year’s Europeans. She followed that up with the win at Henley and A-final finishes at the 2nd and 3rd World Cups. She is unlikely to challenge for the medals, given the strength of the field, but will expect to feature in the A-Final.\n\nAnother sculler with hopes of making the A-final at the very least is the USA’s Felice Mueller. World champion in the W4- back in 2013 she has World Championship medals in both sculling and sweep events in 2014 and 2015. She raced in the W2- at the Rio Olympics and just missed out on the medals. This season is her first competing internationally in the W1X and she made a strong start in Lucerne taking 4th. But, given the highly competitive field, and the level of single scull experience of the field she may struggle to be in the mix for the medals, but an A-final finish is a strong possibility.\n\nCarling Zeeman of Canada is a former U23 silver medallist in the single scull. After a couple of years racing in the W4X she switched to the W1X in 2015 ending the season in 6th In 2016 she followed that up with a 10th place in Rio. She made a strong start to her 2017 season taking silver in Lucerne 2 seconds behind Gmelin.\n\nThe final scullers to mention are Lisa Scheenaard of the Netherlands who moves out of a highly successful W4X to race the W1X in Sarasota, and Denmark’s Fie Udby Erichsen – silver medallist in London and 9th in Rio.\n\nMy picks….this may surprise a few people but I’m picking Gmelin for gold with Duan of China in silver and Vicky Thornley in bronze.\n\nM1X\n\n39 scullers\n\nArgentina, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Benin, Belarus, Brazil, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Great Britain, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, Puerto Rico, South Africa, Russia, Samoa, Serbia, Switzerland, Sweden, Tunisia, Ukraine, USA, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.\n\nOndrej Synek of the Czech Republic and Mahe Drysdale of New Zealand have been duelling in the M1X at the World Championships since 2005, and one or other of them has always made the top step of the podium since. Synek has the edge in World Championships having won for the last three years, whereas Drysdale has the edge in Olympic titles. But, with Drysdale retiring (or possibly just taking a break) Synek might have thought that 2017 would be an “easy” year for him to dominate. But, he reckoned without the conveyor belt of talent that is the New Zealand system. Filling Drysdale’s shoes in the MX is Robbie Manson. He’s had a good, if not spectacular career up to 2017, 7th in the M4X at the London Olympics and winning a bronze medal in the M2X in 2015 and then a disappointing 11th in Rio. But his move to the 1X has been inspired. In his first race at the Poznan World Cup he not only won gold by a massive 8 seconds but set a new World’s Best Time of 6:30.74 into the bargain. Suddenly the rest of the men’s sculling world realised the Oar-Blacks weren’t going to give up their dominance of the M1X easily. Manson followed up his spectacular victory in Poznan with another gold in Lucerne.\n\n2nd to Manson at both the Poznan and Lucerne World Cups was Cuba’s Angel Fournier Rodriguez. Cuba’s most successful rower ever, for years he’s been in the shadow of Synek and Drysdale, picking up bronze medals and the occasional silver (when either Synek or Drysdale weren’t racing). The highlight of his career to date was 2013 in Chungju when he won silver (despite stopping before the line). With 2 silver medals to his credit so far this season he’s one of the strongest challengers for a medal in Sarasota.\n\nCroatia’s Damir Martin was involved in one of the greatest M1X races ever at the Rio Olympics against Mahe Drysdale. He led over the first half of the course before Drysdale overhauled him just before the 1500m marker and went on to open up a ¾ length lead with 250m to go. 99 times out of 100 if a sculler as that much of a lead with only 1 minute to go then they will go on to win. But Martin clearly hadn’t read the script and mounted an astonishing sprint to reel the Kiwi back in. On the line it was a photo-finish which went the way of Drysdale by no more than 1-2cm (both men were credited with identical times). Returning to competition in 2017 Martin admitted he wasn’t back to full fitness, but despite this he picked up silver medals at the 1st World Cup and European Championships. Illness during the Lucerne World Cup meant his performance was below par and he withdrew before the B-Final. It remains to be seen what sort of form he brings to Florida. If he’s anywhere near his best we could see another outstanding race between him, Manson, Synek and Fournier Rodriguez.\n\nBelarus’s Stanislau Shcharbachenia is a sculler who is always “there or thereabouts”. 5th at the Rio Olympics, he’s finished 7th at the last two World Championships and has a best performance so far this season of a bronze medal at Lucerne. At his best he can challenge anyone and will be looking to add his name to the medal contenders.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Swiss sculling team is quietly establishing itself as a world power. Nico Stahlberg has emerged as a real contender this season. A member of the excellent M4X that finished 7th in Rio he’s switched to the M1X for 2017. He opened his account with a superb gold at the Belgrade World Cup. This was Switzerland’s 1st M1X medal since Xeno Mueller won silver at the 2001 World Cup in Princeton. He followed this up with 1 2nd medal (a bronze) in Poznan and then just missed out on another bronze in Lucerne by 7/100th of a second. The Swiss are clearly doing something right and Stahlberg will expect to be up at the sharp end of the A-Final pushing for a medal (if he manages it it’ll be Switzerland’s 1st since 1999).\n\nA sub-plot in the M1X story in Sarasota is the battle of the “young guns”. 3 of the top 5 U23 M1X from the 2016 World Championships are racing in Florida. Germany’s Tim Ole Nask took the top honours that day and so far this season he has A-Final finishes at both the European Championships and Poznan World Cups. Illness forced his withdrawal from Lucerne at the quarter-final stage. He’ll be looking to be the best of the “young ‘uns” in Florida and secure a solid A-Final placing. Poland’s Natan Wegrzycki-Szymczyk is the most experienced of the trio, 7th at the Rio Olympics he won silver behind Ole Nask at the 2016 U23’s and then bronze this year. He spends most of his rowing season in the University of California M8, but will be a major contender come Tokyo.\n\nThe third of the U23’s is Great Britain’s Tom Barras. The Welshman was 5th last year and started this season subbing into the M4X winning bronze in Belgrade and 4th in Racice. He moved back to the M1X for Poznan finishing an excellent 5th. Lucerne was a bit disappointing when he ended up 13th. But, at his best he’s more than capable of reaching the A-Final and is another “one to watch” as the Olympiad progresses.\n\nOther scullers to watch are Mexico’s Juan Carlos Cabrera – 8th in Rio, The Netherland’s Stefan Broenink – 4th in Belgrade and Serbia’s Marko Marjanovic who took a surprise bronze in Belgrade.\n\nMy picks….should be another classic but it’s hard to see anyone getting the best of Robbie Manson. Synek to take the silver with Damir Martin in bronze.\n\ntime now to look at the pairs events.\n\nLM2-\n\n8 crews\n\nBrazil, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Russia, USA\n\nThe Irish have been pretty much untouchable so far this season, Mark O’Donovan and Shane O’Driscoll from Skibbereen are unbeaten so far winning all three world Cups and the European Championships. They will be odds on favourites to make it a clean sweep for the season. 2017 has certainly seen a step up in performance from this Irish pairing, the gold in Belgrade was the first medal either man had won in their senior international careers and to follow that up with three more shows they are now the class crew of the field.\n\nIf the Irish have made a step up in performance then it can be argued that the British have taken a step backward. Sam Scrimgeour and Joel Cassells were world Champions in 2015 and European Champions in 2016. However they “only” managed a bronze medal at the 2016 world Championships and so far this season have a bronze from Belgrade and a silver in Poznan. Despite a strong first 1000m in Lucerne (where they led by over 1 second) they faded in the 2nd half and were rowed out of the medal altogether. But, they are a class outfit, and if they can get their pacing right they could well challenge for a medal and possibly even overturn the Irish.\n\nThe strongest challenge to the Irish however is likely to come from the Russians, Nikita Bolozin and Aleksei Kiiashko. After a fairly unspectacular 2016, where Kiiashko finished 10th in the LM2- and Bolozin 16th in the U23 BLM2X, they’ve stepped up a gear in 2017 and have created a fast pair. They’ve been runners-up to the Irish at Belgrade, the Europeans and in Lucerne and will be pushing to close the 1.5-2 second gap the Irish have been able to maintain over them so far this season.\n\nBrazil are another combination who have made a step change in performance so far this season. Xavier Vela Maggi (who switched nationality from Spain to Brazil in 2016) and Willian Giaretton raced in the LM2X at their home Olympics placing 14th. They then returned to the LM2- to race at the World Championships finishing 9th. But, so far this season they’ve shown good medal-contending speed taking bronze at both the 2nd and 3rd World Cups (albeit in what was only a 3 boat final in Poznan).\n\nThe Italians are always strong in lightweight rowing and this year they have an exciting young combination of Guieseppe Di Mare and Alfonso Scalzone. 20 year old Di Mare and 21 year old Scalzone raced together for the first time at the European Championships where they picked up a bronze medal and ended the season as U23 World Champions.\n\nThe USA have selected Jack Devlin from Potomac Boat Club and Alex Twist from Seattle. Both were members of the LM8 that won bronze in 2015. For Devlin it’s a case of “joining the family business” after with both parents having rowed or trialled for the US.\n\nThe final two crews to mention are the Hungarians, Roland Szigeti and David Forrai, who have a best performance so far this season of 4th in Belgrade, and a crew from Mexico (Edmundo Reynoso and Angy Canul) who both make their international debuts in Sarasota.\n\nMy picks….logic dictates that the Irish will finish the season unbeaten but I reckon the Brits will finally get it right and take the silver with the battle for bronze being won by the Russians.\n\nM2+\n\n8 crews\n\nAustralia, Spain, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania\n\nAs with the LM4- this could well be the last year that the M2+ is part of the World Championship programme. But what that does mean is that whoever wins in Sarasota will remain the reigning World Champions. Given its dwindling status the event is often used as a means of giving the reserves a chance to race.\n\nThe favourites for this year are the Italians. But, if they do win it won’t be a particularly popular victory. Vincenzo Abbagnale has been named in the crew and has just completed a 16 month suspension for doping violations (there was some confusion over his ban, a number of press reports said he was suspended until 19th October whereas the Italian federation said it was 19th July). Rowing is lucky in that there aren’t many cases of doping so those that do happen reflect badly on the sport as a whole. Abbagnale was World Champion in this event in 2013 and was part of the M8 that finished 6th in 2015. He’s joined by Jacapo Mancini and cox Riccardo Zoppini. Mancini raced in the M8 at the European Championships and then at the U23 World Championships.\n\nThe French are an interesting crew, Thibault Colard and Thomas Baroukh are unusual in that they are lightweights racing in what is considered the most brutal of heavyweight events. But they are a talented pair having been members of the LM4- that won a bronze medal in 2015 and again at the Rio Olympics. They raced as a M2- in Lucerne finishing 10th.\n\nGreat Britain also have a strong chance of a good medal in Sarasota. Newcastle University graduates and Leander Club members Tom Ford and Tim Clarke (coxed by Harry Brightmore from Oxford Brookes) both made their senior debuts this season and won silver in the M8 in their first race in Belgrade. For Lucerne they moved into the M2- and finished 8th.\n\nGermany won the M2+ at the final World Cup in Lucerne but have made a change to their line up for Sarasota. Malte Grossmann is now joined by University of Washington graduate Finn Schroeder. Schroeder raced with Anton Braun in the M2- at Lucerne but struggled back in 14th.\n\nHungary are another country with a strong chance of taking the win, they are possibly the most experienced crew in the field. Adrian Juhasz and Bela Simin Jr have been racing together for a number of years. They finished 9th in the M2- at the Rio Olympics and so far this season have a 10th place from Belgrade and 9th from the European Championships, both in the M2-) For Sarasota they gain Andrea Vanda Kollath in the coxes seat.\n\nRomania have a strong chance for a medal as well, Adrian Damii and Mihaita-Vasile Tiganescu have raced in a variety of different boat classes this season. Both were members of the M8 that finished 6th at the Europeans. Damii raced the M8 in Lucerne taking 4th and Tiganescu partnered Cosmin Pascari in the M2- that also finished 4th.\n\nThe final crews to mention are the Australians and Spanish. The Aussies, Darcy Wruck and Angus Widdicombe (and cox James Rook) are the spares for the men’s team and raced in the M8 in Poznan finishing 4th and then the M4- in Lucerne. Spain (Jamie Lara Pacheco, Marco Sardelli Gil and Jurado Diaz) have a bronze medal from Lucerne (albeit from a 3 boat final). Both were members of the M8 that missed qualification for the Olympics when they came 5th at the Final Qualifying Regatta.\n\nMy picks….I think it’ll be between the Italians and Romanians for the gold with the British taking the bronze.\n\nW2-\n\n12 crews\n\nChina, Denmark, Spain, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Romania, Serbia, USA\n\nWith the departure of the dominant British pair of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning from this event, the battle to take over their mantle looks to have been won by New Zealand. Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler have been rowing together for a number of years, placing 7th in the W8 in 2013 and then becoming World Champions in the W4- in 2014. They formed their pairs partnership in 2015 where they finished runners-up to the British (and doubled up in the W8 to take another silver). In Rio they stayed in the W8 but just missed out on the medals. For 2017 they are concentrating on the W2- and have, so far, completely dominated the event winning in both Poznan and Lucerne by over 5 seconds. They also won the inaugural W2- event at Henley. It’ll take something very special to deny the Kiwis their first W2- title since 2011.\n\nThe main threat to the kiwis will come from the highly experienced Americans, Megan Kalmoe and Tracy Eisser. They were runners-up to the New Zealanders at both the 2nd and 3rd World Cups. Both have been mostly racing in the quad over the past few years and finished 5th in Rio. They were both in the crew that won an historic gold at the world Championships in 2015 and Kalmoe has a bronze medal in the quad from the 2012 Games. Now back in their preferred pair’s boat they aill be among the favourites for a medal.\n\nRomania have a long tradition in this boat class and this year’s pairing look set to continue that strong history. Madalina Beres and Laura Oprea are doubling up in the W8 (a common occurrence for the Romanians). They were bronze medallists in the W8 and so far this season have golds in both W8 and W2- from the Europeans and were part of the W8 that won in Lucerne.\n\nIt looks highly likely that the medals will be decided between these three crews. However the Danes may look to break into the medal party. Hedvig Rasmussen and Christina Johansen were silver medallists at the Europeans and took bronze in Lucerne. Rasmussen is no stranger to this event having finished 4th in 2015 and then taking the bronze in Rio with partner Anne Andersen. Her new partner for 2017, Johansen is less experienced, having raced in the W4X during the 2014 season, but they look to be developing nicely as a pair and will be pushing for a medal.\n\nTaking over from a pair that was as successful as Glover and Stanning is never going to be easy and the pair tasked with that challenge is Holly Hill and Melissa Wilson. This is very much a crew for the future and both have won medals at U23 level. The worlds will be their first race in the pair having been in the W4- in Lucerne that finished 6th. An A-final placing would be a great start to their pair’s project.\n\nAnother crew looking to reach the A-Final as a minimum in Sarasota are the Spanish. Anna Boada Peiro and Aina Cid I having been racing together as a pair since the U23 world Championships in 2014. They won a bronze medal at the Varese World Cup in 2016 and then qualified for the Rio Olympics by winning the Final Qualifying Regatta. They had a great regatta in Rio reaching the A-Final. They’ve not raced since the Olympic final so it remains to be seen whether they have the pace to make the final again.\n\nAlso watch out for the Chinese, with Rio Olympian Tian Miao joined by U23 international Mingwei Zhao and also the young Italian crew of Ilaria Broggini and Veronica Calabrese (4th at the Europeans).\n\nMy picks…yet another win for the dominant Kiwis with the Romanians pipping the Americans for the silver.\n\nM2-\n\n19 crews\n\nArgentina, Belarus, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Serbia, Turkey, USA.\n\nNow that the “World’s Best Crew” have hung-up their oars (and in the case of Hamish Bond, got on his bike) there was a scramble at the start of the new season to see who would emerge as their successors. All eyes were on the Sinkovic brothers from Croatia, dominant in the M2X and now trying their hands at single oared racing. But, injury ruled them out until the Lucerne World Cup. Lucerne also saw the first appearance of the season of the new Kiwi Pair of Thomas Murray and former lightweight James Hunter. Word was the Kiwi pair were very, very quick and so it turned out. The results show that the New Zealanders led at every marker but the reality was that it was a real scrap for the line. The Sinkovic’s mounted a huge final sprint and looked set to overhaul the New Zealanders before a slight wash out in the final 50 metres cost robbed spectators of a potential photo-finish. Now, with 2 more months of training under their belts the next showdown between the Kiwis and Croatians could well be the most eagerly anticipated races of the whole championships.\n\nBut, this isn’t just about the Croatians and Kiwis. The Italians have a very strong boat for Sarasota. Matteo Lodo and Giuseppe Vicino were both members of the World Championship winning M4- in 2015 and Olympic bronze medallists at the Rio Olympics. They’ve only raced once so far this season but that was a gold medal at the European Championships. They may not be able to match the Croatians and New Zealanders, but they will be strong favourites for the bronze.\n\nAlso challenging for the medals are the French Onfroy brothers, Theophile and Valentin. Like the Italians they raced in the M4- at the Rio Olympics finishing 11th. For 2017 they’ve moved into the pair and have, so far, had a very successful season. Silver medallists at the European Championships, they took gold in Poznan and then bronze in Lucerne.\n\nSerbia’s Nenad Bedik and Milos Vasic are one of the most experienced pairings in the event. 10th in the M2- at the Rio Olympics, they have medalled every time they’ve raced so far this season with silver in Belgrade, bronze at the Europeans and silver behind the French in Poznan.\n\nAnother Olympic crew continuing into 2017 are the Czechs, Jakub Podrazil and Lukas Helsic. They won the B-Final in Rio and so far this season have medals at the European Championships and both the 1st and 2nd World Cups. Lucerne was a little disappointing when they only managed a 9th place. They will be looking for a solid A-Final finish in Florida.\n\nSpain will be looking for a solid A-Final finish, Alexander Sigurbjonsson and Pau Vela Maggi finished 10th in 2015 and also raced at the Olympics. Their best performance so far this season was a 6th place at the Lucerne World Cup.\n\nAlso keep an eye out for the Dutch crew, Lex Van den Herik and Bo Wullings from Nereus. They raced in the M8 that won a spectacular gold medal in Belgrade. Herik finished the season as U23 World Champion as a member of the BM8.\n\nMy picks…I’m going to go for a win for the Croatians over the Kiwis with the Italians in bronze.\n\nNext up are the double sculls…\n\nLW2X\n\n10 crews\n\nCanada, China, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Switzerland, Sweden, USA, Venezuela.\n\nThis has the makings of a three-way battle for the gold between China, New Zealand and Poland. The Chinese, Fang Chen and Dandan pan are doubling up in the lW4x which may not play to their advantage, but they are an outstanding combination (if not too pleasant to watch technically!)\n\nAs a double this duo raced in Poznan finishing nearly 2 seconds up on Poland. Pan was 5th in the LW4X in 2015 and was bronze medallist in the LW2X with Wenyi Huang in 2014. Despite only being 21 she has a wealth of international experience having won her first senior medal back in 2011 when she won bronze in the LW4X at the Bled World Championships aged just 15! Her partner in Florida, Fang Chen has a far shorter international history having made her debut in Poznan this season, but it’s always great to start your senior international career with a win!\n\nNew Zealand will probably start as the favourites in Sarasota. Zoe McBride and Jackie Kiddle were winners in comfortable winners in Lucerne, taking the gold by over 4 seconds ahead of Poland. Mcbride is the reigning LW1X World Champion (after successfully defending her title in Rotterdam) and is also the current holder of the World’s Best Time in the LW1X. Since moving into the Olympic class boat she’s formed an extremely fast combination with Jackie Kiddle. Kiddle won gold in the U23 BLW2X in 2015 and followed that up with a silver in 2016. She also has a gold medal in the LW1X from this year’s Poznan World Cup. With the pedigree and potential that this crew has they could well dominate the event all the way to Tokyo and beyond.\n\nPoland started the season well, winning in Belgrade and then taking the European title in Racice. However they had to play 2nd fiddle at the 2nd and 3rD World Cups, first to the Chinese and then to the Kiwis. In response to this they’ve made a change to the line-up, out goes Martyna Mikolajczak and in comes Joanna Dorociak to join Weronika Deresz. Deresz finished last season with a win in the B-Final at the Olympic Games. Dorociak has spent this season racing in the LW1X taking bronze in Belgrade and silver in Poznan. She and Deresz have raced together in the LW2X a number of times over the past few years finishing 7th in both 2014 and 2015.\n\nGreat Britain will be hoping to make this a four-horse race for the medals rather than just a three-horse one. Since winning the Olympic title in 2012 they have had a fairly torrid time trying to find a combination that can consistently deliver medal winning performances. Olympic champion Kat Copeland has been the one consistent member of the crew but the GB coaches have tried a number of different partners including Imogen Walsh and Charlotte Booth before settling on Emily Craig. This new combination came together in the middle of the season taking bronze at the European Championships and then 4th in Poznan (although disappointingly they were beaten by 2 Chinese boats). In a tougher field in Lucerne they reached the A-Final but finished 3 seconds off a medal. The Brits undoubtedly have the potential, and this new combination definitely seems to be a better “fit” than previously. It’s going to be very much a case of if they can get it right on the day they can be in the mix for a medal.\n\nOther contenders for the A-Final (if not the medals) include the Russians, Anastasiia Ianina and Anastasia Lebedeva. They are a new combination and took the bronze medal in their first race together in Lucerne. Ianina finished 6th in the LW1X last year following a 10th place in the LW2X in 2015. Lebedeva has been racing in the LW1X this season with a best performance of 4th at the European Championships. It remains to be seen if their performance in Lucerne was a true indicator of their speed or just a “one hit wonder”.\n\nThe Romanians, Ionela-Livia Lehaci and Gianina-Elena Beleaga are also one’s to watch, they are a young crew and won the U23 BLW2X world title last month. They were just outside of the medals at the Europeans at raced at the Rio Olympics finishing 9th. They may not be among the medals in Sarasota but are undoubtedly ones to watch in the coming years.\n\nAlso keep an eye on the crew from Switzerland, Pauline Delacroix and Freerique Rol. They were 4th in Lucerne and 9th at the Europeans, an A-Final placing in Sarasota would be the minimum they are after.\n\nA number of nations have young, development crews racing including the Greeks and Italians. Thomais Emmanouilidou and Maria Pergouli of Greece were 8th at the Europeans and also in Lucerne. They raced at the U23 World Championships last month taking the bronze medal behind the Romanians. The Italians also have a crew of 2017 U23 medallists racing with Allegra Francalacci who took silver in the BLw2X and Valentina Rodini who won gold in the BLW4X.\n\nThe final two crews to mention are the Germans and Americans. Germany have Fini Sturm who finished 11th in Rio and Leonie Pless. This season they have a best finish of 5th at the Poznan World Cup. The USA, Michelle Sechser and Emily Schmeig are racing the LW2X for the first time, Schmeig finished 5th in the LW4X at last year’s world Championships and Sechser was 11th in the LW2X in 2015.\n\nIt’s also great to see so many entries from smaller rowing nations like Guatemala, Peru, Nigeria, and Venezuela.\n\nMy picks…hard to see anyone beating the Kiwis with the Chinese in silver and bronze going to Poland.\n\nLM2X\n\n24 crews\n\nArgentina, Belgium, Canada, China, The Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, France, Great Britain, Germany, Guatemala, Italy, Japan, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Russia, Uganda, Ukraine, Uruguay, The USA, Uzbekistan, Venezuela.\n\nThere have been a number of events over the years where the question hasn’t been “who will win gold” but “who will win silver” such is the dominance of one crew. In the M2- it was Murray and Bond of New Zealand, in the W8 it was (although may no longer be) the Americans and in the M2X it was martin and Valent Sinkovic of Croatia. Another crew to add to that list are Pierre Houin and Jeremie Azou of France in the LM2X. They are unbeaten in the LM2X since forming their partnership in the middle of 2016. Indeed Azou has only been beaten once in the LM2X since finishing 4th at the London Olympics when he and previous partner Stany Delayre were defeated by 1/10th second by the South Africans at the 2014 world Championships. For his part Houin has an equally impressive record, he’s not lost a race since finishing 3rd in the U23 BLW2X in 2014. Their task of retaining their World Title was made slightly less challenging by the withdrawal of one of their main rivals from Ireland.\n\nSo, to answer my own question…who will win the silver? The Italians will be the favourites for this, runners-up (by 3 seconds) to the French at Lucerne and bronze medallists at the Europeans. Both Stefano Oppo and Pietro Ruta have made the switch from the LM4- to the LM2X this season. They were part of the LM4- that just missed the medals in Rio. Ruta is no stranger to the LM2X having raced the event at the London Olympics and been an A-Finalist in 2013, 2014 and 2015. They are probably the stand-out crew after the French.\n\nBelgium will also be in with a shout of a medal, Tim Brys and Niels Van Zandweghe were 4th in their sole outing this season in Lucerne. They were desperately unlucky not to race at the Olympics having won the Final Olympic Qualifying Regatta but foregoing their place due to the Olympic quota system (BEL had to choose between sending the M1X or LM2X and they chose the former).\n\nThe Czech Republic, Jiri Simanek and Miroslav Vrastil made the A-Final in Lucerne and will be looking to repeat that in Sarasota. They were silver medallists in Belgrade and just missed the A Final at the Europeans.\n\nStrong contenders for the minor medals will be the Germans, Jason Osborne and Lucas Schaeffer. Both have Olympic experience with Osborne having raced in the LM2X and schaeffer the LM4-. So far this season they have a 5th place at the Europeans and another from Poznan.\n\nAlso looking for a solid A-final performance are the new British pairing of Sam Mottram and Jamie Copus. This duo were part of the U23 LM4X that won silver at the World Championships in 2015. So far this season they were part of the LM4X that raced in the open-weight division in Poznan and then as a LM2X they won the B-Final in Lucerne.\n\nPoland had a disappointing race in Lucerne finishing at the back of the B-final, Jerzy Kowalski and Milosz Jankowski had performed strongly throughout the World Cup season taking bronze at both Belgrade and Poznan and just missing the medals at the Europeans in Racice. They will be looking to return to that medal-winning form in Florida and if they can they will be in the mix for the minor medals.\n\nAnother crew that could be in the mix are the Chinese, Man Sun and Junjie Fan. 4th in Poznan, Man raced in this boat class in Rio finishing 11th and Fan was a member of the heavyweight M8 that came 12th at the 2015 World Championships.\n\nDenmark have a great record in this event with Rasmussen and Quist winning the gold at the London Olympics. This year’s crew of Emil Espensen and Mathias Larsen have a best finish of 9th this season from the European Championships. Both were members of the LM4X that won bronze in 2015.\n\nOf the rest it’s just worth giving a mention to the Spanish, with Jesus Gonzalez Alvarez and Patricio Rojas Aznar. 6th in Belgrade, Gonzalez Alvarez is, at 43, the oldest man in the field (and is the oldest man racing at the championships) with a senior career that stretches back to 1991.\n\nMy picks….if anyone gets within a length of the French it’ll be a surprise. The Italians look good for the silver with the Poles to regain their mojo and grab bronze.\n\nW2X\n\n15 crews\n\nAustralia, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, USA.\n\nThis is another event where the Kiwis will start as strong favourites. The defending World Champions have a completely new line-up for 2017 with Brooke Donoghue and Olivia Loe, but that hasn’t changed the result – they’ve won gold at both the 2nd and 3rd World Cups and won the inaugural Women’s Double Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta – not bad in your first full season together as seniors.\n\nBehind the Kiwis it’s shaping up to be a tight battle between the French, Australians and Lithuanians.\n\nFrance finished runners-up to the New Zealanders in Lucerne, Helene Lefebvre and Elodie Ravera-Scaramozzino raced as at the Rio Olympics finishing 5th and so far this season they raced in the W4X at the Europeans finishing 5th before moving back to the double for Lucerne.. Ravera-Scaramozzino then went to the U23 World Championships where she finished 4th in the BW1X.\n\nAustralia will be keen to spoil their neighbour’s party, Olympia Aldersey and Maddy Edmunds both raced at the Olympics (Aldersey in the W8 and Edmunds in the W4X). They had a successful European campaign taking bronze in Poznan and then 4th in Lucerne.\n\nLithuania were World Champions in this event in 2013 with a crew that included a 19 year old Milda Valciukaite. She went on to win bronze in Rio with partner Donata Vistartaite. For 2017 she’s partnered by two-time U23 BW1X World Champion Ieva Adomaviciute. Their one and only race together this season ended with a 5th place in Lucerne. It may take this combination a little time to gel but they will be strong contenders as the Olympiad progresses.\n\nThe Czech Republic, Kristyna Fleissnerova and Lenka Antosova, are a well-established partnership having raced together for the last couple of seasons. They have a bronze medal from the 2016 Europeans and followed that with 10th in Rio. So far this season they’ve had some strong performances, winning gold at the European Championships and a bronze at the 1st World Cup. Lucerne was a bit of a disappointment when they finished 9th, but will be looking for an improvement in Sarasota and an A-Final at the very least.\n\nThe USA have the highly experienced duo of Meghan O’Leary and Ellen Tomek. They have raced as a W2X at the last 3 World Championships with a best performance of 6th in 2014. They finished last season with another A-Final finish at the Rio Olympics. They may not quite match the Kiwis but will be in the mix for the medals.\n\nOther crews to mention include the Chinese, Fei Wang and Yang Lyu. They’ve not raced together in the W2X on the international stage, but they were both in the W4X that finished 3rd in Poznan (Wang’s only other international appearance was the Sydney World Cup in 2013). Lyu has far more international experience than her partner with a World Championship silver medal in the W4X in 2014 and an 11th place in the W2X at the Rio Olympics. Time will tell how quick this new combination will be.\n\nThe Dutch, Roos De Jong and Marloes Oldenburg were silver medallists in Belgrade but struggled in Lucerne only managing 11th place.\n\nAlso worth a mention are the Germans, Carlotta Nwajde and Julia Leiding, 4th at the Euroeans and Poznan World Cup, and the Italians, Kiri Tontodonati and Stefania Gobbi, 3rd at the Europeans (and Gobbi won silver at the U23 Worlds).\n\nMy picks….New Zealand for the win with the Czechs in silver and the Australians in bronze.\n\nM2X\n\n21 crews\n\nArgentina, Australia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Cuba, Estonia, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, The Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, USA\n\nThis is shaping up to be one of the most competitive events at the whole championships. With the Croatian Sinkovic brothers swapping two oars for one with their switch to the coxless pair, this event has been blown wide open.\n\nThe leading crew of the season so far are the Kiwis, John Storey and Chris Harris. Both raced at the Rio Olympics with Storey finishing 9th in the M4X and Harris 11th in the M2X. Since forming their new partnership at the start of the season they’ve made an impressive start, winners in Poznan by 4 seconds they followed this up with a tighter victory in Lucerne. They were also winners at Henley Royal Regatta (handing Azou and Hoiun a rare defeat). The New Zealander’s just seem to have this amazing ability to develop outstanding small boats and to take athletes who have been “there or thereabouts” in bigger boats or combinations and put them together in combinations that just seem to gel and take their performances to another level. We’ve seen this with the LW2X and also the M2- (more on them later), and now the M2X. They will be very, very difficult to beat in Sarasota.\n\nOne crew who could upset the Kiwi party are the Norwegians with the legendary Olaf Tufte joined by 2013 World Champion Kjetil Borch. This duo have a wealth of Olympic experience, they have 8 Olympic appearances between them. Bronze medallists from Rio they took silver in Poznan before suffering illness in Lucerne which meant they missed out on the A-Final and didn’t race the B-Final giving them an official placing of 12th. With the racing experience these two have they will be serious challengers to yet another New Zealand victory.\n\nAlso threatening the medals will be the Poles, Miroslaw Zietarski and Mateusz Biksup. They just missed out on the medals in the M4X at the Rio Olympics finishing 4th. So far this season they’ve been switching between the M4X and M2X. In the M4X they placed 2nd in Belgrade and 5th in Poznan. As a double they won silver medal at the European Championships and followed that up with silver in Lucerne.\n\nSilver medallists in Rio were the Lithuanians, Mindaugus Griskonis and Saulius Ritter. They started this season back in the M2x and took gold in Belgrade. Their performance at the European Championships was a little disappointing when they missed the A-Final ending up 7th. For Lucerne Griskonis raced in the M1X finishing 8th with Ritter subbing in to the M4X and taking the gold. If they show the sort of speed they had in Rio it could be a titanic battle at the front of the field.\n\nItaly will be another very strong young crew, Filippo Mondelli and Luca Rambaldi were both medallists at the 2016 U23 World Championships. Since forming their doubles partnership they’ve shown really good speed, especially at the European Championships where they ended the week as champions. They didn’t race in Poznan but put in a great performance in Lucerne taking the bronze behind the Kiwis and Poles.\n\nAnother A-Final contender are the young Swiss crew, Barnabe Delarze and Roman Roeoesli. 7th in the M4X at the Rio Olympics they’ve won medals at both the 1st World Cup and the European Championships and then finished 4th in Lucerne (albeit 5 seconds off bronze).\n\nA crew I’m really looking forward to seeing are the new British combination of Angus Groom and Graeme Thomas. Both of these guys have been out of action all season through injury but have recovered just in time to get selection as a double. Groom raced in the M4X in Rio (replacing Thomas who was injured). Thomas had been an integral part of the success of the GB M4X during the Rio Olympiad that included a World Championship silver medal in 2014. Coached by Hamish Burrell they are a crew with a massive amount of potential and could well develop into the best British M2X since Baillieu and Hart. It’s probably too much to expect a medal-winning performance this year but the Kiwis, Poles, Norwegians et al better watch out in 2018!\n\nOther crews to mention include the French – Matthieu Androdias and Hugo Boucheron – 6th in Rio, Australia – with Olympian David Watts and U23 World Champion Luke Letcher and Belarus with Dzianis Mihal and Pilip Pavukou – finalists at both the 1st and 3rd World Cups and the European Championships.\n\nMy picks….could be really, really close but you have to go with a Kiwi victory with Lithuania in silver and Poland in 3rd.\n\nNext up are the coxless fours…\n\nLM4-\n\n6 crews\n\nChina, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Russia, USA\n\nOh how the mighty have fallen….with FISA and the IOC agreeing to drop this event from the Olympic programme it’s rapidly gone from one of the most eagerly contested events to one in its death-throws, indeed FISA have recently proposed that the LM4- is removed from the World Championship programme as well. At least it means it has a quick death rather than a lingering one of dwindling entries and quality.\n\nWhat this does mean is that whoever wins in Sarasota has the chance of becoming the reigning World Champions in perpetuity!\n\nThe medals look to be a clear three-way battle between the Chinese, Italians and Russians.\n\nThe light four has been raced twice so far this season, first at the European Championships and then at Lucerne. Russia took the honours at the Europeans with their crew of Maksim Telitcyn, Aleksander Bogdashin, Alexander Chaukin and Aleksey Vikulin pushing the Italians into 2nd. But in Lucerne Italy made three changes to their line-up with just Piero Sfiligoi remaining from the Europeans, in came Federico Duchich, Leone Barbaro and Lorenzo Tedesco and they overturned the defeat in Racice.\n\nChina have three of the crew that raced in Rio last season finishing 8th – Jingbin Zhoa, Chenggang Yu and Tiexin Wang. They are joined by Xiaoxiong Li who raced in the heavyweight M8 in 2015. They’ve not raced so far this season, but with their Olympic experience so will be serious contenders for the win.\n\nBehind these three crews the German’s will most likely be the strongest, the crew of Patrik Stoecker, Sven Kessler, Jonathan Koch and Julius Peschel finished third in Lucerne. Koch raced in the LM4- at the Olympics and Kessler and Peschel finished 8th in the LM2- at last year’s World championships. Stoecker was world champion in the LM4X last year.\n\nThe Hungarians, Balazs Fiala, Bence Tamas, Peter Csiszar and Peter Krpesics raced as a LM4X in Lucerne finishing 10th.\n\nThe USA have two of the crew that won bronze in the LM8 in 2015 Nicholas Dawe and David Smith, they are joined by Andrew Neils from Virginia who raced in the LM4X in 2014 and former Yale oarsman Tom Foster.\n\nMy picks…Italy for gold with China in silver and the Russians bronze.\n\nW4-\n\n12 crews\n\nAustralia, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, USA.\n\nThe LM4- loss is the W4- gain, with the event now being added to the Olympic programme for Tokyo 2020 it suddenly takes on a much more intriguing aspect. Some countries are doubling up their senior athletes in the W8 and others are using it as a means of bringing on new talent or raising the profile of those existing senior athletes who hadn’t previously been part of an Olympic class boat.\n\nAustralia will start as favourites in Sarasota, the crew of Lucy Stephan, Katrina Werry, Sarah Hawe and Molly Goodman are unbeaten so far this season with wins at both the 2nd and 3rd World Cups. Stephan and Goodman were both members of the W8 that raced at the Rio Olympics. Hawe and Goodman doubled up in the W2- at Poznan taking the bronze medal.\n\nCanada are one of the nation’s doubling up in the W8. Three of the crew (Susanne Grainiger, Christine Roper and Nicole Hare) raced at Lucerne finishing 3rd. For the World Championships the 4th member of the Lucerne crew, Hillary Janssens, is replaced by Lisa Roman. This change measn there are now three of the W8 that finished 5th at the Rio Olympics. Hare is an outstanding young talent with a gold medal from the U23 World Championships last year. So long as they’re not too fatigued from racing in the W8 they could be serious contenders for the gold medal.\n\nGreat Britain have made wholesale changes to the crew that finished 6th in Lucerne with only U23 silver medallist Rowan McKellar remaining in the boat. She’s joined by Caragh McMurtry, who raced in the W8 at Poznan, and fellow U23 medallist Samantha Courty and 2017 debutant Becca Girling. This is a boat with a lot of potential, but will probably need another season together to be challenging for the medals.\n\nRomania are the reigning European champions and last month won silver at the U23 World Championships. With an average age of just 21, the crew of Cristina-Georgina Popescu, Alina Ligia Pop, Beatrice-Madalina Parfenie and Roxana Parascanu are a very exciting proposition and could be serious contenders throughout the Olympiad. They have a good chance of getting close to the medals this year.\n\nRussia finished runners-up to the Australians in Lucerne, Elena Oriabinskaia, Anastasia Tikhanova, Ekatarina Potapova and Alevtina Savkina all raced in the W8 at the European Championships winning a bronze medal. Potapova was 4th in the W2- in 2016 and Tikhanova was European Champion in the W8 in 2015. They will be another crew that are serious contenders for a medal in Florida.\n\nPoland will be in the mix as well, European silver medallists, they took silver in Belgrade and bronze in Poznan ending with 5th in Lucerne. However their preparations for Sarasota were dealt a serious blow when Anna Wierzbowska suffered a serious leg injury after being hit by a truck whilst training on her bike. Her place in the crew is taken by 2016 U23 World Champion Olga Michaliewicz. She joins Anna’s sister Maria, and Rio bronze medallist Monika Ciaciuch with the final seat filled by Joanna Dittmann. It remains to be seen how well the crew (especially Maria) cope following the loss of Anna.\n\nThe USA raced two crews at the Poznan World Cup finishing 2nd and 5th. In the end one each from those two boats were selected for the Worlds, Erin Reelick and Molly Bruggeman. They join Chase Kendall and Kristine O’brien who raced in the W8 in Poznan. Bruggeman and O’Brien were silver medallists last year and Kendall was U23 World Champion in the W8 in 2016 (a title that Reelick won in 2015). This is another strong boat and will be in the mix in what will be an incredibly competitive event.\n\nKeep an eye-out for two young crews from Italy (average age 20) and New Zealand (with three athletes under 21 on-board). The final crew to mention are the Chinese, with Rio Olympian Min Zhang on-board.\n\nMy picks…this promises to be a really tight event. Australia have the form so far this season, but the Dutch, Canadians, Romanians, Russians, Americans & possibly the Brits and Poles all being in with a shout of a medal. In the end I’m going for a 1,2,3 of Australia, Canada, USA.\n\nM4-\n\n16 crews\n\nArgentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Spain, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, South Africa, USA\n\nIf the German men consider the M8 to be “their” boat then for the British it’s the M4-. Coached by the legendary Jurgen Grobler the Union Jack has been raised above the top step of the podium at 9 of the last 15 World Championships (and the last 5 Olympic Games). It’s the no.1 mem’s boat in Britain and this year’s iteration is no different. They didn’t have the best start to the season, with original crewman Stewart Innes ruled out for the entire season through injury. In his place came 2016 M2+ World Champion Callum McBrierty. Their campaign opened with a win in Belgrade but then suffered the humiliation of 5th at the European Championships. For Poznan McBrierty was replaced by Matt Rossiter. In their first race together they took silver behind the Australians in Poznan and then ended the World Cup season with gold in Lucerne. With Rio gold medallists Will Satch and Mo Sbihi (possibly the best sweep oarsman in the world at the moment) and 2015 M2+ World Champion Matt Tarrant they are worthy successors to their illustrious predecessors.\n\nAustralia used to consider the M4- as their domain, back in the 90’s with the “Oarsome Foursome”. Since the rise of the British Four’s they and the Aussies have been slugging it out like a pair of heavyweight prize fighters. They’ve finished runners-up to the British at the last 3 Olympics. The “Green and Gold” haven’t won the world title for 26 years and they will be desperate to get the title, especially if it means getting one over on the top GB boat. This year’s crew includes Spencer Turrin who finished 2nd in the M4- in Rio along with fellow Olympian Alexander Hill along with Josh Hicks and Jack Hargreaves. In their first race of the season they beat the Brits in Poznan and then moved into the M8 for Lucerne taking the silver behind Germany. It struck me as an odd decision to move into the M8 for what would, in effect, be a one-off race, but perhaps they we"
