        "text": "I went to India and brought back a superpowered straightjacket.\n\nOne of the things that makes growing up a boy relatively easy compared to growing up a girl is the smaller number of lessons to learn and expectations to meet. I’m pretty sure I was 21 before I learned that every girl knows to take her keys out before she walks to her car, and that one technique is to put four keys between your fingers like Wolverine so you can stab a possible attacker in the eye and incapacitate him.\n\nIt’s undeniably harder to grow up a girl. But the overwhelming range of lessons and expectations does also come with certain areas of freedom amid all of the restrictions. For instance – how one dresses. Not necessarily how well or how modestly one dresses (still restricted there!), but what options women potentially have for styling their outfits.\n\nTake, for example, the three most famous players in the 2024 WNBA Draft. Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, and Angel Reese each wore very, very different outfits and each looked stunning in their own way. At least as they contend with all the limitations facing women’s sports, they’ll be able to express their unique senses of fashion. A matching white double satin shirt and skirt from Prada, along with a sparkly rhinestone mesh top underneath and black brushed leather slingback pumps? Hell yeah, Caitlin. A black-and-white asymmetrical Balmain gown featuring a thigh-high slit, a bodice cutout, and a rosette appliqué at the shoulder? Mercy, Cameron. A backless Bronx and Banco silver knit dress with a plunging V-neck and hood and coordinating Christian Louboutin pumps? Okay, Angel, Okay!\n\nA few weeks later, the NFL Draft kicked off with three quarterbacks selected, three new faces of the league. The first was Caleb Williams, one of the most “eccentric” prospects in recent years (excuse me while I unroll my eyes from inside my skull). And he wore…\n\nA suit. A navy suit with a double-breasted jacket that featured a zipper fastening instead of buttons.\n\nHe was followed up by Jayden Daniels, who wore…a suit. And then Drake Maye. Who also wore a suit.\n\nYou grow up as a boy with fewer rules and more freedom. You will not be held to the same impossible range of (sometimes contradictory) standards as your sisters, but what you find out later is that despite your developmental largesse, some paths are chosen for you, and those paths are narrow, and the ground outside them is rocky indeed.\n\nFrom adolescence into adulthood, there is a small but crucial set of criteria for American boys. Some of them can be helped and others can’t. Some actually make you more attractive to women (and/or men) and others don’t. Most of them are silly. The list is manageable because it’s so short. It’s daunting because it’s so limiting. Beginning with puberty, you want to become one of the taller in the class, grow body hair faster and better, get bigger and stronger, develop an above-average-size penis, and speak with a low voice. You get a little older and you must remain physically virile, prove to be sexually adept, exhibit confidence at all times, land on a stylish haircut and facial hair combo, maintain a good job, and dress professionally.\n\nQuite remarkably, this already narrow scope can be focused onto one simple signifier:\n\nYeah. The suit.\n\nThe suit is the panacea for manliness; with a good suit, you can check all the boxes.\n\nThis is something you learn from a young age as a boy. Just one example: I remember watching an episode of Jimmy Neutron where Jimmy wears a suit to the wedding of Jet Fusion and Beautiful Gorgeous, and Cindy – his frenemy – goes absolutely googly-eyed. When a character voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP) asks “What did we all learn today?” Cindy replies “Clothes make the man!”\n\nBoys grow up knowing there are many things they will be expected to do to remain respected and admired by men and women (and let’s not pretend this is all about straight men wanting to be desirable to women). You learn about deodorant, and undershirts, and manscaping, and beard balm, and aftershave, and scotch, and cigars, and golf, and [redacted because my grandma reads this] – again, a shorter and less onerous list than girls are given. And you learn about suits. You know you will have to wear one because you’ll make good first impressions, command respect, demonstrate your professionalism, and look really hot.\n\nThing is…suits suck.\n\nI know – I know – that many men feel most comfortable wearing a suit, but they are deluded if they’re telling you they’re comfy. They’re not – especially if you’re wearing a necktie. They’re also hot, sweaty, inconvenient in the bathroom, a task to put on and take off, high maintenance, and expensive. And the real kick in the inseam? It’s tough to look good in one.\n\nThat’s not contradictory to the premise that everyone thinks men look great in suits; rather, it is an extension of it. Men who are heavier might still look professional or powerful, but as often as not they might find themselves in an outfit that is either too tight or too baggy, especially if their weight fluctuates, and in the cultural imagination the fat man in a suit is sometimes symbolic for wanton greed or organized crime. Men who are slight can hardly win, because either a fitted suit will draw attention to how thin and bony they are, or they will swim in a suit that is too big for them.\n\nAnd maybe some will insist that skinny and heavy men do still look good in suits – “you just have to be confident!” As if confidence is something one can simply drum up when they want a promotion or a date. The little black dress (a la Audrey Hepburn in that really good really racist movie) is about the best thing ever, but I would never tell a woman “oh just be confident! You’ll feel good wearing it I promise! It’s all in your head!”\n\nEven when a man does find a suit that fits him right and makes him look good and feel confident, the resulting signifiers are startlingly narrow. What do you project in a suit? Wearing a suit basically says three things: “I am taking this event seriously,” “I am a successful person,” and “Look how hot I am.” There’s only so much room to expand on this: vest and no jacket and you’re a groomsman at a hipster wedding. Switch the tie for a pocket square and you’re a groomsman at a metro wedding. Maybe you can get a little zany with the colors and patterns, but there is very little middle ground between “normal” and “Craig Sager” (RIP). Most variations on color and style either shunt you into a cliché or stereotype (white suits = Miami Vice) or they just double down on the aforementioned signals (for me, an all black suit (pants/shirt/tie/jacket) says “I’m really taking this seriously and I’m really hot”). Really, for the most part, men fall in line with what’s in with suits. Just think of the fads for light brown dress shoes or white soled black dress shoes, or how you could watch the halftime report of a Champions League match on Fox and see four or five sets of sockless ankles.\n\nConversely, those ankles would be accompanied by the goddess Kate Abdo (who is basically the studio host Andy Murray to the Joker/Rafa/Federer of Rebecca Lowe/Michelle Beadle/Ernie Johnson), who has a plethora of options for expressing herself while looking professional and damn good. Again, think of the W draftees; Caitlin, Cameron, and Angel all expressed a lot about themselves beyond “I am taking this big event seriously and also I am hot.”\n\nAnd yet, despite its many and obvious limitations, men have bought into the idea that the suit really does give them superpowers. It might not be a coincidence that we call what superheroes wear “suits,” and in almost any Marvel/DC movie the suit channels or augments the hero’s power (or grants it whole cloth!). There is clearly something alluring about the idea of putting on a costume and gaining access to incredible powers, especially if they are an extension of your pre-existing talents and skills. So too is the idea of looking dapper while being a badass – examples abound of this, perhaps with James Bond as the ur-text. The two combine to some degree in John Wick, who wears fantastic-looking suits that also grant him super-powered upgrades (namely, being bulletproof). Well-dressed, skilled in combat, dog lover? John Wick is basically the ideal American man – thank goodness he is played by someone as kind, gentle, and unproblematic as Keanu Reeves.\n\nI’ve been thinking about all this and am now writing about it because I recently acquired a couple nice suits. How and why I got them, how I’ve felt wearing them, and how other people have reacted to them have made me feel a lot of things and given me lots to think about. And, in recent weeks, my body dysmorphia has gotten pretty bad again, and unpacking how I feel about suits might help me in reckoning with why I can’t go get a donut in the break room right now or miss a workout tomorrow. Yeah I’m gonna tell you about India but if you think you can get through a blog post without me oversharing and being an English Major you’re clearly new here.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI’m a developmentally-imbalanced male, and the areas I have most typically been slow in are anything related to the body and physicality. A late bloomer, I guess. So, naturally, I didn’t wear a suit until I was 20 years old.\n\nIt was the first suit that was ever “mine” (although I didn’t have to pay for it) and it was for my sister’s wedding. Gray with a white shirt and purple tie. We took some measurements and ordered it and then took it in to be altered so it would fit right. I remember being at the seamstress hating every minute of it. I didn’t want to wear the suit and I didn’t much care how it fit me. My go to style at the time was cargo shorts and Christian rap tees with cross trainers, and I had – for years – avoided wearing dress clothes whenever possible. They made me feel like a dog wearing people clothes.\n\nIt was fitting that at that point in my life the suit didn’t fit. I had never been uncomfortable with my physique, opting to distort and hide the slight frame of my body in loose pants and large tees, and trying never to show more skin than necessary – I always wore a t-shirt under my basketball jerseys and shorts to below my knees. I was also just not confident in being an adult man yet. Sure, lots of 20-year-olds don’t know how to tie a tie, but that grew out of my disdain for having to do anything an adult would need to learn – especially if it was a traditionally “male” thing.\n\nSo I went to the wedding (which was beautiful) and begrudgingly wore the suit and had someone help me tie the tie and to my surprise people thought I looked great. I had never ever been complimented on my appearance the way I was wearing that suit. Maybe there was something to this suit thing after all?\n\nBut when I looked at pictures from the wedding later, I didn’t see myself the same way. Yes, I had successfully hidden my hips and ass and every other contour of my body, but the result was that while the other groomsmen looked like they were wearing suits made for them, I looked like someone draped their suit on me.\n\nI don’t know if I was seeing myself accurately, but at the time it was enough to confirm my mistrust of dress clothes and hide the suit in the closet. A few years later, actually wanting for once to wear a suit for a formal occasion, I got the suit out to see if maybe I had misremembered, but sure enough I still felt like I swam in it. It wasn’t an option, and spending hundreds of dollars on a new suit wasn’t either, especially when most future groomsmen duties promised to come with a pricey rental picked out by someone else. Plus it was looking like I would never have a job where a suit was required. So fuck it – no more suits.\n\nLast year, I went to five weddings. I went to the first in my English adjunct blazer with my girlfriend. The next two I went to newly-single in slacks, button up, and tie, in weather so hot that I wouldn’t have worn a suit even if I had one.\n\nThe fourth was the one I was most excited for because it was between two of my good friends whom I love. And it was the one I was most dreading, because I was at the very bottom of my singleness depression and we’re in a beautiful friend group of four couples and me. It was in chilly October, so I put an argyle sweater over a white shirt and a tie with maroon chinos – a look I really, really like.\n\nAnd then I went to the wedding and every guy there was in a suit. Every. Fucking. One. And most of them – maybe all of them? – had a date, too. I felt like I had missed something. Why didn’t I know that of course you were supposed to wear a suit to something like this? And was that somehow connected to why I was single? Not like oh if I just had a suit I would have a girlfriend but like does my lack of both come from the same flaws in my personality? Perhaps there was something fundamentally lacking in me that could be fixed just by putting on a suit.\n\nWhen I went to India the first time this year, I didn’t put too much thought into what clothes to pack. Most days at work I wear a polo or quarter zip embroidered with the school’s logo and “Admissions.” So that’s mostly what I packed, and for the first half of the trip my main regret was not packing more casual clothes for the little downtime we were afforded.\n\nLater in the trip, working with a man I’ll call Vik, we had the opportunity to be interviewed by a local Telugu newspaper. Vik asked if I had a suit or blazer to wear. I was a little embarrassed not to, but also confused. Why would I need one? I’m an admissions counselor and dressed like one. I told him I’d bring my English adjunct blazer next time and chalked it up to him being old school (he wears a suit every day).\n\nWhen I returned to India a few weeks later, I brought my blazer. Vik texted me while I was en route that I should wear it on the first day for another press appearance. As we posed for photos, I felt like I had done exactly what I needed to. Indians love a photo-op. Like I can’t overstate it. Every visit has to have a picture documenting it, and if you wander around a shopping mall you’ll see young people everywhere posing for the ‘gram. So by looking sharp for some pictures and answering some questions, I was doing a great job!\n\nBut that wasn’t the case. Vik was happy I brought my blazer, and asked me to wear it to most visits we made, but he asked if I had a proper suit. I told him maybe next time.\n\nA few days later as Vik and I were discussing the itinerary for the following week, he mentioned there would be a number of very important meetings. I told him I’d be sure to wear my blazer. He countered:\n\n“I’m going to buy you a suit.”\n\nVik is a generous man who wants to take care of his partners. He’s not hurting for money and almost everything in India costs a fraction of what it does here. And yet I was mortified. I tried to refuse, because I hate when people ever spend money on me, but also because I was ashamed that my associate was so disappointed in what I had to wear that he would go so far as to buy me a tailored suit. He insisted it was a gift he wanted to give and wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nThe city we were in – Vijayawada – is known primarily for rice, temples, extreme heat, and textiles, and Vik took us to one of the more well-known purveyors. A couple women helped us pick out fabric. Vik asked me what color and design I wanted and I was at a bit of a loss. I wanted an all black suit, but the black fabric selections were more charcoal, rather than the jet black the world’s most badass football managers wear on the touchline.\n\n“How about blue, like the one I have?” suggested Vik. “Or maybe gray?”\n\n“Sure, blue or gray might be good.”\n\nThe women set out several rolls of blue and gray fabric. I pretended to look at them closely, a little disappointed I wasn’t going to get to look like Diego Simeone or Roy Kent.\n\nThe younger woman set out dark blue roll with large but subtle checks. She said it would look really good. Vik was not so sure, and was eyeing up a couple of the gray ones. “But it is your choice. Any one you want – they’re all about the same price.” He told me later that the fabric came from one of the top clothiers in India. “If you say you got a Raymond suit in Vijaywada, people will know what that means.”\n\nWe narrowed it down to two of them – one of the grays and the blue one – and Vik told me to choose.\n\nI looked to the younger woman and asked, “Which one do you like?” and without hesitation she pointed at the blue one she had set out. I guess I don’t have to tell you which one I chose.\n\nI was already feeling a lot of emotions as we got in the car to head to the tailor. I was grateful and embarrassed by Vik’s generosity, and I was feeling pretty good about myself because of the way the young woman had said the suit would look good on me. The suit had not even been put together yet, and already you can see how the resulting effect of the suit would be to basically a) make more look more professional and b) look good for women.\n\nIt was getting into early evening, and the sweltering city was bustling as usual. The driver dropped us off by a side street. Vik had a particular tailor he liked, but couldn’t quite remember where he was located. In India, it’s common for alike businesses to cluster, so on a single block there might be several tailors. We walked past a number of them, and Vik asked for directions a couple different times.\n\nFinally, he stopped outside a super sketchy-looking alley of sorts between two buildings. “I think this is it,” he said. Then he pointed to a sign hanging from the second story of one of the buildings. “Yes! Here he is.”\n\nHe led me down the alley and into a narrow, winding stairwell with all sorts of spots and stains. “I remember the first time coming here I wondered ‘oh dear where have I gone to,'” said Vik.\n\nWe found the tailor and an assistant (or maybe just a friend who was hanging out?) in a small room cooled only by a fan and any breeze coming in the open windows. He glanced up now and then to see what was happening in the IPL (cricket) match on the small TV.\n\nA couple days later, we went back to the tailor to pick up the finished suit. It took us less time to find the sketchy alley (“Ah,” said Vik, “the filthy stairs. We are certainly in the right place.”). I tried on the suit and…and I instantly felt incredible.\n\nIt was the highest quality, best tailored suit I had ever put on. And it was mine.\n\nVik approved and we headed out. I overthanked him and told him I’d be sure to wear it at our important meetings coming up in Indore and Hyderabad, many of them meetings with new potential partners. “First impressions do count,” I said.\n\n“Why do you think I got you this?” said Vik.\n\nI laughed at the time (Vik is very funny), and I still was overwhelmed by his generosity, but it reinforced for me the main point why I was given this suit: my clothes were insufficient for my work. And it doesn’t really take most of us long to feel like if our clothes are insufficient that we’re insufficient.\n\nStill, I felt pretty awesome in my new suit, and I wasted no time in sending out pictures of me in it. The affirmative reviews made me feel that much more awesome.\n\nI wore the suit the rest of the week as I took many more meetings with Vik and his delightful associate Soum. It absorbed several liters of my sweat and thankfully did not smell by the end of the week.\n\nAnd I felt…well, great. My trip was exhausting, but it was very fruitful and mostly enjoyable and I could feel how much I had grown up in the last few years of my life – certainly since the time I wore that oversized gray suit to my sister’s wedding. I felt confident and accomplished.\n\nI thought at first I would write about how those two suits – the one for the wedding and the one for this trip – symbolized my maturation from an awkward boy turning 20 to a more confident and capable man of 30. But in the last few weeks, my feelings on the suit have started to change.\n\nFor one, I still think suits suck. They are still uncomfortable and hot and sweaty and high maintenance. I’m in no rush to make wearing one a regular thing.\n\nTwo, I still don’t have a suitcase mentality when it comes to work. My role has changed in some significant ways with these trips to India, and I’m embracing that, but the fact is when I’m going to business meetings and making sales pitches and being interviewed by Telugu news outlets, I don’t really feel like myself. I like this job, and foresee myself doing it for a while, but someday I want my work to be more closely associated with my identity again. And in no scenario does that involve me wearing a suit to work every day.\n\nThree, I don’t like that a suit has the potential to so affect the way people see me. As someone who is not confident in their appearance, eschews most masculine stereotypes, and generally lacks professional ambition, it is a little uncomfortable to put on a costume that symbolizes all that I discussed above. It is uncomfortable to get praise for wearing a costume I don’t want to be wearing in the first place, especially when the things I’m being praised for aren’t things I want to rely on. Plus, as someone who checks just about all the privilege boxes, I don’t like that an object gifted to me acts to further those privileges.\n\nAnd four…the suit stifles my own chosen methods of self-expression. Like I mentioned above, it does not allow me to really make my own fashion choices, but it also covers up all of my tattoos. My tattoos are really important to me. I have a lot and am going to get more and I want people to be able to see them. They make me feel confident and say something about me that is unique. The suit hides them. Sure, so does anything I wear with long pants and long sleeves, but after a recent incident at a box office where I was offered the student (high school student) rate, I’ve seriously considered getting hand tattoos so that even in jeans and a sweater I can signal I’m not a damn teenager. But now, if a suit is something I’m going to be wearing more often, I don’t know that hand tattoos are an option anymore. Most people in suits with hand tattoos are David Beckham or a bad guy in a John Wick movie. I’m obviously not either of those, but maybe there is the risk that even “SOLA FIDE” across my knuckles would detract from the professionalism evinced by the suit.\n\nMaybe my feelings about this suit are also affected by my feelings about the other suit I got in India.\n\nWhile in Vijayawada, Vik offered to take me on a Sunday morning to major Hindu temple, the Kanaka Durga. I asked him if that was okay since I’m a practicing Christian, and he said it was perfectly fine (almost all Hindu temples are open to all faiths).\n\n“But you will need to wear something different. Did you bring anything besides t-shirts?”\n\nI object to classifying polos as t-shirts but fair enough, Vik.\n\nVik took me to another clothier where we could buy some traditional Indian “ethnic” garb. I insisted on paying this time. Clothing and apparel is often what I like to get as a souvenir anyway.\n\nVik helped me pick out two sets. One was a kurta for everyday wear (“You could wear it if you ever go to an Indian event in America”). A long-sleeved-collarless tunic with buttons at the top, and a light and loose pair of white trousers. The other set was for formal occasions and was what I would wear to the temple (“You could marry a nice Indian girl in this”). The top was similar but in purple. The pants were a dhoti, billowing and white in a sort of cross between trousers and a skirt. The outfit was completed with a long white and gold stole.\n\nIt was unlike anything I’d put on before, and I felt some of those feelings any of us get when we wear a type of garment for the first time, with the added pressure of not wanting to get it dirty in the dressing room. I looked at myself in the mirror and shrugged because I thought it looked nice but I didn’t know if it looked the way it was supposed to. I stepped out of the dressing room, and instantly Vik, Hari (the driver), and a man I’ll call Mo all lit up. Vik tends to have a neutral expression in our many pics, but in the one we took with me wearing my dhoti he is beaming.\n\nThe reaction I got wearing the dhoti was much like the ones I got any time that I did something “Indian.” It would start with a smile that I would try any food they put in front of me, happily-raised eyebrows when I voluntarily ate with my hands, and then a big smile when I expressed how much I enjoyed what I was eating. So too when I would ask a good question about the culture, or when I didn’t hesitate to get in a tuk-tuk, or when I greeted someone with “namaste.”\n\nThey also insisted I looked awesome in it, too. “You are looking like…superhero,” said Hari. I couldn’t help but text out pics of me in this, too.\n\nOn paper, maybe it seems like the effects of the Western suit and the kurta/dhoti are fairly similar. Both are special/formal attire that cover up my tattoos while earning me respect and admiration. Though the dhoti is more comfortable, it is not practical, and I nearly tripped over it several times.\n\nBut I felt very different wearing them. In the suit, I give up parts of me in order to exalt myself. In the dhoti, I give up parts of myself to humble myself. The suit says “You’re lucky I’m here.” The dhoti says “I’m lucky to be here.”\n\nMaybe that’s not the effect for an Indian wearing it, but for me it was a way to signal to those around me that I was treating their culture seriously and with care.\n\nI went to the temple the next morning with Vik, his wife, and another one of our associates and his wife, all of us in our temple best. I was properly attired besides my shoes – I came to India without sandals or slides but you can be sure I didn’t leave without any because when your shoes come on and off as much as they do in India, it’s a real pain to have to sit or hunch over every time. After removing our shoes, we washed our feet and proceed to the gate, tall and colorful and bright in the hot morning sun.\n\nIt was fairly busy but not uncommonly so, and most who we met were dressed similarly. Some had shaved their heads, too.\n\nWe entered the temple and approached the deity. Depending on the time, day, and temple, supplicants may spend hours or even days waiting to catch a glimpse of the deity (here it was Durga, a powerful goddess), at which time they will say a short prayer – less than 30 seconds! – before moving on. I was moved by this dedication, this commitment to ritual and procedure. I was also conflicted, too, as someone whose religion teaches there are no longer any holier, more effective, more powerful places to pray. I certainly believe God is everywhere – even inside us – but could the physical spaces we’re in help us to pray the right way? In making it possible to physically approach God, are Hindus somewhat paradoxically making God more distant? It also made me think again about how I wish Protestants had more rituals and constructed spaces that made much of the beauty and grandeur of God, as Catholics do.\n\nAfter leaving the inner sanctum, our small group was allowed to gather before some priests who would confer a special blessing. They sprinkled dry rice on top of our heads, gave us small boxes of sweets and a stole, and then sang and chanted a blessing in unison.\n\nI felt something in that moment. Yes, I was running on empty in the heat of the day, in a country where I don’t speak the language (yet), overstimulated at all times, so any little thing might have set me off, but what I felt was what I can only describe as a mystical experience. These don’t always have an explicit connection to religion – I’ve had them watching Everton and embracing my friends and dancing at concerts and looking at art and [redacted because my grandma reads this]. I felt it sitting there in the temple with these men singing at me. It was brief, but I felt it.\n\nThe priests gestured towards me and said something to Vik. He turned to me and smiled.\n\n“You have made them very happy wearing that today.”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo now here I am, home with these suits. The Western one is still sitting in the garment bag, and I really hope it dried out in the last hotel otherwise it’s gonna be gross when I take it to the drycleaner (but first I have to figure out how to do that). I don’t know when I’ll wear it again outside of future business meetings in India. Maybe not until the next wedding I go to dateless.\n\nThe dhoti will remain unworn until then, too. I will bring it next time I go to India, as I am hoping to visit more sacred places, in particular the Tirupati Balaji temple between Vijayawada and Chennai.\n\nBut perhaps I will wear the kurta much sooner. I’m working up the courage and humility visit the gurdwara just south of Milwaukee, and it would be just the thing to wear along with a head covering of some sort. It has occurred to me that perhaps a lone white man in western garb might cause some alarm or at least discomfort after what happened there in 2012. Yes, the kurta will somewhat suppress aspects of my individuality. It will signal that I am a reverential person taking the space seriously. As a non-South Asian Christian it will be in some way like putting on a costume. Maybe I will even look handsome in it.\n\nBut while a suit is a walking handshake, a firm hand extended in a greeting that means business, maybe the kurta will be received more like steepled hands and a slight nod. Maybe before I am ever able to speak aloud in greeting it will say, “Namaste: The sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you.”\n\nAnd maybe, if only for a few moments, I will be more concerned with the Holiness within and less concerned with the decaying temple built around it.\n\nForth now, and fear no darkness (Namárië, Bernard Hill).\n\nSoli Deo Gloria\n\nPeter\n\n“Now let us take our ease here for a little!” said Aragorn. “We will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.” He wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.\n\n“Look!” said Pippin. “Strider the Ranger has come back!”\n\n“He has never been away,” said Aragorn. “I am Strider and Dúnadan too, and I belong both to Gondor and the North.”\n\n–The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, “Flotsam and Jetsam”\n\nIs real life actually happening all the time? And can you be the same person through all of it?\n\nI wondered these things, weaving in and out of the noise and lights of a Bengaluru night, sitting very close in a tuk-tuk with people I met just days earlier. We were various levels of buzzed and tipsy, having drank and ate and danced at a Shakespeare-themed brew pub for several hours before heading back to the fancy hotel where we’d get some sleep before enjoying our one real day off on a hectic work trip.\n\nOne of my new friends held a phone out the side of the carriage and snapped a selfie.\n\n“Hey, you guys,” said another new friend, one of the Indian members of our cohort, “I am having a FOMO.”\n\nHe turned from his perch on the small front seat next to the driver. “Because I want in on this selfie too!” He whipped out his own phone and snapped a selfie of all four of us, our smiles much wider than the spaces our driver slid through between buses and Suzukis and Pulsars.\n\nBengaluru was about the midway point of my time in India doing recruitment and network-building as part of my job in university admissions: 3 weeks, 7 cities, 30 schools, 4,000 students. A blur of hotels, phenomenal food, introductions, goodbyes, insane traffic, and so, so many people. So much newness and so much learning.\n\nFrom the time I said “sure, yeah, I’ll go” back in September, the trip was a pretty major source of, or at least nexus for, my anxieties, and I thought of it as being three weeks where I would basically put my life on hold. Of course, as usual, and thank God, the anticipation ended up being the worst part, and it was a great trip. But still I asked myself as I flitted from school to school and city to city if it was all real life and if the person living it was really…well, me.\n\nIt’s important to note: while my characteristic use of big words and references to this and that might make it seem like I’m being didactic, this is really me humbly grappling with my own messed up way of processing human thought and emotions. I’m not pretending I’m onto something new, and I don’t know if I have any wisdom to impart. But at the very least, writing this will help me sort out my own soul, and maybe in doing so something, even one thing, will resonate with you. And on a very practical level I’ll get to tell you more about my trip and also foist my artistic sensibilities on you hehe.\n\nSo what do I do in “real life”? Well, I work a job in admissions where I process applications and evaluate transcripts and send a lot of emails. I do this job so I can provide myself and my best friend who is a cat with food and shelter and a couple streaming services. I work out just about every day. I hang out with my friends, being extra with costume parties and themed dinners and big chilling with video games and movies and…mood enhancers. I’m in the revision stage of my next novel (coming this year) and have actually started writing a sequel to [redacted] coming maybe 2026? I go to church less than I should and small group as much as I can. I play DND. Oh yeah and I invest in things that cause me pain like Everton Football Club, Christianity, the DNC, and dating apps.\n\nThat’s me. That’s what I “do,” that’s my life. And for the first time, I could see myself doing more or less the same things five and ten years down the line (of course it won’t go that way but we’re pretending it will).\n\nYou can see why three weeks on the other side of the world with absolutely no one I know doing things I’ve never done before would feel removed from my “real” life. This dissociation was compounded by two things: while most/all of the other counselors make trips like this regularly and work mostly/exclusively with international students (or were Indian themselves), international admissions is only part of my job and international travel is a small and new part of my role; and my experience of India was such a limited, privileged exploration of the country.\n\nThe first point: This is not what I do for work. It’s very possible it will become a bigger, more regular part of my job, but for now it felt more like an international admissions ride-along. Everyone else on the tour had so much more international experience than me, and they all know they will have more experiences like this in the future. Many of them have cultivated world traveling as part of their identity, and while I have been to three different countries in the last 9 months, and intend to do more world traveling, I haven’t yet gotten to the point where I have made this a part of me.\n\nThe second: Yes, I experienced and learned so much. I went so many places, met so many people, tried so many foods…but I also stayed in four and five star hotels, had professional drivers and valets, stayed mostly in metropolitan areas, and visited top schools. I experienced India, but only a small and convenient piece of it. Very few people ever get to do what I did, and I myself might only get to do something similar a few more times in my life – if at all.\n\nSo I wondered, as I flew literally and figuratively around Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, and Hyderabad, if this was my actual life or a just a very long, very stimulating side quest, a spinoff just barely related to the original.\n\nAnd, I wondered, is this really me doing all this? When I finally made it home through an absurdist odyssey with a shambolic airline, did I leave some piece of me there in South Asia? Did the intimacies I shared or the impressions I made with new friends and acquaintances count if I never see those people again? If all I said and did over there only comes out here in response to “How was India?”, is that the box it forever sits in?\n\nObviously this is real life and you’re the one living it, you might say – and so might I. But, for me at least, knowing this is different from really believing this. About a year and a half ago I wrote about something similar in the wake of my grandfather’s death, and I expect a year and half hence I’ll write about this again. India was the latest opportunity for me to explore these ideas and hopefully come closer to mastering them.\n\nAs you may know already or could have guessed reading my description of my life, I don’t see myself as a serious man who commands respect. It’s my personality, too. I don’t really know how to receive compliments and I downplay my accomplishments (you will NEVER find “M.A.” in my email signature). I constantly have to correct people that I’m a self-published author and that is not such a special accomplishment.\n\nSo it was wild in India to suddenly be seen as a valued guest, a distinguished gentleman, a powerful associate. The service industry in India runs mandalas around that in America, and you can’t take a step in a hotel – especially the more luxurious ones – without someone begging to carry your bag or open your door or get you a masala chai (praise be). This is disorienting for someone who can barely afford to stay in any hotel, let alone a Marriott or ITC. “Oh no, you have mistaken me for the CEO wunderkind of some tech startup. I’m just here because my boss asked me to be.”\n\nSimilarly, the schools we visited were all so welcoming and hospitable, giving us food and more (awesome) tea and (passable) coffee, often giving us gifts. Before I presented at a school in Vizag, when I was on the solo leg of my trip, I was introduced by a student who read my accomplishments (lol) and even read my quippy bio on my LinkedIn as if it was a line from the Mahatma. I was flustered. “No, see, I’m just here to tell you about my university and will be presenting approximately none of my own original insights.”\n\nEveryone at the agency I toured with continued to treat me with such respect and generosity. I sat with the man himself on a Radisson balcony overlooking the Bay of Bengal late in the evening, drinking whisky and eating prawns, and had an out of body experience like “what is going on this is some Don Draper shit am I an actual grown man oh no I have no wish to be a grown man.”\n\nI am also, it should not surprise you, exceedingly deferential and polite. Unfortunately, you cannot physically move through the nation of India without being assertive and at times exhibiting behavior that in America would get you called a nasty name. Indian people aren’t jerks; it’s just a necessity in a country of billions of people where everyone is go-go-go that you might have to tell someone to get out of your way.\n\nOne way to look at these moments of strained identity is as growth opportunities. And that’s true! Maybe if people treat you well you should tell yourself you deserve it. Maybe you have the right to be a little more assertive and advance your interests, even in something so trivial as getting boarded on an airplane or crossing the street.\n\nBut there is also the possibility in situations like this of fracturing our identity, of becoming too externally responsive and motivated. Seeing yourself as others see you can cloud your own understanding of yourself, and make you believe you are either much “better” or much worse than you really are. BIPOC Americans have been contending with this for hundreds of years (see DuBois on double consciousness, for starters), and my rather benign experiences of it make that much more evident to me the effects of this discursive violence.\n\nSituations like this, if not well-managed, can also lead to undue code switching. We all code switch, and thank goodness, but constant and extreme code switching is exhausting at best and self-destructive at worst, especially if the codes we adhere to are in direct opposition to our inner being. Again, this is an everyday challenge for minority populations that people like me are often blind to.\n\nThere are plenty of times outside of India that I feel these tensions, but the trip was an intense, compressed experience of it. If what happens in India stays in India, then I could just write it off and move on. But as we’ve established, those weeks in India are my real life, and I am the one who lived it. So what does someone like me need to bear in mind when presented with these situations – how can I learn and grow from these situations, so that in the future – whether in a fever dream of newness or in the mundanity of daily life – I can not just keep my head above water but cut through the swells?\n\nI’d point to a few different sources for guidance and inspiration. I’ll start with Takuan Sōhō’s The Unfettered Mind. Sōhō was a Japanese Zen Buddhist philosopher, living and writing in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Unfettered Mind is his treatise applying Zen Buddhism to martial arts. One of the key teachings – and the one that has been most helpful to me in dealing with anxiety and OCD – is to flow through the places where the mind stops, what Sōhō calls the “abiding place.” It “signifies stopping, and stopping means the mind is being detained by some matter, which may be any matter at all.” When in combat (most often he is using the way of the sword for his examples), it is essential to act freely and unencumbered by thoughts, reacting and acting in fluid motions. Constant stopping for thought is a good way to be killed. So too in our minds; constantly stopping to think about everything can be our undoing (trust me).\n\nThe idea of this flow state can be found in many philosophies. It reminds me of my rudimentary understanding of chakras. If our chakras – pools of energy – are blocked up with the gunk of life – fear, self-doubt, guilt, grief, etc. – our energy cannot flow, and we become spiritually constipated.\n\nThat said, those pools are in need of some examination, which is only possible when the water is clean and calm. Consider my favorite of the Proverbs in the Bible, 20.5: “The purpose of a man’s heart is like pools of deep water, but the man of understanding will draw it out.”\n\nThese illustrations from Buddhism, Hinduism/Buddhism, and Judaism/Christianity suggest that we must let our energy, our thoughts, our lives flow, and that when these things flow we become better equipped to do the necessary work of deep self-examination and contemplation. We cannot step into every new setting and be consumed with thoughts of “how am I to act?” and “what are people thinking of me?” and “what does this mean for my life?”\n\nInstead of scrutinizing every single situation, we can let our fluid way of being guide us, just as a samurai must react fluidly to their opponent’s strike instead of stopping in the abiding place. As a Christian, this calls to mind passages like Micah 6.8: “He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.” We walk figuratively every day, and there is a posture to take when doing so that will prepare us for whatever might come.\n\nBut what about when we extrapolate this to a bigger picture of life? Is walking well as simple as one well-measured step after the other on and on until we die? Depending on how you use that metaphor, sure, maybe it is. But I also think sometimes we need to look up and take stock of where we are. At the risk of too many metaphors, in life’s storms we need to have firm anchors of the soul and maintain a steady course, but I think we also need to be able to see those storms as key moments in our lives that invite us to reconsider some things and possibly make some tough choices and – as a result – changes.\n\nOne of the most damaging decisions I’ve made in my life was to hold out hope for a certain relationship to develop over the course of many years (and that is as specific as I will ever be about that). But I don’t believe what I did in the macro was wrong. The mistake I made was letting that dream cloud my perception of so many other things, ranging from my own self-worth to my investment in the actual relationships I had. I do not think I was wrong to sacrifice parts of myself and my life for this thing, but I know the way I did it was – ultimately – destructive for me and for others.\n\nThere’s a larger discussion to be had about codependency, but this is not the time. Simply put, I believe with all my heart that we are built with the ability – the gift – to sacrifice ourselves, to give ourselves to causes, to dreams, and, yes, to people.\n\nMaybe it’s silly, but at times in the situation I’m referring to, I thought of myself as Aragorn who spent decades of his life facing many (often lonely) trials in the hopes one day he and Arwen would have Elrond’s blessing to wed. But, even though Aragorn is also an INFJ, I was not being like Aragorn, who at all times and in all places was the same man, applying himself in the same way to the task at hand, and those tasks were various and sundry to say the least! Yes, he did have in mind through it all that one day he would press his claim to the throne of Gondor and marry Arwen, but that didn’t cloud his understanding of who he was wherever in Middle-Earth his errantry took him.\n\nDespite my poor imitation of Aragorn, I can see other examples in Tolkien of characters exhibiting this ability to commit to an overarching goal while remaining present and in a flow state day by day, so much so that it’s worth noting as one of the many themes the legendarium explores. Consider Olórin, whose overall purpose incarnated as Gandalf is to defeat Sauron (only the biggest bad left in Middle-Earth), but yet he still takes the time to learn all he can about the seemingly inconsequential hobbits. He has a different name everywhere he goes, and each people group has their idea of who he is and what he’s supposed to do, but no matter how he might adjust his behavior he stays true to who he is and his purpose (the only of the Istari to do so).\n\nOne more text to examine: I’ve seen the one season of Blue Eye Samurai four times now, and I will probably watch it another handful of times before the second season comes out (hopefully that’s not too long!). It’s one of my most favorite things I’ve ever watched, and I spend a lot of time thinking about it, always finding something new to ponder. I’ve also tried to figure out why it is that the show connects so personally with me. Yes, I love it because it is beautiful and really really kicks ass, but I also connect with it on a level that makes it not just entertaining but meaningful.\n\nMizu is, from beginning to end, focused on her mission: find and destroy the four wicked white men she has sworn to kill, taking vengeance on them for the act that brought Mizu into the world as a monster in the eyes of the Japanese with “pure” blood. She learns along the way that she has become too consumed with the fire of revenge to be effective in her quest. But the problem is not that she has committed her life to the sword and to revenge, it’s that in doing so she has closed herself off to anything but the pure fire of hate and violence, the onryo, the demon. In her conversation with her adoptive father, the swordsmith Eiji (possibly the best scene of the season), Eiji does not tell her that her chosen craft (violence) and mission (revenge) are wrong. Instead, he tells her the way she is pursuing them is wrong. She is not pursuing them like an artist, which is what he taught her to be. “An artist gives all they have to their art – the whole. Your strengths and deficiencies, your loves and your shame. Perhaps the people you collected. Maybe there is a demon in you, but there is also more. If you do not invite the whole, the demon takes two chairs, and your art will suffer” (ugh i love this scene and this show so much).\n\nThough he objects initially to Mizu’s quest, by this point he no longer condemns it, and is even ready to help her forge a new sword. Mizu’s big picture decision to dedicate her life to this seemingly impossible task is her decision to make, and neither Eiji nor Ringo will condemn her for it despite what it demands of her. Her error was in allowing the demon to consume her art. She and her new sword will be reborn in fire, a mix of pure and impure steel as all the best blades are. Her life won’t be all about the end goal of vengeance; it will also be about the people and places that quest takes her to along the way.\n\nLiving mindfully while also able to make the complicated, introspective choices is really hard, even with examples both real and fictional, practical and philosophical to learn from. It is an exercise in many spiritual disciplines, one of the most elusive being constancy. It’s here again I turn to Christianity (though examples of constancy can be found elsewhere shoutout Taoism). A central belief is that God is eternal and constant in all three persons of the Trinity. Different Christians will interpret this differently and find their own ways to reconcile the apparent inconsistencies and mysteries regarding the character of God. But the point is that we almost all agree that – in stark contrast to the Greek/Roman gods and many other belief systems – the Christian God is not temperamental and inconsistent. God is who God says God is. God does what God says God will do. What a rock that is to stand on. As we’re battered about by the waves, as we struggle to be who we say or think we are or do what we say we’ll do, there is a God who is constant through everything.\n\nOf course, the character and nature of God can be a little abstract, a little out there. So let me return to India for one final concrete example.\n\nMy favorite cultural experience of the trip was a visit to a Sikh temple in Bengaluru. One of our valets was a Sikh, and on the bus ride there he told us about his religion, about which I knew very little. It’s a fascinating religion with a fascinating history, but the main point according to our valet was that Sikhs live to help other people and serve their community – that is their primary act of worship. Our valet has made a career out of helping people, keeping them safe and comfortable as they travel in India and other countries, working tirelessly to keep everyone’s ducks in a row.\n\nOne of the ways Sikh community service plays is out is in the physical spaces of the temples. Sikh temples provide shelter, food, and comfort for anyone who comes through their doors.\n\nThere were a few rules about the temple: head coverings must be worn; shoes must be removed; no photography inside. All three gave the space a feeling of sacredness, though I wish I could have more pictures to share of the beautiful white building and the understated elegance of the shrine.\n\nAfter a brief stop in the shrine (think church sanctuary), where we sat with a few dozen Sikhs in prayer and meditation in the presence of their holy text and traditional music, we went to the serving hall, where an entirely volunteer team prepared and served a large delicious meal to scores of visitors (I did not partake. It would have been rude not to clean the plate, and given my GI sensitivity I didn’t want to literally bite off more than I could chew).\n\nIt was so moving to be in a sacred space where people pursued not just their own spiritual betterment but the material, physical wellbeing of their neighbors. It was convicting for me as a Christian, because I wish more – no, all – Christian churches were like that. And it put into a whole new horrifying perspective the atrocity committed at the temple in Oak Creek (a 20 minute drive south of Milwaukee) in 2012. I hope to visit there soon.\n\nSikhs are a minority wherever they go – just 1% of the population of India, where they are most concentrated. They take all kinds of different jobs living all different kinds of places. But they carry with them everywhere the mission to help their neighbor and serve the community. Hundreds of years ago, that meant going to war with the invading Mughals.\n\nToday, it might mean helping a nervous American get his luggage from one city to the next as he has an existential crisis of sorts thousands of miles from home.\n\nForth now, and fear no darkness.\n\nSoli Deo Gloria\n\n-Peter\n\nSome thoughts on the creations and creators of 2023.\n\nBeing an artist is scary.\n\nYeah, I’m an artist. I’m only just getting comfortable calling myself that and it’s been beautiful to embrace it. You might disagree, but probably not if you’re reading this.\n\nThere is much in the artistic process that is scary, no matter which of the myriad mediums you favor, and no matter how much of the art you’re creating versus recreating (a songwriter versus the instrumentalist). But one of the scariest parts is asking people to care.\n\nThe vast majority of artists ply their craft as a hobby, often paying rather than being paid to produce it, and many will not ever share their art with a wide audience. We make art because we love it, because it demands to come out, because holding it in would be a tragedy.\n\nBut almost all artists will, at some point, try sharing their work. We work for hours and hours on something, finally satisfied (mostly) with what we’ve come up with, and then we have the audacity to be such a great bother and ask other people to take the time, energy, and (maybe) money to experience it.\n\nImagine giving a final presentation to a class – one of the more nerve-wracking things almost everyone goes through. Only what you’re presenting on is something immensely important to you (you dork). And actually it was not even required – you spent your time and energy on it just because you were interested in it (you try-hard). And your classmates? They weren’t required to show up. You asked them to come in on a Saturday (you presumptuous jerk). And, actually, there are literally thousands of other people already presenting on a similar topic, but you thought you were smart enough to try your hand anyway (you pretentious asshole).\n\nThat’s what asking people to care about your art feels like.\n\nOh, and just like a letter grade in school, you might actually have a very, very concrete idea of how your art is received. Views, streams, purchases. So, yeah, every kind word makes you feel over the moon, but at the end of the day you can still pull up your Amazon reports and see you’ve sold 40 copies of your book. As a former instructor I can tell you feedback is more important than grades, but a C+ is still really hard to take when you tried for an A.\n\nThis is – of course – intensely personal to me, but this anxiety is one of the key themes of 2023, not just for me in my own artistic journey but for all of us in contemporary culture. It’s what the best film of the year is about and it makes its way into some of the best television and literature, too.\n\nYou’ve seen, The Office, right? Of course you have. S3:E17, “Business School,” is one of my favorite episodes, and probably one of the most memorable. Yes, it’s the one where there is a bat in the office, which Dwight captures, all while being “pranked” by Jim that Jim has *checks notes* turned into a literal vampire. But that’s not what the episode is about. It’s about the convergence of the other two storylines: Michael’s insecurity as a boss who is focused on people and is both unskilled and uninterested when it comes to spreadsheets, market projections, and business analytics; and Pam’s insecurity as an artist asking her friends and coworkers to come see her work in a small art show. If you haven’t seen the episode, the show is an unmitigated disappointment for Pam until Michael appears at the last minute.\n\nIt’s a beautiful scene, really showcasing the heart of the writer’s room and the immense talents of Carrell and Fischer. I love it so much I even based a scene off it in that novel that only sold 40 copies.\n\nBecause Michael is the central character of the show and Carrell is one of the most endearing actors to ever walk the Earth, this scene might be remembered primarily for what Michael does. In fact, the title of the video above puts the focus on just that: “Michael Brings Pam to Tears at Her Art Show.”\n\nBut his kind gesture and kind words in this scene do not tell the full story. It’s really just the emotional payoff of what the episode had set up to that point. Pam has spent the episode asking people to come to her show and has gotten so many disappointing responses, and then at the show she has waited and waited and been disappointed again. Almost none of her coworkers and friends show up (including Jim! Super bad look, Jim!) and those who do are there for the wrong reasons. I’m sure Pam’s storyline moves anyone who watches, but if you are an artist this hits especially close to home.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael has had his world flipped upside down by Ryan, who has set him up to be embarrassed in front of a class at business school. The crux of Michael’s embarrassment is that he is uninterested and unschooled in most aspects of business. He’s a genius salesperson who got promoted to the point of incompetence, but what made him a great salesperson is also what makes him a – in his own way – successful boss. He cares about people. He loves people. “A good manager doesn’t fire people. He hires people and inspires people. People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.”\n\nSometimes, the different storylines in a given episode of The Office fit together to support a common theme, and this is one of those times (minus the bat storyline). Because, more and more, people are going out of business. The world is becoming more automated, more artificial, more fleeting. And as everything becomes streamlined and optimized to maximize profits and justify existence in late-stage capitalist systems, there seems to be very little room for art, whether it is Pam’s water color paints or Michael’s personalized human touch.\n\nMike Schur, one of the last sensible human beings on Earth, is one of the creators of The Office, and was also one of the chief leaders in the recent WGA/SAGAFTRA strike. It’s easy to see the connection here (though Schur is not the primary writer of “Business School”). Perhaps the most important point in that strike was protecting writers against artificial intelligence. In short, the writers wanted protection against computer systems taking their jobs. We may still be a hundred years from ChatGPT being able to write a good television series, but when Love Island and The Bachelor are two of the most popular franchises in the world, I think we know people will settle for shows that are less than good (I get the appeal, guys, but you all know it’s a great big fucking waste of time).\n\nIt’s a horrifying existential crisis for artists. What if our creativity can be replaced by a computer who will do the work faster and for free? And, in some ways, the computer might do the job “better” – that’s why we have computers do all kinds of things, like call balls and strikes (oh, wait lol). If in 20 years ChatGPT can write an emotionally-gripping novel about sad men and resilient women and spiritual crisis, what am I even working towards?\n\nOne way for creativity to survive is to embrace the machine and dive headlong into a world of speed and optimization. Technology has given artists the means to become an overnight sensation on platforms like TikTok. Through some combination of compelling presentation and algorithmic compatibility, your song, poem, recipe, dance, or painting is just hours away from becoming a global sensation viewed by millions.\n\nThat sounds a lot easier than trying to get an agent to represent you. All you have to do is optimize your art to capture attention in less than three seconds (three seconds is basically the point where viewers continue to watch or continue to scroll. Three. Seconds). And it really better stand out, because if the average time spent on TikTok per day is about 90 minutes (I’m not making that up), that’s enough time to watch 1,800 videos 3 seconds at a time.\n\nThere are three disturbing trends here. The first is the reworking of our brains to consume things 3 seconds at a time. We’re supposed to use that kind of quick-thinking part of our brain to do things like keep us safe from harm (that car is changing lanes! my child is about to touch the stove!) or move efficiently through mundane tasks. It’s not meant to be used for anything related to pleasure and gratification. How does three seconds of sex sound? Three seconds of you favorite meal? Three seconds of good conversation? We don’t consume anything like we consume social media. We are creatures who are built to be able to engage for lengths of time with sensory experiences.\n\nThe second is that the creation no longer has to be any good. It just has to be momentarily stimulating. I saw a Reel yesterday (which I assume was a TikTok first) of a guy crushing a golf ball with his driver, and his buddy just feet in front of him catching it in his hand. Impressive. Watch a little closer and clearly – clearly – you can see the golf ball whizz past him and a second golf ball in the buddy’s hand. They barely tried. Doesn’t matter – 20 million views. And I’m sure we’ve all found that if you’re hot and create a video of you doing just about anything – no matter how lame the dance is or unfunny the joke is – you’ll get a few hundred thousand likes. We’re tolerating bad creativity because we’re consuming literally thousands of things per day. Oh well if some of it’s bad – you just move on!\n\nAnd the third is that, in a sick inversion of Michael’s belief that “people will never go out of business,” the product is not the art at all. The product is us.\n\nThe thing being mass-produced and sold on social media is not the creativity, not the art. Those are just ploys to keep us around and surveys to find out what we’re into. We are the product. What resource could there be more inexhaustible than human attention? Not human focus, not human retention, just attention. Just minutes spent staring. The music and the jokes and the hotties and the genuinely beautiful and interesting things that all make up our feeds serve one purpose, and that is to make other people wealthier and more powerful. The machine may seem benevolent, sorting through millions of pieces of content to find the ones you are most likely to enjoy, but this is all part of you telling the machine how you are best sold to, how you are most easily captivated.\n\nCreators who shape their art and its presentation to succeed on social media might just make it big. But they may also be working to appease a machine that does. not. give. a. fuck.\n\nI should disclaim that I am not above all this. I still spend time scrolling through Reels. I’m on Facebook because I don’t know how else to share my writing. I’m not judging you if you spend time on TikTok everyday. But I really think our lives would be better if TikTok would go away.\n\nSo what’s an artist to do when the economy of attention (not to mention just, like, the actual economy) plays so heavily into the creation, distribution, and consumption of art? It’s a tough question, and one that is explored in such compelling fashion by Gabrielle Zevin in her novel, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. It was actually released in 2022 (and was on many best books lists), but books tend to have a slower burn and longer tail; many people – me included – read it this year.\n\nZevin explores many topics and themes (too many, imo, one of my few nits to pick) in the novel, and one which it keeps running into is the conflict between art as passion project and art as business entity. It’s a familiar story: artists originally make art out of supposedly pure intentions, and then when the art takes off they adapt to be able to maximize sales, and then they reckon with how this changes the art and changes them as people. But, among Zevin’s updates is the medium of art – video games. The video game is one of our newest art forms, and one that is especially influenced by capitalist demands. There will be a new Grand Theft Auto game in the next couple years. Why? Because it’s going to make a gazillion dollars. In some ways, GTA is the poster child for the lowest form of modern gaming. A violent, morally bankrupt game, coming out with new versions every few years to capitalize on pre-existing interest, rather than expanding any sort of storytelling (the more prolific example would be Call of Duty).\n\nHowever, most of the individuals working on a game like GTA are doing so because they love the art, and if I had to guess, most would rather be working on something more obviously artistic like The Last of Us franchise if they could.\n\nIt’s not a zero sum game; artists are not asked to choose passion or profits. But it is a balance that every artist will at some point have to make if they are ever so fortunate enough to turn their art into a source of income.\n\nI’ve risked losing the thread in the above paragraphs – which I understand are very gloom-and-doom and Marxist – because it is not possible to understand art and artists in 2023 without reckoning with the conditions of the earth we till. This is the world we live in, the world we create in. The platinum-certified artist and the soprano in school choir are both affected by these circumstances.\n\nSo let’s zoom in again to the artist and that very scary act of asking people to care.\n\nThis was a good year in film. For a few months this summer, it felt for the first time in several years that film really mattered, thanks to the Barbenheimer phenomenon (although that portmanteau is insulting to Barbie, which drew a significantly larger audience and had a much greater cultural impact than Oppenheimer). But then a Scorsese masterpiece bombed at the box office and and it feels like we’re back to square one.\n\nBut the best film of the year is not Barbie, or Oppenheimer, or Killers of the Flower Moon. It’s Showing Up, the latest film from Kelly Reichardt, one of the greatest living American filmmakers.\n\nShowing Up, starring a superb Michelle Williams (and featuring a number of other great performances), is about a sculptor preparing for an art show exhibiting her most recent collection. As usual with Reichardt, it’s not particularly plot-driven, but that isn’t to say there’s not a story, because Lizzy’s experience is the story of putting your heart, your time, your energy into something and then stepping back to see how it does out in the world.\n\nThis might seem like self-righteous insularity from Reichardt and from me. A film about art? Oh, really? That’s the best movie of the year? You might recall I picked Tár as my culturally-relevant film of 2022 and Mank as my culturally-relevant film of 2020. Here I go again, right?\n\nBut Showing Up is not so myopic. It’s actually very self-aware, jabbing at the arts/artists at several points through the film. But it is sincere, and it is sincerely about much more than visual arts. It’s about creation, cultivation, and care, no matter what it is we’re working with.\n\nIt’s such a brilliant move from Reichardt to make Lizzy’s medium clay sculptures. Clay takes a long time to work with. It requires a strong but steady hand. And then, when you’re ready, it gets a literal trial by fire, sometimes to devastating effect, as Lizzy finds when one of her sculptures is ruined in the kiln. It’s a long process and inexact science, especially when we could 3D print the same thing in a matter of hours. The result for Lizzy’s show is a number of sculptures of women in either joyful or agonized postures. The sculptures are not eye-catching, in the sense that if you walked past them in a shop window, you might not even notice them. They’re small, and, at first glance, somewhat crude. It can take time to study them, an open mind to be receptive of them. They are nuanced and subtle.\n\nThey’re the type of art that would make it so, so hard to ask people to come see your show. The kind of art that wouldn’t last three seconds on TikTok.\n\nBut again, it’s not really all about the sculptures. It’s about the wounded bird Lizzy begrudgingly takes care of, her friendship/rivalry with her landlord and fellow artist, Jo, her relationship with her parents and with her socially anxious brother.\n\nIsn’t life an art, really? Aren’t we all, in some way, artists? This is why “Business School” resonates with everyone – not just self-described artists, and it’s why Showing Up is for everyone, not just fans of A24 who are artists themselves. Of course, the film is also just brilliant. Performances, writing, cinematography, editing. Reichardt really is one of the greats, and I sincerely hope this film finally gets her an Oscar nomination, which she should have had for First Cow if not for one of her older films.\n\nBut there’s another sticking point here for artists and anyone else pursuing their purpose: what am I supposed to do next? And what if they don’t like it?\n\nWe find a response to this question in two other pieces of art from 2023.\n\nOne of the films I feel to be in contention for the film of the year is Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City. There is, near the end of the film, one of the best scenes Anderson has ever put together.\n\n“Do I just keep doing it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Without knowing anything?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Isn’t there supposed to be some kind of an answer out there about the meaning of life?”\n\n“Maybe there is one.”\n\n“Right, well that’s my question. I still don’t understand the play.”\n\n“Doesn’t matter. Just keep telling the story.”\n\nThis brought me to tears in the theater. But the scene isn’t done. Following this conversation, Augie has a conversation with another actor across the balconies behind their respective theaters. In the background, one of the other theaters advertises for The Death of a Narcissist. It’s not very subtle from Anderson, but it is poignant. In recent years, one of the popular opinions to have is that Wes Anderson movies are just parodies of other Wes Anderson movies, and that he’s lost his fastball. I agree to some extent – Isle of Dogs and The French Dispatch are two of his worst films. But here, Anderson bites back, telling us he’s not a narcissist, that he’s not just in love with his own genius, that he’s not just making films to win awards or sell tickets. “All my pictures turn out,” says Augie, and it may as well be Wes. He believes in the art. He’s doing the art he wants. So get off my back, he says, because do you have any idea how hard it is to make movies your way for three decades and continuously hope people will like it even as expectations grow for each subsequent project?\n\nIt is possible for an artist to get in and get out when they’re able to gain a certain amount of fame. One big contract, one big album, one big tour – it is possible to strike a hot iron and come away financially set for life. And, for some creators in some fields, the artistic life expectancy really isn’t very long. You just have to go viral a few times, gain some sort of following and then…well, you do something else. If you adapt to what the audience wants, maybe you can hold on a little longer, but if you stop appeasing them, you may go on in obscurity or stop altogether.\n\nBut for most artists, art is something they have to keep doing. They must always have the next song, the next sculpture, the next film, the next book. And in pursuing that next work of art, they will find over and over that they aren’t quite sure what to do next. They will doubt themselves, doubt their worth and capability. But they go on creating, and, scary as it is, they must continue to ask people to show up.\n\nAnd, again, this is for more than just conventional artists. Consider one of the best scenes from one of the best shows of the year, Blue Eye Samurai. Master Eiji, the swordsmith and adoptive father of Mizu, shares his wisdom on artistry, whether that art be making swords like him or using swords like Mizu (or helping people like Ringo): “An artist gives all they have to the art, the whole. Your strengths and deficiencies, your loves and your shames… Perhaps there is a demon in you, but there is more. If you do not invite the whole, the demon takes two chairs, and your art will suffer.”\n\n“Then what do I do?” asks Mizu.\n\n“I only know how to make swords. Each morning, I start a fire and begin again.”\n\nBlue Eye Samurai is fantastic for many reasons, and one of them is this attitude towards art. Watching it, you can feel just how much the art means to the artists who created it, how much care and attention went into it. It is authentic and sincere and full of pain and joy. Mizu is an artist of violence and death. It is what her life has been dedicated to, and she is better at it than just about anyone. But her art was imbalanced. It was so full of anger and hate, of lust for revenge, of singular-minded purpose. She had lost sight of what her art could and should be used for in a world where a skilled sword can shape the paths of nations. She needed to give of all herself – not just the demon of revenge – to unlock her full potential.\n\nThis is what artists and non-artists alike must do. We must continue to give all of ourselves to the things that matter to us. As the misattributed quote goes, “Whatever you are, be a good one.” In our culture, perhaps it has never been easier to be anything, but never more difficult to be the right thing.\n\nWhether people show up or not, we have to start a fire and begin. Again and again.\n\nSo! With the New Year comes Christmas, and in this New Year I hope to release another novel. I’m very, very excited (and scared) to share it with you. It is not about Christmas, but it begins around Christmas, and so I’m taking this opportunity to share a short excerpt from the second chapter that takes place following a Christmas Eve service. Happy Holidays, and thank you for showing up.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSilas wakes up on the Axe and Doritos couch. He checks his phone and sees he’s only been asleep for a few minutes. He’ll go home soon, after he’s had just a few more minutes to sit and let his thoughts run themselves out. Punch themselves out.\n\nAs he replays the service over in his mind, his thoughts continue to dwell on one particular space in time, about midway through the service, when they sang “Oh Holy Night.” Such a difficult song to sing – he considered removing it from the service. But sometimes when church folk take on too much they prove their best.\n\nThat particular hymn, or song, or carol, depending on who sings it, builds and builds in waves of melody and harmony and lyrical earnestness. The chorus – a refrain at the end of each verse with slightly different words each time – rises and swells in a way that is euphoric – orgasmic, even – in the way religious experience can sometimes be. And with each verse, the congregation grows in confidence as the melody reaches higher and higher and the harmony becomes deeper and richer.\n\nChrist is the Lord!\n\nO praise His name forever!\n\nHis power and glory evermore proclaim.\n\nHis power and glory evermore proclaim.\n\nThe congregants sang this as a true choir of the faithful masses. The piano rumbled in its accompaniment. Many sounds and one sound at once. And the voices of two, maybe three, women soared above the rest like stalwart ladies of our divine savior, their tones twinkling in the snow outside, glittering in the window dressings.\n\nThe Lord says the Lord is where two or three are gathered in their name. The Lord was certainly in those moments, in that room, in some mysterious and ancient way.\n\nIt was the first time since he started preaching that Silas felt something so pure, so untainted by anything else, any of the other things that come with churches and pastors and the act of gathering for worship.\n\nHe’s glad he left it in the service. And as he falls asleep on the couch, he replays that blissful moment over and over, wondering if there was someone else in that room who felt it too, someone who could also say they had heard the very voice of God.\n\nForth now, and fear no darkness.\n\nSoli Deo Gloria\n\nPeter\n\nI went with my dad to see Everton. It was a spiritual experience.\n\nSeptember 23, 2023. Milwaukee, WI\n\n“I’m sorry, I’m probably boring you, aren’t I?” said the old man.\n\n“No, not at all. Go on,” I said.\n\nWe were finishing our beers and reveling in a rare victory for Everton Football Club, who had just beaten Brentford 3-1.\n\nHe wore a Leighton Baines shirt, and I wore Seamus Coleman, the famous fullback duo of not so long ago. A handful of other Everton fans in the pub discussed their plans for the rest of Saturday.\n\n“It’s quite the complicated story of how I came to support this club, I know,” he continued. “But I have always found it to be true: Evertonians are born, not manufactured. We do not choose; we are chosen. Those who understand need no explanation; those who don’t, don’t matter.”\n\nI knew these words. All Evertonians have heard them at some point. They provided the narrative for the stirring season ticket promotion before the 2015-2016 campaign.\n\nThat season and its expectations seemed so very long ago. Times were very different for Everton back then.\n\nTwo seasons prior, the Toffees had surprised everyone by finishing fifth in the English Premier League, accruing a point total that most seasons would be enough to secure a coveted place in the Champions League. It was the first season in charge for the charming, ambitious Spanish manager Roberto Martinez, who had parlayed his stunning FA Cup win with relegated Wigan into management of one of the most famous clubs in England.\n\nRoberto’s second year in charge was a disappointment that found Everton floundering in the middle of the table, but a respectable showing in the Europa League and a bevvy of young talent gave reason for optimism heading into year three. The club was gearing up to make another run at breaking into the English “Big Six” and maybe even earning a spot in the Champions League. Watching that season ticket promo and hearing those inspiring words would have any Evertonian believing anything was possible.\n\nMarch 5, 2016. Sturgeon Bay, WI\n\nI left noontime pickup basketball at the Y and found I had a voicemail.\n\n“Hi, Peter. It’s Ray Malewitz at Oregon State’s School of Writing, Literature, and Film. Could you give me a call back? I’d like to talk to you about your application.”\n\nAfter graduating the December prior, I had been accepted into a fully-funded Master’s program for English Literature and Culture. A couple months later, I would be given the English award for graduating seniors at my college. I felt, for the first time in my life, that I was going where I wanted to go and doing what I wanted to do. I felt capable and confident.\n\nJune 11, 2010. Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nSiphiwe Tshabalala blasted the ball into the top corner of the net after a lightning counter attack for World Cup host nation South Africa versus Mexico. Several teammates joined him on the touchline for a short celebration dance that was pure joy to the tune of delirious fans whose voices (mercifully) drowned out the vuvuzelas. Half a world away, I realized I’m a soccer fan.\n\nAugust 20, 2012. Liverpool, England\n\nMarouane Fellaini’s massive head of hair rose above the Manchester United defense to nod home the winner. I realized I’m an Everton fan. A few days later, I moved into my freshman dorm room.\n\nI started watching Everton Football Club and began my journey into adulthood at about the same time. Those two things dovetailed in 2015-2016 as Everton and I both looked to be headed into big, exciting new chapters.\n\nSitting next to the old man in the Leighton Baines shirt in a pub in 2023, I had just watched Everton – seven managers removed from Roberto Martinez – earn their first win of the season, a season that promises to be a desperate battle over the moon door of relegation for a third successive campaign. And I…well, I’m not who I thought I’d be when I officially accepted the assistantship at Oregon State.\n\nJust last week, two things happened: I traveled with my father, also an Evertonian, to Liverpool for the first time to see Everton play at their famous old ground, Goodison Park, and I turned 30.\n\nThe one happened because of the other; I took this trip because I’ve reached an age that feels significant because our brains like neat numbers like 10. But, for me, 30 really does feel important, a clear end and beginning, an Ebenezer and a point of origin. A commencement.\n\nWhat is it that ended? My 20s, which sucked. Thank you to everyone who helped them not suck a lot worse, but there’s no getting around it. On balance, I didn’t have a great time this decade. Over the last few months, I have found myself mourning these years, filled with regret, and feeling some anxiety about what comes next, a decade I desperately hope goes better than the last one, but finding little reason to believe it will work out.\n\nMy response to life’s challenges has sometimes been to flee, either in the form of a short, spontaneous trip, or packing up my things and moving to what I hope are greener and safer pastures. Earlier this Fall, I first got the idea to make a short trip to the UK when Going.com sent me some great deals on flights. This evolved into making a trip to Liverpool to see Everton play for my birthday. Traveling alone to a rainy city in Europe to be surrounded by strangers while I drink pints of beer and watch football seemed the thing to do to break out of one of the worst depressive periods in my life. Because that’s what I do: I’m a sad boy who sometimes wishes he could disappear or start over and often thinks he’s a character in a Sally Rooney novel. Maybe I could stare out a window into a stormy afternoon long enough to have some kind of breakthrough, or hear some faint echo of the still small voice.\n\nIt also seemed fitting to involve Everton in this since the club’s last decade has paralleled my own in many ways. Great expectations, false dawns, crushing disappointments, near-disasters, actual disasters, abject failure, betrayal, fear, self-loathing.\n\nHowever…\n\nThrough Providence, Personal Growth, and Relentless Love (not that those three things are separate), my perspective on this trip changed in the weeks leading up to it. It was not to be a lonely gift to myself to feel some things and numb some others, not an escape from the regrets of my 20s and the anxieties of my 30s. I thought when I initially planned this trip that what I wanted was to be alone with something that gives me some escape from everything. What I realized was that I actually wanted to be with other people who love this thing so much it changes who we are and how we see the world. This trip was not an escape. Not a funeral, not a restart. It was an awakening.\n\nThere have really only been three things that have been with me every step of the way from my first year of college to now: my family, God, and Everton. Even the friendships that have lasted all this time have waxed and waned in their connectivity. My trip to Liverpool involved all three of these things (not because there happens to be a church literally connected to Goodison Park but because I believe God is with me wherever I go), and my experience last week helped me to reframe so much of where I’ve been, where I am, and where I’m going.\n\nThere is another saying amongst Evertonians that comes from the great Alan Ball: “Once Everton has touched you, nothing will be the same.” This has been true for me, and it is also true for me with the addendum, “except for Everton.” Virtually nothing the last 10+ years has been the same for me…except for Everton.\n\nIf you don’t want more football talk, more uncomfortably personal revelations and ornate sentences, now’s a good time to fast-forward to the end. But I hope you’ll stick with me. I haven’t posted since March, you know. Buckle in. I know where we’re going but I’m not sure yet how we’re getting there.\n\nJanuary 15, 2006. Sturgeon Bay, WI\n\nThe “idiot kicker” Mike Vanderjagt had just missed a chip shot field goal, and the Indianapolis Colts were eliminated from the NFL Playoffs. I went into the other room and sobbed for like an hour.\n\nMarch 21, 2013. De Pere, WI\n\nVander Blue made a layup as the buzzer sounded and Marquette avoided an upset in the first round of March Madness. I started yelling insensibly as I ran around the hall of my college dorm.\n\nSports were my favorite thing growing up, and I lived and died with the results of my teams. I went to college wanting to be a sports journalist, and some of you may recall this used to be a sports blog. But over the years, sports started to play a different role in my life, one a little more casual, more reasonable. For the most part.\n\nMay 19, 2022. La Crosse, WI\n\nI was about to move to Milwaukee the next day, so I’d already returned my wifi equipment. I needed somewhere to watch the Everton match, so I headed downtown to an Irish pub. I had to ask for them to put the match on. They were hosting Crystal Palace, and if they won they would be safe from relegation. Anything less, and they were almost sure to be relegated. They were down 2-0 at half, and there was a pit in my stomach (and a couple pints of Smithwick’s). As per our usual, my dad and I were texting about the match, and we were not confident.\n\nThen Everton scored. Michael Keane, an at-times bumbling centerback, hit the ball with the outside of his boot and curled it into the net. And then they scored again. That magical Brazilian, that flare-throwing, bike-kicking revolutionary, Richarlison, in a moment of improvisational genius, found a way to equalize. And then, in the 85′, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, perhaps the handsomest lad in England, threw himself at a curling free kick. The diving header put Everton in front for good. They were safe from relegation and Goodison Park became a 40-thousand-person party. I teared up and had to explain to the bartender what just happened. My dad and I got choked up again talking about it when I visited home months later.\n\nEverton! You never shined so brightly.\n\nEverton! The spirit of the Blues.\n\nA year later, Everton would again need a win to be safe. This time, when Abdoulaye “Duke” Doucoure smote the ball from the top of the box to score what would be the winner over Bournemouth, my dad and I would be sitting in the same room, able to breathe together that fresh air that comes with knowing your team has survived to fight another day. Hail the man from Mali.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples of me celebrating in public or injuring myself or just making a lot of noise in reaction to something happening in an Everton match. I once began a first date by responding to a simple “How are you?” with “Well, my soccer team lost.” This is certainly unhinged behavior, right? Like, I’m a lunatic, aren’t I?\n\nIn one sense yes, of course I am. A rational cynic could tell me that a football club across the Atlantic Ocean doesn’t actually have anything to do with me, that I’ve made all this up, that it doesn’t need to ruin my Saturdays (and they lose a lot, so it’s a lot of ruined Saturdays). That cynic would be right, but only in the way someone would be right to say novels and movies and TV shows don’t matter, that they’re made up and you don’t need to be invested personally in them. So, if that’s the way they’re right, then they’re wrong. “Those who understand need no explanation; those who don’t, don’t matter.”\n\nAnd maybe they could also say that it was just random chance I came to be an Everton fan. I knew they had an American goalkeeper and were in the middle of the table and had a striker who had dazzled for Croatia at the 2012 Euros, but that was just about it. Truly, if Luis Suarez, that cheating cannibal, hadn’t been on Liverpool at the time, it’s entirely possible I’d be a Kopite gobshite now. The horror.\n\nSo, yes, okay, maybe I could be here 11 years later a diehard fan of any other number of teams who happened to be in the mid table in 2012. But I’m not, because Everton chose me, and Everton chose my dad. It has always, from the first time I watched them play, felt right to support this historic club, a club know for its roots and involvement in the local community (they own the title of The People’s Club!) and professionalism on and of the pitch, a club known for tenacity and collective endeavour. Maybe living/growing up in Green Bay Packers territory instilled those values in us?\n\nAnd, as I alluded to above, there are many parallels between my life and recent Everton history.\n\nMay 12, 2017. Corvallis, OR\n\nI spent a lot of time in graduate school roaming the student union looking for day-old bakery and an open spot to do schoolwork. On this day, I had taken a break from researching 16th century travelogues to watch Everton’s final match of the season. It had been a good season overall, now under the care of Ronald Koeman, though it didn’t quite hit the heights we hoped for. My first year at grad school had gone – overall – pretty well, but the seams were showing. A lot was about to start going wrong.\n\nEverton won the match versus Watford 1-0. The goal came from Ross Barkley, a local boy who had so much potential but never reached it. Everyone knew it was his last game at Goodison, and it was bittersweet celebrating in that moment but knowing we were watching a premature end to what should have been a storied career on Merseyside.\n\nFebruary 2, 2019. Vadnais Heights, MN\n\n“Who’s playing?” asked the young man standing in my living room.\n\n“Everton and Wolves. Everton is my club. They’re terrible,” I said.\n\nThe young man was one of several of my younger brother’s friends who had stopped by as they car-pooled to some Saturday activity.\n\nThe stream was cutting in and out. The Premier League had moved onto Peacock (at that time called NBC Sports Gold) and I didn’t have a subscription because I was broke, so I was using the now-defunct and not-at-all-sketchy SoccerStreams subreddit to watch. Usually I cast them from my phone to my brother’s Apple TV+.\n\nWolves scored.\n\n“Ah, fuck,” I said, louder than I meant to in front of my brother’s friends. “Have fun, see you later.”\n\nEverton played very badly and lost 3-1. The most exciting part of the match was when a black cat invaded the pitch and went marauding on a run more inspiring than any effort an Everton player had put in. Roger Bennett tweeted something after the game that amounted to “Watching Everton used to be a reminder of joy and the strength of the human spirit. Now it is a grim reminder that we are all going to die.”\n\nThat’s about how I felt in the beginning of 2019. I had moved back to the Midwest to live with my brother as he finished college, and that was truly a special thing we were able to do. But I was not my best self (he’d tell you the same thing). Everton were joyless with no clear plan, and I was the same.\n\nOctober 3, 2020. La Crosse, WI\n\n“Well who’s going to be able to stop this Everton juggernaut at the moment?”\n\nThose were actual words said about an actual Everton team in the midst of thrashing Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nThe return of pro sports during COVID was a boon to millions. “The least important most important thing,” as Jurgen Klopp called it, gave us so much when everything was so bleak.\n\nEverton weren’t just back; they were better than I’d ever seen them. Midway through the previous season, Everton had replaced Marco Silva with Carlo Ancelotti, one of the greatest managers of all time. The Italian brought hope in the form of his tactical genius and charisma, but also in the form of several new players. Namely, Allan, his attack dog from their time together at Napoli, the above-mentioned Doucoure, and James Rodriguez, only one of the most talented midfielders of his generation.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, he is the fucking man\n\nThey said there was no chance, Moshiri had a plan\n\nHe wears the blue and white, like all the Toffee men\n\nAnd when we’re back in Europe, we’ll sing this song again, ohhhhh….\n\nBy Boxing Day of 2020, Everton were in second – SECOND – and the COVID vaccine was on the way. Things were looking up.\n\nOf course, they promptly went to shit again. January 6, anti-vaxxers, etc. And Carlo Ancelotti got bored and Everton finished 10th and he left the club to return to Real Madrid. I’m not a pessimist with fear of abandonment for no reason, guys.\n\nApril 22, 2021. La Crosse, WI\n\nI’ve cried plenty of times in therapy, but this occasion was the only time it had something to do with football.\n\n“Yeah, I just talked to my Dad for a few minutes about the soccer game, and it just felt…” *tears* “It just felt so good to talk to him about that, and…sorry, I don’t know why I’m crying right now.”\n\n“You may be lonelier than you thought.”\n\nShe was right. As an introverted homebody, COVID was not a huge adjustment for me in some ways. But I hadn’t realized until then how much human connection I was really missing. I wanted to share things with people – things like Everton. I tried dating apps for the first time that summer and slowly made my way out of my shell.\n\nDecember 12, 2021. Vancouver, WA\n\nI woke up on an unfamiliar couch to a text. “Are you alive?”\n\n“Yeah, I’m up. Hey, what’s the wifi?”\n\nMy favorite American soccer team is the Portland Timbers, and I had traveled on a whim through a blizzard to the PNW to be with other Timbers supporters as they took on NYCFC in the MLS Cup Final. We couldn’t get tickets, but we could still go join the party if they won. They didn’t. They lost in penalty kicks.\n\nI was staying the night with a grad school friend I had a very “It’s Complicated” sort of thing with while we were in school. She rented from and lived with a middle-aged woman in nearby Vancouver. She texted me the wifi info and I started to watch Everton vs. Crystal Palace. Connor Gallagher ran roughshod over us and we lost 3-1. It was a strange time in my life, and I had found myself in an unexpected place with unexpected people, and yet Everton were there on my little phone, losing again.\n\nThe losses would pile up, and that Spring as relegation looked almost certain I went ahead and really messed things up with my girlfriend. Like, really bad. Sometimes it’s not my fault. Sometimes it’s not Everton’s fault. And sometimes it is. More than sometimes, actually. Everton and I have both made some truly terrible decisions these last few years.\n\nBut it’s not always our fault…\n\nAugust 2, 2022. Washington, DC\n\nRoger Bennett, host of the Men in Blazers show and the most famous Evertonian in America, interviewed several members of the team as they completed a tour of the US before returning to England to begin the new season. Frank Lampard, the Chelsea legend who steered us to safety the year before, talked about what would be different this year to avoid going through another relegation scrap. Among the players Rog interviewed was the young Antony Gordon, a boyhood Blue who was one of the standouts from the prior season. With him leading the way, we were sure to leave the foot of the table behind.\n\nI listened to this podcast in my apartment in Milwaukee where everything was going right for me (well, except for having to get rabies shots, but never mind that).\n\nMy life, again, went to shit over the next few months, and Everton were just as bad. Frank Lampard was out of answers and was sacked. Antony Gordon made a shocking heel turn and requested/forced a transfer to Newcastle in January. Piss off, Ant.\n\nAt about my lowest point, my brother came to see me simply because I asked him. We had lunch and I told him about how I wished I could bet money on Everton being relegated so that if/when it happened, I’d have some consolation.\n\nEverton survived, thanks to the above-described Doucoure goal, and my life did get better. And then we messed it up again, naturally. I ruined another relationship and Everton found themselves entering a new season picked by many to get relegated and facing a potential points deduction for one count of infringing financial fair play rules (Manchester City has over 100 counts and has no such penalty forthcoming, for some perspective). They were/are also trying and failing to secure new ownership, and the leading candidate right now is skeeeeeeeetch.\n\nPerhaps you see now how I have come to identify so strongly with this club and why I would see a solo trip to see them play as an appropriate and alluring course of action. And maybe, with these anecdotes and explanations, you’ll understand some of why last week was so meaningful.\n\nSo…what happened last week?\n\nNovember 2, 2023. Liverpool, England\n\nMy dad and I arrived around midday in gray and rainy Liverpool on the banks of the River Mersey. It’s a large, blue collar, left-leaning city with major universities and a somewhat turbulent history. So, yeah, it felt familiar.\n\nThat first day confirmed many of the things we had heard or assumed about the city and its sports teams. It gave a real, lived-in place for the team I’ve just known as people on TV for my adult life.\n\nGoodison park just kind of comes out of nowhere. You drive from the countryside to the suburban area and then you’re in rows and rows of flats and there’s an ancient concrete and steel cathedral rising up from the earth.\n\nWe’ve heard commentators say before about how Everton and their arch-rival Liverpool are just across Stanley Park from one another, but distances don’t really compute until you measure them with your own eyes. They are shockingly close; you can stand at street level and see them both. This is a physical representation of the 100+ year history of this bitter rivalry. In 1878, there was just one football team in Liverpool, a church-sponsored team named St. Domingo’s, which later took on the name Everton (named for the area of the city where the church was located). A dispute between the committee and owner led to Everton relocating to one of the few places where they could build a purpose-built stadium. Goodison. The owner founded a new team close to the original ground. Anfield.\n\nAnd there the two giants have sat ever since. The Merseyside Derby, the Friendly Derby, blue vs red. The city has been divided in this way for well over 100 years. One can’t help but think what would have happened if the two never split and the whole of this proud city rallied around one football club.\n\nWe stayed in a guest house above a pub just a few blocks from Goodison. My dad had let them know it was my birthday ahead of time, so they had streamers and a balloon and a card in the room for me. Maybe once upon a time this would have annoyed or embarrassed me, but one of the great gifts aging has given me is an appreciation – or at least a tolerance – for many of the little things my parents do. The innkeeper chatted with us about the room and where to get breakfast and mentioned casually that her friend is married to Everton legend Duncan Ferguson.\n\nAfter visiting the Beatles Story and hearing their “new”/”last” song a day early (!), we trudged through the rain to find one of the main Everton murals. There is a huge mural of Giannis Antetokounmpo downtown Milwaukee that I drive by often, and I never get tired of seeing it. It is majestic and grand, a statement of the great fortune we have here to employ the best (okay, mayyyyybe second-best) basketball player on Earth. This Everton mural is different. It is off the main drag in the middle of an industrial park where there is a lot of street art and graffiti. You’d have to be looking for it to find it. And when you find it…it’s glorious. F"
