        "text": "From 1915 through 1919, the team of Harold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels gave the movie-going public the impression that a behind-the-camera romance was in the making. In front of the camera, they made quite another impression: that of making nearly 150 silent short comedies (one- and two-reelers). Their off-screen romancing may have been simply for publicity, a way to pique public interest in their frequent and comedic romancing on screen. Still, a genuine affection for each other and an unmistakable sense of fun with one another manifest in both the volume of their output and the fact that, even though they ended up romantically with different partners and living on different continents (she in England; he in the U.S.), they remained close friends to the very end of their lives. Interestingly, they both died in March 1971 eight days apart.\n\nYou’ll note that their early reels reveal a Chaplinesque Harold Lloyd in the form of a character he labeled Lonesome Luke. After Charlie Chaplin complained about the similarity of Lonesome Luke to Chaplin’s Tramp, Mr. Lloyd combed his hair, tidied up his clothes, put on a pair of glasses and created the Harold Lloyd signature persona.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels’ teamwork is not complete, indeed, without mentioning Harry “Snub” Pollard, who co-starred in each of the 147 short films Ms. Daniels and Mr. Lloyd made together. Mr. Pollard, like Harold Lloyd, usually portrays a likable character fraught with mishaps and missteps that very often result in some kind of slapdash and/or slapstick comedic sequence. Unlike Mr. Lloyd, Snub Pollard never gets the girl, which is always and of course Ms. Daniels.\n\nBebe Daniels and Harold Lloyd effectively retired from movie making by the late 1940s and were only occasionally seen in front of a camera after that time. Snub Pollard continued a busy career in supporting roles as most notably the sidekick Pee Wee to singing cowboy Tex Ritter or, more usually, as one of a host of extras in well over 400 movies and TV shows. He died in January 1962, a few months before the release of his last on-screen appearance as a member of the crowd petitioning for statehood in John Ford’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\n\nHere is a list of their voluminous collaborations:"
