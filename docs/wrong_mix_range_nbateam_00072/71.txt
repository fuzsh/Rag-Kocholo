Hawks guard Kyle Korver scored 24 points on 7 of 10 shooting, including 7 of 9 from 3-point range in Atlanta's 107-99 win over the Bulls Saturday. It was the most 3-pointers Korver has made in a game this season and most since Dec. 18, 2013 when he went 8 of 10 from 3-point range.

"I think they enjoy sharing the ball. They enjoy playing with each other," Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. "They know that they'll all reap the benefits of it if everybody plays unselfishly."

Korver added six rebounds and two assists to his total Saturday. He and the Hawks will look to keep rolling Monday agaionst the Pistons.
