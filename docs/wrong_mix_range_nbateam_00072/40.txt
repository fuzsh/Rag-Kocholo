Another one bites the dust. For those of us in the camp of not signing Josh Smith or Andre Iguodala at any costs, Kyle Korver was one of the best fits for a young team looking to stretch defenses. Korver's 10 years of experience, and career 42% shooting from beyond the arc could have fit beautifully on a young Pistons team managed by a yet-to-be-signed Jose Calderon and the interior presence of Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond.

With Korver and Martell Webster now off the market, the Pistons choices at small forward are narrowing to players with either little ability to stretch the floor or inadequate fit for the small forward position.

At this point, I would rather we simply abandon our hopes of signing an over-priced SF and instead agree with BRGulker's prior sentiment of looking at Kyle Singler, Jonas Jerebko, Khris Middleton, and even Tony Mitchell to fill the minutes at small forward for the Pistons as we head into the trade deadline next season.

What say you, community, would you have been willing to sign the 32-year-old Kyle Korver to a 4 year, $24 million deal to knock down 3s as our starting small forward next year?
