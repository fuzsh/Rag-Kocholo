        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Nothing against the city of Philadelphia, but the Detroit Pistons don't want to make a trip back there any time soon.\n\nThe defending NBA champions will get their wish if they beat the 76ers on Tuesday night in Game 5 of their first-round series.\n\n\"All we have to do is give our fans a little bit to cheer about, get them going and feed off their energy,\" Detroit's Ben Wallace said Monday after winning the Defensive Player of the Year award for the third time in four years. \"We definitely don't want to go back to Philly.\n\n\"We have an opportunity to wrap it up at home and we have to take advantage of it.\"\n\nIf the Sixers beat Detroit, they would return to Philadelphia for Game 6 on Thursday night trailing the best-of-seven series 3-2.\n\nPhiladelphia coach Jim O'Brien was encouraged by his team's attention to detail during Monday's practice and film session. He also liked their attitude.\n\n\"They're extremely upbeat, very focused,\" he said. \"I don't find this team to get down on themselves too much.\"\n\nHowever, O'Brien said the Sixers know their season will be over if they don't find a way to win at The Palace after being routed there in the first two games of the series.\n\n\"There is a certain feeling among the players of an urgency and desperation,\" he said.\n\nDetroit's Tayshaun Prince, who went down briefly in the third quarter Sunday with a sprained right ankle, is listed as probable for Game 5.\n\n\"He's a lot more sore than he was during the game,\" Pistons coach Larry Brown said.\n\nPrince went through Detroit's light practice with his right ankle taped.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" said Prince, adding he would've been healthy enough to play Monday.\n\nPrince said the injury limits him more offensively than defensively.\n\nThat's not good news for Kyle Korver.\n\nPrince has limited Korver to 5.5 points a game and 6-of-22 shooting from beyond the 3-point line. The small forward averaged 11.5 points during the regular season and made a franchise-record 226 3-pointers, tying the most made in the NBA.\n\n\"I haven't gotten a lot of good looks,\" Korver said. \"I think when I finally do get a good look, I'm so excited, so eager to shoot it, that I just kind of rush. I've got to slow it down a little bit.\"\n\nO'Brien insisted he's not worried about Korver's shooting ability.\n\n\"I think you go through cycles,\" O'Brien said. \"Kyle is, in my estimation, a cold-blooded shooter. He's not going to stop shooting it. He doesn't seem like a guy that ever gets down on his confidence.\"\n\nThough the Sixers face elimination, Korver said he's not sure they can play with more intensity than they did in the previous four games.\n\n\"I don't know if there's any more you can bring out of us,\" he said.\n\nChauncey Billups, who helped Detroit rally from a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit in Game 4, is wary of what type of effort the Allen Iverson-led Sixers will play with Tuesday.\n\n\"They've got nothing to lose,\" Billups said. \"They're going to play very hard. We're going to have to beat them because they're not going to lay down.\""
