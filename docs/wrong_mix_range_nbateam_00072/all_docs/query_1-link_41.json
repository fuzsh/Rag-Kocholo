        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” Donovan Mitchell scored 28 points and Rudy Gobert tied a career high with 25 rebounds to propel the Utah Jazz past the Detroit Pistons 100-94 on Monday night.\n\nKyle Korver had 19 points, including five 3-pointers, to help the Jazz win for the sixth time in seven games. Gobert finished with 18 points and two blocks. Mitchell has poured in at least 26 points in six consecutive games, the best such stretch of his career.\n\nUtah has won five straight against the Pistons and 22 of 26.\n\nBlake Griffin scored 19 points and Andre Drummond contributed 15 points and 13 rebounds for Detroit, which has lost five of six.\n\nThe Pistons hounded Mitchell full court and forced him to spend a lot of energy throughout the game just to receive the ball and get to his spots.\n\nMitchell was 1 for 7 over a 14-minute span of the third and fourth quarters and looked worn down. But the second-year guard made a scintillating drive and three-point play with 48.9 seconds to play for a 95-89 Utah lead.\n\nJoe Ingles, who had 13 points, shut the door on the Pistons with a 3 with 24.2 seconds left that made it 98-91. As the ball went through the hoop, he turned around and blew a kiss to the crowd.\n\nAfter the Jazz trailed for most of the game, Derrick Favors capped a 13-0 run with a follow dunk to give Utah a 66-62 lead. But the Pistons surged back in front and led 82-78 on Reggie Jackson's floater in the lane.\n\nThe Pistons led by 12 in the first half despite sending the Jazz to the foul line 24 times and attempting only six free throws themselves. Detroit forced 10 turnovers that led to 16 points and had a 59-53 at the break.\n\nFor the third straight game, Utah played without a true point guard. Ricky Rubio (hamstring), Dante Exum (ankle) and Raul Neto (groin) were out with injuries.\n\nWithout a point guard, the Jazz found themselves in unfamiliar positions and driving lanes, often up against the shot clock. The Pistons' defense produced 18 turnovers by cutting off paths to the hoop and picking off desperate passes.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Griffin missed his first six 3-point attempts but in the fourth made a four-point play. ... Drummond got a technical foul with 3:11 left in the fourth quarter, but Mitchell missed the free throw. ... Detroit went 11 for 36 from the 3-point line after a fast start.\n\nJazz: Ingles left the court with 1:26 left in the first half due to a sprained ankle but returned in the second half. ... The Jazz outrebounded the Pistons 55-38.\n\nISH IS THE SPIRIT\n\nIsh Smith, who missed 19 games with a torn adductor muscle, returned to the court and his coach couldn't have been happier. Smith scored eight points and the Pistons outscored the Jazz by six when he was on the court.\n\n\"Ish is our spirit ... he is the speed of our team. He gets the tempo and pace going,\" Dwane Casey said before the game. \"He always has a smile on his face and enjoys playing the game.\"\n\nIn the 19 games Smith missed, the Pistons were 5-14 and their efficiency and shooting percentage dropped precipitously.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.\n\nJazz: Visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
