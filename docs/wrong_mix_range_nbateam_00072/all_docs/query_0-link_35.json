        "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Kyle Korver is expected to suit up when the Cavs play the Detroit Pistons on Monday night.\n\nThe sharpshooter had been dealing with soreness in his right foot, which caused him to miss the last two games against the Charlotte Hornets and Washington Wizards. Cavs head coach Larry Drew said that Korver was a participant in drills earlier this morning.\n\nThis is good news for the team, as the Cavs are currently 18th in the league when it comes to three-point percentage at 35.4 percent.\n\nFurthermore, the team has the fewest made 3-pointers out of any other team so far, with 115 makes to date. This marks a stark contrast from last yearâ€™s Cavs team, which finished second in the league in three-point makes (981) and sixth in three-point percentage (37.2 percent)."
