        "text": "ATLANTA -- DeMarre Carroll and Jeff Teague each scored 17 points to lead a balanced offense, Kyle Korver dunked for the first time in more than two years, and the Atlanta Hawks tied a franchise record with their 14th straight victory, routing the Indiana Pacers 110-91 on Wednesday night.\n\nWith the victory, the Hawks improved to a stunning 35-8 and Mike Budenholzer clinched a spot as the Eastern Conference coach in next month's All-Star Game in New York City.\n\nBudenholzer should be taking several players with him. The Hawks romped to their 28th victory in the last 30 games, showing the kind of teamwork that has become their trademark in a season that no one saw coming.\n\nTen players had scored by halftime. All five starters were in double figures, and Pero Antic also had 12.\n\nCJ Miles led the Pacers with 18 points. Indiana shot just 39.7 percent (see full recap).\n\nWestbrook's layup gives Thunder OT victory\n\nWASHINGTON -- Russell Westbrook drove for the winning layup with 0.8 seconds left in overtime, and Kevin Durant greeted the latest KD2DC craze with 34 points Wednesday night as the Oklahoma City Thunder won their fourth straight with a 105-103 victory over the Washington Wizards.\n\nDurant and Westbrook scored all 13 of the Thunder's points in the extra period, including Durant's throw-down dunk over Marcin Gortat and Westbrook's surprisingly uncontested layup off of an inbounds play after Oklahoma City had called timeout with 3.6 seconds remaining.\n\nNBA\n\nWestbrook finished with 32 points and led a third-quarter comeback that made up a 12-point halftime deficit. Durant, the D.C. native whose 2016 free agency is much-anticipated in his hometown, added seven rebounds and broke out of a career-worst 0-for-14 slump from 3-point range by making four from long range after halftime.\n\nNene scored 24 points for the Wizards, including nine of Washington's 11 points in overtime. John Wall had 28 points and 13 assists (see full recap).\n\nJennings has huge game in Pistons' win\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Brandon Jennings had 24 points and a career-high 21 assists, and the Detroit Pistons held off the Orlando Magic 128-118 on Wednesday night.\n\nAndre Drummond added 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Pistons, who have won 12 of 15. Detroit nearly blew a 21-point third-quarter lead, but Jennings helped the Pistons hold off the Magic's rally in the fourth.\n\nNikola Vucevic led Orlando with 26 points.\n\nGreg Monroe had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, which never trailed. The Pistons led by 11 after the first quarter and by 17 at halftime."
