        "text": "“We’ll bring him in,” Budenholzer said Saturday of Dunleavy after the Hawks’ shootaround in Dallas. “I think he’s got the type of game and a skill set that I think he could be very good playing for us. We’ll just have to see how he is, integrate him, continue to build. He’s a player who we’ve liked, and personally I’ve liked, for a long time. We’ll see how he fits into our mix.”\n\nKorver offers the Cavs immediate help after J.R. Smith was ruled out three months after having surgery late last month on a broken thumb. “It just gives Cleveland another weapon,” Pistons president-coach Stan Van Gundy said Saturday during his team’s morning shootaround. “When you’re playing with a guy like LeBron, who’s probably the best passer in the league, and Kyrie Irving, who draws a lot of attention, they want to put as much shooting out there as they can.”"
