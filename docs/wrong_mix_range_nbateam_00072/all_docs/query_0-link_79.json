        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) – Stanley Johnson scored 20 points and Marcus Morris added 17 points and 10 rebounds as the Detroit Pistons routed the Atlanta Hawks 115-87 on Friday night in the teams’ preseason finale.\n\nHawks: Reserve Mike Scott had 20 points in 29 minutes… Walter Tavares had 12 rebounds, playing much of the game against Andre Drummond, but only made 1 of 6 shots.\n\nPistons: Reserve Jodie Meeks had 17 points… Drummond had 13 points and 8 rebounds while only playing 18 minutes.\n\nNice debut: After missing the first seven preseason games with a concussion, Steve Blake made his first appearance in a Pistons uniform. He finished with 12 assists in 24 minutes.\n\nLimited Rosters: With the teams playing each other in the regular-season opener on Tuesday, both coaches held back significant portions of their rosters. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Reggie Jackson and Ersan Ilyasova all sat out for Detroit, while Atlanta left Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, Thabo Sefolosha and Tiago Splitter at home.\n\nLate signing: After the game the Pistons announced the signing of guard Ryan Boatright.\n\nThe 6-foot Boatright went undrafted out of Connecticut in 2015 and signed with the Brooklyn Nets. In four preseason games with the Nets, Boatright averaged 4.3 points, 1.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 13.9 minutes before being released.\n\nTerms of the agreement were not disclosed."
