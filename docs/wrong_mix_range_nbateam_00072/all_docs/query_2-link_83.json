        "text": "With the Chicago Bulls desperately trying to cut costs in order to match the Houston Rockets deal with Omer Asik, they've been talking to several teams about unloading reserve shooter Kyle Korver.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks, who have a trade exception that would allow them to absorb Korver's salary without sending anyone back, are reportedly at the top of that list:\n\nIf Atlanta doesn't have to give up any significant assets, picking up Korver would make a lot of sense, as he would allow them to remain competitive without sacrificing any of their cap flexibility going forward. He'll be paid $5 million in the last year of his contract this season."
