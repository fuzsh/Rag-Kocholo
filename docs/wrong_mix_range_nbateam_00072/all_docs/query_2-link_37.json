        "text": "Getty Images\n\nWith Dwyane Wade officially bowing out of this weekend's NBA All-Star Game due to an injured hamstring, NBA.com announced Atlanta Hawks forward Kyle Korver will make the trip to New York City as a replacement.\n\nThe Hawks now have an NBA-high four All-Stars, matching the all-time record. This is the eighth time four All-Stars have come from the same team and first since the Boston Celtics sent Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett in 2011.\n\nKorver, long viewed as the biggest snub in the Eastern Conference, is in the midst of perhaps the greatest shooting season in league history.\n\nDespite that, Andrew Gruman of Fox Sports Wisconsin believes Bucks star Brandon Knight got the snub:\n\nJody Genessy of the Deseret News voiced his support for the Korver selection:\n\nHe's on pace to become the first qualifying player to shoot 50 percent or better overall, 50 percent or better from three-point range and 90 percent or better from the free-throw line. (It's happened eight previous times, per Basketball-Reference, but none of the players had enough shot attempts to qualify among leaders.)\n\nJohn Amis/Associated Press\n\nKorver's current true shooting percentage of .736 would be the best in NBA history by almost three percentage points. The Hawks are nearly 13 points per 100 possessions better with Korver on the floor this season, with the difference largely on the offensive side. They assist on a higher percentage of their baskets, ascend in effective field-goal percentage and have fewer turnovers.\n\nAll of these facts helped inform commissioner Adam Silver's decision and helped Korver overcome otherwise shrug-worthy counting stats. The former Creighton star is averaging 12.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.7 assists, which are close to career-best numbers but not ones typically associated with All-Star status.\n\nWith the Hawks busting out to an East-leading 43-10 record and floor spacing becoming increasingly important across the NBA, though, Korver's candidacy became a no-brainer."
