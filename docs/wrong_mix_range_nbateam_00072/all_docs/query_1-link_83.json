        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers have dealt with quite a few injuries to their rotation this season. Chris Andersen suffered a season-ending ACL injury, Kevin Love is recovering from knee surgery, J.R. Smith has been out with a fractured right thumb and now, Andrew Bogut has been ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a fractured tibia. Despite these injuries, the Cavs are still the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 42-20 record.\n\nHowever, more bad news came down the wire today with regards to injuries.\n\nAccording to the Cavaliers, Kyle Korver is experiencing soreness in his left foot. Korver will still be able to travel with the team during their upcoming three-game road trip, but the sharp shooting guard has been ruled out for Thursday’s game against the Detroit Pistons. An update on his status will be released after evaluation and treatment.\n\nSince being traded from the Atlanta Hawks to the Cavs, Korver has played exceptionally well, averaging 11.1 points while shooting 49 percent from the field and 48 percent from three in 25.9 minutes per game. With Korver’s absence, the Cavs will likely give more minutes to Iman Shumpert and DeAndre Liggins.\n\nThere is a bit of good news to report, however. According to Chris Fedor of cleveland.com, Cavs Head Coach Tyronn, who has been dealing with an illness and missed Monday night’s loss to the Miami Heat, is expected to be on the sideline for Thursday’s road game against the Detroit Pistons.\n\n“I talked to him last night,” said associate head coach Larry Drew, who has been running the show in Lue’s absence. “He sounds a little bit better, but still he’s a little bit under the weather. We hope he can get well as soon as he can.”"
