        "text": "DETROIT — Collin Sexton dominates these Final Thoughts from the Cavaliers’ 110-103 loss to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nKyle Korver was a senior at Pella High School in the small Iowa city where he lived, starring on the court the winter Collin Sexton was born — a few days after the new year in 1999. This March, Korver will turn 38. It’s his 16th season. Who knows whether his season or career will end with the Cavs? Sexton, meanwhile, is the Cavs’ future. They drafted him eighth overall. He turns 20 on Jan. 4. And, let’s face it. Maybe the best thing Cleveland can do on the court this season, the most this proud franchise can hope for, is he develops properly and a sterling career takes off.\n\nSexton was born in Marietta, Ga., outside of Atlanta. Korver is actually a California kid, born there on St. Patrick’s Day, 1981. The point to all of this is they are two very different people from different eras, entering very different parts of their careers and lives. But Thursday night they were linked like this: Sexton’s ability to find Korver and get him the ball showed marked improvement for the rookie.\n\nSexton’s five assists were a career high, albeit in a small sample size of five games. But he’s never been much of a distributor. Instead, Sexton was a scoring point guard in his one season at Alabama. Up here in the big leagues, he has to do more. So on this otherwise nondescript night in Detroit, in a season that is quickly slipping away from the Cavs before the leaves even fall off the trees, Sexton recorded four of his five assists on passes to Korver. Three of them were for 3s. “I see his hands, no matter if he’s even around the screen, just throw it,” Sexton said. “I’ve been playing with him a couple games now. I know where he likes the ball, so I just gotta deliver it on time, on target.”\n\nIt wasn’t just that Sexton was distributing the ball for a team whose starting point guard — George Hill — hasn’t recorded a single assist in two games. Nor was it that Sexton was getting the ball to Korver, who at this advanced stage in his career can still be a weapon. Sexton helped Korver become a weapon again for the first time this year, getting him some looks on a night when Korver dialed up 21 points and four 3s. In his first four games, Korver took a total of three 3s and sat out one entire game as a healthy scratch. “Any time you make a couple, the action, the ball starts finding you,” Korver said.\n\n“It hurts me to say it was a loss, but there were some positives,” Korver said. “As competitors, we want to win, but I thought there was some good out there tonight.”\n\nIt’s important for the Cavs for Korver to play like he did Thursday, in no small part so he drums up bidding for his services from contenders and his current team gets a first-round pick for him in return. Until that happens though, they’ll take him bombing 3s in a Cleveland uniform. For that to happen, Sexton needs to get him the ball on the second unit. “I think he’s getting better at it,” Korver said. “Point guard is a tough position in the NBA. You got to be able to control a lot of things. You’ve got to be able to read both ends of the court and feel all of your teammates. He’s trying to learn us as players but also learn the game. The NBA game is a lot different than college. He’s a young guy. I think the thing about Collin, the thing we all love, is he’s coachable and he wants to be good.”\n\nFor the second time in five games, coach Tyronn Lue left Sexton on the floor in a relatively close game from the moment he subbed in for Hill in the third quarter (there was 3:54 left) until the game was over. The Cavs trailed by 14 in the fourth and got as close as six points with 49.1 seconds to go. Sexton scored 10 of his 14 points in the final frame, and Korver registered 16. Larry Nance Jr., a reserve center, also played the final 1 1/2 quarters. Lue used backups JR Smith and Jordan Clarkson (18 points, 8-of-12 shooting), and then closed with Cedi Osman and Rodney Hood. “Whoever is playing well is going to close the game. That’s the type of team we have right now,” Lue said.\n\nOn Sexton, Lue said: “I know he’s a scoring point guard, can score the basketball, but we want him to be all around, and that’s what he’s becoming.” Sexton shot 5 of 9 and also recorded two steals. I asked him what he thought he did better Thursday than in Wednesday’s 16-point loss to the Nets, and he said defense. Fine.\n\nThe Cavs are 0-5 for the seventh time in team history, the first since LeBron’s rookie year in 2003. I can’t sit here and rightfully say they’re in danger of the club record for most losses to begin a season (15, in 1970, the team’s first season), but the second-worst start (0-9, in 1984) … well, this fever isn’t going to break itself. Thursday marked the first time all year the Cavs didn’t fall behind by at least 20 in a game, and they played without All-Star Kevin Love. Still, they were never in real position to steal this game.\n\n“The room for error is so slim for us right now,” Lue said. “If you’re supposed to box out, box out. If you’re supposed to switch, switch. Just the small things we’ve got to keep getting better at.” Twice, the Cavs lost their first seven games to start a season and still made the playoffs (including that ’84-85 campaign, when it was nine losses). So if your glass is always half full, there you go, hope. Otherwise, no matter what else Cleveland does, it needs to make sure Sexton has more nights like this.\n\nThere will of course be bumps in the road. Ask Osman, who, after two sterling performances to start the season has handed in three clunkers. He was 1-of-8 shooting for three points against the Pistons and fouled out. Osman is shooting 9 of 35 in his last three games. “The last three games were probably the worst three of my life, at least as far as shooting the ball,” Osman told me. Looked it up and, yes, in Osman’s brief career (spanning a total of 66 NBA games), this is the first time he’s shot .333 or worse in three consecutive games with at least three attempts.\n\nLue said Osman’s shot selection has been “questionable” at times, but, “he takes it personal when teams go under on him.” Lue meant that Osman is offended when defenders go under screens when he has the ball on the perimeter, daring him to shoot. “That’s the mentality he has,” Lue said. “We talked about it today. He says it’s disrespectful. I love Cedi. I love where he’s at. I love how he competes.”\n\nHood was 4-of-12 for 10 points. Entering the year, Lue said Hood would (or should) be the team’s second scoring option behind Love. Instead, he’s tied for fifth at 11.0 ppg. He’s shooting .386 from the field and, let’s see here, .111 from 3-point range. He’s playing for a contract heading into unrestricted free agency, and needs to do more than this to get that payday.\n\nWith Love out with a sore left foot, the Cavs mostly played small against Detroit behemoths Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin. Drummond killed them with 26 points and 22 rebounds, and Griffin added 26 points and 10 boards. But after what we’ve seen collectively on defense from the Cavs, Thursday was better overall. They even forced 20 turnovers.\n\nAs for Love, it’s the foot that forced him out of the final three preseason games. Team officials told me Love was held out as a precaution, but the fact remains this is something that’s been bothering him all year. He’s averaging 19.0 points and 13.5 rebounds, but is struggling with his shot (20 percent from 3-point range and 32 percent from the field). Channing Frye went from wearing street clothes in Wednesday’s loss to starting for Love. Frye scored five points with four rebounds in his first action of any kind so far this regular season.\n\nThe Cavs trailed by seven with 20.4 seconds left when Sexton was tied up by Ish Smith for a jump ball. Before Smith locked up Sexton, Lue sprinted across halfcourt to try to call timeout and preserve the possession. Not only was he not awarded the timeout, he was slapped with a technical for crossing the midline. “They never look for the coach at the other end of the floor when guys are scrambling, tangled up. I tried to tell you that about last year’s situation, too. They never look. I don’t know what you’re supposed to do.” By “last year’s situation,” Lue was referring to the end of regulation in Game 1 of the Finals, when JR dribbled out the clock with the score tied. Lue contends no official looked his way for a timeout to be called.\n\nThis was fun. Hill had a bag of bear jerky (BEAR, not beef) in the locker room before the game. I tried a piece. Tasted like chicken (no, it didn’t, and my hands smelled until I could wash them). Hill said the jerky was made out of a black bear he shot with a rifle in New Mexico over the summer. Larry Nance tried some. Lue and Osman refused. “You were trying to find out what’s in it because of all your religion rules,” Hill said to Osman, who is a Muslim. “I get that, but ain’t none of your religious stuff in this.” Hill wouldn’t say which parts of the bear were actually in the jerky.\n\nThe Cavs return home to host the Indiana Pacers on Saturday. Yes, the Cavs are winless. But they’ve been so much worse at home. Talk to you then."
