        "text": "Issac Baldizon/Getty Images\n\nAs highlighted by Grantland’s Bill Simmons, the NBA’s Eastern Conference is a \"muddled mess of mediocre players, bad executives and even worse contracts.\" Through a month and a half of the 2013-14 season, only three teams are above .500: the Miami Heat, the Indiana Pacers, and the Atlanta Hawks. Realistically, the top two playoff spots are already accounted for in the East. The rest of the conference is up for grabs.\n\nAmong the most talented Eastern Conference teams going in the right direction are the Detroit Pistons. High-profile offseason acquisitions Brandon Jennings and Josh Smith are finally starting to jell in Detroit’s explosive starting lineup, while Andre Drummond is clearly taking the next step toward NBA superstardom in only his second season.\n\nGreg Monroe is one of the conference’s most consistent power forwards and rookie Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has been a seamless fit since being inserted into the starting lineup on November 15. Detroit has played its most impressive three games of the season in wins against Philadelphia, at Miami and at Milwaukee, and at 9-10 stands just one game back of .500 heading into Saturday’s game at Chicago.\n\nThough the entire Eastern conference is theoretically still in the hunt to finish one spot behind Indiana and Miami, five teams pose the greatest threat to the Pistons’ quest for third. With current record, key players and the teams' realistic ceilings taken into consideration, they can found by clicking below:\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nCurrently the East’s third-place team, the Hawks were projected to finish in the middle of the pack after completely revamping their roster this past offseason. Though Atlanta has had some growing pains through 21 games, the roster has ultimately flourished with Jeff Teague and free-agent signee Paul Millsap leading the way.\n\nKyle Korver has been as hot from three-point range as any shooter in the NBA, and Al Horford is averaging a career-high 17.5 points per game. The Hawks get help off the bench from Lou Williams, Gustavo Ayon, and Cartier Martin, but the team’s relatively weak depth suggests it won’t retain the third spot for much longer. But hey, in the East, who really knows?\n\nJesse D. Garrabrant/Getty Images\n\nWithout Derrick Rose, the Bulls’ stock has certainly taken a hit. But not all is lost for Chi-town. The Bulls clinched a fifth seed in last year’s NBA playoffs, and gave the eventual champion Miami Heat a brief scare in the Eastern Conference semifinals—all without Rose.\n\nSwingman Luol Deng is having a career season in the final year of his contract and Rose recently left open the possibility of a late-season comeback—per ESPNChicago.com. Depending on GM Gar Forman’s mindset at the trade deadline, the Bulls could potentially still be intact to make a late-season run, with or without Rose.\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nThe Wizards are one of the few mediocre Eastern conference teams that (a) aren’t thought to be tanking for next year’s draft or (b) a huge disappointment. Washington has a young, improving roster that has potential to break through in the East. And if there’s any season to do it, it’s this season.\n\nThe Wizards have won four of their last six games after Bradley Beal went down with a left knee injury, but have struggled to gain consistency due to poor shooting by Beal and John Wall. The two combined are shooting just over 40 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range.\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nThe Nets have been awful this season, and that’s putting it lightly. Head coach Jason Kidd is dealing with an overpaid, old and injury-riddled roster that has simply not performed anywhere near what was expected going into the season. Kidd himself is dealing with the growing pains of being a first-year head coach, and his recent demotion of top-assistant Lawrence Frank shows just how ugly things are getting in Brooklyn.\n\nWith all of that being said, the Nets, when healthy, have one of the most experienced and talented rosters in the NBA. Perhaps offseason acquisitions Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry are well past their primes, but they know how to win. The health of Deron Williams, who’s scheduled to return from an ankle injury on Tuesday, will probably be the single most important factor to the team’s success.\n\nAs of now, the Nets aren’t a favorite for the third seed, but could be deadly if they’re able to sneak into the playoffs as the East’s fourth or fifth seed.\n\nBrian Babineau/Getty Images\n\nThe surprise of the season, the Celtics are actually competing for a playoff position after trading away three top players and coach Doc Rivers in the offseason. First-year coach Brad Stevens has the Celtics in fourth place in the East at 9-12, and winners in five out of their last seven games.\n\nStevens has helped make a quality starter out of Jordan Crawford, and second-year forward Jared Sullinger is playing the best basketball of his young career. Though it might have been in Boston’s best interest to tank this season for an early draft pick in the 2014 draft, the Celtics are in the early hunt for the East’s third spot."
