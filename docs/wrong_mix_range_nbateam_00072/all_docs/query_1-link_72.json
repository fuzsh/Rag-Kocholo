        "text": "Stan Van Gundy was worried about Saturday night’s game against the Atlanta Hawks. The Detroit Pistons coach knew his team had played the night before, and knew his big men had difficulty staying with Atlanta’s bigs on the perimeter with good rest.\n\nHe was right to worry, as the Hawks' Paul Millsap torched the Pistons for 15 first-half points, and the Hawks beat the Pistons 112-95. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak, but the Pistons kept its two-game lead over Chicago because the Bulls lost to Orlando.\n\nBOX SCORE\n\n“Hey look, I’ve been here two years,” said Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy, “I don’t know if you’ve heard this out of me yet -- and I’m not saying I was happy with the way we played, obviously we didn’t’ play well -- but, it was about them. That’s a very good team that’s really hitting their stride and played terrific about both ends tonight.”\n\nAtlanta jumped on the Pistons from the start, bolting to a 11-2 lead, and led by as much as 16 in the second quarter. Marcus Morris hit a couple of free throws and a short jumper to cut the lead to eight with less than 2 minutes to play in the half before Millsap scored six straight. The Hawks led by 14 at the break.\n\nThe pattern held for much of the night, as the Pistons would make a run only to have Atlanta make a shot, or get to the foul line. At one point, Kyle Korver added a four-point play.\n\nThe Hawks consistently pressured the Pistons on the three-point line, either running the shooters off of it or contesting the shots, blocking at least three. Meanwhile, Atlanta hit eight threes in the first half alone, and finished with 13 for the game.\n\nIt would’ve been easy for the Pistons to give in, but they hung around the margins most of the night, even though they had played the night before, were down big early, and the Hawks kept making threes. More psychologically damaging were the missed shots every time the Pistons had an opportunity to truly pressure.\n\n“We’d get it to eight, nine, seven, we couldn’t get over the hump,” said Van Gundy. “They played at a level tonight that we haven’t been able to get to yet or had to get to yet. Hopefully, it’s a learning experience for us.”\n\nThose misses often led to run outs the other way, as Atlanta attacked the rim, and even when the Hawks weren’t pushing in transition they were using the Pistons’ extended pressure on the three-point line to carve our driving lanes in the half court.\n\nPoint guard Jeff Teague and Kent Bazemore and even, at times, Millsap, all took advantage, exasperating Van Gundy as he kept trying to get his defense to rotate to protect the rim. As well as Drummond had done that Friday night against Charlotte, he struggled against the Hawks.\n\nMillsap, and Al Horford, can both step out on the perimeter and make threes. Millsap can also put it on the floor, and the combo was too quick for Drummond and too strong for Tobias Harris.\n\nIn the second half, the Hawks quickly extended the lead and after a Teague three put Atlanta up by 19, the Pistons started the first of their desperate pushes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a three. Morris hit another. Harris cut to the rim hit a layup. Atlanta called a time-out.\n\nMillsap, who finished with 23 points, banked in a midrange jumper to stop the run, pushing the lead back to 13. The Pistons turned the ball over on the next possession, the Hawks hit a layup, and that was the end of that run.\n\n“That team has a lot to play for,” said Van Gundy. “They have really high aspirations. They understand what it’s all about. We are trying to learn that. (They) are starting to play like the team that won 60 last year.”\n\nThe Pistons' bench mounted the last run early in the fourth, and cut the lead to seven. But the Pistons couldn’t get closer than that, either missing a runner at the rim or giving up a lay-up or dunk at the other end.\n\nThe Hawks had made just five threes Friday night in their win over Milwaukee. The Pistons made seven Saturday night, but missed 22.\n\nHarris led the Pistons with 21 points and Drummond chipped in 19 and 17 rebounds.\n\nBazemore added 17 points for the Hawks, while former U-M standout Tim Hardaway Jr. had three points on 1-for-8 shooting in over 23 minutes.\n\n•Notebook: Aron Baynes scored 15 points against the Hawks, one night after scoring 16 in the Pistons blowout win over Charlotte. He scored 13 last Wednesday, in a win over Orlando.\n\nBaynes poured in 21 points the Saturday before that, against Brooklyn, most of those in the fourth quarter, when the Pistons pulled away. The backup center has been critical to the team’s late-season run – the Pistons were on a five-game winning streak entering tonight's game.\n\n“He’s a really good player,” said Van Gundy. “He’s real comfortable offensively right now. Playing at an extremely high level.”\n\nHis most valuable contribution may be as a free-throw shooter, so that when teams try to intentionally foul Drummond, Baynes can come in a take the pressure off. Though he hasn’t needed to as much lately.\n\nAgainst the Hornets on Friday, Drummond played with the sort of defensive swagger and energy he showed in the first month of the season. He was everywhere. And when he wasn’t, Baynes was there to fill in.\n\n“When they both play like (that), we usually have a pretty big advantage there,” said Van Gundy. “And we did (Friday) night.”"
