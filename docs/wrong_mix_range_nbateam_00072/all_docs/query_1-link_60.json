        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is a Georgia native playing for an NBA team in Michigan, Al Horford is a Michigan native playing for an NBA team in Georgia, and somewhere in their travels along and over Interstate 75, they came to agree on one thing.\n\n\"We have a playoff team,\" the soft-spoken Caldwell-Pope said of his Detroit Pistons late Wednesday. \"But my opinion, we're being average. We're not playing up to how we played to start the season off.\"\n\nThe season started in Caldwell-Pope's native state, with the Pistons drilling the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nIn the 68th game, Grand Ledge native Horford and the Hawks got some 118-114 payback and took a 2-1 season series lead in the opener of Detroit's nine-game homestand, which includes a rematch next week.\n\n\"That's a really good team over there,\" Horford said. \"They came out with a sense of urgency and were really focused. They are a playoff team. They are just fighting for their playoff lives right now.\"\n\nIt has become a riveting struggle with 14 games remaining.\n\nThe Pistons seemed to leave behind a 43-point loss two days earlier in Washington except for one lingering issue -- 118, 111, 124 and 118 points allowed the last four games.\n\nThose are the three highest-scoring regulation games by Pistons opponents all season, plus the modest 111 scored by the NBA-worst Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nCoach Stan Van Gundy, who generally is unfamiliar with one of his teams slipping defensively as a season progresses, has seen precisely that with his second Pistons team.\n\nCaldwell-Pope contained long-range deadeye Kyle Korver but no one contained Hawks point guards Jeff Teague and Dennis Schroder. The Pistons went with straight backcourt defensive matchups most of the game because of Korver's long-range threat, but Reggie Jackson and Steve Blake could not keep the Hawks' point guards from getting two feet in the lane, and there was minimal interior help once they did.\n\n\"We just can't find any answers,\" Van Gundy said. \"We're not guarding anybody. I mean, their point guards killed us tonight, 40 points and 16 assists. We can't have Pope guard everybody. Somebody else has got to be able to guard someone on the court.\"\n\nCaldwell-Pope marveled at how easily Teague and Schroder \"were just using screens to get into the lane\" as the Pistons' pick-and-roll defense got torched.\n\nThe Pistons' shooting guard is a high-level defender and close to elite. He limited Korver to one 3-pointer after the Atlanta ace had 19 in the previous seven games. But when Caldwell-Pope can't drag his teammates to their own heightened defensive awareness, he admits it can frustrate him.\n\n\"But I can't let that get me down,\" Caldwell-Pope said. \"I've just got to try to get them to feed off my energy and try to get their energy going.\"\n\nFor the first 37 games this season, through Jan. 9, the Pistons were close to elite defensively as a team, allowing less than a point per possession, a level maintained all season only by San Antonio and Atlanta. Opponents scored 100-plus points 14 times in those 37 games.\n\n\"We played for each other,\" Caldwell-Pope said. \"We were in the top 10 defensively.\"\n\nIn 31 games since, opponents have 22 games of 100-plus points, with the absolute worst of it beginning when Charlotte put up 118 last Friday.\n\nThrough the first 64 games of the season, the Pistons gave up three 30-point quarters in the same game just once, Jan. 29 vs. Cleveland. It has happened three more times in the last four games, with Atlanta the latest (30-31-26-31).\n\nThe Hawks (39-29) moved to fourth place in the East, which would mean home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs, while the ninth-place Pistons (34-34) remained percentage points behind the Chicago Bulls for the last playoff spot.\n\nJackson had a good game statistically with 17 points and 10 assists but that was rampant, with three players from each team collecting double-doubles.\n\nThe lack of point-guard defense and center help basically was the game. The Pistons hurt themselves with turnovers but so did the Hawks, with Detroit actually outscoring Atlanta 18-14 off of the giveaways.\n\n\"After a while, lack of communication at times, getting broke down, just not (staying with) our principles and not getting back,\" Jackson said of the defensive breakdowns. \"we've just got to be better, including myself.\"\n\nDrummond had 18 points and 18 rebounds but was neutralized by Horford (21 points, 11 rebounds) and the Hawks' attacking guards.\n\n\"They played fast,\" Drummond said. \"They were pretty much running fast breaks and taking the ball out as soon as they got it, it was just full speed up the floor. Down the stretch of the game we picked it up defensively but it just wasn't enough to come out with the win.\"\n\nThe Hawks used an intentional-foul strategy against Drummond which served little purpose for cutting into the lead until he left the game.\n\nIn the third quarter, when the Pistons had their biggest lead at 82-71, Horford grabbed a long rebound and made a 3-pointer to cut it to eight in what may have been the single biggest sequence of the game.\n\nThe Hawks immediately hacked Drummond, who missed two free throws and went to the bench, and Atlanta continued on what became a 16-2 run to regain the lead.\n\nThe Hawks acknowledged beforehand that they were wary of an opponent returning home from a four-game road trip after a 43-point loss.\n\n\"We knew exactly what was going to happen,\" Hawks forward Paul Millsap said. \"We knew they were going to come out with a chip on their shoulder coming off that loss. We actually did better than we expected. We had hands in their face. I think we played pretty good defense. They just played better offense.\"\n\nThe Pistons' 114 points were the fifth-most allowed by the Hawks in a regulation-length game.\n\nThe Pistons continue the longest homestand in franchise history with six games in nine days beginning with a Friday-Saturday back-to-back against Sacramento and Brooklyn. That is followed by games against Milwaukee Monday and Orlando Wednesday.\n\nNone of those four teams would be in the playoffs if the season ended today, and none has any realistic chance to qualify.\n\nIf the Pistons are who they say, a playoff team, those four games offer a critical opportunity to prove it.\n\n\"They're important, just like this game was important and we needed it,\" Caldwell-Pope said. \"So the next four games, we've got to take them real seriously. We can't play down to our opponent.\""
