        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers blew out the Detroit Pistons with a score of 128-96. LeBron James had an extremely effective night with a triple double of 16-12-11. Kyrie Irving razzled and dazzled in the first quarter with 15 points, and shooting perfect from deep. Iman Shumpert was very active tonight with 18 points on 8-11 shooting, and he had five rebounds to go along with it.\n\nWhat a first quarter to remember, the Cavs shot 85 percent from the field and 100 percent from the three-point line. LeBron was halfway to a triple-double, and the Cavs scored 44 points with ease. Following that first quarter, the Cavs continued to shoot perfect from behind the arc and made ten straight three-pointers until they had a miss.\n\nThe Cavs ended the first half with 74 points, and shot an astonishing 69 percent from the field and 78 percent from deep. This was not the only thing that was impressive within this game, LeBron achieved his fifth triple-double in his last eight games. LeBron has at least a double-double in the last nine games now, and is cranking it up for playoff time.\n\nThe new players within the team are acclimating themselves with the team at a very high pace. Deron Williams ended up with 13 points on 6-6 shooting, and is getting more and more comfortable on the roster. Derrick Williams is continuing to be a hype man, but also bringing up the offense another notch. Last but not least, J.R Smith is officially back and looking great with 12 points on 4-5 shooting.\n\nThe Cavs are still 1st in the Eastern Conference and leading the Boston Celtics by two games, with a record of 44-22. The Cavs have the third best home record in the league, but the playoffs will be featuring a very scary team. Kevin Love was around for shoot around this morning, Larry Sanders just signed, and Kyle Korver will be back soon. The Golden State Warriors have something to worry about with this Cleveland Cavalier team."
