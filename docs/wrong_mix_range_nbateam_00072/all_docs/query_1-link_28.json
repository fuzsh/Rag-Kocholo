        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nKyle Korver of the Atlanta Hawks broke Dana Barros’ NBA record Friday by making a three-point shot in his 90th consecutive game.\n\nHe even drew praise from LeBron James himself:\n\nAfter missing four straight games due to a rib contusion, Korver didn’t skip a beat against the Los Angeles Clippers on his three-point shooting quest.\n\nNot only did the shooting guard tie Barros’ record, but he also drained 6-of-9 threes for the game en route to a season-high 23 points.\n\nKorver’s streak started last season in Atlanta’s second game (a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder), per USA Today.\n\nOne of the league's most consistent outside shooters, Korver led the NBA in three-point percentage during the 2009-10 season as a member of the Utah Jazz.\n\nBarros—a 5’11” tweener guard out of Boston College—played 13 seasons in the NBA from 1989-90 to 2001-02 (he played one game during the 2003-04 season). He suited up for the Seattle Supersonics, Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons during his professional career.\n\nHe was named an All-Star and the league’s Most Improved Player for the 1994-95 season with the Sixers when he averaged 20.6 points and 7.5 assists per game (both career highs)."
