        "text": "Evan Sidery: Zaccharie Risacher, who will be under heavy consideration from the Hawks and Wizards atop the 2024 NBA Draft, put together a monster outing yesterday: 28 points in 29 minutes 5/7 on 3s Risacher has received comparisons from scouts to Michael Porter Jr. due to his perimeter shooting upside at 6-foot-10. Atlanta’s decision-makers — GM Landry Fields, Assistant GM Kyle Korver, HC Quin Snyder — flew out to watch Risacher this week in France.\n\nThere is no one stat that fully captures Sam Merrill’s new reality as one of basketball’s most valuable shooters, but this one comes close: He is attempting 17.7 3-pointers per 100 possessions this season, which is the highest mark of any player in history who has logged at least 300 minutes in a season. Merrill’s rate of attempts edges out Stephen Curry’s 2020-21 season as a plague-year Atlas (17.5) and James Harden’s 2018-19 attempt in Houston to break modern scoring and usage records (17.6)—all while he’s been shooting at a 43.2 percent clip. Or maybe it’s easier to think of Merrill as Double-Time Kyle Korver: He is attempting the same number of 3s per game as Korver did in 2014-15, his lone All-Star season, in nearly half the number of minutes. And while Korver hit some deep 3s in his career, he seldom ran into unconscionable 3s as he was pulling up from the edge of the center logo:"
