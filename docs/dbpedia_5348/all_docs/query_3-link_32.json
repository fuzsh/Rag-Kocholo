        "text": "Because of its location at the crossroads of Anatolia and its incorporation of different cultures and beliefs, the region of Phrygia attracted many foreign communities of Anatolia.Among those communities are the Phrygians who gave their name to the region. The Phrygians, who gathered and grew stronger in Central Anatolia in the ninth century BC, founded an eigth century kingdom whose capital was Gordion and whose cult center was Midaio. Another European community, the Galatians, settled in the area in the third century BC. The Romanization process of the region started in the second century BC. Although the impact of Rome became visible in terms of administration and urbanization, Phrygian culture and beliefs, first defined by the Phrygians but also influenced by the Galatians, survived in this period to the extent that the cult of Cybele (Magna Mater) penetrated the center of Rome. Though the spread of Christianity in the region dates back to the first century AD due to the travels of Paul, we confront real evidence of Christian influence (especially associated with the Montanism sect, with roots in the cult of Cybele) by the third century. In the early Byzantine period, Montanists were monitored closely by the state and were tried to be eliminated as an unwanted group. Available evidence shows that the believers continued to exist until the eighth-ninth centuries and eventually mixed with Paulicians and Athinganoi. The Paulicians and Athinganoi are also Christian sects, like Montanists, that found a place for themselves in Phrygia after also being marginalized and tried to be eliminated. Although there is abundant information about these groups in relation to their presence in the region of Phyrigia in the Byzantine period, there is no information about their cultural and artistic structure. However, rock architecture (especially as it concerns elements that do not seem to be “Byzantine” in the Byzantine period) may have features related to the diverse belief structures of the region. This paper will introduce and evaluate examples of such material cultural heritage that can be related to minorities in Phrygia during the Byzantine period.\n\nNew archival material relating to the discovery of the Flavia Sophe inscription is presented and arguments made that the inscription was discovered in situ. Careful attention to the epigraphical, palaeographical, and metrical aspects of the poem, as well as its use of nuptial imagery lead to new proposals for reconstructions. Arguments for a date in the second century are re-examined and strengthened. The language of the inscription is placed within the context of other Greek funeral epigrams to show that the writer of the epigram was well aware of the conventions Hellenistic funeral poetry and that the poem artfully subverts many of these conventions. And finally, I argue that for this group of Christians, the \"bridal chamber\" ritual was a mortuary rite."
