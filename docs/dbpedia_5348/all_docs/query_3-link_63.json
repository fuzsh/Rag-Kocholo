Şehir araştırmaları ve şehircilik faaliyetlerinin günümüz dünyasında önemli bir yere sahip olması ve Tokat şehrinin coğrafi bakımdan araştırmakta geç kalınmış önemli şehirlerden biri olması böyle bir çalışmanın yapılması gerekliliğini doğurmuştur. Bu amaç doğrultusunda öncelikli olarak şehrin kurulduğu ilk nüve belirlenmiş ve arşiv belgelerindeki nüfus ve yerleşme kayıtları yardımıyla şehrin gelişim yönleri saptanmıştır. Daha sonra ise gelişim yönü üzerinde etkili olan coğrafi faktörler irdelenmiştir. Gelişim süreci içerisinde Osmanlı dönemi, şehir için ayrı bir önem arz ettiğinden bu bölüme nispeten daha fazla yer ayrılmış, XVI. ve XVIII. yüzyılda şehri ziyaret eden seyyahların görüşlerinden de sıkça faydalanılmıştır.\n\nBir şehir coğrafyasında yerleşim alanındaki nüfus ve yerleşmenin nitelikleri, çalışmadaki en mühim bilgileri ihtiva ettiğinden özellikle Osmanlı dönemi ve Cumhuriyet döneminde bahsi geçen noktalar titizlikle incelenmiştir. Şehirdeki ekonomik faaliyet türleri ve bu kollarda çalışan kişi sayısı da şehir çalışmalarında dikkat çeken bir diğer unsurdur. Bu konuda da Osmanlı dönemindeki ticari hayat yine aynı başlık altında alt başlıklara ayrılarak detaylı bir biçimde ele alınmış, günümüzde şehirde görülen ekonomik faaliyet türleri ve özelliklerine ise üçüncü bölümde ayrı bir yer verilmiştir. Coğrafyanın mekanla ilişkili bir bilim dalı olması, elbette bu bilimi diğer dallardan ayıran en önemli özelliktir. Bu sebepten üçüncü bölümde şehir fonksiyonları, fonksiyon alanlarıyla örtüştürülerek verilen bilgilerin mekanla ilişkisi üzerinde durulmuştur.\n\nYapılan bu çalışma sonucunda yaklaşık 1600 yıldır varlığını devam ettiren bu şehrin yıllar içinde zaman zaman abad olup şahlanırken zaman zaman yok olmanın eşiğine geldiği görülmektedir. Böyle bir döngü içinde Anadolu’nun önemli yerleşim yerlerinden biri olan Tokat’ın şu an için yıldızı sönmüş gibi görünse de barındırdığı tarihi birikim, özgün kimlik ve doğal coğrafi faktörler nedeniyle kısa bir süre içerisinde tekrar mamur olması ve dünyadaki önemli turizm ve ticaret noktalarından biri olması beklenmektedir.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study was carried out to investigate the natural and human geographicalfactors affecting the establishment and development of Tokat city which is theadministrative center of Tokat province and the population, settlement, function andfunction areas of the city. The fact that city researches and urbanization activities havean important place in today's world and that Tokat city is one of the important citiesthat are late to investigate geographically, has necessitated such a study. For thispurpose, the first core of the city was determined and the directions of development ofthe city were determined with the help of population and settlement records in archivaldocuments. Later on, geographical factors that have an effect on developmentdirection were examined. As the Ottoman period in the development process was ofspecial significance for the city, this chapter has been given more importance and theviews of the travellers who visited the city in the XVI and XVIII centuries have beenfrequently used. As the population of the settlement area and the characteristics of thesettlement contain the most important information about the work in a geographicalregion, the points that mentioned in the Ottoman period and the Republican periodwere examined carefully. The types of economic activity in the city and the number ofpeople working in these areas are also another factor that attract attention in citystudies.In this respect, the commercial life in the Ottoman period was also dividedinto sub-headings under the same heading in a detailed way. Today, the types andfeatures of economic activity seen in the city are given a separate place in the thirdsection. The fact that geography is a scientific discipline associated with space isdefinitely the most important feature that separates this science from other branches.Therefore, in the third chapter, the relationship between the functions of the city andthe information given by covering them with the function areas is emphasized.\n\nIV As a result of this work, it has been observed that this city, which has been inexistence for about 1600 years, has become properous from time to time during theyears and has come to the brink of disappearing from time to time. In such a cycle,Tokat which is one of the most important settlements of Anatolia seems to be like adull star, but due to the history, unique identity and natural geographical factors, it hasto be rebuilt in a short time and become one of the important tourism and trade pointsin the world as it is expected.\n\nKey Words:\n\nCity of Tokat, Urban Geography, Urban Development, Function of City,Urbanization, Settlement Geography, Settlement History\n\nBodrog County is one of the tragic fate counties of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Its history is typical, its medieval population and settlement network were almost completely destroyed in the 16th century, and most of its medieval resources disappeared. For this reason, the historical geographic research of Bodrog County is a major challenge.\n\nThe aim of my research is to reconstruct the medieval settlement network of Bodrog County; to summarize the general history of Bodrog County, with special regard to the medieval and early modern administration and the changes in the settlement boundaries.\n\nThis multidisciplinary research is based on written, pictorial and field-based archaeological, ethnographic, historical and geographical data. The most important element of the research is a GIS system developed for geographical settlement modeling, in which literature and field data, furthermore various remote sensing and map data were summarized and evaluated. Another unique methodological element of the research is the so-called “social archeology”, which provided a wealth of data during intensive archaeological field research.\n\nThe fact that Bodrog County is located partly in the southern part of present-day Hungary and in the northern part of present-day Serbia has made the research more difficult. The size of the county changed several times during its slightly more than five-centuries-long existence. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, its area stretched from the Danube to the Tisza River in an east-west direction, and from the present Kiskunhalas in the north to Verbász (Vrbas, Serbia) and Szenttamás (Srbobran, Serbia) in Bačka in the south.\n\nThe result of this research is a database of medieval settlements in Bodrog County, including maps and aerial imagery available from archaeological research and the literature to the present day. Simultaneously, the development of a printed and online database of the collected data has begun. The primary purpose is to make this database available to professionals and civil users.\n\nThe research has revealed that many of the written sources of Bodrog County have been lost over time. However, compared to the surrounding counties, there are many medieval documents that contain a lot of useful geographical data suitable for settlement modeling.\n\n\"\"\"The aim of the paper is to present the administrative and territorial transformations of Macedonia from the 4th to the 6th century AD.

The research object is the cartographic documentation of these transformations and the presentation of the settlement network of the two administrative provinces Macedonia I and Macedonia II with emphasis on the 6th century.\n\nThree historical cross‐sections have been attempted, combining primary sources and secondary bibliography, in order to clarify the administrative conditions in the 4th, 5th c. and the 6th c.. The control of sources with the aid of the most updated archaeological reference tool, allows the location and hierarchization of 38 cities (polis) and 57 towns and villages (kome – vicus).\n\nA further research object concerns the description and understanding of settlement clusters and networks hierarchy and the explanation of their location. The latter is related to site catchment analysis on the regional level and environmental limitations and historical acts in the 6th century. A digital terrain model has been designed in order to support and illustrate the analytical process. An accompanying database was also constructed in order to complement the cartographic model and classify the settlements according to historical and geographical criteria.\n\nThe first set of criteria is related to parameters and variables such as the date of foundation, continuous presence in five distinct historical periods, ancient and modern place names.\n\nThe second set is related to the location of the settlement and uses parameters and variables such as geomorphology, water elements, communication networks and presence of a nodal point or port.\n\nThe final goal of the paper is a better comprehension of the historical‐geographical landscapes that constituted Macedonia in Late Antiquity. It is argued that the combination of the above mentioned methodological techniques facilitates and improves the historical and geographical perception of the area and the communication networks that were formed and transformed by the interaction between human agents, cultural factors and natural barriers.\"\"\"\n\nHaving a long history of settlement, Anatolia has a distinctive role in settlement geography.

Despite the fact that people may cause changes in physical environment in various other ways, the conversion of physical geographic expression into a cultural geographic expression had been realized most vigorously where people were settled in. Therefore, through history the settlements have been the focus of all branches of the social sciences and have been researched. Most especially, it has been at the core of history and geography and has become one of their most popular research topics. Being situated at the crossroads of three continents geographically, Turkey has attracted various civilizations since ancient times and increased the significance of settlements in here. Researches of settlements as a field of social studies have been one of the significant issues those should be handed down the rising generations. Increasing the academic knowledge level of social studies teacher candidates who are to pass these issues on rising genereations, constitutes our subject matter. For that purpose, an activity was organized within the context of a technical visit of 30 third grade students from Faculty of Education Department of Elementary School Division of Social Sciences Education, 10 of which were female and 20 male, within the scope of settlement geography, a sub-branch of Human and Economic Geography of Turkey, an excursion-observation activity at Konya (Çumra) Çatalhöyük, where we have grown wheat grass beforehand. Also the students were instructed via a descriptive study which was vocalized in order to emphasize the agricultural activities that have been initialized with the historical basis of Anatolia and human settlement in here.\n\nWhy compare Europe’s largest brick building to Europe’s most infamous refugee camp?

To the casual observer the two spaces could not be more different.\n\nThe answer starts with Edward Soja:\n\n“It may indeed be both the best of times and the worst of times to be studying cities. For while there is so much that is new and challenging to respond to, there is much less agreement than ever before as to how best to make sense, practically and theoretically, of the new urban worlds being created.” (Soja 2000: xii in Brenner, Marcuse and Mayer 2011 p117)\n\nMaybe we need to take urbanism to where it feels less comfortable. In Cities for people, Not for Profit (2011) Brenner, Marcuse and Mayer call for a more adventurous urbanism that attempts to widen the argument. (Brenner, Marcuse, Mayer 2011) In a time that is seeing an “.. intensification of polarization, inequality, marginalisation, dispossession and social conflict” Marcuse asks “...do we really know, today, where the “urban” begins and ends, or what its most essential features are…?” (Brenner, Marcuse, Mayer 2011 p118)\n\nThe Battersea Power Station Development (also referred to here as BPS) and the Jungle are two extreme examples of human settlement. BPS is a top-down regeneration development, the Jungle is a bottom-up illegal camp. In this way they bookend one schematic of the urban, from top to bottom. However, the two sites have more in common than the casual observer may appreciate; both sites were built on polluted industrial land, both sites have attracted critical media attention and both sites seek to house a specific demographic.\n\nTo make sense of these similarities and differences, we need to utilise an academic discipline which is studied often in German, but neglected in English; that of settlement geography. Settlement geography is outlined by T. G Jorden as “...the description and analysis of the distribution of buildings by which people attach themselves to the land.” (Jordan 1966 p26) By considering BPS and the Jungle in terms of settlement geography we can begin to get a sense of the complex systems and which hold the two in place, not only in a spatial configuration, but also within the British cultural imagination.\n\nThis dissertation revolves around a specific national ideology, and it considers the nation as an “imagined community” as detailed by Benedict Anderson (Anderson 1991) but all the while, the global scale must be remembered. The BPS Regeneration project is a £9bn, 42 acre, flagship project in the heart of London. (White 2016) It is one of the biggest of its kind in the world, however it is only a small part of the pan-London regeneration programme, which is only one city in a pan-Europe and increasingly global trend. Equally, the Jungle grew to an estimated population of 9000 and caused unrest within the political establishment in the UK and France, however it pales into insignificance when compared to camps in Kos, Kenya and Sudan. (Henderson-Howat, Welander 2016) It also represents a growth of what Mike Davis calls the “post-urban structures” (Davis 2007 p107) of the global poor and displaced, a pattern he expands upon in his excellent book Planet of Slums. (Davis 2007)\n\nTherefore, we can assume that comparisons between top-down and bottom-up spaces are evident across multiple geographies, all within their own specific systems of settlement geography and cultural imagination.\n\nThis essay is divided up into three parts; systems, territories and units. Under these headings, my aim is to contextualise cultural similarities, highlight social constructions and identify pockets of resistance. I have not presented BPS and the Jungle as individual case studies, nor have I had the chance to fully explore the vastly complex global processes of migration, globalisation, war and international politics that shape them. Rather than focus on area, I have focussed on flows, patterns and narratives.\n\nThroughout this dissertation there is one overarching construction. It manifests as a binary between order and chaos, and it has been at the heart of the debate around urban development since the dawn of the modern post-war era. (Jacobs 1992) This order/chaos binary is summed up perfectly by Jane Jacobs in two quotes in her seminal The Death and Life of Great American Cities. (Jacobs 1992)\n\nOn order: “There is a quality even meaner than out­right ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring to support the order that is struggling to exist and to be served.” (Jacobs 1992 p15)\n\nOn chaos: “To see complex systems of functional order as order, and not as chaos, takes understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn, the interior of an aeroplane engine, the entrails of a dissected rabbit, the city desk of a newspaper, all appear to be chaos if they are seen without comprehension. Once they are understood as systems of order, they actually look different.” (Jacobs 1992 p376)\n\nOrder vs chaos is an urban meta-narrative, synonymous with top-down and bottom-up approaches. I hope to show the ideological progression of this ideological dialectic and the prevalence it has over urbanism today.\n\nCenturipe is a town and comune in the province of Enna (Sicily, southern Italy).

The city is 61 kilometres (38 mi) from Enna in the hill country between the Rivers Dittaìno and Salso.\n\nThere are caves for sulphur and salt mineral, and water springs.\n\nThis may indicate that the subsurface is organic in nature. Petrified body or prehistoric rootsystem.\n\nIt became an ally of the Athenians at the time of their expedition against Syracuse, and maintained its independence almost uninterruptedly (though it fell under the power of Agathocles) until the First Punic War when it immediately submitted to the Romans. It was thus granted Latin Rights before the rest of Sicily and was a civitas immunis ac libera sine foedere (free city exempted from tax).\n\nIn the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC Centuripe Ware was a distinctive class of Sicilian vase painting, with the unusual feature of fully coloured painting in tempera applied after firing was complete.\n\nCicero described it, perhaps with some exaggeration, as being by far the largest and richest city of Sicily, and as having a population of 10,000, engaged in the cultivation of an extensive territory. It appears to have suffered much in the war against Sextus Pompeius because of its loyalty to Octavian, but Octavian reconstructed and gave the inhabitants Roman citizenship.\n\nThe Imperial Roman age has left the most impressive monumental remains. Grandiose monumental ruins, a rich complex of sculptures, numerous inscriptions: a whole series of elements seem to mark the accomplishments of a local family that, in the 2nd century, came to express a consul, a son of one of the components of the entourage of the emperor Hadrian. A large number of monumental remains were lost forever due to the neglect of the past and systematic theft and plundering for collectors and collections of every where. It gradually declined in the late Empire.\n\nEmperor Frederick II entirely destroyed the city in 1233 in punishment for its rebellion, the inhabitants deported to Augusta. King Charles I of Anjou razed it completely to the ground, and the city was rebuilt only in 1548 by Francesco Moncada.\n\nThe city was known as Centorbi until 1863. In 1943 during World War II and the liberation of Sicily the Battle of Centuripe saw the town captured spectacularly from the defending Germans by the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade although it suffered some damage.\n\n- notice the resemblance to the word 'Golgotha' The medieval Calcata is perched on a rocky plateau which dominates the wood-covered valley of Treja, between Rome and Viterbo.

The historic center is not open to cars and you can enter it through an arched double gateway surmounted by the crenelated walls of the baronial Palazzo Anguillara.\n\nSince the XIII century BC, as shown by the nearby archaeological settlement of Narce, it was an important Faliscan centre (Falisci was ancient Italian tribe who lived in what are now southern Tuscany and northern Latium. They spoke an Italic language, Faliscan, closely akin to Latin).\n\nThe Falisci settled around a great part of the Tiber area, and later moved to the souther Etruria in a zone called Agro Falisco. Further on this population went under the political, cultural and even artistic Etruscan rule. The arcopolis of Narce used to rise on top of the hill overlooking the River Treja, and shows important findings dating back to different ages.\n\nTwo elements make this place so fascinating: religion and esotericism! Every 31st of October, it is celebrated the local \"Notte delle Streghe\" (night of the witches) and in occasion of the Summer Solstice – St Giovanni's eve – the \"Circolo Vegetariano di calcata\" celebrates the Magica Notte delle Streghe, recalling pagan rites, archaic music and dances, contemplation of nature.\n\nThe parish church preserves the relics of the Holy Prepuce, and a cruet containing the oil used to grease Jesus Christ's feet.\n\nCalcata is today a picturesque medieval village, one of the best kept around that area, with narrow alleys winding among small houses and ancient cellars, recently restored and used to house souvenirs, antiquities and artisan's shops. Paying attention you can still admire the ancient windows, portals and famous medieval \"profferli\" (external ramps), some of the mixed to the modern constructions.\n\nThen you see courtyards, cats sitting on ramps and window sills, terraces looking over the valley and you are immersed in silence: This is Calcata, where time seems to stand still. The old inhabitants have given way to artists, writers and scholars coming to Calcata from everywhere in the world, with the aim to fully enjoy that evoking peace and tranquillity. Calcata does not offer great monuments, except for the castle (currently under restoration works), but many small elements... a magic mix that makes it so special!\n\n---\n\nAccording to legends of the village of Calcata, in 1527 a soldier in the German army sacking Rome looted the Sanctum sanctorum.\n\nWhen he was eventually captured in the village, he hid the jeweled reliquary containing the Holy Prepuce in his cell, where it was discovered in 1557.\n\nIt was officially venerated by the Catholic Church in Calcata since that time, with the Vatican's offering a ten-year indulgence to pilgrims. Calcata became a popular site for pilgrimage.\n\nAgain in 1856, however, the Charroux Abbey rediscovered what it considered to be the true Holy Prepuce, which it claimed to have received from Charlemagne.\n\nIt had been lost for centuries. The rediscovery led to a theological clash with people over the established Holy Prepuce of Calcata, which had been officially venerated by the Church for hundreds of years. In 1900, the Catholic Church solved the dilemma by ruling that anyone writing or speaking of the Holy Prepuce would be excommunicated. In 1954, after much debate, the punishment was changed to the harsher degree of excommunication, vitandi (shunned). Later the Second Vatican Council removed the Day of the Holy Circumcision from the church calendar in its review of holy days and obligations.\n\nIn reality, it was more than two years before 11 October 1962, the date when the Second Vatican Council began, that a 25 July 1960 decree of Pope John XXIII[6] enacted a wide-ranging revision of the General Roman Calendar, which included changing the name of the 1 January feast from \"Circumcision of the Lord and Octave of the Nativity\" to \"Octave of the Nativity\", with no change of the Gospel reading about the circumcision of the child Jesus.\n\nRoger Peyrefitte, in his novel Les Clés de Sainte Pierre (1955), written using information attributed to Mgr Léon Gromier (1879–1965), Canon of St. Peter's, gives details of the 1954 discussion of such relics and of a pilgrimage to Calcata, including what appears to be an authentic description of the relic as: \"two greyish membranes with an undertone of pink, curled into balls\" lying on a crystal disk.\n\nCalcata continued to stage an annual procession on the Day of the Holy Circumcision to honor the relic. In 1983, however, parish priest Dario Magnoni announced, \"This year, the holy relic will not be exposed to the devotion of the faithful.\n\nIt has vanished. Sacrilegious thieves have taken it from my home.\"\n\nHe had reportedly kept it in a shoebox in the back of a wardrobe. Citing the Vatican's decree of excommunication, Magnoni refuses to further discuss the event, as does the Vatican.\n\nAs a result, villagers' theories of the crime vary from theft for lucrative resale to an effort by the Vatican to quietly put an end to the practice it had attempted to end by excommunication years ago. Some residents speculate that Magnoni may have been the culprit."
