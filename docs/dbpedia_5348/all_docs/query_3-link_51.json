        "text": "The origins of the Kurds have been heavily mythologised over the centuries. For example, one of the best known stories of ancient Persian folklore suggests Kurds are the descendants of children rescued from Zahhak, a fantastical tyrant who reputedly devoured the brains of his victims.\n\nIn more recent times, the lineage of the Kurds has been linked to various peoples inhabiting the northern Zagros, a mountain range stretching across Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Ancient historians speculate that the ancestors of the Kurdish people are the Carduchoi tribes from this region who in 401 BCE fought against the ‘Ten Thousand’, a Greek mercenary army described in Xenophon’s Anabasis, or that they are descendants of the Cyrti, who are mentioned by the Greek and Roman classical scholars Polybius, Livy, and Strabo. However, the most common, although unproven, theory is that the Kurds are the descendants of the Medes, an ancient people who dominated much of Persia between the years 678 and 549 BCE.\n\nIt was not until the rise of Islam in the 7th century that the term ‘Kurd’ became widely used, initially by Arabs who used the word as a generic name for ‘nomadic tribes’. Early Arabic accounts of the Muslim conquests of Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa note that Kurdish tribes resist the armies of Islam from the mountains of Kurdistan until sometime between the 630s and 640s. Yet after suffering defeat, most Kurds from these tribes convert to Islam in the following centuries.\n\nThis mass conversion to Islam helps the Kurds integrate into the broader Islamic world, where many Kurdish leaders achieve positions of power. In fact, after the disintegration of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th century (a period of Arab rule over the Middle East that many associate with the Islamic Golden Age), a number of Kurdish chieftains implement self-rule in their homelands. The most significant are the Shaddadids (951 to 1174) in Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Rawwidids (955 to 1071) in Azerbaijan, the Marwanids (990 to 1096) in Diyarbakir and Lake Van, and the Hasanwayhids (959 to 1095) in western Iran.\n\nWhen the Turkish Seljuk dynasty arrive in the region during the 11th century they establish themselves as the pre-eminent power in the eastern Islamic world and launch campaigns against independent Kurdish chieftains. Thereafter, Kurdish tribes are often integrated into the armies of the various Turkic states formed in the wake of the invasions by the Seljuk empire, with some Kurds becoming powerful and influential.\n\nThe most successful Kurdish leader in this era is Saladin (r. 1174 to 1193), also known as Saladin Ayyubi, who was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. In Egypt, Saladin overthrows the ruling Fatimids, goes on to eject the European Christian Crusaders from Jerusalem and establishes an empire that stretches from Egypt in northern Africa to Mosul in the Middle East. The reign of the Ayyubids across large parts of the western Islamic world marks the historical peak of Kurdish power in the Middle East.\n\nThe ascendancy of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty is relatively brief, however. In 1250, a revolt of Turkish slave-soldiers called Mamluks (‘Mamluk’ being the Arabic word for ‘property’), upon whom Saladin’s descendants had relied to maintain their rule, usurp the Ayyubids in Egypt. Some Ayyubids remain in Syria but their power is weakened by the Mongol invasions of West Asia, and eventually their lands fall to the Mamluks as well.\n\nThe Ayyubids are one of a number of Kurdish princely dynasties that continue to dominate Kurdistan, a region over which the Ayyubids, even at the heights of their power, are never able to secure in its entirety.\n\nThe Kurdish princelings occupy mountainous homelands that separate the empires of the Mongols in Persia and the Mamluks in Egypt. Subsequently, both the Mongols and the Mamluks try to enlist the support of Kurdish tribesmen, with the Mamluks even attempting to appoint a supreme commander of the Kurds, with the idea they would fight their Mongol enemies on their behalf. By trading their support the Kurdish dynasties are able to maintain a degree of liberty.\n\nIn the late 14th century the Middle East is shaken by the invasions of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur Lang (‘Timur the Lame’). However, while many parts of Kurdistan are devastated by his army, Timur Lang’s dynasty proves even less stable than that of the Mongols.\n\nBy 1450 much of Kurdistan is occupied by rival federations known as the Black Sheep Turkmen and the White Sheep Turkmen. But these occupations prove to be temporary and Kurdish noble houses and tribal chieftains are allowed to govern their own affairs by their Turkmen overlords, provided they remain loyal.\n\nSummaries by DJENE RHYS BAJALAN – historian, Missouri State University\n\nIn the early 16th century, perhaps the most powerful Kurdish noble house belongs to the Rojiki princes of the principality of Bitlis. During the reign of Sultan Selim I the Rojiki clan’s patriarch, Mir Sharaf, forges a close alliance with the Ottoman Empire. However, under Sultan Selim’s successor, Sultan Süleyman I (r. 1520 to 1566), better known in the Western world as ‘Suleyman the Magnificent’, the relationship between Bitlis’s ruling house and the sultan deteriorates.\n\nIn 1531, on the eve of renewed Ottoman campaigning against the Safavid dynasty of Persia, the sultan appoints a Safavid defector, the former governor-general of Azerbaijan, to the governorship of the city of Bitlis above Mir Sharaf. Olama Beg Takkalu is granted this position after promising Sultan Süleyman he will help the Ottomans conquer Iranian Azerbaijan. Thereafter, Ottoman sources suggest Mir Sharaf revolts against imperial rule, although the grandson of the Bitlisi prince later claims he had no intention of betraying Sultan Süleyman and was forced to flee by Olama Beg Takkalu’s scheming.\n\nWhichever is the case, Mir Sharaf switches his allegiance to the Persian Empire and spends his final years under Safavid protection. Shah Ismail’s successor, Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524 to 1576), learns from his father’s mistakes – mistakes that had cost the Safavids control of much of Kurdistan – and adopts a more lenient approach in dealing with the Kurds, no doubt recognising their importance in protecting Iran’s western approaches.\n\nAs the heir of a leading Kurdish noble house, Mir Sharaf is treated with great respect by the Shah. Indeed, both Mir Sharaf’s son, Shams ad-Din and his grandson Sharaf Khan, spend much of their lives as members of the Safavid court.\n\nSharaf Khan spends his early years in the imperial household under the protection of Shah Tahmasp I (r. 1524 to 1576) and is even educated alongside the Shah’s own children. At the age of 12, the Shah bestows upon him the title of emir of the Kurds, a rank he holds for three years.\n\nFollowing the accession of Shah Tahmasp’s son, Shah Ismail II (r. 1576 to 1578), to the Persian throne, Sharaf Khan is again honoured, becoming amir al-omara al-akrad (‘the supreme commander of the Kurds’), a position responsible for representing the interests of the multitude of Kurdish nobles and chieftains at the Safavid court.\n\nHowever, palace intrigue ultimately results in Sharaf Khan’s dismissal from the Persian court and he is appointed governor of Nakhchivan, far from the centre of Safavid power.\n\nThis proves Sharaf Khan’s final appointment in service to the Safavids. In 1578, after serving for just over a year in the position, he receives an imperial warrant from the Ottoman Sultan Murad III (r. 1574 to 1595) restoring him to the hereditary governorship of Bitlis. And so, on 3 December 1578, Sharaf Khan deserts his post and makes for the Ottoman-held city of Van.\n\nSharaf Khan spends the next 10 years campaigning against his former patrons for which the Ottomans reward him with additional lands and titles, including dominion over the town of Muş, to the east of present day Turkey.\n\nThe 18th century is a time of substantial change in the Middle East. The Safavid dynasty of Persia is overthrown in 1736 and its new ruler, Nadir Shah (r. 1736 to 1747), an ethnic Turk from Khorasan, re-establishes Persian power in the region. He drives the Ottomans from western Iran and successfully invades the Moghul Empire of Central Asia.\n\nHowever, following his death, Persia again falls into political chaos before Karim Khan Zand (r. 1751 to 1779), a member of the Luri community of western Iran, asserts his authority. Although his relationship with the various Kurdish tribes is complex, Karim Khan Zand maintains a close relationship with the House of Ardalan. After the pro-Ottoman Baban Kurds successfully occupy much of the Ardalan fiefdom in 1774, the Persian ruler dispatches his forces to restore the Ardalans to power.\n\nWhile less dramatic, the transformations that take place in the Ottoman Empire are no less significant. On the one hand the century witnesses systematic efforts by the Ottomans to settle nomadic Kurdish tribes and integrate them into the political life of the imperial state. Yet on the other Ottoman governance in the 18th century is also defined by the weakening of its central authority.\n\nDynasties of local notables (‘ayan’) throughout the Ottoman Empire establish control of provincial government in this period, and some Kurdish clans are also able to expand their power and influence. Perhaps the most successful of these are the Babans who by the end of the 18th century emerge as the dominant power across much of southern Kurdistan, ruling from their purpose built capital of Sulaimaniya.\n\nPart of the success of the House of Baban can be attributed to the family’s status as Ottoman vassals. However, the Babans are also successful in exploiting tensions between the Ottomans and the Mamluk dynasty of Iraq, which consolidated hereditary control over Baghdad in 1704.\n\nThe rise of the Babans has cultural as well as political implications. In earlier centuries, Kurdish literary culture had been dominated by the Kurmanji dialect of the Kurdish language within Ottoman Kurdistan and also the Gurani dialect in those regions governed by the Ardalans. The Babans change this by promoting their own dialect, which is known as Babani (and is today referred to as Sorani). They do so by patronising poets and scholars who write in the Babani dialect, and thus lay the foundations for a modern Sorani literary culture across much of what will later become the Kurdistan Region.\n\nThe history of the Middle East in the 19th century is defined by the emerging global dominance of the European Great Powers – who at this point consist of the empires of Austria, Britain, France, Prussia and Russia – and the efforts of the Ottoman and Persian empires to adapt to a changing international political order in the wake of European industrialisation. These dynamics have a profound effect on the relationship between the Kurds and their imperial overlords as well as on Kurdish society more generally.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, both the Ottoman Empire and the Qajar dynasty, which had seized the Iranian throne towards the end of the previous century, seek to reform their administrations along European lines. Both attempt to establish central government authority over the peripheries of their empires by creating standardised forms of administration. And in each case, these policies draw their authors into conflict with the various Kurdish princes and tribal leaders operating within imperial borders, who attempt to maintain and expand their traditional privileges and liberties.\n\nThe best known example of such resistance occurs in the 1840s, when Bedir Khan Bey, the ruler of the Cizre-Bohtan principality, leads a coalition of Kurdish princes and tribal leaders against Ottoman forces. Although Bedir Khan is able to resist Ottoman military pressure for a number of years, he is captured in 1846 and replaced by a centrally appointed Ottoman official. A similar fate befalls other Kurdish principalities, and the process of administrative centralisation in Ottoman Kurdistan is completed – at least on paper – by 1851.\n\nQajar policies to centralise and reform the governorship of Iranian Kurdistan are implemented more slowly, yet by the mid 1860s the Persian Empire dissolves the Kurdish principality of Ardalan. Although the emirates that had played such an important role in Kurdish affairs in previous centuries are abolished, imperial control over much of Kurdistan remains tenuous at best, however, and the Ottomans and Safavids struggle to govern Kurdish regions effectively.\n\nThis is particularly the case in Ottoman Kurdistan, where tribal Kurds frequently resent Ottoman efforts to extract taxes and impose conscription upon them.\n\nMany Kurdish Muslims are also alienated by the efforts of the Ottoman government to establish legal equality for Muslims and non-Muslims, as well as the growing European political and cultural influence in the Near and Middle East. They believe these parallel developments threaten the traditional social and political superiority of Islam in the Kurdish regions.\n\nThis growing Kurdish resentment towards the modernising policies of the Ottoman Empire facilitates the rise of Kurdistan’s Sufi sheikhs, the spiritual leaders of Kurdish society. With the fall of Kurdistan’s principalities and the weakness of the Ottoman and Qajar central governments, the Sufi sheikhs rise to political prominence. Their ascent to power culminates in the Sheikh Ubeydullah revolt of the early 1880s, a rebellion directed against both the Ottoman and Qajar governments in Hakkâri and then Urmia, which are located in present day Turkey and Iran respectively. Yet the Ottomans suppress the revolt and Sheikh Ubeydullah is ultimately exiled to Hijaz in present day Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe rebellion marks the emergence of modern Kurdish nationalism, however, with Sheikh Ubeydullah seeking to establish a Kurdish state consisting of territories within both Ottoman and Iranian Kurdistan.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sheikh Ubeydullah revolt, the new Ottoman ruler, Sultan Abdülhamid II, forms the Hamidiye Cavalry Regiments, a militia drawn from amongst the Kurdish tribes. The sultan hopes that the privileges afforded by Hamadiye membership within Ottoman society will secure the loyalty of the Kurds. To a certain degree the policy proves a success, as the Ottoman Empire does not face a major Kurdish insurrection for the remainder of the century. Nevertheless, the Hamidiye Cavalry Regiments gain international notoriety thanks to their involvement in extensive anti-Armenian violence in the mid 1890s.\n\nBedir Khan Bey comes to power in the Cizre-Bohtan emirate in 1835 following the removal of his cousin, Seyfeddin Bey, by the Ottoman governor–general of Diyarbakir Reşid Mehmed Pasha. He initially secures his position through cooperation with the Ottoman authorities. However, following the Battle of Nizip in 1839, Bedir Khan emerges as the dominant force in central Kurdistan and the leader of Kurdish resistance against Ottoman efforts to assert their authority in the region.\n\nIn 1840, Bedir Khan forms a series of alliances with a number of other Kurdish emirs, most notably Khan Mahmoud of Müküs (today known as Bahçesaray in eastern Turkey) and Nurullah Bey of the Hakkâri region. He proves an active reformer, raising the levels of elite military units under his personal command and establishing a centralised judicial system within his territories.\n\nBedir Khan’s rise to political prominence causes consternation amongst Ottoman officials and they quickly seek to undermine his power and influence. In 1842 the Ottoman government attempts to divide his territories by transferring the administrative jurisdiction of Cizre from Diyarbakır to Mosul. In response, Bedir Khan openly rebels and begins minting coins in his name. Bedir Khan even replaces the sultan’s name with his own during the recital of the Friday prayers, an important symbol of sovereignty in the Islamic tradition.\n\nBedir Khan’s revolt against Ottoman rule continues for five years and his actions even attract the interest of the Great Powers of Europe following his massacre of Nestorian Christians in 1843 and 1846.\n\nThe Ottoman armies are initially repelled by Bedir Khan’s forces. However, Bedir Khan is forced to retreat in 1846 after his nephew Yezdan Sher takes the side of the Ottomans against him. The Ottomans turn Yezdan Sher, one of Bedir Khan’s leading army commanders, by offering him the rulership of the Bohtan principality in his uncle’s stead. Meanwhile, Khan Mahmoud of Müküs is captured by the Ottomans while assisting Bedir Khan’s escape. He is later exiled to the Balkans.\n\nCornered in his fortress at Eruh (situated in the south east of modern day Turkey), Bedir Khan resists a siege by Ottoman and rival Kurdish tribes for many months. However, with his supplies and ammunition depleting, the emir of Cizre–Bohtan is forced to sue for peace, negotiating a surrender on condition of honourable treatment.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire subsequently exiles Bedir Khan from Kurdistan, first sending him to the Greek island of Crete and later to Damascus, located in present day Syria. They keep their promise to treat him honourably and his numerous children are educated in the elite schools and colleges of the Ottoman Empire, with many going on to enjoy successful careers in the Ottoman bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, Nurallah Bey, having abandoned his erstwhile allies, remains in Hakkâri until 1849 when the Ottomans remove him from office and send him into exile.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Russo–Ottoman War of 1877 to 1878, tribal unrest and famine plague the Ottoman Empire’s eastern provinces. Ottoman officials are unable to deal with growing anti-government sentiment amongst the Kurds, which is further aggravated by rumours that the Great Powers are seeking to establish an Armenian kingdom. It is within the context of this growing chaos, that Sheikh Ubeydullah, the patriarch of the Sadat-ı Nehri clan, launches an uprising against both the Ottoman and Qajar governments.\n\nIn August 1879 Ubeydullah leads the first stage of his revolt in Hakkâri, with tribes loyal to him clashing with Ottoman forces in the district’s southeast. The fighting is inconclusive, but Sheikh Ubeydullah’s following continues to grow.\n\nIn spring the following year, Sheikh Ubeydullah begins a new round of campaigning, this time sending his forces across the international frontier and into Qajar territories in Persia. Initially, his invasion is a success. His forces catch the Qajar government by surprise and rapidly overrun largely Kurdish settlements in the Zagros mountains.\n\nIn the south, a force lead by the sheikh’s son, Sheikh Abdülkadir, seize Sabilgah (which later comes to be known as Mahabad), before advancing on the predominantly Shi’ite town of Miandoab. However, Sheikh Abdülkadir’s men fail to take the town and are forced to retreat back to Ottoman territories.\n\nMeanwhile, the main force, led by Sheikh Ubeydullah himself, place Urmia (in present day Iran) under siege. Although the sheikh’s forces are armed with modern British Martini–Henry rifles, distributed to them by the Ottoman government during the Russo-Ottoman War, their lack of heavy artillery means that they are unable to take the town. They too are forced to retreat when Qajar reinforcements from Tabriz arrive on the scene.\n\nIn spring 1881, with his position weakening, Sheikh Ubeydullah accepts an invitation from the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II to come to Istanbul. There, he is placed under house arrest yet escapes in the summer of 1882 and returns to Hakkâri. He is soon arrested by the Ottomans, however, and deported to Hijaz, a western province in present day Saudi Arabia, where he dies a year later.\n\nSheikh Ubeydullah is the first Kurdish leader to advocate for Kurdish self-government in the modern sense, calling for the unification of both Ottoman and Iranian Kurdistan under his rule. He famously explains his motives in a letter obtained by William Abbot, the British Consul in Tabriz, stating: ‘The religion [of Kurds] is different [to their neighbours] and their laws and customs are distinct… We are a nation apart. We want our affairs to be in our own hands.’\n\nAlthough Sheikh Ubeydullah’s revolt against the Ottomans and Persians ultimately fails, it places the Kurdish question on the international agenda for the first time. William Abbot later notes, ‘I am far from thinking that Europe has heard the last of this Kurdish question. It will probably be asked hereafter, what is to be done with Kurdistan?’\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the Middle East is reshaped by the collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar empires.\n\nMany Kurdish activists begin to favour autonomy or the formation of a Kurdish nation-state, and their aspirations are ostensibly secured by the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920. However, the combination of a revival of Turkish power, the shifting ambitions of the Great Powers of Europe (particularly Britain, France and Russia) in the Middle East, and political divisions within Kurdish society, thwarts any movement towards Kurdish independence.\n\nKurdish national aspirations are further undermined when the Treaty of Sèvres – which had seen the victorious Allied Powers partition the territories of the defeated Ottoman Empire – is superseded by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which makes no provisions for any form of Kurdish statehood. The Kurdish homeland – Kurdistan – is therefore now divided amongst four new nation-states: Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran (which after Shah Reza Pahlavi’s successful coup d’etat in 1921 is no longer controlled by the Qajar dynasty).\n\nThe politics of this post-imperial era are defined by the ideology of nationalism. In the Ottoman successor states within which the Kurds now reside (Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran under the Pahlavi shahs), each government tries to forge a strong sense of national identity to secure its power, and therefore the Kurdish identity is respectively viewed as an obstacle to Turkish, Arab, and Persian national unity. All of these national governments seek to limit Kurdish political activism and at times the Kurds respond violently.\n\nThe Republic of Turkey faces two major Kurdish revolts within the first decade of its existence in 1924 and 1930, and towards the end of the century battles a sustained insurgency led by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).\n\nIn Iraq and Iran too there are periods of armed Kurdish rebellion. In the early 1920s, Sheikh Mahmoud Barzanji, a religious notable from Sulaimaniya, attempts to thwart British efforts to include southern Kurdistan in the newly formed nation-state of Iraq. Ultimately, the British use air power to put an end to Sheikh Barzanji’s self-proclaimed ‘Kingdom of Kurdistan’. They later employ the same tactics to quell revolts by the Barzani clan in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn early 1946, the Kurds briefly achieve their national dream by establishing the first independent Kurdish republic in north west Iran. The Mahabad Republic collapses later that year when the Soviet forces withdraw their support and leave Iran. Iranian forces subsequently overrun the Kurdish republic’s capital, Mahabad, and hang its leader, Qazi Mohammed, in the city’s central square, although Mullah Mustafa Barzani, one of the Mahabad Republic’s principal military commanders, escapes to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Mullah Mustafa Barzani, now president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), fights the Baghdad based government of Iraq to a near standstill. His insurrection is only crushed in 1975 when the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, backed by the United States under President Gerald Ford, betrays his Kurdish allies to win territorial concessions from Iraq.\n\nThroughout the 20th century the response of Middle Eastern governments to Kurdish unrest is typically draconian. Following the Kurdish revolts of the 1920s and 1930s, the Turks deport large numbers of Kurds from their home regions, and in the latter half of the century the Turkish government even resorts to violence against civilians in their ongoing conflict with the PKK. In Iraq, Kurdish civilians are similarly targeted for reprisals: in the late 1980s, up to 182,000 Iraqi Kurdish villagers are massacred during Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaigns across rural Kurdistan, which saw widespread chemical weapons attacks on largely civilian communities.\n\nFollowing the United States victory over the Iraqi regime led by Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War of 1990 to 1991, Iraq’s Kurds fight back by ousting Iraqi government forces from much of Kurdistan. Yet when American promises of support are not honoured, the Kurdish uprising against the government of Iraq fails and over a million Kurds are forced to flee to the Turkish and Iranian borders to escape a vengeful Iraqi army.\n\nFacing a humanitarian catastrophe, the international community intervenes to create a Kurdish safe haven – a region in which the first extended experiment in Kurdish self-rule of the modern era is conducted.\n\nThe brutality of the new Ba’athist regime of Iraq is noted frequently in Foreign Office cables during the administration of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. This inconvenient truth does not, however, prevent them from approving the sale of more than £6 million in arms exports to the Ba’athists on 11 April. The British supply the Iraqi government with weapons that include tanks, artillery, fighter aircraft and rockets.\n\nDeclassified documents from June 1963, which are later unearthed by the British historian Mark Curtis and published in his book Unpeople: Britain’s Secret Human Rights Abuses, illustrate British political sensitivity over the arms sales. G.Hiller of the British Foreign Office reports that, “There has been some press criticism… of our decision to supply arms which the Iraqis are likely to use against the Kurds and if fighting breaks out, and the Iraqis make indiscriminate rocket attacks against Kurdish positions and villages, there could be more widespread parliamentary and public criticism.”\n\nOn 6 July the British embassy in Baghdad writes to the Foreign Office: “The Kurds tend to be shot rather than taken prisoner. We have had some indications from officials that this may be deliberate policy… We have since heard reports of an intention drastically to reduce the Kurdish population in the north and to resettle the area with Arabs and of at least one Arab officer’s disgust with the methods employed as inhuman and ill-advised in the long term. There is no doubt at all of the [Iraqi] government’s deliberate destruction of villages… in the interior of Kurdistan… The Kurds tend to be more humane towards Arabs, doubtless feeling that this is in their long term interests. The government of Iraq, on the other hand, has resorted to the use of force without the normal civilised safeguards against undue loss of civilian life and perhaps even with some intention of reducing the size of the Kurdish minority in Iraq, or at least cowing it permanently.”\n\nDespite these reservations, British arms sales to Iraq continue. However, British officials counsel a reduction in the level of weapons supply to the Ba’athists, with the Foreign Office increasingly wary of the public relations risk of supporting their war against the Kurds.\n\nFurthermore, British officials work to ensure the United Nations (UN) does not discuss a motion put forward in July by the government of Mongolia, asking for the issue of genocide against the Kurds of Iraq to be raised at the UN Assembly. In September 1963 Foreign Office official William Morris notes that if this is brought up at the UN, then “our best line would be to abstain from voting… and indeed avoid saying anything at all if we possibly can.”\n\nOn 11 March 1974, the fourth anniversary of its Autonomy Agreement with the Kurdish leadership, the Iraqi government unilaterally announces a new autonomy law.\n\nThe Kurds are not happy with the changes: Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government’s second-in-command, allocates the Kurds only half the land promised to them in the original agreement and excludes the rich, oil producing governorate of Kirkuk. He gives the Kurds just 15 days to accept the deal but they reject it outright. The Ba’athist regime subsequently states that the Kurdish demands are tantamount to secession.\n\nWar breaks out shortly afterwards between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Iraqi state. The Kurdish movement makes rapid initial gains, setting up an administration near the Iranian border and governing a territory covering a large part of southern Turkish border and approximately 400 km of the Iranian border. In these regions, the KDP establishes nine ministries and operates with effective autonomy.\n\nWith Mullah Mustafa Barzani’s military campaign against Iraq receiving popular support, Kurdish doctors, nurses, teachers, students, army officers and civilians flood into areas controlled by the KDP. Providing for the basic needs of this population influx – which some reports estimate as being as large as 100,000 people – proves difficult, with the large number of refugees creating a humanitarian burden that draws upon the KDP’s resources.\n\nIn northern Iraq, the Iraqi army fights fiercely in Kurdish-controlled regions. Areas of Qaladza, near the Iranian border, are destroyed by bombs dropped by Iraqi jets and on 24 April 130 civilians are killed. Three days later, the Iraqi Air Force bombs Halabja and kills 43 people, and on 29 April at least 20 die in Galala. Then in the summer, the Iraqis overrun Zakho, an Iraqi Kurdish town on the Turkish border.\n\nAlthough the USA, Israel and Iran offer covert support to Mullah Mustafa Barzani’s war effort, the KDP peshmerga are unable to stave off the disciplined and sustained Iraqi assault, and by August Iraqi troops capture Qaladza and Rawanduz near the Iranian frontier.\n\nIn the Bahdinan region, south of the Turkish border, the Kurdish forces face increasing difficulties, as economic sanctions imposed by the Iraqi regime bite. They suffer serious food shortages with winter approaching.\n\nThe situation grows critical for the KDP peshmerga. The Iranians restrict their supply of artillery shells and ammunition to them, and by late February 1975 the KDP conclude that the Iranians and the Americans have no intention of letting them win the war and are instead using them as a proxy to apply pressure to the Iraqi regime. Meanwhile, Iraq conducts secret negotiations with the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran for a peace agreement to end Iran’s support of the Kurds.\n\nBacked by the United States, the Algiers Accord of March 1975 sees the Iranians and Americans withdraw their support for the KDP, forcing Mullah Mustafa Barzani to abandon the Kurdish struggle against the Ba’athist government of Iraq.\n\nOn 21 March, the day marking the Kurdish New Year (Newroz), Mazlum Dogan, an inmate at Diyarbakir prison in southeast Turkey, sets his cell on fire and hangs himself.\n\nMazlum Dogan is a famous Kurdish newspaper editor who has been heavily tortured during three years of imprisonment by the Turkish authorities. He takes the decision to end his life to protest the inhuman conditions he suffers at Diyarbikir prison and the suicide sparks a series of deadly protests in prisons across Kurdish regions of Turkey.\n\nOn 18 May in the same prison, four young Kurds – Mahmut Zengin, Eşref Anyık, Ferhat Kurtay and Necmi Öner – spray themselves with paint, join hands and then burn themselves alive – protesting again the cruelty of their Turkish captors. Like Mazlum Dogan, the four Kurdish activists achieve martyrdom status amongst the Kurds of Turkey.\n\nDiyarbakir prison had been turned into a military gaol after the Turkish military coup in September 1980. In the months following General Kenan Evren’s overthrow of the government of Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel, 30,000 Kurds are reportedly imprisoned there, with captives including men, women and children. The international human rights organisation Amnesty International subsequently receives thousands of allegations of torture at Diyarbikir prison, and reports that hundreds of Kurdish prisoners died as a result of mistreatment.\n\nAlmost 300 Kurds die in Diyarbakir prison. Among them are 14 who did not survive a hunger strike, 43 who committed suicide and 16 who were shot dead after allegations that they attempted to escape. Many other Kurds die after they are tortured.\n\nPrisoners are believed to have been subjected to severe beatings, the forcible removal of hair and nails, electrical shock treatment in which electrodes are attached to the genitals, sexual humiliation and assault, as well as so-called ‘Palestinian hangings’ (hanging by the arms), ‘falaka’ (beating of the soles of the feet) and immersion in baths of excrement.\n\nMurat Paker, a professor at Istanbul Bilgi University, later tells Foreign Policy magazine that ’Diyarbakir prison was designed as a stage on which the Turkish state could perform all kinds of bloody operations on the Kurdish people… they wanted to crush Kurdishness.’\n\nThe prison rapidly becomes a powerful symbol of the repression of Kurdish identity by the Turkish state and fuels the increasing radicalisation of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Many inmates at the prison are PKK members who recruit, train and organise from within its walls. In later years the PKK goes on to launch a full scale insurgency against the Turkish state.\n\nIn 2007 a group of 30 academics, intellectuals and journalists form the ‘Truth and Justice Commission for Diyarbakir Prison’ and record interviews with 500 former inmates incarcerated at the facility between 1980 and 1984. Kurdish political parties and civil rights groups in Turkey demand the prison be turned into an institution called the ‘Museum of Shame’. However, Diyarbakir Prison continues to function as an active prison to this day.\n\nAlthough the Kurdish Civil War of the 1990s has many causes, the long-standing rivalry between leaders of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) lies at the heart of the conflict.\n\nFollowing Iraq’s defeat by Coalition forces in the Gulf War of 1990 to 1991, Iraqi Kurds are optimistic about their political future but the mood quickly changes. Elections are held in 1992 which are won by the KDP with 50.22% of the vote versus 49.78% for the PUK. Subsequently, the two Kurdish political parties adopt a 50:50 government sharing system, yet their mutual distrust soon resurfaces.\n\nTensions between the KDP and PUK are exacerbated by an extreme shortage of resources in Kurdistan. At this point the two parties do not have substantial economic income streams, aside from smuggling and tariffs imposed on cross-border trade with Turkey and Iran, and argue continually over what constitutes a fair division of those revenues they are able to generate.\n\nOn 20 December 1993 the two parties announce a strategic agreement, which establishes a Presidential Council to govern the region. Yet that same day, fighting breaks out between the PUK and the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan, a pro-Iranian political organisation. The conflict rages for more than a month throughout eastern areas of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nOn 1 May 1994 a local dispute between PUK and KDP supporters in Qala Diza, a city close to the land border with Iran, causes violence between the two political groups to escalate, sparking a civil war that will cost thousands of Kurdish lives.\n\nLater in May, PUK forces seize control of the Kurdish Parliament building in the city of Erbil. Numerous attempts are made by Kurdish allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to persuade the two parties to cease fighting but these appeals fall on deaf ears.\n\nTurkey and Iran’s involvement escalates the war between Kurdish factions. Turkey enlists the help of the KDP to fight the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), who are based in Turkey yet have recently established bases inside Iraqi Kurdistan. To complicate matters further, the Islamic Republic of Iran, aided by the PUK, enters Iraq to fight the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI), another political organisation which establishes camps inside northeastern Iraq.\n\nThe involvement of major outside powers sees the domestic political conflict between the rival Kurdish parties rapidly spiral out of control.\n\nWith his forces besieged by the Iranian army and under attack from both the PUK and the PKK, KDP leader Masoud Barzani asks the United States to mediate peace talks with the PUK. A low-key American response fails to calm the situation, however, and so Barzani feels he has little option but to turn towards the Iraqi government. On 31 August 1996, Saddam Hussein’s regime sends three army divisions into KDP controlled areas, according to a United States Congressional report. Thereafter, a joint KDP–Iraqi force drives the PUK out of Erbil.\n\nIn Erbil the Iraqi army targets various political groups and individuals opposed to Saddam Hussein, who they execute and imprison. The PUK subsequently flees from its traditional stronghold of Sulaimaniya. However, by October the PUK – backed by Iran– retakes most of its territory after the Iraqi army withdraws from the region.\n\nThe United States, Turkey and the United Kingdom attempt to mediate between the rival Kurdish parties once again, yet without success. On 13 October 1997 the PUK launches a ferocious offensive against the KDP using Soviet BM-21 ‘Grad’ missiles to attack Masoud Barzani’s headquarters north of Erbil.\n\nTurkey rapidly intervenes to assist the KDP though, and by mid-November 1997 the KDP reasserts control over its own territories. Jalal Talabani offers to negotiate with the KDP and during the summer of 1998, the United States renews its efforts to mediate between the two sides. Masoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani finally sign a peace agreement in Washington DC on 17 September of that year.\n\nThe Kurdish Civil War came at a huge loss to the Kurdish community: tens of thousands of Kurds were displaced between August and October 1996, and an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 peshmerga and civilians died in the conflict.\n\nThe 21st century begins promisingly for the Kurds of Iraq, although the country’s ethnic and sectarian divisions soon flare once again.\n\nOn 11 September 2001, 19 militants from the radical Islamic terror group Al–Qaeda fly hijacked airliners into the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., killing more than 3,000 people and injuring a further 6,000.\n\nThe attack pre-empts a new phase in the United States’ military involvement in the Middle East. In 2002, President of the United States George W. Bush announces ‘The War on Terror’, an American–led campaign that begins with the invasion of Afghanistan and seeks to overthrow the ruling Taliban, a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist regime which is believed to be harbouring the leader of Al–Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.\n\nFollowing Saddam Hussein’s failure to comply with Iraq’s commitments to United Nations weapons inspectors, the United States leads an invasion of Iraq in 2003 with a coalition of allies. President Bush declares, ‘Our mission is clear: to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein’s support for terrorism and to free the Iraqi people.’\n\nIraqi Kurdish forces join the US–led campaign to topple Saddam Hussein and reap significant political benefits as a result. The main Kurdish political parties play an important role in drafting Iraq’s new constitution, which is adopted after a national referendum in 2005. Furthermore, Jalal Talabani, formerly the leader of the Kurdish political party The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), is named the first President of the new government. He becomes Iraq’s first non-Arab leader.\n\nThe new Iraqi constitution recognises the legitimacy of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the rights of people residing in the so-called ‘disputed territories’, such as the oil-rich Kirkuk province, to decide whether they wish to join the Kurdistan Region or not through a popular vote. However, a planned plebiscite to rule on this matter is never held and disagreements over oil and gas resources continue to undermine relations between the KRG and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.\n\nThe terms of Iraq’s constitution state that the KRG is entitled to 17% of Iraq’s federal budget, but after the Iraqi government extracts ‘sovereign expenses’ from the payments the Kurds claim they never receive more than 11%.\n\nIn 2014 the relationship between the government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region worsens when the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al–Maliki, a Shia, refuses to send the KRG its share of Iraq’s oil revenues, dramatically decreasing Iraq’s budget payments to the Kurds. He justifies the decision by claiming the Iraqi government did not consent to the KRG independently exporting oil from the Kurdistan Region through Turkey. However, the KRG argues the Iraqi government’s failure to forward the Kurdistan Region its full share of the federal budget, as per the terms of the Iraqi constitution, means it has no option but to sell its own oil exports to meet its public spending commitments.\n\nRegardless, the situation remains unresolved for several years, leading to a deepening financial crisis in the Kurdistan Region. The Kurdish economy’s previously stellar performance declines significantly and the KRG fails to meet the public payroll.\n\nThe growing financial crisis is exacerbated by the 2014 invasion of northern Iraq by the Salafist jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The rapid gains of ISIS take the KRG by surprise and the radical Islamists capitalise by forcing the peshmerga to withdraw from Sinjar on the Syrian border. There, ISIS targets the large Yazidi community in Iraq’s Ninewa governorate, who practise an ancient religion the Islamic extremists consider heretical. In the early days of their invasion, ISIS massacres over 1,000 Yazidis, although further to this the Ministry of Religious Affairs for the Kurdistan Region reports a further 2,800 Yazidi men as missing or abducted, with the Kurdish authorities discovering 66 mass graves containing the corpses of Yazidis executed by jihadist gunmen. ISIS also kidnap and enslave more than 3,500 Yazidi women and children.\n\nThe massacres in Ninewa lead to a humanitarian crisis as more than 360,000 Yazidis are forced to flee their homes (again according to the Kurdistan Region’s Ministry of Religious Affairs). Many seek settlement in large, hastily organised refugee camps across the Kurdistan Region, and around 100,000 flee abroad.\n\nElsewhere, ISIS forces penetrate deep into central Iraq. They occupy the cities of Fallujah, Mosul, and Tikrit. Fearful of the jihadists’ reputation for brutal public torture and mass executions, the Iraqi army abandons the city of Kirkuk and leaves the region’s oil fields unguarded.\n\nOver the next two years, a coalition of Kurdish, Iraqi, and international forces combat ISIS and succeed in expelling them from their Iraqi strongholds. However, the campaign is undermined by the failure of the government of Iraq to fulfil its budget commitments to the KRG and cover the salaries of the Kurdish peshmerga.\n\nWith Kurdish forces having proved themselves the most effective force fighting ISIS in Iraq, the war effort against the jihadists is threatened. In 2016 the KRG appeals to the United States for monetary support, and the US Department of Defense subsequently agrees to pay the salaries of the peshmerga for a 12 month period.\n\nAs the threat of ISIS recedes in the Kurdistan Region, and with the Iraqi government refusing to send federal funds to the Kurdistan Region for a third year, the KRG commits itself to a non-binding referendum on Kurdish independence. The referendum faces fierce opposition from the government of Iraq and its regional neighbours, as well as the United States and major European powers, who attempt to dissuade the KRG from staging it. Their protests are ignored, however.\n\nMasoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Region, tells the Guardian newspaper (UK), ‘Is it a crime to ask our people to express themselves over what they want for the future? From World War I until now, we are not a part of Iraq. It’s a theocratic, sectarian state. We [Kurds] have our geography, land and culture. We have our own language. We refuse to be subordinates.’\n\nThe Kurdistan Region independence referendum vote is held on 25 September 2017 and 92.73% of the population vote in favour of independence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kurdish independence referendum the neighbours of the Kurdistan Region – Iran, Iraq and Turkey – respond with fierce hostility.\n\nIraq in particular adopts a bellicose approach: in a show of force the Iraqi army reoccupies the ‘disputed territories’, in particular Kirkuk, with the support of Iranian–backed Shia ‘Popular Mobilisation Units’ (PMUs).\n\nIraq’s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shia, subsequently declares the Kurdistan Region independence referendum to be ‘unconstitutional’ and demands that the Kurdish leadership ‘cancel the referendum and its outcome.’ President Barzani responds that more than 3 million votes for Kurdish independence ‘created history and cannot be erased’, and that, ‘Any sanction imposed on the nation of Kurdistan cannot be more effective than the [the Iraqi government-led] Anfal, chemical attacks, mass murder and budget cut.’\n\nUnder Prime Minister al–Abadi, the Iraqi government’s relationship with the Kurdistan Region grows more authoritarian. It closes Kurdish airspace and punishes the Kurds by reducing the KRG’s share of the Iraqi budget from the 17% allocated in the 2005 Iraqi constitution to 12.6%, although by early 2018 even these payments have yet to arrive.\n\nMeanwhile, under the administration of President Donald J. Trump the United States increasingly plays a peripheral role in the region as Iran’s influence over Iraqi affairs increases.\n\nIn the early 21st century Kurdish movements suffer a mix of successes and setbacks north of the border in Turkey, to the east in Iran and to the west in Syria.\n\nIn 2002, Turkey elects the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to office, a conservative, Islamic orientated party which initially seeks to resolve the country’s long-running ‘Kurdish question’. The AKP initially seeks to do so by easing public restrictions on the Kurdish language and culture in Turkish public life, and even enters into negotiations with the jailed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) leader, Abdullah Öcalan.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Kurdish political parties in Turkey increase their influence in national politics, culminating in the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) winning some 13% of the vote in Turkish general election of 2015. This, however, marks the high-point of Kurdish electoral success in Turkey.\n\nIn the aftermath of a failed 2016 coup d’etat by a faction of the Turkish military against the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish government orders a crackdown on the military, civil service, educational institutions, journalists and political dissidents, and there is a serious escalation in conflict between Turkish security forces and militants linked to the PKK, which Erdoğan continues to refer to as ‘a terrorist organisation’. Similarly, the HDP’s parliamentarians, local government officials, and party activists face prosecution and imprisonment, and are also accused of propagating ‘terrorism’.\n\nIn Iran, the Kurdish political parties that once dominated Iranian Kurdistan in the 1970s and 1980s are largely forced into exile in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. However, Kurdish activists and militants continue to challenge the authority of the Islamic Republic, established following the 1979 Revolution. Despite occasional popular protests, however, the Iranian government remains firmly in control.\n\nBy contrast, the 21st century sees Syria undergo perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the modern era. Syria’s Kurdish population, who are concentrated along the Syria–Turkey border, has long been marginalised by the Syrian government. Indeed, in 1962 between 120,000 and 150,000 Syrian Kurds were stripped of their Syrian citizenship on the grounds that they had illegally entered the country from Turkey or Iraq after 1945. Subsequent Kurdish discontent towards the Syrian governments of President Hafez al–Assad (in office from 1971 to 2000) and his son President Bashar al–Assad (2000 to present day) provokes violent protests, most notably in 2004.\n\nHowever, following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Kurdish forces loyal to the Democratic Union Party (PYD), an off-shoot of the PKK, manage to establish control over a large swathe of northern Syria by 2012. They establish an autonomous region which they name Rojava (‘The West’ in Sorani Kurdish) and divide it between three self-governing cantons.\n\nWithin the context of the Syrian Civil War, the PYD enjoys considerable success, receiving military support from the United States to counter ISIS. However, despite their victories against ISIS, the fate of Syria’s Kurds remains uncertain, as both the Syrian government in Damascus and the Turkish government in Ankara express hostility to the PYD’s presence on the Syria–Turkey border.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Arab Spring, pro-democracy protests erupt in Syria in the cities of Daraa, Damascus and Aleppo in March 2011. They are violently suppressed by the Syrian security forces, although this merely stokes the flames of the uprising. Further mass protests against the regime of President Bashar al–Assad soon erupt nationwide.\n\nInitially protestors call for greater civil and economic liberties, less corruption and the release of political prisoners, but the civil disorder in Syria increasingly takes a sectarian dimension. The majority of the country’s population are Sunnis, yet President al–Assad, his government and Syria’s security forces are primarily drawn from the Alawi sect, who are Shia. Several Sunni Islamist movements in Syria subsequently oppose al–Assad and demand the overthrow of his government. In contrast, several minority religious groups support the al–Assad regime, although the picture is complex.\n\nIn July 2011, defectors from the Syrian military announce the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a rebel group that is predominantly made up of Sunni Muslims.\n\nThe violence escalates and Syria rapidly descends into a complex and bloody civil war between forces allied with the government of Bashar al–Assad and various factions. Aside from the Free Syrian Army, these factions include other Sunni Arab rebel groups, radical salafist jihadist groups such as the al–Nusra Front and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) who draw upon international recruits, and a majority Kurdish alliance called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that includes the Peoples Protection Units (YPG).\n\nIn later years Iran, Russia and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah enter the theatre of conflict in support of Bashar al–Assad’s regime, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar supply the Free Syrian Army with arms and funds, with Turkey later intervening directly to target Kurdish groups in Syria.\n\nThe conflict in Syria continues throughout the decade, causing a major humanitarian and refugee crisis. Multiple massacres take place with chemical weapons attacks commonplace. The United Nations Human Rights Commission finds evidence of war crimes on all sides, but accuses ISIS in particular of waging a ‘campaign of terror’ throughout Syria.\n\nSyria becomes the greatest displacement crisis in the world and a global tragedy. Over the course of the conflict, the UN estimates that 6.3 million people are internally displaced and forced to leave their homes, with 4 million Syrians registering as refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\nBy 2018, more than 400,000 people are reported to have been killed in the Syrian Civil War and more than 1 million injured, with over 6 million children estimated by the UN to be in need of humanitarian assistance."
