        "text": "Rodrigo Puebla\n\nemail | donate\n\nI became a Christian while attending college in Monterrey, Mexico, where I grew up. As I started following Christ and saw how His gospel impacted all my life, God started putting in my heart a desire to reach college students. In 2012, I went to study for my M.Div. at Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, MS. It was at that time that I got involved with Campus Outreach and started learning about its vision to reach students with the gospel.\n\nIn 2015, I moved back to Monterrey where I started laying the foundations for this ministry at “Tec de Monterrey,” and at the beginning of 2021, we received our first full team on the field, which I’ve been leading ever since.\n\nSince then, we have started seeing a movement grow more and more. We’ve seen students hear and believe the gospel, be discipled, and even disciple others. We also helped start a new church plant in the city near campus! My prayer is to see the kingdom of God expand among college students in Mexico through this ministry and His church.\n\nAlex Chestnut\n\nemail | donate\n\nAlex grew up in a small town in Indiana where he had always believed in God and had heard of the Gospel, but he never truly understood the significance of words like sin, grace, or good news. Throughout his time in college, many faithful people poured their lives into Alex’s, and he began to realize what the Gospel was and meant for his life. By the end of his time in college, God had grown Alex’s heart for reaching people outside of the United States. Alex has been working in Monterrey, Mexico for the past 2 years, getting to be a part of God working in him and through him. Alex has renewed his commitment to stay in Mexico and is excited to continue to witness God work throughout the Mexican culture.\n\nBen Ditlevson\n\nemail | donate\n\nBen became a follower of Christ during high school in his hometown of El Paso, TX. When he became involved with Campus Outreach while attending the University of Texas at Dallas, the Lord began a work in Ben’s heart to show him that his faith is not about him but rather about God and His glory. God has continued to deepen Ben’s heart for the lost and conviction to obey the Great Commission as he seeks to raise laborers who will proclaim the Gospel everywhere Christ is not known. He currently serves on the campus of Tecnológico de Monterrey, hoping to help other young men similarly catch the understanding that life is about the One who gives it and should be laid down for His glory alone.\n\nSpencer Einhaus\n\nemail | donate\n\nSpencer was born in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, but moved to Salina, Kansas when he was 18 months old. He grew up in a Christian home, but it wasn’t until attending the University of Kansas that he realized what it meant to actually have a relationship with Christ. Through being discipled and hearing God’s heart for the nations at Student Mobilization’s summer project, Kaleo, he began to catch a vision for God’s purpose for his life. During his senior year, he realized that God had a promise and a plan to reach people from every nation, tribe, language, and people and that God wanted to use him for this purpose, even if it meant putting his degree in chemistry aside indefinitely. He is excited not only to bring the gospel to the college campus in Monterrey, but he is also praying for God to send students impacted by him to the ends of the Earth.\n\nVenus Gutierrez\n\nemail | donate\n\nI was born in Venezuela and immigrated to Overland Park, Kansas with my family at a young age. I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Social Work. During my freshman year at KU, I started a relationship with Christ and was able to really take steps forward in my faith. God used my time in college not only to know Christ for myself but also to help others know and start a relationship with Him as well. Being an immigrant, I realized the privilege it is for me to have heard the gospel and want to share it with those around me. God has grown in me a heart for the world and a desire to play a role in Revelation 7:9. Moving forward, I am excited to share the gospel in Monterrey, Mexico and anywhere else God leads me.\n\nAlejandra Loretto\n\nemail | donate\n\nI grew up far away from God, and it left me living a life of great emptiness. One day I realized how shallow my life was and I hit rock bottom. At that time, while I was in college, I met a few Christian friends (among them the one who would later become my husband) and they invited me to their home Bible study group. At first I was on the defensive because I thought I had to change before I could get closer to God. However, week after week, I was able to hear the gospel and see that, with the good news of Jesus, it was the other way around. He forgives me and loves me and it is through this work that I can draw closer to God and change. As the months went by, my best friends became those with whom I shared the same faith, my relationships began to be restored, my involvement in the life of the church began to grow, but most importantly, I could finally say that my identity and joy were in Christ. Now I serve together with my husband Luis in the church, mainly in counseling for young married couples and discipleship for women. We are excited to start a new church soon, and after months of praying for it, we believe that God is calling me into full time ministry, specifically with Campus Outreach, to share the message of hope and salvation with college students.\n\nGloria Obeng-Amoako\n\nemail | donate\n\nGloria grew up in a Christian home, but didn’t come to have a personal relationship with Jesus until her Freshman year of college at the University of Minnesota. Throughout her time in college, within Campus Outreach and at the local church, she was impacted by seeing God’s heart for a Multicultural Bride from the beginning to the end of the Bible. She is overjoyed by the reality that God is bringing a remnant of every tribe, tongue, and nation to Himself for His glory and for our good. Gloria is eager to continue serving in Monterrey, Mexico as God continues to bring many to Himself."
