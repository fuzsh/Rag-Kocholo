        "text": "POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE (Police check)\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThere are two types of national police clearance certificates you can obtain from Mexico:\n\nThe National Police Clearance Certificate (Constancia de antecedents no penales en materia federal) issued by the Órgano Administrativo Desconcentrado de Prevención y Readaptación Social (OADPRS), dependant on the Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection (Secretaría de Seguridad y Protección Ciudadana - SSPC), and\n\nThe Records Certificate (Constancia de Datos Registrales) which is issued by the General Prosecutor’s Office (Fiscalía General de la República - FGR).\n\nState governments also issue local police clearance certificates, but they are not valid for migratory purposes in Australia as they are not national police checks.\n\nNeither of these police clearance certificate can be obtained directly at the Embassy of Mexico in Australia.\n\nTo request either of these certificates, it is indispensable that you have a supporting letter issued by an official authority, such as the Embassy of Mexico (more information below).\n\nFor visa related processes, it is recommended to apply to the CNAP.\n\nNATIONAL POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE OADRPS (CNAP)\n\nTo learn how to request this certificate, visit the following OADPRS website.\n\nThe CNAP can only be requested in person at the OADPR office in Mexico City. If you live outside of Mexico, it may be processed by a first-degree relative (parent, child, sibling, or spouse) by presenting a simple authorisation letter signed by the applicant and two witnesses (with copies of their identifications), or by using a special power of attorney. You can find an example of a simple authorisation letter here: (example of simple letter of authorisation) Simple authorisation letters don’t need to be certified by the Embassy: (example of simple letter of authorisation). Simple authorisation letters don’t need to be certified by the Embassy.\n\nFor further information, please contact the OADPRS directly.\n\nRECORDS CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE FGR\n\nThe records certificate (Constancia de Datos Registrales) issued by the General Prosecutor’s Office (FGR – previously Procuraduría General de la República PGR) is a document that verifies if an individual, Mexican national or foreigner, has any record of investigations conducted into them at either the local or federal level.\n\nThis certificate can be requested in person at the FGR offices in Mexico City or at any Attorney General’s state office. Applicants who live outside Mexico can give a simple power of attorney or authorisation letter to someone else to request the certificate on their behalf. You can find an example of a simple authorisation letter here: example of simple letter of authorisation. Simple authorisation letters don’t need to be certified by the Embassy.\n\nThe information and requirements to apply for a records certificate are available on this website: Constancia de datos registrales.\n\nAs part of the requirements for the Records Certificate, you will need to present an official document with a record of your fingerprints. This can be done either at a police station in Australia or at the embassy.\n\nIf you wish to have your fingerprints taken at the Embassy, please call us (02 62733 963) or email us (Esta dirección de correo electrónico está siendo protegida contra los robots de spam. Necesita tener JavaScript habilitado para poder verlo.) to book an appointment. You will be required to bring an official ID (original and a photocopy) and four passport-size photos (white background, facial traits visible, no smiling, ears and forehead clear): two taken from the front and another two from the side (profile).\n\nFor further information about the CDR, please contact the FGR directly: Website.\n\nHow to get the supporting letter from the embassy\n\nIn person.\n\nTo obtain the supporting letter from the embassy you will need to apply in person at the Embassy of Mexico in Canberra. First, you must book an appointment by email (Esta dirección de correo electrónico está siendo protegida contra los robots de spam. Necesita tener JavaScript habilitado para poder verlo. ) Esta dirección de correo electrónico está siendo protegida contra los robots de spam. Necesita tener JavaScript habilitado para poder verlo.) or phone (02 62 733 963). On the day of the appointment, you will be required to show the following documents (both originals and photocopies):\n\n1. Application form.\n\n2.Official photo ID (passport, driver’s licence or photo ID). Mexican nationals who don’t have a passport must provide an official ID with their full names (such as a driver’s licence) and their Mexican birth certificate (original and photocopy).\n\n3 Document that shows that the police check is being required by an official institution in Australia (letter from the Department of Home Affairs, letter from an immigration agent, etc.).\n\nThe support letter will be issued on the same day of the appointment. If you cannot pick up the letter from the embassy, please leave a self-addressed prepaid envelope so the embassy can post the letter to you.\n\nBy post.\n\nIf you cannot come personally to the embassy, you can post the following documents:\n\n1. Application form.\n\n2.Certified copy of an official photo ID with your full name (passport, driver’s licence or photo ID). The copy must be certified by a justice of peace or notary public in Australia. Mexican nationals who don’t have a passport must provide a certified copy of an official ID with their full names (such as a driver’s licence) and a certified copy of their Mexican birth certificate.\n\n3. Document that shows that the police check is being required by an official institution in Australia (letter from the Department of Home Affairs, letter from an immigration agent, etc.).\n\n4.Self-addressed prepaid envelope (which will be used to post the supporting letter back to you).\n\nDo not post your original passport or ID. The certified copies, along with the completed form and self-addressed envelope must be posted to:\n\nConsular Section\n\nEmbassy of Mexico\n\n14 Perth Ave.\n\nYARRALUMLA, ACT 2600\n\nImportant information if you are requesting the support letter by post:\n\nSupport letters requested by post are processed and sent to the applicants as soon as possible. However, due to the high volume of requests, allow a minimum of three business days for the letter to be issued from the date of arrival of your documentation.\n\nThe Embassy cannot process “urgent” letters of support. We kindly suggest that you request the letter of support with sufficient time in advance to allow for processing.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to verify that they have all the necessary documentation to request the letter of support from the embassy. The embassy is not responsible for delays in the processing times due to errors in completing in the form or because of incomplete documentation.\n\nTo monitor the progress of your documents, we kindly suggest that you write down your envelope’s tracking number and to follow it up on the Australia Post website Track your items - Australia Post. Due to the high number of requests, the embassy will not confirm when your documents are received or when the letter of support is sent to your address.\n\nDo not enclose additional information or documents to your application, such as photographs, letters of authorisation or the translation of your documents, as this can cause delays in the processing of your letter of support.\n\nImportant\n\nLetters of support for police checks are provided free of charge.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs have indicated that the 28-day period that is given to some applications to provide the police check for visa matters, can be extended if the applicants prove that, during this period, they have started the process to request this document. This request should be made directly by the applicant to the Department of Home Affairs, by submitting a letter accompanied by any supporting documentation.\n\nThe Australian authorities have also indicated that, if you have been requested to provide a police check and it is impossible for you to obtain it, you should communicate this impossibility directly to the Department of Home Affairs in writing. This must be accompanied by the supporting documentation.\n\nThe Embassy will only issue letters of support to applicants currently living in Australia.\n\nYou are advised to carefully check which certificate you are requesting. A letter of support to apply for a CNAP will not be accepted if you are applying for a Records Certificate, and vice versa.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nCan I request a police clearance certificate through the Embassy?\n\nNo. It is not possible to request a police certificate through this Embassy.\n\nCan someone else request the supporting letter on my behalf?\n\nNo. This is a personal matter and should be requested by the main applicant.\n\nWill they issue my police clearance certificate if I do not present a letter from the Embassy or from another institution?\n\nNo. The supporting letter from the Embassy or from another public institution is a requirement to obtain your police check from Mexico.\n\nI need a Mexican police check for immigration matters in Australia. Which one do I request?\n\nBoth letters have the same validity for Mexico. However, for immigration procedures in Australia it is suggested to apply for the CNAP.\n\nHow long does it take for the letter of support to be ready?\n\nIf you make an appointment at the embassy, the letter is issued on the same day. For applications by post, the time may vary depending on the number of applications received, but they are usually issued within a period of 1 to 3 business days. Please note that depending on the self-addressed envelope that you send, the letter of support may take one to two days (Express Post), three to five days (Registered Post) or more than two weeks (regular envelope) to arrive at your address after being issued.\n\nShould I send original documents to Mexico?\n\nOriginal documents can be lost in the mail, so it is very risky sending them by post.\n\nIn many cases, copies of your documents with the embassy seal are accepted to process the police check without having to provide the original document.\n\nHowever, you can also request a comparison certificate (“certificado de cotejo”) from the Embassy, which will certify that a copy of your document is true to the original. To obtain that certificate, please email (Esta dirección de correo electrónico está siendo protegida contra los robots de spam. Necesita tener JavaScript habilitado para poder verlo.) or call us (02 62 733 963) to book an appointment. You will be required to bring the original document that you want to certify, two photocopies of that document, and an official ID. You also ned to pay for the certificate by electronic transfer or in cash.\n\nThe embassy can only certify documents issued by public or private institutions in Mexico.\n\nAlternatively, you can directly contact the SSPC or FGR offices in Mexico to enquire if they accept copies signed by a Notary Public in Australia.\n\nHow can I get my certificate if I do not have any relatives in Mexico?\n\nIf you do not have any relatives or friends in Mexico you can appoint a lawyer or solicitor to request the Records Certificate from the FGR.\n\nPlease note that, if it is impossible for you to obtain this document, you should communicate this impossibility directly to the Department of Home Affairs in writing. This must be accompanied by the supporting documentation."
