Madero (President of México Nov. 1911 – Feb. 1913) partly because Madero was also born and raised and retained strong family ties in their native Coahuila. After the assassination of President Madero in Mar. 1913, Carranza organized his supporters into the Constitutionalist Party, assigned positions to various relatives, and assumed the presidency of México. (But so did Pedro Lascuraín 1913, Victoriano Huerta 1913 - 1914, and Francisco S. Carvajal 1914.
