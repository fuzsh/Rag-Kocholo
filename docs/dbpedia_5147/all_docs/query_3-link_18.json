        "text": "This database contains civil registrations from Nuevo Leon going back to 1859.\n\nCivil registration in Mexico began in 1859, although compliance wasn’t enforced until 1867. Generally, the registration of a birth would take place within a few days after a child was born, although the gap was sometimes longer in rural areas where it could be more difficult to travel to the civil registration office. Close attention should be paid to differentiate the date of the registration and the actual birth date.\n\nWhat You Can Find in the Records\n\nThe early records are in paragraph form, while later records often appear in a register format. They will generally include the following details:\n\nlocation and time of registration\n\nname and gender of the child\n\nbirth place and date\n\nlegitimacy\n\nparents’ names and sometimes ages and nativity\n\nfather’s occupation\n\nresidence\n\nnames of two witnesses who may or may not be related\n\nYou will occasionally also find the names of grandparents, whether they are living, and if so, where they reside."
