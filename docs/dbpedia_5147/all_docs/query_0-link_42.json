He was involved in several mining and textile companies and in 1855 formed a business house that from 1861 was called Hernández Hermanos y Cía.\n\nBy 1896 the company, now called Sucesores de Hernández Hnos, was one of the largest and most influential business houses in Mexico with stores in Lerdo, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo. “They deal in dry goods, groceries, agricultural implements and all native products of the Republic. The firm also does a banking business under the same name as that under which their stores are conducted. The stores are well arranged and the shelves, show cases and warehouses are filled with all grades of goods to meet the demands of all classes of customers. Fair dealing and strict business methods are the main elements which have contributed to the marked success of this large firm.” .\n\nThe Hernández Luengas married the Mendirichaga and at the end of the century the Hernández Mendirichaga participated in the founding of the most important businesses in Monterrey, including the Fábrica de Vidrios y Cristales de Monterrey, the Industrial Jabonera de la Laguna, the Cía.
