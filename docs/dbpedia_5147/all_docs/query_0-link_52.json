It is planted in the state's 129 mnnicipalities as well as in most of the backyards of the island of Sao Lu~s. Formarly restricted to unoccupi:ed land or to dense forests to avoid iepressive action by the aurfiorities, plantations now accupy so-called ferti].e soil, such as the marshy borders of small and large rivers and creeks in receding periods. This is true to the extent that Maranhao is now considered by federal narcotics agents as the ma~or Brazilian marifiuana storehouse, supplying more than 70 percent of the domestic market a~ we11 as exports. Last week 64agents of the Maranhao division of the Federal Police parttally , surrounded 28 municipalities in tlie t4aranfiao lowlands, setting up head- ~ quarters for the operation in tTie municipality of Pindare-PZirim 252 km southeast of Sao Luis. The agents spent 28 days hidden in the forests and succeeded in seizing about 400 tons of marihuana: 365,034 kg still in the,green-leaf stage and 1,870 ready for consumption in domest~c and foreign markets. At current - prices this quantity would bring in S billion cruzeiros. Accordtng to Commissioner Newton Vieira Ltma, coordinator of the Guaribas operation, this police action did not, in reality, reach the ma~or centers. For example, in Vitorino Freire, areas known to be large producers were not checked out, as access to that area is difficult and dangerous. In addition to the agents' lack of transportation, the planters and traffickers' lookouts placed deadly booby traps to prevent the police from reach~ng them. Last year an agent was killed by a 20-caliber rifle bullet triggered ~ when he crossed the contraption's line of fire. Plaranliao marihuana intended for export goes directly from the production sources to Be1em, in Para, and from there it is sent to tfie Guianas, where - it is redistributed for sale in various countries, including the United States. Up to now the authorities liave not succeeded in establishing the traffic's route and believe tfiat there are fiighways and large hidden patbs tTirougfi the forests through whicfi Maranhao's production flows. - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 Not all Aiarnnhao's marihuana follows tho~e clandestine routes. Some of tt, intended for the domestic market, is transported via ~ederal highways packed in secret compartments in passenger automobiles, preferably of tre Maverick type because of its roomier trunk, or in transport trucks mixed , with the hay for the cattle or hidden under the gasoli`ne tank. In tfia: Guianas the marihuana gives rise to other illegal trade: that of _ smuggl~.ng, as it is exchanged for whiskey and fiousehold appliances which enter the country by the same route used to ship the \"grass.\" In Commission.er Lima's opinion, although thF police is in possession of all those facts, it has not yet succeeded ir~~: unraveling tbe tangled ball of yarn, tT~at is, the organization which i.s`'~xploiting the marihuana traffic in the country. The leaders, people~`of social and political ~ importance, never appear. 'TIzey generally operate through~agents, and the - agents are careful not to be seen in their contacts with the planters. The latter are ~asically poor and ingenuous farmers who give up conventional crops to plant marihuana, inasmuch as this o~fe~rs them better living conditions or more equ:ttable payment for tfiei:r work. The police have a valuable ally in their effor.ts to eradi~ate marihuana from Maranhao---namely, the landowners ~aho are developing their individual - estates. Their motive for collaborating is not thdt of helping the authorities to achieve their o.b~ectives but rather one of defending their . own interests. It is thev who ferret out and denounce marihuana plantings, as the dispersion of labor in those areas is causing them problems. It is presently difficult to obtain laborers to work the crops by paying them in accordance with ~raditional and sti11 current systems: a third, _ half or ox yoke. The traffickers finance everything; they furnisfi tfie seeds and, during the cycle between sowing and harvesting, a period of 15 weeks, supply the growers with rice, flour, kerosene, salt, sugar and toliacco. At harvest time, in addition to their wages, the growers receive 2,500 cru- zeiros per kilogram of marihuana foliage, whereas a 60-kg sack of rice does not cost more than 120 cruzeiros and is sub~ect to state tax~. . As the problem has strong social overtones, the Federal Police continue to = act with leniency, since tfiey recognize that the grower in this illegal process is naive c,r an indiv~dual without future prospects wfio is making this choice to maintain Tiis family. ' The growing of marihuana is almost cost-free, Planters choose 'specific sites, preferably those having an abundance of humidity and heat, clear . tfie land and sow the seeds, The poisonous content of marifiuana is so great that it is not attacked by insects or caterpillars. \"Not even - donkeys are able to eat the leaves,\" it is said. Planting occurs twice a year: during the winter and in the period when - tfie water recedes. Marihuana grown during tfie latter pe~riod brings a higher price because it has a finer and smaller stem and its leaves have a , greater amount o� THC--tetrahydrocannabinol, the active substance. ~5 . APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 That is why growers do not plant traditional crop~ in large and small - drfied-up stream beds. Besides the fact that marihuana brings a better price and always lias an available maricet, it is during that period tlzat quotations are at tfieir highest. _ When the Federal Police began the pro~ect o~ eradicating marihuana from Maranhao, they found large plant~ngs along the ma~or highways. Many growers were not cultivating marihuana to promote the i11i:c.it trade but because it is also used in the rural pharmaceutical sector as an effective remedy against colic and other intestinal complications. - Growers wlio devote their efforts exclusively to the cultivation of marihuana do not plant that crop in an isolated manner. In stream beds tT~ey comtiine it with tomatoes to throw the police off their track, and in highe~ places with manioc--the onl~ tu~er which resists the proxim~ty of marihuana roots. - In Sao Luis it is cu:ltivated every month of the year in greenhouses or backyards for consumption by local addicts. It is on that island tfiat the Federal Police make the greatest number of investigations involving marihuana growers, and tfiey belietiQ that there are few backyards wfiere the plant ~s not grown. = However, the large plantings are located in reservations inhabited by - natives, where the Federal Police are not allowed to operate without prior permission by FUNAI [National Indian Fouda,tion]. Based on infor-mation i; received from individua:ls who were i.n the area, agent Andre Ribeiro Jr. states emphatically that it is possible to seize more than 600 tons of marihuana in the Gua~a~aras Indian reservations in Sao Pedro dos Cacetes - - between the municipalities of Barra do Corda and Imperatriz. The natives consume and plant on a large scale without any restrict-~on. This month the rlaranhao division of the Federal Police will bring this information to the attention of FUNAI in Brasilia and wi11 ask permission to raid those reservations where, the agents are certain, they w311 find the largest marihuana plantings in the state. - Another of the police's ma~or allies in the fight against the growing and trafficking of marihuana in rlaranhao is dissension among the traffickers ttiemselves. The narcotics gangs usual].y arm the planters so tfiat they might protect their plantings from competitors at harvest time. When rhere is an attack, the one being attacked denaunces the attacker to the autfiorities. In the Guaribas operation federal agents found large storage sheds bu~lt , for the storage o� marihuana in Vitorino Freire, Pa~lo Ramos, Altamira, Santa Luzta, Santa Ines, Moncao, Gra~au, Amarante do Piaui, Joao Lisboa, Imperatriz, Barra do Corda, Lago dos Pedras, Esperantinopolis, Barreirinha, Bon~ Jardim, Pio IX and Caxias, Tn Pau1o Ramos an enormous silo was� vsed to keep \"grass\" already prepared for consumption. There alone 1,870 icg were seized, and in two existing plantings in the vicinity the police destroyed more than 300,000 marihuana plants. 16 - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 ~ ; _ About 20 large-caliber rfifles~ and revolvers wexe conf~scated from lookouts in the service of the traf.ffckers'' planters.

RESULTS OF ANONYI~IOUS CALLS ON DRUG TRAFFTCKING Sao Paulo 0 ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 6 Aug 79 p 8 [Article by Edson Flosi] _ [Text] Since connecting telephone number 227-1717 to a tape recorder to receive denunciations about'the traff~ck~ng and use of narcotics in Sao _ Paulo, the Narcotics Division [DE] of the DEIC (Crim~nal Tnvestigat~ons - Department) has listened to an average Qf 30 telephone ca11s a day. Although at first questioned, this measure is giving results which Commissioner Nestor Sampaio Penteado, who directs the DE, considers excellent. He relates how an anonymous denunc~ation resulted 3n the seizure of 40 kg of marihuana: \"A man's voice called attention to a network of marihuana traff~ckers. ~ We arrested a woman with 40 kg of the drug. Tfie investigations are continuing, and it is possible that the entire network o� traff~ckers will be broken up within a short time.\" It has been exactly 1 week since number 227-1717 was installed to receive anonymous denunciations. Whoever calls th~s number at any hour.of the day or night liears a taped female vo~ce which always says the same thing: \"Narcotics Division. This is a recoxding. After the signal you wi11 ~ave 1 minute to state your poblem. If necessary, dial again.\" After a sfiarp and brie.f sound, which is the signal, the complaining caller � can speak for 1 minute, and when the time ~s up the telephone disconnects automatically. Commissioner Penteado explains: \"Very seldom does the denunciation exceed the allotted time; but if the caller has many details to give, lie has only to dial agai'~i and continue. speaTcing. However, up to now this has happened only twice.\" ~ 18 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 1` , ~ - kepercussion Commisstaner Penteado took over the DE leadersfiip 3 tnonths ago, and wfien - Tte installed telephone numbPr 22~7-1717�and revesled its purpose he was greatly criticized, even in pol~ce circles, although he was also very much applauded, He states: \"Tfiey spoke of lack of ett~ics, of time wasted can anonymous denunciations; but in the field of trafficking. in and use of drugs there is no other way. In truth, it is necessary for the people to denounce traffickers and addicts, which is recognizably dangerous~. It is precisely to preclude the risk of reprisals by tragfickers and adc~icts that the DE is p~otecting the denouncer with anonymity.\" , - Every 2 hours a DE employee cfianges the tape and makes a separaC:e typed record ot the complaints receive3. The compla~nts, submitted ~n tw~~ copies, are immediately examined by the commissioner, who, backed by 30 yea~r~'of exp~rience, the duration of his police career, picks out what he considers in most urgent need of investigation. He then ca11s Commissioner Marco Antonio Martins R~beiro de Campos and, 3n discussion with him;!goea over ~ case by case. - Commissioner P.ibeiro de Campos subsequently assigns the cases to one, two or more investigators, giving them the necessary funds for tiie action to be taken. Commissioner de Campos explains: \"Naturally, we do not use all the DE's human, mecfianical and tecbnical resources to check out the anonymous complaints, but, after careful selection, some are investigated. This does not prevent the police from continuing ~o do what they have always dorie: mak~ng a traditional - investigation based on one or mnre clues and often leading to the imprison- ment of traffickers and tfie seizure of drugs. However, there is no doubt - that the anonym~~us complaint is also a clue and, not rarely, one of great � value . \" ~ Selection Commisstoner Penteado's career is divided as follows: 10 years of police wc?rk in the interior (various cities, sucfi as Riu Claro, Mogi Mirim and Itapira), 10 years in the DE (from 1959 to 1969) and 10 years in tlie Theft Division (which he left 3 months ago to return to the DE). Durin g the 10 years he spent in the DE he worked under the leadership of Celso Teles, who is now commissione~ genex'al o� the Sao Paulo police, the highest office in that field. Considered one of the country's foremost author~ties in the narcotics sector, Celso Te1es supported the idea of installing telephone number 227-1717, witfi one requirement, ho~aever, that = of carefully investigating anonymous complaints before taking action in order to avoid any in~ustice. Commissioner Penteado states: l9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 \"TYte key to the problem lies in that selection an~i subsequent thorougfi investigation. After all, never fias any pol~ce official ignored a complaint, anonymous or not. And I know very well that an anonymous denunciation is as practical as it is effective; but personal vengeance is also tv be condemned. TTZerefore, the DE wi11 not arrest anyone or even fiarass anyone by taking immediate action on the basic of an anonymous complaint. However, - _ once convinced as the result of an investigation, it will take action in case the one denounced is, in fact, trafficking in drugs. As for addi~ts, ~ ~ the DE does not consider them criminals, unlike traffickers, who really are criminals and of the worst kind. WTien tfie person denounced is only an addict, he is treated by the DE as a sick person.\" Denunciations Telephone number 227-1717 is not recording denunciations on1y. There have - also been pranks, swearing and even one case in wfi~ch a group of youngsters _ was unjustly denounced. Commissioner Penteado relates: \"Tlie youngsters played ball every afternoon, naturally making noise and - disturl~ing the complainer. An investigation was made of which the youngsters - knew noth3:ng, as the police T~ad observed the incident from a distance.\" Commissioner I'enteado further explains that the complaints are carefully investigated especially to protect the complainer, who, despite being anonymous, still runs the risk of being subsequently identified by tfie drug traffickers or addicts, Tfie commissioner continues: \"There was a case of a newspaper vendor denounced by a person who was, to be sure, near his newspaper stand. After 2 days of in~estigation, the police confirmed that the trafficking really was being carried on at the newspaper stand; however, they did not arrest the vendor at that location. Tfiey waited, and when the vendor� was far away from his stand one day, he was arrested. He had a kilogram of marihuana wrapped in newspaper. Thus, ~ arrested far from the area in which the trafficking was being done, he was certain not to suspect anyone'living close by or any of his customers.\" Telephone Praised by some, but accused by others, of having institutionalized anonymous denunciations, Commissioner Penteado defends himself against - the latter by stating: \"There ts no other way; either tfie people must help or the police will be powerless to do anything about the problem of the trafficking in and use of - d.rugs ~n Sao Paulo. To be sure, the greater of the two problems is tfiat of trafficIcing, for without that, drug usage would decrease or disappear. And the drug traffic is widespread. Previously there were big traffickers whose imprisonment greatly affected the market. Now it is different; the _ bi~ traffickers, ~aho were few in number, were replaeed by hundreds of thousands of little traffickers scattered throughout the city. We need an army to ferret them out, and that is wfiy I am appealing to the people to help the Narcotics Division.\" 20 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-00850R040140090046-1 - Through telephone number 227~1717, Cominissioner ~enteado also received an - appeal from five families in each of wiiic~i tfiere was~ young add~ct.

Tliat of Mogi Mirim alone took two ' of the five addicts, wfio T hope wi11 be xehatiil~tated.\" _ Disclosure Since Commissioner Penteado took over the leadership of the DE, tfie number of arrests has increased from 40 to 70 a month; most of the traffickers , went to prison, and in 3 months a ton of marfhuana was seized, as well as - 3,000 drug ampoules. The comm~ssioner intends to make the figI~t against drug traffick~ng the last and greatest effort of his career: \"I fiave a family, a wife and two children.

They were confused as to the time the merchandise was to be delivered, the buyers did not show up, and they finally approached a poltceman ~,iho pretended to be a trafficker. The 90-percent pure cocaine was contained in a plastic bag in an Opala - automobile, bearing Sao Paulo license plates No FJ-1785, in which they were traveling. Moacir and his companions finally confessed that tT~ey traded automobiles to a Bolivian in exchange for the drug on the banks of the Paraguay River, in Corumba, but they denied that the cars were stolen tn Sao Paulo. They declared that this was the first time they had made such a trade. Tipped off by an individual whose identity is being kept secret as a precaution, the DPPS agents arrived on the scene beforehand to make a search, Last Friday they witnessed a delivery made to a trafficker wfiose identity is being investigated and who is being�sought.

BRAZIL POLICE ACTION ONLY NETS 10 PERCENT OF DRUGS - Sao Paulo 0 ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Por.tuguese 12 Aug 79 p 37 ~ [Text] The combined action of the Federal Police and tfie state police forces is only able to seize, nn the average, 10 percent of the toxic or stupi:fying substances that enter the country illegally, according to estimates of the Drug Repression Division of the DPF [Federal Police Department]. The. 1978 report of tfiat division indicates tfiat one of the gr�eatest - problems ts \"the noticeable lowering of the a~e ~racket of t~-~e users�,\" and it concludes that this situation is \"generat~ng social, politica:L, economic and psychological effects that are F?igF~ly pre~udicial to society.\" Another point emphasized in the report is the spread of drug use, formerly limited almost exclusively to tfie large urTian centers. The recognttion of this fact has not been accompanied by any concomitant of snggesting solutions or prospects for better results 3n the fight against tfie drug traffic, although sources in the DPF believe that with more effictent control on the borders and a study of criminal records it will be possible to establish the connections of the international gangs, with positive effects on the consumption of drugs throughout the country. - Marihuana, the drug most used in Brazil, whose domestic production is concentrated almost exclusively in Maranhao and Pernambuco, comes from Paraguay \"in large quantities. Paragua}ran marihuana is very.popular because of its excell~nt quality,\" according to the report. It enters Brazil through the states of riato Grosso and Parana. The cocaine route extends from Bolivia to the states of Acre, Mato Grosso, Parana and tbe . Territory of Rondonia. The barbiturate and amphetamine traffic o~iginates i:n Argentina and Paraguay. These drugs enter tfie country along t~ie borders~ of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Mato Grosso. LSD, whose use is decli~itng at least on the statistical level, comes from the United States and Europe. Two types of drugs fiave the authorities worried, because their use is difficult to control and because they have strong hallucinogenetic effects: tliese are substances used in veterinary medicine as exciters for bulls and stimulants for Tiorses, which are now being used by young people, and mixtures of substances which may be bought individually in drugstores ~ without restrictions. 28 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 , - Amounts of Drugs Seized ' The total drug seizures carried out by the Federal Police and by the state ~ secretariats of security in 1978 amounted to the f.ollowing quantittes: - 273,000 kilos of marihuana; 23 kilos of hemp seeds; 87 kilos of cocaine; nearly 58,000 units of various psychotropic 'drugs; 542 ampules of \"preventim\"; ~ 212 doses of LSD and small quantities of hashiss--7 grams; of coca leaves, 304 grams; amphetamine salts, 162 grams; and heroin, only 1 gram. Most Addists Men The great ma~ority of addicts and drug traffickers are male--90.77 per- cent--and only 9:23 percent are female. In spite of the fact that the ~smuggling routes show the characteristics of multinationa], drug operations, 1,583 of the people identified in police investigations, or 96.ll.percent, are Brazilians. A total of 64 persons--3.~i4 percent--are foreigners. - ~Iarihuana is the toxic substance whose use has been increasing significantly ~ year after year.

S. HAS NOT SUSPENDED ANTIDRUG AID Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Aug 79 pp 1-A, 6-A m . [Article by Julian Escovar] [Text] The U. S. Government officially denied in Bogo~a yesterday thaC it - has suspended the economic aid it gives Colombia to combat drug trafficking _ due ta alleged human rights vioiations here. ~ The U. S. Government also recognized that in view of the vast sums involved in international drug trafficking and the overall percentage of the U. S. budget allocated to the fight agatnst it, the amount it gives in'aid to Colombia is \"ridiculous.\" In any case, the amount of the aid is determined by Congress and not by the U. S. Government. The U. S. Government also announced that it is negotiatin~ a vast economic - and social development program for La Guaj3ra, since it believes that the ~ serious challenge presented by the production and. export of marihuana, in particular, cannot be met \"solely on the basis of bullets.\" Likewise, the U. S. Government was of the opinion that the U. S. Congreas is clearing the way for the clarification of the bilateral treaty by means of which Washington recognizes Colombian sovereignty over the Caribbean - keys of Serrana, Quitasueno and Roncador, which are ad~acent to the coast _ of Nicaragua. These statements were made by U. S. Ambassador Diego Asencio, who paid an unexpected vi~it in the morning to the Senate's Second Committee, which is in charge of internr~tional affairs. - The diplamat, who was accompanied t,y two political advisers, remained with the group about 45 minutes and spoke in perfect Spanish. He displayed a sense of humor and parliamenCary ski1L, and did not have to refer to any document or exchange opinions with his advisers to answer the questions asked ~ by the senators. Asencio is confident that the United States will ratify its membership in the International Coffee Agreemen't soon, and revealed that at the specific 37 - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 request of the Colombian authorities, measures are to be taken shortly _ against the smuggling of cigarettes manufactured in the United States into Colombia. The U. S. diplomat went to the capitol building to extend a g~reeting, in ac- cordance with protocol, to the new president of the Senate, Hector Echeverri Correa. Eduardo Abuchaibe Ochoa, chairman of the Second Committee and a mem- _ ber of parliament from La Gua~ira, took advantage of the occasion to invite Asencio to visit the committee and talk to its members. Asencio was happy to oblige and began by cordially ask3ng his listeners to voice any concern they m3.ght feel regarding U. S.-Colombian relations \"wiCh complete openness, since I love to discuss issues.\" Echeverri Correa said he was pleased that the ambassador had agreed to vis3t the committee so cheerfully and suggested that similar meetings be held on _ a regular basis. In a short improvised speech he said that such meetings wou.ld make it possible to reach productive decisions in areas such as fair - trade. Regarding the report by columnist Daniel Samper Pizano published in EL TIII~iPO a few days ago to the effect that the United States had suspended its anti- drug aid to Colombia due to al.leged human rights violations, Asenc3o said the report was inaccurate. He added that Samper Pizano, whom he mentioned by name, had based his report on a commentary published last June in a U. S. magazine. The magazine had not adhered to the facts. . Asencio noted that what happened was that simple procedural problems involv- ing international affairs cropped up in the U. S. Congress concerning the amount of narcotics aid to Colombia, and that the problems were \"finally resolved.\" Therefore, he said, the link between human rights and the aid made by the U. S. magazine in connection with the alleged cancellation of the specific aid for narcotics control \"was incidental.\" Explaining further, the U. S, ambassador said that since the U. S. Congress is determined to control the expansion of the offi.cial U. S. budget as much as possible in order to avoid spiraling inflation, each package which is up for inclusion in the budget is studied very carefully. Thus, in the case of the aforementioned aid, which had initially been set at $14 million in the new budget, there were some procedural differences be- tween the committees in charge of studying and assigning the aid in the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, this did not involve hu- man rights. In order to overcome the differences both groups appointed a joint subcom- mittee and a formal announcemer.t is now expected to the effect that the problems have been solved and that the inclusion of the economic aid in the budget is guaranteed. 38 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 Asencio said he is ae yet in no position to say what the final amount of the _ sid would be, since it could range between $14 and $16 million, or perhaps more. - The diplomat answered questions by Senators Abuchaibe Ochoa, Rafael Navia and Jose Vicente Mogollon, and said that all the in�ormation he was giving them was obtained first hand since he recently spent 3 weeks in Washington and visited Congress frequently. The Colombian senators, especially Abuchaibe and Navia, proposed to the am- bassador that perhaps the amount of aid granted by the United States to Colombia to combat drug trafficking was not reasonable and that, consider- ing the economic power of both countries, Colombia was bearing the brunt of the burden in this affair. The diplomat spoke at length on this sub~ect. He noted that a few days ago he personally told congressmen and U. S. police chiefs that annual aid such as the current one in the amount of $14 or $16 willion is \"sma11 and ridiculous\" considering thaC according to official ~ studies, Colombia generates 70 percent of the narcotics exports brought - illegally into the United States. He based his argument on the fact thaC it costs $14 million a year to sup- port the police department in a small city such as Birmingham, Alabama, with _ � a population of 700,000. He emphasized that his stand was even more justified in view of the fact that ` the United States i3 spending more than $1 billion a year to combat drug trafficking internally. Compared to this, $14 million is an insigni�icant amount. The d~plomat said he hoped that this overall situation would change shortly so that the struggle against drug trafficking could obtain optimum results. Asencio said that in this ~oint U. S.-Colombian struggle, neither side is ~ alone and that both sides are seeking to help each other as much as possi- ble. The diplomat made this statement in answer to a concern voiced by � Senator Abuchaibe, who said that in his opinion, Washington is not making even 10 percent of the effort it could make in this area. The U. S. diplomat revealed that at his own initiative, his government is sounding out the World Bank and the IDB to see if they can finance an eco- nomic and social development program for La Guajira, and he said he was optimistic that a positive answer would be received in due time. He noted that since, on Colombia's initiative, the economic aid granted through the Agency for International Development (AID) is about to come to ; an end, this agency would,only be able to draw up the respective feasibility plans for the aforementioned program. Regarding the Serrana, Roncador and Quitasueno keys, the U. S. diplomat said ; that the U. S. Congress has asked that certain wording be clarified in the = respective treaty and that this wi11 not affect the prompt ratification of the treaty. 39 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000100090046-1 He concluded by saying that this treaty has already been negotiated at the bilateral level and ratification is expected ahortly.
