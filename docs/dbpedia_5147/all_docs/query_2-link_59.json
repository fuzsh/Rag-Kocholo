        "text": "Results\n\nA total of 5751 individuals were tested for HTLV antibodies at 8 sites. Table records the main characteristics of the study population. Donors represented 2312 (42.2%), of whom only 17 (0.3%) were living kidney donors. The remaining 3439 (59.8%) were recipients. Males were predominant (59.7%). The median age was 57-years old. Spaniards represented nearly 80%, being Latin Americans only 65 (1.1%) and Africans 101 (1.8%). Overall, transplant recipients were more frequently male, younger, and native Spaniards than organ donors.\n\nTable 1\n\nTotalDonorsRecipientspNo. (%)57512312 (42.2%)a3439 (59.8%)–Male gender (%)3435 (59.7)1234 (53.4)2201 (64)< 0.001Median age (IQR, years)57 (45–66)59 (45–71)56 (45–65)< 0.001Country of birth (%) Spain4595 (79.9)1383 (59.8)3212 (93.4)< 0.001 Other EU countries114 (2)34 (1.5)80 (2.3)– Africa101 (1.8)14 (0.6)87 (2.5)< 0.05 Latin America65 (1.1)25 (1.1)40 (1.2)– Asia9 (0.2)4 (0.2)5 (0.1)– Unknown867 (15.1)851 (36.8)15 (0.4)–\n\nOverall, 9 individuals were initially reactive for HTLV antibodies. Table summarizes the main characteristics of these patients. Six were donors and 3 were recipients. Using confirmatory tests (western blot and PCR), HTLV-1 was found in only two patients. Another three were positive for HTLV-2. Two samples gave indeterminate results and another two were negative.\n\nTable 2\n\nCaseYearDonor or RecipientGenderAge range (years)Country of birthConfirmatory test12010donorfemale35–40SpainHTLV-222011donorfemale80–85Spainnegative32011recipientmale45–50Spainindeterminate42011donormale45–50SpainHTLV-252015donormale35–40SpainHTLV-162015donorfemale45–50ColombiaHTLV-172015recipientmale45–50SpainHTLV-282016donormale50–55Spainnegative92017recipientfemale25–30Colombiaindeterminate\n\nThe two HTLV-1 positive cases were donors. Thus, the overall rate of HTLV-1 among solid transplant donors in our study was 0.09%. The first individual was a 49-year old female, born in Colombia, diagnosed in 2015, at the time she was assessed to be a kidney living donor. Before moving to the surgical procedure, she was discharged as potential donor following knowledge of her HTLV-1 seropositive status.\n\nThe second HTLV-1 case was a 38-year old male, born in Spain, that died in 2015. Both kidneys were inadvertently transplanted. TSP/HAM developed within 1 year in one recipient, despite antiretroviral prophylaxis attempted within the first weeks. The second recipient seroconverted for HTLV-1 but the kidney had to be removed soon due to rejection. Immunosuppression was stopped and to date, 3 years later, the patient remains in dialysis but otherwise asymptomatic.\n\nThe three HTLV-2 cases were two donors and one recipient. All had been born in Spain. The last patient died before transplantation. The two donors were finally discharged from transplantation because they were also positive for HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMore than 35 years after the discovery of HTLV-1 [7], donor/recipient screening for the virus remains sporadic or non-existent in most countries. In 1993, the American CDC recommended that persons infected with HTLV be counselled “not to donate blood, semen, body organs or other tissues” [8]. Nevertheless, in the year 2009 the recommendation for universal HTLV screening in deceased organ donors was dropped in the United States because of the perception of low HTLV-1 prevalence and low positive predictive value of serologic screening tests [9]. Alongside this recommendation, most international transplant society guidelines currently do not provide any advice on HTLV-1 screening and use of donated organs.\n\nHigh rates of HTLV-1 have been found in specific groups in non-endemic regions of North America [10] and Europe [11], and decades of migration/immigration and tourism/travelling have altered the demographics of many Western countries. For example, the ongoing refugee migration from the Middle East and Africa would rapidly change the prevalence of HTLV-1 in many European countries. For a while this has been the case with Latin Americans in Spain, given the large flux of immigration facilitated by strong cultural and ancestor links [6].\n\nSince the year 1988 there is a national register of HTLV-1 cases in Spain. A total of 369 cases had been reported until December 2018. Most cases are concentrated around the largest urban areas (Madrid and Barcelona) where the greatest immigrant populations are living. However, HTLV-1-infected persons have been identified across the whole Spanish geography. Although many were immigrants from endemic areas, mostly in Latin America, up to 18% were native Spaniards [6].\n\nThe rapid development of subacute myelopathy was seen in one of our recipients from a kidney from the HTLV-1 positive cadaveric donor. Similar cases of subacute myelopathy shortly after transplantation have already been reported in the literature [12–14], including a series of recipients from a single donor in Spain [15]. Myelopathy was originally reported in a heart transplant recipient in France following HTLV-1 acquisition from contaminated blood transfusions during the surgery [16]. Transplant immunosuppression seems to play a major role in the accelerated disease progression in this setting [17].\n\nIn response to the worldwide evolving foci of HTLV-1 infections and the very poor prognosis of post-transplant virus-associated illnesses, there are urgent calls for a broader HTLV-1 screening of live and -more difficult- deceased organ donors. Organ procurement organizations and transplant programs should determine local prevalence to guide HTLV-1 screening efforts [10]. Targeted screening of potential high-risk living (and deceased) donors for HTLV-1 has been recommended by some authors [13]. Suggestions also have been put forward for national or international registries of all HTLV-1-affected transplants [17]. Alerted to the dangers of rapid-onset TSP following HTLV-1-infected organ transplants, Japan began in 2014 screening for HTLV-1 of all kidney donations. Similarly, the United Kingdom issued new transplantation guidance on HTLV-1 screening of cadaveric solid organs in 2011. Finally, the Global Virus Network has recently called for more systematic HTLV-1 screening before solid organ transplantation everywhere [4].\n\nThe screening costs for HTLV-1 are small in comparison with the cost of post-transplant illnesses and/or death associated with TSP or ATL following HTLV-1 infection [18]. For all these reasons, the American and European CDCs along with other health prevention agencies should urgently update their policy recommendations on organ transplant HTLV-1 screening. In the meantime, some transplant centres around the world, including a few in Spain, have already implemented “rapid” (or “urgent”) HTLV-1 testing of all deceased organ donors. In parallel, diagnostic companies should design rapid tools (i.e., point-of-care (PIC) assays) and improve the specificity of HTLV-1 screening tests to minimize unwanted organ discharge.\n\nOur findings call into question the current view that anti-HTLV screening of donated organs is not needed or just recommended when there is suspicion, as it is recommended in Spain [5]. This opinion is based on the assumption that HTLV-1-associated diseases will develop only in a small proportion of carriers and that progression to disease is slow compared with the average lifespan of humans and therefore poses no major threats to public health. In the transplant setting, the very high risk of transmission and the high rate along with short-term for developing HTLV-1 disease most likely results from immunosuppressive therapy."
