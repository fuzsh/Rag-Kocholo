        "text": "Erika Monet Doula Services\n\nErika Ledin\n\nDoula\n\nerikaledin1@gmail.com\n\n831.242.0211\n\nI Love Helping People.\n\nBecoming a doula feels like my personal calling. It is a work of the heart. Since I was a small child, I repeatedly watched the BBC series, “Call The Midwives” with fascination over the miracle of birth with all its twists and turns, love and pain, culminating in the little bundle of baby crying, “Hello world!” I realize becoming a doula requires in-depth training, sensitivity and patience. You’re serving mothers with physical, emotional, and educational support. Essentially, you are a childbirth companion to the family concerned. That requires a calm person who can multitask and exude confidence in the process.\n\nAt my own birth I was separated from my biological mother and placed into foster care in Sacramento. Fortunately, I was adopted into a loving family. Perhaps my drive to be a doula has been charged by my passion to make the passage to life for the mother and child as lovely and healing as possible. I learned about the Sierra Childbirth Institute from one of your graduates, Michelle Nizza, who has a midwifery clinic in Monterey called “Mums the Word.” She is waiting for me to get the training I need so I can assist her in her work, attending live births, and participating in what goes on from start to finish with pregnancy and birth. I truly want to be a doula.\n\nBirth & Postpartum Doula\n\nLactation Support\n\nOvernight Specialist\n\nExtensive experience with multiples\n\nmiddriftmovement.com\n\nmiddriftmovement@gmail.com\n\n612.481.2911\n\nMy drive is supporting families; helping them identify their needs while meeting them where they are at, then helping to guide them to where they want to be. My journey to birthwork started after my first was born in 2003 when I gave birth with the invaluable help of my doula. A spark was planted and shortly after my second was born I completed my doula training and found that I was where I was supposed to be. two more kids and 16 years later I still have the same passion for supporting families and I have added Postpartum support (I LOVE overnights), Lactation support, Tuck-In services (to make sure you are all settled in after the birth) and Parent Coaching to the list of ever-growing ways I can help serve families. Being a mother to 4 kiddos does not mean I have all the answers, but it does mean I can be creative in problem-solving, multi-tasking and provide a non-judgmental ear (and that while haven’t seen it all, I have seen a LOT). I believe in shared experiences and laughter and will help you process all of the emotions and feelings that come along with the territory. Even though parenting can be one of the most incredibly gratifying things you will ever do, it can also push you to limits you didn’t know you had. Additionally, along the way I discovered a deep-rooted passion for postpartum parents and together with my partner started a 501 c3 non-profit dedicated to changing the conversation around postpartum bodies and expectations, called Mid Drift Movement. We are one episode complete in our ongoing Docu-series that addresses things like body image, postpartum changes and society's expectation that people “bounce back” after having a baby. I have spent the last 4 years conducting workshops, holding screenings of the Episode and helping people to love their postpartum bodies. While I do not have a website for my own doula business, you can see what I do with my crew on our Mid Drift Movement pages. Being able to play a small role in a family’s journey is an incredible honor and one that I do not take lightly. I am here to support you whatever your path may look like and I look forward to connecting with you.\n\nJoyfully serving families and people of all kinds: LQBTQIA, adoptive, surrogate, parents of multiples, and choice parents. All are welcome here.\n\ndoulashauna.com\n\ndoulashauna@gmail.com\n\n707.799.5601\n\nBirth and Postpartum Doula\n\nShauna is a locally trained Birth and Postpartum Doula offering support to families for hospital and out-of-hospital births.

I also fully trust that you already know what's best. As a doula, I'm here to provide the care, support, evidence-based resources, and tools to make navigating all of this a little easier on you. My goal is to empower you to advocate for yourself in order to have the experience that you want. I'm here to meet you wherever you are in each moment.\n\nAs someone with lived-experience as a biracial individual (second-generation Mexican-American) raised in a multicultural & blended family, I'm especially passionate about providing support to those that identify as members of historically resilient communities.\n\nI understand that receiving care from someone we feel connected to can be invaluable. I offer a free consultation to provide a space to talk through your unique hopes, fears, and needs so that you feel good about moving forward with me being a part of your support crew.\n\nNanyotlzin Birth Postpartum Services\n\nReyna Toledo\n\nBirth and Postpartum Doula\n\nTheta Therapistwww.a-ama.com\n\nnanyotlwomb@gmail.com\n\n831.776.8328\n\nNanyotlzin Birth and Postpartum Services began when I gave birth to my first child. I became aware of the immense vulnerability a woman experiences while bringing a child into this world, sparking a passion to change the lives of birthing mothers and their families for the better. In my doula practice, I provide empathy, empowerment, and support. Weaving my Indigenous and contemporary Healing practices. One of the most cherished and divine ceremonies in humanity is the birthing of a child. Being present through this journey is an honor. First, I assist you and your relatives with hands on support. Second, I provide personalized guidance and substance at four different levels — mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical. Third, I utilize Theta therapy technique to help you navigate past, present, and future birth related experiences and I also work with cranial vagus nerve therapy to assist both mother and father to be prepare for their precious Jewel!\n\nServices Offered: Postpartum Planning Sessions Formula Feeding Consultations (in-home & virtual)\n\nYou may have heard of a birth-plan, and those are important and so helpful! I also believe that just as much attention, and intention, should be spent planning the days and weeks after you welcome your baby home.\n\nBecoming a parent is a form of culture shock! Discussing plans and expectations with your partner or other support network can help smooth out some of the bumps along the journey. We’ll tailor your Postpartum Plan around your family’s unique circumstances, but some topics we may cover include: early plans and education for postpartum healing, New Parent Leave decisions for you and your partner, car seat safety resources, delegating housekeeping tasks, plans for feeding (both you and the baby!), sleep preferences, communicating boundaries to family and friends, identifying your support network, signs of Postpartum Mood & Anxiety disorders, and more.\n\nAdditionally, as a Certified Infant Feeding Educator, I can also help navigate discussions about feeding choices for your baby. We have many wonderful IBCLCs and other lactation professionals if breastfeeding is your goal. Due to my experience and journey as a new mom, I became an IFE because I needed professional education and support for including formula feeding in my feeding plans, and there wasn’t anyone in our community who did that! So if you find yourself needing to supplement with formula a bit in that first week or two, or you want to discuss combo feeding long-term, or switch exclusively to formula, I can come to you and provide education and support to help you do that safely, without any judgment. You'll learn how to prepare formula properly, feed in a way that supports your baby’s digestion and also protects your breastfeeding relationship (if that’s important to you), choose the right formula, troubleshoot, and simply feel supported and confident in your feeding decisions for your family."
