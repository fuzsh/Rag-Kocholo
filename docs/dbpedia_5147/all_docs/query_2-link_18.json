Flores, Filed under: Obituaries\n\nOn May 29, 2016, Marian Verlean Douglas heard the voice of God call her name. She walked in peace and joy in her spirit as the Lord beckoned her with outstretched arms. In awe, she wept and bowed in worship as God said in His magnificent melodic voice “You are welcome, my good and faithful servant.” With His hands, he touched her face and whispered, “Peace and eternal life I give to you.” He presented Marian with angelic wings and the sounds of praise and worship moved Heaven and Earth as Marian was welcomed home. Born in Kenedy, Texas on May 24, 1915, Marian V. Douglas was the proud daughter of Amanda “Maime” Green and Morris Douglas. Marian was the last living of her siblings, James Morris Douglas, Joyce Booker, Estella Buckner, and Maggie Manuel. She was the loving mother of nine children: Vivian Richardson (Ft. Worth, Texas), Geraldine Jefferson (San Antonio, Texas), Robert Hicks, deceased (Kenedy, Texas), Janie Mikes, deceased (Ft. Worth, Texas), Katie Mikes (Ft. Worth, Texas), Oscar Mikes, deceased (Kenedy, Texas), R.V. Allen, deceased (Kenedy, Texas), Diane Tapscott (Mira Loma, California) and Edward Douglas, deceased (Kenedy, Texas). The count of grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren who lovingly call her Mamaw and Big Momma continues to grow. Marian’s history is deep-rooted in the city of Kenedy, Texas. She worked most of her life as a domestic worker, volunteer and was a life-long member of the Galilee Baptist Church. The long talks, singing of hymns, worshiping God, laughter, words of wisdom and hearing Marian say “God bless you” will be deeply missed yet cemented as wonderful memories.
