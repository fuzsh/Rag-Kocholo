Death was instantaneous.

Since then we have learned that the little girl is still alive and may recover. A butcher was driving a vicious cow through town. The girl was on her way home from school. The cow attacked her, threw her in the air, trampled on her and pierced her body with one of its horns. When the child was picked up it was thought she was dead. There ought to be a law in every town prohibiting this reckless driving of cattle through the streets. â Halletsville Herald.\n\nThis child apparently survived.

Carnes, was a sad blow to parents and friends. Miss Eva had just touched her sixteenth year and was beloved by all who knew her. She had been sick several weeks and the best medical skill was called in, but all to no avail, for the death angel came last Monday night and carried her off to that brighter and better shore, where all is peace and joy and love.\n\nThe stricken parents have the sympathy of all who know them, in this trying hour, but time alone and a firm reliance on him that doeth all things for the best can heal their great sorrow.\n\nShiner Gazette, 20 Dec 1899, page 1\n\nThe funeral of Miss Eva Carnes last Wednesday evening was largely attended. A great many of the young people who were playmates and associates of Miss Eva, attended, and brought their last offerings of flowers [.] The burial services were conducted by Rev. J. F. Perrin, the Methodist pastor. At the close of Rev. Perrinâs remarks the young people sang that beautiful and impressive hymn, â[We'll] Never Say Good-Bye in Heaven.â When the services closed there was not a dry eye on the ground. The bereaved parents have the utmost sympathy of all in this their greatest sorrow.\n\n[page 5 of same issue]\n\nMr. D. C.

Carnes\n\nShiner, Texas, November 26, - A message from Floresville yesterday, the 25th inst., brought the sad news of the death of W. J. Carnes, Sr., a highly respected citizen of this place.\n\nThe death of Mr. Carnes was very sudden, as he was in apparent good health a few days before his death. He leaves a host of friends and relatives to mourn his loss.\n\nChronicle article contributed by Cathy Fitch.\n\nW. J. CARNES\n\nShiner Gazette, 2 Nov 1893\n\nThe Late W. J. Carnes.\n\nThe Rev. A. G. Nolan preached Sunday the funeral sermon of the late W. J. Carnes. The M. E. church was crowded and the Rev. Nolan preached an impressive and moving discourse. The members of the family present were Mrs. W. J. Carnes, wife of the deceased, his daughters Mrs. Will Grant, Mrs. L. M. Kokernot and Miss C. C. Carnes; his sons, W. J. Carnes, jr., S. A. and R. S. Carnes, also Clinton Askey and daughters, and Miss Alma Kokernot and Miss Fannie Marsh. Also L. M. Kokernot, S. S. Cole and J. H. Cole. Rev. Nolan paid a high tribute to the deceased and the congregation was often moved to tears by his touching references to Mr. Carnes. He said: âIn life he was a man respected and revered by all, for steadfast manliness, unwavering integrity, faithfulness and purity of character. His goodness and generosity knew no bounds and wherever he went and wherever he was known he commanded the friendship and esteem of all. For three years I was his pastor and he was my stewart and during all that time he needed no words of reminder from me but was always punctual and zealous in the performance of his duties. His was one of those characters in which kindness, charity, patience and courage were happily blended and in domestic life he was a kind and indulgent father and a loving husband. Cruelty was impossible with him and he could never bear to see any creature about him ill-treated. ***\n\nâIt may be that there are some whose goodness brings them very near to that better world, so near that when the time draws near for them to quit this world, they have premonitions of their departure. Brother Carnes was one of these. A short time before his last illness I met him at the depot in Shiner and he wished to make known to me his premonitions that he was soon to quit this life, but something intruded and I was never able to speak with him again on the subject.â\n\nIn conclusion Rev. Nolan spoke as follows: âHis life should be an example to us, and inspiration to better thoughts and better works in this world. The spirit of Godliness and sanctity pervaded his life and lighted for him a pathway to heaven. His life works should be an incentive to us to work harder and live holier that we may meet him on the fairer, brighter shore that lies beyond the stormy ocean of our lives.â\n\nThis grave appears to be unmarked.

The Galveston News of Saturday gives this account of the unfortunate affair:\n\nEd Carville, a car repairer employed in the Santa Fe shops inÂ this city met with a horrible death about 8:15 yesterday morning in the Santa Fe yards, about Fortieth street, by being caught between the drawheads of two cars and crushed. Carville had been at work repairing a cab window in a car standing on another truck, and having completed his work jumped to the ground and started for the shops. A long train was standing on track No. 9, and there was an opening where the cars had parted, and through this Carville attempted to pass. A Santa Fe flat car, No. 853, was on one side, and a heavy furniture car, No. 6692, on the other. Just as Carville stepped upon the track the engine âkickedâ some other cars down against the train, pushing the flat car and the furniture car together and catching Carville squarely between the drawheads, crushing his body frightfully. Carville did not lose consciousness at first, and spoke several times to one of the trainmen who was giving signals for the engineer to pull up in order to release him from the awful situation. Just as soon as the cars were pulled apart, Carville dropped down a corpse. An inquest was held by Justice Friery, at which substantially the above facts were developed, and the body was turned over to J. H. Stouer to be prepared for burial. Carville was about 30 years old, and was married about two years ago to the daughter of Henry Smith a well-known Houston railroad man. The body will be taken to Hallettsville this morning, accompanied by the grief-stricken young wife. âHallettsville Herald.\n\nTranscribed by Sharon Sutton\n\nOTHO W.
