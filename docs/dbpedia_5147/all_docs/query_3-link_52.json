        "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I made Carne Seca, so today I’m showing you one of the most delicious and decadent breakfasts there is, made with that delicious dried beef.\n\nGrowing up in Monterrey, this was one of the most beloved (weekend) breakfast or brunch items, whether at home or in restaurants. If you speak to anyone in Mexico and they find out you’re from Monterrey, one of the first things they will mention is Machacado con Huevo, it is that famous. You can have it plain (eggs and meat), cooked in salsa or a la Mexicana, which is my favourite.\n\nAs the story goes, Mrs. Fidencia Quiroga Chavarría opened her restaurant in the town of Ciénega de Flores, about 35km north east of Monterrey in 1928. At the time, the highway from Monterrey to Laredo was being built, and the workers from the project were Doña Fidencia’s clients. La Tía Lencha, as Doña Fidencia was known, started serving a hearty dish of eggs with dried meat, and an icon was born. Carne Seca Tía Lencha was the first commercial brand of dried beef, and it remains one of the most popular.\n\nAnother important ingredient in this dish is the tortilla - since this from Nuevo León, the traditional Machacado con Huevo is served with flour tortillas, but if corn is all you have (as is my situation today), this taco does not discriminate. A bit of refried beans on the side and lots of salsa and you will experience one of the best breakfasts there is.\n\nFor this dish, we need shredded dried beef, so you can pound homemade carne seca on the mortar, to give it the traditional look. You can also shred it by hand, cut it with scissors or mince it in the food processor.\n\nMachacado con Huevo estilo Monterrey\n\nDried Beef and Eggs, Monterrey Style\n\n1 Tbsp lard or vegetable oil\n\n1/2 cup minced dried beef\n\n1/2 cup diced onion\n\n2 Tbsp minced Jalapeño or Serrano chile, or more to taste\n\n1 cup diced Roma tomato\n\n4 eggs\n\nFlour tortillas\n\nSalsa\n\nRefried Beans\n\nIn medium frying pan, heat oil and cook meat only until toasted, 1-2 minutes.\n\nAdd onion and chiles and cook until softened.\n\nAdd tomatoes and cook until they break down and become saucy.\n\nBreak the eggs into a small bowl and break apart with a fork. Beat a little bit just to mix in the yolks.\n\nAdd eggs to pan and turn heat down. Mix gently and cook just until eggs are set.\n\nServe with flour tortillas, salsa and refried beans.\n\nServes 2."
