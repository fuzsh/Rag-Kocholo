Hardly anything could knock him off a horse and he could break most any wild horse. People would say he was like a chinche (bedbug) attaching itself to one's skin. He was also small in stature and thus he was like a small bedbug, hence \"chinchillo\". Pancho being a nickname for his given name of Francisco, he became known as Pancho Chinchillo.\n\nHe was an excellent horseman and cowhand and worked at several of the large ranches in South Texas, including the King Ranch, the McAllen Ranch, the East Ranch, the El Salado Ranch, and others.
