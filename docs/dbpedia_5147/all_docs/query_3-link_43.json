        "text": "President Enrique Peña Nieto declared that, “The ultimate goal of governing is to serve, which is why we have prioritized attention to Mexicans through practical, modern solutions\".\n\n”With this new digital service, Mexicans can now obtain their birth certificates from their homes or offices, computer or cell phone, and in Mexico or abroad”: EPN\n\n”The right to identity is a basic guarantee for Mexicans, and the government has the obligation to ensure that it is a reality for everyone\": EPN\n\nBefore the procedure for those who live in a state other than the one where they was born was slow and expensive. They had to travel to their birthplace, pay for the copy and also hope that it was ready.\n\nThis government joined forces with the governments of the states, and the government of Mexico City to create a strategy that would make the right to identity for all Mexicans effective.\n\nIn 2015, the digitization of all birth certificates registered since 1930 was completed, and the states’ civil registries began to share information and standardize their formats.\n\n”This initiative joins the efforts we have made in the government to implement a National Digital Strategy that will make it possible to transform Mexico on the basis of innovation and the use of new technologies. Above all, it contributes to the construction of a close, modern government, which effectively serves the population”: EPN\n\nIn 2012, there were 45 million people with access to the Web. Today, 70 million use the Internet every day, making it one of the most widely used media.\n\nIt has also been possible, thanks to Telecommunications Reform, to unify all the government sites in a single portal: HYPERLINK \"https://www.gob.mx/\", and provide society with access to information, services, data and citizen participation mechanisms in a single website."
