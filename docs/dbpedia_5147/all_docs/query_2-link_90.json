        "text": "This article was written by BenitoLink intern Juliana Luna\n\nNearly 100 guests on May 5 met at The Epicenter in Hollister where the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Council 2890 celebrated its 35th Anniversary with an event called Community Achievements.\n\nThe achievements highlighted in the event include LULAC-created scholarships, mentorship programs and youth conferences.\n\nThe gathering included live music by harpist William Faulkner, who is known as El Charro Harpist, master of Zapotiltic, Jalisco, and mariachi music styles.\n\nLa Catrina Mexican Grill provided flautas, burritos, sopes, enchiladas and Mexican bread sweets for guests.\n\nFormer local presidents spoke on LULAC’s accomplishments during its 35 years in the community. They also pledged to continue fighting for Latino representation to achieve greater employment and social equality.\n\nSan Juan Bautista Vice Mayor Cesar Flores said Cinco de Mayo “is not about celebrating a victory of the battle. It’s about those who are born here, whose parents, grandparents and great-great parents came to this country long ago. American citizens who have been marginalized socially and economically—people who have to raise their rights and privileges on their own—those who in recent times, were not included in this country’s history books.\n\n“We celebrate Cinco de Mayo, not in recognition of a battle in another nation but a battle of recognition in this nation,” Flores continued. “Recognition that we are equal to all others in intellect and goodness.”\n\nSan Benito County Superior Court Judge Patrick Palacios, who served as LULAC president in 1992-93, and whose oldest son, born that year, was nicknamed “Baby LULAC” said, “I always tried to work with, speak to, and motivate anyone who saw a career in law, and guide them to a direction. Especially Latinos.”\n\n“Passion for justice is something we need to keep and maintain. For those who have been here for generations or are coming here now, they need to know that we have a just and fair society,” Palacios said.\n\nHe promised to continue his role as a judge with that same sense of justice.\n\n“We have come a long way,” said founding member Mickie Solorio Luna. “When you think of 35 years, you don’t think of everything that this organization has done. We have been affiliated with every agency with San Benito County, college, and school district, and we aren’t stopping. There are so many young people—1,295 youth members that have gone through the youth organization.” She added that this figure included over 330 young adults across state colleges.\n\n“Some of them are here today and I’m so proud of them,” Luna continued. “I’m also very proud of honorable Patrick Palacios and honorable Omar Rodriguez. They have been our supporters for years.”\n\nAt the end of the evening, 18 awards were given. “For people who are constantly there for us, we give them a tribute,” said Luna.\n\nThe recipients:\n\nCommunity Foundation of San Benito County\n\nFarmers Insurance—Eric Contreras\n\nAllstate Insurance—Roger Soell\n\nJovenes de Antaño—Pauline Valdivia\n\nHollister City Recreation—Tina Garza\n\nGavilan College—Dr. Kathleen Rose\n\nSan Benito County Office of Education\n\nSan Benito High School\n\nHollister School District\n\nHollister Super Markets- Chang So\n\nNob Hill Bakery\n\nHollister Community Outreach\n\nFarmworker Caravans\n\nTrue Value Hardware- Fernando Gonzalez\n\nDr. Ahmad Rafii\n\nCongressman Jimmy Panetta\n\nState Senator Anna Caballero\n\nAssemblyman Robert Rivas\n\nLULAC Achievements in San Benito County\n\nGranting scholarships: 35 years, over $175,000\n\nYoung Readers Program: four Hollister School District schools in 13 years, $96,000\n\nLatino Student Leadership Conferences: 18 years, $72,000\n\nAdelante Mentorship Program: 14 years, $105,000\n\nAnnual Student Retreats: 23 years, $78,500\n\nDiversity Dialogue Student Meetings: five years\n\nAnnual Hispanic Women in Action Reception: 26 years\n\nAnnual Veterans Breakfast: 26 years\n\nNeedy Children Toy Drive: 25 years\n\nYouth Sports sponsorships: Hollister Recreation\n\nLatino Boy Scouts Troop\n\nGraffiti Cleanup: Hollister Police Dept, 10 years\n\nHollister Downtown Association Street Festival: 18 years\n\nCommunity service and assistance to local agencies\n\nCommunity partners with various Latino nonprofits\n\nLULAC Youth Leadership: 33 years\n\nLULAC Youth Members: 1,297 participants\n\nLULAC Young Adult Participation: 21 Years, 364 collegiate students\n\nSan Benito LULAC introduced and secured city of Hollister District Elections\n\nEncouraged and secured trustee district elections to boards including Hazel Hawkins Hospital, San Benito High School, Hollister School District and Gavilan College District\n\nPetitioned the U.S. Department of Justice for a decree against the county elections department, alleging Latino Voting Act violations in 2003\n\nLocal council adult and young adult and youth members have served in district, state and national leadership roles\n\nNamed National Council of the Year in 2000 at the national convention in Boston\n\nParticipated in the National Youth Council in Las Vegas in 2012\n\nJoined EHAT—Empowering Hispanic America with Technology, a local partnership computer center, in 2019\n\nThe BenitoLink Internship Program is a paid, skill-building program that prepares local youth for a professional career.
