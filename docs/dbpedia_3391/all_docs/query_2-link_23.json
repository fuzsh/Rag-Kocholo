Both figures explode with infectious, winning enthusiasm and are usually posed in midair, arms and legs flung wide to propel a ball past opponents and into the goal. A more detailed version of Pelé’s accomplishments caps this double introduction to the world’s most popular sport and to one of its most endearingly popular figures.\n\nFrom Another World.

Many, many creatures will feel the effects when their source of sustenance and shelter falls to the earth. So when a man is sent into the Amazon rain forest one day, under instructions to chop down a great kapok tree, many eyes watch him nervously. It’s not long before he grows tired, and the “heat and hum” of the rain forest lulls him to sleep. One by one, snakes, bees, monkeys, birds, frogs, and even a jaguar emerge from the jungle canopy to plead with the sleeping man to spare their home. When the man awakens, startled at all the animals surrounding him, he picks up his ax as if to begin chopping again, then drops it and walks away, presumably never to return.\n\nGreat Snake: Stories from the Amazon.

Three times he is told of dolphins that appear as men dressed in suits and hats: the spread of a fisherman taken to the bottom of the river by such a stranger is particularly chilling. He hears trickster tales of Fox and Jaguar as well as Tortoise and Vulture, and on a very hot day he delights in the story of very slow Three-Toed Sloth.\n\nHead of the Saint. Acioli, Socorro.

Miraculously, he can also hear the private prayers and longings of the villagers. Feeling mischievous, Samuel begins to help answer these prayers, hoping that if he does, their noise will quiet down and he can listen to the beautiful singing in peace.
