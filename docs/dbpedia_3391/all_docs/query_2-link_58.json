        "text": "It's been five months since Pele's death pulled on the heartstrings of football fans around the world - and the Brazilian legend is still reducing people to tears.\n\nOne of the greatest players of all time - if not the greatest of them all - the 82-year-old passed away on December 29 after spending more than a year battling colon cancer. But now, the only footballer to win three World Cups has been transferred in his final resting place - and adoring fans can visit him.\n\nPele, real name Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is now at the Ecumenical Memorial Cemetery in Santos. Like the former forward himself, it's a place not small in stature, a 14-story mausoleum that currently has a place in the Guinness world record books for being the tallest cemetery on Earth.\n\nPele's body is at rest rest inside a huge golden vault, displayed in the middle of a 200-square-meter room which is supplemented by artificial turf. Upon entry, people are greeted by two golden life-size statues of him with his a football at his feet, alongside a Santos flag and Brazilian flag.\n\nAnd his career is also reflected by the vault itself, which has black etchings on its sides to represent his 1000th career goal and his trademark fist celebration. The wall depicts images of football fans celebrating his feats, and the Mercedes Benz S-280, given to him has a present when he reached four figures, is also on show - along with Brazil national shirts to reflect his time with the Selecao.\n\nHis son, Edinho, has told reporters that whilst the impact of his father's death on the family continued to be profound, the clamour from the public to pay their respects had proved heartening: \"We're also very proud and happy at all the affection and reverence that's kept pouring in,\" he said, via Citizen Digital.\n\nAnd images have emerged of visitors in tears amid visits to pay tributes to the former Santos star. Indeed, entry numbers to the tomb have been restricted to 60 people a day, with citizens and visitors having to book online via the cemetery's official website.\n\nThe mausoleum is less than am mile away from the Santos stadium, Vila Belmiro, the stage where Pele showcased his unbelievable talent for 18 years. And cemetery manager Paulo Campos told AFP: \"It's a place that's rich in detail, all lovingly assembled in tribute, as the 'King' deserves.\"\n\nRonaldo Rodrigues, who was first in line for the tomb, lauded his visit: \"It surpassed my expectations. It's a really beautiful place. I hope lots of tourists will come visit and get to know a little about Pele's story, what he represented for Santos, Brazil and the entire world.\""
