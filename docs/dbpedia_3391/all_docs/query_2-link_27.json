Given we don’t have an actual LB in the squad I was somewhat surprised by that comment.\n\n• Pablo Perez has only just come back from 3 months out and getting minutes with Sevilla Atlético so we might see him later in the season, but same can be said about other players from the B team, depending on how situations play out.\n\nThat’s a good point, I’m pleased that Suso is getting the hang of things and looks much better in the last 6 or so games. Also hope O’Campos can get back to free scoring, though I think YEN’s presence reduces his scoring opporutnities.\n\nThe Troika of Fernando, Carlos and Koundé seems to make us more solid, so Gudelj must work his ass off in place of Fernando.\n\nHope that Escudero stays out of the rough challenges and gets his match fitness and game together.\n\nFinally, hope that YEN gets another hat-trick and takes the Pichichi seriously."
