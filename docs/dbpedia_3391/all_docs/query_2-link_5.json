        "text": "Outstanding 25-man squad, although only two centerbacks? I know it's their weakness, along with goalies, but I would have included Aldair ahead of D Alvim. Still an excellent selection, I cannot disagree on anything else.\n\nVery good list and line up Peru.\n\nHowever I have a few minor details (from a Brazilian fan point of view):\n\n1- CB:\n\nAldair is kinda underated - should be in TOP5\n\n2- RB:\n\nIt's a very very close call between D.Santos and Carlos Alberto in #1, (like most expert list would put Carlos name first) but its ok in either case.\n\n3- DM:\n\nIts funny to see Cerezo as #1 in DM!!! He was NOT a DM in first place, and even we like him to be one, Dunga or Clodoaldo would be a MUCH BETTER choice.\n\nHere, Dunga and Coloaldo should be in TOP3. Move Cerezo into Center Midfield\n\n4- FW\n\nYou missed Dirceu in the FW list - he was even better than Edmundo and Robinho in such list.\n\n5- CFW:\n\nR. Dinamite should be a FW (rather tahn CFW or striker)\n\n6- AM vs \"deep-lying FW\n\nI am not sure why you separate \"deep-lying FW\" from FW or AM? as some names were wrongly placed in eitehr position:\n\n- Rivelino should be AM (not a FW in any sense)\n\n- Pele should be a \"deep-lying FW\" category (since you add it in)\n\nOther than that look great!\n\nYou're right about Cerezo, he was always a CM, a very well balanced player in defensive/ofensive skills. In his last years in Serie-A and in his Sao Paulo years, Cerezo was recognized mostly for his playmaking skills, leaving to another ones the defensive job.\n\nNote that Didi and Gerson are described as the most ofensive ones among top CMs, close to be an AM (in fact some years they played AM role in both club and NT level)\n\nhttps://www.bigsoccer.com/community/threads/1980s-decade-all-star-lineup.1864996/page-13\n\nIn #4, you're refering to Dirceu Lopes? I would agree, since he was a #10 in late 60s. Very different to Dirceu Guimaraes ho was an AM and also a Side Mid.\n\nRoberto Dinamite was absolutely a Striker (centroavante)\n\nhttp://www.robertodinamite.com.br/historia.html\n\nIn your #6, i add to your question the FW list. So i'd said that most names in AM/DLF/FW list are usually mentioned as Playmakers or #10 by brazilian experts.\n\ntough to make a well balanced team with so manny greats to choose from.\n\nformation will be 3-4-1-2 and there is no place for garincha since i play with upcoming backs no need for real wingers in this formation\n\ngoal : (this is easy brazil always had terrible keepers with the exception of) : gilmar\n\nleftback : branco (very underrated nowadays but just as good as roberto carlos in the upcoming and better in the defending).\n\nrightback : carlos alberto (the best upcoming back they had)\n\ncentral defender : domingos da guia\n\ndefensive midfield : toninho cerezo (maybe dunga was slightly better but cerezo was one of my favorite players)\n\nleftmidfield : roberto rivelinho\n\nrightmidfield : socrates\n\nplaymaker : didi\n\nshadow forward : zico\n\nleft forward : pele (the man was 2 footded enough to play in this position)\n\nright forward : jairzinho ( garincha was a better winger in terms of dribbling etc but jairzinho was way more efficient in keeping pace in the game and also the better goalscorer then garincha)\n\nimo this is the best possible solution. maybe it lacks a bit of defensive strength on midfield but with so many great attacking talented players they must be able to beat almost all all time teams (except for the dutch and the argentinians)\n\nAnd thanks you to confirm that as well ... Cerezo was often called a \"Deep Lying Playmaker\" - like a Xavi + Pirlo /2 (not so seep as Pirlo and more active like Xavi)\n\nBoth Didi and Gerson were also playmaker for the team 60% AM and 40% CM\n\nYes that Dirceau was a skillful AM/FW that people underated due to Brazil downtime\n\nI agree that Dinamite was a \"center forward\" for his team most career, but I meant his style was more like a Tevez/Del Pierro (FW and SS) than a true striker like Nisterooy/Crespo\n\nWho told you that? understood you have a good knowledge in football, especially for Holland/Netherland but this is BRAZIL and I can assure CEREZO was NO DM at all.\n\nThe ONLY time he had to play like (not quite though) a DM was for Brazil at WC (since others Zico Socrates Falcao Eder ... all had better attacking skills than him)\n\nNow it's hard to find and list out all games he played in formation but just one example from 1 expert:\n\nRead the bold highlight:\n\nthe DM would be hardly a \"bullet to fire the forwards up in attack \" (Playmaker role)\n\nA DM would NEVER get another DM (Bakero) to \"mark tight on him and to stop his magic\" - It's so funny to see if a Xabi Alonso would do a marking on an Essein or Makelele to \" STOP their magic'\" ???\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2009/07/seba_veron_an_heir_to_cerezo.html\n\nA couple of decades ago when I worked in the West End of London, I used to frequent a little Italian café, sadly no longer in existence, so I could watch the Serie A on theirsatellite TV.\n\nThe main draw for me was a Brazilian midfielder called Toninho Cerezo. One of his compatriots once ingeniously described Cerezo as having the appearance of two little men, one on top of the other, both trying to run in different directions. He could indeed look a little ungainly. But few players have ever run a midfield with so much elegance.\n\n​\n\nHe received possession behind the line of the ball, giving him a full panorama of the action in front of him. He passed the ball long and short, and after giving it was immediately on the move to initiate the next phase, and he had an eye for the surprise, killer ball that undresses the defence.\n\nI became addicted to Cerezo towards the end of the 1980s, when he was the heart of an excellent Sampdoria side, making the bullets for the likes of Vialli and Mancini to fire. I was lucky enough to be at Wembley for his last, and biggest, game with the club - the 1992 European Cup final. He was 37, but Barcelona paid him the compliment of putting their best midfielder, Bakero, tight on him to stop him working his magic. Meanwhile, Barcelona had a young midfielder who may not have had the same physical dynamism of Cerezo, but was blessed with a similar capacity to understand the game around him and alter its course with a superb range of passing - Pep Guardiola. ....\n\nThe UNDERLINED did the good justice on what Cerezo was playing and xecelled in!"
