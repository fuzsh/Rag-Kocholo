        "text": "I decided to translate this post about Esporte Clube Bahia. For those who do not know Bahia, it is a traditional Brazilian soccer club from Salvador (in the state of Bahia) that play their home games in the “Arena Fonte Nova” (hosted several 2014 World Cup games) and that have won two times the Brazilian Championship, in 1959 (beating Pele’s Santos) and 1988. The team has some nicknames like “Esquadrão de Aço (steel squadron) and Tricolor. Anyway, let’s move to the original post.\n\nI am a Esporte Clube Bahia supporter and a football history fan. Because of that, initially I decided to make an all-time Bahia XI with its best players ever. However, since I could not pick only 11, I decided to make a squad with 27 players. Nonetheless, even that number was not enough, and, because of some manu unforgetable athletes, I ended up making a list with the 125 greatest footballers in the history of the “Tricolor”: 27 in the main squand and 98 in the “honorable mentions” section.\n\nI chose as criteria of chice the performance of the player and his importance in the main titles of the club and not just his talent and “name” in football. Thus, great names of the sport like Daniel Alves and Rodolfo Rodrigues, because of the small period that they have played for the “Esquadrão”, will not be in the main squad, despite being more talented and greater in the history of the sport than others there.\n\nI hope this list helps younger fans to know a little bit about the great players who have worn the club’s jersey.\n\nLet us go then to the all-time XI, squad and the complete list with the 125 players.\n\nNote: List now with 140 players updated in 08/02/2021.

While playing for Bahia, he was called up for the Brazil National Team and won the 1989 Copa America.\n\nLéo Briglia. This footballer from Itabuna was a great striker for both Flumiense and Bahia. In addition to great football, his career was known for several problems with alcohol and women. He was meant to play the 1958 World Cup, but a knee injury and dental problems hurt his chances.\n\nHe arrived at Bahia in 1959 and had an immediate impact, being the leading scorer of the Brazilian Championship in 1959 with 8 goals. Briglia even scored a goal in the final against Santos in the legendary Maracanã stadium. He is also the club’s 20th all time leading scorer with 70 goals.\n\nHonorable mentions: Adauri (skillful forward in the late 70’s); Camerino (leading scorer and state champion in 1944); Carlinhos Gonçalves (scored the two goals against Botafogo-BA, game that gave Bahia the state title in 1971 — 37th leading scorer in club’s history with 49 goals);

Baiaco and Mário; Marito, Beijoca, Douglas and Jésum.\n\nBONUS (added in 01/21/2021)\n\nWhen I realized, I had focused to much in indivudal numbers an titles, I’ve decided to make a team with the best players for Bahia, independently of trophies won:\n\nNadinho; Zanata, Roberto Rebouças, Henricão and Romero; Paulo Rodrigues, Douglas, Bobô and San Fillipo; Marito and Beijoca\n\nCharles, Jésum, Buttice, Osni, Baiaco and Florisvaldo are some of the players who could equally be on the above team.\n\nBÔNUS (adicionado em 07/05/2017 e editado em 21/01/2021)\n\nNext another XI, this time with the greatest players on the list, when one consider besides talent, the national and influence of the athlete (including for other teams):\n\nRodolfo Rodriguez; Daniel Alves, Roberto Rebouças, Juvenal Amarijo and Serginho; Paulo Rodrigues, Luiz Henrique and Bobô; Osni, San Fillipo and Dadá Maravilha.\n\nOnce there are not many players from more recent times (fairly, since Bahia had its most glory days in the past), I’ve decided to make a team with only players from 1993 to the present time:\n\nEmerson; Daniel Alves, Fabão, Titi and Serginho; Preto, Bebeto Campos, Talisca and Uéslei; Nonato and Marcelo Ramos.\n\nCOMPLETE LIST WITH THE 125 BAHIA ALL TIME GREATEST PLAYERS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:\n\nNOTE: 140, updated in 2021.\n\nAdauri\n\nAgnaldo\n\nAlberto Leguelé\n\nAlencar\n\nAmorim\n\nAri\n\nArnaldo\n\nÁvine\n\nBacamarte\n\nBaiaco\n\nBayma\n\nBebeto campos\n\nBeijoca\n\nBeto\n\nBiriba\n\nBobô\n\nBombeiro\n\nButtice\n\nCamerino\n\nCarlinhos Gonçalves\n\nCarlito\n\nCharles\n\nClaudio Adão\n\nClaudir\n\nClébson\n\nDadá Maravilha\n\nDaniel\n\nDidico\n\nDouglas\n\nEdinho\n\nEdinho Jacaré\n\nEdson Soares\n\nEliseu\n\nEmerson\n\nEmo\n\nEvilásio\n\nFabrini\n\nFito Neves\n\nFlávio\n\nFlorisvaldo\n\nFreitas\n\nGaguinho\n\nGambarrota\n\nGereco\n\nGil Sergipano\n\nGilson Gênio\n\nGilson Porto\n\nHamilton\n\nHelinho\n\nHenrique\n\nIzaltino\n\nJair\n\nJean\n\nJefferson\n\nJésum\n\nJoão Marcelo\n\nJorge\n\nJorge Campos\n\nJorge Wagner\n\nJurandir\n\nJuvenal Amarijo\n\nLeo Briglia\n\nLéo Oliveira\n\nLeone\n\nLeônidas\n\nLessa\n\nLima Sergipano\n\nLuís Antonio\n\nLuiz Henrique\n\nMaílson\n\nManeca\n\nMarcelo ramos\n\nMário\n\nMarito\n\nMarquinhos\n\nMickey\n\nNadinho\n\nNaldinho\n\nNatal\n\nNenzinho\n\nNildo\n\nNino Paraíba\n\nNonato\n\nOdilon\n\nOsmar\n\nOsni\n\nPaulo César\n\nPaulo Robson\n\nPaulo Rodrigues\n\nPedro Amorim\n\nPereira\n\nPeri\n\nPerivaldo\n\nPicasso\n\nPicolé\n\nPiolho\n\nPreto Casagrande\n\nRaimundo Mário\n\nRaudinei\n\nRenato\n\nRoberto Rebouças\n\nRobson\n\nRobson (“Robgol”)\n\nRobson Luis\n\nRodolfo Rodriguez\n\nRomero\n\nRomeu\n\nRonaldo\n\nSan Fillipo\n\nSandoval\n\nSandro\n\nSapatão\n\nSerginho\n\nSidmar\n\nTalisca\n\nTarantini\n\nTeixeira Gomes\n\nTintas\n\nTirson\n\nTiti\n\nToninho\n\nUéslei\n\nVareta\n\nVandick\n\nVelau\n\nVicente Arenari\n\nWagner Basílio\n\nWashinton Luiz\n\nYoyô\n\nZanata\n\nZé Augusto\n\nZé Carlos\n\nZé Eduardo\n\nZé Rafael\n\nZé Grilo\n\nZé Hugo\n\nZé Otto\n\nSOURCES:\n\nMy loving Father, his friends and several others old enough to have seen most of this players .\n\nREVISTA PLACAR. “Os esquadrões dos Sonhos”.
