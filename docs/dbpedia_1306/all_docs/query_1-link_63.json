        "text": "Sometimes lyrical brand mentions lead to major success. Other times, to lawsuits and bans. But each tells a fascinating story.\n\nCherry Cola\n\nWhen the Kinks' Ray Davies wrote Lola in 1970, the song name-dropped a brand in the lyric:\n\n\"Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca Cola…C-O-L-A Cola.\"\n\nMany have said that Coca Cola demanded the lyric be removed from the song. But that is a myth.\n\nVery few brands turn down the free publicity of being mentioned in a hit song.\n\nBut it is true that the song was re-recorded and the Coca Cola reference was taken out and replaced with \"Cherry Cola\" instead.\n\nBut the reason wasn't pushback from Coca Cola. It was pushback from the BBC.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation had a long-standing policy against product placement and anything that smacked of advertising on the public airwaves. Therefore, any song that mentioned a brand name was instantly banned.\n\nSo the Coca Cola lyric in Lola meant no airplay in the UK. And the Kinks weren't about to let that happen.\n\nHe booked a short recording session to switch the lyric from \"tastes like Coca Cola\" to \"tastes like Cherry Cola.\" But he couldn't get a good take, ran out of time and had to rush back to the airport to make the Kinks' next gig in Chicago.\n\nAnd right after that show, he rushed to the airport to fly back to London to try the recording again.\n\nAnd after travelling 16,000 miles, or nearly 26,000 kilometers, he finally got it right.\n\nThe Cherry Cola switch was worth it. Lola became a huge worldwide hit and its success gave the Kinks more creative control and financial comfort from that point on.\n\nBut what happens when a hit song is banned because its title, chorus and overall meaning hinge on a brand name mention?\n\nCover of the Radio Times\n\nCover of the Rolling Stone was released by Dr. Hook in 1972. It was an instant hit in North America.\n\nBut as the song made its way across the pond, it ran into a familiar wall. The BBC refused to play it.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine is, of course, the brand name of a magazine. And thus, its mention was considered an advertisement. So the song was re-recorded.\n\nBet you've never heard this version:\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nRadio Times is also a magazine - but - it was owned by the BBC – and therefore permitted to be mentioned under their guidelines.\n\nBut Dr. Hook didn't re-record the song. Instead, the BBC DJs made their own version, where they simply shouted \"Radio Times\" overtop of every \"Rolling Stone\" mention.\n\nThe \"Radio Times\" single said \"Dr. Hook & Friends\" on the label – the \"friends\" part presumably referring to the BBC disc jockeys.\n\nThe song was rush-released but didn't chart in the UK. Yet the original name-check did work for Dr. Hook.\n\nThree months after the song was released, the band appeared on the March 1973 edition of Rolling Stone along with the headline: \"What's-Their-Names made the cover.\"\n\nFor these stories and more from Under The Influence, click or tap on the \"Listen\" tab to hear the full episode.\n\nYou can also find us on the CBC Radio app or subscribe to our Podcast."
