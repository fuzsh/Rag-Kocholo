        "text": "Born on this day in 1944, Sir Raymond Douglas Davies, CBE, aka Ray Davies, the English singer, and songwriter, best known as the lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and main songwriter for the Kinks, turns 80. In 1990, Davies and the Kinks were the third British band (along with The Who) to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1999, the Kinks classic \"You Really Got Me\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. On 17 March 2004, Davies received the CBE from Queen Elizabeth II for \"Services to Music.\" In 2005, The Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. On 12 June 2014, Davies was inducted into the American Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his honor, check out this 2014 documentary on Ray called \"Imaginary Man\" (above) as well as some of my favorite Ray Davies' Kinks tunes (below)"
