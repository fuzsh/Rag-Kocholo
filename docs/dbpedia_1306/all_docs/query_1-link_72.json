They had not played live in the USA in quite some time so this show scheduled for October 18 at FILLMORE EAST was a “must see” for me. From the very first time I heard YOU REALLY GOT ME on my small transistor radio I knew these guys were different. So when the opportunity to see The KinKs live became a reality I jumped at the chance. Four, balcony seats left side of stage, not too shabby a view and with a great sound system.\n\nThe Bonzo Dog Band opened the show. While the crowd waited for their “hit” URBAN SPACEMAN, we were treated to some of the best comedy, music, and visuals I had ever seen (in my limited experience). Just sheer joy, I laughed hysterically throughout their entire set. The singer pretending he was urinating on the light show, the silly hats they wore, the large eyeglasses, and hundreds of props. They were GREAT. Needless to say I purchased two Bonzo albums the next week.Then the amazing KinKs were introduced. Even though it was a short set and one without their pianist who as Ray Davies said, “cracked his skull” so Ray played piano for a few tunes. Overall, it was a fabulous set. Upon leaving the show I remember thinking, ahhh The KinKs and The Who, two of my favorite bands, all I need is The Stones and The Beatles. BTW SPIRIT, the headliners, hit the stage after The Kinks and were decent but Randy California is NOT Raymond Douglas Davies by any stretch of the imagination. So tonight it was The KinKs.\n\nFebruary 21,1970 Fillmore East (cancelled)\n\nFebruary in New York is always cold and this night February 21,1970 was extremely, extra cold, temperature wise and personally. Tickets were purchased for Savoy Brown, The KinKs, Renaissance, The Voices of East Harlem all at FILLMORE EAST. At the Fillmore The KinKs cancelled out at the last minute making my already sour mood worse.\n\nMarch 26, 1971 SUNY@ Farmingdale\n\nBack in college The Concert Committee was in full force. We got POCO signed up for SPRING BREAK and I petitioned as hard as I could to follow that success up with The KinKs. Finally, the contract was signed and the committee discussed who would announce the band to the audience. My name was offered and I was excited but the name I put out, Ronny, another Kinks fan, was the guy chosen. WOW, we had the KinKs coming to my school and when it was all said and done that show was an experience like no other. I got to greet the band upon arrival and showed the dressing (locker) room to them. They were drinking bottles of gin as part of their pre show preparation. By the time the band hit the show they were intoxicated and intoxicating, amazingly good. I hid a tape recorder in the speaker pod and pressed “record” just as the band hit the stage. After the show I helped to put Ray Davies into a car while his brother already in that car argued that he would not ride in the same car as Ray, so Dave had to be escorted to the second car while the piano player had to be moved to Ray’s car. Ray was now out of his car stumbling around the parking lot. Finally, safely in their cars, away they went. I headed to the bar around the corner with some other Committee members to celebrate our success.\n\nOpened with “Till The End of The Day”, “Mr. Wonderful”,”Sunny Afternoon” “All Day and All of the Night”,”You Really Got Me”, Brainwashed”. A few nights later, the fiasco of The KinKs at Philharmonic Hall occurred.\n\nNovember 21,1971 Carnegie Hall\n\nNovember 21: KinKs@ Carnegie Hall w/ Lindisfarne, a show of shows. I took my new partner to meet all the boys and girls from Brooklyn seated in the three “dress” tiers boxes for which we had tickets.A few cocktails at the bar, a few more at our seats, and we were ready to go.”Top Of The Pops” opens the show, “Brainwashed”,Waterloo Sunset” Victoria” “Acute Schizophrenia…””Big Sky” and the obligatory “YRGM” and “ADAAOTN”.\n\nMarch 3,1972 Carnegie Hall\n\nMarch 3:The KinKs at Carnegie Hall-We couldn’t get enough at the November show so here we go again (about 20 of us) seated once again in the dress circle box. Drinks at the bar, drinks at the seats…”opened with the same song as November “Top Of The Pops”, “You’re Looking Fine” Muswell Hillbillies””Apeman” “2oth Century Man””Skin and Bones”…and all recorded for the “Everbody’s In Show Biz” release. This was a rabid fan base, with paper plates(song requests), a beer duel with Ray during “Alcohol”, and just a supreme appreciation for the artistry known as The KinKs.\n\nNovember 16,1972 Felt Forum\n\nNov 16 The KinKs w/Mom’s Apple Pie @ FELT FORUM The KinKs open with VICTORIA and are still with THE MIKE COTTON SOUND for a few numbers. There is a decent live bootleg (not mine) of this night as the show was recorded for official release.\n\nMarch 31,1973 St.John’s\n\nMarch 31: KinKs/ Argent @ St. John’s Univ.ARGENT “Hold your head up WOMAN” as Rod Argent recently instructed us as to the proper words to his song were amazing as an opening act should be and then The KinKs complete with paper plates a flying. Got some great shots that night also.\n\nApril 6,1974 Felt Forum\n\nApr6: KinKs @ FELT FORUM This was THE PRESERVATION ACT 1&2 Tour with Mike Cotton Sound, Miss Pamela, etc. As much as I love the KinKs this is my least favorite time seeing them in concert and on record. Boring.\n\nNovember 28,1975\n\nNOV 28: KinKs @ BEACON This was one of those SCHOOL BOYS IN DISGRACE shows that I hated. YUCK.The Cockney Rebels opened. Double yuck.\n\nFebruary 1, 1977 Palladium\n\nFEBRUARY 1: THE KINKS (8th time)/ SUTHERLAND BROS & QUIVER @ Palladium . The KinKs are still one of my favs even after the SCHOOLBOYS, the 1 and 2, etc so I needed to see The SLEEPWALKER Tour .The boys opened with ONE OF THE SURVIVORS and closed with VICTORIA, yeah, my Kinda KinKs.\n\nAugust 1,1995 Westbury Music Fair It’s been 18 years since my last KinKs outing…\n\nAug 1: THE KinKs @ Westbury\n\nThe Kinks Return–All Day and All of The Night\n\nThousands Rock at Music Fair\n\nBy Anthony Bosco\n\nAn eclectic group of more than 2,000 came out Monday night to see the Kinks perform the first of two shows at the Westbury Music fair. The band added another performance following a quick sellout of their opening night in the metropolitan area.The band, led by brother Ray and Dave Davies in full force, reunited with former keyboardist Ian Gibbons for a quick tour of the eastern United States that stopped at Long Island this week. It was the first time in two years that the band from England has visited the New York City area.\n\n“The Kinks have just arrived,” said band leader and songwriter Ray, 51, after playing several solo acoustic numbers to kick off the show. “A Well Respected Man,” “Dedicated Follower of Fashion,” and “Stop Your Sobbing” were among the acoustic tunes Davies played before the other four band members joined him on stage. The house lights dimmed and the Kinks ripped through a raucous version of “Do It Again” from the band’s 1984 album Word of Mouth. Several hard rocking Kinks singles followed, including “Low Budget,” “A Gallon of Gas” and “Sleepwalker.” But this was not a night of hard rock. At their most poignant, the Kinks easily slipped in and out of some of their most touching tunes.Reading an impromptu set list from paper plates that littered the stage, Davies led the Kinks in moving versions of “Dead End Street,” “Rock-N-Roll Fantasy” and “Waterloo Sunset.”\n\nWith fans ranging in age from pre-teen to post-middle age, Davies and his cohorts reached all with their trademark hits, including “Come Dancing,” “You Really Got Me,” “All Day and All of the Night” and “Lola.”Dressed in a Union Jack suit, Davies said, “Who knows, this might be the last time?” before leading the band in the English anthem “Victoria.” The set was short, lasting no more than an hour and 45 minutes, but the Kinks, as always, didn’t let their core group of fans down, nearly spanning a career of more than 30 years in just one night.\n\nThe Kinks, formed in 1964 by the brothers Davies, were part of the first British invasion of the Beatles, Rolling Stones and the Dave Clark Five. A series of commercial failures and disappointing record sales has not forced the band into retirement but into another phase of its musical history.A new acoustic CD called To the Bone has already been released in Europe and is slated for release here in the states in December or January. Davies has also recently released his first book, an autobiographical yarn called X-Ray, available in Europe and slated to be released on this side of the Atlantic in the fall.\n\nThe Kinks are scheduled to be back in New York City next month for a one-night show in Manhattan.\n\nRAY DAVIES(Storyteller-Solo-The 88)\n\nOctober 19,1995 Academy on 43rd\n\nOct 19: RAY DAVIES Storyteller #1 The Academy on 43rd\n\nRAY DAVIES NYC ? Unplugged?(author unknown)\n\nThere was much to enthuse over. Davies ran through most of the Kinks’ hits in unplugged mode; himself on acoustic guitar with one guitarist accompanying him. This nudged the audience into realising what fine, durable songs they are: 30 years on, not one sounds dated or immature. We have long known that Waterloo Sunset, Days and Lola are classics; this treatment conferred equal status on minor hits such as Autumn Almanac and Dead End Street. Between classics , Davies read excerpts from his autobiographical X-Ray and told anecdotes: upstaging the Beatles on a package tour, growing up in Muswell Hill with younger brother Dave and older sisters. Mum frowned on the girls playing Billy Eckstine’s That Old Black Magic: the words were too sexy. Davies then sang it, a cappella, with a cheeky smile. “Mum was right,” he said finally: If you could bottle his charm you’d be rich\n\nFebruary 17,1996:Ray Davies: Storyteller@ WestBeth Theatre\n\nFeb 17: RAY DAVIES @ Westbeth Theatre(program) NYC\n\nPOP REVIEW;The Life of Ray Davies Through Word and Song\n\nBy NEIL STRAUSS FEB. 16, 1996\n\nIn “20th-Century Man: An Evening With Ray Davies,” on Wednesday night at a Westbeth Theater Center decorated to look like an English pub, Mr. Davies of the Kinks chronicled his life in song and spoken word. His account, based on his recent autobiography, “X-Ray” (Overlook Press), took him from normal child to misfit teen-ager to upstart musician to exploited songwriter to wistful old-timer. There was one stage, however, missing from this chronology: the glory years of a star. For Mr. Davies, a life in the limelight was derailed in the late 60’s when he was temporarily banned from touring America and embroiled in a series of lawsuits over music publishing.\n\nDespite a career spent in the shadows of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who, Mr. Davies developed into one of pop’s greatest songwriters. This he demonstrated by performing acoustic versions of “Waterloo Sunset,” “A Well-Respected Man,” “Victoria,” “Dedicated Follower of Fashion,” “Lola” and “The Village Green Preservation Society,” occasionally updating a lyric or two.\n\nFor a songwriter of Mr. Davies’s stature, Wednesday’s show (with Pete Mathison accompanying him on guitar) was surprisingly intimate, honest and well-staged. Sometimes his stories put the audience into a bygone era, as when he played his first hit, “You Really Got Me,” once after conjuring up the song’s recording session and a second time after speaking about its stressful but successful performance when the band was an opening act for a show by a cocky Beatles.\n\nAt other times, Mr. Davies offered new ways of listening to his songs, as when he interpreted “Two Sisters,” about the tension between a sibling who has settled into domesticity and another who lives a luxurious single life, as an analogy for his own jealousy of the freedom of his brother and band mate, Dave.\n\nWhen old songs didn’t fit into Mr. Davies’s narration, he played new ones. Though these numbers depicted specific life experiences — a crush on an art-school student, a kinship with a neighborhood hunchback — Mr. Davies always stepped back in the choruses to make a larger point about pretension (in the first song) or how there is more to a person than can be seen by the eye or an X-ray (in the second). These songs, written in his late-60’s style, showed that Mr. Davies’s powers as a lyricist have hardly waned and that his voice was still capable of hitting the sweet high notes that can turn detailed observation into perfect pop.\n\nThe performance continues through March 3 at the Westbeth Theater, 151 Bank Street, in the West Village.\n\nNovember 8,1996 Ray Davies: Storyteller@WestBeth Theatre (see above- second time)\n\nOctober 20,1997:Ray Davies@ Westbury Music Fair(no notes) w/ Joe Bonamassa\n\nFebruary 27,2010: Ray Davies and The 88@Westbury Music Fair\n\nThe 88 open the show, Ray does his acoustic thing and then rewards the crowd with a stunning, KinKs hits filled electric set with THE 88 backing. Wow, what a way to head out of the place.\n\nOver the last few years I saw DAVE DAVIES twice in small clubs with pick up bands. Not as exciting as a Ray show and not nearly enough to be called a KinKs show, even though he did some KinKs hits. The shows coincided with the release of his autobiography KINK and his album “Bug”."
