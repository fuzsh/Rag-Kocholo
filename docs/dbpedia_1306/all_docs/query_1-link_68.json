        "text": "Sure, Ray and The Kinks recorded arguably the greatest Christmas song ever but is that enough for Ray? Surely not. He just had to go ahead and write a Thanksgiving song. Who does that? Nobody except Ray Davies. Happy Thanksgiving! Lyrics and video below\n\nClick here view Ray Davies is the best songwriter Exhibit A\n\nThanksgiving Day by Ray Davies\n\nAre you going on Thanksgiving Day\n\nTo those family celebrations?\n\nPassing on knowledge down through the years\n\nAt the gathering of generations\n\nEvery year it's the same routine\n\nAll over, all over\n\nCome on over, it's Thanksgiving Day\n\nPapa looks over at the small gathering\n\nRemembering days gone by\n\nSmiles at the children as he watches them play\n\nAnd wishes his wife was still by his side\n\nShe would always cook dinner on Thanksgiving Day\n\nIt's all over, it's all over\n\nIt's all over the American way\n\nBut sometimes the children are so far away\n\nAnd in a dark apartment on the wrong side of town\n\nA lonely spinster prays\n\nFor a handsome lover and a passionate embrace\n\nAnd kisses all over, all over\n\nAll over her American face\n\nIt's all over, it's all over, it's all over\n\n'Cause today she feels so far away\n\nFrom the friends in her hometown\n\nSo she runs for the Greyhound\n\nShe'll spend hours on the bus but she'll reach town\n\nFor Thanksgiving Day\n\nCome on over, come on over\n\nCome on over, it's Thanksgiving Day\n\nCome on over, come on over\n\nCome on over, come on over\n\nCome on over, it's Thanksgiving Day\n\nAt a truck stop a man sits alone at the bar\n\nEstranged in isolation\n\nIt's been a while now and he seems so far\n\nFrom those distant celebrations\n\nHe thinks back to all the mistakes that he made\n\nTo a time when he was so young and green\n\nInnocent days when they both looked forward to that\n\nGreat American dream\n\nNow it's all over, it's all over, all over\n\nAnd all over America people are going home\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day\n\nNow Papa looks out of the window\n\nThe sight brings a smile to his face\n\nHe sees all his children coming back home\n\nTogether on this special day\n\nCome on over, come on over\n\nCome on over, it's Thanksgiving Day\n\nClick here for previous Ray Davies is the best story\n\nLife After Breakfast - Ray Davies\n\nIt's been a while since we checked in with our sporadic Sunday morning Ray Davies series, so let's jump back in with \"Is There Life After Breakfast?\" from Ray's first solo record, Other People's Lives.\n\nIn my opinion, one of the factors that sets the great songwriters apart is being able to write songs that can make you laugh out loud. Writing ballads is easy. In fact, it is so easy that in the history of rock and roll, only three bands have never written a decent \"sad song.\" The first two are The Hives and AC/DC, who have avoided ballads by design. The third band is the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, who have somehow managed to avoid writing good songs in any tempo, mood or genre. Other than that, chances are that even the bar band around the corner can break out a decent tear- jerker written by their bass player sometime after his second divorce.\n\nBut to be funny, that is the next level. Or \"The Chuck Berry Level\" as those in the business call it. Reasonable people can disagree on whether Ray Davies is truly the best songwriter ever (he is) but I would suggest he is truly the funniest songwriter ever. Unless Weird Al counts.\n\nI might be biased towards the song Life After Breakfast because I own a coffee shop and it has been my observation that as humans near the age of 70, meals become the primary source of pleasure. In fact, we become so excited for meal time, we just can't wait and start rushing everything. Breakfast is at 6:30 am, lunch at 11:15 am and dinner at 4:30 pm. After that I suppose it's just FOX News until bed with a bowl of ice cream around 8 pm. In the words of Mick 'n' Keith: what a drag it is getting old.\n\nSong and lyrics below.\n\nLift yourself out of the doldrums\n\nMake yourself a cuppa tea\n\nDrag your emotions out of the gutter\n\nDon't wallow in self pity\n\nWhen you wake up, all of a fluster\n\nThinking life has passed you by\n\nGive yourself a kick up the backside\n\nJump out of bed and punch the sky\n\nIs there life after breakfast\n\nFull of possibilities\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nSo don't live in agony\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nCheer up son, put on the kettle\n\nThere's no point in being glum\n\nMake your mind up, try to forget her\n\nBoil the tea and I'll be mum\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nSo don't live in agony\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nAfter breakfast\n\nLife after breakfast\n\nAfter breakfast\n\nJust because all of the plumbing\n\nIsn't all it used to be\n\nTurn the tap, see, a little bit's coming\n\nThat must make you feel relieved\n\nDon't turn into a total embarrassment\n\nTo your friends and family\n\nGet out of bed, the whole day's ahead\n\nSo take the pills and drink your tea\n\nIs there life after breakfast\n\nFull of possibilities\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nSo don't be so depressive\n\nIs there life after breakfast?\n\nYes there is, after breakfast\n\nRead more: Ray Davies - Is There Life After Breakfast?

There have been many great Christmas songs, but in all seriousness, I think reasonable people can agree \"Father Christmas\" is right near the top of the list. We can also all probably agree that \"Still Love Christmas\" by me is near the top as well. (Ha.) Happy Holidays from all of us at Pencilstorm. Thanks for reading!
