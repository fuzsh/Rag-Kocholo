        "text": "Ray Davies and Donovan are among the 2014 class of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nThe organization announced Tuesday that “Midnight Train to Georgia” writer Jim Weatherly and English songwriter Graham Gouldman also made the cut. Mark James, the writer of “Always on My Mind” — covered by Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson — rounds out the list of five inductees.\n\nThe new class beat out top acts that were also up for nomination, including Madonna, John Mellencamp, Sade, Nile Rodgers and Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nDavies, the Kinks leader singer and chief songwriter, penned the band’s hits “You Really Got Me,” “Tired of Waiting for You” and “All Day and All of the Night.”\n\nScottish singer-songwriter Donovan’s hits include “Sunshine Superman,” “Mellow Yellow” and “Atlantis.” Donovan has collaborated with Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Jeff Beck.\n\nBoth the Kinks and Donovan have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 45th annual Songwriters Hall of Fame gala will be held June 12 at the New York Marriott Marquis."
