        "text": "Kinks singer songwriter and acclaimed solo artist Ray Davies has been inducted into the US Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nRay was welcomed into the hall alongside Donovan and fellow songwriters songwriters Jim Weatherly, Graham Gouldman and Mark James at a ceremony in New York.\n\nHe was unable to attend the event due to the recent death of his sister. However, Jon Bon Jovi was on hand to close the awards with performances of Kinks hits including You Really Got Me and All Day and All of the Night.\n\nIn a statement, Ray said: ‘I am profoundly honoured to have been inducted into the American Songwriters Hall of Fame and disappointed not to have been at the event in New York but I felt it necessary to be near my family at this sad time of my sister's funeral.\n\n‘I wish to thank everyone at the Songwriters Hall of Fame who voted for me and give a special thanks to all the loyal Kinks fans who have stood by us all these years. I hope to repay such loyal support by trying my best to continue to write songs in the future that are worthy of such an accolade.’\n\nThe event took place at New York City’s Marriott Marquis Hotel on 12 June.\n\nMeanwhile, recent news reports suggested that Ray and his brother Dave Davies are planning on a Kinks reunion with a new album and possible tour in the works."
