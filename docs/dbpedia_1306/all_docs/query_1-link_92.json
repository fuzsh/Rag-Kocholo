        "text": "So here's the story: Back in 1971 Ray Davies wrote a theme song for the ITV series Budgie, starring Adam Faith as a hapless small-time crook. The song came out as a single on Pye the next year, credited to a band called Cold Turkey. Nothing is known about them. They released nothing else before or after.\n\nTake a listen here. Remind you of anyone?\n\nHere's a time line, for a bit of context. Most of these dates are from Doug Hinman's All Day and All of the Night.\n\nApr. 1971: Pye releases the \"God's Children\" EP, the label's final issue of new material from the Kinks.\n\nAug. 1971: The Kinks start recording Muswell Hillbillies. Ray writes \"Nobody's Fool.\"\n\nOct. 1971: Recording finishes for Muswell Hillbillies. The Kinks' five-year contract with Pye elapses.\n\nNov. 1971: The Kinks sign a new contract with RCA; Pye decides to sue the band for failure to deliver the agreed minimum of product. Muswell Hillbillies is released on RCA.\n\nJan. 1972: According to Hinman, Pye releases the \"Nobody's Fool\" single this month. I'm not sure if that's right. The catalogue number (7N 45142) would seem to put it later in the release calendar, and the song wasn't going to receive any TV exposure until later that spring. The single's flip side is a cover of the \"Sesame Street\" theme by a children's chorus called The Street Kids. Production for both tracks is credited to Jimmy Horowitz.\n\nApr. 1972: The second series of Budgie begins, with \"Nobody's Fool\" replacing the previous theme in the opening titles.\n\nWhat with all the talk of possible bonus tracks for reissues of Percy or Muswell Hillbillies, this song came to mind. What do you think?\n\nI bought a copy of this at the time, it was certainly assumed then to be the Kinks, but not credited as such because of the record company move. Being the theme song from a hit TV programme, it got a few radio plays.\n\nThe B-side is the Theme From Sesame Street by the Street Kids and is definitely not the Kinks!\n\nI see there's a copy available on Ebay at a price."
