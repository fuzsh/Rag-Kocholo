        "text": "Anybody who regularly visits the acclaimed Pencilstorm music page knows we like to blow around some serious hot air concerning rock n roll. We do, in all seriousness, know a thing or two about a thing or two and are proud of our work. Still, we concede that rock criticism is a subjective field dominated by losers who would rather write about rock than go out and actually rock. The informed reader is right to take all of our musings with a grain of salt. After all, it is the internet, and we don't even have a podcast. How lame is that?\n\nHowever, like the sun rising in the East or that math formula PIE you once learned, some facts are established and beyond dispute. Reasonable people can agree, Ray Davies is the greatest songwriter the planet Earth has ever produced. FACT.\n\n\"What? That Kinks guy is the best songwriter? You are crazy. NO WAY Pencilstorm guy.\"\n\nOK, just for the sake of argument, we suppose, it's mathematically possible that some other Galaxy has produced a better songwriter than Ray, but the burden of proof is on you my friend. Tune your HAM radio to the stars and find it. Because here on this planet, Ray Davies has written more interesting and better songs than: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Hank Williams, Robbie Fulks, all those show tune guys, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Chuck Berry, Lucinda Williams, Terry Anderson, Steve Earle, Paul Westerberg, Mick and Keith, Dee Dee Ramone, Leonard Cohen, Townes Van Zandt, Loretta Lynn and insert your favorite here_______________\n\nThere is no debate. Ray Davies is the best songwriter and it's really not even close. We will now lay out this case in a systematic and cold blooded fashion. Check Pencilstorm every other Sunday morning for another exhibit of Raymond Douglas Davies genius.\n\nExhibit A: Village Green Preservation Society\n\nWe are the Village Green Preservation Society\n\nGod save Donald Duck, vaudeville and Variety\n\nWe are the Desperate Dan Appreciation Society\n\nGod save strawberry jam and all the different varieties\n\nPreserving the old ways from being abused\n\nProtecting the new ways for me and for you\n\nWhat more can we do?\n\nWe are the draught beer preservation society\n\nGod save Mrs. Mopp and good old Mother Riley\n\nWe are the custard pie appreciation consortium\n\nGod save the George Cross and all those who were awarded them\n\nWe are the Sherlock Holmes English speaking vernacular\n\nHelp save Fu Manchu, Moriarty and Dracula\n\nWe are the office block persecution affinity\n\nGod save little shops, china cups and virginity\n\nWe are the skyscraper condemnation affiliate\n\nGod save Tudor houses, antique tables and billiards\n\nPreserving the old ways from being abused\n\nProtecting the new ways for me and for you\n\nWhat more can we do?\n\nGod save the village green."
