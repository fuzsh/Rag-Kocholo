        "text": "Ray Davies was one of Britain's foremost musicians. Passing in 2017 at the age of 89, he left behind a legacy of incredible work from his various celebrated albums with The Button Down Brass, to song writing with the Rolling Stones, Shirley Bassey and Burt Bacharach. He was much sought after throughout the world, whether arranging, conducting, composing or writing lyrics. He conducted The BBC Radio Orchestra and performed in his own, The Serendipity Strings; his career also saw a resurgence in the 90s as lounge albums featuring his work enjoyed a revival. He won many prestigious awards, including several Grand Prix for composition and the BASCA Gold Badge Award. His singles were well placed in the charts in Britain and Japan, where his albums also had considerable success."
