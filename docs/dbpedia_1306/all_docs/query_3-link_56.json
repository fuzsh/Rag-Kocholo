        "text": "‘A great set of questions. I’m proud to be part of this project.’ Ray Davies on Isle of Noises\n\nBiggest hit Sunny Afternoon (The Kinks),\n\nJune 1966 – No 1; 13 weeks in chart\n\nBiggest Album Kinks, October 1964 – No 3;\n\n25 weeks in chart\n\nCan you recall the sentiment behind writing “Lola”?\n\nIt was about love, but not directly. The song was designed. I didn’t\n\nshow the words to the band. We just rehearsed it with the la-la la-la\n\nLo-la chorus which came first. I had a one-year-old daughter at\n\nthe time and she was singing along to it. But I was bothered by the\n\narpeggio guitar at the beginning. I said, “It’s got to be hit in the first\n\nthree seconds.” Later I went back in the studio and took the phrase at the\n\nend of the verse, C C C C D E, and replayed it at the beginning to\n\ngrab people’s attention. I had a new Martin acoustic guitar which I tracked\n\nthree times all slightly out of time to give it character. And then I put a\n\nNational guitar on top of it.\n\nWhat was the ambition at the turn of the 70s?\n\nThe Who and the Kinks were both on a quest for the same destination\n\nbut went about it in different ways. I did it with things like\n\n“Shangri-La” and “Australia”, what people call the section songs: the\n\nthematic songs. I was trying to set up the idea that songs could be\n\nplaylets, small theatre pieces. To put them in a format so they could be\n\ntreated as more than a three-minute pop song. I will always aspire to write\n\nthe great three-minute song. I’ve not written it yet. “You Really Got Me”,\n\n“All Day and All of the Night” and “Tired of Waiting for You” came\n\nclose. I just know there’s more juice in the tank. Better\n\nperformances. There’s always a better song to sing.\n\nWas it difficult as a writer, with the emerging dominance of the\n\nBeatles and the Stones?\n\nYou know what, sometimes they envied our freedom; we had one thing they\n\ndidn’t have and that was the right to fail. We didn’t have the publicity\n\nmachine the Beatles had. They were more accessible. They had more clearly\n\ndefined roles within the show business society and hierarchy. With the\n\nKinks, sometimes the audience are a little bit hesitant. It’s like, “What\n\nmood are they in today?”, “Are they going to please us or challenge us?” I\n\nthink in a strange way it’s paid off."
