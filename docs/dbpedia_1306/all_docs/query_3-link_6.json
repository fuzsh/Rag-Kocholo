        "text": "Hi, Ray! [He is two hours late.]\n\nHello. Sorry! I’m so busy, in the middle of rehearsing and recording. I’m starting a record of my book, Americana (1). There’s a lot of songs to go in and I’m working out the best way to do it. I develop projects all the time, but I’ve had two or three come together all at once.\n\nAnd you’re due to play at Greenwich Music Time with Hugh Cornwell and Hazel O’Connor later this month. You were quite an icon for the punk-era generation (2).\n\nI don’t know really. It was like Britpop, there was a new energy that put pop music into a new gear. It was nice to be seen as having inspired that, but I’m not a godfather … More a concerned uncle.\n\nTalking about respect, did Bruce Springsteen really once grill you for four hours about how you wrote songs?\n\nWe spent a good afternoon together, and when songwriters get together it’s inevitable that they’re going to talk about songwriting. He’s a great admirer and he’s very knowledgeable about the music.\n\nAnd none other than the Who’s Pete Townshend once said that you should one day become poet laureate, because you invented a “new form of poetry and pop writing” that influenced him “from the very beginning”. You seem to be falling over gushing tributes from pop legends.\n\nThat’s a wonderful thing for Pete to say, but the thing is not to internalise it too much. The book will be my next big show, so the Greenwich gig and others I’m about to do will probably be the last time people will hear certain songs. Because I’m moving on. Once I’ve finished the Americana thing, I might not go back on the road for a while.\n\nYou’re stopping playing the hits?\n\nWell, everyone knows the Kinks’ hits, but Americana is about a body of work that not everyone is familiar with. It goes back to the fact that we were banned from America for four years [from 1965-69] and couldn’t play there.\n\nDid you ever find out precisely why you were banned? It’s rather shrouded in mystery.\n\nYeah, but it’s very complicated. I allude to it in the book Americana. I’m trying to contextualise it in songs. It was a number of things: bad luck, bad management, bad behaviour.\n\nDidn’t you punch an official who called the Kinks “a bunch of Commie wimps”?\n\n[Chuckles] That was one of the issues. I only hit back in self defence!\n\nAnd did you really infuriate an audience by playing You Really Got Me for 45 minutes?\n\nI dread to think. The fact that I can’t remember probably means we did, but when we went back after the ban, in the 1970s, we found a whole new audience. We’d fallen off the radar a bit in the UK, but we were playing stadiums in America and had a huge hit with Come Dancing. It was a new lease of life. It’s been a strange path.\n\nGoing back to the beginning, your creative surge seems to have been triggered by the death of your sister Rene, shortly after she gave you your first guitar.\n\nI think the event itself was quite traumatising. She died on my 13th birthday: my birthday present was the guitar. It would almost be poetic if it wasn’t so tragic. It traumatised me quite a bit at the time. When you’re 13, you don’t know how to take these things anyway. I would have written songs anyway, but I don’t think I would have produced such a … furious output.\n\nWasn’t Come Dancing about her?\n\nIt wasn’t just about her. Or my other sisters. It was about a generation who found their mates and partners by going ballroom dancing.\n\nYou wrote songs about a world that was already disappearing around you. Which is unusual for a young person.\n\nI wasn’t rebelling against the older generation, I was celebrating the wonderful generation of my parents and grandparents. I’m not a traditionalist, but I’m aware of the value of traditions. I’m not saying everybody should be retro, but at the same time it’s too easy to move on and not take something from the past.\n\nWhy do even the chirpiest Kinks songs have an undercurrent of melancholy?\n\nIt’s the nature of the British Isles … damp. We’re on an island, but I’m not a wistful or nostalgic person, generally. I’ve got a wicked sense of humour and a cruel wit. Britain and the English countryside is very dear to my heart, but things like the Village Green Preservation Society are celebrating values, rather than saying we’ve all got to live that way. I try to live in the moment, but when I look back on my songs, they’re a celebration of a time when I was born, even though I’m critical of many things. I don’t know any writer who can create something that hasn’t touched them personally.\n\nWhat was it like when those thoughts – and you – became very public property in the form of smash hits?\n\nThere’s a feeling that your thoughts are being intruded. I remember, with either Sunny Afternoon or Waterloo Sunset, I said I didn’t want anyone to hear it except the family. I didn’t want it put out. But … I write. When I’m gone and only the records are left, they will show that these people existed in this time: these are the values they had; these are the mistakes they made.\n\nHow difficult was it to play at Glastonbury in 2010 when Kinks bassist Pete Quaife had died? While singing Days, in particular, you seemed on the verge of tears.\n\nI heard that he died just before the show. These things happen. People are allowed to mourn. In any other job, you’d be able to take the week off because you’ve had a great loss in your family, but there is an element of the show must go on.\n\nMarianne Faithfull describes the Kinks as “very gothic. Creepy and silent. They never spoke. They were uptight and fearful of everyone. Underneath, there was all this weird dysfunctional family stuff going on.” Do you recognise yourself in that quote?\n\nNo. I think Marianne’s suffering from loss of memory. Marianne was a very friendly person. We did a couple of tours together. I was thinking about her today, strangely enough. I was singing a song, and I said to my musicians: “Can we take it up a key? I’m singing too low. I sound like Marianne Faithfull!” But no, we didn’t speak much as a band. We made records. I wrote about topics that interested me and we lived our own lives. We were called the Kinks, but another suitable name would have been the Misfits.\n\nHow is your brother Dave? (3)\n\nI think he’s all right. He lives in America, so I don’t see him that much. I’d miss him if he wasn’t around. There are some things you have with people you grew up with – everybody has that with their first friends – a connection that remains no matter how long it is since you’ve seen them.\n\nDave has described your brotherly relationship as “like Cain and Abel”.\n\nIt’s more like Satan and Jesus.\n\nWas that great rivalry part of the creative spark?\n\nSibling rivalry’s such an odd term. There’s always rivalry in bands. I always think of that quote in the film The Third Man, where Harry Lime says: “The Italians had wars, fighting, murder, pillage and rape, and they got the Renaissance, Michelangelo, great things in the world. The Swiss have had 500 years of peace and what have they got? The cuckoo clock!” Dave provides fire, or the fuel to light my fire, sometimes. I miss some of that.\n\nAs recently as this week, Dave said he was up for a Kinks reunion. Do you think it will ever happen?\n\nWhen he says he’s up for a reunion, does it say what he’s referring to? He can decorate my house if he wants.\n\nHas he forgiven you for stamping on his 50th birthday cake?\n\nDave has got such a big publicity machine around him, I wouldn’t even attribute that quote to him. This stuff appears in the press but we take it with a pinch of salt in private. Whether we do anything else as the Kinks depends on what people want out of it. I watched the Who at Glastonbury. That was a lovely show and it brought their music to a new generation, which is wonderful. There was obviously a lot of edge between the players who are still alive. The Who were always very business-minded and I admire them for that. I dunno about the Kinks. Such a special band, a bunch of misfits who seemed to gel together.\n\nHow important was your time at Hornsey Art College?\n\nOh, very important. I revere the discipline of great painting. It taught me observation and finding subject matter in the most unexpected places. I didn’t finish the course. I left after two years and formed a band, but it was fascinating, I was attracted by writing British songs about people whose lives weren’t normally documented.\n\nDoesn’t that normally hold back British bands in America? The likes of T. Rex, the Jam and the Smiths didn’t really happen there, perhaps because their concerns were too British.\n\nNo. I think that was a stylised Britishness, people who wore union jack suits for the sake of it, like the Spice Girls. When you get in the American Top 10 with a song that says things about A Well Respected Man, you know you’re on to something. That song wasn’t even meant to be a single. It was a demo. And Come Dancing was sung in an East End accent!\n\nWhat was the music that first fired you?\n\nFor me personally, it was blues music – Big Bill Broonzy, John Lee Hooker, Spanish guitar playing and a lot of jazz and, of course, I inherited the love of music hall and old English traditional songs. Put that together and you have our music.\n\nWhat do you listen to now?\n\nAnything I get my hands on. I thought the second-tier acts at Glastonbury – below the headliners – were the best bunch I’d seen for a long time. I can’t remember all the names, but some interesting new bands.\n\nAre you still competitive – wanting to be in the charts?\n\nWell, my last record went gold in the UK, but it’s never been on my agenda, right from the beginning. The thing that means most to me is to connect with my audience, play the songs, have a good time and hopefully mean something to people – when people can hear something in the songs that they wish they’d said, and it sums up how they feel about things.\n\nWhere are we at as a nation?\n\nWe don’t have one. The great thing about doing gigs, people think, “It’s OK. Everything’s all right.” The world is media obsessed. How many times can Ed Miliband resign? The poor bastard. It’s a Twitterised, Skypeised infinity. Community was on the way out a long time ago. I saw that happening when I was at school. Years ago, in places like Liverpool or working-class London, people more or less did the same sort of work. Now you’ve got a computer technician living next door to an unmarried mother. Nothing in common socially. And the internet means people don’t have to go out. They can download everything. You don’t need people to exist. Music can be a touchstone for what’s real.\n\nAs someone who writes about people, do you need to be among them?\n\nI do a lot of that. Sit in the pub, watch and talk. I’d hate to live in a society where I couldn’t interact. It’s important to connect with normality. I saw Madonna in Waitrose once. I’m sure Kanye goes to the supermarket.\n\nDo you still live near Muswell Hill, where you grew up?\n\nIn the same area. It hasn’t changed, really. The people have gone. I’ve just been doing a song that I wrote in New Orleans. I’m actually thinking of moving there again. The spirit wants me to fly off somewhere. I played a festival in Norway recently and I quite enjoyed not understanding what people were saying. I lived in New Orleans 10 years ago and, apart from being a dangerous, frightening city with lots of violence and crime, people are more community-spirited, even before the hurricane. The problem is it’s impoverished. I experienced being in hospital in New Orleans. If people think the NHS is bad …\n\nDo you still suffer after-effects from being shot there in 2004, after running after a mugger?\n\nI’ve got a problem with my leg. I’m writing an album about it.\n\nDo songs still come easily?\n\nThey come easily, but finishing them takes a lot longer. I’ve got loads of songs that were never finished. When I get time, I’ll finish them. I’m trying to have a life at the moment. Take holidays. The trouble is, my job’s an 18-hour day sometimes.\n\nOn top of gigs, records, musicals and books, you also do songwriting workshops: what are they like?\n\nJoyous. I love to see people grasp the beauty of just being expressive, and I learn by teaching them. You set a problem and they come up with a solution in a most unexpected way. Creativity brings people together and it makes me realise what I put myself through to become creative myself. It’s something I really want to pursue when I’ve finished making records.\n\nCould you have been – or still be – a teacher or lecturer?\n\nBeing on one of my courses is a combination of between being with Mother Teresa and being captured by the Symbionese Liberation Army (4). No college would hire me.\n\nRay Davies performs alongside Tom Jones, George Benson and the Gipsy Kings at Greenwich Music Time at The Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London, 23-27 July (greenwichmusictime.co.uk).\n\n(1) Ray’s 2013 book about his love-hate relationship with a country that inspires and frustrates him.\n\n(2) Kinks songs have been covered by the Jam, the Stranglers, the Pretenders and the Fall, among others.\n\n(3) Dave Davies, Kinks guitarist and the other half of pop’s most notorious sibling rivalry, whose 2004 stroke meant he had to relearn how to play guitar."
