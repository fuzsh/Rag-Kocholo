In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards a person named Lola who \"walked like a woman and talked like a man\". Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band's manager, alternate explanations for the song have been spread by fans and drummer Mick Avory.\n\nBritish folk rock songs · 22T\n\nTransgender-related music · 18T\n\nSongs banned by the BBC · 23T\n\nDavid Watts Song by The Jam\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\n\"David Watts\" is a song written by Ray Davies that originally appeared on the Kinks's 1967 album Something Else by the Kinks.
