        "text": "Rasa is probably the most underrated performer in the history of rock n roll. She was nevercredited although she is all over the Kinks mid to late 60s stuff when they were at their peak.\n\nThis song was described by critic Robert Christgau as the most beautiful in the English language. Whether you agree or not, can you imagine it being described as such without Rasa’s harmonies?\n\nCheers,\n\nGeoff\n\nOnly recently did I start hearing this about Rasa, and her contributions to Ray's work:\n\nFrom the History of Rock and Roll in 500 songs:\n\n\"For years, I thought it was an interesting coincidence that Ray Davies’ songwriting ability follows a curve that almost precisely matches that of his relationship with Rasa. At the start, he’s clearly talented — “You Really Got Me” is a great track — but he’s an unformed writer and most of his work is pretty poor stuff.\n\nThen he marries Rasa, and his writing starts to become more interesting. Rasa starts to regularly contribute in the studio, and he becomes one of the great songwriters of his generation. For a five-year period in the mid-to-late-sixties, the period when their marriage is at its strongest, Ray writes a string of classic songs that are the equal of any catalogue in popular music.\n\nThen around 1970 Rasa stops coming to the studio, and their marriage is under strain. The records become patchier — still plenty of classic tracks, but a lot more misses. And then in 1973, she left him, and his songwriting fell off a cliff. If you look at a typical Ray Davies concert setlist from 2017, the last time he toured, he did twenty songs, of which two were from his new album, one was the Kinks’ one-off hit “Come Dancing” from 1983, and every other song was from the period when he and Rasa were married.\"\n\nEpisode 155: “Waterloo Sunset” by the Kinks\n\nEpisode one hundred and fifty-five of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs looks at “Waterloo Sunset” by the Kinks, and the self-inflicted damage the group did to their career be…\n\nBetween Ray and John . Ray is a much bigger jerk.\n\nAccording to Dave in an interview with The Telegraph, Ray made Dave's 50th birthday in 1997 all about him: \"Just as I was about to cut the cake, Ray jumped on the table and made a speech about how wonderful he was, and then stamped on the cake.\"\n\nAnd while Dave told Rolling Stone that a reunion was \"possible\" but \"it's all water under the bridge now, just four months later he told the Daily Mail that he was less \"maybe\" and more \"hell no.\" \"Ray's an a**hole ... sucks me dry of ideas, emotions, and creativity,\" he said, also calling him \"toxic\" and a \"control freak.\"\n\nRead More: https://www.grunge.com/249838/why-t...vies-cant-stand-each-other/?utm_campaign=clip\n\nAdd to that how he treated Chrissie Hinde…\n\nOnly recently did I start hearing this about her, and her contributions to Ray's work:\n\nFrom the History of Rock and Roll in 500 songs:\n\n\"For years, I thought it was an interesting coincidence that Ray Davies’ songwriting ability follows a curve that almost precisely matches that of his relationship with Rasa.

I agree that the quality did drop off in 1973, but he started to rebound with the last RCA album, \"Schoolboy's in Disgrace,\" and he put out a lot of very good stuff during the Arista years and beyond, when most of his contemporaries were no longer doing anything very impressive.\n\nBetween Ray and John .

I'm not saying he didn't, I just haven't heard any stories. I know Ray claimed to be surprised when she married Jim Kerr of the Simple Minds while out on tour with him, and I don't think he paid much attention to their daughter.\n\nHere's a Kinks tune with an uncredited Hynde singing \"Gucci, Gucci, Gucci/Cartier, Cartier.\"\n\nBe careful what you wish for.
