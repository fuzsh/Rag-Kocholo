        "text": "Ray and Dave Davies saying they’re making music for a new Kinks album feels like the musical equivalent of Charlie Brown and Lucy holding the football, but apparently, it’s really happening this time.\n\nDave Davies told Rolling Stone that work on the new album, “…has really been going on for a couple of years. We keep going backwards and listening to a lot of old stuff. Some of that is very good, and some of it needs a bit of work.”\n\nThe Davies brothers have been working with original Kinks drummer Mick Avory on new songs written by Ray Davies, but they’re also going through their archive and finding previously unreleased tracks and re-recording them and finishing incomplete demos. Dave said, “Ray is still dissecting various other material we might use. The intention is to get the work out, but it’s not a done deal.”\n\nAnother project expected from The Kinks in October is a 50th anniversary reissue of Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire, which, according to Dave, is “…virtually done. It’s a really, really interesting package that’s going to have other songs from that time period like [my solo song] ‘Hold My Hand.'”\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
