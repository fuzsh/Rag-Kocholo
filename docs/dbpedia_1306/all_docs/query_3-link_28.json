He was the seventh of eighth children, and with his younger brother Dave, he was one of the only two boys in his family. In 1963, he joined Dave's band The Ravens on rhythm guitar and vocals.

        "text": "In an early stage of The Kinks, before Davies was willing to be the lead singer, they recruited Rod Stewart (who grew up in the same area as the Davies brothers, Muswell Hill) as a singer. After a couple of weeks of trying to be a band, Stewart and the future Kinks found that they did not get along that well, with their musical tastes being too different, and parted ways.\n\nWhen The Kinks opened a show on the same bill as The Beatles, The Beatles (in particularly John Lennon) behaved rudely and dismissively towards them. However, when The Kinks released their more introspective album \"Face to Face\", Lennon was said to have listened to it obsessively.\n\nOne of the most admired British songwriters, his songs have been covered by hundreds of artists. Well known versions of his songs include The Jam's \"David Watts\", The Pretenders' \"Stop Your Sobbing\", The Stranglers' \"All Day and All of the Night\", David Bowie's \"Where Have All the Good Times Gone\" and Van Halen's \"You Really Got Me\".\n\nWith four to five band members at one time, there have been 11 members of The Kinks, with only Ray and his brother Dave Davies having belonged since the founding of the group. They have gone through two drummers (Mick Avory and Bob Henrit), three keyboardists (John Gosling, Gordon Edwards and Ian Gibbins), and four bass-guitarists (Peter Quaife, John Dalton, Andy Pyle and Jim Rodford).\n\nHe was awarded the Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 Queen's New Years Honours List for his services to the Arts. He is a musician in London, England.\n\nIn late 1962, Davies became increasingly interested in music; at a Hornsey College Christmas dance he sought advice from Alexis Korner who was playing at the dance with Blues Incorporated and Korner introduced him to Giorgio Gomelsky, a promoter and future manager of the Yardbirds.\n\nDavies was in many ways unique among the frontmen in British rock bands from the 1960s. He never got into drugs or affiliated himself with \"hippie\" culture (nor did his band), although The Kinks did present themselves as hard-drinking. Davies was also never a Lothario in the ranks with his contemporaries, and he married at a very young age. By all accounts a quiet, unapproachable type off stage, Davies had a series of nervous breakdowns as a young man, which led to him being hospitalized twice.\n\nDirector Wes Anderson originally intended to have the whole of Rushmore (1998) set to songs by The Kinks. Anderson changed his mind when he wanted to use a series of songs by other bands from the \"British Invasion\", although he kept the Davies/Kinks song, \"Nothin' In This World Can Stop Me Worryin' 'Bout That Girl\"."
