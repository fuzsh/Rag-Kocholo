        "text": "I have been asked why I used a woman in the artwork I created inspired by the song “COME DANCING”. Well, there is a reason.\n\nThe seemingly happy catchy song was written by Ray Davies in 1982 and recorded in 1983. His sister’s visit to England (she had emigrated to Canada) happened to coincide with Ray Davie’s 13 birthday. He had begged his parents for a Spanish guitar, to no avail. Rene stepped in and got it for him (his first guitar!).\n\nThen she did what she always did when she was in town – she called her friends to go dancing that night. So – off she went to the Lyceum ballroom. But, she suffered a fatal heart attack, as a result of a childhood bout of rheumatic fever.\n\n“Rene had died dancing in a ballroom in London in the arms of a stranger….Coming back from Canada, where she’d emigrated, to die. Really, and again, being a source of inspiration…She gave me my first guitar, which was quite a great parting gift.” Ray Davies\n\nFinding stories like this are one of the reasons I love working on this series “CAN YOU SEE WHAT I HEAR?”. I also learn to play each song on the piano.\n\nI usually do a collage using research materials I collected for the painting. Look closely at this collage. You can see where I hand wrote the beats for the tricky timing in the opening!\n\nYou can read more about the series and my quest for the series “CAN YOU SEE WHAT I HEAR?” series HERE. Each piece I create is inspired by a song that I also learn to play. Why? to bring awareness to dementia, because music is the last memory, the one thing you will keep.\n\nIf you have a favorite song you’d like to see represented, I’d love to know."
