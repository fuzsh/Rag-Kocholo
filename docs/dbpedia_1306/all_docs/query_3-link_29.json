Enjoy! - Colin G.\n\nClick here for Ray Davies is the best songwriter exhibit H\n\nThe Kinks - \"Working at the Factory\" written by Ray Davies\n\nSure, Think Visual isn't a masterpiece relative to other Kinks efforts, but as always, it has a number of gems scattered throughout. Considering this is TWENTY FIRST album released by The Kinks makes the it that much more impressive. Or put another way, has your favorite band released twenty- one records? That's what I thought. Get bent. Ray Davies is the best.\n\n\"Working At The Factory\"\n\nAll my life, I've been a workin' man\n\nWhen I was at school they said that's all you'll ever understand\n\nNo profession, I didn't figure in their plans\n\nSo they sent me down the factory to be a workin' man\n\nAll I lived for, all I lived for\n\nAll I lived for was to get out of the factory\n\nNow I'm here seemingly free, but working at the factory\n\nThen music came along and gave new life to me\n\nAnd gave me hope back in 1963\n\nThe music came and set me free\n\nFrom working at the factory\n\nAll I lived for, all I lived for\n\nWas to get out of the factory\n\nAll I lived for, all I lived for\n\nWas to get out of the factory\n\nNever wanted to be like everybody else\n\nBut now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf\n\nThey sold us a dream but in reality\n\nIt was just another factory\n\nI made the music, thought that it was mine\n\nIt made me free, but that was in another time\n\nBut then the corporations and the big combines\n\nTurned musicians into factory workers on assembly lines\n\nAll we live for, all we live for\n\nAll we live for is to get out of the factory\n\nWe made the music to set ourselves free\n\nFrom working at the factory\n\nAll my life I've put in a working day\n\nNow it's sign the contract, get production on the way\n\nTake the money, make the music pay\n\nWorking at the factory\n\nAll I lived for was to get out of the factory\n\nNever wanted to be like everybody else\n\nBut now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf\n\nThey sold us a dream that in reality\n\nWas just another factory\n\nWorking at the factory"
