        "text": "Brooklyn based Israeli Rocker Yosi Piamenta, affectionately nicknamed The Hasidic Hendrix, and Sephardic Santana by members of the press, continues \"Bridging The Gap”, between peoples of different cultural backgrounds through the music of his \"Heavenly Jams Band\".\n\nMr. Piamenta, who was discovered, and brought to America, by Jazz legend Stan Getz 30 years ago, is a major star in the world of religious Jewish music. Together with flutist brother Avi Piamenta, The Piamenta Band became an extremely popular live act, injecting a frenetic fusion of Judeo-Arabic Oriental music, with its quarter-tones and wild spiraling improvisations, with classic rock wha-wha guitar riffs and manic flute interplay.\n\nIn June of 2004 Yosi, & Oteil Burbridge, bassist of The Allman Brothers Band, came together in NYC for a loose jam jokingly billed as the “Heavenly Jams Band”. The well received show led to a number of different collaborations with American born musicians all sharing Yosi’s passion for musical improvisation and exploration.\n\n“Bridging The Gap” continues the HJB vision of opening listeners up to different genres of music. Joining him on this release are members of the Derek Trucks Band, Kenwood Dennard, and other renowned musicians from the worlds of rock, blues, and Jazz."
