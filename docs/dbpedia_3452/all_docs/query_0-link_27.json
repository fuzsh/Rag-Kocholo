Diskin added that the family has “no idea how much Yehuda did in defense of the state”.\n\nYehuda Piamenta is also the father of Avi and Yossi Piamenta of the famous musical troupe by the same name.\n\nThe family is sitting at the Lorber home in Kfar Chabad.\n\n10:00 Shachris\n\n4:45 Mincha\n\n5:30 Maariv\n\nShiva until 11:00 pm"
