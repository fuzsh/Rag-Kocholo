Never before has so much raw talent been jam packed into one album. Each and every artist on this album is an acclaimed Jewish musical mastermind and main event in their own right. However, together they have compiled a legendary tribute album that will no doubt be documented as not only an epic collection of recordings but one of the most incredible music productions in Jewish music.",

        "text": "Baruch Chait\n\nBaruch Chait is an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi and musician composer. He is also the Rosh Yeshiva of the Israeli high-school Maarava Machon Rubin. He is the son of the Rabbi Moshe Chait, the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivath Chafetz Chaim of Jerusalem, and a student of the Rabbi Henoch Leibowitz, former Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim of Kew Gardens Hills, NY.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Chait has composed hundreds of Jewish religious songs that still have wide popularity and appeal. Included in this list is his original composition, \"Kol haOlam Kulo.\" He founded several bands including The Rabbis' Sons and Kol Salonika and has published dozens of records.\n\nMoshe Hecht\n\nIn a music world dominated by Auto-tune and overproduction, Hasidic indie-folk artist Moshe Hecht challenges the status quo of hype over substance with his debut album, Heart is Alive, released October 18th 2011. The album - produced in Seattle by seven-time Emmy winner and Grammy-nominated producer Steven Ray Allen - marks Hecht's much anticipated entrance onto the current folk-revival scene. He has already garnered fans worldwide and played internationally to popular reception with The Moshe Hecht Band, an eclectic group of musicians from diverse backgrounds. The songs on Heart is Alive show a return to true, humble music that celebrate life's everyday moments. Moshe masterfully mixes meaning with melody, telling stories through his music in the vein of Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel - all with a distinctly Hasidic twist.\n\nNavigating through multiple genres including classic rock and reggae, Moshe uses organic arrangements and his soulful, engaging voice to spread messages of inspiration that speak to people from all walks of life. The title track off the album, weaving English and Hebrew lyrics together over a delicate acoustic guitar, rouses listeners to be spiritually stirred. Moshe's overarching theme echoes the Hasidic concept that inspiration can come from the ordinary and mundane, illustrated most poignantly on the grooving rock track \"Inspire Me,\" and \"When I'm In Need\" - a powerful song inspired by a humbling encounter with a homeless man Hecht met in Jerusalem. Throughout Heart is Alive, the production channels the intimate quality of the live music experience and Hecht's authentic, uncompromising approach shines.\n\nVisit the Moshe Hech Band Website or Become a Facebook Fan of Moshe Hecht\n\nZevi Kaufman\n\nWhile most singers find themselves in and out of the recording studio in the final weeks before the release of their album, Kaufman finds himself in and out of the Bais Medrash at Yerushalayim’s Yeshivas Aderes Hatorah, where the 20-year-old Flatbush native is currently learning.\n\nKaufman’s style is also anything but typical. His debut album, Music Language of My Soul, is one of those rare efforts that manages to push the envelope just enough, without ever crossing the boundaries of good taste. His unique compositions have a universal appeal and are edgy enough to appeal to those who don’t necessarily embrace mainstream Jewish music without ever sacrificing even an ounce of Yiddishe ta’am, resulting in songs that have a universal appeal. Half the songs on this album are in English with lyrics that are hopeful and inspiring, each one bearing a message of its own. Every song on the album is accompanied by a D’var Torah, each one dedicated to someone who clearly had a tremendous impact on Kaufman’s life.\n\nWhile Kaufman, a Miami Boys Choir alumnus who also sang with Avrumi Flamm, has been singing all his life, he began composing songs about the time of his Bar Mitzvah. Over the past seven years his songs have offered both solace and encouragement to so many people that Kaufman decided it was time to put out an album and share his positive messages with the world. Kaufman credits his Rosh Yeshiva and Rabbeim from Yeshiva of Far Rockaway where he learned for five years for inspiring him with ideas of chizuk and mussar from the Navardik school of thought.\n\nBecome a Facebook Fan of Zevi Kaufman\n\nNochi Krohn\n\nAlmost a year ago the Nochi Krohn Band released the long awaited follow up to the critically acclaimed debut album “Ananim”. The new album entitled “Banai” was a robust album filled with life and raw emotion. ALL of the songs and arrangements are very musical and diverse. The album connected with people in more than just an entertaining way. The title track “Banai” featured special guest, R’ Yosef Karduner. This song was so special with a positive message that we needed Reb Yosef to convey it to the listener. Now as Tisha Bav approaches, is the perfect time to re-release the song as an A Capella single. The song speaks about Hashem talking to us telling us that every mitzvah and action counts, no matter how small.\n\nShalom Levine a\"h\n\nShalom Levine was Moshe Yess's partner in the Megama Duo. Their goal in creating Megama was to communicate the beauty and values of Judaism through American-style music. They toured for more than three and a half years together. One tour, which consisted of 32 shows in 29 cities, lasted 42 days. \"My Zaidy\" was Megama's biggest hit. The well-known disc jockey of the WEVD radio station in New York, Art Raymond, claimed that it was the most requested song he had in eighteen years of broadcasting.\n\nShalom's soul was taken from this world a few days before the second Yahrtzeit of Moshe Yess, just after recording the Yess Legacy tribute album and will be dearly missed by his family, fans and all who knew him.\n\nBecome a Facebook Fan of Shalom Levine\n\nAvraham Rosenblum\n\nThe Original Diaspora Yeshiva Band was formed in 1975 by Avraham Rosenblum, a multi-talented composer, singer and guitarist who led the band through several incarnations over an eight year period. The group took its name from the noble (although at that time a bit wild and wooly) institution in the heart of Jerusalem where its members studied Torah. They were among the first wave of Baalei Teshuva, returnees to Jewish religious practice who somehow managed to survive the 60s and return to the fold.\n\nWhenever the band appeared on stage – whether on a Motza’ei Shabbos overlooking the rooftops of Har Zion, or at big venues such as Israel’s Hasidic Song Festival – the players looked pretty Yeshivish (the funky hat or two being the only giveaways). But when they turned on their amps and cut loose, it wasn’t Cantorial music that came out, but an original decoction of what they called ”Country and Eastern Music”: Tehillim, Bluegrass, Chassidic Niggunim, and Rock’n'roll.\n\nVisit Avraham Rosenblum's Website or Become a Facebook Fan of Avraham Rosenblum\n\nLenny Solomon\n\nLenny Solomon is the lead singer of Shlock Rock, an independent Jewish rock band, put together in December 1985, and officially founded in 1986, which parodies popular secular songs, substituting new, religious-themed lyrics for the music. To date they have released 32 albums. Shlock Rock continues to record albums and perform live as of 2010, and to date has sold more than 200,000 CD’s, tapes and DVDs in the contemporary Jewish Rock arena. Their music is a mix of pop-rock song parodies and original rock songs in English and Hebrew. The purpose of the band is to spread Jewish pride, identity and awareness throughout the Jewish community, for Jewish continuity. Lenny Solomon and Shlock Rock tour around the world, playing at concerts, schools, and Jewish events.\n\nVisit the Shlock Rock Website or Become a Facebook Fan of Lenny Solomon\n\nGershon Veroba\n\nHe sang from when he was a child in his father's choir and for friends, but Gershon Veroba's professional career actually began in 1980, when he recorded as a singer, keyboardist and even a drummer in a band formed by guitarist, Steve (Shmuel) Simenowitz, called Jewish Blues on a now-collectible album called \"Out Of The Woods\" Nova Records, Lake Ronkonkoma, NY, also starring the late blues legend, Roy Buchanan.\n\nTo date, he now has been featured on over 50 albums, plus 12 solo albums of his own. Through the 90's, he became known for performing adaptations and parodies of mainstream pop songs, re-written with Jewish themes, some in Hebrew, but mostly in English. The \"Variations\" album series, featured him as the main artist for its four-volume run between 1993 and 2004. Gershon produced his own adaptation album, \"Impressions\" in 2003 and produced an all-star sequel, \"Second Impressions: Don't Stop\" in May, 2009. His return to original compositions culminated in the 2007 release, \"Reach Out,\" which contained 7 English songs of his own that had strong messages of Jewish life and introspection rarely, if ever, attempted by Jewish music previously. This included a song telling of a person's questioning G-d's silence, \"Speechless,\" co-composed by his friend, Chassidic superstar Avraham Fried.\n\nHis unique role in the Jewish music business as a \"bridge\" between secular and Jewish music has become a source of admiration and controversy. Many fans and even hard line rabbis have praised his work as having the rare qualifications of valid fusion between delicate religious Jewish acceptance and the mainstream pop culture of the Diaspora. Others have criticized him, grouping him with those who encourage the dangerous influences of the non-Jewish culture.\n\nThousands of fans and continued to support his music and his views, seeing him perform around the world, including Nassau Coliseum, Lincoln Center and Town Hall in NY, on the Chabad Telethons and receiving a resounding stamp of approval from scores of major performers who have seen him or performed with him, including the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, zt\"l, Mordechai Ben-David, Sam Glaser, Safam, Mike Burstein, Gad Elbaz, Blue Fringe, Freddy Roman, Robert Klein, Paula Abdul, Jon Voight, Steve Allen, Jackie Mason and others. In the years he has remained in the spotlight, many younger Jewish musicians and performers claim Gershon to be a major influence on their work.\n\nVisit Gershon Veroba's Website or Become a Facebook Fan of Gershon Veroba\n\nBenny Friedman\n\nOne of the fastest rising stars in Jewish music, Benny Friedman has made a name for himself, not by being a member of one of Jewish music’s royal families, but by consistently proving himself to be talented, versatile and one of the nicest people in the Jewish music business.\n\nBenny’s musical career began at age thirteen when he began performing at small local events and audiences were mesmerized by his dazzling voice. Passionate about both singing and his ability to inspire people through music, Benny spent four years working with elite Hollywood vocal coach Seth Riggs and Jewish music lovers everywhere began to buzz about the talented newcomer with the golden voice.\n\nBenny split his time between recording his debut album Taamu with legendary producer Avi Newmark and making appearances all over the country. One of the most highly anticipated debut albums in Jewish music history, Taamu was hailed as both the best debut album ever produced and 2009?s album of the year, firmly cementing Benny’s place as one of Jewish music’s elite.

He performs in an average of fifty cities a year and his energetic style and passionate delivery never fails ignite the spirit of audiences of all ages.

Yossi immediately fell in love with his guitar. He was so obsessed that his grades started dropping. At that point Yossi’s father smashed his guitar. Yossi was depressed and couldn’t eat for 2 months. After seeing Yossi’s heart broken, his parents bought him a real guitar, like no other kid had in Israel.\n\nYossi is a self-taught musician who would turn on the Jerusalem radio and play along. That’s how he learned how to play. He used money from gigs to buy the best audio equipment, international albums and music magazines. Yossi’s self-acquired education led him to become one of the most skillful and original guitarists on the Jewish and secular music scene. Yossi’s original style is best described as a hint of jazz, a drop of blues, and a whole lot of rock 'n' roll filtered through a purple haze of Oriental funk.\n\nAfter finishing boarding school, Yossi joined a “Top 40” cover band as their lead guitarist. Then he joined the army, and played in the Army Band. After completing his army service, Yossi became a full time musician. During the Yom Kippur War Yossi, together with his 15-year old brother Avi, now an international acclaimed flutist, played for the soldiers. After that, Yossi and Avi immediately formed “the Piamenta Band.” The rest is history. The band went on to play with the most prestigious Israeli musicians. They were dubbed the “Mizrahi Rockers.”\n\nIn 1976 Stan Getz discovered the Piamenta Band. 3 weeks later Getz sent Yossi a ticket to America, where Yossi was introduced to the crème de la crème of American musicians. Getz was so impressed with Yossi’s music that he cancelled his schedule for 3 weeks to cut an album with Yossi. The album was so successful that Getz tried hard to sign a lifetime contract with the Piamenta’s but when Yossi saw what went on in the showbiz industry… he declined and ran towards his Jewish roots.\n\nWith 18 official studio albums and appearances at the most distinguished venues in the world, the Piamenta Band is the most requested name in Jewish events. Piamenta Management is planning a tour of colleges and universities. As far as plans for the near future, the Piamenta Band will be working on producing an album with Eddie Kramer, the engineer who cut albums for Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, KISS and more. Piamenta will soon be a household name, God willing.\n\nVisit Yosi Piementa's MySpace Page or Become a Facebook Fan of Yosi Piamenta\n\nAbie Rotenberg\n\nAbie Rotenberg grew up in Queens, New York surrounded by other up and coming religious Jewish musicians, including Eli Teitelbaum, who directed the first Pirchei boys choir, as well as Rabbi Baruch Chait and Label Sharfman who attended yeshiva with him. Rotenberg studied piano and taught himself guitar at a young age\n\nAbie Rotenberg has cited musicians Rabbi Benzion Shenker, and Shlomo Carlebach as strong influences. While his folk-inspired sound and inspirational lyrics are strongly reminiscent of Carlebach, Rotenberg's soft and sometimes melancholic voice, however, contrast with Carlebach's ecstatic style. Rotenberg has collaborated with other Jewish musicians including Mordechai ben David, Avraham Fried, Yehuda Schechter, Yaakov Shwekey, Moshe Yess and Shlomo Simcha with whom he co-starred in Israel National Radio's Miracles 18 concert.\n\nRotenberg has also been a main fixture of the annual HASC A Time for Music concerts.

Born into a family with a long line of cantors and some well-known professional musicians in the family tree, Andy grew up singing hasidic melodies in the afternoon Jewish school his parents sent him to, and listening to show tunes, klezmer, and classics - along with every other variety of music playing within earshot.\n\nIndeed, young Andy had ravenous ears, absorbing the early sounds of rock and roll and the beginnings of the folk revival. But after his brother brought home a vintage record by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, Andy became obsessed with bluegrass, which he would tune into via shortwave radio from West Virginia. He sent away for a method booklet, and picked up the guitar and banjo on his own. Eventually he would discover his love for the mandolin\n\nVisit Andy Statman's Website or Become a Facebook Fan of Andy Statman\n\nAaron Holder\n\nAaron Holder is fast becoming a Jewish music sensation.\n\nHis music is original enhanced by a unique and refreshing voice, which continually brings messages of hope, freedom and values to fans worldwide.
