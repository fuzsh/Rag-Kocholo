Their Brooklyn Bakery Offers a Taste of That World.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

Their Brooklyn Bakery Offers a Taste of That World.\n\nSept. 6, 2018\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, Stanley Mieses, a writer and editor, first accompanied the guitarist Yosi Piamenta to Mansoura Pastries to buy knafeh, an Arabic dessert usually made with shredded phyllo dough. Per Mr. Piamenta’s instruction that day, he ordered the darker, crunchier knafeh pieces from the edges of the pan. It was some of the best knafeh he’d ever tasted in New York.\n\nMr. Mieses, who has since moved to Queens, continues to return to the Mediterranean confectionary in Gravesend, Brooklyn, often after his regular haircuts around the corner. Although he still follows his friend’s advice on selecting knafeh, he will often, admittedly, go overboard in quantity.\n\n“I came out here to buy an ounce, only to buy an outer ring,” Mr. Mieses, 65, said on a recent Friday afternoon of the eight-inch syrupy log he’d just purchased.\n\n“They’ve got the best candy in town,” said Jason Balassiano, 23, another customer who had stopped by while vacationing in nearby New Jersey with his family.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
