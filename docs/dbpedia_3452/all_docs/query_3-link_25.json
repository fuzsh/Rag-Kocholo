        "text": "The first musical collaboration between Yosi & Avi Piamenta & Naftali Kalfa was the album “Yehyu Leratzon” released 6 years ago.\n\nUpon Naftali learning of Yosi’s current medical situation, he composed the song “Yaancha”, which is based on the 20th Psalm. When Naftali went to visit Yosi in NY, they soon found themselves in familiar settings, a recording studio making music.\n\nThis song is produced & arranged by Yosi Piamenta, may he merit a long life until 120!\n\nThe song is dedicated to the speedy recovery of “Yoseph ben Genia” (Yosi Piamenta) and all the sick amongst Israel.\n\nThe Piamenta brothers first started their careers back in the 70’s when they were the first pioneers of their genre and created a rock band with heavy Hasidic and Middle Eastern influences which swept up the youth of that generation and ours. Since then they have been collaborating with big names in music and have performed all over the world.\n\nNaftali Kalfa has released 2 albums. The first was a joint project with the Piamenta brothers, “Yehyu Leratzon”. The second album, released in 2013, “The Naftali Kalfa Project” is a double album. In it Naftali hosts Yosi Piamenta among others.\n\nClick PLAY below to hear the song"
