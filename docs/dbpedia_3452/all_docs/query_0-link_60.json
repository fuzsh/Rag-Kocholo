        "text": "\"It's a tremendous loss. I hope I have a death like his,\" says singer Edna Goren.\n\nA similarly ambivalent response of one sort or another was heard last week from many in the jazz community in Israel, on hearing of pianist Rick Birman's death.\n\nBirman died about two weeks ago while he was playing at a cafe in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"We were playing blues,\" relates contrabassist Eli Magen. \"\"I took a solo, and when I finished and all the other musicians were supposed to start playing again, we didn't hear Ricky.\n\n\"When I looked over at him, I saw him sitting with his hands still on the piano, his head high and his mouth open.\"\n\nAn ambulance was called, but medics were unable to resuscitate him and confirmed his death of a heart attack.\n\nBirman was in his mid-seventies (precisely how old is uncertain). He was an unusual sort of person, an exceptional pianist, and his artistic path was unlike that of other jazz musicians in Israel.\n\nHe always kept a certain distance from the jazz scene, apparently preferring to remain on the outside; yet no one else knew the local jazz scene as intimately as he did. He was among the first jazz musicians in Israel, back in the early `50s, but never recorded an album, not even as an accompanist.\n\nRight up through his last evening, Birman went nightly to jazz performances, and played at most of them, yet never led his own ensemble.\n\nHe was adviser, instructor, and perhaps spiritual mentor to many musicians just starting out, but lacked musical training and probably couldn't read a score.\n\nIn the official history of Israeli jazz, if one focuses on the outstanding streams and the important albums, Birman may be relegated to a footnote, but from the standpoint of the affinity between genre and lifestyle, he will undoubtedly be considered a key figure in the annals of local jazz.\n\nLike his exact age, few details of his biography are known with any precision.\n\nBirman was born in Romania in the late 1920s, arrived in France during World War II or thereafter, and immigrated to Israel in the early `50s.\n\n\"His first exposure to jazz was listening to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong,\" relates his friend Yaacov Gertner, who got to know him shortly after his arrival.\n\nThe two were among the first of Tel Aviv's jazz aficionados, and together would visit the few shops selling jazz records - \"music that was then considered very peculiar and sounded to people as if it was being played by drunks,\" says Gertner.\n\nWhen Birman began playing in the `50s, there were no jazz clubs in Israel yet. At the few nightclubs in the Tel Aviv area, ensembles played tango, mambo, cha-cha and other South American dance music.\n\nLate at night, the musicians would play a little jazz. \"Then Ricky would arrive,\" says P.C. Osherovich, whose group played during the same period at the Park Hotel in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Dance music didn't interest him, and unlike other musicians, he wanted to play only what he loved.\" This pattern, whereby Birman would sit in the audience and come on stage as a guest only toward the end of an evening, persisted all his life, including at his final performance.\n\nBirman was known as a musician with limitations. \"His nickname was `G.C.,'\" relates musician Yossi Mar-Haim, \"because he knew how to play in only two keys - C and G.\n\n\"When I first heard him play, early in the 1960s, I thought he was perfect,\" notes Mar-Haim. \"Very bluesy, and very funky, a word we didn't yet know, of course.\"\n\nAccording to Mel Rosenberg, \"Ricky's `limitations,' in quotes, were one of the things that made me love him. If you see jazz as a language, then there are some people who know all the grammar and talk very correctly, but have nothing to say. Ricky had a lot to say, despite being weak at grammar.\"\n\nWhile Israeli musicians of the Fifties played jazz once in a while in clubs, they were followed in the `60s by a generation who saw themselves first and foremost as jazz musicians: Arele Kaminsky, Goren, saxophonist Albert Piamenta, contrabassist Teddy Kling, and others.\n\nThey attributed their exposure to jazz in part to Birman, to whose small bachelor's flat on Hanevi'im Street in Tel Aviv, they used to come to listen to recordings. This younger generation, too, appeared mainly in nightclubs like Sabra in Tel Aviv and Omar Khayyam in Jaffa, \"where there used to be South American dancing, acrobats, and a little jazz late at night,\" recounts Kaminsky.\n\n\"The audience was a Damon Runyonesque combination of artists and gangsters of that period, and Ricky was the most Damon Runyonesque of all. He would arrive toward closing, generally with a woman on each arm, and ask to go up and play.\" The other musicians weren't always eager. \"Ricky was a compulsive note-writer,\" says Kaminsky, \"and sometimes I'd find notes he'd written to me, saying things like: `I was at such-and-such a club on such-and-such a night, and I was very surprised that you didn't ask me to play.\"\n\nIn the mid-'60s, the small jazz audience finally got its own home, Sunday evenings at the Barbarim Club in Tel Aviv. Birman was an outsider then, too: \"It was uncertain whether he wrote music himself, what statement he was making exactly, what his spiritual world was,\" says Mar-Haim. Still, he never missed a jazz evening at Barbarim and evidently never forgot a single bar played on its stage.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, Birman retired from his civil service job (details of his working life are very vague; it's unclear whether he worked at the Defense Ministry or the Foreign Ministry, and what he did there exactly). From that point on, he was able to devote himself exclusively to jazz.\n\nParadoxically, his deteriorating health led him to be even more active (\"in the last few years, he just couldn't seem to stay home,\" says Gertner). Birman roamed around every night, all night long, among the Tel Aviv cafes where jazz is played, made friends with young musicians (especially female vocalists) and helped them get ahead professionally.\n\n\"I don't know when he had time to sleep,\" says Gertner.\n\nOne of the musicians who benefited from Birman's advice and friendship was Mel Rosenberg. Rosenberg is not a young man (he's a professor of microbiology), but he began playing and appearing only a few years ago.\n\n\"A year and a half ago, Rick came to a performance of my ensemble at Ramat Hahayal,\" he relates. \"Knowing he was there in the audience, I got nervous and played badly.\n\n\"At the break, he came and introduced himself, and I felt like a singer introduced to Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n\"From that evening on, he used to play with us, help us publicize ourselves, find us new places to play, and of course writing notes: `Don't make so much of me when I get up on stage to play!' or `The beginning vocalist you appeared with today, please give her at least NIS 100. If not, I will.'\n\n\"This past year, his health was really terrible. He could hardly walk, which didn't stop him from coming to life when he sat down at the piano.\n\n\"Six months ago, we did a fund-raiser to collect money for his heart surgery, but we only got NIS 7,000 and we needed $5,000 or $7,000.\n\n\"The last time I talked with him was on the day he died. It was so typically Ricky: He wanted me to come with him the next day to hear some big band at the Cinematheque.\""
