        "text": "Post by Nonfatman on\n\nIt's time to revive the Flutist of the Week feature here on The Jethro Tull Board! But first a little background information before I introduce this week's flutist, Avi Piamenta. This story is a bit long, but there is a Jethro Tull connection, so bear with me!\n\nIn college I had a friend Neil who I have previously mentioned in one of my stories here on the Board. When I first met him, freshman year, he lived in the dorm room next to mine. He was a studious intellectual type, but loved Elvis Costello, and we frequently tried to drown each other's music out, him by blasting Elvis, and me by doing the same with Tull, and we would mock each other's respective hereos.\n\nIn the ensuing four years, Neil went through numerous incarnations, the first of which was becoming a massive bodybuilder, I mean he really got to be huge. He kept that up for a couple of years, but abandoned it during senior year when his mother passed away, which seemed to set him adrift, and he turned to marijuana and became a Deadhead.\n\nToward the end of college and in the year or two afterward, though, he started spending time with two other friends of \"our group\" and all three of these guys found religion and became very observant Orthodox Jews.\n\nIn 1990, or thereabouts, Neil, who by then was known by his Hebrew name, Nessanel, got married in an Orthodox wedding in Munsey, New York. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, he promised that he would have a great surprise for me at the reception that followed the wedding ceremony, but wouldn't say what it was.\n\nSo when the wedding arrived, I was looking forward to this fantastic surprise, and I soon found out what it was. He and his bride had hired a band I had never heard of before, The Piamenta Band, named after two brothers who were musicians who had only recently been discovered in Israel by the legendary jazz saxophonist, Stan Getz. Yossi Piamenta, who later became nicknamed \"The Jewish Hendrix\" played electric guitar, and Avi Piamenta played flute. They played traditional Jewish music, but in a heavy flute-rock style.\n\nNow most of what they performed that day was exactly that, hard rock traditional Jewish songs, many in Hebrew, but Neil had them play three or four Jethro Tull covers in my honor! Teacher and Bouree were two of them, plus I believe Nothing is Easy and one other. Although they were much younger and cooler back then -- I remember them dressed in jeans and headbands at the wedding, looking like they had smoked some weed beforehand -- here is a more photo of the two Piamenta brothers in more traditional garb:\n\nSince 1990, the Piamenta Brothers have continued to perform in the New York area at weddings and functions, but Yossi Piamenta also formed \"The Heavenly Jams Band\" which is an Allman Brothers-inspired rock band which includes at least one (and I think maybe two or more) former members of the Allmans!\n\nHere is the Wikipedia entry:\n\n\"Yosi Piamenta is an Orthodox Jewish electric guitar player, often called the Hasidic Hendrix.\n\nAs a young secular Israeli prog-rock electric guitar player, he was brought to the United States by saxophone legend Stan Getz. Both he and his brother [1] Avi Piamenta (flautist, composer) became Baal teshuvas (returning to Orthodox Jewish observance) and have affiliated with the Chabad Lubavitch movement in particular.[citation needed]\n\nThe Piamenta Band known in music circles as forever changing the face of popular religious Jewish music, injecting a wildly frenetic improvisational style of Oriental based spiritual music, to a scene usually associated with the traditional Klezmer sounds of Eastern European Jewery.\n\nThe Piamenta band has produced a steady stream of compact disc recordings popular with many Jews all over the world. The band remains in demand as star performers for Jewish weddings and Bar/Bat Mitzvah.\n\nPiamenta occasionally uses existing popular songs as the melody for their Jewish-themed lyrics. For example, Piamenta's Asher Bara uses the melody of Men at Work's Down Under, and Piamenta's Kol Hamesameach uses the melody of Tarkan's Þýmarýk.\n\nContents\n\n1 Heavenly Jams Band\n\n2 Discography\n\n2.1 Piamenta Band\n\n2.2 Heavenly Jams Band\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nHeavenly Jams Band\n\nIn June 2004 Yosi and Oteil Burbridge, of the storied American rock icons The Allman Brothers Band, came together in NYC for a loose jam billed as the Heavenly Jams Band. A recording of the show was released as Live in NYC 6/16/04.\n\nThe Heavenly Jam Band became a way of exposing new audiences to broad spectrums of music through like minded musicians sharing a passion for musical improvisation and exploration. HJB shows rely heavily on the Oriental based Hebrew and Arabic Piamenta sound, blended with an assortment of classic rock, blues, and jazz influenced music.\n\nHJB lineups have included, Kofi Burbridge, Mike Mattison, Yonrico Scott, and Todd Smallie of the amazing Derek Trucks Band, Kenwwod Dennard, Tal Wilkenfeld, Pedro Arevalo, Barry Richman, David Stoltz, Matisyahu, DJ Logic, Mark Dann, Asaf Shor, Shai Bachar, Devon Allman, Jon Madof, and many other talented and renowned musicians.\"\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Piamenta\n\nAnd here is The Piamenta Band website, for anyone who may be interested:\n\nwww.piamenta.com/\n\nAnd now, on to the videos.....\n\nJeff"
