        "text": "Israeli musicians Yossi and Avi Piamenta formed the Piamenta Band after playing for soldiers during the Yom Kippur War. At the urging of the jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, the Piamenta Band came to American in 1976 and, for the past 33 years, Yossi Piamenta has been a fixture on the live music scene. Described as the Hassidic Hendrix, the guitarist has played with everyone from Matisyahu to the Disco Biscuits Jon Gutwillig and Marc Brownsteinclocking in an appearance at the official Jammys post-party along the way in 2004.\n\nBut, this summer the guitarist will relocate home to Israel. A number of musicians will help send him off on July 5 at New Yorks Highline Ballroom. Billed as A Farewell Party For Yossi Piamenta, the gig is expected to feature appearances by a number of area-musicians."
