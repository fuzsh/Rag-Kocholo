You may be surprised to find this Sh’ma insert in the Forward. In surprise, we hope you will find possibility. What you hold in your hand is a link between Sh’ma’s…\n\nHalf Meritorious and Half Culpable: A Sh’ma Infographic\n\nEvery person must view himself all year long as though he is half meritorious and half culpable, and also the entire world is half meritorious and half culpable.

But if…\n\nConsider and Converse: A Sh’ma Guide for the High Holidays\n\nSh’ma curates conversations on a single theme rooted in Jewish tradition and the contemporary moment. At the heart of this issue of Sh’ma is the theme of possibility.

Enter Tuvia Tatik, dean…\n\nWhy the Blood Libel Won’t Die\n\nIn “The Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe,” Emily Rose, a historian who has taught at Johns Hopkins, Princeton and Baruch, among other universities, explores long-standing false accusations that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in ritual ceremonies. From the Middle Ages to the present,…\n\nSpeaking Yiddish in Gaza\n\nThe last time I was in Israel was at the time of one more war in Gaza. People looked anxiously at the sky, scared of the falling debris of Hamas’s mortars. Those who lived closer to the border with Gaza took their deck chairs out to the hills and rooftops every evening. While drinking beer…\n\nA Miserable Marriage Made Worse by Rabbinic Court That Ended It\n\nI just became a wusband, 36 years of marriage to a Jewess left behind. L. and I called it quits after endless struggles. This was a marriage made in hell, and canceled in a place equally miserable — a beit din, a Jewish religious court. Though she teaches at a Modern Orthodox day school, L….\n\nWalking the Cobblestones of My Great-Grandparents’ Berlin\n\nI am 35 years old, but until recently, all I knew about my great-grandparents, Carl and Paula Brenner, was one vague, frightening sentence: They lived in Berlin and tried to escape the Nazis but were murdered in the camps. I grew up in Israel, and relocated to the German capital one year ago. Since becoming…\n\nMusic\n\nShe’s Got License to Shill\n\n(JTA) — You may have never heard of singer-songwriter , but chances are you’ve heard her music.
