Yossi Piamenta Dead at age 64

Replied to Orthodox Rocker Yosi Piamenta Dies at 64 (Tablet)

Yossi Piamenta’s music was what I listened to when I first started to move out of more traditional Jewish music into more recent compositions. There is little I can do to honor his memory…save pull out my collection and listen.
