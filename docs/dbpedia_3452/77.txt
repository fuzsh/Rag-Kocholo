Yosi Piamenta with Andrew Black on stage at Club 99, Decatur, GA - 2007/11/01

Yosi Piamenta is without a doubt the best bearded guitar player to walk the streets of Brooklyn. Born in Israel he came to the USA 30 years agoa fter being discovered by jazz cat Stan Getz. He is a major star in the world of religious Jewish music and has been playing on and off with his Heavenly Jams Band since 2004.

The out-of-this wold collaborators read like a 101 of American jam band and Jewish music regulars and one his latest album he is joined by Yonrico Scott, Kofi Burbridge, Todd Smallie, Shai Bachar and Kenwood Dennard. Culled from shows at Club 99 in Decatur, GA (2007/01/11) and Mexicali Blues in Teaneck, NJ (2007/08/09)Bridging the Gap... Live! does live up to its title - a tasty mixture of jazz, rock and Judeo-Arabic Oriental scales. Improvisation rules on all six lengthy tracks, four of them written by Yosi Piamenta, one by Deadric Malone, and a 11st Century piece by Rabbi Abrahma Ibn Ezra (Agadelcha) that is transported with ease a thousand years to wrap up an album that for lack of better world might be filed as "world music".

Bridging the Gap... Live! is released on Ditza Records. Buy it form CD Baby or Leeway's Home Grown Music Network.
