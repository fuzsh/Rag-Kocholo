I didn't do it on purpose; I just ended up writing and recording a bunch of songs that look at war from different angles. It made for an interesting departure from the previous albums which were relatively more commercially successful. This record definitely has it's loyalists—fanatics, even—and has brought an element of military men and women to my audience, which I think is awesome. It was produced by Harry Stinson, who also produced Five Dollar Bill, Hair In My Eyes Like A Highland Steer, and Losin’ Lately Gambler.\"\n\nI Wanna Be in the Cavalry\n\nHorse Soldier, Horse Soldier\n\nLament for Lester Cousins\n\nBrother Brigham, Brother Young\n\nThe Horse I Rode in On\n\nA Leader on Losing Control\n\nStudent Visas\n\nWhat That Song Means Now\n\nHard on Equipment (Tool for the Job)\n\nFamily Reunion\n\nEspecially a Paint\n\nCiesla's Revenge (Intro)"
