When the Islands were discovered by Columbus and the earliest navigators that followed, it was sup posed that they had arrived at the Eastern shore of the Continent tif India, and hence the people they found there were called Indians. In a very voluminous history of the North American Indi^ftSj by Samuel G. Drake, which, since its first issue in 1841, ilm passed through eleven editions, he remarks: \"It has been itlw practice of almost every writer who has written about the ;{j?tii.tive inhabitants of a country, to give some wild theories :of -otliers concerning their origin, and to close the account with j&js own, which, generally, has been more visionary, if possible, than those of his predecessors. Long, laborious, and, as we may add, useless disquisitions have been daily laid before the world, from the discovery of America by Columbus to the present time, to endeavor to explain by what means the inhabitants got from the Old to the New World. To act, therefore, in unison with\n\n10\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nmany of our predecessors, we will begin as far back as they have\n\ndone, and so shall commence with Theopompus, and others, from\n\nintimations in whose writings it is alleged the Ancients had\n\nknowledge of America and therefore peopled it.' ' . ...,,\n\n\" Strabo said that Theppompus, a learned historian and orator,\n\nwho flourished in the time of Alexander the Great, wrote a\n\nbook giving a dialogue between Midas and Silenas, in which\n\nSilenas said that Europe, Asia and Africa were but islands sur\n\nrounded on all sides by the sea; but that there was a continent\n\nsituated; beyond these which was of immense dimensions, even\n\nwithout limits; and that it was so luxuriant as to produce, ani\n\nmals of prodjgiotjs size, and men grew to double the height of\n\nifeemselves, and that they lived to a far greater age; that they\n\nhad niany great cities, and their usages and laws vwere different\n\nfrom s; tte: : HJ::6ne : <iity there was .more than: a. million <3f\n\ninhabitants, that gold and silver were there in vast quantities.\n\nThis country was west of Europe and Africa.\n\n\"' Hanno flourished when the Carthagenians were in their\n\ngreatest prosperity, a hundred years before the founding of Rome,\n\nabout eight hundred years before the Christian era ; having ex\n\nplored the coasts of Africa, he set out for the Pillars of Hercules,\n\nnow called the Straits of Gibraltar, and sailed westward thirty\n\ndays. Hence it is inferred by many he must have visited Ameri\n\nca, or some of its islands. Many, and not without tolerably\n\ngood reason, believe that an island or continent existed in the\n\nAtlantic Ocean about this period, but which disappeared after\n\nwards. \"' '. ' '\" ' ' - .. ' \" '\n\n':\n\n: ''. '-\n\n\" Diodorus Siculus, who.lived one hundred years B, C., says that some ' Phojnicmns were cast upon a most fertile island op posite to Africa.' Of this, they kept the most studied secrecy, which'was doubtless occasioned by their jealousy of the advan tage the discovery might be to the neighboring nations, and whicfe they wished to secure wholly to themselves. After hav ing passed the islands which lie beyond the Herculean Straits, they spoke of those which lie much: further in the ocean; to wards Africa and the west of it, is an immense island in the\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n11\n\nsea, many days sail from Lybia. Its soil is very fertile,\n\niiits surface variegated with mountains and valleys. Its coasts\n\nidentified with many navigable rivers, and its fields are well\n\nhaving delicious gardens, and various kinds of .plant s\n\nIt is the finest country known ; the inhabitants have\n\ndwellings and everything in the greatest plenty.\" To\n\nJttj. least of this account, it corresponds very well with that\n\n: iby the Mexicans when first known to the Spaniards.\n\njj^tfe lived four hundred years B. C. He says ; ' In those first\n\nAtlantic was a broad island, and there were extant\n\nkings in it, who, with joint forces, appointed to\n\nAsia and Europe, and so a most grievous war was carried\n\nwhich the Athenians, with the common consent of the\n\n^ Opposed themselves, and they became the conquerors.\n\n; Atlantic island, by a flood and earthquake, was indeed\n\n||(|ietliy destroyed f and so that warlike people were swallowed\n\nils'iiiiiJie adds in another place, 'an island in the mouth of the\n\nlegj:H5f!:tiie; passage of those Straits, called the Pillars of Hercules,\n\nnd that island was greater and larger than Lybia and\n\nwhich there was an easy passage over to other islands,\n\nthese islands to that continent which is situated out of\n\nregion.\n\n. -'\n\niil^toAfc, or the author of a book that is attributed to him,\n\n;an; island beyond the Straits of Gibraltar as follows:\n\n: say that beyond the Pillars of Hercules, the Carthagenians\n\n:|0i?n<i a very fertile island without inhabitants, full of\n\nrivers, and fruit in abundance.

D., 1492. In the early part of the following century, Brazil was discovered and taken possession of by the Portugese, and Mex ico and Peru were taken for the Spaniards by Cortez and Pizarro. As the North and South American countries were being popu lated and subjugated by the Spanish, French and English, con stant intercourse was kept up between the old and new countries, the former, became familiar with the character, habits and phy sical appearance of the American Indians, who were so different from any class of people on the globe. The subject of their origin was agitated by all of the enlightened nations in the Sixteenth Century, and has been discussed by the most learned scientists to the present time, without any satisfactory solution. It was claimed by many writers that the Indian was not a descend ant of Adam's race, because he could not have crossed the ocean to reach America ; the tribes were so populous when their country was discovered by the whites that they must have ex isted for many centuries before the compass was applied to navi gation ; again after the increase of their race they would cer tainly have made known to the world the results of their discov eries through the same mode of conveyance that brought them over the sea ; they were not only unable to give any account of their origin but were bewildered at the very appearance of a white man.\n\nOn the other hand, the Christian and the Jew have proclaimed that the race of people found in America descended, like them selves, from Adam ; that, they assume as an infallible certainty, for any other theory would be, according to their religion, in opposition to the verity of the Holy Scriptures. Hence a vast\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\nIS\n\nnumber of volumes have been written by the most eminent and honest authors to prove that there existed a pre-historic race in America, who came from the old countries, and that the Indians were their descendants; and they have devised various plausible methods by which they were transported hither. Prominent among these authors was Mr. Adair, who resided thirty to forty years among the Southern Indians, previous to 1775, and who published a large book upon their history, origin, etc. He finds in their usages, customs, and some words in their language, a similarity to the Hebrews. Other authors follow him and assume that the long lost ten tribes of Israel are identified with the American Indians.\n\nThough near four centuries have elapsed since the Red-man was first known to the civilized world, his origin is still uncer tain. The popular opinion of the unbiased mind is, that the Creator, who made the universe and holds it in \" the hollow of his hand,\" could make a race of people on the Western as well as the Eastern Hemisphere; and that neither Moses nor any of his priests or scribes, with all the \" learning of the Egyptians,\" had the most remote conception of the extent of the world. Having no desire to participate in the discussion, the humble writer will summarily dismiss the subject, leaving it in charge of the various historiologists, biologists, and physiological natu\n\nralists. During the Sixteenth Century, all of the territory in the South\n\nern portion of the Continent lying between Massachusetts and Mexico, was not known by any other name than that of Florida.\n\nIn 1512, John Ponce de Leon, a Spanish soldier, who had once voyaged with Columbus, had received the impression com mon to those times, that there was a country in the newly dis covered world containing a fountain whose waters had power to arrest disease and produce immortal youth. The venerable Ponce set forth to seek it and to obtain by conquest a kingdom. On Easter Sunday, called by the Spaniards Pascua Florida, and a little north of the latitude of St. Augustine, he beheld, what he considered, the coveted land of flowers, so profusive were\n\n14\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nthe plants and numerous were the forest trees. The fountain of life was not there, but he took possession of the land in the name of Spain and called it Florida. He soon after returned to Spain to report' his adventures, and it was not until nine years had elapsed that he was enabled, with a small expedition, to return to Florida. He gave the Indians battle, was overwhelmed and wounded, and died while endeavoring to escape.\n\nIn 1528, Paufilo de Narvaez had attempted to overcome Florida with an expedition of three hundred men, mostly moun ted cavaliers. He was at first civilly received by the natives, but by his cruel treatment to them, he, in return, was overpow ered, any many of his men wasted away; the remainder em barked for Cuba in rudely constructed boats which were swal lowed up : by the waves. Among the prisoners captured by the Indians was a young: man, Jean Otez, who came to Florida with some others in search of gold. He was about to be burnt to death, when he was fortunately saved through the entreaties of the beautiful daughter of Uceta, the chief--a coincident with:the subsequent similar escape of Captain John Smith, in Virginia, by the interposition of Pocahontas. In the earlier days of his captivity, Ortez was compelled to guard> night and day, a lonely temple in which the dead were deposited. After remaining a prisoner twelve years, he made his unexpected arid wonderful escape which will be referred to in its order.\n\nThe first discovery of the present Georgia was made by Hernando DeSoto, a native of Spain, a commander of renown in the West -Indies and Nicaragua, and one of the first that went with Francis Pizarro, upon the conquest of Peru, and by whom, from his worth and valor, he was appointed Lieutenant General. Having:no property but his sword, DeSoto won high military distinction and acquired a : vast amount of wealth in Peru, Re turning to his native country, he found the wildest Stages pre vailing about.the: wealth of Florida in minerals and floors,: It had been represented to be the finest country in the world. Numerous applications were make to the King of Spain for an expedition to sail in conquest of Florida.

His cav-\n\ntwo hundred and thirteen horses, were the\n\n16\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nmost gallant and graceful men of all Spain. Greyhounds, of wonderful fleetness, and bloodhounds of largest size and ferocity were taken along to turn loose upon the savages; also handcuffs, chains and neck collars, to secure the: prisoners,,. \"Workmen, of every trade, with various tools, men of science, with appliances for refining gold were in attendance; also merchandise, tons of iron and steel, and provisions to last for two years, and three hundred live hogs were taken along. There were twelve priests with their robes, holy relics and sacramental bread and wine, connected with the expedition. After building the first fort at Havana, he sailed from that place on the izth of May, 1539, and arrived on the last day of that month at Espiritu Santo, subsequently known as Tampa Bay. On the following day he had a skirmish with the Indians and defeated them. All of the forces landed and marched two leagues to an Indian town, where the cazique had fled to another town, where a message was sent by forty horsemen from DeSoto. They were met by a party of Indians, among whom was their captive, Jean Ortez. The In dians, who never before saw a horse, imagined that the horse and rider was one animal, and quickly dispersed. Ortez recog nized his countrymen, though he was attired like an Indian and having been among them so long he had almost forgotten his na tive language. The spear of a Spaniard was lifted at him, when he made the sign of Roman cross and exclaimed, \". I am a Chris tian ! I am a Christian ! slay me not.\" Alvaro Nieto, the cav alier who was about to hurl his lance at Ortez, recognized that he was a Spaniard, dropped his lance and lifting the stranger upon his horse, took him to DeSoto, who was highly gratified at his rescue from a captivity of twelve years. DeSoto gave him clothes, arras and a fine charger; and as he had become familiar with the Indian language, made him his interpreter. After tra versing the surrounding country for many miles, having numer ous conflicts with the natives, the Adelantado cut his way to Apalache, in the neighborhood of where Tallahassee now stands. Here was a fertile country, abounding in fruits, corn, etc. The adventurers camped at this place for the winter, sending out ex-\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n17\n\nin search of gold, but no trace of metal was found. ||iea:ming from two Indian slaves that a country to the Northf:|a5t, :about fourteen days journey, abounded in gold, silver and ::p;g,f:k, and afterwards hearing confirmation of the pleasing reaOrt by others, DeSoto concluded to march his army in search ijjjijijpitJMj place.

On-the seventh day both Spaniards\n\n18\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nand Indians became confused, as the great road was at an end,\n\nso that they did not know which trail to continue. Four ex\n\nploring parties were sent out in different directions to return in\n\nfive days and report their discoveries.\n\nBefore crossing the rivers a singular incident occurred : Two\n\nfavorite Indians who had been with the Spaniards along time,\n\nand had become familiar with their customs, were called by\n\nthem, the one Mark, and the other Peter. They cried out one\n\nnight that Peter was in danger of being killed. All of the forces\n\nwere immediately at arms, and found Peter quaking, who said\n\nthat \"the devil, attended by many of his companions, had threat\n\nened to kill him ia case he conducted the Spaniards, as he had\n\nipromised, to the Jandof gold; that they had dragged and beaten\n\nhim so unmercifully, had they not come to his assistance lie\n\nwould base: Killed; hiTny and : :sioce \\ the great devil hatl: fled' from\n\n.two Christians,1 ; he ;dtired that: they would baptize him, that he\n\nmight be a Christian as well as they.\" By the bruises and\n\nswelling on Peter's body, his story appeared to be no fiction,\n\nwhereupon the Adelantado\" delivered him to the priests, who\n\nnursed him all night and baptized him with water from theriver\n\nthe following day ; and we may with safety say that, from the\n\nhigh authority from which we trace the record of his march,\n\nAdelantado DeSoto was the discoverer Of the Ocmulgee river;\n\nthat he Journeyed with Ms army of Spaniards along its western\n\nbank ten days; and that the first ordinance of baptism recorded\n\nin; the :New World, was administered in its crystal waters in the\n\nmonth of March, 1540, at the; feet ef those meriiorabletelKS of\n\nantiquity^ the Indian mounds that majestically overlook the\n\npresent city of Macoh. : : : :\n\n\"'. ;\n\n'''\"\n\nThe province df :th fcazique Cofaqui extended to the Oconee river.

He answered: \"That no man\n\nhad ever been there, and that their wars had never\n\nwith complete armies, but that they killed and\n\ntolother prisoners whensoever they happened to meet\n\non the rivers, or in hunting; wherein those of\n\nhaving proved most successful, his countrymen did\n\nwas the reason of their being in the country.\"\n\nthe:, exploring parties having been out six days, re-\n\nto report the discovery of a town seated on the\n\n:<>f the great river to which DeSoto had advanced and\n\nfbfi tewn was reported small, but. contained stores of\n\ni arsd that higher up stillthere were several towns, and\n\n:aowed.

He had been at enmity with the Indians in the domain of Queen Cofachiqni. His proffer to DeSoto of his thousands of warriors to accompany him thither, was a cunningly devised plan to make war upon that people, who, when they beheld the horsemen, would regard the \" horse and rider as the same animal,\" and the infantry as men \" with fire in their hands,\" would surrender from terror.\n\nDeSoto continued his march three days up the broad river, and was perplexed as to the means he should devise to cross it, when the two Christian Indians, Mark and Peter, discovered at night, from the barking of dogs and lights from houses, that there was a town on the opposite side of the river. The next morning DeSoto advanced with one hundred horsemen and as many on foot, to the shore to view the town, when the Indians on the opposite side fled at the sight of the Spaniards. Finally six of them crossed in a canoe, and according to custom, the Adelantado was seated in a chair to receive them with state. The six Indians approached, bowed first to the Sun, then to the Moon and next to the Adelantado, and said : \" Sir, are you for peace or for war?\" He bid the interpreter tell them, \"he was for peace, and required nothing but provisions, and desired they would excuse him in asking for them.\" They replied that \" they accepted peace, but were concerned about provisions, as they were scarce, there having been a plague, that they were subjects of a maiden queen, to whom they would return and report. Soon as the message was delivered to her, two large canoes were covered with awnings and decked with choicest feathers, etc., in which the Queen glided over the water with many attendants. On reaching the camp of the Adelantado, she sat upon a stool that had been brought for her, and after some compliments, said : \" While she was sorry for the scarcity of provisions in the\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\ncountry, she had two store houses for the relief of the needy, one of which she gave them and desired they would leave her the other; that she had two thousand bushels of maize in another town which she would also give them, and would quit her own house and half of the town to quarter the men in, if they needed it.\" The Adelantado replied in a most courteous manner, re turning thanks, saying he would be satisfied with what she would be pleased to give him. While he was speaking she took a string of pearls from her neck and delivered it to the interpreter, John Ortez, to hand to the Adelantado, saying the transgression against modesty forbid the presentation from her own hand. The handsome Adelantado stood erect, received it with appro priate respect, and presented her with a ruby he wore on his fin ger. Thus the peace was ratified ; the young Queen Cofachiqui, whose country was the goal DeSoto so long sought, went away, the Spaniards admiring her youth and beauty, grace and accom plishments.\n\nThe Spaniards crossed the Savannah river in canoes and floats and quartered in the middle of the town. They found the country was extraordinarily fruitful. Exploring parties with en gineers and miners were sent out in search of the precious metals. \" They found much copper, some of a golden color, and great plates of ore, bright like silver, but mouldered like the earth.\" The golden colored metal was pyrites, and the other was mica. A vast quantity of pearls were found. The pearl bearing mus sels were abundant in the river; the Indians were unfamiliar with their value. The Queen gave the Spaniards leave to go to a house held as sacred, being the burial place of the nobility, and to the temple, which was the burying place of her forefathers, in another town, both containing immense quantities of pearls which were at their disposal. There were found chests laid by in the temple, in which were the bodies of the dead. In baskets made of reeds there were an abundance of large and seed pearls, also garments made of furs and skins, for men and women. The officers measured out five hundred weight of pearls. The Ade lantado ordered that the forces should not be encumbered with\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nloads and that only half a hundred weight of pearls should be taken which should be sent to Havana, to test their quality and value. Proceeding to another town they found a similar temple containing large strings of beads and quantities of pearls, furs, etc.; and in the charnel rooms there were a great number of pikes with copper heads, that resembled gold, and axes of the same metal, clubs, staves, bows, arrows, targets and breast-plates.\n\nIt was discovered that the queen mother, a widow, lived re tired, in a town twelve leagues distant, and had been sent for by her daughter to come and see the pale faces, and that she declined, reprimanding the queen for remaining among such strangers. At the request of the queen two more escorts were sent for the mother, who said she would not come. The escort visited a similar temple, as described, in her town with the same character of contents. DeSoto and his lordly army of Castilians, though highly pleased with the prosperity of the surround ing natives and their hospitable treatment, were sorely disap pointed in not finding the country abounding in the precious metals. After remaining in the province of the maiden Indian queen near three weeks, they began to make preparations for continuing their search for mines of gold in another direction.\n\nMr. Bartrum, a celebrated English botanist, visited Georgia, Alabama and Florida in 1744, on a tour of investigation, for sev eral years. He published, in London, a large volume of his travels which has passed several editions. On his visit through Carolina he refers to a place called \" Silver Bluff \" as being very celebrated, and says, \" It is of considerable height upon the Carolina shore of the Savannah river ; its steep banks discover various strata of earth ; the surface,, for a considerable depth, is a loose sandy loam with a mixture of sea shells.\" After describ ing the various stratas, he found among them \"pyrites and sul phurous nodules, shining like brass, lying in this flaky-like, mi caceous earth ; also sticks, acorns with their cups, limbs and trunks of trees, all transmuted or charred black, hard and shin ing as charcoal ; also animal substances petrified, and that the surface of the gruond upon this bluff extends a mile and half or\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n23\n\ntwo miles on the river, and a mile in breadth with good soil, which is evident from the fine trees and shrubs in the old fields spreading abroad to a great distance. There are also vestiges and monuments of the residence of the ancients, as Indian mounds, terraces, etc., as well as remains or traces of fortresses, which are supposed to be the camps of the Spaniards in search of silver.\"\n\nIn 1736 George Galphin established himself at this point as an Indian trader, and gave the old site of Cofachiqui the name of Silver Bluff. All Indian traditions locates the old site. The most ancient Indian informed Galphin that this was the place where DeSoto found the Indian queen. Galphin was an influ ential man in Georgia and Alabama. The wife of Governor Milledge was his daughter. The bluff is situated in Barnwell Dis trict, South Carolina, near Augusta, and was the property of Governor Hammond. The father of Governor Hammond was one of the earliest school-teachers in Macon, Georgia, where he died, and was buried in the old cemetery in that city.\n\nOn the 3d of May, 1540, DeSoto, the discoverer also of the Savannah river, and South Carolina, broke up his camp at Sil ver Bluff. The atrocious requital he made to the beautiful young Indian queen for her generous treatment to him and his com mand, was to make her a prisoner and retain her person as a hostage to ensure obedience among her subjects.\n\nThe army marched up the Savannah river, passing several Indian towns where they found the usual temples containing pearls and othes relics, until they reached a town in the present Habersham county, Georgia. From this place they marched in a Western course, tarrying in several towns on their route; being met by their caziques, with one thousand warriors wearing plumes and rich mantles of furs, by whom they were conducted to a town on the present Oostanaula which contained five hundred houses. The house of the cazique was situated upon a mound, and was surrounded by a terrace wide enough for six men to promenade abreast. The house and the town was tendered to the strangers for lodging during their visit, and was accepted. After march-\n\n24\n\nHisTOkicAi, RECORD OF MACON\n\ning through their towns where they were well received, they halted at Chiaha, the present site of Rome, Georgia. During the march to this place the noble young captive queen made her escape, doubtless with intense disgust at the perfidy of the pale faces. Two negro slaves and a Barbary moor accompanied Her in her flight; they were concealed by the natives who rejoiced to have anything remain around them that belonged to the white man.\n\nDeSoto kept his engineers prospecting for gold during his journey. They reported finding immense quantities of pyrites and copper, though but little silver or gold. Notwithstanding DeSoto had explored the richest portion of the auriferous re gions of Georgia, his disappointment in discovering so little .gold was that he expected to find it: in large quantities and on the surface, and in deposits, as it was then, and : for a very long period afterwards, found in Spain, Peru arid Mexico. The American gold is found in veins of quartz, deep in the earth. The Virginia mines, in Colorado, are worked three thousand feet below the earth's surface, and their yield is greater than any mine in America, and probably in the world.\n\nIn Mr, Pickett's excellent history of DeSoto's march through Alabama, Georgia, etc., he quotes largely from the standard authorities of Spain, who wrote their narative from the records of officers and surviving priests, and others, on their return from the disastrous expedition of DeSoto.\n\nMr, Pickett quotes.;, \" On the arrival of DeSoto a| .Chiaha, the; noble young Chief of: the town received him with unaffected joy, and made the following addresS :\n\n\"Mighty Chief:,.Nothing could have made me so happy as to be the means of serving you and your warriors. You sent me word from Guaxule to have corn collected to last your army two months. Here I havs twenty barns : full of the best which the country can afford. If I have not met your wishes, respect my tender years, and: receive my good:: will to do for: you what ever I am able.\"\n\nThe Adelaiitado responded in a kind manner, and .was then\n\nCENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\no the Chief's own house, which was prepared for n. Chiaha contained a great quantity of\n\nin gourds, and walnut oil clear as butter, and equally ')' and for the only time in the entire route were seen Of the honey Mr, Ekkett says j . ' ' I have often by bee hunters and Indian countrymen, that\n\nit&e : territory of Alabama became partially settled by an on, wild bees were much more abundant than\n\ntheir earliest recollection^ They were introduced orn. Georgia and Carolina, and after escaping\n\n:;hvves to the woods, became wild-- hence DeSoto honey at the early period in which he invaded itj ex-\n\nportion of Georgia has ever excelled in f :feees, and in the quantity and superiority of honey.\n\n: ' State Fair the premiums are awarded for the in the vicinity of Rome, Georgia. ^ Spaniards rested in the romantic and delightful spot where iiflourishing town of Rome, for thirty days. .

He said the |iii|j||j:;'jcjf;:|hsg : t<jwn, where the remains of his ancestors were de-\n\nQuantities of pearls, etc. \"The Chief, to : taantter of collecting these pearls, sent some of his ss>aa:io .fish all Bight for the oysters which contained\n\nfire :made upon the bank of the Coosa, i returned laden, the oysters were thrown :: coals; they succeeded in finding many pearls\n\nDeSoto pronounced beautiful, but for the ::|*ad: fobbed them of some of their brilliancy.

He declined the kindness intended his wife, and urged the generous fellow to keep it to buy horses with at Havana. Connoisseurs in camp valued it at four hundred ducats.\"\n\nThe oysters mentioned, was undoubtedly the mussel commonly known as the unio, a pearl-bearing mussel. The writer has seen vast quantities of them along the rivers in Georgia and Ala bama, particularly in the regions of the old Indian haunts, and below Macon, in the cotton fields contiguous to the Ocmulgee; many of these shells have been turned up in the plow furrows. Mr. Pickett says : \" But as thousands of the shells lie banked up, some deep in the ground, we may also suppose that the In dians, in DeSoto's time, everywhere in Alabama, obtained pearls from them. There can be no doubt about the pearls found in the State of Georgia in 1540, but they were of a coarser and less valuable kind than the Spaniards supposed. The In dians used to perforate them with a copper spindle and string them around their necks like beads ; others made toy babies and birds of them. Old warriors have informed me that their an cestors used the shells to temper the clay with which they made their vessels.\"\n\nBefore breaking up camp in the picturesque and delightful country surrounding the confluence of the Etowah and Oostanaula Rivers, DeSoto, at the solicitation of some of his unprinci pled officers, demanded of the noble young Chief a number of Indian girls to accompany them in their explorations to the West. Upon which demand all of the inhabitants, on the night following, quietly left the town and secreted themselves on the mountains. Summoning the horsemen, DeSoto scoured the country, and, provoked at not finding the fugitives, destroyed their flourishing fields of corn. Learning afterwards that men only would be required for the purpose of bearing the baggage of the Spaniards, the fugitives returned. It had been the custom of DeSoto to capture Indians and impose the servile labor of bearing upon their backs the burdens of the army.\n\nAbout the last of June the Spaniards marched down the west\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n27\n\nside of the Coosa, leaving the hospitable Indians of Chiaha many presents, and entered the lands of the present State of Alabama, in the county of Chefokee. Of their arrival Pickett says: \" Never before had our natives beheld white faces, long beards, strange apparel, glittering armor, and stranger than all, the singular animals bestrode, by the dashing cavaliers.\" Here DeSoto received the same hospitalities from the chiefs and their subjects that had been extended to him since his march from Apalache in Florida. Throughout Georgia his march was peace able and agreeable, and it would have been the same elsewhere had he not taken both chiefs and natives as hostages. He jour neyed through several Indian towns, exploring the country to the mountains, finding little gold, but the country abounding with huge rocks and lofty hills. The Chief of a mountain town presented him with a buffalo robe, which the Spaniards supposed was the skin of a tremendous animal, partaking of the qualities of the ox and the sheep. The result of the mining prospect was an abundance of the highly colored copper, such as is found in Georgia. In Alabama DeSoto met with many fortified towns and a number of mounds; \" the trail was lined with towns, vil lages and hamlets, and many sown fields which reached from one to the other.\" The climate was delightful, and as in Geor gia, abounding in fine meadows and beautiful little rivers. The numerous barns were full of corn, while acres of it were ripened on the fields. In the fields \" were plum trees, peculiar to the country, and others resembling the fruit in Spain. Wild fruit clambered to the tops of the trees, and lower branches were laden with delicious Isabella grapes.\" After meeting with a Chief dressed in a mantle of martin skins, his head adorned . xnth a diadem of brilliant feathers, and who was escorted by a thousand warriors, DeSoto accepted his invitation and visited his town ; it contained five hundred houses and was the capital of this flourishing province. The Chief offered him any place : in his extensive domain that he might select, to establish a Span ish colony. In return for this kindness, DeSoto, on leaving, seized the Chief and kept him as a hostage to extort slaves and\n\n28\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nprovisions. Some of the Indians taken here were placed in irons as slaves and made to bear the baggage of the army to the Mississippi river. The village of the Chief was the capital of Coosa. Here DeSoto left a young Christian negro slave who had taken sick, after having been with him since his departure from Cuba. The Indians made a pet of him on account of \" his peculiar hair and sable complexion.\" He recovered, and was doubtless the distant ancestor of \" dark-colored savages seen in that region in modern times.\" The march continued to Ullehabale, \" a town surrounded by a wall composed of two rows of posts driven deep in the ground, with poles laid horizontally be tween them, the inner and outer side of the frame work neatly stuccoed with clay and straw. Port holes were left at proper distance as high as a lance. Such was the character of the forti fications from this place onward. DeSoto left some hogs and cattle among the towns, and such is the origin of these animals among the Indians.\n\nOn the 18th the Spaniards passed the town of Tallassee, which was an extensive one, and well fortified. The Spaniards were next met by the son of Tuscaloosa, a potent Chief whose prov ince extended thirty miles to the Tombigby and beyond. The son bore a message from Tuscaloosa inviting DeSoto to visit his capital, where great preparations were made for his reception. Tuscaloosa was a Chief of great power : \" He was lord of many territories and much people, and was feared by his neighbors and subjects.\" He was forty years old, of gigantic stature, with a small waist and heavy limbs. He was well proportioned and very handsome. He received DeSoto with respect, and ob served his dignity. After accepting his generous hospitality two days, and the Spaniards supplying themselves freely from his store of provisions, DeSoto selected the largest and strongest horse in his army, captured the cazique, Tuscaloosa, placed him astride of the animal and bore him off as a hostage. He was more than a head taller than any of the attendants, and mount ed on the horse his feet nearly trailed the ground. But Tus caloosa was determined to be revenged. He was Chief of the\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n29\n\ntribe, and succeeded in getting messages to his subthe treachery of the Spaniards. The capture of so their Chiefs and making slaves of the captured natives, many thousands of the various tribes. DeSoto now throiigh the center of Alabama, and was the discoverer fiji::ii*J great river that bears that name. Passing through many ;S|iijt>k>us towns he found quantities of corn, beans, pumpkins Sjiiij: other provisions. ::::::::;<3a the i8th of October the Adalantado and the Chief, Tusa; entered the capital, of the Mobilians at the town of )iia. on the Alabama river, twenty-five miles above its con-\n\nthe Tombigby. \" The town was surrounded by a fti> made of immense trunks of trees set deep in the\n\nclose together, strengthened with cross-timbers and Sij^lefwoven with large vines. A thick mud plaster, resembling\n\n( masonry, concealed the wood work, together with fs: capable of containing eight men each, at the distance of\n\napart. An Eastern and Western gate opened into the contained eighty handsome houses, each capable of\n\none thousand persons. They all fronted a large public DeSoto and Tuscaloosa were ushered into this square ;:sfigs, music upon Indian flutes and the graceful dancing se Beautiful brown girls. They alighted from their chargers\n\nthemselves under a 'canopy of State.' Remaining time, Tuscaloosa requested that he should no longer 'a, hostage, nor required to follow the army any further,\n\nhesitated in his reply, which brought the Chief :|i^sHsg:|eet; who walked off with a lofty and independent bear|j:8|j:l<a;oa:e of the houses. In the meantime one of the spies of ::::|||Sot<3::tviifbrmed him there were ten thousand Indian warriors\n\ns, arid that other houses were filled with clubs, stones, :StrOws. .DeSoto was surprised and deeply solicitous,\n\nsent word to his men to be ready for an attack. Sft^ious to avert a rupture, by regaining possession of the ;)ie approached him with smiles and kind words, but lSosa. scornfully turned his back on him, and was soon lost\n\n30\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\namong the host of excited warriors.\" And now commenced a most horrible carnage. An Indian excitedly rushed from one of the houses, denounced the Spaniards as robbers and assas sins, and drew his bow at one of them, when a swordsman, with a powerful sweep of his blade, split his body and let out his entrals. The Indians now emerged from the houses and rushed upon the Spaniards. They retreated fighting face to face with DeSoto in front, until they passed the gate into the plain. A party of Indians succeeded in capturing all of the baggage and other effects of the Spaniards, which they deposited in a house in the town. They released the Indian slaves, except a few that were with the Spaniards. The remainder of the army now arrived and the battle was renewed, with awful destruction to the Indians. The cavalry and infantry charged, and drove them behind their walls. Here they showered arrows and stones upon the Spaniards with considerable effect, until the latter suc ceeded in breaking down the gates and entering the town. The Indians were driven into the large houses which were fired by the Spaniards, and four thousand men and women perished in the flames. Tuscaloosa was killed in the battle, and DeSoto severely wounded. The loss of the Indians were fifty-five hundred in killed and burnt; that of the Spaniards eighty-two in killed, and every man was wounded; the most of them re ceived several different wounds. Among their slain were all of the surgeons except one, who estimated that there were one thousand seven hundred wounds on the bodies of the survivors. All the medicines, oils, bandages and surgical implements were destroyed by the fire in the large house, where nearly all of the baggage and equipments of the army had been deposited by the Indians. The relics and robes of the priests, their flour and wine used in the sacrament, and a thousand other things which the wilderness could not supply, were burnt. Forty-five horses were also lost. The Spaniards wore their armour in the battle, which was impenetrable against the arrows of the natives.\n\nThis was the first of a long series of conflicts that DeSoto af terwards had with the Indians, after leaving Georgia.\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n31\n\nThe ships from Cuba had arrived at Pensacola with supplies, DeSoto was within a week's march of that port. He remained in camp near the battle ground until the wounded had recovered. A large number of his men were anxious to return to the ships, being reduced in health and without the actual comforts and even necessities for further service. Joy prevailed throughout the camp when the news of the arrival of the ships was con firmed. DeSoto discovered that some of his men were conspir ing to return to Spain. He became perplexed and gloomy. He knew that his means were exhausted, his pearls and all his effects had been lost by the fire, and his hopes of finding a country abounding in gold, thus far, blasted. He, therefore, determined to thwart his conspirators and changed his course to an opposite direction, turning his back upon the ships laden with provisions, clothes and other supplies.\n\nThe priests held a convention with the laymen and concluded that corn meal could not be substituted for flour, and that there was no substitute for wine in the celebration of mass. After this, in place of the chalices, altar dresses, chasubles and other sacred articles, which had been lost by the fire, the fathers made some robes of deer skins, built rustic altars, and read the prayers of the mass on Sundays, omitting the consecration. This epi sode was called \"Dry Mass.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the i8th November, 1540, the astounding order to march north, and that the first man would be put to death who attempted to return to the ships, was issued. The disap pointed cavaliers reluctantly obeyed. After many battles, ad ventures and hardships, attended with sickness and loss of life, the Spaniards, in May, 1541, reached a village called Chisca. It was located near a wide and rapid river, the largest they had discovered. This was the \" Father of Waters,\" the mighty Mississippi, and DeSoto was the first European to look upon that turbulent stream and be buried in its waters.\n\nMr. Theodore Irving, who studied all of the Spanish authori ties while at Madrid, and wrote a valuable book of the expedi tion of DeSoto in America, recalls \" a religious ceremony on\n\n32\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nthe banks of the Mississippi\" at an Indian village, as follows : \" The army remained tranquil in this village during three days, with much good feeling on both sides. On the morning of the fourth the cazique, accompanied by all his principal subjects came into the presence of DeSoto, and making a profound obeisance, ' Senor,' said he, ' as you are superior to us in prowess and surpass us in arms, we likewise believe that your God is bet ter than our God ! These you behold before you, are the chief warriors of my dominions. We supplicate you to pray to your God to send us rain, for our fields are parched for the want of water!''\n\nDeSoto replied, that although he and all his followers were but sinners, yet they would supplicate God, the Father of mer cies, to show mercy unto them. In the presence of the cazique, he ordered his chief carpenter to hew down the largest and highest pine tree in the vicinity and construct of it a cross.\n\nThey immediately felled one of such immense size that a hun dred men could not raise it from the ground. They formed of it a perfect cross, and erected it on a high hill on the banks of the river, which served the Indians as a watchtower, overlook ing every eminence in the vicinity. Everything was prepared in two days, and the Governor ordered that the next morning all should join in a solemn procession to it, except an armed squadron of horse and foot, who should be on the alert to pro tect the army.\n\nThe cazique walked beside the Governor, and many of the savage warriors mingled among the Spaniards. Before them went a choir of priests and friars, chanting the litany, while the soldiers responded. The procession, in which were more than a thousand persons, both Spaniards and Indians, wound slowly and solemnly along until it arrived before the cross, where all sank upon their knees. Two or three prayers were offered up they then arose, and two by two, approached the holy emblem, bent the knee before it, and worshipped and kissed it.\n\nOn the opposite shore of the river were collected fifteen or twenty thousand savages, of both sexes and all ages, to witness\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n33\n\nthis singular but imposing ceremony. With their arms extended and their hands raised, they watched the movements of the Spaniards. Ever and anon they raised their eyes to heaven and made signs with their faces and hands, as if asking God to listen to the Christian prayer. Then would they raise a low and wail ing cry, like people in excessive grief, echoed by the plaintive murmuring of their children's voices. DeSoto and his followers were moved to tenderness, to behold in a strange and heathen land, a savage people worshipping with such deep humility and tears, the emblem of our redemption. Observing the same order, the procession returned ; the priests chanted forth Te Deum laudamus, and with it closed the solemnity of the day.\n\nGod, in his mercy, says the Spanish Chronicler, willing to show these heathens that he listeneth unto those who call upon him in truth, sent down, in the middle of the ensuing night, a plenteous quantity of rain, to the great joy of the Indians. * *\n\nIt is a reflection replete with interest that three centuries ago the cross, the -type of our beautiful religion, was planted on the banks of the Mississippi, and its silent forests were awakened by the Christian hymn of gratitude and praise. The effect was vivid but transitory. The \" voice cried in the wilderness,\" and reached and was answered by every heart, but it died away and was forgotten, and was not to be heard again in that savage re gion for many generations. It was as if a lightning gleam had broken for a moment upon a benighted world, startling it with sudden effulgence, only to leave it in tenfold gloom. The real dawning was yet afar off from the benighted Valley of the Mis sissippi.\n\nDeSoto advanced into Arkansas, and returned the first of June, 1542, to the great river, where, sick, and exhausted in materials, clothing, etc., he commenced the construction of two brigantines to communicate with Cuba. This grand army, once composed of one thousand of the best blood of Spain, and equipped with all that wealth could command, was now reduced to three hundred and twenty men, and apparaled, like the na tives, in the skins of animals. DeSoto was taken with a violent\n\n34\n\nHISTORICA! RECORD OF MACON\n\nfever] he had met with nothing but disappointment, and his proud spirit was subdued. After appointing Moscosco to the command he bade his companions farewell, entreating them \" to keep together and return to that country which he was destined never to see, and then closed his eyes in death.\" To conceal his death from the Indians his body was placed in a trough made of a hollow oak, and on a dark night sunk into the bosom of the Mississippi, \"Long did its waters wash the bones of one of the bravest sons of Spain ! He was the first to behold that river--the first to close his eyes in death upon it--and the first to find a grave in its deep and turbid channel.\"\n\nThe Spaniards used bridle bits, saddle stirrups and every par ticle of iron that could be made into a nail, skins of Indian man tles for sails, and made several rough brigantines for their de parture down the river. Five hundred Indian slaves were left behind; one hundred were taken with them; amongst them were the beautiful girls captured at the battle of Maubila. Af ter descending the river, the remnant of the army reached the Mexican coast September ioth,.i543. The Cuban ships found them at Vera Cruz. They had been well cared for at the city of Mexico by the Viceroy and the elegant Castilian ladies of the court who were enthusiastic in admiration of the beautiful Indian girls--the original daughters of Alabama. The an nouncement of the ill-fated expedition under DeSoto cast a deep gloom over Havanna, and the fair Dona Isabel, so long dis tracted in mind over the long and unaccountable absence of her husband, became overwhelmed with grief and died with a broken heart.\n\nNOTE.--The authorities from which the foregoing narratives are written are Col.

It is also believed that the natives were in a higher state of civilization then than at any time following. The reception and introductory speeches of the chiefs, though brief, were, chaste, appropriate, unaffected, and evinced a generous sentiment. In respect to their language, they had but few words.; their wants were few, and as nature supplied them all, they had no use for words. They could, in a degree, express their ideas by signs, motions and by pointing to objects. Their illustrations were ever by natural objects ; with in a few years of two centuries afterwards, the same characteris tic will be observed in the speech made Tomichichi in offering the Indian emblems to Oglethorpe : \" Here is a little present ; I give you a buffalo skin, adorned on the inside with the head and feathers of an eagle, which I desire you to accept, because the eagle is the emblem of speed and the buffalo of strength; the English are as swift as the bird and strong as the beast; since like the former, they flew over vast seas to the uttermost parts of the earth, and like the latter, they are so strong that nothing can withstand them; the feathers of the eagle are soft and sig nify love, and are emblems of peace in our land, so we leave them with you as a token of everlasting peace. The buffalo's skin is warm and signifies protection ; therefore, I hope the English will love and protect their little families.\"\n\nThe dress of the males were of a mantle \"made of the inner bark of trees and a species of flax interwoven. It was thrown over the shoulders with the right arm exposed ; skins of deer were also used. Orie of these mantles encircled the body of the female, commencing below the breast and extending nearly to the knees, while another was gracefully thrown over the shoulders, also with the right arm exposed. Both sexes were fond of ornament, and frequently wore rich feathers, strings of beads, pearls and shining shells, and the better classes wore mpeasins extending to the knees, made of dressed deer skins; plumes of beautiful feathers adorned the heads of the warriors.\"\n\nThey had skill in some of the mechanical arts. They made axes, hatchets and arrow heads from copper. These wonderful\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n37\n\ntS: were found among them ; wonderful indeed !

The walls were high in proportion; the roof steep and covered with mats of split cane, interwoven so compactly that they resembled the rush carpeting of the Moors, (the inhabitants in this .section...all,..covered their houses with this matting.) Shells of different sizes, arranged in an ingenious manner, were placed on the outside of the roof. On the inside, beautiful plumes, shells and pearls were suspend ed in the form of festoons from one to the other down to the floor. The temple was entered at the three gates, at each of which were stationed gigantic wooden statues, presenting fierce and menacing attitudes. Some of them were armed with clubs, maces, canoe paddles, copper hatchets, and others with drawn bows and long pikes. All of these implements were ornamented with rings of pearls and beads of copper. On the side of the walls were benches on which sat boxes containing the deceased, chiefs and their families. Two feet below these were statues of the persons entombed, the space between them being made of strong wooden reeds adorned with pearls and colored tassels. Three rows of chests, full of valuable pearls, occupied the mid dle of the temple. Deer skins, of a variety of colors, were packed away in chests, together with a large amount of clothing made of the skins of wild cat, martin and other animals. The temple abounded in the most splendid mantles of feathers. Ad joining was a storehouse, containing eight apartments, abound.ing in valuable relics.\"\n\nAt a town in Arkansas, salt was made into small cakes and sold among the various tribes for skins and mantles; it was made from the shores of a lake, and at several saline springs. \" Pro ductions were abundant; peas, squashes, beans, pumpkins and corn grew with but little labor throughout the whole country ;. persvmons, which were made into large cakes, were eaten in winter, with walnut and bear's oil.

Those who were able would build houses in squares at the base of the mound, and the lower class build wigwams on the suburbs.\n\nWhen married Indians died in battle it was the custom of the women to visit the graves of their husbands and deposit upon them the arms which they used in hunts and in war, and the shells out of which they were accustomed to drink. They would Cut off their flowing hair and lay it over the graves ; they Would not marry again until their liair regained its former length. They would surround tiie chief, stoop at his feet, cover their faces with their hands, weep, and implore him to be reveiiged for the death of their husbands, and to grant them a support during their widowhood, and to permit them to marry again when the time appointed by law expired.\n\nSuch were the customs of the natives in 1540-42, when DeSoto was between the Savannah and the Mississippi. Though very many of the tribes spoke different languages, their habits were very similar. The names of the tribes, with a few excep tions, seemed to have been called after that of their respective caziques. History tells us little of the Georgia Indians from the time of the expedition of DeSoto down to the arrival of Oglethorpe at Yamacraw Bluff, on the Savannah river, in 1733, and during that long interval, within ten years of two centsries, of which we have such scant records, we will call the \" dark ages \" of our history, and proceed to the ground upon which the city of Macon stands.\n\nNone of the rivers seem to have been nanied. when DeSoto crossed them. The length of his march from one Indian tribe to .another, the towns his own reports refer to, the relics of these towns, their proximity to rivers that he crossed, and the tradi tions of Indians partially enable the historians to locate ais\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n41\n\n3|li!$ '-& very large tribe of Indians inhabited the country on liiptStbank of the Ocmulgee river, occupying a great extent IfflSiory.

Conquering all the tribes in Georgia on their route, they then went to near the mouth of the river, where Savannah now stands, met a powerful and numerous tribe called the Uchees, whom, after a long conflict, they conquered and brought to the Chattahoochee.\n\nThe first and only instance of the Indians ever keeping a re cord of their history was discovered by Leclerc Milfort, a young Frenchman and adventurer, and a man of high talents, who lived twenty years among the Creeks, commencing in 1776. Milfort was associated with that most extraordinary Indian chief Alexander McGillivray, and married his sister. Both of these men were renowned for their talents and acted a very important part with the French, Spanish and British governments in their relations with Southern Indians during the revolutionary war. They were afterwards employed by President Washington, with high rank and responsible trusts.\n\nPickett says of Milfort: \"When he arrived among the Creeks, the old men often spoke of their ancestors, and they exhibited to him strands of pearls which contained their history and constituted their archives. Upon their arrangement de pended their signification; and only principal events were thus preserved. One of their chaplets sometimes related the history of thirty years. Each year was rapidly distinguished by those who understood them. The old men, therefore, with.the .assist ance of these singular records and strong memories, were ena bled to impart to Milfort a correct tradition,\" etc. The won derful record was a summary of the route and adventures of the Creeks from the time of their departure from Mexico to their settlement in Ohio. The names Ocmulgee, Oconee and Ogechee first appear about 1620, when the Creeks . invaded the country from the:west. Many of the Indian names have been cor rupted.

Bartram says : . \"About eighty miles above 1:te Qemulgee and Oconee, the trading path\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nfrom Augusta to the Creek Nation, crossed these fine rivers. On the east bank of the Ocmulgee, this trading road runs two miles through ancient Indian fields, called '\" Ocmulgee Fields :\" they are the rich low lands of the river. On the heights of these law lands are visible monuments, in traces, of an ancient town such as artificial monuments or terraces, squares and banks, en circling considerable areas. Those old fields and planting land extend up and down the river fifteen or twenty, miles from this site. If we are to give credit to the account the Creeks give of themselves, this place is remarkable for being the first town or settlement, when they sat down, as they term it, or established themselves, after their emigration from the west, beyond the Mississippi, their original native country. On this long journey they suffered great and innumerable difficulties, encountering and. vanquishing numerous tribes of Indians, who opposed and . retarded their march. Having crossed the river.; stilli pushing eastward, they were obliged to make a stand and fortify them selves in this place, as their only remaining hope, being to the last degree persecuted and weakened by their surrounding foes. Having formed for themselves this retreat, and driven off the inhabitants by degrees, they recovered their spirits and again faced their enemies, when they came off victorious in a memor able arid decisive battle. They afterwards gradually subdued their surrounding enemies, strengthening themselves by taking with the confederacy the vanquished tribes.\"\n\nOf the religion of the Creeks, Bartram says: \" These Indians are by no means idolaters, unless their puffing the tobacco smoke toward the sun aiiii rejoicing at the appearance of the new moon, may be termed so. So far from Idolatry are they that they have no images amongst them, nor any religious rite or ceremony that I could perceive; but adore the Great Spirit, the giver and ta'ier ajway of the breath of life, 'with the most profound and s-espggtnil homage.

The temple mound was erected for religious purposes; the others were heaped up, probably, in honor of the dead. In their vicin ity the fields are filled with sherds, shells of pearl-bearing Unio anfl fragments of articles of domestic economy. Upon the acclivity east of the central mound are the manifest remains of an aboriginal settlement. Here, in excavating for the new track of the Central railway, the workmen, a short time since, un earthed, a few feet below the surface, several skeletons, in con nection with which were found heads of shell and porcelain, a part of a discoidal stone, several arrow and spear points, two stone celts, a clay pipe, an earthen pot and other matters ot a primitive character fashioned for use or ornament.\n\n\" This excavation for the line of the railway necessitated the removal of a considerable portion of the northern side of the central mound. In the conduct of this work the laborers, while cutting through the slope of the mound at a lower depth, exhumed several skulls, regular in outline and possessing the ordinary characteristics of American crania. Associated with these skeletons were stone implements--the handiwork of the red race--and Venetian heads and copper hawk-bells acquired through commercial intercourse with early traders and voyagers. The fact was patent that, at least, some of these inhumations had occurred subsequent to the period of primal contact be tween Europeans and the Indian. Passing below these inter ments--which were evidently secondary in their character--and arriving at the bottom of the mound, a skull was obtained which differed most essentially from those we have described as belong ing to a later inhumation. It was vastly older than those of the\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n47\n\nsecondary interments and had been artificially distorted to such an extent that the cerebellum was quite obliterated, while the front portion of the skull had not only been flattened but irregu larly compressed so as to cause an undue elevation and diver\n\ngence to the left.\" After describing other skulls, Mr. Jones continues : \" Among\n\nthe relics found in the vicinity of this old, artificially compressed skull was a total absence of European ornaments. Here we have an interesting demonstration of the fact that these ancient tumuli were, in turn, used by tribes who perhaps had no knowl edge of the one of the other. The flattened and distorted skull belongs to the mound-building people to whose industry the erection of these tumuli is to be referred. It was in perpetua tion and in honor of such primal sepulture that this mound was heaped up. In the course of time these sepulchral and temple structures, abandoned by their own own owners, passed into the hands of other and later red races who buried their dead upon the superior surface and along the slopes of the ancient tumuli, having at the time, perchance, no personal acquaintance with, and frequently not even a distinct tradition of the peoples to whose exertions these evidences of early construction were at tributable. * * * The Creeks did not claim that these tumuli were erected by them. They declared that they were here when their ancestors first possessed themselves of the region. Who these flat-head mound-builders were, is matter for conjec ture. It may be that they were a colony of the Natchez, jour neying hither from their old habitat on the banks of the Missis sippi. Certain it is that these tumuli antedate the traditions of the Creeks who were native here at the period of the English colonization.\"\n\nThe most remarkable eminence of which we have any record is BROWN'S MOUNT (not mound,) near the Ocmulgee river about seven miles below Macon. It is a very high hill, and upon one side is nearly precipitous. Upon this mount, named after Mr. George A. Brown, who first owned it, are many curiosities, among which are now slight traces of ancient fortifications.\n\n48\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF MACON\n\nForty to fifty years ago the stone walls, ditches and lines of the ancient works presented sufficient remains to identify the exact plan of the fortifications which had been located there, similar to those DeSoto found in Florida, North Georgia, Alabama and elsewhere. DeSoto never built any fortification. His business was to search for gold. He passed through Georgia without any resistance from the Indians. He stopped on the Ocmulgee only a few days. He was in less than thirty days marching from the present Tallahassee, Florida, to Silver Bluff, below Augusta, on the Savannah river, therefore, he had no time to erect forts.\n\nOf Brown's Mount, Mr. Jones says : \" Following the natural conformation of the summit boundaries, and at'some points re tired a distance of twenty yards or more from the edge of the hill, are the remains of an old wall--constructed of boulders of rock and earth--which encircled and fortified the entire top of the mount. About sixty acres, I am informed, are thus enclosed. Attendant upon the wall are traces of both an outside and inside ditch, the former being originally about ten feet wide and four feet deep, and the latter some three feet wide and between two and three feet deep. The earth removed in the construction of these ditches was used in conjunction with the stone boulders in building this wall. Within the recollections of persons still living, this wall was four feet high and between four and five feet in thickness. It will be perceived that the height of the wall was practically increased by the depth of the ditch; so that the defenders standing in the ditch would be completely pro tected from the shafts of their assailants.\" * * * \"Upon the wall trees are growing more than three feet in diameter. This was, without doubt, the work of the red men, and in an cient times constituted a fortified retreat. Similar structures exist within the limits of Georgia and in many portions of the United States. It will be remembered that, in the absence of any speedier mode of transmitting intelligence, the Indians sig nalled by means of fires kindled upon prominent points. Through their intervention the approach of danger was herald ed, and the lurid warning quickly repeated until the members of\n\nAND CENTRAL GEORGIA.\n\n49\n\ntribe, through all their abodes, were rapidly put on the alert. Such is the location of Brown's Mount, and so abrupt and com manding its exposure on the west, that signal fires kindled there could be readily seen and interpreted even by the primitive dwellers upon the banks of Flint river. From the side which looks toward Macon, kindred warnings--cloudy pillars of smoke by day and bright flames by night--would quickly summon the warriors of the upper Ocmulgee, and put those who there inhab ited, upon notice. Doubtless, during the forgotten past, this fortified hill answered important military uses in the conduct of the ever-recurring strifes which existed among the redmen.\n\nThe impression entertained by some that it is the work of DeSoto and his followers, is erroneous.\"\n\nCol. Jones describes very accurately the great curiosity on the mount, which will be at once recognized by many of the older citizens of Macon, who in times past had so often spent the day in picnic excursions at this favorite sylvan retreat: \"Within the enclosure are the traces of two small earth-mounds, and near the northeastern side is a pond or basin, eliptical in form, covering about a quarter of an acre. Of late years it has been drained, and at the time of my visit it contained no water. The statement was made that this was an artificial basin and that its bottom had been plastered with clay at some remote period, so as to more effectually retain the rain-water, which would from time to time accumulate in it. I had no means at command for making an examination and testing the truth of this assertion. The pond was overgrown with trees and filled with decayed leaves and loam. To all appearances it seemed a natural resovoir, although it may be that the natives originally made this excavation with a view to supplying themselves with water in the event of a seige. The natural supply of this fluid, upon ordin ary occasions, was probably derived from four springs issuing from the northern, eastern, southern and western faces of the hill, in each instance, not more than fifty yards of the wall. Indications still exist tending to establish the fact"
