"People call this my 'concept record' and I guess it sort of is, though in truth only about half the songs fit the military history description that the album is known for. I didn't do it on purpose; I just ended up writing and recording a bunch of songs that look at war from different angles. It made for an interesting departure from the previous albums which were relatively more commercially successful. This record definitely has it's loyalists—fanatics, even—and has brought an element of military men and women to my audience, which I think is awesome. It was produced by Harry Stinson, who also produced Five Dollar Bill, Hair In My Eyes Like A Highland Steer, and Losin’ Lately Gambler."
