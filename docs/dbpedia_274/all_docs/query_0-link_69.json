Dear Sir,\n\nWe refer.to the meeting held in the P.S.A offices this morning, and\n\n.have pleasure in giving you the further information you requir~\n\nBackground\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nA Japanese ship in difficulties off-Horsburgh light some\n\nyears ago jettisoned about one hundrE!d tons of tin ingots\n\nin order to save the ship. The question of recovering\n\nthis cargo has arisen. In our opinion the recovery opera-.\n\ntion, though of an unaaual kind, should not be too difficult.\n\nWhat is very difficult.is the location of these very small\n\nobjects, and the success of the whole api!ration·depends\n\nentirely arr.whether this location can be made. ·\n\nIn order to assess the.feasiblity we wish to run highfrequency\n\nsidescan lines of intervals through the area,\n\nin order to discover how smooth the seabed is. Not until\n\nthis has been done will it be worth while embarking on\n\nwhat may be a very speculative venture.\n\nJ\n\nThe area concerned is shown on the attached. diagram. It\n\nis clear o~ the Traffic Separation Zone north of the lighthouse,\n\nand lies within the territorial waters of HorsburgtJL\n\nislets (assuming 12 mile limits and·the customary methods\n\nof determining base-lines).\n\nThe approximate co-ordinates of its cornl;!rs are:\n\n1° 301 N 104° 31* E\n\n10 261 N 104° . 261 E 1°' 25 1 N 104° 331.! E\n\n1° 21 1 N 104° 301 E\n\nThe whole area is within sight of the lighthouse.\n\nThe proposed location equipment is a Kleine 500 khz sidescan\n\nsonar belonging to Associated offshore-Onshore Services\n\n(Pte) Ltd. So far as we·are aware, this is the only sidescan\n\n·on this frequency available in Singapore. ·\n\nPositioning will be by hOrizontal sextant angles, because\n\ngreat .accuracy is not required ai; this stage.\n\nDirectors: F.H.F, .Hinds . Dr, A. Herbert\n\nRegistered In Englan~· No. 1556487\n\nPersonnel Mr. F. H. F •. Hinds, who was trained as a hydrographic\n\nsurvey .officer in the British Navy will be in charge\n\non board the survey launch assisted by Mr. Md. Ismail.\n\nA sonar operator will be provided by the equipment\n\nowners, end the boat owners will provide the crew.\n\n~ It has proved to be difficult to find a craft suitable\n\nfor this survey. The one selected is a wooden twinscrew\n\nmotor boat of 11.5 mtrs in length and 3.9 mtrs\n\nbroad while powered by 2 X 216 hp GM engines and registered\n\nas SZ 4045 G. This boat has very unusual layout\n\nwhich makes it idEal for this purpose.\n\nTiming· Timing is governed by the availability of the special\n\nsidescan equipment, and by the tides (neaps being -\n\npreferable). The most favourable period is between\n\n9th - 14th July 1981. The duration will be about ·two\n\ndays and it is hoped to fit it into that period.\n\nOther Information\n\nThe most important information still missing is the\n\nexact circumstances of the loss of this cargo, and therefore\n\nthe precise legal ownership of it. This information\n\nhas not yet been abtain from Japan because the feasibility\n\nof any recovery operation is very doubtful until a preliminary\n\nsurvey has been made. Moreover, it was not until\n\nthis morning that we had been informed that the waters\n\nbelonged without doubt to Singapore.\n\nRegis, Ltd is the successor in the specialised.business\n\nof recovering lost cargoes to. a British firm which has recovered\n\nmore than 80 major cargoes since World War II.\n\nThe great majority of these operations have been on behalf\n\nof the British government, and all have been conducted in\n\nthe most formal and correct way, in accordance with laws and\n\nregulations that are very well\" understood. There is no\n\nquestion at all that the same will happen in this case.\n\nWe maintain that.we have a good reputation to care for and\n\nare ambitious in having further ,contacts with you.\n\nIt is hoped that it may be possible to draw up an outline agreement in\n\ntime to permit this search to go ahead.·\n\nFor sake of.conveniently updating your file in this matter, we enclose\n\ncopies of all correspondence for your retention. Once again, our\n\nsincere thanks for your hospitality afforded to us.\n\nYours faithfully, rrncr:_1s\n\nF.

The ship's course was 082°T.\n\n2. 3 The master left the second officer in charge of the bridge and went down\n\nto his cabin at OlOU hours on 22 June 1985. The second officer was keeping\n\nthe 0000-0400 hours and 1200-l&OO hours watches.\n\n2. 4 Vessel. was on automatic steering since ful 1-away. The A. B. was keeping\n\nlookout on the bridge with the second officer.\n\n2.5 At 0230 hours, while vessel was still on automatic steering the ship's\n\ncourse was altered to 049\"T to pass Horsburgh Lighthouse on the starboard\n\nside. Vessel -was also proceeding in the appropriate lane in the traffic\n\nseparation scheme for that area.\n\n2. o The last fix prior to grounding was obtained at 0245 hours with Horsburgh\n\nLighthouse bearing 064°T x 2. 7 miles. At the same time another vessel was\n\nproceeding in the same direction overtaking her on the port quarter.\n\n2.7 At 0249 hours, the A.B. reported that there was a flickering light ahead,\n\npres1J1nably a small fishing vessel. The secon<l officer could not find the\n\ntarget on the radar on 6 mile$ range and on 3 miles range. The second\n\nofficer then instructed the A. 8. to change over to manual steering and to\n\nsteer starboard 10.\n\n2. 8 In an attempt to avoid the boat the vesse 1 went closer to Horsburgh\n\nLighthouse. \"1ith the wheel still on starboard 10, the second officer\n\nassumed that the vesse 1 could pass south of the shoals of ~idd le Rocks.\n\n2.9 At 0255 hours~ vessel went aground in appro~imate position with Horsburgh\n\nLighthouse bearing ooo·r x 0.45 mile.\n\n3 EVENTS AFTER THE GROUNDUIG\n\n3. 1 The vessel went aground on a heading of O!:l0°T. She subsequently developed\n\na list of 3.5° to port.\n\n]. 2 The second officer rang the general alar;n and stopped the engines. As soon\n\n,1s he felt the impact of the groumling, the master was soon on the\n\nbridge. No immediate attempt was ma<le in using the engines to refloat her.\n\n3. 3 All crew were summoned to don on their lifejackets anJ to prepare the\n\nlifeboats for lowering.\n\n3. 4 The master instructed that all tanks and bilges to be sounded.\n\n3. 5 Efforts were made to establish contact wi eh Singapore Radio but there was\n\nno reply due to transmission weakness of the ship's VHF.\n\n3. b The second officer initiated the distress message on the VH.F. The master\n\nhad refuted the second officer's claim that the master had given him an\n\naffirmative nod when asked whether to transmit the distress message.\n\nI 11441\n\n-3-\n\n3. 7 The vessel 'Pacific Ranger' ,....as soon in the vicinity of the casualty to\n\nrender assistance as requested, The 1 Pac1.fic Ranger' was requested to\n\nrelay a message to Kota Angkasa' s owners in Singapore and she left the\n\nscene after being informed that no assistance ~as required.\n\n3.8 The day and\n\nInternational\n\ndisplayed.\n\nnight signals for a vessel\n\nRegulations for Preventing\n\naground as\n\nCo 11 is ions\n\nrequired by\n\nat Sea 1971\n\nthe\n\nwere\n\n3.9 Vessel refloated herself at 1150 hours on 22 June 19~5 during high tide.\n\n3.10 The salvage tug 'Smit Colombo' arrived at the vicinity of the grounding\n\nat 1201..1 hours but no assistance was rl:!quired from her.\n\n4 F1ND1NCS\n\n4. l The passage near Horsburgh Lighthouse is a very busy waterway and a\n\ncritical area as regard to na11igation. tt is an area where the density of\n\nconverging traffic is gr<'!at and the freedom of movement of shipping is\n\ninhibited by restricted sea-rooru.\n\n4. 2 The master was not on the bridge nor diri he leave any written or verbal\n\ninstructions to be called when approaching Hursburgh Lighthouse.\n\n4.3 The weather was fine and clear, visibility was good and the sea was\n\nslight.\n\n4. 4 Vessel was on auto,natic steering when navigating in dangerous and confined\n\nwaters.\n\n4.5 Vessel was transiting the traffic separation scheme for that region prior\n\nto the grounding.

Continuous pumping\n\nout of se~ water was carried out.\n\n4.12 The master gave instructions to all crew members to don their lifejackets\n\nand to pre pare the 1 i feboa t s for lowering in case an eu1ergenc y d eve loped •\n\n4.13 Underwater inspection by divers was perfor,ued outside Singapore port limit\n\non :l3 June l9b5.

He had failed to leave any written or verbal instructions to\n\nbe called when approaching H0rsburgh Lighthouse as his presence on the\n\nbridge would in all probai>ility have averted. th,l ca$ualty.\n\n;iith the tidal prediction$ available and kno•o1in~ the natuce of the\n\nsea-bed, the 111aster fa.i led to consiJer l i:shtening the vessel to e11sure\n\nthilt the vessel would not break-uμ du~ to hogJing or sag,,;ing stress on the\n\nsldp1 s bottuu on the falling ticle.\n\n5. 3 The master had failed to ensure the use of nanual steering when\n\nnavigating in dan~erous and confined waters. Ke permitted the vessel to go\n\non automatic steering which contradicted his stanrling ord~rs to be on hand\n\nsteering when navigating in traffic lane.\n\n5.4 The second officer had navigated the vessel in an unprofessional and\n\nunsearaanlike fa.shi.on prior to the grounding. He oad made an .1lteration of\n\ncours~ without first ascertaining his position and failerl to assess the\n\ndesired effect of the alteration by fixing the ship's position. He had\n\nalso steered a coucse to avoid the boat and the shoals of Middle Rocks\n\nwithout due consideration tn the effect of tidal currents at tl~ material\n\ntime, thus caus1.ng the vessel to set nt)rthward anrl finally run aground.\n\nS. 5 The second officer had failed to summon the master when he was in doubt.\n\n5. b The second officer ha,:1 failed to take the 111ost appropriate action in the\n\ncircum.st<l.nces to avoid the imminent danger by stopping the entines and\n\nexecuting astern propulsion taking into account of her restriction that by\n\naltering her course to starboard or port would bring vessel closer to\n\nu .. n-sburgh l.ighthouse or creating a dangerous situation for the overtaking\n\nvessel on her port quarter respectively.\n\n11146 j\n\n- 5. 7\n\n6\n\n-5-\n\nIn view of the a~ove, the cause of grounding was that the second officer\n\ntliinking that the vessel could pass s.1.fely to the south of the shoals of\n\nMiddle Rocks maintained the steering wheel on starboard 10 ...,ithout due\n\nconsideration to tile effect of tidal currents. He siiould irnve »1a..ie a\n\nsubstantial alteration of course by putting the wheel hard over to\n\nstarboard t.:, counteract the effect 1)f the north-easterly tidal curr-ents.\n\nHe also made the alteration without verifying his posit ion and did not\n\ncheck whether the vessel ;.;ras 1;1ai11taining the desired effect of the\n\nalteration.\n\nRECm£.1..ENDA TlONS\n\no. l ;,:o forlllal invest iJat ion is reco,n,nendeJ as it ts unl i~e ly tu shed any\n\nfurther light on the matter.\n\n6. 2 'Ihe groundin11 was a direct result of the irresponsible and negligent part\n\nof the master for adopting a lax attitude with retard to the supervision\n\nof navi6ation and poor passage planning of the vessel and the\n\nunprofessional and unseama.nlih~ fashion on the part of the second officer\n\nin the way lie hacl tc1ken tl,e avoidintS action.

On 20 Jun 88 at about 0455 hours, she grounded in position\n\nLatitude 01° 19.5'N Longitude 104° 24.75'E (4 cables off Horsburgh\n\nlighthouse). She sustained extensive damage to the ship's bottom and\n\ninternal structures. Most of the double bottom tanks and No 3 hold were\n\nbilged. She was refloated on 23 Jun 88 after discharging about 4000 tons\n\nof cargo. After refloating, she was towed to Singapore. At Singapore she\n\ndischarged all the cargo and was subsequently dry docked for permanent\n\nrepans. There was no injury to any person nor oil pollution from the\n\nincident.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPARTICULARS Of THE VESSEL\n\nName\n\nOf fie al number\n\nPort of registry\n\nGross tonnage\n\nType of ship\n\nYear built\n\nClassified by\n\nTotal crew\n\nOwners\n\nLIST OF ANNEXES\n\nCrew List\n\nBinta Yar'adua\n\n376088\n\nLagos\n\n13315\n\n: Multi-purpose container\n\n1986\n\nLloyds Register of Shipping\n\n30 persons\n\nMss Africa Ocean Lines Ltd\n\n5 Creek Road\n\nAdapa, Lagos\n\nNigeria\n\nAnnex 1\n\nAnnex 2\n\nAnnex 3\n\nAnnex 4\n\nAnnex 5\n\nAnnex 6\n\nAnnex 7\n\nAnnex 8\n\nAnnex 9\n\nAnnex 10\n\nCopies of the ship 1s statutory certificates\n\nCopy of the chart used by the vessel\n\nReport of the shipping casualty submitted by the master\n\nStatements from the witnesses\n\nExtracts from the vessel's deck log book\n\nCopy of the cargo plan\n\nBrief operating instructions for steering controls\n\nDiver's report\n\nPlan of the vessel's double bottom tanks\n\n-2-\n\n4 • SEQUENCE OF EVENTS PRIOR TO GROUNDING\n\n• 1 The vessel was on a voyage from Santos (Brazil) to China via\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong. She arrived at Singapore on 16 Jun 88 and was\n\nanchored in the eastern working anchorage. At Singapore, she loaded a\n\ncargo of plywood and general cargo for Hong Kong and carried out repairs\n\nto the bridge control system of the vessel 1 s main engine •\n\n• 2 On 19 June 88 at 2030 hours a Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)'s\n\npilot boarded the vessel, She was not ready to sail as her cargo was not\n\nsecured. At 2200 hours the crew completed securing the cargo •\n\n• 3 At 2223 hours the vessel commenced weighing her anchor. At 2224\n\nhours, the anchor was aweigh. The pilot guided the vessel out of the\n\nharbour. At 2315 hours the pilot disembarked.\n\n, 4 Soon after that the ve sse 1 crossed the west bound 1 an e of the\n\ntraffic separation scheme (TSS) and joined the east bound lane. She\n\ncommenced sea trials to check the bridge control system of the vessel's\n\nengines which was earlier repaired in Singapore •\n\n• 5 On 20 Jun 88 at about 0200 hours, the sea trials were completed,\n\nThe master turned the vessel and crossed the traffic lane of the TSS to\n\nreturn to Singapore. At 0318 hours, the technicians (who did the sea\n\ntrials) disembarked in position Lat 1c 1S.3'N long 104° 05.4'( off Johore\n\nShoal Buoy.\n\n, 6 At 0320 hours the vessel resumed her voyage to Hong Kong, A\n\nlittle later, the vessel crossed the west bound lane and joined the east\n\nbound lane of the TSS. At 0342 hours when she was in position Lat 1° 15.4'\n\nN long 104° 05.4' E the master rang full away and steadied the vessel on a\n\ncourse of 089° (T) and {G) (see the chart in Annex 3),\n\n.7 At 0400 hours the second officer plotted the ship's position. A\n\nlittle later he handed watch to the chief officer and left the bridge •\n\n• 8 At about 0410 hours, the master 'acquired' Horsburgh lighthouse\n\non the automatic radar plotting aid (ARPA). (This procedure is used in an\n\nARPA to mark an echo to differentiate it from other echoes.) He then\n\nshowed the chief officer the position of the lighthouse on the radar screen\n\nand visually, He also pointed to the chief officer the position where the\n\ncourse was to be altered. A few minutes later the master left bridge.\n\n, 9 At 0415 hours, the chief officer plotted the vessel's position by\n\ntaking radar hearing and distance from a point identified by him as Tanjong\n\nAyam. He found that the ship had drifted slightly (2 cables) to the south\n\nof the course line. He adjusted the course from 089° (G) to 083° (G) on\n\nthe autopilot (see Annex 3).\n\ni 1154 [\n\n-3-\n\n.10 At 0430 hours, the chief\n\nagain. He found that the p::isition\n\nHe adjusted the course on autopilot\n\nofficer plotted the vessel's position\n\nwas slightly north of the course line.\n\nfrom 083° (G) to 073°(G).\n\n.11 At about 0445 hours, when Mungging lighthouse was abeam of the\n\nvessel the chief officer asked the EDH to take the wheel and alter course\n\nto 045° (G). He then went to the chart room and plotted the 0445 hours\n\nposition by taking radar bearing and distance of Tanjong Punggai. The\n\nvessel's position was about 3 cables east of the charted course line. He\n\nremained in the chart room to check the subsequent charts •\n\n• 12 A couple of minutes later the deck cadet informed the chief\n\nofficer that Horsburgh Lighthouse was seen on the port bow instead of being\n\non the starboard bow. The chief officer went to the wheelhouse, had a look\n\nand returned to the chartroom. He checked the radar (to read the display\n\nof bearing and distance of Tanjong Punggai taken at 0445 hours) end the\n\nchart to confirm whether he had plotted the 0445 hours position correctly.\n\nHe found that the position was plotted car rec tl y •\n\n• 13 A few minutes later, the chief officer returned to the\n\nwheelhouse. He was thinking what could have gone wrong. In the meantime\n\nthe cadet also went to the chartroom to check the chart. The chief officer\n\nnoticed that the lighthouse was getting closer on the port bow. At about\n\n0455 hours he ordered 11hard a starboard\". A few moments later the vessel\n\nfelt heavy vibrations, slowed down and grounded. TI,e chief officer put the\n\npropeller pitch to zero position and sunmoned the master.\n\n5 SEQUENCE lF EVENTS ArTER TfE GROUHDING\n\n• 1 The mast er immediately rushed to the bridge. He plotted the\n\nvessel's position and found that she had grounded in shallow waters about 4\n\ncables east of Horsburgh Lighthouse on a heading of 090° (G),\n\n.2 The master instructed the chief\n\nthe chief engineer to check the soundings\n\nand to find out the depth of water around\n\nofficer, the second officer and\n\nof all compartments in the vessel\n\nthe ship •\n\n. 3 from 0503 hours to 0519 hours and from 0643 to 0711 hours the\n\nmaster tried to refloat the vessel by usinq her engines but in vain,\n\n.4 The soundings revealed that eight of the vessel's double bottom\n\nballast tanks and number 3 hold were bilged (see annex 10). The vessel was\n\naground from the forward upto the engineroom bulkhead. The propeller was\n\nclear •\n\n• 5 At 0721 hours, the master sent urgent messages to Port Master,\n\nthe local agent and the owner's representative in Singapore.\n\n-4-\n\n.6 At 1038 hours a salvage tug came alongside the vessel. At about\n\n1300 hours the owners representative boarded the vessel. At about 1630\n\nhours salvage divers commenced under water survey to check the extent of\n\ndamage •\n\n• 7 At about 1900 hours a representative from the vessel's\n\nunderwriter boarded the vessel. At about 1930 hours the salvage divers\n\ncompleted under water survey and qave the master a report of the extent of\n\ndamage (see annex 9) •\n\n• 8 On 21 Jun 88 at about 0052 hours, after consulting the\n\nunderwriter's and the owner's representative, the master signed salvage\n\nagreement (Lloyds Open Form) with Ms Salvindo. The salvage team commenced\n\nsalvage operations •\n\n. 9 At about 0730 hours the sea became choppy and the vessel\n\ncommenced shipping seas on deck. About this time, the master noticed that\n\nthe pipe duct compartment was getting flooded. At 0752 hours the master\n\nsigned another salvage agreement with Ms Smit Tatk To wage and Salvage\n\nCompany •\n\n• 10 The salvage team pressurized the flooded tanks and lightened the\n\nvessel by discharging about 4000 tons of cargo from her deck and holds into\n\nlighters •\n\n• 11 On 23 Jun 88 at about 1523 hours the vessel refloated at high\n\nwater. The salvage tugs towed the vessel clear of the reefs and assisted\n\nthe vessel to Singapore. The ship was anchored off .Johore Shoal Buoy for\n\ntemporary repairs •\n\n• 12 On 30 Jun 8A at OS31 hours she shifted to Sembawang Wharf. She\n\ndischarged all her cargo and subsequently shifted to an anchorage to wait\n\nfor dr ydock •\n\n• 13 She drydocked on 9 Aug 88. In drydock the damaged plates and\n\nframes were renewed and other repairs carried out. She completed her\n\nrepairs on 29 Aug 88. The vessel is still in Singapore anchorage due to\n\nlitigation by various parties.\n\n6 FINDINGS\n\n.1 On departure from Singapore the ship had a crew of 30 Nigerians\n\nand 2 Taiwanese superntmeries. According to the owner's representative the\n\nship was to be sold to a Taiwanese company on completion of her voyage.\n\nThe supernumeries were the superintendent engineers of the new owners.\n\nCopy of the crew list is in Annex 1.\n\n111s& I\n\n-5-\n\n.2 lhe ship's master, the chief officer and other officers and\n\nengineers were holders of appropriate certificates of competency issued by\n\nthe Department of Trade UK .\n\n. 3 The vessel's certificates were all current and valid at the time\n\nof the grounding, Copies of the statutory certificates are in Annex 2 •\n\n. 4 The vessel was built in 1986 and was appar\"'~nt;Jy new. She was .._.,.,--\n\nequipped with the modern navigational equipment such as Gyro, radar, ARPA,\n\necho sounder, log and satellite navigator. All navigational equipment were\n\nin working order and being used at that time, The ship's officers also\n\nconfirmed that there was no failure of any equipment or machinery prior to\n\nthe incident.\n\n,5 According to the master the vessel's bridge control system was\n\ndefective during the voyage from Brazil to Singapore. In Singapore the\n\ncontrols system was repaired by two East German technicians from the\n\nmanufac t'urers of the equipment. The master had requested his owners to\n\nhave sea trials to ensure that the controls worked sat.isfactorily in sea\n\ngoing conditions. On 19 Jun 88 after disembarking the pilot, a sea trial\n\nwas conducted while the vessel was proceeding along the east bound lane of\n\nthe TSS. At about 0200 hours on 20 Jun 88, when the master was satisfied\n\nthat the controls were working sa.tisfactorily the vessel returned to\n\nSingapore to disembark the technicians off Johore Shoal Buoy. At 0320\n\nhours the ship resumed her voyage. If the vessel had not conducted the sea\n\ntrials she would have passed Horsburgh Lighthouse by about 0300 hours.\n\n,6 The chief officer, the deck cadet and the EDH went off duty at\n\nabout 2230 hours on 19 Jun 88 (when anchor was weighed) and resumed duty at\n\n0400 hours on 20 Jun 88, They would have had a rest of about 5 hours when\n\nthey took watch •\n\n• 7 The weather at the time of the incident was calm with clear\n\nvisibility. The traffic in the Strait was also light. The tide off\n\nHorsburgh Lighthouse was predicted to be setting north-easterly (OS5°T) at\n\nabout 2 knots •\n\n• 8 The vessel 1 s positions were plotted every 15 minutes. From the\n\npositions it is evident that the vessel had not experienced any strong\n\ncurrents or tidal sets. Adjustments to the courses steered made during the\n\nperiod were minor and could be considered normal for a vessel of that size,\n\n.9 The chief officer had plotted the vessel 1s positions at 0415,\n\n0430 and 0445 hours. These pos.i tions were obtained by taking radar bearing\n\nand distance from the points identified by him on the radar screen\n\nas Tanjong Ayam, Tanjong Kelok and Tanjong Punggai respectively. None of\n\nthese positions were counter checked by either taking visual bearings or\n\n-6-\n\nchecking radar distances from other known points. It is therefore likely\n\nthat these positions could he erroneous •\n\n• 1 0 The vesse 1 would have had a clearance of about O. 9 miles from\n\nHorsburgh Lighthouse if she had proceeded along the charted track. The\n\nreefs east of Horsburgh Lighthouse were the proximate danger area along the\n\nroute in the chief officer•s watch. Although the master had shown the\n\nposition of Horsburgh lighthouse on the radar and visually to the chief\n\nofficer, he had not used it as a reference point for checking his\n\npositions nor did he take visual or radar bearings from it. He had also\n\nnot used parallel indexing technique using the lighthouse. Had he done\n\nso, he could have monitored the vessel's positions continuously in relation\n\nto the lighthouse and would have been aware of any drift of the vessel and\n\ncould have taken corrective measures •\n\n• 11 From 0400 until about 0500 hours, the cadet was keeping a lookout\n\nfrom the wheelhouse and had not assisted in any other duties on the\n\nbridge. In my opinion, the chief officer should have better utilized the\n\ncadet by asking him,check the courses steered, take visual bearings and\n\nplot positions • Lt..,\n\n• 12 Neither the chief officer nor the cadet checked the compass to\n\nensure ~ether the EDH was steering the correct course. They were\n\ntherefore not aware whet her the EDH was steering the correct course •\n\n• 13 The vessel was on autopilot from about OJ42 hours. At about 0445\n\nhours, the chief officer commenced to alter course on the autopilot. A\n\nlittle later he asked the EDH to take over the wheel. Before handing over\n\nthe wheel, the chief officer did not change the steering controls from\n\nautopilot to hand steering mode. This was confirmed by the cadet who said\n\nthat he had a few minutes later changed the steering to hand steering mode\n\nwhen the autopi 1 at I s \"off course a 1 arm\" sounded. As the vesse 1 was on\n\nautopilot mode when the wheel was handed to the EDH, the vessel would not\n\nhave properly responded to the wheel and would have been steering an\n\nerratic course until the steering mode was changed by the cadet. This\n\ncould be a possible reason for the vessel to drift east of her intended\n\ntrack •\n\n• 14 The deck log book states that the chief officer had commenced\n\naltering course at 0450 hours (see Annex 6). Based on the vessel's speed\n\nand her positions as plotted from 0400 hours, the estimated time when the\n\nvessel would have reached the alteration point is al 0440 hours. If the\n\nvessel had commenced altering course only at 0450 hours she would have\n\ndrifted about 1. 5 miles east of the course Une. This is evident from the\n\ncadet's testimony who said that Horsbugh Lighthouse was observed on the\n\nport bow even after the vessel was steadied on the new course.\n\nI 11se I\n\n.15 From the chief officer's and the cadet 1 s testimony it is apparent\n\nthat the chief officer had spent most of the time (after he took over\n\nwatch) in the chart room and had not kept an efficient lookout. [)Jring\n\ncoastal passages, 6fficers are required to spend as little time as possibfe\n\nin the chartroom for the necessary performance of navigational duties (such\n\nas plotting positions) but should ensure that an efficient lookout is\n\nmaintained •\n\n• 16 When the cadet informed the chief officer that the lighthouse was\n\nseen on the port bow, instead of assessing the situation and taking\n\ncorrective action, the chief officer wasted valuable time in a futile\n\nexercise of rechecking his earlier positions and trying to figure out what\n\ncould have gone wrong. Setting of a vessel (due to action of wind,\n\ncurrent, larger turning circle etc) which requires minor adjustments to the\n\ncourse steered is a very common occurrence during coastal passages. A\n\nprudent officer in his position would have quickly assessed the situation\n\nand altered course to port towards deeper waters away from the danger1 then\n\nchecked the vessel's position. After confirming his position he would have\n\nordered the correct course to steer and would have closely monitored the\n\nvessel's positions until the danger was cleared •\n\n. 17 The chief officer said that when the lighthouse was very close he\n\nhad given the order \"hard a starboard\". However, later in his testimony he\n\nchanged that to 11h ard a part\" ( see Annex 5), The vessel's he ad ing when she\n\ngrounded was 090° and the course steered before grounding was 045Q. It is\n\ntherefore unlikely that the course was altered to port. In my opinion,\n\neven at that late stage, the grounding could have been averted if the\n\ncourse had been altered to port away from the reefs •\n\n• 18 The master was on bridge from about 2230 hours on 19 Jun 88 until\n\nabout 0415 hours on 20 Jun 88. If he had remained on the bridge for about\n\nhalf an hour more or until the final alteration of course to pass the\n\nHorsburgh lighthouse the vessel may have cleared the lighthouse safely.\n\nHowever in this case the master had handed over watch to the chief officer\n\n(the senior most deck officer) a little earlier after giving him clear\n\ninstructions how to pass off Horshurgh lighthouse. This could have been\n\ndue to the fact that the master had been on the bridge for a long period\n\nand may have been tired. The passage after the lighthouse is clear for\n\nabout 100 miles. In my opinion it would have been better if the master had\n\nremained on bridge until the vessel passed clear of the lighthouse or he\n\nhad steadied the vessel on the final course to pass clear off the\n\nlighthouse.\n\n7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n.1 The main cause of the grounding was that the vessel had drifted\n\nabout 1.5 miles east of her charted track. The vessel was then heading\n\nonto the reefs off Horsburgh Lighthouse. The chief officer had ample time\n\nand opportunity to take corrective action. However he did not do so. One\n\ncan therefore only conclude that the grounding was the result of the\n\nnegligent manner in which the chief officer had navigated the vessel •\n\n• 2 The chief officer had failed to:\n\n(a) supervise the change of steering from autopilot to hand\n\nsteering- mode when he asked the EDH to take over the wheel;\n\n(b) check the course steered by the EDH;\n\n(c) note the dangers to navigation expected along the vessel's\n\ncourse in his watch;\n\n(d) keep an efficient lookout;\n\n(e) assess the situation and take appropriate action when the\n\ncadet informed him that the lighthouse was seen an port bow\n\ninstead of being on the starboard bow;\n\n(f) make intelligent use of navigational equipment like radar,\n\nARPA and gyra repeaters for checking positions of the\n\nvessel; and\n\n(g) alter course clear of the danger when the lighthouse was\n\nclose to the ship.\n\n'fr.,....\n\n.3 A prudent master would have remained onLbridge until the vessel\n\nhad cleared Horsburgh lighthouse or until he ensured that the vessel was\n\nsteadied on the final course to pass clear of the lighthouse. If the\n\nmaster had been on the bridge at the material time, he could have taken\n\ncorrective action and the vessel may not have grounded.\n\nB RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n.1 I do not recommend a formal inquiry as it will not shed any\n\nfurther light on the incident .\n\n• 2 The grounding was due to the negligent manner in which the chief\n\nofficer navigated the vessel and ta a lesser extent the failure of the\n\nmaster to remain onl1:'ridge until the vessel had cleared Horsburgh\n\nlighthouse. As both these officers are Nigerians and the vessel is\n\nregistered in Nigeria I recommend that we inform the Nigerian authorities •\n\n• 3 I also recommend that we should not recognize the certificate of\n\nthe chief officer for employment on Singapore ships •\n\n.0 •, j} •:.. -->t..:=.--\n\n1 MS /W --\n\nAnnex 160\n\nSingapore's Note SHC 98/89 dated 16 June 1989\n\nSHC 98/89\n\n·The High Comaie11ion of the _Republic of Singapore\n\npresents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign\n\n·Affairs, Malaysia,. an~ has the honour to refer to the\n\nlatter•a note EC 36/89 dated 19 April 1989.\n\nThe High Commission wiahes to·expresa ita serious\n\nconcern over the arrests of the eight Singapore-registered\n\ntishing vesa~ls.\n\nThe coordinates given in the Ministry's not•\n\nIC 36/89 confirm that five of these vesse1s were arrested\n\noutside Malaysian territorial waters.\n\nThree vessel• - SMP 698, SMF 1058 and SMF . 1032-\n\nwere arrested in areas where .the boundaries of the various\n\nmaritime zones hava not yet been resolved.\n\n'l'wo vesaels were arrosted in Singapore territorial\n\nwaters surrounding Pedra Branca: SMF 1045 at lat 01' 28'\n\n21• N long 104' 31' 2511 B, 11.2 nautical miles from Pedra\n\nBranca, and SMF 1047 at lat 01• :z7• Z4\" N long 104• 31' 36\"\n\nE, 10.5 nautical miles from Pedra Branca.\n\ni 1161 I\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore has on\n\nfour pr~vioua occasions informed the Malaysian High\n\nCommieaion in Singapore that Singapore exercises\n\nsovereignty over Pedra Branca and the waters around it.\n\na.
