        "text": "METIN AKAY\n\n(Nominated by IEEE Division X)\n\nFounding Chair\n\nJohn S Dunn Endowed Chair Professor\n\nHouston, Texas, USA\n\nDr. Akay is the founding chair and JS Dunn Endowed Professor of the new Biomedical Engineering Department at the University of Houston. He was awarded with honoris causa by the Aalborg, the Silesian Technology and Pecs Universities. He authored over 20 books, 120 journals papers and 200 conference papers and abstracts. He delivered more than 100 keynote and plenary talks at the well-respected international conferences including ICASSP twice. Dr. Akay is a recipient of the IEEE EMBS Early Career and Service Award, an IEEE Third Millennium Medal and the prestigious Vladimir Kozma Zworykin Award by the IFMBE. In addition to IEEE, he is a fellow of the Institute of Physics (IOP), the International Academy of Medical and Biological Engineering (IAMBE), the American Institute of Medical Biological Engineering (AIMBE), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). His research focuses on neurotech for addiction, brain cancer chip and coronary occlusion.\n\nStatement\n\nI will be your voice on the IEEE Board of Directors and represent the Division X Societies on developing and implementing new initiatives beneficial to the needs of our members. My aims are to (1) increase public awareness about exciting innovative technologies for the advancement of human health and wellbeing by organizing forums in areas of climate, space and manufacturing that engage the passion of our students and academic, industrial, healthcare leaders; (2) promote global diversity by encouraging underrepresented leaders to engage in our conferences, publications, technical and membership activities; (3) encourage our industry professional members to assume leadership roles in our technical activities and conferences/workshops. (4) make our conferences more appealing by focusing on innovations, career growth/development while making attendance more affordable; (5) increase the visibility of IEEE, showcasing how engineering innovations have impacted humanity and fostered economic growth; (6) Expand Open Access to provide better service and visibility.\n\nTogether, we need to envision, lead and implement innovative and transformative solutions to solve challenges facing humanity through engineering/technology.\n\nIEEE Accomplishments and Activities\n\n(S’87-M’91-SM’93-F’09)\n\nAs Division X Director-Elect I am keen to work closely with our members, other directors, communities and the public to increase the awareness of engineering innovations and technical activities within IEEE. I see my role as motivating, inspiring, rewarding our members and mentoring the next generation of leaders.\n\nI served as the President of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology (2021-2022), IEEE EMBS ADCOM since 1997, IEEE Press, Proceedings of the IEEE, IEEE T-BME, JBHI and several other IEEE journals, and on the Steering Committee of the FDC and IEEE Brain Technical Community.\n\nSome of my achievements include:\n\nCreated and chaired the first Neural Engineering Conference sponsored by IEEE, NIH and NSF in 2003, which benefited the careers of many IEEE members, now distinguished professors and leaders in Neurotech companies.\n\nPromoted engineering and healthcare innovations by editing 20 special issues including the Processing of the IEEE to highlight the fields of Neural Engineering, Biomedical Informatics.\n\nCreated and chaired several highly successful Public Forums for Public Engagement and Awareness, including (1) COVID-19 Health Care, (2) Data Science in Healthcare, (3) Healthcare Industry (medical devices, biopharma, biotechnology, life sciences, and neurotechnology) with 1000-3000 participants. More than half of the speakers were women/minority.\n\nLed joint forums with international universities, including the first IEEE EMBS Forums with Tel-Aviv University in Israel (2022) and with NUS in Singapore (2023) on Data Science in Healthcare and Medicine. Launched IEEE EMBS Regional Conferences in China, Europe, Africa and South/Central America and Middle-East.\n\nLaunched the Annual IEEE EMBS summer school/academy on BIO-X in 2001, which has trained more than 550 students. More than half are woman and currently hold faculty positions in universities and/or leadership roles industry.\n\nSupported to improve the impact factor for IEEE EMBS RBME and 12 IEEE EMBS Journals and Magazine."
