I know oui means yes, but the addition of oulala, I'm assuming that's a good thing? But what exactly does that mean in reference to my question? Does that mean he's excited? I would hope so\n\nHello SheShe81 and welcome to this forum!\n\nThis sounds to be a very good news for him as if he didn't expect such a pleasant question from you."
