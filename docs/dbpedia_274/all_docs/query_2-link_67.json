From the super anticipated, brain-fuck of a fight between Jones/Cormier to kick off the year, to Conor McGregor relishing in his dominance once again, to Rumble pulling off a stadium-esque upset, to finally this LEGENDARY scrap between Silva/Diaz it’s clear we as TRUE fight fans were […]\n\nRead more \"The Average Joe’s Guide to MMA Betting: UFC 183 Edition\"\n\nThe Staples Center can’t catch a break when it comes to the UFC.

Unfortunately, Chris Weidman vs. Vitor Belfort is off. http://t.co/5JSK88FSKK — John Morgan (@MMAjunkieJohn) January 30, 2015 In […]\n\nRead more \"Weidman Injured; Rousey vs Zingano headlines UFC 184\"\n\nThe 2015 Royal Rumble wrapped up just moments ago, and I’d like to get some quick thoughts out coming out of the show. After Bray’s win over Bryan on Raw this past Monday and also at last year’s Rumble, it’s clear that Bray has DB’s number. The dominant performance (what a weak exit for […]\n\nRead more \"Quick Royal Rumble Reaction\"\n\nThe 2015 Royal Rumble is just a few hours away and the excitement is building with each passing second. We all know of the names that people want to win; Roman Reigns and Daniel Bryan are dominating that discussion. What about the surprise entrants? Rumors are running rampant of names like Bo Dallas, Diamond Dallas […]\n\nRead more \"Spot Fest: The Royal Rumble\"\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year.

Demian Maia (19-6) makes his return to the octagon after an 11 month lay off to battle undefeated Ryan LaFlare (11-0) in what should be an exciting Welterweight fight. Maia was victorious in his last fight after defeating Alexander Yakovlev by decision in […]\n\nRead more \"UFN 62 From Brazil gets Saunders, Thomson, Maia\"\n\nUFC Officials confirmed today that Bobby “King” Green (23-6) has suffered an injury and is forced to remove himself from his April 4 fight against Jorge Masvidal (28-8) at UFC on Fox Sports 1 from Fairfax, VA.

Nothing wrong with that, but when it’s literally affecting your ability to make money because it’s against the rules then maybe he should re-think things.
