        "text": "Dressed in an Armani suit, Patrick Georges, a Brussels brain surgeon, drives all the way across the city to eat at the famed Maison Antoine. For gastronomes, little Belgium produces some of the best haute cuisine in the world.\n\nBut Maison Antoine is no Michelin-starred restaurant. It doesn't even have tables. No, it's a friterie, a stand specializing in fried potatoes--French fries to outsiders. Although Maison Antoine serves sausages and hamburgers, most customers come strictly for frites (pronounced \"freets\"), ordering a $1.75 pile served in a paper cone and topped with a dollop of mayonnaise. \"This is the food of my childhood,\" says Georges, savoring his frites the traditional way--standing on the sidewalk, eating with his fingers. \"It warms your stomach.\""
