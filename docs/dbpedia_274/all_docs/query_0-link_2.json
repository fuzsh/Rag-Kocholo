        "text": "The Royal Oak limited edition \"30th Anniversary City of Sails” is a double celebration.\n\nReleased in 2002, it first pays homage to the 30th anniversary of the Royal Oak.\n\nIt also celebrates the victory of the Geneva-based Alinghi sailing team at the America's Cup.\n\nThe watch was produced in 1,250 examples in stainless steel. It was the first Royal to be fitted on a rubber strap, which is particularly welcome for a timepiece linked to the nautical world. The model has an attractive dial with the main plate colored in slate grey and the contrasting outer track and subsidiary dial in black. It further has luminescent roulette Arabic numerals and the striking Alinghi logo at 9 o’clock. This example comes complete with its presentation case and certificate of origin."
