        "text": "“‘True’ is all about the things you can count on to change and the things that will remain static.”\n\nNature, and our daily walks with our dog, and human nature, equally influenced the writing of this song. The second verse with its references to guns was written after the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy.\n\nWhen it came to laying the song down we knew that resonator guitar was the right sound for the track and built the recording around its warmth and presence.\n\n‘True’ reminds us of the ’70s folk and singer/songwriter vinyl we grew up on.”\n\n—Ari Shine and Adrienne Pierce\n\nWe’re delighted to premiere “True,” the first single from The Royal Oui’s self-titled, full-length debut which will land on store shelves on February 11, 2014."
