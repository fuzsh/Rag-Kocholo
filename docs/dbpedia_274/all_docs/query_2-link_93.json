        "text": "Discovery Channel’s Shark Week, which has been around since 1988, comes around every July or August for a whole week, captivating millions of viewers with an uneasy blend of pseudo-science, fiction, and entertainment focused on sharks. The question always comes up, “Are there sharks in Jamaica?”\n\nI was surprised at how many people believe that as long as there is a beach there are shark attacks.\n\nNot true.\n\nOne thing you can be reasonably sure of, whether you are staying in a hotel or at one of the many Jamaica villas, is that you don’t have to worry about your vacation being ruined by sharks in Jamaica.\n\nTop 10 Countries for Shark Attacks Around the World – and Jamaica isn’t one of them!\n\nWhile shark attacks are rare, they are more common in some parts of the world than in others. The US, Australia, and South Africa head the list. See the full list here.\n\nAt #51, this is one list Jamaica is happy to rank low on! And that’s fine. Come on down the water is just fine.\n\nFrom 1837-present, there have been 812 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks in Florida, 159 in Hawaii, 122 in California, and 102 in South Carolina, making those states the top states for shark attacks in the US.\n\nAt first blush, these numbers may look high. But, look at the time span … 1837 to present. So sleep easy. The truth is that shark attacks are rare. The odds of being attacked by a shark are about one in 11.5 million.\n\nCommon question … Are the sharks in Jamaican waters?\n\nCaribbean reef sharks, tiger sharks, hammerheads, and bull sharks have been reported. This makes sense since those types of sharks are known to like warmer waters, such as what you would find in Jamaica.\n\nYou wouldn’t expect to find Great White sharks in Jamaica as they prefer colder waters.\n\nPerhaps, the most common sharks in Jamaica are nurse sharks, which are docile creatures that tend to live towards the bottom of the seafloor. Here is a video where a diver encountered one while scuba diving.\n\nThe cases of shark attacks in Jamaica have been few and far between. SharkAttackData.com reports 10 fatal attacks from 1827 to last update, which seems to be in 2013.\n\nLocal news sources reported a fatality from a shark attack in March of 2013 after a Jamaican fisherman got separated from his group while spearfishing about 3 miles off the south coast. There is a report from September 2018 of a fisherman who is presumed dead from a shark attack off James Bond Beach, outside of Ocho Rios, in St. Mary’s parish. In May 2021, a fisherman was killed while spearfishing in Westmoreland, on the southwestern side of the island.\n\nIf the 2018 incident is actually true, that would bring the total count to 12 in almost 200 years. Yes, years.\n\nThe attacks seem to have been way out in deep waters and associated with deep-sea fishing, spearfishing in particular, and diving.\n\nSharks have been sighted mostly on the Southern coast of Jamaica but not many to speak of on the Northern Coast. Of the recorded attacks, almost all were in the Kingston Harbour – Port Royal area which is south to south-east or in the Westmoreland area which is on the southern side of western Jamaica.\n\nThere is speculation that the natural reefs off the North Coast, which make snorkeling and scuba diving so great, serve as a great barrier keeping large sea-life such as sharks at bay. Larger sharks stay away from coral reefs and are usually beyond the reefs in deeper waters, not near the shore.\n\nYes, they are but they are a generally harmless variety.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, “Nurse sharks are slow-moving bottom-dwellers and are, for the most part, harmless to humans. However, they can be huge—up to 14 feet (4.3 meters)—and have very strong jaws filled with thousands of tiny, serrated teeth, and will bite defensively if stepped on or bothered by divers who assume they’re docile.”\n\nSharksider.com states, “The threat to humans is very minimal. There have only been a few attacks ever recorded, and only one of those attacks was unprovoked. No fatal attacks have ever been recorded.”\n\nSo in reality, they won’t bother you if you don’t bother them.\n\nIf you go scuba diving or sail out in deep waters or if you are snorkeling by the reefs away from the shore, you could see sharks which, 99.999% of the time in Jamaica, will be harmless nurse sharks.\n\nThe chance of a shark coming near you is exceedingly low. So low that the shark scene in Jamaica will not get us featured on Shark Week. And that is perfectly fine with us.\n\nThe historical data shows 11 fatal shark attacks in Jamaica in almost 200 years.\n\nIf you’re not convinced that the odds are low, consider this.\n\nAn estimated 2.7 million tourists visit Jamaica each year. Jamaica has an estimated population of 3 million people.\n\nIn the last 5 years, there was one unconfirmed fatality, a local fisherman. Let us assume that he was actually killed by a shark as opposed to being bitten or eaten by a shark after he died at sea.\n\nIf we assume that between 2.7 million and 5.7 million people enjoy watersports and swim in Jamaica’s waters each year, the odds of dying from a shark attack is between 1 in 2.7 million and 5.7million, worst-case scenario based on the experience of the last 5 years. If you include the almost 200-year history, the odds are much lower than that.\n\nCompare those odds to the odds of being struck by lightning in a given year, which according to the US National Weather Service is 1 in 1,222,000.\n\nSharks are beautiful creatures that contribute great value to our world. Unfortunately, they are presently endangered.\n\nAs predators at the top of the ocean’s food chain, they are critical to maintaining balance in the marine ecosystem.\n\nOverfishing has reduced their food supply. Many are killed every year from being caught in nets and injured by boats. Hundred of thousands, if not over a million, are killed each year for their dorsal fin then left to die.\n\nWithout action, there will be no more sharks. Some species are already extinct.\n\nDiscovery Channel has the platform with its Shark Week program to do more education on the value of these majestic creatures. Hit them up on Twitter (#DiscoveryChannel) and tell them we want more facts not fiction – Entertainment and education are not mutually exclusive!"
