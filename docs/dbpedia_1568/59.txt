Overview

Our Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) program will prepare you for a career as an operator of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as “drones.” Hinds also partners with industry and government to provide essential skills to operate safely within the federal airspace system. Throughout the curriculum, you will get hands-on operation of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, understand full-scale simulator software/hardware systems, learn about UAVs from basic stages to the advanced stages, launch and recovery techniques, autopilot operations, develop knowledge of risk awareness, and data links and sensors.
