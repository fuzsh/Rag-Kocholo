The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems

The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Research is hosted by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The centerâ€™s research focuses on adding autonomy to UAS, to allow one operator to control multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that can autonomously search, find, identify, and track various targets. UAS serve as an excellent platform for cadets across various disciplines to conduct meaningful research supporting the warfighter.
