        "text": "ONLINE\n\nUtilizing modern day technology, USI coursework can be delivered utilizing video based meetings built into the coursework on the Learning Management System. This model allows for instructor facilitation and learner driven completion. USI utilizes this model for homeschool students and commercial learners.\n\nGet Started\n\nHYBRID (ONLINE & IN PERSON)\n\nFor classrooms that meet a couple of days a week, the hybrid model presents an effective option. Much like the online model, the instructor facilitates the classroom and provides lectures while in the classroom and the learner completes the online coursework between sessions.\n\nGet Started\n\nIN PERSON\n\nThis model is preferred by some as it is completely classroom driven. There is still an online component to the coursework including assessments, but incorporates more lecture based delivery of the content in the textbook as well as classroom discussions. Due to the length of some of USI's coursework, this is only an option for some of the shorter frameworks unless ample time exists for in person delivery.\n\nGet Started"
