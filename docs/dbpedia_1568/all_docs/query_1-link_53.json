        "text": "Types of drones according to wing types\n\nHere is a rundown of the four main types of drones according to wing type, their uses, their advantages, and disadvantages：\n\nDrone type\n\nAdvantage\n\nDisadvantage\n\nUse\n\nMulti-rotor drones\n\nEasy to control and maneuver\n\nVTOL and hover flight\n\nOften lower price\n\nPortability\n\nLimited flying time\n\nSmall payload capabilities\n\nLess stability in the wind\n\nLower flight speeds\n\nAerial photography\n\nAerial inspection\n\nLanding surveying\n\nAgriculture\n\nFixed-wing drones\n\nLonger flight time\n\nCan carry a heavier payload\n\nGreater stability in the wind\n\nHigher flight speeds\n\nMore training needed\n\nNo VTOL/hover\n\nExpensive\n\nDifficult to land, more places needed\n\nAerial mapping\n\nUtility inspection\n\nSurveillance\n\nAgriculture\n\nSingle-rotor helicopter drones\n\nVTOL and hover flight\n\nLong endurance (with gas power)\n\nHeavier payload capability\n\nMore dangerous\n\nHarder to fly, more training needed\n\nExpensive\n\nAerial LiDAR laser scanning\n\nFixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones\n\nVTOL and hover\n\nLong-endurance flight\n\nFast speed\n\nHeavier payload capability\n\nMore training needed\n\nExpensive\n\nAerial mapping\n\nUtility inspection\n\nSurveillance\n\nAgriculture\n\nSearch and rescue\n\nMulti-rotor drones\n\nMulti-rotor drones, also known as rotary-wing, are the most widely used type of drones for recreational and professional use. Their small size and excellent control make multi-rotor drones the best choice for aerial photography.\n\nOffering great versatility, they allow the installation of all types of cameras to perform different tasks. They are drones that can hover easily and take off vertically, adding more flexibility as well.\n\nHowever, the biggest drawback of multi-rotor drones is usually related to the flight autonomy they offer. Adding more rotors makes the drone more difficult to control. All those moving parts also consume extra energy, draining the battery faster. Most multi-rotor drones have a flight time of less than an hour. If we want to perform certain tasks that take a long time, we have to have several batteries to replace them. This also means extra costs.\n\nFixed-wing drones\n\nFixed-wing drones are those capable of harnessing air and generating forces that allow them to stay in the air by taking advantage of their aerodynamics. They are similar in design or aesthetics to radio-controlled aircraft and are often used to map large areas due to their powerful autonomy. They take advantage of their aerodynamics and design to keep them afloat, which means they have a longer endurance and flight speed.\n\nThe downside of fixed-wing drones is that they tend to be more expensive compared to multi-rotor drones. They require a large, clear space to take off and land, just like airplanes. Some larger models also require specialized ground equipment to help them take off and land. In addition, fixed-wing drones can only fly forward, so they do not offer the same maneuverability as multi-rotor drones.\n\nSingle-rotor helicopter drones\n\nPowerful and durable, single-rotor drones look similar in construction and design to actual helicopters, with only one rotor to provide power, plus a tail to control direction and stability. Combining the advantages of tiny multi-rotor drones and single-rotor drones, they are better suited to carry larger payloads and fly more efficiently than multi-rotors. Single-rotor devices typically use gas engines rather than batteries, which greatly increases their flight time.\n\nHowever, these drones tend to be larger and more complex than other types of UAVs. This means they are more expensive and more difficult to operate, and their larger blades can make them more dangerous.\n\nFixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones\n\nAs the latest drone technology to be introduced, fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones refer to fixed-wing aircraft that have been modified to take off and land vertically. They combine the long-range and flight time of fixed-wing UAVs with the vertical takeoff capability of rotary-wing devices, eliminating the drawbacks of fixed-wing UAVs that require large spaces for takeoff and landing. They are designed for mapping, power line inspection, surveillance, agriculture, and rescue operations.\n\nHowever, this VTOL drone tends to be unsuitable for beginners, and the more advanced technology puts it at the high end of the fixed-wing drone market in terms of cost.\n\nTypes of drones according to their sizes\n\nDrones can be classified according to their size, from very small drones to large drones.\n\nSize\n\nLength\n\nPropeller diameter\n\nWeight\n\nUse\n\nVery small drones\n\n150mm (15cm, 6 inches) or less\n\n51mm (2 inches) or less\n\n200 grams (0.2kg, 0.44lbs) or less\n\nMilitary surveillance\n\nSmall drones\n\nUp to 300mm (12 inches)\n\n76-152mm (3-6 inches)\n\n200-1000 grams (0.44-2.2lbs)\n\nIndoor equipment inspections\n\nRecreation and photography\n\nMedium drones\n\n300-1200mm (12 inches – 4 feet)\n\n150-640 mm (6-25 inches)\n\n1-20kg (2.2-44 pounds)\n\nProfessional applications\n\nAmateur photography\n\nLarge drones\n\n120cm (4 feet) and up\n\n64 cm (25 inches) and up\n\n20kg (44 pounds) and up\n\nEnemy detection and combat capabilities\n\nCivil applications such as drone deliveries or filmmaking\n\nVery small drones (Nano)\n\nThe size of these drones can be as small as an insect and easily fit in the palm of your hand, with dimensions between 1 and 50 cm. Because of their small size and wing design, nano drones can fly in very confined spaces and are not easily detected and are mainly used by spies to gather information on people and objects.\n\nSmall drones\n\nSmall drones they are slightly larger than micro drones, between 50 cm and 2 meters. The wings of these drones are usually fixed and can be easily lifted by the arm and thrown into the air. They can be used for indoor equipment inspections (prop guards, cages ......), but they are more often used outdoors for recreation and photography, such as traffic management.\n\nMedium drones\n\nMedium-sized drones are larger and heavier than smaller drones, with dimensions exceeding 2 meters and weighing up to 200 kilograms. They take two people to lift them, which are most often used for professional applications and amateur photography.\n\nLarge drones\n\nLarge drones are comparable in size to smaller aircraft and are used mainly for military purposes such as surveillance and strategy. With the most advanced technology, they are replacing fighter jets, allowing for rapid enemy detection and combat capabilities. They are also designed for civil applications such as drone deliveries or filmmaking.\n\nTypes of drones according to their payload capacity\n\nHow much weight a drone can carry will depend on the power of the motor, and the lift generated by the propeller in standard weather conditions. Below we will divide UAVs into four categories based on the weight of the payload they can carry.\n\nDrone type\n\nWeight\n\nPayload capacity\n\nUse\n\nFeatherweight drones\n\nLess than 11 grams (0.011 kg)\n\n4 grams to 100 grams (0.004 to 0.1 kg)\n\nMilitary surveillance\n\nLightweight drones\n\n200-1000 g (0.2-1 kg)\n\n150-270 g (0.15-0.27 kg)\n\nRecreation and photography\n\nMiddleweight drones\n\n1-600 kg (2.20-1323 lb)\n\n400-1460 grams (0.4-1.46 kg)\n\nProfessional applications\n\nAerial photography\n\nHeavy-lift drones\n\nMore than 160 kg\n\nMore than 1,000 kg\n\nEnemy detection and combat capabilities\n\nCivil applications such as drone deliveries or filmmaking\n\nFeatherweight drones\n\nThese are typically referred to as nanoscale drones, which weigh as little as 11 grams (0.011 kg) and can only carry payloads ranging from 4 grams to 100 grams (0.004 to 0.1 kg).\n\nLightweight drones\n\nLightweight drones refer to mini drones with an average weight of 200-1000 g (0.2-1 kg), and their payload capacity averages between 150-270 g (0.15-0.27 kg).\n\nMiddleweight drones\n\nHere we are referring to medium-sized drones weighing between 1-600 kg (2.20-1323 lb). They are generally divided into two categories: commercial drones and military drones.\n\nThe payload capacity of consumer and commercial mid-weight drones averages between 400-1460 grams (0.4-1.46 kg). An example of a consumer/commercial drone is the JOUAV CW-15, which is capable of carrying an incredible 3 kg of different payloads!\n\nMilitary mid-weight drones have payload capacities between 40 kg (88 lb) and 150 kg (331 lb).\n\nHeavy lift drones\n\nHeavy lift drones refer to large drones, mainly military drones, with a small percentage used for delivery and high-precision mapping. These drones weigh more than 160 kg, with some weighing more than 1,000 kg. Their payload capacity can reach 550 kg and above.\n\nTypes of drones according to drone range\n\nAccording to the range, UAVs can be classified into very close range, close range, short range, mid-range, and long range.\n\nDrone range\n\nFlight distance\n\nFlight time\n\nUse\n\nVery close-range drones\n\n5 km\n\n1 hour\n\nRecreation\n\nClose-range drones\n\nup to 50 km\n\n1-6 hours\n\nMilitary surveillance\n\nAerial photography\n\nShort-range drones\n\nup to 150 km\n\n8-12 hours\n\nLarge-scale surveillance\n\nMapping and surveying\n\nUtility inspection\n\nMid-range drones\n\n644 km\n\n24 hours\n\nMilitary combat and surveillance\n\nLong-range drones\n\nMore than 644 km\n\nMore than 24 hours\n\nMilitary surveillance and espionage\n\nWeather tracking\n\nGeographic mapping\n\nVery close-range drones\n\nVery close-range drones can fly within a range of 5 km from the controller, with an average flight time lasting 1 hour! These drones are mainly used for recreational purposes.\n\nClose-range drones\n\nShort-range drones can fly up to 50 km away from the controller and stay afloat in the air for 1-6 hours. Because they can fly very high, they are often used in military drones for surveillance.\n\nShort-range drones\n\nShort-range drones are drones that can fly up to 150 km away from the controller. With very powerful batteries, they can stay in the air for 8-12 hours and are usually used for combat as well as surveillance purposes.\n\nMid-range drones\n\nThese drones are capable of flying 400 miles (644 km). They can fly at altitudes of 12,000 to 30,000 feet for more than 24 hours. These are typically drones used for combat as well as surveillance.\n\nAs a drone with longest flight time and range, the JOUAV CW-30E has a control range of up to 200 km and a long flight time of up to 10 hours, which are widely been used in large-area surveillance and mapping.\n\nLong-range drones\n\nLong-range drones, also known as endurance drones, are technically and functionally superior to these other drones. It is estimated that they can travel well over 400 miles (644 km) (some reaching hundreds of thousands of square miles) without losing their signal. Although their use is primarily for military surveillance and espionage, they are also used by professionals to track weather patterns, geology, and geographic mapping.\n\nTypes of drones according to their abilities & equipment\n\nToy drones\n\nToy drones it is conspicuous in the toy department of supermarkets, come in various sizes and shapes, with or without cameras, can be used indoors and sometimes outdoors, they can be controlled by remote control or smartphone depending on the model, he is generally moderately priced and is the ideal drone for beginners.\n\nPhotography/videography drones\n\nThere are different kinds of drone models of cameras drones that can record photos or videos in HD, Full HD, or 4K, with the camera mounted on a 2-axis or 3-axis nacelle for perfect image stability.\n\nThey can be equipped with different features, GPS, people tracking, route programming, etc. Getting smaller and more sophisticated, it allows you to capture magnificent images from almost anywhere! Be aware, however, that the production and distribution of photos or videos taken in the airspace are strictly regulated.\n\nRacing drones\n\nCompetitive drone or FPV racing is generally used on private and strictly regulated land and consists of obstacle courses at high speeds by flying a drone with virtual reality glasses, an activity that requires many hours of training to gain the agility and reflexes needed to control the drone. There are now a growing number of clubs that can legally engage in this hobby.\n\nReady-to-use (RTF) drones\n\nRTF drones are drones that are available for users to assemble themselves. You can put all the parts you need in one kit, making it a fun experience as you build your drone!\n\nGPS drones\n\nThese drones are connected to satellites and use them as a means of plotting flight direction. They also can \"return home\" when their batteries are low.\n\nProfessional drones\n\nProfessional drones can be equipped with cameras or video cameras for all types of aerial photography. They can also be equipped with probes, sensors, or thermal imaging cameras for technical services such as mapping, surveillance, or others depending on the needs of the customer.\n\nProfessional drones are the only aircraft that can fly over built-up areas, restricted or prohibited areas, and conduct night flights, as long as the professional pilot has made a county declaration and obtained the required authorization.\n\nThey provide many services in the public and private sectors, inspection, control, or monitoring, whether it's beaches, traffic, buildings, or rooftops, these services are huge and continue to grow.\n\nMilitary drones\n\nMilitary drones, the origin of drones, are a completely different drone category from civilian drones. They are increasingly used in various conflicts, initially for surveillance and intelligence, but now they can be armed and become formidable weapons.\n\nDelivery drones\n\nDelivery drones are a new application of drones that are being tested by companies like Amazon. These UAVs types may soon become widely available to us in the future\n\nTypes of drones according to motors\n\nAccording to the motor type, we can divide the drone types into brushed motor drones and brushless motor drones.\n\nDrone motor\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nBrushed drone motors\n\nInexpensive to make\n\nCan be made in a small package\n\nFavorable in extreme environments due to lack of electronics\n\nReplaceable brushes for extended life\n\nTwo-wire control – control is simple; Brushless motors have 3 wires and require a speed controller to work\n\nNo speed controller is required for fixed speed\n\nLess cost\n\nUncomplicated wiring\n\nLow energy efficiency\n\nCommutators and brushes wear out more quickly\n\nBrushless drone motors\n\nNo brushes – lower maintenance and longer durability\n\nMore efficient – less energy wasted as heat\n\nBetter speed and torque due to the absence of brushes, because brush friction increases with speed\n\nWider speed range\n\nBetter heat dissipation due to the construction compared to brushed motors\n\nMore cost-effective for high-speed/power operations\n\nHigh cost\n\nBrushed drone motors\n\nBrushed motors are the type of motor present in most recreational drones. While they are indeed cheaper motors, they also require more maintenance than brushless motors.\n\nThe power of these motors is practically the same in all the models we could find, only the size varies (the larger the size, the more power). However, most of these motors are not in direct contact with the propeller.\n\nThe motor is connected to a pinion gear which turns a large gear which in turn drives the motor. This is called a \"speed reducer\" because due to these two gears we are reducing the maximum power the engine can give us. This will help us operate the drone and will extend its life because we will not be pushing the motor to its limits at any given time.\n\nBrushless drone motors\n\nThe main feature of these motors is the absence of brushes in contact with the rotor. This keeps its maintenance to a minimum and its operation very effective and efficient. In addition, these motors have much higher power than brush/brushless motors (50-70 km/h compared to 150-200 km/h for brushless motors).\n\nHowever, these types of drone motors work mainly with alternating current, therefore, each motor must have its own ESC. ESC (electronic speed controller) or electronic variables that can define the speed of rotation of the brushless motor."
