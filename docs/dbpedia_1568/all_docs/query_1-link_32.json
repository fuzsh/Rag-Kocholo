Drone Pilot Jobs in Energy\n\nDrones are a game-changing technology in the field of power line and solar panel inspections for energy firms.\n\nFor energy professionals looking to incorporate drones into their work, numerous opportunities exist.\n\nCompanies in the energy industry hire UAS operators to conduct various tasks, including aerial photography and videography, surveying and mapping, pipeline monitoring, logistics for oil spill cleanup, and more.\n\nOne point worth noticing is that the Federal Aviation Administration is allowing, through their waiver system, energy firms to conduct BVLOS flights, which are normally prohibited by Part 107 regulations, to inspect larger areas in less time.\n\nBVLOS, which stands for Beyond Visual Line of Sight, refers to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones beyond the typical range where the pilot can visually observe them.\n\nIn April of 2018, the FAA issued the first BVLOS waiver to an energy company, Xcel Energy, for use in inspecting power lines outside Denver, Colorado. Xcel also announced that, following the completion of their mission in Colorado, they would expand BVLOS inspections to additional states throughout the United States.\n\nAs the FAA approves more BVLOS waivers for energy companies, drone work in the sector is poised to expand rapidly, as it will soon be possible for UAV operators to perform more inspections by acquiring more energy firms’ BVLOS exemptions.\n\nTo secure a drone operator job in this industry, you’ll need technical expertise in power lines, solar panels, and other energy-related infrastructure inspections.\n\nIn general, during these inspections, UAV operators identify regions that require maintenance so that difficulties may be detected early and addressed.\n\nTo land a job in power line inspections, knowledge of aerial thermography is required. Magnetic interference generated by power lines may also affect your flight controller and make flying difficult. When conducting aerial inspections, a safe distance of at least 100 feet should be maintained from any power line, and if possible, flying between power lines should be avoided.\n\nMerits and Demerits of Choosing the Energy Industry\n\nLet’s understand the pros and cons of being a drone operator in the energy industry.\n\nMerits\n\nDemerits\n\n1. Using drones to look for any troubles early on means energy places can fix things before they get worse, which costs less money in the long run. 1.

Drones monitor the environment around energy plants and ensure that nothing harms the environment. 2. Drones monitor the environment around energy plants and ensure that nothing harms the environment. 3. Drones can fly around and check on important energy sites. These are Oil pipelines, windmills, or solar panels without anyone having to climb up or get into risky spots. 3. Flying drones, especially near important energy sites, means dealing with a lot of rules that can change depending on where you are.\n\nTypes of Drones Work in Energy\n\nDrone operator jobs in the energy industry offer a wide range of tasks and opportunities for UAV pilots.\n\nTo succeed in energy-related drone missions, it is important to be detail-oriented, efficient, and safety-conscious.\n\nSome examples of related drone-based work include:\n\nSolar panel inspections—Searching for flaws or damages in solar panels using aerial thermography.\n\nWind turbines—Using aerial data to assess the condition of wind turbines.\n\nPower lines—Searching for cut or damaged power lines using aerial data.\n\nPipelines—Finding leaks or cracks in pipelines using aerial data.\n\nInspect stations, support beams, and other infrastructure associated with the items mentioned above using aerial data.\n\n11. Drone Operator Jobs in Telecommunications\n\nDrone operators are transforming the way inspections are conducted in the telecommunications industry. Instead of sending a person up the tower, operators use drones to conduct surveys and inspections in a fraction of the time. This not only saves costs but also ensures safety.\n\nThe use of drones in the telecommunications industry is rapidly expanding, with their applications ranging from cell tower inspection and network maintenance to equipment installation.\n\nIt’s vital to understand what to check for when performing cell tower inspections and surveys.\n\nAT&T has been employing drones for cell tower inspections for a while now, and Verizon sees a lot of potential in the drone sector that they bought Skyward, a drone firm, in 2017.\n\nThe electromagnetic radiation given off by communication towers can cause your drone to crash if you fly too close (i.e., closer than 100 feet). It’s important to be a highly competent pilot and be able to snap photos from a long distance (using Zoom) to work as a telecommunications UAV operator.\n\nOne of the main advantages of using drones for telecommunications is that it allows workers to access hard-to-reach areas without putting themselves in danger. For example, instead of climbing,g a cell tower to inspect it for damage, a drone can do the same job much more quickly and safely.\n\nIn addition, you can also use drones to transport small parts and equipment to remote locations, saving time and money.\n\nAs the use of drones in the telecommunications industry continues to grow, there will be an increasing demand for qualified drone operators.\n\nMerits and Demerits of Choosing the Telecommunication Industry\n\nLet’s understand the pros and cons of being a drone operator in the telecommunication industry.\n\nMerits\n\nDemerits\n\n1.
