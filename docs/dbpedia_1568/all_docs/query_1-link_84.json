        "text": "Advisory Circular (AC)\n\nAn AC is a document produced by the CASA which provides guidance and clarification as to acceptable means of complying with the intent of a piece of legislation.\n\nACs may be found on the CASA Advisory Circulars web page.\n\nAeronautical Information Package (AIP) The AIP is a collection of documents including aeronautical maps, charts and other publications which is produced by Airservices Australia to inform pilots of operational information. Approved area The area approved under regulation 101.030 as an area approved for the operation of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). Aviation Reference Number (ARN) An ARN is a number assigned to an individual or organisation for use when dealing with the CASA. Authority controlling the area\n\nThe entity that has control and has been authorised to manage that type of airspace, e.g.:\n\nProhibited – the secretary to the Department of Defence.\n\nRestricted – the authority mentioned in the aeronautical information publication (as issued from time to time) as the controlling authority for the area.\n\nDanger area – the authority mentioned in the aeronautical information publication (as issued from time to time) as the controlling authority for the area.\n\nBeyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) BVLOS – Flying an RPA without the remote pilot having a visual line of sight at all times. Instead, the remote pilot flies the aircraft from a location remote from the aircraft and uses telemetry to determine the position of the aircraft and to command the aircraft. CASA approval must be obtained for all BVLOS operations. Civil Aviation Act (CAA) Civil Aviation Act 1988\n\nCivil Aviation Regulations (CAR) Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASR) Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998– the majority of rules pertaining to unmanned aircraft operations are contained within CASR Part 101. CASA Licencing and Registration Centre (CLARC) CLARC is the CASA section that deals with the issue of pilot licences including the remote pilot licence. Controlled Airspace (CTA) CTA is airspace of defined dimensions within which an air traffic control service is provided to flights. Controlled airspace surrounds all of the capital city main airports and larger regional airports as well as the military aerodromes. Control Zone (CTR) The CTR is that portion of controlled airspace in the immediate vicinity of a controlled airport where the the controlled airspace extends from the ground upwards. The control zone has a defined upper limit and usually has other controlled airspace immediately overhead. Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) An EFB is a software / hardware system which allows the storage of flight information and access to operational information and briefings. Enroute Supplement Australia (ERSA) ERSA is a document which contains information about registered and certified aerodromes and helicopter landing sites in Australia. It is important to note that ERSA does NOT contain information about all aerodromes and helicopter landing sites. Extended Visual Lline of Sight (EVLOS)\n\nEVLOS is a procedure whereby observers, located remotely from the pilot in command of an RPAS, are used to assist in keeping the aircraft in sight at all times during the operation and in providing separation from other manned and unmanned aircraft. The observers maintain communication with the pilot via radio or some other means through out the operation.\n\nIn theory, if sufficient observers with adequate communications systems could be deployed there would be no limit to the flight distance achieved under EVLOS. In practice however, these operations are difficult to co-ordinate and need extensive communications networks and highly trained and skilled crew to be safely conducted.\n\nHelicopter Landing Site (HLS) A HLS is any area that is used for taking off or landing of helicopters. It is important to note that the majority of helicopter landing sites do NOT appear of any official aeronatical chart but many of the regularly used ones are depicted by electronic flight bag mapping products. Most hospitals now have HLS associated with them. Included RPA\n\nAn RPA operation that requires the pilot to hold a Remote Pilot Licence (or Unmanned Operator’s Certificate) and the operator to hold a Remote Operator’s Certificate (or Unmanned Operator’s Certificate).\n\nIncluded RPA include:\n\nall operations conducted outside of the Standard Operating Conditions (SOC);\n\noperations using aircraft with a maximum take-off weight if greater than 2 kg when operated over a third parties land; and\n\noperations using aircraft above 25 kg maximum take-off weight when operating over the pilot’s own land.\n\nExcluded RPA Unmanned aircraft which may, when operated in accordance with a constrained set of operating conditions known as the Standard Operating Conditions (SOC) may be operated for commercial purposes without the remote pilot needing to hold a Remote Pilot Licence or a Remote Operators Certificate. CASR 101.237 defines excluded RPA. Hazardous operations A person must not operate an unmanned aircraft in a way that creates a hazard to another aircraft, person or property. Refer to CASR 101.055. Hire or reward The term adopted by CASA to define commercial UAV/UAS/RPAS use. Any form of remuneration for flying an unmanned aircraft in an aerial work operation (AWO), however small the AWO task, the reward or UAV; it constitutes ‘hire & reward’ and is therefore defined as commercial. Refer to CASR101.270. NOTAM Notice to Airmen Populous area An area with a sufficient population density that if a fault in, or failure of, the unmanned aircraft (or rocket) poses an unreasonable risk to the life, safety or property of a person in the area who is not connected with the operation. Refer to CASR101.025. Standard Operating Conditions (SOC)\n\nThe SOC are a set of operating conditions which, if fully complied with, allow certain classes of RPA (typically sub 2 kg aircraft) to be operated commercially without the piot in command holding a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) or Remote Operator’s Certificate (ReOC).\n\nTo comply with the SOC the:\n\nRPA must be operated within visual line-of sight.\n\nRPA must not be operated higher than 120 metres (400ft) AGL.\n\nRPA must maintain at least 30 metres away from people who are not directly associated with the operation of the RPA (i.e. only the pilot and observer within 30 metres).\n\nRPA must not be operated within 5.5km of the boundary of a controlled aerodrome.\n\nRPA must not be flown over any populous areas. These can include: beaches, parks and sporting ovals.\n\nRPA must not be flown over or near an area affecting public safety or where emergency operations are underway (without prior approval).\n\nThis could include situations such as a car crash, police operations, a fire and associated firefighting efforts and search and rescue.\n\nThe operator may only fly one RPA at a time.\n\nRemotely Pilot Aircraft Operator’s Certificcate (ReOC) A ReOC is the operating certificate issued to the operator (rather than the pilot) of a remotely piloted aircraft. ReOC were previously known as an Unmanned Operator’s Certificate or UOC (This is like the airline licence for drone operators) Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) A RePL is the licence required for by the pilot of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) An RPA is an unmanned airborne platform which carries sensor/s and/or payload during flight operations."
