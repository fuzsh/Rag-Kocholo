        "text": "New Medical Education Building\n\nA new multi-story building, which will feature approximately 200,000 sq. ft. of medical education programming, will be adjacent to the existing Brody Medical Sciences Building. The new building will support the growth of the Brody School of Medicine’s enrollment from 86 students to more than 120. The building’s design will also focus on high-end technology, versatile medical education classrooms and collaborative meeting and training spaces. The building will include a new Simulation Center and a new Standardized Patient Center, located adjacent to one another. Construction is expected to begin in 2025 with a target completion date of 2027.\n\nClick here for more information!\n\nGraduate Medical Education\n\nThe Interprofessional Clinical Simulation Program collaborates with Graduate Medical Education at ECU Health Medical Center to provide opportunities for simulation-based learning. Educational opportunities include adult, obstetric, and pediatric training in teamwork, communication, resuscitation, and procedural skills. There are opportunities for developing expertise in simulation-based education, elective time in simulation and skills, independent on-demand skills practice, and simulated-based education research.\n\nMedical students and residents should review the Guidelines for Use of the CSC prior to coming to a simulation session."
