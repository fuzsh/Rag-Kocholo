        "text": "Brian Lorenzo, Simulation Operations Specialist\n\nFor Brian Lorenzo, a simulation operations specialist with Carolinas Simulation Center, a typical day might include setting up task trainers and supplies for training in the procedural suite, orienting learners to the trainers, or even designing and making new models to be used for future trainings.\n\n“If you want the stability and science of healthcare, the creativity of art and the innovation of technology, simulation education is where you should be!” he said. “One of the most exciting things about my work is the constant variety that comes with the job. Boring days are a rarity here at CSC. Along with that, because of the growing popularity of simulation in healthcare new ideas are formed and encouraged to be explored.”"
