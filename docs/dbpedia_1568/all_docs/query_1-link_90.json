This is largely driven by a number of global and domestic trends, including rapid technological advancement, increasing availability of drones at a low cost, and a broad industry in which a drone could facilitate work tasks more efficiently than traditional aviation or more safely than workers exposing themselves to risk of falls or other hazards. Operational drone services are expanding for a number of applications such as aerial photography, surveying, building inspections, ice reconnaissance, law enforcement, disaster response, traffic patterns, road repair, research and development, and much more.\n\nDrones can be referred to by various names; however, Transport Canada uses the technical term Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems when referring to drones. The term RPAS is gender neutral and indicates the fact that the pilot controls the device remotely.\n\nThe number of RPAS flown in Canada is estimated to be 193 500. By comparison, it is estimated that there are 37 000 aircraft in traditional aviation, including commercial passenger and cargo aircraft and general aviation aircraft. The growth of this new industry has brought new entrants to aviation. Transport Canada is no longer solely dealing with the typical industries, such as aerospace manufacturers, airlines and airplane pilots. New entrants include commercial RPAS operators, manufacturers, training providers, law enforcement, and academia. Unlike persons who are traditionally involved in aviation, such as commercial airline pilots and military pilots, the new entrants have varying levels of aviation safety awareness, may never have flown traditional aircraft before, and may be unfamiliar with safety-related aviation rules and regulations.\n\nCanadian civil aviation is the responsibility of the Minister of Transport under the Aeronautics Act (the Act). Under the Act the Minister is responsible for the development of regulations governing aeronautics and the supervision of all matters connected with aeronautics. However, there is currently no specific set of rules in place to require the safe operation of RPAS in Canada. Currently, under the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) made under the Act, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) can be defined as either model aircraft, which are aircraft launched into flight for recreational purposes, or unmanned air vehicles that are used for non-recreational purposes. Regarding model aircraft, the CARs require that no person fly an aircraft into cloud or in a manner that is or is likely hazardous to aviation safety. Under Part VI of the CARs, special flight operations involving RPAS that are flown for non-recreational purposes (i.e. work or research) are subject to certain conditions that are set out in a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC).\n\nFlying an RPA has become a common pastime. The recreational RPAS community is estimated at 140 800 operators in 2018 with a projected increase to 225 500 operators by 2025. That being said, the minimal requirements under the CARs for recreational pilots have resulted in a number of incidents (which are often associated with a lack of user knowledge) resulting in a growing risk to aviation safety as well as to people on the ground. Since 2014, the number of RPAS-related incidents reported to Transport Canada has risen over 200%. Incidents have included risks to traditional aircraft while they are on take-off or landing near airports, high altitude flights, and risk of injury to people on the ground caused by events such as a fly-away, which generally means that a pilot cannot maintain control of the RPA or that it ceases to follow pre-programmed procedures. In 2017, the Minister of Transport made an Interim Order (IO) under the Act to address the growing number of incidents. The objective of the IO was to improve aviation safety, to protect the public and to ensure the safe operation of certain model aircraft. It is a temporary measure (renewed in June 2018) until new regulations are in place to require the safe operation of RPAS.\n\nIssues\n\nThe growing RPAS industry has significant economic potential; however, non-recreational operators face considerable administrative burden and uncertainty under the existing rules, which require operators to hold SFOC. Moreover, an RPA flown recklessly or by inexperienced pilots pose risks to aviation and public safety that must be mitigated. An increase in aviation and non-aviation-related incidents has been observed, particularly surrounding operations near and over people as well as in controlled airspace. To date, Transport Canada has been making use of existing regulatory mechanisms in the CARs and legislative mechanisms under the Act (SFOC and IO) to address these risks. However, the current rules are complex, time consuming, and in some cases overly restrictive. In the absence of regulatory change, risks to aviation and public safety will continue to rise in step with the growth in popularity of RPAS. Additionally, the SFOC requirements were not designed for the increasing volume and use of RPAS and will continue to be costly for businesses and introduce unnecessary unpredictability for this emerging innovative industry. In order to effectively address these issues, a modern, risk- and performance-based regulatory environment is required.\n\nObjectives\n\nThese amendments have two main objectives:\n\nRegulatory predictability for businesses\n\nTo move away from the case-by-case treatment of non-recreational RPAS operations by eliminating a number SFOC requirements for VLOS operations. This will create a predictable and flexible regulatory environment conducive to long-term planning while reducing costly administrative burdens on businesses.\n\nSafety risk mitigation\n\nTo reduce the risks to aviation safety and to people caused by the unsafe operation of RPAS, by ensuring that pilots have a relevant knowledge base.\n\nThese amendments introduce service fees for RPAS operators. These fees recover some of Transport Canada’s costs of administering the RPAS registration, examination, and certification programs.\n\nDescription\n\nThese amendments introduce a new Part IX to the CARs that establish rules for all RPA weighing between 250 grams (g) and 25 kilograms (kg), as well as a general provision that prohibits RPA of any weight to be flown in a negligent or reckless manner. The weight threshold refers to the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft; it does not include the weight of the system used to control the aircraft. These amendments establish risk-based rules that mitigate the safety risks of RPAS through requirements for the pilot, the product (i.e. the RPAS) and the procedures to follow. The rules are divided into two areas: “basic operations” and “advanced operations.” The rules governing basic operations apply to the operation of RPAS outside of controlled airspace and more than 30 m away from people. The rules governing advanced operations apply to operations in controlled airspace, near people (between 30 m and 5 m of people), flying over people (less than 5 m from people), and within 3 nautical miles (NM) from the centre of an airport or within one NM from the centre of a heliport.\n\nWhile Part IX of the CARs applies to all RPAS, members of the Model Aeronautics Association of Canada (MAAC) operating at MAAC fields and MAAC sanctioned events will be issued an exemption to certain provisions of the CARs. Under the Act, the Minister has the authority to issue exemptions to the CARs; the exemption will be issued to MAAC before the end of the coming into force of the Regulations.\n\nThe pilot\n\nPart IX of the CARs requires a pilot to be a minimum of 14 years old to conduct basic operations, and a minimum of 16 years old to conduct advanced operations. A certified pilot may supervise someone under the minimum age or someone who has not yet obtained their certificate as long as they meet the certification requirements for the operation being carried out.\n\nAs part of the certification process, all pilots are required to successfully complete a knowledge exam to obtain their pilot certificate. Pilots conducting basic operations must successfully complete the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems — Basic Operations online exam to obtain their pilot certificate. Whereas pilots who are operating under the advanced operations must complete the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems — Advanced Operations online exam, and subsequently complete a flight review with a flight reviewer who is affiliated with a training provider identified by Transport Canada before obtaining their pilot certificate. During the flight review, pilots must physically demonstrate their ability to operate their RPAS and describe the necessary steps and procedures to have a safe flight. After the successful completion of the flight review, the pilot can obtain their advanced pilot certificate. Within every 24 months of the preceding flight, pilots must meet education recency requirements which can consist of training, flight reviews delivered by a third party or recurrent training activities offered by Transport Canada.\n\nThe product\n\nManufacturer requirements\n\nUnder Part IX of the CARs, Transport Canada is introducing a requirement for manufacturers to declare that they have met Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance (the Standard). More specifically, manufacturers whose products are intended to fly in advanced operations must self-declare to Transport Canada whether their RPAS model meets the Standard. The declaration can be made at any time to Transport Canada once the manufacturer has verified that the RPAS meets the technical and documentation requirements (i.e. safety targets), using the self-declaration form available in the Standard. Moreover, manufacturers must provide items such as instructions to consumers on how to operate their RPAS model safely. Manufacturers are not required to present test documentation to Transport Canada and receive approval before making a RPAS model available for purchase in Canada. However, they are required to provide Transport Canada with the test documentation to corroborate the safety assurance should it be requested.\n\nRPAS models that have been previously identified on Transport Canada’s compliant RPAS list are grandfathered for the lifespan of the aircraft for operations near people (between 30 m and 5 m from people) and in controlled airspace. Given the higher risk of flying over people (less than 5 m from people), there is no grandfathering of existing compliant RPAS for this type of operation.\n\nRegistration requirements\n\nA pilot may not operate an RPA (weighing between 250 g and 25 kg) unless it is registered with Transport Canada. Following an application, a certificate of registration, including a registration number, is generated using an online automated system. The certificate is issued to the registered owner of the aircraft and the registration number must be affixed to the aircraft before flying.\n\nThe procedures (Permissions, restrictions and obligations)\n\nPermissions and restrictions\n\nRPA, regardless of whether they are used to conduct basic or advanced operations, must, for example remain below 400 feet above ground level (AGL). There are no speed limits, but it is prohibited for a person to operate an RPA in a manner that is reckless or negligent.\n\nThe amendments establish different rules for airports and aerodromes. Remotely piloted aircraft must stay three NM away from the centre of an airport or from the centre of an aerodrome under the authority of the Minister of National Defence, and one NM away from the centre of a heliport. However, if an established procedure has been identified by the Minister for a specific airport, the pilot may follow that procedure which may allow them to fly closer than three NM. Information regarding established procedures will be available on the Canada.ca drone safety web pages. All pilots (conducting advanced or basic operations) flying near aerodromes must not fly in a manner that could interfere with an aircraft operating in the established traffic pattern.\n\nOther operations, such as night flight with proper lighting, and flying multiple remotely piloted aircraft (e.g. a maximum of five) from one control station is permitted.\n\nRecords\n\nThe CARs require all owners to keep records regarding each flight, and any maintenance, repair or modification performed on their RPAS. All flight records must be retained for a period of 12 months, while records regarding system mandatory actions, repairs and modifications must be kept for 24 months.\n\nExhibit 1 is a depiction of the path to flying a RPAS — from product purchase, registration, pilot knowledge and training and lastly, safety procedures.\n\nExhibit 1: The regulatory path to flying RPAS\n\nSource: Transport Canada\n\nFees\n\nThe fees for the registration, knowledge exam, and pilot certificate services range from $5 per RPA registration to $125 for the endorsement of a pilot certificate with a flight reviewer rating. The costs per transaction to Transport Canada range from $6 to $211, with varying levels of cost recoverable rates.

Despite these efforts, Transport Canada continued to witness an increased number of incidents involving predominantly recreational users. Therefore, greater regulatory intervention was required, which resulted in the Minister of Transport making an IO under the Act in March 2017 which included more restrictive requirements for recreational RPAS operations. Following the making of the IO, Transport Canada noted a 9% reduction in the number of RPAS-related incidents despite the ongoing and sustained growth of the industry.\n\nRecognizing the nature of the IO as a temporary instrument and the restrictive nature of its conditions, Transport Canada considers a more permissive regulatory approach that enables recreational operations within the confines of appropriate regulatory requirements to be more reasonable. These amendments provide a means for greater recreational operations.\n\nStatus quo regulatory approach\n\nWith respect to non-recreational operations, the growing use of RPAS and the requirement for a SFOC for every operation was not sustainable. Transport Canada could not keep pace with the demands, the industry could not innovate as freely, economic opportunities were lost, and frustration with the status quo was creating an environment of non-compliance.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate demands for SFOC and enable lower-risk operations, Transport Canada published two exemptions for RPAS being flown for work or research purposes if the pilot had liability insurance, had read and understood the conditions of the exemptions, and had notified the department before flying. The exemptions were divided into two categories: RPA of 1 kg or less, and RPA weighing between 1 kg and 25 kg. Although this approach provided some benefits and reduced the need for some SFOC, the ongoing growth in the industry and the demands for operations in more advanced environments demonstrated the need for more action.\n\nTransport Canada further examined how SFOC are issued and introduced a series of policy changes to move away from the case-by-case basis of SFOC to the issuance of regional and national SFOC for proven and compliant operators. Although this has assisted in removing some regulatory burden and enabled greater and more routine commercial operations, operators still face administrative burden, delays and uncertainty under this system. A new, modernized and national regulatory framework was needed to fully unlock the potential of the industry.\n\nThe longstanding regulatory requirement for a SFOC coupled with the commercial nature of these operations made a voluntary approach not a viable option.\n\nBenefits and costs\n\nThe amendments will reduce the risks to public safety and reduce the business costs associated with applying for SFOC. The monetized benefits from this regulatory proposal are estimated to be $144.5 million over 2018–2029 (present value, discounted 7% and expressed in $CAN 2018). The associated administrative and compliance costs borne by non-recreational and recreational RPAS pilots, Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and the government are expected to be about $172.9 million over the same period.\n\nTaking monetized costs and benefits together, the quantified present value of net costs is $28.4 million over 2018–2029, or an annualized average of $3.8 million ($CAN 2018, discounted 7%). However, there are many additional non-monetized benefits, notably from reduced risks to traditional aviation and the consistency and certainty the regulations will provide to non-recreational operations, allowing them to make long-term plans and commitments more easily.\n\nGiven the uncertainty that this emerging technology presents, several scenarios and probability distributions accompany the estimates and assumptions presented in this analysis. A sensitivity analysis incorporates these different assumption scenarios and variations, and is presented later in this statement.\n\nThe results of the cost-benefit analysis presented herein reflect the changes made to the amendments since their publication in the Canada Gazette, Part I, which were adjusted based on stakeholder feedback and updated to capture the latest industry forecasts for this quickly evolving technology. Moreover, changes to the Transport Canada user fee schedule for registration, testing, and certification activities have reduced costs for users considerably, especially those operating in advanced environments. A detailed cost-benefit analysis report is available upon request.\n\nAnalytical framework\n\nThe costs and benefits of the amendments have been assessed in accordance with the Treasury Board Secretariat’s Cost-Benefit Analysis Guide. The cost-benefit analysis attempts to capture the economic and social impacts of the regulatory changes (the policy scenario) relative to a world in which these changes did not occur (baseline scenario), pinpointing the incremental changes between the two scenarios. These incremental changes are estimated over 2018–2029 to account for the rapid adoption of the technology and the full impacts of the Regulations. Monetized values are reported in present values over 2018–2029, discounted at 7% and expressed in $CAN 2018 unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe baseline scenario includes the requirements currently found in the CARs. Specifically, under CARs non-recreational pilots require a SFOC in order to operate (sections 602.41 and 603.66), while recreational users are required to operate in a way that is not likely to be hazardous to aviation safety (section 602.45).\n\nRPAS population estimates and forecast\n\nRPAS are a rapidly growing technology, therefore forecasting the RPAS population in Canada involves considerable uncertainty. Indeed, many of the uses for this technology have yet to be discovered or commercialized. For these reasons, the analysis includes three different RPAS population growth scenarios: low, base, and high. These follow the three scenarios developed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) latest forecast publication. The cost-benefit analysis assumes that Canada’s RPAS population reflects its total population relative to the U.S., which stood at 11% in 2017.\n\nIn all three RPAS population scenarios, the initial growth continues to be rapid in the near term before slowing down in the outer years of the forecast (following a typical trajectory for emerging technologies). The base-case forecast scenario has the RPAS population growing threefold between 2017 and 2029, from 133 100 units to 406 200 units (see Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Canada’s RPAS population (Thousands of RPAS units weighing between 250 g to 25 kg)\n\nSources: Transport Canada using U.S. FAA estimates.\n\nThe majority of RPAS are used recreationally, with the non-recreational share accounting for only 9.1% of the RPAS population in 2018 according to the FAA. However, non-recreational RPAS are at an earlier stage of adoption and are therefore expected to experience a faster rate of growth than recreational users. As a result, the non-recreational share is expected to grow to 27% of the RPAS population by 2029.\n\nTransport Canada made assumptions regarding the distribution of RPAS conducting basic and advanced operations based on its expert knowledge of the industry and consultations with stakeholders. Both basic and advanced categories are assumed to grow in tandem, although the majority of RPAS (almost three quarters of the total) are operated in basic environments (i.e. away from people and outside of controlled airspace).\n\nBenefits\n\nThe amendments will bring public and aviation safety benefits as well as cost savings and operations consistency to businesses and government.\n\nPublic safety benefits\n\nThe amendments will ensure RPAS pilots are competent and knowledgeable about the capabilities of their equipment as well as the scope of permissible use and the legal limitations placed on their use. Proper use of this equipment would reduce the likelihood of an RPA colliding with individuals on the ground or interfering with aircraft in flight.\n\nThere have been several incidents in Canada where RPA have collided with and injured bystanders in parks and other public areas. These incidents often go unreported so we do not know the full extent of the incidents. There has been one reported injury to Transport Canada each year during the last three years. Assuming the same ratio of reported injuries per RPAS population holds over the next decade, a conservative estimate would be that 28 such incidents would be reported in Canada during 2019 to 2029. We assume that all 28 incidents would be avoided due to safer operations. This is a conservative estimate because we are only assuming a reduction in injuries that are reported, when in reality these Regulations may prevent more injuries. The present value of the avoided injuries using this approach is estimated to be $12 million over the forecast period, or an annualized average of $1.6 million.\n\nRPA also pose risks to aviation safety when they are flown recklessly in controlled airspace or flown in a flight path. The extent of the damage is dependent on the RPA’s kinetic energy, structure, shape, materials, and other factors. Engineering simulations have demonstrated that airborne collisions may result in high damage to aircraft. There have been several RPA collisions around the world including in Canada, but none that have resulted in severe damage or fatalities as of yet. However, reports of near-misses and other RPAS interference are rising in Canada, indicating an increasing risk to aviation safety. The number of RPAS safety incidents has risen from 41 in 2014 to 136 in 2017; most of these incidents involve RPAS in controlled airspace, but there have also been serious incidents involving collisions with aircraft and individuals on the ground. In the absence of the Regulations, and applying the 2017 ratio of incidents to the RPAS population, the number of incidents would grow to more than 400 by 2029 without policy or regulatory intervention. The amendments’ benefits to aviation safety have not been monetized in the cost-benefit analysis.\n\nElimination of burden for non-recreational operators\n\nThe Regulations will improve the process that non-recreational RPAS pilots go through in order to legitimately fly their RPAS. The new process eliminates the need for SFOC applications for around 80% of RPAS flights, with many done on a case-by-case basis. The average time spent completing SFOC applications including communications with the government inspectors processing them is 27.3 hours, and applications are done by the company’s management.\n\nThese benefits are estimated by forecasting the number of SFOC that will be eliminated over the next decade based on the projected growth of non-recreational RPAS, then quantifying the time-cost savings. The present value of these savings for non-recreational pilots is estimated to be about $107.7 million over 2019–2029, or an annualized average of $14.4 million.\n\nFewer SFOC applications would also result in government savings of $24.9 million (present value), since inspectors will no longer be required to process the SFOC submissions for RPAS activities captured within these Regulations.\n\nThe elimination of SFOC for many operations will also provide some predictability for non-recreational RPAS operators, which has not been monetized in this analysis. There is currently a backlog of SFOC applications and a 20-day service standard, resulting in lost opportunities for operators who are not granted SFOC in time for their flights. Moving away from the case-by-case approach will provide regulatory consistency and allow non-recreational pilots to more easily make long-term plans and commitments.\n\nReducing the number or operations that would require SFOC is not expected to increase the risk to public or aviation safety because the knowledge base of these operators will not be affected. Non-recreational operators are currently demonstrating their knowledge through the SFOC process, but under the new requirements they will demonstrate this knowledge through testing and certification requirements. It is the mechanism that will change, not the knowledge base itself.\n\nCosts\n\nCompliance with the requirements will result in incremental costs to non-recreational pilots and training providers, recreational pilots, Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and to the Government of Canada, totalling $172.9 million over 2018–2029 (present value).\n\nThe pilot and the procedures\n\nThe RPAS population forecast underpins the cost estimates for pilots over the next decade, with some additional assumptions built into the analysis (see Table 2). RPAS pilots will face incremental fee and time costs under the new Regulations. A summary of these costs can be found in Table 3.\n\nTaken together, present value costs to non-recreational pilots and training providers are estimated to be $36.1 million over the next decade, and $134.8 million for recreational pilots.\n\nThe product\n\nRPAS manufacturers will incur upfront and ongoing costs to comply with the safety requirements of the amendments. Incremental costs include familiarizing themselves with the requirements, documenting the safety standard for the buyer, and self-declaring to Transport Canada using a one-page form (see Table 4). Transport Canada’s RPAS Taskforce experts recognize that Canadian manufacturers are already conducting safety tests in the absence of regulations and therefore testing costs are built into the baseline scenario. There are currently 11 Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and this number is expected to grow at the same growth rate as RPAS units in Canada, topping 25 manufacturers by 2029 in the central scenario. Manufacturers are expected to incur $336,050 in incremental costs over the next decade, or an annualized average of $44,810.\n\nSource: Transport Canada’s RPAS Taskforce.\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment costs include enforcement, promotion and awareness of the Regulations, the Information Management System (IMS or “Drone Management Portal,” which will host all of the registration, testing, and certification activities and records), and the general administration of the program. Together, the present value of these government costs over the next decade totals $19.2 million, or an annualized average of $2.6 million.\n\nTransport Canada will collect user fees for all registration, knowledge exam, and certificate issuing activities. These services are considered a private benefit to RPAS owners and pilots, therefore, program costs will be shared between Transport Canada and RPAS pilots. Transport Canada will cover 100% of promotion, enforcement, and all other government expenses. When taking these user fee revenues into account, the net cost to government is $1.7 million over the decade or an annualized average of $229,500.\n\nBenefits and costs summary\n\nTable 5: Consolidated cost-benefit statement\n\nPresent Value Base Year\n\nPrice Year\n\nPeriod of Analysis\n\nDiscount Rate\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nTotal Net Benefit\n\n(Present Value)\n\nLower Bound\n\nUpper Bound\n\n2018\n\n$CAN 2018\n\n2018–2029\n\n7%\n\n(178,279,952)\n\n34,460,674\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nThe cost-benefit analysis uses multiple scenarios and probability distributions to capture the many possibilities emerging technology may present over the next decade. Sensitivity tests were used to establish a range of outcomes, using both univariate (“tornado”) analysis and multivariate analysis of distributional functions (with simultaneous Monte Carlo simulations of 5 000 observations for all 30 distributions in the model). Combining the possibilities from both scenario and distributional analyses, the present value of net benefits ranges between −$178.3 million and +$34.5 million (over 2018–2029, discounted at 7%). Holding the central scenarios constant, the probability that the Regulations will lead to a net present value greater than zero is around 20%, although some expected benefits could not be monetized.\n\nThe choice of RPAS population growth scenario has the largest impact on net benefits, while the distribution of the “RPAS per recreational pilot” and “number of flights taken by recreational pilots each year” assumptions have the highest impacts on overall variation out of the 30 distributions included in the cost-benefit model.\n\nDistributional analyses\n\nNon-recreational pilots are expected to accrue a net benefit of $226 per pilot compared to recreational pilots who are expected to incur a net cost of $83 per pilot under the policy scenario. Although non-recreational RPAS pilots are expected to incur higher costs ($161 per pilot) than recreational RPAS pilots ($83 per pilot), they will also accrue a higher quantified benefit ($387 per pilot) compared to recreational pilots ($0) due to the elimination of the SFOC requirements, which only affect non-recreational pilots.\n\nNon-recreational pilots in Quebec and Ontario are expected to accrue the highest total net benefits due to heightened non-recreational RPAS activity in those regions (regional distributions are based on 2016 and 2017 SFOC applications for RPAS operations, see Chart 2).\n\nChart 2: Non-recreational pilots’ net benefits, regional distribution\n\n($ millions; present value of net benefit in $2018 over 2018–2029, discounted 7%)\n\nSource: Transport Canada\n\nManufacturers’ costs are assumed to coincide with where they are located. Currently, 6 out of 11 Canadian RPAS manufacturers are based out of Ontario, with 4 in the Prairies and one in Quebec.\n\n“One-for-One” Rule\n\nThe “One-for-One” Rule applies and is a net OUT due to the removal of the requirement for SFOC (OUT) and replacing that with less costly administrate burden requirements (IN). The net change in annualized administrative activities is a savings of $5,838,321 or $350 per business (expressed in $2012, calculated over 2018–2028, and discounted 7% as required by the Treasury Board’s “One-for-One” Rule guide).\n\nApproximately 70% of SFOC applications take one week to complete (by management), including the back-and-forth that occurs with the inspectors. Moreover, some companies must apply for several SFOC each year. Eliminating this requirement is expected to be a large timesaver for companies. To estimate the time savings, SFOC growth scenarios were forecasted using the growth rates of the number of non-recreational RPAS pilots over the next decade. (As explained in previous sections, these numbers are calculated using the ratio of 1.5 non-recreational pilots per non-recreational RPAS and applying it to the forecast for non-recreational RPAS, while taking into account pilot attrition. ) This is a relatively conservative growth rate because many pilots must currently apply for SFOC multiple times per year instead of just once per year as is the underlying assumption in this baseline-scenario SFOC forecast. Hence, the overall administrative burden savings estimate is itself conservative.\n\nThe largest administrative burdens that these amendments impose on non-recreational pilots (IN) are the requirements for pilots to write the knowledge exam (1 hr/new pilot) and to successfully complete a flight review for advanced operations (1 hr/new pilot). Other administrative burdens include familiarizing themselves with the new rules (5 min/new pilot), creating new GCKey and RPAS accounts (5 min/new pilot), registering all RPA (3 min/new RPA), and the flight reviewers’ knowledge exam (1 hr/new reviewer) and flight review (1 hr/new reviewer) for training providers who choose to have reviewer status. The administrative burden was forecasted using the expected growth of these components (i.e. the growth forecast for new non-recreational pilots, for new non-recreational RPAS), as described in previous sections, taking into account exam failure rates, attrition, and existing pilot-to-RPAS ratios.
