        "text": "Program Details:\n\nThis free, in-depth program, suitable for ages 10 and up, covers flight basics, maneuvers, and visual navigation through six 1-hour lessons, combining video and hands-on training. Students must watch the lesson tutorial video(s) prior to each session.\n\nFor entertainment purposes only. While this program offers valuable education and entertainment, it is not a substitute for official pilot certification. Those seeking a pilot certificate must attend a certified flight school. Many students have successfully transitioned to full flight training, finding the simulator experience beneficial.\n\nWhat is the minimum age for flight simulator lessons?\n\nThe minimum age is 10. The lessons require focus and concentration, so younger children who are easily distracted may struggle. It's best to wait until they’re older.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nIt’s FREE! This is another complimentary service from the Martin County Library System. Explore our website or ask library staff for more details on other free services.\n\nWhat is a Pilot ID and why is it needed?\n\nA Pilot ID ensures privacy by allowing us to communicate without using students' names. The pilot ID begins with the letter \"N\" and includes the birth month, day, and the pilot's initials (e.g., N0724AE for Amelia Earhart, born July 24).\n\nWhat should I know before starting?\n\nWatch the lesson tutorial video(s) before your lesson. This is mandatory and will maximize your flying time.\n\nHandle the equipment gently and enjoy the experience. It's for entertainment and learning, not stress.\n\nCan I fly a real plane after these lessons?\n\nNo. Our simulator program is educational and for entertainment only. It does not count towards FAA certification. For real flight training, you must attend a certified flight school. If a flight school instructor teaches you something that contradicts what you may learn here, listen to your flight school instructor.\n\nWhat if I need to miss a lesson?\n\nNotify both staff and your instructor if you can’t attend a lesson. Call (772) 463-3245 or email the Robert Morgade Library, and contact your instructor if they’ve provided their details."
