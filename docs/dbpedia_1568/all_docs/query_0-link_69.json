        "text": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have evolved rapidly over the past decade driven primarily by military uses, and have begun finding application among civilian users for earth sensing reconnaissance and scientific data collection purposes. Among UAS, promising characteristics are long flight duration, improved mission safety, flight repeatability due to improving autopilots, and reduced operational costs when compared to manned aircraft. The potential advantages of an unmanned platform, however, depend on many factors, such as aircraft, sensor types, mission objectives, and the current UAS regulatory requirements for operations of the particular platform. The regulations concerning UAS operation are still in the early development stages and currently present significant barriers to entry for scientific users. In this article we describe a variety of platforms, as well as sensor capabilities, and identify advantages of each as relevant to the demands of users in the scientific research sector. We also briefly discuss the current state of regulations affecting UAS operations, with the purpose of informing the scientific community about this developing technology whose potential for revolutionizing natural science observations is similar to those transformations that GIS and GPS brought to the community two decades ago.\n\nUAVs are part of common lexicon and very soon would be part of daily life. Till the very recent past, they flew in segregated airspace under the control of the military and for military tasks. As they proliferate in the 'civilian' domain, this essay looks at the immense challenges in integrating them in national airspace for unhindered everyday operations, like commercial aviation. As UCAVs mature in the coming years, integrating them would be an even bigger issue.\n\nThis paper describes the possibility of using a small autonomous helicopter to perform tasks using a remote sensing system. This article further shows the most effective way to properly set up autopilot and to process its validation during flight tests. The most important components of the remote sensing system are described and the possibilities of using this system to monitor gas transmission and distribution networks are presented.\n\nWidespread proliferation of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), particularly those used for hobby and recreational purposes, have become a growing problem for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in recent years. Reports of aircraft and sUAS near misses are on the rise and several similar anecdotes of ground injuries and property damage can be traced back to sUAS operations. This study sought to explore recent regulatory and policy initiatives in place to deter unsafe hobby and recreational sUAS use and hold operators accountable for hazardous sUAS activities. Using document analysis, case study, and conceptual analysis methodology, researchers analyzed 40 information sources. The study evaluated the FAAâ€™s sUAS registration policy, current agency civil enforcement guidance, and the potential for criminal prosecution or civil liability. The study specifically addresses the risk to pilots for certificate suspension or revocation and evaluates the applicability of the Aviation S...\n\nThis paper presents results of an exhaustive survey of commercially-applied drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) including a review of their applications, features, characteristics, and other information through a wealth of secondary data, particularly online records and documents consulted along with key-informant interviews. A simple descriptive-quantitative method was applied to treat the data. It was found that UAVs are now used in such areas as Agriculture, Real Estate, Film and TV, Oil and Gas, Construction, Fisheries, Wildlife Surveillance, Water Management and Security. Out of 30 sample applications documented, 23.33% are dedicated in providing support to public/civilian security. Agriculture, Photography and Wildlife Surveillance rank next with 16.67%. Three (3) or 10% were used in Real Estates; two (2) or 6.67% were for Fisheries; and one (1) or 3.33% were used each for Oil and Gas, Construction and Water Management. Fixed-winged UAVs are used for surveying and captur..."
