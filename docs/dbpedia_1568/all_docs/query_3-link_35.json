        "text": "VIRTUAL SIMULATIONS\n\nFORT INDIANTOWN GAP SIMULATIONS\n\nEngagement Skills Trainer (EST 2000) is a computer-based weapons trainer simulating weapons training events which can lead to collective live fire exercises and individual/crew served weapons qualification. This system is used primarily as indoor multipurpose, multilane, small arms, weapons training simulators with the following capabilities: (1) The EST 2000 is not a replacement for traditional live fire training, but training enhancers, which are economical to operate and capable of providing safe training regardless of weather.(2) The weapons used on these systems are not capable of firing live rounds, holding actual magazines or chambering live rounds, however, actual function and operation is the same as real weapons, to include amounts of ammunition that can be fired before reloading is required. This system is also capable of conducting limited visibility training, replicating various environmental conditions, and when appropriate the training can be escalated. (3) The EST 2000 has the capabilities to utilize a Close Combat Optic (CCO) and Backup Iron Sight (BIS) on select weapons.\n\nVIRTUAL CONVOY OPERATIONS TRAINER (VCOT)\n\nThe VCOT provides training for convoys under realistic conditions through various terrain databases. The VCOT assists in ensuring that soldiers are trained to anticipate/react to ambushes and other insurgent actions from all possible directions by allowing the crew to observe, maneuver, and fire their weapons through a full 360 degree circumference. Crewmembers are not limited by fixed screen projections; they have a complete and continuous view of the entire virtual world around them as they would under real combat conditions.\n\nThe VCOT is a medium-fidelity critical task trainer for convoy crew members. The system consists of HMMWV M1025 Truck crew trainers operating on a simulated battlefield to support crew gunnery and convoy operations training. Each vehicle simulator consists of one each driver, gunner and vehicle commander stations.\n\nDriver and gunner crew stations are simulated. The driver station provides a view of the virtual battlefield using three 17” flat panel displays. The driver station provides realistic controls for steering, transmission gear selection, brake and accelerator pedals, and parking brake for control of the vehicle during exercises. The gunner station consists of a ring-mounted .50 cal Heavy barrel Machine Gun. The gunner views the battlefield through a helmet-mounted display. Each vehicle consists of radio equipment to conduct proper command and control during an exercise.\n\nThe AAR station is equipped with the tools necessary to conduct a mission brief and full scenario playback including audio. At any time during an exercise or an AAR the point of view can be changed from tethering a certain vehicle or to a “bird’s eye view”.\n\nThe VCOT has four gunner stations, in which two of them double as Individual Gunnery Trainer (IGT) stations. The purpose of an IGT is to train Warfighters in proficiency of un-stabilized gunnery. It follows the training guidelines established in the HBCT and CSS gunnery manuals. The VCOT is one of the approved primary simulators for Mounted Machine Gun (MMG) Direct Fire Gunnery table II IAW TC 3-20.31. The IGT supports training on and the sustainment of individual gunnery skills for employing the M2 .50 Cal machine gun, the MK19 Grenade launcher and the M240B machine Gun from the gunner’s position on a HMMWV.\n\nBack to the top\n\nOPERATOR DRIVER SIMULATOR (ODS)\n\nThe Operator Driver Simulator is a high fidelity immersive technical skills trainer for teaching soldiers how to safely drive vehicles in the army inventory. The ODS provides realistic tactile / haptic feedback to the student through the steering wheel, pedals and dashboard controls that replicate the experience of driving the actual respective vehicle.
