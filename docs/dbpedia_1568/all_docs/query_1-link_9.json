        "text": "Aim\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you should be able to correctly:\n\nIdentify and described the purpose of various features of a remote pilot station:\n\ntransmitter\n\ncommand and control link\n\nflight controls\n\nother controls\n\nantennas/aerials\n\nsoftware, including firmware and updates\n\ntelemetry\n\nnon-payload communications\n\npower supply\n\nThe Remote Pilot Station\n\nRemember – there is no such thing as a fully autonomous aircraft.\n\nSuch an aircraft would not require any human intervention at all to plan and execute a mission.\n\nAircraft that do require some form of human intervention must be able to communicate with the human – hence the need for a data link.\n\nMost smaller unmanned aircraft have more than one form of data link operating simultaneously – each with its own dedicated function.\n\nCommon Components of the Remote Pilot (or Ground Control) Station typically include the following:\n\n1x Ground Control Station (GCS) Computer/Laptop\n\n1x Radio Control Transmitter (2x required if using a buddy box setup)\n\n1x Radio telemetry – used for datalink between aircraft and GCS\n\nCommand & Control Link\n\nA control link is responsible for sending signals from the remote pilot or GCS to the aircraft in order to directly govern the operation of the aircraft.\n\nFeedback signals travel from the aircraft to the GCS to provide location, status, reports and warnings.\n\nAuxiliary functions are controlled from the GCS. (Lights/sirens/dropping devices/cameras).\n\nExamples of command & control links are:\n\nLink between the aircraft and GCS;\n\nLink between the aircraft and pilot’s manual remote control via Radio Transmitter; or\n\nA long-range link with GCS via a 5G data-link.\n\nNote: A stable link between the aircraft and remote pilot station is critical for safe operation.\n\nExample of flight critical feedback from a Command & Control Link is the Primary Flight Display (PFD), which shows in-flight information, such as:\n\nAltitude Indicator\n\nAirspeed Indicator (ASI)\n\nGround Speed (GS)\n\nVertical Speed Indicator (VSI)\n\nTransmitter\n\nThere are several commercially available radio transmitter. These commonly have two (2) stick for the pilot’s flight control inputs,\n\nalong with a number of toggle switches for additional control inputs, such as:\n\nFlight modes\n\nLanding gears\n\nFlaps\n\nCommercial RC Transmitters may have different stick layouts. Diagrams below show a Mode 1 and Mode 2 stick layout, which inter-changes pitch and throttle.\n\nFlight Controls\n\nMode 2 more closely resembles manned aircraft controls, which typically has pitch and roll on the same stick. Below is a diagram illustrates stick input with relation to a fixed-wing control.\n\nOther Controls\n\nIn addition to flight controls, other optional controls can be added, as dependant on aircraft configuration. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nFlaps\n\nLanding Gears\n\nCamera or payload Control\n\nThese additional controls can be configured on as switches on the transmitter or sent as commands directly from the GCS software.\n\nAntennas & Aerials\n\nSignal Strength & Directionality\n\nThe maximum power we can use to communicate with an unmanned aircraft is set by regulation – we have no choice with this. (Antennae gain is also factored into the regulations!)\n\nSignal strength (received) is NOT just a function of transmitted power – antennae type (including directionality) also has a significant influence on received signal strength – in terms of both the transmitter and the receiver requirements!\n\nTypes of Antennas\n\nAntennas used in commercial UAVs are typically omnidirectional, which is\n\nDipole Waveform:\n\nCommon frequencies are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz\n\nCommon wave lengths are:\n\nquarter-wave (¼)\n\nhalf-wave (½)\n\nfull-wave\n\nA Directional Antenna configurations are a series (or array) of dipole antenna, which are arranged in a way that propagates waves in a specific direction.\n\nSoftware, Firmware, & Updates\n\nSoftware\n\n“Software” typically refers to the off-board program used to operate and monitor the aircraft from a remote station (Ground Control Station Software).\n\nThe main functions of a GCS Software is:\n\nTo providing data, status and diagnostic feedback of the aircraft,\n\nTo allow for control of aircraft state (ARMED or DISARMED), and\n\nTo facilitate pre-flight planning\n\nThis is typically off-board, on the GCS, or an app on a mobile device used to connect with the aircraft.\n\nFirmware\n\n“Firmware” typically refers to the on-board program and flight-critical component, which governs the aircraft’s low-level control functions.\n\nThe on-board firmware interprets these control inputs send from the remote pilot station. The firmware then execute the appropriate flight control surfaces and/or throttle response to achieve the desired control inputs.\n\nExamples below illustrates throttle control of individual motors on a Quad Multirotor configuration, which is typically governed by the on-board firmware.\n\nUpdates\n\nSoftware and firmware versioning are typically shown with three (3) or more numbers.\n\nExamples: v3.0.13\n\nThe first no. indicates major changes to the software;\n\nThe second no. indicates minor changes to the software;\n\nThe third no. indicates patches to the software, typically for fixes to existing bugs.\n\nUpdates are a method for users to load new software or firmware onto our system:\n\nSoftware updates can usually be ran “in-place” without special considerations\n\nFirmware updates usually must be carefully selected as they influence the flight critical performance of the system\n\nKey reasons to update are:\n\nTo maintain software integrity, which may be affected by changes made to the computer’s operating system and/or hardware;\n\nTo maintain software integrity against new or pre-existing software/firmware bugs;\n\nTo maintain hardware compatibility with newer aircraft components and designs; and\n\nTo generally to acquire newer features added by the software developer\n\nTelemetry\n\nTelemetry in the context of UAV operations, is the transfer or communication of data to and from remote points in a field. Telemetry is typically attached to the Ground Control Station, and the aircraft, to allow for communication between the two.\n\nWhat sort of information do you think can be transmitted?\n\nThe cases where telemetry is unreliable:\n\nOnly shows state of the aircraft at the specific time when it is sent\n\nCan be slow (low data rate) depending on link quality\n\nMight disconnect (if radio link disconnects)\n\nPayload Communications\n\nSimilar to Command & Control Links, Payloads can be communicated via:\n\nRadio\n\nCellular\n\nSatellite\n\nPayload communication could be:\n\n“on-line”: meaning information is updated in real time to the GCS; or\n\n“off-line”: meaning information is stored securely on-board a payload system for later retrieval.\n\nExamples of payload communications:\n\nSecure Integrated Airspace Management (SIAM): event data sent via LTE\n\nSurvey camera: photos stored to SD card during flight\n\nPower Supply\n\nOn-site operations:\n\nPower supplied by grid network; or\n\nUninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)\n\nOff-site operations:\n\nBattery banks\n\nGenerators\n\nBattery charging stations are usually set up to ensure continuous operations during extended flight day"
