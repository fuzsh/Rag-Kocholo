UAS provide quick, easy, and cost-effective insights, on demand.\n\nThe applications for UAS vary widely, but can be used to capture high-resolution imagery and video that give scientists and first responders a new perspective and important information that supports data-driven, real-time decision making.\n\nApplications of UAS at Ecology\n\nAerial photography/videography\n\nCoastal erosion monitoring\n\nSpill response/emergency response\n\nMapping and site inspections\n\nStructure-from-motion modeling\n\nLidar (Light detection and ranging)\n\nTemporal change monitoring\n\nAir and water quality surveys\n\nCommunications products and storytelling\n\nBenefits of using UAS for environmental work\n\nIncreased safety and reduced risk for our staff.\n\nScale of the landscape to be surveyed exceeds the capacity of staff and/or conventional aircraft.\n\nThe above-ground-level operational requirements exceed the safe operation limits of conventional aircraft.\n\nSurvey equipment, such as cameras, video cameras, infrared cameras, radar, sonar, and Lidar, are best deployed using these vehicles.\n\nManned aircraft are usually unavailable and not cost effective\n\nProjects\n\nWe fill out a project checklist every time we use UAS to support our work. Below is a list of all approved projects."
