        "text": "Drone Definition\n\nA drone, also called an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is a broad term that refers to an aircraft that operates autonomously or by remote control, with no pilot on board. Drones are usually small-or-medium-sized, and these ‘flying robots’ can carry out a wide range of tasks, from stealth military operations to package delivery to aerial photography.\n\nUAV Meaning\n\nAnother name for drones is unmanned aerial vehicle, which is an aircraft that doesn’t require a pilot to be physically onboard. UAVs are often separated into two categories — civilian and military. While civilian UAVs are used for package deliveries and recreation, military drones are used for reconnaissance missions and aerial combat.\n\nWhat Are Drones Used For?\n\nDrone technology has become a greater part of everyday life due to its increasing complexity. Here are a few ways drones are used today.\n\nPhotography and Videography\n\nDrones have been a boon for photographers who use UAVs to take expansive aerial photos. There are drones made specifically for photography that provide a new way to photograph some of your favorite city skyline, beach or building from high above. Drones can also be used to record videos for sporting events, films and virtual real estate tours, providing footage from unprecedented vantage points to enhance the viewing experience.\n\nDelivery Services\n\nDelivery drones are UAVs used to transport food, packages or goods to your front doorstep. These flying vehicles are known as “last mile” delivery drones because they are used to make deliveries from stores or warehouses close by. Retailers and grocery chains all over the country are turning to drones as a more efficient delivery alternative, instead of relying on delivery drivers with inefficient trucks.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSometimes it’s not safe enough to send humans into a rescue situation, due to the scope or severity of the disaster. That’s where drones come in. In the case of a capsized boat or drowning individual, officials can throw an autonomous underwater vehicle into the water to assist in the rescue. If there’s an avalanche, drones are deployed to look for those caught in the snow.\n\nAgriculture\n\nDrones have proven to be beneficial to the agriculture industry as well, presenting farmers with several ways to optimize their farms to maximize efficiency and reduce physical strain. Carrying out field surveys, seeding over fields, tracking livestock and estimating crop yield are all made easier through the use of UAVs while saving agriculture professionals valuable time.\n\nSurveillance\n\nBoth local law enforcement and military personnel can operate more effectively with the help of drones. Police can use drones to monitor events, record and preserve video evidence of traffic violations and recreate crime scenes through mapping analysis. Meanwhile, military personnel can apply drone technology to track enemy soldiers’ locations, conducting more focused attacks and refining their strategies.\n\nPersonal Use\n\nThanks to lower costs, drones are much more accessible to the average consumer. Anyone can use drones for recreational use, like taking pictures for personal use or practicing flying a drone in a park. In addition, pilots must follow recreational regulations and ensure they have any required certifications before flying a drone for fun.\n\nWildlife Monitoring\n\nDrones are a cheaper and more efficient alternative to wildlife conservation. Tracking wildlife populations is nearly impossible with humans on the ground. Having an eye-in-the-sky allows wildlife conservationists to track roaming groups of animals and get a better idea of the health of their species and ecosystems. Drones are also being used for reforestation efforts all over the world.\n\n3D Modeling\n\nLiDAR drones come outfitted with LiDAR sensors, which survey landscapes and compile in-depth data that can be used to build 3D models. Drones equipped with LiDAR can present far more accurate data than drones without the technology.\n\nMilitary Operations\n\nThe British and U.S. militaries started using very basic forms of drones in the early 1940s to spy on enemies. Today’s drones are much more advanced than the UAVs of yesteryear, equipped with thermal imaging, laser range finders and even tools to perform airstrikes.\n\nTypes of Drones\n\nThere are several different types of drones, each tailored to the unique demands of different industries. For instance, some people require lightweight drones to hold a camera for photography, while others need robust drones to transport heavy medical supplies.\n\nMulti-Rotor Drones\n\nMulti-rotor drones have several propellers that push wind downward to vertically lift off the ground. Multi-rotor drones are probably the most accessible drones available to the public, since they are easy to control and maneuver during flight. Some multi-rotor drones are ideal for beginner pilots as well, leading to them being an affordable option in the drone market.\n\nSingle-Rotor Drones\n\nSingle-rotor drones look like tiny helicopters, with one central propeller attached to its frame. They can be powered by gas or electricity, and are usually used to transport heavier objects, including LiDAR systems, that can be used to survey land, research storms and map erosion caused by global warming.\n\nFixed-Wing Drones\n\nFixed-wing drones look like normal airplanes, where the wings provide the lift instead of rotors. Since these drones are usually much larger, they need to take off and land on runways just as airplanes do. Fixed-wing UAVs are used by the military to carry out strikes, by scientists to carry large amounts of equipment and even by nonprofits to deliver food and other goods to areas that are hard to reach.\n\nFixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL Drones\n\nFixed-wing hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drones blend the best of fixed-wing and rotary drone models — they can take off and land vertically but then fly horizontally. Companies take advantage of this combination, relying on fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones to further cut down on delivery times while offering a more versatile flight experience.\n\nOther Common Types of Drones\n\nDrones companies have responded to the demand for drones in specific sectors as well. Below are some more popular types of drone technology designed for various scenarios:\n\nUnderwater remotely operated vehicles\n\nCombat drones\n\nDelivery drones\n\nGPS drones\n\nEndurance drones\n\nRacing drones\n\nReconnaissance drones\n\nToy drones\n\nHow Do Drones Work?\n\nIn order to fly, drones rely on a combination of hardware and software components. They are often equipped with rotors, propellers or fixed wings, sensors and cameras, navigation systems (GPS) and gyroscopes for stability."
