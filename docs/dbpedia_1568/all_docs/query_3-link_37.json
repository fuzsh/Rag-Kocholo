        "text": "Course Overview\n\nSimulation plays a critical role in providing opportunities for students and trainees to learn and practice skills in safe environments without concerns about harming patients. Teaching using simulation is most effective when based on established principles as highlighted in the 4-day course, ACS Simulation in Surgical Education, offered by the ACS Division of Education. Course participants will learn to use simulation to teach and refine essential surgical skills. Fundamentals of surgical simulation will be introduced through interactive lectures and discussions. Hands-on training will be provided with various types of simulators, followed by practical experience using simulation to teach and assess medical students. Topics will include simulation-based training and deliberate practice, types of simulators and simulations, with an emphasis on feedback and debriefing. Hands-on experiences will use modules from the ACS/ASE Medical Student Simulation-Based Surgical Skills curriculum; other curricula and resources will be discussed.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nMany simulation centers find it challenging to secure expert faculty who are able and willing to teach using simulation. This course would be especially valuable to faculty who are already involved or want to be involved and will train a cadre of surgeons who could assist in teaching and assessing the skills of residents and medical students. No previous experience with simulation is necessary. Surgeons who are stepping away from clinical duties, nearing retirement, or in retirement and want to remain engaged and share their expertise with the next generation of surgeons are especially encouraged to apply. Training will specifically focus on fundamental skills applicable to all surgical specialties.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUpon completion of this course, participants should be able to:\n\nDescribe the fundamentals of surgical simulation\n\nIdentify simulation resources for competency-based training and assessment\n\nUse simulation to teach and assess technical skills of medical students\n\nHow to effectively provide feedback and debrief\n\nEnrollment\n\nThe course is limited to 36 participants. Letters of notification regarding acceptance to the course will be emailed by September 24, 2024.\n\nCourse Faculty\n\nRanjan Sudan, MD, MBBS, FACS | Course Chair\n\nDr. Sudan is a professor of surgery and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.
