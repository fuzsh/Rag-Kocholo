Digital technologies – from simulation to virtual and mixed reality, digital twins and wargaming – enable the design of infinite prototypes and configurations. They also reduce the costs of traditional training systems and make it possible to replicate scenarios that are difficult to achieve ‘live’, while at the same time enhancing safety.",

        "text": "The progressive development of digital technologies has increased the amount of data and information available to us, enabling people to expand their knowledge and establish more and faster connections with the world around them. This change also affects businesses, particularly those that can extract value from data to exploit its full potential.\n\nLeonardo has embarked on this path by developing innovative digital solutions in simulation, training and related services. The company has longstanding experience in this field, which has evolved over time with the development of simulators increasingly focused on the new dimension of virtual and augmented reality.\n\nHow the sector is evolving\n\nTraining requirements are increasingly shifting towards the extensive use of Virtual & Constructive simulation complemented by traditional live training systems. This supports not just environmental and economic sustainability but also embraces the increased training effectiveness offered by new technological solutions. Live training alone cannot prepare operational personnel to deal with complex situations in extreme conditions. There is therefore a growing requirement for simulated, multi-domain (land, naval, air, space and cyber) inter-force scenarios that also involve non-cooperating or hostile elements.\n\nBesides increasing operators’ skill levels and the range of scenarios for which they can be trained, using flight simulators reduces live flying hours, positively impacting costs and environmental and noise pollution. Virtual and augmented reality technologies, combined with artificial intelligence, are also used for maintenance and predictive maintenance, helping to prevent and identify faults and inefficiencies.\n\nTraining, therefore, is a strategic sector for Leonardo, in line with ever-increasing and more advanced market demands. By leveraging the new technologies available, the company has created numerous training paths to increase or update the skills of its in-house professionals and of those operating its systems, solutions and technologies. In the rotary-wing sector, the company has developed a network of Training Academies (Italy, UK, USA, Poland, Malaysia) to train pilots, maintenance technicians and rear crew; it has established the Cyber & Security Academy and the Electronic Warfare Academy for cybersecurity and electronic systems professionals; and it has also created the International Flight Training School (IFTS) in partnership with the Italian Air Force. More recently, Leonardo has introduced the first integrated training capabilities for maintenance personnel of fixed-wing, rotary-wing and remotely piloted military aircraft and related systems.\n\nA new training model\n\nAt the IFTS, a centre of excellence for training military pilots from around the world, the training systems are based on the M-346 Integrated Training System. This system features platforms equipped with the Embedded Tactical Training System (ETTS), which enables aircraft to emulate sensors, weapons and CGFs (Computer Generated Forces). Pilots can operate collaboratively in LVC (Live, Virtual, Constructive) mode, as well as integrating the Ground Based Training System (GBTS), comprising various flight and mission simulation systems. In addition, the training system features multimedia courses, mission planning and training management systems, and the Integrated Logistics System (ILS). This integrated logistics service optimises the management of fleets and simulators for maximum operability.\n\nEmploying digital technologies developed using the enormous computing power of the davinci-1 supercomputer, new algorithms, and artificial intelligence – increasingly influential in this field – it is possible to plan all types of missions and in-flight situations.\n\nThis is the essence of a new training model, which takes training capabilities to an even higher level, confirming Leonardo’s desire to strengthen its competitive positioning in the advanced training sector as a comprehensive Training Services Provider.\n\nTowards the cockpit of the future\n\nThe present and future of training come together in Leonardo’s Battle Lab, the Turin-based laboratory that studies and evaluates sixth-generation air combat system concepts. The Battle Lab has a digital maxi video wall, which recreates a multi-domain scenario (with the faithful reproduction of air, naval, land and electronic warfare systems); the Smart Chair – a workstation that recreates the cockpit in which pilots could fly from 2035; and a Prototyping Pilot Station – a powered mock-up of an interactive cockpit derived from the M-346 concept. It includes a Large Area Display in which the capabilities and interfaces developed with the Smart Chair and selected in collaboration with the pilots are transferred and reproduced.\n\nThe Smart chair in the Battle Lab\n\nIn this way it is possible to manage the development of the cockpit of the future by combining the physical and virtual worlds, leaving the pilot to physically handle only the stick and throttle. Everything else is virtual, ‘augmented’ and immersive, from eye movement commands to digitised touch buttons, with full integration into the scenario depicted on the video wall.\n\nThis new environment will facilitate the transition to multi-domain scenarios based on sixth-generation air combat platforms, with a focus on relevant technologies such as artificial intelligence, flight and mission autonomy, and crewed-uncrewed teaming, of which the Global Combat Air Programme represents one of the most innovative international cooperative efforts."
