        "text": "The unmanned aerial systems, UAS, concentration, under the B.S. in aeronautical management technology, prepares students for careers in the rapidly growing area of UAS, including operations, remote sensing, data collection and analysis.\n\nWhy Unmanned Aerial Systems?\n\nThe concentration incorporates all aviation management technology core courses, as well as UAS concentration courses. This provides an overview of UAS operations followed by detailed knowledge of UAS-specific systems and technology (ground control stations, data links; flight planning and operations, search, detect and avoid technologies; and payloads) and UAS sensor operations. A critical aspect of this academic area of study is the data capture and transfer of the sensor information collected from the unmanned aerial vehicle. This innovative concentration brings together the most up-to-date and relevant aspects facing multiple industries today by addressing flight system planning and operations and the employment of the systems in the congested National Air Space.\n\nFor complete program information, required classes and other details, see the major map.\n\nRequirements\n\nAdditional Program Fee: No\n\nSecond Language Requirement: No\n\nMAT 265 – Calculus for Engineers I.\n\nCareer Outlook\n\nStudents graduating from this program will find various employment opportunities as unmanned aerial vehicle pilots and sensor operators in both the U.S. and worldwide. In 2015, the FAA will allow UAV to operate in the U.S. National Airspace System that will enable governmental and civilian entities to operate these vehicles for new endeavors or to replace current fixed- and rotor-craft operations. This concentration will prepare students to operate small to mid-range platforms that will be used by emergency responders, forestry, agriculture, energy and oil, and other similar industries. Entry-level pay is competitive for this highly specialized field.\n\nExample Careers\n\nLogistics Managers\n\nStorage and Distribution Managers\n\nTransportation Managers\n\nProgram Mission Statement\n\nUnmanned Aerial Systems\n\nAccelerated Master’s Degree option"
