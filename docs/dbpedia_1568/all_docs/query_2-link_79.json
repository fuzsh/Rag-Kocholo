        "text": "Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are widely used for transportation, recognition, cartography, or inspection. A reliable function of onboard systems and compliance with all relevant drone legislation in your target market are crucial for an autonomous flight and mission success.\n\nThe technical complexity of UAVs requires efficient means to transition from desktop simulation to automated hardware testing.\n\nRapid Control Prototyping enables you to test your Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) at an early design stage without risking a crash and time-consuming repairs of your drone model. Hardware-in-the-Loop testing allows you to perform real-time tests of the flight controller in simulated missions and even help you achieve certification despite the progressively strict regulations."
