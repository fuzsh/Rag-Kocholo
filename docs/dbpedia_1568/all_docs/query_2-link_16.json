        "text": "Students working toward this specialization will examine entire unmanned aircraft systems. Courses highlight specific characteristics of different aircraftt, how they are built and fundamentals of control and propulsion systems. Students will explore how UAS integrate into the larger aviation system, including safety policies and regulations and automation procedures. Currently, new possibilities for unmanned aircraft are in use for agricultural, scientific and military purposes.\n\nThere are quickly growing commercial markets for UAS applications, range from expedited package delivery to precision agriculture. The commercial potential for unmanned aaircraft system applications has only just begun to be imagined, including:\n\nAerial/field mapping (GIS)\n\nAgriculture/crop scouting, irrigation/fertilization\n\nDisaster and emergency management\n\nEnvironmental research\n\nLaw enforcement/Fire Service\n\nPhotogrammetry (crime scene preservation)\n\nParcel delivery\n\nPhotography/videography\n\nRequired Courses for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Certificate of Specialization (PDF)\n\nUAS Instructor Contact Information:"
