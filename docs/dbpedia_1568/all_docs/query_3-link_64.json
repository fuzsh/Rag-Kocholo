The focus of our role as lead of Dstl’s SERAPIS Simulation and Synthetic Environments (SSE) is identifying and exploiting over-the-horizon technologies. Under phase two of the Army’s Virtual Reality In-Land Training Pilot, we are generating quantifiable evidence, insights and experimental data relating to the potential of VR systems to support the Field Army Battle Craft Syllabus.\n\nOur mix of military experience, technical skills and ability to tailor technology’s use is key in enabling us to meet customer requirements; we have an intimate understanding of the Services and the technical science needed to meet their training objectives."
