        "text": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer great advantages for both military and civilian applications due to their potential to execute missions in hazardous scenarios involving operation in bad weather conditions or near to buildings, trees, civil infrastructures, and other obstacles. Inspired from the biological insights about the incredible abilities of social insects to solve the complicated problems, many bio-inspired computation algorithms have been developed by simulating the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized system in nature. The main objectives pursued have been on addressing the question of how to achieve higher autonomous capability by taking advantage of bio-inspired computation. This chapter mainly focuses on the fundamental concepts of UAVs and bio-inspired computation algorithms as well as bio-inspired intelligence in UAVs. After a brief introduction to the history of UAVs, autonomous capability of UAVs is discussed from the perspective of functional description, metrics of autonomy. Then the general features of bio-inspired computation and four representative bio-inspired algorithms are presented, which are, respectively, ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and differential evolution (DE). Finally, a comprehensive review of bio-inspired intelligence in UAVs and the structure of this monograph are provided."
