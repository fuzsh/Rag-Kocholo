        "text": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), also known as ‘Drones,’ have made their way into product delivery, surveillance, aerial photography and videography, agriculture, drone racing, geographical explorations, wildfire mapping, and more. Today, they remain one of the most exciting and emerging areas in modern tech.\n\nThe increase in production of unmanned systems will create additional revenue totaling more than $82 billion in economic impact from 2015-2025.\n\nConsidering the ever-increasing demand for professionals in this field, colleges across the United States are now offering educational programs ranging from associates to full-fledged doctoral degrees.\n\nA formal education program in unmanned aerial systems can help you achieve high-paying roles like UAV pilots, design and operations of unmanned systems, military drone pilots, and research.\n\nIf you’re excited about building cutting-edge technology, robotic flying machines, and remotely-operated autonomous systems engineering, a professional degree can give flight to your career.\n\nIn this article, we’ll be looking at some of the top colleges in the country that offer programs in unmanned aircraft systems operations, design, and allied domains. Please note that this list is not based on any ranking criteria.\n\nAccredited vs. Non-Accredited Drone Colleges\n\nTo operate a drone under the Small UAS Rule (Part 107) of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), you must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. This certificate establishes that you comprehend the guidelines, understand the procedures for flying drones safely as well as their operating requirements.\n\nCurrently, only 41 schools across the US are a part of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Collegiate Training Initiative (UAS-CTI), an initiative organized by the FAA.\n\nSome non-accredited drone colleges may cost less than accredited schools. While that should not be a deciding criterion alone, you will incur higher expenses if you have to relocate to a place for an FAA-accredited school.\n\nIf your geographical location and costs are concerning, you can compliment non-accredited colleges with the mandatory Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA.\n\nAccredited and non-accredited colleges across the US are offering certificates, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees on piloting, engineering, and fixing drones. Students in search of a drone education college have several schools to choose from.\n\nDrone-specific courses prepare learners for the FAA’s Section 107 Commercial Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) exam for pilot certification.\n\nIt is not mandatory that you only get your degree from a UAS-CTI school to obtain your drone pilot license. You can read the complete FAA guidelines here.\n\nTop Unmanned Aircraft Systems/Drone Training Colleges: Accredited\n\nListed below are a few schools that are a part of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems-Collegiate Training Initiative Program (UAS-CTI).\n\nColleges that provide a certificate, bachelor’s or associate’s in UAS or a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering with minors in UAS qualify for the FAA-CTI program. The curriculum in FAA-CTI schools features a drone-related curriculum that includes design and operations, maintenance, hands-on flight practice, federal policies, etc.\n\nThese are the accredited schools that offer a UAV/drone program:\n\n1. New England Institute of Technology, East Greenwich, Rhode Island\n\nThe New England Institute of Technology is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. The credential is recognized by the federal government and allows NEIT to participate in federal financial aid programs.\n\nNEIT also offers a comprehensive Associate in Science Degree in Electronics, Robotics, and Drones Technology (ERD).\n\nStudents start with electronic foundation core courses and go on to learn advanced subjects like aerial drones, robotics, microcontrollers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and programmable automation systems.\n\nProspective graduates receive instruction and training that can help them obtain one or more of the following certifications:\n\nGraduates of the course can seek entry-level career opportunities in unmanned aircraft systems, data collection (for law enforcement or real estate), remote sensing, drone industry, search and rescue, and navigation. Alternatively, students can also explore careers as an R&D technician, instrumentation technician, or systems technician.\n\n2. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, Florida\n\nEmbry-Riddle offers two career paths for prospective students-building drones and unmanned aerial vehicles or being a UAV Pilot.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science Program at the institute gives you the option of choosing pilot or non-pilot, depending upon your preference.
