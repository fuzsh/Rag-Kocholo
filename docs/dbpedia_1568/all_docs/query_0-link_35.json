Understanding the interplay between these disciplines and identifying effective collaboration strategies are crucial for advancing UAV technology [34]. Another important area of inquiry is the exploration of the challenges and opportunities presented by UAV technology. While UAVs offer numerous advantages such as improved efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced data collection capabilities, they also face challenges such as regulatory frameworks, privacy concerns, and safety issues. Investigating these challenges and finding solutions will contribute to the responsible and effective integration of UAVs into society [35]. As researchers in the field of UAVs, we recognize the importance of addressing these research questions. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive guide that navigates the vast landscape of UAV research. By synthesizing the latest findings and insights from various subdomains, we hope to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field. Through collaboration and knowledge sharing, we can collectively advance UAV technology and unlock its full potential in a wide range of applications.\n\nIn the realm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, several pressing research questions exist. Key among is exploring how we can enhance UAV autonomy by integrating machine learning and AI into their systems for improved functionality and decision making [34]. The improvement in navigation and control systems for precision maneuvers in unpredictable environments is a significant area of focus, as is developing advanced “sense and avoid” systems for reliable obstacle detection. The application of swarm intelligence in UAVs to facilitate collaborative tasks and the implementation of efficient algorithms is being studied [35].

The ability to increase the UAV payload capacity without compromising efficiency or maneuverability and how drones can be adapted for specific payload types is under scrutiny. Equally important are the security concerns surrounding UAV systems against potential cyber-attacks or hijacking, and measures to protect individual privacy from the misuse of surveillance-capable UAVs. Questions abound about how UAVs can be safely incorporated into crowded airspace, particularly in urban environments or near airports, and what changes to air traffic control systems are required to accommodate them. The regulatory implications of widespread UAV use are also on the table, focusing on how laws and regulations should adapt to handle UAV use. Finally, the aspect of human–UAV interaction in terms of the safe and effective design for human interaction and improving the user experience is being delved into. Each of these research questions presents an exciting challenge in shaping the future of UAV technology.\n\nIn response to these needs, this paper serves as a comprehensive guide for new researchers venturing into the multifaceted and expansive subdomains of UAV research. Recognizing the vast scope of this field, the guide aims to establish a strong foundation for novice researchers by providing a thorough review and survey of each subfield. It encompasses popular UAV classifications [36], which categorize UAVs based on their size, range, and endurance. In addition to covering UAV classifications, this paper provides an overview of crucial aspects such as hardware architecture, recent research trends, open source initiatives, and software tools employed in UAV development and research.

However, detecting small aircraft such as general aviation aircraft using traditional radar systems can be challenging. To address this issue, researchers are exploring the use of ML algorithms, such as DL, to improve the accuracy and reliability of aircraft detection systems. Integrating aircraft detection systems with UAVs’ navigation and control systems is also a significant research direction. This integration can enable the automatic adjustment of UAVs’ flight paths in response to the detected aircraft, ensuring the safe operation of both manned and unmanned aircraft. The research on aircraft detection for UAVs is crucial for enabling the widespread adoption of UAV technology in various domains, such as delivery, inspection, and surveillance, while ensuring safe operation in shared airspace.\n\n3.4.

Autonomous flight is a complex and challenging area of research in the field of UAVs, requiring the integration of multiple technologies, such as sensors [90], computer vision [91], and AI [92]. The objective is to develop UAVs that can perform complex tasks in a safe and efficient manner, such as precision landing [91,93], without human intervention. One of the critical challenges in autonomous flight is developing UAVs that can navigate and avoid obstacles in real time while maintaining stability and control. This requires the development of advanced control algorithms [94] and sensors [90] that can accurately detect and respond to changes in the environment. Another significant challenge in autonomous flight is ensuring the safety and reliability of UAVs, particularly in scenarios with limited human intervention or hazardous areas [95]. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new approaches for monitoring, controlling, and diagnosing UAVs, including the integration of backup systems, failsafe mechanisms, and real-time monitoring systems. The goal of autonomous flight is to develop UAVs capable of performing a broad range of tasks safely, efficiently, and reliably without the need for human intervention. This has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including agriculture, logistics, military operations, search and rescue missions, and civil engineering applications.\n\n3.5.

To achieve this objective, a systematic search of the Scopus database was conducted using predefined keywords in the title, abstract, and keywords fields from January 2020 to December 2022. Research directions were delineated based on the identified publications, and the resultant growth trajectories were plotted, taking into account the linear relationship between the number of publications and time (y = ax + b), where y represents the number of publications, x represents the year, and b represents the number of publications in the previous year. Parameter a reflects the magnitude and rate of growth observed from year to year.\n\nThe results of this analysis are presented in Figure 3, depicting the growth trajectories of each research direction. Furthermore, Table 3 tabulates the average growth rate for each research direction to facilitate a better understanding of the growth dynamics in the UAV field.\n\nThe acceleration of growth shown in Table 3 demonstrates a high degree of efficacy in predicting the areas of interest that attract significant attention from researchers in the UAV domain. These predictions offer a nuanced perspective of the developments and trends within the field. For example, the antenna field has a considerable number of publications and an impressive growth rate of approximately 980 new documents per year. However, its growth ratio remains relatively constant at 1.20.

These innovations in UAV suspension payload technology will lead to more efficient and reliable delivery and transport capabilities, further expanding the applications of UAVs in various fields.\n\n5.10. Transformability or Convertibility\n\nTransformability or convertibility is an emerging technology in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles that enables them to change their shape or configuration in flight [45,46,47,180]. This advancement has the potential to enhance the versatility and efficiency of UAVs by allowing them to adapt to different operational environments and missions. There are several approaches to achieving transformability in UAVs, including:\n\nOne important area of transformability that we will explore is the utilization of morphing wings. This innovative approach involves designing wings capable of changing their shape during flight to enhance efficiency and maneuverability [181]. By incorporating morphing wings technology, drones can adapt their wing configurations to varying flight conditions, such as alterations in altitude, speed, and wind direction. Through these adaptable wings, drones can optimize their aerodynamic performance and overall efficiency, thereby improving their range, endurance, and stability [182]. There are several mechanisms employed to achieve morphing wings, including shape memory alloys, smart materials, and mechanical systems. These mechanisms enable drones to adjust the wing angle, alter the curvature of the airfoil, or even completely change the wing shape. One notable example of the morphing wings technology is the “RoboSwift”, developed by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Resembling a swift bird in nature, this small drone has the ability to morph its wings during flight, allowing for enhanced efficiency and reduced noise. The RoboSwift has gained considerable recognition in the scientific community due to its innovative morphing wings technology and its potential applications in various fields, such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, and wildlife research. Its remarkable features have been highlighted in numerous research papers [183,184]. Another notable example is the “FlexFoil” developed by FlexSys Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA, an American engineering firm. The FlexFoil incorporates a unique “morphing trailing edge” technology, enabling the rear edge of the wing to bend and twist in response to changes in the airflow [185]. This design feature enhances the drone’s aerodynamic performance and adaptability to different flight conditions, resulting in improved efficiency. By harnessing the power of morphing wings’ technology, drones can revolutionize the field of aviation by achieving greater agility, range, and stability. The development of such transformative capabilities opens up new possibilities for various industries, from surveillance and monitoring to research and exploration.\n\nThe concept of foldable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), equipped with collapsible arms or wings, presents an intriguing area for exploration [186].

This design allows the UAV to achieve higher speeds of up to 200 mph, enabling it to more efficiently cover longer distances [194,195]. Another notable transformable rotor UAV is the Voliro Hexcopter developed by the ETH Zurich team [196,197]. This hexacopter utilizes multiple rotors capable of providing thrust in various directions, granting the drone the ability to translate freely and maneuver in complex environments. NASA’s Greased Lightning GL-10 [198] is yet another remarkable transformable rotor UAV. It can seamlessly transition between a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) mode and a fixed-wing mode, optimizing efficiency during forward flight. This UAV is equipped with ten electric motors powering ten rotors, enabling it to achieve high speeds and exceptional maneuverability. These examples demonstrate the immense potential of transformable rotor UAVs in expanding the capabilities and versatility of unmanned aerial systems, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable aerial missions across various industries.\n\nOverall, transformable UAVs have the potential to greatly improve the versatility and efficiency of UAVs, enabling them to adapt to different operational environments and missions. By transforming their shape or configuration in flight, these UAVs can optimize their performance for different flight conditions and mission requirements, making them a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.\n\n6. Advancements in Aircraft Control: An Overview of the Development Axes\n\nFlight dynamics control is a critical area of aerospace engineering that focuses on the stability and control of an aircraft during flight [28]. The main objective of flight dynamics control is to ensure that the aircraft remains stable, controllable, and safe across its entire flight envelope [199]. Various approaches and algorithms are employed in flight dynamics control to design control systems that stabilize and govern the behavior of aircraft throughout different flight tasks, including path following [200], morphing capabilities [45,47,48,180], navigation and surveillance [77], swarm flights [28], autonomous maneuvering [17], mapping [201], and sprayer operations [202]. These approaches and algorithms [27,28], along with their architectural considerations [28,203], utilize the mathematical models of aircraft dynamics and control theory to generate control inputs that modify the aircraft’s behavior to achieve specific performance objectives [27]. The ultimate goal is to ensure safe, stable, and efficient flight operations.\n\nThere are several ways to classify UAV control methodologies [94,203,204], based on factors such as the type of UAV being controlled, the control objectives, and the mathematical techniques employed. Here are some common classifications in control theory: feedback control vs. feedforward control; linear control vs. nonlinear control [205]; continuous-time control vs. discrete-time control; deterministic control vs. stochastic control; model-based control vs. model-free control, robust control [206,207], and adaptive control [208,209]; centralized control vs. decentralized control; optimal control vs. suboptimal control; and time-invariant control vs. time-varying control. These classifications represent the different approaches and algorithms used in flight dynamics control. However, four main categories are widely recognized: classical control, modern control, intelligent control, and adaptive control, each offering distinct methodologies and techniques to address the complexities of flight dynamics control.\n\n6.1. Classical Control\n\nClassical control [210,211] refers to traditional control theory based on the mathematical models of linear systems. This approach is widely employed in controlling aircraft dynamics and involves the use of proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control algorithms. The advantage of classical control lies in its simplicity and well-established theoretical foundations. However, it has limitations in handling nonlinear systems and managing disturbances that impact the aircraft’s performance.\n\n6.2. Modern Control\n\nModern control [211] encompasses the use of advanced control theory, including state-space and optimal control, to design control systems capable of handling nonlinearities and disturbances. This approach is extensively applied in flight dynamics control, as it provides more precise control and can manage complex systems. The advantage of modern control is its ability to handle nonlinear systems and uncertainties [212]. However, it requires more computational power and sophisticated algorithms, posing challenges for real-time implementation. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a popular control algorithm widely used in flight dynamics control for the optimal control of linear systems.\n\n6.3. Intelligent Control\n\nIntelligent control [213,214,215] is a branch of control theory that employs AI techniques, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, to design control systems. This approach finds extensive use in flight dynamics control, as it can adapt to changing conditions and provide a high level of robustness. The advantage of intelligent control lies in its ability to handle complex and nonlinear systems, along with its adaptive nature. However, it requires significant computational resources and can be challenging to analyze and debug. Neural networks are widely employed in flight dynamics control, particularly for control and fault diagnosis. They have found applications in autopilots, flight control systems, and engine control systems.\n\n6.4. Adaptive Control\n\nAdaptive control is a class of control algorithms that can dynamically adjust control parameters in real-time based on the aircraft’s behavior and environmental conditions [208]. This approach is widely employed in flight dynamics control as it effectively handles uncertainties and disturbances, making it suitable for variable operating conditions. The advantage of adaptive control lies in its ability to accommodate uncertain systems and adapt to changing conditions. However, it requires a substantial amount of data to learn the system’s behavior, which can be challenging to obtain in certain cases. The model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is a widely used adaptive control algorithm in flight dynamics control, finding applications in various aircraft control systems, including autopilots, flight directors, and flight control systems [209].\n\nIn summary, flight dynamics control approaches and algorithms play a critical role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. The different classes of control techniques possess their respective strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of a particular approach depends on the specific requirements of the control problem. Researchers and practitioners continue to develop and enhance control systems for aircraft, and new approaches and algorithms are expected to emerge. In conclusion, flight dynamics control is an essential field of aerospace engineering that ensures the stability and controllability of an aircraft during its flight. Static stability control, dynamic stability control, and maneuverability control are the three primary classifications of flight dynamics control. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their selection depends on the specific design requirements of the aircraft.\n\n6.5. Pushing the Boundaries of UAV Control: Exploring Advanced Techniques\n\nIn addition to the widely used PID control, the field of UAV control employs several advanced control techniques that aim to enhance performance and stability [216,217,218]. These techniques are particularly suited for complex and dynamic UAV systems. One prominent advanced control technique in UAV control is model predictive control (MPC). MPC utilizes mathematical models of the UAV’s dynamics to predict its future behavior [219,220]. Based on these predictions, control inputs are computed to optimize a predefined performance metric, such as energy consumption, stability, or trajectory tracking accuracy. By considering the UAV’s entire future trajectory, MPC offers improved performance compared to traditional control techniques. Another significantly advanced control technique is adaptive control. Adaptive control adjusts its parameters in real-time to adapt to changes in the UAV’s environment and dynamics. This enables the control system to continuously enhance its performance over time, even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances [209,221,222]. These advanced control techniques contribute to the development of more robust and efficient UAV control systems. Sliding mode control (SMC) is another advanced control technique that is widely used in UAV control. SMC is a nonlinear control technique that provides a robust performance in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. SMC works by maintaining the UAV’s states within a desired operating region, known as the sliding mode, which ensures stability and robustness [223,224]. Finally, there are several advanced control techniques that are based on ML as AI, such as RL and DRL [215,217], and neural network-based control [213,217]. These techniques enable UAVs to learn from their experiences and improve their control performance over time. In conclusion, there are several advanced control techniques that are being used in the field of UAV control. These techniques provide improved performance and stability compared to traditional control techniques, and they are well suited to the complex and dynamic requirements of UAV systems. Cooperative control is a technique that enables multiple UAVs to work together to achieve a common mission objective. Cooperative control is particularly useful for UAVs that need to perform complex tasks [225], such as surveillance or search and rescue, that require coordination and collaboration between multiple UAVs.\n\nSMC is a widely utilized advanced control technique in UAV control. SMC is a nonlinear control method that ensures robust performance, even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. By maintaining the UAV’s states within a desired operating region, known as the sliding mode, SMC guarantees stability and robustness [223,224]. The core concept of SMC lies in the creation of a sliding surface, which is a manifold in the state space. The sliding surface is carefully designed to have attractive properties, such as finite-time convergence or robustness against parameter variations. The control law then acts upon the system to drive its state trajectory towards this sliding surface and maintain it there [226]. The distinguishing feature of SMC is its discontinuous nature (Chattering) [227]. The control law consists of multiple control actions, or switching functions, that are activated based on the relative position of the system state with respect to the sliding surface. When the system’s state is not on the sliding surface, the control law switches between different modes or control actions to robustly drive the state towards the sliding surface. Once the state reaches the sliding surface, the control law switches to a different mode to maintain the system’s trajectory on the surface [226,227,228]. The discontinuous nature of SMC offers robustness against uncertainties and disturbances since the control actions adapt rapidly based on the state’s proximity to the sliding surface. Moreover, the sliding mode itself provides inherent robustness properties as the system’s behavior on the sliding surface is less sensitive to parameter variations or external disturbances. Mathematically, SMC relies on the theory of differential inclusions and Lyapunov stability analysis to guarantee the system’s convergence to the sliding surface and the subsequent maintenance of the system’s behavior on the surface [228].\n\nThe general approach to designing SMC components is to start by defining a sliding surface that represents the desired behavior of the system. The sliding surface should have attractive properties, such as ensuring stability, convergence, or robustness. The choice of the sliding surface depends on the specific control objective and system dynamics. One commonly used sliding surface in quadrotor control is based on the error between the desired state and the actual state of the UAV. The sliding surface is designed to drive the error dynamics to zero. There are various possible sliding surfaces that can be used based on different UAV objectives and system dynamics. Several sliding surface design strategies have been proposed to minimize or eliminate the reaching mode [229]. These methods can be classified based on dimensions, linearity, time dependence, and the nature of their moving algorithm [223,229]. The aforementioned conventional sliding surface naturally yields a proportional–derivative (PD) sliding surface. To obtain PID structures, an integral action can also be included. Incorporating the integral term is commonly performed in conjunction with a boundary layer SMC approach. By including the integral term, the steady-state error resulting from the boundary layer can be eliminated [229]. The author in [229] has conducted extensive work in classifying the sliding surface into different categories, including linear constant sliding surface, linear discretely moving sliding surface, linear continuously moving sliding surface, constant nonlinear sliding surface, and nonlinear time-varying sliding surface. All these sliding surfaces are designed to improve controller performance by minimizing or eliminating the time required to reach the sliding phase. The second step in SMC design is to determine the equivalent control law and switching Law. After defining the sliding surface, the equivalent control law is derived to drive the system dynamics onto the sliding surface and maintain them there. The equivalent control law is typically obtained by analyzing the system’s dynamic equation, which is designed to ensure that the system exhibits desirable behavior and achieves the control objectives. It involves determining a control signal that will force the system state to follow the sliding surface and stabilize the system. The control law should be designed to counteract the effects of uncertainties, disturbances, and nonlinearities in the system. The switching law is a crucial component that ensures the system’s states remain on the sliding surface. It plays a key role in rejecting disturbances, uncertainties, and other external factors that may affect the system’s performance. By employing a discontinuous control signal, specifically a set-valued control signal, this signal compels the system to “slide” along a section of its typical behavior [230]. There exist various types of reaching laws for SMC, including switching and non-switching reaching laws [230]. Additionally, a new non-switching reaching law has been introduced, demonstrating improved system robustness without amplifying the magnitude of critical signals in the system [230]. Non-switching reaching laws eliminate the need for switching across the sliding hyperplane in each subsequent step [231]. Additionally, a new non-switching reaching law has been introduced, demonstrating improved system robustness without amplifying the magnitude of critical signals in the system [230]. Non-switching reaching laws eliminate the need for switching across the sliding hyperplane in each subsequent step [231].\n\nML techniques, including RL, DRL [215,217], and neural network-based control [213,217] empower UAVs to learn from their experiences and continually enhance their control performance over time. UAVs have greatly benefited from the application of ML, which has enabled them to efficiently perform assigned tasks [92]. Researchers have explored the potential of UAVs in various areas such as inspection, delivery, and surveillance [92]. ML techniques have been employed to provide control strategies, including adaptive control in uncertain environments, real-time path planning, and object recognition [92]. An interesting approach to UAV control using ML is DRL. This method allows UAVs to autonomously discover optimal control laws by interacting with the system and handling complex nonlinear dynamics [232]. Remarkably, DRL has demonstrated success in the attitude control of fixed-wing UAVs using the original nonlinear dynamics with as little as three minutes of flight data [232]. The integration of ML has not only enhanced UAV capabilities but also reduced challenges, opening doors to various sectors [233]. This combination has yielded fast and reliable results [233]. In the realm of UAV flight controller designs, model-based control (MBC) techniques have traditionally dominated. However, they heavily rely on accurate mathematical models of the real plant and face complexity issues. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer a promising solution to address these challenges due to their unique features and advantages in system identification and controller design [234]. A comprehensive survey examines the combination of MBC and ANNs for UAV flight control, particularly in low-level control [234]. The objective is to establish a foundation and facilitate efficient controller designs with performance guarantees [234]. Fuzzy logic has been utilized to design autonomous flight control systems for UAVs [235]. For instance, a study focused on UAV flight dynamics and developed longitudinal and lateral controllers based on fuzzy logic [236]. Despite not employing optimization techniques or dynamic model knowledge, the fuzzy logic controller exhibited satisfactory performance [236]. Another example involves an ANFIS-based autonomous flight controller for UAVs, which utilizes three fuzzy logic modules to control the UAV’s position in three-dimensional space, including altitude and longitude-latitude location [237]. In summary, the field of UAV control encompasses several advanced techniques that offer improved performance and stability compared to traditional control approaches. These techniques are well suited to meet the complex and dynamic requirements of UAV systems.\n\nCooperative control is a technique that facilitates the collaboration of multiple UAVs to accomplish a shared mission objective. Particularly for tasks like surveillance or search and rescue, where coordination and collaboration among multiple UAVs are essential, cooperative control proves to be highly beneficial [225]. The cooperative control of UAVs entails the effective coordination and collaboration among multiple drones to accomplish shared goals [238]. UAV swarms bring forth advantages in terms of improved efficiency, flexibility, accuracy, robustness, and reliability [238]. Nevertheless, the integration of external communications introduces the possibility of encountering additional faults, failures, uncertainties, and cyberattacks, which can potentially result in the propagation of errors [238]. For the purpose of ensuring operational safety, the field of cooperative control has seen the development of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) methods [239]. These methods are designed to identify and tolerate faults that may occur in the individual components of UAVs [239]. The FDD unit is responsible for diagnosing faults, while the FTC unit offers appropriate compensation measures [239]. Cooperative UAVs find wide-ranging applications in diverse fields such as search and rescue operations, border patrol, mapping tasks, surveillance missions, and military operations [240]. These tasks are well suited to autonomous vehicles due to their repetitive or dangerous nature. The utilization of multiple UAVs substantially enhances the efficiency of execution [240]. In the realm of cooperative control, recent advancements encompass the introduction of a distributed consensus algorithm for multi-agent systems (MASs). This algorithm ensures the delivery of seamless input signals to control channels, effectively mitigating the undesired chattering effect associated with conventional control protocols [241]. Another innovative concept is cooperative fault detection and diagnosis (CFDD) and fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC), which mitigate the negative impact of the component and communication faults that may arise during formation or swarm flights [239]. Within the cooperative control architecture, drones collect sensory data, communicate, and share information [238]. Tasks are assigned based on mission requirements, and optimal paths are generated [238]. Control algorithms ensure precise trajectory tracking, while collision avoidance mechanisms ensure safe operations [238]. The continuous feedback and adaptation maintain accurate trajectory tracking [238]. By incorporating these steps and advancements, cooperative control enables drones to effectively work together, accomplish complex tasks, and achieve synchronized trajectory following [238,239,241]. This enhances efficiency and effectiveness in various applications, such as aerial formations, surveillance, and coordinated mapping missions. The cooperative control architecture for a UAV begins by collect sensory data and communicate with each other to exchange information. Tasks and roles are assigned based on mission requirements, considering capabilities and resource availability. Optimal paths and trajectories are generated to accomplish assigned tasks, considering the mission objectives and environmental constraints. The control layer translates high-level commands and planned paths into low-level actions, ensuring stability, motion control, and trajectory tracking. The mission management layer oversees the overall mission, adapting plans and allocating resources as needed based on real-time feedback from UAVs. This integrated approach enables efficient task allocation, precise control, and adaptive mission management, facilitating effective cooperation among the UAVs to accomplish complex objectives.\n\nFault-tolerant control (FTC) is a methodology employed to uphold acceptable performance and ensure the safety of a system even when faults or failures occur in its hardware or software components [242]. Such faults or failures may arise from diverse causes, including sensor malfunctions, actuator failures, communication losses, or software errors. The objective of fault-tolerant control is to detect faults or failures and mitigate their effects by reconfiguring the control system or adapting the control law. This can be accomplished through the utilization of redundancy, fault detection, and isolation (FDI) techniques [243,244,245], and fault accommodation strategies. Redundancy involves the presence of multiple copies of critical hardware or software components that can assume control in the event of a failure or fault. For instance, a UAV may possess redundant sensors or actuators that can be employed if the primary ones fail. FDI techniques employ sensor data to detect and isolate faults or failures in the UAV’s hardware or software. FDI can be achieved using a variety of techniques, including observer-based approaches, statistical methods, or analytical redundancy. Fault accommodation strategies adapt the control law or reconfigure the control system to maintain the UAV’s stability and performance in the presence of faults or failures. These strategies may involve switching to backup control law, adjusting control gains, or employing adaptive control techniques. Overall, fault-tolerant control plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of UAVs even in the presence of faults or failures [242,246]. It enables UAVs to detect and mitigate the effects of faults or failures, allowing them to effectively continue operating and achieve their mission objectives. Recent advancements in the field of FTC for UAVs have been the subject of several studies. A survey article provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on fault diagnosis, FTC, and anomaly detection specifically tailored for UAVs [246]. Additionally, a separate review focuses on the topic of fault-tolerant cooperative control, specifically addressing the control of multiple UAVs in a fault-tolerant manner, this study delves into the recent developments in fault-tolerant cooperative control and offers a systematic analysis of FTCC methods applicable to multi-UAV scenarios. The study initially summarizes and analyzes the formation of control strategies for the fault-free flight conditions of multi-UAVs [239]. Furthermore, an adaptive fault-tolerant control method integrated with fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) technology and a neural network is proposed for the attitude system of a quadrotor UAV in another study [247]. The utilization of the NN allows for the approximation of uncertain terms within the system, thereby enhancing fault-tolerant capabilities.\n\nPrescribed performance control (PPC) is a control methodology specifically designed to fulfill prescribed performance criteria. In PPC, prescribed performance refers to ensuring that the tracking error converges to a predefined small residual set while satisfying a predetermined convergence rate and limiting the maximum overshoot to a sufficiently small constant, Consequently, the desired transient performance metrics, such as overshoot and convergence time, are successfully achieved [248]. This passage emphasizes the significance of achieving a good transient performance in aircraft control systems, encompassing traditional airplanes, hypersonic flight vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It discusses several studies and methodologies that employ PPC to achieve this goal [248]. The study [249] focuses on the traditional PPC approach to develop an integrated guidance and control method for interceptors, ensuring excellent transient performance during target interception. In the case of hypersonic flight vehicles, studies [250,251] indicated that the normal PPC guarantees satisfactory transient performance. However, satisfying the strict initial condition for tracking error poses a challenge. To address this, modified versions of the PPC have been proposed [252] as non-affine models to reduce the reliance on the initial error. Nevertheless, these methods may result in a large overshoot due to the initial value selection of the performance function. To mitigate this issue, a newly designed performance function [253] is applied to develop a concise neural tracking controller for hyper-sonic flight vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate small or zero overshoot in velocity and altitude tracking. UAVs, which hold significant potential in military and civil applications, greatly benefit from good transient performance to effectively carry out tasks. Numerous tracking control methodologies utilizing PPC have been proposed. Ref. [254] presented a fuzzy-back-stepping-based tracking controller with prescribed performance for a single UAV. Additionally, PPC is applied to platoon control, leader–follower control, as well as decentralized, finite-time, adaptive fault-tolerant, synchronization control multi-UAVs [255] and quadrotor UAVs. In the backstepping-based study in [256], the simulation results validated their superior performance in achieving both transient and steady-state performance. In summary, this passage underscores the application of PPC in achieving a desirable transient performance across a range of aircraft, including airplanes, hypersonic flight vehicles, and UAVs. The referenced studies provide evidence of the effectiveness of PPC methodologies.\n\nBy extensively examining various literary sources, we derived Table 4, which outlines the pros and cons of each controller as per the opinions of different authors.\n\n6.6. Considerations for Selecting an Appropriate Control Algorithm\n\nChoosing the right control algorithm for a UAV is a crucial decision that depends on various factors, including the type of UAV, its mission objectives, environmental conditions, and available hardware and software resources. Several considerations should be taken into account when selecting or developing a control algorithm. Firstly, it is essential to identify the UAV’s requirements. Understanding the UAV’s performance requirements, such as flight range, payload capacity, and environmental conditions, is crucial in determining the most suitable control algorithm. Next, evaluate the different control algorithms available for UAVs, including classical PID, PID2, LQR, sliding mode control, and model reference adaptive controller. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and consider how well they align with the UAV’s requirements. Consider the implementation complexity of the chosen control algorithm. Some algorithms may require significant computational resources or specialized hardware, such as ML-based algorithms or cooperative decision and control [225]. Select an algorithm that can be easily implemented on the UAV’s hardware platform, considering the available computing resources. Once a control algorithm is chosen, optimize its performance by tuning its control parameters. Flight testing can be conducted to collect data on the UAV’s flight behavior and adjust the control algorithm’s parameters for optimal performance. Here are some key considerations when selecting or developing a control algorithm for a UAV [94,203,274]:\n\nStability and control: The algorithm should ensure the UAV’s stability and controllability, even under turbulent or challenging conditions.\n\nPerformance: The algorithm should enable the UAV to achieve its performance objectives, such as speed, altitude, and maneuverability while minimizing power consumption and optimizing mission duration.\n\nSensitivity to environment: The algorithm should consider environmental factors that can affect the UAV’s performance, such as wind, temperature, and humidity.\n\nResponsiveness: The algorithm should be capable of responding quickly to changes in the UAV’s mission objectives or unexpected events, such as obstacles or other aircraft.\n\nComputational requirements: The algorithm should be computationally efficient and feasible for the available onboard processing hardware and software.\n\nRobustness: The algorithm should be robust to uncertainties, such as sensor noise or errors in the UAV’s kinematic model.\n\nSafety: The algorithm should ensure that the UAV operates safely and avoids collisions with other objects, people, or animals.\n\nRegulatory compliance: The algorithm should comply with local regulations and guidelines for UAV operations, such as flight altitude restrictions and flight path limitations.\n\nHuman interaction: The algorithm should enable human operators to interact with the UAV and provide inputs or commands, if necessary.\n\nOverall, the technique for choosing the right control algorithm for a UAV involves the careful consideration of the UAV’s requirements, the evaluation of different control algorithms, simulation and testing, implementation complexity, and optimization.\n\n7. Fundamental Hardware/Software Architectures for UAVs: Applications and Issues\n\n7.1. The Hardware Architecture of UAVs\n\nThe hardware architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) encompasses several critical components, such as the flight computer and controller, sensors, actuators, battery, communication interfaces, payload, and structural components. The flight computer and controller manage the flight path and stabilization of the UAV. Sensors provide crucial navigation, altitude, and orientation data, while actuators control the UAV’s movement. The battery, chosen according to the application’s requirements, powers the UAV. Communication interfaces enable remote control and data transmission, whereas the payload may include cameras, sensors, and other equipment specific to the application. Structural components, including the frame and arms, ensure support and stability for the UAV, allowing effective operation across applications. This hardware architecture significantly influences the capabilities and performance of UAVs across varying contexts [22,275,276,277]. Numerous studies have examined general hardware architecture. Multilevel architecture for UAVs has been proposed in the literature [22,275,276,277]. The characteristics of modern UAVs have been thoroughly discussed in [275,278]. The aspects of miniature UAVs are treated in [279], and the required software components for the real-time control implementation for UAVs are addressed in [199]. Regardless of scale, UAVs typically include the same components, with additions and modifications according to the application.\n\n7.1.1. Flight Computer and Controller\n\nThe flight computer serves as the primary processing unit that governs the UAV’s navigation and flight. It amalgamates data from all the sensors and actuators to manage the UAV’s flight trajectory and stability. For medium- or large-scale UAVs, this unit is generally more advanced and potent, given the system’s heightened complexity. A wealth of literature provides comprehensive reviews and surveys on flight controllers and computers [23,276,280,281]. Other works delve into the design and implementation of a UAV flight controller [282].\n\n7.1.2. Sensors\n\nThe sensor suite of a UAV typically encompasses a range of devices such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, barometers, GPS, and cameras. These sensors offer crucial information regarding the UAV’s orientation, position, and surrounding environment. Medium- or large-scale UAVs might additionally incorporate LIDAR [283], radar, and other specialized sensors for applications like navigation and mapping [158]. A brief comparison of remote-sensing platforms is presented in [284]. For agricultural applications, the sensors, and their deployment are discussed in [285,286], while their use in construction and civil applications is detailed in [99]. An examination of the electromagnetic interference on UAV sensors is covered in [287], and the application of different sensors in mining areas is discussed in [100]. Multi-sensor data fusion using deep learning (DL) for security and surveillance purposes is reviewed in [288], and remote sensing for forest health monitoring is explored in [289].\n\n7.1.3. Actuators\n\nThis includes motors, servos, and electronic speed controllers (ESCs) that control the UAV’s movement and stability. Medium- or large-scale UAVs are typically larger and more powerful to handle the increased weight and size of the UAV. The UAV electric propulsion system was reviewed in [105,290]. The application of the development of an actuator was analyzed in [291]. The development of other propulsion system plasma actuators was elaborated upon in [292].\n\n7.1.4. Battery\n\nThis is the power source that provides energy to the UAV’s components. A medium- or large-scale UAV typically requires a larger battery to provide enough energy to power its components, with many papers focused on UAV supply systems and the management of its energy [104]. While some [293] focused on the UAV architectures of power supply, their charging techniques are well discussed in [294], while the wireless charging of UAVs is covered in [295]. In addition, [296] presents the key technologies of the fuel cell of UAVs. The intelligent energy management and hybrid power supply for UAVs is reviewed in [297,298].\n\n7.1.5. Communication Interfaces\n\nThis includes radios and other communication devices that enable the UAV to transmit data to and receive data from ground stations, other UAVs, or other devices. Medium- or large-scale UAVs are typically more sophisticated and capable of transmitting and receiving larger amounts of data over longer distances. The exploration of the characteristics of UAV communication network issues, design issues, and applications is reviewed in [29], whereas the used communication process for UAVs is discussed in [299]. A survey of networking and communication technologies is well presented in [300]. Fifth-generation (5G) systems and satellite communication for UAV navigation and surveillance are presented in [77]. Moreover, [124,301] performed an in-depth analysis of the swarm communication architectures. In addition, [302] describes UAV-based IoT communication networks and the applications for IoT for sustainable smart farming are explored in [303].\n\n7.1.6. Payload\n\nThis is the equipment that the UAV is carrying for its specific mission, such as cameras, sensors, or other specialized equipment. A medium- or large-scale UAV is typically more sophisticated and specialized and may include specialized sensors, cameras, or other equipment to support its mission. Payload delivery UAV and dropping payload’s capability are investigated, respectively, in [176,304].\n\n7.1.7. Structural Components\n\nThese include the frame, arms, and other components that provide the UAV with its physical structure and support the other components. The structural components of a medium or large-scale UAV are typically larger, stronger, and more complex to support its size and weight. The concept and initial design of a UAV were addressed in [305]. And, UAV mechanical frame stress was analyzed by [306], while [307] reviewed the finite element methods for UAV structural analysis. A UAV wing’s structural analysis and optimization was investigated by [308], and small-scale UAV structural design and optimization were elaborated on by [309,310].\n\nThis is a general hardware architecture for a UAV. Depending on the specific UAV and its mission, the architecture may vary, and additional components may be added to meet specific requirements. In some cases, UAVs may use internal combustion engines to generate electricity, which can be used to power the electric motors. However, this is relatively rare, as electric motors are typically more efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly than internal combustion engines.\n\n7.2. The Software Architecture for UAVs\n\nIt is a critical component that enables the UAV to operate effectively and efficiently. The UAVs’ architecture, as an autonomous system, typically consists of several layers, including the firmware layer, operating system layer, middleware layer, and application layer [311,312,313,314,315]. The firmware layer includes the code that controls the hardware components of the UAV, such as the flight controller and sensors. The operating system layer provides the necessary interface between the firmware and higher-level software applications. The middleware layer includes software components that provide communication and data exchange between the different parts of the system. This layer includes protocols and software libraries for data transmission, processing, and storage. Finally, the application layer includes the software programs that run on top of the other layers and provide the necessary functionality for the UAV’s intended application. This layer includes software for flight planning, navigation, data analysis, and payload control.\n\nOverall, the software architecture for UAVs is a complex and highly integrated system that must be carefully designed to ensure the reliable and efficient operation in different applications. Advanced software techniques such as ML and AI are also becoming increasingly important in UAV software architectures to improve autonomy and decision-making capabilities.\n\n7.3. UAV Applications and Main Issues\n\nUAVs have numerous and diverse commercial, military, and scientific applications. The applications of UAVs have been discussed and categorized by numerous kinds of literature [49,315,316,317,318]. Some of the most common applications of UAVs include aerial photography and videography. UAVs can capture high-quality images and video footage from the air, making them ideal for applications such as film-making, real estate, and tourism. In agriculture [319], UAVs can be used to monitor crops, detect crop diseases, and optimize irrigation and fertilization, leading to more efficient and sustainable agriculture practices. UAVs can also be equipped with specialized sensors and cameras to aid in search and rescue operations, particularly in remote or hard-to-reach areas. In military and law enforcement, UAVs can be used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition in military and law enforcement applications. UAVs find applications in infrastructure inspection [316,317], aiding in the efficient and cost-effective inspection and monitoring of structures such as bridges [320], pipelines, and power lines. They also significantly contribute to environmental conservation efforts by monitoring parameters such as air and water quality, as well as wildlife populations [41,43]. Furthermore, UAVs serve as essential tools in scientific research, facilitating environmental monitoring [321], atmospheric studies [37,38,39,40,41,42,161], and wildlife tracking. They have notably enhanced our understanding of cryospheric features, both on the surface and subsurface. UAVs have also revolutionized faunal studies by enabling non-invasive methods for the accurate counting and morphometric analysis of various animal species. Atmospheric surveys conducted by UAVs offer swift and versatile data collection, including aerosol sample collection. The design and development of specialized platforms, tailored to the challenging Antarctic environment, have been instrumental in the successful deployment of these applications [19]. Consumer UAVs are designed for personal use, such as hobbyist drones, aerial photography drones, and racing drones. Overall, the applications of UAVs continue to expand and evolve as new technologies and capabilities emerge, providing significant opportunities for innovation and advancement in a wide range of fields. Due to the increase in UAV applications, certain UAV uses are raising common concerns and issues across industries [29,322,323]. These include privacy concerns, regulatory compliance, technical challenges, specialized equipment requirements, and potential safety risks. Privacy concerns arise from capturing images and videos without consent, while regulatory compliance and technical challenges relate to operating UAVs in specialized environments.
