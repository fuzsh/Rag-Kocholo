        "text": "What does a flight controller for drones do?\n\nI noticed that everything a flight controller does can be classified within one of three categories: Sensing, controlling, and communicating.\n\nPerception (sensing)\n\nThe flight controller is connected to a set of sensors. These sensors give the flight controller information about like its height, orientation, and speed. Common sensors include an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for determining the angular speed and acceleration, a barometer for the height, and distance sensors for detecting obstacles. Just like how we perceive as humans, the drone filters a lot of this information and fuses some to get more efficient and precise information. Advanced flight controllers can sense more precisely and detect differences more quickly.\n\nControlling\n\nAside from sensing what’s going on, a flight controller… unsurprisingly controls the motion of the drone. The drone can rotate and accelerate by creating speed differences between each of its four motors. The flight controller uses the data gathered by the sensors to calculate the desired speed for each of the four motors. The flight controller sends this desired speed to the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC’s), which translates this desired speed into a signal that the motors can understand.\n\nCalculating the movements, fusing and filtering the sensory information, and estimating the safety and durability of a flight is all done by an algorithm. A fancy word that is used a lot nowadays which in essence nothing more than a set of strict rules that every microchip on the board has to apply to. The most commonly used flight control algorithm is called PID control: Proportional Integral Derivative control. Within this area, there is a lot of research going on, which resulted in INDI: Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion. This algorithm reads out and reacts to incoming information way faster, therefore making the drone flight more stable.\n\nCommunicating\n\nA key part of a flight controller is communication. A part of the sensor’s job is to give out information that needs to be translated clearly for a pilot to read, which means efficiently. An obvious thing to communicate is its battery level, which can decide if a pilot wants to fly further or return to the charge.\n\nBut communication goes further than from flight controller to human pilot; with the entrance of auto-pilot programs in the drone industry, flight controllers need to communicate with other computer systems about its flight destination and how to get there. Communication is mostly done with wi-fi and radio frequencies right now, but cellular solutions are also already in use."
