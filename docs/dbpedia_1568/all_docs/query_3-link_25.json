        "text": "Simulation training has been shown by many studies to deliver the best learning outcomes, as (when done well) it provides a realistic, immersive experience in the context of the learner’s job role.\n\nWith advances in technology, elearning software, and our understanding of how people learn, we’re seeing a rise in simulation-based training. Businesses can save on the cost of assembling large groups of trainees and reduce risks involved with honing skills for complex tasks on-the-job, while achieving greater control and insights around performance analytics.\n\nA simulation based learning environment offers a safe way for organisations to help their employees can pick up the vital skills needed.\n\nWhat is Simulation Training?\n\nAs the name suggests, simulation training is the creation of a true-to-life learning environment that mirrors real-life work and scenarios. Trainees can put real knowledge and skills into practice not just by reading books on theory or listening to lectures, but through physical, hands-on activity.\n\nThis type of training is so effective as it takes into account several of the learning styles preferred by different learners. Not everyone learns visually, or through auditory materials, and simulation-based training also considers the needs of kinesthetic learners who flourish through practical exercises.\n\nSimulation-based training is a highly effective way of transferring key skills to trainees in a cost-effective manner. It provides an optimum way for employers to assess how well their trainees are putting skills into practice, and the decisions they are making in front of simulated real life situations. Learning in a safe and managed environment provides essential hands-on experience that integrates key theoretical concepts with interactive, computer simulated situations.\n\nThis immersive style of training, according to the US National Library of Medicine following a review of numerous research studies, provides learning “just like the real thing.” Simulation-based training can be applied across many different fields. In business areas, such as project management and customer service; the medical field, allowing for practical work in life-saving situations; the military and drone piloting, factory workers, commercial drivers, and so on.\n\nTop Simulation-Based Training Companies\n\nDay One Technologies\n\nThe Day One simulation training solutions are created bespoke to the unique needs and environment of each client. This UK elearning and simulation-based training provider can design a flexible immersive learning solution for both the current and future needs of your company.\n\nThey have a client list including Lloyds Banking Group, Linde, Roche, TSB and many other well-known brands.\n\nDay One creates simulated systems to match the look and functionality of your company’s programmes. This is especially important so that your trainees acquire skills in an environment that look and feels like the one they will be working with every day. What makes their solution rare, if not unique, is that when your systems and processes evolve, the simulations can evolve with them, reducing the ongoing costs of training content development.\n\nThe training process is as “true to life as it gets,” with the company’s unique “Dynamic Data” technology that introduces endless realistic scenarios and customer-generated details for trainees to work with. Day One Technologies promises “blow-your-mind realism” through systems that are easy to navigate from any desktop, compatible with your existing learning development system.\n\nYou can track your learners’ progress and performance, pull up detailed analytics reports and get a complete birdseye view on their progress throughout the simulation.
