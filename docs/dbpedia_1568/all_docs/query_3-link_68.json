        "text": "Delivering Mission Readiness Through Excellence in Engineering\n\nTraining value is directly related to high fidelity and fully immersive experiences. Realism is vital to maximizing mission readiness.\n\nFlight time is crucial to developing a pilot’s skill, turning reactions into reflexes and ensuring the safety of the aircraft and all onboard. But there is rarely enough flight time available to train every pilot exclusively in an actual aircraft, whether for basic flight skills or for multi-entity, networked tactical mission tasks.\n\nThat’s why training needs to reflect the range of systems and situations that could be encountered, even as requirements and technologies evolve. Platforms with limited fidelity can hinder these efforts. Pilots need training solutions that deliver a true-to-life experience to enhance their proficiency at all levels and increase their confidence, through realistic networked scenarios in immersive, synthetic tactical environments.\n\nWe design, develop and integrate high-fidelity systems that create a realistic training environment enabling complex networked mission tasks to be accomplished. And we do so on time, on schedule, and with the required system performance.\n\nOur training systems can be implemented within a large building or containerized for outside placement and relocation flexibility, while retaining the capability to network and train collectively in fully integrated tactical environments.\n\nVeraxx’s solutions are unparalleled in their realism, making them the training systems of choice for the most demanding organizations across the DoD, our Allies and for aircraft OEMs."
