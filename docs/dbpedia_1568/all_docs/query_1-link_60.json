        "text": "The only BS Aviation Program in Maine and one of only two in New England.\n\nUMAâs BS in Aviation represents a public-private partnership with Maine Instrument Flight (MIF), a highly regarded flight school located in Augusta. Flight Training is completed at the Augusta Airport and Academic training is completed at UMA Augusta Campus. Training pilots since 1946, MIF is the only FAA Part 141 certified flight school in the state of Maine that is approved for all courses.\n\nThrough the UMA program, MIF will equip students with the following four FAA certifications: private pilot in the first year, instrument rating in the second year, commercial pilot in the third year, and flight instructor in the fourth year.\n\nLow Airfare\n\nUMA provides the best in-flight training with the most efficient use of the studentâs financial resources. Because of UMAâs low public tuition rates, and the availability of our flight simulators, the BS in Aviation is competitively priced with other programs nationwide. Significant value is added when factoring in technically advanced training, advanced debrief tools, and virtual reality simulation. Plus, financial aid is available to most students to help offset the costs, and if youâve served in the armed forces, your military education benefits may pay a portion of your tuition and fees. Our use of simulation and Virtual Reality has a positive environmental impact as well, saving a significant amount of fuel.\n\nUMAâs Cirrus SR20 G6\n\nUMA acquired its new Cirrus SR20 in June 2022, which will allow the university to continue its expansion of state-of-the-art pilot instruction in Maine. The Cirrus plane provides students with training in high performance aircraft with the latest cockpit design.\n\nThe SR20 is a state of the art airplane manufactured in Minnesota. It has a max operating altitude of 17,500 feet, and a range of 709 nautical miles. The max cruise speed is 155 knots â roughly 180 miles per hour. It is the first production general aviation (GA) aircraft equipped with a parachute to lower the airplane safely to the ground after a loss of control, structural failure, or midair collision. The SR series was also the first mass-manufactured light aircraft with all-composite construction and flat-panel avionics.\n\nVirtual Reality Training\n\nUMA has taken a page from the Air Forceâs Undergraduate Pilot Training guidelines and has implemented the use of Virtual Reality in our training. These efforts not only keep aviation students safer, it significantly reduces their education costs associated with flying an actual airplane.\n\nUMA’s Flight Simulators\n\nUMAâs flight simulators are classified as FAA-approved advanced aircraft training devices (AATD). This means students can log time toward Private, Instrument, and Commercial certifications in the training device toward the completion of certification requirements. The simulators are located at Maine Instrument Flight in Augusta.\n\nNew Students\n\nAll new students will be matriculated into the Bachelor of Science in Aviation program. UMA also offers a certificate in advanced aviation.\n\nIncoming Veterans\n\nAs of January 2024, The Veterans Administration approved UMA private pilot training program for Veteran benefits.\n\nLearn more about the Crewed Aircraft Training Program\n\nAnticipated Careers and Salaries for UMA Aviation Graduates\n\nUMA aviation graduates are entering an exciting period in our history on which to embark on an aviation career. Their options run the entire employment spectrum from civilian employment to government including military or starting oneâs own business. The salaries are just as varied as are the type of jobs.\n\nAviation careers use a type of âseniorityâ to advance in the field. A pilot needs to have a certain number of flight hours, whether manned or unmanned, to progress in responsibility and to increase in salary and benefits.\n\nQuestions?"
