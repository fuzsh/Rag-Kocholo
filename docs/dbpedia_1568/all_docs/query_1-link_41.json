        "text": "What Airline and Commercial Pilots Do About this section\n\nAirline and commercial pilots fly and navigate airplanes, helicopters, and other aircraft.\n\nDuties\n\nPilots typically do the following:\n\nCheck the overall condition of the aircraft before and after every flight\n\nEnsure that the aircraft is balanced and below its weight limit\n\nVerify that the fuel supply is adequate and that weather conditions are acceptable\n\nPrepare and submit flight plans to air traffic control\n\nCommunicate with air traffic control over the aircraft’s radio system\n\nOperate and control aircraft along planned routes and during takeoffs and landings\n\nMonitor engines, fuel consumption, and other aircraft systems during flight\n\nRespond to changing conditions, such as weather events and emergencies (for example, a mechanical malfunction)\n\nNavigate the aircraft by using cockpit instruments and visual references\n\nPilots plan their flights by checking that the aircraft is operable and safe, that the cargo has been loaded correctly, and that weather conditions are acceptable. They file flight plans with air traffic control and may modify the plans in flight because of changing weather conditions or other factors.\n\nTakeoff and landing can be the most demanding parts of a flight. They require close coordination among the pilot; copilot; flight engineer, if present; air traffic controllers; and ground personnel. Once in the air, the captain may have the first officer, if present, fly the aircraft, but the captain remains responsible for the aircraft. After landing, pilots fill out records that document their flight and the status of the aircraft.\n\nSome pilots are also instructors using simulators and dual-controlled aircraft to teach students how to fly.\n\nThe following are examples of types of pilots:\n\nAirline pilots work primarily for airlines that transport passengers and cargo on a fixed schedule. The captain or pilot in command, usually the most experienced pilot, supervises all other crew members and has primary responsibility for the flight. The copilot, often called the first officer or second in command, shares flight duties with the captain. Some older planes require a third pilot known as a flight engineer, who monitors instruments and operates controls. Technology has automated many of these tasks, and new aircraft do not require flight engineers.\n\nCommercial pilots are involved in unscheduled flight activities, such as aerial application, charter flights, and aerial tours. Commercial pilots may have additional nonflight duties. Some commercial pilots schedule flights, arrange for maintenance of the aircraft, and load luggage themselves. Pilots who transport company executives, also known as corporate pilots, greet their passengers before embarking on the flight.\n\nAgricultural pilots typically handle agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides, and may be involved in other agricultural practices in addition to flying. Pilots, such as helicopter pilots, who fly at low levels must constantly look for trees, bridges, power lines, transmission towers, and other obstacles.\n\nWith proper training, airline pilots also may be deputized as federal law enforcement officers and be issued firearms to protect the cockpit.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nAirline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers held about 96,300 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of airline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers were as follows:\n\nScheduled air transportation 86% Couriers and express delivery services 5 Federal government, excluding postal service 3 Support activities for transportation 2 Nonscheduled air transportation 1\n\nCommercial pilots held about 56,500 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of commercial pilots were as follows:\n\nNonscheduled air transportation 35% Support activities for air transportation 10 Technical and trade schools; private 8 Ambulance services 8 Professional, scientific, and technical services 4\n\nPilots assigned to long-distance routes may experience fatigue and jetlag. Weather conditions may result in turbulence, requiring pilots to change the flying altitude. Flights can be long and flight decks are often sealed, so pilots work in small teams for long periods in close proximity to one another.\n\nAerial applicators, also known as crop dusters, may be exposed to toxic chemicals, typically use unimproved landing strips, such as grass, dirt, or gravel surface, and may be at risk of collision with power lines. Helicopter pilots involved in rescue operations may fly at low levels during bad weather or at night, and land in areas surrounded by power lines, highways, and other obstacles. Pilots use hearing protection devices to prevent their exposure to engine noise.\n\nThe high level of concentration required to fly an aircraft and the mental stress of being responsible for the safety of passengers can be fatiguing. Pilots must be alert and quick to react if something goes wrong. Federal law requires pilots to retire at age 65.\n\nMost pilots are based near large airports.\n\nInjuries and Illnesses\n\nAlthough fatalities are uncommon, airline and commercial pilots experience one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities of all occupations.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nFederal regulations set the maximum work hours and minimum requirements for rest between flights for most pilots. Airline pilots fly an average of 75 hours per month and work an additional 150 hours per month performing other duties, such as checking weather conditions and preparing flight plans. Pilots have variable work schedules that may include some days of work followed by some days off. Flight assignments are based on seniority. Seniority enables pilots who have worked at a company for a long time to get preferred routes and schedules.\n\nAirline pilots may spend several nights a week away from home because flight assignments often involve overnight layovers. When pilots are away from home, the airlines typically provide hotel accommodations, transportation to the airport, and an allowance for meals and other expenses.\n\nCommercial pilots also may have irregular schedules. Although most commercial pilots remain near their home overnight, some may still work nonstandard hours.\n\nHow to Become an Airline or Commercial Pilot About this section\n\nAirline pilots typically need a bachelor’s degree and experience as a commercial or military pilot. Commercial pilots typically need flight training, and some employers may require or prefer them to have a degree.\n\nAirline and commercial pilots also must have specific certificates and ratings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nEducation\n\nAirline pilots typically need a bachelor’s degree in any field, including transportation, engineering, or business. They also complete flight training with independent FAA-certified flight instructors or at schools that offer flight training.\n\nCommercial pilots typically complete flight training, and some employers require or prefer that they have a degree.\n\nThe FAA certifies hundreds of civilian flight schools, which range from small fixed base operators (FBO) to state universities. Some colleges and universities offer pilot training as part of a 2- or 4-year aviation degree.\n\nTraining\n\nAirline and commercial pilots who are newly hired by airlines or on-demand air services companies undergo on-the-job training in accordance with federal regulations. This training usually includes several weeks of ground school and flight training. Various types of ratings for specific aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 or Cessna Citation, typically are acquired through employer-based training and generally are earned by pilots who have at least a commercial pilot certificate.\n\nPilots also must maintain their experience in performing certain maneuvers. This requirement means that pilots must perform specific maneuvers and procedures a given number of times within a specified amount of time. Pilots also must undergo periodic training and medical examinations, generally every year or every other year.\n\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\n\nAirline pilots typically need work experience as a commercial or military pilot.\n\nTo get a job with a major or regional airline, pilots need extensive flight experience. Some pilots work as flight instructors or on-demand charter pilots, positions that usually require less experience than airline jobs require, to help build enough flying hours so that they can apply to the airlines.\n\nMilitary pilots may transfer to civilian aviation and apply directly to airlines to become airline pilots.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nThose who are seeking a career as a professional pilot must meet FAA requirements. Pilots typically get their FAA-issued certificates and ratings in the following order:\n\nStudent pilot certificate\n\nPrivate pilot certificate\n\nInstrument rating\n\nCommercial pilot certificate\n\nMulti-engine rating\n\nAirline transport pilot certificate\n\nEach certificate and rating requires that pilots pass a knowledge test on the ground and a practical flying exam, usually called a check ride, in an appropriate aircraft. In addition to earning these credentials, many pilots get a flight instructor certificate after they get their commercial pilot certificate. The flight instructor certificate helps them build flight time and experience quickly and at less personal expense.\n\nCommercial pilot certificate. To qualify for a commercial pilot certificate, applicants must meet age and flight-hour requirements. Student pilots use a logbook and keep detailed records of their flight time, which must be endorsed by a flight instructor. Federal regulations specify the types and quantities of flight experience and knowledge needed.\n\nApplicants must pass the appropriate medical exam, meet all of the detailed flight experience and knowledge requirements, and pass a written exam and a practical flight exam in order to get a commercial pilot certificate. The medical exam confirms that the pilot’s vision is correctable to 20/20 and that no physical or mental conditions exist that could impair the pilot’s performance.\n\nCommercial pilots must hold an instrument rating if they want to carry passengers for pay more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight, or at night.\n\nInstrument rating. Pilots who earn an instrument rating can fly during periods of low visibility, also known as instrument meteorological conditions, or IMC. They may qualify for this rating by having at least 40 hours of instrument flight experience and 50 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot in command, and by meeting other requirements detailed in the federal regulations.\n\nAirline transport pilot (ATP) certificate. All pilot crews of a scheduled commercial airliner must have ATP certificates. To earn the ATP certificate, applicants must meet certain federal requirements, such as for age, hours of flight, and written and practical exams. A commercial pilot certificate is a prerequisite for the ATP. Airline pilots usually maintain one or more aircraft-type ratings, which allow them to fly aircraft that require specific training, depending on the requirements of their particular airline.\n\nPilots must pass periodic physical and practical flight examinations to be able to perform the duties granted by their certificate.\n\nAdvancement\n\nCommercial pilots may advance to airline pilots after completing a degree, accruing required flight time, and obtaining an ATP certificate.\n\nAdvancement for airline pilots depends on a system of seniority outlined in collective bargaining contracts.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Pilots must speak clearly when conveying information to air traffic controllers and other crew members. They must also listen carefully for instructions.\n\nObservational skills. Pilots regularly watch over screens, gauges, and dials to make sure that all systems are in working order. They also need to maintain situational awareness by looking for other aircraft or obstacles. Pilots must be able to see clearly, be able to judge the distance between objects, and possess good color vision.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Pilots must be able to identify complex problems and figure out appropriate solutions. When a plane encounters turbulence, for example, pilots assess the weather conditions and request a change in route or altitude from air traffic control.\n\nQuick reaction time. Pilots must respond quickly, and with good judgment, to any impending danger.\n\nPay About this section\n\nAirline and Commercial Pilots\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2023\n\nAirline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers\n\n$219,140\n\nAircraft pilots and flight engineers\n\n$171,210\n\nCommercial pilots\n\n$113,080\n\nAir transportation workers\n\n$97,320\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$48,060\n\nThe median annual wage for airline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers was $219,140 in May 2023.
