It provides procedures and guidelines that help ensure research and non-research activities involving aviation are safely executed and remain compliant with the requirements set forth in Department of Energy (DOE) Order 440.2C (September 15, 2020) Aviation Management and Safety and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 CFR Part 107 Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems regulations, among other FAA requirements.\n\nThis Policy commonly includes links to FAA websites, which are continually revised. FAA requirements will be applied in those cases where DOE requirements do not provide specific direction.\n\nIn addition to describing LBNL‚Äôs policy regarding aviation safety, this document serves as the Berkeley Site Office (BSO) Aviation Implementation Document (AID) for LBNL.\n\nGeneral Safety Considerations\n\nAviation operations ‚Äì manned and unmanned ‚Äì present the potential for serious injury, death, and/or environmental/property damage. It is essential that operations, which LBNL employees lead or participate in, are performed in the safest practicable manner. The safety of personnel while participating in aviation activities and/or utilizing Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) supersedes all other project objectives.\n\nLBNL personnel are required to plan missions from a standpoint of safety. Should there be any doubt concerning the safe completion of a flight operation, every alternative method must be considered, including cancellation of the project. All operations must be formally authorized, and conducted in compliance with this Policy and applicable local, State or Federal regulations.\n\nDepartment of Energy ‚Äì Order 440.2C\n\nDOE Order 440.2C establishes significant review, risk analysis, and reporting requirements. It regulates contractor aviation operations, including those involving unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).\n\nLBNL personnel conducting manned or unmanned aircraft flight operations and/or using CAS must ensure that the requirements contained in DOE Order 440.2C and described in this chapter are met and that associated risks are assessed (see Appendix B and Appendix I).\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 CFR Part 107 establishes comprehensive requirements for operating UAS. The operation of UAS comprises the primary, but not only, focus of this chapter. The requirements set forth in this Policy apply to a broad range of unmanned aircraft types in addition to drones, including moored balloons, unmanned free balloons, and kites.\n\nLBNL personnel conducting unmanned aircraft flight operations must ensure that the requirements contained in FAA 14 CFR Part 107 or the DOE nationwide COA (and described in this chapter) are met and that associated risks are assessed. Comprehensive information regarding UAS can be accessed at the FAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems Portal. In addition, the LBNL Aviation Point of Contact (APOC) is available to support LBNL staff in successfully navigating unmanned aircraft requirements. See Appendix V. for contact information for the APOC and other key aviation personnel.\n\nCommercial Aviation Services\n\nThis Policy also addresses the requirements for using Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) to support research and non-research activities. The use of a CAS must be addressed in the Work Planning & Control (WPC) Activity for the project deploying CAS. Only CAS specifically approved by the DOE Office of Aviation Management (OAM) may be used during the course and scope of conducting research and non-research operations at LBNL. LBNL employees must select a CAS from the DOE Accepted Operators List when a scheduled commercial air carrier is not available to provide transportation. In the event an accepted CAS is not available, contact the APOC for assistance. See Section 48.1.8 for further information.\n\nOther Aircraft Types\n\nOther aircraft types, specifically unmanned free balloons, moored balloons and kites, are addressed in this Policy. See Sections 48.5.6 and 48.5.7 for additional information.\n\nReviews and Authorizations\n\nResearch and non-research aviation operations must be reviewed by the LBNL Aviation Point of Contact (APOC). Additionally, operations involving the use of UAS require review by the DOE Berkeley Site Office Aviation Safety Officer (ASO) and the OAM. All operations involving the use of manned and unmanned aircraft must be authorized per LBNL‚Äôs Work Planning & Control (WPC) program.\n\nAviation Safety Plans (ASP) are the primary means for planning, vetting, and approving research or non-research flight operations involving UAS, including drones, moored balloons, unmanned free balloons, and kites. An ASP provides a detailed description of project objectives and outlines the risks associated with planned flight operations. The ASP contains the core documentation that informs the WPC Activity for the project.\n\nFederal Aviation Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS) Reporting Requirements\n\nAll activities, costs and inventories associated with CAS, Non-DOE owned UAS regardless of value, and Federally owned aircraft, (including UAS) with value greater than $500,000.00, must be reported via FAIRS. The APOC will support FAIRS reporting at least annually for required aviation activities/costs/inventories except CAS which must be reported quarterly. If no CAS activities occur, FAIRS reporting is not required.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis Policy does not apply to situations involving aircraft responding to medical or other emergencies on site. In those rare cases, operational decisions (including choice of landing site) will be deferred to LBNL‚Äôs site security authority. LBNL does not provide on-site facilities for rotating wing (helicopter) or fixed wing (airplane/glider) maintenance and operations.\n\n48.1 Scope and Applicability\n\nThe scope of this chapter is all aircraft operations at LBNL including (but not limited to) manned aircraft, drones, moored and free balloons, kites, and small UAS (drones). The chapter applies to all LBNL employees, affiliates, and commercial aviation service (CAS) providers contracted by LBNL. This chapter also serves as BSO‚Äôs Aviation Implementation Document (AID) for LBNL.\n\n48.2 Exceptions\n\nRequests for exceptions to this chapter must be made to LBNL APOC and approved by both the ASO and the ASM. The LBNL APOC will vet requests for exception and then forward them first to the ASM and the ASM forwards the request to the ASO. This process can be expected to take on the order of 4 weeks.\n\n48.3 Roles and Responsibilities\n\nAviation safety roles and responsibilities at LBNL derive from DOE Order 440.2C and FAA Part 107 regulations. Starting with the DOE Office of Aviation Management, those roles and responsibilities are as follows.\n\nPosition (Role)\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDirector, Office of Aviation Management\n\nDesignated as the Senior Aviation Management Official (SAMO) for the Department of Energy in accordance with the requirements of Title 41 CFR Part 102-33.

Prepares the Aviation Safety Plan (ASP) including safety analysis and airworthiness documents. Completes and submits FAA Certificate of Authorization request and documentation. Completes Berkeley Lab documentation via WPC. Conducts work in accordance with Policy.\n\nThe applicable Principal Investigator, Field Site Manager or designee (Requestor) is responsible for the following:\n\nEnsures that WPC documents including the ASP required for UAS operations are approved and current.\n\nVerifies the training and qualification of the RPIC and VO.\n\nCoordinates with the RPIC for Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs; see Appendix G).\n\nServes as the point of contact (POC) for users conducting UAS operations at the field site.\n\nCoordinates any site infrastructure needed by users to conduct UAS operations, including frequency spectrum approval.\n\nReviews monthly flight reports generated by the LBNL APOC or his designee to verify accuracy.\n\nAssists the LBNL APOC in ensuring compliance with this chapter.\n\nEstablishes the science objective for each flight and conveys the objectives to the RPIC.\n\nIn conjunction with the RPIC, determines the flight paths needed to safely achieve the science objectives.\n\nIn conjunction with the RPIC, establishes both the minimum and optimum weather requirements for flight in advance of the campaign.\n\nVerifies and monitors payload operability and data transmission before and during flight as applicable.\n\nProvides input/requests to the RPIC during each flight regarding changes that may be needed in the flight pattern (e.g., altitude; loitering) to facilitate achieving the science objectives.\n\nLBNL Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC)\n\nThe Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) is directly responsible for and is the final on-site authority as to the operation of the UAS. The RPIC also is responsible for compliance with Aviation Safety Program requirements, including holding a valid FAA Part 107 Small UAS Pilot Certificate. See Appendix D for further information regarding RPIC responsibilities.\n\nLBNL Visual Observers (VO)\n\nThe VO has the responsibility to advise the RPIC of eminent hazards to flight. The VO must be able to see the UAS with vision that is unaided by any device other than corrective lenses throughout the entire flight.\n\nLBNL Maintenance Technician (MT)\n\nRepairs and modifies sUAS and ground control station and software.\n\nAttaches and removes payloads to UAS as and if needed.\n\nAttests to UAS airworthiness, including weight and balance for the duration of each flight, after payload installation or removal, repair, replacement, maintenance, or modification.\n\nRecords maintenance and/or modifications in the UAS maintenance log.\n\nNote: At LBNL RPICs, PIs, or VOs are typically also qualified as MTs and thus a separate individual is generally not needed to function as an MT.\n\n48.4 Definitions\n\n48.5 Operational Requirements\n\n48.5.1 Standards of Performance\n\nStandards of performance are governed by the following regulatory agencies:\n\nDepartment of Energy Order 440.2C\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) Title 14 CFR Part 107\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) Title 14 CFR Part 101\n\nLBNL aviation safety requirements will meet or exceed the standards of performance governed by these regulatory agencies. Irrespective of the governing regulations or LBNL requirements, managers or their designees are required to analyze work for hazards, authorize work to proceed, and ensure that work is performed within established controls.\n\nResearch and non-research work conducted by LBNL employees that involves the operation of UAS must be comprehensively addressed in an ASP, which includes the requirement for a risk assessment.\n\nThe use of a CAS for personnel or equipment transport is also governed by this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the use of scheduled (commercial) airlines. The use of CAS must be discussed in the WPC Activity.\n\nWith the exception of using scheduled commercial airlines for travel to and from research locations, all operations involving aircraft, manned and unmanned, must be authorized via WPC. An up-to-date ASP and current supplementary documentation must be included as attachments in each WPC Activity involving UAS.\n\nConsistent with Integrated Safety Management (ISM), LBNL employees shall, in addition to defining the work they plan to perform, identify, evaluate, and control hazards in order to ensure aircraft operations are conducted safely and in a manner that protects personnel, property, the environment, and the public. In UAS operations, the feedback and improvement portion of the ISM process is carried out via a post-flight debriefing. Opportunities for improvement should be incorporated into future flight operations and shared with the LBNL aviation community as well as through other means of widespread communication to other DOE sites, including but not limited to Lessons Learned. ASPs may be revised at any time and those revisions MUST be communicated to flight crews. When an ASP is revised, the owner must notify their Division Safety Coordinator and the APOC, who must concur with the revisions.\n\n48.5.2 Research and Non-Research Aviation Activities\n\nThere are two broad categories of LBNL aviation-related activities. ‚ÄúAviation-related activities,‚Äù per se, is a general phrase that may involve any type of aircraft. It is divided into two categories:\n\nResearch\n\nNon-research\n\nBoth categories of aviation-related activities may involve remotely controlled and/or operated aircraft, or LBNL personnel on board an aircraft during flight.\n\nNote: balloons and kites, which are sometimes deployed as research operation platforms, are considered to be UAS. Under no circumstance are LBNL employees permitted to conduct research as passengers in a manned balloon.\n\nAll aviation-related activities must be reviewed by the APOC and approved by line management in a WPC Activity. Those involving UAS must also be vetted with the ASO and reviewed by the OAM.\n\n48.5.3 Aviation Safety Plans\n\nWith the exception of using scheduled commercial airlines, every aviation-related activity involving UAS, balloons or kites (both research and non-research, as applicable) must be described in a comprehensive Aviation Safety Plan (ASP) and submitted to the APOC for review and approval.\n\nNote: unless it is included as an element of operating a UAS, the use of CAS does not require an ASP; however, it must be described in a WPC Activity. Any supporting documentation should also be submitted to the APOC during the WPC Activity approval process.\n\nSince the DOE is involved in the review and approval of aviation missions, submission of an ASP should be made as early as possible in the planning stages of a mission. It is recommended that the ASP and supporting documentation be submitted to the DSC and APOC 60 days prior to the anticipated mission date. In general, once an ASP is presented to the DOE for initial review, subsequent revisions to the ASP are reviewed by the APOC and, as warranted, the ASO.\n\nSee Appendix E for an example Aviation Safety Plan.\n\n48.5.4 Project Review and Approval Process\n\nAll experimental equipment provided as a UAS payload by LBNL must be reviewed for safety hazards prior to installation on an aircraft (manned or unmanned). The Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) who will operate or supervise the operation of a UAS (including balloons and kites) carrying a payload has the final authority as to what type of equipment can be carried on the aircraft.\n\nAviation-related projects require advance planning, which includes the following steps:\n\nDetermine whether the use of manned or unmanned aircraft is necessary for the proposed project.\n\nDetermine the type of aircraft needed to meet project goals, including the use of CAS and complete the Aviation Mission Request (AMR) form.\n\nContact the APOC for guidance, including the procedures and timing for procuring sUAS and approvals.\n\nNote: It is conceivable that a research project could require the use of a CAS not on the DOE Accepted Operator List. In such cases, when a CAS is not listed, LBNL is required to request a review of the operator by the DOE prior to using the service. This is a complex process and requesting an ‚Äúoff list‚Äù CAS is discouraged. In any event, LBNL personnel may not use operators who are not on the DOE Accepted Operator List.\n\nDevelop an ASP for the project, including required supporting documentation.\n\nVet the ASP with the DSC and the APOC. Following review and approval, the APOC will forward the ASP and other required documentation to the ASO, who will review and forward to the OAM for final review and comment.\n\nOnce the ASP and other required documentation have been approved, develop a WPC Activity.\n\nCategorize the project as either research or non-research. For reference:\n\nResearch Operations\n\nBroadly described as involving the transport of personnel or the use of DOE-owned or other experimental equipment on board an aircraft for research purposes. This includes, as applicable:\n\nUAS less than 55 pounds\n\nUnmanned free balloons\n\nMoored balloons or kites\n\nCAS (transporting passengers and/or equipment)\n\nNote: the use of manned balloons for research operations is not permitted under any circumstance.\n\nNon-Research Operations\n\nBroadly described as projects undertaken for the purposes of photography, videography, or surveillance, and which do not involve transporting LBNL personnel or experimental equipment onboard an aircraft.\n\nNote: non-research flight operations do not generally involve the use of unmanned balloons and kites, and are NOT allowed to involve the use of manned balloons. Under unusual circumstances, non-research operations may require the use of CAS.\n\n48.5.5 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones)\n\nThis section applies to staff planning to operate drones less than 55 pounds (including payload) in Class G airspace, typically under the DOE nationwide COA. Operations in other classes of airspace are possible under Part 107 rules, typically requiring FAA approval. Such aircraft and their control systems are typically available commercially.\n\nLBNL personnel may not operate UAS (including payload) greater than 55 pounds.\n\nRefer to Sections 48.1.6 and 48.1.7 for requirements related to unmanned free balloons and moored balloons/kites, respectively.\n\nThe steps outlined in the following subsection are required prior to operating drone-type UAS as part of LBNL work.\n\n48.5.5.1 Planning and Obtaining Approval for Flying a small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) or ‚ÄúDrone‚Äù\n\nPlanning to Fly\n\nThe following steps shall be followed when planning a project involving a drone (UAS) locally (e.g., practice flights) or conducting operational flights in the field. Contact the APOC well in advance of planned flight operations when requesting approval. This will help ensure a clear understanding of what is involved in obtaining approval to operate a drone during the course and scope of conducting LBNL business.\n\nProvide the following documentation to the APOC with your request to conduct UAS operations per LBNL‚Äôs WPC process:\n\nAviation Mission Request (AMR) Form (typically submitted when initiating contact with the APOC).\n\nThe ASP. This is typically developed by the Principle Investigator (PI), RPIC or WPC Activity Lead, reviewed by the APOC and submitted to the ASO, who will forward it to the DOE-OAM. See Appendix E for an example Aviation Safety Plan.\n\nThe UAS Notification to DOE-OAM Senior Aviation Manager (Form 19). See Appendix F.\n\nThe WPC Activity number. The WPC Description of Work primarily summarizes what is included in the ASP, which resides as an attachment in the Activity.\n\nComplete a WPC Activity for review by the DSC, EHS Division Liaison, and APOC. It is recommended that the Activity Lead begin developing the WPC Activity in advance of OAM approval. The APOC can be consulted as needed for guidance regarding the WPC Activity, but will primarily be focused on the content of the ASP.\n\nThe WPC Activity must include as attachments the following documents, which are also required to be included in the completed ASP:\n\nDrone registration\n\nDrone manufacturer manual (may be via link)\n\nPart 107 Pilot Certification document (for each RPIC)\n\nCurrent Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA), unless conducting flights under Part 107.\n\nUAS Notification to DOE-OAM Senior Aviation Manager\n\n440.2C Public Aircraft Operations Declaration (Appendix N)\n\nThese documents can be readily updated in the ASP that is attached to the WPC Activity. Since some of these documents are routinely revised (e.g., RPIC certificates and COA), it is more efficient to make changes to the ASP document than to continually update the WPC Activity.\n\nProvide a certificate of insurance for collaborators on an LBNL project (e.g., non-LBNL personnel) who must fly an LBNL-owned UAS and serve as FAA Part 107 certified RPICs (i.e., not fly under the supervision of an LBNL RPIC). Generally, flying LBNL-owned UAS by non-LBNL employees, even when done so under the supervision of an RPIC, is discouraged but not prohibited. The certificate of insurance for a non-LBNL RPIC who will fly an LBNL-owned UAS must be vetted with the APOC, who will consult with LBNL Risk Management or designee.\n\nVendors and subcontractors are not allowed to fly on LBNL property, irrespective of experience or certification status. In extreme cases requiring the expertise of a vendor, the project will be vetted in the same manner as it would be for an LBNL employee. Contact the APOC for guidance.\n\nNon-LBNL personnel are not permitted to fly LBNL-owned sUAS unless expressly authorized in the ASP and WPC Activity. When this is the case, they must be directly supervised by the LBNL RPIC.\n\nLBNL personnel who fly a UAS as a participant on a host project must hold a 107 Pilot Certification. In contrast to LBNL projects, where an uncertified LBNL pilot may fly under the direct supervision of an FAA certified RPIC, an uncertified LBNL person may not fly under the direct supervision of a certified host RPIC. Under the host project condition, an ASP is not required, but any work done as a participant on a host project must be covered in an approved WPC Activity.\n\nNight flights are allowed for both COA flights and Part 107 flights. However, such flights must be approved by APOC as part of the WPC and the ASP. In addition, all such flights must meet current requirements of Part 107 or the COA, whichever is applicable.\n\nPurchasing a Drone\n\nFollow the rules when purchasing an UAS. Drones and components (UAS) are considered restricted items. The LBNL Procurement Department has established a process that assures drone and related components are approved prior to executing the purchase. Purchasing a drone and components (including the primary platform) requires advance review and approval by the APOC (or designee). This process is regulated by LBNL Procurement Policy.\n\nProspective RPICs are not permitted to purchase a UAS outside LBNL‚Äôs procurement process. If it is deemed necessary to purchase a drone in advance of securing OAM and WPC authorizations, secure final division and APOC (or designee) approvals.\n\nThere are or may be restrictions on the purchase of UAS that are or may be manufactured in adversary countries. Designation of ‚Äúadversary‚Äù status is subject to change. Contact the APOC prior to initiating the purchase of a drone.\n\nThe possession of a drone does not automatically permit flying. RPICs must possess an FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate and undergo complete vetting prior to initiating flight operations. Vetting includes development of both an approved ASP and WPC Activity. Only after vetting and full approval is the RPIC allowed to begin practice or mission flight operations, which must include a Visual Observer (VO). The Remote Pilot Certificate must be renewed every 2 years as described in Appendix U.\n\n48.5.5.2. Operating a Drone\n\nGeneral Requirements: The Basics\n\nLBNL drone operations occur in ‚Äúpublic airspace.‚Äù The DOE holds and periodically renews a COA for this purpose, and RPICs and crew members are required to be knowledgeable regarding its content and intent. This Policy provides the latest version of the DOE COA. See Appendix M. Typically it is advantageous for LBNL staff meeting the requirements of this policy to fly under the DOE COA. For example, the COA allows for flights up to 1200 feet AGL in Class G airspace. However, staff may have needs to fly in other airspace classes, in which case staff may also fly under FAA‚Äôs Part 107 rules (limited to 400 feet AGL). Flights under FAA Part 017 are reported differently that under DOE‚Äôs nationwide COA (see Item N under ‚ÄúSpecific Requirements‚Äù below)\n\nLBNL employees are required to carefully plan flight operations, including practice flights, per the ASP and WPC Activity. Daily assessment of hazards and other risks must be evaluated prior to each flight. When material changes in the flying environment are anticipated or encountered, it is the responsibility of the RPIC to account for those changes and revise the flight plans, including ceasing flight operation if necessary. The RPIC is responsible for briefing flight crews, including the VO, prior to commencing flight operations and for logging and reporting all flights (Appendix C).\n\nThe UC Richmond Field Station (RFS) is available to LBNL pilots and crew for practice and research flights. In order to use the facility, it must be reserved using the following link to schedule requests ‚Äìhttps://ucbrfs.dronefms.net/.\n\nContact Justin Cocke ‚Äì justincocke@berkeley.edu at 510-220-2712 for questions regarding the use of RFS for drone flights. See Appendix T for additional information.\n\nChange management is a critical element of flight operations. While the Hazard Risk Analysis included in the ASP addresses a range of hazards and consequences, it cannot account for changes in the immediate operating environment. As a guideline, when the Hazard Risk Assessment no longer reflects the likelihood and consequence of issues associated with the project, flight operations must stop and be reevaluated. It is up to the RPIC to modify the Hazard Risk Assessment section of the ASP to reflect changes in project risks that were not initially anticipated.\n\nSpecific Requirements\n\nRPICs, VOs and crews are responsible for remaining current with applicable DOE and FAA regulations and ensuring compliance during flight operations, as follows (see also Appendix D):\n\nRPICs must ensure flights are compliant with the conditions of the DOE COA and related requirements (in addition to height and airspace limitations) or compliant with 14 CFR 107 in addition to best flying practices. See Appendix L for a concise summary of the DOE COA and Appendix M for the current DOE COA.\n\nPer the DOE COA, RPICs must remain in Class G Airspace during flight operations. Flights in other than Class G airspace are possible, but require that the RPIC fly under Part 107 rules.\n\nDuring UAS activities, RPICs must carry documentation of completion of either the FAA Remote Pilot Certificate with a small UAS rating or the Part 61 Private Pilot Certificate. RPICs must also provide a photo ID to support their Remote Pilot Certificate.\n\nRPICs must carry the ASP, which contains all other relevant documents such as aircraft registration and the COA.\n\nLBNL flight operations are limited to flying no higher than 400 feet above ground level (AGL) in spite of the fact that the COA allows flight up to 1200 feet AGL. Requests for exceptions are routinely granted for flights under the COA in Class G airspace only, but require specific APOC approval. Once approval is obtained and when flying under Part 107, LAANC may be invoked to fly at AGL greater than 400 feet (see Appendix O).\n\nLBNL flight operations are typically approved for daylight hours. Both the COA and Part 107 rules permit night flights, so night flight operations can be approved if included in the WPC and the ASP.\n\nLBNL flight operations are not permitted over people. Requests for exceptions require APOC approval and must meet the current requirements under Part 107.\n\nLBNL flight operations are not permitted over moving vehicles. Requests for exceptions require APOC approval and must meet the current requirements under Part 107.\n\nDrones must be maintained in safe operating condition and pilots must confirm this prior to each flight.\n\nRPIC and crew must complete a pre-flight checklist. See Appendix H for a model pre-flight checklist. The checklist used must effectively cover the items in the model pre-flight checklist.\n\nThe aircraft registration number must be clearly visible on the outside of the drone.\n\nBeginning approximately September 16, 2023, all UAS will be required to be equipped with remote identification. See Appendix R.\n\nDrones must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) and must yield right of way to other aircraft (manned or unmanned).\n\nThe RPIC or designee must provide a monthly report, including maintenance and number of hours flown (including zero), to the APOC or designee. A standardized spreadsheet used by DOE-OAM is provided to all RPICs for monthly reporting.\n\nThe APOC (or delegate) submits the monthly report of LBNL drone activities conducted under the DOE Nationwide COA to the Director of DOE-OAM and copies the ASO. The APOC retains a record of monthly reports.\n\nFor operations under 14 CFR 107, the cognizant DOE Aviation Safety Manager (or delegate) reports ongoing Part 107 operations to MA-30 via an email detailing Part 107 operations as they occur.\n\nAll mishaps/accidents must be reported to the APOC within 12 hours to determine if the FAA needs to be notified. This is outlined in the DOE COA. Depending on the type of event, the FAA must be notified within 10 days. The APOC will notify the ASO, who will notify DOE-OAM. See Appendix J.\n\nRPICs must maintain currency with each drone model they fly by conducting at least 3 takeoffs and landings every 90 day.\n\nIf currency is not maintained, it can be regained by conducting practice 3 takeoffs and landing prior to conducting mission flights. Such flights must be documented in the RPICs log book and ideally are observed by an LBNL pilot who has maintained his or her currency.\n\nThe RPIC or designee must file a NOTAMs when flying under the DOE COA (see Appendix G). When flying under Part 107, filing an ‚ÄúUnmanned Aircraft Operating area (UAO) at www.1800wxbrief.com typically will suffice.\n\nRespond to suspicious UAS or other aviation activity (Appendix K).\n\nFollow guidance in Appendix S when interacting with the public, particularly if individuals appear to be hostile to UAS operations.\n\nReport UAS inventory and costs to the APOC for FAIRS reporting, if required. Federally owned UAS with value less than $500,000.00 are exempt from FAIRS reporting. Non-Federally owned UAS are subject to FAIRS reporting. It is recommended that all UAS be purchased as Federally owned property. If project circumstances require non-federal ownership of a drone, FAIRS reporting costs may be charged to the project.\n\n48.5.5.3 Data Management\n\nAll data from sUAS flights are downloaded, backed up and processed in accordance with project goals, objectives and requirements, and LBNL Data Management Policy (https://commons.lbl.gov/display/itdivision/Data+Management).\n\n48.5.5.4 Summary of Work Processes for UAS1,2\n\n48.5.6 Unmanned Free Balloons\n\n48.5.6.1 Applicability\n\nUnmanned free balloons penetrate National Air Space and therefore may pose a hazard to military and civilian aviation operations. Under no circumstance shall an LBNL employee release an unmanned balloon during the course of conducting research without prior formal authorization and making required notifications.\n\nUnmanned free balloon operators at LBNL must include balloon flights in their WPC Activity documentation and the APOC must be included in the review and approval process. The WPC Activity must document that the balloon operator clearly understands free balloon operational requirements as specified by the FAA, and demonstrates the ability to comply with those requirements.\n\nFor further information, see FAA regulations for unmanned free balloons.\n\n48.5.6.2 Operating Limitations\n\nUnmanned free balloons may not be operated under the following conditions:\n\nUnless otherwise authorized by ATC, below 2,000 feet above ground level (AGL) within the lateral boundaries of the surface areas of Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E airspace designated for an airport;\n\nAt any altitude where there are clouds or obscuring phenomena of more than five-tenths coverage;\n\nAt any altitude below 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude where the horizontal visibility is less than five miles;\n\nDuring the first 1,000 feet of ascent, over a congested area of a city, town, or settlement or an open-air assembly of persons not associated with the operation; or\n\nIn such a manner that impact of the balloon, or part thereof including its payload, with the surface creates a hazard to persons or property not associated with the operation.\n\n48.5.6.3 Equipment and Marking Requirements\n\nNo unmanned free balloon may be operated unless the following conditions are met:\n\nIt is equipped with at least two payload cut-down systems or devices that operate independently of each other;\n\nAt least two methods, systems, devices, or combinations thereof, that function independently of each other, are employed for terminating the flight of the balloon envelope; and\n\nThe balloon envelope is equipped with a radar reflective device(s) or material that will present an echo to surface radar operating in the 200 MHz to 2700 MHz frequency range.\n\nThe operator shall activate the appropriate flight termination devices required by the paragraphs above when weather conditions are less than those prescribed for operation as outlined below, or if a malfunction or any other reason makes the further operation hazardous to other air traffic or to persons and property on the surface.\n\n48.5.6.4 Additional Restrictions\n\nOperation of an unmanned free balloon below 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude between sunset and sunrise (as corrected to the altitude of operation) is prohibited unless the balloon and its attachments and payload, whether or not they become separated during the operation, are equipped with lights that are visible for at least 5 miles and have a flash frequency of at least 40, and not more than 100 cycles per minute.\n\nOperation of an unmanned free balloon that is equipped with a trailing antenna that requires an impact force of more than 50 pounds to break it at any point is prohibited unless the antenna has colored pennants or streamers that are attached at not more than 50 foot intervals and that are visible for at least one mile.\n\nNo person may operate between sunrise and sunset, an unmanned free balloon that is equipped with a suspension device (other than a highly conspicuously colored open parachute) more than 50 feet long, unless the suspension device is colored in alternate bands of high conspicuity colors or has colored pennants or streamers attached which are visible for at least one mile.\n\n48.5.6.5 Notice Requirements\n\nThe following information outlines required notifications.\n\nPre-launch notice\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph B of this section, LBNL personnel not may operate an unmanned free balloon unless, within 6 to 24 hours before beginning the operation, the following information is provided to the FAA Air Traffic Control Center (ATC) facility that is nearest to the place of intended operation:\n\nThe balloon identification.\n\nThe estimated date and time of launching, amended as necessary to remain within plus or minus 30 minutes.\n\nThe location of the launching site.\n\nThe cruising altitude.\n\nThe forecast trajectory and estimated time to cruising altitude or 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude, whichever is lower.\n\nThe length and diameter of the balloon, length of the suspension device, weight of the payload, and length of the trailing antenna.\n\nThe duration of flight.\n\nThe forecast time and location of impact with the surface of the earth.\n\nFor solar or cosmic disturbance investigations involving a critical time element, the information in paragraph (a) of this section shall be given within 30 minutes to 24 hours before beginning the operation.\n\nCancellation notice\n\nIf the operation is canceled, the person who intended to conduct the operation shall immediately notify the nearest FAA ATC facility.\n\nLaunch notice\n\nEach person operating an unmanned free balloon shall notify the nearest FAA or military ATC facility of the launch time immediately after the balloon is launched.\n\nBalloon position reports\n\nEach person operating an unmanned free balloon shall:\n\nUnless ATC requires otherwise, monitor the course of the balloon and record its position at least every two hours; and\n\nForward any balloon position reports requested by ATC.\n\nOne hour before beginning descent, each person operating an unmanned free balloon shall forward to the nearest FAA ATC facility the following information regarding the balloon:\n\nThe current geographical position.\n\nThe altitude.\n\nThe forecast time of penetration of 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude (if applicable).\n\nThe forecast trajectory for the balance of the flight.\n\nThe forecast time and location of impact with the surface of the earth.\n\nIf a balloon position report is not recorded for any two-hour period of flight, the person operating an unmanned free balloon shall immediately notify the nearest FAA ATC facility. The notice shall include the last recorded position and any revision of the forecast trajectory. The nearest FAA ATC facility shall be notified immediately when tracking of the balloon is re-established.\n\nEach person operating an unmanned free balloon shall notify the nearest FAA ATC facility when the operation is ended.\n\n48.5.6.6 Data Management\n\nAll data from unmanned free balloon flights must be downloaded, backed up and processed in accordance with project goals, objectives and requirements, and LBNL Data Management Policy (https://commons.lbl.gov/display/itdivision/Data+Management).\n\n48.5.6.7 Summary of Work Processes for Unmanned Free Balloons1, 2\n\n48.5.7 Moored Balloons and Kites\n\nMoored balloons and kites are rarely used at LBNL. However, due to the changing nature of research, there may be occasions where they are needed. Moored balloon operators must include such flights in their WPC documentation, including the APOC, in the review and approval process. The WPC must document that the operator clearly understands moored balloon and kite operational requirements specified by the FAA and demonstrate ability to comply with those requirements.\n\nThis section addresses the operation of moored balloons and kites per FAA requirements.\n\nFor further information, see FAA regulations for moored balloons and kites.\n\n48.5.7.1 Applicability\n\nThis subpart applies to the operation of moored balloons and kites. However, a person operating a moored balloon or kite within a restricted area must comply only with ¬ß101.19 and with additional limitations imposed by the using or controlling agency, as appropriate.\n\n48.5.7.2 Operating Limitations\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may operate a moored balloon or kite:\n\nLess than 500 feet from the base of any cloud;\n\nMore than 500 feet above the surface of the earth;\n\nFrom an area where the ground visibility is less than three miles; or\n\nWithin five miles of the boundary of any airport.\n\nParagraph (a) of this section does not apply to the operation of a balloon or kite below the top of any structure and within 250 feet of it, if that shielded operation does not obscure any lighting on the structure.\n\n48.5.7.3 Notice Requirements\n\nNo person may operate an unshielded moored balloon or kite more than 150 feet above the surface of the earth unless, at least 24 hours before beginning the operation, he gives the following information to the FAA ATC facility that is nearest to the place of intended operation:\n\nThe names and addresses of the owners and operators.\n\nThe size of the balloon or the size and weight of the kite.\n\nThe location of the operation.\n\nThe height above the surface of the earth at which the balloon or kite is to be operated.\n\nThe date, time, and duration of the operation.\n\n48.5.7.4 Lighting and Marking Requirements\n\nNo person may operate a moored balloon or kite, between sunset and sunrise unless the balloon or kite, and its mooring lines, are lighted so as to give a visual warning equal to that required for obstructions to air navigation in the FAA publication ‚ÄúObstruction Marking and Lighting‚Äù.\n\nNo person may operate a moored balloon or kite between sunrise and sunset unless its mooring lines have colored pennants or streamers attached at not more than 50 foot intervals beginning at 150 feet above the surface of the earth and visible for at least one mile.\n\n48.5.7.5 Rapid Deflation Device\n\nNo person may operate a moored balloon unless it has a device that will automatically and rapidly deflate the balloon if it escapes from its moorings. If the device does not function properly, the operator shall immediately notify the nearest ATC facility of the location and time of the escape and the estimated flight path of the balloon.\n\n48.5.7.6 Data Management\n\nAll data from tethered balloon and kite flights must be downloaded, backed up and processed in accordance with project goals, objectives and requirements, and LBNL Data Management Policy (https://commons.lbl.gov/display/itdivision/Data+Management).\n\n48.5.7.7 Summary of work processes for moored balloons and kites 1, 2\n\n48.5.8 Commercial Aviation Services (CAS)\n\n48.5.8.1 Introduction\n\nPer DOE regulations, Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) include all contractual and collaborative arrangements for:\n\nLeased aircraft,\n\nAircraft chartered or rented for exclusive or non-exclusive use,\n\nFull services (i.e., aircraft maintenance providers, aircraft, and related aviation services for exclusive use) contracted for or obtained through an inter-service support agreement (ISSA), regardless of the length of the contract or agreement, or\n\nAviation services (i.e., services but not aircraft) obtained by commercial contract or ISSA, except those services acquired to support a Federal aircraft.\n\nLBNL does not own, operate, maintain or host manned aircraft. The only requirement applicable to LBNL operations is addressed in Item B above.\n\nThis applies to commercial, government, or private entity aircraft that are funded by LBNL via contractual agreement or that arise from a collaborative arrangement between LBNL and other entities.\n\n48.5.8.2 Applicability\n\nThis section applies to the utilization of aircraft that are chartered, leased, or government owned and used during the course and scope of LBNL business. It does not apply to the use of scheduled (commercial) airlines.\n\nCAS requirements also do not apply to contractual agreements or collaborative arrangements where the vendor or collaborator supplies data or interpretations, where LBNL data collection equipment is not flown and LBNL employees are not transported. Under those circumstances, LBNL employees have no involvement in flight chartering, planning or execution of data collection during flights.\n\n48.5.8.3 Operating Limitations\n\nDOE Order 440.2C requires confirmation ‚Äì via vetting with the APOC ‚Äì that a CAS has been selected from the DOE Accepted Operators List prior to entering into a purchase order to charter aircraft services of any type. This applies to both transport of employees and equipment.\n\nThe APOC will consult with the ASO when questions regarding the use of CAS. In particular, when a CAS is not on the Accepted Operators List but its services are desired, a request may be submitted for consideration. Supporting documentation must be created and submitted with the CAS request. The DOE is involved in the review and approval of aviation missions, and any submittal should be made as early as possible in the planning stages of a mission and in no case less than 60 days prior to the anticipated mission date.\n\nNote: a request to use a non-listed commercial aviation services provider must be processed by the LBNL APOC in collaboration with the ASO. The APOC will not proceed unless there are extremely compelling reasons to do so. Every effort should be made to identify a scheduled air carrier or a listed commercial air service.\n\nCommercial air carriers operating under 14 CFR Part 135 are excluded from this requirement. Contact the APOC for assistance in complying with the CAS requirements contained in DOE Order 440.2C.\n\nLBNL does not own or operate a landing field, so its use of CAS operators will be limited to off-site field research situations. The following requirements will apply:\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all aviation operations purchased will be conducted during daylight hours and will strictly adhere to, and comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Regulations.\n\nBefore mission operations commence, the person responsible for the aviation charter-service purchase will obtain the model of the aircraft, name of the aircraft operator and telephone number, name of the pilot in command.\n\nLBNL employees may only ride on accepted CAS operator aircraft if previously authorized as ‚Äúessential‚Äù by the division director or deputy.\n\nAll CAS operations must be reviewed by the APOC and approved by the Associate Laboratory Director (ALD) for Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) prior to commencing operations.\n\nFirst Notice of Intent to Use a Non-Scheduled CAS\n\nThe research must notify the APOC prior to initiating the authorization process. This is done using the Aviation Mission Request (AMR) Form. This is an initial notification to begin the process, not an authorization to fly or seek approval to use flying service not already on the DOE CAS list.\n\nDetermine if the use of aircraft is necessary for the conduct of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) business. For assistance, contact the APOC.\n\nAssign a Responsible Person who ensures that all necessary information is provided to the APOC using the Aviation Mission Request (AMR) Form.\n\nObtain approval to pursue aviation operations from the Division or Area management.\n\nCategorize the aviation mission type as either non-research or research.\n\n48.5.8.4 Safety Hazard Review\n\nAll experimental equipment provided by LBNL must be reviewed for safety hazards prior to installation on an aircraft. This review should be conducted by the WPC Activity Lead or RPIC, and the APOC. The RPIC is in the best position to determine what type of equipment may be carried on the CAS aircraft, but the CAS pilot has the final authority to determine what will be carried on the CAS aircraft.\n\n48.5.8.5 Collaboration with other entities\n\nLBNL staff commonly collaborate with other entities including, but not limited to, other national laboratories, government agencies, universities, public or private institutions, and private corporations. If no funds are exchanged, such collaborations do not qualify as CAS. However, if aviation is involved, LBNL staff must seek direction and approval of the APOC. Examples include:\n\nFlying LBNL experimental equipment on board another entity‚Äôs aircraft as part of a collaborative project.\n\nFlying another entity‚Äôs equipment on board an LBNL aircraft, most likely a UAS.\n\nFlying as a guest scientist on another entity‚Äôs aircraft.\n\nThese or similar activities involving aviation are relatively rare and are therefore vetted and approved on a case-by-case basis through the APOC, who will determine the level of management approval and inclusion in work authorization documents as required based on the risk profile of the aviation activity. LBNL encourages such collaborations and the APOC will seek to expedite approvals as appropriate. Significant lead time may be required to validate the safety, for example, of flying LNBL equipment on a collaborator‚Äôs aircraft.\n\n48.5.8.6 Data Management\n\nAll data from CAS flights must be downloaded, backed up and processed in accordance with project goals, objectives and requirements, and LBNL Data Management Policy (https://commons.lbl.gov/display/itdivision/Data+Management).\n\n48.5.8.7 Summary of CAS work processes\n\n48.6 Training Requirements\n\nDOE Order 440.2c requires annual training for all individuals engaged in aviation activities. LBNL meets that requirement by scheduling training specific to the following sections of this Policy:\n\n48.5.5 Unmanned Aircraft Systems\n\n48.5.6 Unmanned free balloons\n\n48.5.7 Moored balloons and kites\n\n48.5.8 Commercial Aviation Services (CAS)\n\nIn cases where there is a lapse of activity in areas listed above that is longer than one year, training will be completed prior to restart of that activity.\n\nIt will also be possible to meet the aviation training requirement by completing the comprehensive aviation course provided by Embry-Riddle Aviation University (ERAU) through DOE HQ OAM.\n\nAdditional training is required by the FAA for UAS remote pilots. They are required to take recurrent training every two years or when new FAA regulations are implemented. The APOC or her/his designee tracks remote pilot certificate status and reminds remote pilots when recurrent training is due. Remote pilots must complete recurrent training on schedule in order to pilot sUAS for LBNL.\n\nSee Appendix A for additional information.\n\n48.7 Procurement Requirements\n\nAll UAS, balloons and kites and related equipment used for conducting LNBL work must be purchased through the LBNL procurement system. Procurement of such items triggers notification of the LBNL LBNL APOC who will then contact the requestor, if such contact has not already occured. LBNL APOC ensures that the requestor is fully conversant with this Chapter. The LBNL APOC also reviews the procurement request, usually in conjunction with the requestor, to ensure that the UAS meets LBNL and DOE requirements for general air worthiness, aircraft performance specifications, ground control station performance (including frequency spectrum) and cybersecurity. Using the collective knowledge and experience of the LBNL and DOE UAS community, the LBNL APOC will advise the requestor on the suitability of the planned purchase for its intended purpose. Requestors are encouraged to contact the LBNL APOC prior to submitting procurement documents. In addition, all procurement of UAS must comply with Executive Order 13981 (January 18, 2021).\n\n48.8 Maintenance Requirements\n\nMaintenance requirements, including required documentation, are based on the specific activity involved.\n\n48.8.1 Maintenance of UAS\n\nMost UAS currently in use by LBNL staff are purchased as complete systems with limited maintenance requirements specified by the manufacturer. In such systems, maintenance commonly only involves replacement of propellers when they show signs of wear. However, pre- and post-flight inspections are considered an essential component of maintenance.\n\nAll maintenance must be performed by an LBNL Maintenance Technician (MT) or an appropriately qualified RPIC, or VO. Maintenance activities include:\n\nRepairs and modifies UAS and ground control station and software, if needed.\n\nAttaching and removing payloads to UAS as and if needed.\n\nAttesting to UAS airworthiness, including weight and balance for the duration of each flight, after payload installation or removal, repair, replacement, maintenance, or modification.\n\nPerforming pre-and post-flight UAS inspections including airframe, payload (especially payload wiring connections) and rotors.\n\nAll maintenance must be documented in a UAS maintenance log specific to a particular UAS, or, in the case of pre-and post-flight inspections, in the RPIC‚Äôs flight log, or flight checklist.\n\nAircraft damage or performance issues without an obvious cause and means of correction, usually require that repairs be performed by the manufacturer or an authorized repair facility. Such repairs or modifications need to be documented as noted above.\n\nFor systems that are assembled from component parts, or that involve modification or change out of payloads, may require system testing and non-routine maintenance and updating of software. In such cases, maintenance, especially modifications to flight parameters must be reviewed by a second MT prior to flight and the review documented as part of the maintenance record.\n\n48.9 Source and Reference Documents\n\nU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n\nNote: In the event of a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù link, a starting point is the DOE Office of Aircraft Management web site: https://www.energy.gov/management/office-management/operational-management/aviation-management\n\nDOE Order 440.2C (5-15-20) Department of Energy (DOE) Order 440.2C (September 15, 2020)\n\nDOE Commercial Aviation Services Accepted Operators List\n\nNote: LBNL entities who hire or charter an aircraft service to conduct mission requirements may only select from the Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) Accepted Operators List.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n\nNote: Web links change from time to time.In the event of a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù link, a reliable starting point is the FAA web site https://www.faa.gov or, for example, one level down, the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) section of the FAA web site:https://www.faa.gov/uas/ .\n\n14 CFR Part 107 ‚Äì Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems\n\nhttp://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/18BECE69B1FE750786257FE00055D5C9?OpenDocument\n\nFAA ‚ÄìG-8082-22 ‚Äì Remote Pilot ‚Äì Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Study Guide\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf\n\nRegister Your Drone\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone\n\nBecome a Drone Pilot https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/#renew\n\nRenewing Your Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/#renew\n\nRegistering Your Drone with the FAA\n\nFAA UAS Flight Data Facility Maps\n\nTitle 14 CFR Part 107, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\nTitle 47 CFR Part 87, Aviation Services.\n\nB4UFLY (iOS and Android App)\n\nPART 101‚ÄîMOORED BALLOONS, KITES, AMATEUR ROCKETS, UNMANNED FREE BALLOONS, AND CERTAIN MODEL AIRCRAFT\n\n14 CFR 101 Subpart A ‚Äì Moored Balloons, Kites, Amateur Rockets, Unmanned free Balloons, and Certain Model Aircraft\n\n14 CFR 101 Subpart D ‚Äì Unmanned Free Balloons\n\nLBNL\n\nArea Work Planning and Control for Experiments and Operations Subject Area (https://wpc.lbl.gov/ )\n\nUniversity of California\n\nUC Center of Excellence Unmanned Aircraft System Safety\n\nhttps://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/environmental/program-resources/unmanned-aircraft-systems-safety.html\n\n48.10 Appendices\n\nAppendix A. Training and Certification Requirement for drone, balloon, and kite flight crewmembers\n\nRemote Pilot in Command (RPIC) Qualifications\n\nRemote Pilot in Command training shall include:\n\n14 CFR 107 remote pilot certificate required (drone flights only).\n\nManufacturer‚Äôs training program completion, if available.\n\nSite-specific training, if applicable\n\n18 years of age\n\nTraining on the specific UAS described in the ASP shall be documented and maintained with respect to:\n\nAirworthiness\n\nFlight characteristics\n\nWeight and balance\n\nLost communication procedure\n\nLoss of GPS/auto pilot\n\nManual flight/control\n\nGround control station (GSC) operation\n\nInitialization/checkout\n\nFrequencies and frequency mitigation/deconfliction\n\nLaunch, landing/flight termination\n\nNormal and emergency procedures\n\nLimitations\n\nDemonstrated competency by completing 10 hours of manual control of each UAS (5 hours of which may be logged via simulator), including an actual 20 manual take-offs and landings (i.e., not simulated); and documenting these items in the RPIC‚Äôs personal logbook.\n\nNote: A person who is not qualified as a RPIC may operate the UAS under the direct supervision of a qualified RPIC if the qualified RPIC can immediately take direct control of the UAS (e.g., using a buddy cord and separate control box).\n\nIn addition, the RPIC must have made three manual takeoffs/launches and recoveries/landings within the 90 days preceding the UAS operation with the specific UAS stated in the ASP to qualify as the RPIC for the UAS operation. Simulation trainers will not satisfy this requirement.\n\nVisual Observer (VO) Qualifications\n\nThe VO is a required position that provides increased situational awareness and safety to a UAS operation. The primary role of the VO is to see other traffic and hazards and report them to the RPIC. The VO fulfills the requirements set forth in 14 CFR Parts 91.111 and 91.113. The VO must have 20/20 (corrected) vision.\n\nVO training shall include:\n\nSite-specific training (e.g., site characteristics and requirements, COA requirements)\n\nInstruction on the flight characteristics and limitations described in the Aviation Safety Plan for the UAS they will be observing\n\nIdentifying weather changes and trends that could impact UAS operations\n\nUnderstanding cloud clearances, VFR minimums, minimum ceiling and visibility requirements based on the operating airspace and the ASP weather minimums\n\nCommunications to the RPIC\n\nRadio procedures and discipline\n\nIdentification of traffic and hazards to the RPIC with relative position and altitude\n\nDuring circling flight, the compass method is recommended\n\nDuring straight flight, the clock method is recommended\n\nCTAF and aircraft pattern entries and positions in a traffic pattern\n\nDemonstrated competency by directly observing at least 1 hour of UAS flights prior to serving as a VO.\n\nMaintenance Technician (MT) Qualifications\n\nThe MT maintains the UAS in airworthy condition per the OEM, FAA, and/or Airworthiness Statement.\n\nNote: At LBNL, the RPIC or VO typically perform this function.\n\nWhere applicable, the MO should be familiar with the basic operation of the UAS, and the technical documents and requirements to repair and maintain airworthiness of the UAS. Training on the specific UAS described in the ASP with respect to construction, repair techniques, system functions, troubleshooting, airworthiness criteria, operation, and flight dynamics and limitations. Training may be provided by the UAS manufacturer or by the maintenance technician reading the UAS manufacturer‚Äôs manuals and procedures.\n\nAppendix B. Risk Assessment for UAS, Balloon, and Kite Operations\n\nClick here to access Appendix B guidance.\n\nThis link provides access to the Risk Assessment protocol outlined in FAA Advisory Circular AC-107-2:\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac_107-2.pdf\n\nPlease note that the following points must be included in the risk assessment:\n\nAir Traffic: Risk due to proximity to flight operations at regional airport or airfield.\n\nAircraft Hazards: Risk due to collision with a person, a structure, power lines, events, etc.\n\nGround Obstructions: Risk due impact with ground obstructions.\n\nPhysiology: Risk due to impacts of the environment on personnel.\n\nMission Profiles: Risk of delay due to disruptions in mission implementation.\n\nIn-flight Hazards: Risk due to in-flight hazards (aircraft, emergency procedures, etc.)\n\nCollision with Structures: Risk due to (1) open field flying and/or (2) flying near structures.\n\nLanding: Risk to safe landing.\n\nFor each of the 8 points outlined above, and based on the anticipated flight conditions, a ‚Äúrisk likelihood‚Äù vs ‚Äúrisk severity‚Äù is assessed using the Risk Assessment Chart on Page 86 and in FAA Advisory Circular AC-107-2.\n\nAppendix C. Logging UAS (drone) Flights\n\nAll UAS (drone) flights must be logged in a manner that is readily accessible and permanent. Logging of free balloon, and moored balloon/kite flights is not required by the FAA. However, LBNL staff and affiliates conducting such flights are encouraged to log them as well. Flight logs are the responsibility of the RPIC and should be recorded both as a record of flight parameters for the RPIC and as a record for the project funding the flight. Acceptable logging methods include the following.\n\nA paper record in a typical pilot log book\n\nSmart phone app dedicated to flight logging (must enable some form of verification or electronic signature, backups and exportable copies)\n\nTable in a spreadsheet or word processing file (this is the least desirable method)\n\nFor UAS flights the preferred option above is 2. However the app needs to meet certain requirements as noted. Typically apps specific to UAS will work best for all LBNL aviation activities as opposed to apps for manned aircraft pilots.There are many smartphone apps available for this purpose, several of which are rated 4 stars or greater. A number of websites also provide reviews of apps. Ideally, an app will output totals in a manner that facilitates required RPIC reporting for DOE-OAM.\n\nThe DOE requires that documentation of all operations associated with UAS activities be submitted on a monthly basis to the DOE Office of Aircraft Management. Reports are submitted by LBNL pilots to the LBNL Aviation Point of Contact or its designee. Reports of flights to DOE must be backed up by logged flight records.\n\nNote: Practice and mission flights must be logged and reported each month.\n\nThe following information must, at a minimum, be reported by RPICs to the APOC (or designee) each month:\n\nNumber of flights\n\nDate, time and Duration of each flight (to the nearest 10th of an hour)\n\nLatitude-Longitude or other uniquely identified location of each flight.\n\nUAS platform (manufacturer and model)\n\nTotal number of flight hours.\n\nReport flight controller and pilot duty hours separately if different from flight hours\n\nIf there are any issues with the flights, such as lost links, aircraft damage, near-misses, etc., those need to be reported and will be included in the monthly report to DOE-OAM.\n\nIt is also possible to log all flights as they occur on a spreadsheet that is shared with the APOC. The APOC or designee can then complete the DOE report as required. The spreadsheet used for reporting COA flights to DOE-OAM is not suitable for logging flights, but is available here for reference.\n\nAppendix D. UAS (drone) Flight Crew Responsibilities\n\nThe following summarizes the key responsibilities of each flight crew member.\n\nRemote Pilot in Command (RPIC)\n\nThe Remote Pilot in Command shall:\n\nAssure the safety and compliance of UAS operations with this procedure, applicable regulations (e.g., 14 CFR 91 and 14 CFR 107 as applicable to the specific flight), site requirements, and the applicable Aviation Safety Plan.\n\nObtain a LAANC authorization number when using a LAANC approval for UAS operations conducted under 14 CFR 107\n\nRequest the FAA to issue NOTAMS within 48 to 72 hours before UAS operations when a NOTAM is required.

Areas that will need to be project-specific are highlighted throughout.\n\nThe project team will deploy a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) during research activities. A (insert drone make/model number) will be used. The UAS platform will be equipped with a XXXX used to detect YYYY. The YYYY is detected and used to quantify ZZZZ. Data collected during flights will be used for development and improvement of real-time software and algorithms for data mapping and localization.\n\n1.1 Regulations and Requirements\n\nUAS flights and related activities will be conducted in accordance with DOE Order 440.2C, LBNL Aviation Safety Policy, relevant parts of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Federal Aviation Administration, 14 CFR), and all specific regulations of another sovereign airspace authority when the mission is outside of the United States.\n\nNote: This blanket COA is not valid nor can it be used outside the United States. For foreign missions, the local/country rules will apply.\n\nUAS flights will be conducted under the Blanket Area UAS Class G COA (DOE) 2019-AHQ-907-COA. NOTE: This is subject to change. Check with the Aviation Point of Contact to ensure the current COA is included.\n\nFlight operations will be conducted exclusively in Class G airspace. Flight operations conducted under this Plan will typically be limited to 400 ft AGL, but the current COA accommodates up to 1200 ft. AGL.\n\nThe UAS used in this project is considered an Approved Unmanned Aircraft System per the manufacturer‚Äôs airworthiness statement. Airworthiness is maintained by Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) by inspection prior to and after each flight.\n\nThe aircraft employed in this project has/have been registered with the FAA.\n\nAircraft Requirements\n\n2.1 Aircraft\n\nOnly one UAS will be operated by each operator (e.g. Remote Pilot in Command (‚ÄúPilot‚Äù) or designee under direct supervision of the pilot) at any given time at a given site. UAS deployed for this project is an LBNL-owned (insert drone make/model number). Additional UAS may be acquired through LBNL and will be subject to the same requirements as included in this Aviation Safety Plan.\n\nThe (insert drone make/model number) utilizes the following features (per the manufacturer).\n\nAES-256 Encryption. Per the manufacturer, The AES-256 encryption keeps data transmission secure.\n\nObstacle Avoidance. The drone is equipped with an onboard system employing front, bottom and upper sensors that detect and aids in avoiding obstacles while enabling precision hovering.\n\nAnti-collision Beacon. The drone is equipped with latest generation top and bottom anti-collision beacons for visibility at night or in lowlight conditions.\n\nNote: While paragraph G of the DOE Blanket COA, allows UAS operations to be conducted at night, this project will not involve night or impaired visibility flights.\n\nDJI AirSense. This drone has a built-in ADS-B receiver, called DJI AirSense. This technology enhances airspace safety by automatically providing the operator with real-time information about nearby airplanes and helicopters.\n\nNote: There is a recognized potential for data gathered by a DJI drone to be transferred to unauthorized collection points if the drone is connected to the internet for update/file download. Precautions will be taken to prevent unauthorized collection of data.\n\n2.2 Operator\n\nAll DOE/LBNL-owned UAS will be operated by trained LBNL UAS pilots who have been certified as FAA Remote Pilots under Part 107 or by personnel under the direct supervision of the FAA-certified RPIC. The RPIC operating or supervising UAS‚Äô under this project must hold a FAA Remote Pilot Certificate and be prepared to produce it if requested. In addition, while there is no requirement for medical certification, any certified pilot or observer on this project will self-certify that they are capable of performing the job safely.\n\nAll FAA Remote Pilot Certificates are included in Attachment 1. This attachment will be updated as additional operators receive their FAA certificates.\n\n2.3 Airworthiness review and approval\n\nAn Airworthiness Certificate (AC) is not required by the FAA for small UAS operating under Part 107. However, it is required by the DOE. The AC(s) for the drone(s) must be kept with the UAS kit. It should also be included in the attachments and is an attachment to the WPC Activity.\n\nNote: Except for small unmanned aircraft operating under 14 CFR part 107 or a part 107 waiver, a civil UAS cannot conduct air commerce in the National Airspace System unless there is an appropriate and valid airworthiness certificate issued for that UAS. U.S. registration is a prerequisite for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate.\n\n2.4 Crew size and composition\n\nThe project team/operations crew for all UAS flights comprises a minimum two-person ground crew: a Pilot and Airspace Observer. Neither the Pilot nor the Observer is allowed to serve both functions at the same time. All RPICs and Observers must meet training requirements specified by DOE HQ OAM and the DOE Blanket COA. RPIC qualification will be documented in the UAS Notification to DOE HQ OAM Senior Aviation Manager.\n\nName Crew Function\n\nName (LBNL) Pilot/Payload Specialist/Airspace Observer\n\nName (LBNL) Airspace Observer\n\nName (LBNL) Payload Specialist/Airspace Observer\n\nThis ASP and the Work Planning and Control Activity (XX-0000) will be updated whenever there is a material change in crew status or certification.\n\nEquipment Description\n\n3.1 Airframe and Payload\n\nThe (make/model number) UAS (shown in Fig. 1) is battery powered and equipped with visual camera (i.e., brand name), which is a high-resolution camera (20.8 Mega Pixels) that can be used in still (capturing static pictures) or video mode. This system has also been paired with a (make/model number) camera, which is a high definition (640 √ó 512 resolution) thermal camera that has an infrared sensor, which can spot pixel temperature with a relatively good precision. Ground controllers are systems developed by the manufacturer (i.e., make/model number). Per the manufacturer data and the position are encrypted and are not automatically transferred to the manufacturer\n\nFigure 1: (drone make/model number)\n\nNOTE: Include a statement attesting to the fact that data or position information cannot be transmitted by the UAS. This is a DOE requirement.\n\n3.2 Launch\n\nUAS launch standard procedures are as follows:\n\nPhysically inspect UAS to ensure airworthiness\n\nSelect an open area clear of immediate obstacles\n\nClear the area of personnel except crew.\n\nPilot and Observer scan the area and sky to confirm takeoff conditions are clear. Personnel are kept at least 30 feet from spinning rotors during takeoff/landing.\n\nCheck mounting provision for tightness and security of all components that are removable for transporting to and from the flying site.\n\nCheck the payload to ensure that it is securely mounted onto the UAS.\n\nController is checked and turned on.\n\nUAS is placed on the ground and powered on.\n\nController displays aircraft telemetry. Pilot confirms battery voltages and signal strength of GPS.\n\nPilot and Observer recheck immediate area and sky.\n\nIf clear for takeoff, Pilot announces ‚ÄúTakeoff‚Äù and engages UAS motors.\n\nPilot brings aircraft into a stable hover approximately 6‚Äô off the ground and reconfirms all flight controls, battery voltages, and data-link signal strength.\n\nPilot and Observer fly the mission.\n\nDuring flight, Pilot and Observer continue to scan the sky and immediate area and note any personnel, aircraft, aircraft obstacles, or weather that could pose a safety hazard. Pilot constantly scans telemetry data from the aircraft monitoring battery voltages, RF signal quality, altitude, and GPS data.\n\nThe UAS will be operated in return-to-home mode, where it returns to a home location in case the connection link with the remote control is lost.\n\nFlight time will be logged for future activity reporting using the HQ OAM supplemented form (sample attached). Data will be reported monthly to OAM, irrespective of whether flights have been conducted. Data reporting will be coordinated with the LBNL Aviation Safety Point of Contact.\n\nNOTE: a model checklist is included in the Aviation Safety Policy and should be applied here. It is recommended that it be included as an attachment to the ASP if it or a modified version will be used.\n\n3.3 See and Avoid\n\nThe Pilot will maintain a visual line-of-sight with the UAS at all times. As per FAA requirements, visual line-of-sight is unaided. The Observer will also constantly maintain line-of-sight with the aircraft and warn the Pilot to avoid any condition that would place the aircraft out of line-of-sight, as well as warn of any aircraft in the region of flight. The Observer will also guide the Pilot in preventing collision.\n\nCommunications\n\nGround controllers used for each UAS comply with part 15 of the FCC Rules. The DJI Matrice 210 V2 controller communicates on either a 5.725 to 5.825 GHz or 2.400 to 2.483 GHz frequency.\n\nMaximum transmission distance, free of interference, for the DJI Matrice 210 V2 controller complies with the FCC (5 miles) and CE (3.1 miles) rules.\n\nCommunication between the Pilot and Observer consists of direct verbal communication when both are co-located. If it becomes necessary for the Observer to move away from the Pilot, cell phone communication will immediately be initiated to maintain contact. At remote sites, coverage will be confirmed prior to flying. When cell communication is not effective, an equivalent method for communication between pilot and observers will be established (portable radio, satellite phone, etc.).\n\nMission Description\n\n5.1 Pre-Operation Briefings\n\nOperations team briefings will be held before and after flights to ensure that all team members are aware of safety requirements, flight plan and procedures, and general operations.\n\nPrior to flight, the operations team will review the following:\n\nWeather, including wind conditions\n\nAltitudes and flight path\n\nMission overview, including handoff and recovery procedures\n\nFrequencies to be used\n\nFlight time limitations, including battery charge requirements\n\nContingency procedures to include lost link, divert, and flight termination\n\nAny hazards unique to the flight being flown, including issues and/or special provisions related to proximity to the public.\n\nNOTE: a model checklist is included in the Aviation Safety Policy and should be applied here. It is recommended that it be included as an attachment to the ASP if it or a modified version will be used.\n\n5.2 Crew Special Requirements\n\nCrew special requirements include special responsibilities and required safety training or information briefings as follows.\n\nAll team members:\n\nMust have a working knowledge of this Aviation Safety Plan.\n\nMust understand and comply with the stipulations set forth in the governing Work Planning & Control Activity (XX-0000).\n\nFormally accept the Work Planning and Control Activity controls profile prior to participating in flight operations.\n\nMust conform to all LBNL WPC Activity requirements, whether participating in flight operations or data collection.\n\nImplement hazard controls according to site risks and identified controls.\n\nComply with local site rules and regulations.\n\nIn addition to general team member requirements:\n\nPilot in Command:\n\nResponsible for overseeing all UAS operation and flights, and serves as the authority on takeoff, landing, and flight termination.\n\nObserver(s):\n\nResponsible for maintaining a direct line-of-sight with the UAS and assisting the Pilot with UAS operations. The Observer role is essential to ensure safe UAS operation and will remain focused on the flight and alert to changing operating conditions. Manned aircraft always have the right of way.\n\n5.3 Debriefing\n\nAfter the flight, operations team will debrief to review the following:\n\nAreas that were successful and areas that need improvement for all phases of the operation, including:\n\nPlanning\n\nPreparation\n\nTakeoff\n\nMission\n\nLanding\n\nItems to consider for modification or improvement\n\nEquipment assessment\n\nProcedures assessment\n\nInternal and external coordination issues\n\nData collection and management\n\nNOTE: a model checklist is included in the Aviation Safety Policy (Appendix H) and should be applied here. It is recommended that a checklist specific to flight operations covered by the ASP be included as an attachment to the ASP.\n\nHazard Risk Assessment\n\nHazards in this section will be discussed and assessed in accordance with the Risk Analysis Chart. The process for making the Hazard Risk Assessment is included in Appendix B of this document. Each risk will be assigned a Risk Analysis Chart (RAC) code of I through IV based on the likelihood and consequence of an occurrence and the RAC chart (see Table 2).\n\n6.1 Air Traffic\n\nThe operations site may vary. FAA Part 107 regulations will be observed with respect to flight operation proximity to controlled air space.\n\nThe LBNL Remote Pilot in Command has the responsibility to verify the following:\n\nNotification of local Air Traffic Control Center, if applicable per Part 107.\n\nConfirmation that a NOTAM will be issued for the planned operating period (as applicable and depending on location of flight operations).\n\nLocal host coordination has been made, approved, and scheduled, if applicable.\n\nDefined communications and equipment are operable.\n\nThe observer is properly equipped and briefed on role and responsibilities.\n\nEstablished procedures are followed if a local Search and Rescue (SAR) effort is in conflict or there is unplanned air traffic observed.\n\nThe closest regional airport at each location will be identified to account for any potential air traffic risk issues. However, mission plans will always ensure that the UAS will remain within Class G airspace, thereby making the risk of UAS and commercial aircraft collision negligible. Flights under this Work Planning and Control Activity won‚Äôt exceed 400 feet AGL.\n\nIf there is any doubt regarding the proximity of flight operations to a regional airport or airfield, the local Air Traffic Control center will be contacted and advised of planned flight operations in advance to ensure compliance with FAA regulations.\n\nSummary ‚Äì Air Traffic Risk Issues (per Attachment 4, Table 1 and 2):\n\nLikelihood: Insert\n\nConsequence: Insert\n\nRAC: Insert\n\n6.2 Aircraft Hazards\n\nThe primary hazards posed by the UAS may include collision with a person on the ground, a building, or power lines. Where applicable, the project team will work with the location facilities management/owner/etc. to define the flight zone to mitigate risk to uninvolved personnel at the host location and nearby power lines.\n\nFlights will primarily be conducted in an open field with no ground obstructions. However, several flights may be conducted around a building. When flying around buildings, an adequate and safe standoff distance from the building will be established. Flight plans will be tailored towards the hazards associated with the open field or research building during pre-flight briefings with the project team and the host location POC.\n\nWhere flight operations will take place in close proximity to buildings or other inhabited areas, controls will be established to ensure that contact with the UAS and personnel or buildings will not occur.\n\nSummary ‚Äì Aircraft Hazards (per Attachment 4, Table 1 and 2):\n\nLikelihood: Insert\n\nConsequence: Insert\n\nRAC: Insert\n\n6.3 Ground Obstructions\n\nPrimary hazards for ground obstructions may include other people, trees, or buildings. The project team will work with host location Point of Contact (POC) to mitigate ground obstruction risks as stated in 6.2.\n\nGround Obstruction Risks (per Attachment 4, Table 1 and 2):\n\nLikelihood"
