        "text": "New Properties of Drosophila scs and scsâ Insulators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKyrchanova, Olga; Leman, Dmitry; Parshikov, Alexander; Fedotova, Anna; Studitsky, Vasily; Maksimenko, Oksana; Georgiev, Pavel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nInsulators are defined as a class of regulatory elements that delimit independent transcriptional domains within eukaryotic genomes. The first insulators to be identified were scs and scs', which flank the domain including two heat shock 70 genes. Zw5 and BEAF bind to scs and scs', respectively, and are responsible for the interaction between these insulators. Using the regulatory regions of yellow and white reporter genes, we have found that the interaction between scs and scs' improves the enhancer-blocking activity of the weak scs' insulator. The sequences of scs and scs' insulators include the promoters of genes that are strongly active in S2 cells but not in the eyes, in which the enhancer-blocking activity of these insulators has been extensively examined. Only the promoter of the Cad87A gene located at the end of the scs insulator drives white expression in the eyes, and the white enhancer can slightly stimulate this promoter. The scs insulator contains polyadenylation signals that may be important for preventing transcription through the insulator. As shown previously, scs and scs' can insulate transcription of the white transgene from the enhancing effects of the surrounding genome, a phenomenon known as the chromosomal position effect (CPE). After analyzing many independent transgenic lines, we have concluded that transgenes carrying the scs insulator are rarely inserted into genomic regions that stimulate the white reporter expression in the eyes.

M.; Ritsema, Jeroen\n\n2016-08-01\n\nRegional waveforms of deep-focus Tonga-Fiji earthquakes indicate anomalous traveltime differences (ScS2-ScS) and amplitude ratios (ScS2/ScS) of the phases ScS and ScS2. The correlation between the ScS2-ScS delay time and the ScS2/ScS amplitude ratio suggests that shear wave apparent Q in the mantle below the Tonga-Fiji region is highest when shear wave velocities are lowest. This observation is unexpected if temperature variations were responsible for the seismic anomalies. Using spectral element method waveform simulations for four tomographic models, we demonstrate that focusing and scattering of shear waves by long-wavelength 3-D heterogeneity in the mantle may overwhelm the signal from intrinsic attenuation in long-period ScS2/ScS amplitude ratios. The tomographic models reproduce the trends in recorded ScS2-ScS difference times and ScS2/ScS amplitude ratios. Although they cannot be ruled out, variations in shear wave attenuation (i.e., the quality factor Q) are not necessary to explain the data.\n\nThe influence of shear-velocity heterogeneity on ScS2/ScS amplitude ratios and estimates of Q in the mantle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRitsema, J.; Chaves, C.

Three different ecotypes of samples, namely ocean sediments, coastal wetland sediments, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples, were used to assess the primer efficiency and the community structures of anammox bacteria retrieved by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the functional genes. Abundances of hzsB gene of anammox bacteria in South China Sea (SCS) samples were significantly correlated with 16S rRNA gene by qPCR method. And hzsB and hzsC gene primer pair hzsB364f-hzsB640r and hzsC745f-hzsC862r in combination with anammox bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers were recommended for quantifying anammox bacteria. Congruent with 16S rRNA gene-based community study, functional gene hzsB could also delineate the coastal-ocean distributing pattern, and seawater depth was positively associated with the diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria from shallow- to deep-sea. Both hzsC and ccsA genes could differentiate marine samples between deep and shallow groups of the Scalindua sp. clades. As for WWTP samples, non-Scalindua anammox bacteria reflected by hzsB, hzsC, ccsA, and ccsB gene-based libraries showed a similar distribution pattern with that by 16S rRNA gene. NH 4 + and NH 4 + /Î£(NO 3 - + NO 2 - ) positively correlated with anammox bacteria gene diversity, but organic matter contents correlated negatively with anammox bacteria gene diversity in SCS. Salinity was positively associated with diversity indices of hzsC and ccsB gene-harboring anammox bacteria communities and could potentially differentiate the distribution patterns between shallow- and deep-sea sediment samples. SCS surface sediments harbored considerably diverse community of Scalindua. A new Mai Po clade representing coastal estuary wetland anammox bacteria group based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny is proposed.

A. Wan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nEnvironment concern is one important aspect for supply chain sustainability (SCS). Nowadays, company's activities give a lot of impact on the environment. Through these activities, there are other SCS issue of environment were identified. In this paper, the proposed SCS issue of environmental concern will be determined from Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR). Using a total weightage of 0.333 (after dividing into three aspects of sustainability), each proposed issues will be classified according to the company activities in order to determined weightage for each issue. Those weightages then will be used in developing of score metric for SCS in design phase. Result shows that the carbon footprint is the major concern for SCS of environment while environmental management system is a lowest concern for SCS environment.\n\nSpinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) with Anatomically Guided (3D) Neural Targeting Shows Superior Chronic Axial Low Back Pain Relief Compared to Traditional SCS-LUMINA Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nVeizi, Elias; Hayek, Salim M; North, James; Brent Chafin, T; Yearwood, Thomas L; Raso, Louis; Frey, Robert; Cairns, Kevin; Berg, Anthony; Brendel, John; Haider, Nameer; McCarty, Matthew; Vucetic, Henry; Sherman, Alden; Chen, Lilly; Mekel-Bobrov, Nitzan\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using 3D neural targeting provided sustained overall and low back pain relief in a broad routine clinical practice population. This was a multicenter, open-label observational study with an observational arm and retrospective analysis of a matched cohort. After IPG implantation, programming was done using a patient-specific, model-based algorithm to adjust for lead position (3D neural targeting) or previous generation software (traditional). Demographics, medical histories, SCS parameters, pain locations, pain intensities, disabilities, and safety data were collected for all patients. A total of 213 patients using 3D neural targeting were included, with a trial-to-implant ratio of 86%. Patients used seven different lead configurations, with 62% receiving 24 to 32 contacts, and a broad range of stimulation parameters utilizing a mean of 14.3 (Â±6.1) contacts. At 24 months postimplant, pain intensity decreased significantly from baseline (ÎNRSâ=â4.2, Nâ=â169, P â<â0.0001) and even more in in the severe pain subgroup (ÎNRSâ=â5.3, Nâ=â91, P â<â0.0001). Axial low back pain also decreased significantly from baseline to 24 months (ÎNRSâ=â4.1, Nâ=â70, P â<â0.0001, on the overall cohort and ÎNRSâ=â5.6, Nâ=â38, on the severe subgroup). Matched cohort comparison with 213 patients treated with traditional SCS at the same centers showed overall pain responder rates of 51% (traditional SCS) and 74% (neural targeting SCS) and axial low back pain responder rates of 41% and 71% in the traditional SCS and neural targeting SCS cohorts, respectively. Lastly, complications occurred in a total of 33 of the 213 patients, with a 1.6% lead replacement rate and a 1.6% explant rate. Our results suggest that 3D neural targeting SCS and its associated hardware flexibility provide effective treatment for both chronic leg and chronic axial low back pain that is\n\nTransformation of gram positive bacteria by sonoporation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYang, Yunfeng; Li, Yongchao\n\nThe present invention provides a sonoporation-based method that can be universally applied for delivery of compounds into Gram positive bacteria. Gram positive bacteria which can be transformed by sonoporation include, for example, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Acetobacterium, and Clostridium. Compounds which can be delivered into Gram positive bacteria via sonoporation include nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, viruses, small organic and inorganic molecules, and nano-particles.\n\nThe microstructures of SCS-6 and SCS-8 SiC reinforcing fibers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSattler, M.L.; Kinney, J.H.; Zywicz, E.\n\nThe microstructures of SCS-6 and SCS-8 SiC fibers have been examined and analyzed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), microdiffraction, parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS), x-ray diffraction and x-ray spectroscopy. The results of the study confirm findings from earlier studies wherein the microstructure of the fibers have been described as consisting of {beta}-SiC grown upon a monofilament turbostratic carbon core. The present study, however, provides much more detail regarding this microstructure. For example, PEELS spectroscopy and x-ray microscopy indicate that the composition of the SiC varies smoothly from SiC plus free C near the carbon core to SiCmoreÂ Â» at the midradial boundary. The SiC stoichiometry is roughly preserved from the midradial boundary to the exterior interface. HRTEM, microdiffraction, and dark field images provide evidence that the excess carbon is amorphous free carbon which is most likely situated at the grain boundaries of the SiC. The x-ray microscopy results are also consistent with the presence of two phases near the core which consist of SiC and free carbon having density less than graphite (2.25 g/cc). This complex microstructure may explain the recent observations of nonplanar failure in composites fabricated with SCS fibers.Â«Â less\n\nCyclic diguanylate signaling in Gram-positive bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPurcell, Erin B.; Tamayo, Rita\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe nucleotide second messenger 3â²-5â² cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a central regulator of the transition between motile and non-motile lifestyles in bacteria, favoring sessility. Most research investigating the functions of c-di-GMP has focused on Gram-negative species, especially pathogens. Recent work in Gram-positive species has revealed that c-di-GMP plays similar roles in Gram-positives, though the precise targets and mechanisms of regulation may differ. The majority of bacterial life exists in a surface-associated state, with motility allowing bacteria to disseminate and colonize new environments. c-di-GMP signaling regulates flagellum biosynthesis and production of adherence factors and appears to be a primary mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to surfaces. Ultimately, c-di-GMP influences the ability of a bacterium to alter its transcriptional program, physiology and behavior upon surface contact. This review discusses how bacteria are able to sense a surface via flagella and type IV pili, and the role of c-di-GMP in regulating the response to surfaces, with emphasis on studies of Gram-positive bacteria.

The aim of this study was to use resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to detect changes in cortical networks and cortical processing related to the stimulator-induced pain relief. Ten patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or neuropathic leg pain underwent thoracic epidural spinal cord stimulator implantation. Stimulation parameters associated with \"optimal\" pain reduction were evaluated prior to imaging studies. Rs-fMRI was obtained on a 3 Tesla, Philips Achieva MRI. Rs-fMRI was performed with stimulator off (300TRs) and stimulator at optimum (Opt, 300 TRs) pain relief settings. Seed-based analysis of the resting state functional connectivity was conducted using seeds in regions established as participating in pain networks or in the default mode network (DMN) in addition to the network analysis. NCUT (normalized cut) parcellation was used to generate 98 cortical and subcortical regions of interest in order to expand our analysis of changes in functional connections to the entire brain. We corrected for multiple comparisons by limiting the false discovery rate to 5%. Significant differences in resting state connectivity between SCS off and optimal state were seen between several regions related to pain perception, including the left frontal insula, right primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, as well as in regions involved in the DMN, such as the precuneus. In examining changes in connectivity across the entire brain, we found decreased connection strength between somatosensory and limbic areas and increased connection strength between somatosensory and DMN with optimal SCS resulting in pain relief. This suggests that pain relief from SCS may be reducing negative emotional processing associated with pain, allowing somatosensory areas to become more\n\nRNases and Helicases in Gram-Positive Bacteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nDurand, Sylvain; Condon, Ciaran\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRNases are key enzymes involved in RNA maturation and degradation. Although they play a crucial role in all domains of life, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes have evolved with their own sets of RNases and proteins modulating their activities. In bacteria, these enzymes allow modulation of gene expression to adapt to rapidly changing environments. Today, >20 RNases have been identified in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , the paradigms of the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. However, only a handful of these enzymes are common to these two organisms and some of them are essential to only one. Moreover, although sets of RNases can be very similar in closely related bacteria such as the Firmicutes Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis , the relative importance of individual enzymes in posttranscriptional regulation in these organisms varies. In this review, we detail the role of the main RNases involved in RNA maturation and degradation in Gram-positive bacteria, with an emphasis on the roles of RNase J1, RNase III, and RNase Y. We also discuss how other proteins such as helicases can modulate the RNA-degradation activities of these enzymes.\n\nBeyond the SCS curve number: A new stochastic spatial runoff approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBartlett, M. S., Jr.; Parolari, A.; McDonnell, J.; Porporato, A. M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method is the standard approach in practice for predicting a storm event runoff response. It is popular because its low parametric complexity and ease of use. However, the SCS-CN method does not describe the spatial variability of runoff and is restricted to certain geographic regions and land use types. Here we present a general theory for extending the SCS-CN method. Our new theory accommodates different event based models derived from alternative rainfall-runoff mechanisms or distributions of watershed variables, which are the basis of different semi-distributed models such as VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL. We introduce a parsimonious but flexible description where runoff is initiated by a pure threshold, i.e., saturation excess, that is complemented by fill and spill runoff behavior from areas of partial saturation. To facilitate event based runoff prediction, we derive simple equations for the fraction of the runoff source areas, the probability density function (PDF) describing runoff variability, and the corresponding average runoff value (a runoff curve analogous to the SCS-CN). The benefit of the theory is that it unites the SCS-CN method, VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL as the same model type but with different assumptions for the spatial distribution of variables and the runoff mechanism. The new multiple runoff mechanism description for the SCS-CN enables runoff prediction in geographic regions and site runoff types previously misrepresented by the traditional SCS-CN method. In addition, we show that the VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL runoff curves may be more suitable than the SCS-CN for different conditions. Lastly, we explore predictions of sediment and nutrient transport by applying the PDF describing runoff variability within our new framework.\n\nSpace station Simulation Computer System (SCS) study for NASA/MSFC. Volume 5: Study analysis report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe Simulation Computer System (SCS) is the computer hardware, software, and workstations that will support the Payload Training Complex (PTC) at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The PTC will train the space station payload scientists, station scientists, and ground controllers to operate the wide variety of experiments that will be on-board the Freedom Space Station. The further analysis performed on the SCS study as part of task 2-Perform Studies and Parametric Analysis-of the SCS study contract is summarized. These analyses were performed to resolve open issues remaining after the completion of task 1, and the publishing of the SCS study issues report. The results of these studies provide inputs into SCS task 3-Develop and present SCS requirements, and SCS task 4-develop SCS conceptual designs. The purpose of these studies is to resolve the issues into usable requirements given the best available information at the time of the study. A list of all the SCS study issues is given.\n\nAntimicrobial Peptides Targeting Gram-Positive Bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalanovic, Nermina; Lohner, Karl\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have remarkably different structures as well as biological activity profiles, whereupon most of these peptides are supposed to kill bacteria via membrane damage. In order to understand their molecular mechanism and target cell specificity for Gram-positive bacteria, it is essential to consider the architecture of their cell envelopes. Before AMPs can interact with the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, they have to traverse the cell wall composed of wall- and lipoteichoic acids and peptidoglycan. While interaction of AMPs with peptidoglycan might rather facilitate penetration, interaction with anionic teichoic acids may act as either a trap for AMPs or a ladder for a route to the cytoplasmic membrane. Interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane frequently leads to lipid segregation affecting membrane domain organization, which affects membrane permeability, inhibits cell division processes or leads to delocalization of essential peripheral membrane proteins. Further, precursors of cell wall components, especially the highly conserved lipid II, are directly targeted by AMPs. Thereby, the peptides do not inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis via binding to proteins like common antibiotics, but form a complex with the precursor molecule, which in addition can promote pore formation and membrane disruption. Thus, the multifaceted mode of actions will make AMPs superior to antibiotics that act only on one specific target.

V.; Mishra, S. K.; Singh, Ranvir; Singh, V. P.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nSummaryA sediment yield model is developed to estimate the temporal rates of sediment yield from rainfall events on natural watersheds. The model utilizes the SCS-CN based infiltration model for computation of rainfall-excess rate, and the SCS-CN-inspired proportionality concept for computation of sediment-excess. For computation of sedimentographs, the sediment-excess is routed to the watershed outlet using a single linear reservoir technique. Analytical development of the model shows the ratio of the potential maximum erosion (A) to the potential maximum retention (S) of the SCS-CN method is constant for a watershed. The model is calibrated and validated on a number of events using the data of seven watersheds from India and the USA. Representative values of the A/S ratio computed for the watersheds from calibration are used for the validation of the model. The encouraging results of the proposed simple four parameter model exhibit its potential in field application.\n\nPhysical model of protein cluster positioning in growing bacteria\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWasnik, Vaibhav; Wang, Hui; Wingreen, Ned S.; Mukhopadhyay, Ranjan\n\n2017-10-01\n\nChemotaxic receptors in bacteria form clusters at cell poles and also laterally, and this clustering plays an important role in signal transduction. These clusters were found to be periodically arranged on the surface of the bacterium Escherichia coli, independent of any known positioning mechanism. In this work we extend a model based on diffusion and aggregation to more realistic geometries and present a means based on âburstyâ protein production to distinguish spontaneous positioning from an independently existing positioning mechanism. We also consider the case of isotropic cellular growth and characterize the degree of order arising spontaneously. Our model could also be relevant for other examples of periodically positioned protein clusters in bacteria.\n\nProtein secretion and surface display in Gram-positive bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchneewind, Olaf; Missiakas, Dominique M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe cell wall peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria functions as a surface organelle for the transport and assembly of proteins that interact with the environment, in particular, the tissues of an infected host. Signal peptide-bearing precursor proteins are secreted across the plasma membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. Some precursors carry C-terminal sorting signals with unique sequence motifs that are cleaved by sortase enzymes and linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan of vegetative forms or spores. The sorting signals of pilin precursors are cleaved by pilus-specific sortases, which generate covalent bonds between proteins leading to the assembly of fimbrial structures. Other precursors harbour surface (S)-layer homology domains (SLH), which fold into a three-pronged spindle structure and bind secondary cell wall polysaccharides, thereby associating with the surface of specific Gram-positive microbes. Type VII secretion is a non-canonical secretion pathway for WXG100 family proteins in mycobacteria. Gram-positive bacteria also secrete WXG100 proteins and carry unique genes that either contribute to discrete steps in secretion or represent distinctive substrates for protein transport reactions.

Volume 3: Refined conceptual design report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe results of the refined conceptual design phase (task 5) of the Simulation Computer System (SCS) study are reported. The SCS is the computational portion of the Payload Training Complex (PTC) providing simulation based training on payload operations of the Space Station Freedom (SSF). In task 4 of the SCS study, the range of architectures suitable for the SCS was explored. Identified system architectures, along with their relative advantages and disadvantages for SCS, were presented in the Conceptual Design Report. Six integrated designs-combining the most promising features from the architectural formulations-were additionally identified in the report. The six integrated designs were evaluated further to distinguish the more viable designs to be refined as conceptual designs. The three designs that were selected represent distinct approaches to achieving a capable and cost effective SCS configuration for the PTC. Here, the results of task 4 (input to this task) are briefly reviewed. Then, prior to describing individual conceptual designs, the PTC facility configuration and the SSF systems architecture that must be supported by the SCS are reviewed. Next, basic features of SCS implementation that have been incorporated into all selected SCS designs are considered. The details of the individual SCS designs are then presented before making a final comparison of the three designs.\n\nGenomics of Methylotrophy in Gram-Positive Methylamine-Utilizing Bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcTaggart, Tami L.; Beck, David A. C.; Setboonsarng, Usanisa; Shapiro, Nicole; Woyke, Tanja; Lidstrom, Mary E.; Kalyuzhnaya, Marina G.; Chistoserdova, Ludmila\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGram-positive methylotrophic bacteria have been known for a long period of time, some serving as model organisms for characterizing the specific details of methylotrophy pathways/enzymes within this group. However, genome-based knowledge of methylotrophy within this group has been so far limited to a single species, Bacillus methanolicus (Firmicutes). The paucity of whole-genome data for Gram-positive methylotrophs limits our global understanding of methylotrophy within this group, including their roles in specific biogeochemical cycles, as well as their biotechnological potential. Here, we describe the isolation of seven novel strains of Gram-positive methylotrophs that include two strains of Bacillus and five representatives of Actinobacteria classified within two genera, Arthrobacter and Mycobacterium. We report whole-genome sequences for these isolates and present comparative analysis of the methylotrophy functional modules within these genomes. The genomic sequences of these seven novel organisms, all capable of growth on methylated amines, present an important reference dataset for understanding the genomic basis of methylotrophy in Gram-positive methylotrophic bacteria. This study is a major contribution to the field of methylotrophy, aimed at closing the gap in the genomic knowledge of methylotrophy within this diverse group of bacteria.

So, many researchers have tried to develop better methods for estimating flood runoff discharge. The SCS runoff curve number is an empirical parameter determined by empirical analysis of runoff from small catchments and hillslope plots monitored by the USDA. This method is an efficient method for determining the approximate amount of runoff from a rainfall even in a particular area, and is very widely used all around the world. However, there is a quite difference between the conditions of Korea and USA in topography, geology and land use. Therefore, examinations in adaptability of the SCS runoff curve number need to raise the accuracy of runoff prediction using SCS runoff curve number method. The purpose of this study is to find the SCS runoff curve number based on the analysis of observed data from several experimental forest catchments monitored by the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS), as a pilot study to modify SCS runoff curve number for forest lands in Korea. Rainfall and runoff records observed in Gwangneung coniferous and broad leaves forests, Sinwol, Hwasoon, Gongju and Gyeongsan catchments were selected to analyze the variability of flood runoff coefficients during the last 5 years. This study shows that runoff curve numbers of the experimental forest catchments range from 55 to 65. SCS Runoff Curve number method is a widely used method for estimating design discharge for small ungauged watersheds. Therefore, this study can be helpful technically to estimate the discharge for forest watersheds in Korea with more accuracy.\n\nAntibacterial activities of Î²-glucan (laminaran) against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChamidah, A.; Hardoko, Prihanto, A. A.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis study aimed to determine the antibacterial activity of Î²-Glucan (laminaran) of LAE and LME extracts from brown algae Sargassum crassifolium using HPMS and Ultrasonication against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli). The highest antibacterial activities of LME extract obtained using the HPMS method against Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and S. aureus) were at 18:10 and 18.80 mm. The ultrasonication method showed a lower inhibition trend than the HPMS method, with MIC and MBC values of 250 mg/ml and 2-8 CFU/ml, respectively, in all Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The results showed that LME extract at a concentration of 250 mg/mL is bacteriostatic against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.\n\nSpace station Simulation Computer System (SCS) study for NASA/MSFC.

These included the NASA SOW, the TRW proposal, and working groups which focused the experience of NASA and the contractor team performing the study-TRW, Essex, and Grumman. The final list is organized into training related issues, and SCS associated development issues. To begin the analysis of the issues, a list of all the functions for which the SCS could be used was created, i.e., when the computer is turned on, what will it be doing. Analysis was continued by creating an operational functions matrix of SCS users vs. SCS functions to insure all the functions considered were valid, and to aid in identification of users as the analysis progressed. The functions will form the basis for the requirements, which are currently being developed under task 3 of the SCS study.\n\nGram-negative, but not Gram-positive, bacteria elicit strong PGE2 production in human monocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nHessle, Christina C; Andersson, Bengt; Wold, Agnes E\n\n2003-12-01\n\nGram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria induce different cytokine patterns in human mononuclear cells. We have seen that Gram-positives preferentially induce IL-12 and TNF-alpha, whereas Gram-negatives induce more IL-10, IL-6, and IL-8. In this study, we compared the capacity of these two groups of bacteria to induce PGE2. Monocytes stimulated with Gram-negative bacterial species induced much more PGE2 than did Gram-positive bacteria (5600 +/- 330 vs. 1700 +/- 670 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Blocking of COX-2 by NS398 abolished PGE2 production, but did not alter the cytokine patterns induced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We suggest that Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may stimulate different innate effector functions; Gram-positive bacteria promoting cell-mediated effector functions whereas Gram-negative bacteria inducing mediators inhibiting the same.\n\nSLUDGE PARTICLE SEPAPATION EFFICIENCIES DURING SETTLER TANK RETRIEVAL INTO SCS-CON-230\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDEARING JI; EPSTEIN M; PLYS MG\n\n2009-07-16\n\nThe purpose of this document is to release, into the Hanford Document Control System, FA1/0991, Sludge Particle Separation Efficiencies for the Rectangular SCS-CON-230 Container, by M. Epstein and M. G. Plys, Fauske & Associates, LLC, June 2009. The Sludge Treatment Project (STP) will retrieve sludge from the 105-K West Integrated Water Treatment System (IWTS) Settler Tanks and transfer it to container SCS-CON-230 using the Settler Tank Retrieval System (STRS). The sludge will enter the container through two distributors. The container will have a filtration system that is designed to minimize the overflow of sludge fines from the container to themoreÂ Â» basin. FAI/09-91 was performed to quantify the effect of the STRS on sludge distribution inside of and overflow out of SCS-CON-230. Selected results of the analysis and a system description are discussed. The principal result of the analysis is that the STRS filtration system reduces the overflow of sludge from SCS-CON-230 to the basin by roughly a factor of 10. Some turbidity can be expected in the center bay where the container is located. The exact amount of overflow and subsequent turbidity is dependent on the density of the sludge (which will vary with location in the Settler Tanks) and the thermal gradient between the SCS-CON-230 and the basin. Attachment A presents the full analytical results. These results are applicable specifically to SCS-CON-230 and the STRS filtration system's expected operating duty cycles.Â«Â less\n\nPeptidoglycan turnover and recycling in Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nReith, Jan; Mayer, Christoph\n\n2011-10-01\n\nBacterial cells are protected by an exoskeleton, the stabilizing and shape-maintaining cell wall, consisting of the complex macromolecule peptidoglycan. In view of its function, it could be assumed that the cell wall is a static structure. In truth, however, it is steadily broken down by peptidoglycan-cleaving enzymes during cell growth. In this process, named cell wall turnover, in one generation up to half of the preexisting peptidoglycan of a bacterial cell is released from the wall. This would result in a massive loss of cell material, if turnover products were not be taken up and recovered. Indeed, in the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, peptidoglycan recovery has been recognized as a complex pathway, named cell wall recycling. It involves about a dozen dedicated recycling enzymes that convey cell wall turnover products to peptidoglycan synthesis or energy pathways. Whether Gram-positive bacteria also recover their cell wall is currently questioned. Given the much larger portion of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, however, recovery of the wall material would provide an even greater benefit in these organisms compared to Gram-negatives. Consistently, in many Gram-positives, orthologs of recycling enzymes were identified, indicating that the cell wall may also be recycled in these organisms. This mini-review provides a compilation of information about cell wall turnover and recycling in Gram-positive bacteria during cell growth and division, including recent findings relating to muropeptide recovery in Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum from our group. Furthermore, the impact of cell wall turnover and recycling on biotechnological processes is discussed.\n\nHydrography synthesis using LANDSAT remote sensing and the SCS models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRagan, R. M.; Jackson, T. J.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe land cover requirements of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Model used for hydrograph synthesis in urban areas were modified to be LANDSAT compatible. The Curve Numbers obtained with these alternate land cover categories compare well with those obtained in published example problems using the conventional categories. Emergency spillway hydrographs and synthetic flood frequency flows computed for a 21.1 sq. mi. test area showed excellent agreement between the conventional aerial photo-based and the Landsat-based SCS approaches.\n\nEnvelope Structures of Gram-Positive Bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajagopal, Mithila; Walker, Suzanne\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGram-positive organisms, including the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, have dynamic cell envelopes that mediate interactions with the environment and serve as the first line of defense against toxic molecules. Major components of the cell envelope include peptidoglycan, which is a well-established target for antibiotics, teichoic acids, capsular polysaccharides, surface proteins, and phospholipids. These components can undergo modification to promote pathogenesis, decrease susceptibility to antibiotics and host immune defenses, and enhance survival in hostile environments. This chapter will cover the structure, biosynthesis and important functions of major cell envelope components in Gram-positive bacteria. Possible targets for new antimicrobials will be noted.

From the point of view of authors the integral index - glucose positive coliform bacteria most adequately reflect the sanitary-hygienic and epidemiological situation of water bodies. In monitoring for bacterial quality of tap water it is advisable to determine glucose positive coliform bacteria, that will provide the relevance of estimation of the epidemiological safety of water use. According to the method developed by the authors the calculation of the index of population risk of acute intestinal infections occurrence in dependence on the quality of tap water in Azov and Tsimlyansk towns.\n\nSelf-Compassion Scale (SCS): Psychometric Properties of The French Translation and Its Relations with Psychological Well-Being, Affect and Depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nKotsou, Ilios; Leys, Christophe\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOver the past few years, the topic of self-compassion has attracted increasing attention from both scientific and clinical fields. The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) was created to specifically capture this way of being kind and understanding towards oneself in moments of turmoil. In this article, we present a French adaptation of the SCS. We first explore the psychometric properties of this adaptation and then investigate its relation to psychological well-being. As in the original version of the SCS, the French adaptation has a strong 6-factor structure but a weaker hierarchical second order structure. However the bi-factor model yields a good omega index suggesting the relevance of a single score accounting for self-compassion. Moreover, there was a relation between the SCS and classical outcomes such as a positive relation with psychological well-being and negative relation with depressive symptoms. We then hypothesized that self-compassion would have a moderating role on the relation between affect and depression. This hypothesis was confirmed: expressing negative affect is correlated with depressive symptoms; however, being kind with oneself lowers depressive symptoms even when expressing negative affect. In conclusion, this research presents a valid self-compassion measure for French-speaking researchers and clinicians and outlines the need for further research on the concept of self-compassion.\n\nSmall molecule inhibitor of lipoteichoic acid synthesis is an antibiotic for Gram-positive bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichter, Stefan G.; Elli, Derek; Kim, Hwan Keun; Hendrickx, Antoni P. A.; Sorg, Joseph A.; Schneewind, Olaf; Missiakas, Dominique\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe current epidemic of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria requires the discovery of new drug targets and the development of new therapeutics. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall polymer of Gram-positive bacteria, consists of 1,3-polyglycerol-phosphate linked to glycolipid. LTA synthase (LtaS) polymerizes polyglycerol-phosphate from phosphatidylglycerol, a reaction that is essential for the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. We screened small molecule libraries for compounds inhibiting growth of Staphylococcus aureus but not of Gram-negative bacteria. Compound 1771 [2-oxo-2-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-ylamino)ethyl 2-naphtho[2,1-b]furan-1-ylacetate] blocked phosphatidylglycerol binding to LtaS and inhibited LTA synthesis in S. aureus and in Escherichia coli expressing ltaS. Compound 1771 inhibited the growth of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and prolonged the survival of mice with lethal S. aureus challenge, validating LtaS as a target for the development of antibiotics.

This work is the first study about the diversity and antimicrobial activity of culturable pigmented Gram-positive bacteria associated with marine Antarctic macroalgae. A total of 31 pigmented Gram-positive strains were isolated from the surface of six species of macroalgae collected in the King George Island, South Shetland Islands. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities â¥99%, 18 phylotypes were defined, which were clustered into 11 genera of Actinobacteria (Agrococcus, Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Citricoccus, Kocuria, Labedella, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Rhodococcus, Salinibacterium and Sanguibacter) and one genus of the Firmicutes (Staphylococcus). It was found that five isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against a set of macroalgae-associated bacteria. The active isolates were phylogenetically related to Agrococcus baldri, Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Citricoccus zhacaiensis and Kocuria palustris. The results indicate that a diverse community of pigmented Gram-positive bacteria is associated with Antartic macroalgae and suggest its potential as a promising source of antimicrobial and pigmented natural compounds.

Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.\n\nType IV Pili in Gram-Positive Bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCraig, Lisa\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSUMMARY Type IV pili (T4P) are surface-exposed fibers that mediate many functions in bacteria, including locomotion, adherence to host cells, DNA uptake (competence), and protein secretion and that can act as nanowires carrying electric current. T4P are composed of a polymerized protein, pilin, and their assembly apparatuses share protein homologs with type II secretion systems in eubacteria and the flagella of archaea. T4P are found throughout Gram-negative bacterial families and have been studied most extensively in certain model Gram-negative species. Recently, it was discovered that T4P systems are also widespread among Gram-positive species, in particular the clostridia. Since Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have many differences in cell wall architecture and other features, it is remarkable how similar the T4P core proteins are between these organisms, yet there are many key and interesting differences to be found as well. In this review, we compare the two T4P systems and identify and discuss the features they have in common and where they differ to provide a very broad-based view of T4P systems across all eubacterial species.

Volume 2: Concept document\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe Simulation Computer System (SCS) concept document describes and establishes requirements for the functional performance of the SCS system, including interface, logistic, and qualification requirements. The SCS is the computational communications and display segment of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Payload Training Complex (PTC). The PTC is the MSFC facility that will train onboard and ground operations personnel to operate the payloads and experiments on board the international Space Station Freedom. The requirements to be satisfied by the system implementation are identified here. The SCS concept document defines the requirements to be satisfied through the implementation of the system capability. The information provides the operational basis for defining the requirements to be allocated to the system components and enables the system organization to assess whether or not the completed system complies with the requirements of the system.\n\nIdentification of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria by fluorescence studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemchak, Jonathan; Calabrese, Joseph; Tzolov, Marian\n\n2011-03-01\n\nSeveral type strains of bacteria including Vibrio fischeri, Azotobacter vinelandii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Corynebacterium xerosis, were cultured in the laboratory following standard diagnostic protocol based on their individual metabolic strategies. The bacterial cultures were not further treated and they were studied in their pristine state (pure culture - axenic). The fluorescent studies were applied using a continuous wave and a pulsed excitation light sources. Emission and excitation spectra were recorded for the continuous wave excitation and they all show similar spectral features with the exception of the gram positive bacteria showing vibronic structures. The vibrational modes involved in these vibronic bands have energy typical for carbon-carbon vibrations. The fluorescence is quenched in addition of water, even a very thin layer, which confirms that the observed spectral features originate from the outer parts of the bacteria. These results allow to conclude that the fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as a method for studying the membranes of the bacteria and eventually to discriminate between gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The pulsed experiments show that the fluorescence lifetime is in the sub-microsecond range. The results indicate that the observed spectra are superposition of the emission with different lifetimes.\n\nEvolution of the SCS curve number method and its applications to continuous runoff simulation\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) [previously Soil Conservation Service (SCS)] developed the SCS runoff curve-number (CN) method for estimating direct runoff from storm rainfall.

The Gram-positive bacteria Microbacterium testaceum, Paenibacillus validus, and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis have strong carotenoid bands in the regions 1155-1157 cm(-1) and 1516-1522 cm(-1) that differentiate them from other tested Gram-negative bacteria. In the Raman spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus megaterium excited with 785 nm laser, the Raman bands at 1157 and 1521 cm(-1) are weak in intensity compared to other Gram-positive bacteria, and these bands did not show significant resonance Raman enhancement in the spectrum recorded with 514.5 nm laser excitation. The Gram-positive bacteria could be separated from each other based on the bands associated with the in-phase C=C (v(1)) vibrations of the polyene chain of carotenoids. None of the Gram-negative bacteria tested had carotenoid bands. The bacteria in the genus Xanthomonas have a carotenoid-like pigment, xanthomonadin, identified in Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, and it is a unique Raman marker for the bacteria. The representative bands for xanthomonadin were the C-C stretching (v(2)) vibrations of the polyene chain at 1135-1136 cm(-1) and the in-phase C=C (v(1)) vibrations of the polyene chain at 1529-1531 cm(-1), which were distinct from the carotenoid bands of other tested bacteria. The tyrosine peak in the region 1170-1175 cm(-1) was the only other marker present in Gram-negative bacteria that was absent in all tested Gram-positives. A strong-intensity exopolysaccharide-associated marker at 1551 cm(-1) is a distinguishable feature of Enterobacter cloacae. The Gram-negative Agrobacterium rhizogenes and Ralstonia solanacearum were differentiated from each other and other tested bacteria on the basis of presence or absence and relative intensities of peaks.

Although several hundred efficient class D enzymes have been identified in Gram-negative pathogens over the last four decades, they have not been reported in Gram-positive bacteria. Here we demonstrate that efficient class D Î²-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing a wide array of Î²-lactam substrates are widely disseminated in various species of environmental Gram-positive organisms. Class D enzymes of Gram-positive bacteria have a distinct structural architecture and employ a unique substrate binding mode quite different from that of all currently known class A, C, and D Î²-lactamases. They constitute a novel reservoir of antibiotic resistance enzymes.

Bacterial Lpp belong to the class of lipid-anchored proteins that in Gram-negative bacteria are anchored in both the cytoplasmic and outer membranes and in Gram-positive bacteria are anchored only in the cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast to the case for Gram-negative bacteria, in Gram-positive bacteria lipoprotein maturation and processing are not vital. Physiologically, Lpp play an important role in nutrient and ion acquisition, allowing particularly pathogenic species to better survive in the host. Bacterial Lpp are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) of the innate immune system. The important role of Lpp in Gram-positive bacteria, particularly in the phylum Firmicutes, as key players in the immune response and pathogenicity has emerged only in recent years. In this review, we address the role of Lpp in signaling and modulating the immune response, in inflammation, and in pathogenicity. We also address the potential of Lpp as promising vaccine candidates. PMID:27512100\n\nSpace Station Simulation Computer System (SCS) study for NASA/MSFC. Phased development plan\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1990-01-01\n\nNASA's Space Station Freedom Program (SSFP) planning efforts have identified a need for a payload training simulator system to serve as both a training facility and as a demonstrator to validate operational concepts. The envisioned MSFC Payload Training Complex (PTC) required to meet this need will train the Space Station payload scientists, station scientists and ground controllers to operate the wide variety of experiments that will be onboard the Space Station Freedom. The Simulation Computer System (SCS) is made up of computer hardware, software, and workstations that will support the Payload Training Complex at MSFC.

To enforce these characteristics of solutions to the EEG inverse problem, we propose a correlation-variance model which factors a cortical source space covariance matrix into the multiplication of a pre-given correlation coefficient matrix and the square root of the diagonal variance matrix learned from the data under a Bayesian learning framework. We tested the SCS method using simulated EEG data with various SNR and applied it to a real ECOG data set. We compare the results of SCS to those of an established SBL algorithm.\n\nSpace Station Simulation Computer System (SCS) study for NASA/MSFC.

Moreover, with a help of this system, it is possible to have a nice report at the end of the month and based on the total number of worked hours, the salary will be allocated to each personnel. The access tag can be read up to 10 centimeters from the RFID reader.

Although several hundred efficient class D enzymes have been identified in Gram-negative pathogens over the last four decades, none have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria. Here we demonstrate that efficient class D Î²-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing a wide array of Î²-lactam substrates are widely disseminated in various species of environmental Gram-positive organisms. Class D enzymes of Gram-positive bacteria have a distinctmoreÂ Â» structural architecture and employ a unique substrate-binding mode that is quite different from that of all currently known class A, C and D Î²-lactamases.

The differentiation of hEnSCs into many cell lineages such as osteoblast, adipocyte, and neural cells has been investigated previously. However, the differentiation of these stem cells into motor neuron-like cells has not been investigated yet. Different biochemical and topographical cues can affect the differentiation of stem cells into a specific cell. The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of hEnSCs to be differentiated into motor neuron-like cells under biochemical and topographical cues. The biocompatible and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) electrospun nanofibrous scaffold was used as a topographical cue. Human EnSCs were cultured on the PLGA scaffold and tissue culture polystyrene (TCP), then differentiation of hEnSCs into motor neuron-like cells under induction media including retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) were evaluated for 15 days. The proliferation rate of cells was assayed by using MTT assay. The morphology of cells was studied by scanning electron microscopy imaging, and the expression of motor neuron-specific markers by real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry. Results showed that survival and differentiation of hEnSCs into motor neuron-like cells on the PLGA scaffold were better than those on the TCP group. Taken together, the results suggest that differentiated hEnSCs on PLGA can provide a suitable, three-dimensional situation for neuronal survival and outgrowth for regeneration of the central nervous system, and these cells may be a potential candidate in cellular therapy for motor neuron diseases.\n\nMolecular taxonomy and phylogenetic position of lactic acid bacteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nStackebrandt, E; Teuber, M\n\n1988-03-01\n\nLactic acid bacteria, important in food technology, are Gram-positive organisms exhibiting a DNA G + C content of less than 50 mol%. Phylogenetically they are members of the Clostridium-Bacillus subdivision of Gram-positive eubacteria. Lactobacillus and streptococci together with related facultatively anaerobic taxa evolved as individual lines of descent about 1.5-2 billion years ago when the earth passed from an anaerobic to an aerobic environment. In contrast to the traditional, morphology-based classification, the genus Lactobacillus is intermixed with strains of Pediococcus and Leuconostoc. Similarly, the physiology-based clustering of lactobacilli into Thermo-, Strepto- and Betabacterium does not agree with their phylogenetic relationships. On the other hand, the phenotypically defined genus Streptococcus is not a phylogenetic coherent genus but its members fall into at least 3 moderately related genera, i.e. Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus. The genus Bifidobacterium, frequently grouped with the lactobacilli, is the most ancient group of the second, the Actinomycetes subdivision of the Gram-positive eubacteria. In addition, propionibacteria, microbacteria and brevibacteria belong to this subdivision but the latter organisms appear as offshoots of non-lactic acid bacteria.\n\nSpatial contrast in phytoplankton, bacteria and microzooplankton grazing between the eutrophic Yellow Sea and the oligotrophic South China Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yafeng; Wang, Xutao; Yin, Kedong\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThree cruises were conducted to investigate the distributions of nutrients, chlorophyll a (Chl- a), new and regenerated primary production, bacterial abundance and production, and microzooplankton grazing rates in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the South China Sea (SCS) during March and May. As the water column moved from low to high temperature, weak to strong stratification and high to low nutrients from the YS to the SCS, Chl- a, primary production and bacterial biomass decreased. In contrast, bacterial production, microzooplankton grazing and size preference increased from the YS to the SCS. The increasing grazing activity and decreasing f-ratio from the YS to the SCS suggest roles of regenerated nutrients in the supporting the community increased and more bacteria played important roles in the carbon flow in the oligotrophic SCS than in the eutrophic YS. These variabilities force the classical food chain dominated community in the eutrophic waters into the microbial loop, which is dominant in oligotrophic waters. As nutrients decrease, temperature and grazing activity increase from the YS to the SCS. The increasing ratio of integrated bacterial production to integrated primary production indicates that communities change from autotrophy to heterotrophy and waters change from a carbon sink to a carbon source.\n\nMetabolites with Gram-negative bacteria quorum sensing inhibitory activity from the marine animal endogenic fungus Penicillium sp. SCS-KFD08.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, Fan Dong; Zhou, Li Man; Ma, Qing Yun; Huang, Sheng Zhuo; Wang, Pei; Dai, Hao Fu; Zhao, You Xing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThree new compounds named penicitor A, aculene E and penicitor B, as well as four known compounds, were isolated from the fermentation broth of Penicillium sp. SCS-KFD08 associated with a marine animal Sipunculus nudus from the Haikou bay of China. Their planar structures and absolute configurations were unambiguously elucidated by spectroscopic data, Mosher's method, CD spectrum analysis along with quantum ECD calculation. Among them, compounds 2-7 showed quorum sensing inhibitory activity against Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, and could significantly reduce violacein production in N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) induced C. violaceum CV026 cultures at sub-inhibitory concentrations.\n\nEvaluation of SCS-CN method using a fully distributed physically based coupled surface-subsurface flow model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShokri, Ali\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe hydrological cycle contains a wide range of linked surface and subsurface flow processes. In spite of natural connections between surface water and groundwater, historically, these processes have been studied separately. The current trend in hydrological distributed physically based model development is to combine distributed surface water models with distributed subsurface flow models. This combination results in a better estimation of the temporal and spatial variability of the interaction between surface and subsurface flow. On the other hand, simple lumped models such as the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) are still quite common because of their simplicity. In spite of the popularity of the SCS-CN method, there have always been concerns about the ambiguity of the SCS-CN method in explaining physical mechanism of rainfall-runoff processes. The aim of this study is to minimize these ambiguity by establishing a method to find an equivalence of the SCS-CN solution to the DrainFlow model, which is a fully distributed physically based coupled surface-subsurface flow model. In this paper, two hypothetical v-catchment tests are designed and the direct runoff from a storm event are calculated by both SCS-CN and DrainFlow models. To find a comparable solution to runoff prediction through the SCS-CN and DrainFlow, the variance between runoff predictions by the two models are minimized by changing Curve Number (CN) and initial abstraction (Ia) values. Results of this study have led to a set of lumped model parameters (CN and Ia) for each catchment that is comparable to a set of physically based parameters including hydraulic conductivity, Manning roughness coefficient, ground surface slope, and specific storage. Considering the lack of physical interpretation in CN and Ia is often argued as a weakness of SCS-CN method, the novel method in this paper gives a physical explanation to CN and Ia.\n\nImpedimetric detection of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria using an antimicrobial peptide from class IIa bacteriocins.\n\nPubMed\n\nEtayash, Hashem; Jiang, Keren; Thundat, Thomas; Kaur, Kamaljit\n\n2014-02-04\n\nReal-time, label-free detection of Gram-positive bacteria with high selectivity and sensitivity is demonstrated using an interdigitated impedimetric array functionalized with naturally produced antimicrobial peptide from class IIa bacteriocins. The antimicrobial peptide, leucocin A, was chemically synthesized and covalently immobilized on interdigitated gold microelectrodes via the interaction between the C-terminal carboxylic acid of the peptide and free amines of a preattached thiolated linker. Exposing the peptide sensor to various concentrations of Gram-positive bacteria generated reproducible impedance spectra that detected peptide-bacteria interactions at a concentration of 1 cell/Î¼L. The peptide sensor also selectively detected Listeria monocytogenes from other Gram-positive strains at a concentration of 10(3) cfu mL(-1). The study highlights that short peptide ligands from bacteriocin class offer high selectivity in bacterial detection and can be used in developing a robust, portable biosensor device to efficiently detect pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria in food samples.\n\nBeyond the SCS-CN method: A theoretical framework for spatially lumped rainfall-runoff response\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBartlett, M. S.; Parolari, A. J.; McDonnell, J. J.; Porporato, A.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nSince its introduction in 1954, the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method has become the standard tool, in practice, for estimating an event-based rainfall-runoff response. However, because of its empirical origins, the SCS-CN method is restricted to certain geographic regions and land use types. Moreover, it does not describe the spatial variability of runoff. To move beyond these limitations, we present a new theoretical framework for spatially lumped, event-based rainfall-runoff modeling. In this framework, we describe the spatially lumped runoff model as a point description of runoff that is upscaled to a watershed area based on probability distributions that are representative of watershed heterogeneities. The framework accommodates different runoff concepts and distributions of heterogeneities, and in doing so, it provides an implicit spatial description of runoff variability. Heterogeneity in storage capacity and soil moisture are the basis for upscaling a point runoff response and linking ecohydrological processes to runoff modeling. For the framework, we consider two different runoff responses for fractions of the watershed area: \"prethreshold\" and \"threshold-excess\" runoff. These occur before and after infiltration exceeds a storage capacity threshold. Our application of the framework results in a new model (called SCS-CNx) that extends the SCS-CN method with the prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff mechanisms and an implicit spatial description of runoff. We show proof of concept in four forested watersheds and further that the resulting model may better represent geographic regions and site types that previously have been beyond the scope of the traditional SCS-CN method.\n\nPrevalence of ESBL-positive bacteria in the community in the Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nCekanovÃ¡, Luboslava; KolÃ¡r, Milan; ChromÃ¡, Magdalena; Sauer, Pavel; SedlÃ¡ckovÃ¡, Michaela; KoukalovÃ¡, Dagmar\n\n2009-07-01\n\nProblematic bacteria in the community include enterobacteria which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. As yet there is no description of the prevalence of these bacteria in persons in the community in the Czech Republic. Therefore the main goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of ESBL-positive enterobacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of subjects in the community in the Czech Republic. Rectal swabs from the investigated subjects were inoculated onto chromID ESBL selective medium and enterobacteria were identified by the Vitek2 automated system. ESBL were detected using a modified DDST test. The results were confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing of CTX-M-positive amplicons. A total of 579 rectal swabs from subjects in the community were analyzed and ESBL production was both phenotypically and genotypically confirmed in 7 isolates. Thus the prevalence of ESBL-positive bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of the persons in the community was 1.2%. All the cases were Escherichia coli strains producing the CTX-M-type ESBL. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent type in this group of isolates. The presented results are in accord with other authors' studies and suggest that the epidemiologic profile of ESBL-positive enterobacteria in the Czech Republic is comparable to that in other European countries.\n\nValidity and extension of the SCS-CN method for computing infiltration and rainfall-excess rates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMishra, Surendra Kumar; Singh, Vijay P.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nA criterion is developed for determining the validity of the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method. According to this criterion, the existing SCS-CN method is found to be applicable when the potential maximum retention, S, is less than or equal to twice the total rainfall amount. The criterion is tested using published data of two watersheds. Separating the steady infiltration from capillary infiltration, the method is extended for predicting infiltration and rainfall-excess rates. The extended SCS-CN method is tested using 55 sets of laboratory infiltration data on soils varying from Plainfield sand to Yolo light clay, and the computed and observed infiltration and rainfall-excess rates are found to be in good agreement.\n\nRapid and reliable identification of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive cocci by deposition of bacteria harvested from blood cultures onto the MALDI-TOF plate.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarnini, Simona; Ghelardi, Emilia; Brucculeri, Veronica; Morici, Paola; Lupetti, Antonella\n\n2015-06-18\n\nRapid identification of the causative agent(s) of bloodstream infections using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology can lead to increased empirical antimicrobial therapy appropriateness. Herein, we aimed at establishing an easier and simpler method, further referred to as the direct method, using bacteria harvested by serum separator tubes from positive blood cultures and placed onto the polished steel target plate for rapid identification by MALDI-TOF. The results by the direct method were compared with those obtained by MALDI-TOF on bacteria isolated on solid media. Identification of Gram-negative bacilli was 100 % concordant using the direct method or MALDI-TOF on isolated bacteria (96 % with scoreâ>â2.0). These two methods were 90 % concordant on Gram-positive cocci (32 % with scoreâ>â2.0). Identification by the SepsiTyper method of Gram-positive cocci gave concordant results with MALDI-TOF on isolated bacteria in 87 % of cases (37 % with scoreâ>â2.0). The direct method herein developed allows rapid identification (within 30 min) of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures and can be used to rapidly report reliable and accurate results, without requiring skilled personnel or the use of expensive kits.\n\nSpace Station Simulation Computer System (SCS) study for NASA/MSFC.

To deal with these hostile environments, pathogenic bacteria have evolved or acquired virulence determinants that aid in the acquisition of nutrients. This connection between pathogenesis and nutrition may explain why regulators of metabolism in nonpathogenic bacteria are used by pathogenic bacteria to regulate both metabolism and virulence. Such coordinated regulation is presumably advantageous because it conserves carbon and energy by aligning synthesis of virulence determinants with the nutritional environment. In Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, at least three metabolite-responsive global regulators, CcpA, CodY, and Rex, have been shown to coordinate the expression of metabolism and virulence genes. In this chapter, we discuss how environmental challenges alter metabolism, the regulators that respond to this altered metabolism, and how these regulators influence the host-pathogen interaction.

Chronic pain is dynamic showing exacerbations, variable severity, and evolving pain patterns. Given this complexity, SCS systems that provide a broad range of stimulation waveforms may be valuable. The aim of this research was to characterize the usage pattern of stimulation waveforms and field shapes in chronic pain patients implanted with the Spectra System. A review of daily device usage in a cohort of 250 patients implanted for a minimum duration of one month was conducted. With follow-ups ranging between 1Â month and 1Â year post-implant, 72.8% of patients used Standard Rate, 34.8% Anode Intensification, 23.2% Higher Rate, and 8.4% Burst stimulation waveforms. Collectively, 60% used 1 or more advanced waveforms, either exclusively or along with Standard Rate. A trend showed patients continuing to use up to 3 programs one year post-implant. When given a choice, SCS patients often utilize a variety of waveforms, suggesting that patients may benefit from a single system that provides multiple waveforms and field shapes to customize therapy and improve efficacy.\n\nTopography Estimation of the Core Mantle Boundary with ScS Reverberations and Diffraction Waves\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHein, B. E.; Nakata, N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this study, we use the propagation of global seismic waves to study the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB). We focus on the use of S-wave reflections at the CMB (ScS reverberations) and outer-core diffracted waves. It is difficult imaging the CMB with the ScS wave because the complexity of the structure in the near surface ( 50 km); the complex structure degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of of the ScS. To avoid estimating the structure in the crust, we rely on the concept of seismic interferometry to extract wave propagation through mantle, but not through the crust. Our approach is compute the deconvolution between the ScS (and its reverberation) and direct S waves generated by intermediate to deep earthquakes (>50 km depth). Through this deconvolution, we have the ability to filter out the direct S wave and retrieve the wave field propagating from only the hypocenter to the outer core, but not between the hypocenter to the receiver. After the deconvolution, we can isolate the CMB reflected waves from the complicated wave phenomena because of the near-surface structure. Utilizing intermediate and deep earthquakes is key since we can suppress the near-surface effect from the surface to the hypocenter of the earthquakes. The variation of such waves (e.g., travel-time perturbation and/or wavefield decorrelation) at different receivers and earthquakes provides the information of the topography of the CMB. In order to get a more detailed image of the topography of the CMB we use diffracted seismic waves such as Pdiff , Sdiff, and P'P'. By using two intermediate to deep earthquakes on a great circle path with a station we can extract the wave propagation between the two earthquakes to simplify the waveform, similar to how it is preformed using the ScS wave. We generate more illumination of the CMB by using diffracted waves rather than only using ScS reverberations. The accurate topography of CMB obtained by these deconvolution analyses may provide new insight of the\n\nScreening for subclinical Cushing's syndrome in type 2 diabetes mellitus: low false-positive rates with nocturnal salivary cortisol.\n\nPubMed\n\nGagliardi, L; Chapman, I M; O'Loughlin, P; Torpy, D J\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS) is important, but its relative rarity amongst patients with common metabolic disorders requires a simple test with a low false-positive rate. Using nocturnal salivary cortisol (NSC), which we first validated in patients with suspected and proven Cushing's syndrome, we screened 106 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a group at high risk of SCS and nontumoral hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis perturbations. Our hypothesis was that a lower false-positive rate with NSC was likely, compared with that reported with the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (10-20%), currently the foundation of diagnosis of SCS. No participant had clinically apparent Cushing's syndrome. Three participants had an elevated NSC but further testing excluded SCS. In this study, NSC had a lower false-positive rate (3%) than previously reported for the DST. Given the reported excellent performance of NSC in detection of hypercortisolism, the low false-positive rate in SCS suggests NSC may be superior to the DST for SCS screening. The NSC and DST should be compared directly in metabolic disorder patients; although our data suggest the patient group will need to be substantially larger to definitively determine the optimal screening test.

Up to 20 different locations around 190 patients were surveyed. Fifty-four patients were infected or colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 136 with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The environmental detection rate for MRSA or VRE was 24.7% (174/705 samples) compared with 4.9% (89/1827 samples) for multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (P<0.001). Gram-positive bacteria were isolated more frequently than Gram-negatives from the hands of patients (P<0.001) and hospital personnel (P=0.1145). Environmental contamination did not differ between the intensive care units (ICUs) and the general wards (GWs), which is noteworthy because our ICUs are routinely disinfected twice a day, whereas GWs are cleaned just once a day with detergent. Current guidelines for the prevention of spread of multi-resistant bacteria in the hospital setting do not distinguish between Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Our results suggest that the inanimate environment serves as a secondary source for MRSA and VRE, but less so for Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, strict contact isolation in a single room with complete barrier precautions is recommended for MRSA or VRE; however, for multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, contact isolation with barrier precautions for close contact but without a single room seems sufficient. This benefits not only the patients, but also the hospital by removing some of the strain placed on already over-stretched resources.\n\nGeneral calibration methodology for a combined Horton-SCS infiltration scheme in flash flood modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGabellani, S.; Silvestro, F.; Rudari, R.; Boni, G.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nFlood forecasting undergoes a constant evolution, becoming more and more demanding about the models used for hydrologic simulations. The advantages of developing distributed or semi-distributed models have currently been made clear. Now the importance of using continuous distributed modeling emerges. A proper schematization of the infiltration process is vital to these types of models. Many popular infiltration schemes, reliable and easy to implement, are too simplistic for the development of continuous hydrologic models. On the other hand, the unavailability of detailed and descriptive information on soil properties often limits the implementation of complete infiltration schemes. In this work, a combination between the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method (SCS-CN) and a method derived from Horton equation is proposed in order to overcome the inherent limits of the two schemes. The SCS-CN method is easily applicable on large areas, but has structural limitations. The Horton-like methods present parameters that, though measurable to a point, are difficult to achieve a reliable estimate at catchment scale. The objective of this work is to overcome these limits by proposing a calibration procedure which maintains the large applicability of the SCS-CN method as well as the continuous description of the infiltration process given by the Horton's equation suitably modified. The estimation of the parameters of the modified Horton method is carried out using a formal analogy with the SCS-CN method under specific conditions. Some applications, at catchment scale within a distributed model, are presented.\n\nTrans-generational Immune Priming Protects the Eggs Only against Gram-Positive Bacteria in the Mealworm Beetle\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDubuffet, Aurore; Zanchi, Caroline; Boutet, Gwendoline; Moreau, JÃ©rÃ´me; Teixeira, Maria; Moret, Yannick\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn many vertebrates and invertebrates, offspring whose mothers have been exposed to pathogens can exhibit increased levels of immune activity and/or increased survival to infection. Such phenomena, called âTrans-generational immune primingâ (TGIP) are expected to provide immune protection to the offspring. As the offspring and their mother may share the same environment, and consequently similar microbial threats, we expect the immune molecules present in the progeny to be specific to the microbes that immune challenged the mother. We provide evidence in the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor that the antimicrobial activity found in the eggs is only active against Gram-positive bacteria, even when females were exposed to Gram-negative bacteria or fungi. Fungi were weak inducers of TGIP while we obtained similar levels of anti-Gram-positive activity using different bacteria for the maternal challenge. Furthermore, we have identified an antibacterial peptide from the defensin family, the tenecin 1, which spectrum of activity is exclusively directed toward Gram-positive bacteria as potential contributor to this antimicrobial activity. We conclude that maternal transfer of antimicrobial activity in the eggs of T. molitor might have evolved from persistent Gram-positive bacterial pathogens between insect generations.

The holes in cell walls need to be large enough to let critical nutrients pass through. However, the cell wall must also function to prevent the bacteria's membrane from protruding through a large hole into the environment and lysing the cell. As such, we hypothesize that there exists a range of cell wall hole sizes that allow for molecule transport but prevent membrane protrusion. Here we develop and analyze a biophysical theory of the response of a Gram-positive cell's membrane to the formation of a hole in the cell wall. We predict a critical hole size in the"
