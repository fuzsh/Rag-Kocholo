Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Satellite Location Map of Paggai).\n\nSatellite map\n\nSatellite map shows the Earth's surface as it really looks like. The above map is based on satellite images taken on July 2004. This satellite map of Paggai is meant for illustration purposes only. For more detailed maps based on newer satellite and aerial images switch to a detailed map view.\n\nHillshading is used to create a three-dimensional effect that provides a sense of land relief. Shadows drawn on a map simulate the effects of sunlight falling across the surface of the landscape.\n\nMap projection of the location map\n\nThe location map of Paggai combines two projections: the orthographic azimuthal projection for the globe and the simple geographic projection for the rectangular part of the map. Geographic projection has straight meridians and parallels, each degree of latitude and longitude is the same size over the entire world map.\n\nThe orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from infinite distance. It was already known to the Egyptians and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. It gives the appearance of the Earth viewed from outer space. Only one hemisphere can be viewed at a time. The globe centered on Paggai appears more realistic than almost any other projection.\n\nTechnology\n\nWe unlock the value hidden in the geographic data.

Maps are assembled and kept in a high resolution vector format throughout the entire process of their creation.\n\nExperience of discovering\n\nMaphill maps will never be as detailed as Google maps or as precise as designed by professional cartographers. Our goal is different. We want to redefine the experience of discovering the world through the maps.\n\nFast anywhere\n\nMaps are served from a large number of servers spread all over the world.
