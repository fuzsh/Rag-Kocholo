        "text": "Editor's note: This is an update to clarify the last paragraph.\n\nNEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Acceptable TV, VH1's new Internet site and weekly television show appears to be part of a new genre that marries reality TV with Google's YouTube.\n\nThe result is 90% professionally-produced programming combined with free-form user content.\n\n\"The primary point is to create a really funny TV show,\" said Michael Hirschorn, executive vice president at VH1. \"We're giving users the ability to tell us what's funny and what's not.\"\n\nVH1, a unit of Viacom's MTV Networks, partnered with executive producer Jack Black (famous for his comedies, such as \"Nacho Libre\") and Channel 101 co-creators Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab on the enterprise.\n\nIn many ways, it's similar to Project Greenlight, a reality show and contest for aspiring screenplay writers. If you don't know how to create a story, Black has little video tutorial skits about how scriptwriters can overcome writer's block.\n\nAs of Monday, Hirschorn said 240 video shorts had been submitted, some professionally produced by Acceptable TV and some by users.\n\nMuch like video-sharing sites -- YouTube, Revver, Metacafe, Break.com, etc. -- the audience can rate and vote on each video.\n\nAnd each week, six pilots, lasting between three and five minutes, air on national television. Five are produced by the Acceptable TV team and one is user-generated.\n\nFollowing the show, all five of the professionally-produced pilots go up on the site and users vote for the two pilots they want to see continue for another episode. The user-submitted video does not go up for that vote because it's unclear the user or amateur has the finances or time to create another episode, said Hirschorn. Additionally, Acceptable TV is still trying to figure out exactly how much user content should be integrated.\n\n\"There's an ongoing discussion about whether this is a professionally-produced show with interactive elements, or an interactive show with professional elements,\" said Hirschorn.\n\nSo far Hirschorn said the user-submitted shows are \"surprisingly good.\"\n\nFor the amateur creators the prize is the chance to be aired on VH1, which has been doing relatively well in audience ratings. In the fourth quarter 2006, VH1 saw its audience (18-49 year-olds) grow 9.3% to 246,000 daily viewers, according to Sanford Bernstein analysis of Nielsen numbers. By comparison, the 18-49 year-old audience for the more than 50 cable shows tracked by Nielsen grew 2.8% in the same period. In January, viewers grew 21% for VH1, but they fell 4% in February.\n\nAnticipating YouTube\n\nHirschorn attributes the channel's success to its inclusion of pop-culture programming, such as community interaction. \"We're a cultural arbiter,\" he said. \"We were blogging on television with the show 'I love the 80s,' where people commented on culture,\" he said. \"The whole sensibility of the network has had a bloggy sensibility.\"\n\nNow, with Acceptable TV, VH1 hopes to stay on the cutting edge of pop culture by partnering with Channel 101, a monthly festival of short films in which audience members get to participate by voting. Even its press release tries to get that point across by saying this: \"Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab became pioneers of the do-it-yourself TV movement with Channel 101, anticipating the YouTube revolution by a several years.\"\n\nCoincidentally, Viacom is in the throes of a copyright battle with YouTube, having sued the video-sharing site for $1 billion. Viacom also has a partnership with Joost, a new television platform, that the media giant hopes will usurp YouTube's dominant ranking among top video-sharing Web properties.\n\nWhile Hirschorn isn't involved in those discussions, he's doing what he can to take a bite out of YouTube.\n\n\"One of the problems with YouTube is that it's so big,\" he said. \"If you put one more drop in the ocean, whadifference does it make?\"\n\nAcceptable.TV will hopefully attract a more \"discerning audience\" or a \"comedy community that cares,\" said Hirschorn.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe amount of ink I dedicated to this show is not a reflection of how I think it will do in the ratings. I just think it's an interesting step in the evolution of video programming in the Internet era.\n\nToday, this hybrid format that includes user-generated content doesn't even have a name. But we seem to be at the forefront of something new that will marry traditional television and the Internet, with the online portion being the repository of all the user-generated stuff, and the television portion taking the best of the crop.\n\nIt's hard to know just how large this new genre will be as well and whether it'll be as popular and ubiquitous as the reality TV genre that led to the iconic American Idol series. Idol was the No. 1 show among 18-49 year olds in 2006, and it has been in the top 10 shows in the last four years, according to The Nielsen Company.\n\nAdvertisers pay some $620,000 for a 30-second spot on News Corp's American Idol. That equates to $33 CPM (1,000 impressions) as calculated by Sanford Berstein. Idol's advertising rate compares to the average 30-second spot of $20 CPM. It's estimated by the research firm that Idol generates about $200 million in revenue per season.\n\nAcceptable TV is hardly an American Idol. But it represents a new effort to tap into the nascent, but fast-growing market of online video advertisements.\n\nVideo advertising is estimated to grow 89% to some $775 million this year, which is less than 4% of the total online advertising pie, according to eMarketer. Meanwhile, cable television advertising grew 4% to $19 billion in 2006 while advertising to the big four networks, Fox, NBC, CBS and Walt Disney's ABC, grew 5%, according to Universal McCann.\n\nJust as reality TV appears to have captured a big audience over the last 15 years, it would seem that this new hybrid or user-generated genre may have a good shot of attracting one as well.\n\nInterestingly enough, professional comedic shorts appear to be the viewer's choice. A look at the top-viewed videos on Acceptable TV shows that the audience is drawn to the professionally-produced shows, such as \"Homeless James Bond,\" which was produced by Acceptable TV.\n\nBut Hirschorn submits that in the long run, user content might really produce some great talent, just like American Idol.\n\nIn the end, according to Hirschorn, the question is: 'Is this stuff [professional] actually better than amateurs?'\n\nSound-off: What would you call this genre and how do you see it evolving?
