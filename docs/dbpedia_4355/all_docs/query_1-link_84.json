Are they going to be doing new episodes of Undergrads? They have so much potential, but I think they waste it on shows like Jackass and Undressed. Undressed is the worst series ever, with lower production standards than day time soaps. I hate that show!\n\nVH1 has better series, and I like several of their original movies. I am also really looking forward to the new Strange Frequencies series. I will be sure to watch that to see how it is!\n\nBut does anybody here have MTV2? They play a great variety of music, and I hear new songs way before the radio stations around here are calling them \"new.\"\n\nJoe Tully\n\nI want the toilet seat.\n\nJoined\n\nMay 4, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n8,406\n\nLocation\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#4\n\nVH1. I really don't care for the current trends in music (boy bands, Britney, etc.) or the frankly stupid stuff that MTV runs like Undressed, Jackass, etc. Plus, Behind the Music is always interesting, even if it's about someone you don't really like. I watched the entire episode on Vanilla Ice, for chrissake! Pop Up Video is fun too. I don't watch a whole lot of music-related TV (is MTV still music-related?) but when I do it's usually VH1, or on rare occasions MTV2 which has some good videos. I agree with Calhoun, I think they show some older stuff on there, it is much better than MTV.\n\nColin\n\nOh... this is not good.\n\nJoined\n\nApr 22, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n5,382\n\nLocation\n\nBrick, NJ\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#5\n\nNot sure which to say, because I usually only watch either network when they play actual music... and I mean full songs, not the 1/4-song-crap you see on TRL... of course that's usually at like 3 AM =X\n\nHowever, if I were to turn my tv to a music channel during the daylight hours, it would probably go to VH1. They manage to keep their \"non-music\" programming music oriented, unlike MTV who'll do anything for ratings... I do, however, try to tune in to the not-so-\"Real World\" on MTV every Thursday... pretty much the only reality TV I'll watch... altho, I've seen bits of that Murder in Small Town X show and that seemed kinda intriguing... but that's a whole 'nother issue...\n\nThe Dork Knight\n\nThe saddles do what now?\n\nJoined\n\nMay 1, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n7,670\n\nLocation\n\nUpstate New York\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#6\n\nI have few favorite shows on MTV.\n\nCelebrity Deathmatch\n\nUndergrads\n\nJackass\n\nI only like TRL when they have GOOD music videos.\n\nWWF Sunday Night Heat\n\nVH1 Shows\n\nBehind The Music\n\nPop Up Video\n\nVH1 Across America\n\nBud 'n Lou\n\nLet me dirty up your mind\n\nJoined\n\nApr 27, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n1,396\n\nLocation\n\nYou know too much about me already.\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#7\n\nReal World's on Tuesdays! :O) But yeah, aside from having Real World, MTV's got nothing on VH1.

While I get both MTV and VH-1 I can't stand either. I prefer the Canuck channel Muchmusic becuase they actually play music. They only have about 2 - 3 hours a day of non-music oriented programming. The rest of the day is made up of music blocks. PLus we get specific blocks of punk music, rock, rapheavy stuff, techno, pop, etc...and the top 30 countdown. I think Muchmusic plays more music in a day than MTV does in a week.\n\nDarkAngel\n\nLord Vader\n\nJoined\n\nMay 1, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n6,140\n\nLocation\n\nOhio\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#9\n\nOriginally posted by DickGrayson\n\nNeither.

At the moment, I'm not sure if that's still true or not. I like Behind the Music, The List (which may not be on anymore), and a lot of the concert footage they've shown. I'm a huge Beatles fan and on many occassions they've shown Beatles videos, McCartney concerts and interviews, etc. I've loved that.\n\nThe Mad Hatter\n\nWhyyyyy'sis heead so biiiiiig?\n\nJoined\n\nApr 25, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n5,446\n\nLocation\n\nMiddle o' the U.S.\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#10\n\nThe one that actually shows videos on a regular basis. Wait, that's neither of them.\n\nVH1 usually annoys me less, since MTV tries to be too hip for its own good. I thought my frustration with that channel was because I'm rapidly becoming an old fart, but the younger folks I've talked to have noticed the same things.\n\nM2 is a godsend... but if they only showed it around here! I know a friend whose parents (across the state) get it, and every time he visits he takes a tape, pops it in the VCR and records M2 for eight hours or so.\n\nThen again, I hear MTV is really going to revive its animation block, so maybe there's hope.\n\nVin\n\nHi!\n\nJoined\n\nApr 20, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n5,057\n\nLocation\n\nn/a\n\nAug 21, 2001\n\n#11\n\nI perfer....\n\nOriginally posted by Bird_Boy\n\nYeah..another one of those comparison threads..\n\nSo..which one DO you like better?

I REALLY loved the Lyricists Lougne Show on MTV, their comedy variety show. I would buy that series on DVD I loved it so much.\n\nAnother thing MTV2 has going for it...120 Minutes!!!!
