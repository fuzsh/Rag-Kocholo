        "text": "VH1, in collaboration with Big Fish Entertainment (an MGM Company), announced today its new series, \"Cartel Crew,\" will premiere Monday, January 7th at 9:00 pm ET/PT. Set in Miami, Fla., \"Cartel Crew\" takes a deep look into the lives of eight DESCENDANTS of the Cartel life as they navigate adulthood and the effects the legacy has had on their upbringing. Now disconnected from their past, they want to make a name for themselves outside of the drug world, but find that escaping the shadows of their ancestors will come with a price. Money, friendships and love are on the line in this redemption story about LIFE AFTER narcos.\n\nMeet the Crew:\n\nMichael Blanco, @michaelcorleoneblanco\n\nMichael Blanco grew up surrounded by crime. The youngest son of Griselda Blanco (the \"Cocaine Godmother\"), he followed his mother's footsteps into the drug world. For 33 years he led a criminal lifestyle, but after his mother's assassination, he decided to quit the Cartel life and launch a personal clothing brand, \"Pure Blanco,\" to prove he could lead a legal business and life.\n\nMarie Ramirez-D'Ariano, @lil_ms.monroe\n\nMarie was born into the cartel life. While her father kept his business private, THE FAMILY heard rumors of his dealings. Now grown, she's lost touch with her family largely because of her relationship with Michael Blanco. She's given up everything for the man she loves and is devoted to \"Pure Blanco,\" although she has a few SECRETS in her past that may shock even the unflappable Michael Blanco.\n\nKat \"Tatu Baby\" Flores, @tatubaby\n\nAfter the assassination of her cartel-affiliated father, Kat and her mother fled from New York to Miami, leaving their old life behind. Kat's focus now is raising her son and dealing with the prison release of her son's father, Eddie.\n\nStephanie Acevedo, @stephs_music\n\nDaughter to a former career cocaine trafficker, Stephanie's childhood was torn apart when her father was arrested and sent to federal prison. Now she is determined to move on from the past and make a name for herself as a singer through dignity and hard work.\n\nNicole Zavala, @realnicolezavalaz and Michael Zavala, @zavalaconcepts\n\nTwins Nicole and Michael grew up enjoying the spoils of cartel life, without losing a loved one to prison or murder. While they strive to be accepted in the community, they clash with others who don't believe they grew up with a legitimate tie to the cartel.\n\nCarlos \"Loz\" Oliveros, @iamloz_\n\nAfter a member of his family was murdered, allegedly by the cartel, Loz stepped away from a life of crime. He is currently focusing on his career as a tattoo artist and raising his daughter while avoiding demons from his former life.\n\nDayana Castellanos, @dayanac__\n\nAfter serving two years in prison for her role in running cartel-connected marijuana grow houses, Dayana is trying to make up for lost time with her four children and start a new life.\n\nAhead of the season premiere, VH1 is giving fans an early sneak peek of \"Cartel Crew\" with a special advance premiere of the first ten minutes starting Monday, December 31 via the VH1 app and VH1.com.\n\nFor more information and exclusive content, visit www.cartelcrew.vh1.com.
