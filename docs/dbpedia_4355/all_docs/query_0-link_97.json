        "text": "Here they are now, entertaining us - or at least entertaining VH1, which named Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" the greatest song of the past quarter-century.\n\nThe Seattle band's groundbreaking grunge anthem is No. 1 on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years.\"\n\nThe whole countdown will air over five nights, starting at 10 p.m. EDT Monday on the video music channel.

The dam broke when 'Teen Spirit' came out.\"\n\nWhile no one performer or group dominated the countdown, which was chosen by a panel of VH1 executives, several had two songs featured.\n\nMichael Jackson had the second-highest song, \"Billie Jean,\" and was at No. 40 with \"Beat It.\" Eminem reached No. 4 with \"Lose Yourself,\" while his \"My Name Is\" was No. 85.
