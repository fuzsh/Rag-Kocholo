        "text": "As a child, I regularly skimmed through the digital cable channel guide and was overwhelmed by the sheer number of channels. Back then, I didn’t realize that several digital cable channels were mostly built to air endless reruns of shows exiled from their main networks. However, this helped introduce various shows to a new audience that didn’t see them before. One of these channels was VH1 Classic, now known as MTV Classic, and one show that I remember seeing reruns of as late as 2015 was none other than Pop-Up Video.\n\nPop-Up Video originally premiered new episodes on VH1 from 1996 to 2002, and it was briefly revived in 2011 before ending in 2012. After its original run ended, it was frequently reran on VH1 Classic for a while. The premise doesn’t sound too exciting on paper, but the presentation elevates it. Five music videos are shown, sometimes with a connecting theme, like showcasing the solo work of all the Beatles or showing videos with a Y2K theme, including U2’s “New Year’s Day,” Prince’s “1999,” and “It’s the End of the World as we Know It (And I Feel Fine)” from R.E.M. Remember Y2K? Anyway, most of the time, I remembered that it was just random videos. The catch, however, was that little bubbles of facts and trivia about the band or particular video would pop up, hence the name. Before Wikipedia was a household staple, this was a pretty novel way to find out more about your favorite artists or music videos.\n\nThe show became a popular program for VH1, and this success inspired the network to try and expand the brand a little further. Naturally, this means developing a spin-off. In 2000, VH1 premiered the short-lived Pop-Up Quiz.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fknG8NbhBkw\n\nProduced by the same company as Pop-Up Video, Pop-Up Quiz retains the bubbles showing up on screen during music videos. Instead of simply sharing trivia, however, they provide the viewer with questions to answer. The specific type of question varies from video to video. In the episode above, the Celine Dion video has simple true or false, or “Oui or No,” questions about the singer herself.\n\nFor the Rolling Stones’ “Waiting on a Friend,” viewers have to guess which member of the group the question is referring to.\n\nAlso included in the episode are filling in Phil Collins quotes by picking out of three options, and guessing, during a Richard Marx video, which Marx did it: Richard, Karl, or Groucho. While these games can provide some insight into the artist, they don’t really delve into the video itself all that much, which Pop-Up Video did quite often. The only video in this episode that utilizes the video in its questions is Jewel’s “You Were Meant For Me.” Here, a question is asked, and the answer is a color, object, or anything else that is in the video after the question is asked. Even then, there’s really no insight into the production of the video itself, like this show’s predecessor.\n\nFocusing on the trivia behind the video playing warrants the pop-up treatment a bit more than simple trivia games do, in my opinion. Except for those in the Jewel song, the questions on this show could have just as easily been asked on a typical music game show with contestants. Maybe other episodes provide more video insight, but for now it seems a bit unnecessary. I can see how the pop-up bubbles could add a little suspense and make it fun to play with friends while you are watching, though.\n\nThe branding for this show does a solid job of distinguishing itself from Pop-Up Video. Whereas that show used heavy amounts of blue, Pop-Up Quiz uses plenty of pink. It also feels like a game show, particularly with the curtain in the beginning and in-between songs, as well as the robot head introducing each game and saying the title in the opening sequence. Its voice when introducing the games, however, when combined with the robotic filter over it, can get a bit annoying at times. The title-speaking voice is a little better, as it sounds kind of like an Animal Crossing villager.\n\nWith all of this being said, I prefer Pop-Up Video’s branding. The shot of the trivia category icons spinning in the bubbles and the consistent font in the opening stick out in particular. Quiz uses several fonts in its intro, which makes it feel a bit more disjointed. Quiz has a fine intro song, but it does not hold a candle to Video’s. Just hearing it makes me want to sing “Pop-Up Video” along with it. The extended version in the credits is also still a certified banger all these years later. I also like how Video has one bubble take up the entire screen at the end of the song, and then has bubbles take up the screen for a solid five seconds. Just a nice little breather in-between songs.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChaseIsDaAce/status/1553073094289489922\n\nWhereas Pop-Up Video enjoyed reruns for years, Pop-Up Quiz was not as lucky. Despite the episode above being during a marathon, this was the only episode that I could find online. Yes, this show is lost media. While I simply think that this show is simply okay, very few pieces of media deserve to be lost. Obscure media from the past can provide some interesting insight about how media was produced and consumed back then. Every piece of media was the result of a lot of work from a lot of people, and it would be a shame if all of their effort is never to be seen again by another pair of eyes. I would love to see more Pop-Up Quiz turn up online in the future. Maybe if another episode resurfaces, I would play along with some family or friends."
