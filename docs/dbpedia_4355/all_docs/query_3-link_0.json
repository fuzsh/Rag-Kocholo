        "text": "American cable television network\n\nTelevision channel\n\nVH1 (originally an initialism for Video Hits One) is an American Basic Cable television network that launched on January 1, 1985, and is currently owned by the BET Media Group subsidiary of Paramount Global's CBS Entertainment Group based in New York City. The network was originally owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment; a division of Warner Communications, and the original owner of then-sister channel MTV at the time. It was launched in the channel space of Turner Broadcasting System short-lived Cable Music Channel.\n\nVH1 was originally conceived to build upon the success of MTV by playing music videos targeting a slightly older demographic focusing on the lighter, softer side of popular music.[2] Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music and into reality television programming; albeit with a focus on music personalities, celebrities, and shows targeting African-American audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as Behind the Music, the I Love… series, the Celebreality block, Love & Hip Hop, and Basketball Wives.\n\nAs of December 2023, VH1 is available in approximately 67,481,000 American households;[3] down from 90.2 million in January 2016.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of VH1\n\nVH1, an acronym for Video Hits One, launched on January 1, 1985 over the channel space of Turner's Cable Music Channel.[5][6] The channel originally focused on music and programming aimed at older audiences than its sibling channel at the time, MTV.[7]\n\nOn August 27, 1985, parent company Warner Communications sold 31% of VH1 and its siblings (MTV and Nickelodeon; which were already divested by Warner into MTV Networks) to Viacom.[8][9] Viacom would eventually buy the remaining 69% of MTV Networks from Warner for $326 million on May 20, 1986.[10][11] By 1989, VH1's music programming would cater to Top 40, adult contemporary, classic rock, and 1980s mainstream pop.[12] During the 1990s, VH1 would gain popularity for original music-related programs such as Pop-Up Video and Behind the Music.\n\nIn the 2000s, VH1 would begin to scale down its music offerings, while shifting its focus to pop-culture and nostalgia-based programming; including reality television shows focused on celebrities, and various documentaries and panel shows. Headlining this programming shift would be VH1's Celebreality block, featuring The Surreal Life & its franchise of various spinoffs. One spin off, Flavor of Love, proved to be a ratings success, and is cited by observers as the beginning of the network's programming leaning towards shows about African-American personalities (such as the Basketball Wives and Black Ink Crew franchises; similar to BET and its sister networks.[13][14] In 2011, VH1 debuted the first installment of the Love & Hip Hop franchise; which would go on to become the network's longest-running program.\n\nOn November 9, 2022, it was announced that oversight of VH1 would move to the BET Media Group under Scott Mills.[1]\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal programming currently seen on VH1 includes the Love & Hip Hop and the Basketball Wives franchises.
