        "text": "Background\n\nVH1 Films was the film production division of VH1, which was owned by Viacom until it merged with CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) in 2019. Current and future VH1 movies are currently produced by MTV Entertainment Studios.\n\n1st Logo (September 28, 2001)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, pulsing circles quickly zoom in. They pan left and shine to form the 1998-2003 VH1 channel logo with \"Music First\" (its slogan from 1994-2003) under it. Next to it is the word \"FILMS\" in a narrow upper-case font, fading in next to the logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on Zoolander.\n\n2nd Logo (November 4, 2006)\n\nVisuals: The camera moves across a body of water at sunset and stops upon an island where a giant 2003-2013 VH1 Network logo (without its cube) with the text \"FILMS\" next to it is shown. A human figure walks up a flight of stairs and opens a small door in the logo (where a blue light is beaming, indicating a party) and walks inside. The door then closes.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A somber organ/piano tune, changing to techno music when the door opens. After the door closes, there is a brief orchestral flourish sounding similar to the end of the 1999 Warner Bros. theme (\"Crescendo Finale\" by Peter Siedlaczek)."
