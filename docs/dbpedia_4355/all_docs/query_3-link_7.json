Get started free here.\n\nGet started with a 14 days free trial.\n\nNo credit card required.\n\nVH1 (originally conceived as Video Hits One) is an American basic cable television network owned by ViacomCBS. Originally created as a sister channel to MTV with music videos focusing mainly on a slightly older demographic than MTV by aiming at the lighter, softer side of pop music.\n\nSimilar to MTV, VH1 eventually stepped away from music videos and drifted into the direction of reality television programming with a focus on music personalities and celebrities, and shows targeting mostly female audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as Behind the Music, the I Loveâ¦ series, Love & Hip Hop, and many other shows. The service also features Live TV and podcast.\n\nCurrent original programming on VH1 include the Love & Hip Hop, Black Ink Crew, and Basketball Wives franchises. Other noteworthy shows include RuPaul's Drag Race, reruns and new episodes of Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out (which originated on MTV), and Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party. VH1's current programming is noted to chiefly focus on urban music genres and incline towards African American personalities.\n\nThere are international variants of VH1 available in several parts of the world but the fullest catalog of videos and shows is available on the US version of the streamer. The service can be watched via a web browser, on iOS and Android devices, Roku, Apple TV, Android TV and Amazon Fire TV.\n\nIf you are traveling anywhere outside the US or love music videos but you are living in another part of the world, you wonât be able to stream its content as your IP will be detected as not coming from the US and your stream will be blocked. Unless you use Getflix Smart DNS which will make it possible for you to access VH1 outside US.\n\nSmart DNS also opens the window for dozens of other geo-restricted services supported by Getflix from all over the world.\n\nHow to watch American VH1 outside US with Smart DNS\n\nSmart DNS makes your IP invisible without actually changing it.
