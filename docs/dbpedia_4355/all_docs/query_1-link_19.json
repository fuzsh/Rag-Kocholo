There are many trend stories and profiles, as well as news from around the world. Coverage also includes business, technology, entertainment, travel, movie and book reviews, television, food, fashion, health and sports. The paper is broken down into the sections News, Money, Sports, Life, Travel, Tech and Weather. It also makes heavy use of color and graphics. Lead times vary for departments and reporters. The ad rates in their media kit are based on modular sizes. Editors and reporters honor non-disclosure agreements on a case-by-case basis. They also publish an e-Edition copy of the print publication and a Saturday-Sunday e-edition called USA Today EXTRA. It was founded in 1982. As of fall 2010, the paper underwent a staff and content restructuring with a push towards developing content towards platforms other than print, such as mobile device applications and other digital formats. Newly-designed content rings consist of the sections Your Life, Travel, Breaking News, Investigative, National, Washington/Economy, World, Environment/Science, Aviation, Personal Finance, Autos, Entertainment, and Tech. The Your Life section provides information on health and well-being and runs Monday through Thursday, featuring a different theme each day: Mondays focus on \"thrive\" issues and cover preventive health and fitness and also include inspirational and motivational features; Tuesdays feature \"care\" topics including parenting, care-giving, volunteering and philanthropy; Wednesdays highlight \"nourish\" issues such as diet and nutrition; and Thursdays focus on \"shine\" topics such as beauty, grooming, self confidence, life management and personal achievement.
