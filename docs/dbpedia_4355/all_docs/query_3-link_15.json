        "text": "I have had this app for a while and thought by now they would have improved it. Watching my reality shows on here is painful sometimes. I have actually rewatched shows on my tv after I had already watched here and realized somehow I missed a whole section of the show. There have been times that I will be watching and for no reason the episode will just start over. Plus most of the time (not all but most) if you leave the app then go back in, it jumps back to the beginning of your episode and you have to scroll through to figure out where you left off. The episodes start from new to old but if you are watching episode 3 it automatically goes to episode 2 when you finish instead of going to 4 which makes no sense at all. The commercials are terrible and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. I understand we have to watch them in order to get the free app but they could at least be normal commercials that you see on TV. Some of these look like my children produced them. I had to sit through 20 seconds of a child swimming and doing flips in a pool with no words, no promoting, nothing. Umm ok. Then they promote stores and events all in FL lol. Iâm in NJ and canât figure out how to change the settings. We get it, Ace Hardware pays a lot to promote with VH1! I canât remove closed caption to save my life which drives me crazy. But you get what you pay for I guess lol thank god for on demand with cable!\n\nDealing with this app takes up so much of your time just to watch one tv show or one episode. I can start off watching a show, cast it to my tv then boom the sound is off but you can hear other parts of the show playing or a commercial playing over it. The app will be casting the show and it starts to lag. Iâm on the beginning of the show but the sound is on the middle of the show. I click a certain episode then it plays another episode I didnât select to watch. I have to stop casting, close the app, re open the app, find my episode, cast it to the tv, then for what, for me to have to do the steps all over again?! This is absolutely frustrating. It should not take you 30 mins to an hour to get the app to function just to watch one episode or one show. Youâre better off just watching vh1 straight from your cable Provider because this app just isnât it. Iâve uninstalled and reinstalled and Iâm have the same issues. Then you would expect the next episodes to continue, nope the current episode that youâre watching will play at least 5 times before the app just stops casting. Iâm definitely deleting this app because itâs not worth the hassle.\n\nI personally love VH1 and all of the shows that it airs. I personally donât always have the time to watch my favorite shows live which is why I downloaded the app. Iâve have the app for well over 6 Months and honestly no matter how many times thereâs an update the problems never seem to get fixed. Often times in the middle of watching a show the sound will cut off and video will just play on its own, when I try to rewind I get hit with a bunch of commercials I donât feel like watching. Speaking of commercials, this app plays too many of them & they all seem to be the same exact commercials that honestly gets so tiring. With this new update, if I were to accidentally lock my phone or interrupt the show in any way the entire thing starts over from the beginning and as I fast forward I have to sit through the same boring commercials. You have to have a lot of patients when dealing with this app but truth be told itâs honestly easier to just watch a show live on tv."
