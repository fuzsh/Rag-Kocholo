        "text": "THE FISH...\n\nBig Fish Entertainment is a full service content production company that creates visually-driven reality, branded, and formatted programming for broadcast, new media, and beyond. Expect the unexpected. From VH1’s mega-hit multi-series franchise Black Ink Crew, to Esquire’s groundbreaking Bomb Patrol Afghanistan, from the Under the Bulb campaign that launched the .CO brand, to the Gates Foundation Reality PD public schools project, Big Fish captures and relates extraordinary worlds, characters, and stories that entertain. Since the company’s launch , Big Fish has produced cable programming and digital work for top television networks including: Amazon, History, Discovery, Reelz, VH1, A&E, TLC, MTV, WE, E!, National Geographic, Oxygen, Planet Green, Travel Channel, Spike, Smithsonian Network, and G4. Dan Cesareo founded the company in 2006, and has since produced hundreds of hours of award winning and top-rated programming in the Live, unscripted, reality, lifestyle, and documentary space.\n\nWHY BIG FISH?\n\nFor us, the name Big Fish is aspirational and ironic. We started small but have never lacked in our boldness. Even when we were a company of few, we always thought and dreamt big. Big characters. Big stories. Big ratings. BIG FISH."
