        "text": "A veteran television programmer likes to say there are three kinds of programs: ones that inform, ones that entertain, and others that let the audience revel in the embarrassment and misery of others.\n\nThat third category has come to define VH1, and possibly also imperil it.\n\nKnown for most of its years as a music channel, VH1 has spent the last five years positioning itself as a destination for a genre it calls “celebreality”: ostensible examinations of the real lives of outrageous celebrities.\n\nThe downsides of that down-market approach are becoming evident, especially in the public condemnation VH1 has received this month after one of its contestants apparently murdered his ex-wife and committed suicide. Media coverage of the murder case stoked new criticisms of the channel’s reliance on cheap dating competitions that feature immodest women, skirt-chasing men and other fame-seekers.\n\nExecutives at VH1, a unit of Viacom, call these shows “loud.” Critics label the shows tawdry, demeaning to women and minorities, and off-putting to advertisers. Both groups agree that they are popular, as the top shows regularly draw two million viewers.\n\nVH1’s president, Tom Calderone, says he wants to diversify the channel’s programming. “It’s important for us that we’re not famous for one thing,” Mr. Calderone said more than once in a telephone interview last week in the wake of the murder. The channel is introducing new shows led by B-list, rather than D-list, celebrities, and is bringing back some of its retired music franchises.\n\nThe “celebreality” strategy “has given us an opportunity to define what VH1 stood for and still stands for, as one of our buckets, but it isn’t the overall riding definition of what we are anymore,” Mr. Calderone said, identifying redemptive shows as another category.\n\nBut judging by its schedule and ratings, VH1 and its viewers still seem to be hooked. In July only two of VH1’s 21 weekly prime time hours were “completely celebreality-free,” said Bill Graff, an analyst for CableU, a firm that monitors cable programming.\n\nViacom moved in the 1990s to make VH1 a music brand destination for MTV graduates. It was the era of music video countdowns, “Pop Up Video” and the program that became perhaps its best-known, “Behind the Music,” which smartly profiled music stars.\n\nBy the beginning of the current decade, the music focus was starting to sound stale. Under the firm thumb of Brian Graden, the MTV programming visionary executive who is leaving Viacom this year, VH1 shifted more toward reality fare, hitting pay dirt in 2004 with “The Surreal Life,” a castoff from the WB network that showed the conflicts and courtships of so-called celebrities. A bounty of spinoffs followed.\n\nWith stars like the rapper Flavor Flav and Bret Michaels, best known for being in the band Poison, VH1 retooled itself as a home for reality competitions. Mr. Calderone calls them comedic game shows.\n\nBut the channel now lacks momentum, analysts say, as many of its dating programs (“I Love Money,” “Real Chance of Love,” “Daisy of Love,” and others) are seemingly indistinguishable.\n\nIts biggest hit this year is “For the Love of Ray J,” a copycat dating competition with a hip-hop star at the center of the show. A second “Ray J” show is in production.\n\nMost of the “Love” shows are the work of 51 Minds Entertainment, an outside production company. The vetting process for the shows was sharply questioned after Ryan Jenkins, a contestant on two shows, was accused of killing his ex-wife in Orange County, Calif., two weeks ago.\n\nMr. Jenkins, who had a criminal record, was found dead in Canada on Aug. 23. One of the shows featuring Mr. Jenkins, “Megan Wants a Millionaire,” had recently had its premiere, and the other, “I Love Money 3,” was forthcoming. VH1 canceled both.\n\nOne TV critic wrote last week that even the murder and apparent suicide “can’t make the channel’s reputation much worse than it already is.”\n\nFormer VH1 executives have speculated that the sleazy nature of some of the “Love” shows repels advertisers, but the channel says otherwise.\n\nShelley Watson, a senior vice president and director of entertainment at the advertising and marketing agency RPA, said some advertisers “could maybe shy away” from the “Love” shows, but emphasized that those calls are made by individual companies.\n\n“It depends on what their programming restrictions are, and that’s a very individual thing,” she said.\n\nThe research firm SNL Kagan estimates that VH1 will bring in $361 million in ad revenue this year, down 12 percent from a high of $411 million two years ago. Analysts generally attribute the declines to the recession, not to the programming mix.\n\nVH1 is enviable for its demographic profile, Ms. Watson and others said. The channel, which has increased its audience over the last year, enjoys a particularly high concentration of women ages 12 to 24, and also does well with women ages 25 to 34 and men ages 12 to 34. The channel charges a premium for its “celebreality” block of programming.\n\nVH1 is “very versatile for us when we’re trying to target multiple audiences for a movie,” Ms. Watson said.\n\nNew shows like “The T.O. Show,” starring the professional football player Terrell Owens, and “My Antonio,” starring the actor Antonio Sabato Jr., were ordered in part to attract a more upscale advertiser base. With stories about celebrities who are between quarterlife and midlife crises, they may also draw a slightly older audience, helping to differentiate from MTV."
