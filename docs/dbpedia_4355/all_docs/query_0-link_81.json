        "text": "So, you think you know the '90s? NOT! From Seinfeld, the show about nothing, to Tickle Me Elmo, the hottest most annoying toy of the '90s, to Titanic, the biggest blockbuster in movie history, VH1's: I Love The 90s definitely is \"like a box of chocolates. you never know what you gonna get!\" VH1 is bringing its highly successful and hilarious I Love the 80s and I Love The 70s approach back for I Love The 90s, proving no decade is off limits. Viewers will get a '90s style dose of the music, movies, TV shows, products, fashions, fads, trends, scandals and major events that defined pop culture each year of the decade. From Beverly Hills 90210 to X-Files, flannel shirts to the \"Rachel\" hair do, from \"Rico Suave\" to Monica Lewinsky ... we will revisit it all from the uplifting to the ludicrous and everything in between. A new batch of comics, rock stars, actors, and other celebs from the present and, the not too distant, past will reflect on the '90s experience. They'll address all the major questions of the decade: Are those Bugle Boy Jeans you're wearing? What was everyone in Seattle so unhappy about? You down wit \"O.P.P\"? And most important of all: Where's Waldo?!?!?! Viewers will be gettin' jiggy with every aspect of '90s pop culture in each year of the most slammin' decade on record. We're not just talking music, TV and movies either. We mean everything: toys, scandals, fashion, cars and anything else that helped make the `90s \"Da Bomb\""
