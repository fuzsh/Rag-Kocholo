VH1’s esteemed “You Oughta Know” music discovery franchise extends its diverse roster of emerging musical talent into the new year with the addition of independent soul singer Russell Taylor (December 2013).

Taylor, a native of New York, will be deemed VH1’s “You Oughta Know” artist for the month of December 2013. Taylor has recently completed his independently produced album, “War of Hearts.” The second single, “Electric,” will be released in December ahead of the album’s January 2014 launch. “We couldn’t be happier with these outstanding additions to the franchise,” said Rick Krim, EVP Music and Talent Programming, VH1. “As an emerging artist with diverse musical influences and incredible talent, Russell Taylor is the embodiment of what the ‘You Oughta Know’ franchise is all about.” Russell Taylor, will benefit from significant cross-platform promotion via frequent music video plays, a custom promo spot, interviews on VH1’s music-oriented Tuner blog, VH1’s Top 20 Countdown, mention on VH1’s morning show “Big Morning Buzz Live” and much more.\n\nThe announcement follows on the heels of VH1’s inaugural “You Oughta Know Concert” special, which aired on Thursday, November 21 and has been streamed almost 200,000 times via web and VH1’s digital app. The concert featured performances by past and present VH1 “You Oughta Know” artists including Haim , Johnny Swim, Lorde, Ed Sheeran, Emeli Sandé, Matt Nathanson and The Lumineers. Since its launch in 2005, VH1’s “You Oughta Know” franchise has introduced promising new artists on the rise and served as a barometer for what and who’s hot in music today.

This highly acclaimed franchise has helped break artists such as Adele, Ed Sheeran, Foster the People, Gotye, The Lumineers, Mumford & Sons, The Civil Wars and many, many more.\n\nABOUT RUSSELL TAYLOR: Real artistry is about peeling back the layers of your soul and allowing the creative truth to take form. Russell Taylor taps into that creative space and unlocks a masterpiece in his latest musical offering, War of Hearts, on his own Indigo Blue label. Far from a novice in the music game, Russell – a self-professed nomad – has poured out his heart and soul on the world stages, including stops in London, Amsterdam and Paris as well as famed stateside venues from The Mint and The Roxy in Los Angeles to SOB’s and Joe’s Pub in New York. Through his travels, Russell has created a fan base as diverse as his multi-genre catalog of recordings. Russell’s previous offerings Somewhere In Between (2007), Confessional (a soundtrack), and ‘must have records’ (2010) are sprinkled with gentle gems like the alluring “2B Loved” and the stripped down, acoustic brilliance of “All Said & Done” to the sexually charged “Hands 2 Myself” and the military cadence of “Fair Game,” and have satisfied the appetites of music lovers the world over. Additionally, Russell has shared the stage with major artists from Mary J. Blige, Jill Scott and India Arie, to legends Isaac Hayes and Patti LaBelle; an amazing fete for an independent artist. Collaborating with Nicholas Ryan Grant and Salakida Kali, the Needlz (Lil’ Wayne, Bruno Mars, Swizz Beats) produced track “Foolish Heart” examines the joys and pains of a tumultuous love affair. “Love is pleasure. Love is pain. Without the fire, It don’t feel the same.” Grammy-winning super producer Needlz captured the soul of this angelic track. This ‘multi-genre-influenced’ soul-singer embraces the beautiful imperfections of his voice. “I have a pretty good range,” admits Russell. “It’s gravelly and [in the past] I didn’t like the sound of that. But the producers that I am working on with this album were like, ‘That’s what makes your voice beautiful. It’s dope! Push it! It’s genuine and authentic,” Russell’s creativity is not just relegated the musical genre; The Great White Way has called as well. Russell makes his Broadway directorial debut in Gems for one night only, November 8. 2012. This multi-hyphenate has also directed plays including For Colored Girls (New School University) as well mentoring urban youths of color in the arts. Real and honest are the elements that define the essence of War of Hearts and Russell has created the album he was born to make.\n\nSource: ma************@ao*.com“>Ra-Fael Blanco – 2R’s Entertainment & Media PR\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 7 Lil Baby\n\nAtlanta’s hip hop scene has been a breeding ground for talent, consistently producing artists who have redefined the genre and left an indelible mark on the music industry.

Tigger was and is a staple at BET (the only national African American cable network), hosting shows like BET’s number one music show “106 and Park,” “BET Style,” “BET Uncut,” and most recently, the “BET Awards 2012 Post Show.” Tigger has also had a wealth of successes as a host and DJ in radio and syndication. He has deejayed at WPGC (95.5) in Washington, D.C. and 92 Q in Baltimore, Md., as well as Power 105.1 (New York’s Hip-Hop & R&B Station) and now V103, “The People’s Station,” in Atlanta, Ga.\n\nBeing from B-More (Baltimore), I remembered how Tigger use to rock at WPGC and 92 Q. Working at two of the top radio stations in the region, man, the brother use to pull out all the stops. I remembered one night I was listening to one of his mixes, and I kid you not. This kat was hitting so hard that I pulled my little blue 1987 Toyota Camry to the side of the road, got out, and started dancing my ass off on the edge of the road. Lol!\n\nI have had an affinity for Big Tigger since then, but the deal was sealed when the crew and I met him during Ne-Yo’s Malibu Red event in the “A” (Atlanta) last summer. You know, sometimes people get a little fake when they are in the spotlight. However, you could tell this brother was genuine. He was not aware of who we were, yet he still gave us the time of day. He was cool, really down-to-earth, and just funny as hell. Moreover, that is why I gave Big Tigger the cover, not because he is Big Tigger (well, a little bit), but because at the end of the day he remains true to who he is, and he is not bad on the eyes. You know I cannot have no “Mitch” on the cover.\n\nNow, I had the opportunity to interview him personally and just to bullet-point without giving up all the details… I asked him to give me five things he would tell an artist to look out for if they are trying to get into the biz, and he said, “Get a good lawyer/manager cuz these dudes is shady!” Now that is all five things right there. Lol! It is that real! My interpretation is that no matter what, at the end of the day, it is about getting and keeping your business tight; nothing else matters. So it is true; some of these dudes and chicks out here are wicked. You gotta “keep ya game up!”\n\nSo during the interview, Big Tigger talked about the type of woman he likes; of course, we had to get that in for the ladies and those haters out there. He also talked about his passion and love for his work, his style of deejaying, his most memorable experience as a DJ, his favorite nightclubs, and what he has coming up for 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost people can explain explicitly what their love or passion is for why they do what they do. For example, a dancer could say, “When I dance, I transcend into my state of euphoria.” What experience do you feel when you’re at the height of your game (artistry)?\n\nTigger: There’s no better feeling than when you are in the zone, and whatever you say or play puts other people into their zone! Whether I am Deejaying or hosting, it is incredible to know whatever you do makes an impact in someone’s daily life!\n\nHow would you describe your style of deejaying?\n\nTigger: In a word, flexible! I can spin at clubs, NBA games, bah mitzvahs, on air, or at weddings. I can mix old-school hip-hop and r&b, pop, EDM, and trap music, and nobody will be mad at it. I can turn up in the club or keep it sexy!\n\nSo how’s the love life? What’s your type? What piques your interest?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTigger: Love life is awesome! A woman of class, intelligence, drive, goals, inner and outer beauty, and a humorous/silly side to her are all desired qualities in a woman. I love a flexible woman who can turn up in hood environments and navigate corporate events. Add “lady in the street and a freak in the bed, ” and you have perfection!\n\nWould you still do it if you were not paid to DJ or create music?\n\nTigger: I would. I have been deejaying since age 15! I do not get paid for my podcasts, but I love doing them. I have done 49 FREE podcasts (available on iTunes) in the last two years and 2.9 million downloads later, and I am still excited every time I drop a new one!\n\nSometimes entertainers create a persona that’s not their true self. What elements make up who you are, and are the persona and you as a person one within the same?\n\nTigger: I have been blessed to be very successful while being myself. Big Tigger is my more outgoing side, but it is still the real me. I am kind of quiet when not out in public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas there ever a time when you doubted who you were or what you wanted before your current successes?\n\nTigger: I never doubted who I was. I still have doubts about the future from time to time about everything. It is human nature.\n\nWhat is your most memorable experience while deejaying at nightclubs and events?\n\nTigger: I opened for Kid Capri at the NBA Players’ official ball when All-Star was in D.C. with Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Dr. J, and others in the building, and I smashed! It was dope to have Magic Johnson come up to me and say, “Boy, you were rocking!” Also, back in the days when No Limit was crazy, I Deejayed a homecoming party in Virginia State, and when I dropped “Make Me Say Uhhhhh” after about three other No Limit joints, the illest fight broke out cuz people got too damn hyped! They almost threw a dude from the 2nd floor!\n\nOf all the acts you have worked with, who is the most enlightening about artistry?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTigger: I haven’t Deejayed for many artists, but I recorded, shot a video, and performed on tour with R. Kelly! Amazing to watch him work on four songs at once!\n\nTell us about your upcoming projects.\n\nTigger: I am re-launching my website BigTigger.com and started my new Big Tigger Foundation! The Big Tigger Celebrity Classic began in June 2014, and this time it is in Atlanta for its 10th year! I am the new official DJ of the Atlanta Hawks, and I have some other things in development, but can’t let that out yet!\n\nWhat is your perception of the progression of dance and electronic music in North America? Where do you see it in the next five or ten years?\n\nTigger: EDM is HUGE! I am good at it but wish I was exceptional at it… I see DJs spinning in front of 10,000 to 30,000 in stadiums and wish I could get down like that. If I applied myself, I could get to that level, but I am not passionate about it like Hip Hop & R&B! I think it is here to stay but will evolve as it already has with Trap-House, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemixes and nightclub appearances are the bread and butter for any DJ. Also, successful remixes help build a DJ’s status and provide more work and opportunities. Which of your projects would you say was the most successful (in overhaul experience), and what was the most important lesson learned from that project?\n\nTigger: I would say the five years I spent as DJ for the Washington Wizards! It gave me exposure to different groups of people and corporations! That exposure allowed me to spin for the Redskins, Maryland Terps, Kentucky Wildcats, Macy’s, and others. Corporate checks are awesome!\n\nWhat are your top-7 party venues?\n\nTigger: In no specific order: Reign in Atlanta, Bamboo in Miami, Park in DC, Beamers/Prive in Dallas, LIV in Miami, Dream in Miami, and Rehab in Vegas.\n\nWhat would you tell them if you could mentor any young man or woman out there wanting to get into the music business?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTigger: Get a good lawyer/manager cuz these dudes are shady!\n\nConnect with Big Tigger:\n\nTwitter: @BigTiggerShow Facebook: BigTiggerShow Instagram: @BigTiggerShow Podomatic: BigTiggerShow\n\nInterview By Patrick Kelly | Twitter: @PrettyboyPK\n\nPhoto By: Insana Collins\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out Dawn Richard and her new album “Goldenheart.”\n\nThe music industry is one of the most challenging industries to break into and gain success. Moreover, while so many talented people are vying for discovery, success, and fame, one would do better playing the lottery than becoming a pop star. At least with the lottery, you only have to purchase a ticket and pray that your number comes up and not go through the rigors of chasing fame and fending off con artists, crooks, and liars. The cost is minimal, not the excessive amounts major labels spend on their acts to recoup advances and build revenue. Let’s not speak about the fact that so many of your favorite major label artists, including the ones on TV and being chased by the paparazzi, may not be as successful and extravagant as they appear. They may not be in the most agreeable contracts, at least not for them, that is, signing their lives away for the glitz and bragging rights.\n\nThe independent music business is no better because all imprints or indies with major distributions have major label backing. Those indies (labels and artists) who are not privy to the support of a major label may not have the funds to promote a good quality record after being correctly mixed and mastered. Also, indie artists without a label, well, they are just in dire situations. They are trying to rub pennies together for a decent EP or mixtape. Like the economy, many are in a financial downturn, unable to afford actual production, properly mixed and mastered songs, $500 for a good website, $300 for a decent photographer, or even $100 for an adequately designed promotional flyer. Most of them take the cheap route only to net an unfavorable return.\n\nPromotion is the key to success in the music industry, and it causes many independent labels and artists alike to go limp because of the lack thereof. So while the internet has had a more favorable effect on artists wanting to produce and sell their music, the major labels have a better advantage over the indies because they have been at it longer. They have more money, connections, and know-how to play the game. Plus, most indie labels and artists do not have the proper administrative and legal support, promotional budget, tour support, recognition, and placement to become successful.\n\nNow if one happens to sign to a major label, have success, and is now traveling the daunting road to the other side, their luck is a lot better than a no-name artist. At least these once-major artists have name recognition, somewhat of a cash reserve, depending on whether they were screwed in their contracts, and a substantial following on social media, which is a precious thing to have as an artist. Let’s just say that having a built-in fanbase, great music, great photos, and promo videos shot with a Canon DSLR can work wonders for the success of an indie artist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this issue, we are so proud to feature on our 16th cover Miss Dawn Richard, who has been a part of Danity Kane and Diddy Dirty Money. Dawn released her debut album “Goldenheart” on her indie label, Our Dawn Entertainment, which Andrew “Druski” Scott majorly produces. “Goldenheart” hit No. 1 on the iTunes R&B album chart, and other subsequent successes from the album followed, including one million+ video views on Youtube and a distribution deal with Altavoz. She is to be commended for her efforts because that was a very BRAVE thing to do! Going solo after being in two successful groups takes kahunas! Going solo and indie simultaneously, some may consider this a death wish compared to major label figures. However, Dawn was BRAVE and determined to head her label and “make it work” with few counterparts at the helm.\n\nWe have had the opportunity to sit down with Dawn Richard in a Q&A, and this is what she had to say…\n\nLove. Loss. Redemption. How significant are these three words to you, and how have they paved the way for you finally becoming a solo artist?\n\nThey are words that define moments in my life, words that are so familiar, I feel, in most people’s lives. I took these words and made them Frames to an empty canvas. And with my music, I started painting.\n\nAny special person in the picture right now, or is it just all work and no play?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to play. Playing keeps me sane. I am too sensual not to play.\n\nHow’s your family doing after being uprooted from New Orleans to Baltimore? They must be so proud to witness your successes after such trying times.\n\nMy family would be proud of me if I carried groceries for a woman across the street. They are just amazing that way. But, yes, they are proud. I am proud to have such great people in my life. Where most expect parents to stop supporting you after you hit a specific place in your life, my parents never leave. I am lucky.\n\nInitially, I thought Diddy Dirty Money was a joke. However, by giving Diddy his props, he made a sound judgment in including you and Kaleena in the group. I thought you guys were amazing at how you came together to make music people were not ready for but did it so well. Just putting it out there, I would love to see you and Kaleena on a track together. It would be hot and dope, especially now that there is such change in the air; that renaissance. So would you be game for a Kaleena, Dawn collaboration?\n\nI would be game for any collab… with a great artist. She is great, and It would be like old times!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you told DJ Envy and the crew you did not want to wait for the major labels to release your album; you had to get the music out (paraphrasing). Why such fire and determination?\n\nPassion brings fire to the soul. I had a voice. I wanted it to be heard. An artist needs that outlet. With each album, I find amazing new talents and hidden gems along the way. When you find these “epic” moments, they cannot be confined. They should not be confined. They need to be free, to be given to the world. I needed my art to be given to the world on my terms.\n\n“Goldenheart” is the name of your first debut album on Our Dawn Entertainment, which is part of a trilogy to include albums “Blackheart” and “Redemptionheart.” What’s the significance of those names?\n\nEach moment for me signifies a color. Golden – Naive, Black – Loss, and Red- Redemption.\n\nDid Sean Combs offer any help in Our Dawn Entertainment start-up as well as the promotion of the album and videos?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am independent now. I left Bad Boy. Everything I do now is on me.\n\nWhat lesson can you tell our readers that you have learned in coming from being in the limelight, having other people worrying about your success, to now being in the hot seat as the boss, worrying about the bottom line?\n\nThis is life. This is the cycle. You learn. You practice. You apply.\n\nIn watching your interview with Power 105 DJ Envy, there seem to be some humbling life experiences, and I am not just speaking of what you and your family went through after Katrina. You spoke so openly about the hard road of starting a business and the blood, sweat, and sometimes not eating one goes through when trying to become successful. Can you speak on any decisions you had to make to get the label up and the album out that made you get some Ramen instead of linguine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli? Lol!\n\nWell, I had the Alfredo; I just made it myself. Lol. I am a hippie anyway. I never put a value on things as some do. I had a company. I wanted to win. So I slept on couches. I saved money. I walked everywhere. I made sacrifices to create the art. So it did not feel like a sacrifice. It felt like freedom. “I wasn’t worried about numbers and famous shit.” I was having fun building a brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Bogart of The Atlantic wrote, “Richard remains true to the oldest and most important standards of R&B.” With so many people saying or have said that R&B music is dead, what does Jonathan’s statement mean to you?\n\nI am happy people hear the root of where my music starts. Though I like to mix sounds and experiment with genres, I never lose focus of the root. R&B and soul drive the force of my sound. It is great when people get your vision. It means you do not dream alone.\n\nWith the success of “Goldenheart,” you are now revving up for the next album of the trilogy “Blackheart.” In watching the video on Kickstarter to raise awareness and get the fans (Hearts) involved, you said, “With a few, we do a lot.” Who are the involved parties in your group, and how have each contributed significantly to building that “family unit?\n\nIt is really my “aces in the whole” Kyle Cabrol and Kalub. They keep the ship running. It is insane to think it is just us. However, if you think about what we have done, you see only three of us. It puts things in perspective. Say what you will about numbers and all this bull, but one year off a major label, three projects, no label, a handful of people, and we had a number 1 each time. Not bad hearts. Not bad at all.\n\nYou said, “This is your chance to change the game, rewrite the rules, and rage against the machine.” What advice can you give another artist, such as yourself, who has to make that daunting decision about their music career?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrepare for war!\n\nWhat’s next for Dawn Richard with Our Dawn Entertainment and Blackheart?\n\nI will be starring in a film in 2014 produced by K. Hebron. I will be coming out with a Fall 2013 fashion collection called “Lion Ambition,” which we are partnering with Coal-n-Terry and many more surprises.\n\nInterview By: Patrick Kelly for USL Magazine\n\nAdvertisement"
