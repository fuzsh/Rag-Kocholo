        "text": "We've been testing Paramount+ since the beginning and find that it's loaded with shows and movies from CBS, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and more.\n\nBest value\n\nParamount+\n\nPrice: $5.99–$11.99/mo. or $59.99–$119.99/yr.\n\nFree trial: 7 days\n\nOn-demand library: 36,000+ titles\n\nLive channels: 30+\n\nBy Bill Frost\n\nMar 5, 2024 | Share\n\nIs Paramount Plus worth it?\n\nParamount+ spreads the entertainment love more evenly and widely than its predecessor CBS All Access, which was much more heavily focused on the Star Trek franchise. We think it’s a pretty good deal, which is why we named its premium tier the Best Value streamer of 2024.\n\nIn all, Paramount+ features around 30,000 shows from CBS, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, BET, MTV, VH1, and other channels, and hundreds of movies from the Paramount Pictures library. It’s a lot like CBS All Access, plus more.\n\nCBS All Access fans won’t find anything to complain about with Paramount+, and newcomers will probably be less confused—it’s not just about CBS TV shows. We thought CBS All Access was OK; Paramount+ comes much closer to good (but not quite perfect) with more content from all of ViacomCBS’s networks, plus a bundle with SHOWTIME that takes the service to the next level.\n\nCheap plans and bundles\n\nDeep library of TV shows and movies\n\nLocal CBS livestream ($11.99 version)\n\nGreat value with SHOWTIME tier\n\nUnskippable Paramount+ ads\n\nSmall lineup of originals\n\nNeed better internet speeds for streaming?\n\nIf you have multiple devices in your home using the internet simultaneously, or your internet speeds just aren’t up to snuff, you may not be getting the best streaming TV experience.\n\nEnter your zip code to check out better speeds or prices available from internet providers in your area.\n\nPlease enter a valid zip code.\n\nJump to:\n\nPlans and pricing\n\nParamount Plus vs. the competition\n\nShows on Paramount Plus\n\nSpecs and features\n\nParamount Plus free trials and deals\n\nParamount+ offers a seven-day free trial period to try out the service. You can also sign up for a full year of Paramount+ for 50% off—an excellent discount that can seriously add up.\n\nFor more ways to save, check out our Paramount+ Deals page.\n\nParamount Plus plans and pricing\n\nPlan Price Hours of content Video Streams Details Essential (with ads) $5.99/mo. 30,000+ 1080p, 4K 3 View plan Paramount+ with SHOWTIME (no ads) $11.99/mo. 30,000+ 1080p, 4K 3 View plan\n\nData effective as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nParamount+ recently increased its ad-supported tier by a dollar, from $4.99 a month to $5.99 a month. The new, cheaper Essential plan also dropped local CBS station live TV streaming, as well as offline downloads for mobile viewing.\n\nAlso, be aware that “no ads” on the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME plan only applies to on-demand content—you’ll still see ads on live channels and sports.\n\nParamount Plus vs. the competition\n\nService Price Video Streams Compatible devices Details Paramount+ $5.99–$11.99/mo. or $59.99–$119.99/yr. 1080p 3 12+ View plans Netflix $6.99–$22.99/mo. 1080p, 4K 2–4 14+ View plans Hulu $7.99–$17.99/mo. 1080p, 4K 2 13+ View plans Prime Video $8.99–$14.99/mo. or $139.00/yr. 1080p, 4K 3 13+ View plans Disney+ $7.99–$13.99/mo. or $139.99/yr. 1080p, 4K 4 13+ View plans Max $9.99–$20.99/mo. or $99.99–$209.99/yr. 1080p, 4K 2–4 10+ View plans Apple TV+ $9.99/mo. 1080p, 4K 6 7+ View plans Peacock $7.99–$13.99/mo. or $79.99–$139.99/yr. 1080p, 4K 3 12+ View plans Discovery+ $4.99–$8.99/mo. 1080p, 4K 4 12+ View plans\n\nData effective as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nParamount+ falls in the inexpensive end of the streaming pack, cheaper than Peacock. Only the ad-supported free tier of Discovery+ goes for less per month.\n\nShows and movies on Paramount Plus\n\nParamount Plus shows and movies\n\nWith over 30,000 hours TV shows and movies, Paramount+ can hold its own against corporate vault streamers like Peacock and Max. Like those two, Paramount+ features content-specific hubs: CBS, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Smithsonian Channel. You can also find shows, movies, and live TV through the top menu. We have a few recs in our What To Watch on Paramount+ guide, btw.\n\nYou’re able to watch the latest episodes of CBS shows the day after they’ve aired on CBS live TV, including comedies, dramas, late-night talk shows (like The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden), and news (like 60 Minutes, Face the Nation, and 48 Hours).\n\nThere’s also a deep trove of shows and stand-up specials from Comedy Central, as well as all 10 seasons of VH1 staple RuPaul’s Drag Race, and every Star Trek series and movie from the ‘60s forward. Previously aired CBS specials like The Grammy Awards can also be found on Paramount+.\n\nThere are a few high-profile omissions from Paramount+’s library. The big one you won’t find is popular Paramount Network drama Yellowstone, which streams seasons 1–4 exclusively on Peacock. If you’re looking for Kevin Costner’s Sons of Anarchy on a Ranch, it’s not on Paramount+. A close runner-up: former CBS series The Big Bang Theory (it’s on Max).\n\nThe Paramount+ live TV streaming channels (Premium plan only) are composed of CBS (your local station), CBSN (24/7 news), CBS Sports HQ (around-the-clock sports analysis and live games), and ET Live (Entertainment Tonight on a perpetual loop).\n\nShows on Paramount Plus (partial list):\n\nYoung Sheldon\n\nEvil\n\nThe Neighborhood\n\nFBI\n\nLove Island\n\nChappelle’s Show\n\nComedy Central standup specials\n\nDaria\n\nBar Rescue\n\nWings\n\nTosh.0\n\nKey & Peele\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nAll Rise\n\nCSI\n\nSurvivor\n\nThe Good Wife\n\nBeverly Hills, 90210\n\nBig Brother\n\nStar Trek series\n\nKids’ shows on Paramount Plus (partial list):\n\nPeppa Pig\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants\n\nThe Fairly Oddparents\n\nBlue’s Clues\n\nBob the Builder\n\nThe Backyardigans\n\nBubble Guppies\n\nCatDog\n\nAre You Afraid of the Dark?\n\nClarissa Explains it All\n\nDora the Explorer\n\nDoug\n\nCrashletes\n\niCarly\n\nKung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness\n\nInspector Gadget\n\nStrawberry Shortcake\n\nSuper Mario World\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nThe Thundermans\n\nMovies on Paramount Plus (partial list):\n\nIndiana Jones movies\n\nCharlie’s Angels: Full Throttle\n\nFrom Dusk till Dawn\n\nGrease\n\nThe Uninvited\n\nVanilla Sky\n\nFailure to Launch\n\nMinority Report\n\nBlack Sheep\n\nElection\n\nKingpin\n\nNacho Libre\n\nScrooged\n\nSahara\n\nSnow Day\n\nUp in Smoke\n\nAeon Flux\n\nStar Trek movies\n\nSHOWTIME on Paramount Plus\n\nSHOWTIME is now officially part of Paramount+, and you can no longer purchase it as a standalone service. Instead, you can find SHOWTIME content in the $11.99-a-month, ad-free “Paramount+ with SHOWTIME” plan. It’s a pretty good deal for a streaming bundle, and it grants you access to a lot of great content.\n\nSHOWTIME titles (partial list):\n\nBillions\n\nCouples Therapy\n\nDexter: New Blood\n\nQueer as Folk\n\nShameless\n\nThe Tudors\n\nYellowjackets\n\n1917\n\nBodies Bodies Bodies\n\nForrest Gump\n\nKinky Boots\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\n\nPearl\n\nThelma & Louise\n\nParamount Plus original shows and movies\n\nThe Paramount+ roster of exclusive originals is small but growing, and includes critical hits like The Good Fight, Why Women Kill, and the latest adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand. There are also several excellent Star Trek series and many TV hits from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan. Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies was also very good, but it disappeared from the service just a few weeks after its finale.\n\nOn the other side of the reviews, Jordan Peele’s Twilight Zone revival received mixed reactions and left the service, while so-so series Strange Angel and Tell Me a Story were canceled after two seasons. Apart from a small but growing number of gems, the value of Paramount+ isn’t yet in the originals.\n\nParamount Plus originals (partial list):\n\nMayor of Kingstown\n\n1883\n\nCriminal Minds: Evolution\n\nStar Trek: Lower Decks\n\nThe Game\n\nSchool Spirits\n\nThe Good Fight\n\nEvil\n\nMike Judge’s Beavis & Butt-Head\n\niCarly\n\nStar Trek: Discovery\n\nStar Trek: Picard\n\nParamount Plus live sports\n\nLive sports on Paramount+ will make soccer, golf, and college sports fans happy. But you’ll need the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME plan for the complete coverage roster. NFL games (including the Super Bowl on select years), NCAA March Madness matchups (excluding those aired on TBS, TNT, and truTV), and PGA Tour tournaments can be found on Paramount+.\n\nThe service also features a healthy lineup of UEFA and NWSL soccer coverage. It probably won’t cater to all of your sports needs, but Paramount+ has a bit more than most other on-demand streaming services.\n\nParamount Plus local channels\n\nYou get exactly one local channel with Paramount+: a live feed of your area CBS affiliate ($11.99-a-month tier only). Since all CBS shows are available on-demand, Paramount+ doesn’t offer a cloud DVR to record anything from its live feed.\n\nAlso, the live schedule doesn’t include any local or news programming, just CBS’s primetime series. You’ll have to find The Drew Barrymore Show on your own.\n\nParamount Plus specs and features\n\nParamount+ carries over the same specs and features from CBS All Access; no major overhauls came with the rebrand.\n\nMultiple streams\n\nPlan Included streams Offline downloads Paramount+ Essential 3 No Paramount+ with SHOWTIME 3 Yes\n\nData effective as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nAlong with its plans and pricing changes, Paramount+ also upped its simultaneous streams from two to three, which is the average for most streaming services (what’s up with two, Hulu?).\n\nThe Premium/SHOWTIME tier of Paramount+ allows for offline downloads of most content for viewing on-the-go, minus Comedy Central, BET, MTV, Smithsonian, and some Nickelodeon shows; the ad-supported tier does not.\n\nCompatible devices\n\nDevice Paramount+ Amazon Fire Cube, Stick, TV ? Android phones, tablets ? Android TV ? Apple TV (4th gen.) ? Apple TV 4K ? Chromecast, Chromecast with Google TV ? Echo Show ? iPhone, iPad ? LG TVs (select models) ? Nintendo Switch — NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro ? PC, Mac web browsers ? PlayStation 4, 5 ? Roku Ultra, Express, Premiere, Stick, TV ? Samsung TVs (select models) ? Vizio TVs (select models) ? Wii — Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X ? Xfinity X1 ?\n\nData effective as of post date.\n\nVideo and audio quality\n\nParamount+ primarily streams at 1080p HD for on-demand content, though live TV is more in the 720p range due to the nature of livestreaming. Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers can watch select programming in 4K, but only certain devices are supported. Either way, Paramount+’s 1080p resolution still looks (dilithium) crystal clear.\n\nThe Paramount+ home screen is fairly easy to navigate, with a top menu, six channel (or “Brand”) hubs, and descending rows featuring “Latest Full Episodes” from CBS, “Trending Shows,” “Recently Added Shows,” “On Now” livestreams, “Sports,” and more.\n\nWhile the shows and movies sections are neatly sortable by genre, like “Comedy,” “Drama,” “Documentary,” etc., the hubs don’t offer the same navigation. Sure, it would be redundant to search “Comedy” within the Comedy Central hub, but some specific options (like “Standup” or “Animation”) would be nice.\n\nParamount+ streams in standard 2.0 stereo audio. But like 4K video, Dolby Atmos audio is available to premium subscribers on select content.\n\nIs Paramount Plus worth the money?\n\nParamount+ is best for people looking for a streaming service that combines catalogs from many popular brands, like CBS, Comedy Central, BET, Nickelodeon, and MTV—that’s a gold mine of content by itself. Plus, the premium plan with SHOWTIME for $11.99 a month is a great deal we can’t ignore.\n\nHowever, while the original shows are getting better all the time, Paramount+ is going to have to step up production to compete with Netflix and Hulu. And Paramount+ doesn’t offer much for sports or movie fans. Unless you’re into international soccer and dusty flicks you haven’t watched since the last time you visited a Blockbuster Video, that is.\n\nParamount Plus FAQ\n\nWhat’s the difference between Paramount Plus and Paramount Network?\n\nParamount Plus and Paramount Network are different things. Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access) is an on-demand streaming service, while Paramount Network (formerly Spike TV) is a cable/satellite TV channel. Both are owned by ViacomCBS.\n\nParamount+ streams some shows from Paramount Network (like Bar Rescue and Ink Master) but doesn’t have the rights to other popular series (like Yellowstone and Lip Sync Battle).\n\nIs Yellowstone on Paramount Plus?\n\nKevin Costner cable hit Yellowstone, which first runs on Paramount Network, is not streaming on Paramount+. Since it’s not owned or produced by Paramount Network or ViacomCBS, the production company was free to shop Yellowstone to other streaming outlets. The first four seasons of Yellowstone are currently streaming on Peacock.\n\nHow much does Paramount Network cost?\n\nParamount Network can cost you anywhere from $5.99 per month (for select on-demand content on Paramount+) to roughly $50.00–$100.00 per month for a live TV streaming service or traditional cable TV provider that carries the channel.\n\nDid Paramount Plus replace CBS All Access?\n\nIn March 2021, Paramount+ became the new name of CBS All Access. Paramount+ is a rebrand, not a replacement, of the same streaming service, which will function as it did before, with new content additions from networks Comedy Central, BET, MTV, and Smithsonian Channel.\n\nWhat is the monthly cost of Paramount Plus?\n\nParamount Plus costs $5.99–$11.99/mo. or $59.99–$119.99/yr. In June 2023 the basic, ad-supported Paramount+ Essential plan increased its price from $4.99 to $5.99/mo., and the Premium plan (now renamed as Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) increased from $9.99 to $11.99/mo. Learn more about Paramount+ bundles here.\n\nHow do I get Paramount Plus for free?\n\nYou can get Paramount Plus for free with a free 7-day trial or by logging into the Paramount Plus app using your current cable, satellite, or live TV streaming login.\n\nWhy you should trust us"
