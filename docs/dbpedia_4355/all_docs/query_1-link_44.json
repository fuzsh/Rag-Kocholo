        "text": "Am I the only one who thinks the VH1 Classic channel has basically mirrored AMC in its descent to bland, mediocre, and generic programming?\n\nContast those two channels with, say, the evolution of TCM, which has only focused on adding a more academic/informational aspect edge to its presentation over the years. The historical context as well as focusing on themes and lesser-known films in specific genres has made it much more \"scholarly\" while remaining entertaining.\n\nVH1 Classic could have been the \"BBC 4\" of rock music but it appears it has no interest in becoming more discriminating... I'm not a huge fan of metal music, but I thought the style, format, and presentation of \"That Metal Show\" was actually refreshing instead of \"The Top 100 Metal Video\" as announced by a woman in a bikini over six hours while showing 40 seconds of the actual video.\n\nIt's weird -- with the proliferation of 300 channels to choose from these days, you'd think there would have been something closer to \"rock 'n' roll geek\" music station showing great concerts and special historical programming.\n\nIt's true. I can barely find decent music programming on 1,000 channels. The closest thing is Palladia, a decent HD channel for music content, but no historical programming I don't think. I've seen some good concerts on the channel, like those Radiohead studio performances they did for their last two albums.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article:\n\nNetwork drift. It happens to every channel that launches with a stated theme sooner or later, all settling in the valley of much that is sitcom re-runs, the same 5 movies over and over, and reality shows.\n\nCuz, ya know, there isn't 30-40 years of music programming sitting on shelves they can draw their programming from or anything...\n\nI have \"The Cool TV\" (http://thecooltv.com) down here, nothing but 24/7 music videos. About as close as you can get to early MTV...Ironically I once worked for them (MTV) and don't even have cable anymore and have no use for the current incarnation of MTV, VH1 or any of their \"siblings\", which is a sad statement on their part...\n\nPalladia is awesome, but there's quite a bit of repetition there. VH-1 Classic is hard to watch in standard definition, which is usually what's available (yeah, I know-99% of the videos are SD). I know they have a metal show, but how cool would it be if there were a prog show?\n\n\"Spam TV\". It's happened to any decent network in the last 25 years of cable.\n\nRemember when AMC was set up in roughly the same way as what TCM is today?\n\n\" \" Bravo showed ultimate highbrow stuff, much like PBS of old, yet it was UNCENSORED?\n\n\" \" channels like MTV, VH1, and CMT showed what they were formed to do? Music?\n\nIt's the way of the world. We are now subjected to EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND reruns on half-a-dozen different channels at any given time.\n\nGive the folks who recently bought the old TNN/Nashville Network brand from Viacom (or whichever conglomerate owned them last). They have brought the old logo back from the dead and are currently getting ready to relaunch the network. I would LOVE to know how the TNN archives held up through the bad years of drift that they were subjected to.\n\nYeah..Palladia has been the go to music channel for me...Vh1 classics has gone the way of the Dino unfortunately...with the exception of \"That Metal Show\" which is tremendous...even if it is in SD.\n\nWhich begs the next question...why no HD of \"Classics?\" I know a lot of the source material would not benefit...but some of it (like the aforementioned TMS) certainly would.\n\nJQ\n\nI think we need a \"Just Awful\" channel where nothing but the worst of the worst is program 24/7 .\n\nWe could get the major networks to give their tossed away stuff,\n\nthen they could say \"See! You think what we program is CRAP, but LOOK!\n\nit could be worse!\" .\n\nCool idea - they could show rejected pilots and shows that were cancelled mid-season\n\nThey tried that with Trio. Let's show nothing but really great shows that got canceled after a few episodes and quirky stuff from the 70's like Battle of the Network stars.\n\nNotice how there is no more Trio channel.\n\nYeah, I remember that. They even had a Joel Stein produced show called Joel Stein's Good Clean P0rn that edited out all of the naughty bits. Of course, they were all 70's movies so they had a plot to them.\n\nOh, I've dreamed of programming a station like this for decades -- even had talks with a few people about it. It could be done, and it wouldn't be all that expensive. I'm not sure how commercially successful it could be, but it'd be a worthy effort. And there are more than enough shows to come up with at least 12 hours of programming a day. Hell, shove in rock & roll movies, and you could fill 16 hours, easy.\n\nVH1 Classic is for crap. On the occasions when I'm up at 2AM or something, I'm appalled at the number of channels that show infomercials for 4 hours. Just hideous and disgusting. I hate, hate, hate lazy programming execs."
