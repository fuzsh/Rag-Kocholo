        "text": "A year and a half ago, the decade-old music-video channel VH-1 gave itself a makeover, dropping the hyphen from its name and adopting the slogan \"music first.\" Formerly a rest home for stand-up comedians and established soft-worck singers (Phil Collinsk, Michael Bolton, Whitney Houston), VH1 began promoting itself as a place to see up-and-coming new artists like Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge and Counting Crows.\n\nBut the image adjustment didn't end there. Recently, VH1 took a giant step back to the 70's and began broadcasting reruns of Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand\" and a nostalgia show called \"8-Track Flashback.\" Now, instead of discussing the newer musicians they've seen on VH1, viewers are talking about kitschy highlights from \"American Brandstand\": John Travolta's disco crooning, a fledging Madonna's claim that she wants to rule the world and a David Byrne (of the Talking Heads) so nervous that its seems as if he might combust.\n\nIn its quest for higher ratings, VH1 has developed a split personality, looking back to oldies while attempting to expose contemporary bands. The new VH1 does not have a set image and course. Instead, it continues to search for the perfect combination of shows that will attract its target audience, adults from 25 to 40. In the past year, it has made dozens of alterations in its programming. Some changes haven't lasted, like tis new magazine and \"Four on the Floor,\" a music-critic round table based on \"The McLaughlin Group.\" Others have, like the prim, well-groomed who hosts, the retro-pop show \"Big 80's\" and the attempt to appeal to viewers' libidos with video shows like \"Sex Appeal.\"\n\nDespite these changes, VH1 remains to some viewers a slower, duller version of MTV. \"What do I think about VH1?\" responded Flea, the 32-year-old bassist in the Red Hot Chili Peppers. \"What's new about it? I can't tell.\"\n\nWhat is new about VH1, its executives trumpet, is the disappearance of standup comedy and the willingness to take chances on newer artists like Son Volt and Hootie and the Blowfish before they become popular.\n\n\"No one will ever agree with what music we should or shouldn't play, but at least it's a music channel now,\" said John Sykes, a record-industry and MTV veteran who became VH1's president two years ago. \"We had become MTV's ugly step-sister, with stand-up comedy and all. Now I think VH1 is a place for people who have outgrown MTV and still want to stay in touch with music.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
