        "text": "American cable television division of Paramount Global\n\nParamount Media Networks[1] is an American mass media division of Paramount Global that oversees the operations of its television channels and online brands. The division was originally founded as MTV Networks in 1984, named after the MTV cable network.[2] It would be known under this name until 2011; when it would be thereafter known as Viacom Media Networks until 2019; and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks until 2022.\n\nThe division's television assets are managed through three units: the MTV Entertainment Group, Showtime Networks, and the Nickelodeon Group. Paramount's international assets are meanwhile overseen by Paramount International Networks.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-launch: Warner Communications joint venture (1977–1984)\n\n[edit]\n\nWarner Cable Communications was formed on December 1, 1977, by Warner Cable, itself a division of Warner Communications, to launch QUBE, an interactive cable television network. Seeing the potential in the creation of new cable networks, Warner Cable divested QUBE's biggest brands, Star Channel, Pinwheel and Sight on Sound, into nationwide outlets. Star Channel began by satellite in January 1979 and was renamed The Movie Channel by the end of the year. The original Channel C-3, by then known as Pinwheel, became Nickelodeon in April 1979. As a result of these actions, Warner Cable Communications would then be rebranded as Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, becoming a joint venture between Warner Cable and American Express.\n\nIn 1980, Warner-Amex formed a joint venture with Cablevision's Rainbow Media division to launch Bravo, a cable network dedicated to arts and films, on December 1, 1980. Full control of the channel, however, was sold to Rainbow Media in 1984; NBC would acquire Bravo in 2003, and the channel is now currently owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal.[3]\n\nOn August 1, 1981, MTV debuted.\n\nIn 1983, concerned by the strategic and financial failure of its pay-TV venture The Movie Channel (started to reap the benefits Time Inc. was having with HBO and Cinemax), WASEC established a joint venture with Viacom, merging TMC with their premium movie network Showtime to form Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.; WASEC, however, had no operational involvement in the joint venture.\n\nLaunch as MTV Networks, Viacom gets full ownership (1984–2011)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 25, 1984, Warner Communications made the decision to divest Nickelodeon, MTV, and VH-1 (launched in 1985 over the channel space of Turner's Cable Music Channel) into a new public corporation called MTV Networks.[2][4] A year later, Warner would acquire the 50% stake from American Express.[5]\n\nOn August 27, 1985, Warner sold 31% of MTV Networks to Viacom, with Warner also selling 19% of its Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. joint to Viacom as well.[6][7]\n\nIn November 1985, Viacom announced that it had plans to buy the remaining 69% of MTV Networks from Warner for $326 million,[8] The acquisition was completed on May 20, 1986.[9]\n\nIn 1988, the company partnered with fellow Viacom subsidiary Viacom Enterprises to handle advertising sales of Superboy, a syndicated television series.[10] The division was later evolved into One World Entertainment in the early 1990s, who partnered to launch a VH1 syndicated series.[11]\n\nIn 2003, MTV Networks assumed full ownership of Comedy Central from AOL Time Warner.\n\nOn December 31, 2005, the remnants of MTV Networks and Showtime Networks were separated following Viacom's split into two entities: CBS Corporation, which retained CBS, UPN, Simon & Schuster and Showtime Networks (Showtime, The Movie Channel, and Flix), and a spun-off company under the Viacom name, which took ownership of Paramount Pictures, BET Networks and MTV Networks (Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and VH1). MTV Networks was renamed Viacom Media Networks in 2011.\n\nExpansion (2011–2019)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the fall of 2012, media analysts began to report that ratings among some of Viacom's leading brands in the U.S. were experiencing declines in viewership.[12][13] MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon were of most concern to investors as the three account for roughly 50% of Viacom's operating profit, estimated David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nIn 2017, Viacom announced a five-point restructuring plan, in which the company would pour most of its resources behind six \"flagship brands\". These were MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. Channel, BET, and Paramount Pictures.[14][15][16][17] In February 2017, cable channels CMT and TV Land were moved from the Kids and Family Group to the Global Entertainment Group under Kevin Kay, joining up with Spike TV.[18] During the same month, it was announced that Spike would be relaunched as Paramount Network in 2018, aligning with the namesake film studio and being positioned as Viacom's main general entertainment outlet.[19][20]\n\nIn October 2018, Kevin Kay was announced to be leaving his position as head of the Entertainment Group. CMT was transferred from the Entertainment Group to the Music Group under president Chris McCarthy, with his exit. Executive Kent Alterman would take charge of Paramount Network and TV Land to go with his current leadership of Comedy Central and Bellator MMA.[21]\n\nIn 2019, after acquiring the free streaming service Pluto TV, Viacom would launch several channels on the service branded after its Media Networks and company–owned IP.[22][23][24][25]\n\nReintroduction and re-merger with CBS (2019–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom announced that it would merge with CBS Corporation, reuniting the two entities under the ViacomCBS name.[26][27] The merger closed on December 4, 2019.[28][29] Announced on November 11, 2019, as part of the re–merger, the Media Networks division was renamed ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, and reorganized.\n\nMTV, VH1, CMT and Logo were reorganized into the \"Entertainment & Youth Group\",[30] with the addition of Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Smithsonian Channel, and TV Land. BET Networks was merged with Showtime Networks under CEO David Nevins, who also temporarily gained oversight of Pop TV (formerly co-owned with Lionsgate);[31] Pop TV was transferred to the Entertainment & Youth Group on January 15, 2020.[32]\n\nOn February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS was renamed as Paramount Global, and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks was renamed Paramount Media Networks.[33] On May 9, 2023, Paramount announced that it would restructure its U.S. domestic network business.[34]\n\nIn 2022, MTV Entertainment Group partnered up with Second Chance Studios to help formerly incarcerated individuals launch media careers.[35]\n\nChannels list\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent channels\n\n[edit]\n\nCategory Name Notes Launch MTV Entertainment Group MTV Branded Networks MTV 1 August 1, 1981 MTV2 August 1, 1996 MTV Classic 19 August 1, 1998 MTV Live 20 January 16, 2006 MTV Tres August 1, 1998 MTVU 22 January 20, 2004 Entertainment & Youth Group CMT 5 March 5, 1983 Comedy Central 2 June 1, 1991 Logo TV 4 June 30, 2005 Paramount Network 3, 5 March 7, 1983 Pop 15 1981 Smithsonian Channel 13 September 26, 2007 TV Land 14 April 29, 1996 Premium Networks Group (Showtime Networks) Showtime Networks Paramount+ with Showtime\n\nShowtime 2\n\nShowcase\n\nSHO×BET\n\nShowtime Extreme\n\nShowtime Family Zone\n\nShowtime Next\n\nShowtime Women\n\n12 May 9, 1976 (Showtime)\n\nOctober 1, 1991 (Showtime 2)\n\nSeptember 1999 (SHO×BET)\n\n1996 (Showcase)\n\nMarch 10, 1998 (Showtime Extreme)\n\nMarch 2001 (Showtime Family Zone, Next and Women) The Movie Channel\n\nThe Movie Channel Xtra\n\nDecember 1, 1979\n\nOctober 1, 1997 Flix 16 August 1, 1992 Kids & Family Entertainment (Nickelodeon Group) Nickelodeon Networks Nickelodeon 7 April 1, 1979 Nick Jr. 8 September 28, 2009 Nick at Nite July 1, 1985 NickMusic 9 May 1, 2002 Nicktoons 10 TeenNick 11 September 28, 2009\n\nFormer channels and blocks\n\n[edit]\n\nBET Networks (moved under CBS Entertainment Group)\n\nBravo (sold to Rainbow Media in 1984;
