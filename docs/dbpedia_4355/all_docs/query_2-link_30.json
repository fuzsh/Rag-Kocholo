        "text": "Paramount Domestic Media Networks (formerly known as ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks MTV Networks and Viacom Media Networks) is an American mass media division of ViacomCBS that oversees the operations of many of its television channels and Internet brands. Its sister's international division is ViacomCBS Networks International.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe company was founded in 1984 after Warner Communications and American Express decided to divest the basic cable assets of Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, renaming it as MTV Networks, Inc. Warner-Amex had created and owned Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1 and The Movie Channel. Viacom acquired 66% of the company in 1985 and then acquired the remaining 34% interest in 1986. MTV Networks was renamed Viacom Media Networks in 2011.\n\nIn 2000, following Viacom's acquisition of CBS Corporation, The Nashville Network and CMT, the two channels owned by CBS by that time, became part of MTV Networks, with The Nashville Network becoming The National Network.\n\nIn 2001, Viacom purchased Washington-based Black Entertainment Television and integrated it into MTV Networks, which later separated BET from MTV to a new group BET Networks.\n\nIn 2003, Comedy Central became part of MTV Networks after Viacom's acquisition of the remaining shares of the latter from Time Warner. The joint dates back to 1991, when HA! and Time Warner's The Comedy Channel merged.\n\nIn January 2006, the remnants of Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment (MTV Networks and Showtime Networks) were separated following Viacom's split into two entities: CBS Corporation, which retained Showtime, and a spin-off company under the Viacom name, which took ownership of Paramount Pictures and MTV Networks.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, media analysts began to report that ratings amongst some of Viacom's leading brands in the U.S were experiencing declines in viewership. MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon were of most concern to investors as the three accounts for roughly 50% of Viacom's operating profit, estimated David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nIn 2017, Viacom announced a five-point restructuring plan, in which the company would pour most of its resources behind six \"flagship brands\". These were MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., BET, and Paramount Pictures. In February 2017, cable channels CMT and TV Land were moved from the Kids and Family Group to the Global Entertainment Group under Kevin Kay, joining up with Spike TV. During the same month, it was announced that Spike would be relaunched as Paramount Network in 2018, aligning with the namesake film studio and being positioned as Viacom's main general entertainment outlet.\n\nIn October 2018, Kevin Kay was announced to be leaving his position as head of the Entertainment Group. CMT was transferred from the Entertainment Group to the Music Group under president Chris McCarthy, with his exit. Executive Kent Alterman would take charge of Paramount Network and TV Land to go with his current leadership of Comedy Central and Bellator MMA.\n\nIn 2019, after acquiring the free streaming service Pluto TV, Viacom would launch several channels on the service branded after its Media Networks and company-owned IP.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom announced that it will re-merge with CBS Corporation, reuniting the two entities under the new name ViacomCBS. The merger is slated to close in early December 2019. Announced on November 11, 2019, as part of the re-merger, the Media Networks division will be renamed ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, and would be reorganized. MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo were reorganized into the \"Entertainment & Youth Group\", with the addition of Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Smithsonian Channel, and TV Land. BET Networks was merged with Showtime Networks under CEO David Nevins, who also temporarily gained oversight of Pop TV; Pop TV was transferred to the Entertainment & Youth Group on January 15, 2020. The re-merger was closed on December 4, 2019, and the Domestic Media Networks division was subsequently renamed on the same date.\n\nChannels list[]\n\nEntertainment & Youth Group[]\n\nCMT4\n\nCMT Music5\n\nComedy Central1\n\nLogo3\n\nMTV\n\nMTV2\n\nMTV Classic\n\nMTV Live\n\nMTV Tres\n\nMTVU\n\nParamount Network2\n\nPop TV14\n\nSmithsonian Channel13\n\nTV Land\n\nVH1\n\nPremium Content Group[]\n\nBET\n\nBET Gospel\n\nBET Her\n\nBET Hip-Hop\n\nBET Jams\n\nBET Soul\n\nBET+ (Streaming service)\n\nShowtime Networks\n\nShowtime12\n\nShowtime 2\n\nShowcase16\n\nShowtime Beyond\n\nShowtime Extreme\n\nShowtime Family Zone\n\nShowtime Next\n\nShowtime Women\n\nThe Movie Channel\n\nThe Movie Channel Xtra\n\nFlix15\n\nKids & Family Group[]\n\nNickelodeon6\n\nNick Jr.7\n\nNoggin\n\nNickMusic8\n\nNicktoons9\n\nTeenNick10\n\nProgramming blocks[]\n\nNick at Nite (on Nickelodeon)\n\nNickRewind (on TeenNick)11\n\nNick on CBS (on CBS 2000-2006)\n\nFormer channels[]\n\nNick Gas (1999–2009)\n\nNickMom (2012–15)\n\nVH1 Uno (2001–08)\n\nNotes[]\n\n1Channel started as Ha!, merged with HBO's The Comedy Channel the following year, became fully owned by Viacom in 2003.\n\n2Originally TNN from 1983 to 2003 (as The Nashville Network until 1997; as The National Network until 2003) and was known as Spike until January 2018.\n\n3Channel was originally known as VH1 MegaHits before being discontinued in July 2005 to facilitate the Logo launch.\n\n4Channel originally owned by CBS, became part of MTV Networks when CBS merged with Viacom.\n\n5Created as VH1 Country prior to Viacom/CBS merger.\n\n6Channel was created by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment originally known as Pinwheel until 1979 when it was rebranded as Nickelodeon.\n\n7Channel was originally known as Noggin before being rebranded as Nick Jr. in 2009.
