        "text": "A new episode of “Basketball Wives” is set to air on VH1 on Monday, July 15 (7/15/2024) at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nEpisode 16 of season 11 is titled “Uninvited Guests, Unintended Consequences.” Jac’Eil invites the ladies for a charitable LGBT event, yet the simmering tension among Brandi, Evelyn and Brooke looms over the occasion. Meanwhile, with Jennifer and Christian’s nuptials on the horizon, Christian drops a startling revelation.\n\nHow can I watch “Basketball Wives” for free?\n\nCord cutters can sign up for Philo (free trial), fuboTV (free trial), Sling (half off the first month), or DirecTV Stream (free trial) to stream the episode live.\n\nWhat is the show about?\n\nAccording to the show’s official synopsis, “The best friends featured in this series have more than mutual companionship in common: They are either the wife, ex-wife or girlfriend of an NBA superstar. Though they drive expensive cars, live in mansions and wear designer clothes and jewelry, life is not always glamorous. Protecting what they have takes a lot of work ... like fending off groupies, dealing with the jealous kind and trying to find stable ground in their often unstable world. Shaunie O’Neal, Shaquille’s ex-wife, is the show’s featured star and one of its executive producers.”\n\nWhat are the differences between the streaming services?\n\nPhilo is a live TV streaming service focused on entertainment channels like MTV, Paramount Network, Discovery and more. It offers 60+ channels for the budget-friendly price of $25 per month. It has unlimited DVR, and can be streamed on all your favorite app-enabled devices. Right now, you can try Philo free for 7 days.\n\nFuboTV is a live TV streaming service focused on live sports, including U.S. and international soccer, the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and more. It also includes its own fubo Sports Networks with exclusive programming. It offers 150 channels starting at $74.99, including 1,000 hours of DVR, and streams on most devices. Right now you can tryfuboTV free for 7 days.\n\nSling is known for its affordability and provides new subscribers with a 50% discount on their initial month of service. There are three channel packages available: Sling Blue and Sling Orange, each priced at $40 per month, and Sling Orange + Blue, which combines the first two packages for $55 per month. To enjoy the Bravo channel, you will need either a Sling Blue or Sling Orange + Blue subscription."
