        "text": "To expand his empire, Nick Cannon gears up for the launch of VH1's newest series, \"Future Superstars.\" This docuseries spotlights the exceptional talents of nine burgeoning artists: Big Boss Vette, DW Flame, Hitman Holla, JD McCrary, Jilly, Klondike Blonde, Pop Money, and Symba.\n\nThese artists stand at the precipice of leaving an indelible mark on the music industry. Each episode intimately explores their distinctive musical prowess and personal journeys, culminating in a finale reflecting on their evolution throughout the season.\n\nIn an engaging conversation with BET.com, Cannon dives into discussions about his latest series, the challenges he faced when conceiving Wild N’ Out, and the profound role music plays in his life.\n\nBET.com: Why was this docuseries important for you to create?\n\nCannon: I created the series because the connection between the audience and artist dissipated and dwindled due to where the music industry currently is. The audience doesn't get the up close and personal journey – you may hear the song but don’t know who the artist is or where they come from. I grew up in the era of 106 & Park, Behind The Music, and shows like that where you were able to have the opportunity to get to know the artist and their story – that’s why I had to create it.\n\nBET.com: You’re no stranger to giving a platform and birthing some of the greatest talent in today’s time — what’s the best advice you’ve given to younger talent who are on the rise?\n\nCannon: Some advice I can give is don’t take advice from anyone (laughs). Many people told me not to create “Wild ‘N Out” and focus on myself – I didn’t take that advice, and I always went with my gut. I tell young artists now that if it’s inside you, let it lead you. Whether you fail or succeed, you do what’s best for you, and its part of your journey. Believe in yourself and what’s true to your spirit.\n\nBET.com: If Nick Cannon from his Nickelodeon days saw the empire you built for yourself, what would he say?\n\nCannon: Realistically, he would say whatever idea you have, let it flourish. When I was on Nickelodeon, I had so many ideas specifically as a writer, and I wanted to create and ultimately produce, so to be able to do that today, keep going.\n\nBET.com: In the finale, you speak with the artists and discuss their progress. Let’s reflect on your progress in this business and your thoughts on where you are now and want to go.\n\nCannon: That’s the joy of this show and a bit of the opportunity to be a curator – we can make predictions, and we have ten amazing young acts who are rising stars, so I’m in awe at how quickly they stepped up to the plate. At the same time, I want to see their future continue, and I want them to accomplish everything they want. To see them go from the tour and being on the cover of Vibe Magazine to having their episode on the series means a lot because people aren’t able to tell their story until the end of their career, where you’re able to tell it at the beginning here.\n\nBET.com: Can you describe your relationship with Music and how it’s heavily impacted you as a creative?\n\nCannon: Music is in my soul, and I’ve been a musician since I was a young kid – I’ve been able to compose, be an artist, and be a producer. Most projects I sit at the helm of are music-driven so it’s in my DNA.\n\nBET.com: You’ve done many amazing things for artists when they started, like letting H.E.R. use your studio daily after school, which is shared in the docuseries. What was it about H.E.R. where you knew she was a future superstar?\n\nCannon: That young lady, as we all know now, is supremely gifted – God’s light shines on her in a big way, and you can see that a 10-year-old, from her level of talent, focus, and spirit in her artistry, has always been at the highest level. All I had to do was pay attention, and I wanted to create an environment to see her flourish.\n\nBET.com: Has anyone ever given you a major helping hand like that when you started your career, and if so, how did that motivate you to keep going?\n\nCannon: So many people looked out for me coming up – I was a young standup comedian trying to put on and do things. I had everyone from [Will Smith], [Kenan Thompson], and [Jamie Foxx] who looked out for me as a teenager, and I’m forever grateful for the opportunities and the lessons I received from icons.\n\nBET.com: What’s one piece of motivation one of these icons gave you that you would like to share with other future superstars?\n\nCannon: Will Smith spoke about being the hardest working person in the room – I’ve watched him be so resilient and focused over the years, allowing his drive to push him forward. Once I saw how hard he worked, I said I would work that hard as well, and it paid off.\n\nBET.com: Who are some other Future Superstars you may not have had for the docuseries, but you believe we should be watching them now as they continue to rise?\n\nCannon: We have season two people I’m excited about – [Kandi], and I have an R&B group cultivated in Atlanta called Psiryn, who are incredible. We’ve been cooking up with them, and they performed as one of the opening acts on the Future Superstars tour – we gave away grants and they were one of the grant recipients."
