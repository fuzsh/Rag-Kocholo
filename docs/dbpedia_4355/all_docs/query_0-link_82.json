        "text": "Redman's rapping made him a hip-hop legend, for sure, but he's also got an entertaining personality that keeps your attention. Maybe that latter quality is what has made the folks at VH1 decide to make the rap legend the host—or rather, the Master of Scare-a-Monies—of their new competition series, Scared Famous.\n\nFor the new show, 10 reality TV stars will move into an eerie estate in Savannah, Ga. where they will be forced to endure a variety of flatout gruesome challenges and epic scares over the course of two weeks. Dealing with this hodgepodge of horror and disgust, contestants will test the limits of their bravery as they work toward the ultimate prize—which is having $100,000 donated to a charity of their choosing.\n\nStars on the show will include: Alaska (Rupaul’s Drag Race), Don Benjamin (America’s Next Top Model), Drita D’Avanzo, (Mob Wives), Erica Mena (Love & Hip Hop: New York)\n\nEva Marcille (America’s Next Top Model), Miss Nikki Baby (Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood), Safaree (Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood), Sky (Black Ink Crew: New York), Tiffany “New York” Pollard (I Love NY) and Yung Joc (Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta).\n\nRedman, who's recently worked with 9th Wonder while putting new music together for his upcoming Muddy Waters 2 project, will presumably be helping to guide the contestants along the way.\n\nScared Famous is executive-produced by David Garfinkle, Jay Renfroe and Jason Carbon, and VH1 will premiere the series on Mon., Oct. 23 at 9 p.m. EST/PST. Be on the lookout for more details on the show."
