        "text": "Fearless storytelling. Peerless production. Content that people are talking about. In an era where culture is currency, Antoinette Media leads the cultural conversation.\n\nUnder the direction of Founder and CEO Lashan Browning — whose hands-on, decades-long producing career has taken her from the award-winning sets of Spike Lee Joints to network boardrooms to the wild frontier of reality TV — Antoinette Media strives to produce eye-opening, conversation-starting film and television content which emphasizes bold points of view and untold stories.\n\nAs networks and streaming services race to keep up with the ever-shifting cultural moment, Antoinette Media has access to a vast network of star talent and a deep bench of diverse creatives committed to generating authentic, first-class entertainment on the leading edge of culture.\n\nFounded by industry veteran Lashan Browning as a joint venture with Paramount Global, Antoinette Media is a full-service production company specializing in authentic, mass-appeal television and film content. It is actively developing a deep slate of projects — ranging from documentaries to scripted features to star-driven digital formats — all exemplifying the company’s commercial and quality-driven approach.\n\nSince its inception in 2020, Antoinette Media has taken the reins of VH1’s massively successful Love & Hip Hop franchise, spearheading a creative rebrand that propelled the network to multi-year highs in an unprecedented reversal of cable ratings trends.\n\nCaught in the Act: Unfaithful has also proved a blockbuster, setting social media on fire while driving VH1 to its biggest quarterly ratings growth in over three years. Starring Tami Roman, the provocative relationship format was renewed for a second season with a MTV air date — signaling the arrival of a bold new television franchise.\n\nAntoinette Media also produces VH1 hits Couples Retreat and Family Reunion, which are both on their third seasons.\n\nCompleted projects at the network include a limited event series documenting the wedding of Basketball Wives star and Executive Producer Shaunie O’Neal and Pastor Keion Henderson and Run It Back!, an outrageous and nostalgic walk down memory lane, highlighting fan-favorite VH1 series and their OG stars."
