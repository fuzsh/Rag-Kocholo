        "text": "In 1997, VH1 introduced “Behind the Music,” a docu-series that turned pop star biography into telenovela. The formula congealed quickly: bright spark, rapid ascendance, limitless potential, tragic flaw, rapid collapse, mild but needed redemption. Whether it was Judas Priest or Dr. Dre or Goo Goo Dolls, the message was clear: Drama doesn’t discriminate.\n\nOver the years, the narratives became rote but remained satisfying. Watching lumps of coal become diamonds makes good television, as does watching diamonds get muddied. The Atlanta hip-hop-soul girl group TLC — T-Boz, Left Eye, Chilli — was featured twice on “Behind the Music,” a testament to its popularity and to the high-voltage intrigue that plagued it from its earliest days.\n\nThe tensions were so real they had to be dramatized. Hence, the colorful and fast-paced telefilm “CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story,” which has its premiere on VH1 on Monday night, and which takes the “Behind the Music” idea to the next logical step — historical re-enactment.\n\nTLC experienced a tremendous amount of trauma, too much to pack into just a couple of hours, especially when each member’s grievances require equal airtime. T-Boz (Drew Sidora) suffered from sickle cell anemia. Left Eye (Lil Mama) struggled under the weight of her father’s disapproval. Chilli (Keke Palmer) struck up an ill-advised romance with Dallas Austin (a practically mute Evan Ross), who produced several of TLC’s early hits, fathered a son with Chilli, and is portrayed here as a simp and a cad. (T-Boz and Chilli are executive producers and consultants on the film, and it shows.) Of the three main actresses, only Lil Mama — a rapper of minor acclaim in her earlier years — conveys any tactile joie de vivre or agony. Ms. Palmer plays Chilli, the group’s bombshell, with rigid grace, and Ms. Sidora paints the group caretaker T-Boz with wide, blunt strokes."
