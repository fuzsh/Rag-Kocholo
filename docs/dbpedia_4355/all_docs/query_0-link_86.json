        "text": "VH1’s new series Hip Hop Squares, from executive producer Ice Cube, is a new take on the old Hollywood Squares. The trivia all has a hip-hop theme, as you’d expect. Sample question: What job did stars Amber Rose, NeNe Leakes, and Chris Pratt all have before they became famous? (The answer is, you guessed it, stripper.)\n\nWith supermodels Tyson Beckford and Don Benjamin squaring off, of course, there had to be a runway style walk-off with Top Model Eva “the Diva” Marcille showing them how it’s done. However, funny woman Tiffany Haddish definitely won on creativity points just before Bobby Brown led Tyson astray with his answer about rapper Childish Gambino. It turns out that Childish Gambino did, in fact, get his name from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator.\n\nIn the end, Tyson Beckford proved to be the sharper of the two models, and he went on to help his fan, Merhawit, double her money in the bonus round.\n\nHip Hop Squares airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on VH1.\n\nWatch: Jimmy Fallon Beats Blake Griffin and Ice Cube in Shootout on The Tonight Show:"
