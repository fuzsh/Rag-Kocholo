        "text": "Games consoles are covered by a voluntary agreement. A voluntary agreement is proposed by industry sectors and works as alternative to EU ecodesign regulations. Through this self-regulation, industries may achieve ecodesign objectives more quickly or at a lesser expense compared to mandatory requirements. The signatories to the agreement control its implementation.\n\nThe voluntary agreement for game consoles aims to reduce the environmental impact over the life cycle while also achieving energy savings through better design. It moreover sets the maximum power limit and auto-power for different mains-powered games consoles on the market of EU countries. It also sets requirements on energy efficiency (excluding the gaming mode), material efficiency and information for consumers.\n\nThe European Commission monitors and assesses the agreement as they need to fulfil some criteria of the Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC).\n\nTogether with industry partners, the Commission has made guidelines for self-regulation measures under the Ecodesign Directive.\n\nThe voluntary agreement is estimated to bring energy savings of 41TWh over the lifecycle of the last generation of games consoles.\n\nFacts & Figures\n\nThis graphic shows the estimated sales, stock, energy consumption (primary, electric or fuel), greenhouse gas emissions, consumer expenses and business revenues for years 2010 and 2030. The estimated values inside the graph bars are those from the EIA ECO-scenario, they include the effects of ecodesign and energy labelling measures.\n\nThe difference with the business as usual (BAU) scenario without these estimated measures is shown next to the graph bar. These figures indicate the estimated savings obtained due to the measures.\n\nProduct: Game Consoles\n\nMeasures: VA 2015-2022, Regulation (EU) 2023/826\n\nEffect of Regulations\n\nSource: estimations from the Ecodesign Impact Accounting Overview Report 2023"
