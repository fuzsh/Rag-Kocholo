        "text": "Although there are some great benefits to online gaming for young people, there are important risk factors that might impact their wellbeing.\n\nGames can offer young people a sense of escape from the reality of the world and the social aspect of some games can help children feel part of a community. However, without the right guidance on what games to play or when to play, children can be exposed to certain risks such as in-game bullying, online grooming or in some extreme cases gaming addiction.\n\nBelow we’ve provided advice on some of the potential risks and things you can do to support young people on these issues to build their resilience and help them make safer choices while gaming.\n\nThere has been a lot in the news about online gaming addiction as one of the risk factors associated with video games. Many parents and carers worry that their children may become addicted to their video game pastime.\n\nThis is not surprising. As with any hobby — football, chess, reading — those who enjoy playing video games for leisure will do so enthusiastically and deeply. This can lead to a desire from children to play for longer and more frequently. Of course, video games are designed to minimise the hurdles to repeat play and maximise enjoyment. This persuasive approach means it’s important for parents to guide children with screen time limits (available on consoles and smartphones) as they develop their own healthy boundaries.\n\nGaming addiction classified as disorder\n\nThese worries have been intensified with news that the World Health Organisation (WHO) adding “gaming” under the section that deals with ‘Disorders due to addictive behaviours’ (category 06) which also deals with alcohol, drugs, gambling. There has been strong disagreement among experts on the inclusion of video gaming in the ICD-11 list.\n\nThis criteria, when endorsed, aims to identify extreme cases of behaviour as addiction. The average child who plays a lot of games is not addicted. Only when their gaming is to the severe detriment of other parts of life — including schoolwork, relationships, personal hygeine, health and other areas. When they continue to pursue video gaming in spite of the negative effects for at least 12 months does it start to fall into this diagnosis.\n\nAlso, it’s important to understand that the levels of dopamine that games create in the brain are only a tenth of those created by chemical substances that can be addictive. Withdrawal symptoms from video gaming could include behaviours such as irritability or aggression as well as other impacts to mood rather than chemical withdrawal associated with substance abuse. Addiction treatment is about helping children form new habits to change this behaviour.\n\nLike many things in life, video games are much more fun when played with other people. Recently that has transitioned from playing with people in the same room to other people online.\n\nAdditionally, the numbers of people that can participate in a single game has greatly risen. The popularity of Fortnite stems in part from its inclusion of 100 strangers in the same fight to the death.\n\nGrowth of social networking in gaming\n\nAlso, the level and types of communication online games offer has evolved significantly over recent years. Whereas games were seen separately to social media, they now greatly overlap with online social sharing sites. In fact, most children’s first interaction with someone they don’t know online is now more likely to be in a video game like Roblox than anywhere else.\n\nUse of personas to hide real identities\n\nIn these games, players do not necessarily know who they are playing with. Online personas in the games may report to be other children but it is hard to validate if this is the case. Because of this, parents and carers need to understand the games their children are playing and how to set them up safely.\n\nHandled sensibly, playing with other children online can enrich a child’s enjoyment and also bring them into contact with others from around the world with different cultures and outlooks.\n\nVideo games are perceived to be a sedentary hobby. However, many new games and technology actively encourage movement and motion. Whether this is getting the family out for walks with Pokemon Go! or jumping around the sitting room with Just Dance, games can actually be a great way to get the family moving.\n\nEnsuring children take breaks and move around\n\nThere have been studies that suggest situations in which someone spends hours sitting in one place can increase the risk of a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). But this can happen with any stationary leisure activity – including watching television, listening to music or reading a book.\n\nWhere children are playing games just on screens, it is good advice to ensure they take breaks every hour. Not only will this keep them moving but it offers a chance for a change of activity.\n\nAnother area for concern is with bright flashing lights that are often a part of video game experiences. The current research shows that video games don’t cause epilepsy but can (like television or pop concerts) trigger a seizure in the extremely small number of people, who already have Photosensitive Epilepsy.\n\nThe Consumer Safety Unit of the governmental department, together with the National Epilepsy Society, has carried out an exhaustive study into this area, which found that epilepsy cannot be caused by playing computer games.\n\nSkin gambling [Betting] – What is it?\n\nIn some instances, these transactions (sometimes called Loot Boxes) offer a chance to win an in-game item of varying value to the player. This can appear similar to gambling as there is luck involved as to which item the player will get. Also, some games like Rocket League have historically presented these items in a “fruit machine” style, spin to win.\n\nFrom a Gambling Commission perspective, this is not actually gambling because there is no monetary value of the items won outside the game. If it was considered gambling it could not be marketed to children.\n\nThis means that some countries, such as Belgium have outlawed the use of “loot boxes” in games because they are seen as gambling aimed at children. There is no consensus more widely available, though. In the UK and US, games are now labeled as having In-App purchases as part of the rating system.\n\nAn important distinction, that many articles conflate, is between online gaming and online video games. Online gaming usually refers to gambling websites where players can partake in traditional gambling games of cards, dice and slot machines. Online video games are the topic of this section, playing on consoles and PC to offer players a challenge of skill in a virtual world.\n\nChildren, who want more in-game currency to purchase loot boxes, are sometimes targeted but unofficial third-party apps offering this in exchange for information. It’s important that parents understand this, educate children, and ensure appropriate passwords are set on credit card details.\n\nRisk of malware on free-to-download games\n\nTo avoid un-intentionally downloading apps or free games that may be bundled with malware or spyware it’s important to:\n\nCheck and research apps and games that children plan to download\n\nStick to legitimate websites when downloading any game\n\nExplain risks of downloading ‘free’ games and what to do if something goes wrong\n\nSet online boundaries and agree which websites and apps are best for them to use\n\nBecause of the interactive nature of video games, where players participate in the on-screen action, parents can worry that this will affect children’s behaviour. This is particularly true where younger players experience more violent games not necessarily designed for their age group.\n\nNo direct link between violent behaviour offline and video games\n\nHowever, contrary to popular belief and many newspaper headlines following violent incidents involving teenagers, a direct link between video game violence and violent behaviour has not been found.\n\nIn their book, Moral Combat, Markey and Ferguson show that although the rise of video game sales to teenagers has risen steeply over the years there has been no correlating rise in violent crime. In fact, they suggest the reverse is true — that games can play a role in keeping teenagers off the streets and out of trouble.\n\nStill, it is important that parents understand how video games affect their children. Parents may not be aware of the actual scenes their children will experience in games before playing them. It’s crucial, therefore, that parents use the PEGI ratings and related information that provides a detailed account of the violence, sex and language contained in a video game."
