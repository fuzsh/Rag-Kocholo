        "text": "Video games have exploded in the last five years. They now make up a , in which game consoles have a massive chunk of the market share, second only to mobile gaming.\n\nAnd 2023 is a good year to be a gamer, whether you’ve been a platformer addict since the Atari days or you prefer to play idle farming games during your commute. That’s especially true if you’re looking for a new console—the chip shortage has abated, investors are buying into the industry, and the technology only continues to improve.\n\nThese days, it’s easy to score a state-of-the-art gaming console for immersive VR, online battles, and story-led indies and RPGs (though you still might run into stock issues with popular consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X). But choosing the right game console—the best of which cost around $500—is all about understanding your favorite ways to game, important specs like graphics and storage, and which platforms you need access to.\n\nLots of gamers (like myself) find themselves with multiple consoles so they can play everything they want. After all, there are still only three major manufacturers, and each tailors to a certain type of player. But here at Popular Mechanics, we’ve been testing and reviewing game consoles for more than 20 years and have many a dedicated gamer who spends their free time and their work time putting those consoles through their paces.\n\nWe used our deep understanding of the industry’s current offerings—both exclusive titles and the consoles themselves—and hours of playing to help you determine the best video game console for your needs.\n\nPrefer to game another way? Check out our recommendations for the best thin gaming laptops, retro gaming consoles, and VR headsets.\n\nThe Best Game Consoles\n\nBest Overall:\n\nBest Budget:\n\nBest for Families:\n\nBest for Online Gaming:\n\nBest Handheld:\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nPlatform\n\nBefore you dive into console specs, understand that each game console manufacturer has its own marketplace and games library, including games that are exclusive to those platforms. Sony’s PlayStation, for instance, is the only console you can currently use to play Horizon: Forbidden West. To play Forza Horizon 5, you need Microsoft’s Xbox, and to check out any recent Legend of Zelda titles, you need a Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile some platform-exclusive games eventually become available on other consoles and marketplaces like\n\nSteam, these ports are sometimes clunky. If there’s a game you’re itching to play, check its compatibility with each platform before you buy. Here’s a list of the most popular exclusive games from the three industry-leading console manufacturers to help you decide.\n\nSony (PlayStation)\n\nMicrosoft (Xbox)\n\nNintendo (Switch)\n\nand\n\nStorage Capacity\n\nEven some of the best consoles on the market, like the PlayStation 5, have middling storage space. If you like to download a lot of new games to try out, make sure you opt for a console with plenty of storage—upwards of 512 gigabytes—or compatibility with external storage.\n\nAll of the gaming consoles we recommend have expandable storage. For the Nintendo Switch and the Switch OLED, you’ll need a microSD card, like optimized for use with the console. For the Xbox Series X and S, opt for a Microsoft-approved NVMe SSD like . The same goes for the Playstation 5, which works best with .\n\nDisplay Compatibility and Graphics Processing\n\nSince you’ll need to plug your console into a TV or monitor to see what you’re playing, take a look at the display specs on both your console and your monitor. For instance, the Nintendo Switch OLED dock supports 4K on an equally compatible display, whereas the regular Switch’s dock only supports Full HD. Meanwhile, the PlayStation 5 supports up to 8K quality.\n\nPay attention to the graphics card’s speed, too, measured in frames per second (fps). Most of the consoles we recommend support up to 60 fps, with a few models rocketing up to 120 if you use them with a compatible display and an HDMI 2.1 cable—which is a boon if you play lots of fast-paced, high-stakes online games.\n\nWe’ve made sure to note the display compatibility for each model we recommend. But as a rule of thumb, you should opt for a console with 4K compatibility and at least 60 fps if you have a large display and like to play quick, graphics-intensive games.\n\nHow We Selected\n\nI’ve been playing games for as long as I can remember—and reviewing games and peripherals for a fraction of that time—so I’m lucky to say I’ve tried out almost every console on this list (save for the Valve Steam Deck, which I yearn for). While I’m partial to the Nintendo Switch because of my love of Zelda, and I’m obsessed with the immersive experience I get with my PlayStation 5, I’ve put in plenty of hours on Xbox consoles, too.\n\nI used my expansive experience with the market’s current offerings, as well as consulted the testing other PopMech editors have done of consoles new and old. We used our understanding of the most important specs like display quality and storage, as well as our knowledge of gamers’ needs and the exclusives available on each platform, to recommend the best console for every type of gamer."
