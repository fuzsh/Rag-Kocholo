        "text": "Imagine being allowed only one app on your iPhone. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? A great game? A flashlight app? Some new Twitter client? My answer would be WhatsApp, hands down. WhatsApp is the king of all messaging apps. It does right where everyone else failed- sending text messages for free while adding some advanced features. Seriously, if more people used WhatsApp, we could put text messages out of commission. I’ve met people that have absolutely no texting in their phone plans, because “WhatsApp is free, why text?” Once you’ve downloaded this app, you will see a drastic decline in your regular texting- because you simply won’t need it. Now I know what you’re probably thinking, if you’ve tried one messaging app, you’ve tried them all. How can WhatsApp be good when all the others weren’t? Well, here are my top three reasons why I think\n\nWhatsApp beats them all:\n\n1) Advanced messaging features:\n\nWhatsApp really packs a punch when it comes to features. In addition to text, you can also send images, video, and audio messages. You also receive delivered and read receipts, as well as a notification when the person you’re chatting with starts typing. But the thing that really got me was the fact that when you first open up the app, it scans your phone book and automatically adds all your contacts with WhatsApp to the favorites section. Say goodbye to pins and usernames, because they’re a thing of the past. I’m still not sure how some services can get away with making you go through the tedious task of adding people’s pins (AHEM BBM!) Additionally, should one of your contacts join after you, he will also be added to the favorites section automatically.\n\n2) Status updates:\n\nWhatsApp does something that most other messaging apps don’t- status updates. Similar to Facebook, you can share with all your friends what you’re up to, where you are, how your day is going…\n\nWhen you first open the app, WhatsApp puts your status as the default “Hey there! I am using WhatsApp “, but you can change it to anything you’d like. And Should you be short on time, WhatsApp has around 10 preloaded statuses to choose from.\n\n3) Cross platform:\n\nUnlike BBM, WhatsApp is available across all the major smartphone platforms, Including iPhone, Blackberry, Android and Symbian. That means a whole lot of communicating. And chances are, a lot of your friends are using one of those phones already, so you’re just a download away from being in touch with all of your friends.\n\nAll in all WhatsApp is seriously an awesome app, and I see no reason why everyone shouldn’t have it. Unless you’re not a fan of saving money, in which case keep on texting. The only downside to WhatsApp is that it costs 99 cents in the app store. A minor setback, but it’s well worth it. So go download the app, and don’t tell me you’re not going to smile at the end of the month when your phone bill comes"
