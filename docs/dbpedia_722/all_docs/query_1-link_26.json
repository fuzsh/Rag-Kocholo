        "text": "TL;DR:\n\nIn the US Channel 3 was preferred as it was in the midst of the continious 2/3/4 assignment. By lifting or lowering the carrier by 6 Mhz either channel 2 or 4 could be offered as alternative.\n\nAnother-Dave already answered the basic issue of avoiding collisions. The reason why it was channel 2/3/4 is due historic channel assignment (in the US, *1).\n\nThe following is all about the classic VHF low-bands (1/2).\n\nChannel assignment during the 70s to 90s for VHF band 1 in the US:\n\nRange VHF Chn. TV Chn. 44..50 MHz 1 (1) [Not used since the 1950s][4] 50..54 MHz gap - 4 MHz gap for [6m band][2] 54..60 MHz A2 2 60..66 MHz A3 3 66..72 MHz A4 4 72..76 MHz gap - 76..82 MHz A5 5 82..88 MHz A6 6\n\nTo start with, the channel assignments have shifted over time (*2). For example the original 6 meter gap was 10 MHz from 56 to 66 MHz, while 84 to 90 MHz was Channel 6. The gap got narrowed and with everything after moved to squeeze in another channel (*3) while widening the band for FM radio at the same time.\n\nImportant for consoles/home computers/VCR and alike in the 70s to 90s is that the FCC usually tried to space regional stations out to reduce interference between them. This didn't always work out in heavy populated areas, but usually either 3 or 2/4 was not assigned to a local (strong) station. Thus a modulator offering a choice to switch between 2/3 or 3/4 could usually solve any channel conflict.\n\nA few devices offered even a three way switch (2/3/4) to allow the use of either channel within the group, but most manufacturers tried to save a penny, thus offering only two choices.\n\nThe whole issue about channel numbers on devices gets further complicates when looking at Europe(*4). US channels were 6 MHz wide, starting at 50 MHz, while European started at 40 MHz, occupying 7 MHz each (*5). So US 3 is located similar to European channel 2, while US 4 is European 3 (*6). So a European device marked as Channel 2 would in the US mean one has to turn to channel 3 :)) In addition in Europe UHF channels were often used instead - but that's different story (*7).\n\nNow, in Japan TV did broadcast in the 90 to 108 MHz range (Channel 1..3), that's were FM radio is located in most other places. So Japanese market consoles / computers use frequencies usually not available to European and US TV sets.\n\nAnd then there is (US) Channel 7 as Alex Hajnal reminded. It lies way above in VHF band III at 174 MHz. While channels 1..6 of band I are of different assignment around the world, 174 MHz is almost everywhere used for TV. In addition it's as well (in most countries) the first channel in this band, independent of spacing/alignment, thus ideal for world wide distribution.\n\nConfusing? Yes, for sure, but in the end, one simply connected the console and turned the knob until some picture came up - if the result was poor, the switch got flipped to see if the other channel came better.\n\n*1 - In Europe and other parts of the world it was similar, but different as the channels were assigned to different frequencies and of different size and arrangement.\n\n*2 - Channel numbers and their logic are weird anyway, as they depend on convention, not physics. One have gone with frequencies, much like with Radio (and, if at all, use logical channels as in parts of Europe).\n\n*3 - That's why they are names An in above table.\n\n*4 - I'll spare the UK 405 line system using 5 MHz channels, as well as the special 1a and 2a channels.\n\n*5 - Well, err , being Europe, there is much unity in doing things different. Beside the English 5 MHz system, there was the old French 14 MHz (awesome picture with 800 lines) as well as the new French 8 MHz system. The later also used in Eastern Europe and China but of course all with different frequencies and various gaps. For example the 6 meter gap is (mostly) observed in most parts of the world, except China and Ireland.\n\n*6 - US 2 is located half way between European 1 and 2.\n\n*7 - Most notably here European channel 36, which happens to be channel 34 in the US, thus despite the different channel spacing, the same modulator hardware could be used for devices designated for the US and Europe and thus essentially the whole world except Australia and China.\n\nThe bandwidth of a typical composite video signal is about 6 MHz.\n\nThe video hardware in in early game consoles (and early home computers) generates its composite video signal in what's called baseband format: the frequency range is 0 Hz to 6 MHz. Only one baseband signal can be sent down a cable or broadcast through the air at any one time.¹\n\nSo that we can have multiple TV channels (among other reasons), the broadcast system takes the baseband signals for different programmes and modulates them on to different higher-frequency carrier signals. This basically \"moves them up\" in the electromagnetic spectrum range: for channel 2 the 0-6 MHz signal is moved up to the 54-60 MHz range, and for channel 3 the 0-6 MHz signal is moved up to the 60-66 MHz range.²\n\nTVs have a tuner that picks a particular range and then demodulates that signal, producing the original 0-6 MHz baseband signal used for that particular channel. Modern TVs and of course computer monitors will often have a direct input for a baseband composite signal so this modulation-demodulation process isn't necessary, but older TVs from the '70s and '80s usually didn't offer this.\n\nSo consoles and computers connected to these older TVs by using sending their baseband signal though an RF modulator, which which is basically a tiny little TV broadcast station doing that same conversion described above. You'd then plug the output of the RF modulation to the antenna input of the TV, it would demodulate the signal back down, and then you can have a picture.\n\nWhen modulating the signal you of course have to choose which one of the many channels you're going to use. Typically North American RF modulators offered you a choice of using channel 3 or 4.\n\nWhy those particular channel numbers, and not others? It had to do with what broadcast frequencies were commonly used in the area, among other considerations. From Wikipedia:\n\nA channel 3/4 output was a common output selection for consumer audiovisual devices sold in North America that were intended to be connected to a TV using a radio frequency (RF) signal. This channel option was provided because it was rare to have broadcast channels 3 and 4 used in the same market, or even just channel 3 itself. The choice allowed the user to select the unused channel in their area so that the connected device would be able to provide video and audio on an RF feed to the television without excessive interference from a broadcast signal.\n\nOther countries had the RF output for video equipment on different groups of frequencies. For example, equipment sold in Europe, South Africa and Hong Kong used UHF channels 30–39 for this purpose. Equipment sold in Japan used channel 1 or 2 (Channel 13–16 is for cable converters). With other channels being used for RF modulation function in other regions, channel 3/4 output is a misnomer for those regions.\n\n¹Actually, this isn't strictly the case, especially for radio, but that gets into some very complex physics and electrical engineering stuff that we don't need to answer this question.\n\n²I'm giving here the channel frequency assignments for North American television of the time; the frequencies will be somewhat different in other parts of the world. You can see more North American channel assignments here, and the chart here compares channel assignemnts for various parts of the world."
