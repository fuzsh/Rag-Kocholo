        "text": "Whether it’s expressed through bits or cutting-edge graphics, video game consoles have revolutionized the way we play and interact with digital worlds. As a staple of modern entertainment, we’ll take a look at the history of video game consoles and how they’ve evolved over the years.\n\n1970s\n\nBringing forth the first video game console in 1972, the Magnavox Odyssey featured simple sports games like tennis and hockey. Players used overlays on their TV screens for visual elements, and the consoles themselves came with paper money and dice to complement the games. Later in 1977, the Atari 26000 brought more to the table with old-time classics like “Space Invaders” and “Pac-Man,” making the system the common household name that it is today.\n\n1980s\n\nWhen the ‘80s rolled around, the gaming console craze increased, with gamers seeing the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega Master System. These consoles introduced classic games like “Super Mario Bros.” and “The Legend of Zelda.” The NES also featured a new and iconic design in its controller, which became a precedent and standard for future generations of game consoles.\n\n1990s\n\nAs the ‘90s arrived, the video-game console industry exploded with the release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (NSES) and Sega Saturn. These consoles introduced new advancements in graphics and sound quality, along with iconic games like “Sonic the Hedgehog” and “Super Mario World.” In 1994, Sony entered the console market with the first PlayStation release, popularizing the use of CDs as game discs.\n\n2000s-present\n\nIn the 2000s, Microsoft entered the fray with the release of the Xbox, introducing the first online gaming network. This innovation opened up new possibilities for players to connect with people around the world. Sony followed suit with their release of the PlayStation 2, becoming the best-selling video game console of all time. In present times, the Xbox and PlayStation evolved to their modern counterparts—the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5—allowing for cutting-edge graphics and processing power. Additionally, the advent rise of mobile gaming led to modern hand-held consoles like the Nintendo Switch."
