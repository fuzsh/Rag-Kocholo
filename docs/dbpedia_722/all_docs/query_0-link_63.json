Some of the other key players operating in a market are Hitachi, Seagate Technologies, NetApp, Promise Technologies, Quantum Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Fujitsu, DataDirect Networks, and Infortrend Technology Inc. Key competitors are specifically focusing on Asia-Pacific and Middle-East &amp; Africa regions, as they show strong tendency to adopt the general-purpose disk arrays in coming years.\",\"materialsDescription\":\"<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What are the characteristics of storage?</span>\\r\\nStorage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Volatility</span></span>\\r\\nNon-volatile memory retains the stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power. It is suitable for long-term storage of information. Volatile memory requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile ones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.\\r\\nDynamic random-access memory is a form of volatile memory that also requires the stored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or refreshed, otherwise it would vanish. Static random-access memory is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it loses its content when the power supply is lost.\\r\\nAn uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief window of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-volatile storage before the batteries are exhausted. Some systems, for example EMC Symmetrix, have integrated batteries that maintain volatile storage for several minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Mutability</span></span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Read/write storage or mutable storage</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Slow write, fast read storage</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include CD-RW and SSD.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Write once storage</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Write Once Read Many (WORM) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. Examples include semiconductor programmable read-only memory and CD-R.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Read only storage</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture. Examples include mask ROM ICs and CD-ROM.</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Accessibility</span></span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Random access</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. Most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Sequential access</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Addressability</span></span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Location-addressable</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical memory address. In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">File addressable</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Information is divided into files of variable length, and a particular file is selected with human-readable directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the operating system of a computer provides the file system abstraction to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Content-addressable</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using software (computer program) or hardware (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's CPU cache.</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Capacity</span></span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Raw capacity</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of bits or bytes (e.g. 10.4 megabytes).</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Memory storage density</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\">Performance</span></span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Latency</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant unit of measurement is typically nanosecond for primary storage, millisecond for secondary storage, and second for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency (especially for non-volatile memory[8]) and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.</div>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Throughput</span>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage.

This architecture is called the client–server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called &quot;services&quot;, such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.\\r\\nClient–server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement. Designating a computer as &quot;server-class hardware&quot; implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but alternatively, large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.\\r\\nStrictly speaking, the term server refers to a computer program or process (running program). Through metonymy, it refers to a device used for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On a network, such a device is called a host. In addition to server, the words serve and service (as noun and as verb) are frequently used, though servicer and servant are not. The word service (noun) may refer to either the abstract form of functionality, e.g. Web service. Alternatively, it may refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a server, e.g. Windows service. Originally used as &quot;servers serve users&quot; (and &quot;users use servers&quot;), in the sense of &quot;obey&quot;, today one often says that &quot;servers serve data&quot;, in the same sense as &quot;give&quot;. For instance, web servers &quot;serve web pages to users&quot; or &quot;service their requests&quot;.\\r\\nThe server is part of the client–server model; in this model, a server serves data for clients. The nature of communication between a client and server is request and response. This is in contrast with peer-to-peer model in which the relationship is on-demand reciprocation. In principle, any computerized process that can be used or called by another process (particularly remotely, particularly to share a resource) is a server, and the calling process or processes is a client. Thus any general purpose computer connected to a network can host servers. For example, if files on a device are shared by some process, that process is a file server. Similarly, web server software can run on any capable computer, and so a laptop or a personal computer can host a web server.\\r\\nWhile request–response is the most common client–server design, there are others, such as the publish–subscribe pattern. In the publish–subscribe pattern, clients register with a pub–sub server, subscribing to specified types of messages; this initial registration may be done by request–response. Thereafter, the pub–sub server forwards matching messages to the clients without any further requests: the server pushes messages to the client, rather than the client pulling messages from the server as in request–response.\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What is a server?</span>\\r\\nA server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term &quot;server&quot; commonly refers to the computer system which receives a request for a web document and sends the requested information to the client.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What are they used for?</span>\\r\\nServers are used to manage network resources. For example, a user may set up a server to control access to a network, send/receive an e-mail, manage print jobs, or host a website. They are also proficient at performing intense calculations. Some servers are committed to a specific task, often referred to as dedicated. However, many servers today are shared servers which can take on the responsibility of e-mail, DNS, FTP, and even multiple websites in the case of a web server.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Why are servers always on?</span>\\r\\nBecause they are commonly used to deliver services that are constantly required, most servers are never turned off. Consequently, when servers fail, they can cause the network users and company many problems. To alleviate these issues, servers are commonly set up to be fault-tolerant.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What are the examples of servers?</span>\\r\\nThe following list contains links to various server types:\\r\\n<ul><li>Application server;</li><li>Blade server;</li><li>Cloud server;</li><li>Database server;</li><li>Dedicated server;</li><li>Domain name service;</li><li>File server;</li><li>Mail server;</li><li>Print server;</li><li>Proxy server;</li><li>Standalone server;</li><li>Web server.</li></ul>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">How do other computers connect to a server?</span>\\r\\nWith a local network, the server connects to a router or switch that all other computers on the network use. Once connected to the network, other computers can access that server and its features. For example, with a web server, a user could connect to the server to view a website, search, and communicate with other users on the network.\\r\\nAn Internet server works the same way as a local network server, but on a much larger scale. The server is assigned an IP address by InterNIC, or by a web host.\\r\\nUsually, users connect to a server using its domain name, which is registered with a domain name registrar. When users connect to the domain name (such as &quot;computerhope.com&quot;), the name is automatically translated to the server's IP address by a DNS resolver.\\r\\nThe domain name makes it easier for users to connect to the server because the name is easier to remember than an IP address. Also, domain names enable the server operator to change the IP address of the server without disrupting the way that users access the server. The domain name can always remain the same, even if the IP address changes.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Where are servers stored?</span>\\r\\nIn a business or corporate environment, a server and other network equipment are often stored in a closet or glasshouse. These areas help isolate sensitive computers and equipment from people who should not have access to them.\\r\\nServers that are remote or not hosted on-site are located in a data center. With these types of servers, the hardware is managed by another company and configured remotely by you or your company.\",\"iconURL\":\"https://old.roi4cio.com/fileadmin/user_upload/icon_Server.png\",\"alias\":\"server\"},\"37\":{\"id\":37,\"title\":\"PC - personal computer\",\"description\":\"A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large costly minicomputer and mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers.\\r\\nInstitutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. While personal computer users may develop their own applications, usually these systems run commercial software, free-of-charge software (&quot;freeware&quot;), which is most often proprietary, or free and open-source software, which is provided in &quot;ready-to-run&quot;, or binary, form. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers. Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts with mobile systems, where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.\\r\\nSince the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows. Alternatives to Microsoft's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry. These include Apple's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems.\\r\\nThe advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries.\\r\\n&quot;PC&quot; is an initialism for &quot;personal computer&quot;. The IBM Personal Computer incorporated the designation in its model name. It is sometimes useful to distinguish personal computers of the &quot;IBM Personal Computer&quot; family from personal computers made by other manufacturers. For example, &quot;PC&quot; is used in contrast with &quot;Mac&quot;, an Apple Macintosh computer. Since none of these Apple products were mainframes or time-sharing systems, they were all &quot;personal computers&quot; and not &quot;PC&quot; (brand) computers.\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What types of stationary personal computers exist?</span>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Desktops</span> - refer to the type of stationary PC. From the name it is clear that these are devices that are installed and work on a table and are not transferred during operation. As a rule, representatives of this group are high-performance powerful devices. They consist of a system unit (a rectangular box), to which a monitor, keyboard and mouse are connected.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Servers</span> - this type of computer has its own specific tasks that it performs remotely or locally in place. The vast majority of servers are quite powerful machines. The appearance of the servers is slightly different from the usual PC - they are mounted in metal racks that look like furniture shelves. The racks themselves are placed in a special room (server room), the necessary temperature regime is necessarily maintained in it.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Nettops</span> - refer to the type of stationary PC. The system unit is compact in size, usually with low power consumption and noise. Due to the small size, nettops have lower performance, but they fit perfectly into the home environment and do not occupy expensive office space.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Microcomputers</span> are computers that fit in a miniature enclosure that looks very similar to a flash drive. The microcomputer itself does not have an output device, therefore, through an HDMI connection, it connects to a monitor or TV. Controls, such as a mouse or keyboard, are connected via the built-in USB ports or Bluetooth. Technical specifications depend on the configuration, as with any other PC.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Monoblocks</span> - refer to the type of stationary PC. The system unit and the monitor are a single unit. Accessories and boards are placed in the compartment, which is mounted on the back of the monitor. It has an aesthetic appearance and does not take up much space.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What are the types of portable personal computers?</span>\\r\\nA laptop computer can also be called portable. They differ from desktop dimensions and weight in a smaller direction and more capacious batteries, which is understandable because you need to carry it with you.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Laptops and netbooks</span> - refer to the type of portable (laptop) PCs, have a battery for offline operation without using a network. The case is made in the form of a clamshell, a screen is installed at the top, and a keyboard at the bottom. Netbooks are smaller than laptops, respectively, have lower performance, although the battery life is longer.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Tablet laptops</span> - refer to the type of portable (laptop) PC. The case consists of a touch screen display - Touchscreen. Their main purpose is surfing the Internet, watching videos, listening to audio, gaming and other applications. The compact dimensions make this group especially popular for travelers. Tablet laptops have a keyboard that either folds up or extends out of a niche under the screen. In tablets, the touchscreen is the input medium. For this group, battery life is important.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Pocket PCs and smartphones</span> - belong to the type of portable (laptop) PC. Distinctive features are a small size and a large reserve of battery life.

Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only difference being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally, and may not support access to a cellular network.\\r\\nThe touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard of larger computers. Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards. Two species of a tablet, the slate and booklet, do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards, distinct from tablets.\\r\\nThe form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the 20th century (Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 science fiction film A Space Odyssey) and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century. In 2010, Apple released the iPad, the first mass-market tablet to achieve widespread popularity. Thereafter tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and soon became a large product category used for personal, educational and workplace applications, with sales stabilizing in the mid-2010s.\\r\\nAndroid was the first of the 2000s-era dominating platforms for tablet computers to reach the market. In 2008, the first plans for Android-based tablets appeared. The first products were released in 2009. Among them was the Archos 5, a pocket-sized model with a 5-inch touchscreen, that was first released with a proprietary operating system and later (in 2009) released with Android 1.4. The Camangi WebStation was released in Q2 2009. The first LTE Android tablet appeared in late 2009 and was made by ICD for Verizon. This unit was called the Ultra, but a version called Vega was released around the same time. Ultra had a 7-inch display while Vega's was 15 inches. Many more products followed in 2010. Several manufacturers waited for Android Honeycomb, specifically adapted for use with tablets, which debuted in February 2011.\\r\\nApple is often credited for defining a new class of consumer device with the iPad, which shaped the commercial market for tablets in the following years, and was the most successful tablet at the time of its release. iPads and competing devices were tested by the US military in 2011 and cleared for secure use in 2013. Its debut in 2010 pushed tablets into the mainstream. Samsung's Galaxy Tab and others followed, continuing the trends towards the features listed above. In March 2012, PC Magazine reported that 31% of U.S. Internet users owned a tablet, used mainly for viewing published content such as video and news. The top-selling line of devices was Apple's iPad with 100 million sold between its release in April 2010 and mid-October 2012, but iPad market share (number of units) dropped to 36% in 2013 with Android tablets climbing to 62%. Android tablet sales volume was 121 million devices, plus 52 million, between 2012 and 2013 respectively. Individual brands of Android operating system devices or compatibles follow iPad with Amazon's Kindle Fire with 7 million, and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook with 5 million.\\r\\nThe BlackBerry PlayBook was announced in September 2010 that ran the BlackBerry Tablet OS. The BlackBerry PlayBook was officially released to US and Canadian consumers on April 19, 2011. Hewlett Packard announced that the TouchPad, running WebOS 3.0 on a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, would be released in June 2011. On August 18, 2011, HP announced the discontinuation of the TouchPad, due to sluggish sales.[66] In 2013, the Mozilla Foundation announced a prototype tablet model with Foxconn which ran on Firefox OS. Firefox OS was discontinued in 2016. The Canonical hinted that Ubuntu would be available on tablets by 2014. In February 2016 there was a commercial release of the BQ Aquaris Ubuntu tablet utilizing the Ubuntu Touch operating system. Canonical terminated support for the project due to lack of market interest on 5 April 2017 and it was then adopted by the UBports as a community project.\\r\\nAs of February 2014, 83% of mobile app developers were targeting tablets, but 93% of developers were targeting smartphones. By 2014 around 23% of B2B companies were said to have deployed tablets for sales-related activities, according to a survey report by Corporate Visions. The iPad held majority use in North America, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and most of the Americas. Android tablets were more popular in most of Asia (China and Russia an exception), Africa and Eastern Europe. In 2015 tablet sales did not increase. Apple remained the largest seller but its market share declined below 25%. Samsung vice president Gary Riding said early in 2016 that tablets were only doing well among those using them for work. Newer models were more expensive and designed for a keyboard and stylus, which reflected the changing uses. As of early 2016, Android reigned over the market with 65%. Apple took the number 2 spot with 26%, and Windows took a distant third with the remaining 9%. In 2018, out of 4.4 billion computing devices, Android accounted for 2 billion, iOS for 1 billion, and the remainder were PCs, in various forms (desktop, notebook, or tablet), running various operating systems (Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, etc.).\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Why are tablet PCs popular?</span>\\r\\nBy definition, a tablet is a highly portable PC whose primary interface is a touch screen that occupies the full length/width of the device but whose speaker and microphone are not positioned for hand-held calling. In popular perception, however, tablets simply combine the best aspects of smartphones and laptop PCs, creating what tablet lovers consider the ultimate mobile computing experience:\\r\\n<ul><li>Compatible with home/office wireless and cellular data networks</li><li>Portable, but with larger, clearer displays than earlier mobile devices</li><li>Powerful, but lighter and easier to carry than traditional laptops</li><li>Longer battery life and greater storage capacity than typical smartphones</li></ul>\\r\\nTablet owners can use touch commands or a virtual keyboard (sometimes a physical one) to run web browsers, email programs, and interactive games just like they do on a desktop PC or laptop. But when they're ready to move, they can keep working (or playing) simply by switching from a home/office wireless network to a cellular data network.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Are there different types of tablet PCs?</span>\\r\\nYes and no, depending on the strictness of the definition.\\r\\nEngineers used the term slate to describe the original, widely popularized tablet PC form factor-- thin and flat, one-sided, without a keyboard. That distinguished tablets from convertibles: full-fledged, keyboard-equipped laptops with hinges that allowed the cover/touch screen to flip 180 degrees -- creating a bulky but usable &quot;tablet.&quot;\\r\\nToday, the terminology has evolved -- adding the phrase &quot;2-in-1&quot; -- to better distinguish the different types of tablets and laptops. Note that within each category are models that run on mobile operating systems and others that run on regular PC operating systems:\\r\\n<ul><li><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Laptop:</span> The original, portable PC that opens partway, like a notebook, to reveal a screen and a keyboard.</li><li><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Tablet:</span> The original, widely popularized slate tablet form factor: thin, flat, and without a keyboard.</li><li><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">2-in-1 Detachable</span> (also called a &quot;hybrid laptop&quot; or &quot;hybrid tablet&quot;): A device whose keyboard and screen can be fully detached from each other.

While similar to the original convertibles, today's 2-in-1 Attached models are much thinner and lighter.</li></ul>\\r\\nIn addition, a new term -- Multimode Tablet -- has emerged to describe models with specialized hinge/handles that allow them to be used traditionally (directly in your hands) or in multiple different ways while propped on a desktop (in tilt mode for easier touch entry (or to project the screen on a nearby wall), in standing mode for touch screen-controlled presentations, or in tent mode for less interactive presentations). Some pc manufacturers even offer a &quot;hanging mode&quot; or include &quot;tablet mode&quot; and &quot;laptop mode&quot; among their list of available modes.\",\"iconURL\":\"https://old.roi4cio.com/fileadmin/user_upload/icon_Tablet_PC.png\",\"alias\":\"tablet-pc\"},\"435\":{\"id\":435,\"title\":\"Rack Server\",\"description\":\"A rack mount server is a great way to maximize your shelf space by packing a lot of servers into a small space. Rackmount servers are typically easier for administrators to manage due to proximity, modularity and better cable management. Lockable rack cabinet doors and steel server front panels provide an additional level of physical security. Additionally, rack unit designed servers are better able to keep the server components cool than traditional tower form factor. Industry standard 19-inch racks will allow you to easily expand your business without taking up more valuable floor space.\\r\\nThere is a lot of thought that needs to go into which size rack server is best bet for your project. Both current requirements and future expansion plans need to be taken into account to ensure your server remains capable in the future.\\r\\nBoth large and small projects can be built on the 1U server platform. &quot;U&quot; stands for unit, “unit”, and this means thickness: server rack 1U = 1.75 inches or 44 mm wide. A reasonable amount of storage can fit within a 1U, processing power has no limits, and some models even allow up to two PCI-Express cards. Modern computer hardware uses much less power than it ever has in the past, which means less heat generation. Some 1U servers to still produce some acoustic noise, but is nowhere near the level of needing earmuffs like the old days. The only reason to go up in size is for additional expansion options.\\r\\n2U models allow for multiple &quot;low-profile&quot; PCI-Express cards while keeping a compact form factor and also providing some additional storage space. If the plan is to use multiple full height cards, then 3U or 4U servers should be the focus. The 4U models are very popular and offer flexible options. The 3U models do have limitations on expansion card compatibility and are really only for situations where rack space needs to be absolutely optimized (14x3U servers or 10x4U servers can fit in a 42u rack).\",\"materialsDescription\":\"<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What is a ‘rack unit’?</span>\\r\\nA rack unit is the designated unit of measurement used when describing or quantifying the vertical space you have available in any equipment rack. One unit is equal to 1.75 inches, or 4.45 centimeters. Any equipment that has the ability to be mounted onto a rack is generally designed in a standard size to fit into many different server rack heights.

Some cabinet manufacturers construct side panel ventilation instead of front and back ventilation, but experts say it’s inadequate for rack mount servers. This can be especially dangerous if more than one cabinet is being set up at once.

SANs are primarily used to enhance accessibility of storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as locally-attached devices. A SAN typically is a dedicated network of storage devices not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other devices, thereby preventing interference of LAN traffic in data transfer.\\r\\nThe cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\\r\\nA SAN does not provide file abstraction, only block-level operations. However, file systems built on top of SANs do provide file-level access, and are known as shared-disk file systems.\\r\\nStorage area networks (SANs) are sometimes referred to as network behind the servers and historically developed out of the centralised data storage model, but with its own data network. A SAN is, at its simplest, a dedicated network for data storage. In addition to storing data, SANs allow for the automatic backup of data, and the monitoring of the storage as well as the backup process. A SAN is a combination of hardware and software. It grew out of data-centric mainframe architectures, where clients in a network can connect to several servers that store different types of data. To scale storage capacities as the volumes of data grew, direct-attached storage (DAS) was developed, where disk arrays or just a bunch of disks (JBODs) were attached to servers. In this architecture storage devices can be added to increase storage capacity. However, the server through which the storage devices are accessed is a single point of failure, and a large part of the LAN network bandwidth is used for accessing, storing and backing up data. To solve the single point of failure issue, a direct-attached shared storage architecture was implemented, where several servers could access the same storage device.\\r\\nDAS was the first network storage system and is still widely implemented where data storage requirements are not very high. Out of it developed the network-attached storage (NAS) architecture, where one or more dedicated file server or storage devices are made available in a LAN. Therefore, the transfer of data, particularly for backup, still takes place over the existing LAN. If more than a terabyte of data was stored at any one time, LAN bandwidth became a bottleneck. Therefore, SANs were developed, where a dedicated storage network was attached to the LAN, and terabytes of data are transferred over a dedicated high speed and bandwidth network. Within the storage network, storage devices are interconnected. Transfer of data between storage devices, such as for backup, happens behind the servers and is meant to be transparent. While in a NAS architecture data is transferred using the TCP and IP protocols over Ethernet, distinct protocols were developed for SANs, such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, Infiniband. Therefore, SANs often have their own network and storage devices, which have to be bought, installed, and configured. This makes SANs inherently more expensive than NAS architectures.\",\"materialsDescription\":\"<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold; \\\">What is storage virtualization?</span>\\r\\nA storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network or subnetwork that interconnects and presents shared pools of storage devices to multiple servers.\\r\\nA SAN moves storage resources off the common user network and reorganizes them into an independent, high-performance network. This enables each server to access shared storage as if it were a drive directly attached to the server. When a host wants to access a storage device on the SAN, it sends out a block-based access request for the storage device.\\r\\nA storage area network is typically assembled using three principle components: cabling, host bus adapters (HBAs), and switches attached to storage arrays and servers. Each switch and storage system on the SAN must be interconnected, and the physical interconnections must support bandwidth levels that can adequately handle peak data activities. IT administrators manage storage area networks centrally.\\r\\nStorage arrays were initially all hard disk drive systems, but are increasingly populated with flash solid-state drives (SSDs).\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold; \\\">What storage area networks are used for?</span>\\r\\nFibre Channel (FC) SANs have the reputation of being expensive, complex and difficult to manage. Ethernet-based iSCSI has reduced these challenges by encapsulating SCSI commands into IP packets that don't require an FC connection.\\r\\nThe emergence of iSCSI means that instead of learning, building and managing two networks -- an Ethernet local area network (LAN) for user communication and an FC SAN for storage -- an organization can use its existing knowledge and infrastructure for both LANs and SANs. This is an especially useful approach in small and midsize businesses that may not have the funds or expertise to support a Fibre Channel SAN.\\r\\nOrganizations use SANs for distributed applications that need fast local network performance. SANs improve the availability of applications through multiple data paths. They can also improve application performance because they enable IT administrators to offload storage functions and segregate networks.\\r\\nAdditionally, SANs help increase the effectiveness and use of storage because they enable administrators to consolidate resources and deliver tiered storage. SANs also improve data protection and security. Finally, SANs can span multiple sites, which helps companies with their business continuity strategies.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">Types of network protocols</span>\\r\\nMost storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and disk drive devices.[citation needed] A mapping layer to other protocols is used to form a network:\\r\\n<ul><li>ATA over Ethernet (AoE), mapping of ATA over Ethernet</li><li>Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the most prominent one, is a mapping of SCSI over Fibre Channel</li><li>Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)</li><li>ESCON over Fibre Channel (FICON), used by mainframe computers</li><li>HyperSCSI, mapping of SCSI over Ethernet</li><li>iFCP or SANoIP mapping of FCP over IP</li><li>iSCSI, mapping of SCSI over TCP/IP</li><li>iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER), mapping of iSCSI over InfiniBand</li><li>Network block device, mapping device node requests on UNIX-like systems over stream sockets like TCP/IP</li><li>SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP), another SCSI implementation for RDMA transports</li></ul>\\r\\nStorage networks may also be built using SAS and SATA technologies.

This allows you to simplify the process of deploying such an infrastructure - something that has been waiting for and what will be rejoiced by many companies that need to virtualize their desktop systems.\\r\\nDespite its value and innovation, there are several questions to these technologies regarding their intended use and differences. Let's try to figure out what functionality offers converged and hyper-convergent infrastructures and how they differ.\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What is converged infrastructure?</span>\\r\\nConvergent infrastructure combines computing devices, storage, network devices and server virtualization tools in one chassis so that they can be managed from one place. Management capabilities may include the management of virtual desktop infrastructure, depending on the selected configuration and manufacturer.\\r\\nThe hardware included in the bundled converged infrastructure is pre-configured to support any targets: virtual desktop infrastructures, databases, special applications, and so on. But in fact, you do not have enough freedom to change the selected configuration.\\r\\nRegardless of the method chosen for extending the virtual desktop infrastructure environment, you should understand that subsequent vertical scaling will be costly and time-consuming. Adding individual components is becoming complex and depriving you of the many benefits of a converged infrastructure. Adding workstations and expanding storage capacity in a corporate infrastructure can be just as expensive, which suggests the need for proper planning for any virtual desktop infrastructure deployment.\\r\\nOn the other hand, all components of a converged infrastructure can work for a long time. For example, a complete server of such infrastructure works well even without the rest of the infrastructure components.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What is a hyper-convergent infrastructure?</span>\\r\\nThe hyper-converged infrastructure was built on the basis of converged infrastructure and the concept of a software-defined data center. It combines all the components of the usual data center in one system. All four key components of the converged infrastructure are in place, but sometimes it also includes additional components, such as backup software, snapshot capabilities, data deduplication functionality, intermediate compression, global network optimization (WAN), and much more. Convergent infrastructure relies primarily on hardware, and software-defined data center often adapts to any hardware. In the hyper-convergent infrastructure, these two possibilities are combined.\\r\\nHyper-converged infrastructure is supported by one supplier. It can be managed as a single system with a single set of tools. To expand the infrastructure, you just need to install blocks of necessary devices and resources (for example, storage) into the main system block. And this is done literally on the fly.\\r\\nSince the hyper-convergent infrastructure is software-defined (that is, the operation of the infrastructure is logically separated from the physical equipment), the mutual integration of components is denser than in a conventional converged infrastructure, and the components themselves must be nearby to work correctly. This makes it possible to use a hyper-convergent infrastructure to support even more workloads than in the case of conventional converged infrastructure. This is explained by the fact that it has the possibility of changing the principle of definition and adjustment at the program level. In addition, you can make it work with specialized applications and workloads, which pre-configured converged infrastructures do not allow.\\r\\nHyper-converged infrastructure is especially valuable for working with a virtual desktop infrastructure because it allows you to scale up quickly without additional costs. Often, in the case of the classic virtual desktops infrastructure, things are completely different - companies need to buy more resources before scaling or wait for virtual desktops to use the allocated space and network resources, and then, in fact, add new infrastructure.\\r\\nBoth scenarios require significant time and money. But, in the case of hyperconvergent infrastructure, if you need to expand the storage, you can simply install the required devices in the existing stack. Scaling can be done quickly — for the time required to deliver the equipment. In this case, you do not have to go through the full procedure of re-evaluation and reconfiguration of the corporate infrastructure.\\r\\nIn addition, when moving from physical PCs to virtual workstations, you will need devices to perform all the computational tasks that laptops and PCs typically perform. Hyper-converged infrastructure will greatly help with this, as it often comes bundled with a large amount of flash memory, which has a positive effect on the performance of virtual desktops. This increases the speed of I / O operations, smoothes work under high loads, and allows you to perform scanning for viruses and other types of monitoring in the background (without distracting users).\\r\\nThe flexibility of the hyper-converged infrastructure makes it more scalable and cost-effective compared to the convergent infrastructure since it has the ability to add computing and storage devices as needed. The cost of the initial investment for both infrastructures is high, but in the long term, the value of the investment should pay off.\",\"iconURL\":\"https://old.roi4cio.com/fileadmin/user_upload/icon_Converged_and_Hyper_Converged_System.png\",\"alias\":\"converged-and-hyper-converged-system\"},\"515\":{\"id\":515,\"title\":\"Tower Server\",\"description\":\"A tower server is a computer that is built in an upright cabinet that stands alone and that is designed to function as a server.

Blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components to be considered a computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, a blade server needs a blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management. Together, blades and the blade enclosure form a blade system. Different blade providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the blade itself, and in the blade system as a whole.\\r\\nIn a standard server-rack configuration, one rack unit or 1U—19 inches (480 mm) wide and 1.75 inches (44 mm) tall—defines the minimum possible size of any equipment. The principal benefit and justification of blade computing relates to lifting this restriction so as to reduce size requirements. The most common computer rack form-factor is 42U high, which limits the number of discrete computer devices directly mountable in a rack to 42 components. Blades do not have this limitation. As of&nbsp; 2014, densities of up to 180 servers per blade system (or 1440 servers per rack) are achievable with blade systems.\\r\\nEnclosure (or chassis) performs many of the non-core computing services found in most computers. Non-blade systems typically use bulky, hot and space-inefficient components, and may duplicate these across many computers that may or may not perform at capacity. By locating these services in one place and sharing them among the blade computers, the overall utilization becomes higher. The specifics of which services are provided varies by vendor.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic; \\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold; \\\">Power.</span></span> Computers operate over a range of DC voltages, but utilities deliver power as AC, and at higher voltages than required within computers. Converting this current requires one or more power supply units (or PSUs). To ensure that the failure of one power source does not affect the operation of the computer, even entry-level servers may have redundant power supplies, again adding to the bulk and heat output of the design.\\r\\nThe blade enclosure's power supply provides a single power source for all blades within the enclosure. This single power source may come as a power supply in the enclosure or as a dedicated separate PSU supplying DC to multiple enclosures. This setup reduces the number of PSUs required to provide a resilient power supply.\\r\\nThe popularity of blade servers, and their own appetite for power, has led to an increase in the number of rack-mountable uninterruptible power supply (or UPS) units, including units targeted specifically towards blade servers (such as the BladeUPS).\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic; \\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold; \\\">Cooling.</span></span> During operation, electrical and mechanical components produce heat, which a system must dissipate to ensure the proper functioning of its components. Most blade enclosures, like most computing systems, remove heat by using fans.\\r\\nA frequently underestimated problem when designing high-performance computer systems involves the conflict between the amount of heat a system generates and the ability of its fans to remove the heat. The blade's shared power and cooling means that it does not generate as much heat as traditional servers. Newer blade-enclosures feature variable-speed fans and control logic, or even liquid cooling systems that adjust to meet the system's cooling requirements.\\r\\nAt the same time, the increased density of blade-server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for cooling with racks populated at over 50% full. This is especially true with early-generation blades. In absolute terms, a fully populated rack of blade servers is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard 1U servers. This is because one can fit up to 128 blade servers in the same rack that will only hold 42 1U rack mount servers.\\r\\n<span style=\\\"font-style: italic; \\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: bold; \\\">Networking.</span></span> Blade servers generally include integrated or optional network interface controllers for Ethernet or host adapters for Fibre Channel storage systems or converged network adapter to combine storage and data via one Fibre Channel over Ethernet interface. In many blades at least one interface is embedded on the motherboard and extra interfaces can be added using mezzanine cards.\\r\\nA blade enclosure can provide individual external ports to which each network interface on a blade will connect. Alternatively, a blade enclosure can aggregate network interfaces into interconnect devices (such as switches) built into the blade enclosure or in networking blades.\\r\\nBlade servers function well for specific purposes such as web hosting, virtualization, and cluster computing. Individual blades are typically hot-swappable. As users deal with larger and more diverse workloads, they add more processing power, memory and I/O bandwidth to blade servers. Although blade server technology in theory allows for open, cross-vendor system, most users buy modules, enclosures, racks and management tools from the same vendor.\\r\\nEventual standardization of the technology might result in more choices for consumers; as of 2009 increasing numbers of third-party software vendors have started to enter this growing field.\\r\\nBlade servers do not, however, provide the answer to every computing problem. One can view them as a form of productized server-farm that borrows from mainframe packaging, cooling, and power-supply technology. Very large computing tasks may still require server farms of blade servers, and because of blade servers' high power density, can suffer even more acutely from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning problems that affect large conventional server farms.\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span style=\\\"font-weight: bold;\\\">What is blade server?</span>\\r\\nA blade server is a server chassis housing multiple thin, modular electronic circuit boards, known as server blades. Each blade is a server in its own right, often dedicated to a single application. The blades are literally servers on a card, containing processors, memory, integrated network controllers, an optional Fiber Channel host bus adaptor (HBA) and other input/output (IO) ports.\\r\\nBlade servers allow more processing power in less rack space, simplifying cabling and reducing power consumption. According to a SearchWinSystems.com article on server technology, enterprises moving to blade servers can experience as much as an 85% reduction in cabling for blade installations over conventional 1U or tower servers. With so much less cabling, IT administrators can spend less time managing the infrastructure and more time ensuring high availability.\\r\\nEach blade typically comes with one or two local ATA or SCSI drives. For additional storage, blade servers can connect to a storage pool facilitated by a network-attached storage (NAS), Fiber Channel, or iSCSI storage-area network (SAN). The advantage of blade servers comes not only from the consolidation benefits of housing several servers in a single chassis, but also from the consolidation of associated resources (like storage and networking equipment) into a smaller architecture that can be managed through a single interface.\\r\\nA blade server is sometimes referred to as a high-density server and is typically used in a clustering of servers that are dedicated to a single task, such as:\\r\\n<ul><li>File sharing</li><li>Web page serving and caching</li><li>SSL encrypting of Web communication</li><li>The transcoding of Web page content for smaller displays</li><li>Streaming audio and video content</li></ul>\\r\\nLike most clustering applications, blade servers can also be managed to include load balancing and failover capabilities.\",\"iconURL\":\"https://old.roi4cio.com/fileadmin/user_upload/icon_Blade_System.png\",\"alias\":\"blade-system\"},\"519\":{\"id\":519,\"title\":\"Density Optimized Server\",\"description\":\" The high-density server system is a modern concept of building an economical and scalable computing equipment subsystem within the data processing center (hereinafter referred to as the data center).\\r\\nThe high-density server system includes server equipment, modules of the organization of network interaction, technologies of resource virtualization and has constructive opportunities to install all the components of a modern data center within a single structural unit (chassis).\\r\\nThe virtualization tools used and the adaptive management system combines the high-density server system resources for collective use in processing various combinations of workloads.\\r\\nThe high-density server system in the information system infrastructure allows achieving significant cost savings by compacting components and reducing the number of cable connections, jointly managing systems, using virtualization tools, reducing power and cooling costs, simplifying deployment and the possibility of rapid interchangeability of server equipment.\\r\\nThe high-density server system can be used as a subsystem of corporate data centers, as well as act as a computing center for an information system of a small company, thanks to its design features and applied technologies.\",\"materialsDescription\":\" <span styl"
