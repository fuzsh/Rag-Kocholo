        "text": "The Nintendo Switch OLED is the newest console from Nintendo, and the updated OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen is able to provide brighter and crisper graphics compared to its predecessors. On either side of the screen rests the controller called the Joy-Con, and the touchscreen allows you to navigate menus with a tap. You can play the console in handheld mode for on-the-go play, or you can connect it to a television for multiplayer or a more immersive experience.\n\n• Controller: The controller, also known as the Joy-Con, attaches to either side of the screen so you can play in handheld mode. There is also a built-in stand on the screen, so if you can't connect to a TV but don't want to play in handheld mode, the controllers can be removed so you can still kick back and relax while you play — each half of the controller goes into one hand. If you are used to a traditional controller, the console comes with an attachment that allows you to create a single controller using the two disconnected pieces. One of the best features of the Switch is that the Joy-Con can actually be split between two people, creating an easy two-player game. Buy one more Joy-Con, and all of a sudden up to four people can play.\n\n• Gameplay: In order to play games, you have the option of buying physical cartridges or downloading games off the Nintendo Online E-Shop. The cartridges are tiny and fit in a slot at the top of the Switch OLED. Games can be played instantly if you have a cartridge — no extra downloading necessary. The console comes with 64 Gigabytes of built-in storage for downloading games. It also features an SD card slot, which allows you to upload your games to a memory card to expand the storage by at least double.\n\n• Lab Lowdown: Our testers loved how easy it was to play multiplayer games with other people in the same room. And because of its size, you can play these multiplayer games anywhere you want. Depending on the game, you can have up to eight people playing on one console. Extra controllers connect easily to the console. One tester played it everywhere she could, saying, \"I love the portability. It fits in my backpack, and I am able to take it with me to my friends' houses and on trips!\"\n\n• Exclusive Games: Super Mario Odyssey, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros: Ultimate, Animal Crossing, Ring Fit, Nintendo Switch Sports\n\nFor those who love to game but don't need an all-powerful console, the Xbox Series S is a slight downgrade from the Xbox Series X in terms of tech, but it's $200 cheaper and it's still capable of doing what the Series X can in terms of game content and general functionality. (You can read more about the Series X below.) The Series S is much smaller, so if you like to bring your console to your friend's house, it's easy to do so.\n\n• Controllers: Xbox controllers are battery-operated and connect wirelessly to the console. Depending on the game, you can typically have up to four controllers connected to one Xbox at a time. You can even use the controller to save and share gameplay moments that you want to remember. It's also possible to have separate accounts so everyone in the family can play their own way. You set up passwords using the controller (where each button on the controller represents a certain number) so no one can mess with anyone else's saved game.\n\n• Gameplay: There's no disc drive in this one, so in order to play games on this console, you can either download them from the Xbox Marketplace or you can subscribe to Xbox Game Pass. There are two tiers — either $10 or $15 a month — and even at the cheaper tier, you gain access to hundreds of videogames across the console. Some games don't even need to be downloaded. You can play over Xbox's new patented Xbox Cloud Gaming, where you stream the game over the cloud. For the ones you do have to download, you have 512 GB of built-in storage on your console. If you need more, you can attach an external hard drive, allowing you to increase its storage space by more than double.\n\n• Lab Lowdown: Our experts were impressed by the streaming feature where they didn't have to download content. They were shocked at how well the games performed over the cloud, with little to no slow-down or frame-rate loss. There was still a slight improvement in graphics after downloading the game versus playing over the cloud, but overall, the feature works well. One of our testers said this console was \"the quietest gaming console I have ever owned\" despite the built-in fans that help keep it cool.\n\n• Exclusive Games: Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Gears of War 5\n\nThe PlayStation 5 is the most powerful Sony console to date, with an 825 GB SSD (Solid-State Drive). This means it has a storage capacity of 825 Gigabytes, and the Solid-State Drive allows you to start up and load games faster than any PlayStation console before it. There are two versions of the PS5: and one is purely digital. If you still enjoy owning hard copies of your games, opt for the version with the disc drive, though it is more expensive than the digital-only console.\n\n• Controller: The controller is simple to understand, with haptic feedback (vibrations caused by certain in-game actions) and adaptive triggers unique to the PS5 controller. This means that for certain games, the controller's rear triggers can adjust the tension to make it easier or harder to press depending on what's going on in the game. For example, if you're playing a shooting game, the controller can simulate what a gun trigger would actually feel like, increasing the immersion factor. It also has sharing capabilities, so if a moment happens during a game that you want to share with your friends, you click a button and it saves your most recent gameplay so it's available to edit and send to anyone you want.\n\n• Gameplay: The PlayStation 5 has both online and offline capabilities. In order to play online, there are varied subscription tiers you can purchase. The first and cheapest tier is $60 a year and allows access to multiple free games a month, the ability to play online multiplayer, cloud storage, exclusive PS5 games and hardware discounts. If you wish to upgrade, for a maximum of $120 a year, you can stream hundreds of older PlayStation games for free, ranging from the first PlayStation all the way to PlayStation 4. Important to note: If you choose to only play F2P (free to play) games, you don't need to pay for online access.\n\n• Lab Lowdown: While it can be intimidating to first run through, the start-up process and navigation aren't too complicated once you get used to it. One tester said, \"Navigating the menus took a little bit to learn, but once you do, it all makes sense.\" One tester was very satisfied with the PS5 overall, saying, \"I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t recommend this to all my friends and family.\"\n\n• Exclusive Games: Horizon Forbidden West, Ghostwire: Tokyo, Gran Turismo 7, Stray, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart\n\nThe Xbox Series X is the most advanced Xbox with a cleaner look and the highest video resolution of any Xbox console to date. It has a disc drive, but that doesn't mean you can't download games to its 1 TB Solid State Drive (SSD). The SSD makes the console faster, quieter and overall, more powerful than its predecessors. It's a big console, standing about a foot tall in the vertical position, but it can be oriented horizontally as well.\n\n• Controller: The controller is actually smaller than the consoles before it. This allows for more comfortability in children's hands, while still being comfortable enough to be used by an adult. Each controller has a headphone jack, so feel free to plug in some headphones so you can talk to your friends during live gameplay and listen to the game through them. You can also utilize certain Bluetooth headsets if you don't want to connect everything through a cord.\n\n• Gameplay: If you are new to gaming, look into getting the Xbox Game Pass. You pay a maximum of $15 a month, and you get access to hundreds of games from older generational games to brand new releases and even indie games. One of our consumer testers said, \"I’ve had a great experience. Xbox game pass makes this console very user-friendly for new gamers.\" While this console is built to play games, it also has TV streaming functionality. No need to purchase a smart TV when you can just get a console with the ability to both game and stream your favorite apps all in one.\n\n• Lab Lowdown: While we didn't get the chance to test this device in our Lab, we worked with individuals who have played almost every single console and asked for their thoughts on the Xbox Series X. They loved how easy it was to navigate through the Xbox, as well as how quick everything started and loaded due to the Solid-State Drive.\n\n• Exclusive Games: Sable, Forza Horizon 5, The Artful Escape, Halo Infinite, Microsoft Flight Simulator\n\nThe Original Nintendo Switch is what brought Nintendo back to the forefront of gaming consoles. Simple, small, portable yet powerful, it's a console anyone can play, whether you're new to video games or a veteran gamer. While the screen is not as advanced as the OLED model above, this is a cheaper variation that can still handle all of the Switch games perfectly. It's capable of being a handheld device and connected to the TV.\n\n• Controllers: Just like the Switch OLED, the controllers or Joy-Con can be attached to the screen for handheld mode or detached. When detached, you can connect the screen to the TV or use the built-in stand that is capable of holding up the screen by itself. If it's uncomfortable holding a controller individually in each hand, feel free to use the controller attachment that comes with the console, allowing you to combine the separate pieces of the Joy-Con into one device.\n\n• Gameplay: In order to play games on this console, you can either purchase a game cartridge or download a game from the Nintendo online shop. Game cartridges install instantly, so you can play immediately. When you download a game, you have about 32 Gigabytes (GB) of storage available to use, and you can purchase an SD card that slots right into your Switch for even more storage space. While playing, you can of course use the controllers, but some games allow you to use the screen itself to commit certain actions. Surprise — it's a touchscreen!\n\n• Lab Lowdown: This console has also implemented several different sensors to allow you to play games in even more unique ways. With a built-in gyroscope (a sensor that is able to determine the orientation of your device), you can aim your bow and arrow in one game by tilting the screen in handheld mode. If you play a sports game like tennis, you can swing the Joy-Con like you're swinging a tennis racket. Nintendo re-imagined their old workout videogames to be more interactive than ever before. There are attachments that allow you to attach the Joy-Con to your body, allowing you to jump and run to cause your character to jump and run in the game. Playing games like this with friends or family is what makes the Switch so much fun! One tester said, \"The Switch is perfect for anybody in the family with a versatile handheld mode and plenty of games to offer.\"\n\n• Exclusive Games: Super Mario Odyssey, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros: Ultimate, Animal Crossing, Ring Fit, Nintendo Switch Sports\n\nWhen it comes to video game consoles, it's easy to be distracted and confused by all the specs, especially if you are new to gaming and aren't sure what they mean. But really, the best way to test video game consoles is to simply play with them! For each device, we compared how easy it was to get to the main screen and set up an account, straight from the box. We tested a variety of games, pushing the consoles to their limits to make sure there was no frame-rate drop and that they don't overheat over a period of extended use. We had consumer testers compare graphic quality, and we asked children to play to see what consoles they enjoyed the most. While we included the specs in our review for the more \"techy\" individuals, you can find an excellent console for your needs without looking too deep into them.\n\nWhile it's near impossible to agree on the best video game console of all time, they are all getting faster, lighter and more robust in their offerings. There is no bad choice on this list, it's really a matter of preference and features that matter the most to you. Here, a list of a few things to consider if you're on the hunt for a new video game console:\n\n✔️ Storage: Out of all the specs, when it comes to gaming, storage is one of the most important aspects. If you don't have the space to download a game, it doesn't matter how powerful your console is; you can't play what you don't have. If you don't mind spending a few extra bucks, for any console I recommend buying an external hard drive, to always make sure you have space available. Also, you should see if the console has an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or an SSD (Solid State Drive). SSD's will load games and start up consoles much faster than HDD's, and overall will provide a higher grade of performance than HDD's.\n\n✔️ Portability: What do you want to do with your console? Do you want to set it up and never move it? Are you interested in bringing it on trips? Do you want to take it to a friend's house? Maybe you just live in a small apartment and don't want to take up too much space. Don't buy a large console expecting to take it on long car rides or while you're on vacation.\n\n✔️ Games: There are console exclusive games across every single console. While a lot of games do cover the gamut, there are some that will only ever release for one console. Make sure you understand what type of games you want to play. We usually recommend if you already have a system, you consider staying within that ecosystem and upgrading when the time comes, because the games will likely carry over and be compatible and you may have already established a community of gamers that are distinct to that platform.\n\n✔️ Frame-rate: A higher frame-rate means a smoother gameplay experience. The more frames-per-second you can have, the better the game will look and feel because the screen is being updated more frequently. This also allows you to react faster in theory to outperform any competition! Ideally you'll want up to 120fps or higher, which is what most consoles can reach nowadays. At minimum, you should make sure your console can at least reach 60fps.\n\n✔️ Parental Controls: If this is a gift for your kid, the majority of consoles have built-in parental controls which allow you to control the content and duration of gameplay. The level of security and control vary, so it's important to review in advance to understand what you will be capable of overseeing with your child's play."
