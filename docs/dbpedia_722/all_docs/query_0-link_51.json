        "text": "In this article I will show that the problem of embodiment goes back to the question of the mind-body split, as this has been established and discussed by the philosophical tradition. With the digital turn and the advent of ubiquitous computing the problem of embodiment has taken new (and far more complicated) forms that have led scholars to introduce the notion of a \"new digital Cartesianism.\" Subjectivation processes within digital culture have mostly been explained by resorting to what I will call the \"E-D-R scheme,\" (embodiment-disembodiment-reembodiment scheme) which assumes that a real detachment between the body and the mind really occurs in digital processes. Since-as I will show-this is not actually the case, I will suggest replacing this epistemological scheme with a new one, which I will call the \"double-embodiment scheme,\" in order to acquire a more fitting epistemological account of the underlying digital ontology. Finally, I will discuss the distinction between bodily extension and the incorporation of non-bodily objects introduced by Helena De Preester in order to show that, in the digital realm, this distinction is much more blurred and complex than she acknowledges: digital interaction requires both bodily extension and the incorporation of objects as complementary processes.\n\nIn this article, the author deals with the status of the self and personal identity in the digital milieu. In the first section, he presents his general approach to digital media and technologies, which he has called \"digital hermeneutics.\" He distinguishes between three perspectives in digital hermeneutics, namely the deconstructive, epistemological, and ontological approaches. In the second part, he focuses on digital hermeneutics as hermeneutics of the self. He compares Paul Ricoeur's narrative identity to Pierre Bourdieu's habitus. His first thesis is that the habitus can be seen as a concept of subjectivation that neglects an important part of the subject. Narrative identity offers, in this sense, a remedy to such negligence. His second thesis is that today's digital media and technologies are closer to the Bourdieusian habitus than to the Ricoeurian narrative identity. In other words, digital machines and technologies are \"habitus machines\" both in their structure and in their effects. In the conclusion, the author accounts for three potential responses to the habituation of our selves online. He also introduces the concepts of \"digital agency\" and \"digital citizenship.\"\n\nPsychological essentialism-adherence to view that individuals possess specifically mental processes or mechanisms-has long served as a pivotal feature of the Western cultural tradition. Already in Aristotelian philosophy there was an elaborate formulation of the workings of mental life. Platonic theory of knowledge, and its central concern with the reality of pure ideas, was also forged from a preliminary belief in the preeminence of the psychological interior. Such offerings from the Greek cultural world, when coupled with the Judaeo-Christian conception of the soul, lent a solid palpability to the presumption of an inner world-identifiable, ever present, transparent and central to the understanding of human action. As variously elaborated over the centuries, such early speculations have undergone significant change. As medievalists such as Augustine and Aquinas and expanded on the concepts of soul, sensation, and the emotions; as rationalist philosophers such as Descartes and Kant extolled the capacities of pure reason and a priori ideas; as empiricist philosophers such as Locke and Hobbes emphasized the significance of experience in the generation of ideas; and romanticist poets, novelists, and philosophers explored the mysterious terrain of the passions, creative urges, evil inclinations, genius and madness, so have we become a tradition in which the presumption of an inner life-as real and possibly more important than the external, material world-has become firmly fixed. The discourse of the individual interior has also provided the major rationale for many of our central institutions. Religious institutions have long been devoted to educating and purifying the soul. Educational institutions are dedicated to the enhancement of individual mental functioning, families are centrally concerned with building the character of the young, democratic institutions are founded on the belief in independent judgment, and courts of law could scarcely operate without the concepts of intention, memory, and conscious knowledge firmly in place. Placed in this light, we also find that one of the major effects of 20th century social science is the objectification of the psychological world. Whereas philosophers, priests, and poets of previous centuries were largely confined to a rhetoric of symbols-of written and spoken language-the social sciences were (and continue to be) additionally armed with a rhetoric of observation. That is, the social sciences-derived as they are from the combined logics of rationalist and empiricist philosophy-promised, at last, to ground theoretical speculation in the observable world. Whether it be in the introspective methods of the early mentalist psychologists, the experimental methods of the laboratory psychologist, the phenomenological methods\n\nBy tradition, cognitive science uses the computer metaphor and psychological models that attempt to explain human complexity isolating the subject of sociocultural plot. Breaking with cartesian dualism, we invite the reader to consider the virtual-real continuous, in which the self is constituted as a discursive construction, social and narratively structured that emerges and develops in sequences of dialogical action established by partners located in time and space. Accordingly, we address aspects of communication and interaction on subjective relationships and intimacy we have with others while navigating on the internet. Paradoxically, in digital culture, fiction and non-fiction walk intertwined, supporting our practices with resources that allow us to compensate for the lack of a physical body. Basing on these assumptions, we investigated how the continuities and discontinuities occur in discursive ways in which people relate to themselves while transits on virtual and physical scenarios. For that, we turn to the ethnographic method. More specifically, we used: video version of the classic A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens; interview protocol about personal continuity interrelated to the film, the self and Orkut, and clippings Orkut profiles of respondents. Three subjects participated in the study: one male and two females, aged between 20 and 30 years. Paying attention to the pragmatic aspect of the utterance or speech, we chose the enunciation because it reveals the voices of the \"I\" positions that connects the agent of speech to the audience in communicative practices of sustaining themselves. In the analysis, we grouped the responses according to the content that corresponded, in this case, to the \"I\" positions in the narrative act. Thus, we identify two levels of analysis: in the first one, the subject is engaged in a process of authorship, in the second one, the subject acts as if he/her were another. In such circumstances, the positions taken by the subject allow him/her to move through the imagination, as though in space, in accordance with changes in situation and time. By this study, we concluded that: 1) affinities, likes and interests are anchors that people use at virtual world to bring them what they know of the physical world, 2) the number of singularities (other \"I\" s) are interconnected to affinities, likes and interests, whose associations are located in the virtual environment on the links (symbolic places) between profiles and communities (writing, photos, images, audio, video), as well as between users and developers (aid terms , security center, etc.), 3) people do not connect to the internet just because they are geographically distant, but mainly because they seek answers, seek to establish that the communicative ties closer together; 4) while communicating, the user may oppose the idea that others have of him/her, if different from the others, although simultaneously is engaged in groups that make he/she similar to and different from each other as a communal.\n\nPostphenomenology and posthermeneutics as initiated by Ihde have made important contributions to conceptualizing understanding human–technology relations. However, their focus on individual perception, artifacts, and static embodiment has its limitations when it comes to understanding the embodied use of technology as (1) involving bodily movement, (2) social, and (3) taking place within, and configuring, a temporal horizon. To account for these dimensions of experience, action, and existence with technology, this paper proposes to use a conceptual framework based on performance metaphors. Drawing on metaphors from three performance arts—dance, theatre, and music—and giving examples from social media and other technologies, it is shown that we can helpfully describe technology use and experience as performance involving movement, sociality, and temporality. Moreover, it is argued that these metaphors can also be used to reformulate the idea that in such uses and experiences, now understood as “technoperformances”, technology is not merely a tool but also takes on a stronger, often non-intended role: not so much as “mediator” but as choreographer, director, and conductor of what we experience and do. Performance metaphors thus allow us to recast the phenomenology and hermeneutics of technology use as moving, social, and temporal—indeed historical—affair in which technologies take on the role of organizer and structurer of our performances, and in which humans are not necessarily the ones who are fully in control of the meanings, experiences, and actions that emerge from our engagement with the world, with technology, and with each other. This promises to give us a more comprehensive view of what it means to live with technology and how our lives are increasingly organized by technology— especially by smart technologies. Finally, it is argued that this has normative implications for an ethics and politics of technology, now understood as an ethics and politics of technoperformances.\n\nWe are spending more and more of our lives online. Meanwhile, the combination of constant connectivity and ubiquitous computing is folding the material world itself into an expansive 'Internet of things'. As a result the line between life online and life off-line has become blurred in an existential equivalence of the digital and the analog. In this networked ecosystem, the old Web 1.0 notion of an anonymous digital persona that is separate from off-line, analog self-identity is no longer applicable. A new paradigm for conceptualizing the dialectic of digital–analog self-identity is needed. To that end, I argue that in our age of networked connectivity, self-identity is being fashioned according to the aesthetics of transmedia production. I conclude that the transmedia paradigm , taken as a model for interpreting self-identity in the liminal space between the virtual and the real, reveals a transmediated self constituted as a browsable story-world that is integrated, dispersed , episodic, and interactive."
