        "text": "How much consumers spend on video games\n\nA total of $56.6 billion was spent on video games in 2022, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. This includes consoles, games, and accessories.\n\nGiven that there are 131.2 million households in the United States, a conservative average estimate of gaming spending per household is $431. This assumes that there's one gamer per household.\n\nSpending on video games varies by family size, structure, and income. A family with kids, for example, may be more likely to spend on video games. And families with higher income could be expected to have more cash to splurge on a new console or buy new video game releases on a more consistent basis.\n\nThat's backed up by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here's how we broke down that data.\n\nFamilies spent an average of $698 on \"other entertainment equipment and services\" in 2022.\n\nThe \"other entertainment equipment and services\" category includes spending on video games, as well as a range of other products that do not fall into the other major entertainment categories of fees and admission; television, radio, and sound equipment; and pets, toys, hobbies, and playground equipment.\n\nIt's more than likely that not all of the $698 spent by the average American family in that category was spent on video games. And the data reveals that average spend in this category is pulled up significantly by high-income households.\n\nWhile the category is broad, it is a useful proxy for video game spending. For example, spending grew by nearly 50% from 2019 to 2020 and by 60% from 2020 to 2021 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when, according to the Entertainment Software Association, video game spending and time spent playing video games grew significantly.\n\nVideo game spending by income\n\nThe top 20% of earners spent $1,843 on \"other entertainment,\" including video games, in 2022, according to BLS. The next lowest income quintile spent $588 and the lowest income segment spent just $88 over the course of the entire year. The average spend on \"other entertainment\" across all income levels was $698.\n\nHouseholds that earned $200,000 or more in 2022 spent $2,401 on \"other entertainment,\" which includes video games.\n\nIt's logical that households with more income spend more on video games, which clearly fall into discretionary spending. Those households tend to have more disposable income to spend on categories like entertainment.\n\nWith video games and consoles becoming more expensive and microtransactions becoming the norm across platforms, it's not difficult to see the most wealthy households spending over $1,000 a year on video games.\n\nVideo game spending by family structure\n\nMarried couples with kids spent $1,244 on \"other entertainment,\" including video games, in 2022, compared to the average spend of $698.\n\nVideo games have always been a staple birthday or holiday present for kids and they're a great way to keep kids entertained, so it's no surprise that families with kids tend to spend more in the category that includes video games than families without kids.\n\nVideo game spending by year\n\nAmericans spent $56.6 billion on video games in 2022. That total includes spending on consoles, games, and accessories, and is based on data from the NPD Group and Entertainment Software Association.\n\nGaming subscriptions and cloud gaming\n\nTwo trends are emerging in the video game industry that could reshape how consumers game -- and how they spend on gaming: video game subscription services and cloud gaming.\n\nGaming subscription services operate like Netflix or any other video streaming service. Subscribers pay a monthly subscription fee and get access to a library of games. The most popular services are Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.\n\nTens of millions of gamers subscribe to those services and the model has become a steady revenue source for Microsoft and Sony.\n\nMicrosoft reported 25 million players had signed up for Game Pass as of January 2022 and the company attributed a 13% increase in revenue from Xbox content and services to \"first-party content and Xbox Game Pass\" in its SEC filing covering the quarter ending in Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nSony reported 47.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers at the end of March 2023.\n\nThe top tier of Xbox Game Pass also provides gamers with access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which allows players to stream Xbox games onto internet-connected devices even if they don't have an Xbox. If the cloud model catches on, it could make gaming more accessible and affordable to families who don't want to splurge on a high-end console or PC.\n\nThe best-selling video games and consoles\n\nBest selling video games of 2022\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was the top-selling game for PC and console in 2022, while Candy Crush Saga was the top-grossing mobile game that year, according to the Entertainment Software Association."
