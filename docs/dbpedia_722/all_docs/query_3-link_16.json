        "text": "These are some of the most-used gaming terms that you may or may not have heard of. Our gaming glossary will help make you a better gamer, and check out our broadband for gaming hub for more tips on what you can do to up your game.\n\n8, 16, 32, 64-bit\n\nHardware and software from the third, fourth, and fifth generation of consoles, using 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit architecture.\n\n2D\n\nTwo-dimensional games can only be viewed from one angle. Platformers like Super Mario Bros are 2D, as are older RPGs like Zelda. Classically, 2D games are composed of 2D images, often called sprites, though nowadays they might be created from 3D graphics, in which case they’re sometimes called 2.5D.\n\n3D\n\nThree-dimensional games present game worlds that can be viewed from any angle. Most modern games are 3D, eg, Grand Theft Auto 5.\n\n4K and 8K resolution\n\nIn gaming terms, 4K refers either to an ultra-high-definition display, one whose resolution is roughly 4,000 pixels or to a game outputting at that resolution.\n\n8K is the same, except we’re talking 8,000 pixels now.\n\nAA / Auto-attack\n\nIn MOBAs and RTSes, an auto-attack is one that repeats at fixed intervals. AAs are a unit's bread-and-butter attack, unlike spells, which usually cost mana and must be explicitly triggered each time.\n\nAAA\n\nPronounced “triple-A”, AAA publishers are those with big budgets, like Square Enix and Nintendo, in contrast with indie game publishers.\n\nAchievements\n\nAwards given to the player for achieving arbitrary things set by the developers. Sometimes these can be as trivial as “watched the intro”. Sometimes they have nothing to do with the main game and getting them takes a lot of skill and time.\n\nDifferent platforms call their achievements different things, eg, trophies or missions.\n\nAdventure game\n\nAn immersive story-focused genre that involves playing as a protagonist through different challenges and/or solving puzzles.\n\nAFK\n\n“Away from keyboard”. Perhaps you’re in the loo; perhaps you’re making tea. Regardless, hopefully, your friends won’t start a game without you.\n\nAggro\n\nA term widely used in MMOs, aggro is attention from the enemy. “Drawing aggro” means to attract damage to yourself, perhaps by using special spells, perhaps just by becoming a big enough nuisance. Classically, this is the job of the tank.\n\nAI\n\nIn gaming, Artificial Intelligence refers to the behaviour of computer-controlled characters. Simulation games like The Sims make extensive use of complex AI, but “AI” can be used to refer to simpler behaviours, like the movement of NPCs in a town.\n\nAimbot\n\nIn shooters, a hack that aims for you.\n\nAlpha\n\nAn early version of a game, not usually accessible by the public.\n\nAnimation cancelling\n\nStopping your character from completing the full animation of an attack, often by issuing another command. If that attack is firing a gun, you might cancel it just after the projectile leaves the barrel. With a punch, you might do it the moment you’ve inflicted damage. A great way to increase DPS or escape attacks, and also a lot of fun.\n\nAOE\n\nAn area of effect ability is one whose effects are felt over an area. An example would be a healing spell that heals anyone within its bounds. Not to be confused with AoE, Age of Empires.\n\nAssist\n\nTaking part in takedown of a player but not getting the kill.\n\nAvatar\n\nAn optional profile picture used on a gaming account or in game. Avatars are usually characters within a game. They can also be original characters or ideas by an artist.\n\nBan\n\nA ban from joining the game or playing games. Some last mere hours, and some are permanent; these are called “permabans”.\n\nBattle Royale\n\nA game in which you win by being the last one standing. Usually, there exists some mechanism to force players together as the game goes on. The most famous battle royale game is Fortnite.\n\nBeat ’em up\n\nA genre that involves fighting enemies in a brawl-style hand-to-hand combat game. Notable beat ’em games up include Streets of Rage, Treachery in Beatdown City, and River City Girls.\n\nBeta\n\nA version of an upcoming game, released to build hype and provide feedback to the developers. It will be more complete than the alpha, but will still have bugs and gameplay issues that can be ironed out.\n\nBiome\n\nUsually used when talking about procedurally-generated games like Minecraft, a biome refers to the elements that make up an area. These elements might include the tileset, music, enemies, terrain, plants, and animals.\n\nBM\n\n“Bad manner”, or “bad manners”. Used to indicate another player was being disrespectful.\n\nBoosting\n\nPlaying games on a lower-ranked player’s account in order to raise their ranking. It’s usually a bannable offence; regardless, many high-ranking players, even professionals, have done it as a paid service.\n\nBoss\n\nA powerful monster you must defeat in order to progress. Sometimes a level will consist of only a boss; while other times a boss lies at the end of a level.\n\nBots\n\nA computer-controlled enemy or competitor.\n\nThe term is also used to refer to fake players controlled by user scripts, made for fun or for other reasons, for example, to level up characters.\n\nBRB\n\n“Be right back”: the user has gone AFK, but hopefully not for long.\n\nBuff\n\nAny kind of boost to a character’s power, usually to stats, like HP or MP. Usually, these are temporary; sometimes they’re permanent. A character might be able to buff themselves. “Support” characters are often able to buff multiple characters.\n\nA buff also refers to a balance adjustment that makes a character more powerful.\n\nBullet sponge\n\nAn enemy that takes a lot of hits to kill.\n\nCampaign\n\nA usually-single player mode in a game that has the player traverse through a series of levels, and which usually tells a story.\n\nCamping\n\nA strategy in which a player holds a static position that provides them with an advantage over their opponent. In an FPS this might be somewhere up high, or behind a door.\n\nCasual\n\nA game that is simple, easy, and not targeted at hardcore gamers. One that doesn’t require too much investment.\n\nCC\n\nCrowd control, or CC, describes abilities that restrict the damage output and movement of a unit. The term is used mostly in MOBAs and MMORPGs.\n\nCheat\n\nCheats give you advantages you don’t ordinarily have, eg, infinite lives. They’re usually accessed by entering codes at specific times. In some PC games, they’re entered into an in-game command line. Many old console game cheats existed to help developers debug their games.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA place where you can save your progress in-game.\n\nCheese/cheesing\n\nSimple tactics that are difficult to beat by all but the most experienced players. These aren’t the most honourable ways to win a match and can be pretty mean-spirited. Tragically, this makes them pretty fun when you’re the one doing them.\n\nClan\n\nA clan (or guild) refers to a community of players that play games together, often tackling challenges that require multiple players, or engaging in clan-to-clan combat. In MMORPGs, some clans compete in professional games.\n\nClass\n\nA “type” of character, different for each game. Some classes might be geared towards dealing damage, some for taking it, and some for supporting other teammates.\n\nClosed beta\n\nA beta that's only accessible to those with invites. Often, these invites are given out at events or in Twitch streams.\n\nCo-op\n\nA PVE game or game mode in which two or more players cooperate to beat a level, or win a round. A famous co-op game is Left 4 Dead.\n\nCOD\n\nCall of Duty is one of the biggest FPS franchises ever released.\n\nCombo\n\nLoosely, any combination of attacks. In a 1-on-1 fighting game, these attacks will be consecutive. In team-based games, they might be simultaneous, a coordinated effort between team members.\n\nComplete/clock/beat\n\nTo finish a game from beginning to end.\n\nConsole\n\nA computer whose primary purpose is playing games. Also, another name for a command prompt in PC games like Quake.\n\nCooldown\n\nA period after the use of a skill during which the skill can’t be used again.\n\nCPU\n\nCentral processing unit, the computer component that executes programs. A CPU character is one controlled by the game, ie, a bot.\n\nCrafting\n\nA mechanism whereby items are created by combining other ones.\n\nCritical hit\n\nAn attack that deals a considerably higher amount of damage than a normal attack. Crits usually have a percentage chance of triggering and can feel quite satisfying.\n\nCross-platform\n\nA game that is released on more than one platform.\n\nCTF\n\n“Capture the flag”, a game mode, usually in team-based FPS games, in which your team must capture a “flag”, which spans between your and the enemy’s bases. You must then get the flag back to your base and hold it for a certain amount of time to score.\n\nCutscene\n\nA non-interactive scene in a video game for the purpose of story progression.\n\nD-pad\n\nThe directional buttons (up, down, left, right) on a controller.\n\nDeathmatch\n\nA simple game mode in which the winner is the player who gets the most kills. It is mostly seen in shooters.\n\nDebuff\n\nAny effect that makes a player or character weaker. Debuffs can be applied to you by an enemy character’s skill, or by an item or region in the game.\n\nDemo\n\nA short taster of a game, a bait for players who might buy the full game. There are playable demos, or demos consisting of in-game gameplay, interviews and other relevant media for a new and upcoming release.\n\nDeveloper\n\nAn individual or team that creates games.\n\nDLC\n\nDownloadable content is extra content created for a game after release. It can contain anything from extra game modes to character stories to horse armour. It differs from a patch in that it’s optional.\n\nDPS\n\nDamage per second is the amount of damage a character will ideally do per second. Usually, DPS is used to describe sustained damage, that is, damage that can be outputted indefinitely. If the damage is done all at once, it’s referred to as “burst damage”.\n\nDraw distance\n\nIn a 3D game, the amount of the world that’s drawn. Beyond the draw distance, nothing will be seen except the background. A fog effect was once common to hide “pop-in”, the sudden appearance of objects as they came within the draw distance. Nowadays fog is uncommon: draw distances are very long.\n\nDriving simulator\n\nA driving game, usually a racer, which tries to present an accurate depiction of driving. The popular Forza games are driving simulators.\n\nDRM\n\nDigital rights management refers to various strategies employed by developers to prevent digital content from being copied, an attempt to prohibit piracy.\n\nDual wield\n\nSimply put, the ability to carry and use two weapons.\n\nEaster egg\n\nAny hidden thing in a game that serves no purpose; usually they’re jokes.\n\nEmulator\n\nIn gaming terms, a program that lets you play games designed for other consoles.\n\nEsports\n\nElectronic Sports is the name given to the competitive gaming scene.

Also called grinding.\n\nFeeding\n\nIn games that reward players for kills with experience, feeding is repeatedly dying, thus making the recipient of your XP more powerful (“fed”).\n\nFighting game\n\nA genre of game that, you guessed it, involves fighting. The quintessential fighting games are those in the style of Street Fighter, but more unusual games like Smash Bros are also fighters.\n\nFlying simulator\n\nA game that mimics the real-life flying of an aircraft. The most famous example is Microsoft’s Flight Simulator.\n\nFog of war\n\nIn strategy games, enemy units are only shown to you if your own units are close enough to “see” them. Everything else is shrouded beneath the “fog of war”.\n\nFOV\n\nIn a 3D game, your Field of View influences how much of the world you can see at once. A higher FOV can be helpful for people who suffer from motion sickness in 3D games.\n\nFPS (Frames per second)\n\nThe number of times the game world is simulated per second. Higher = smoother, smoother = better.\n\nFPS (First-person shooter)\n\nA genre in which you look through the eyes of your character, and that features gun-based combat.

A term used at the end of a game to show good sportsmanship. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the game was “good”.

In building games like Minecraft, they might destroy their fellow players’ builds.\n\nGrinding\n\nIn one sense, identical to farming.

Mario Party is one of the most popular and longest-running party video games.\n\nPatch\n\nA change to the game which is usually delivered automatically and over the Internet. A patch may add features, tweak maps, or buff or nerf characters.\n\nPeel\n\nTo direct damage away from a team member so they can continue to attack.

Famous RPGs include Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Skyrim.\n\nRTS\n\nReal-time strategy: a genre in which you fight with an army. Similar is turn-based strategy.

The act of playing on a smurf account is called smurfing and is usually frowned upon because the smurfing player’s skill will be higher than that of the players they’re matched against.\n\nSpeedrun\n\nSpeeding through a game as fast as possible. Speedrunning is a pretty big scene.\n\nSpells, skills\n\nA character’s special abilities.\n\nStrafing\n\nIn a shooter, moving side to side in order to dodge while keeping your guns trained on your enemy.\n\nTank\n\nA role on a team, usually played by a character whose class is also called “tank”. Tanks have high defence stats and strong defensive spells. They “tank” damage, thereby shielding their “squishier” teammates, whose job is often dealing damage to the enemy.\n\nTroll\n\nA player who isn’t taking a game seriously. They might do something that is perceived as throwing the game, “for the lols”.\n\nTryhard\n\nSomeone who is perceived to be going over the top in order to win a game that was clearly theirs to win.\n\nUnit\n\nA single soldier in your army in a strategy game.\n\nVanilla\n\nVanilla refers to games in their original untouched form, free of mods or tweaks.
