        "text": "Why do you want to get a games console?\n\nWhilst deciding if it is time for your child to have their first games console can be a great opportunity to find out what your child expects to use it for. This could be for playing online, playing with siblings or friends, or for playing by themselves.\n\nWhat do you like about your games console? What is your favourite game?\n\nIf your child already has a games console, you can ask them about their favourite things to play, you can ask them to teach you to play the game and explore the ways to report and block players or content whilst playing together.\n\nWhat game do you really want to play?\n\nWhen talking about games your child wants to play, you can take a moment to discuss age ratings and what different content is available on different games. This can be a good opportunity to discuss your expectations around the games that your child can and can’t play.\n\nHow can we as a family help you to manage the time you spend gaming? Can we do anything to help you use the games console more safely?\n\nFinding out how your child wants to be supported whilst online is a great way to open up wider conversations around online safety and the issues young people may face whilst gaming. You can also look at establishing a family agreement to manage your families time online.\n\nWhat would you do if something worrying or upsetting happened on your games console?\n\nTell your child what they should do if something goes wrong while using it. This could be to close the screen and tell an adult. See below for conversation starter ideas.\n\nA games console is a computer device used to play virtual, or ‘video’ games, on a screen. Some connect to a television; others are handheld with the screens built into them. Games are either inserted into the device as a disc or card or downloaded directly onto the device via the internet and the device’s online store.\n\nThere is no official or recommended age for a child to have or use a games console.\n\nHowever, like films, video games are given age ratings. They can be rated as suitable for 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18 years old. Read more about age ratings on the PEGI website.\n\nOnline gaming is becoming more popular; 59% of 5-15s now play games online, increasing from 53% since 2018 and 45% five years ago. (Ofcom 2019)\n\nAs with any piece of technology, use your judgement to decide if you are happy for your child to use it.\n\nUse the games console with your child as a fun way to familiarise yourself with the device, how it works and how they like to use it. This can be a great way to model responsible and positive use of technology and show your child you are interested in how they use it.\n\nExplore the parental controls on offer and set up boundaries with your child around how you expect them to use the console. A family agreement can help you to set out your expectations with your child whether you are getting a new device or have been using one for a while. Make sure you give them the confidence to talk to you if anything worries or upset them while using it.\n\nFor more information on the games consoles available and a list of things to consider before making this purchase, visit Internet Matters’ guide on games consoles for children.\n\nEnsure that any second hand games console has been restored to its factory settings before your child uses it. This means deleting all data on the console and returning it to the state it would have been in if purchased brand new. This will avoid the possibility of accessing someone else’s personal information, private messages, photos, accounts, etc. It will also allow you to set up parental controls that are most suitable for your child. Find out how to restore a specific games console to its factory settings here for PlayStation 4, XBOX One, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nGames consoles are mainly used to play video games, either by yourself or with others. Playing with Multiple people can play in person using several controllers plugged into the same console, or from different locations by using an internet connection.\n\nGames consoles can also be used to browse the internet, stream videos and music, store and access photos and files, and more. Gaming also has a social element and provides a virtual space where young people can spend time chatting with friends.\n\nLike any piece of technology, games consoles have both benefits and risks. Many of the risks depend on how a games console is being used and the apps that are installed. For example, if it is being used for chatting as well as gaming, this could introduce a risk of communication with strangers.\n\nExplore parental controls and privacy options. These offer settings such as age limits for downloading new games, time limits and disabling private chat. For more information on parental controls, check the console’s specific website, the Ofcom website, or the Internet Matters guides on gaming consoles. For guidance on the age suitability of a game, search the title on Common Sense Media.\n\nExplain to your child the importance of not giving away personal information, images, or their location to people they do not know online, and to tell you about anyone who pressures them for these in a game.\n\nKeep talking with your child about how they are using the console and take an interest in their gaming. Open conversation lets your child know you are someone they can go with any questions or worries.\n\nFor help for on specific problems, see the following advice on online bullying, sexting, pornography, social media, parental controls and online challenges.\n\nReassure your child they have done the right thing by telling you and that you are there to listen and help. Try to remain calm and non-judgemental, to help your child feel comfortable in telling you how the issue happened.\n\nWork with your child to report or block any unacceptable behaviour or other users. Contact your child’s school for further support, particularly if it involves cyberbullying between classmates or inappropriate contact from an adult. If you suspect that your child is or has been the subject of inappropriate sexual contact by another person (grooming), report this to Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre at www.ceop.police.uk.\n\nIf your child has accessed inappropriate content, you can report this to the site or service it appeared on. Find out how to do this on the Childnet website.\n\nExplore the settings to see if you can limit the risk of it happening again.\n\nFor help for on specific problems, see the following advice on online bullying, sexting, pornography, social media, parental controls and online challenges."
