        "text": "Video game developers help transform games from a concept to a playable reality. They do this by coding visual elements, programming features, and testing iterations until a game is ready for market. If you love video games and enjoy working with computers, a career in video game development can be immensely rewarding.\n\nWhat is a video game developer?\n\nGame developers typically play a role in several elements of game development, including visuals, artificial intelligence, user interface, and game logic. Game developers take the game designers' designs, storyboards, and ideas and use them as blueprints to bring the game to life as something gamers can actually play.Â\n\nTasks and responsibilities\n\nThe type of work you do as a game developer will vary depending on the size of the company you work for and your specialization. At bigger game companies, youâre more likely to have a more specialized role working on a specific element of the game. At an indie publisher, you may have a hand in multiple processes in a gameâs lifecycle. These are some of the day-to-day tasks you may perform in this role:\n\nDevelop new ideas for game design\n\nTranslate visual ideas into code\n\nPrototype, iterate, and polish gameplay\n\nCollaborate with designers, producers, artists, and quality analysts\n\nMonitor game stability across platforms\n\nReview existing code and recommend improvements\n\nPort games or elements from one system to another\n\nTypes of game developers\n\nIn this industry, youâll typically work in one of four types of roles: first, second, or third-party developers, or independent (indie) developers. What path you choose to pursue will depend on where you are in your career, what elements of game development youâre interested in, and how much creative control you want over the final product.\n\nSpecializations\n\nIn addition to deciding what type of developer you might want to be, you might also choose to specialize. You can develop niche skills based on the type of system (console, computer, or mobile), game type (simulation, adventure, role-playing, strategy, etc.), or a specific game element (in-game systems, level design, user interface, environment, etc).Â\n\nLearn about the role games play in the metaverse and gaming opportunities for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and extended reality (XR) in Meta's What Is the Metaverse? course.\n\nIs game development a good career?\n\nMany game developers get into the industry out of a love of gaming. More than 215 million people in the United States play video games, according to the Entertainment Software Association, making it a leading form of entertainment [1]. While working in video game development can be challenging, it can also be rewarding to take part in creating something youâre passionate about (and that your potential customers are passionate about as well).Â\n\nGame developer salary\n\nAccording to the 2021 Developer Satisfaction Survey, conducted by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), 63 percent of fully employed developers reported earning more than $50,000 per year [2]. Job site Glassdoor reports an even higher figureâ$74,838 average base payâfor game developers in the US (as of October 2022).\n\nJob outlook\n\nThe video game industry has historically been fast growing and will likely continue along that trajectory, according to IGDA [2]. As gaming continues to drive innovation, job opportunities could expand in areas like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) gaming, artificial intelligence (AI), and esports.\n\nHow to become a game developer\n\nVideo game development is typically seen as a highly coveted career, especially for those with an established love of video games. Letâs take a look at some of the educational recommendations and skills you can build that could make you more competitive in your job search.\n\nEducational requirements\n\nMany game development and publishing companies look for candidates with a bachelorâs degree in computer science or related field. Some universities have started offering degrees or minors in game design and interactive entertainment that are more specifically targeted toward the video game industry.Â With the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of London, for instance, you can specialize in cutting-edge topics like virtual reality, games development, or 3D graphics and animation.Â\n\nWhile a degree isnât always necessary, it can help you build the foundational technical skills necessary for success as a software developer.Â\n\nRead more: Your Guide to Game Design Degrees\n\nGame developer skills\n\nHaving the right technical skills on your resume can open up opportunities for work as a game developer. Two common skills youâll find on job listings are experience with game development engines and the ability to code (often in C# or C++).\n\nUnity is a cross-platform game engine that allows you to develop 2D and 3D games. Unity is particularly popular for indie and mobile games. Itâs free for students and for personal use, so you can start creating games (and gaining experience) before you get hired.\n\nUnreal Engine, while initially developed for first-person shooters, has grown into a 3D creation platform used for games across a range of platforms. Unreal uses C++ as its programming language.\n\nC# (pronounced C-sharp) is a programming language frequently used for game development and mobile applications, particularly with the Unity engine.\n\nC++ Is a general-purpose programming language often used to develop not only games but also operating systems and applications as well.Â Â\n\nTips for getting a job\n\nIf you have a passion for games and enjoy blending technology and creativity, there are some steps you can take to help you get established in the gaming industry.\n\nStart with simple games or small game behaviors.\n\nStart developing your skills right away by building games. Start with something small and basic, like creating a simple behavior or keyboard movement mechanic in C# or, and work your way toward more complex projects.\n\nBuilt a portfolio.\n\nAs you develop your own games, add them to your portfolio. This shows potential employers what youâre capable of doing and can help you stand out from other candidates. Here are some options to get you started:\n\nBuild four complete Unity game projects with the Game Design and Development with Unity 2020 Specialization from Michigan State University.\n\nLearn C++ and Unreal while developing larger console applications with the C++ Programming for Unreal Game Development Specialization from the University of Colorado.\n\nStart out as a QA tester.\n\nQuality assurance (QA) testers systematically test games for any flaws or bugs. This entry-level role can be a good way to gain experience (and get established) in the gaming industry.\n\nAttend game industry events.\n\nAs with many industries, effective networking can help you find opportunities you might not otherwise know about. Attend game industry events where you can meet other developers and game development studios. One particularly good option that welcomes career seekers is the Game Development Conference (GDC).\n\nOther video game careers\n\nMany different elements (and people) go into making a video game. If youâre interested in creating games, consider these roles as well. Note that some may fall under the umbrella of game development.\n\nGame artists create the 2D and 3D images used to render graphics within a game.\n\nAnimators use specialized software to make characters, settings, props, and other objects come to life.\n\nWriters create in-game scripts and dialogs, as well as write marketing materials and technical documentation for a game.\n\nAudio engineers edit and mix soundtracks for games that might include background music, voice-over recordings, and sound effects.\n\nProducers serve as project managers, overseeing the production process from conception to completion.\n\nVideo game designers conceptualize game characters, settings, storyline, and gameplay, then work with developers and game programmers to translate these ideas into code.\n\nGame testers identify bugs in a game and report these findings to developers.\n\nStart your career in video games\n\nIf youâre ready to take the next step toward a career as a game developer, consider taking Michigan State Universityâs Game Design and Development with Unity 2020 Specialization (updated for 2021). This series of five courses will get you started with the tools and techniques to begin developing your own 2D and 3D games. You can also explore the future of video games and game engines powering the metaverse in Meta's What Is the Metaverse? course.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)"
