I will share my PPT via Smart Board, which has video clips and pictures.\n\nExplore\n\nThere will be samples of various sizes of oyster shells. Students will be able to pick up and really look at the details of the oyster shells. Students will write down what they observe. Once completed, students will write down some “I wonder” questions. This will be done on the left hand side of their interactive notebook. There will also be some questions that the groups will have to answer:\n\nWhy do you think oysters have thick shells?\n\nCan you explain how this adaptation helps the organism?\n\nWhat do you think the shell is made of?\n\nWhat would the outcome be if oyster shells were easy to crack? With the concern of predators.\n\nExplain\n\nStudents will complete the vocabulary activity sheet provided to them. There are 4 columns that students will need to fill out; what do you think the word means, the actual definition, illustration, and using it in a sentence. The vocabulary words are: species, adaptation, niche, predator, prey, habitat, and calibrator. Once completed and reviewed with group members, students will trim and glue on a blank left page of their interactive notebook. On the right side of their interactive notebook, students will trim and glue the Eastern Oyster Poster (as seen below). This is a wonderful information sheet that students will go over and will be quizzed as their “out the door pass.” Then using poster paper, groups will each be responsible for teaching the class about their section. They can present it as a comic strip, wanted poster, thinking map…etc. It is required that the new learned vocabulary be used throughout this assignment.\n\nGroup1-Why are oyster reefs important?\n\nGroup2-What are the habitat requirements for oysters?\n\nGroup3-How have oysters adapted to survive?\n\nGroup4-What is filter feeding?\n\nGroup5-What are oysters threatened by?\n\nVocabulary\n\nWords\n\nWhat do you think it means? Actual\n\nDefinitions\n\nIllustration Use in a Sentence Species Adaptations Niche Predator Prey Habitat Calibrator\n\nElaborate\n\nMath connection- Teaching across the disciplines\n\nMath Connection~ using the calibrators, students will measure to find the diameter of each oyster shell. Using their interactive notebooks (left side), students will create a data box using a ruler; this is where the shell measurements and average will go. Students must also label their data table. Once all of the measurements have been taken, students will find the average of the oyster shells diameter.\n\nEvaluate\n\nWhat have we learned about adaptations?\n\nStudents will be given a short quiz using the Smart Board and Mimio Votes. The data from the quiz will be shared with the class, whole group. This is valuable information for the teacher and students. Students will then be given each a sticky note and as their ticket out the door they must write down a fact about the adaptation of oysters that they learned today. The teacher will review and check for understanding.\n\nSummative Research Meeting 2015\n\nJuly 31st, 2015\n\n5E Refresher\n\nRole of Teacher and Student Puzzle\n\nOverview of 5E Instructional Model\n\nLesson Planning\n\n5E Lesson Plan Template\n\nScience TEKS\n\nMath TEKS\n\nLesson Plan Feedback Form\n\nLunch\n\nIntroductions and Thank You to Professors and Graduate Students\n\nTime to Share\n\nPresentations with Feedback\n\nEvaluation\n\nCAMT 2015\n\nAgents for Change: Lisa Benavides, Martha Buendia, Lisa Coates, Ashley Davis, Christina Escobar, Amanda Gonzalez, Shelby Keeler, Sam Kureska, Tara McKenna, Natalie Roach, Harry Samuels, Catherine Stein, Adriane Taylor\n\nThe Task:\n\nTravel to Houston, TX to attend the Conference for the Advancement of Mathematics Teaching (CAMT).

Logging In\n\nGo to eteamscc.com\n\nTo add content to the website or edit existing content, click Login (in the top navigation bar) and enter your username and password (the username typically your email address before the @ sign)\n\nAfter logging-in, you will be redirected to your profile page. You can change your password, but this is not necessary or required.\n\nTo return to the home page, click on the logo in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nII. Adding a Research Log: Required Elements\n\nRight next to the link to the home screen, you will see From add new, there is a drop down that says research log.\n\nName your Log.\n\nIn the first open box, you can put text, a picture, or leave it blank.\n\nDiscussion: you can choose to allow comments.\n\nMore Fields: these coincide with the field notes logs provided in your binder. You need to write something in each of these fields: Who We Are, What We Did, What We Learned, Questions We Have, Connections to Teaching\n\nCategories: This is found on the right side of the screen. You need to check which of the nine projects that your research log belongs to (for ex: Blue Crab Ecology).\n\nSAVE: At this point, you can either save as draft or publish.\n\nIII. Formatting a Log\n\nalignment\n\nfont color\n\nfont size\n\nIV. Editing or Deleting a Log\n\na) To get back to a log, you can go to the dashboard and click on all research logs.\n\nb) If you hover over your log, you will have the options to either edit or trash.\n\nIV. Creating a Research Log: Additional Features\n\na) Set Featured Image is found on the bottom right of the screen. If you click on that, you can either use an image in the media library or upload your own image.\n\nb) Linking a Document: Add Media allows you to link a word/pdf document. If you are linking a document, you can name that document. It is recommended you change the color so that others know that something is linked.\n\nc) Uploading an Image: Add Media allows you to upload pictures. You can choose pictures from the media library or upload your own pictures. When you upload pictures. You will have the opportunity to adjust the size before inserting into post.\n\nd) Creating a Gallery: If you want to insert multiple pictures at one time, you can go to create gallery (left side of the screen once you start adding media).
