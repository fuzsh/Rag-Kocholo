Specifically, you would not use Class 28 if you're applying for:\n\nChristmas tree candles (Class 4 - Lubricants and Fuels)\n\ndiving equipment (Class 9 - Electrical and Scientific Apparatus)\n\nelectrical lights for Christmas trees (Class 11 - Environmental Control Apparatus)\n\nfishing nets (Class 22 - Cordage and Fibers)\n\nsports clothing (Class 25 - Clothing), and\n\nconfectionery for decorating Christmas trees (Class 30 - Staple Foods).\n\nExamples of Trademarks in Class 28\n\nYou can find trademarks that have been applied for or registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) under Class 28 in the Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS), an electronic trademark database.\n\nSome well-known examples of Class 28 marks include:\n\nBARBIE (dolls and their clothing and accessories)\n\nRAWLINGS (baseballs, baseball equipment), and\n\nNINTENDO (video game machines and equipment).\n\nUSPTO Trademark Classes\n\nThe USPTO, the federal agency that oversees the registration of federal trademarks, divides marks into 45 different classes of products and services. The purpose of these classes is to allow different types of businesses to register their trademarks into categories most related to their core business.\n\nThe first 34 classes consist of different broad categories of goods. The last 11 classes consist of different broad categories of services.\n\nRelated or Coordinated Classes to Class 28\n\nIf you're not sure whether you should apply for your mark under Class 28, you can consider a \"coordinated\" class. A coordinated class is one that's related to another class, usually because the USPTO has determined that applicants filing within one particular class often file in other specific classes, too.\n\nFor Class 28, the USPTO has determined the following classes to be coordinated classes:\n\nClass 9 - Electrical and Scientific Apparatus\n\nClass 16 - Paper Goods and Printed Matter\n\nClass 20 - Furniture and Articles Not Otherwise Classified\n\nClass 25 - Clothing\n\nClass 35 - Advertising and Business Services\n\nClass 41 - Education and Entertainment Services, and\n\nClass 42 - Computer and Scientific Services.\n\nTrademark Filing Fees\n\nThe trademark class system will also affect the scope of the registration fees that you pay. The USPTO charges a set filing fee per class of goods or services. So, if you apply for a trademark for posters (Class 16) and shirts (Class 25), you must pay the filing fee for two classes, which is double the filing fee for one class. (37 C.F.R. §2.6(a)(1)(2022).)\n\nBe sure to indicate the correct class at the time you're registering a trademark—if the application doesn't already do so for you. If you list the incorrect class, you must restart the application process, and your filing fees will not be refunded.\n\nYour registration is restricted to those classes that encompass the goods or services you're already offering (as shown by the specimens you submit) or that you plan to offer (if you're registering on an intent-to-use basis).\n\nUSPTO Specimens\n\nAt some point in the trademark application process, you'll need to supply the USPTO with a specimen. A specimen is a real-world example of how your mark is being used in association with your goods or services. In other words, it's how customers come across your mark as they shop for your goods or services.\n\nIf you're applying for a use-in-commerce trademark (you're already using your trademark to sell your goods or services), then you'll submit a specimen with your trademark application. If you're applying for an intent-to-use trademark (you haven't started using your trademark yet but plan to), then you'll submit a specimen after you've already submitted your trademark application once the trademark examiner—the person at the USPTO reviewing your application—requests it from you.\n\nFor every class of goods or services, you'll need to submit at least one specimen regardless of how many goods or services are listed under the class. So, if you apply for hats, t-shirts, and socks under Class 25, then you'll only need to submit one specimen and you can choose which good to include in your specimen.\n\n(37 C.F.R. §2.34(b)(2)(2022).)\n\nAcceptable Specimens for a Goods Trademark\n\nThe specimen must show the mark as used on or in connection with the goods in commerce. Specifically, a specimen for a goods trademark must show use of the mark in a manner that would be perceived by potential purchasers as identifying the applicant's goods and indicating the goods' source.\n\nWhen a trademark is on the good itself or on the packaging or containers of the goods, photographs or facsimiles showing the trademark in use on or with the goods are acceptable.\n\nA specimen for a goods trademark can appear:\n\nOn the good itself. The trademark can be imprinted on the body of the goods, as with metal stamping; it can be applied by a rubber stamp; or it can be inked on by using a stencil or template.\n\nOn a tag for the good. For example, you could include your trademark on a sales tag above the product price, or it can be printed below the product specifications on a mattress tag.\n\nOn a label for the good. For instance, your trademark could be on the UPC barcode sticker or on a drink's ingredients label. You could also use shipping or mailing labels affixed to the goods as long as the trademark functions as an indicator of the good's source. For example, if the trademark appears only on the return address, then the specimen wouldn't be appropriate.\n\nDirectly on the packaging or container for the good. The trademark can be on any type of commercial packaging that's normal for the particular goods as they move in trade, such as shipping boxes or shelf display packaging. For instance, gasoline pumps are normal containers or \"packaging\" for gasoline.\n\nOn a display associated with the goods. If you sell your goods at trade shows or community events, your trademark could be printed out next to a display of your goods as long as customers can connect your trademark with the goods. For example, your trademark could be printed on the tablecloth at your booth or on a sign hanging from your pop-up tent.\n\n(37 C.F.R. §2.56(2022).)\n\nWebpage Listing for a Goods Trademark\n\nIf you sell your goods online—whether on your own website or on a third-party online marketplace—you can use a screenshot of the webpage where your good is listed for sale as your specimen.\n\nThe webpage must include:\n\nyour trademark, either in the webpage header or in another prominent position\n\na picture or description of your good, and\n\na way for consumers to immediately purchase your good, such as an \"add to cart\" or \"buy now\" option.\n\nIf you use this kind of specimen, be sure you include—either on the screenshot or in the application—the website URL and the date you last accessed the webpage. (37 C.F.R. §2.56(c)(2022).)\n\nWhile most marks appear in writing somewhere, trademarks can also be in audio format. If your mark represents a service, and it appears only on radio ads or in some other audio form, you can submit a sound file of the audio."
