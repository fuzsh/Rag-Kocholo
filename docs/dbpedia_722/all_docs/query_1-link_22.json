        "text": "Updated July 17, 2024 in For Gamers\n\nEvery gamer is faced with a choice: PC vs console. Arguing about which one is better is the kind of debate that lights up message boards – which one is less expensive, has the best visuals, or has the best multiplayer competition? If you’re trying to decide between PC gaming vs console, we’ll break down each part of the debate to help you decide what’s best for you.\n\nWhether you want to use a console or a PC, the important thing is to enjoy the game. Considerations like your budget, technical skills, and available upgrades should play a part in making your decision.\n\nConsole vs PC Gaming - the lowdown\n\nBudget\n\nPC and console gamers both want the most bang for their buck, but what that looks like and how it’s measured is different for each group. For a console gamer, costs are generally limited to purchasing the console, extra controllers, games, and perhaps online multiplayer passes. For a PC gamer, there’s a wide variety of options to buy if you choose to build your own computer, but not every PC gamer has their own custom-built machine.\n\nBecause there’s such a wide variety of possibilities and differences in perceived value, it’s impossible to say either PCs or consoles are more cost-efficient. It completely depends on the individual. The level of customization and performance you’re looking for determines the size your budget needs to be to get the platform you want.\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nGenerally, PC gamers need to have more technical skills than console gamers. Although it is possible to modify a console by adding new hardware, it’s not necessary. Console gamers do need to be able to install the sequel or update of their games. PC gamers need at least a minimal level of technical skills, even if they purchased a pre-built gaming computer. And by technical skills, we don’t mean the ability to write HTML code, but the ability to set up a computer with a general concept of how it operates. A PC gamer might also want to upgrade hardware components and install new drivers for those components, which calls for an intermediate skill level.\n\nUpgrades\n\nIt is possible to add new hardware to a console with a minimal technical skill level. With a PC, the upgrades can be much more extensive. Each hardware component can be upgraded, along with other cosmetic features like the system’s case.\n\nCustomization\n\nCustomization is a key aspect of the gaming experience, allowing players to tailor their setups to their personal preferences. While both console and PC gamers can enjoy a degree of customization, PC gaming typically offers more extensive options.\n\nPC gamers have a broader range of customization options, from selecting components like GPUs, CPUs, and cooling systems to designing unique case aesthetics. This flexibility enables PC users to create highly personalized gaming rigs, whether they prefer sleek minimalist designs or bold, flashy setups. For more inspiration on PC customization, check out our article on PC white builds, which highlights creative ways to achieve a clean and stylish gaming rig.\n\nAdvantages of console gaming\n\nConsoles have advantages over PCs: They are easy to use, don't require upgrades, make for simple multiplayer with console-owning friends, are generally cheaper, and use wireless controllers that allow you to have a more active experience.\n\n1.) Consoles are simple, easy to use, and cost less\n\nMany gamers choose to play with a console because they are designed for easy set up and maintenance. Console gaming can start minutes after you remove the system from the box. There are no build times or technical skills needed to start having fun. Although the relative costs of consoles and PCs are debatable, generally, consoles cost less than gaming PCs. Plus, newer consoles can be used to stream movies, TV shows, and music — adding another perk to owning a console.\n\n2.) You don't have to upgrade hardware\n\nAnother advantage of console gaming is you can keep playing your games without worrying about hardware becoming obsolete. Unlike playing on a PC, which can require upgrades as PC games advance, consoles are built by the manufacturer with the necessary system requirements. However, console manufacturers will release new consoles in line with improvements in technology, so there is still a risk of old consoles not being supported for new games. The amount of time between new console releases depends on the manufacturer. So, console gamers will have to consider whether to upgrade or not when the latest system is released.\n\nAdditionally, many console gamers over time will have a collection of consoles to play games across systems. The lack of backwards compatibility, or the ability to play games released for previous generation consoles on newer generation machines, does mean players are often forced to upgrade.\n\n3.) Brings gaming to the masses, including improving multiplayer\n\nMost of your friends have console systems, too. It’s easy to get friends together to play, and consoles are set up for multiplayer games.\n\nPC gaming historically has been credited as the best for its online multiplayer functionality. However, consoles have since aimed to catch up with improvements with in-game communication and online game sharing, which is great for playing with friends. If it’s multiplayer gaming with friends you’re most interested in, you will need to consider which system your friends play on, as few consoles and games support cross-platform capability.\n\n4.) Console-exclusive titles\n\nIt’s true that some games are not available for PC, but rather remain console exclusives. Before committing to a console, consider which systems offer the games you love, as not all consoles offer the same range of games.\n\n5.) Wireless controllers\n\nWireless controllers allow you to be more active while playing. Many consoles have games that increase your physical activity and skills.\n\n6.) Storage Upgrades\n\nWhen deciding which console to purchase, it's essential to research the storage upgrade options available, as some consoles make it harder to upgrade storage. For instance, while the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally allow for easy upgrades with internal SSDs like the newly launched Crucial P310 2230, other consoles may have more restrictive upgrade paths.\n\nFor PlayStation users, the Crucial T500 is an excellent choice for expanding storage. This SSD is designed to meet the specific requirements of the PlayStation, offering both increased storage and improved load times. Ensuring compatibility and ease of upgrade can significantly impact your gaming experience, making it crucial to consider these factors when choosing your console.\n\nIn addition to internal SSDs, external SSDs can also provide a valuable storage solution. External SSDs like the Crucial X10 Pro are perfect for transferring and expanding your gaming library. By downloading games to an external SSD, you can easily increase your storage capacity and have quick access to a larger library of games without the need to delete old favorites. This flexibility allows gamers to maximize their storage space and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.\n\nAdvantages of PC gaming\n\nPCs have different advantages, including the ability to customize your PC, create hotkeys, sharper and more lifelike visuals, superior accuracy with peripherals, and greater ability to modify games.\n\n1.) You can customize PC hardware\n\nBy building your own gaming PC you can choose where, when and how much you want to invest in your computer. Some gamers invest in maintaining a very high-end computer, preferring to run the newest game releases at the highest possible settings. Others choose to invest in a budget gaming PC and upgrade only when required.\n\nThe three components that gamers typically invest and upgrade the most often include:\n\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU) or graphics card which turns data into signals which are sent to the monitor. This data then creates the imagery or video you see on the screen.\n\nMemory (RAM): where game information is stored to be loaded or retrieved quickly. Here gamers consider how much RAM they might need, the frequency at which data can be transferred and speed (latency) of that information. Modern games generally require either 4GB or 8GB as the minimum RAM, newer games are now requiring 16GB and 32GB which helps ensure the best gameplay experience.

Find the best gaming memory for your gaming PC.\n\nHard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) is where game information, data, programs and other applications are stored on the computer permanently and retrieved when required. Most PC gamers prefer a solid state drive, as it provides greater speed, long term durability and reduces power consumption when compared to a hard drive.\n\n2.) The visuals are better\n\nIt’s one thing to dominate the competition, but it’s another to see it happen in the most stunning resolution possible. Whether it’s with integrated graphics or with a graphics processing unit (GPU) or graphics card, you’re in control of how sharp the visuals are. On a PC, you can also game on multiple screens at one time.\n\n3.) Control the way you play: gaming peripherals\n\nUnlike consoles, which can restrict the way you play, PC users benefit from a wide variety of controllers and mice to choose from. Gamers looking to kick back and relax can enjoy the freedom of wireless controllers, joysticks and even a steering wheel for racing games, like most consoles. However, when precision is key, PC users can utilize a gaming mouse. Gaming mice are particularly accurate, allowing you unrivalled control and accuracy during first-person shooter games. These are often favored by professional gamers who can’t afford to have anything less than perfect accuracy.\n\n4.) You can rescript your rig - or your game\n\nYou can change the physical appearance of your PC, and in many games, you can also modify gameplay by modding the game itself. Imagine hunting down opponents on a new map or switching out different character skins to add more personality to your game. You can often download other gamers’ mods, so you don’t have to do any of the work yourself. It’s all possible when you dive deeper into gaming and get into mods.\n\nGaming mods\n\n5.) PC games cost less\n\n6.) PC-exclusive titles\n\nIt’s true that some games remain console exclusives, but other popular games are PC exclusive as well. Just like with a console, before committing, consider which systems offer the games you love.\n\nSo, is a PC better than a console?\n\nWhen considering the epic battle between console or PC, it’s important to consider not only budget, but what experience overall you are looking to have. As a gamer, are you most concerned with convenience? Or cost? Multi-player online gaming? Do you enjoy or would you be interested in upgrading a computer yourself? At Crucial® the answer is clear; PC gaming is king. It’s a better experience gaming on a PC than console due to all the advantages that PC gaming offers. No matter what you choose, the important thing is to play and have fun."
