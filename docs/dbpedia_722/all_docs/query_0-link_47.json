        "text": "An agreement in principle has been reached for the football Warriors to join the Mountain West starting in July 2012. Details still need to be worked out, but no snags are expected.\n\nIt also appears things are in motion for UH’s non-football sports to join the Big West. There’s a screening process, which might take some time, but the path has been set for UH to join.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDefensive end Calen Friel, a 2010 Kailua High graduate who signed a letter of commitment with UH is February, is grayshirting this semester and remains committed to joining the Warriors in January. He said he has met the NCAA’s eligibility requirements.\n\nUntil becoming full-time students, grayshirts are essentially free agents. UCLA and Louisville have tried to lure away Friel. But he reaffirmed his pledge to play for the Warriors. Friel also said he has fully recovered from a torn ACL and will participate in the Warriors’ offseason conditioning program in January.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the biggest fans of the Rainbow Warrior basketball team is a player who chose to leave the program to pursue a career with the Warrior football team.\n\n“Obviously, I miss (basketball),” said Leroy Lutu Jr., who is redshirting as a safety this football season. “I’ve been playing (basketball) my whole life. The season just started, and I’ve watched some of the games. I’m going to miss it a little bit, but I missed football just as much, and I’m happy with my decision.”\n\nIndeed, the future appears bright for Lutu, who was a walk-on in basketball. The football coaches have praised Lutu’s development, and he is expected to challenge for playing time in 2011. Safeties Mana Silva and Spencer Smith are seniors.\n\n“I’m feeling great,” Lutu said. “My legs are coming back. I’m learning something new every day. I’ve been working with (associate head coach Rich) Miano, watching extra film, doing every footwork drill, getting into the weight room as much as I can.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAvis has selected Tom Mui as the winner of the Rainbow Wahine World Series T-shirt. Text me at 256-0223, and I’ll drop it off after this morning’s practice.\n\nAnd today’s contest involves the same prize. If you wish to enter, please post: Two days to pay dirt.\n\nAvis will choose a winner.\n\n* * * * *\n\nA very happy birthday to HawaiianBod."
