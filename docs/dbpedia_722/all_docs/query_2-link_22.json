        "text": "Games consoles were a sensation when they were first released in the early seventies, transforming the home television into an arcade gaming machine. Today, next-generation game consoles, manufactured by the likes of Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, feature some of the fastest computing and graphics processors. These devices offer 4K and 8K resolution output, allowing users to play video games that take part in massive virtual worlds and compete against or cooperate with other players around the globe. While allowing users to control a game that appears on an electronic display remains the primary focus of game consoles, most modern devices can perform the same functions as a home entertainment system. Each of the major gaming consoles has launched its own online platform for gaming services, and exclusive features, such as the PlayStation Network, the Xbox Network (formerly Xbox Live), and Nintendo Switch Online.\n\nRegional markets\n\nIn 2023, revenue from the global video game console market is expected to generate over 21 billion U.S. dollars, up from 20.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 and around 19 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. This is likely due to the many people who turned to home entertainment during periods of self-isolation throughout the coronavirus pandemic, with the accessibility of game consoles making them a popular choice. In 2024, video game console revenues are expected to continue increasing, with the U.S. console market forecast to reach 7.9 billion U.S. dollars, while gaming console revenues in Europe are predicted to earn 7.8 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nPlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo\n\nThree of the top five best-selling consoles of all time are Nintendo products: the Nintendo DS, the Switch, and the Game Boy. However, the PlayStation 2 is the top-selling video game console of all time, at almost 160 million units. Other major competitors include Microsoftâ€™s Xbox console family, with the Xbox 360 ranking at the ninth best-selling console of all time. Currently, the Nintendo Switch console leads the way for current-generation game consoles, with over 19 million devices sold in 2022 alone."
