        "text": "A. Content, in order of preference\n\nUncompiled source code: Version of a game that is ready to be sent to console manufacturers for certification. Contains files and folders created by a game developer and is still human readable using either a text editor, visual programming tool, or an integrated development environment (IDE).\n\nGold master build (specific file types will vary depending on company producing build): Version of the software and video game which meets all of a publisher and platform’s requirements and is considered the finished product. If a game is released on multiple platforms, each platform will require its own preferences on how a user interacts with the game. In essence the game’s gold master build release’s look and feel is varied by the publisher and platform.\n\nDistribution file (e.g. iOS App Store Package (IPA), Android Package (APK), exe [Windows]): The distribution file is disseminated for public use regardless of the means of dissemination (on physical media or via an online source) and is comprised of one or more files from the gold standard build.\n\nMedia-based release: The version of a distribution file disseminated via a media-based physical object (cartridge, disc- or disk-based media, etc.).\n\nInternet-based release: The release version of a software distributed via an online- or internet-based source, including mobile applications."
