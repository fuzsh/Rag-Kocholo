        "text": "ABSTRACT This study applied factor analysis for exploring technological knowledge of beginner and veteran Office Data Processing (ODP) teachers at Further Education and Training (FET) or Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges in South Africa. These ODP teachers use Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the technology-enhanced classrooms. The Mishra & Koehler (2006) Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework was extended by replacing Technological Knowledge with Procedural Functional Knowledge (PrFK) to realise the PrFPACK theoretical framework that enabled the researchers to holistically explore the contextual technological knowledge of teachers in the digital classroom environment. We developed an inventory of 65 comprehensive measures based on the PrFPACK framework and validated the inventory on a dataset of responses from 107 ODP teachers. The findings of this study generally revealed that Procedural Functional Content Knowledge is the most important factor in explaining the technological knowledge of ODP teachers.\n\nDespite access to Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures, teachers are not aware of the potential uses that technology offers in pedagogy. The objectives of the on-going study is to (1) empirically assess in-service and pre-service teachers’ e-skills, procedural and content knowledge with regards to the use of ICT tools to enhance appropriate usage for productive teaching and learning in South African high schools (2) evaluate teachers’ technology competence in the effective usage of ICT infrastructures as pedagogical tools to enhance students learning. The need for this study was influenced by various concerns expressed by educational stakeholders about the level of teachers’ competence with regard to the use of ICT infrastructure as a pedagogical tool in an ICT-enhanced classroom. The study survey 221 high school pre-service and in-service teachers in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The data collection instruments that was used in this study, to assess teachers’ e-skills and their procedural functional pedagogical knowledge include a TPACK-PrFPACK self-report survey questionnaire, with 39 items in 13 subcategories, as well as interviews, observations and a researcher’s log book. The survey data instrument was pilot tested. The test for internal consistency based upon Cronbach’s alpha indicates that the modification and adaptation process of the survey instrument is reliable and valid. The recorded interviews will be transcribed; using a log system, then it will be coded and imported into Atlas.ti. The findings of this study will be of particular relevance to both high school teachers and the educational policymakers in South Africa.\n\nThis study aims to examine classroom teachers’ Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) on the basis of different variables. A total of 322 classroom teachers in the city of Trabzon participated in the study. An adapted Turkish version of the TPACK scale was used as the data collection instrument. The obtained data was analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software. Independent t-test, ANOVA and Mann Whitney U-tests were used for statistical analysis. The results indicate that there are meaningful relationships and significant differences between variables of gender, having an Internet connection and the use of an ICT lab in the school, the use of educational software and the sub-factors of the TPACK scale. It is recommended that more practical CPD (Continuous Professional Development) opportunities for classroom teachers be provided in order to exploit the pedagogical benefits of ICT in primary schools.\n\nHelping beginner and veteran teachers to develop technological knowledge and skills in how to use new information and communications technologies (ICTs) to teach is a critical component of teacher preparation in this digital age. This article reports on a study in which 117 beginner and veteran (experienced) Computer Application Technology (CAT) teachers at 11 government Further Education and Training (FET) colleges in Gauteng, South Africa, completed a 65-item questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed 13 knowledge constructs, using a 5-point scale which addressed the nature and context of CAT teachers' procedural, functional and pedagogical content knowledge (PrFPACK) in an ICT-enhanced classroom. Additional data was solicited using classroom observation and interviews to understand CAT teachers' PrFPACK and e-skills in the use of ICT resources. The data was analysed using confirmatory factor analysis and thematic analysis. The research findings revealed a number of significant differences in beginner and veteran CAT teachers' PrFPACK. The results of the study confirmed that professional development of beginner and veteran teachers in the use of new ICTs in the digital age should be an ongoing effort in all educational institutions. It is imperative to train both beginner and veteran CAT teachers in an innovative method of teaching with ICT resources."
