        "text": "Watch the Trailer\n\nPrepare for the next chapter of Diablo® IV in Vessel of Hatred™. Become the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class. Expand your map to journey into the new region of Nahantu in search of Neyrelle, who is both suffering the fate of her choice to imprison the Prime Evil Mephisto, and seeking a means to destroy him. Recruit Mercenaries to aid you in combat, fight together in a new PvE co-op activity, & more. Pre-purchase and instantly unlock in-game rewards*.\n\nThe Druid is a savage shapeshifter, fluidly transforming between the forms of a towering bear or a vicious werewolf to fight alongside the creatures of the wild. He also commands the power of earth, wind, and storm, unleashing nature’s wrath to devastating effect.\n\nThe Rogue is an adaptable, agile warrior who can specialize in ranged or close quarters combat. She can best any foe with her imbued weapons, perform powerful combo attacks, and can augment her arsenal with deadly poisons and shadow magic to slay demons with impunity.\n\nThe Sorcerer shapes the elements into whatever form is necessary to ensure victory, from hurling bolts of lightning, impaling her foes upon jagged spikes of ice, and raining flaming meteors down from the sky.\n\nThe Spiritborn, apex predator of the Nahantu jungle, is poised to strike. With expert agility and mobility, they strike down foes with visceral ferocity, utilizing glaives, quarterstaves, and polearms as an extension of themselves. They channel the immense power and abilities of the four Spirit Guardians in battle, able to adapt to whatever is the swiftest path to dominance.\n\nWorld Bosses\n\nWorld Bosses are encountered in open-world areas and consist of multi-stage battles. Players have to work together to defeat them (up to 12 players can engage in the battle at a time) and will be rewarded with unique items should they prevail."
