        "text": "Month: June 2007\n\niPhone this iphone that\n\nSo I'm in Toronto and theres no iphones. But theres a stupid amount of coverage online including unboxings and taking apart the iphone. Here's some interesting things I've found while browsing around my aggregator.\n\nLG Prada vs Apple iPhone\n\nBear in mind the LG Prada came first and was announced long before the iPhone.\n\niPhone touch typing.\n\nJust as I thought, it was going to be bad but seriously its worst that I'd actually imagined. I thought if worst comes to worst you could use a stylus type thing but nope its made for thumbs and a little pressure. I have heard reports that it can be used in landscape mode while browsing the web but still. I know I can easily type faster on my stylus. Theres also some kind of bug with caps lock?\n\nEngadget first hands on in HD\n\nThis one covers the keyboard a lot better.\n\niPhone Live Disassembly\n\nHow to take the iphone to pieces. Theres some interesting facts in this too like memory sizes and sim cards.\n\n3G iPhone for Europe to be announced Monday?\n\nApple is set to announce a four-way deal: Vodafone and T-Mobile on the carrier front with Carphone Warehouse out in front as the MVNO. Hmmm, well, this kind of deal would certainly provide Apple's upstart mobile phone with far broader coverage than a Vodafone exclusive could muster while providing a solid brick-and-mortar base on a continent (mostly) void of Apple stores. Best of all for Europeans, the announcement expected on Monday will be 3G. That's right, while you're queuing up for EDGE data, Europeans might be unwrapping an HSDPA iPhone in a 4-way press release. Here's the rub, bub: do you really think Apple will provide Europe a 3G iPhone before the end of the year and not release it in the US at the same time? Now the tough choice: stand in line for your 2.5G iPhone or wait and see what happens on Monday with this rumor (and we repeat, it's just rumor at this point).\n\nIf this is true, I'll be quite shocked for those who bought the EDGE phones. EDGE is ok but yes no match for 3G speeds.\n\nGenerally, the iphone seems to working as expected but I've not seen much information about 3rd party applications in Safari. The landscape mode doesn't always work but hardware H.264 playback is good. Also heard little about battery life.\n\nIts simply a expensive beast. If it comes to Europe with a price tag of 350+ pounds and 2 year contract of 35 pounds or more a month. Its not going to go down well. Get the price down to 200 with a 25 pounds a month contract and Vodafone and Tmobile will sell them like hot cakes. I won't be switching to a iphone when it comes here.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nNever fly Go Globe Span\n\nI'm never flying Go Global Span again after my experience flying to Canada this week. Here's my twitters from the plane while I was sat on the tarmac in London Stansted and Birmingham. Also notice the times, I was in that plane for a bloody long time.\n\nSitting in stansted airport lounge wondering if I really want to fly to Toronto in something slightly bigger than a easyjet airplane.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nLondon Geekdinner with Julie Howell\n\nThis time a local superstar. Julie Howell from Fortune cookie previously with RNIB. The geekdinner started off slowly, I was a little upset that the bar upstairs wasn't to be opened with our favorite barmaid Henryetta. Most people turned up around 7:40pm and Julie turned up about the same. Unfortually due to all the flooding in the midlands, Julie was deeply worried about her house and her trip home, so said she would leave pretty soon after speaking.\n\nWhen the food came out which just on a side point was enough to feed everyone including vegans and people with dangerous allergies (see I do care and ask about you guys). i gave a brief introduction to Julie and off she went.\n\nI don't know how she did it but she managed to cover not only her past but accessibility now and in the future. See I told you she was good. There were plenty of questions afterwards about a whole host of things to do with Julie and her job. I think we over ran by about 10mins, so I had to cut it short knowing Julie had a long trip a head of her. Actually she emailed me the next day and said she never got home till after 1am!\n\nSo it was great to hear Julie talk again, she really held the geeks attention with the highs and lows of her life. Julie also attracted a quite a diverse crowd of geeks which was great again. Even the female Aral (marion) turned up for he first London social event. After the event a couple of the guys went out drinking to really end the evening, I made my excuses but I did hear it was a good end to the night.\n\nI thank everyone who turned up and made Julie welcome and look forward to hearing how Brighton Girl Geekdinners goes for Julie. I was actually going to recommend Julie to Sarah Blow of the London girl geekdinners.\n\nI'm looking to run another werewolf night in July and maybe have a special geekdinner with another out of towner in July. Details as I get them, but yes you can also join the London Geekdinner Facebook group, but for some reason its not working as expected.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nLondon Geekdinner with Jyri from Jaiku\n\nI made the mistake once again of not actually taking any stickers for my laptop. Damm it! Its also worth mentioning Guy West has put the video of Jyri's talk up here and Improbulus has a much deeper review of the night that I ever could write. I don't know how she does it but honestly when Improbulus covers something she does it so deep you feel the burn marks on the event or gadget.\n\nSo generally the event was boosted when Jason Canacus decided to come along too. Luckly he didn't steal the limelight from our guest Jyri. Actually to be honest Jyri was flipping awesome. He really controlled the room well, I hardly had to step into the conversation and there were some real strong personalities in the room.\n\nWe had about 50 people turn up for this geekdinner in our new home for geekdinners the Ye Olde Cock Tavern on Fleet Street. The venue worked well but the heat level in room was pretty high, so thats something to remember for next time. The microphone worked really well but there was a jazz playing upstairs which was strange and somewhat entertaining.\n\nI did get around to seeing almost everyone including Dan Gilmor who I missed earlier that day due to hackday meetings. Jason is one of those people I kind of don't mind. Ok don't take this the wrong way but Ben Metcafe, Jason and a few other out-spoken people I know are quite simlar and I don't mind them while others hate them for there outspokeness. Funny enough the same group of people (not mentioning any names).I don't mind them because Jason seems to be the kind of person who would call bullshit if he saw it. I know this puts people backs up, but generally I think you need people like this otherwise you get people like Mena talking at Le Web 2.0. Enough said really.\n\nAnyway the event went really well and we had quite a different group of people turn up, this was good because even Hugh McCloud seemed to be enjoying the geekdinner. Sucessful geekdinner with some high profile people. Thanks Jyri for agreeing to do the dinner and standing up giving us a free preview of whats was to come at the NMK forum the next day. Oh thanks to Ian from NMK for everything he did.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nA Holiday in Toronto, Canada\n\nCanada is one of those places I've always wanted to check out since I was young. Well now I'm off to check out Toronto, which just had a heatwave and would you believe it, its Canada day on 1st July. Now if someone would give me a iphone to smash, I would be very happy… (wink)\n\nThis obviously means blogging will either slow down or speed up depending on what I do while I'm in Toronto. Oh if your in Toronto and would like to meetup, please drop me a comment or email. I checked upcoming and eventful and theres little on it would seem.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nGabriel and Dresden Featuring Molly Bancroft – Let Go\n\nI've been listening to this tune a little too much I think.

But luckily there is some great UK series which are not to be missed. I've already mentioned Doctor Who which finishes next week. But what I failed to mention is this great new series called Jekyll (you can see the trailer here). Its a drama with a chilling edge and well worth watching.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nJust watched Good Copy Bad Copy\n\nI saw this come up in Particls but only just watched it. Its really good and comes highly recommended\n\nGood Copy Bad Copy is a terrific new documentary about copyright and culture, directed by Andreas Johnsen, Ralf Christensen, and Henrik Moltke. It features interviews with Danger Mouse, Girl Talk, Siva Vaidhyanathan, Lawrence Lessig, and many others with various perspectives on copyright.\n\nCheck out the film’s trailer below (via blip.tv) and download the torrent for the XviD version of the whole movie at goodcopybadcopy.net.\n\nmeta-technorati-tags=copyright, ip, film, torrent, music, creativecommons, goodcopy, badcopy\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nWetherspoon’s free wifi with your pint\n\nOnly found this thanks to Dave, now I know where I'll be drinking from now on.\n\nThanks to a partnership with ItBox, all customers with a Wi-Fi-enabled laptop will be able to connect to hi-speed Internet – free –for 30 minutes.\n\nIt really couldn’t be simpler, power up the laptop, order your drink or food from the bar and ask for a Wi-Fi voucher; this contains an access code for your computer. You will then connect to a network free for 30 minutes – order another drink and go on line for another 30 minutes.\n\nWetherspoon’s head of purchasing, Paul Hine, explains why the scheme has been introduced: “We really are in a mobile environment at the moment, with more and more people using the Internet for business and pleasure – 24/7.” “We felt that our pubs offer comfortable and private surroundings, to come to enjoy a drink or a meal and also connect to the Web.”\n\nThe service is available throughout the day at all Wetherspoon pubs and Lloyds No.1 bars. Leaflets detailing the new service are available at the bar.\n\nmeta-technorati-tags=wifi, weatherspoons, wireless, free\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nEvents next week\n\nQuick reminder for everyone, its going to be a busy week.\n\nMonday night is Werewolf night at the Ye Cock Taven on Fleet Street. As Tom says, we all know who the werewolf is.\n\nTuesday night is a geekdinner with Julie Howell also at the Ye Cock Taven.\n\nWednesday night there is a after party for Essential Web 2007 at the IMAX cinema. Please note this event is free and open to all.\n\nI hear Molly is in town, so hopefully she can make the Geekdinner with Julie or even the Werewolf night.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nThe findings of the Open Rights Group Election Observation\n\nOk I actually flicked through the document linked and I'm officially very scared.\n\nThe Open Rights Group (ORG) believes that the problems observed at the English and Scottish elections in May 2007 raise serious concerns regarding the suitability of e-voting and e-counting technologies for statutory elections. E-voting is a ‘black box system’, where the mechanisms for recording and tabulating the vote are hidden from the voter. This makes public scrutiny impossible, and leaves statutory elections open to error and fraud.\n\nThe Government has prioritised the introduction of e-voting because of the perceived convenience of new technologies, ignoring other vital considerations such as confidence and trust in the electoral system. ORG considers that the problems observed and difficulties scrutinising results delivered by e-counting systems bring their suitability for statutory elections into question.\n\nmeta-technorati-tags=democracy, openrightsgroup, evoting, elections, pdf, org\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nWiiJing a possible future for digital djing?\n\nI was catching up on some videocasts the today and came across a segment in the 1 upshow (gaming culture show) about a guy who dj's using wiimotes. I honestly took a double look and was thinking damm why didn't I think about that.\n\nIts odd because it all made so much sense. I had,\n\nSeen BBC Creative R&D using Glovepie to control a PVR/DVR and even Google Earth.\n\nWanted a Nintendo Wii for its clever use of fun and exercise.\n\nMoaned on about how digital djing was different to Vinyl or CD djing\n\nGone on about how the interfaces for digital djing should be very different to the vinyl equivalent\n\nI have had a good look around the setup there using and it looks like it could be adapted to VirtualDJ and one laptop if needed. So I'm going to try getting a Wiimote cheap on ebay this or next month and see what I can build. I actually think this kind of setup would suit music like trance a lot better (confirmed if you watch this video) that the stuff they were playing on the video. Virtual Dj has very assignable buttons and works with most of the things Tractor does, so hopefully that won't be a problem. Interestingly there is such a thing called wiij scratching, but is once again a clone of vinyl. I'm sure theres something else which can be done in this area but I was seriously impressed with Deckadance demo once again with dance music.\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]\n\nOk this, LOL Cats funny is…\n\nComments [Comments]\n\nTrackbacks [0]"
