        "text": "Back in the day, if you wanted to beatÂ Contra,Â all you had to do was punch in the Konami Code on your old-school NintendoÂ® controllerâupÂ >Â upÂ >Â downÂ >Â downÂ >Â leftÂ >Â rightÂ >Â leftÂ >Â rightÂ >Â BÂ >Â AÂ >Â SelectÂ >Â Startâand boom,Â you got 30 extra lives. It was that simple.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no equivalent for your entire gaming console, no perfect hack for your Xbox OneÂ® or PS5Â®. But if you treat these machines well, they can last a long time, giving you more chances to save the princess or emerge victorious in the final boss battle. Here are our tips and tricks to make your gaming console last for years.\n\nGive your console a break\n\nThe longer you play, the harder your gaming console has to work, which can cause it to overheat. Too much heat can lead to wear and tear on the delicate internal parts that make up your console, increasing the chances of a permanent game over for your machine.\n\nLimiting game time may be the last thing you want to do, but giving your system time to rest can help your console cool down and extend its lifespan.\n\nClean your console's air vents\n\nIf you've been on this floating space rock for a while, you've probably seen someone blow on aÂ Super MarioÂ cartridge like candles on a birthday cake. Whether that cartridge was dusty or not, it seemed like a clutch move.\n\nBut is it supported by science? Not really: Your moist, Cheeto-dusted breath may even corrode the game. But what science does support is the idea that cleaning your gaming console's vents and openings with canned air can make it last longer, saving you money in the long run.\n\nIf you haven't deep cleaned your console in a while, you should add that to your to-do list as well. The many crevices inside your console are magnets for airborne substancesâincluding dust, dirt, pet fur, and food crumbsâall of which can lead to system failures over time. Let an expert take care of an inside-and-out game console cleaning for you so you can spend less time battling grime and more time battling bad guys onscreen.\n\nGive your gaming console a proper home\n\nPick a place to set up your gaming console and leave it there. Limiting how much you move it around can reduce the chances that you'll drop it, ding it, or damage it, all of which may require an expert to come to your rescue.\n\nWhen picking the perfect location for your gaming console, choose a flat surface that's well-ventilated and doesn't get hit with direct sunlight. If you think that the pile of clothes in the corner counts, think again.\n\nUpdate your system's software regularly\n\nSoftware updates can seem annoying, but they're important. They're how SonyÂ®, MicrosoftÂ®, and other gaming companies repair bugs and errors, so you can enjoy hours of flawless game play. Ignore them at your own peril.\n\nBe careful with your discs\n\nTaping your disc together is not a great solution for fixing a split oneâwe've tried. Your game system has an internal laser that scans the disc for the information it needs to play it. Tape, glue, and other substances can ruin that delicate laser.\n\nWatch out for cracks, smudges, and fingerprints as well. Use circular motions to buff out the latter two. For cracks, however, you might want to think about getting rid of the disc or replacing it. This may mean letting go of your cracked copy ofÂ Jet Set RadioÂ (psst, you can find it onÂ Steam).\n\nProtect your ports\n\nIf you're a long-time gamer, you probably know the pain of someone tripping over the delicate cable system that connects your console to your TV before you've had a chance to save your game.\n\nIt's frustratingâand it can damage your machine. Removing the cord abruptly can bend the pins inside the port. It also forces an immediate shutdown, which can damage your console and shorten its lifespan."
