        "text": "byPierre Grande Guerre\n\n•\n\n28 May, 2019\n\n•\n\nYear of visit: 2009, 2010\n\nA photo report of our explorations of the front lines in the Sundgau region, Département Haut-Rhin. South of Mulhouse, west of Basel, east of Belfort, the Sundgau forms the most southern sector of the Western Front, which ends in the valley of the Largue river. We make a trip southward from Mulhouse to Pfetterhouse on the Swiss border. We start at Zillisheim to visit it's German 380 mm. artillery base. From there we continue to to the Illfurth Deutscher Soldatenfriedhof. Next we continue to Tagsfort, the \"Bismarck\" bunker near Largitzen, and to Mooslargue.\n\nFrom there we make a jump westward to Etupes to visit the grave of Caporal Peugeot, and his Site of Action at Joncherey. This photo impression ends with the last French bunker, \"Villa Agathe\", near Pfetterhouse and the last German bunkers at the southern end of the Western Front.\n\nWe start our trip at the site of the Zillisheim 380 mm. German Artillery Base. South of Mulhouse and south of the village of Zillisheim, ...\n\nIn the wood we walk along entrances of the underground tunnels, ...\n\n... which belonged to the underground railway system of the Zillisheim artillery base.\n\nOne of the entrances, a staircase leading down to a tunnel.\n\nIn the tunnel used to be a 60 cm. railway for transporting ammunition...\n\n... to the 380 mm. gun.\n\nThis site is basically similar to the German artillery base at Duzey, north of Verdun.\n\nSome details about the 380 mm. artillery gun\n\nSiegfried SKL 45 Max, made by Krupp Werke\n\nCalibre: 380 mm\n\nBarrel length: 19,6 m\n\nRange: 56 Km\n\nMuzzle velocity: 1050 m/s\n\nWeight of Gun in action: 24 Tons\n\nWeight of shell: 495-800 Kg\n\nRate of fire: 1 round every 4 minutes\n\nDistance from Zillisheim Artillery Base to Belfort: 35 Km.\n\nThe concrete base of this super gun is now filled with water and covered with duckweed.\n\nEntrances to the tunnels of the former ammunition elevators.\n\nOnly in August 1914 the artillery gun launched some grenades at the garrison at the fortress of Belfort.\n\nHundred and fifty meters to the south lies the electricity generator bunker.\n\nThis complex needed of course a lot of power.\n\nThe bunker is densely vegetated, ...\n\n... which makes it difficult to find the entrance.\n\nThe bunker forms only the entrance to filled in underground rooms.\n\nWe leave the bunker via another exit.\n\nFrom 1871 until 1918 the Sundgau belonged officially to the German Empire. This re-edited detail of a 1917 German sketch shows these borders. It also sketches the frontlines formed in the summer and autumn of 1914, and which would stay in this situation until 1918. The border lines of Switzerland, France and Germany came together at one point east of French Réchésy and west of German \"Pfetterhausen\" or nowadays Pfetterhouse.\n\nDuring the first days of the war Joffre deployed his Plan XVII, or Plan 17, also against the frontiers of the Sundgau region, especially at the German garrison town of Mülhausen, or Mulhouse.\n\nAt 2 August 1914 the first French and German soldiers were killed in this sector, near Joncherey and Faverois.\n\nAt 19 August 1914 the French Army lost even his first general on the battlefield. More to the north, between Flaxlanden en Zillisheim, General Plessier of the 97e Régiment Alpine, from Chambéry, Savoie, died during the first hostilities.\n\nThe Opponents - The German units\n\nIn German Mülhausen the “state of alertness” was declared on 31 July 31 1914. In Mülhausen was stationed the garrison of the 58th infantry brigade (112th and 142nd regiment), the 22nd Cavalry Regiment and the 5th regiment of mounted riflemen (Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 5 der Königlich Preußischen Armee). (Remember this unit for later). All these troops were part of the XIV Army corps of Baden, which belonged to the 7th German Army under command of General von Heeringen.\n\nOn 31 July 1914 the 142nd Infantry Regiment occupied with outposts the area along the line Cernay (Sennheim), southward to Dannemarie (Dammerkirch), and the Swiss border. The cavalry regiments and mounted riflemen reinforced the customs officials and patrolled in this border area.\n\nThe French units\n\nAround Belfort General Bonneau commanded the French 7th Army Corps, consisting of the 14th and 41st Infantry Division, reinforced by the 8th Cavalry Division. The 7th Army Corps belonged to the 1st French Army of General Dubail with his headquarters at Epinal.\n\nAccording to the French Plan XVII the original mission of the 7th Army Corps was to cover the mobilization of the fortress of Belfort, the railroads to Paris, and the high passes of the Vosges. Bonneau positioned the 41st Infantry Division in the Northern and Central Vosges, the 14th Infantry Division under command of General Curé between the Vosges mountain chain and the Rhine-Rhône channel, the 8th Cavalry Division plus a battalion of the 44th Infantry Regiment under command of General Aubier between the Rhine-Rhône channel and the Swiss border.\n\nThe Swiss Army\n\nIn those early war days neutral Switzerland felt also threatened. Swiss Territorial units occupied the border positions on 1 August 1914. The Swiss Army was mobilized on 3 August 1914. The army occupied and guarded the northern and western borders. The Swiss had good reasons for harbouring suspicions against their neighbours. Afterwards historians detected Joffre’s “Plan H”. “H” stands here for (Confederatio) \"Helvetica\" (CH). In case the Swiss should have taken sides in one way or another with Germany, Joffre would have deployed Plan H to attack and occupy western parts of Switzerland.\n\n2 and 3 August 1914 - Border violations and skirmishes\n\nOn 2 August there were already some incidents along the Sundgau border. These were still limited skirmishes between custom officers, infanterists, and cavalrists, scouting the other side of the frontier. These incidents happened in the Sundgau sector along a line of Romagny southward to Delle. At the village of Reppe the French even made a German cavalrist prisoner of war, a horseman of the 22nd Regiment of Dragoons. One skirmish ended with the killing of the first soldiers of the Great War, Caporal Peugeot and Leutnant Mayer, along the road from Faverois to Joncherey. On 3 August there were similar incidents in this sector.\n\nThe Battle for Mulhouse\n\nOn 7 August 1914 General Bonneau launched his 7th Army Corps to attack Altkirch. The next day, on the 8th, the French attacked and occupied Mulhouse without any opposition, because the German troops had left the town before. With the arrival of German reserves from Strasbourg, the Germans launched on 9 August a counter-attack at nearby Cernay. On the same day Bonneau began a slow withdrawal, forced by the absence of reserves of his own, and unable to mount a concentrated defence.\n\nJoffre hastily despatched a reserve division to reinforce the defence. The division arrived too late to save the town from recapture. On 10 August Bonneau retreated on Belfort in order to escape German encirclement. Joffre promptly fired Bonneau of his command and send him to Limoges. Recognising the high amount of casualties, Joffre added four more divisions to the “Army of Alsace”', and placed it under the command of General Pau.\n\nBy foot it is less than 2 km from the artillery base to the German cemetery. We prefer to go by car from Zillisheim southward to the Illfurth Deutscher Soldatenfriedhof.\n\nThe Illfurth Deutscher Soldatenfriedhof contains the graves of 1.964 German soldiers and officers, fallen during the Great War. 1.426 of these soldiers rest in individual graves, 7 of them are unknown; 539 soldiers rest in a mass grave, of whom 520 are unknown.\n\nThe cemetery itself is of April 1920. The soldiers, buried here, were originally buried elsewhere; in 64 other, sometimes improvised, war cemeteries in the Sundgau region. During the years 1920-1924 their corpses have been brought over to Illfurth cemetery.\n\nSome of the unit memorials on the cemetery are also transported from former wartime cemeteries.\n\nThe cemetery is located at a rather steep slope of a hill.\n\nWe start at the foot of the hill with some graves of officers and soldiers, ...\n\n... fallen in the Sundgau during the first days of the war, and during the Battle of Mulhouse.\n\nThere also graves of the later war years until 1918. Two graves of construction battalion soldiers, of resp. 1917 and 1918.\n\nA memorial to commemorate the Bavarian Landwehr Infanterie Regiment 15 (B.L.I.R. 15).\n\nMore upward the hill: more graves of 1914 to 1918.\n\nThere is also a private memorial for Fritz Baer.\n\nA Pionier and a Landsturmmann share this grave.\n\nOn the top of the hill of the cemetery lies the mass grave, overlooked by the Imperial Eagle of the memorial for the aviators.\n\nThere are only two bronze tiles commemorating 539 soldiers.\n\nOn this mass grave an exceptional short list of 29 names.\n\nAn inscription on the side of the rear wall tells more names.\n\nNear the mass grave lies a quite remarkable grave.\n\nLater on this photo page we will visit the site of action of the fight of Leutnant Mayer and Caporal Peugeot, and we will investigate this incident in more detail.\n\nWe continue studying the \"Illfurth Fliegerdenkmal\". Originally this aviators memorial of the Imperial Eagle was located at Habsheim, south-east of Mulhouse.\n\nThe bronze plaque of the \"Illfurth Fliegerdenkmal\" tells us:\n\n\"HERE REST THE ON 18 MARCH 1916 FALLEN TEAM OF AN AIRPLANE OF THE \"FLIEGER ABTEILUNG 48\".\n\nWALTHER KURT - RESERVE SECOND LIEUTENANT\n\nFRITZ HOPFGARTEN- DEPUTY OFFICER\n\nMAX WALLAT - STAFF SERGEANT\n\nTHEY DIED ON THIS LOCATION (Remember: Habsheim!) AFTER A HEROIC AIR COMBAT AGAINST A FRENCH SQUADRON TOGETHER WITH THEIR OPPONENTS\n\nERECTED BY THEIR COMRADES APRIL 1916\"\n\nWith a last view at the aviators memorial we leave the Illfurth cemetery...\n\n... to continue southward to Tagsdorf.\n\nIn a private backyard, behind a fence, we locate this third line 1918 Bunker.\n\nA teleview through the fence tells us more about it's constructors.\n\nThis is the only relic of the \"Pionierpark Tagsdorf\", ...\n\n... a complex for storage of construction material and explosives.\n\nWe continue south-westward to the front sector of the valley of the Largue river, and the road from Hirtzbach to Largitzen.\n\nIn the \"Schutzenwald\", about 1.500 m. before we enter the village of Largitzen, we park our car safely at the Aire de Picnic at the west side of the road, ...\n\n... we walk some 100 m. southward, and we spot at the eastern side of the road this German bunker.\n\nBefore we cross the road to explore further, some concise information about the Largue front sector.\n\nSundgau - August - September 1914\n\nThe French period colour photos in this frame give us an impression of the French positions near Hirtzbach and Largitzen in 1917. We are now only visiting some bunkers at the German side of the Largue front between Hirtzbach and Largitzen.\n\nAugust - September 1914\n\nOn 14 August 1914 the XIV Army Corps and the XV Army Corps were ordered back to Strasbourg, to be deployed elsewhere with the 7th German Army. These troops were replaced by an “Armeegruppe Gaede” of 5 reserve brigades under command of General Gaede, consisting of 21 infantry battalions, 5 cavalry squadrons, and 10 batteries of artillery.\n\nFrom 10 August General Pau commanded the 7th Army corps, which consisted of the 8th cavalry division and the 57th reserve division of Belfort, 3 extra reserve divisions, the 58th, 63rd, and 66th division, the 44th infantry division, and 5 battalions of Chasseurs Alpins. In total General Pau commanded about 150.000 men, called the “Armée d’Alsace” or “7th Army”.\n\nWhen the Germans retreated on 14 August, General Pau decided to pursuit them immediately, progressing between the Col de la Schlucht and the Swiss border. The advance was too slow and the French troops reached on the 18th only the line from Seppois northward to Dannemarie, Reiningue, and Munster.\n\nFor 19 August General Pau planned to attack in the north the city of Colmar, and in the south the town of Mulhouse. On 19 August the German 6th and 7th Armies in Alsace Lorraine stopped their retreat. On the 25th these armies started a counter offensive on Sarrebourg and Morhange, the Battle of the Haute Meurthe - Mortagne (25 August - 11 September 1914) against the French armies of General Dubail and General Castelnau.\n\n“Armeegruppe Gaede” attacked the 7th Army around Mulhouse. On the line Mulhouse – Altkirch, the troops were involved in very heavy fights. (General Gaede lost that day about 2.300 men and 24 artillery guns.)\n\nNorth of Mulhouse the French reached Wittenheim and Illzach and were able to occupy Mulhouse again. West of Colmar the French reached the village of Les Trois Epis on the 19th and, a day later, Turckheim near Colmar.\n\nThe 7th Army was in need of immediate re-enforcements. But at 24 August the “Armée de l’Alsace” had to give up again the town and the surroundings of Mulhouse. Joffre decided that the 7th Army had to give up and to retreat back to the ridges of the Vosges mountains.\n\nSeptember 1914\n\nAfter the French retreat from Mulhouse General Gaede forced in September 1914 the front line forward to a line from Altkirch, Seppois, to Mooslargue. During that period, especially from 9 until 11 September, there were many skirmishes and a serious fights between patrols in this sector.\n\nGeneral Rouquerol at his fortress in Belfort disposed of 70.000 men. During September 1914 these French units advanced again at a line from Cernay, Aspach, Michelbach, Dannemarie, Hirtzbach, Largitzen, and Pfetterhouse.\n\nFrom September 1914 the French troops were staying on German territory along the east bank of the Largue river, between Altkirch, Hirtzbach, Largitzen. Near Seppois the front crosses the Largue and runs southward at Pfetterhouse. From there the French were on the west bank, and the Germans were positioned at the east bank of the Largue. The front in this Largue sector, also called the Largue pocket, would consolidate in this situation until the end of the war.\n\nFrom the bunker east of the D 17, we cross the road to the west side. My late wife Christine ( + 08-05-2018) was the first to spot this by dense vegetation hidden bunker.\n\nWhen I approach it through the thicket, I then only understand, that Christine located the German \"Bismarck Bunker\" with it's remarkable battlements and decorations.\n\nThe inscription is probably a quote of the great German statesman, ...\n\n... \"The Iron Chancellor\", Graf Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898):\n\nThe damaged bas relief in the middle of the two inscriptions represents a portrait of Bismarck.\n\nThe constructors of the bunker left a damaged inscription:\n\nThis bunker has been constructed by a Company of the 110. Landwehr Infanterie Regiment of the 8. Landwehr Division.\n\nAs always, I am curious. So, I enter the bunker.\n\nA filled in tunnel to other underground rooms.\n\nView at the windows and the entrance.\n\nI have never seen before along the Western Front these peculiar, decorative battlements on a bunker.\n\nThe top structure of the bunker is overgrown.\n\nEven trees and their roots grow on top of the Bismarck bunker.\n\nIn 2010 I struggled through the impenetrable thicket, some 100 m. away to the east from the Bismarck Bunker, when I detected this overgrown bunker.\n\nI would not be surprised, if there is more German concrete, hidden in this wood. We continue southward to Mooslargue.\n\nBehind the village church of Mooslargue and the communal grave yard....\n\n... used to be a wartime Franco-German military cemetery.\n\nIn two languages the base of the crucifix tells us more about this site.\n\nAnother side of the base tells in French:\n\nMarble plaques hang in four niches with the names of the soldiers engraved.\n\nThe crucifix is also commemorating two civilian victims, killed by the explosion of a shell, and buried here; a 46 year old school teacher, and a 13 year old girl.\n\nFrom Mooslargue we make a huge jump westward to Etupes...\n\n... to follow next the Franco-Swiss border back to the east.\n\nCaporal Jules André Peugeot\n\nNext we will visit three sites, which are connected to the death of Caporal Peugeot, opponent of Leutnant Mayer, and the first killed French soldier of the Great War. We will visit his grave at Etupes, his memorial at Joncherey, and the site of the killing, as I have concluded it from my sources.\n\nEtupes\n\nAt the communal cemetery of Etupes we visit at the modest military plot the grave Caporal Peugeot.\n\nRight of the Caporal are buried an Adjudant Chef of the 35e R.I., and two privates, resp. of the 172e R.I. and the 22e R.I.\n\nThe grave of the first killed French soldier of the Great War: Caporal Jules André Peugeot.\n\nPlot 4, grave 181.\n\nDid Caporal Peugeot really kill Leutnant Mayer?\n\nThe historian Hanotaux and the war journal of the 2nd Battalion of the 44e R.I. tell us each a different story about the dead of Leutnant Mayer and Caporal Peugeot.\n\nAccording to Hanotaux’s official French history Leutnant Mayer was hit by a rifle shot in the head, after he managed to hit the head of a soldier with his sword. Mayer and his 7 Jäger zu Pferde of the 3rd Battalion of the Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 5 crossed the border to patrol and to scout the area. They attacked the post of Caporal Peugeot. Peugeot was deadly wounded, but he still managed to fire his rifle \"at short range\" and killed Leutnant Mayer. Soon afterwards Peugeot died himself.\n\nSo, in this “official” version Hanotaux tells us that Caporal Peugot killed Leutnant Mayer.\n\nThe Journal des Marches et des Opérations of the 2nd Battalion of the 44th Infantry Regiment (44e R.I.) tells us another story about the location and the dead of Caporal Peugeot and Leutnant Mayer on 2 August 1914:\n\n“Some minutes before 10 o’clock in the morning, four men of the 6th Company under command of Caporal Peugeot set up a post along the route from Joncherey to Faverois. At about 800 m. east from this location the unit is attacked by a German patrol of Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 5 from Mulhouse, consisting of one Second Lieutenant (Second Lieutenant Mayer) and 7 men.\n\nCaporal Peugeot is killed by a revolver shot by the chief of the patrol, on whom he fired, but did miss. The (men of the) post and also the post next to it did hear the rifle shots, and start to fire at the horsemen, who try to spread out, and they kill the Lieutenant, chief of the patrol, and 2 horses. One horseman is wounded and two others are made prisoner. The post, which was set up at a barricade at the east exit of the village of Joncherey along the route to Faverois, opens, alarmed by the rifle shots at this post, equally fire at the enemy patrol, which disappears.”\n\nIn the version of this French war journal Peugeot fired a shot at Mayer, but missed. It was Leutnant Mayer, who killed Caporal Peugeot with a revolver shot. Other soldiers of the 44e R.I. killed some moments later Mayer.\n\nPeugeot was the first soldier, killed in the Great War. Mayer was the second soldier, but still being the first killed German soldier. Anyway, French after war mythology or not, Caporal Peugeot still shares the disputable honour of the German Leutnant Mayer to be the first and French fallen soldier of the Great War.\n\nFrom Peugeot's grave we continue eastward to Joncherey ...\n\n... to visit his memorial and the site of action.\n\nFirst we visit the Caporal Peugeot Memorial.\n\nThe same text as on Peugeot's grave, here in capitals, and also the claim, that it happened here.\n\nThis memorial for Caporal Peugeot, erected in 1959, is the second memorial. The first memorial, erected in 1922, has been destroyed on 24 July 1940 by German troops.\n\nThough the memorial claims that Peugeot fell here, I am going to a field behind the memorial to look for the site of action.\n\nSite of Action - Peugeot versus Mayer\n\nI have several reasons to doubt the claim of the memorial text about the exact location of the fight between Mayer and Peugeot. Many times I experienced that the inscriptions on memorials are often not correct, and that the location of a memorial has been chosen for more practical than for correct historical reasons. The main reason for me to look somewhere else for this particular site is the rather precise quote of the war journal of the 44e R.I.:\n\n\"At about 800 m. east from this location (the border post at the edge of the village) the unit is attacked by a German patrol of Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 5 from Mulhouse, consisting of one Second Lieutenant (Second Lieutenant Mayer) and 7 men.\"\n\nConsidering the increase over the years of the built-up area of the village, I made an estimation of these mentioned 800 meters. I do realise that I am also not exact, but I conclude that this first deadly fight happened somewhere in this field, east of the memorial. From the south I made 5 photos of this field, where to my opinion the fight between Mayer and Peugeot must have happened. The overlapping photos start westward and continue clockwise to the east.\n\nFive overlapping photos of the Site of Action of the fight of Peugeot and Mayer.\n\nFrom Joncherey we continue via Réchésy to the location, where the former borders of three states met each other.\n\nThe village of Réchésy.\n\nBefore we continue: some concise background information about Réchésy and Pfetterhouse.\n\nRéchésy and Pfetterhouse\n\nBefore August 1914 Réchésy was a French village, and Pfetterhouse was a German village; Pfetterhausen. The Franco-German border lied in between these villages. The three borders of Switzerland, Germany, and France did meet together half way Réchésy and Pfetterhausen.\n\nRéchésy - The intelligence service of Pierre Bucher\n\nDocteur Pierre Bucher (1869-1921) was a patriotic, French medical doctor, born in Guebwiller. On 30 July 1914 he escaped from an imminent German arrest and fled to Switzerland. The Germans condemned him to death for desertion and treason. On 4 August, after the declaration of war, Bucher returned to France and enlisted in the army. Some few weeks later he was detached to the intelligence service of the general staff of General Pau.\n\nDocteur Pierre Bucher set up a military intelligence centre in a villa at the outskirts of the village of Réchésy, called the “Académy de Réchésy”, a few hundred meters away from the three borders location. Bucher’s staff observed and reported not only the military operations and troop movements of the German army units, but they also eagerly collected intelligence about the movements of the Swiss army units along the border. Pierre Bucher was awarded for his services with the decoration of the Légion d’Honneur.\n\nPfetterhouse - August 1914\n\nAlready on 7 August 1914, during General Bonneau’s first attack on Mulhouse, about 400 infantry and cavalry soldiers under command of Dragoon Sergeant Grünfelder attacked successfully the German units at Pfetterhouse. That day the French counted four dead. The Swiss authorities immediately closed down the frontier.\n\nIn spite of two following retreats the French were later able to hold the position east of Pfetterhouse on to the west bank of the Largue river. From October 1914 the 55e Régiment d’Infanterie Territoriale (55e R.I.T.) under command of Commandant Fleutiaux occupied the area around Pfetterhouse. From the end of December 1914 the 55e R.I.T. mainly occupied the west bank of the Largue. The German soldiers were positioned at the east bank of the Largue.\n\nDuring the war years skirmishes and bombardments would go on in this sector. In February 1916 Pfetterhouse and surroundings even suffered a German artillery bombardment, which lasted for more than a week. During these bombardments the population of the village has been evacuated to Montbéliard. In spite of these violent events the End of Western Front near Pfetterhouse would freeze in the same situation until 1918, as it was in December 1914.\n\nDeparting from Réchésy we are going eastward, along the D 20. After some 1.300 m there is a sign, designed in a colourful Hansi-style, which directs to the right, to a muddy track, which leads south-westward into the woods to the Borne des Trois Puissances, or the Boundary Stone of the Three Powers.\n\nRené made this photo from the French territory. \"RF\" stands for République Française. The left, rather rough stone is a relic of a border stone of the Habsburg period.\n\nA view from the Swiss side of the frontier. \"C S\" stands for Confederation Suisse, and \"D\" stands for Deutschland or Germany.\n\nChristine and I continue eastward along the D 24. In the village of Pfetterhouse we turn left, at the D 10 bis, and go southward to the Franco-Swiss frontier post and customs office.\n\nBy many this location is considered as the end of the Western Front.\n\nBut in fact it is not the exact southern end of the Western Front.\n\nA view from the border to the outskirts of Pfetterhouse.\n\nWe leave Pfetterhouse and continue eastward along the D 24.\n\nAbout 500 m. outside the village is a track leading southward.\n\nWe go on by foot along the track, that touches the edge of the \"Bannholz\" wood.\n\nJust as a reminder: again the situation map.\n\nI have to struggle southward in quite a densely vegetated wood. After a while I detect the French \"Villa Agathe\" Bunker.\n\nThe rear side of the last French bunker of the Western Front with the entrance.\n\nRené measured the bunker precisely and made this ground plan.\n\nThe rear side, photographed from the west.\n\nThe staircase at the entrance.\n\nThe northern wall.\n\nThe fire windows facing the north.\n\nWith a last view at the field before the Bannholz wood, ...\n\n... we continue to the location, which I consider as the proper, southern end of the Western Front: the last bridge, before the Swiss border, over the river Largue.\n\nWe cross the Largue to the German frontline.\n\nI show this 1936 utility house, at the east bank, just as an important landmark for fellow front-travellers.\n\nThe Germans possessed the east bank of the Largue. About 15 m. next to the utility house, ...\n\n... a German observation bunker,...\n\n... with it's top blown off.\n\nWe cross the road and in the wood we detect traces of trenches.\n\nOn the southern side of the road, a machine-gun bunker.\n\nWe are here only a few hundred meters away from the Swiss border.\n\nThe fire openings facing westward across the Largue.\n\n... connected to another machine-gun bunker.\n\nA look inside.\n\nThe three fire windows, south-. west-, and northward.\n\nThe same bunker, on the outside, facing the west.\n\nLast view of the last German bunkers of the Western Front. In the background the other machine-gun bunker.\n\nOn the next photo page we explore another site in the Sundgau: the Bunker Path of Burnhaupt-le-Bas."
