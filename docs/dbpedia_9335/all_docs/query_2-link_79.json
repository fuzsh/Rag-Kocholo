However, please note that it can be crowded.\n\nFRANKIE LARSON\n\nThe Cultural German and France influence\n\nEver heard of this place called Strasbourg, I'm as confused as it is where some say its German some say its France but for a fact this place is a city in France where it has some influence of the German architrave culture. The Iconic place in strasbourg is the Notre Dame Catherdral located at 6 parvis notre dame, 75004 Paris where this is a medieval catholic cathedral dedicated to the Virgin mary. The cathedral itself looks marvelous, somewhat you see in the movies but sadly it isn't open due to some fire happened sometime again and it's in restoration. But still you are able to admire the building from the outside, especially the colourful glass tainted windows. Also the city of Strasbourg has many medieval buildings and its a sight to see. Lastly, do not forget to visit L'atelier 116 located at 116 grand rule, 67000 strasbourg where they serve amazing breakfast, basically this is a artisans bakery and passtierie where its made and baked on site. Well, it's France isn't it, this is the motherland of all pastries! #fallingforfall #pastries #foodie #france #notredame #iconic #unesco #worldheritage #cathedral #scenic #strasbourg\n\nfallingforfall\n\npastries\n\nKinnie Kong\n\nA French fairy tale town, it's like stepping into Howl's Moving Castle\n\n✨A French fairy tale town, it's like stepping into Howl's Moving Castle✨ 🪄When you see the town in this picture, do you feel a sense of déjà vu? If you are familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's work 'Howl's Moving Castle', then this scene will not be unfamiliar to you😉. Remember when Sophie was walking alone on the path, being teased by two soldiers, and Howl descended from the sky like a hero🕺, with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a cloak, appearing beside Sophie. He took Sophie dancing in the air above the town, lightly stepping over the rooftops, overlooking the entire town, everything was dreamily beautiful💕. 👧The most impressive to me was the scene where they danced in the air🎈, those rows of pointed timber-framed houses, scattered in an orderly fashion, looking down from above, both romantic and spectacular🎆. And this scene is not a figment of Grandpa Miyazaki's imagination, its prototype is the town of Colmar on the Alsace Wine Route in France! Compare the pictures, isn't it almost identical😲! Those timber-framed houses are just like two peas in a pod! Here, it seems that you can see Howl carrying Sophie flying over the rooftops🕊️! 🏡Over the past millennium, the Alsace region has changed hands between France and Germany several times, its history is an epic of German-French contradictions and integration📚. Speaking of Alsace, does it feel familiar to you🤔? Let's read the text below together and see if it can evoke fragments of your memory📃: 'After the grammar lesson, we started the handwriting class📝. That day, Mr. Hamel gave us new copybooks, all with beautiful round script: 'France' 'Alsace' 'France' 'Alsace'. These copybooks hung on the iron rods of our desks, like many small national flags fluttering in the classroom🚩. Everyone was so focused, the classroom was unbelievably quiet🎵!' 'The Last Lesson' cast a melancholic and solemn hue over Alsace😢. But in fact, before the 17th century, the Alsace region belonged to the Holy Roman Empire (the predecessor of Germany), and people mainly spoke German📄. After the famous Thirty Years' War in Europe, Alsace came under French rule. And in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, France was defeated, and Alsace belonged to Prussia, until Germany was defeated in World War II, Alsace returned to the arms of France💪, and formed the current border between the two countries along the Rhine River🗺️. 📖If cities can also be mixed-race, then Colmar is undoubtedly a beautiful town with German-French mixed blood🌸. Carefully calculated, this place belonged to Germany for a longer time than it belonged to France. This also explains why Colmar's architectural style is full of Germanic charm🏰, those timber-framed houses and the magnificent Gothic churches with pointed spires all bear strong Germanic marks🎨, as well as many street names with German suffixes and the dialect mixed with German and French, all have a reasonable explanation🤝. ✨Colmar also has many attractions worth visiting🎡, such as the Little Venice area, where the waterways crisscross, and the colorful timber-framed houses are reflected in the water, picturesque🖼️; there is also the Unterlinden Museum, which displays the rich history and culture of the Alsace region📜; and the Saint Martin Church, whose towering spires and exquisite carvings are awe-inspiring👏. Come to Colmar and experience the unique charm of this fairy tale town💖!\n\nAiden.Roberts@63\n\nFrance 🇫🇷 have another Romantic Town named Colmar.\n\n#francetrip Different from the scenery of big cities in Europe, the small town of Colmar in France is more like a mini fairy tale world. This is the place where Sophie and Hal meet in Hayao Miyazaki's Moving Castle, and the hometown of Baltoldi, the author of the Statue of Liberty. The architectural soul of the whole town is a wooden house built in the 17th and 18th centuries. Cut the wood neatly and build it into a wooden frame. The connection of the wooden strips does not need a nail. After setting up the shelf, the mixture of soil and grass stem is filled into the wall. Finally, the wall is coated with bright colours such as pink, grass green, sky blue, jujube red, etc., which has both the beauty of German lines and the unique romantic colours of France. The brightly coloured wooden tendon house is like a palette next to the clear river. Because it is very watery, the southeast corner is called \"Xiaowei\" Nice. In Little Venice, people living here seem to have a natural preference for flowers. Every small bridge, every dock, and every family near the river bank are decorated with flowers. Locals use a flatboat similar to a Venetian gondola as a means of transportation, which is located next to the canal.\n\nfrancetrip\n\nHazirk\n\nColmar, France | A fairy tale of a small town at sunset\n\n| A fairy tale of a small town at sunset. The soft twilight light spills over the buildings of Colmar, enveloping the entire town in the fairy tale of the setting sun. Strolling through the narrow streets, the unique romantic charm of the town of Colmar hits you in the face. After nightfall, Colmar becomes even more enchanting. The nights here are not silent, with music performances often taking place in the squares. Walking to the canal side, with small bridges over flowing water, the lights reflect warmly in the clear water, forming a warm reflection that flows into the fairy tale of the century. Photo-worthy spots: Bistrot des Lavandières, the filming location of 'A Bite of China 2'②Little Venice Not far from the Chinese restaurant, boasting beautiful riverside views, personally I find it more beautiful than Venice.3 Colmar Old Town The old town has many Alsatian-style 'half-timbered houses', all very photogenic! 4 Maison Pfister The inspiration for 'Howl's Moving Castle', and also the reason many people visit Colmar. 5 Fishmonger's Dock quai de la poissonnerie6 Brasserie des Tanneurs 7 Bartholdi Museum Musée Bartholdi ColmarLittleVenice\n\nMALCOLM RYAN\n\nStrasbourg, France: The Heart of Europe, the Capital of Christmas\n\nStrasbourg, located in eastern France, is the capital of the Alsace region and the seat of the European Parliament.

Come to Colmar and experience the unique charm of this fairy tale town💖!\n\nAiden.Roberts@63\n\nThe French town of Colmar—the birthplace of the Statue of Liberty\n\nColmar is very close to Eguisheim and is an ancient town near the French-German border. The main color tone of this town is the picturesque half-timbered houses, complemented by canal waterscapes, ancient stone arch bridges, and modern iron bridges, all of which are quite remarkable. More notably, an outstanding sculptor was born here, who sculpted the Statue of Liberty in New York, making it the birthplace of the Statue of Liberty. The rich artistic atmosphere and profound cultural heritage inject immortal vitality into this town. Riding a sightseeing train through the streets and alleys of the town feels like entering a fairy tale world untouched by the mundane. The quaint colorful buildings, oddly shaped multi-sloped roofs, majestic churches, castles from Miyazaki's films, exquisite old customs houses, and ancient museums... A narrow canal runs through the town, reflecting its colors on the water surface. The ripples created by flower boats, the occasional falling petals from window displays, all add a touch of delicacy and liveliness to the town. Still unsatisfied, I got off the train and walked along the canal, finally finding the town's earthly charm at the riverside market, with seafood condiments, fruit and vegetable snacks, bread, ice cream... and the friendliness and enthusiasm in people's eyes.\n\nCE. Zach 27\n\nHayao Miyazaki's animation \"Howl's Moving Castle\" - Colmar\n\nOn July 12, I rested in the room for a day, probably because I walked too much and my feet hurt. On July 13, the 25th day of the European trip, the weather was clear and the temperature was over 20 degrees. I took a train from Strasbourg to Colmar. Colmar is a city in Alsace, northeastern France, and the capital of the Haut-Rhin department. Colmar is also known as the \"Venice of France\". The environment there is beautiful, and the rustic Alsatian style is perfectly preserved. The \"half-timbered houses\" are like fairy tale cottages, the red and black Alsatian national costumes, the practical and beautiful Alsatian pottery, the simple Alsatian stew, the small bridges and flowing water, and the clusters of flowers make people linger. The scenes in Hayao Miyazaki's animation \"Howl's Moving Castle\" were designed based on Colmar. This is one of the most romantic areas, named for its canals and flower boats. The town is full of small wooden houses with Alsatian characteristics, with a unique fairy tale color. Colmar is also the hometown of Bartholdi, the author of the Statue of Liberty in New York. At the roundabout in Colmar, there is a small Statue of Liberty standing, and you can look at the goddess up close from the bus.\n\njasminda_6679"
