        "text": "Located to the south of the Alsace wine region of France, Haut-Rhin is a picturesque place with medieval villages and beautiful vineyards. The ‘’Haut’’ in its name means ‘’Upper’’, which perfectly explains its hilly location. Traditionally, Haut-Rhin wine region is home to the best wines in the province and proudly continues wine-making traditions. Especially, it is very famous for its elegant white wines.\n\nDiscover Wine Tastings and Tours in Haut-Rhin!\n\nWhere is Haut-Rhin wine region located?\n\nHaut-Rhin is located in the Alsace region, bordered by the Territory de Belfort and Vosges departments. This region can be found on the eastern side of France along the Rhine River, which separates France and Germany. Haut-Rhin wine region is bordered by the Vosges Mountains to the west, the Bas-Rhin department to the North, Switzerland to the south, and the Rhine River to the east. This region is divided into 6 districts, 31 towns, and 377 municipalities.\n\nThe History of Haut-Rhin wine region\n\nHaut-Rhin is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. At that time, it was divided into three districts: Belfort, Altkirch, and Colmar. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the three districts were changed into five: Colmar, Altkirch, Belfort, Delémont, and Porrentruy. The arrondissements Delémont and Porrentruy were eliminated in 1814 and transferred to Switzerland. The subprefecture of Altkirch was moved to Mulhouse in 1857. Later in 1871, the Haut-Rhin department became part of Germany, except for a part that forms the Territory de Belfort.\n\nIn 1919, Haut-Rhin's territory became part of France again. Nowadays, the Haut-Rhin wine region is managed by the Departmental Council of Haut-Rhin in Colmar.\n\nUnique terroir of Haut-Rhin wine region\n\nAn eventful geological past provided unique soils to appear in the Haut-Rhin region. Around 150 million years ago, the sea rolled over what today corresponds to the Rhine Rift Valley. Numerous rocks such as sandstone, limestone, and marl came to locate atop the platform. Around 50 million years ago, the Rhineland mountain collapsed slowly and created the Rhine Plain. These successive collapses contributed to intensely renewing and separating all the geological zones.\n\nFinally, three geological units stood out in this region: the Vosges mountains, the sub-Vosges hills boasting a wide range of soil diversity, and the Rhine alluvial plain.\n\nVolcanic-sedimentary soils\n\nOver 300 million years ago, volcanoes produced ashes that became solid underwater. These dark, stony terroirs retain the heat and sublimate the grape varieties. This kind of soil produces intense and full-bodied wine with a smoky aroma.\n\nSandstone soils\n\nSandstone is compacted quartz sand. Geologically it is close to granite terroirs that have the same acidic and sandy character. The wines produced there have firmness and are less aromatic.\n\nLimestone-sandstone soils\n\nThe Haut-Rhin hills have clay, limestone, and sandstone soils. It’s the rock variety that creates the mineral resources. So, this territory is very fertile and boasts a great water-storing capacity. The limestone and sandstone lighten up the soil.\n\nClayey-marl soils\n\nClay is the primary component that produces heavy and fatty soils. Wines from this terroir have a weighty structure and need time to expose aromas. Because of the clay-dominated soil, the taste of tannin is common even in white wines.\n\nWhat are the Grape varieties in Haut-Rhin?\n\nThe diversity of the soil has led to the creation of the best environment for different varieties of grapes. The mix of minerals and composition of soils contribute to marvelous layers of flavors in Haut-Rhin wines. The slope faces south and southeast, giving the grapes great exposure to the sun, and providing good drainage. The four “noble” grapes of Alsace—Riesling, Pinot Gris, Muscat, and Gewürztraminer—occupy the premier sites and are, with minor exceptions, the only grapes planted in the region’s grand cru vineyards. Out of 51 official grand crus, 33 are located in the Haut-Rhin area.\n\nPinot Gris grape achieves the richest expression, with spicy qualities and a frame of good acidity. Muscat dhows fragrant floral notes, and Gewürztraminer tends towards sweet spices, rose petals, and tropical fruit. Both are low in acidity, but Gewürztraminer is higher in alcohol. New oak is usually not a factor in the vinification of these varieties, although some producers use large neutral casks for fermentation and ageing.\n\nGenerally, the best wines originate in the Haut-Rhin, and over two-thirds of Alsace’s Grand Cru vineyards are located in the department.\n\nFood to pair with Haut-Rhin wine\n\nTarte Flambée\n\nTarte Flambée is a thin, crispy, rectangular flatbread that is topped with tart and spreadable cheese, créme fraîche, crispy bacon, and thinly sliced roasted onions. A pinch of salt, ground pepper, peanut oil, and nutmeg add extra layers of flavour to this beloved snack.\n\nTarte flambée is known as flammeküche in Germany and takes its name from the fact that it is baked in proximity to hot embers in an oven. Tarte flambée pairs perfectly with Haut-Rhin dry white wines and local beers.\n\nPot-au-feu\n\nPot-au-feu is a French dish with boiled meat and vegetables. However, it is not as simple as it might appear at first glance. Pot-au-feu, French for “pot on the fire”, is one of the oldest French provincial winter dishes.\n\nIt was originally made over an open fire with cheap, inferior cuts of meat, vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, onions, leeks, and turnips. The use of tough cuts of meat and low cooking temperature means a long cooking time to make the meat tender, sometimes even an entire day.\n\nWith its unique aromas and juicy, tender meat, a serving of pot-au-feu paired with a glass of Haut-Rhin red wine is an authentic experience.\n\nCoq au Riesling\n\nCoq au Riesling is an Alsatian version of the classic coq au vin. This dish consists of chicken, mushrooms, onion, lardons, and dry Riesling wine from Alsace, recognized as one of the best wines in the world.\n\nIt is said that the dish is even better when rewarmed the next day due to the flavors that develop when left in the fridge overnight. The chicken can be served over egg noodles, boiled potatoes, or the more traditional spätzle, making for a great comfort dish, especially on a cold winter's night. You should taste this dish with a glass of Haut-Rhin wine.\n\nTop 3 places to visit near Haut-Rhin wine region\n\nColmar\n\nColmar is a medieval town in the Haut-Rhin department to the south of the Alsace region.
