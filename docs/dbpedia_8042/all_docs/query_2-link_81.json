        "text": "Referred to by its artistic director Jan Hoet as the ‘documenta of locations’, documenta IX (1992) was a colossal show. Amid the art, an extensive public program – which included jazz, boxing, and baseball, among other events – pervaded the city of Kassel during its periodic stint as a ‘Museum of 100 Days’. Any attempt to view all that comprised documenta IX would have resulted in a grueling, disorienting experience for the visitor. There was 'almost everything available' for Hoet’s show, and this meant a cacophony of works so loud it could easily drown out the individual voices of the artists involved. But were the artworks subservient to documenta IX’s labyrinthine spectacle?\n\nEdited by Nanne Buurman & Dorothee Richter With contributions by Anna Sigrídur Arnar, Angela M. Bartholomew, Beatrice von Bismarck, Nanne Buurman, Kathryn M. Floyd, Anthony Gardner & Charles Green, Walter Grasskamp, Ayşe Güleç, Kristian Handberg, Dorothea von Hantelmann, Susanne König, Vesna Madžoski, Nina Möntmann, Philipp Oswalt, Dorothee Richter, Elpida Rikou & Eleana Yalouri, and Nora Sternfeld. On the occasion of documenta’s 14th edition, this special issue scrutinizes the ways in which the Kassel-based periodic exhibition has been contributing to curating the history of the present since its inception in 1955. From diverse perspectives, the authors engage with questions of how documenta’s iterations played a significant role not only in the making of a history of contemporary art but also in the canon of the relatively young field of curatorial and exhibition studies. Focusing on documenta’s engagement with artistic and broader cultural developments, as well as its implication in shifting socioeconomic and geopolitical contexts, the texts assembled in this issue touch upon documenta’s continuous dedication to instituting and reconfiguring the contemporary throughout its history. Its characteristic dedication to contemporaneity and institutional temporariness have continuously challenged researchers to reflect and revise their methodologies and epistemological foundations. Due to documenta’s specific character as a recurring large-scale exhibition with a relatively stable framework that has to be reinterpreted anew every five years, documenta’s potentials for mediating ideologies and power structures, notions of authorship and agency, as well as relations between the local and the global have furthermore fueled negotiations of the relationship of art and politics from the outset. The texts in this issue call attention to how it not only scripted paradigmatic models of subjectivity but also gradually widened its scope from a Eurocentric vision to a more worldly frame of reference, provoking reflections on its role in the globalization of the arts and its entanglement in (neo)colonial and (neo)liberal power relations in capitalism at large.\n\nThe Mostra della Pittura Italiana del Seicento e Settecento held in 1922 at the then Pitti Royal Palace (Florence) was the first in a series of exhibitions defining an art historical chronology, schools and the hierarchies of Baroque art, most of which are still valid to date. This exhibition was also the first to showcase a re-discovered Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) then presented akin to a revelation. The exhibition undoubtedly dealt with new readings of art history at face value but was also motivated by explicitly political overtones informed by the politics and international ambitions of the Kingdom of Italy. This paper explores the duality of the exhibitions’ complex narrative bridging politics and art history. It also reviews the genesis of 20th century Caravaggio studies and the ways and means how this was acknowledged within the Anglo-Saxon world of academia over time.\n\nEditors: Joana Baião (IHA/NOVA/FCSH; LAB-GM/CIMO/IPB), Leonor de Oliveira (IHA/NOVA/FCSH; Courtauld Institute of Art), Susana S. Martins (IHA/NOVA/FCSH) The latest issue of Revista de História da Arte critically addresses the “exhibition,” not just as an object of study, but mainly as a prolific and fruitful problem. The theme is explored here from various theoretical and methodological perspectives, underlining the vital importance of exhibitions for different interdisciplinary lines of research dealing with museums, art, culture and diplomacy. This issue features an interview with art historian Terry Smith, essays by Reesa Greenberg and Rémi Parcollet, and a themed dossier that incorporates different approaches related to the topic of exhibitions, including photography, catalog production, theoretical and critical analysis of contemporary practices, reassessment of historical shows, exhibitionary impacts in the writing of art history, the role of exhibitions in the retrieval and re-exhibition of works of art.

Martins (IHA/NOVA/FCSH)\n\nThe goal of this thesis is to look at the critical and dissenting value of exhibitions through the examination of four cases studies, based on six exhibitions taking place between 1968 and 1998 in Latin and North America. The exhibitions belong to the history of modern and contemporary exhibitions and curating, a field of research and study that has only started to be written about in the last two decades. This investigation contributes to it, in its creation of new genealogies by connecting previously overlooked antecedents, or by proposing new relations within established lineages, at the intersection of a specific historiography; to address exhibitions, a tradition of artists acting as curators and an emerging history of curating. The examined exhibitions were put together by artists or artist collectives and were placed in a liminal position between artistic and curatorial practice. All the cases presented a distinct proposal in relation to art and social change, a fact that connects them, in their aims and modus operandi, to a Marxist and neo-Marxist critical and transformative legacy. The cases address the following connections: exhibition as political site (Tucumán Arde, 1968); exhibition as social space (The People’s Choice (Arroz con Mango), 1981); exhibition as encounter (Rooms with a view, We the People, Art/Artifact, 1987-88); and exhibition as an exchange situation (El Museo de la Calle, 1998-2001).\n\nGuest editors: Dorothee Richter and Barnaby Drabble.

The reader presents a cross-section of the voices that populate the ongoing debate about, on the one hand, how and in what terms curating functions as a critical cultural practice, and on the other, what methodologies and histories exist with which we can critically analyse curatorial work today. This collection of essays was first published in 2007 by Revolver, in Frankfurt am Main and ICE, Institute for Curatorship and Education, Edinburgh College of Art as the first ICE Reader. Editor: Marianne Eigenheer Guest Editors: Barnaby Drabble and Dorothee Richter\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed a resurgence of performance art, causing a corresponding change in art institutional practices, and unprecedented curatorial discussions of the institutionalization and commercialization of this art form. In recent years, there has been a steep increase in the number of artists working with performance, broadening its definition to other disciplines such as dance, theater and music, and characterized by an emphasis for action within institutions and a total inclusion of the audience. By examining closely the artistic practice of artists such as Tino Sehgal and Marina Abramovic, the thesis will underline the main elements that enable museums, biennials and galleries to collect, conserve and sell contemporary performance. Precisely, this study will explore how contemporary artists have incorporated the notion of reproducibility within their works, which supports their institutionalization. In addition, it will investigate how the shifting role of institutions from places of contemplation to sites for active physical engagement has led to fundamental structural changes, and will demonstrate how the new performance format emerging in the 21st century fully embraces its institutionalization. By focusing on museums, biennials and galleries, this study will cover the three major types of art institution, and I will analyze their developing practices and strategies in relation to performance art."
