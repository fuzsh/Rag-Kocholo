        "text": "NEW YORK, USA – ZAZ10TS is delighted to announce the opening of HyperFaciality, a multimedia art exhibition by acclaimed international artist Michel Platnic. The exhibition will run from May 16 to September 20 at the ZAZ10TS Gallery, located at 10 Times Square, New York.\n\nHyperFaciality deals with identity and subjectivity through the lens of faciality, a concept coined by philosophers Deleuze and Guattari in their work, A Thousand Plateaus. Platnic's artistic exploration redefines the role of the face as a canvas, where the manipulation of facial features and expressions takes center stage. By engaging with the complexities of visual representation, Platnic challenges established norms and invites viewers to contemplate alternative forms of identity.\n\n\"According to Emmanuel Levinas, an ethical responsibility arises from the face-to-face encounter with another person, which disrupts our self-centeredness and calls upon us to acknowledge and respond to their humanity. I hope that my work can contribute to opening pathways for new encounters,\" says Michel Platnic\n\nPlatnic's unique approach involves restaging works by modern painters while honoring the original composition. Through reimagining iconic paintings primarily from the medium perspective, Platnic transcends the materiality of the subject matter, revealing new dimensions of essence and significance.\n\nThe exhibition at ZAZ10TS Gallery will showcase a diverse range of media, including fine-art pigment prints and living painting videos. Among the highlights are Platnic’s acclaimed series After Bacon, inspired by Francis Bacon’s work, as well as the After Egon Schiele series, which features reinterpretations of iconic pieces by Egon Schiele. Visitors will also have the opportunity to experience Platnic's latest creation, Garden Muse.\n\nThe video series of After Bacon can also be viewed on ZAZ Corner, a public LED billboard showcasing digital artwork outside the building at the corner of 41st Street and 7th Avenue.\n\n\"We're excited to present Michel Platnic's exhibition, HyperFaciality, at ZAZ10TS Gallery,\" shares Tzili Charney, Founder of ZAZ10TS. “We hope that Platnic's work sparks meaningful discussions on identity and subjectivity and leads to connection and understanding, particularly in times of division.” For more information about HyperFaciality please visit www.zaz10ts.com/hyperfaciality.\n\nAbout ZAZ10TS Gallery\n\nZAZ10TS is a cultural initiative that integrates art into the office building at 10 Times Square and showcases digital art on LED Billboards in Times Square.

I Wish I Had a River creates a painted garden within the confines of the lobby of 10 Times Square and will be on display from May 5th to August 31st.\n\n\"The Underground Lobby Garden\", as the artist calls it, is composed of paintings, drawings, laser cutouts, sculpture forms, and video projection. The artificial garden installation honors the original footprint as the city’s once major water source and celebrates the original architectural features of the building. Completed in 1930 as the Bricken Textile Building, the edifice was the center of the bustling garment district, dressed head to toe in Art Deco lines, patterns and adornments. Merely 40 years before its completion, New York’s biggest reservoir and supplier of all of Manhattan’s drinking water in the 19th century was decommissioned and torn down one avenue to the East.\n\nThis relationship between nature, particularly water, functioning as a cultural agent and an important element of consumerism is of particular importance for Anavy, who grew up in a desert region of conflict, where the resource was always scarce. The artworks are created through a process of dripping ink on submerged Mylar which requires the artist to relinquish control of the pigment to her water substrate for an unpredictable result that only nature can determine. Anavy’s paintings rely on water in the same way as the garden that the installation depicts. Without water, there is no life, this exhibition explores how those two elements intertwine and work together to hold memories, build gardens and shape our cities.\n\nThe exhibition also features I Wish I Had a River, a video based on Anavy's ink and colored pencil paintings on transparent Mylar and video footage she took at water channels in New York. It will be featured on ZAZ Corner’s In Between Programming, where the artwork is displayed for 15 seconds at a time on a large LED billboard in the heart of Times Square, all throughout May.\n\n“I see nature as a powerful tool to scrutinize issues of the dynamic relationships between nature, culture and sites. The idea for I Wish I Had a River has evolved following my interest in the connection between water and specific sites in New York City, which was built around water, as the New York Public Library, at the corner of West 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue stands atop the foundation stones of what use to be Murray Hill Reservoir. The exhibition turns the lobby space into an artificial pocket of nature in the heart of the island of Manhattan, and therefore ZAZ10TS is the perfect site for this exhibition” says Keren Anavy.\n\n“We are excited to open up slowly to have more visitors coming to the ZAZ10TS Gallery” says Tzili Charney, founder of ZAZ10TS. “And I love this site specific exhibition featuring water and nature, it feels right for the building and Times Square neighborhood now.”\n\nAbout Keren Anavy\n\nKeren Anavy (b. Israel) is a New York-based multimedia visual artist, working in drawing, painting, installation, and performance. She is a new member of The Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, the EFA Studio Program, New York City. Anavy was selected to be Guild House Artist-in-Residence in 2021 at Guild Hall of East Hampton, New York and at Marble House Project, Dorset, Vermont, where she will continue to create and explore water and garden-related issues. www.kerenanavy.com.\n\nAbout Lauren Powel\n\nLauren Powell (Detroit, MI, b. 1984) is a curator, art advisor, and contemporary art enthusiast who is deeply involved in both the NYC and LA art communities.

It presents over a thousand quotes from all over the US on monitors in Times Square; each quote comes from one-on-one interviews asking people to respond to the last year.\n\nThe rhythm of our lives has been interrupted, and we’ve started to see things differently as a result. At the beginning of the year, it was because of the COVID pandemic, then it was our reckoning with racial injustice and, most recently, political chaos because of the presidential election. In the midst of change, how do we move forward? What do we hold on to? How can our new perspective shape a better country? The defiant and vulnerable voices of a nation come together to suggest an answer in “We Respond 2020.”\n\nBased on an initial concept conceived by physician Marsha Gordon and Broadway producer Susan Gallin, artist Janaki Ranpura and theater director Katherine Wilkinson conducted over one-hundred and forty extended interviews throughout the year. From those, Ranpura and Wilkinson pulled quotes that express a range of deeply felt and sometimes humorous reactions. People express grief, and they also express growth. Many talk about ways they have changed and what they hope to bring forward into the future. They talk about vows made for their personal lives and fears for the planet. They share their feelings while on a journey through a new landscape.\n\nThis pandemic is lasting longer than we imagined, and we need stamina to stay optimistic in the months ahead. “We Respond 2020” is an art piece to help manage the difficult emotions we’re all experiencing in these times.\n\nAbout Eleni Giannopoulou\n\nEleni Giannopoulou (b. 1994, Greece) is a Greek sculptor and installation artist. A native of Thessaloniki and Crete, she studied at the Angel Academy of Art in Italy before receiving an MFA at the New York Academy of Art. In 2014, she won first prize in the Art Renewal Center International Scholarship competition.

She has also been awarded with the Chubb Fellowship from the New York Academy of Art. Her work has been exhibited in Florence, Miami, Toronto, New York, Mexico City, and Athens. She is currently living and working in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nAbout Tania Reza\n\nTania Reza (b. 1991, Mexico) is a Mexican Video Artist and Dancer.

Curated videos are interspersed between commercial messages every 2 minutes. Starting in September 2020, a new artist will be selected for the showcase each month.\n\nZAZ Corner, or as referred to by founder Tzili Charney as her “Artistic Mezuzah,” aims to engage the public with visuals that are different from the urban environment. With the launch of ZAZ Corner, ZAZ10TS is working with artists, organizations, universities, and cultural institutions to bring a wide selection of artwork to its digital billboard.\n\nThe “In Between” venue will kick off with artist Ben Hagari on September 1st with his pandemic inspired “About Face” video series. Ben Hagari is an award-winning artist whose artwork has been shown in prominent museums around the world. The “About Face” video project is shot entirely at home in New York City as the artist was isolated and stayed in place during the COVID 19 pandemic. The character, constrained by limited expression and space, continues to navigate daily routines. The faceless protagonist found new relevance with everyone around wearing masks, concealing their faces, and inevitably their facial expressions. The expressionless protagonist is shown from the back of his head which is shaved and a projected face void of all facial features. His wardrobe including footwear is worn with the front side on the back and all his movements are reversed.\n\n“The scenarios portray a mundane existence in a world whose marks have been erased. Books have no titles or words, photographs are blanked out, labels are removed; we are left with data. It generates a binary structure: backward and forward, front and rear, serious and funny,” says Ben Hagari.\n\nA new art installation by American artist Aaron Pexa, Garden Party interprets a modern garden theme with original multimedia artwork featuring flowers, birds and nature. Presented jointly by Cade Tompkins Projects and ZAZ10TS, the free public exhibition opens on March 5th and runs through May 25th at the ZAZ10TS lobby gallery located at 10 Times Square. Garden Party transforms the interior of the building’s lobby with neon and LED light sculptures as a nod to Times Square’s history of neon signage, accompanied by bright wallpapers, video and a large format print.\n\nThe long corridor of the lobby gallery includes a colorful floral Poppy wallpaper and video still artwork. Further down the corridor is a gold LED sculpture of a bird in flight layered over another colorful wallpaper entitled Garden Party, creating a stunning visual display. In the elevator bank, a black and white wallpaper and large scale collagraph in a silver leaf Rococo frame are illuminated by the Neon Poppy sculpture, all of which is repositioning how viewers experience color, light, and pattern.\n\nAaron Pexa’s video “I Wander the Forest in Search of Mystery” will run on a continuous loop. In it, a chandelier slowly twirls in a forest by a lake. The optic qualities of the cut crystal are activated by sunlight and enhanced by pastel atmospheres that move through the frame. The video highlights the incandescence of light and the reflective effect of glass as fleeting moments that create a fictional romantic history. The video is accompanied by a commissioned sound element created by artist Maralie, the fifth collaborative work with Aaron Pexa.\n\nThe video can also be viewed by the public as it runs on “ZAZ Corner,” a new LED billboard gallery showcasing digital artwork outside the building at the corner of 41st Street and 7th Avenue.\n\n“Times Square is famous for its sensational signage, evolving from neon-covered facades in the 1920s, to the modern day 25-story LED display. Through the many evolutions of this crossroads, it has always offered visitors a type of visual overstimulation with its over-the-top lights and advertisements. With this history in mind, the exhibition offers a respite from the flashing, quick-cut editing of the surrounding images. The video’s tranquil movements offer a calm counterpoint to the saturated, sumptuous commercial displays and the hustle of New York City,” says Cade Tompkins, representing Aaron Pexa.\n\n“We are excited to share this talented artist and unique exhibit that reflects the Times Square neighborhood” says Tzili Charney, founder of ZAZ10TS. “Aaron Pexa’s artwork brings beauty and nature to the building for all to enjoy.”\n\nZAZ10TS is an ongoing cultural initiative that integrates art into the office building at 10 Times Square.

Located at the corner of 41st Street and 7th Avenue in New York City, the billboard features a large LED, digitally activated screen that will be home to a new “ZAZ Corner” gallery bringing art and nature to the Times Square area.\n\nZAZ Corner will feature different artists and motifs on a monthly basis. ZAZ10TS kicks off the program in February with new media digital work based on a stylistic “nature” theme curated by Lightbox. The February program brings artistic greenery into the neighborhood and is designed to juxtapose the calming nature images with the surrounding concrete structures and hustle-bustle of Times Square.\n\n“The sounds and sights of Times Square can sometimes be overwhelming to the senses,” says Tzili Charney, founder of ZAZ10TS. “We want to offer a bit of respite and serenity with beautiful artwork featuring nature and springtime colors in the middle of the often-dreary winter season.”\n\n“Lightbox is thrilled partner with ZAZ10TS as we share a mutual interest in bringing our corner of the city to life and in turn, creating a space for talented digital artists to share their inspiring works,” adds Daphné Jouanneteau, CEO of Lightbox.\n\nLightbox, an experiential events venue with a digital art and tech programs, will draw upon its expertise to curate a unique editorial selection of new media digital artworks in collaboration with ZAZ10TS. Working with a mix of emerging and established digital artists, the captivating images will be brought to life on ZAZ Corner in a large LED screen.\n\nWith the launch of ZAZ corner, ZAZ10TS looks forward to working with artists, organizations, universities and cultural institutions to bring a wide selection artwork to the ZAZ corner Digital billboard and hopes to engage the public with visuals that are different from the urban environment in Times Square.\n\n“Art brings people together and we are thrilled to work with artists and partners to bring strikingly beautiful digital artwork to a public space and see the impact on the community” continues Limei Wang, director of ZAZ10TS.\n\nMedia Contact: Liz Ammirato liz@callprinc.com tel: 845-621-2005\n\nAn extraordinary collection of 1980s-1990s fashion slides found on a New York City sidewalk makes its way back to the Fashion District in a new photographic exhibition 10 Times Square: New York Fashion Rediscovered 1982-1997. Presented in the lobby gallery at 10 Times Square, also known as 1441 Broadway, former home to some of the most prominent designers in New York, the exhibition features captivating runway images of top fashion designers and supermodels from the 1980s and 1990s. The free public exhibition will open on September 5, 2019, to coincide with New York Fashion Week and will run through January 20, 2020.\n\nThe collection — a true treasure trove containing thousands of 35mm slides — was shot by Japanese photographer Kishimitsu Hada, and meticulously compiled by his mother, the late fashion journalist Yuriko Tomita. After a fire in Tomita’s apartment in 2008, dozens of boxes housing her professional archives ended up on the sidewalk. In a stroke of good luck, set designer Gaetane Bertol passed by and recognized the value of the contents of the boxes, rescued them, and guarded them until she was able to locate the owner. A decade later, curator and fashion historian Ya’ara Keydar worked to create this exhibit of photographs at ZAZ10TS -- a gallery conceived by Tzili Charney in 10 Times Square. Through these fortuitous connections, this exhibition reunites the designers featured in the photographs with their one-time workplace.\n\n“With the new exhibition, fashion comes full circle in returning to the Times Square district,” says Tzilli Charney, founder of the lobby gallery concept presenting art and culture to workers, visitors and the general public on an ongoing basis. “Remnants of fashion past become part of the present, imparting a sense of history and culture in terms of what once was known as the garment district of New York.”\n\n10 Times Square: New York Fashion Rediscovered 1982-1997 illustrates one of the brightest times in the history of New York fashion. Rapid economic growth in the 1980s ushered in an era of enthusiasm that revolutionized the fashion industry. Designers began creating high-quality day and eveningwear, in a more wearable style. Jeans and sportswear abounded, as well as -- for the growing presence of women in the workforce -- power-dressing with tailored suits and striking silhouettes. Fashion designers and supermodels achieved celebrity status, and finales became the most anticipated part of any runway show. The exciting and colorful finale celebrations of designers who worked in the building between 1982 and 1997, arm in arm with the leading supermodels of the time, are preserved in the joy-filled photographs in this collection.\n\nThe fashion stars featured in the photographs include designers Anna Sui, Donna Karan, Liz Claiborne, Ralph Lauren, Marc Jacobs, Perry Ellis, Isaac Mizrahi, Alber Elbaz, Anne Klein, Geoffrey Beene, Rebecca Moses, BCBG Max Azria, Linda Allard for Ellen Tracy, Adrienne Vittadini, and Gemma Kahng, and models Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Helena Christensen and Kristen McMenamy.\n\nThe 35mm slide format, a lost medium in photography, allows for the kind of large-scale reproductions that made this exhibition possible. The photographs selected for the exhibition took the interior design of the building into consideration as well, using only photographs that coordinate with the Art Deco black, white, grey and gold color scheme of the marble in the lobby.\n\n“These golden moments evoke a time just before the digital camera, smartphones, live streaming, fast fashion, and the transition from domestic to offshore garment manufacturing,“ says curator Ya’ara Keydar. “Fashion is an ever-changing industry. This exhibition is an invitation to pause and reflect on fashion through spontaneous moments of larger-than-life, unretouched beauty -- and absolute fun.”\n\nIn addition to the photographs on display, the exhibition will include a specially commissioned artwork by Gaetane Bertol. In keeping with the kismet of the project, the third member of the creative team is Tony Award-winning and world-renowned architect David Rockwell, founder of Rockwell Group. Ms. Bertol, a frequent member of David Rockwell’s scenic design team, mentioned the cache of slides and the upcoming exhibit during a casual conversation. She described the parallels between the storyline of Kinky Boots, the Rockwell-designed Broadway show about the revitalization of a shoe factory, and the metamorphosis of 1441 Broadway over the past 90 years and saw a connection to be celebrated. The result is an art installation featuring Mr. Rockwell’s original scale model for the Broadway show, where fashion meets theater. The piece is a playful nod to the ever-changing nature of both the Fashion and Theater districts, which 10 Times Square is a nexus of.\n\nFor more information about the exhibition, visit zaz10ts.com/nyfashionrediscovered.\n\nAbout ZAZ10TS Gallery\n\nZAZ10TS is an ongoing cultural initiative that integrates art into the office building at 10 Times Square.

Rivnay uses Acrylic, oil, polyurethane, and epoxy to create a diverse range of textures and compositions. In the process of creating the paintings Rivnay does not use traditional painting techniques or postures – his canvas is usually set lying down on the ground or on a table and the act of painting is dynamic and non-linear. The artist moves around the canvas, turning it in all directions until he reaches a final composition. For that reason, when hanging the works, there is no up or down, but rather a free and organic choice of how the work is presented on the wall.\n\nThis non-linear painting process refers without a doubt to our free from thinking process – relating both to our emotional body and a conceptual observation of the world around us. In order to reach a space where no rules apply, the artist connects to his own essence while he learns to let go of habitual artistic patterns. This juxtaposition between the known and the unknown, the habitual and the spontaneous opens up a path towards the essential.\n\nAmerican composer John Cage used “chance” to create sound, and in his book “Silence: Lectures and Writings” he stated: “As far as consistency of thought goes, I prefer inconsistency.” This is the beauty of the work, and the wonder of its evolution – there is no clear knowing of what comes next, yet there are forms that organically reappear.\n\nTitled “Nature of Wonder” the show provides a glimpse into obscurity, freedom, and a natural curiosity that we all experience in our creative lives. It is an opportunity to think, but also to let go of thinking. It is a pathway into joyous viewing and a simple understanding of how things work.\n\nShony Rivnay is an interdisciplinary Israeli-American artist based in Tel Aviv, Israel. He works in various media including painting, sculpture, video, installation, and performance. He has exhibited solo shows in numerous locations around the globe including SPRING/BREAK Art Fair (NYC), TEMP Art Space (NYC), Bosi Contemporary (NYC), Hamburger Bannhoff Museum Campus (Berlin), and Tavi Dresdner Gallery (TLV), and has participated in group shows in venues such as Youkobo Art Space (Tokyo), Artilife for The World Gallery (Venice, IT), CICA Museum (South Korea), and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (Tel Aviv), among others. Rivnay has participated at the prestigious I-Park Residency (USA, 2016), and HomeBase Residency (Germany, 2012). Recent solo shows include “How Things Work” (2018) curated by Nogah Davidson at Nulubaz Gallery in Tel Aviv, a show at The Yard — Columbus Circle, NYC (2019) curated by Sarah Crown, and an upcoming solo show at Beit Haomanim in Tel Aviv (2019) curated by Arie Berkowiz. His works are in private and public collections worldwide.

The exhibition will launch on January 31, 2019 with a public reception held in the lobby of ZAZ10TS’ office building at 10 Times Square, and remain open to the public and on display at the location through April 28, 2019. This event also marks the first of several commemorative events taking place in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, Israel, as well as New York City and Amsterdam.\n\nNew Exhibition\n\nUri Katzenstein focused his artistic expression on video projects and installations in the latter stages of his career. Using video allowed him to incorporate other elements from his repertoire such as sculpture, performance art and music. His video pieces, including several in the YOU NEVER KNOW exhibition, were often provocative, violent, profane and purposely confusing. Stories he told though video related to the juxtaposition of opposites such as the real and surreal, humanity and non-human objects, and relationships between disparate concepts and experiences.\n\nIn the artist’s own words, from a 2015 Haaretz article: “I love to work with the spoilage...These are the things that are incompetent, negligible, like bad roots that grow behind stones, but a lot can come from them like healing plants. Everything that ostensibly has no purpose, but over time can have a very deep purpose,” said Uri Katzenstein. “And this is the concept that is in my work. I am interested in taking you on a journey that is dichotomy, is also enjoyable but also horrible, apocalyptic and primary, and primitive.“\n\nMirroring the complexities and layers of life, Uri Katzenstein’s videos mixed linear storytelling with bursts of images and vignettes. He created videos to raise more questions than answers, shunning obvious clarity. Uri Katzenstein is also credited with founding a new language called “Backyard font,” developed to depict the English language graphically.\n\n“Uri is an international treasure,” said Tzili Charney, founder and president of ZAZ10TS, and an organizer of the joint exhibition. “He was able to move seamlessly between disciplines and also became a great instructor to the next generation of artists. Capturing his essence in this video exhibition was a priority for ZAZ10TS as well as Artis. We miss him but his art will live on.”\n\nCross-Border Events\n\nAlong with the YOU NEVER KNOW exhibition, ZAZ10TS and Artis will collaborate with groups to produce a series of international events celebrating Uri Katzenstein. Below is the preliminary list of activities; ZAZ10TS will post further information on its website, www.zaz10ts.com.\n\nJanuary 2019 – University of Haifa will hold an event through its Department of Fine Art.\n\nFebruary 2019 – The Jewish Historical Museum, Amsterdam will present a special event commemorating its past Uri Katzenstein exhibition.\n\nFebruary 2019 – Tel Aviv Museum of Art will hold a special evening event in the museum’s Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art.\n\nApril 2019 – ZAZ10S and Artis will present a moderated panel in New York City on Uri Katzenstein’s lasting artistic and cultural impact, featuring noted curators and artists.\n\nApril 2019 - Mishkenot Shaananim\n\nRecognition\n\nTesting boundaries and forging connections between disparate ideas and concepts became a signature characteristic of Uri Katzenstein’s work. In recognition of his artistic contributions, Uri Katzenstein was honored with several awards, including the Dizengoff Prize for Plastic Arts (2017), and the Dan Sandel and Sandel Family Foundation Sculpture Award (2014), which led to his famous, large-scale solo exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2015 titled Backyard.\n\n“A revered and celebrated artist in his lifetime, Uri’s genre-defying artwork takes on an even greater significance following his untimely death,” said Rivka Saker, founder and board chair of Artis. “Uri took risks in his work in order to make new discoveries. He leaves behind a legacy of curiosity and creativity that will reverberate into the future.”\n\nUri Katzenstein’s work has appeared at Chelsea Art Museum, Duke University Museum of Art, Kunsthalle Dusseldorf, The Israel Museum, and Russian Museum; and at numerous galleries and theatres in Berlin, London, Moscow, New York, San Francisco and Tel Aviv among other global locations. He also participated in several leading art biennials in Instanbul; Poznan, Poland; Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires, where he was awarded first prize in 2002. In 2003, Uri Katzenstein was tapped to represent Israel at the prestigious Venice Biennale. He also began teaching in the Department of Fine Art at the University of Haifa in Haifa, Israel in 2003.\n\nThe YOU NEVER KNOW exhibition will be on display at 10 Times Square and open to the public Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. ET, from January 31, 2019 to April 28, 2019.\n\n###\n\nZAZ10TS is an ongoing cultural initiative that integrates art into the office building at 10 Times Square in New York City (1441 Broadway).

Since December 2017, ZAZ10TS has continually transformed its iconic Garment District building into an art-filled space for building tenants and visitors as well as the broader public to enjoy. In so doing, ZAZ10TS has worked with more than 50 new and established artists presented through curated exhibitions, and via projects in partnership with local, national and international organizations.\n\nTo date, ZAZ10TS has presented four new exhibitions showcasing a vibrant mix of sculpture, video, paintings, textiles, watercolors, fashion, photography and digital art. Each exhibition opened with a public reception with the featured artist, and remained on display in and around the building for approximately three months. ZAZ10TS also features several permanent artworks in its 10 Times Square building, and a permanent feature installation in its 1410 Broadway office building.\n\nClaudia Alvarez: A Moment In Between by Claudia Alvarez, a Mexican-American artist who emigrated from Mexico as a toddler, grew up in Northern California, and lives, works and teaches in New York City (video, sculpture, watercolor, textiles)\n\nMaskit X Eyal Nevo: Mount Sodom, a collaboration between Maskit, a storied Israeli fashion house led by artistic director Sharon Tal, and well-known Israeli fashion photographer Eyal Nevo (photography, video)\n\nBetween Community and Commerce by Sara Berman, a former fashion designer turned artist who lives and works in London (textiles, lint on canvas)\n\nUntitled by Lore Riess, who was born in Berlin and lived in Japan for nearly three decades before moving to New York City (painted fabric)\n\nTzili Charney, founder and president of ZAZ10TS, and principle curator of its exhibitions, remarked that “Art brings people together. Just as it can transform a space, engaging with art can transform perspectives and connect people through a shared experience. We created ZAZ10TS to celebrate that spirit of community through art.”\n\nAlong with its signature exhibitions, ZAZ10TS has collaborated on several projects such as the annual Garment District Arts Festival, in partnership with the Garment District Alliance; Rapture of the Deep at the Textile Art Center in Brooklyn, New York, in partnership with curator and fashion historian Ya’ara Keydar; and My Love Answer, a multi-faceted portrait of humanity made from footage of scenes prior to terrorist attacks around the world, in partnership with the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague.\n\nAdditional collaborative projects include Print Into Motion with the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies based at Columbia University; sponsorship of From Anne Frank - The Graphic Diary adapted by Ari Folman and David Polonsky, in partnership with the Dwek Gallery, Mishkenot Sha'ananim based in Jerusalem; and ZAZ10TS’ first project, 24:7, a video installation of digital media created by artists from around the world that was dually exhibited in New York City and Jerusalem, also in collaboration with the Dwek Gallery.\n\nDiversity of media and the artists behind the innovative works is a hallmark of ZAZ10TS’ vision to celebrate art as an accessible, everyday experience. Artwork featured in its inaugural year represented this breadth and depth of expression. Thus, in celebration of the one-year milestone, ZAZ10TS released a commemorative video of artist interviews from the 24:7 project.\n\n“The positive response to our first year in operation has been wonderful and gratifying,” said Limei Wang, director of ZAZ10TS. “Art is a universal connector and it’s been exciting to see the impact on our community.”\n\nZAZ10TS offers free entry to the lobby of its 10 Times Square building, which is open to the public Monday to Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. EST.

The reception is open to members of the media, as well as building tenants, visitors and the broader public. During the reception, Claudia Alvarez will be available to discuss the exhibition, from individual pieces to the inspiration behind her work, with Tzili Charney on hand to discuss the curatorial process.\n\nClaudia Alvarez created “A Moment In Between” to capture a suspended time in our collective consciousness, where we grapple with universal themes like the struggle for power, vulnerability and violence, youth and aging, and even immigration. As with the pieces included in the new exhibition, her work features child bodies with adult faces, posing with adult characteristics. Her use of this convention serves as a means of simplifying the complexities of the world by viewing life experiences from the perspective of a child, focusing attention on elements of human nature evoked by the pieces she has created. Ultimately, the “Claudia Alvarez: A Moment In Between” exhibition is a social reflection on humanity and how we react in a given moment.\n\n“Those lucky enough to experience Claudia’s art are immediately drawn to the power imbued in her sculptures, and in her paintings and video,” said Tzili Charney, founder of ZAZ10TS and curator of the exhibition. “She’s able to isolate moments before and after an action takes place – and use that artistic space to explore possibility, innocence and how they manifest in humanity. We’re excited to present the world premiere of Claudia’s work to ZAZ10TS’ community, and to a growing number of local and global visitors.”\n\nThe new exhibition will feature several pieces, including the inaugural presentation of the three new artworks created by Claudia Alvarez:\n\nThe “Untitled” sculpture shows a girl sitting on a stool, with her eyes closed, immersed in her own thoughts. Her body is washed with porcelain.\n\nThe “Sitting” sculpture sits on the floor and depicts a young girl with eyes painted black, looking off to some undefined object or moment. Her body is brushed with porcelain, and the small scale speaks to collective memory and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe “Wading” video explores the potential of sculpture outside a gallery space and invites viewers to mediate between time and space.\n\nZAZ10TS incorporated an earlier sculpture from Claudia Alvarez as part of the permanent, built-in art collection at its 10 Times Square office building. “Boxing Girl,” an oil on bronze sculpture, debuted in the lobby of the building in December 2017 and shows a young girl in a boxing stance, wearing red gloves, in a state of readiness.\n\n“As I’m working, in the back of my mind is the notion that people will interact with one of my pieces and bring their own personal experience into the work,” said Claudia Alvarez, featured artist in ZAZ10TS’ “Claudia Alvarez: A Moment In Between” exhibition. “With the sculptures, I focused on the metaphor of movement and texture; with the watercolors, I reimagined familiar tropes; and with the video, I sought to connect art with real-life surroundings. Together, these pieces represent glimpses of our shared humanity and I’m forever grateful to Tzili Charney and ZAZ10TS for allowing me to showcase my work in this new exhibition.”\n\nFor the full listing of art featured in the “Claudia Alvarez: A Moment In Between,” exhibition presented by ZAZ10TS, visit zaz10ts.com/a-moment-in-between\n\n###\n\nZAZ10TS is an ongoing cultural initiative that integrates art into the office building at 10 Times Square in New York City (1441 Broadway).

Conceived by former Alexander McQueen designer and current MASKIT artistic director Sharon Tal together with Nevo, Mount Sodom will be on view from September 6 through October 16, 2018 in the new lobby space at 1441 Broadway in the heart of New York’s fashion district, coinciding with New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe exhibition brings together full-color photographs and film from the exceptional collaborative project, photographed and filmed against the dramatic backdrop of Sodom in the Judean desert, and featuring MASKIT’s Spring/Summer 2019 collection The Desert of Sodom against the decadent beauty of the ancient land.\n\nThe 6-minute video features the Inbal Dance Theater—Israel’s first contemporary dance company, choreographed by Mor Shani and produced and directed exclusively by Eyal Nevo for MASKIT.\n\nMount Sodom is inspired by the myths of the ancient city of Sodom and the contradictions of a land that at once both attracts and repels with the silence and violence of the its landscape, magical presence of biblical history and forceful aesthetics of industrialization.\n\nThe exhibition speaks to MASKIT’s conscious self-renewal alongside utmost respect for its history and tradition, bringing contemporary shapes and textures into the landscape while honoring the promise, magic and mythology of the ancient land. As head designer Sharon Tal recounts: “Discussions about the ancient story of Sodom provoked emotions and images of once-magnificent landscapes, now degraded by industrialization. Together with 35 artists in all, we created a new and thought-provoking work that merges fashion and art.”\n\n“This piece of nature, located at the lowest point in the world, is unique,” Eyal Nevo explains. “Sodom’s past and its current situation ignited my imagination in the inner journey I undertook together with Maskit, a firm which also has an iconic symbolism for Israel.”\n\nMASKIT\n\nMaskit is a luxury fashion house with a unique origin. Conceived in 1954 by Ruth Dayan, Maskit made contemporary luxury clothing utilizing traditional embroidery. Maskit designs came to be treasured by leading ladies such as Audrey Hepburn and collaborations with Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, and Givenchy followed, as did a flagship store in New York City. Bergdorf, Neiman Marcus, Saks – all carried the brand and admired their vision.\n\nSharon Tal and her life partner Nir Tal collaborated with Ruth Dayan, and Lynn and Stef Wertheimer to relaunch the brand in 2013. Formerly under Alexander McQueen and working directly under Alber Elbaz at Lanvin prior, Sharon took the helm of MASKIT in 2014, with blessing and input from Ms. Dayan. Together, they have launched several successful collections and shown internationally, honoring and innovating, revitalizing a brand while earning plaudits for their striking designs.\n\nEYAL NEVO\n\nEyal Nevo lives and works in Tel Aviv, Israel, and is one of the country’s leading fashion photographers, best-known for both his editorial and brand work.
