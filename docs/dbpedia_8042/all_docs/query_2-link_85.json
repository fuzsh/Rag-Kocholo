They will be living with it for a long time. It is only with this book on American synagogues that I have come to realize the true meaning of that decision. My own dissertation, which was on architect Louis I. Kahn’s public work for the Jewish community in the 1950s and 1960s (and took more than a decade to complete), has spawned all the projects I have tackled since. Lou Kahn’s work was even the generator of a book I wrote on playgrounds, giving further evidence that a dissertation is a research assignment that is never finite. Kahn’s ongoing presence in my life means, too, that I have continuing and heartfelt thanks to give to David Brownlee (my dissertation super­visor) and the Architectural Archives of the University of Pennsylvania (home of the Louis I. Kahn Collection). Marian Burleigh-Motley, by asking me to speak on Kahn’s unbuilt synagogues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, gave this project a boost. It is a pleasure to work once more with an outstanding editor and publisher. Ellen Wicklum, Phyllis Deutsch, Ann Brash, and the staff at University Press of New England, have been extremely supportive. I am fortunate to have such dedicated professionals take charge of my book. Jonathan Sarna, editor of this Brandeis series, made insightful comments that helped shape conclusions. I truly appreciate his guidance. The people who read my manuscript had strong views and clear opinions. I owe deep gratitude to Marvin Bressler, Kathleen James-Chakraborty, and Pamela Grossman. Carol Krinsky selflessly gave me extraordinary and wise counsel. Rabbi Albert Gabbai, of Mikveh Israel, deserves special praise. He has made records available to me and has been an eager respondent to my many questions. Rabbis at other congregations and institutions offered additional, often provocative, thoughts: Mark Cohen, Jim Diamond, Jaymee Alpert, Moshe Edelman, Daniel Freelander, and Nina Mandel.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 9\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\nx Acknowledgments\n\nI have had the good fortune to use several archives and collections. Each has welcomed me graciously and provided unflagging assistance: American Craft Council; Archives of American Jewish History; Archives of American Art; Avery Library of Columbia University; Environmental Design Archives, University of California, Berkeley; Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania; Special Collections Library at the University of Rochester; Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse University Library; Jewish Museum; Jewish Theological Seminary; and Union of Reform Judaism. The libraries of Princeton University have been both hospitable and indispensable. Two congregations, Temple Emanu-El of Dallas and North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe, Illinois, have remarkable archives. These, under the respective leadership of Gerry Cristol and Merle Branner, merit recognition for the impressive job that each is doing to preserve congregational history. They provided me with papers that would not have been available anywhere else. The firm of Davis Brody Bond Aedas, with its own archival material overseen by Cristy Robinson, has been another excellent repository for unique information. It was serendipity—a chance meeting aided by Kit and Susan Moss— that connected me with Katherine Tachau. She has generously shared her extensive research on her ancestor, architect William Tachau. The following people helped my research unfailingly, and I extend warmest thanks to them: Daniel Belasco, Meredith Bzdek, Chenia Carmel, Frances Chen, June Chow, Meredith Clausen, Lori Dafilou, Peter Eisenstadt, Richard Filipowski, Jane Friedberg, John Gager, Lisa Gelfand, Tom Gillette, Marc Hacker, Miranda Hanbro, Jules Harris, Michael Harris, Mark Horton, Rachel Iannacone, Sue Ann Kahn, Arthur Kiron, James Kolker, James Lavine, Vivian Mann, Nancy Martin, Sarah McHam, Richard Meier, Elizabeth Menzies, Jayne Merkel, Joan Ockman, James Polshek, Kevin Proffitt, Ruth Rischin, Moses Rischin, Sherry Rosen, Netty Scheinman, Denise Scott-Brown, Andrew Shanken, David Shuford, Toby Simon, Joe Siry, Michelle Taylor, Martha Thorne, Nancy Thorne, Robert Venturi, Fred Wasserman, William Whitaker, Samuel Wiener, and Carla Yanni. Architect Stanley Saitowitz, with whom I had several discussions about Abraham Joshua Heschel, furthered my understanding of Kahn’s use of light. Once again, John Blazjewski has shown that a sensational copy photographer can work magic. He has been a key player in ushering this book toward its completion.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 10\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\nAcknowledgments xi\n\nWhile trying to retain a critical eye and unbiased stance, I have found that writing this book has taken me on a nostalgic voyage. Some of my earliest childhood memories involve synagogues in Perth Amboy, New Jersey: the small shul in the basement of one grandfather’s house and the imposing Conservative synagogue where my other grandfather had been president. One of my sweetest recollections involves walking home from holiday services. I also have fond memories of the suburban midcentury synagogue to which my parents moved when we relocated to suburbia and at which my husband (my most dedicated photographer and traveling companion) and I were married. After such a wistful journey, I am delighted to acknowledge the unlimited aid I have received from my family. In addition to my husband Bob Solomon’s assistance, I have been able to tap into the skills of our talented children: Jon Solomon (the conqueror of all design issues and computer woes) and Debra Solomon (the master of the written word) and enjoy the encouragement of their wonderful spouses, Nicole Scheller and Gil Carmel. It is only fitting, therefore, that I dedicate this book to the next generation of our family: the Solomon-Scheller and Solomon-Carmel grandchildren.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 11\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 12\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\nLouis I.

Kahn (1901–1974), who created haunting plans (1961–1972) for Mikveh Israel synagogue, infused his designs with subtle Jewish content. By grounding his schemes with original but not necessarily obvious Jewishness, Kahn set himself apart from many contemporaries who had been designing synagogues since the end of World War II. While other architects applied superficial decorations or manipulated floor plans to “look Jewish,” Kahn found (albeit serendipitously) ways to “become Jewish.” Kahn’s six schemes for Mikveh Israel, none of which was ever executed, offer a lens through which to examine the transformation of the American synagogue during the decade and a half between 1955 and 1970. This book focuses on Kahn’s plans while also examining the designs of synagogues that were most frequently exhibited or published at the time. The objective is to scrutinize the context and legacy of Kahn’s proposals in order to explain the individuality of his solution. Kahn, and those who designed the midcentury synagogues that preceded Mikveh Israel, had to wrestle with the issues that challenged postwar Jewish institutions. They had to confront the changing place of Jews within America’s complex religious system. They had to tackle the pull of suburbanization, the role of modern architecture and decoration in contemporary synagogue design, and the place of nature in a religious structure. The Mikveh Israel clients also demanded that Kahn preserve the history and material trappings of one of America’s oldest Sephardic Orthodox congregations. American Jews, who accounted for 40 percent of world Jewry after World War II, recognized that they had become the hub of global Jewish culture.1 Synagogue construction could show that Jews had a secure place at home. In the aftermath of World War II, American synagogues followed a trajectory similar to that of their counterparts in the time following the Civil War. In both eras, a newly successful Jewish population developed an original architecture, an architecture that would define a presence for Jewish Americans\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 1\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\n2 Introduction\n\nin the evolving religious and cultural landscape of the United states. Congregations, in both periods, sought to retain and expand their numbers of young members.2 Synagogues became active patrons of modern architecture and architectural decoration after World War II. Having a particularly American cast, these buildings sprang up in the suburbs and were aligned primarily with either the Reform or Conservative movements.3 The national leaders of the Reform movement, in particular, played an important part in encouraging progressive design. They chose modernism because it shared their goal of breaking with the past; they rarely choose modernism because it was inexpensive, which it often was not. Professional journals and the popular press spread the renown of these suburban synagogues and helped to establish them as an authentic, original building type. In the late 1940s, architects believed that 1,800 synagogues were building new facilities or updating old ones.4 The total number turned out to be less, but it seems clear that architects were confident that the demand was accelerating for Jewish houses of worship. Always working with an enlightened rabbi, who was often the secret weapon in the successful completion of a building campaign, synagogue committees first hired people who shared their own Jewish heritage. It was not long after the war that their roster of well-regarded mid-twentieth-century architects expanded to include both Jewish and non-Jewish designers. Professional inclusiveness was a fitting tribute to earlier non-Jewish luminary architects—such as Peter Harrison, William Strickland, Thomas U. Walter, Frank Furness—who had designed American synagogues in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Decorative programs distinguished synagogues from modernist churches, restaurants, and schools. Postwar synagogue architects working in the modernist idiom often solicited the participation of adventurous painters and sculptors for elaborate decorative schemes. Bauhaus-inflected crafts and the work of abstract expressionist painters and sculptors began to appear in synagogues before they had been seen widely at gallery exhibitions in the United States or graced the pages of American art journals. Postwar euphoria still lingered when Kahn took on the Mikveh Israel commission in 1961. Young Jewish Americans believed that opportunities were limitless for themselves and their children. They were also finding that identifying themselves as Jews helped to make them American, participants in one of the three primary religions: Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judaism. A tiny minority of the total population, Jews gladly accepted the\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 2\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nimplied invitation to use their religion to defeat Communism as the Cold War heated up and America proclaimed itself the leader of the free world. As discriminatory barriers faded and antisemitism declined, Jews were delighted to see themselves as full participants in the successes of American educational, corporate, residential, and consumer life. Swept up by the optimism of the postwar era, Jews were able to avoid dwelling on the grim details of the Holocaust, and though affected by the creation of the State of Israel, they were far from overwhelmed by it.5 Even the frightening aspects of the Cold War—the national defense drills and “duck and cover” exercises—often confirmed that if Jews were going to be extinguished, it would be because they were Americans, not because they were Jews.6 There is no evidence that Jews of the late 1940s or 1950s were compensating for the horrors of the war by building extravagantly or that they were using architecture to display novel pride because Israel had come into existence in 1948. They were too sure of themselves to believe they were victims and too focused on their own improvement to identify completely with creation of the Jewish state. Kahn’s Mikveh Israel commission demanded that he translate the vitality of American Jewish life in the 1950s, which had just ended, into a uniquely urban plan. Mikveh Israel was returning to the historic area of Phila­delphia, close to where it was incorporated in the eighteenth century. Kahn had to find a way to honor that history, to reinforce his client’s claim that it was the “synagogue of the American Revolution.” Kahn’s strongest ­designs emerged during his first two years of work on the project. It was another decade before the congregation dismissed him. The underlying cause was lack of funds resulting from a financing scheme that was as naive as it was ingenious. Kahn, who had experienced many disappointments in his professional life, found the loss of Mikveh Israel to be one of the most stinging. The Mikveh Israel commission had arrived at a particularly upbeat time in Kahn’s career. After fifteen years of teaching and more than three decades of work on public housing, Kahn was finding his distinct style and articulating a commanding personal philosophy. Work was, at last, flowing into his office. He had secured the commission for the Alfred Newton Richards Medical Research Building at the University of Pennsylvania, a building that the Museum of Modern Art honored with a special exhibition in 1961. Another religious structure, the First Unitarian Church in Rochester, was about to go into construction. The Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, was\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 3\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:37 PM\n\n4 Introduction\n\nunder way. Vincent Scully published the first monograph on Kahn’s work, a book that appeared in 1962. Kahn took it upon himself to use his Mikveh Israel mandate to critique the state of American architecture and synagogue design in the early 1960s. He had begun to fret about modernism even before this commission and the many others that were coming into his office. His concern was not unique. Architects in Europe and America had been trying to temper modernism’s severity for decades. Concerns emerged as early as the 1930s, just a decade after the birth of the movement in Europe. Apprehension intensified in America even before World War II ended. Postwar prosperity and the building boom of the 1950s accelerated the anxieties of Kahn and many of his professional peers. Kahn feared that modernism, which found fertile ground in the United States after the war, had become another historical fashion. He worried that it had become a lifeless style, spawning buildings that could be used interchangeably to accommodate religious and secular purposes. Always believing that he was a modern architect, Kahn took it upon himself to revitalize modernism’s core and find a way to make it timeless, enduring, and reflective of a client’s institutional purpose. With Mikveh Israel, Kahn was able to develop a robust version of modernism that would yield a distinctive synagogue. His interpretation met his own desire to have finite use-specific spaces that would be responsive to human needs and personal interaction. In his plans for Mikveh Israel, he was particularly sensitive to nature, in the form of both warm natural light without glare and landscape. Kahn’s ideals found their best expressions in his proposals for Mikveh ­Israel’s light towers, whose reflective light would become the ephemeral decoration for the sanctuary and the chapel walls, and in the sukkah, the temporary “primitive hut” that is erected each fall. He froze the sukkah in time, making it a permanent garden folly and his personal version of an ideal sanctuary. Mikveh Israel’s designs were the ones in which Kahn showed how an American, urban, postwar synagogue could bolster its own humanist objectives, a goal that was not driven by collective identity but by a concern for how people use and benefit from the constructed world. Kahn’s plans reveal how he tried to balance his personal belief in the universality of religion and the specificity of Judaism, a religion into which he was born but about which he knew little. Despite his private suspicion of any organized religion, he felt a growing yearning to incorporate and accommodate Jewish meaning. Knowing a scant amount about traditional doc-\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 4\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ntrine and observance, Kahn interpreted Jewish content in a sincere, even quirky, manner. In this pursuit, he arrived at ways to accommodate Jewish meaning. There is no evidence to support notions that he was swayed by direct knowledge of or interest in Kabbalah. The resemblance, however, between Kahn’s views and the philosophy of Abraham Joshua Heschel, renowned theologian and professor of ethics and mysticism, raises the possibility that Kahn may have indirectly absorbed a bit of mystical thought. Both men strove to understand the substance of a synagogue. Kahn may indeed have been “deeply spiritual” (a view maintained by his daughter Sue Ann), if one posits spirituality as a heightened awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings, including the human condition and the splendor of nature.7 If spirituality also includes an imperative to act in order to improve people’s lives, then it squares well with the original intent of the modern movement in Europe in the early twentieth century, which set out to create a better society.8 Probably unknown to Kahn, there are Jewish teachings that espouse the same ideals: Tikkun Olam, the ethical precept to heal the world; and Pikkuah Nefesh, which makes it possible to dispense with all commandments (there are 613 that must be observed so as to lead a truly religious life) in order to save a human life. By trying to bridge modernism and Judaism, Kahn had the potential to overcome the inconsistencies that exist in any synagogue design. Synagogues have their own internal contradictions. Foremost is Judaism’s basic ambivalence toward permanent structures. The pivotal event for synagogue architecture was the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 c.e.9 Lacking a site where “God’s presence could be witnessed,” Jews devised an alternative system of prayer and textual interpretation;10 Judaism has maintained since that there is nothing inherently holy about the space of a synagogue; it cannot replicate the Temple. A synagogue exists anywhere that a minyan (a quorum of ten people) comes together.11 The emphasis is on people praying together rather than where they gather; how people come together is more consequential than where they assemble. The synagogue exists in a political and social realm that is expressed in its physical presence, although that physical reality has no inherent sacred nature. One scholar notes: “Sanctity rests in the worshipping congregation, in the community of believers.”12 Putting the same thoughts into even more precise terms, one rabbi wrote in the 1950s: “Without a congregation there is no synagogue.”13 In addition to this abstract and human-centered definition, there are three architectural elements that have become traditional aspects of a ­synagogue\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 5\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\n6 Introduction\n\ninterior: the ark, a niche or cabinet in which the holy Torah scrolls that are the centerpiece of all observance are stored; a bimah, the reading table on which the scrolls are placed when they are being read; and an eternal light that burns constantly, thereby showing the endurance of the faith. In Reform and Conservative congregations, it has been the twentieth-century norm to place the ark and bimah together, along the eastern wall. America and American architecture changed over the course of the Mikveh Israel commission. Jewish identity, so focused in the 1950s on the synagogue as a means of personal representation, changed in the 1960s by becoming more dispersed. Jewish self-perception began to shift from American patriotism to self-appraisal, with Israel and the Holocaust vying for attention. The trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 made it imperative for American Jews to confront the fact that the Nazis had exterminated more than three-quarters of European Jewry. The Six-Day War, in 1967, tied American Jews more deeply, emotionally and financially, to Israel’s fate. Israel’s victory had created a sense of collective relief that the Jewish state had survived, that “another Auschwitz” had been averted.14 Some have argued that Israel had “become the faith of the American Jew.”15 The Holocaust, too, emerged as a means of identity. The late Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg remarked that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. (completed in 1993), became “the national cathedral of American Jewry’s Jewishness.”16 The optimism of postwar America began to fade during the 1960s; synagogue construction slowed as well. By the mid-1970s, many Americans were disillusioned with the power of organized religion to pull people together. Synagogues were less sure of their roles in their communities and in the lives of ordinary Jews. Spurred on by the political activism of the previous decade and by alternatives that emphasized more home-centered participation, Jews began to see the synagogue as just one of many options for religious and social participation. Jewish institutions became more inclusive by counting women in the minyan and ordaining female rabbis at the same time that many Jews began to feel that their own homes had an authenticity that was lacking in synagogue participation. Today, many synagogues are contending with problems that can be traced to prior decades: declining membership, changing demographics, and escalating costs. Frequently burdened by deteriorating infrastructure and the overwhelming spaces of their mid-twentieth-century buildings, synagogues are trying to reconcile the old, staid spaces with the congregation’s\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 6\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ndemand for greater informality and accessibility. Synagogues grapple with questions of preservation and restoration, often unsure what their commitment should be to structures and artwork that have become historically or financially significant. Three decades since Kahn was fired from the Mikveh Israel project, its unbuilt status remains troubling. Kahn had provided a fresh paradigm for a synagogue, one that offered innovative concepts regarding planning, decoration, and the incorporation of light and nature into building design. Kahn’s work for Mikveh Israel showed that a revitalized modernism could promote human contact and positive interaction. Kahn, therefore, managed to conceive of a structure that would embody the essence of Jewish belief about the sanctity of the community. He showed that it was possible to pioneer ways in which a building could incorporate Jewish content without being sentimental or heavy-handed, by capturing the ephemeral aspect of Judaism. While the needs of today’s synagogues pose different challenges than those Kahn handled, contemporary architects might still be able to find some inspiration in his approach. It should not be copied, but aspects of it could be evoked in new and engaging ways. Kahn demonstrated that an excellent architect, one whose vision of a synagogue could elevate the needs of his client, could transform practical uses into an exceptional place for worship. Perhaps now, in the early twenty-first century, when so much of Judaism and its buildings are in flux, the time is right for American synagogues to reach out once again to America’s most promising architects. These practitioners, including a young generation that is just beginning to build, should be able to adapt and interpret Kahn’s approach in hopes of once more establishing a progressive cultural and architectural image for each Jewish community. Jewish museums have paved the way. Now is the moment for synagogues to join them in being vital expressions of American Jewish life.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 7\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 8\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\nHistory The Postwar Synagogue\n\n1\n\nDuring the late 1940s and through the 1950s, the United States experienced a wave of renewed religious interest. While it appears that this was less a religious revival and more a means to self­identification and a rejection of communism, synagogues and churches, many of which arose to meet the needs of an increasingly suburbanized population, feverishly built new structures to respond to meet the demand.1 The implications were particularly profound for Judaism. Americans came to see Jews, who made up about 3 percent of the population from the 1950s to the 1970s, as the country’s “third religion,” after the Protestant and Catholic faiths.2 Jews, most of whom were only a generation or two removed from parents or grandparents who had emigrated from Eastern Europe, found a new inclusiveness. Optimism, a key part of the American psyche, was the underlying theme of Jewish life in the 1950s. Even McCarthyism and the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, which Jews feared would link them to communism, now appear as confined deviations from an otherwise positive historical path. Jews were propelled into the suburbs as a positive endorsement of postwar possibilities: Jews could live in areas from which they had previously been barred, work in fields that had previously been hostile to them, and attend schools from which they had been excluded by quotas.3 It’s a compelling fact that Jews accounted for one-quarter of the Harvard student body by 1952.4 Suburban synagogue construction was dynamic, a symbol of thriving contemporary Jewish life. Jewish institutions, which have always had a great deal of local control and have never been permanently tied to any one neighborhood or single building or resident population, easily made the shift or emerged as new entities.5 Many facilities emerged in nonurban areas that had never had Jewish communities before.6 Synagogues were built to be original presences that reflected well on Judaism; their designers replicated Protestant values and building models in order to make them a cultural\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 9\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\n10 h i s t o r y\n\nforce, at once unique and recognizably American. While churches chose from a variety of styles, postwar synagogues were exclusively modern and became “showpieces of the modern movement.”7 Modern architecture succeeded in an American Jewish context because Jewish leaders, especially those in the Reform movement, proclaimed that it meshed with what they saw as the forward-thinking nature of American Judaism. Modernism offered congregations a chance for physical representation of their own progressive ideals, and Jews, who had reason to be ambivalent about architecture, embraced it and its modern vocabulary. The synagogue building proclaimed that Jews were a visible part of American society; they had truly “arrived” in the suburbs. Their new religious homes were as bold as their synagogue’s religious, social, and educational activities. The Reform movement, unlike the other main branches of American Judaism, adopted a single message about architecture. It relied on a definition of modernism that was inclusive, accepting any building not laden with historical decoration or one that did not display a historical style. American Religion and Judaism after World War II\n\nWorld War II was a watershed. One pair of observers noted that American Jews had been “jet-propelled from the periphery of American life, an immigrant, low-income, embattled, defensive group, to a rising middle-class status, in a community of highly educated, mobile, culturally advanced, predominantly native-born Americans.”8 Accelerated growth of Jewish populations in the suburbs accompanied this transformation. Congregations either followed their urban membership to suburban turf or sprang up as totally new institutions. Conservative congregations dominated the scene, although Reform congregations were significant presences.9 In the 1950s, the Rabbinical Assembly, the ruling body for Conservative rabbis, permitted car travel to the synagogue on Sabbath and holidays. The rabbis, by allowing car travel that the Orthodox wing did not sanction, hoped to promote synagogue attendance and heightened observance.10 Conservative congregations, removed from the constraint of serving only members in their neighborhood, now vied with Reform synagogues for support from the same population pool. Increased demand for spaces for worship, education, and general socialization soon led to membership campaigns and construction plans. Synagogue success can be attributed only partly to the need of a reli-\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 10\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:38 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 11\n\ngious and/or ethnic group to spend time together in a new setting. Throughout America, a postwar religious revitalization was taking place. The phrase “under God” was added to the pledge of allegiance in June 1954.11 Though it had appeared on coins since the Civil War, “In God We Trust” did not become the official motto of the United States until 1956.12 The motto had been used at Eisenhower’s 1953 inauguration, where it was emblazoned on the “float to God” that led the floats of each of the states.13 Jews and Judaism became integral parts of the American stew. Television advertisements of the 1950s proclaimed that “the family that prays together, stays together,” and the accompanying visuals made it clear that Americans could choose from three different houses of worship, one of which was Jewish. The Cold War and the specter of communism must have fueled some of a Christian, largely Protestant, America’s relinquishment of exclusivity. Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman’s 1946 book Peace of Mind, a self-help manual that sold more than one million copies, heralded “Judaism’s emergence as an intellectual, cultural, and theological force within postwar American society.”14 The architectural world made a similar announcement. Architectural Record, one of three primary journals for modern design at the time, depicted a Star of David alongside a cross on the August 1951 cover. Chronicler Will Herberg was one of the first to take note of these occurrences. While Americans may have divided themselves into a tripartite nation of Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish identities, Herberg recognized as early as 1950 that in order to be fully “American,” citizens felt that they needed to be allied with one of these three dominant religions.15 For Jews, as well as Christians, religion was the key to acceptance in the secular world. But religious identification was rarely tied to increased observance and could be interpreted as “a religion . . . of the American Way of Life.”16 Sociologist Herbert Gans found that Jews in a newly formed suburb wanted their children to grow up with a sense of Jewish identity and some formal Jewish education. These same Jewish adults did not indicate any interest in furthering Jewish ritual in their own homes.17 A synagogue was needed for ethnic identity and cohesiveness, for Jewish education, and to “demonstrate the solidarity and respectability of the Jewish community” to the rest of the neighbors.18 Both Gans and fellow sociologist Nathan Glazer refuted the notion that Hitler or Zionism were responsible for renewed Jewish participation in synagogues. Gans concluded that the “arrival of children” was a more profound motivator for parents; Glazer believed that adults, with unlimited freedom, consciously chose not “to become non-Jews.”19\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 11\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\n12 h i s t o r y\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that synagogue membership widened. The proportion of Jews who were synagogue members rose from 40 percent in the late 1940s to 60 percent in the late 1950s.20 One pollster reported that synagogue membership may have been as high as 80 percent in 1956.21 uahc and Modernism\n\nArchitectural commentators of the 1940s and 1950s set out to document their profession as Herberg was chronicling Jewish mores. In 1944, architects prepared for postwar peace by discussing the coming need for schools and religious buildings. In that year, Architectural Record responded to growing interest by adding “churches” as a distinct category in its ongoing Building Types Study.22 That journal’s editor, Kenneth Stowell, like others in the architectural world, was skeptical that the modernism would become a ­compelling choice for religious institutions. He felt that postwar church architecture would again fall into “modern” and “traditional” camps, with change coming only slowly.23 In that same issue of Architectural Record, the architect Ben Bloch (of the firm Bloch and Hesse) provided the Jewish perspective. Like Stowell, he doubted that a modern vocabulary would make any headway in the Jewish world. Synagogues had made little architectural impact in the spare building years of the 1930s and early 1940s, and Bloch predicted that both Reform and Conservative congregations would return to earlier historicist models that valued the comfort of architectural details of prior centuries: “Doubtless in most cases the new building will be in one of the traditional styles. There may be some synagogues, as well as churches, in the modern functional style, but they probably will be few in number in the immediate future, because man’s urge to build a place of worship is basically sentimental and emotional, inevitably linked to the past.”24 Bloch had reason to be guarded. He saw no reason for architects to adopt an untried building vocabulary as long as they could exploit new materials and new means of construction, erecting buildings that reflected current advances in technology while retaining a familiar style. The question at that point, then, was which vocabulary would prevail. When Congregation B’nai Amoona, for instance, purchased land in 1942 in St. Louis, they expected that their new sanctuary would be built in a historicist mode.25 Joseph Hudnut, dean of the architecture school at Harvard, who was trying to advance the cause of modern church design, presented an alternative\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 12\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 13\n\noption in 1944. Acknowledging that it would be accepted slowly, he argued that the time had arrived for “welcoming the presence of the contemporary world” by taking advantage of new materials. Hudnut also declared that inevitably the church will “declare herself for modern art” because of its “rightness and strength” and in order to use decorative arts for their “humanity and warmth.”26 Immediately after the war concluded, a shift in Protestant church architecture encouraged synagogues to follow a daring route. The Interdenominational Bureau of Architecture, a joint venture of the major Protestant denominations, responded to suburban development by advocating a nonhistoricist approach for churches. It published its recommendations in Planning Church Buildings, a book that was available as early as 1945 and highlighted in Architectural Record in 1947.27 The Interdenominational Bureau maintained a positive, albeit limited, method.28 It eschewed “style,” thereby ending any discussion that could have favored historicism. Use and function, rather, were its criteria. To those ends, the bureau focused on how congregations could achieve a program. If a congregation could not produce such a document on its own, the Interdenominational Bureau had a clearly thought-out plan that would enable a panel of architects to work with congregations to elicit it from them.29 Protestants thereby set the stage for outside consultants to aid local congregations in the design of religious buildings; to guide them toward modern problem solving in order to arrive at buildings that reflected their own time and need. The bureau advised its member congregations that “architecture is an expression of life. Don’t under any circumstances, if you have a competent architect, tell him how the building is to be designed. Allow him freedom to develop a plan and exterior design which he believes is the best possible solution for your particular problem and environment. Don’t tell him it must be ‘colonial’ (a misnomer) Gothic or Swedish.”30 Judaism’s Reform movement moved quickly to affect the design of synagogues that were still in planning or even preplanning stages. The Reform movement’s alliance of synagogues, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) enlisted the aid of an art historian and set up its own panel, the Synagogue Architects Consultant Panel (SACP), no doubt following the Protestant model. They tapped art historian Franz Landsberger, former director of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, to consult with congregations or their architects, presumably about decorative schemes.31 The Jewish Museum in Berlin, following the lead of Protestant theologians who\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 13\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\n14 h i s t o r y\n\nhad encouraged creation of modern ceremonial objects for all religions, had actively supported the display of contemporary Jewish objects.32 Lands­ berger’s identification with the museum and alliance with UAHC signaled the forward-thinking nature of the Reform movement, although there is no evidence that any congregation took advantage of his expertise. The SACP was more active. Architect Harry M. Prince was the first leader of the group, and for a while its only participant.33 Prince took it upon himself to review congregational building plans and advise against pitfalls.34 Later, the SACP evolved into a group of volunteer architects who would counsel congregations on how to initiate and carry out a building process. The SACP had no stock plans, and its architects were forbidden to promote their own work. Keenly aware that the Conservative movement was growing in numbers and garnering much attention through its highly successful NBC radio program, The Eternal Light, the Reform movement may have looked to the SACP as a way to further its own success in the suburbs.35 The panel, therefore, can been seen as having had a dual purpose: it emulated Protestant efforts in hopes of steering congregations away from historicism, and it positioned the Reform movement to soar ahead of the Conservative branch. At some point, even famed non-Jewish architect William Lescaze signed on as a volunteer.36 Commentary magazine, begun in 1945 by the American Jewish Committee as a nonsectarian monthly journal of opinion on politics and the arts, became the medium that brought discussion of synagogue design to many American Jewish households. Fiercely anticommunist, Commentary became a vehicle for intellectual discussions that bridged the gap between “American and Jewish identities.”37 Beginning in March 1947, Commentary ran a series of articles that dealt specifically with synagogues, hoping to provide useful guidelines for people making decisions about new construction. The first article, by Rachel Wischnitzer, a prolific art historian, architect, and former curator at the Jewish Museum in Berlin, has an intriguing title and a revealing subtitle: “The Problem of Synagogue Architecture: Creating a Style Expressive of America.”38 Wischnitzer, confident that America, aided by the emergence of Jewish architects, would be able to develop an architecture that could reflect the role of Jews in an open society, does not endorse modernism directly but makes it clear that historicism would no longer be appropriate. She views historicist synagogue design as a benign but “gentile notion of what Jewish tradition looks like.”39 She seeks a synthesis appropriate to the freedoms that Jews were discovering in the postwar years, in\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 14\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 15\n\nlight of which they no longer had to create synagogues that evoked histories that were fantastical, such as those built in the prevalent nineteenth-century “Moorish” style.40 For her own era, Wischnitzer demands “something new, expressive of a more self-conscious Jewishness, at home in America.”41 At the same time, she warns against too much brazen or boastful architecture, displaying nostalgia for “the small, intimate, and humble things, for what is unpretentious and human in scale.”42 Three months later, Commentary published responses from three Jewish architects and art historian Landsberger.43 All of them argue against historicism or “copying” and in favor of creating a new, dynamic architecture that is appropriate for their times. Landsberger argues most cogently for the adoption of a modern sensibility. After noting that lack of ornamentation makes it easier for a building to reveal its function and that it provides a more dignified presence than the historical pastiches of the past, he states the real connection between synagogues and modern design. He writes unequivocally that modernism “parallels our striving toward clarity and truth in our religious thinking.”44 Landsberger posits that, in order to continue their mission and to affect the streetscape, synagogues should employ the best architects that they can find. Three of the other writers, architects Ely Jacques Kahn (no relation to Louis Kahn) and Percival Goodman, along with Goodman’s brother, novelist Paul Goodman, take that idea further by insisting that synagogues find the best painters, sculptors, and even craftsmen for their jobs. Eric Mendelsohn, from whom Wischnitzer was hoping to elicit a definition of a “Jewish American” architecture, does not comment on the role of Jews as architects or on a “Jewish “ style. Instead, he proposes a bold, thoughtfully conceived architecture that takes advantage of contemporary building materials and methods in order to position Jews as “full participants in this momentous period of America’s history.”45 Mendelsohn urges timelessness and human scale, so that synagogues will be appreciated by future generations; natural light for inspiration; and flexibility, so that money is not squandered on spaces that are used only a few times each year. He also argues for a good fit between the building and its topography. It is worth noting that the architects who wrote for Commentary (Mendelsohn, Goodman, Ely Jacques Kahn) were already working on or were about to design a New York City monument to commemorate Jews who perished in Europe. That memorial was not constructed and the entire urge to remember was put on hold until Holocaust monuments began to be built in the mid-1960s. ­Synagogue\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 15\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\n16 h i s t o r y\n\nc­ onstruction apparently supplanted memorials in the 1950s because their construction was more forward thinking and dynamic.46 The UAHC, aware of its power to generate discussion on architecture, inaugurated two conferences on synagogue architecture in 1947. Held in New York and Chicago, in order that as many congregations and architects as possible could participate, the first of these took place the same month that the four opinion pieces ran in Commentary.47 Three of the authors (Mendelsohn was not there) participated. The conference theme, “An American Synagogue for Today and Tomorrow,” indicated a demand for immediate action and for long-term plans. Attendees at both heard pleas for the modern approach. Percival Goodman later recalled a glorious moment during which he felt the conference endorsed modernism: “Most of us who spoke made a plea for the acceptance and support of modern architecture, describing its integrity, reasonableness, and beauty. The result of the conference was enthusiastic support by the Union of an artistic position considered by many to be radical.”48 Another participant recalled things differently, suggesting that while there was castigation of the old “historical styles . . . no conclusion was reached as to what style of architecture ought to shape the synagogue of our land and our day.”49 The UAHC, aware that “this is a new era and there are many important problems that precedent will not decide,” had organized the conferences in order to show that “the American synagogue of the future shall be a wellplanned modern and distinctive building, avoiding the false traditions and the architectural mistakes of the past.” The conference hosted two exhibits to reinforce its premise. One showed photos and sketches of “outstanding examples of new American synagogues in the modern style.” The other exhibited examples of “synagogue ornamentation and decoration” created by Jewish artists. The UAHC had clearly arrived at an early conclusion: modernism would be the language of the future (as soon as possible), and decoration would be key to transforming universal modernism into Jewish particularism.50 The resulting lack of firm acceptance of modernism must have been a setback and might explain why the UAHC initially declined to publish the conference proceedings for member congregations.51 It is also possible that congregations may not yet have latched on to modernism as a radical break with the past and an affirmation of a new era. One architect, alluding to the connection between modernism and American context, proclaimed that it was imperative to build in a modern style because it was the dominant trend\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 16\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:39 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 17\n\nand “Jews have always built of the time and of the country in which they found themselves and it is this tradition that you should carry out.”52 So for some observers, modernism was another style to which Judaism should conform. It was 1953 before the UAHC published a book that contained some of the proceedings of the 1947 meetings; the volume included additional historical material along with seating, lighting, and acoustical suggestions. This book not only makes it possible to glean how architects presented projects and opinions at the early gatherings but also to see how the UAHC became more vocal in its advocacy of modernism by the mid-1950s. Expanding on the theme of the earlier conferences, the book is titled An American Synagogue for Today and Tomorrow: A Guide Book to Synagogue Design and Construction.53 This compendium was edited by Peter Blake, then a fervent modernist. Blake, who later credited architect Goodman as the force behind publication, complains that congregations had not yet sought out excellent architects or craftsmen.54 He hoped that the book would ignite “a renaissance in synagogue architecture.”55 Rabbi Maurice Eisendrath, president of the UAHC, used the book’s publication to sell modernism to his member congregations. Having wavered at first in his support for the modern cause, Eisendrath had become a firm and loyal spokesperson by 1954: “It is hoped that through this volume the tendency of mimicry and simulation in the synagogue will become speedily an unhappy remembrance of things past, and that a stirringly creative period of synagogue architecture expressed in esthetic modern idiom may be stimulated.”56 Eisendrath had a message for architects, too. Writing in Architectural Record, he fleshed out the UAHC’s position on modernism, announcing that the style had become an American phenomenon and that worshipping in a modern structure would signal that Jews were participating in a national event as well as a religious one. Jews already knew that they had to identify with their religion in order to be perceived as Americans; now architects learned that they could give physical form to that identification by using the vocabulary of modernism. According to Eisendrath, the honesty and simplicity of modern architecture promoted civic awareness in addition to prayer: “The members of the Synagogue Architects Consultant Panel of our Union, which consists of nearly 40 architectural firms, are committed to the belief that 20th-century American Jews can be most suitably inspired to worship God in daily services, on Sabbaths, festivals, and holy days in\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 17\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:40 PM\n\n18 h i s t o r y\n\nFigure 1.1.

Large or small, the sanctuaries now being built mirror the oneness of the Jew with this unique and beloved land.”57 Practicing modern architects wrote short entries for An American Synagogue for Today and Tomorrow in order to bolster Eisendrath’s remarks and to demonstrate variety within the modernist, antihistoricist approach. Having been urged to choose the best possible architects, synagogue members could pick up this single volume to investigate some of most accomplished practitioners of the decade. Eric Mendelsohn’s statement on his B’nai Amoona in St. Louis was published posthumously, following his death in 1953. A Conservative congregation founded in the early 1880s by German Jews, B’nai Amoona was the first modern synagogue to enter the American consciousness (see fig. 1.1). Built between 1948 and 1950, the congregation’s new, modern synagogue became known in both the Jewish and secular architectural worlds.58 B’nai Amoona’s prominent position on the June 1953 cover of Architectural Forum would have made it hard for professionals to avoid it. Indeed, architects had eagerly awaited its completion, as it was Mendelsohn’s first American building. Mendelsohn, who had built extensively in Germany before fleeing in 1933, had also worked in London and Palestine before coming to the United States in 1941. He had previously done work for\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 18\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:40 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 19\n\nthe Jewish community in Europe, including cemetery chapels and social centers.59 His fame in the future Israel rested on the sprawling Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus (1934–39). Shortly after his arrival, Mendelsohn was the subject of a retrospective exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.60 Mendelsohn’s German work included the Einstein Tower, with its nod to expressionism, and a number of modern commercial buildings, especially department stores. His commercial projects led the way in a modernism that was reflective of German progressive design. His projects were characterized by undecorated surfaces that took advantage of technology but were not as industrially oriented or focused on standardization as the work coming out of the famous Bauhaus. Mendelsohn, along with many German colleagues, sought a way to update and reinterpret the integration of all the arts that had first been advocated by the Arts and Crafts movement of the nineteenth century. At the end of World War II, B’nai Amoona planned a move to a site in University City, just outside of St. Louis. For the new synagogue, Mendelsohn devised a plan of clearly defined uses marked by easily legible volumes, especially the off-center, truncated parabolic roof that tops the sanctuary. His plan shows how a synagogue could express its individual hierarchic parts without forsaking a unified whole. B’nai Amoona departs from elongated “Moorish” or centralized “Byzantine” plans of the past by allowing the sanctuary’s sweeping roof, visible from the street, to dominate the composition. This broke with American urban precedent whereby the front, streetside portals were exaggerated or the composition focused on centralized vertical massing.61 A carefully assembled plan, B’nai Amoona unifies the distinct parts and allows for flexibility, exactly as Mendelsohn had advised in his 1947 Commentary essay. At the street, a covered porch begins the circulation route. Entering the building, the primary spaces are organized from west to east so that the sanctuary’s eastern wall can accommodate the ark. A foyer separates the sanctuary from an assembly hall. The circulation route continues on to a small chapel, a meeting room, and a series of classrooms. It is of great consequence that a garden is at the heart of the project, an indication that nature can be brought into synagogue space in order to provide places for reflection and enjoyment of nature. Mendelsohn’s contemporaneous Park Synagogue in Cleveland (completed in 1952) expands the size of the “patio” and uses it as the organizing concept for the school and as a foil to a deep foyer that is linked to a sanctuary.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 19\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:40 PM\n\n20 h i s t o r y\n\nMendelsohn, who neither invented nor promoted “expandable space,” illustrated here that he could refine and tame it. He exploited expandability in order to tackle the ongoing problem of accommodating a large crowd for the High Holy Days at the same time that he rejected overwhelming spaces for smaller groups during daily and weekly worship. For B’nai Amoona, he placed a sanctuary for 600 people on an axis with a foyer and an assembly hall; the three areas could be connected to accommodate 1,500 people during the High Holy Days. Mendelsohn was careful to make sure that the dramatic sanctuary ceiling never merged with the ancillary rooms, in order to retain the integrity of each space. The expandable sanctuary was already an accepted arrangement by Mendelsohn’s time. As early as 1903 Albert Kahn (another architect unrelated to Louis Kahn) had designed an expandable space to provide a way to unite the social room with classrooms at Temple Beth El in Detroit.62 Chicago architects Loebl, Scholssman and Demuth had created expandable space in the 1930s, using a movable platform between the sanctuary and the Sunday school auditorium.63 Ben Bloch, the architect who believed there would be a return to historicism, stated in 1944 that the problem of expandable space “has been solved in some recent synagogues by the simple expedient of locating the social hall so that it adjoins the synagogue, and permits the two auditoriums to be used as one by means of folding partitions.”64 Mendelsohn’s synagogue, which would be the first of four, strove to convey the nonhistorical timelessness that he had written about. Kathleen James-Chakraborty notes that Mendelsohn found a model in Otto Bartning and Dominikus Böhm’s concepts for German churches. The German designers had put a new emphasis on community in the sanctuary and had used “immaterial light” in place of historicist decoration in order to intensify the religious experience.65 James-Chakraborty maintains that Mendelsohn adapted their ideas, which had been spreading in postwar churches, to a Jewish context.66 This is particularly evident in the natural light that pours in from clerestory windows that outline the arch and illuminate the ark. Together, ark and light seem to form a single composition that starts with the materiality of the ark and ascends to the immateriality of the sky above. An ark, whether a freestanding piece of furniture with doors or a simple niche in a wall, would typically have a cloth covering in front of the area housing the Torah and a representation of the Ten Commandments (Decalogue) above. Mendelsohn was able to meld these traditional elements into a single unit while excluding other vernacular references, such as a crown or\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 20\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:40 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 21\n\nFigure 1.2.

His ark is in some ways as dramatically innovative as the roof design (see fig. 1.2). It is a rectangle composed of four folding panels, each an abstract pattern formed by open metal grillwork.67 Louise Kayser (1899–1983), better known as a designer of stained glass, did the weaving, which rests behind the ark doors.68 Mendelsohn was equally spare with his treatment of the Star of David as a design element on the exterior. His initial model displayed a side wall composed of intersecting Stars of David; the final design substituted a solid brick wall, with just a single, relatively small Star of David, inscribed in a circle, to denote a Jewish house of worship. Percival Goodman, the architect who probably instigated the publication of the UAHC book An American Synagogue for Today and Tomorrow, used that tome to display his recent work and to express his views about “The Character of the Modern Synagogue” in a piece by that title. He was well positioned to become the architectural authority on work for the Jewish community. Having participated in a renovation of the Jewish Museum\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 21\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:41 PM\n\n22 h i s t o r y\n\nin the 1940s, Goodman found himself in the center of burgeoning discussions about synagogues in Commentary magazine and at the UAHC conferences. In his essay “Character” he writes about the evolving nature of the synagogue, an institution that was being transformed by members’ needs for socialization and group identity more than by religious pressures. He recog­ nizes that the architect is “faced with the difficulty of designing a building whose primary uses are secular, but whose main reason for being is sacred.”69 In his essay, Goodman expresses a philosophy that has shifted toward flexible accommodation. In the late 1940s, he had mocked Ben Bloch’s assertion that a sanctuary could be joined to a social hall for the large High Holy Day seating, writing that architects “must not forget the maxim that ‘an all purpose object is rarely good for anything.’ ”70 But by 1954, Goodman had found a solution that usually had the sanctuary open into a social hall for a large crowd. He exploited the concept in many of his successive synagogues, often creating a dull, tunnel-like arrangement. Goodman does not shy away from promoting his own work in the UAHC volume.71 He uses views and plans for his B’nai Israel (1949–51) to illustrate his points and to demonstrate his new faith in expandable, flexible space (see fig. 1.3).72 In that plan, the sanctuary can be expanded into a reception area and combined with the social hall to accommodate the largest crowds. Educational and some social functions are housed in a low, attached structure. The materials are simple wood and brick throughout. B’nai Israel, a Conservative congregation, may have been Goodman’s best work in that building type. It became America’s iconic modern synagogue. Long and low, B’nai Israel sits on a leafy suburban tract in Millburn, New Jersey. The building runs parallel to the bustling thoroughfare (part of a major access route to Newark) in front of it. The massing is simple, with a large block given over to the sanctuary and the most plastic area reserved for the ark wall. Goodman planned a garden to cling to that same suburban streetscape. The garden’s role was supplementary, preventing it from being anything like the internal view of nature that is central to Mendelsohn’s St. Louis plan. B’nai Israel swiftly gained fame. Like the more than fifty synagogues that Goodman executed between 1947 and 1979, its design was widely published; even Time magazine reported on its completion.73 Recognition came not just because of its spare plan and use of elegant but readily available materials but also because it expressed forcefully that synagogues could be new patrons for art.74 An entire chapter in the book Contemporary Synagogue\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 22\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:41 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 23\n\nFigure 1.3.

The artworks show how abstraction could be a way to communicate meaning. Ferber’s “direct-metal construction,” in which the artist worked to bend, cut, and hammer the metal into expressive forms, has raw ­power.78 Gottlieb’s ark cover further developed his “pictographs,” small symbols with which he had been experimenting since the 1940s.

Gottlieb’s ark curtain adds a sense of verticality to the sanctuary interior; at the same time, Ferber’s sculpture on the exterior of the ark provides a similar outward thrust. Motherwell filled his mural with abstract symbols, tackling the question of representing the Diaspora and the notion of a “temple wall.” For many worshippers the synagogue may have provided their first encounter with current abstract art. Even for Christians interested in contemporary art, the synagogue became the place to see some of the newest works by artists who would become part of the group known as the New York school. Gottlieb had shown his work in group exhibits in the 1940s, but the B’nai Israel pieces were his first commissioned work. Ferber had mounted a solo exhibit at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1947; the B’nai Israel sculpture was his first in situ commission. Motherwell had shown more than the others in the 1940s but rarely exhibited any of this work in the 1950s. The experience for the artists was similarly unique. They were young, just establishing themselves, and did not have much work. Some felt that placing their art on or in a building would betray their ideals about creating a pure, abstract art unrelated to context. Recalling events surrounding the creation of his B’nai Israel sculpture, Ferber (who had trained as a dentist before becoming an artist) noted the differences between his views and those of young painter Ad Reinhardt, as well as the similarities he shared with painter Barnett Newman: Perhaps even in those days [Reinhardt] had a kind of purist idea about it. I know he was very much opposed when I made my architectural sculpture in 1951 for Percy Goodman for a synagogue. He was very much opposed to the idea that I should do anything as commonplace and public as a sculpture for an architect. Barney Newman, on the other hand, encouraged me. This really sounds ridiculous now but at that time this was really an ethical question that we faced and tried to solve. . . . Since we had certainly been rejected by the largest part of the public, and that included the museums and collectors, we felt considerable antagonism to the outside world as we looked at it. So that when an architect such as Percy Goodman, who was really the first architect in America to face up to the problem of using abstract art on this building, when he came along everybody began to discuss it as if it were a questionable thing to do.79 Goodman never again reached the same equilibrium of restrained modesty and artistic bravura as he did for the Millburn synagogue. When he\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 24\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 25\n\nselected artists of the Kootz Gallery, which provided him with artists for the Millburn job, or a few fine independent artists, he chose painters and sculptors of superior skill. When, with an increasing number of commissions, he began to seek artists from outside the Kootz stable, his artistic choices frequently faltered. It is quite possible that economics entered into his decision for decorative schemes and that he later chose affordable, often sentimental, artists. Both cynical and prosaically practical, Goodman began to rely on (and replicate endlessly) a simplistic formula. In order to answer the needs of secularized Judaism, he perfected the expandable plan that permitted the sanctuary to merge with the social hall for the High Holy Day crowds. His solutions became unnecessarily vast and spatially dull. Just before the UAHC book was released, Goodman told one prospective client that he planned a synagogue according to how it could be expanded and how it could be used as a community hub; only secondarily did he consider how it could be used for worship and learning.80 He had internalized perfectly the postwar sentiment that religious structures were responses to group identification more than religious experiences. As he said as early as 1949, synagogue design “had nothing to do with religion.”81 He could have added that he never aspired to a sense of dignity or poetry. In addition to Goodman’s B’nai Israel, the UAHC book An American Synagogue for Today and Tomorrow features five other synagogues to illustrate varied ways of working within the modern idiom. All of the architects, except one, had some personal Jewish identification.82 The exception was Philip Johnson, whose Kneses Tifereth Israel, in Port Chester, New York, was featured. Johnson’s preliminary plan, dated 1952, is much more spatially complex than the final synagogue, which he began to design the following year. Drawing a rectangle with a large internal court, Johnson proposed that the interior glass walls open into the adjacent auditorium and lounges for the High Holy Days. The chapel is a round room inserted into a separate square space. Johnson’s design is less remarkable than the fact that he was connected with any of the UAHC activities at all. Johnson’s participation, less than two decades after he had shamefully engaged in pro-Nazi propaganda in the United States and Germany, is curious.83 A likely scenario is that the UAHC reached out to Peter Blake, a German Jewish refugee, to edit their book. Blake, who was then associate editor of the influential journal Architectural Forum, had been curator of architecture and design at the Museum\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 25\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\n26 h i s t o r y\n\nof ­Modern Art (1948–50) where Johnson, the director of the MoMA department, had effectively been his boss. It is also possible that Johnson sought inclusion in order to obscure his past. It is more likely, however, that Blake included Johnson in the book because he knew that the taste making of the Museum of Modern Art would have been important to Jews just emerging as postwar patrons. Johnson and architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock had defined modernism for America when they created the “International Style” exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932. Their definition of modernism, based mostly on European examples, was tightly controlled and less inclusive than what the UAHC was promulgating. In addition to the abandonment of historicist ornament, the International Style constituted an emphasis on volumetric space as opposed to mass, standardization of parts, and well-balanced compositions that reveal structure. International Style modernism became an accepted term, and, even more important for synagogues, the UAHC was able to bring its most illustrative (and notorious) promoter into its fold. Transmitting the Message\n\nIn 1957, SACP organized another conference and exhibit on synagogue art and architecture, under the title “The American Synagogue: A Progress Report.” It had been a decade since the formation of the group and its first conferences, and this time the message was clear and direct. Many points of view were expressed, but there was an “unquestioning acceptance of modern functional architecture, with a complete rout of the traditional mode. The battle of styles fought during the last decade has seen the modernists in architecture achieve a complete victory.”84 The UAHC, having orchestrated conferences and publications in 1947, 1953, and 1957, soon reaped rewards for its efforts. By the late 1950s, a number of books had been published that supported the group’s acceptance of a modern vocabulary. In 1955, Rachel Wischnitzer published Synagogue Architecture in the United States: History and Interpretation (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society) a comprehensive historical review. She was the first to attempt a synagogue survey in almost three decades. Wischnitzer, noting what was already a “fact on the ground,” proclaims that American Jews no longer had to adapt what was available locally; they could lead design initiatives. She makes a cogent plea for acceptance of modernism on the justification that it deviated from the contextual styles of the past. To validate\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 26\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 27\n\nher stance (and perhaps to invoke the authority of MoMA), she asked Philip Johnson to write the introduction. It seems probable that Wischnitzer, whose own father had been killed by the Nazis, knew nothing of Johnson’s earlier right-wing dalliances. Synagogues shared in American appraisals of recent religious architecture. Paul Thiry, Richard M. Bennett, and Henry L. Kamphoefner published Churches and Temples in 1953, as part of a series meant to highlight work published in Progressive Architecture (other titles focused on similarly thriving building types: hospitals, retail stores, shopping centers, and schools). Architectural Record came out with its own publication, Religious Buildings for Today, four years later. Synagogues were heavily represented.85 The popular press, primarily general interest magazines, also played a significant role in shaping opinions and acceptance of Jews and their religious buildings. Time and Life, two of the most-read magazines of the 1940s and 1950s, appear to have been keen on covering both synagogue attendance and design. Time ran at least six articles on synagogues in the 1950s; Louis Finkelstein, chancellor of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary, was the subject of the cover article in October 15, 1951.86 The Reform UAHC had promoted modern suburban architecture primarily to congregations within the Reform movement, but it had taken care to include Conservative congregations in its publications and exhibitions; as a result its message was absorbed by the Conservative community and, sometimes, by the Orthodox world as well.87 As the UAHC was reaching out to non-Reform Jews and becoming more architecturally bold, the divisions among the movements, in terms of ritual and observance, were becoming less clear, with Reform congregations becoming more observant in general.88 Reform and Conservative movements approached architecture differently (and still do). The architecture of Reform and Conservative congregations cannot be pegged as one denomination or the other. They differed in how they arrived at modern solutions. Many Reform congregations simply internalized the UAHC message, then vetted architects on their own and proceeded without any direct SACP assistance. Whether they worked with the SACP or not, Reform congregations recognized that their movement set a tone and provided support; individual congregations knew that help was available if they requested it. There was no Conservative equivalent to SACP and no pronouncements about architecture. The United Synagogue (the national coordinating body for Conservative congregations, renamed\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 27\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\n28 h i s t o r y\n\nUnited Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991), a looser network than the UAHC, provided no architectural scaffolds. Member congregations had to rely on the personal interest or vision of their leaders (usually their rabbis) to fill this void. Conservative congregations frequently found that the Reform movement’s advocacy of modernism was suited to them, too.89 Quietly, individual rabbis campaigned for good design and shared their knowledge, defying Percival and Paul Goodman’s assertion that rabbis did not matter in decision making. The Goodmans had simply assumed rabbis were always looking for better pulpits and congregations were always searching for more aggressive leaders.90 Rabbi Levi Olan, the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, had an excellent rapport with his architect, William Wurster. Wurster, the founding dean of the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley, had produced an excellent design with two local Texas architects. The Dallas rabbi then urged his friend Philip Bernstein, a distinguished rabbinical leader in Rochester, to consider Wurster for his upstate New York congregation. Olan also had reached the conclusion that mortgage financing was essential for producing a good building outcome, writing that a synagogue should not “try to build a Temple with the amount that you have on hand. It will make the difference between a distinguished building and an ordinary one.”91 Another Reform rabbi, Norman Gerstenfeld of Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, D.C., learned the value of an outstanding lighting designer and was anxious to share his own epiphany with rabbinical colleagues. Gerstenfeld, writing to the rabbi of the Jewish Community Center of White Plains, New York (a Reform synagogue rather than a secular Jewish community center), who had previously come to inspect the D.C. building while it was under construction, had perceptively wise and sophisticated words for his counterpart: “When you plan your Temple changes[,] may I enthusiastically recommend a lighting genius, affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Richard Kelly, who has done some of the revolutionary applications of modern lighting in some of the leading institutions of the country at a very slight cost. . . . It would be worth your while to drop in to see him in New York and go over your plans with him. Using him would be the best investment you could make.”92 Gerstenfeld understood that architecture was developing subspecialties that could not be ignored. Kelly, in fact, worked independently, but the statement further amplifies how useful it was to invoke MoMA’s authority. Modernism spread, too, because suburban synagogue membership was\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 28\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\nThe Postwar Synagogue 29\n\ngeographically fluid, leading to cross-pollination of ideas between members of the different movements. Jews, who have always acted freely in their affiliations with congregations because there is no equivalent of a Catholic diocese, were now traveling greater distances for worship than they had in the denser urban areas. “Commuting” to a synagogue became a new norm. ­Conservative and Reform congregations in the suburbs looked to nearby communities for members, thereby turning themselves into “area” operations. Congregation Adath Israel, for example, was located in Wynne­wood, Pennsylvania, but served surrounding suburban communities, including Bala Cynwyd, Merion, Narberth, Overbrook Hills, Havertown, Ardmore, and Bryn Mawr.93 Congregation Beth El, in South Orange, New Jersey, dubbed itself “Congregation Beth El of the Oranges and Maplewood.” North Shore Congregation Israel drew members from the Chicago suburbs of Glencoe, Winnetka, Highland Park, and other “nearby villages.” Suburban congregations were delighted to expand their geographic limits in their outreach to potential new members. Surely, Jews must have been aware that their new synagogues were markers of their increasingly bold participation in American life. It is unclear how cognizant they were that their own religious structures were more daring than the churches of their Christian counterparts. Protestant churches, which had provided early leadership in organizing and energizing local religious buildings, failed to deliver a consistent message about postwar design. By 1952, the editors of Architectural Forum indicated that there was “Anarchy in our Churches.”94 They groused that architects were producing shoddy imitations of historical styles; they chastised them for not pursuing a clearcut and progressively hopeful break with the past. Although the architecture and design journals contained frequent entries for churches, one can only imagine how many more examples were not sufficiently interesting to merit publication.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 29\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 30\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:42 PM\n\nDecoration Does It Look Jewish?\n\n2\n\nThe UAHC’s publications did not directly address how it would be possible to construct a modern building with Jewish meaning. Three images of midcentury buildings shown later in this chapter—a synagogue, a church, and a restaurant (see figs. 2.6–2.8)—make it clear that the visual language of modernism can be adapted to diverse uses. In none of these three examples (nor in countless schools of the 1950s) does an A-frame (single or double) construction look out of place. Jews, wanting to celebrate their arrival in the suburbs and ascension into the pantheon of American religions, needed a way to distinguish synagogues from different building types employing a modern vocabulary. Architects found one solution in the integration of decorative arts with Jewish themes into their universal solutions. Modern exteriors showed that Judaism was progressive and American; the decorative programs often echoed those sentiments. Decorations on the interior further reminded congregants that their buildings had a connection to Jewish tradition and that they were leaders in the world of art patronage. Two architects, Pietro Belluschi and William Wurster deserve consideration because of the ways they grappled with the task in the 1950s. A major exhibition, organized at the end of the same decade, brought these concerns to the attention of the general public. Synagogue patrons were, in fact, adding a Jewish component to the blending of architecture, painting, and sculpture that characterized the time. Pietro Belluschi and William Wurster\n\nJewish architects, some identifying themselves as Jewish only by birth, dominated the UAHC events. Philip Johnson was the exception. After his inclusion, the Jewish world began to reach out to academics and practitioners with the highest profiles. Non-Jewish architects Pietro Belluschi and\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 31\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:43 PM\n\n32 d e c o r a t i o n\n\nWilliam Wurster, both of whom operated outside of the UAHC sphere of conferences and publications, were among those tapped for new designs.1 They produced work that was sympathetic with the efforts of the UAHC and in the manner established by Mendelsohn’s work for B’nai Amoona. Both architects commissioned site-specific pieces by sculptors, weavers, and glass designers, many of whom had links to the Bauhaus or other progressive German institutions. The decorative programs actually form a bridge between two types of modernism. They connect Bay Area regionalism, which dwelled on local materials (e.g., wood) for both structure and decoration (and with which Belluschi and Wurster’s names are usually associated), and European modernism, which emphasized universality and an industrial image.2 The Museum of Modern Art, the same institution that had hosted the 1932 exhibition in which Philip Johnson and Henry-­Russell Hitchcock had defined the International Style, had investigated a more humanistic, regionalist modernism as early as 1944.3 While recent scholarship has shown that European émigrés had less of an effect on the adoption of modernism in America than earlier historians had believed, it is possible to make the case that émigrés were critical to synagogue decoration and thus had a specific audience to whom they displayed their craft. Oddly, Belluschi and Wurster’s work on synagogues is hardly praised today. Belluschi’s early career, starting with modest churches in the Pacific Northwest, has been obscured by his later association with the critically reviled Pan Am building in New York.4 Wurster’s reputation is almost exclusively tied to his lovingly crafted private homes, not public spaces. His synagogue work, which consists of only one example, may have been overlooked because he was always credited as “consulting architect” when, in fact, his role was quite substantial. The churches that Belluschi designed in Portland, Oregon, where he practiced from 1925 until 1950, were inspired by Japanese and vernacular building traditions. Wood often doubled as both construction method and inherent decoration. Images of Belluschi’s Zion Lutheran Church (Portland, 1948–50), were widely published and typical of his designs at the time: clear volumes, a steeply pitched wood-shingle roof with a separate hip-roofed wood porch, and a pleasing nave that is decorated largely by its laminated wood trusses and by the pattern of glass blocks set into its brick walls. Belluschi wanted churchgoers to discover his building as they walked through it, hoping that the experience would lead to “spiritual uplift.” He did not hesitate to hire sculptors if their work had architectural integ-\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 32\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:43 PM\n\nDoes It Look Jewish? 33\n\nrity, not mere decorative appeal. At Zion Lutheran Church, for example, Belluschi hired sculptor Frederic Littman to design the repoussé copper interior doors.5 Belluschi attracted synagogue commissions once he moved east and became the dean of the architecture school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His first synagogue was Temple Israel in Swampscott, Massachusetts (1953–56, in association with Carl Koch & Associates).6 The members showed a great deal of sophistication in the way in which they came to Belluschi. They first contacted Chicago architect Ernest Grunsfeld (associated with the large firm Friedman, Alschuler & Sincere), who signed on to advise the members about how to salvage a partially constructed plan that they had abandoned. He claimed that his office had designed more than thirty-five synagogues since 1949.7 Declining the Massachusetts commission for himself, Grunsfeld introduced the congregation to Belluschi (Grunsfeld had been educated at MIT). Grunsfeld made the point that Belluschi could design a building that would be appropriate for a Jewish context and that would also bring pride to the congregation and the surrounding community.8 He argued that a Belluschi building would cost the same as one designed by any other architect, indicating that it would be a simple structure without a lot of customized detail. Grunsfeld persuaded the congregation that good modern design would harmonize with the surroundings. At Temple Israel, Belluschi introduced a hexagonal sanctuary (and an identically shaped chapel below it), topped with a six-sided cupola. Belluschi’s later synagogues (as well as Portsmouth Abbey Church, which he revised after working on Temple Israel) were variations on the polygonal plan and high cupola scheme. Mendelsohn’s legacy can be seen in these highly visible exterior markers of the main interior space and in the attention to nature. At Temple Israel, a pergola stepping back toward the entryway provides access and also creates a forecourt for the sanctuary and auditorium wing, allowing nature to enter the complex. Belluschi, following his client’s wishes, honored Temple Israel’s request for an expandable space.9 He created an arrangement where the hexagonal sanctuary opens up to a transitional lobby and then a deep auditorium, attempting to avoid a series of connected rectangles in creating a large expandable space for the High Holy Days. Belluschi created an intimate, defined space for 250 people in the regular sanctuary; the expanded space, for an additional 1,800, is certainly not homey, but at least it eludes the unrelenting void of a Goodman building during the High Holy festivities.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 33\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:43 PM\n\n34 d e c o r a t i o n\n\nMuch of Temple Israel’s success relies on decoration of the interior, a continuation of practices Belluschi had begun in the Pacific Northwest. The exposed laminated structural wood frames of the sanctuary rise to form the cupola and provide an intricate visual component executed in a low-tech, presumably local material. Belluschi tried to find a way to distinguish his synagogue from church design. He took the Star of David as the inspiration for the hexagonally shaped sanctuary; he planned menorah images on the wood screens of each side of the cupola.10 A Star of David rises over the cupola in a fashion reminiscent of the way a cross would have topped a church steeple. Belluschi turned to sculptor Richard Filipowski to execute the decorative scheme, entrusting him with the ornamental metalwork for the eternal light, the aluminum panel for the ark doors, and a work of sculpture for the wall under the entrance canopy.11 Filipowski’s copper relief sculpture uses an off-center Star of David to generate an abstract pattern of intersecting, overlapping metal strips. The industrial look reveals Filipowski’s strong allegiance to Bauhaus design. He had taught at the Institute of Design before Walter Gropius tapped him, in 1950, to lead the Bauhaus-inspired Design Fundamentals course at Harvard.12 In 1953, after Dean Joseph Hudnut was able to cancel the Harvard course, Belluschi invited Filipowski to MIT “with a promise of tenure.”13 Belluschi’s second synagogue was Temple Adath Israel, dedicated in 1959, in Merion, Pennsylvania, a suburb adjacent to Philadelphia (see fig. 2.1). Like so many other synagogues, Adath Israel was begun by a few families who were looking for a place to worship near their homes. In this particular case, twenty families formed the congregation in 1946. They hired Belluschi to design a sanctuary for their already existing L-shaped religious school and auditorium. He devised a circular sanctuary as well as supplemental space in the form of an irregular, reversed L. The resulting interior space forms an internal court. Mendelsohn’s approach resonates in the design of the garden and the high cupola over the sanctuary.14 At Temple Israel, Belluschi conveyed Jewish content in the six-sided shape, the star over the sanctuary cupola, and Filipowski’s entrance relief sculpture. At Adath Israel, he confronted the same issue by expanding on those imageries. On the exterior, flat brick screens turn the circular structure into a twelve-sided sanctuary that signifies the twelve tribes of Israel and/or the original tent of meeting. On the interior, the roof bracing is in the form of a Star of David; the same star is replicated in the window panels of the\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 34\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:43 PM\n\nDoes It Look Jewish? 35\n\nFigure 2.1.

Both features were seen by critics as heavy-handed, an assessment with which the architect later agreed. He felt that the bracing was “ponderous” and the glazing “overly saturated.”15 This building never did arrive at the decorative high point Belluschi had envisioned. While the building was still in the design phase, in 1957, Belluschi indicated, following Goodman’s lead, that the ark should be the focal point of the sanctuary. He envisioned an “artistic masterpiece” related to the ark, considering as collaborators Adolf Gottlieb, Ibram Lassaw, Theodore Roszak, and “Lipman” [sic, most likely Seymour Lipton], all of whom he described as “Jewish and all great artists and sculptors.”16 He also hoped to enlist Gyorgy Kepes, another artist identified with the Bauhaus, to work on the color scheme.17 It is unclear what stifled those plans. Budget concerns could certainly have been a factor. In the end, the ark was placed in front of a screen made from a gold metal and reinforcing rods. Sculptor K. George Kratina, a New York State artist who was known for figurative church decoration, provided its abstract design. Metal Hebrew letters, which decorate the ark wall, add to the industrial effect and present the Ten Commandments as both text and decoration. These have been freed from\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 35\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:44 PM\n\n36 d e c o r a t i o n\n\nthe ­traditional ­confinement of a biblical tablet and no longer perch over the ark. Adath Israel garnered some fame in its own day. The Architectural League of New York asked the architect to submit it to its Gold Medal Exhibition.18 The Philadelphia chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) commended it for excellence in a religious building, lauding it for fine integration of the arts with the architecture.19 Belluschi had clearly settled on the Star of David as the way “to look Jewish.” Creation of the State of Israel, with a blue Star of David as its symbol on its flag, may have spurred its use. Few artists or congregants probably realized that it was not a symbol with an ancient lineage; it had only a short history, especially in synagogue decoration. The Star of David did not appear on American sanctuaries until the mid-nineteenth century, was not linked with Judaism until the sixteenth century, and was not seen on European synagogues until the seventeenth century.20 And yet, for midcentury America, it became the favored means of conveying Jewish content. What began as a stately symbol soon became trite. Percival Goodman, for example, who had used a simple dignified Star of David on the exterior and interior at his Millburn synagogue, began to exploit it there­after as a decorative tool. Goodman placed a Star of David on a steeple-like arrangement over the chapel of Temple Beth El (1950–53) in Springfield, Massachusetts. He abstracted the star for the grille work on the sanctuary windows. Goodman’s window screens at Temple Beth Sholom, Miami Beach (1953–54), are composed entirely of a pattern formed by replicating the star. By reproducing the star in a ornamental pattern, both Belluschi and Goodman showed that it could quickly lose significance by becoming a repetitive motif. Another alternative, one tried by Marcel Breuer, was to use the Star of David as a floor plan. Breuer did that at Westchester Reform Temple (1957–59) in Scarsdale, New York, where the resulting building looks contrived. While Belluschi was working on his first two synagogues, William Wurster, regarded as “the most prominent architect of his generation” was trying his own hand at synagogue design.21 Wurster’s synagogue, Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, was widely recognized at the time of its completion in 1957 and remained a critical favorite into the 1960s.22 Before taking the commission, Wurster had never attended a Jewish service, a shortcoming he did not rectify until 1955, when he accompanied landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to San Francisco’s grand Temple Emanu-El.23 For the Dallas project, Wurster worked with two local practitioners, Howard Meyer and Max Sandfield. They became associated for this project.\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 36\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:44 PM\n\nDoes It Look Jewish? 37\n\nMeyer, the more accomplished of the two, is considered a leader in bringing modernism to Dallas in the 1930s. He had graduated from Columbia University in the late 1920s. Sandfield, who moved to Dallas in 1945, had graduated from MIT in 1925. Despite his title of consulting architect, Wurster’s role should not be dismissed as minimal. When the building was completed, the congregation decided that Wurster, who was the final authority on major decisions, had been “underpaid for what he did, and the Temple made a very substantial gift to him in addition to what he got from his contract with the architects.”24 Wurster, then, belongs to what must surely be a tiny fraternity of architects who have clients who appreciate their efforts and are willing to compensate them properly for their professionalism, whatever the terms of their contracts. Prior to hiring Wurster, Meyer, and Sandfield, Temple Emanu-El had become familiar with several distinguished architects. The congregation began its architectural quest in 1950. Their site was a difficult one on steep terrain. In June of that year, the synagogue president contacted the architecture deans at MIT and at Harvard. Wurster, most likely still the dean at MIT before his departure to Berkeley later that year, recommended Eric Mendelsohn, Eero Saarinen, or Max Abramovitz.25 Joseph Hudnut, then dean at Harvard, made the same suggestions. The Emanu-El board, perhaps swayed by Mendelsohn’s position as the premier designer of American synagogues, quickly encouraged his work. He produced preliminary drawings, but they did not excite the Emanu-El leaders, who subsequently let Mendelsohn go and sought a new site. Relations between the client and architect must have stayed cordial, because the congregation returned to Mendelsohn after they secured a new seventeen-acre site in 1952.26 By then, time was of the essence. The congregation had purchased the acreage at reduced cost. The seller had stipulated that the buildings be dedicated to religion or education, that they be brick or stone, and that the congregation spend at least $500,000 on construction by January 1, 1956. The congregation focused on Mendelsohn and Saarinen as potential architects.27 Saarinen made a major presentation in June 1952.28 He was already working on his chapel for MIT, for which Wurster had also recommended him.29 In Dallas, he talked about developing a prototype with local materials and responding to climactic conditions.30 Before a choice was made, other architects expressed hopes of winning the commission for themselves. In addition to local architects Meyer and Sandfield, Harry Prince,\n\nSolomon - Lewis I Kahn.indb 37\n\n7 May 2009 2:13:44 PM\n\n38 d e c o r a t i o n\n\nwho led the SACP, did not seem to hesitate to present his own credentials.31 The Temple committee also investigated Percival Goodman, who, with a job in Tulsa and relatives in Shreveport, Louisiana, was happy to come at his own expense.32 In the end, Meyer and Sandfield, both members of the congregation, gained the commission, and they suggested Wurster as their colleague.33 Emanu-El members were open to progressive thought, including modern architecture. During a time of heightened suburbanization, Temple Emanu-El was (and remains) an anomaly. Like many contemporary institutions, it had been set to follow its members, who had been relocating to the northern section of the city since the late 1930s.34 But Dallas is a suburbanized city; many of the outlying suburbs, including the one to which Emanu-El finally relocated, are within the city limits. Without a clear divide between city and country and with only a short commute to downtown, many members were active in sophisticated civic institutions, such as the museum and the symphony, and were actively engaged with modern design.
