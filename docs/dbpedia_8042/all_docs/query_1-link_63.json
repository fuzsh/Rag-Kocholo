It means: extreme\n\ncraziness. If you’re lucky it means: seeing the contributions increase every time you\n\nturn away from your computer. And then it means: scrambling to figure out what\n\nother cool stuff you can offer to your backers.\n\nFor the first week of the Kickstarter, I could barely catch my breath. Every\n\nmorning, I awoke to a barrage of new questions — about the book, about its logis-\n\ntics, and about what we could offer next. Thanks to the tremendous interest in the\n\nDesigners & Dragons Kickstarter, we were forced to think about what we could\n\npublish later in the year and also what we might be doing a year or two down the\n\nroad.\n\nThis Platinum Appendix to Designers & Dragons is the first result. It’s our\n\nthanks to you for supporting Designers & Dragons.\n\nThe Kickstarter had one other great result: it put us in contact with fans who\n\nwere interested in the history of the industry and with people who could tell us\n\nmore about that history. So within you’ll find a history of the thief and one of\n\nthe first third-party D&D supplements, thanks to Daniel Wagner, who joined the\n\nKickstarter and offered to tell me about the Aurania Gang. You’ll also find three\n\nvery special histories — about women in the industry, about the Hero Auxiliary\n\nCorps, and about my own gaming group — all thanks to Platinum Dragon patrons\n\nwho wanted to learn more and to see those stories committed to paper before they\n\nwere lost.\n\nAs promised, this Appendix also contains the yearly histories of the industry\n\nthat I’ve written at RPGnet over the last six years. When added to the four topical\n\nhistories, these yearly reviews bring the word count of this Platinum Appendix up\n\nto 30,000 words — somewhere between 20% and 25% of the total length of one\n\nof the printed Designers & Dragons volumes. Not bad for a couple of months’ work\n\n— and years and years of research before that, of course.\n\nSo once more, my thanks to you — as backers, as historical sources, and as\n\npatrons who asked for more. Because of your support for Designers & Dragons, this\n\nPlatinum Appendix will not be the end; you’ll see more from me about the history\n\nof the industry in the future.\n\nWatch this space in two or three years’ time.\n\nShannon Appelcline\n\nOctober 31, 2014\n\nPart One:\n\nGame Designers\n\n(An Industry Trend)\n\nA s the name suggests, Designers & Dragons is about the people who create\n\ngames. They appear throughout all four volumes — from Gary Gygax\n\nand Dave Arneson to the newest creators in the ‘10s. However, those\n\ndesigners aren’t a homogeneous whole. Instead, they fall into many categories\n\n— united by history, interests, or innate characteristics.\n\nThe old guard was one of the first groups to distinguish itself, as designers\n\nfrom the earliest roleplaying publishers created new companies of their own.\n\nSoon afterward, storytelling designers began to explore new ground in games\n\nlike Paranoia (1984) and King Arthur Pendragon (1985). Eventually this\n\ntrend led to the indie designers of the modern day, who are creating games\n\nlike Sorcerer (2001) and Fiasco (2009) — many of which are totally unlike the\n\nfantasy roleplaying games that dominated the early industry.\n\nRoleplaying designers also come from a variety of backgrounds. There are\n\nhistories to be written of how diverse designers have impacted the industry.\n\nHowever, during the Kickstarter for Designers & Dragons, one of the questions\n\nbackers asked most was about the role of women in the gaming industry. So in\n\nthis section, you’ll find a history of female designers, which offers a different\n\naspect of the history of the gaming industry.\n\nDesigners Years First RPG Page\n\nWomen 1975-Present Alarums & Excursions #1 (1975) 5\n\nin the Roleplaying Industry\n\nThe Old Guard 1980-Present The Space Gamer #27 (1980) ‘80s: 315\n\nStorytelling Games 1984-Present Paranoia (1984) ‘00s: 137\n\nThis history courtesy of Platinum Dragons Janelle Cooper and Jacq Jones and the\n\nWomen & Gaming Forum of BGG.\n\nWomen in the\n\nRoleplaying Industry:\n\n1974-Present\n\nAlthough the roleplaying industry has had a well-deserved reputation for being\n\nmale-dominated since its earliest days, women have always been involved as\n\nplayers, as writers, as designers, and in a variety of other roles. Through the decades,\n\ntheir impact and involvement has grown and evolved.\n\nFemale Players in the 1975: Alarums & Excursions #1\n\nIndustry: 1974–1979\n\nBefore looking at the role of women in the\n\nroleplaying industry, we should first con-\n\nsider the role of women in roleplaying —\n\nespecially in its earliest days.\n\nRPG historian Jon Peterson began his\n\nown look at the topic with a reminder that\n\nroleplaying evolved from an extremely\n\nmale-dominated hobby: miniatures warga-\n\nming. Peterson says that Strategy & Tactics\n\n(1967-Present) surveys showed as few as\n\n6 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\n0.5% of wargamers were female. This was the state of the industry when Dungeons\n\n& Dragons (1974) first appeared.\n\nThough it evolved from wargaming, roleplaying offered something in addition\n\nto warfare. Its focus on individual characters appealed to a wider variety of players,\n\nincluding more women. Gary Gygax, in The Dragon #22 (April 1979), opined that\n\n“at least 10% of the players are female!”\n\nHowever, surveys, referee lists, and con attendance from the period show lower\n\nnumbers than Gygax’s estimate, as reported in Shared Fantasy: Role-Playing Games\n\nas Social Worlds (1983), Dr. Gary Alan\n\nFine’s analysis of the young roleplaying\n\nindustry. Among the earliest contributors\n\nto the roleplaying industry, The Space\n\nGamer offered the lowest estimate of\n\nfemale fans, with just 0.4% of its respon-\n\ndents (two people) being women — but\n\nunlike many of its contemporaries, The\n\nSpace Gamer maintained a strong focus on\n\nscience-fiction and fantasy wargames, not\n\nRPGs, which may explain the difference. A\n\nJudges Guild survey reported 2.3%, while\n\nFine estimated that 3.8% of players from\n\na referee’s list in The Dragon were women.\n\nFinally, con attendance records showed that\n\nabout 5% of attendees at Origins ’78 and a\n\ncontemporary Gen Con were women.\n\n“I offer three explanations for women’s lack of involvement: characteristics of\n\nwomen; the process of recruitment into the gaming world; and reactions of men\n\nto the presence of women and female characters in the gaming scenario.”\n\n— Gary Alan Fine, Shared Fantasy: Role-Playing Games as Social Worlds (1983)\n\nThe precise numbers of female players probably lay somewhere between the\n\nestimates of Gygax and Fine. Women playing at the time report that magazine\n\nsubscriptions were sometimes in the names of their husbands or children, which\n\nmight have led to them not participating in those magazines’ surveys, and that\n\nthey often stayed home with children while their husbands attended a convention.\n\nThat leaves us with an estimate of female players being between 5% and 10% of all\n\nroleplayers in the late ‘70s.\n\nSo what did that mean for women in the industry?\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 7\n\nFemale Pioneers in the Industry: 1975–1986\n\nLee Gold was the industry’s first female star and in the ‘70s she was one of the ten\n\nor so most important people in the roleplaying field. She’d been a science-fiction\n\nand fantasy fan since junior high, then joined the roleplaying hobby in 1974 when\n\nher friends — Owen and Hilda Hannifen from San Francisco — shared their copy\n\nof D&D with her.\n\nThe Hannifens and Gold were all members of the Amateur Press Association\n\n(APA) of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. The Hannifens soon began\n\nsharing stories about Dungeons & Dragons here, but non-roleplayers in the APA\n\nasked the D&D enthusiasts to start up a distribution of their own. Meanwhile,\n\nGold was worried about the increasing divergence between different groups’ D&D\n\ngames and the “culture shock” that it could cause if someone tried to join a new\n\ngroup. These factors led Gold to start Alarums & Excursions (1975-Present), an\n\nAPA that freed the Science Fiction Society from talk of D&D and gave gamers the\n\nopportunity to form a culture around the game.\n\n“When I was a girl, I had Chainmail\n\nAnd a three-book boxed D&D set,\n\nAnd I used all the Platonic solids\n\nTo determine what monsters I’d get.”\n\n— Lee Gold, Filker Up #6 (2009)\n\nA&E was a milestone in the history of roleplaying. With its publication in June\n\n1975, it became the earliest periodical solely dedicated to roleplaying games —\n\npredating even TSR’s Dragon (1976–2007). It’s also the most long-lived roleplay-\n\ning periodical, having missed just two months of publication in almost 40 years.\n\nOver those years, A&E has featured a lot of all-star contributors, including Gary\n\nGygax, Edward Simbalist, Wilf Backhaus, Dave Hargrave, Steve Perrin, Jonathan\n\nTweet, Robin D. Laws, and Rob Heinsoo. It deserves a history of its own, and\n\nthat’s thanks to Lee Gold.\n\nJennell Jaquays didn’t face the same challenges entering the RPG field as Gold,\n\nbecause at the time she was writing under the name Paul Jaquays. Nonetheless,\n\ntoday we can recognize her as another influential woman in the early industry. She\n\nstarted out by creating The Dungeoneer (1976) magazine, where she wrote some\n\nof the industry’s earliest adventures. She then authored numerous groundbreaking\n\nworks for Judges Guild and Chaosium starting in 1979. Like the other women of\n\nthe time, she offered a unique perspective on the industry.\n\n8 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nThough Gold and Jaquays entered the industry on their own, Dr. Gary Alan\n\nFine’s studies suggest that, in the ‘70s, the majority of women were recruited\n\ninto roleplaying by a husband or boyfriend. Similarly, many of the earliest female\n\ndesigners appeared in the industry as the co-authors of books written with a sig-\n\nnificant other.\n\nThe earliest of these co-authored books were all third-party D&D supplements.\n\nThe Character Archaic (1975), and early adventures Palace of the Vampire Queen\n\n(1976) and The Misty Isles (1977) were co-authored by Judith Kerestan of Wee\n\nWarriors; Quest for the Fazzlewood (1978), published by Metro Detroit Gamers,\n\nwas co-authored by Laurie Van De Graaf; Rahasia (1979) and Pharaoh (1980)\n\nby DayStar West Media were co-authored\n\nby Laura Hickman, who also contributed\n\nto a few later TSR projects; Carse (1980)\n\nand Jonril (1982) from Midkemia Press\n\nwere co-authored by April Abrams; and\n\nThe Dragon Tree Spell Book (1981), The\n\nHandbook of Tricks and Traps (1981), and\n\na few others from Dragon Tree Press were\n\nco-authored by Mary Ezzell.\n\nThe first major roleplaying supplement\n\nauthored entirely by a woman appears to\n\nbe Flying Buffalo’s Tunnels & Trolls Solo\n\nAdventure #3: Labyrinth (1978), by Lillian\n\n“Lee” Russell. Flying Buffalo was one of the\n\nearliest roleplaying companies to reach out\n\nto female designers; Liz Danforth joined the\n\ncompany in 1978 as an editor for Sorcerer’s\n\nApprentice magazine (1978–1983). Over\n\nthe next five years, Flying Buffalo’s magazine\n\nlargely represented her vision.\n\nAs the ‘70s faded into the ‘80s, women\n\ndesigners moved from producing supple-\n\nments to producing roleplaying games of\n\ntheir own. Liz Danforth’s fifth-edition\n\nupdate of Ken St. Andre’s Tunnels & Trolls\n\n(1979) marked a major revamp of the rules\n\nthat would be the standard for decades\n\nthereafter. Supergame (1980) was co-written\n\nby Aimée Karklyn and her significant other.\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 9\n\nLee Gold pioneered the way for female solo\n\ndesign with two roleplaying games. Land of the\n\nRising Sun (1980) was based on the rules from\n\nChivalry & Sorcery (1977), but the historical\n\nLands of Adventure (1983) was a wholly original\n\neffort. They were both published by FGU.\n\nA few small press RPGs with female authors\n\narrived in the early ‘80s, like Wizards’ Realm (1981)\n\nfrom Mystic Swamp, which was co-authored by\n\nCheryl Duval. However, it wasn’t until deep in\n\nthe ‘80s that more appeared, such as Pacesetter’s\n\nSandman (1985), which was co-authored by\n\nAndria Hayday, and Chaosium’s Hawkmoon\n\n(1986), a solo effort by Kerie Campbell.\n\nThese early roleplaying designs were some-\n\nwhat unusual for the industry at the time. Not\n\nonly did they feature relatively few monster-bash-\n\ning dungeon crawls, but Gold’s RPGs included\n\none of the first Asian-influenced fantasy RPGs\n\nand an early historical fantasy, while Campbell’s\n\nwas a licensed science-fantasy game.\n\nSadly, these games designed and written by\n\nwomen were also quite scarce. It was a sign of\n\nthe times — a trend that was a reflection of the\n\nemployee demographics at industry leader TSR.\n\nFemale Pioneers atTSR:1978–1997\n\nIt took a few years for TSR to consider\n\nfemale creators, and even then the process\n\nbegan with an external writer: Gary Gygax\n\nran a D&D game for Andre Norton so that\n\nshe could write Quag Keep (1978), an unof-\n\nficial D&D novel that was the industry’s\n\nfirst.\n\nThings got going at TSR proper late in\n\n1978, when Gary Gygax was thinking about\n\ncreating an in-house Design Department.\n\nHe began talking with a potential female\n\nrecruit: a D&D player named Jean Wells.\n\n10 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nGygax flew her out to Wisconsin in January 1979 and decided she was a good fit;\n\nhe announced her hire in The Dragon #24 (April 1979).\n\nThough Wells was a D&D player and a romance writer, she didn’t have any\n\nexperience with rules design and development. The plan was for Gygax to teach\n\nher, but he was too busy by the time she arrived, and Wells was afraid to ask anyone\n\nelse. This was the first of several obstacles she faced as TSR’s first female designer.\n\n“He was hiring my imagination and would teach me the rest.”\n\n— Jean Wells, “Interview: Jean Wells (Part I),” Grognardia (2010)\n\nWells soon ran into another problem: a male-dominated culture. At first other\n\nstaff members wouldn’t even let her play in D&D games; when they relented, they\n\ninitially insisted she play male characters. Unfortunately, this dismissive attitude\n\nwas still obvious decades later when one of Wells’ former coworkers described her\n\nas “large, insecure, brashly outgoing, and outspoken” — a mélange of adjectives\n\nthat probably would not have been applied to a man.\n\nDespite these problems, Wells made a number of notable contributions to\n\nD&D from 1979–1982. She wrote an uncredited section in the Dungeon Masters\n\nGuide (1979) and became the original sage of D&D’s “Sage Advice” rules column,\n\nanswering questions from The Dragon #31 (November 1979) through Dragon\n\n#42 (October 1980). Her character Ceatitle can be found in the original Rogues\n\nGallery (1980), and she was an editor for several early products, including B2:\n\nThe Keep on the Borderlands (1981). Her artwork can also be found in a few early\n\npublications, including the third (1979) and later printings of the Monster Manual\n\n(1977) — which include her drawings of four monsters that had previously been\n\nmissing pictures: the eye of the deep, the\n\ngiant Sumatran rat, the otyugh, and (prob-\n\nably) the violet fungi.\n\nHowever, for better or for worse, Wells\n\nis best known for the original B3: Palace\n\nof the Silver Princess (1981), which she\n\nprepared with help from editor Ed Sollers.\n\nUnfortunately, after it came back from the\n\nprinters, Lawrence Schick and/or Kevin\n\nBlume decided that the module wasn’t\n\nacceptable. A number of reasons have been\n\noffered over the years. Some claim that it\n\nwasn’t edited sufficiently because of Wells’\n\nrelationship with Gygax. Others state that\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 11\n\nit was “mediocre.” Wells said she got called\n\nout over S&M elements (though neither she\n\nnor Sollers knew what S&M was). There were\n\nalso issues with Erol Otus’ drawings — for\n\nhis personal interpretation of things in the\n\nadventure, for his risqué depictions of those\n\nthings, and for his inclusion of in-jokes.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the printed module\n\nwas mostly trashed and a new version was\n\nproduced by Tom Moldvay.\n\nThe problems with Palace largely meant\n\nthe end of Wells’ design career; she was\n\nconfined to secretarial work. Though she\n\nproposed a supplement for Top Secret (1980)\n\ncalled “L.A.S.S.” and created a prototype of a space travel board game, she wasn’t\n\nallowed to pursue their further development. Shortly thereafter, Wells married Top\n\nSecret supplement author Corey Koebernick and left TSR.\n\nIn TSR’s later life, its design staff was almost entirely male, but women were\n\ninfluential at the company in other roles. This was common in the roleplaying\n\nindustry in the ‘80s, where women were credited as editors or managers instead of\n\ndesigners or developers. At TSR, four women involved with book publication in\n\nthe ‘80s proved especially crucial to the future of the company.\n\nRose Estes worked in advertising at TSR, but came up with the idea for fantasy\n\nchoose-your-own-adventure books. She was given a green light on the project, and\n\nimmediately wrote the first four Endless Quest books, beginning with Dungeon of\n\nDread (1982). The books were wildly successful, with the first six books selling mil-\n\nlions. James Ward said, “We got more mail about them than about the D&D game.”\n\nHowever, TSR was concerned that the Endless Quest\n\nbooks were a fad, so it used their success to diversify,\n\ncreating an Education Department that was intended\n\nto produce classroom modules. This new department\n\nwas overseen by Rose Estes, James Ward, and new hire\n\nJean Blashfield Black, who had been writing and editing\n\nscience books since the ‘60s. Unfortunately, this new ini-\n\ntiative didn’t work out: the Education Department com-\n\npleted three classrooms modules, but couldn’t get them\n\nto market. Meanwhile, the Endless Quests books were\n\nstill selling well in 1983, so the decision was made to put\n\neven more focus on books. The Education Department\n\n12 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nbecame the Book Department, overseen by Jean Black — though it was still called\n\nthe Education Department for a while.\n\nEnter Margaret Weis, hired by Jean Black as an editor for the “Book”\n\nDepartment. Weis became involved with Tracy Hickman’s Dragonlance project,\n\nwhich was to be the source of the Book Department’s first novel. Weis felt that\n\nshe and Hickman could produce better Dragonlance novels than an established\n\nauthor, and Black gave them a chance to audition when TSR’s tiny royalty offers\n\ndidn’t hook a published author who could properly do the job. On the strength of\n\nWeis and Hickman’s sample chapters, Black gave them the job of writing the first\n\nDragonlance trilogy.\n\nTheir first book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight (1984),\n\ntook several months to catch on, but then it became\n\nanother hit. By this time the Endless Quest books had\n\nindeed faded; the series ended with the 36th book, Song\n\nof the Dark Druid (1986), but by that time Black was\n\nproducing best-selling novels. Meanwhile, Weis briefly\n\ncrossed over into game design, co-authoring Dragonlance\n\nAdventures (1987); though TSR produced 13 hardcover\n\nbooks for AD&D 1e, this was the only one that credited\n\na woman as a major designer.\n\nBlack left TSR in 1988, and book editor Mary\n\nKirchoff replaced her as the new head of the department.\n\nShe’d once been a classmate of Ernie Gygax, but her cre-\n\native portfolio was even more impressive. She was a former editor of Polyhedron\n\nmagazine (1981–2004) and the author of a few Endless Quest books starting with\n\nLight on Quests Mountain (1983). It was also Kirchoff who found a book called\n\nEchoes of the Fourth Magic in the Book Department’s slush pile and was intrigued\n\nenough to work with author R.A. Salvatore on a new book called The Crystal\n\nShard (1988). Kirchoff oversaw the Book Department through 1992, by which\n\ntime its books were regularly hitting best-seller lists. She also wrote a few novels of\n\nher own, beginning with Kendermore (1989). She’d later return as Wizards of the\n\nCoast’s VP of Publishing from 1997–2004.\n\nJust as the Book Department was taking off thanks to the initial work of Estes,\n\nBlack, and Weis, TSR’s most influential female employee came on stage: Lorraine\n\nWilliams. She arrived at TSR in 1985 as a manager and potential investor, but\n\nby the end of the year had taken control of the company away from Gary Gygax.\n\nShe’s received mixed reviews over the years for how she ran TSR. However, for\n\nover a decade, from 1986–1997, she was clearly the most important woman in\n\nroleplaying.\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 13\n\nMany other women played vital roles at TSR in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Among them\n\nwere Art Director Ruth Hoyer and editors and project managers like Anne Brown,\n\nMichele Carter, Sue Weinlein Cook, Andria Hayday, Dori Hein, Miranda Horner,\n\nJulia Martin, Karen Martin (later Karen Boomgarden and Karen Conlin), Anne\n\nGray McCready, Penny Petticord (later Penny Williams), Jean Rabe, Cindi Rice,\n\nand Barbara Young.\n\nThough TSR’s in-house designers were mostly men, some of these editors also\n\ndid crucial design work. McCready was one of the first, writing early adventures\n\nlike CM5: Mystery of the Snow Pearls (1985), RS1: Red Sonja Unconquered (1986),\n\nand GAZ4: The Kingdom of Ierendi (1987). Brown also wrote the occasional book\n\n— focusing particularly on Greyhawk, from WGA1: Falcon’s Revenge (1990) to\n\nGreyhawk Player’s Guide (1998).\n\nJean Rabe was even more prolific, contributing to over a dozen supplements for\n\nTSR in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, starting with C6: The Official RPGA Tournament\n\nHandbook (1987). She moved on to write over a dozen novels for TSR beginning\n\nwith Dragonlance’s The Dawning of a New Age (1996). In addition, she ran the\n\nRPGA for seven years, edited Polyhedron, and oversaw much of the Gen Con\n\nGame Fair.\n\nSome editors never wrote books of their own, but nonetheless contributed\n\nextensively to their editorial projects. Andria Hayday, who worked at Pacesetter\n\nbetween two different stints at TSR, offers one example. She provided vital content\n\nfor two of the earliest AD&D 2e settings, Ravenloft: Realm of Terror (1990) and\n\nAl-Qadim: Arabian Adventures (1992). Her work on Arabian Adventures included\n\noverseeing art and design and writing the background material on Al-Qadim,\n\nwhich was moved to the front of the book due to its high quality.\n\nDori Hein was similarly crucial to the creation of the Planescape Campaign\n\nSetting (1994), while Sue Cook contributed to Dragonlance: Fifth Age (1996).\n\nCindi Rice edited the Ravenloft line in its final days and contributed to a few of\n\nthe last books.\n\nBarbara Young is another of TSR’s best-known editors. She briefly worked at\n\nTSR as a game editor from 1984 to 1985, before succumbing to a layoff, but then\n\nrejoined TSR in 1987 as an assistant editor to Roger E. Moore on Dungeon mag-\n\nazine. She started with #4 (March/April 1987), then took over as editor with #9\n\n( January/February 1988), a role she kept until #51 ( January/February 1995). She\n\nwas largely responsible for the feel of Dungeon during its first decade of existence.\n\nShe was also a mentor to Wolfgang Baur, who went on to fame of his own. Young\n\nlater moved on to become the newest head of TSR’s Book Department. Dungeon\n\nhad another female editor during its last days at TSR: Michelle Vuckovich.\n\n14 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nAlthough female editors were much more common than female designers at\n\nTSR in the ‘80s, this began to change in the ‘90s, as TSR began taking many more\n\nfreelance manuscripts, resulting in work from Ann Dupuis, Lisa Smedman, and\n\nTeeuwynn Woodruff. But by then the rest of the industry was changing too.\n\nCorporate Heroines: 1980–2000\n\nThe rest of the industry largely reflected the situation at TSR in the ‘80s and ‘90s.\n\nSome women were writing roleplaying products — such as Steve Jackson Games\n\nauthor Elizabeth McCoy and West End Games author Jen Seiden, a second-gen-\n\neration employee who followed in her father’s footsteps. Their numbers increased\n\nwith the decades, with many more entering the field than can be recorded here.\n\nWomen were also becoming more integral to companies in other roles — some\n\nof them quite innovative, such as Sue Grau’s work organizing the Hero Auxiliary\n\nCorps to support Hero Games.\n\nWomen’s importance to the industry was also reflected by an increasing number\n\nof women helping to found companies, either as executives or as foundational\n\nmembers. Women were instrumental in founding companies from the beginning,\n\nbut in the ‘70s and the early ‘80s, it had been more common for women to create\n\ncompanies with their significant others: the Kerestans founded Wee Warriors\n\n(1975), the Hickmans founded DayStar West Media (1979), the Abrams were\n\namong the founders of Midkemia Press (1979), and the Ezzells founded Dragon\n\nTree Press (1981). By the ‘80s, the “significant other” effect was fading in gaming\n\ngroups and throughout the roleplaying industry.\n\nICE (1980) led the way for this new type of gaming company: Heike Kubash\n\nwas one of its foundational members. She also co-authored the company’s first\n\nMiddle-earth sourcebook, Angmar: Land of\n\nthe Witch King (1982), then wrote their first\n\nMiddle-earth adventure book, Bree and the\n\nBarrow Downs (1984). Many years later she\n\nwas President of Mjolnir, the second incar-\n\nnation of ICE, and the co-author of HARP:\n\nHigh Adventure Role Playing (2003).\n\nPerhaps Middle-earth’s familiarity outside\n\nof gaming made it feel more welcoming for\n\nwomen, because several others followed\n\nKubasch: Brenda Gates Spielman wrote\n\nUmbar: Haven of the Corsairs (1982),\n\nSusan Tyler Hitchcock authored Southern\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 15\n\nMirkwood: Haunt of the Necromancer (1983), and Jessica M. Ney worked on\n\nseveral projects from 1988–1993.\n\nOther companies followed in ICE’s footsteps. Janet Trautvetter was one of the\n\nfounding members of Gamelords (1980), where she contributed to The Free City\n\nof Haven (1981) and many others. Kristie Fields, Patty Fugate, and Nancy Parker\n\nwere all founding members of Digest Group Publications (1985). Pacesetter\n\n(1984) was one of the more notable RPG start-ups of this period for its high\n\nlevel of professionalism; we’ve already met one of its founding designers, Andria\n\nHayday — the co-author of Pacesetter’s Sandman and a mover and shaker at TSR.\n\nThough Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein•Hagen created Lion Rampant (1987),\n\nLisa Stevens and Nicole Lindroos were early volunteers. These two then became\n\nfounding members of White Wolf (1990), and later went on to even more import-\n\nant roles in the industry.\n\nWhite Wolf deserves additional comment, in part because its LARPs, such as\n\nThe Masquerade (1993), are widely credited with increasing the number of women\n\nparticipating in roleplaying games. White Wolf also employed a comparatively\n\nlarge proportion of female designers over the years — by the ‘00s their online\n\nwriters’ bios included 11 women out of 28 total designers.\n\nMany women moved through the design halls of White Wolf. Kathleen Ryan\n\nwas an author and graphic designer for Mage: The Ascension (1993). Jackie Cassada\n\nand Nicky Rea were frequent authors and also the line editors for Changeling: The\n\nDreaming (1995) and White Wolf ’s Ravenloft (2002). Similarly, designer Jennifer\n\nHartshorn line edited Vampire: The Masquerade (1991) and Wraith: The Oblivion\n\n(1994), while designer Deird’re Brooks line edited WarCraft: The Roleplaying\n\nGame (2003). Genevieve Cogman was one of the authors of Orpheus (2003), while\n\nHeather Heckel, Angel Leigh McCoy, Deena McKinney, and Cynthia Summers\n\nall contributed to core White Wolf rulebooks. Other White Wolf authors include\n\nElizabeth Ditchburn Dew, Heather Grove, Sheri M. Johnson, Ellen Kiley, Judith\n\nMcLaughlin, J. Porter Wiseman, and Lindsay Woodcock. In the modern era,\n\nauthors like Dana Habecker and Jess Hartley continue the trend.\n\nThree other companies from the ‘90s deserve special note in this history of\n\nwomen in the roleplaying industry.\n\nFirst, Wizards of the Coast (1990) brought on Lisa Stevens as their first paid\n\nemployee after her stints at Lion Rampant and White Wolf — a reflection of the\n\nindustry experience she’d by then accrued. Stevens was a crucial member of the\n\nWizards team in the ‘90s, suggesting early RPG acquisitions like Talislanta (1987)\n\nand Ars Magica (1987) and later becoming the brand manager of TSR properties\n\nlike the RPGA, Greyhawk, and the d20 Star Wars game.\n\n16 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nSecond, Grey Ghost Press (1995) was\n\ncreated by former TSR freelancer Ann\n\nDupuis. It was the first major roleplaying\n\ncompany founded solely by a woman — and\n\nan important one because it introduced\n\nFUDGE (1994) to a much larger audience.\n\nAs a result, some now call Dupuis “the found-\n\ning mother of indie gaming.”\n\nThird, Sovereign Press (1998) was\n\nco-founded by Don Perrin and Margaret\n\nWeis — who later revamped the company as\n\nMargaret Weis Productions (2004). The fact\n\nthat Weis has enough recognition that her\n\nname is a draw shows how much things have\n\nchanged since the ‘70s.\n\nFrom ICE to Sovereign Press, women were more important than ever to role-\n\nplaying companies, and that trend would only improve in the ‘00s.\n\nWomen in the Hobbyist Gaming Industry: 1975-Present\n\nFemale professionals in the hobbyist board and card game industry followed roughly\n\nthe same pattern as the roleplaying industry: they were scarce in the ‘70s, but\n\ngradually filled a variety of professional roles as the years went on. The popularity\n\nof a revolutionary new type of game — the eurogame — brought an influx of female\n\nplayers and designers to the field.\n\nThe earliest professional hobby game designer was Linda Mosca, a staff member\n\nfor SPI in the mid-‘70s, which means she predated the roleplaying industry’s first\n\nfemale designer by a few years. Mosca published three wargames between 1975\n\nand 1977. Battle of the Wilderness (1975) was a Civil War game and Rocroi (1976)\n\nwas a Thirty Years War game — and one of SPI’s famous “quad” games. Mosca’s final\n\ngame, co-authored with Richard Berg, was Gondor (1977), one of SPI’s legendary\n\n“Games of Middle-earth.”\n\nIn the years since, several other women have left their mark on the wargaming\n\nfield, among them SPI author Virginia Mulholland, West End Games president\n\nHelena Rubinstein, 3W author Laura Cochran, GMT author Kai Jensen, and the\n\naward-winning Rachel Simmons.\n\nHowever, it was the advent of eurogames that really revolutionized the hobbyist\n\ngaming field, giving women a new chance to shine. You can date the eurogame field\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 17\n\nThe Modern Woman: 2000-Present\n\nThe roleplaying field still has a long way to go before it becomes gender bal-\n\nanced. Wizards of the Coast did a survey of 20,000 households in 1999 that\n\nsaid that women still accounted for just 19% of players — which is nonetheless\n\nan increase of two to four times in 20 years. In a survey of other sources from\n\n2004–2011, RPG scientist Christopher Brace found numbers as low as 16% and\n\nas high as 34%.\n\n“The absence of women is not an accident of fate, nor is it something that will\n\nlikely change rapidly.”\n\n— Gary Alan Fine, Shared Fantasy: Role-Playing Games as Social Worlds (1983)\n\nHowever, since 1999 the opportunities for female designers have increased,\n\nthanks in large part to the two major trends of the ‘00s: d20 and indie games.\n\nback to Germany’s creation of the Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) award in 1978.\n\nHowever, it really took off as its own style of design in the ‘90s, following the release\n\nof Klaus Teuber’s The Settlers of Catan (1995).\n\nThe eurogame field was unique because it had very different aesthetics from\n\nthe hobbyist games then found in the United States. Warfare was almost entirely\n\nabsent from eurogames, which also featured tight mechanics and shorter gameplay.\n\nIn Germany, eurogames are explicitly aimed at couples, and female players of eurog-\n\names also seem more common in the United States.\n\nThe growth of female players in the eurogame industry was mirrored by a\n\ngrowth in female eurogame designers. Though women contributed to some early\n\nSdJ winners, such as Dorothy Garrels’ work on Scotland Yard (1982) and Suzanne\n\nGoldberg’s work on Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (1985), it’s only in the last\n\n20 years that female designers have started to appear more widely.\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, a few female designers established eurogame\n\npublishers of particular note. Doris Matthäus and Frank Nestel co-founded Doris & Frank,\n\nwhich has published well-known games such as Mü and More (1995) and Primordial\n\nSoup (1997). Meanwhile, Andrea Meyer is the sole founder of BeWitched-Spiele, whose\n\nbest-known games include Ad Acta (2002), Linq (2004), and Mallworld (2004).\n\nWomen have recently returned to the ranks of SdJ winners. Andreas Seyfarth\n\nwas awarded the SdJ for her co-authorship of Thurn and Taxis (2006) while Susan\n\nMcKinley Ross was the first solo female winner for Qwirkle (2011).\n\nThe percentage of female designers in hobbyist games is still small, but the con-\n\ntinuing expansion of the eurogame market provides room for their numbers to grow.\n\n18 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nD20 didn’t change the playing field, but it did widen it. Atlas Games was one\n\nof the first publishers to take advantage of this, with Michelle Nephew coming\n\nonboard as the company’s d20 line editor. Similarly, Green Ronin — which\n\nhad been recently founded by Chris Pramas and industry vet Nicole Lindroos\n\n— earned its early success through d20 releases. Finally, Paizo Publishing was\n\nco-founded and led by Lisa Stevens, who has been frequently mentioned through-\n\nout this history; since the release of Pathfinder (2009), Paizo has become the\n\nsecond biggest company in the industry.\n\nIndividual women writers also found d20 success. Some past female designers\n\nreturned with d20 books, while authors like Michelle Lyons, who were just getting\n\ntheir start, expanded their portfolios with d20 releases. Other female authors such\n\nas Erica Balsley, Julie Ann Dawson, and Christina Stiles joined the industry thanks\n\nto the new opportunities offered by Wizards’ d20 system.\n\nEven Wizards of the Coast increased its female design staff, with new authors\n\nincluding Gwendolyn Kestrel and Jennifer Clarke Wilkes. Shelly Mazzanoble\n\nbecame a voice for some female players through her book, Confessions of a Part-\n\nTime Sorceress (2007).\n\nIndie games offered a more revolutionary change to the roleplaying industry.\n\nThey introduced different sorts of games and different sorts of play. By appealing\n\nto a different demographic than the wargame-influenced RPGs of the ‘70s, they\n\nalso attracted a new generation of female designers.\n\nJenna Moran (previously Rebecca Sean\n\nBorgstrom) actually predated the indie\n\nmovement with her very indie game, Nobilis\n\n(1999); she’s continued with Weapons of the\n\nGods (2005) and Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish-\n\nGranting Engine (2014).\n\nOther female designers experimented\n\nwith indie ideas in many ways in the\n\nmovement’s earliest days. Emily Dresner-\n\nThornber’s indie thoughts mainly appeared\n\nin articles, such as those in Daedalus maga-\n\nzine (2003–2004), while CMU Assistant\n\nProfessor Jessica Hammer was a regular con-\n\ntributor to Game Chef (2002-Present), and\n\nCynthia Miller was a developer for the Cartoon Action Hour (2003) line.\n\nThen, as the indie revolution fully dawned, Ron Edwards encouraged develop-\n\ners to create their own publishing imprints. That’s exactly what many women did in\n\nthe ‘00s, creating the biggest boom of female-led RPG companies ever.\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 19\n\n• Meguey Baker founded Night Sky Games\n\nto publish A Thousand and One Nights\n\n(2006) and has since produced Psi*Run\n\n(2012) and Valiant Girls (2013).\n\n• Emily Care Boss created Black and Green\n\nGames, which may be the most prolific\n\nfemale-led indie publisher. She’s released\n\na half-dozen games, the best-known of\n\nwhich are part of her “romance trilogy”:\n\nBreaking the Ice (2005), Shooting the\n\nMoon (2006), and Under My Skin (2008).\n\nShe also edited RPG = Role Playing Girl\n\nmagazine (2009–2010).\n\n• Julia Bond Ellingboe founded Stone\n\nBaby Games to publish Steal Away Jordan\n\n(2007) and Tales from the Fisherman’s Wife\n\n(2012).\n\n• Anna Kreider created Tasty Bacon\n\nGames, which she later renamed to the\n\nless in-jokey Peachy Pants Press. She’s best\n\nknown for Thou Art But a Warrior (2008,\n\n2013) — originally an expansion for Ben\n\nLehman’s Polaris (2006), but now its own\n\ngame.\n\n• Annie Rush originally published her three\n\nRPGs through the Wicked Dead Brewing\n\nCompany, but she has since reprinted Run\n\nRobot Red! (2004) and others under her\n\nown brand, Itesser Ink.\n\n• Jen Seiden, formerly of West End Games,\n\nmoved on to create her own small\n\npublishing house, FireWater Productions,\n\nto publish Chaos University (2005).\n\n• Elizabeth Shoemaker joined with Shreyas\n\nSampat to found Two Scooters Press.\n\nUnlike similar co-founded publishers of\n\nthe ‘70s and ‘80s, these two designers have\n\neach pursued their own interests through\n\nthe Two Scooters imprint. Shoemaker’s\n\n20 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nbest-known games are the espionage Blowback (2010) and the romantic\n\nIt’s Complicated (2008). Deadbolt (2012) was a nominee for IndieCade\n\n2013.\n\nMany other women have created indie RPGs, more than this limited history\n\ncan cover.\n\n“We have different experiences and perspectives that can drive games to new\n\nlevels of story-telling and world construction, and I believe these abilities provide\n\na much fuller experience beyond number-crunching.”\n\n— Jen Seiden, “Designing Women,” RPGirl #1 (2009)\n\nDespite — or perhaps because of — the growing numbers of women involved\n\nas players and creators, the roleplaying industry is currently beset by a number\n\nof gender-related problems. This became particularly obvious when James\n\nDesborough wrote his controversial article “In Defence of Rape” (2012), which\n\ntalked about rape as a plot element, and when a Kickstarter for the feminist\n\n“Heartbreak & Heroines” RPG was met with massive misogyny (before it col-\n\nlapsed for other reasons).\n\nUnfortunately, this is part of a trend in the larger hobbyist field that may get\n\nworse before it gets better. The comic field has seen animosity directed toward\n\nfemale fans and cosplayers for years. More recently, the issue of female hobbyists\n\nexploded rather dramatically in the video game community in 2014 as part of the\n\nhorrific “GamerGate” scandal — which involved reactionary male players stalking\n\nfemale video game designers, driving them from their homes, and even threatening\n\nterrorist actions to stop them from speaking out.\n\nThough it would be easy to be discouraged by this backlash, it’s probably a sign\n\nof revolutionary growth — a sign that women have become a significant part of\n\nthe hobbyist community. That sort of growth is often met by reactionary hate, but\n\nthings will improve as the industry continues the slow change that began when the\n\nfirst woman picked up a copy of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nPart One: Game Designers (An Industry Trend) Women in the Roleplaying Industry: 1974-Present 21\n\nWhat to Read Next 7890\n\n• For more about the LA gaming scene, including more on APA-L, read The\n\nAurania Gang [PA].\n\n• For more on Jennell Jaquays and The Dungeoneer, read Judges Guild [‘70s].\n\n• For some of the earliest RPGs designed by women, read FGU [‘70s], Flying\n\nBuffalo [‘70s], Pacesetter [‘80s], and (again) The Aurania Gang [PA].\n\n• For how Jean Wells, Rose Estes, Jean Black, Margaret Weis, Mary Kirchoff, and\n\nothers fit into a larger narrative, read TSR [‘70s].\n\n• For Sue Grau and Hero Games, read Hero Auxiliary Corps [PA].\n\n• For a company that brought many female players and designers into the\n\nindustry, read White Wolf [‘90s].\n\n• For Ann Dupuis’ ground-breaking company, read Grey Ghost Press [‘90s].\n\n• For the indie games that grew out of FUDGE, read Evil Hat [‘00s].\n\n• For modern companies co-founded by women, read Margaret Weis\n\nProductions [‘90s], Green Ronin Publishing [‘00s], Lumpley Games\n\n[‘00s], and Paizo Publishing [‘00s].\n\n• For more on the indie revolution, read many histories of the ‘00s, beginning\n\nwith Adept Press [‘00s].

Many\n\nindie publishers are companies in names only — with some like Luke Crane’s\n\n“Burning Wheel” not even having a real company name. In other words, the\n\n‘00s has allowed individual people to be just as influential as the companies of\n\nold, thanks to the indie revolution.\n\nIn between individual designers and professional companies lie gaming\n\ngroups. They were quite important to the industry in the ‘70s and ‘80s because\n\nthey were often the immediate predecessors to publishers; even in the modern\n\nday, gaming groups have sometimes encouraged members to enter the industry.\n\nThis section discusses three different groups that each had an impact on the\n\nindustry. The Aurania Gang and the RuneQuest Mafia are traditional gaming\n\nclubs, focused on regular play with a regular group of players. On the other\n\nhand, the Hero Auxiliary Corps is a convention organization, which meets\n\neach year to run games at conventions.\n\nDesigners Years First RPG Page\n\nThe Aurania Gang 1974–1984 The Manual of Aurania (1976) 25\n\nHero Auxiliary Corps 1983–1997 “The Kiros Files” (1983) 32\n\nThe RuneQuest Mafia 1989-Present The Broken Council Guidebook (1995) 41\n\nThis history courtesy of Kickstarter backers who helped us to stretch to $90,000.\n\nThe Aurania Gang:\n\n1974–1984\n\nYou don’t actually have to form a company to publish an RPG book, and you can still\n\nhave a big influence on the industry.\n\nIt Takes a Thief: 1974–1975 1976: Manual of Aurania\n\n(1977 edition)\n\nThe story of the Aurania gang begins in\n\nHawthorne, California — located in the\n\nwestern Los Angeles region between Santa\n\nMonica and Long Beach. There, at the apart-\n\nment of one Thomas R. Coveny III, a group\n\nof friends tried out a new game procured by\n\nCoveny: Dungeons & Dragons (1974). It\n\nwas a hit, and two of the members — Dale\n\nDoane and Daniel Wagner — became the\n\ngame’s long-running co-GMs, each con-\n\ntrolling their own dungeon. The campaign\n\nof Aurania, the “land of gold,” had begun.\n\nIn its earliest days, the Aurania campaign\n\nincluded about a half-dozen members\n\n—including future video game designer\n\nSteve Sents and retailer Gary Switzer, the\n\n26 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nnew owner of a store called Aero Hobbies. Others would soon join, including\n\nHugh Singh, Larry Stehle, Steve Allen, Jay Hartlove, and Aimée Karklyn — all\n\nof whom would shortly become creators of one earliest supplements in the role-\n\nplaying industry.\n\nGary Switzer’s Aero Hobbies is an important character in this history too. It\n\nwas a store with an old pedigree: it was founded in 1950 in Santa Monica’s historic\n\nAero Building (1940), which lent the hobby store its name. Now, Aero Hobbies\n\nwas becoming a major focal point of the D&D revolution in Los Angeles, starting\n\nwith the Aurania gang — who regularly played at the store, at least until it closed\n\neach evening.\n\nIn the early days of the Aurania campaign, the rules of D&D were still loose\n\nand ill-defined; it was hard to figure out how to play the game from the rules alone.\n\nThis led many groups to come up with their own house rules, and the Aurania gang\n\nwas no exception. However, unlike most groups, the Aurania gang’s house rules\n\nentered the history of the industry.\n\nIt began when a dwarven henchman wanted to pick locks with his dagger. The\n\nsolution to this dilemma was a thief class inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien’s Bilbo Baggins\n\nand Jack Vance’s Cugel the Clever. It was something that was rather shockingly\n\nmissing from the original D&D game, which only included rules for clerics,\n\nwizards, and fighting men.\n\nThe thief class created by Wagner and the rest of the Auranian crew was a bit\n\ndifferent from what would soon appear in OD&D and AD&D (1977–1979): its\n\nskills were designed like magic-user spells; a character got new skills with names\n\nlike “pick locks,” “find traps,” and “disarm traps” as he went up in level. A player\n\ndidn’t roll against these skills, but thieves did need higher-level versions of them to\n\ndo more difficult things. Otherwise, the thief was built using the basic foundation\n\nof the cleric class.\n\nIt seems unlikely that an unofficial thief class created in Los Angeles, California,\n\ncould have influenced the creation of an official thief class in Lake Geneva,\n\nWisconsin, but that seems to be exactly what happened. Sometime prior to May\n\n10, 1974, Gary Switzer made a long-distance call from California to Wisconsin to\n\nspeak with Gary Gygax. This might seem a minor thing in the modern day, but in\n\n1974 communication across the country was much more costly. If Switzer talked to\n\nGygax for 10 minutes, he easily could have run up a bill of $20–40 ($100–200 in\n\n2014 dollars). Nonetheless, Switzer was eager to talk to the creator of this strange\n\nnew Dungeons & Dragons game — and along the way he discussed the thief class\n\nthat the Aurania gang was working on.\n\nGygax was excited about the idea. He quickly reconstructed his own version\n\nof the class based on the bits and pieces that Switzer shared. Gygax similarly took\n\nPart Two: Game Groups (An Industry Trend) The Aurania Gang: 1974–1984 27\n\ninspiration from Jack Vance’s Cugel the Clever, but added in Roger Zelazny’s Jack\n\nof Shadows. This consistent use of Jack Vance as the source for D&D’s thief is\n\nnotable; people usually talk about the Vancian magic of D&D, but Vancian skull-\n\nduggery is no less important. When he was done, Gygax published an untested\n\nversion of his thief in Great Plains Game Players Newsletter #9 ( June 1974), where\n\nhe also acknowledged its origin with Switzer. The thief reappeared the next year in\n\na more polished form in Supplement I: Greyhawk (1975).\n\nAnd that was how a small but enthusiastic gaming group in southern California\n\nforever changed the shape of D&D gaming. However, the Aurania gang wasn’t\n\nentirely happy with the way that their thief had been “stolen,” so they decided to\n\nwork a bit harder to protect their next creations.\n\nPublishing Aurania: 1975–1977\n\nThe Aurania gang began publishing their creative ideas on their own in APA-L\n\n#522 (May 1975), the APA (amateur press association) of the Los Angeles Science\n\nFiction Society. There, Switzer shared an article on critical hits and trips (fumbles)\n\nthat originated with the group.\n\nHowever, the Aurania gang were interested in doing something more — in\n\ndoing something relatively unprecedented in the dawning RPG industry. They\n\nwanted to publish their own book of rules and expansions as a supplement to\n\nDungeons & Dragons, in part because their ideas had been “outright stolen and\n\nsoon appeared in print” and they wanted “to prevent this from happening again.”\n\nThe gang printed somewhere between 200 and 300 copies of their Manual of\n\nAurania (1976) as a 24-page photocopied book. Wagner was the main author,\n\ndoing about 60% of the design. Larry Stehle offered some additional contributions\n\nand also typed up the book, Hugh Singh edited it, and Aimée Karklyn and Troy\n\nHughes illustrated it. Gary Switzer received credit as the owner of Aero Hobbies,\n\nwhile Dale Doane was noted as the co-DM of the Aurania campaign.\n\n“My creative process was a lot [like] Arneson’s — great ideas hastily scribbled down.\n\nIf it wasn’t for Hugh, the MofA would never have gotten published. Not to mention\n\nLarry’s abilities to read my scrawl.”\n\n— Daniel Wagner, odd74.proboards.com (September 2013)\n\nThe book was a set of rules expansions not unlike those found in the OD&D\n\nSupplements (1975–1976). New classes included the basadae, beorning, cleric of\n\nAsgard, cleric of Mitra, leprechaun, samurai, shape-shifter, and sidhe. The Manual\n\nalso contained tons of new monsters, including the uruk-hai, the crypt keeper, the\n\npurple dragon, the crimson dragon, the sphinx, the bandersnatch, and more.\n\n28 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nThe gang sold the first edition of their Manual primarily through two local\n\ngame stores: Aero Hobbies in Santa Monica and The War House in nearby Long\n\nBeach. They also advertised it through an ad in Alarums & Excursions #11 (May\n\n1976) and moved more copies at DunDraCon 3 (1977), where they were Guests\n\nof Honor. The San Francisco Bay Area convention also ensured that the book was\n\nseen beyond the LA region.\n\nFollowing the Manual’s initial release, the group continued to edit it through-\n\nout 1976, releasing a second edition (1977) about a year later. This time they\n\nprinted the book more professionally in a quantity of about a thousand. They\n\nalso got additional distribution help from Russell Powell’s International Gamers\n\nAssociation — a Los Angeles wargaming society that Wagner (and his father) had\n\nbeen a founding member of.\n\nWhich all brings us to the question of the Manual’s historical notability. By the\n\ntime of its initial publication, D&D was about two years old, and a rabid fandom\n\nwas talking about it through roleplaying APAs like Alarums and Excursions (1975-\n\nPresent) and The Wild Hunt (1976–1994), as well as in older science-fiction and\n\nwargaming APAs.\n\nAt least one commercial third-party supplement had been produced for D&D:\n\nWee Warrior’s The Character Archaic (1975), published in September 1975. By\n\nFebruary 1976, it was being officially distributed by TSR. Meanwhile, gaming\n\ngroups were producing books of house rules such as Conan La Motte’s “Tome of\n\nMid-Kimia” (1975?) for their own, non-commercial use.\n\nBeyond that, there were still very few D&D publications by companies other\n\nthan TSR. Jennell Jaquays’ The Dungeoneer #1 ( June 1976) appeared a month after\n\nthe Aurania ad, while major licensee Judges Guild was formed on July 4. Little\n\nSoldier Games was one of the few other third-party publishers to produce D&D\n\nsupplements that year — including The Book of Monsters (1976) and The Book of\n\nDemons (1976) — but the records of their publication dates aren’t as clear.\n\nSo was The Manual of Aurania the first third-party D&D product? Maybe, if\n\nyou discount The Character Archaic either because it was just a character sheet or\n\nbecause it quickly moved into exclusive distribution from TSR. But whether it was\n\ntechnically #1 or not, the Manual was definitely a historic release, foreshadowing\n\nthe wave of such products that would batter TSR’s shores in the late ‘70s.\n\nThe Aurania gang also worked on a second release called the “Libram of\n\nAurania.” It was fully written and illustrated, but poor typing kept it from publica-\n\ntion. And that was the end of the Aurania group’s major influence on D&D: one\n\ncore character class and one very early D&D publication.\n\nPart Two: Game Groups (An Industry Trend) The Aurania Gang: 1974–1984 29\n\nSouthern California Prospers: 1974-Present\n\nIn the years that followed, the Aurania\n\ngang continued to game together. Their\n\ncatalog of campaigns is a history of the early\n\nroleplaying industry: besides D&D, they\n\nalso played Boot Hill (1975), Tunnels &\n\nTrolls (1975), Bunnies & Burrows (1976),\n\nChivalry & Sorcery (1977), Gamma World\n\n(1978), and RuneQuest (1978).\n\nA game written by two of the gang’s\n\nmembers was another favorite. Jay\n\nHartlove and Aimée Karklyn (by this\n\npoint, Aimée Hartlove) produced an RPG\n\ncalled Supergame (1980). It was one of the\n\nearliest superhero games, postdating only\n\nSuperhero 2044 (1977, 1978) and Villains\n\n& Vigilantes (1979). It avoided random\n\nrolls, instead using a point-based character creation system that wasn’t “limited”\n\nby ideas about the universe. A second edition followed (1982), but it couldn’t\n\ncompete when northern California produced Champions (1981).\n\nMeanwhile, Daniel Wagner, Gary Switzer, Steve Allen, and Howard Marcus\n\npurchased a retail store in Westwood, just five miles northeast of Santa Monica.\n\nKennedy’s Historical Models & Games had originally focused on the model side of\n\nthe things, but after the gang bought it from Edward Kennedy, they changed the\n\nfocus to gaming — bringing roleplaying to another Los Angeles community. They\n\neven added a dungeon-themed game room, with its walls painted to look like the\n\nstones of an underground passage. Wagner ran the store for the gang until around\n\n1982, when he sold his share to Noah Dudley — who attracted people to the\n\nstore with his own GMing, but was less successful on the business side of things.\n\nKennedy’s Models & Games only lasted for another year or so; shortly before its\n\ndemise, distributors were addressing products to “Dead Kennedy’s.”\n\nAll of the actions of the Aurania gang were played out against the background\n\nof a vibrant roleplaying community in Los Angeles — the community that was\n\ngelling around APA-L and Lee Gold’s Alarums & Excursions. Aero Hobbies was\n\nalso strong focus of this community. On a good day you might even find J. Eric\n\nHolmes there, leading youngsters in a game of Dungeons & Dragons — advocating\n\nthe same goals of teaching that caused him to write the first Basic Dungeons &\n\nDragons (1977) for TSR. Holmes might have been influenced by the Aurania gang\n\n30 Designers & Dragons: Platinum Appendix Shannon Appelcline\n\nas well, because he talked about one of his sons playing a “Beorning” in an article\n\nthat he wrote for Alarums & Excursion #16 (August 1976).\n\nMoving out from Los Angeles — from Aero in Santa Monica, The War House\n\nin Long Beach, and Kennedy’s in Westwood — you can see the continued influ-\n\nence of these western LA stores and their communities.\n\nCaltech — located on the opposite side of Los Angeles, about 30 miles east of\n\nSanta Monica — is known for their Warlock RPG system, an early OD&D variant.\n\nIt was first published in Spartan Simulation Gaming Journal #9 (August 1975)\n\nand later updated and reprinted as The Complete Warlock (1978) by the Balboa\n\nGame Company — a publishing house that shared an address with The War House\n\nin Long Beach. Warlock included a spell point system, a critical hit and fumble\n\nsystem, and a “spell-like” system for thieves — which sounds more like the Aurania\n\ngang’s thieves than the ones published by Gygax in Greyhawk.\n\n“All we have tried to do is present a way of handling D&D without the contradic-\n\ntions and loopholes inherent in the original rules.”\n\n— Spartan Simulation Gaming Journal #9 (August 1975)\n\nPerhaps we can even trace the influence of the western LA gaming scene to San\n\nDiego’s Midkemia Press; that company was set on its road to publication in 1975\n\nwhen Conan La Motte purchased a copy of OD&D in Los Angeles. Though we\n\ndon’t know where he made his purchase, Aero Hobbies and The War House both\n\nseem like likely candidates.\n\nAround 1984, the Aurania gang began to splinter apart, as gaming groups even-\n\ntually do. Coveny and Sents went on to design a 54mm cavalry miniatures game,\n\nthen Sents (and Dudley) went into video games. Karklyn became a glass jewelry\n\ndesigner. Other members disappeared entirely. Aero Hobbies, now over 60 years\n\nold, still can be found in Santa Monica. Gary Switzer passed away in 2006, but left\n\nthe game store to one of his employees.\n\nFor a brief time the Aurania gang influenced the whole hobby through their\n\ncreation of a thief and their publication of the Manual of Aurania. However,\n\nunlike many early RPG publishers of the ‘70s, the Auranians quickly decided\n\nthey’d had enough.\n\nBut how can you top creating the fourth and final core class for the world’s most\n\npopular tabletop RPG?\n\nPart Two: Game Groups (An Industry Trend) The Aurania Gang: 1974–1984 31\n\nWhat to Read Next 7890\n\n• For D&D and the thief, read TSR [‘70s].\n\n• For other publishers of D&D supplements in 1976, read Judges Guild [‘70s],\n\nthe Little Soldier Games mini-history in Gamescience [‘70s], and the Wee\n\nWarriors mini-history in TSR [‘70s].\n\n• For the early northern California gaming scene, including DunDraCon, read\n\nGrimoire Games [‘70s].\n\n• For an early San Diego gaming company, read Midkemia Press [‘70s].\n\n• For other early superhero RPGs, read Gamescience [‘70s], FGU [‘70s], and\n\nHero Games [‘80s].\n\n• For the makers of some of those RPGs that the Aurania gang played, read TSR\n\n[‘70s], Flying Buffalo [‘70s], FGU [‘70s], and Chaosium [‘70s].\n\n• For another gaming group that touched the industry, read The RuneQuest\n\nMafia [PA] and for a very different sort of gaming group, read Hero Auxiliary\n\nCorps [PA].\n\nThis history courtesy of Platinum Dragon Carl Rigney.\n\nHero Auxiliary\n\nCorps: 1983–1997\n\nThe Hero Auxiliary Corps was a volunteer organization that ran innovative tourna-\n\nments for Hero Games throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s.
