D.; Katz, D.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nBy means of idealized, dissipationless N-body simulations that follow the formation and subsequent buckling of a stellar bar, we study the characteristics of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges and compare them with the properties of the stellar populations in the Milky Way (MW) bulge. The main results of our modeling, valid for the general family of boxy/peanut shaped bulges, are the following: (i) Because of the spatial redistribution in the disk initiated at the epoch of bar formation, stars from the innermost regions to the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the stellar bar are mapped into a boxy bulge. (ii) The contribution of stars to the local bulge density depends on their birth radius: stars born in the innermost disk tend to dominate the innermost regions of the boxy bulge, while stars originating closer to the OLR are preferably found in the outer regions of the boxy/peanut structure. (iii) Stellar birth radii are imprinted in the bulge kinematics: the larger the birth radii of stars ending up in the bulge, the greater their rotational support and the higher their line-of-sight velocity dispersions (but note that this last trend depends on the bar viewing angle). (iv) The higher the classical bulge-over-disk ratio, the larger its fractional contribution of stars at large vertical distance from the galaxy midplane. Comparing these results with the properties of the stellar populations of the MW bulge recently revealed by the ARGOS survey, we conclude that (I) the two most metal-rich populations of the MW bulge, labeled A and B in the ARGOS survey, originate in the disk, with the population of A having formed on average closer to the Galaxy center than the population of component B; (II) a massive (B/D ~ 0.25) classical spheroid can be excluded for the MW, thus confirming previous findings that the MW bulge is composed of populations that mostly have a disk origin. On the basis of their chemical and kinematic characteristics, the results of our modeling suggest that\n\n2D kinematic signatures of boxy/peanut bulges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIannuzzi, Francesca; Athanassoula, E.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nWe study the imprints of boxy/peanut structures on the 2D line-of-sight kinematics of simulated disc galaxies. The models under study belong to a family with varying initial gas fraction and halo triaxiality, plus few other control runs with different structural parameters; the kinematic information was extracted using the Voronoi-binning technique and parametrized up to the fourth order of a Gauss-Hermite series. Building on a previous work for the long-slit case, we investigate the 2D kinematic behaviour in the edge-on projection as a function of the boxy/peanut strength and position angle; we find that for the strongest structures the highest moments show characteristic features away from the mid-plane in a range of position angles. We also discuss the masking effect of a classical bulge and the ambiguity in discriminating kinematically this spherically symmetric component from a boxy/peanut bulge seen end-on. Regarding the face-on case, we extend existing results to encompass the effect of a second buckling and find that this phenomenon spurs an additional set of even deeper minima in the fourth moment. Finally, we show how the results evolve when inclining the disc away from perfectly edge-on and face-on. The behaviour of stars born during the course of the simulations is discussed and confronted to that of the pre-existing disc. The general aim of our study is providing a handle to identify boxy/peanut structures and their properties in latest generation Integral Field Unit observations of nearby disc galaxies.\n\nMETALLICITY GRADIENTS THROUGH DISK INSTABILITY: A SIMPLE MODEL FOR THE MILKY WAY'S BOXY BULGE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMartinez-Valpuesta, Inma; Gerhard, Ortwin, E-mail: imv@mpe.mpg.de, E-mail: gerhard@mpe.mpg.de\n\n2013-03-20\n\nObservations show a clear vertical metallicity gradient in the Galactic bulge, which is often taken as a signature of dissipative processes in the formation of a classical bulge. Various evidence shows, however, that the Milky Way is a barred galaxy with a boxy bulge representing the inner three-dimensional part of the bar. Here we show with a secular evolution N-body model that a boxy bulge formed through bar and buckling instabilities can show vertical metallicity gradients similar to the observed gradient if the initial axisymmetric disk had a comparable radial metallicity gradient. In this framework, the range of metallicities inmoreÂ Â» bulge fields constrains the chemical structure of the Galactic disk at early times before bar formation. Our secular evolution model was previously shown to reproduce inner Galaxy star counts and we show here that it also has cylindrical rotation. We use it to predict a full mean metallicity map across the Galactic bulge from a simple metallicity model for the initial disk. This map shows a general outward gradient on the sky as well as longitudinal perspective asymmetries. We also briefly comment on interpreting metallicity gradient observations in external boxy bulges.Â«Â less\n\nTHE VERTICAL X-SHAPED STRUCTURE IN THE MILKY WAY: EVIDENCE FROM A SIMPLE BOXY BULGE MODEL\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi Zhaoyu; Shen Juntai, E-mail: jshen@shao.ac.cn\n\n2012-09-20\n\nA vertical X-shaped structure in the Galactic bulge was recently reported. Here, we present evidence of a similar X-shaped structure in the Shen et al. 2010 bar/boxy bulge model that simultaneously matches the stellar kinematics successfully. The X-shaped structure is found in the central region of our bar/boxy bulge model and is qualitatively consistent with the observed one in many aspects. End-to-end separations of the X-shaped structure in the radial and vertical directions are roughly 3 kpc and 1.8 kpc, respectively. The X-shaped structure contains about 7% of light in the boxy bulge region, but it is significant enough tomoreÂ Â» be identified in observations. An X-shaped structure naturally arises in the formation of bar/boxy bulges and is mainly associated with orbits trapped around the vertically extended x{sub 1} family. Like the bar in our model, the X-shaped structure tilts away from the Sun-Galactic center line by 20 Degree-Sign . The X-shaped structure becomes increasingly symmetric about the disk plane, so the observed symmetry may indicate that it formed at least a few billion years ago. The existence of the vertical X-shaped structure suggests that the formation of the Milky Way bulge is shaped mainly by internal disk dynamical instabilities.Â«Â less\n\nBarlenses and X-shaped features compared: two manifestations of boxy/peanut bulges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaurikainen, E.; Salo, H.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAims: We study the morphological characteristics of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges. In particular, we are interested to determine whether most of the flux associated with bulges in galaxies with masses similar to those of the Milky Way at redshift z 0 might belong to the vertically thick inner part of the bar, in a similar manner as in the Milky Way itself. At high galaxy inclinations, these structures are observed as boxy/peanut/X-shaped features, and when the view is near to face-on, they are observed as barlenses. We also study the possibility that bulges in some fraction of unbarred galaxies might form in a similar manner as the bulges in barred galaxies. Methods: We used the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and the Near-IR S0 galaxy Survey (NIRS0S) to compile complete samples of galaxies with barlenses (N = 85) and X-shaped features (N = 88). A sample of unbarred galaxies (N = 41) is also selected. For all 214 galaxies unsharp mask images were created, used to recognize the X-shaped features and to measure their linear sizes. To detect possible boxy isophotes (using the B4-parameter), we also performed an isophotal analysis for the barlens galaxies. We use recently published N-body simulations: the models that exhibit boxy/peanut/X/barlens morphologies are viewed from isotropically chosen directions that cover the full range of galaxy inclinations in the sky. The synthetic images were analyzed in a similar manner as the observations. Results: This is the first time that the observed properties of barlenses and X-shaped features are directly compared across a wide range of galaxy inclinations. A comparison with the simulation models shows that the differences in their apparent sizes, a/rbar â³ 0.5 for barlenses and a/rbar â² 0.5 for X-shapes, can be explained by projection effects. Observations at various inclinations are consistent with intrinsic abl â aX â 0.5rbar: here intrinsic size means the face-on semimajor axis length for bars and\n\nObservational constraints to boxy/peanut bulge formation time\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPÃ©rez, I.; MartÃ­nez-Valpuesta, I.; Ruiz-Lara, T.; de Lorenzo-Caceres, A.; FalcÃ³n-Barroso, J.; Florido, E.; GonzÃ¡lez Delgado, R. M.; Lyubenova, M.; Marino, R. A.; SÃ¡nchez, S. F.; SÃ¡nchez-BlÃ¡zquez, P.; van de Ven, G.; Zurita, A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nBoxy/peanut bulges are considered to be part of the same stellar structure as bars and both could be linked through the buckling instability. The Milky Way is our closest example. The goal of this Letter is to determine if the mass assembly of the different components leaves an imprint in their stellar populations allowing the estimation the time of bar formation and its evolution. To this aim, we use integral field spectroscopy to derive the stellar age distributions, SADs, along the bar and disc of NGC 6032. The analysis clearly shows different SADs for the different bar areas. There is an underlying old (â¥12 Gyr) stellar population for the whole galaxy. The bulge shows star formation happening at all times. The inner bar structure shows stars of ages older than 6 Gyr with a deficit of younger populations. The outer bar region presents an SAD similar to that of the disc. To interpret our results, we use a generic numerical simulation of a barred galaxy. Thus, we constrain, for the first time, the epoch of bar formation, the buckling instability period and the posterior growth from disc material. We establish that the bar of NGC 6032 is old, formed around 10 Gyr ago while the buckling phase possibly happened around 8 Gyr ago. All these results point towards bars being long-lasting even in the presence of gas.\n\nK-band observations of boxy bulges - I. Morphology and surface brightness profiles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBureau, M.; Aronica, G.; Athanassoula, E.; Dettmar, R.-J.; Bosma, A.; Freeman, K. C.\n\n2006-08-01\n\nIn this first paper of a series on the structure of boxy and peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges, Kn-band observations of a sample of 30 edge-on spiral galaxies are described and discussed. Kn-band observations best trace the dominant luminous galactic mass and are minimally affected by dust. Images, unsharp-masked images, as well as major-axis and vertically summed surface brightness profiles are presented and discussed. Galaxies with a B/PS bulge tend to have a more complex morphology than galaxies with other bulge types, more often showing centred or off-centred X structures, secondary maxima along the major-axis and spiral-like structures. While probably not uniquely related to bars, those features are observed in three-dimensional N-body simulations of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, typically containing three or more clearly separated regions, including a shallow or flat intermediate region (Freeman Type II profiles). The breaks in the profiles offer evidence for bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material. The profiles further suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from the vertical resonances and instabilities present in barred discs. Interestingly, the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat intermediate region of the profiles. The steep inner region is also much more prominent along the major-axis than in the vertically summed profiles. Similarly to other recent work but contrary to the standard `bulge + disc' model (where the bulge is both thick and steep), we thus propose that galaxies with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge) contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge), itself\n\nTHE X-SHAPED BULGE OF THE MILKY WAY REVEALED BY WISE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNess, Melissa; Lang, Dustin, E-mail: ness@mpia-hd.mpg.de\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe Milky Way bulge has a boxy/peanut morphology and an X-shaped structure. This X-shape has been revealed by the âsplit in the red clumpâ from star counts along the line of sight toward the bulge, measured from photometric surveys. This boxy, X-shaped bulge morphology is not unique to the Milky Way and such bulges are observed in other barred spiral galaxies. N -body simulations show that boxy and X-shaped bulges are formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. It has also been proposed that the Milky Way bulge is not X-shaped, but rather, the apparent split in the red clumpmoreÂ Â» stars is a consequence of different stellar populations, in an old classical spheroidal bulge. We present a Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) image of the Milky Way bulge, produced by downsampling the publicly available âunWISEâ coadds. The WISE image of the Milky Way bulge shows that the X-shaped nature of the Milky Way bulge is self-evident and irrefutable. The X-shape morphology of the bulge in itself and the fraction of bulge stars that comprise orbits within this structure has important implications for the formation history of the Milky Way, and, given the ubiquity of boxy X-shaped bulges, spiral galaxies in general.Â«Â less\n\nA Kinematic Link Between Boxy Bulges, Stellar Bars, and Nuclear Activity in NGC 3079 and NGC 4388\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVeilleux, S.; Bland-Hawthrorn, J.; Cecil, Gerald\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe present direct kinematic evidence for bar streaming in two active galaxies with boxy stellar bulges. The Hawaii Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer was used on the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6-m telescope and the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope to derive the two-dimensional velocity field of the line-emitting gas in the disks of the Sc galaxy NGC 3079 and the Sb galaxy NGC 4388. In contrast to previous work based on long-slit data, the detection of the bar potential from the Fabry-Perot data does not rely on the existence of inner Lindblad resonances or strong bar-induced shocks. Simple kinematic models which approximate the intrinsic gas orbits as nonintersecting, inclined elliptical annuli that conserve angular momentum characterize the observed velocity fields. In NGC 3079, bar streaming motions with moderately eccentric orbits (e = b/a approx. 0.7) aligned along PA = 130 deg. intrinsic to the disk (PA = 97 deg. on the sky) are detected out to R(sub b) = 3.6 kpc. The orbits become increasingly circular beyond that radius (e = 1 at R(sub d) approx. = 6 kpc). The best model for NGC 4388 includes highly eccentric orbits (e approx. 0.3) for R(sub) less than or equal to 1.5 kpc which are aligned along PA = 135 deg. intrinsic to the disk (PA = 100 deg. on the sky). The observed \"spiral arms\" are produced by having the orbits become increasingly circular from the ends of the bar to the edge of the disk (R(sub d) approx. = 5 kpc), and the intrinsic bar PA shifting from 135 deg. to 90 deg.. Box-shaped bulges in both NGC 3079 and NGC 4388 are confirmed using new near-infrared images to reduce dust obscuration. Morphological analysis of starlight in these galaxies is combined with the gas kinematics derived from the Fabry-Perot spectra to test evolutionary models of stellar bars that involve transitory boxy bulges, and to quantify the importance of such bars in fueling active nuclei. Our data support the evolutionary bar models, but fail to prove convincingly that the\n\nThe Formation of Galactic Bulges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarollo, C.

Recent studies have shown that at least some - perhaps most - disk-galaxy bulges are actually composite structures, with both classical-bulge (spheroid) and pseudobulge (disky) components; this calls into question the standard practice of using simple, low-resolution bulge/disk decompositions to determine spheroid and SMBH mass functions. We propose WFC3 optical and near-IR imaging of a volume- and mass-limited sample of local disk galaxies to determine the full range of pure-classical, pure-pseudobulge, and composite-bulge frequencies and parameters, including stellar masses for classical bulges, disky pseudobulges, and boxy/peanut-shaped bulges. We will combine this with ground-based spectroscopy to determine the stellar-kinematic and population characteristics of the different substructures revealed by our WFC3 imaging. This will help resolve growing uncertainties about the status and nature of bulges and their relation to SMBH masses, and will provide an essential local-universe reference for understanding bulge (and SMBH) formation and evolution.\n\nThe phase space of boxy-peanut and X-shaped bulges in galaxies - I. Properties of non-periodic orbits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatsis, P. A.; Katsanikas, M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe investigation of the phase-space properties of structures encountered in a dynamical system is essential for understanding their formation and enhancement. In this paper, we explore the phase space in energy intervals where we have orbits that act as building blocks for boxy-peanut (b/p) and `X-shaped' structures in rotating potentials of galactic type. We underline the significance of the rotational tori around the 3D families x1v1 and x1v1' that have been bifurcated from the planar x1 family. These tori play a multiple role: (i) they belong to quasi-periodic orbits that reinforce the local density. (ii) They act as obstacles for the diffusion of chaotic orbits and (iii) they attract a large number of chaotic orbits that become sticky to them. There are also bifurcations of unstable families (x1v2, x1v2'). Their unstable asymptotic curves wind around the x1v1 and x1v1' tori generating orbits with hybrid morphologies between that of x1v1 and x1v2. In addition, a new family of multiplicity 2, called x1mul2, is found to be important for the peanut construction. This family produces stickiness phenomena in the critical area of the radial and vertical inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs) and reinforces b/p bulges. Our work shows also that there are peanut-supporting orbits before the vertical ILR. Non-periodic orbits associated with the x1 family secure this contribution as well as the support of b/p structures at several other energy intervals. Non-linear phenomena associated with complex instability of single and double multiplicity families of periodic orbits show that these structures are not interrupted in regions where such orbits prevail. Depending on the main mechanism behind their formation, boxy bulges exhibit different morphological features. Finally, our analysis indicates that `X' features shaped by orbits in the neighbourhood of x1v1 and x1v1' periodic orbits are pronounced only in side-on or nearly end-on views of the bar.\n\nOn the nature of the barlens component in barred galaxies: what do boxy/peanut bulges look like when viewed face-on?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAthanassoula, E.; Laurikainen, E.; Salo, H.; Bosma, A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nBarred galaxies have interesting morphological features whose presence and properties set constraints on galactic evolution. Here we examine barlenses, i.e. lens-like components whose extent along the bar major axis is shorter than that of the bar and whose outline is oval or circular. We identify and analyse barlenses in N-body plus SPH simulations, compare them extensively with those from the NIRS0S (Near-IR S0 galaxy Survey) and the S4G samples (Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies) and find very good agreement. We observe barlenses in our simulations from different viewing angles. This reveals that barlenses are the vertically thick part of the bar seen face-on, i.e. a barlens seen edge-on is a boxy/peanut/X bulge. In morphological studies, and in the absence of kinematics or photometry, a barlens, or part of it, may be mistaken for a classical bulge. Thus the true importance of classical bulges, both in numbers and mass, is smaller than currently assumed, which has implications for galaxy formation studies. Finally, using the shape of the isodensity curves, we propose a rule of thumb for measuring the barlens extent along the bar major axis of moderately inclined galaxies, thus providing an estimate of which part of the bar is thicker.\n\nMetallicity-dependent kinematics and morphology of the Milky Way bulge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAthanassoula, E.; Rodionov, S. A.; Prantzos, N.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWe use N-body chemo-dynamic simulations to study the coupling between morphology, kinematics and metallicity of the bar/bulge region of our Galaxy. We make qualitative comparisons of our results with available observations and find very good agreement. We conclude that this region is complex, since it comprises several stellar components with different properties - I.e. a boxy/peanut bulge, thin and thick disc components, and, to lesser extents, a disky pseudo-bulge, a stellar halo and a small classical bulge - all cohabiting in dynamical equilibrium. Our models show strong links between kinematics and metallicity, or morphology and metallicity, as already suggested by a number of recent observations. We discuss and explain these links.\n\nNew insights on the origin of the High Velocity Peaks in the Galactic Bulge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFernÃ¡ndez-Trincado, J. G.; Robin, A. C.; Moreno, E.; PÃ©rez-Villegas, A.; Pichardo, B.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe provide new insight on the origin of the cold high-V_{los} peaks (Ë200 kms^{-1}) in the Milky Way bulge discovered in the APOGEE commissioning data (Nidever et al. 2012). Here we show that such kinematic behaviour present in the field regions towards the Galactic bulge is not likely associated with orbits that build the boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge. To this purpose, a new set of test particle simulations of a kinematically cold stellar disk evolved in a 3D steady-state barred Milky Way galactic potential, has been analysed in detail. Especially bar particles trapped into the bar are identified through the orbital Jacobi energy E_{J}, which allows us to identify the building blocks of the B/P feature and investigate their kinematic properties. Finally, we present preliminary results showing that the high-V_{los} features observed towards the Milky Way bulge are a natural consequence of a large-scale midplane particle structure, which is unlikely associated with the Galactic bar.\n\nYOUNG STARS IN AN OLD BULGE: A NATURAL OUTCOME OF INTERNAL EVOLUTION IN THE MILKY WAY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNess, M.; Debattista, Victor P.; Cole, D. R.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe center of our disk galaxy, the Milky Way, is dominated by a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar photometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. The perceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likely formation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique population that formed early and separately from the disk. However, recent studies of individual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that they span a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithic structure. In this Letter we demonstratemoreÂ Â» that the presence of young stars that are located predominantly nearer to the plane is expected for a bulge that has formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. Using an N-body+ smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matter halo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model and the observations of younger metal-rich stars in the bulge. We are also able to partially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between results that argue for a purely old bulge population and those that show a population comprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look.Â«Â less\n\nPeanut-shaped metallicity distributions in bulges of edge-on galaxies: the case of NGC 4710\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzalez, Oscar A.; Debattista, Victor P.; Ness, Melissa; Erwin, Peter; Gadotti, Dimitri A.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nBulges of edge-on galaxies are often boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS), and unsharp masks reveal the presence of an X shape. Simulations show that these shapes can be produced by dynamical processes driven by a bar which vertically thickens the centre. In the Milky Way, which contains such a B/PS bulge, the X-shaped structure is traced by the metal-rich stars but not by the metal-poor ones. Recently, Debattista et al. interpreted this property as a result of the varying effect of the bar on stellar populations with different starting kinematics. This kinematic fractionation model predicts that cooler populations at the time of bar formation go on to trace the X shape, whereas hotter populations are more uniformly distributed. As this prediction is not specific to the Milky Way, we test it with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of the B/PS bulge in the nearby galaxy NGC 4710. We show that the metallicity map is more peanut-shaped than the density distribution itself, in good agreement with the prediction. This result indicates that the X-shaped structure in B/PS bulges is formed of relatively metal-rich stars that have been vertically redistributed by the bar, whereas the metal-poor stars have a more uniform, box-shaped distribution.\n\nN-body modeling of barlens galaxies: Boxy/Peanut/X observed at different viewing geometries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalo, Heikki; Laurikainen, Eija\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe use stellar dynamical N-body simulations to explore barlens galaxies, i.e. galaxies with lens-like central structures embedded in their bars, with a size about one-half of the narrow bar component. Because of their roundish isophotes, barlenses are often confused with classical bulges. However, growing evidence indicates that barlenses form a part of the bar, corresponding to the face-on projection of the vertically extended Boxy/Peanut/X central structures seen in edge-on barred galaxies (see Laurikainen et al. 2014, 2016, Athanassoula et al. 2015). B/P/X/barlens structures appear mostly in galaxies with stellar masses above 1010 solar masses. It has been suggested by Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard (2016) that in face-on view also our Milky Way is likely to be a barlens galaxy.Here we review the morphological appearance of B/P/X/barlens galaxies (aspect ratio, size compared to the narrow bar) as a function of viewing inclination, by comparing synthetic images from simulations with the 3.6 micron data from S4G (Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies). We demonstrate how the X/barlens morphology depends on the central mass concentration in galaxies; the pure barlens morphology requires steep inner rotation curves, while for shallower slopes the central structure still resembles a barlens, but shows boxy isophotes or X-signature even at low inclinations. This simulated behavior is confirmed with S4G data (Salo & Laurikainen 2017). We also use broadband SDSS colors and CALIFA DR3 data from literature, to analyze the ages and metallicities of the barlens components with respect to the narrow bar and the centralpeak of the galaxies. Finally, kinematic maps of the simulated galaxies are presented, illustrating the expected signatures of barlens component on the H3 and H4 Hermite-moments.\n\nA parametric description of the 3D structure of the Galactic bar/bulge using the VVV survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSimion, I.

The VVV is a deep near-infrared, multi-colour photometric survey with a coverage of 300 square degrees towards the bulge/bar. We use red clump (RC) stars to produce a high-resolution dust map of the VVV's field of view. From de-reddened colour-magnitude diagrams, we select red giant branch stars to investigate their 3D density distribution within the central 4 kpc. We demonstrate that our best-fitting parametric model of the bulge density provides a good description of the VVV data, with a median percentage residual of 5 per cent over the fitted region. The strongest of the otherwise low-level residuals are overdensities associated with a low-latitude structure as well as the so-called X-shape previously identified using the split RC. These additional components contribute only Ë5 per cent and Ë7 per cent respectively to the bulge mass budget. The best-fitting bulge is `boxy' with an axial ratio of [1:0.44:0.31] and is rotated with respect to the Sun-Galactic Centre line by at least 20Â°. We provide an estimate of the total, full sky, mass of the bulge of M_bulge^{Chabrier} = 2.36 Ã 10^{10} M_{â} for a Chabrier initial mass function. We show that there exists a strong degeneracy between the viewing angle and the dispersion of the RC absolute magnitude distribution. The value of the latter is strongly dependent on the assumptions made about the intrinsic luminosity function of the bulge.\n\nWhat the Milky Way bulge reveals about the initial metallicity gradients in the disc\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFragkoudi, F.; Di Matteo, P.; Haywood, M.; Khoperskov, S.; Gomez, A.; Schultheis, M.; Combes, F.; Semelin, B.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe use APOGEE DR13 data to examine the metallicity trends in the Milky Way (MW) bulge and we explore their origin by comparing two N-body models of isolated galaxies that develop a bar and a boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge. Both models have been proposed as scenarios for reconciling a disc origin of the MW bulge with a negative vertical metallicity gradient. The first model is a superposition of co-spatial, I.e. overlapping, disc populations with different scale heights, kinematics, and metallicities. In this model the thick, metal-poor, and centrally concentrated disc populations contribute significantly to the stellar mass budget in the inner galaxy. The second model is a single disc with an initial steep radial metallicity gradient; this disc is mapped by the bar into the b/p bulge in such a way that the vertical metallicity gradient of the MW bulge is reproduced, as has been shown already in previous works in the literature. However, as we show here, the latter model does not reproduce the positive longitudinal metallicity gradient of the inner disc, nor the metal-poor innermost regions seen in the data. On the other hand, the model with co-spatial thin and thick disc populations reproduces all the aforementioned trends. We therefore see that it is possible to reconcile a (primarily) disc origin for the MW bulge with the observed trends in metallicity by mapping the inner thin and thick discs of the MW into a b/p. For this scenario to reproduce the observations, the Î±-enhanced, metal-poor, thick disc populations must have a significant mass contribution in the inner regions, as has been suggested for the Milky Way.\n\n40 CFR 721.5375 - Ni-tro-thio-phene-car-boxy-lic acid, ethyl es-ter, bis-[[[[(sub-sti-tut-ed)] amino]-alkyl-phenyl...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 40 Protection of Environment 30 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Ni-tro-thio-phene-car-boxy-lic acid...

Four different latitudes were considered: b = -4Â°, -6Â°, -8Â°, and -10Â°, along the bulge minor axis as well as outside it, at l = Â± 5Â° and l = Â± 10Â°. The bulge X-shaped structure comprises stars that formed in the disk at different locations. Stars formed in the outer disk, beyond the end of the bar, which are part of the boxy peanut-bulge structure may show peaks in the velocity distributions at positive and negative heliocentric radial velocities with high absolute values that can be larger than 100 km s-1, depending on the observed direction. In some cases the structure of the velocity field is more complex and several peaks are observed. Stars formed in the inner disk, the most numerous, contribute predominantly to the X-shaped structure and present different kinematic characteristics. They display a rather symmetric velocity distribution and a smaller fraction of high-velocity stars. The stellar stream motion, which is induced by the bar changes with the star initial position, can reach more than 40 km s-1 for stars that originated in the external disk, depending on the observed direction. Otherwise it is smaller than approximately 20 km s-1. In all cases, it decreases from b = -4Â° to -10Â°. Our results may enable us to interpret the cold high-velocity peak observed in the APOGEE commissioning data, as well as the excess of high-velocity stars in the near and far arms of the X-shaped structure at l = 0Â° and b = -6Â°. When compared with real data, the kinematic picture becomes more complex due to the possible presence in the observed samples of classical bulge and/or thick disk stars. Overall, our results point to the existence of complex patterns and structures in the bulge\n\nHorizontal baffle for nuclear reactors\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRylatt, John A.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nA horizontal baffle disposed in the annulus defined between the core barrel and the thermal liner of a nuclear reactor thereby physically separating the outlet region of the core from the annular area below the horizontal baffle.

The origin of these tidal features is discussed, either coming from a satellite infall or caused by residuals of an ancient, gas-rich major merger. By modelling the formation of the peculiar features observed in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET-2 with implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled the overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major merger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy properties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp, boxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 Î¼m luminosity distribution. High gas fractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and thick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able to reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red colour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger model cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with a small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type galaxy formed by a relatively recent merger. Then late type, pseudo-bulge spirals are not mandatorily made through secular evolution, and the NGC 4013 properties also illustrate that strong warps in isolated galaxies may well occur at a late phase of a gas-rich major merger.\n\nEffect of baffle spacing and baffle cut on thermal-hydraulic characteristics of the fluid flow\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChernyateva, R.

We examine orbits in an N-body model of a barred disc galaxy that is scaled to match the kinematics of the MW bulge. We generate maps of projected stellar surface density, unsharp masked images, 3D excess-mass distributions (showing mass outside ellipsoids), line-of-sight number count distributions, and 2D line-of-sight kinematics for the simulation as well as co-added orbit families, in order to identify the orbits primarily responsible for the BP/X shape. We estimate that between 19 and 23 per cent of the mass of the bar in this model is associated with the BP/X shape and that the majority of bar orbits contribute to this shape that is clearly seen in projected surface density maps and 3D excess mass for non-resonant box orbits, 'banana' orbits, 'fish/pretzel' orbits and 'brezel' orbits. Although only the latter two families (comprising 7.5 per cent of the total mass) show a distinct X-shape in unsharp masked images, we find that nearly all bar orbit families contribute some mass to the 3D BP/X-shape. All co-added orbit families show a bifurcation in stellar number count distribution with distance that resembles the bifurcation observed in red clump stars in the MW. However, only the box orbit family shows an increasing separation of peaks with increasing galactic latitude |b|, similar to that observed. Our analysis suggests that no single orbit family fully explains all the observed features associated with the MW's BP/X-shaped bulge, but collectively the non-resonant boxes and various resonant boxlet orbits contribute at different distances from the centre to produce this feature. We propose that since box orbits (which are the dominant population in bars) have three incommensurable orbital fundamental frequencies, their 3D shapes are highly flexible and, like Lissajous figures, this family of orbits is most easily able to adapt to\n\nSignatures of bulge triaxiality from kinematics in Baade's window\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Hongsheng; Spergel, David N.; Rich, R. Michael\n\n1994-12-01\n\nWe study a sample of 62 Baade's Window, (l,b) = (1, -4)deg, K giants that have published proper motions, radial velocity, and metallicity. Using R0 = 8 kpc, we construct the velocity ellipsoids, namely the 3x3 velocity dispersion tensors, for the metal rich stars ((Fe/H) greater than or equal to 0) and metal poor stars ((Fe/H) less than or equal to -0.2). After diagonalizing the tensor, we find a vertex deviation characteristic of a nonaxisymmetric system. Eigenvalues for the two velocity ellipsoids (sigma1, sigma2, sigma3) are (126, 89, 65) +/- 13 km/s for the metal rich sample and (154, 77, 83) +/- 25 km/s for the metal poor sample with their long axes pointing to two nearly perpendicular directions (lv, bv) = (-65 +/- 9 deg, +14 +/- 9 deg) and (lv, bv) = (25 +/- 14 deg, -11 +/- 14 deg), respectively. The vertex deviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by any oblate model. We are able to reject the hypothesis that the metal poor and metal rich populations are drawn from the same distribution at better than the 97% confidence level. We populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a Gaussian velocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. We conclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards (l,b) with l less than 0 deg and b = 0 deg as suggested by earlier work on gas dynamics and the observed light distribution. We also predict that low latitude (absolute value of b less than or equal to 4 deg) bulge fields should show the vertex deviation more strongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motion studies. In the classification scheme of Athanassoula et al. (1983) the metal rich stars appear to occupy the B-family orbits which rotate in the prograde sense in the rest frame and have boxy shapes that are aligned with and supporting the bar. The metal poor stars in the sample lag behind the metal rich bulge and appear to occupy R-family orbits which rotate\n\nThermal baffle for fast-breeder reacton\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRylatt, John A.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA liquid-metal-cooled fast-breeder reactor includes a bridge structure for separating hot outlet coolant from relatively cool inlet coolant consisting of an annular stainless steel baffle plate extending between the core barrel surrounding the core and the thermal liner associated with the reactor vessel and resting on ledges thereon, there being inner and outer circumferential webs on the lower surface of the baffle plate and radial webs extending between the circumferential webs, a stainless steel insulating plate completely covering the upper surface of the baffle plate and flex seals between the baffle plate and the ledges on which the baffle plate rests to prevent coolant from washing through the gaps therebetween.

The position at which [Mg/Fe] starts to decrease with [Fe/H], called the \"knee\", is observed in the metal-poor bulge at [Fe/H] knee = -0.37 Â± 0.09, being 0.06 dex higher than that of the thick disk. Although this difference is inside the error bars, it suggest a higher star formation rate (SFR) for the bulge than for the thick disk. We estimate an upper limit for this difference of Î [Fe/H] knee = 0.24 dex. Finally, we present a chemical evolution model that suitably fits the whole bulge sequence by assuming a fast (<1 Gyr) intense burst of stellar formation that takes place at early epochs. Conclusions: We associate metal-rich stars with the bar boxy/peanut bulge formed as the product of secular evolution of the early thin disk. On the other hand, the metal-poor subpopulation might be the product of an early prompt dissipative collapse dominated by massive stars. Nevertheless, our results do not allow us to firmly rule out the possibility that these stars come from the secular evolution of the early thick disk.

Pseudobulges and classical bulges are identified using Sersic index, Hubble Space Telescope morphology, and star formation activity (traced by 8 {mu}m emission). In the near-IR pseudobulges have n{sub b} < 2 and classical bulges have n{sub b} >2, as found in the optical. Sersic index and morphology are essentially equivalent properties for bulge classification purposes. We confirm, using a much more robust sample, that the Sersic index of pseudobulges is uncorrelated with other bulge structural properties, unlikemoreÂ Â» for classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. Also, the half-light radius of pseudobulges is not correlated with any other bulge property. We also find a new correlation between surface brightness and pseudobulge luminosity; pseudobulges become more luminous as they become more dense. Classical bulges follow the well-known scaling relations between surface brightness, luminosity, and half-light radius that are established by elliptical galaxies. We show that those pseudobulges (as indicated by Sersic index and nuclear morphology) that have low specific star formation rates are very similar to models of galaxies in which both a pseudobulge and classical bulge exist. Therefore, pseudobulge identification that relies only on structural indicators is incomplete. Our results, especially those on scaling relations, imply that pseudobulges are very different types of objects than elliptical galaxies.Â«Â less\n\nKINEMATIC SIGNATURES OF BULGES CORRELATE WITH BULGE MORPHOLOGIES AND SERSIC INDEX\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFabricius, Maximilian H.; Saglia, Roberto P.; Bender, Ralf\n\n2012-07-20\n\nWe use the Marcario Low Resolution Spectrograph at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope to study the kinematics of pseudobulges and classical bulges in the nearby universe. We present major axis rotational velocities, velocity dispersions, and h{sub 3} and h{sub 4} moments derived from high-resolution ({sigma}{sub inst} Almost-Equal-To 39 km s{sup -1}) spectra for 45 S0 to Sc galaxies; for 27 of the galaxies we also present minor axis data. We combine our kinematics with bulge-to-disk decompositions. We demonstrate for the first time that purely kinematic diagnostics of the bulge dichotomy agree systematically with those based on Sersic index. Low Sersic index bulgesmoreÂ Â» have both increased rotational support (higher v/{sigma} values) and on average lower central velocity dispersions. Furthermore, we confirm that the same correlation also holds when visual morphologies are used to diagnose bulge type. The previously noted trend of photometrically flattened bulges to have shallower velocity dispersion profiles turns out to be significant and systematic if the Sersic index is used to distinguish between pseudobulges and classical bulges. The anti-correlation between h{sub 3} and v/{sigma} observed in elliptical galaxies is also observed in intermediate-type galaxies, irrespective of bulge type. Finally, we present evidence for formerly undetected counter-rotation in the two systems NGC 3945 and NGC 4736.Â«Â less\n\nExtension of Miles Equation for Ring Baffle Damping Predictions to Small Slosh Amplitudes and Large Baffle Widths\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWest, Jeff; Yang, H. Q.; Brodnick, Jacob; Sansone, Marco; Westra, Douglas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Miles equation has long been used to predict slosh damping in liquid propellant tanks due to ring baffles. The original work by Miles identifies defined limits to its range of application. Recent evaluations of the Space Launch System identified that the Core Stage baffle designs resulted in violating the limits of the application of the Miles equation. This paper describes the work conducted by NASA/MSFC to develop methods to predict slosh damping from ring baffles for conditions for which Miles equation is not applicable. For asymptotically small slosh amplitudes or conversely large baffle widths, an asymptotic expression for slosh damping was developed and calibrated using historical experimental sub-scale slosh damping data. For the parameter space that lies between region of applicability of the asymptotic expression and the Miles equation, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of slosh damping were used to develop an expression for slosh damping. The combined multi-regime slosh prediction methodology is shown to be smooth at regime boundaries and consistent with both sub-scale experimental slosh damping data and the results of validated Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions of slosh damping due to ring baffles.\n\nAdvanced Baffle Materials Technology Development\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-10-01\n\nfew baffle materials, data from Misty North and Diesel Train provide guidance on damage mechanisms and give points with which theory can be compared...adequate to permit correlation of theory with experiment for thin film baffle structures which can be approximated as a series of planes.

Using collisionless N-body simulations, we show that during the formation of such a boxy/peanut bulge, the meridional shear stress of stars, which can be measured by the meridional tilt of the velocity ellipsoid, reaches a characteristic peak in its time evolution. It is shown that the onset of a bar buckling instability is closely connected to the maximum meridional tilt of the stellar velocitymoreÂ Â» ellipsoid. Our findings bring a new insight to this complex gravitational instability of the bar which complements the buckling instability studies based on orbital models. We briefly discuss the observed diagnostics of the stellar velocity ellipsoid during such a phenomenon.Â«Â less\n\nLiquid management in low gravity using baffled rotating containers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGans, R.

The purpose of the retrofit baffle design is to divide the large and fast inflow into smaller and slower flows to increase flow uniformity. This avoids short-circuiting and increases residence time in the sedimentation basin. The newly proposed parallel-connected baffle configuration was assessed in the laboratory by comparing its TSS removal performance and the optimal flow residence time with those from the widely used series-connected baffles. The experimental results showed that the parallel-connected baffles outperformed the series-connected baffles because it could disperse flow faster and in less space by splitting the large inflow into many small branches instead of solely depending on flow internal friction over a longer flow path, as was the case under the series-connected baffles. Being able to dampen faster flow before entering the sedimentation basin is critical to reducing the possibility of disturbing any settled particles, especially under high inflow conditions. Also, for a large sedimentation basin, it may be more economically feasible to deploy the proposed parallel retrofit baffle in the vicinity of the inlet than series-connected baffles throughout the entire settling basin.

The present paper studies the convective instability in a two-dimensional porous enclosure with a horizontal baffle protruding from one of the side walls. The vertical side walls are insulated, while the top and bottom surfaces are maintained at lower and higher constant temperatures, respectively. The present work considers a baffle of high conductivity. We assume the baffle temperature can be considered constant throughout. We ask, for a given enclosure aspect ratio, is the additionmoreÂ Â» of another physical constraint (such as lengthening a baffle) always stabilizing Is there an optimum baffle location and length such that the critical Rayleigh number is maximized In summary, several concluding remarks can be drawn in the following: (1) Other dimensions being same, a centered baffle always results in a more stable state than an off-centered baffle.

For a centered baffle, the maximum R[sup c] occurs for [beta]/[sigma] [ge] ([beta]/[sigma])[sub max]; while for an off-centered baffle, the maximum R[sup c] occurs at ([beta]/[sigma])[sub max].

We refer to them as `bright, compact bulges' (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and constitute Ë12 per cent of the total bulge population at these redshifts. Examining free-bulge + disc decomposition sample and elliptical galaxy sample from Simard et al., we find that only Ë0.2 per cent of the bulges can be classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total light ratio of disc galaxies with BCBs is (at Ë0.4) a factor of Ë2 and Ë4 larger than for those with classical and pseudo-bulges. BCBs are Ë2.5 and Ë6 times more massive than classical and pseudo-bulges. Although disc galaxies with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star formation rate is 1.5-2 times higher than other disc galaxies. This is contrary to the expectations that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host disc galaxies are descendant of massive, compact, and passive elliptical galaxies observed at higher redshifts. Those high-redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and possibly evolved by acquiring a compact disc around them. The overall properties of BCBs support a picture of galaxy assembly in which younger discs are being accreted around massive pre-existing spheroids.\n\nVelocity Dispersions Across Bulge Types\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFabricius, Maximilian; Bender, Ralf; Hopp, Ulrich\n\n2010-06-08\n\nWe present first results from a long-slit spectroscopic survey of bulge kinematics in local spiral galaxies. Our optical spectra were obtained at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope with the LRS spectrograph and have a velocity resolution of 45 km/s (sigma*), which allows us to resolve the velocity dispersions in the bulge regions of most objects in our sample. We find that the velocity dispersion profiles in morphological classical bulge galaxies are always centrally peaked while the velocity dispersion of morphologically disk-like bulges stays relatively flat towards the center--once strongly barred galaxies are discarded.\n\nLiquid inflow to a baffled cylindrical tank during weightlessness\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStaskus, J. V.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nAn experimental investigation was conducted in which the behavior of liquid inflow to a cylindrical tank containing inlet baffles was observed during weightlessness. A single tank radius (2 cm), inlet radius (0.2 cm), and liquid (ethanol)were used. The inlet end of the tank was hemispherical with a 30 deg convergent inlet. All the baffle configurations tested were cylindrically symmetric and mounted coaxially with the tank within the hemispherical end. Both stable and unstable inflow behavior were observed using each baffle. It was found that, depending on which of the baffles was used, the critical inflow velocity at which a transition to unstable inflow began was from 2.5 to 12 times greater than the corresponding velocity in an unbaffled tank.\n\nLiquid metal reactor air cooling baffle\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHunsbedt, Anstein\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA baffle is provided between a relatively hot containment vessel and a relatively cold silo for enhancing air cooling performance. The baffle includes a perforate inner wall positionable outside the containment vessel to define an inner flow riser therebetween, and an imperforate outer wall positionable outside the inner wall to define an outer flow riser therebetween. Apertures in the inner wall allow thermal radiation to pass laterally therethrough to the outer wall, with cooling air flowing upwardly through the inner and outer risers for removing heat.\n\nEnergy Loss, Velocity Distribution, and Temperature Distribution for a Baffled Cylinder Model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrevoort, Maurice J\n\n1937-01-01\n\nA study has been made of the important principles involved in the operation of a baffle for an engine cylinder and shows that cooling can be improved by 20 percent by using a correctly designed baffle.

Brent; Hackel, Lloyd; Harris, Fritz B.\n\n2006-09-19\n\nA laser system includes an optical path having an intracavity relay telescope with a telescope focal point for imaging an output of the gain medium between an image location at or near the gain medium and an image location at or near an output coupler for the laser system. A kinematic mount is provided within a vacuum chamber, and adapted to secure beam baffles near the telescope focal point. An access port on the vacuum chamber is adapted for allowing insertion and removal of the beam baffles. A first baffle formed using an alignment pinhole aperture is used during alignment of the laser system. A second tapered baffle replaces the alignment aperture during operation and acts as a far-field baffle in which off angle beams strike the baffle a grazing angle of incidence, reducing fluence levels at the impact areas.\n\nLongitudinal discharge laser baffles\n\nDOEpatents\n\nWarner, Bruce E.; Ault, Earl R.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe IR baffles placed between the window and the electrode of a longitudinal discharge laser improve laser performance by intercepting off-axis IR radiation from the laser and in doing so reduce window heating and subsequent optical distortion of the laser beam.\n\nSlanted baffle mist eliminator\n\nDOEpatents\n\nVance, Richard F.\n\n1995-11-07\n\nAn apparatus for the elimination of mist from off-gas during vitrification f nuclear waste, where baffles are installed on a slant toward the flow of the off-gasses eliminating the need to expand the cross-sectional area of the duct size.\n\nRemoval of nutrients from septic tank effluent with baffle subsurface-flow constructed wetlands\n\nTreesearch\n\nLihu Cui; Ying Ouyang; Weizhi Yang; Zhujian Huang; Qiaoling Xu; Guangwei Yu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThree new baffle flow constructed wetlands (CWs), namely the baffle horizontal flow CW (Z1), baffle vertical flow CW (Z2) and baffle hybrid flow CW (Z3), along with one traditional horizontal subsurface flow CW (Z4) were designed to test the removal efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the septic tank effluent under varying hydraulic retention times (HRTs...\n\nSteady state modeling of large diameter crystal growth using baffles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSahai, Vivek; Williamson, John; Overfelt, Tony\n\n1991-01-01\n\nBuoyancy driven flow in the crystal melt is one of the leading causes of segregation. Natural convection arises from the presence of thermal and/or solutal gradients in the melt and it is not possible to completely eliminate the convection even in the low gravity environment of space. This paper reports the results of computational modeling research that is being done in preparation for space-based experiments. The commercial finite element code FIDAP was used to simulate the steady convection of a gallium-doped germanium alloy in a Bridgman-Stockbarger furnace. In particular, the study examines the convection-suppressing benefits of inserting cylindrical baffles in the molten region to act as viscous dampers. These thin baffles are assumed to be inert and noncontaminating. The results from this study show the manner in which the streamlines, velocities, and temperature fields at various gravity levels are affected by the presence of baffles. The effects of changing both the number and position of the baffles are examined and the advantages and disadvantages of using baffles are considered.\n\nFloating baffle to improve efficiency of liquid transfer from tanks\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoward, F. S. (Inventor)\n\n1973-01-01\n\nA floating baffle is described which rides up and down on a vertical shaft over a drain in a tank as the liquid level within the tank varies. When the baffle is in the raised position, the liquid is allowed to flow out of the drain at an unrestricted rate. When the baffle is in the lowered position, pull-through of air or gas that is above the liquid is presented, which would interfere and reduce the flow of liquid from the tank.\n\nThe Galactic Bulge Radial Velocity/Abundance Assay\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRich, R. M.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) measured radial velocities for Ë 9500 late-type giants in the Galactic bulge, predominantly from -10Â° < l < +10Â° and -2Â° < b < -10Â°. The project has discovered that the bulge exhibits cylindrical rotation characteristic of bars, and two studies of dynamics (Shen et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2012 MNRAS sub.) find that bar models- either N-body formed from an instability in a preexisting disk, or a self-consistent model- can account for the observed kinematics. Studies of the Plaut field at (l,b) = 0Â°, -8Â° show that alpha enhancement is found in bulge giants even 1 kpc from the nucleus. New infrared studies extending to within 0.25Â° = 35 pc of the Galactic Center find no iron or alpha gradient from Baade's Window (l,b) = 0.9Â°, -3.9Â° to our innermost field, in contrast to the marked gradient observed in the outer bulge. We consider the case of the remarkable globular cluster Terzan 5, which has a strongly bimodal iron and rm [Î±/Fe] within its members, and we consider evidence pro and con that the bulge was assembled from dissolved clusters. The Subaru telescope has the potential to contribute to study of the Galactic bulge, especially using the Hyper Superime-Cam and planned spectroscopic modes, as well as the high resolution spectrograph. The planned Jasmine satellite series may deliver a comprehensive survey of distances and proper motions of bulge stars, and insight into the origin and importance of the X-shaped bulge.\n\nThe intrinsic shape of bulges in the CALIFA survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCostantin, L.; MÃ©ndez-Abreu, J.; Corsini, E. M.; Eliche-Moral, M. C.; Tapia, T.; Morelli, L.; Dalla BontÃ , E.; Pizzella, A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nContext. The intrinsic shape of galactic bulges in nearby galaxies provides crucial information to separate bulge types. Aims: We aim to derive accurate constraints to the intrinsic shape of bulges to provide new clues on their formation mechanisms and set new limitations for future simulations. Methods: We retrieved the intrinsic shape of a sample of CALIFA bulges using a statistical approach. Taking advantage of GalMer numerical simulations of binary mergers we estimated the reliability of the procedure. Analyzing the i-band mock images of resulting lenticular remnants, we studied the intrinsic shape of their bulges at different galaxy inclinations. Finally, we introduced a new (B/A, C/A) diagram to analyze possible correlations between the intrinsic shape and the properties of bulges. Results: We tested the method on simulated lenticular remnants, finding that for galaxies with inclinations of 25Â° â¤ Î¸ â¤ 65Â° we can safely derive the intrinsic shape of their bulges. We found that our CALIFA bulges tend to be nearly oblate systems (66%), with a smaller fraction of prolate spheroids (19%), and triaxial ellipsoids (15%). The majority of triaxial bulges are in barred galaxies (75%). Moreover, we found that bulges with low SÃ©rsic indices or in galaxies with low bulge-to-total luminosity ratios form a heterogeneous class of objects; additionally, bulges in late-type galaxies or in less massive galaxies have no preference for being oblate, prolate, or triaxial. On the contrary, bulges with high SÃ©rsic index, in early-type galaxies, or in more massive galaxies are mostly oblate systems. Conclusions: We concluded that various evolutionary pathways may coexist in galaxies, with merging events and dissipative collapse being the main mechanisms driving the formation of the most massive oblate bulges and bar evolution reshaping the less massive triaxial bulges.\n\nNew light-shielding technique for shortening the baffle length of a star sensor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKawano, Hiroyuki; Sato, Yukio; Mitani, Kenji; Kanai, Hiroshi; Hama, Kazumori\n\n2002-10-01\n\nWe have developed a star sensor with a short baffle of 140 mm. Our baffle provides a Sun rejection angle of 35 degrees with stray light attenuation less than the intensity level of a visual magnitude of Mv = +5 for a wide field of view lens of 13x13 degrees. The application of a new light shielding technique taking advantage of total internal reflection phenomena enables us to reduce the baffle length to about three fourths that of the conventional two-stage baffle. We have introduced two ideas to make the baffle length shorter. The one is the application of a nearly half sphere convex lens as the first focusing lens. The bottom surface reflects the scattering rays with high incident angles of over 50 degrees by using the total internal reflection phenomena. The other is the painting of the surface of the baffle with not frosted but gloss black paint. The gloss black paint enables most of the specular reflection rays to go back to outer space without scattering. We confirm the baffle performance mentioned above by scattering ray tracing simulation and a light attenuation experiment in a darkroom on the ground.\n\nReflective baffle for BepiColombo mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRugi-Grond, E.; Weigel, T.; Herren, A.; Dominguez Calvo, M.; KrÃ¤henbÃ¼hl, U.; Mouricaud, D.; Vayssade, H.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe BepiColombo Spacecraft can't tolerate to absorb a major fraction of the off-axis sunlight through larger payload apertures. Fortunately, there are solutions to design baffles such that they reflect the incoming radiation back through the front aperture rather than absorbing it. A Design Study, sponsored by ESA and performed by Contraves Space together with SAGEM DÃ©fense SecuritÃ©, has analysed the potential of various solutions and assessed the options to manufacture them. The selected configuration has been analysed in detail for the optical, mechanical and thermal performance as well as the impact on mass and power dissipation. The size of the baffle was adapted to the needs of the BepiColombo Laser Altimeter (BELA) payload.\n\nBaffleText: a Human Interactive Proof\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChew, Monica; Baird, Henry S.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nInternet services designed for human use are being abused by programs. We present a defense against such attacks in the form of a CAPTCHA (Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that exploits the difference in ability between humans and machines in reading images of text. CAPTCHAs are a special case of 'human interactive proofs,' a broad class of security protocols that allow people to identify themselves over networks as members of given groups. We point out vulnerabilities of reading-based CAPTCHAs to dictionary and computer-vision attacks. We also draw on the literature on the psychophysics of human reading, which suggests fresh defenses available to CAPTCHAs. Motivated by these considerations, we propose BaffleText, a CAPTCHA which uses non-English pronounceable words to defend against dictionary attacks, and Gestalt-motivated image-masking degradations to defend against image restoration attacks. Experiments on human subjects confirm the human legibility and user acceptance of BaffleText images. We have found an image-complexity measure that correlates well with user acceptance and assists in engineering the generation of challenges to fit the ability gap. Recent computer-vision attacks, run independently by Mori and Jitendra, suggest that BaffleText is stronger than two existing CAPTCHAs.\n\nJupiter's hydrogen bulge: A Cassini perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMelin, Henrik; Stallard, T. S.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe present observations of H Ly-Î± and H2 emissions on the body of Jupiter obtained during the Cassini flyby in late 2000 and early 2001. The H Ly-Î± emission is highly organised by System III longitude and latitude, peaking at a brightness of 22 kR between 90 and 120Â° longitude. This is known as the H Ly-Î± 'bulge'. These observations add to a number of previous studies, showing that the feature is very long-lived, present over several decades. We show that there is a strong correlation between the prevailing solar H Ly-Î± flux (measured at Earth) and the peak brightness of the H Ly-Î± bulge at Jupiter, which supports the notion that it is primarily driven by solar resonance scatter. The H Ly-Î± brightness distribution is not aligned with the jovigraphic equator, but is approximately aligned with the particle drift equator of some, but not all, major Jupiter magnetic field models. On the time scale of days, the bulge region appears twice as variable as the non-bulge region. We propose that the electron recombination of H3+ is an important reaction for the generation of the H Ly-Î± bulge, which requires an enhancement of soft electrons at the location of the bulge. We derive an equatorial H3+ lifetime of 1.6 Â± 0.4 h and a corresponding column averaged electron density of 1.7 Ã 109 m-3.\n\nRecognition of DNA/RNA bulges by antimicrobial and antitumor metallohelices.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalina, Jaroslav; Scott, Peter; Brabec, Viktor\n\n2015-09-07\n\nBulged structures have been identified in nucleic acids and have been shown to be linked to biomolecular processes involved in numerous diseases. Thus, chemical agents with affinity for bulged nucleic acids are of general biological significance. Herein, the mechanism of specific recognition and stabilization of bulged DNA and RNA by helical bimetallic species was established through detailed molecular biophysics and biochemistry assays. These agents, known as 'flexicates', are potential mimetics of Î±-helical peptides in cancer treatment, exhibiting antimicrobial and antitumor effects. The flexicates have positive impacts on the thermal stability of DNA duplexes containing bulges, which means that the flexicates interact with the duplexes containing bulges, and that these interactions stabilize the secondary structures of these duplexes. Notably, the stabilising effect of the flexicates increases with the size of the bulge, the maximal stabilization is observed for the duplexes containing a bulge composed of at least three bases. The flexicates bind most preferentially to the bulges composed of pyrimidines flanked on both sides also by pyrimidines. It is suggested that it is so because these bulges exhibit greatest conformational variability in comparison with other combinations of bases in the bulge loop and bases flanking the bulge. Finally, the results indicate that there is only one dominant binding site for the flexicates on the DNA and RNA bulges and that the flexicates bind directly to the bulge or in its close proximity. It is also shown that the flexicates effectively bind to RNA duplexes containing the bulged region of HIV-1 TAR RNA.\n\nViolent transient sloshing-wave interaction with a baffle in a three-dimensional numerical tank\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXue, Mi-An; Zheng, Jinhai; Lin, Pengzhi; Xiao, Zhong\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA finite difference model for solving Navier Stokes equations with turbulence taken into account is used to investigate viscous liquid sloshing-wave interaction with baffles in a tank. The volume-of-fluid and virtual boundary force methods are employed to simulate free surface flow interaction with structures. A liquid sloshing experimental apparatus was established to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model, as well as to study nonlinear sloshing in a prismatic tank with the baffles. Damping effects of sloshing in a rectangular tank with bottom-mounted vertical baffles and vertical baffles touching the free surface are studied numerically and experimentally. Good agreement is obtained between the present numerical results and experimental data. The numerical results match well with the current experimental data for strong nonlinear sloshing with large free surface slopes. The reduction in sloshing-wave elevation and impact pressure induced by the bottom-mounted vertical baffle and the vertical baffle touching the free surface is estimated by varying the external excitation frequency and the location and height of the vertical baffle under horizontal excitation.\n\nThe Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. V. Statistical Study of Bars and Buckled Bars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Zhao-Yu; Ho, Luis C.; Barth, Aaron J.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nSimulations have shown that bars are subject to a vertical buckling instability that transforms thin bars into boxy or peanut-shaped structures, but the physical conditions necessary for buckling to occur are not fully understood. We use the large sample of local disk galaxies in the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey to examine the incidence of bars and buckled bars across the Hubble sequence. Depending on the disk inclination angle (I), a buckled bar reveals itself as either a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge (at high I) or as a barlens structure (at low I). We visually identify bars, boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, and barlenses, and examine the dependence of bar and buckled bar fractions on host galaxy properties, including Hubble type, stellar mass, color, and gas mass fraction. We find that the barred and unbarred disks show similar distributions in these physical parameters. The bar fraction is higher (70%-80%) in late-type disks with low stellar mass (M * < 1010.5 M â) and high gas mass ratio. In contrast, the buckled bar fraction increases to 80% toward massive and early-type disks (M * > 1010.5 M â), and decreases with higher gas mass ratio. These results suggest that bars are more difficult to grow in massive disks that are dynamically hotter than low-mass disks. However, once a bar forms, it can easily buckle in the massive disks, where a deeper potential can sustain the vertical resonant orbits. We also find a probable buckling bar candidate (ESO 506-G004) that could provide further clues to understand the timescale of the buckling process.\n\nRecognition of DNA bulges by dinuclear iron(II) metallosupramolecular helicates.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalina, Jaroslav; Hannon, Michael J; Brabec, Viktor\n\n2014-02-01\n\nBulged DNA structures are of general biological significance because of their important roles in a number of biochemical processes. Compounds capable of targeting bulged DNA sequences can be used as probes for studying their role in nucleic acid function, or could even have significant therapeutic potential. The interaction of [Fe(2)L(3)](4+) metallosupramolecular helicates (L = C(25)H(20)N(4)) with DNA duplexes containing bulges has been studied by measurement of the DNA melting temperature and gel electrophoresis. This study was aimed at exploring binding affinities of the helicates for DNA bulges of various sizes and nucleotide sequences. The studies reported herein reveal that both enantiomers of [Fe(2)L(3)](4+) bind to DNA bulges containing at least two unpaired nucleotides. In addition, these helicates show considerably enhanced affinity for duplexes containing unpaired pyrimidines in the bulge and/or pyrimidines flanking the bulge on both sides. We suggest that the bulge creates the structural motif, such as the triangular prismatic pocket formed by the unpaired bulge bases, to accommodate the [Fe(2)L(3)](4+) helicate molecule, and is probably responsible for the affinity for duplexes with a varying number of bulge bases. Our results reveal that DNA bulges represent another example of unusual DNA structures recognized by dinuclear iron(II) ([Fe(2)L(3)](4+)) supramolecular helicates.

The calibrated CFD model is proven to have great predictive ability by compared against the flight experimental results. The pressure increase, thermal stratification and wall heat transfer coefficient of LH 2 tank have been detailedly studied. The results indicate that slosh baffles have a great influence on tank pressure increase, fluid temperature distribution and wall heat transfer. Owning to the existence of baffles, the stratification thickness increases gradually with the distance from tank axis to tank wall. While for the tank without baffles, the stratification thickness decreases firstly and then increases with the increase of the distance from the axis. The \"M\" type stratified thickness distribution presents in tank without baffles. One modified heat transfer coefficient correlation has been proposed with the change of fluid temperature considered by multiplying a temperature correction factor. It has been proven that the average relative prediction errors of heat transfer coefficient reduced from 19.08% to 4.98% for the wet tank wall of the tank, from 8.93% to 4.27% for the dry tank wall, respectively, calculated by the modified correlation.

The curvature of the microchannel and the radial baffles induce vortices in different directions. The multidirectional vortices and the converging-diverging flow caused by the baffles contribute together to the enhancement of mixing. The micromixer is fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane by a single planar microlithography process and the mixing behaviors are observed by a confocal spectral microscope imaging system to validate the simulation obtained by a commercial code. The simulation and experimental results are in reasonable agreement. The concentration distributions and flow patterns obtained reveal the following trends. (i) The mixing efficiency of the basic C-shaped micromixer with the first baffle attached to the internal cylinder and the second attached to the external cylinder is better than that of the C-shaped micromixer with inverted arrangement of baffles. (ii) When the radius of the curved channel and the width of the passage between the baffle and the cylindrical wall are small enough and the Reynolds number (Re) is large enough, an extra separation vortex develops in the downstream of the second baffle. This phenomenon is one of the reasons of trend (i). (iii) A micromixer consisting of a few basic C-shaped micromixers connected by straight channels may generate a high degree of mixing for the case with a large Re.

[for wind tunnels\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSoderman, P. T.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nAcoustical performance and pressure drop were measured for two types of splitters designed to attenuate sound propagating in ducts - resonant-cavity baffles and fiberglass-filled baffles. Arrays of four baffles were evaluated in the 7- by 10-foot wind tunnel number 1 at Ames Research Center at flow speeds from 0 to 41 m/sec. The baffles were 2.1 m high, 305 to 406 mm thick, and 3.1 to 4.4 m long. Emphasis was on measurements of silencer insertion loss as affected by variations of such parameters as baffle length, baffle thickness, perforated skin geometry, cavity size and shape, cavity damping, wind speed, and acoustic field directivity. An analytical method for predicting silencer performance is described and compared with measurements. With the addition of cavity damping in the form of 25-mm foam linings, the insertion loss above 250 Hz of the resonant-cavity baffles was improved 2 to 7 db compared with the undamped baffles; the loss became equal to or greater than the insertion loss of comparable size fiberglass baffles at frequencies above 250 Hz. Variations of cavity size and shape showed that a series of cavities with triangular cross-sections (i.e., variable depth) were superior to cavities with rectangular cross sections (i.e., constant depth). In wind, the undamped, resonant-cavity baffles generated loud cavity-resonance tones; the tones could be eliminated by cavity damping.\n\nNuclear starburst activity induced by elongated bulges in spiral galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Eunbin; Kim, Sungsoo S.; Choi, Yun-Young; Lee, Gwang-Ho; de Grijs, Richard; Lee, Myung Gyoon; Hwang, Ho Seong\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe study the effects of bulge elongation on the star formation activity in the centres of spiral galaxies using the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We construct a volume-limited sample of face-on spiral galaxies with Mr < -19.5 mag at 0.02 â¤z< 0.055 by excluding barred galaxies, where the aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibre covers the bulges of the galaxies. We adopt the ellipticity of bulges measured by Simard et al. (2011) who performed two-dimensional bulge+disc decompositions using the SDSS images of galaxies, and identify nuclear starbursts using the fibre specific star formation rates derived from the SDSS spectra. We find a statistically significant correlation between bulge elongation and nuclear starbursts in the sense that the fraction of nuclear starbursts increases with bulge elongation. This correlation is more prominent for fainter and redder galaxies, which exhibit higher ratios of elongated bulges. We find no significant environmental dependence of the correlation between bulge elongation and nuclear starbursts. These results suggest that non-axisymmetric bulges can efficiently feed the gas into the centre of galaxies to trigger nuclear starburst activity.\n\nTree crickets optimize the acoustics of baffles to exaggerate their mate-attraction signal\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBalakrishnan, Rohini; Robert, Daniel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObject manufacture in insects is typically inherited, and believed to be highly stereotyped. Optimization, the ability to select the functionally best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function, implies flexibility and is usually thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour. Here, we show that tree-crickets optimize acoustic baffles, objects that are used to increase the effective loudness of mate-attraction calls. We quantified the acoustic efficiency of all baffles within the naturally feasible design space using finite-element modelling and found that design affects efficiency significantly. We tested the baffle-making behaviour of tree crickets in a series of experimental contexts. We found that given the opportunity, tree crickets optimised baffle acoustics; they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle. Surprisingly, optimization could be achieved in a single attempt, and is likely to be achieved through an inherited yet highly accurate behavioural heuristic.
