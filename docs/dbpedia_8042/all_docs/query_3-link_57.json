        "text": "Our History and Mission\n\nThe Office of Postdoctoral Affairs is part of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). Established in 2000, to support postdoctoral investigators, fellows, faculty, and administrators, the office handles both postdoc recruitment and termination and provides a mechanism for conflict resolution if such a need arises.\n\nAs part of our mission we maintain a productive and welcoming environment so that postdoctoral fellows can make the most of their training. Although the responsibility for career advancement is ultimately that of each fellow, our goal is to facilitate this by developing seminars, workshops, and other resources that provide information for career development, grant writing, communication skills, conflict resolution, and responsible conduct in research. We also serve as an advocate for all postdoctoral fellows, working to create a sense of family while they are here at ISMMS.\n\nQuality of life is an important foundation for success in study and work. The Office assists in finding convenient, affordable housing within easy walking distance of Mount Sinai Hospital, and we organize social and networking activities, lunches, social evenings, and roundtables on important professional issues. We also encourage and support postdoc-initiated activities and endeavors.\n\nLeadership\n\nUnder the leadership of the Dean of The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, a senior member of the ISMMS faculty serves as our Faculty Director. Our team is dedicated to providing you with the information, support, and services that you need to make the most of your Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) postdoctoral training. Please contact us with any questions or concerns.\n\nBasil Hanss, PhD\n\nSenior Associate Dean for Postdoctoral and Student Affairs\n\nAssociate Dean for Graduate School Wellbeing and Resilience\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Medicine\n\nbasil.hanss@mssm.edu\n\nKathy Dilks, EdD\n\nDirector of Postdoctoral and Student Affairs\n\nkathleen.dilks@mssm.edu\n\nAndrea Wells\n\nProgram Manager for Postdoctoral Affairs\n\nandrea.wells@mssm.edu"
