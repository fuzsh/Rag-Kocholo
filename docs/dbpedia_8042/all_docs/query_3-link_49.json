        "text": "1. AUG 202012 Judaica Art by Abstract Artist Michael Rozenvain Judaica Art by Abstract Artist Michael Rozenvain\n\n3. Born in Kiev in the Ukraine in 1963,Michael Rozenvain studied secular and judaica art all of the way through school and finally graduated from the Academy of Decorative Art. In 1990, he moved to Israel after the collapse of the USSR. Since then, he has become well-known for his works of judaica art, producing paintings for numerous exhibitions and fine art galleries for his eager public around the world. He is also responsible for the installation of several large murals and other decorative features in public buildings around Israel, making Michael an artist who is consciously making an effort to put something back into the community and the Judaica Art world. Michael Rozenvain‘s work, whether of people or outdoor scenes, always consists of layers upon layers, creating a depth that is rarely found in paintings by other artists. Within his images, the main element is always the most prominent, yet the keen observer will notice other minor scenes that add to the realism of the overall piece. After all, whether you are sitting in a cafe or watching a band play, there will always be numerous activities going on around you. Michael manages to capture all of this beautifully within his paintings, thanks to his keen eyes and vibrant imagination.\n\n4. No matter what the subject, Michael Rozenvain is not afraid to let both the feel of the scene as well as the physical subject matter shine through in all of his works of art. In this way, he has created a number of bright, lively pieces about everything from piano players and reclining women to street scenes around the Mediterranean. Guided by his conscious and subconscious mind, Michael places a great deal of love and passion into each of his paintings. This ensures that all Rozenvain creations are masterpieces that will be remembered by those who see them for a long time to come.
