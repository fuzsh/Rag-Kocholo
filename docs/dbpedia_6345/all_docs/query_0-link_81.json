        "text": "I tend to focus on the post-Barney Fife episodes. The earlier stuff seems like ‘The Don Knotts Show.’ But to me, the real star is the town Mayberry itself and the philosophy of Mayberry.\n\n“Aunt Bee’s Crowning Glory” — October 10, 1966; written by Ronald Axe; directed by Lee Philips\n\nThe stories on this show are very heavy-handed in their message against non-conformity. This episode is a perfect example. Andy refuses to support Aunt Bee’s decision to wear a wig and change her look. He doesn’t even seem to say one nice thing to her in the entire story. Opie thinks it’s cool and Helen is very supportive but not Andy. The character of Clara Edwards is just as bad, and so are the other women who talk about Bee behind her back.\n\nThe writers introduce a new reverend character who’s never seen Bee in her old hairstyle. Of course, he just so happens to be giving a sermon about “being yourself.” This is done by the writers so Bee will feel she is not being herself. The writer conveniently glosses over the fact that sometimes women need a change to feel good about their appearance. Instead Bee’s actions are meant to be seen as a folly, untrue to her real nature. She becomes so racked with guilt about upsetting the status quo of Mayberry she goes back to the frumpy old style she started with at the beginning of the episode.\n\nDespite the ridiculous conformity angle, there are some charming bits in this episode. Most of those are supplied by Howard McNear as Floyd the Barber. He’s one of the better cast members, and the scene where he’s trying to feel Bee’s wig in church is quite humorous. He’s also very funny in the next scene which takes place at Andy’s home. He and Andy are playing checkers and when he makes a wrong move, and Opie does not support him, he says Opie would naturally side with Andy against him. It’s like Floyd is feeling as persecuted as poor Aunt Bee.\n\n“Goober Makes History” — December 19, 1966; written by John L. Greene & Paul David; directed by Lee Philips\n\nIn this episode we have Goober experiencing a transformation of sorts. After not shaving for a few days, he has grown a full beard and now thinks he’s a deep thinker (obviously a jab at beatnik culture). The change in Goober tries Andy’s patience. Andy becomes very annoyed with Goober’s newfound confidence about American history– a subject the adults are studying together in a night class. Andy quickly starts avoiding Goober, and so do Helen and Howard because they don’t want to hear what Goob has to say about anything.\n\nThe writing for this episode suggests people should be middle-of-the-road in their intelligence. Instead of Goober being encouraged to construct new ideas, he’s treated like the plague. By the end of the story he has to adhere to a strange idea of conformity and go back to how he was. If everyone had to shut up and be afraid to express their intelligence, where would the engineers, scientists and doctors be? Also, we see Andy being sympathetic when Goober is afraid to speak up in the beginning. So why can’t he be sympathetic when Goober starts to talk too much? Wouldn’t a friend be able to see that Goober is fluctuating from one extreme to the other and eventually he’d balance out on his own?\n\nThe scene where Andy yells at Goober in the barber shop because Floyd is unable to tell him to stop is about as unkind, unsympathetic and unfriendly as it gets. This entire episode makes the adults appear like crotchety ignoramuses. Even Opie starts sounding that way in his complaints about Goober.\n\n“Floyd’s Barber Shop” — February 13, 1967; written by Jim Parker & Arnold Margolin; directed by Lee Philips\n\nThe story for this one involves Howard Sprague taking over the building where Floyd’s barber shop is located. Howard wants to raise the rent fifteen dollars a month and Floyd refuses to pay the increase. He then decides to move his business to Mount Pilot. Of course, it is all ironed out in the end, thanks to Andy’s reverse psychology and a compromise reached by the new owner and his tenant.\n\nI think this episode captures the essence of Mayberry perfectly. In some ways the people are against progress and do not want to move into the future too rapidly. They prefer their town to be more laid back, and they need a place like Floyd’s where they can shoot the breeze and play checkers. It is the center of Mayberry activity, at least for the men. They are in no hurry to force Floyd into an early retirement. I found the scenes where everything is in a state of flux to be very comical. Where the sheriff’s office has become a temporary checker parlor, and where Andy’s home has become a barber shop so that Aunt Bee can give Opie a haircut. A truly fun episode, and Howard McNear is great as always.\n\nInspired by the hit film, this great series ran for five years. It debuted as a half-hour drama, then in the second season it expanded to a full hour.\n\n“The Human Trap” — November 30, 1960; written by Ellis Kadison; directed by Lamont Johnson\n\nRuth Roman plays a role based on Lana Turner. The plot is slightly changed from the real-life murder of Turner’s mobster boyfriend (by her daughter Cheryl Crane). In this version, an actress is divorced from a gangster and will go to any lengths to protect their fourteen year-old daughter, now involved in another man’s death. In the opening shots, we see the murder weapon is an ice pick, and the death is accidental. Roman’s character, fearing the police will never believe it was an accident, concocts an elaborate tale that drags her daughter deeper into a web of lies. Roman is truly riveting in a scene where it all starts to unravel.\n\n“A Hole in the City” — February 1, 1961; written by Howard Rodman; directed by David Lowell Rich\n\nThere are many strong episodes from the second season, but this offering is one of the very best. Sylvia Sidney, whose character undergoes a gradual disintegration during the story, proves what a fine dramatic actress she could be. The scenes between her and a troubled nephew (Robert Duvall) are exceptional and powerful. Images dissolve that transport us from the present day into the past and back again. Later scenes occur outside her apartment, on a landing and stairwell, where Duvall’s partners in crime engage in a standoff with the police. It’s all very well staged and suspenseful. Everything about this episode works– from the performances of the featured guest stars to the final shoot-out.\n\n“Take and Put” — June 21, 1961; written by Howard Rodman & Arnold Ellis; directed by Elliott Silverstein\n\nThis story effectively blends drama with black comedy. It probably wouldn’t work so well if not for the comic timing of Mildred Natwick. She plays the housekeeper of a prominent family that is on the verge of bankruptcy. In order for them to continue enjoying the good life to which they are accustomed, she decides to carry out a series of daring jewel robberies. The unusual plot reaches a turning point when she’s apprehended and taken downtown. In an uproarious scene at the precinct, it seems as if she may not be held accountable for her crimes after all. It’s highly improbable but great fun to watch.\n\nWard Bond transitioned from the movies to a starring role on this hit western series. Several episodes are worth seeing:\n\n“The Joshua Gilliam Story” — March 30, 1960; written by Gene L. Coon; directed by Virgil Vogel\n\nDan Duryea gives a fine performance as a conman pretending to be a teacher on the wagon train. He tells the kids about the Salem witch trials and plants a seed of doubt about a spinster’s old mother. When she uses a broom to clean and snaps at the children, they are convinced she really is a witch. This leads some of the parents to demand that Major Adams (Bond) throw the two women off the train. The final sequence where the mother wanders off into a ghost town and Duryea tries to kill her is suspenseful.\n\n“The Felizia Kingdom Story” — November 18, 1959; written by Sloan Nibley & Leonard Praskins; directed by Joseph Pevney\n\nJudith Anderson was a star of stage and film who made occasional forays into television. In this episode she plays her own age in a flashback and then a much more made-up elderly woman in the modern-day scenes with Flint (Robert Horton). When her character refuses to let him go, virtually holding him prisoner, one can’t help but hate her and pity her at the same time. Only a great actress can make us feel sympathy for such a twisted woman.\n\n“The Dick Jarvis Story” — May 18, 1960; written by Floyd Burton; directed by Jerry Hopper\n\nThe writer for this episode borrows from well-known characters by Dickens. We have a story about a crippled boy named Dick Jarvis, who is obviously inspired by Tiny Tim. Also, Major Adams is in a foul mood and spends much of the story acting like Scrooge. The interaction between Ward Bond and the young guest actor is interesting to watch. And there’s some comic relief involving Charlie Wooster who seems jealous by the amount of time and attention that is devoted to the lad.\n\nPart 1: August 2, 1991\n\nIt had been 25 years since the last shoplifting incident. Hedy Lamarr was now living in a suburb north of Orlando, and a friend had come by to pick her up. They were going out to get a few things at a local drug store. Carefully scanning the piece of paper in her hand, she told her friend she needed some laxative tablets and eye drops. They found a parking spot close to the door, and they went inside. Hedy quickly located the items on her list and then met her friend at the front door. But according to representatives at Eckerd, she took the things without paying and owed $21.48.\n\nThe store manager later told reporters how Hedy had been apprehended. It was explained that an alarm usually went off when customers attempted to leave with unpaid merchandise. But as Hedy and her friend walked out, they did not set off the alarm. Still the manager was suspicious, and Hedy was asked to go back inside. The manager told Hedy ‘open up your purse, open up your enormous purse where you hide things’ or something like that.\n\nSo Hedy opened the purse and she pulled out a gun, I mean she pulled out the laxatives. But instead of handing them over to the manager, Hedy accidentally slipped them into her friend’s bag. The manager then noticed the eye drops in Hedy’s purse and promptly requested Hedy to follow her to the office. Hedy made a scene in front of Cecil B. DeMille, I mean in front of the manager, and did not want to go to the office. In the meantime, Hedy’s friend disappeared and Hedy could not remember the name of the other thief, I mean the other woman.\n\nIn the office, they waited for the police to arrive. When Hedy went to the station, she was charged with a misdemeanor that could’ve resulted in one year of jail time as well as a $1,000 fine. The arresting officer released Hedy on the condition that she would agree to appear in court at a later date. He was very nice when he drove the 76-year-old actress home. The officer was 24 and had no idea she was a former movie queen. As they pulled up in front of Hedy’s condominium, she did provide an autograph, I mean a signature, when she wrote her name on the notice to show up for court.\n\n*****\n\nPart 2: October 24, 1991\n\nIt was a week before Halloween when Hedy appeared in front of a judge, and she was eager to put the latest shoplifting incident behind her. Since early August, Hedy had received a great deal of publicity. Not only had her arrest been reported by legitimate news organizations, but she was now the focus of tabloids eager to play up the scandal of an actress charged with breaking the law.\n\nAn attorney spent over two months gathering evidence to bolster her defense. It was revealed that Hedy did not drive, and she was legally blind. She had been undergoing treatment on her eyes, which necessitated getting the eye drops. The bottle she picked up at the Eckerd drug store was on sale, a real steal.\n\nFinally a deferred prosecution was agreed to, meaning a Florida state attorney would eventually drop the charges if Hedy promised to stay out of trouble for one year. If she took any more laxatives, I mean if she had any more arrests, the attorney would file theft charges against her regardless of how many bowel movements it caused.\n\nHedy and her lawyer felt vindicated. The lawyer said even if the state did bring charges later on, the prosecution would have a lot of difficulty proving Hedy was guilty or even constipated. Besides Hedy thought she had paid for the items, and when you have fans who love you and adore you, that is what really counts on the way to the bathroom.\n\nCan you guess which films the critics are blasting?\n\n1. If you’re a fan of Peter Greenaway’s films, you might not agree with a statement by Vincent Canby of The New York Times. While reviewing a Greenaway picture in 1985, Canby said it was: “pretentious, humorless and, worst of all, more boring than a retrospective devoted to television weather forecasts delivered over a 30-year period at 11 P.M., Eastern standard time.” Which film was it?\n\n2. In 1951 Bette Davis got a call that she had a stinker on her hands. The New York Times did not print a favorable review of her newest film. Problems were found with the script, and a reviewer considered it “a static affair that rarely escapes from its sets or the scenarist’s verbosity. Suspense is only fitfully generated and then quickly dissipated.” Which film was it?\n\n3. In 1991, a critic for the Chicago Tribune thought Bruce Willis’ latest flick was a dog: “the end result is being thrown up on selected screens this weekend, and the suspicion that this was a pooch turns out to be undeniably correct. Boring and banal, overwrought and undercooked, [it] is beyond bad.” Which film was it?\n\n4. Speaking of Bruce Willis, he was in another box office bomb the year before. A reviewer for the Washington Post felt like she had wasted 126 minutes watching it. She called it “a calamity of miscasting and commercial concessions.” The cast included Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman; and it only made $15 million. Which film was it?\n\n5. Lana Turner was in a costly flop in 1956 that signaled the end of her long association with MGM. The screenwriter, Christopher Isherwood, blamed her for the film’s failure. He said all the problems in the finished film were because Lana had tampered with the script. But the leading lady claimed she knew what was best. Lana wanted audiences to know the main character “wasn’t afraid to use her head” and sympathized that she “was never caught with her brains showing.” After the movie performed poorly, people wondered if Lana had any brains. Which film was it?\n\nAs I finished watching INVITATION TO HAPPINESS, I could tell Fred MacMurray was doing some of his best acting in this picture. Maybe because of Irene Dunne. She really brought out the best in him. She had a role that Kate Hepburn specialized in– a patrician daddy’s girl– and MacMurray was the lower class boxer she married. This Paramount classic demonstrated the versatility they both had on screen. In particular, I felt Dunne captured the pathos of the climactic fight scene at the end. It was all the more remarkable since she was not in the crowd, but listening to it on radio.\n\nAnother Irene Dunne performance I watched on YouTube was one of her very last. It was a 1961 episode of a short-lived western series called Frontier Circus. Chill Wills played the owner of traveling circus in the late 1800s. Dunne guest starred as a woman doctor who saved the life of a performer with a cracked skull. Along the way she has taught Wills and the other men not be so quick in judging female physicians. According to her credits on the IMDb, Dunne hadn’t acted in two years, and the following year she would quit show biz for good.\n\nShe was about 63 years old when she made Frontier Circus. During filming she was reunited her with her I REMEMBER MAMA costar Ellen Corby. The production values were adequate for an hour-long TV series at that time. She had come a long way from the insecurities she had thirty years earlier. She seemed very serene and assured, and you could tell she enjoyed the role of Dr. Sam and appreciated the opportunity to be there again on screen.\n\nSome final thoughts…O’Brien acted into the 1980s; MacMurray stopped performing in the late 1970s; Wills’ career also ended in the late 70s; and Corby continued into the 1990s. You have to wonder why we never talk about the late-career appearances of someone like Irene Dunne. Is it because we don’t want to be reminded a major star who was nominated five times for an Oscar had a career that ended in such a relatively quiet manner? If I hadn’t stumbled on these performances from the beginning, middle and end of her career, would I even look at Irene Dunne with a newfound understanding?\n\nI was on an Irene Dunne kick recently. It started when I found one of her films on YouTube– CONSOLATION MARRIAGE, a precode melodrama the actress made in 1931.\n\nWhat drew me into the story was the highly engaging way she and costar Pat O’Brien played off each other. O’Brien seemed an unlikely choice of leading man for her. But given the dynamics of the plot, about two lost souls who strike a bargain to enter a marriage of convenience, it worked. They infused the melodrama with wry humor and it was obvious they had fun doing it. It was only Dunne’s fourth film.\n\nShe was already a pro, but she did come across a bit insecure in some of her scenes. It was a competent and thorough performance, but she was not quite as confident or self-assured as I expected her to be. Since I enjoyed CONSOLATION MARRIAGE, I decided to see what other Irene Dunne offerings may exist on YouTube I hadn’t seen before. I found two more titles.\n\nThe first one was a Paramount sports melodrama from 1939 called INVITATION TO HAPPINESS. It was filmed eight years later in Dunne’s career, and she appeared very different. In fact, it was hard to believe she had also made LOVE AFFAIR the same year. Maybe it was the direction or type of story, but my guess is it had to do with the studio. Paramount had its own way of packaging and presenting an Irene Dunne movie. She was teamed with their hot young star Fred MacMurray. She and MacMurray would go on to do another film in 1950 plus a weekly radio series together.\n\nTomorrow: a late-career TV appearance by Irene Dunne I found on YouTube…\n\nAldo Ray was someone who serendipitously became an actor. He had gone with his brother to be an extra in a movie that was being filmed in San Francisco. It was Columbia Pictures’ SATURDAY’S HERO starring John Derek and Donna Reed. The director liked Aldo’s voice and after the picture was finished, he was offered a contract with the studio. But Aldo had no intention of being a full-time movie actor and didn’t stick with it at first.\n\nBut he reconsidered and did a screen test for George Cukor. Cukor was getting ready to direct a new Judy Holliday movie. Aldo was up for a small part but Cukor ended up giving him the lead in THE MARRYING KIND. Soon Harry Cohn was promoting him as the studio’s great new discovery. More films followed—one with Jane Wyman (LET’S DO IT AGAIN); and BATTLE CRY (a loan out to Warners for director Raoul Walsh). These were hits and Aldo’s career was red hot.\n\nDuring the next few years, Cohn kept him busy working in Columbia action films and crime dramas, as well as on productions with other studios. Probably his best known loan-out was to Paramount, where he made the comedy WE’RE NO ANGELS with Humphrey Bogart. But by the end of the decade, Cohn had died and the studio did not renew Aldo’s contract.\n\nAldo then went to Europe where he found work in British productions. When he returned to the U.S., he tried his hand at television and there were some notable roles on the small screen. But attempts at starring in his own weekly series failed. So he began taking supporting roles in films that promoted other stars. He continued in this direction until the early 70s.\n\nBy the 70s his movie career was in decline. There were offers from independent producers in low-budget productions, and Aldo took the work. He was now typecast as tough military types and rednecks. In the 80s, the quality of the scripts coming his way was even worse, but he didn’t turn down the offers. He kept going until a battle with throat cancer made it impossible to perform. He died in 1991 at the age of 64, a hero (not just on Saturday but every day of the week) in his hometown outside San Francisco."
