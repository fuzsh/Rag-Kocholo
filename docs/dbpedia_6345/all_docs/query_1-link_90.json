I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nArtist Biopics - Part One: March 7\n\n1. The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965)\n\nCharlton Heston as Michelangelo.\n\nIn this sweeping spectacle from the golden age of Hollywood epics, Charlton Heston gives an impassioned performance as Michelangelo, alongside Rex Harrison in a brainy supporting role as Pope Julius II. The film follows the artist’s painting of the Sistine Chapel through the political upheavals of the High Renaissance. Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, this is the Ben Hur of art movies. However, don’t expect the least hint of Michelangelo’s homosexuality from the ultra-conservative Heston.\n\nThe Last Judgement from the Sistine Chapel, by Michelangelo.\n\n2. Moulin Rouge (1952)\n\nJose Ferrer in Moulin Rouge (left), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (right). Ferrer had his legs bound to his upper body and walked on his knees for the role.\n\nWhile not as popular as Baz Luhrmann’s pop-rock musical extravaganza, John Huston’s Moulin Rouge is much more accurate. Jose Ferrer gives a heartbreaking performance as the tortured artist. The memorable supporting cast includes one of our favorites, Christopher Lee as Georges Seurat, and the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor as Jane Avril. The film won Academy Awards in Art Direction and Costume Design for its vivid recreations of Lautrec’s paintings.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor as Jane Avril in one of the film’s Oscar-winning costumes (left), and Jane Avril, 1899 Poster in the Toulouse-Lautrec Museum (right).\n\n3. The Naked Maja (1958)\n\nAva Gardner as Goya’s muse, the Duchess of Alba: publicity photo for The Naked Maja.\n\nIn The Naked Maja, smoldering Ava Gardner plays the inspiration for Francisco Goya’s sexiest nude. If that isn’t reason enough to watch, the film also boasts glorious technicolor and attractive costumes. This film was made during the Hollywood Production Code, so don’t expect any full frontal. Even so, the US Post Office confiscated several thousand publicity postcards of Goya’s original painting, declaring them pornographic. Ironically, the plot of the film follows Goya’s battle against the censorship of the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nThe Nude Maja by Francisco Goya, in the Prado National Museum. The identity of the model is unknown, and in reality she was most likely not the Duchess of Alba.\n\n4. The Moon and Sixpence (1942)\n\nPoster for The Moon and Sixpence.\n\nThis movie is to Paul Gauguin what Citizen Kane was to William Randolph Hearst. Based on a novel by Somerset Maugham, it tells the “fictional” tale of a man who abandons his wife and children to pursue a life of painting. Along the way, he destroys everyone he touches with his lusty exploits, and heads to the South Pacific to paint and cavort with scantily clad island girls. So no, nothing like the life of Paul Gauguin at all. A witty script and the poison-tongued delivery of George Sanders as the artist “Charles Strickland” make for a deliciously wicked character assassination.\n\nTwo Nudes on a Tahitian Beach by Paul Gauguin, in the Honolulu Museum of Art.\n\nArtist Biopics - Part Two: March 14\n\n5. Lust For Life (1956)\n\nKirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh in Lust For Life (left), and detail from Self-Portrait by van Gogh, in the d'Orsay Museum (right).\n\nLust For Life is a good follow-up to The Moon and Sixpence, as it portrays van Gogh’s complicated relationship with Gauguin, played by Anthony Quinn, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for his performance. Kirk Douglas was nominated for best actor for his startling transformation into Vincent van Gogh, and the magnificent art direction was also nominated. This film was shot largely on location in Europe, in the real places the artist painted. The art director and set decorators meticulously recreated the compositions of van Gogh’s most iconic paintings.\n\nThe upcoming Loving Vincent, the first fully painted animated feature, also looks amazing!\n\nKirk Douglas as Van Gogh, painting in one of the films many authentic locations. Douglas practiced painting crows to imitate Van Gogh’s technique in this scene.\n\n6. El Greco (1966)\n\nMel Ferrer and Rosanna Schiaffino in El Greco.\n\nThis steamy Italian biopic follows a forbidden romance between El Greco, played by Mel Ferrer, and betrothed noblewoman Jeronima de las Cuevas, played by the gorgeous Rosanna Schiaffino. This will be a first viewing for me, but available images promise a sumptuous, richly textured production, with more than a pinch of sex appeal.\n\nThe Burial of the Count of Orgaz by El Greco, in the Church of Santo Tome.\n\n7. Rembrandt (1936)\n\nCharles Laughton in Rembrandt (left), and Self-Portrait by Rembrandt van Rijn, in the Mauritshuis (right).\n\nThis will also be my first time viewing Rembrandt. Charles Laughton, one of the most brilliant actors of the 20th Century and not a bad likeness if I do say so myself, plays the artist. He is joined by his real-life wife, the incomparable character actress Elsa Lanchester of Bride of Frankenstein fame, playing Rembrandt’s mistress, Hendrickje Stoffels. Elegant black and white cinematography appears to cleverly use lighting to capture the essence of the artist’s work without the use of color.\n\nElsa Lanchester as Hendrickje Stoffels (left), and detail from a portrait of the real Stoffels by Rembrandt (right). Another inspired casting decision.\n\nClick here for creepier art history movies on TCM from March 21-28.\n\nBy: Griff Stecyk\n\nTCM Presents the Art History Underworld\n\nFor Turner Classic Movies’ programming in the first half of March see my earlier blog.\n\nThis March, Turner Classic Movies is featuring films about art and artists, airing Mondays at primetime. The festival showcases 18 films on themes ranging from conventional biopics to stylish horror-thrillers, all with one thing in common: awesome art! I’ll be tuning for a few of my old favorites, and some newfound gems I can’t wait to watch. Join me for my top ten picks, and leave a comment with your ratings. I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nCreepy Art and Artists: March 21\n\n1. The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947)\n\nBarbara Stanwyck isn’t too pleased with her husband’s portrait of her in The Two Mrs. Carrolls.\n\nIn this slick, Hitchcockian melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays a young woman who falls in love with and weds a widower artist, played by Humphrey Bogart. Only problem is, he has an unfortunate habit of painting his wives as the Angel of Death, and his wives have the unfortunate habit of dying under mysterious circumstances afterward. Studio artist John Decker created original paintings for the movie, recalling female surrealists like Frida Kahlo and Dorothea Tanning with their signature mix of sensuality and brutality.\n\nThe Broken Column by Frida Kahlo in the Dolores Olmedo Museum (left), portrait for The Two Mrs. Carrolls by John Decker (center), and Deirdre by Dorothea Tanning (right).\n\n2. The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)\n\nPortrait of Hurd Hatfield as the prettyboy Dorian by Henrique Martin, from The Picture of Dorian Gray.\n\nBased on Oscar Wilde’s famous morality play of a youth who sells his soul to have a portrait age while he remains eternally young, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a first-rate horror-drama. Though filmed predominantly in beautifully atmospheric black and white, the movie features two blazing color scenes; one of the unspoiled Dorian painted by Henrique Martin, and one of the twisted inner-soul of Dorian by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright. A very young Angela Lansbury in an Oscar-nominated performance is another selling point.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray, turned grotesque by a lifetime of sin, by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright, in the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFakes and Forgers: March 28\n\n3. Scarlet Street (1945)\n\nJoan Bennett, femme fatale with an artistic twist, in Scarlet Street.\n\nScarlet Street is a gritty, disturbing film-noir by German Expressionist director Fritz Lang. Original gangsta’ Edward G. Robinson (himself an avid art collector) plays a hobby painter infatuated with a sultry con artist, played by Joan Bennett. She passes off his amateur paintings as her own work, and sells them behind his back to wealthy collectors convinced she is a primitive-surrealist prodigy. The critics are wowed by her “masculine” touch, an amusingly sexist analysis, considering the paintings used in the movie closely resemble those of contemporary female surrealists. Frida Kahlo comes to mind again, as well as California-born artist Rosa Rolanda. The paintings were done by John Decker who also did The Two Mrs. Carrolls.\n\n“Self-Portrait” of Joan Bennett from Scarlet Street (left), and Autorretrato (self portrait) by Rosa Rolanda, in the Blaisten Collection (right).\n\nFor a perfect Art-History-themed viewing party, or an easy way to impress a date, go to your local Safeway or gourmet grocery for Rembrandt and Van Gogh aged Gouda, two rich and robust cheeses to match a film of visual substance.\n\nPair with your favorite Da Vinci wine for an evening of art-inspired enchantment.\n\nGo to tcm.com for full schedule and detailed showtimes, and be sure to catch our top ten picks, and the eight other wonderful movies in the program. Happy screening, and don’t forget to log onto Sartle after each film to give us your comments. We want to know what you think of our selections!\n\nBy: Griff Stecyk\n\nThink Before You Ink: Girl With Red Balloon\n\nWelcome back to Think Before You Ink, a series where we show the worst of the worst when it comes to tattoos based off of famous works of art. We’re here to remind you that art is to be created, not replicated–especially if it will forever be on your body.\n\nOh Banksy… I am not your biggest fan. Look, I don’t know what graffiti is like throughout the world. I imagine that people love Banksy so much because they’re all from small towns, and if That 70′s Show is to be believed, the only graffiti they’re exposed to is a poorly drawn pot-leaf that makes it look like the water tower is giving Red the finger. But I’m from Oakland, and I see substantially better and more meaningful graffiti getting painted over constantly. Anyway, my personal feelings aside, today we’re going to be looking at Girl With Red Balloon, a shallow pretentious image being turned into shallow (literally, tattoos don’t go that deep) pretentious body “art”. **\n\nThis first artist didn’t even try, so neither will I. Moving on.\n\n*\n\nIf you’re gonna be pretentious, at least do it right. The heavy black lines and dark shading are important for the deep-but-actually-pretty-much-surface-level meaning of the piece. She’s shrouded in darkness, reaching for a bright spot of hope. Also, that style is what makes a Banksy a Banksy. This is just a little girl who lost her balloon, and I remember that childhood pain. It’s about as bad as getting a subpar rendition of an art piece tattooed on your ribs.\n\n*\n\n“So I wanted to get that piece that Banksy did where it’s like a little girl reaching for her innocence, but I wanted to incorporate the fleetingness of time.”\n\nuuuuUUUUUGGGHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh no\n\nWhy are there so many balloons? Please someone tell me through Facebook or Twitter or reblogging wtf the extra three balloons mean.\n\n*\n\nI had to. But honestly I have no right to say anything because I’m listening to his newest album right now… (It’s so good!!)\n\nWhile I will say Justin is a little brat (despite his apology tour), I don’t get the “controversy” being talked about in the comments of this insta pic. All he did was get a dumb tattoo to try to seem deeper than he really is. From what I can glean… people think he “stole” the art? As if someone is going to look at Justin’s arm and be like “yo man, cool tattoo. You design that yourself?” People get too riled up over crappy celebrities, honestly.\n\n*\n\nThat’s it for this week folks, and remember: leave the masterpieces to the masters.\n\n**My opinions are not Sartle’s opinions!\n\nby Maya\n\nBy: Maya Jacobson\n\nKyla and her BFF Beyoncé\n\nHello! My name is Kyla and I “recently” graduated from Stanford last June with a degree in Art History. Last November, I started writing for Sartle, which makes this introduction just a tad bit tardy. Oops!\n\nJust a few things about me: I love cuddles and all things sexy, which I make evident in my writing. I discuss spooning in Marc Chagall’s Over the Town,\n\nscandal in Tintoretto’s The Origin of the Milky Way,\n\nand seductive sisters in Peter Paul Rubens’s The Three Graces.\n\nSo if any of those are your thing, you don’t have to tell us, but you should definitely check those reviews out.\n\nAnd because I’m a Los Angeles native, I enjoy anything and anyone that makes headlines. I’ve written about Ronda Rousey, Lady Gaga, and Beyoncé among others. So hit up the Sartle blog to see how I respond to current events and the media!\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you read more!\n\nBy Kyla\n\nArt News Link Dump: March 4, 2016\n\nReading Le Figaro by Mary Cassatt, 1883. Private Collection\n\nSometimes you just need a giant list of what’s happening in the art world right now so here you go:\n\nIf you didn’t know, Walt Disney and Salvador Dalí were BFFLs and now there’s Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination, an exhibit chronicling their partnership up at the Dalí Museum in Florida from January 23 – June 12, 2016. Here’s a preview:\n\n[via The Dalí]\n\nThe elusive graffiti artist Banksy might have been unmasked! Using geographic profiling, a method often used to track diseases and criminal activity, and math, two professors have determined that Robin Gunningham is the most likely person to be Banksy. Unsurprising since back in 2008 someone else claimed the same thing. [via The Economist]\n\nCalling all talented artists who can imitate Vincent van Gogh’s painting style! The entirely hand painted film Loving Vincent is looking for more painters. It claims to be the first fully painted feature film in the world.\n\n[via Loving Vincent]\n\nThe notoriously litigious estate of Robert Rauschenberg has finally decided that going after art lovers with copyright claims for taking pictures of Rauschenberg’s work isn’t worth it. Spreading art is better. Plus, we’re all broke so it’s not like they’d get much money anyway … [via NYT]\n\nWe’re kind of in love with Adele and Yayoi Kusama. Turns out they’re a little in love with each other! Kusama gave Adele permission to film her When We Were Young video at the Broad Museum in LA for her performance at the 2016 Brit Awards. *swoon*\n\n[via The Broad]\n\nBy: Lauren\n\nThe Revenant: Leo Grunts His Way through Art History to Oscar Gold!\n\nThis year marks the sixth Academy Award nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has survived numerous career pitfalls including the type casting of teen idol-dom, the quotably bad dialogue of Titanic, sharing the screen with cinema’s two biggest scene stealers (a.k.a. Kate Winslet)\n\n…and five epic Oscar losses. But he’s finally done it! Here’s how:\n\nIn The Revenant, DiCaprio survives (SPOILER ALERT) a bear attack, freezing temperatures, multiple arrows and his most unflattering beard yet to hopefully win that coveted gold statue. Along the way, he also takes an awe-inspiring odyssey through Art History.\n\nLooking Down Yosemite Valley, California, 1865 by Albert Bierstadt, in the Birmingham Museum of Art.\n\nAs striking as DiCaprio’s performance is, the real star of The Revenant is its breathtaking vistas. Few artists captured the Romantic idyll of the West quite like Albert Bierstadt. The film explores the dark side of Manifest Destiny, the grandeur of the landscape clashing incongruously with the human depravity. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu presents a nightmarish vision of the American West, far removed from Bierstadt’s sweeping wilderness bathed in golden light.\n\nLocation shot from The Revenant (2015).\n\nInarritu’s depiction of the pioneer spirit gone wrong is more akin to another Bierstadt landscape, which depicts a glowing mountain pass which also happens to be the site of America’s most notorious case of cannibalism. In the winter of 1846-1847, the Donner Party, a group of Christian families, was snowbound in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and survivors, including women and children resorted to feeding on the flesh of the dead.\n\nView of Donner Lake, California by Albert Bierstadt, in the de Young Museum.\n\nTrue to form, Bierstadt’s interpretation is more the West according to Thomas Kinkaid than a place where the last vestige of human decency goes to die. The Revenant’s blending of the beautiful and the depraved would fit right in with a big-screen blockbuster about the Donner Party.\n\nLocation shot from The Revenant.\n\nIn his British Romantic sort of way, J. M. W. Turner had the same idea with his obsession with the sublime. The sublime is basically that place in nature where horror meets exaltation, which describes the film’s depiction of the American landscape perfectly.\n\nSnow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps by J. M. W. Turner, in the Tate Britain.\n\nFrontiersmen crossing snowcapped peaks: scene from The Revenant.\n\nOf course, no stark reimagining of the American ideal would be complete without some mention of the people who had been here for thousands of years before Europeans and white Americans decided to “discover” the West. In prevailing cinema, Native Americans have been either bloodthirsty villains in need of subjugation, whiskey-swilling buffoons, or something more benignly sinister as seen below:\n\nMounted Indians Carrying Spears by Rosa Bonheur, in the Buffalo Bill Center of the West.\n\nFrench artist Rosa Bonheur was a close personal friend of Buffalo Bill’s, and a fan of his Wild West Show. She had never set foot in America, and while she attempted to depict Native Americans with comparative dignity and realism for the era, they nonetheless appear here as props in the white man’s romance of the “Noble Savage.” The Revenant seeks to provide an antidote to this simultaneously fawning and dehumanising myth by offering up a more complex brand of Native American hero; a fierce but just defender coping with the trauma of invasion.\n\nIn the film, a Native American chief searches for a daughter captured by the white men: scene from The Revenant.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio observes a pyramid of skulls: scene from The Revenant.\n\nDirector Inarritu and production designer Jack Fisk conceived of this image as a pyramid of human skulls, alluding to the genocide of Native Americans. After viewing a historic photograph of buffalo skulls stacked in a pyramid, they decided to recreate the real-life photo to represent the mass extinction of the buffalo, resulting from over-hunting by white settlers. Vareshchagin’s The Apotheosis of War offers a haunting glimpse of what the scene might have looked like with the original human skulls.\n\nThe Apotheosis of War by Vasily Vereshchagin, in the State Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nIn another of the film’s surreal dreamscapes, DiCaprio hallucinates the ruins of a church in the wilderness. Fisk drew inspiration from Russian Orthodox religious iconography, but gives the church a primitive New World feel with a disturbing edge. The frescoes on either side of the crucifixion are based on historic etchings of Spanish Catholics torturing indigenous peoples.\n\nProduction still from The Revenant.\n\nThe figure of the Christ is cohesive with traditional church imagery, such as the Isenheim altarpiece, seen below. The frescoes of torture are also surprisingly in line with the historical record of church art. Scenes of violent retribution and hellfire were very popular methods among colonial missionaries for coercing indigenous people into conversion.\n\nThe Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald, in the Unterlinden Museum.\n\nThe redemptive power of faith is given deeply sinister overtones with the depictions of indigenous Americans slaughtered by agents of the Church. That blend of the reverential and the grotesque is a page out of the Hieronymus Bosch school of religious iconography.\n\nThe Last Judgment by Hieronymus Bosch, in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.\n\nI won’t explain how Francis Bacon’s Figure With Meat fits into DiCaprio’s epic journey through Art History, so as not to include too many spoilers. If you’ve seen the movie, you get it. If you haven’t, let’s just say it may be the least attractive nude scene ever captured on film.\n\nFigure with Meat by Francis Bacon, in the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThere, now, aren’t you intrigued. Now you have to see the movie.\n\nCongratulations Leo, you deserved it.\n\nBy: Griff Stecyk\n\nX-Rated Vigee Le Brun: 10 Paintings with Shocking Secrets\n\nFebruary 2016 marks the opening of Vigee Le Brun: Woman Artist in Revolutionary France at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is the first retrospective for Elisabeth Louise Vigee Le Brun, best known as Marie Antoinette’s favorite portrait painter.\n\nIn a life that spanned 86 years, several revolutions and most of the glittering capitals of Europe, Vigee Le Brun knew everyone…and we mean everyone: From Catherine the Great, who allegedly died having sex with a horse; to Lord Byron, who supposedly had sex with his own sister; to Benjamin Franklin, who had sex with pretty much everything; Vigee Le Brun knew them all, and painted most. Her sensational memoirs read like a Jackie Collins novel in petticoats, so we’ve taken the liberty of spicing up your museum-going experience with ten juicy tidbits the brochure left out.\n\n1. Marie Antoinette’s girl squad\n\nThe Princess de Lamballe (left), and the Duchess de Polignac (right) by Vigee Le Brun, in Versailles, France.\n\nLong before Taylor Swift, Marie Antoinette had the original girl squad.\n\nVigee Le Brun painted both of the Queen’s best girlfriends, the Princess de Lamballe and the Duchess de Polignac. The two women couldn’t have been more different, more frenemies than friends. Lamballe had modest looks and a reputation for chastity. To quote Clueless, Vigee Le Brun thought she was “a full-on Monet,” not really pretty, but appearing so at a distance. Polignac had the face of angel, often compared to Raphael’s Madonnas, but she was anything but virginal. She was accused of being Marie Antoinette’s lesbian lover, or alternately her pimp, facilitating the Queen’s affair with Count Axel von Fersen when she wasn’t busy having lesbian sex with her. Lamballe was considered too virtuous and dimwitted for such intrigues, but secretly conspired against Polignac, her rival for the Queen’s favor.\n\nMary Nighy as Lamballe, Kirsten Dunst as Antoinette, and Rose Byrne as Polignac: the original girl squad in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette (2006).\n\nNeither woman fared well in the French Revolution. Lamballe was gang raped and torn to pieces by an angry mob, her breasts and labia impaled on pikes, and her severed head paraded outside the Queen’s window. Polignac escaped, but died of cancer soon after hearing of Marie Antoinette’s execution.\n\n2. Julie Le Brun, Daughter from Hell!\n\nVigee Le Brun and her Daughter, Julie by Vigee Le Brun, in the Louvre Museum, Paris.\n\nVigee Le Brun’s self-portraits with her daughter Julie are among her most beautiful and famous works, but the reality was far from picture perfect. The artist made the radical decision to raise Julie as a single mother, taking her into exile abroad. In Russia, Julie grew into a gorgeous but headstrong teenager who resented her mother’s suffocating love. Against her mother’s wishes, she fell in love with a brooding young secretary with few career prospects. When Julie started starving herself, her mother finally agreed to the marriage. After only two weeks, Julie grew disgusted with her new husband because she didn’t like the way he looked in his robe, and the marriage unravelled.\n\nJulie Le Brun, painted by her mother at age 19, around the time of her marriage.\n\nYears later in Paris, Vigee Le Brun offered Julie, now separated from her husband and impoverished, only minimal financial support because she had “a taste for bad company.” Julie was reduced to selling her own underwear as she lay dying at age 39. Vigee Le Brun’s enemies called her “a heartless mother.”\n\n3. Original supermodel, stripper and porn star!\n\nLady Hamilton as Ariadne by Vigee Le Brun, private collection; reproduction by Henry Bone in the Wallace Collection, London.\n\nEmma, Lady Hamilton was widely considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world, and Vigee Le Brun called her life “the stuff of novels.” Born guttersnipe Amy Lyon, she started out dancing naked on a tabletop at age 15. Emma’s lover Charles Greville sold her to his uncle Sir William Hamilton, Ambassador to Naples, who was 34 years her senior. While married to Sir William she embarked on a highly public affair with Admiral Nelson, Britain’s greatest national hero, presumably with her husband’s approval. This bizarre threesome was featured in wildly popular pornographic cartoons.\n\nErotic cartoon featuring a suspiciously enthusiastic artist sketching Emma while her husband shows off her naked body.\n\nHer beauty attracted artists such as Sir Joshua Reynolds, Angelica Kauffmann and especially George Romney, whose paintings of Emma were reproduced and circulated throughout Europe, making her the Adriana Lima of her time. Vigee Le Brun appreciated her beauty and talent for striking poses, but found her vulgar, horribly dressed and artificial. After the tragic death of Nelson in the battle of Trafalgar, Emma died fat, drunk, penniless and alone. She was portrayed by Vivien Leigh in That Hamilton Woman (1940), said to be Winston Churchill’s favorite film.\n\nReal-life lovers Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier as Emma and Nelson in That Hamilton Woman.\n\n4. Nazi poster girl, had the biggest balls in Prussia\n\nQueen Louise of Prussia by Vigee Le Brun, in the Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the French tried to spread rumors that Queen Louise of Prussia was cuckolding her husband, though she was renowned for her virtue. Despite his attempts to smear her reputation, Queen Louise met with Napoleon after Prussia was defeated and pleaded for more favorable terms of surrender. Napoleon was so impressed by her dignity and courage that he called her, “The only real man in Prussia.” Vigee Le Brun adored Louise, noting her beauty, kindness and graciousness that reminded her of her late patroness Marie Antoinette. During World War II, Hitler adopted Louise as an icon of Aryan womanhood. She was featured in a variety of Nazi propaganda, including the 1945 film Kolberg.\n\nGerman Actress Irene von Meyendorff as Queen Louise in the Nazi Propaganda film, Kolberg. Louise faces off against Napoleon, in this case standing in for the Soviet Union.\n\n5. French whore, daughter of a French whore, great-grandmother of the Queen\n\nPortrait of Hyacinthe Gabrielle Roland by Vigee Le Brun, in the Legion of Honor, San Francisco.\n\nHyacinthe Gabrielle Roland was the bastard daughter of a French actress and an Irishman, who grew up to become a French actress herself and mistress of the Anglo-Irish Marquess of Wellesley. It was said that “no respectable woman could afford to be seen in Hyacinthe’s society.” Through one of Hyacinthe’s 5 bastard children she is Queen Elizabeth II’s great-great-great grandmother. So, the Queen is descended from a long line of bastards and French whores. Hyacinthe’s bastards were notoriously ugly, evil and scheming…not unlike the modern-day Royal family.\n\nSorry, not sorry.\n\n6. Banged her own uncle\n\nPortrait of Countess Skavronskaia by Vigee Le Brun, in the Jacquemart-Andre Museum, Institute of France.\n\nCountess Skavronskaia and two of her five sisters all had sex with their own uncle, Grigory Potemkin, Catherine the Great’s lover and possible secret husband. Skavronskaia’s adoring husband and relatives lavished her with jewels and Paris gowns, which she waved aside indifferently, saying “Why bother?”. The Countess turned laziness into an art form, languishing all day on a divan, wrapped in black silks with no corest, and kept a slave under her bed to tell her stories until she fell asleep.\n\nPortrait of Louise de Kerouaille by Pierre Mignard, in the National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\nDespite her incestuous affair, slave abuse and supreme languor, Vigee Le Brun was delighted by the Countess’ sweet, angelic face.\n\n7. Religious fanatic, niece of Catherine the Great’s sex tester\n\nPortrait of Princess Alexandra Golitsyna with her son Piotr, in the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow.\n\nPrincess Alexandra was raised by her aunt, Countess A. S. Protasova, legendary for her role as “l’eprouveuse” (love tester) of Catherine the Great. Protasova supposedly had sex with Catherine’s potential lovers to make sure they were disease free and up to the challenge of satisfying the Empress. Despite this lascivious background, Alexandra converted to Catholicism, and later converted her husband, three of her children, and several influential members of the Russian Court. This doesn’t seem so scandalous today, but considering Russia was strictly Eastern Orthodox at the time, it was pretty ballsy.\n\nPortrait of Countess A. S. Protasova with Her Niece, by Angelica Kauffman, in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. Princess Alexandra appears on the left, as a young girl.\n\n8. Introduced Indian food to France (it wasn’t a hit)\n\nPortrait of Mohammad Dervish Khan, Private Collection. France.\n\nMohammad Dervish Khan came to France on a mission from India to form an alliance against the British. The Indian entourage of over thirty people held exotic entertainments such as hookah parties and Indian suppers. Marie Antoinette herself tasted their cuisine, but found the spice intolerable. Vigee Le Brun was even invited to a private dinner, at which she was obliged to sit on the floor, and eat curries served with bare hands instead of silverware. She said of the experience, “I’m sorry to say we had a miserable time.”\n\nLouis XVI receives the Islamic Envoy.\n\nVigee Le Brun first spotted Dervish Khan and his father at the Opera and was impressed by their “copper complexions.” As a Muslim, Khan had a religious objection to being painted, but gave in for the sake of diplomacy. He hid the portrait behind his bed and refused to give it up, saying that “it needed a soul.” Vigee Le Brun later had it snuck out of his home, after which he tried to murder his valet for the betrayal. The Franco-Indian alliance was not successful, and according to rumor, Dervish Khan was executed when he returned.\n\n9. Dumb Blond or Evil Genius?\n\nMadame Grand, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nCatherine Grand was born in the steamy splendor of colonial India, where she married a British official when she was barely sixteen, and almost instantly started cheating on him with a middle-aged politician. She fled marriage and India to become a courtesan (high-class hooker) in the courts of England and France. She lived in sin with the Prince de Talleyrand, first Prime Minister of France, until Napoleon forced them to marry to avoid scandal. Marriage cooled their passion, and the newly styled Princesse de Talleyrand made off with an extravagant settlement that allowed her to live the rest of her life in luxury.\n\nCatherine Grand, Princesse de Talleyrand later in life by Francois Gerard, enjoying the fruits of sleeping her way to the top. I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger, but she ain’t messin’ with no…you know the rest.\n\nCatherine Grand was famous for her air-headed but deceptively witty observations and antics, leaving historians to debate whether she was the Jessica Simpson of her time or a brilliant satirist in disguise. When asked where she was from, she always responded, “I am Indian,” In a French phrase which could be misinterpreted as “I am a turkey.” On one occasion, she was entertaining a famous French adventurer, and when asked to read a passage of his memoirs, she accidentally (?) read from the fictional novel Robinson Crusoe instead. We think Madame Grand wasn’t so dumb.\n\n10. When Animals Attack!\n\nPortrait of Anna Pitt as Hebe, in the State Hermitage Museum.\n\nAnna Pitt was the daughter of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, who some historians believe was a closeted homosexual. Vigee Le Brun described Anna as an extremely pretty girl of 16. Her future husband met her when he was a teenager and she was a baby (gross), and said she appeared to be “either dying or actually dead,” but she lived to be 92, thirty years longer than he did.\n\nFor this painting, a friend loaned Vigee Le Brun a live eagle (bottom right). The eagle was accustomed to being kept outside and became agitated indoors, fiercely snapping, trying to break free of its restraints and generally scaring the hell out of the artist. Donald Trump would have been wise to take note:\n\nDon’t miss Vigee Le Brun: Woman Artist in Revolutionary France on view at the Met from February 15 through May 15, 2016. Be sure to bring your smart phone so Sartle can enrich your experience, and your smelling salts in case it’s too hot to handle.\n\nBy: Griff Stecyk\n\n#ArtHistorySoWhite: If the Art World Had Its Own Version of the Oscars\n\nPhoto courtesy of Classical Art Memes\n\nThis past Sunday was the 88th Academy Awards and we all watched beautiful white couples trot down clean crimson carpets. But of course, this awards show will make history for many reasons, one of which being that a little someone finally got himself an Oscar.\n\nBut more importantly, the show targeted the issue of diversity in the realm of film. And the host, comedian Chris Rock, recognized his huge responsibility to respond to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy.\n\nThis got us thinking, if there were an awards show for art the way there is an awards show for film, the demographics for the nominees and winners would probably not be too different.\n\nIf this hypothetical awards show existed, we’re pretty sure we have the winners pinned down. While these are simply predictions, we do believe they’re fairly close, and they demonstrate that it’s not just the Academy but also the art world that is #SoWhite.\n\nBest Picture\n\nMona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci at the Louvre Museum\n\nDuh.\n\nBest Actor\n\nSelf-Portrait with Bandaged Ear by Vincent van Gogh at the Courtauld Gallery\n\nThis is the artist version of getting attacked by a bear.\n\nBest Actress\n\nOlympia by Édouard Manet at the d’Orsay Museum\n\nObviously, she’s a diva.\n\nBest Director\n\nOne: Number 31, 1950 by Jackson Pollock at the Museum of Modern Art\n\nNo, seriously. It’s not as easy as it looks.\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\nAmerican Gothic by Grant Wood at the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nSuch subtlety in the brow.\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nThe Kiss by Gustav Klimt at the Austrian Gallery at Belvedere\n\nThe back of yo’ head is ridiculous!\n\nBest Foreign Language Piece\n\nThe Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí at the Museum of Modern Art\n\nI totally get it, don’t you?\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat at the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nSeurat might have scarily predicted the coming of Kim Kardashian.\n\nBest Short Film\n\nThe Treachery of Images by René Magritte at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art\n\nShort enough that you couldn’t really take the time to process it. But sweet enough that you liked it anyway.\n\nFinally, I would like to end by quoting Chris Rock. While he talks about Hollywood here, this just as easily pertains to the art world. He says, “Hollywood is sorority racist. It’s like, ‘We like you Rhonda, but you’re not a Kappa.’”\n\n“On Wednesdays, we wear pink.” (Portrait of Dido Elizabeth Belle and Lady Elizabeth Murray by Johann Zoffany at Scone Palace)\n\nIf you agree with #ArtHistorySoWhite, then you may want to visit our post on 6 influential African American artists or on Beyoncé’s “Formation” video to learn more about artists of color or check out a break down of Belle, a film inspired by the above painting, staring the amazing Gugu Mbatha-Raw."
