After suddenly receiving a war-widow's pension, she embarks on an adventure to Paris to do so. She stumbles into a showing of Dior's 10th anniversary collection and is befriended by André, the Dior accountant, and Natasha, a Dior model. However, the Dior director, Claudine, resents Ada's intrusion into the exclusive world of haute couture.\n\nDior has fallen on hard financial times and because Ada is willing to pay in cash, they reluctantly agree to make a dress for her. While she remains in Paris for fittings, she stays with André and encourages him to express his affection for NatashaTemplate:--who shares his interest in existential philosophy.\n\nWhen Claudine is forced to fire several of Dior's workers due to financial constraints, Ada organises a strike and forces Claudine and Christian Dior to listen to André's ideas to modernise the business and make it profitable.\n\nAda returns to London with her dress. She loans it to one of her clients, Pamela, a struggling actress. Pamela wears it to an event where it catches fire and is ruined.
