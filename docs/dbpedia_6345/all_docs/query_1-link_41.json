        "text": "The Cape Charles’ theater season is winding down with Art’s Enter’s blockbuster production of the hit Broadway musical “Oliver !” at the Palace Theatre in the Cape Charles historic area. After almost two months of rehearsals so far, the cast and crew are now fine tuning their art to be ready for Opening Night on April 2, 2011. I’m so proud to have been included in this production as the cast is full of truly experienced thespians who really know their stuff ! Having never before acted on the stage in my whole life, this season, my debut season, has been an incredible experience for me. I was first introduced to the Palace’s amateur theatre group by Eva Noonan, a follow Realtor at the Blue Heron Realty Co. Cape Charles office and a 10 year veteran of Palace Theatre productions. Shortly thereafter I was in my very first play, “The Two Mrs. Carrolls”, a murder thriller taking place in the south of France during the roaring twenties. I had tried out for a part unsuccessfully but the director was compassionate enough to actually write-in a small part just for me especially to keep up my interest in theater. It turned out to be quite a wonderful experience although, to my horror, the video made on the play’s opening night revealed my complete lack of acting skills. ( I can tell you that watching a video of one’s first acting efforts is a truly humbling experience ! )\n\nNevertheless, I accepted the role of Dr. Chasuble in Oscar Wilde’s classic “The Importance of Being Earnest”, Palace Theater’s second production of this season. After my debut experience in “Mrs. Carrolls”, I learned a few lessons in humility and accepted the proffered advice of my fellow actors when it came to shaping my role. I rehearsed my lines relentlessly, using long walks down my 1/2 mile driveway out in the Eastern Shore countryside as my personal “stage”. ( By the time the play was over I think I could have recited all my lines in my sleep, backwards ! ) It must have been hilarious to hear me coming down the country lane, repeating my lines with an aristocratic British accent! Remarks from members of the audience who had seen my first production sounded like rave reviews of my performance and I have been pronounced the “most improved actor” of the season so far. Now, with “Oliver !” in the making, I have much more confidence than ever and, unbelievably, I am actually learning how to sing and dance, although I don’t think Michael Crawford has anything to worry about from me…… just yet. From murder mystery to 19th century British satire to a Broadway musical in just one season, what an experience ! What fun this has been, what an incredible pleasure it is to have become part of the thriving, dynamic arts community here on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, they really welcomed me and made me feel at home. Like the Artful Dodger, they said Consider Yourself One Of Us ! ( Check out the Palace Theatre and Arts Enter at www.artsenter.org )\n\nOnce again we’re looking forward to play time at the historic Palace Theatre in Cape Charles, Virginia. ( See September, 2010 posts about Arts Enter’s first play of the 2010-2011 season, a mystery entitled The Two Mrs. Carrolls . ) This season’s second production by Art’s Enter is a long-time thespian favorite, The Importance Of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde. Interestingly, this clever farce, subtitled A Trivial Comedy For Serious People, was first performed about 1895 and has been kicking around ever since. It was even made into a movie about ten years ago, staring Rupert Everett, Judi Dench, Colin Firth and Tom Wilkenson, some of my favorite British actors, ( Dench especially for her role in the long running BBC series As Time Goes By and Wilkenson as Gerald in the hilariously poignant film, The Full Monty ). According to the Palace’s advance ad, George Bernard Shaw once said that Earnest was the funniest play ever written. It is indeed a very witty piece of writing, a romantic comedy full of clever turns of phrase. I find it pretty amazing that a play which is now 115 years old is still capturing the imaginations of theatre groups all around the country ( take a quick peek at some of the U Tube clips of recent productions of Earnest, especially the clips from South Coast Repertory. )\n\nSo we are planning for a late lunch today at Aqua’s Restaurant overlooking the Chesapeake Bay near the marina and then off to the theatre for the 3:00.pm matinee. I’m looking forward to the Cobb Salad at Aqua. Unbelievably, next Wednesday, as part of an over-all menu revision, I’ve been told they are taking their absolutely delicious Cobb Salad off the menu although it’s their most popular salad and, in my opinion, their best salad, assorted field greens layered with corn kernels, an entire sliced egg, crunchy bacon, perfectly ripened avocado, long crisp cucumber slices, tender grilled chicken, topped with a creamy Parmesan pepper dressing. I’m just asking……. What sense does it make to remove one of your most popular luncheon dishes just because it’s been there nearly since opening day ? Their hamburger has been on since opening day as well — but I’d just about bet the farm that the same hamburger choices are going to make an appearance on the new menu ! ( I think we need a revolt, maybe a “Committee for the Retention of the Cobb Salad at Aqua”. ) My daughter will be likely be having the fish sandwich and clam chowder, safe and secure that fish sandwiches will probably always be on the menu ! Anyway, we all truly enjoy Aqua’s atmosphere and scrumptious food and shall cling to the hope that maybe next spring the beloved Cobb Salad shall re-appear on their menu.\n\nAfter lunch, it’s off to the theatre. We are especially looking forward to seeing David Kabler, broker for Blue Heron Realty Co.’s Cape Charles office, who is playing the role of the vicar, Dr. Chasuble. This is Dave’s second stage role, having made his debut at the Palace earlier this year in the part of Frank Updyke in the Art’s Enter production of the Two Mrs. Carrolls . So it should be a good day, a farewell Cobb Salad followed by playtime at play time in the little town of Cape Charles’ beautifully renovated Palace Theatre. ( P.S. I might mention that Wilde is also known for his short stories, particularly the beautiful The Happy Prince and the ironic The Nightingale and the Rose, both of which can be read on-line at www.shortstoryarchive.com/w/oscar_wilde.html I first read Oscar Wilde when I was in school, having received as a gift a book which was a collection of his short stories and some of his poetry. The stories have stuck with me ever since. )\n\nMy husband, a friend and I spent a delightful Sunday afternoon last week at the historic Palace Theatre in Cape Charles, Virginia watching the matinee performance of ” The Two Mrs. Carrolls”. It was one of those cool, rainy, constant drizzle Sundays that usually make me feel like staying at home with a hot cup of tea, listening to The Splendid Table on NPR or thumbing through the latest Contessa or Mario Batali cookbook, wondering if there is a delicious recipe of less than five ingredients that can be whipped together in 15 minutes ( good luck with that ! ) . However, we had matinee tickets for the play and off we went, rain or no, to see the Mrs. Carrolls.\n\nI was not familiar with that particular play, written by Martin Vale, but the playbill indicates that it is a film noir classic from 1947 and starred Hunphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck. A comic thriller set in the South of France, it revolves around a lovey-dovey, newly- wed English couple ( but the husband, an artist, has a roving eye ), the wife’s old flame who visits a lot, a beautiful young neighbor who also visits a lot and a very funny French housekeeper, Clemence , who can speak English but insists on speaking French throughout, sans peur et sans reproche, played with good comic effect by Susan Kovacs, a Blue Heron customer . The wife soon falls mysteriously ill and the play is off and running !\n\nStaged and directed by Sheila Cardano, whose daughter, Clelia Sheppard, is the Executive Director of Art’s Enter, the play came off wonderfully– the years of Sheila’s hard work and efforts to put together a talented local amateur theatre group and stage crew and to renovate the Palace Theatre have really paid off handsomely. The theatre, now fully restored, truly looks great. ( Years of fund raisers together with grants and donations have restored this lovely Art Deco building to its former 1940’s glory. Wow ! And you should see the seats now, comfy and beautifully re-covered, to the tune of hundreds of dollars each and the gorgeous golden wall murals. Before and after pictures really tell this amazing restoration story and illustrate how far the Palace Theatre and Art’s Enter have come in these last 15 years. ) On stage, the props and scenery looked great– so authentic, you felt like you really were in an artist’s home. Lots of well done lighting and sound effects too, especially the mistral wind, which blew on and off for much of Act 3.\n\nBest of all was the cast, who vividly brought this story to life. Consisting of nine amateur actors from various walks of life, including a recreational director, a vacation rental associate, three retirees, a real estate sales agent, a real estate broker, a Deputy Commissioner of the Revenue plus Clelia Sheppard, the Executive Director of Art’s Enter and one of the Eastern Shore’s great multi-taskers, this cast came together seamlessly to create the story’s realistic voice. It was an excellent performance, thoroughly enjoyed by the entire audience. I realize that I am biased but the three of us really loved seeing our two colleagues from the Blue Heron Realty Co. Cape Charles office , Eva Noonan and Dave Kabler ” do their thing” on-stage, both presented an accomplished performance, with Eva cast in the leading role of Sally Carroll. And so, to the entire cast, at the next performance go ahead and take an extra bow— you deserve it !"
