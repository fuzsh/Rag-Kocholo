Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck and Alexis Smith star in this thriller of an artist who can only find inspiration in murder and of the two women who inspire him, the two women he loves--The Two Mrs. Carrolls. When artist Geoffrey Carroll (Bogart) meets Sally Morton while on a fishing trip to Scotland, romance sparks between the pair. Back home, Geoffrey paints a portrait of his wife as the Angel of Death just before she dies mysteriously. But Geoffrey and Sally soon wed and live happily together for a time. Now, the local pharmacist is blackmailing Geoffrey; Geoffrey spends time with the much younger Cecily (Alexis Smith) while he paints Sally as the Angel of Death--and Sally's health mysteriously decays with each passing day.",

        "text": "The play kept experienced theatergoers on the edge of their seats. The picture will keep them on the edge of a nervous breakdown.\n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\nIt seems to run quite long for as simple of a story it is. Most of the plot is revealed in dialogue, and the suspense isn't as strong as it could be.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nBogart's final seconds onscreen are played for comedy; it's as if the movie itself is winking at us, to apologize for its Gothic-suspense absurdity, but also to get us to admit we enjoyed our time together.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
