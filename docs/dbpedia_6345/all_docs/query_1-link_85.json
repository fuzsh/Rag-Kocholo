        "text": "Once again we’re looking forward to play time at the historic Palace Theatre in Cape Charles, Virginia. ( See September, 2010 posts about Arts Enter’s first play of the 2010-2011 season, a mystery entitled The Two Mrs. Carrolls . ) This season’s second production by Art’s Enter is a long-time thespian favorite, The Importance Of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde. Interestingly, this clever farce, subtitled A Trivial Comedy For Serious People, was first performed about 1895 and has been kicking around ever since. It was even made into a movie about ten years ago, staring Rupert Everett, Judi Dench, Colin Firth and Tom Wilkenson, some of my favorite British actors, ( Dench especially for her role in the long running BBC series As Time Goes By and Wilkenson as Gerald in the hilariously poignant film, The Full Monty ). According to the Palace’s advance ad, George Bernard Shaw once said that Earnest was the funniest play ever written. It is indeed a very witty piece of writing, a romantic comedy full of clever turns of phrase. I find it pretty amazing that a play which is now 115 years old is still capturing the imaginations of theatre groups all around the country ( take a quick peek at some of the U Tube clips of recent productions of Earnest, especially the clips from South Coast Repertory. )\n\nSo we are planning for a late lunch today at Aqua’s Restaurant overlooking the Chesapeake Bay near the marina and then off to the theatre for the 3:00.pm matinee. I’m looking forward to the Cobb Salad at Aqua. Unbelievably, next Wednesday, as part of an over-all menu revision, I’ve been told they are taking their absolutely delicious Cobb Salad off the menu although it’s their most popular salad and, in my opinion, their best salad, assorted field greens layered with corn kernels, an entire sliced egg, crunchy bacon, perfectly ripened avocado, long crisp cucumber slices, tender grilled chicken, topped with a creamy Parmesan pepper dressing. I’m just asking……. What sense does it make to remove one of your most popular luncheon dishes just because it’s been there nearly since opening day ? Their hamburger has been on since opening day as well — but I’d just about bet the farm that the same hamburger choices are going to make an appearance on the new menu ! ( I think we need a revolt, maybe a “Committee for the Retention of the Cobb Salad at Aqua”. ) My daughter will be likely be having the fish sandwich and clam chowder, safe and secure that fish sandwiches will probably always be on the menu ! Anyway, we all truly enjoy Aqua’s atmosphere and scrumptious food and shall cling to the hope that maybe next spring the beloved Cobb Salad shall re-appear on their menu."
