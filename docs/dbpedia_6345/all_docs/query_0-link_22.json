        "text": "Noble suffering and triumph\n\nMargaret Sullavan is remembered for the work she did later at MGM, especially the romantic films she made with James Stewart. But she began her Hollywood career under contract at Universal. In the mid-1930s she appeared in several noteworthy pictures for Universal that merit attention.\n\nOne gem is LITTLE MAN WHAT NOW? (1934) which pairs her with two very different men– Douglass Montgomery and Alan Hale (Sr.). Talk about a contrast! The story focuses on a young couple struggling to survive, and it is a remake of a German melodrama from a year earlier which itself was based on a popular novel.\n\nUniversal executive Carl Laemmle would act as if he had conceived the idea for this production, when in reality he was just borrowing the template of what had been a hit in Germany. Laemmle and his team who endeavored to adapt the material don’t seem to Americanize it very much. But that doesn’t matter.\n\nWhat does matter– the stars at the center of the drama. Douglass Montgomery, who had played the object of Katharine Hepburn’s affections in RKO’s LITTLE WOMEN (1933), is an actor who’s always drawn me in with his performances. How come nobody ever cast him to play Romeo?\n\nI think it’s his unique combination of masculinity and femininity that he projects on camera. There is a soft quality in him that works when he has to play a vulnerable guy on the brink of failure.\n\nAlan Hale is the total opposite. Older and a “man’s man” all the way, he brings experience and assuredness to his part. He portrays a paternal benefactor who would like to cross the line with young bride Sullavan. But things remain platonic between them.\n\nHale’s character doesn’t have a huge amount of screen time. He usually appears when there is a turning point in the narrative, trying to help solve some of the couple’s problems which sometimes creates new problems. Adding a layer of complexity is Hale’s open relationship with Montgomery’s mother (the much underrated Catherine Doucet). She is basically running a brothel.\n\n\\\n\nAs for Sullavan herself, she brings every bit of noble suffering and triumph that she can possibly muster to the screen. We know things will eventually improve as long as she remains by her husband’s side. This includes periods when he is unemployed and they are barely scraping by. After she becomes pregnant, their situation is even more delicate.\n\nWatching the film I kept wondering what the title meant– but that all becomes clear in the last few shots. The little man is not the underachieving husband in a world of business giants. It is their newborn son who has a world of opportunity and life decisions ahead of him.\n\nTrials and tribulations of a henpecked husband\n\nRobert Siodmak had a significant career in Europe before coming to Hollywood in the early 1940s. The darker themes of his work make the stylish director stand out from others. He signed with Universal in 1943 where he was allowed to be creative and where his background in German expressionism influenced his output.\n\nAt first Siodmak directed some B horror entries, then he was handed important A-picture assignments. PHANTOM LADY was his first noir at Universal. It was a murder mystery which featured Ella Raines. Siodmak would direct Raines several more times, mostly notably in THE SUSPECT alongside Charles Laughton.\n\nLaughton was a close friend of the director’s, and under Siodmak, he gives a carefully understated yet poignant performance. He portrays a henpecked husband driven to murder his overbearing wife (Rosalind Ivan). Miss Raines plays a sweet young woman that Laughton befriends. She becomes a very necessary diversion, as well as a catalyst when Laughton decides to break free from his unhappy marriage.\n\nThe film is set in early 20th century London, and the period touches are expertly handled. Everything from costumes and hairstyles to set design seem authentic. The performances convey an understanding of how people acted at the time. The wife manipulates the local gossips to subject her husband to humiliation so he won’t stray.\n\nHenry Daniell plays a blackmailer. He figures out Laughton got rid of the nasty old battle axe, but silence comes at a price. Laughton tries to keep Daniell quiet, but the greedy parasite wants more money, and Laughton has no wish to keep paying him.\n\nSo Laughton kills again, and there’s a truly suspenseful scene when he doesn’t have enough time to dispose of Daniell’s body. Laughton hides it behind a sofa just as his son and the son’s girlfriend arrive home. While they are chatting, the girlfriend feels something under the sofa and puts her hand down there. It turns out a cat is playing with the dead body. But until she pulls the cat out from under the piece of furniture, we are led to believe, as Laughton does, that his crime is about to be discovered. It’s straight out of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nLaughton’s reactions are outstanding. The camera work keeps us unnerved and in as much suspense as possible. Of course our sympathetic antagonist will be found out before the end of the story. In the last sequence Laughton has married Raines, and they are going to Canada to start a new life. But the police have been nipping at Laughton’s heels.\n\nThere is a nice cat-and-mouse moment between Laughton and an investigator just as the ship is about to sail. There is no such thing as a perfect crime, but there is such a thing as a perfectly directed performance. I suspect that anyone who watches the film will find it just as enjoyable as an episode of Columbo.\n\nMulti-layered western\n\nI haven’t decided if this RKO western in Technicolor is unfairly overlooked or unfairly maligned. Maybe both. It’s certainly a unique western and as a production overseen by Howard Hughes, it has its share of interesting scenes. What I really like about the film, which others might deride, is that it is several western films rolled into one. This is not because Hughes and his directors (there were more than one) couldn’t decide what story to tell, but because there were quite a few stops and starts behind the scenes.\n\nEach time they resumed production on THE HALF-BREED, there was a new person in charge, taking the reigns under Hughes’ watchful eye. So in a way they keep remaking the story, with continuous retakes, something Hughes was famous for doing. And by the time they finally reached the end of a long production schedule, the editors had multiple versions to choose from for individual scenes. This actually works in the film’s favor.\n\nThe result is a multi-layered western drama about a group of white people in town (those scenes mostly shot at RKO’s ranch in Encino) and a group of indigenous people outside of town (with those scenes mostly shot on location in beautiful Arizona).\n\nPart of the narrative focuses on a traveling gambler (Robert Young) who’s just come into San Remo. But before doing so, he was nearly killed and had his life saved by a half-breed, the title character (played by Jack Buetel). Young is slightly miscast but still renders an excellent performance.\n\nBuetel had a memorable motion picture debut in Hughes’ THE OUTLAW, overshadowed by Jane Russell, but he remained under contract to Hughes for about a decade, though he didn’t make too many films. Here Buetel provides us with a very sensitive performance as a man who is half civilized and half savage, trying to decide which culture is best for him.\n\nIn addition to the culture clash and the ensuing friendship between these men, we have a love story. It involves Young falling for a saloon singer (Janis Carter in her last Hollywood movie), who is desperate to get on the next stage outta here so she can start a good clean life in a more respectable locale.\n\nHer exit is delayed more than once. First, her manager gambles away her money, which Young wins back for her. Then, there there is an uprising by the natives against several corrupt townsfolk trying to push them off their gold-rich land.\n\nIn my opinion, the film really hits its stride when the whites and the Apaches head into battle with each other; though, many of the whites and one native maiden are innocently caught in the crossfire. Young and Buetel try to broker a peace, with Buetel ultimately deciding to side with the Apaches.\n\nIt’s gripping entertainment. We also learn Young had been a confederate soldier in the war who drifted into gambling; so, he knows what it’s like to be in a war where there are losers.\n\nIt’s a shame this film is not better known. It contains some very competent performances. Because of the start-stop-restart nature of the production behind the scenes, we have a multi-layered western entertainment that can be read in a variety of ways.\n\nSinging-dancing orphan girl\n\nA child whose parents are dead. That’s the definition for the word orphan. But at 20th Century Fox in the 1930s, the definition was: sympathetic role for Shirley Temple. In fact, there was no other role suited for her, as a girl with indelible moppet charm that the audience could root for, because goodness, she just needed some parents and a home of her own. The prospective parents were usually not an established couple. They were often two young single adults (never middle aged) who fell in love during the story, to facilitate a romantic subplot.\n\nThe film starts with Shirley predictably in an orphanage, singing with other girls about the virtue of remaining optimistic. Yes, they can’t be too downtrodden, since a film with a sad vibe would not go over well with movie viewers. We are told up front that she’s not staying here; she’s going to live with an old friend of her deceased parents who’s agreed to look after her.\n\nShe’s happy, until she realizes the other girls are not being adopted. As if those emotions were not overpowering, we have the girls leaning out windows singing Auld Lang Syne as Shirley leaves the orphanage. Nothing is subtle!\n\nIn the next part Shirley settles in at a boarding house with the elderly gent (Edward Ellis) who’s taken her in along with his pretty daughter (Phyllis Brooks).\n\nIt’s a place where various theatrical types reside, most of them currently jobless. One of the tenants is a bandleader (Jimmy Durante) who hasn’t had a gig in twelve weeks. But he’s so busy playing poker, he doesn’t seem to care!\n\nMeanwhile there is a crotchety old lady (Edna May Oliver in a role that normally would’ve been assigned to Helen Westley) that lives in the next building. She is upset by all the noise the performers are making. Oliver disagrees with her brother (Donald Meek) that the riffraff in the boarding house need to go; and since she owns that building, too; and Shirley’s new friends owe Oliver back rent, she decides it’s time to evict them all!\n\nInto the mix we have the introduction of Oliver’s handsome young nephew (George Murphy). He befriends Shirley and just so happens to be fond of Brooks, much to his auntie’s dismay. The love story will complicate Oliver’s plans to toss Ellis and the others out on their keisters.\n\nMurphy shares the same opinion with Meek that Oliver shouldn’t throw anyone out on the street. While he devises a plan to thwart his aunt’s actions, we see him bond more with Shirley. There is a cute scene in which they do a few dance steps together. It leads to a number on top of a table. Only in the movies!\n\nShirley thinks Murphy is quite skilled and asks where he learned to dance. He explains he learned at Harvard as part of the Hasty Pudding Club. Shirley doesn’t realize that’s the name of a theatrical group and says ‘boy, I bet that tasted good!’\n\nOne of the reasons these cinematic vehicles worked so well for Shirley Temple is because she’s usually a wide-eyed innocent dealing with adult situations. Part of the fun is her overcoming a specific plight and teaching the adults a lesson or two. Her line deliveries are classic, such as a moment where she learns a butler lied about something and she brands him a fibber who should stand in the corner. Or when she tells Murphy that she would have been an old maid if she hadn’t met him. Not sure if these scenes would work so well with any other young child actress.\n\nOf course we know that Murphy and Brooks will end up together, and they will become Shirley’s proper parents. Also, Oliver will have a change of heart and reverse her thinking about evicting the performers. Oh, and certainly, there will be a big show before all is said and done (in this case, staged inside a courtroom!) to indicate the theatrical types are now back to work. There won’t be any problem that doesn’t get solved with the help of a singing-dancing orphan girl.\n\nTo Korea and back\n\nBATTLE HYMN, a Technicolor production directed by Douglas Sirk, is a look at the Korean War. By this point in his career, Sirk had become known for a series of lavish tearjerkers with producer Ross Hunter. Many of them featured Rock Hudson in the lead role. This time, the trio venture away from their usual formula to focus on a true life subject. The emphasis is on Colonel Dean Hess, an Air Force pilot and minister celebrated for his humanitarian efforts in Korea.\n\nHess was instrumental in the building of an orphanage in Korea, which occurred after he had already seen battle in WWII. In fact, he had been haunted by his earlier experiences, which caused him to return to the military and work in Korea. You see, Hess had accidentally bombed a German orphanage back in 1945, killing over thirty children, and he was unable to forget it. So when he re-enlisted and went to Korea, it became important to him to build a new orphanage there.\n\nHudson is believably cast in this real-life role. Certainly it’s a chance to stretch himself as an actor, taking on the story of a well-known hero who had notable demons to confront. Sometimes on screen, Hess’ personal life is messy. He has tried to atone for all he did wrong in WWII by turning to God; but that doesn’t fully absolve him of his guilt. In Korea, he will try to do something purposeful, so he can maybe get over his anguish.\n\nWhile Hess is in Korea, his wife (Martha Hyer) back home learns she is pregnant; so there is new life on the way. Hyer’s role is quite marginal in this picture. She was one of Universal’s dependable lead actresses, typically cast in melodramas and westerns. In this instance, her persona as a good spouse is used to good effect. However, she is absent from much of the action, especially the scenes that occur in Korea.\n\nIn Seoul, Hess is acquainted with a Korean woman (Anna Kashfi); and an intimate relationship is more than implied. At the same time he also befriends a black pilot (James Edwards). The military is at this point racially integrated.\n\nThere’s an interesting scene where Edwards’ character guns down a truck and learns that some children were victims. His situation reminds Hess of what had happened before in the last war.\n\nThis was one of my favorite parts of the film. It was brilliant the way we had this extra character in a subplot that mirrored Hess’ own pain. Then how they both share their grief, in a rather therapeutic way.\n\nInterestingly, despite the military being racially integrated and the relationships that Hess forms with the black pilot and the Korean gal, there are still scenes that depict racist or xenophobic attitudes which existed among U.S. military personnel. Americans may have been defending democracy on foreign soil, but they were not without prejudices. I supposed it would have felt false if Sirk had not included any of it.\n\nWhile Hess is atoning for past sins, there are battles that must be fought and won in South Korea. Fighting scenes in the film display good aerial footage. There are several key death scenes. One of these involves Kashfi’s character. Of course, the production code necessitates her demise.\n\nMostly, I found Kashfi’s character to be one of the more fictionalized elements of the film. Not sure if Hess really did have such a close relationship with a Korean woman, while he was away from his wife. But here, in this film, she is included to ramp up the drama. But of course she cannot be the one he chooses. He has to ultimately re-choose his wife and go back home for a happy ending. Thus, Kashfi’s role is expendable in a narrative of this sort, and the character must die.\n\nIn terms of box office, Kashfi was probably thrown into the mix so there would be someone sexy or exotic for men in the audience to ogle. But of course Hyer’s character represents the morally correct choice of a partner as sanctioned by the production code.\n\nOf course the main point of this story is the work Hess did to build the orphanage in Chejudo, South Korea. But when a Hollywood studio produces a movie for mass entertainment, usually the more reasonable aspects of the plot become secondary to the more sensationalized elements.\n\nTopBilled:\n\nAll children come from heaven, except juvenile delinquents\n\nInfluenced by Hollywood films from the same period, such as MGM’s BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, this British social message drama covers a lot of the same ground while putting its own spin on things. Set in and filmed in parts of Liverpool, the drama concerns a juvenile liaison officer (Stanley Baker) whose assignment is to patrol a busy neighborhood in plain clothes.\n\nAs part of his duties Baker associates with other members of the community determined to correct wayward youth. One of these folks is a priest, played by Peter Cushing who would soon make his mark in horror films. Here, Cushing is much less monstrous. Instead, the monster of the piece is a know-it-all teenager (David McCallum) who seems to have a weird power over the other boys his age. That is, until he starts to go too far and becomes an outright criminal.\n\nBaker first meets McCallum when he apprehends McCallum’s younger twin siblings stealing from a local store. Taking the youngsters home Baker learns there is no mother around— she’s moved to London and remarried. There is a father, but he’s away on an extended business trip. So the rearing of McCallum and the two younger kids becomes the responsibility of an older sister (Anne Heywood) who is an adult in her early 20s. She will become a romantic interest for Baker, naturally.\n\nThe set-up is clever, because not only is Baker patrolling the nearby streets where McCallum gets into trouble…but Baker becomes directly involved with the family through his relationship with Heywood. In a way, Baker takes on the role of the family’s surrogate patriarch; which of course, puts a crimp into McCallum’s plans to continue running wild.\n\nAlso, as part of the set-up for this story, there is a subplot involving an unknown arsonist. And that person turns out to be McCallum, which leads to a standoff later inside the twins’ school. In one of the classrooms, we see McCallum hold a bunch of children hostage at gunpoint then make some unrealistic demands of the police. Of course, Heywood needs Baker to give her troubled brother a break, but Baker has to operate according to the law, not according to his heart.\n\nI didn’t think the writers did a decent job explaining McCallum’s criminal behavior. He seems to be a monster for no good reason. Why did he start setting fires? What was the root cause of that behavior? We’re never really told this information.\n\nAlso, we’re not told why the mother left and never came back, or why McCallum would even have a twinge of guilt when he accidentally runs over a Chinese worker with a stolen van. Too many holes in the plot make us guess too much.\n\nAlso, I had a slight problem with the editing. It seems like Dearden and his editor are consciously trying to make this a “European art film” by adding in various jump cuts, so scenes never really dissolve or logically lead into subsequent scenes. Instead, we’re barely finished with a scene when suddenly we find ourselves plunged into the next scene almost in progress. I didn’t see the purpose for this. Maybe later, during the siege at the school, where the action would undoubtedly be more chaotic and disjointed. But not earlier in the picture when Baker was on his rounds.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nNever heard of this title before, perhaps because it is a rather antiquated social propaganda piece from another era that fell through the cracks. Basil Dearden directs this 1958 profile on juvenile unrest that, like other offspring of THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, considers rock and roll a questionable influence by the elder generation who favored lighter, jazzier material on their disc players. (Fittingly, our setting is Liverpool which was ground zero of the Beatles.) Obviously there are aspects to this for-that-time-sensitive drama that hasn’t aged well, despite its then thought provoking analysis of “root causes” and not merely punishing the criminal.\n\nStanley Baker plays Detective Sergeant Jack Truman (head of Juvenile Liaison), your typical hard hitting chain smoker with an eye for all pieces of evidence at the scene of each crime.\n\nHe is joined by fellow Detective Willie Walker (John Slater) and the local Chief Inspector (George A. Cooper). Laundry services that are operated by one of the rare Asians featured in fifties mainstream films, Michael Chow as Alexander (and Tsai Chin as his sister), are getting tormented by a teen gang headed by Johnny Murphy (David McCallum) and, later on, his van is stolen as a local business fire is started.\n\nJack is a bit judgmental at first of the rebellious youth but the local school superintendent (Moultrie Kelsall) explains to him that there are no actual juvenile “delinquents:” everybody is subject to reform. Our story goes in a rather unique direction as our lead becomes emotionally invested in Johnny’s sister Catherine (Anne Heywood), who is the practical one in the parentless household that also involves twin elementary school-ers learning a bit of petty theft, Patrick and Mary (Fergal Boland and his actual sister, I think, Brona).\n\nWith the accidental death of Alexander at the scene of Johnny’s latest crime (and I could get detailed here on how his profession is questionable as potential stereotyping, in addition to being referenced as “the Chinese boy” rather than his actual name but, on the plus side, he and his sister don’t speak broken English and are constantly grinning from ear to ear like so many of their counterparts in U.S. films of the same period), Jack sees similarities of this case to a past one he investigated with an arsonist named “Firefly.”\n\nA significant supporting role is Peter Cushing (more famous for his horror roles in Hammer Films) as the local priest who is also sympathetic to the community’s denizens and winds up as a savior of sorts confronting Johnny when he goes full throttle bonkers holding a classroom of students hostage in our dramatic climax.\n\nJustice must be served and Johnny ultimately gets arrested, a move that ends the romantic story arc between Jack and Cathy since he let her down with his promises earlier to be fair with her brother. I like the fact that our boy-meets-girl angle is not given the typical ending expected in so many of these Hollywood influenced dramas, showing that each of us must choose between what must be done in our profession and service to the community versus what we feel or desire personally.\n\nDespite the story’s interesting plot aspects, however, I must confess that I struggled getting all that emotionally invested in these characters. Yet this is a frequent problem I have with social conscious dramas that are heavy on the messaging to the expense of character development. Clearly David McCallum has the juiciest role as Johnny and his performance holds up rather well. Too bad there wasn’t more backstory on him regarding his motives, beyond all of that angst.\n\nHe abducts a classroom of students at gunpoint who are close in age to his own twin siblings and shoots a girl very much like Mary but the curious connection is only casually remarked upon. Is he that troubled in his anger management that he doesn’t care whom he harms? Perhaps, his choosing of the school as his hideout psychologically represents rage against The System that failed to prepare him for a jobless young adult life. Also why is the priest so impactful in getting him to calm down when others can’t? Details… details, I know…\n\nOn the plus side, the repeated bopper playing on discs throughout, “Play Rough” by Johnny (a different Johnny) Luck, is a fun highlight.\n\nClearly there is plenty of talent behind the camera and, speaking of the camera, Reginald H. Wyer and Reg Johnson display a nice in-the-streets excitement to the scenery. Fast forwarding a dozen or so years ahead, director Dearden died in a car accident at age 60 in1971, well ahead of his time and with a film career that was still going strong with a succession of critically acclaimed titles.\n\nRoger Moore was featured in his last title while also enjoyed popularity on TV’s The Persuaders! and shortly before taking on the 007 role. Along with producer Michael Relph who served as producer on many of his films, Dearden had a special talent for recognizing talent for the screen. One can only speculate what direction the seventies would have taken him in terms of subject matter and social commentary envelope pushing.\n\nRegional stereotypes and biases\n\nThe main problem I have with William Faulkner’s story, as well as this film adaptation by MGM’s Dore Schary, is that it is a white man’s response to the issue of racism in the south. First, racism is not a social ill confined only to the southern United States, and second, it is not something that can only be solved by white folks.\n\nThe fact that racism is still occurring over 70 years after INTRUDER IN THE DUST was made indicates that something keeps renewing it generation after generation. The whole thing goes deeper than this story would have us believe.\n\nThe tale fails to recognize the levels of racism and elitism that exist within white society as well as the issues of race and privilege within black society, since there are different skin tones and prejudices within these two larger groups. Making the main conflict white versus black or black against white is incredibly naive and way too simplistic a thesis than the overall subject deserves.\n\nIt does not consider different shadings and attitudes regarding racism in our country. Furthermore, setting the drama exclusively in the south plays into regional stereotypes about southern life. Of course, Mr. Faulkner was writing about a part of the country where he grew up. But he is still guilty of perpetuating the stereotypes of the region.\n\nHe gives us antiquated notions of what kids do, what sheriffs and lawyers do, what old unmarried women do, and what backwoods country folks do. None of the characters are fully fleshed out human beings.\n\nCertainly we’re supposed to like Claude Jarman’s adolescent character, since he starts to see beyond the color lines. This comes as a result of his strange friendship with the old black man, played by Juano Hernandez. Meanwhile, David Brian is on hand as an intelligent attorney and uncle to Jarman who’ll help try to save Hernandez from a lynching…though Brian still exhibits considerable narrow-minded viewpoints.\n\nThe story is predictable. Hernandez will be saved. The drama will not go so far as to make him suffer death or become a martyr, though it might have been a powerful indictment about social conditions if it had. Also, Hernandez has to be perfectly innocent. He is so wholesome that the writing won’t allow him to get cited for obstruction of justice, even though he refuses to tell the sheriff or lawyer who the real culprit is, and he definitely knows who the real culprit is.\n\nInstead, he is presented as unrealistically heroic and sympathetic at every turn, to the point his character becomes a bizarre set of liberal white cliches about how the ideal black man is supposed to be.\n\nThe killer in this type of story would never be a different black man. It has to be a white male killer. Therefore, the drama that unfolds is not about a falsely accused individual. It is about a falsely accused black man, due to a crime committed by a white man. There are no shades of gray or moral ambiguity on either side.\n\nI would’ve been much more impressed if the story had been crafted by a black writer or a black filmmaker (and there were some in the late 1940s) who was presenting their own ideas about race relations in America. Why do blacks need whites to tell their story and offer up solutions for them? It’s like the old master trying to control the narrative/destiny of the old slaves.\n\nMostly INTRUDER IN THE DUST is hokum drenched in regional stereotypes and biases, masquerading as progressive truth and so-called entertainment.\n\nSo help her God\n\nBased on William Faulkner’s novel Sanctuary, this Paramount precode goes out of its way to play up the more sordid aspects of the plot. Almost everyone is unsavory, except for maybe the town’s old judge (Guy Standing) and a young defense attorney (William Gargan) in love with the judge’s granddaughter. She’s known as Temple Drake (Miriam Hopkins).\n\nEarly scenes feature Temple as a spoiled southern girl who realizes she has a streak of evil in her, and that she’s the subject of local gossip. But she is unable to free herself from the naughtier side of her nature. As a result she turns down more than one marriage proposal from Gargan; and she leaves a formal dance to go off with a college guy (William Collier Jr.) for a ride in the country.\n\nDuring the ride they end up in an accident, get caught in a downpour, and then they’re taken to a haunted looking house where bootleggers hang out. The place is owned by a man (Irving Pichel) with a wife (Florence Eldridge) and young child. These are hardly likable or sympathetic people, including the wife, but she does try to keep Temple from harm when the college dude passes out and the other men start fighting over Temple.\n\nBut Temple is unable to sleep in the barn. For the main gangster (Jack La Rue) finds his way down there and kills a kid (James Eagles) who’s protecting her. Then in what is the film’s most famous and trashiest scene, he climbs in through a window and corners her among the corncobs where he forces himself on her.\n\nYes, scenes like this are what caused the Hollywood production code to be strongly enforced a short time later.\n\nThe next part of the film has Temple as a dazed prisoner of Trigger (LaRue), living in a city a hundred miles away as a ‘couple.’ The name Trigger turns out to be ironic, since he has a gun, and Temple uses it to kill him when she tries to get away from him. The story basically moves from one scandalous event to the next, culminating in a trial.\n\nAnd it is there, in a courtroom back in her hometown, that Temple takes the stand and confesses everything. Hopkins does a superb job, delivering a powerful monologue that goes like this:\n\n“I want to answer. I want to tell everything. I was there. A boy took me. Toddy Gowan. Our car got smashed. And it was raining. Then he went away and left me. Nobody would take me home. I got frightened. And that woman took me out to the barn. She said I’d be safe there. I couldn’t sleep. It was getting light when a man came in. Trigger, they called him. He came at me. Tommy heard us and looked in. Trigger shot him. I didn’t see Tommy anymore. And then, and then, he attacked me. Trigger did.”\n\nWhile the spectators inside the courtroom murmur, Temple continues to exorcise her demons: “I didn’t go home. I went to the city with Trigger and stayed there until this week…” She is asked where Trigger is now, where the court might find him. This is when she completely breaks down: “Can’t…never find him. I killed him.”\n\nShe suddenly collapses and is carried out. But she did it, she told the truth, nothing but the truth. So help her God, she did.\n\nExcellent Republic crime flick\n\nTelevision was dominating the entertainment landscape in the mid-1950s, but the big studios were still turning out notable motion pictures. This excellent crime flick from Republic is an example. Rod Cameron, who was typically cast in westerns, is assigned a change of pace role as a lawyer who helps solve a killing that implicates his wealthy boss (John Litel). There’s a romantic angle with Cameron in love with the man’s daughter, played by Allison Hayes.\n\nThough Cameron and Hayes are the main couple we’re meant to root for, they are somewhat upstaged by another couple directly responsible for the death that occurs on screen. This second couple is portrayed by sultry Gale Robbins and dapper Jack Kelly. Right from the start, we know they are trouble, especially when we watch Robbins smooching Kelly in a fancy convertible while her drunken middle-aged husband (Robert Armstrong) watches from the upstairs window of their apartment.\n\nRobbins traipses into the apartment and is quickly confronted by Armstrong about her extramarital activities. Their argument is overheard by a busybody landlady (Minerva Urecal). Robbins has had enough and packs a suitcase, planning to leave. But Armstrong convinces her to stay when he flashes some C notes in front of her greedy eyes. He’s just received a monthly installment from a man he’s blackmailing. That man? Litel.\n\nAlready, within the first few minutes we see how interconnected all these characters’ lives are; with several of them heading straight for disaster. Kelly’s character works at a car lot, but he’s not earning as much as he’d like; so he persuades Robbins to pressure Armstrong into asking Litel for even more money. Then she drives off with a new set of wheels, unpaid!\n\nIn the next part Armstrong is using the “stolen” vehicle to head up Mulholland Drive to meet Litel for ten grand. Only Litel won’t pay another dollar and leaves. Kelly has followed Armstrong to the top of the canyon; there’s a quarrel and Armstrong plunges off the side to his death, smashing up the car.\n\nThe plot thickens when Litel is incriminated because the other set of tire tracks along the cliff belonged to his Rolls. Litel is arrested, and this sets Cameron in motion playing amateur detective, since Hayes does not feel the police are doing enough to find the real killer (Kelly) which will clear her dad.\n\nThe ending is routine, but exciting. The best part of DOUBLE JEOPARDY is the opportunity it gives Armstrong & Litel, two gifted character actors, to shine in their roles as former associates connected by a past they’d rather forget.\n\nAt the same time, we have Kelly and Robbins heating up the screen; while Cameron and Hayes give us a more subdued mature type of love story. All the elements gel, and without a doubt, these fine performances, with plenty of on-location filming in and around Los Angeles, make this one of Republic’s best programmers from the mid-50s."
