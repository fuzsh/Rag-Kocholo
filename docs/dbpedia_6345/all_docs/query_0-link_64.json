        "text": "This article aruges for a new periodization of film noir through seven films released between 1940 and 1942 called here \"emergent noir,\" and including The Grapes of Wrath, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca and Citizen Kane. These seven films defined the genre’s aesthetics, thematics, visual style, and moral ambiguity. Emergent noir created a new mode of rebellious individual masculinity -- noir cool, a public mask of stylish stoicism – through Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, Alan Ladd, and (later) Sterling Hayden. The crucible of this new figure was his masking of emotion -- his cool. To be cool suggested self-control to the point of detachment, and signified an insolent defiance as registered in facial expression and body language. The masking of emotion communicates an inner intensity critical to the self-presentation and a sense of inner suffering. Paramount Studios attempted to float a new term for rising star Alan Ladd in 1942: \"the romantic heavy.\" At the time, the \"heavy\" meant the villain and the romantic lead was always the hero -- so this is an oxymoron – but it might be translated as the heroic badass. The romantic heavy was a rogue figure we now call cool, even if no one used the term at the time. The case studies here are of High Sierra and This Gun's For Hire."
