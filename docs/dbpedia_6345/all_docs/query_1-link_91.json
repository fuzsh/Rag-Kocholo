        "text": "FIFTY years ago this month, the movie ''All About Eve,'' starring Bette Davis as Margo Channing -- a quintessential actress, both celebrated and temperamental -- opened at the Roxy in New York and became an instant classic. The film won six Academy Awards, including two for Joseph L. Mankiewicz, as screenwriter and director (the same prizes he had won the previous year for ''A Letter to Three Wives'').\n\n''All About Eve'' stands as an acerbic satire on ambition and the egocentricity of those who dominate show business. It is also a salute to the indomitability of actresses like Bette Davis (and Margo Channing); to an ensemble cast, and to the wit and sophistication of Mankiewicz.\n\nIn a newly restored 50th-anniversary print, the movie will be shown for one week, starting Friday at Film Forum in Manhattan.\n\nThe story behind ''All About Eve'' has been told often -- in books that include my 1971 biography of Darryl F. Zanuck, ''Don't Say Yes Until I Finish Talking,'' ''More All About Eve'' (1972), which Mankiewicz wrote in collaboration with Gary Carey, and ''All About 'All About Eve','' by Sam Staggs, which was published earlier this year. Next in line may be ''More Than You Want to Know About 'All About Eve.' ''\n\nIn the movie, Margo finds her life invaded by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a worshipful fan whose ingenuousness barely conceals her own deep ambition. Eve wants to be Margo, and with the help of the cynical theater critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) she will do anything to reach her goal. At a party, Margo finally confronts the challenge. ''Fasten your seat belts,'' she warns her guests. ''It's going to be a bumpy night.'' This is just one of the film's famous lines from a script filled with imperishable dialogue.\n\nHaving talked over the years to Mankiewicz, Davis and Zanuck, who produced it, I'm convinced that the making of the film was not ''a bumpy night,'' although there were twists and turns, a natural result of Hollywood during the days of the old studio system and of the sizeable personalities involved.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
