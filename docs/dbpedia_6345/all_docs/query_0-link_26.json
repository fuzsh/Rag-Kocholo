        "text": "@ToTheRight, one of the delights of getting into \"classic era\" films has been my discovery of Bogart. Of course, I knew of him, but I wasn't really knowledgeable about the full scope of his work (*). Upon viewing, yeah, he more than lives up to his legendary status. Barbara Stanwyck is another, for whom my eyes have really been opened. WOW!\n\nI've stated this on and off over the past few years, but I'm constantly surprised by the relevancy of many older films. And perhaps, none more than BLACK LEGION (1937), which tells the story of how a 'normal' guy gives into hate and bigotry when he experiences setbacks in his life. It is powerful stuff and Bogart really sells it.\n\nI posted this on the film noir thread, but hopefully additional people will see it here.\n\nHow Humphrey Bogart Became a Star\n\nAs for ranking his films, I'll defer to wiser heads, but in addition to those already listed, I really love THE AFRICAN QUEEN (for which he won is only Oscar IIRC) and DEADLINE: USA.\n\n* And in truth, I still need to watch many of his early films."
