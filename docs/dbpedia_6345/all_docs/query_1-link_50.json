        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Philip Yordan\n\nBased on the book by Budd Schulberg\n\nDirector: Mark Robson\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling, Mike Lane\n\nCinematography: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: Hugo Friedhofer\n\nStudio: Columbia Pictures\n\nRelease: May 9, 1956\n\nAwards: Guffey was nominated for Best Cinematography (also nominated was “The Bad Seed”), but lost to “Somebody Up There Likes Me.”\n\nThe fact that “The Harder They Fall” is Humphrey Bogart’s final work gives the movie added weight and significance, even though it was obviously never meant to be his curtain call. Suddenly everything about his character and performance has meaning not just within the confines of the film itself, but in the entirety of his career. Luckily, the filmmakers and Bogart serve the performer well – this is not a masterpiece, but it’s a solid send off for perhaps the most iconic actor in the history of the medium.\n\nHe stars as Eddie, a recently laid-off sports writer who takes a job as the promotion guy for a recently-immigrated heavyweight wrestler named Toro (Mike Lane). Eddie must work under Toro’s manager Nick (Rod Steiger), a nasty, corrupt man who uses Toro’s looks for promotion (he’s a giant) and fixes every one of his matches to make him seem like a great fighter even though he has a glass jaw. Eddie is okay with this at first because, bluntly, he wants the money. But as the season continues and Eddie watches Nick makes decisions which are more and more horrifying, he begins to rethink his life choices.\n\nThe screenplay by Philip Yordan (“The Chase”) is predictable. As soon as the premise and characters are introduced, any semi-smart viewer will be able to tell you beat for beat how things are going to go down. But that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing if the scenes are well-written and the characters pop. And, in those respects, Yordan for the most part succeeds at crafting an engaging ensemble and playing them off one another quite well. There’s something beautiful to the first conversation that Eddie and Toro have. Toro doesn’t speak English well, but after the introduction simply states that Eddie is now his friend… and that is that. Such a straightforward moment, but it casts a long shadow over the rest of the film, and makes Eddie’s choices late in the third act all the more resonant.\n\nYordan does struggle specifically with Eddie’s wife Beth, whose character seems unable to escape all the cliches surrounding her “type.” She supports Eddie until she worries about him. She tells him when he’s lost his path. She looks pained as she listens to him speak. And then, at the end, she stares at him with love at his ethical triumph over the bad guys. Jan Sterling plays Beth – she’s an excellent actor when given anything meaty, so it’s a shame to see her struggle throughout to bring anything interesting to the two-dimensional heroine.\n\nThe rest of the cast is filled with character actors, many of whom are excellent. Lane has an amazing presence and functions well as the soul of the movie before Eddie comes around and reclaims his own. The various minions and heavies are given good enough dialogue that they feel a little different and fresh. The odd man out is Steiger, who decides to play his character to the rafters. It gets to be a little much, especially because Steiger chooses to do that open-mouth chewing schtick (here with steak) he famously (or infamously) did with gum from “In the Heat of the Night,” which pulls you directly out of the film and completely grosses you out of the film.\n\nSteiger’s big performance is a marked contrast to Bogart, who goes subtle. It gives their scenes together an uneven quality… they don’t play well off one another and it unfortunately shows at times. Aside from these moments, Bogart is excellent throughout – observing more than he is speaking, which works wonders for the character. The sad specter of the actor’s cancer makes the viewer stare at him onscreen, looking for moments and bits where his illness affects what we are seeing. Luckily, aside from a few moments where Eddie is oddly seated in scenes where you expect his character to be standing, there is no trace of that.\n\nThe director is Mark Robson, who crafted several of the best films from Val Lewton’s horror oeuvre in the ‘40s, include Lewton’s only noir “The Seventh Victim.” Aside from the Steiger/Bogart scenes, he has a good handle on the actors, and visually creates a great balance between the location scenes and the more atmospheric, noir-tinged interiors. He collaborates beautifully with all-time great noir cinematographer Burnett Guffey (“In a Lonely Place”), especially in the boxing scenes, which are stylistic knockouts (sorry, I couldn’t help myself), and are obviously the reason he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography. The long shots with matte paintings of the crowds are a great counter to the intimate shots of the boxers’ injuries in the ring – the camera unflinchingly staring at the bulging, bloody eye or the broken chin.\n\nThough “The Harder They Fall” isn’t as good as many movies in Bogart’s storied filmography, it’s still a solid entry. It’s also a nice comfort food… its predictability won’t hurt as much on repeated viewings. And as for Bogart himself? He helped define the noir genre and changed the ideal of what a tough guy could be. Excuse the following cliches, but sometimes you need them: He is the man. A myth. A legend. And the film world was changed for the better because he was in it.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Joseph Hayes and Jay Dratler\n\nBased on the novel and play by Joseph Hayes\n\nDirector: William Wyler\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Frederic March, Martha Scott\n\nCinematography: Lee Garmes\n\nMusic: Gail Kubik\n\nStudio: Paramount\n\nRelease: October 5, 1955\n\nTranslating a stage play to screen can be a tricky thing to accomplish successfully. The immediate desire by any screenwriter or director is to figure out a way to open the world up by adding a bunch of characters, moving the action outside as much as possible and adding in sequences which take the ensemble away from their homes. This can work to the film’s advantage, especially if it’s a comedy. But certain thriller plays thrive because of the claustrophobia created by the stage… the lack of escape adds immensely to the tension. Opening that world up breaks that. It allows the viewer to breathe, which is the exact thing you don’t want them to be doing.\n\nIn possibly related news, we’re talking about “The Desperate Hours” this week.\n\nFrederic March stars as Daniel, the husband and father of the Hilliard family. He has a loving wife in Ellie (Martha Scott), a 20-ish daughter in Cindy (Mary Murphy) and an annoying brat of a boy named Ralphy (Richard Eyer). Into their idyllic suburban lives storms a trio of escaped convicts: man with a plan Glenn (Humphrey Bogart), his younger brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and blunt object Simon (Robert Middleton). They take the family hostage, with plans to stay there for a few hours until Glenn’s girlfriend drives to them from several states away and brings them enough money for a proper getaway. Things get more complicated when the girlfriend is arrested by the police, and suddenly “a few hours” turn into a neverending horror.\n\nThis is a good film, a little B-picture that has been transformed into a major studio project thanks to the auspices of its cast and crew. I am not sure why director William Wyler (“The Letter”) decided that he had to make this little movie between his big-budget, big-Academy Award plays “Roman Holiday” and “Friendly Persuasion,” but I’m certainly not complaining. He brings a sure hand to the material, turns the Hilliard home into a place of nightmares and gets good performances from a majority of the cast. Most notably, he knows not to overdo it with suspenseful underscore – especially in the third act, he uses silence to great effect for ratcheting up the suspense.\n\nBogart is very good in what could have been a throwaway role, bringing layers and specific human ticks to the character without ever losing the sense of danger. There’s a moment where he is saying goodbye to his brother for what will turn out to be the last time which is surprisingly emotional considering the viewer is rooting for both of them to die.\n\nDaniel’s character was famously supposed to have been played by Spencer Tracy until he learned he would not be first-billed above Bogart and dropped out, with March replacing him last minute. And, make no mistake, March is quite good, but the role was obviously not rewritten when he was cast and feels like a Tracy role… I wish they had slightly altered things to play more to March’s strengths. The rest of the cast, many of whom I must admit I am not familiar with, are wholly excellent at turning sometimes stock characters into living breathing people. Murphy in particular isn’t given much of anything interesting to do except be strong, panic a little bit and support her husband, but she makes every moment onscreen count.\n\nThe film clocks in at almost two hours, and it would have been much better served at 90 minutes or less. With all the extra space, the suspense lags – particularly in the second act. The screenplay by Joseph Hayes (who wrote the book and play upon which this is based) and Jay Dratler (“The Dark Corner”) makes some baffling decisions concerning the tension. For example, if there was one scene where the hostage-takers allowed a family member to leave the house to get gas for their getaway car, or something, that could be a great way to play up suspense – knowing that escape is so close and so is the police station… but also knowing that your family will be killed if you do either of those things. But so many family members leave and come back that there might as well have been a revolving door on the front of the house. Think I’m exaggerating? The Cindy character goes on three (3!!!) dates while her family is being held hostage. I’m surprised Bogie didn’t send someone out for milk at one point.\n\nThere’s also that old chestnut in hostage movies where everyone and their brother suddenly shows up at the door with something really important to discuss. I consider myself a popular person (thank you!), but I can still go weeks without someone coming unannounced to my door just to chit chat. And I live in an apartment building!\n\nThe real problem is this odd 15-minute sequence where a garbage man named George (Walter Baldwin) shows up, then Simon hitches a ride on his truck as he drives away, takes him hostage and then guns him down for no real reason. It takes you away from the family’s plight, is about this rando we just met and serves only to spin the plot wheels. Why was it there? Well, remember my opening paragraph about filmmakers wanting to open the experience up by adding in a bunch of outdoor stuff and new cast members? There you go. I haven’t seen the play upon which this is based, but I would bet (a small amount of) money that Mr. Garbage Man is not in it. The result is the worst part of the movie by far.\n\nThough these problems are large, “The Desperate Hours” is still worth your time and energy. I’ve seen a lot of hostage thrillers at this point, and this is one of the better ones. But enter with measured expectations.\n\nScore: ***\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Thomas Job\n\nBased on the play by Martin Vale\n\nDirector: Peter Godfrey\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Ann Carter, Nigel Bruce\n\nCinematography: J. Peverell Marley\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 4, 1947\n\n“The Two Mrs. Carrolls” is unusual in how terrible it is.\n\nUsually when I don’t like a movie, I can pinpoint a few parts of the production which caused the awfulness. But this is one of… perhaps the only?… time during this entire Odyssey when I have seen so many otherwise-competent filmmakers collectively shit the bed.\n\nThe plot concerns a tortured artist named Geoffrey (Humphrey Bogart) who, while vacationing in Scotland, falls head over heels for Sally (Barbara Stanwyck). The only problem is that he’s already got a wife and daughter Beatrice (Ann Carter) at home. So he buys poison from a local chemist (Barry Bernard) under an assumed named and kills his wife by administering the poison in her milk. Then he marries Sally, moves into her idyllic English country estate… and begins lusting after family-friend-twice-removed Cecily (Alexis Smith). And thus the cycle begins again. But will Sally figure it out in time to stop another murder from taking place… her own?\n\nIf you are reading that and thinking that it sounds eerily similar to noir films “Gaslight” and “Suspicion,” you would be correct. This is a blatant rip-off, but without the technical prowess of “Suspicion” or the emotional trauma of “Gaslight.” There’s even a motherfucking glass of poisoned milk delivered by the husband! I’m surprised it wasn’t glowing.\n\nScreenwriter Thomas Job (“Escape in the Desert”) assumes the viewer is a fool and that he has to repeat every pertinent bit of information to the plot at least three times in order for us to pick up on things. This includes small stuff, like when Geoffrey buys the poison from the chemist and uses a fake name. The Chemist repeats the fake name “Fleming” three times, each more intensely than the last… and the third is after Geoffrey leaves as he repeats the name while stroking his chin, suspicious of the name for literally no understandable reason except to make sure the audience understands that this story development will come back later.\n\nThen there are the big things, like the explanation of what Geoffrey is doing. It’s not enough that we see what he’s up to. No, we need recaps every few minutes during the second half. First Sally has a ten-minute conversation (not hyperbole) with Beatrice where the little girl handily explains everything her father was doing to his first wife and how that is being repeated now while Sally cringes in terror. But then, a few moments later, we get a scene where Sally is alone in her bedroom, haunted by voiceover of what we just heard while cringing and connecting the dots for us. But then, at the climax, Geoffrey stops just short of killing Sally and instead re-explains for four minutes (again, not hyperbole) what he is doing and why he is doing it.\n\nPlay a drinking game if you watch the film – every time information is repeated three times in dialogue, take a shot. You’ll be blacked out by the end of the third reel.\n\nThat said, to be clear, you shouldn’t watch the film.\n\nBogart and Stanwyck are grossly miscast in the lead roles, both hamming it up to a shocking extent, complete with hair-pulling, grabbing their foreheads as they struggle with something mentally and screaming for no apparent reason. It’s kind of baffling how they were both roped into such a stinker and honestly look embarrassed in certain scenes. There’s a coda where the filmmakers turn the entire proceedings into a joke (because of course they do) where Geoffrey asks the police arresting him if they want some milk, and you can all but see Bogart cringing onscreen trying to deliver the line. Smith is given nothing to do but slink around with obvious mustache twirling… why was she even cast in such a throwaway role? Carter is unfortunate playing the unfortunate clam of the little who speaks like an adult, and Nigel Bruce is also on hand to do a mustachioed version of his bumbling Doctor Watson… obviously cast because he was also in “Suspicion.”\n\nThe director is Peter Godfrey, who made the almost-good “Cry Wolf” and the almost-terrible “Woman in White.” Was he napping for the entire shoot? Or was he the guy encouraging Bogart and Stanwyck to overact? Whatever the case – how dare you, sir! His cinematographer is J. Peverell Marley, who is a good cinematographer elsewhere in movies like “Whiplash” and “Hound of the Baskervilles.” But here? Even a thunderstorm looks boring under his lens. In the entire (much too long) 100 minute running time, there is only one memorable shot – when Geoffrey breaks through the window into Sally’s room at the climax, but even that is undercut by having Geoffrey immediately start to monologue after.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the set-design is also terrible. Sally is supposed to be well off, not rich (as underlined three times in the screenplay), but we get essentially a castle for her and Geoffrey to live in… way overdesigned to the point where it’s funny. You can tell great care was taken at crafting it – all for naught. Hell, it doesn’t even shoot well, so maybe it wasn’t all Marley’s fault.\n\nDear reader, there were many, many moments where I considered turning off “The Two Mrs. Carrolls” because of its ineptitude. The only reason I made it through is to write this article. But you? You don’t have to put up with this torture. Run far, run fast… just run.\n\nScore: ½*\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: John Monks Jr. and Daniel Taradash\n\nBase on the novel by Willard Motley\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, John Derek, George Macready\n\nCinematography: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: George Antheil\n\nStudio: Columbia\n\nRelease: February 22, 1949\n\n“Knock on Any Door” is a messy movie, but in some ways, it draws power from the mess. At the end of the film, there is a monologue from a character which is meant to neatly tie together all the disparate strands and themes set up earlier… but all it ultimately does is add to the anarchy. It might not be a successful work, but it is a powerful one.\n\nHumphrey Bogart stars as Andrew, who comes from a slum in a nameless Metropolis but has pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become a big-time lawyer. He takes on the defense of accused murderer Nick (John Derek) after the fatal shooting of a police officer. As the case begins in court, we flash back to learn how Nick fell so far into illegality so quickly, and the several times his life and Andrew’s bounced off of one another in the past. We learn about the death of Nick’s father in prison, his first few robberies, his attempt to go straight by marrying a good woman named Emma (Allene Roberts), and her subsequent suicide when he spurned her because she told him she was pregnant. But the question remains – though Nick is a terrible person, is he a murderer?\n\nBogart produced the film and is the actor above the title, but this is another instance – like “The Enforcer,” which I covered last week – where he really isn’t in the movie as much as you expect or want him to be. Andrew is a great, three-dimensional character, and Bogart nails his early scenes, especially where he is visiting his old haunts in the slum looking for information about Nick. But then he all but disappears until his big courtroom scene at the end, a supporting performer in his own movie. On the one hand, it feels like a very generous move to hand over so much of the movie to Nick – this was Derek’s first major role – but on the other hand, Andrew is a better, more interesting character and I would prefer to spend time with him.\n\nI want to cover the big twist early and the consequences, because they inform everything that happens before. The reveal that Nick really is the killer was legitimately stunning and beautifully rendered by screenwriters John Monks Jr. (“The House on 92nd Street”) & Daniel Taradash (“Storm Center”) and directed by Nicholas Ray (who would collaborate again with Bogart on the iconic “In a Lonely Place”). We needed that twist to set up the big summation Andrew makes at the sentencing hearing, where the filmmakers make clear that, thematically, we should blame society as much as, if not more than, Nick for his heinous actions because we have allowed millions of people like him to fall through the cracks of our country.\n\nIt’s a big, bold move by the filmmakers, and Bogart gives the speech a fiery passion that is completely genuine. That said, the movie doesn’t do a great job in making us feel like this is the correct point of view… in fact, considering the substantive flashbacks showing us just how much of an asshole Nick is, it’s very easy to think “Gee, they are totally wrong – this kid is just a straight-up psycho” while listening to Andrew talk. The flashbacks start well enough at making Nick into a three-dimensional character, and the filmmakers go to lengths to showcase how many of his bad decisions were understandable considering the circumstances.\n\nBut then there are the others.\n\nWhile I certainly appreciated that the movie does not make Nick into a saintly deity, many of his actions made me lose sympathy quickly. His quick temper when anyone says anything to him that could even be considered remotely negative is a motif repeated three times too often. But the real problematic stuff is the Emma section, specifically how he mistreats her and essentially dares her to commit suicide. Any ounce of sympathy I had for him disappeared the moment this happened, and the film never comes close to recovering from it.\n\nThat said, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Up until Andrew’s speech, I kind of loved how purposely messy the filmmakers were being with the narrative. Were we supposed to hate Nick? And, if so, how were we supposed to feel about the murder charges? Had that big summation not happened, the movie would have been stronger. But Andrew’s character is so certain of his convictions, and the filmmakers so ready to underline them as the truth in that sequence, that all you do is step back and say “whoa, are you watching the same movie as I am?”\n\nDerek is quite good as an incredibly difficult character – it obviously helped to make him a big star and I can see why. Macready is also great as the prosecuting attorney with an odd, unexplained scar on his cheek. Unfortunately, the female cast is let down by both their director and the screenwriters. Emma is a two-dimensional angel. Poor, poor Candy Toxton gets literally nothing interesting to do even though her character is the spark that involves Andrew in Nick’s life, which is a shame because you can tell the actress has great chemistry with Bogart.\n\nThis is Ray’s second film, and he seems to be having trouble keeping control of all his storytelling impulses – something he would perfect for the later noir classics “On Dangerous Ground” and the aforementioned “In a Lonely Place.” That said, even when he misses his target, he’s still an interesting filmmaker whose point of view is powerful because of what he chooses to attempt.\n\nI’m on the fence about recommending “Knock on Any Door.” I’m going to remember it, but I also kind of wish I didn’t see it, if that makes sense? If you’re a Bogart fan, you’ll come away wanting. If you’re a Ray fan, you’ll more than likely feel it was worthwhile. I guess what I’m trying to say is… buyer beware.\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Martin Rackin\n\nDirector: Bretaigne Windust, with uncredited contributions from Raoul Walsh\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Ted de Corsia, Michael Tolan\n\nCinematography: Robert Burks\n\nMusic: David Buttolph\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: January 25, 1951\n\nOn the surface, “The Enforcer” just seems like your normal dime-a-dozen police procedural, the more you dig into it, the more you discover that it’s a film willing to make some interesting structural moves. We get a gangbusters fifteen minute prologue before the plot really kicks in, and after that we embrace a structure of flashbacks within flashbacks. It doesn’t all work, but the movie deserves credit for what it attempts.\n\nHumphrey Bogart stars as Assistant District Attorney Martin, whose nervous witness Joe (Ted de Corsia) is meant to testify in court the next day to bring down infamous crime lord Albert Mendoza. Because we don’t know the shape of the film, these first fifteen minutes are incredibly suspenseful – does screenwriter Martin Rackin intend to have the story spine be Martin protecting Joe? Then the attempts on Joe’s life start, with a sharpshooter from the building across the street trying to take him down with a well-placed shot. All this stress makes Joe even more paranoid, and he ultimately tries to escape through a bathroom window on a high floor, falling to his death in the process.\n\nThis sequence is by far the best in the film… breathless and unexpected in all the right ways. Martin appears to be punching water – Joe keeps saying he won’t testify, then the assassination attempts, then Joe’s own escape attempts. It’s a beautiful, tense build and great filmmaking.\n\nSoon the actual shape of the narrative presents itself. Martin and a police officer named Nelson (Roy Roberts) only have seven hours until court the next morning when Mendoza’s lawyers will ask for a dismissal. Desperate, they go through the files for the case from the start, and we enter flashbacks of their investigation. These flashbacks have further flashbacks within them, when witnesses relate their stories to the officers. This idea is quite fun (I loved a similar take on it in the excellent noir “The Locket”), and the structure works very well… until it doesn’t.\n\nAt a certain point, probably just past the midpoint, I was getting bored getting introduced to new character after new character in the flashbacks… wishing instead that the filmmakers would just stick to the ensemble we know and have already imprinted on. It’s not that these later sequences are bad – they just sag the tension when you want things to get more suspenseful. The filmmakers also make the baffling choice to truncate the ending: the entire point of the movie is to find a witness who can implicate Mendoza in court. But the movie fades to black with the discovery of the witness – we don’t see her agree to testify, nor do we get to see the moment she takes down Mendoza from the stand. Both of those omissions feel like major missed opportunities.\n\nI’m kind of shocked Bogart is in the movie… not because he isn’t good in the role, but because it’s a throwaway lead role that any B-or-C lister could have done. Make no mistake, he elevates the material and character thanks to his presence, but Martin never comes close to having more than two dimensions.\n\nThe screenplay doesn’t help matters by keeping the character out of major points in the narrative… Martin keeps missing big important moments. In the opening sequence, Martin is watching over Joe but it’s a different cop who gets beaten up so Joe can escape, with the character only entering the moment at the end when he tries to save Joe from falling. Later there is an intense, big action set-piece where a potential witness is chased down… not by Martin but by Nelson. In fact, the more that I think about it, the more I am realizing that Bogart really isn’t in the movie all that much. Was he only able to be on set for a week of shooting or something?\n\nThe rest of the cast are all fine with a few standouts. Notably, Michael Tolan (who reminds me a lot of Adam Driver) makes a great impression in a relatively small role as a heavy who is forced to kill the woman he loves and, brokenhearted, commits suicide in prison. The movie seems to go out of its way for the first three-quarters to avoid showing us Mendoza’s face, so much so that I began expecting him to be some sort of uncredited stunt casting (Sydney Greenstreet? Peter Lorre?). But no, it’s just good ‘ole Everett Sloane, who does well enough at seeming creepy in his few scenes.\n\nThe director is Bretaigne Windust, who never made another noir film but did direct the fabulous romantic comedy “June Bride.” He acquits himself well to the genre. I must mention that Windust became very ill during filming, resulting in Raoul Walsh (“They Drive By Night”) stepping in briefly to replace him. Of course, many articles credit the more well-known Walsh for everything good in the movie (“he directed almost all the suspense scenes” says one article without citing a single source), which seems a little crazy since Walsh himself insisted that Windust is the sole author of the film. Cinematographer Robert Burks (“The Wrong Man” and several other Hitchcock films) does an excellent job of making the flashbacks feel just a bit different than the present-day sequences, but not enough to ruin the reality of the world.\n\nIf you’re sick of regular police procedurals that offer up no interesting characters and no twists on the genre, “The Enforcer” is a nice tonic for that. It doesn’t quite get there considering all its potential, but is still worth the watch.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter/Director: Richard Brooks\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Ethel Barrymore, Kim Hunter\n\nCinematography: Milton R. Krasner\n\nMusic: Cyril J. Mockridge\n\nStudio: 20th Century Fox\n\nRelease: March 14, 1952\n\nIn another life, I was a journalist. This despite my regular breaking of the rules of grammar for emphasis, overuse of adverbs and tendency to use colorful language on this Odyssey. Because of my former career, I unsurprisingly have a major soft-spot for any newspaper movie. And “Deadline – U.S.A.”, despite having that heinous title, is a great one.\n\nHumphrey Bogart stars as Ed, the managing editor of a major metropolitan daily newspaper called “The Day.” It’s in the process of being sold off to a bigger company, which plans to erase it from existence – less competition for their papers, you see. Ed’s surrogate mother and publisher Margaret (Ethel Barrymore) is attempting to halt the sale, but her two daughters hold the majority votes. This isn’t Ed’s only stress – he’s still desperately in love with his ex-wife Nora (Kim Hunter), who is about to get re-married to another man. Also one of his reporters is savagely beaten when he tries to investigate local mobster Tomas Rienzi (Martin Gabel), and Ed wants to get justice. Do local stories of a woman found naked in the river except for a mink coat have something to do with him? All signs point to yes.\n\nDespite the crime subplot being the lynchpin that drives the narrative forward, the movie isn’t much interested in that. It’s much more concerned with serving as a soapbox to showcase the importance of good journalism and righteous storytelling, something as important then as it is today. Ed has a bunch of speeches, and one barnburner of an extended monologue, about this subject, and his words feel timeless in a beautiful way.\n\nThe screenwriter and director is Richard Brooks, who is one of those all-timer filmmakers who has classics in just about every single genre. His Truman Capote adaptation “In Cold Blood” is one of the best noir films ever made, and one I promise to get to this year. This was one of his early works… only his third film… and it’s kind of astonishing to see his voice so fully formed this early. The screenplay feels like something a seasoned pro would write, and visually he knows exactly when to pull his punches. There’s also an authenticity to the newspaper-speak which is much appreciated – his ensemble sounds like they’ve been in a bullpen for decades, which is how it should be.\n\nEven though the movie doesn’t have much interest in the crime stuff, that doesn’t mean it isn’t well executed. Brooks’ screenplay does a good job of planting all the seeds it needs to pay off in ways that feel both fateful and surprising. When an old woman who has just lost her daughter speaks about the newspaper’s treatment of the story late in the film, you have to appreciate how the film has managed to perfectly dovetail the two storylines thematically. Plus, there’s a great blast of violence which takes place above (and in) a printing press which you’re not going to forget anytime soon.\n\nThe bittersweet finale is also appreciated. In her final conversation with Ed, Margaret tells him that any battle is worthy because, even if you lose, it brings up important things that needed to come to light. An easy ending would have allowed The Day to be saved… for the judge to be wavered by Ed’s awesome speech and give in on the matter. But the filmmakers understand reality. Ed loses the war and loses his paper, but wins his battle with Tomas – the guy has been implicated on a level where the law will no longer be able to turn a blind eye toward him.\n\nBogart is perfect for Ed, seeming exhausted in just about every scene from burning the candle at both ends but unwilling to stop on anyone’s account… even his own. He is exceedingly strong when he puts up a wall against other characters, but even better when he allows his vulnerability to show with his ex-wife. Hunter is very well cast in what could have been a write-off of a role, doing the extra work to create a genuine connection with her ex, and keeping the audience invested in their relationship even when the screenplay forgets about her for long periods of time. The rest of the ensemble of newspaper men, which include Ed Begley, Warren Stevens and Joyce MacKenzie, are perfectly cast and feel like they haven’t slept a full night in several years.\n\nCinematographer Milton Krasner (“A Double Life”) does a grand job of illuminating the bullpen and adjoining offices, which were shot in an actual newspaper building, giving it both scope and a lived-in feel. Of course, the sequences everyone remembers from these movies are the ones in the printing press, witnessing the creation of the paper and its trek from blank page to the delivery truck, and Krasner spotlights it beautifully.\n\nI’m kind of stumped as to why “Deadline – U.S.A.” doesn’t have a bigger footprint with film scholars today. Is it because Brooks’ later work is flashier and more praised by the Academy? Is it because it’s one of those noir films that isn’t “really” a noir but lumped into the genre because someone is killed onscreen? Is it because that title really does suck that badly? Whatever the case, this is grand entertainment and a worthy addition to anyone’s film library – I highly recommend it.\n\nScore: ****1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey/The AFI Top 100 Odyssey\n\nAFI Top 100 Ranking: 3\n\nWriter: Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre\n\nCinematography: Arthur Edeson\n\nMusic: Max Steiner\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: November 26, 1942\n\nWe open in the title city, a place where everyone seems eternally stuck, hoping to escape to America away from Nazi forces. The only one who doesn’t seem to want to leave is Rick (Humphrey Bogart). He owns a bar where everyone finds themselves every night, good or bad, poor or rich. One night, Rick’s lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) walks into the bar…with her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), and it just happens that he’s enemy number one for Nazi officials, who are desperate to find a reason to arrest him and take him to a concentration camp before he can get to America. To get out of Casablanca, Ilsa and Laszlo need “letters of transit,” impossible to get, and Rick just happens to have what seems like the last two in the city.\n\nIt may seem as if the movie is purposely manipulative just by reading the synopsis, but it never seems forced or overwrought when you are watching it. That begins with the casting—has there ever been another movie where the cast is, as a whole, so uniformly perfect for their roles? Bogart, known for his tough guy roles, plays another one here…but we get to see him fall head over heels for Ilsa and lose her in flashback, so instead of just being a dick we understand his pain. And Bergman was never lovelier, and the way she plays the small intricacies of the love triangle she is at the center of would have been lost on a lesser actress. That lesser actress would have simply been making love to Rick with her eyes from moment one, but Bergman rightly plays it cooler. Henreid is great at playing the straight man, interesting enough to be the hinge the story moves on but not engaging enough for us to root that he sticks with Ilsa.\n\nAnd then there’s the supporting cast, filled with character actors doing their very best to steal scenes. Claude Rains gives the performance of his long and celebrated career as the sort-of-bad/sort-of-good police captain who gets all the best zingers (he shuts down Rick’s bar because of gambling while being handed his roulette winnings). Conrad Veidt is menacing as the one genuinely bad guy in the movie (the Nazi insignia is the first hint), and then there’s S.Z. Sakall and Dooley Wilson as Rick’s trusted confidants and employees. The film throws a nice twist early when Peter Lorre shows up as an oily ne’er-do-well. We assume he’ll stick around to make trouble throughout the film, but then is grabbed and we learn later he’s murdered, a true shock considering we expect someone like Lorre to have more of a fundamental role. Though the love triangle is the film’s center, it’s a fuller, better movie because the supporting cast help to paint in the edges.\n\nWhile the cast is a film noir lover’s dream, this is another one of those movies where a bunch of critics fudge the line as to what a noir is to lump the film in. Though it’s thrilling, this isn’t a thriller. And despite the shadows of noir being omnipresent, no one seems interested in embracing them.\n\nJulius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch’s screenplay takes variations on scenes that seem long familiar, shine them and reverse our expectations until they seem genuinely new. I want to cite examples, but I could literally pick any scene in the film. Okay, fine, let’s talk about the moment Ilsa finally caves and admits she still loves Rick. When she enters the scene Rick (and we) knows she just wants the letters of transit, they play a mind game and Rick tries to give her the cold shoulder once too often, so instead of trying to seduce him she pulls a gun on him.\n\nRick’s character arc is inspired. This woman he once loved who left him for reasons unknown has returned. Now he’s cold and can’t open up…and because of that, won’t give her the letters. To finally do the right thing, he must admit to himself that he does still love her… but by doing that he’ll lose her forever. It’s a fantastic Catch-22 where, even though we know it’s an inevitable ending, it still affects us deeply. After an hour-and-a-half of bluntly stating that he doesn’t stick his neck out for anyone, he makes her get on that plane even though, let’s face it, there’s no real reason she couldn’t stay in Casablanca with him. But he knows it would kill her, and he’d rather die himself than see her suffer.\n\nDirector Michael Curtiz (“Mildred Pierce”) filmed the movie in a straightforward, understated style…and thank God for that. Curtiz simply let the film be what it was instead of forcing it to be a cookie-cutter studio picture, and the results give “Casablanca” all the more power. I must ask a silly question about the atmosphere he creates, though. Why is there a searchlight constantly searching the streets of the city? What are they looking for, exactly?\n\nAnd then there’s the music. I prefer Max Steiner’s score in this film to his more lauded work on “Gone With the Wind”…there’s just something about the way he incorporates the song “As Time Goes By” into the score subtly while still creating several other themes that are just as timeless (seriously, I didn’t mean it as a pun). Then again, I’m always a pushover for the Henry Mancini style, where the entire score for a movie is built out of a single song (for example, “Moon River” in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”).\n\nI also adore how this movie seems built on fate, both in the storytelling device of having Ilsa walk into Rick’s bar after all these years, and in how it seemed like all of these Hollywood workhorses (who had worked with just about everyone) finally came together for this specific project.\n\nI would also like to note that you, dear reader, should be very proud of me for not inserting endless examples of the classic quotes from the movie, about ten of which have become so well-known they have become part of public consciousness. And, really, there were a ton of opportunities. Especially here, at the end of the article. But I’m not going to do it…but if I did, you know which one I’d choose.\n\nMy Score (out of 5): *****\n\nAwards: “Casablanca” won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Bogart was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Paul Lukas for “Watch on the Rhine.” Rains was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost to Charles Coburn in “The More the Merrier.” Steiner was nominated for Best Scoring of a Dramatic of Comedy Picture (also nominated was “Hangmen Also Die!”) but lost to Alfred Newman in “The Song of Bernadette.” Edeson was nominated for Best Black-and-White Cinematography but lost to Arthur C. Miller for “The Song of Bernadette.” Owen Marks was nominated for Best Film Editing but lost to George Amy for “Air Force.”\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Arthur T.

Gerstad\n\nMusic: Frederick Hollander\n\nRelease: June 15, 1945\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\n“Conflict” is an A-picture from Warner Bros. starring one gigantic star in Humphrey Bogart and another A-lister in Sydney Greenstreet… which sounds like a recipe for success. And yet those auspices turn into the film’s problems, to the point where I wish the same storyline was turned into a leaner, meaner B-picture with no major stars in it.\n\nBogart stars as Dick Mason, whose marriage to Kathryn (Rose Hobart) is on the rocks, not least in part because Dick is in love with Kathryn’s younger sister Evelyn (Alexis Smith). After a car accident, Dick is stuck with a broken leg in a wheelchair, but fakes not being able to walk anymore in order to pull off murdering Kathryn. All seems to go off without a hitch… until Dick notices small clues pointing to the fact that Kathryn may be alive, or that someone is fucking with him.\n\nThis is a great premise, somewhat similar to the classic noir “Les Diaboliques.” That movie had a sense of grit and danger that is nowhere to be found here. There’s no real escalation to the way Dick is being driven crazy. The film is less than 90 minutes, but feels way longer. With an awesome set-up like “your wife might have survived her murder!”, one expects harbingers of doom, burning effigies and notes written in blood on mirrors. We get a mysterious key, a locket at a jeweler and the slowest chase of a woman in a feathered hat across a town that I’ve ever seen. It’s all so tasteful that it barely makes an impact. By the time we make a second visit to the pawn shop where the locket is allegedly being stored, I was checking my watch.\n\nBogart does well as the murderer, but he never gets to unleash his madness in a way he did in something like “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” which makes his performance feel like a missed opportunity. There’s this weird… gloss?… around his character after the murder where the filmmakers (and, more than likely, studio executives) wanted to paint him as the villain, but also underline that he’s not really all that bad of a guy. Hell, when he’s finally caught at the finale, he’s not even mad about it – in fact, he’s calm enough to politely ask the cops expositional questions in case the audience couldn’t put two and two together themselves. There’s also a genuinely baffling scene where he, without irony, encourages his rival for Evelyn’s affection to propose to her again.\n\nSpeaking of Evelyn, she is the third major sin the movie commits, specifically that the filmmakers have no idea what to do with her. She is, after all, the thing that sets the entire plot in motion, but for most of the movie just sits there twiddling her thumbs. She doesn’t seem super upset that her sister is dead. She doesn’t fall in love with Dick after the murder (this also stinks of studio interference). Hell, she doesn’t even appear in the third act of the movie, an afterthought to everything she set in motion.\n\nThe screenplay by Arthur T. Horman (“Dark Waters”) and Dwight Taylor (nothing special) is muddled throughout. You get the feeling that there were either six drafts too many or two drafts too few before the cameras rolled. Poor Greenstreet sits around for most of the movie with nothing to do, even though the audience knows he’s going to function heavily in the finale… since you don’t hire Sydney Greenstreet and then have him do nothing but twiddle his thumbs.\n\nGreenstreet does what he can with his role and, as stated previously, Bogart doesn’t embarrass himself either. Smith and Hobart are just kinda there, but I don’t blame them since their roles aren’t exactly given any depth. You really were hoping for one big dynamite scene between Bogart and Greenstreet, especially after how well they were paired in “The Maltese Falcon” (the statue can be seen in the background of one of the scenes), but alas, it was not to be.\n\nThe director is Curtis Bernhardt, and he seems like one of those guys who is either fully keyed-in to his project (“Possessed”) or just stumbling around in the dark (“High Wall”). This appears to be more like the latter, unfortunately. That said, at least the movie looks pretty. Bernhardt is working with cinematographer Merritt B. Gerstad on his only noir, which is a shame because the moody mountain stuff is aces. The last shot of the movie in particular, with the characters wandering out of a valley into a cold, almost alien light, is quite the stunner.\n\nAside from the aforementioned “Les Diaboliques,” I know that there is a better version of this movie out there. Picture something done by Columbia or even Monogram, with a C-list star as Dick who the studio wasn’t afraid to let be a full-on villain. The Evelyn character could full-on fall in love with him after the murder, and there could be a build to Dick’s madness that involves fun and macabre instead of pawned lockets.\n\nBut alas, that movie was not to be. Instead, “Conflict” is an entirely forgettable noir film that misunderstands its dynamite premise and loses track of its most important character. This is one of those films where I am not unhappy I saw it, but I’m also not going to remember more than a few frames of it by next week. What a pity… there was so much potential here.\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Jules Furthman and William Faulkner\n\nBased on the novel by Ernest Hemingway\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Walter Brennan\n\nCinematography: Sidney Hickox\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: October 11, 1944\n\nThe saga of Ernest Hemingway’s 1937 novel “To Have and Have Not” and its relationship with Hollywood is an insane one. Director Howard Hawks, who would direct the first adaptation of the novel, openly told Hemingway that it was his worst story… and yet it was made and remade three times over a 20 year period. More than that, each time was by an all-timer director: Hawks, then Michael Curtiz, then Don Seigel. What drew the talent to this story in particular? Over the next three weeks, I’m going to dive into the three adaptations.\n\nI also got my hands on the novel itself and tried to read it. Yes, tried. I have not read all of Hemingway’s work, but I can see Hawks’ assessment that it’s his worst story being entirely correct. It’s super, super racist. So racist I had to write the word “super” twice. More than that, it’s just not well-written. It’s jumbled. Confused. Not confusing… confused. What the hell did Hawks see in the book?\n\nNot much, it turns out. His adaptation of the novel is about as loose as one can imagine… almost “Lawnmower Man” loose. Essentially only the character names are the same, and a few of their jobs. That’s not an exaggeration.\n\nThe choice to run as far away from the content of the novel as possible is the right one… since, as previously established, the book is not good. The film focuses on Steve (Humphrey Bogart), a broken man who owns a fishing ship in Martinique who makes a living by taking rich men on fishing trips. His only real friend is Eddie (Walter Brennan), an alcoholic who needs at least a few drinks in the morning to simply function. His current client (Walter Sande) owes him a lot of money, and promises to give it to Steve the next morning when the banks open since he doesn’t have it on him. But that night at the hotel bar, Steve notices a woman named Slim (Lauren Bacall) lift his client’s wallet…\n\nSteve confronts Slim, and they discover a bunch of traveler’s checks, more than enough to cover Steve’s payment, and a ticket out of town the next morning before the banks open. Cornering his client, Steve demands for the money… only to see the client shot to death seconds before he can sign the checks. Ouch. Despite claiming political ambivalence, a now-broke Steve is forced to use his ship as transport for two French resistance fighters. And, unsurprisingly, nothing goes right.\n\nIf those last few plot developments sound a lot like “Casablanca,” (which was directed by Curtiz, who would later direct the second adaptation of “To Have and Have Not,” “The Breaking Point”) that’s because they do. The political ambivalence of Bogart’s character that gives way to him doing the right thing feels very similar within the DNA of the two films, as does an important supporting role for a piano player (Hoagy Carmichael). That said, this is not a “Glinda”/“Affair in Trinidad” situation. The ultimate narrative is different enough that this film creates its own identity separate that all-time classic. In other words, it didn’t bug me.\n\nIt’s also, frankly, a very good movie.\n\nThough critics may disagree, I liked this more than Hawks’ other iconic noir, “The Big Sleep.” The amount of talent behind the camera and in front of it is stacked, my friends. The screenplay is by William Faulkner (!!!) and Jules Furthman (“Nightmare Alley”), who would also co-write “The Big Sleep” together. Cinematographer Sidney Hickox would also work on that film, as well as other films noir like “Dark Passage.” All are at the top of their game, creating an engaging world of shadows and specters it’s easy to get lost within.\n\nThat said, the reason “To Have and Have Not” has remained a classic is right there on the poster: Bogart and Bacall. It’s fascinating to watch the movie knowing all the relationship baggage that was going on during production. The affair putting Bogart and Hawks at odds. The dissolution of Bogart’s marriage. And yet, when the duo are onscreen, the chemistry still sparks and you can tell the two performers are having a blast with one another. Call me crazy, but you can actually feel them falling in love during certain sequences. The fantastic dialogue, several quotes of which rank among the best in film history, helps quite a lot with the chemistry.\n\nThere is a story that the screenwriters actually wrote two versions of the script: one where Bacall’s Slim character was much less prominent and one (the one ultimately used) where she sticks around for the entire running time. And, watching the film, you can’t help but notice that – after the midpoint – Slim doesn’t have much to do but stand around and be supportive. You can see the exact moment where she would have left the narrative.\n\nThere are other small problems I have with the storytelling. Despite Brennan’s best efforts, Eddie comes off as annoying and – when his fate comes into play in the third act – you are less emotionally invested than you should be. That said, so much of the film works wonderfully that those small issues probably seem a little better than they are.\n\nDespite the title and character names, this is not really an adaptation of “To Have and Have Not.” And I’m entirely okay with that. It’s an excellent spiritual sibling of “Casablanca” and a great noir. Up next is “The Breaking Point,” still unseen by me as of this writing. It’s supposed to be a closer adaptation of the novel… so we’ll see.\n\nScore: ****1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Steve Fisher and Oliver H.P.

How’s that for faint praise? It’s a shame that it’s as “meh” as it is considering that, while Humphrey Bogart will forever be the face of film noir, he didn’t really make that many movies in the genre. As a result, expectations are higher for those he did appear in. And this one? It doesn’t quite make the cut.\n\nBogart plays Rip, a former taxi company owner who just got back from serving in the war with his best buddy, Johnny (William Prince). When word gets to them that they’re going to get medals, Johnny literally jumps out of a moving train and disappears. Rip decides to investigate, following “Johnny” (not his real name) to his town… where he finds his friend’s corpse burned beyond recognition on a slab in the morgue. He searches for answers – was it his wife Coral (Lizabeth Scott), or gambling club owner Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky)? And what does a murder Johnny was charged with in the past have to do with his death in the present?\n\nMost aspects of the movie are fine, but there are two major aspects that hobble it… and I want to discuss both of them first to get them out of the way.\n\nThe first is the script, which appears to be cobbled together by about 26 writers, all of whom got four-and-a-half pages, none of which were sequential. Am I overstating things? Well, the movie starts with a flash forward of a beaten-up Rip in a church confessing his sins to a priest. Do we learn later that he was Catholic? No. Does this flash forward pay off in some way? No. The movie catches up to the scene two-thirds of the way through and then Rip immediately leaves the church… and the detour is never revisited. For a guy who owns a taxi (or taxi company? It’s not clear), Rip’s dialogue sure mimics a hardboiled private dick the further we get into a movie. Everyone’s motivations are unclear, but not in a fun mysterious way – they are unclear to the point where, when the villains begin explaining things at the end, you sit there and go “whaaa…?” And as the movie climaxes, Rip is shot in the gut but wakes up in the hospital with his arm in a sling…?\n\nSome of the dialogue is very fun (though, again, it doesn’t often suit the character speaking), and I love the fact that the menagerie of writers include big-time war weapons in a noir film… it’s a weird wrinkle that works wonders. Scenes are often interesting, but function as islands unto themselves. They don’t connect.\n\nThe second major issue is Scott, who is terrible.\n\nYes, terrible.\n\nI liked her work as a supporting character in “The Strange Love of Martha Ivers” and thought she was fine but the weakest part of the otherwise excellent “Desert Fury.” But here? Yikes. I might as well address the elephant in the room … this lady looks one hell of a lot like Bogie’s favorite girl Friday, Lauren Bacall. Bogart and Bacall had already been paired in the gigantic cultural hits “To Have and Have Not” and “The Big Sleep,” and their third collaboration, “Dark Passage,” would be released just a few months after “Dead Reckoning.” Scott’s hair and make-up seems to be done to mimic Bacall’s appearance in the above films. Her already low voice seems just an octave lower to match Bacall’s famous pipes. You see what I’m going for, right? Scott was already hogtied because she was packaged to impersonate an actress she could never match, and the fact that she has so-so chemistry with Bogart is another nail in the coffin. I was shocked to discover that Rita Hayworth of all people was in negotiations for this film before Scott’s casting. I don’t think Hayworth would have been right for Coral, but she would have certainly been better than this shallow impersonation because she would have been different.\n\nThe rest of the cast are quite good. Bogart is playing another variation on Bogart’s most famous noir persona, not challenging himself but not really needing to. Carnovsky chews the scenery well as the epitome of evil, and Charles Case is quite good as the Detective trailing Rip. I wanna give a special shout-out to Ruby Dandridge as the awesomely named Hyacinth (all the names here are quite awesome, actually), the temporary maid for Rip and Coral. She is genuinely funny and gets the biggest laugh of the movie when she is handed a gun and does not hold it up correctly.\n\nJohn Cromwell (“The Racket”) directs things well for most of the running time, taking advantage of the Florida locations and collaborating with cinematographer Leo Tover (“The Heiress”) to create the proper mood and shadows after night falls. The one notable exception is unfortunately the climactic car crash, which looks shockingly fake considering the film’s budget and is a letdown considering the atmosphere created elsewhere.\n\nSo yeah, “Dead Reckoning” is one helluva mixed bag. Bogart fantatics should track it down late in their deep dive into his filmography, and most of it is missable for the casual noir fan.\n\nScore: **"
