        "text": "Â· London\n\nby Martin Vale [pseud. of Marguerite Veiller]\n\nLondon: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1938. Very Good. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1938. Stated Second Impression. Octavo; 95 pp. followed by one page of advertisements. Bright orange wrappers with text in black. Covers show some general smudging and a bit of rubbing at spine ends. Opens easily between gatherings but binding is holding soundly. Pages clean and unmarked. Overall, a nice copy of a scarce work later adapted as a movie of the same name starring Humphrey Bogart. (Inventory #: 12763)"
