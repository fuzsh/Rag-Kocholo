Octavo; 95 pp. followed by one page of advertisements. Bright orange wrappers with text in black. Covers show some general smudging and a bit of rubbing at spine ends. Opens easily between gatherings but binding is holding soundly. Pages clean and unmarked. Overall, a nice copy of a scarce work later adapted as a movie of the same name starring Humphrey Bogart. - The Two Mrs. Carrolls; A Play in Three Acts",
