        "text": "Joan II (January 28, 1312 – October 6, 1349) was Queen of Navarre from 1328 until her death. She was the only surviving child of King Louis X of France and Navarre, and Margaret of Burgundy, the second daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248–1306) and Agnes of France (1260–1327), the youngest daughter of King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. As such, she was a member of House of Burgundy, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty.\n\nThe future King Louis X of France was born in Paris, the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre, daughter of King Henri I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois who was the elder child and only daughter of Robert I, Count of Artois, and Matilda of Brabant. Robert I, Count of Artois was the fifth (and second surviving) son of King Louis VIII of France and Infanta Blanche of Castile.\n\nKing Louis X inherited the Kingdom of Navarre on the death of his mother, on April 4, 1305, and was crowned on October 1, 1307. On September 21, 1305, at age 15, he married Margaret of Burgundy and they had a daughter, Joan.\n\nLouis’ first wife, Margaret of Burgundy implicated in the Tour de Nesle affair, was found guilty of infidelity and was imprisoned until her death on August 14, 1315. Louis and Clémentina of Hungary were married that same year. Clémentina of Hungary was the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou, the titular King of Hungary, and Clémentina of Austria, daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg. She was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nKing Louis X died within a year of his marriage on June 5, 1316 leaving a pregnant wife. According to an agreement of the most powerful French lords, which was completed on July 16, if Clémentina gave birth to a son, the son was to be crowned King of France, but if a daughter was born, she and Joan could only inherit the Kingdom of Navarre and the counties of Champagne and Brie (the three realms that Louis X had inherited from his mother, Joan I of Navarre).\n\nIt was also agreed that Joan was to be sent to her mother’s relatives in Burgundy, but her marriage could not be decided without the consent of the members of the French royal family.\n\nQueen Clémentina gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as Jean I of France but the infant King lived only five days. His death precipitate a succession crisis.\n\nKing Louis X’s only other child was Princess Joan from his first marriage to Margaret of Burgundy. However, Joan’s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but King Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316.\n\nJoan’s mother, Margaret of Burgundy, and the other daughters-in-law of King Philippe IV of France, Joan and Blanche of Burgundy, were involved in the Tour de Nesle affair, were accused of adultery and were arrested in 1314. They were charged with adultery with two knights, the brothers Philippe and Walter of Aunay.\n\nAfter being tortured, one of the brothers confessed that they had been the lovers of Margaret and Blanche for three years. The Aunay brothers were soon executed, and Margaret and Blanche were imprisoned. After the scandal, the legitimacy of Joan of France became dubious, because her mother was accused of having had an extramarital affair around the year of Joan’s birth.\n\nWith the death of the infant King Jean I of France the French lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and elected Louis X’s brother, Philippe, as King Philippe V of France. King Philippe immediately had himself crowned at Reims. However, his legitimacy was challenged by the party of Louis X’s daughter Joan.\n\nKing Philippe V successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General’s determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne. The succession of Philippe, instead of Joan, set the precedent for the French royal succession that would be known as the Salic law.\n\nThe Navarrese noblemen also paid homage to King Philippe V. Joan’s maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, and uncle, Odo IV of Burgundy, made attempts to secure the counties of Champagne and Brie (which had been the patrimony of Louis X’s mother, Joan I of Navarre) to Joan, but the French royal troops defeated her supporters.\n\nAfter Philippe V married his daughter to Odo IV of Burgundy and granted him two counties as her dowry, Odo renounced Joan’s claim to Champagne and Brie in exchange for a compensation in March 1318. Joan married Philippe of Évreux, who was also a member of the French royal family.\n\nPhilippe of Évreux was the son of Louis, Count of Évreux, a younger son of King Philippe III of France by his second wife, Marie of Brabant, a daughter of Henri III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.\n\nPhilippe’s father was the founder of the Capetian House of Évreux, while his mother, Margaret (d. 1311), belonged to another Capetian branch, the House of Artois.\n\nKing Philippe V was succeeded by his brother, Charles IV, in both France and Navarre in 1322, but most Navarrese lords refused to swear loyalty to him. After Charles IV died in 1328, the Navarrese expelled the French governor and declared Joan the rightful monarch of Navarre as Queen Joan II of Navarre. Her husband, Philippe of Évreux, became King Philippe III of Navarre by right of his wife. They ruled Navarre jointly.\n\nIn France, Philippe of Valois was crowned king as King Philippe VI of France. He concluded an agreement with Joan and her husband, who renounced Joan’s claims to Champagne and Brie in exchange for three counties, while Philip acknowledged their right to Navarre. Joan and her husband were together crowned in Pamplona Cathedral on March 5, 1329."
