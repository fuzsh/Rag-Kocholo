        "text": "Hello there, beautiful queens! Today, we’re going to dive into the life of Yolande of Aragon, a powerful and influential queen who lived during the 15th century.\n\nYolande was born in 1384, the daughter of King John I of Aragon and his second wife, Violante of Bar. She grew up in a world of privilege and power, and was well-educated in the arts and sciences of her time. Her dad died when she was young and it was a bit of a shit show inheritance-wise. TL;DR, Yolande was passed over as queen for her uncle Martin. And she took that personally.\n\nIn 1400, Yolande married Louis II, Duke of Anjou. At first, Yolande was not into it (possibly because she was only 15 and maybe thought boys were gross), but she eventually fell in love with Louis which wasn’t always a given back then. The marriage was a political alliance, designed to strengthen the ties between Aragon and France. Over time, however, Yolande and Louis grew to love each other deeply, and their partnership became one of the most successful and enduring of the era.\n\nDuring her husband’s reign, Yolande became known for her intelligence, wit, and political acumen. She was a trusted advisor to Louis, and was often called upon to mediate disputes and make important decisions on his behalf. She was also deeply involved in the cultural and intellectual life of the French court, and was a patron of many artists and writers.\n\nIn 1417, Louis II died, leaving Yolande a widow at the age of 33. However, rather than retreating from public life, Yolande continued to wield her influence and power. She became a major player in French politics, and was a key figure in the struggle between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions during the Hundred Years’ War. She was a staunch supporter of the dauphin, Charles VII, and played a vital role in his eventual coronation as king of France.\n\nIn fact, she funded this little known historical figure, Joan of Arc. Maybe you’ve heard of her?\n\nYolande of Aragon was a remarkable woman who lived a remarkable life. She was a queen, a mother, a patron of the arts, and a political player of the highest order. Her legacy lives on today, and she continues to be an inspiration to women everywhere who seek to make a difference in the world. We hope you enjoyed learning about her, beautiful queens!"
