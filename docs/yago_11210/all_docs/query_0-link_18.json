        "text": "Ferdinand of Navarre, Prince of Viana (23 June 1500 - 7 November 1561) was Prince of Viana between 1500 and 1515 and Prince of Relante between 1515 and 1524. He was the first husband of Anna Maria of Genovia, Princess of Relante (the future Anna II of Genovia, Holy Roman Empress) and Blanche of Austria, the infant daughter of Anna by her second husband. He was removed from the Navarrese succession in 1515 following his marriage and executed in 1561 by the orders of his daughter Constance V of Genovia and her husband Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nLife[]\n\nParentage and Siblings[]\n\nFerdinand was the son of John III of Navarre and Queen Catherine of Navarre. He had two siblings: Henry (1503-1555) and Anne (1492-1532). He was the great-great-great-great-great-great grand-nephew of Eva of Le√≥n, Queen of Genovia. Through Eva, he was related to the Royal Genovian Houses of Queerer and Madaste.\n\nMarriage to Anna Maria of Genovia[]\n\nHis Genovian descent allowed Ferdinand to get engaged to Anna Maria of Genovia, who was the Princess of Relante at the time. Anna Maria was the energetic and wise niece of Philip I of Castile. Upon their first meeting, Ferdinand disliked Anna. Anna however wanted to be a good wife to Ferdinand. Upon his marriage, Ferdinand forfeited his Prince of Viana title, and therefore forfeited his Navarrese Succession Rights. His brother Henry would become King of Navarre in 1517. Ferdinand and Anna Maria's marriage was not happy, and Ferdinand didn't care nor pay attention to his wife, to whom he described as a \"walking toad\".\n\nAnna Maria could not take it anymore. In 1519 during a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Anna Maria had told Charles her thoughts on divorcing Ferdinand. Charles agreed to help Anna, as long as he became her next husband. Ferdinand did not hear of the plan. Charles and Anna Maria tried everything but the Pope wouldn't budge in annulling the union. Anna was forced back into her marriage with Ferdinand, much to Charles' displeasure and her own. The two separated that year, only seeing each other to produce children."
