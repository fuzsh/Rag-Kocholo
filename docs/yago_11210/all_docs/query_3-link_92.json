Any ideas?\n\n>Please e-mail. Thanx! :-)\n\n>Alice Beard\n\nAre you thinking of the fourteenth-century Foix/Navarre marriage?\n\nInes de Navarre, daughter of Philippe of Navarre (count of Evreux, king of\n\nNavarre), married Gaston Pheobus (1331-1391), count of Foix, in 1349; they\n\nbecame estranged after some years and she returned to live with her\n\nbrother, then king of Navarre, and died in 1396. Their only son, Gaston\n\nde Foix, viscount of Bearn, was imprisoned and (accidentally, it is said)\n\nkilled by his own father in 1381, as a result of an intrigue between\n\nNavarre and Foix; you can read about it in Jean Froissart's _Chronicles_,\n\nin the Penguin abridgement and translation, pp. 263-274. This younger\n\nGaston was married but purportedly died childless. They are in\n\nSchwennicke's Europaische Stammtafeln 3:146.\n\nNat Taylor\n\nIn a message dated 98-01-27 20:42:59 EST, you write:\n\n<< The folks you mention seem to be too early, unless the list my friend made\n\nhas\n\nan error of missing generations.\n\nAlice Beard\n\n>>\n\nMy 2 cents worth\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1. PIERRE DE GRALLY was born Abt. 1285, and died Aft. 1356. He married\n\nROSEMBURGE DE PERIGORD.\n\nChild of PIERRE and ROSEMBURGE is:\n\n2. i. ARCHAUMBAUD DE GRAILLY, d. 1412.\n\nGeneration No. 2\n\n2. ARCHAUMBAUD DE GRAILLY died 1412. He married ISABELLE DE CASTELBON 1381,\n\ndaughter of ROGER-BERNARD and GIRAUDE.\n\nChild of ARCHAUMBAUD and ISABELLE is:\n\n3. i. JEAN LER DE FOIX, b. Abt. 1382; d. 4-May-1436.\n\nGeneration No. 3\n\n3. JEAN LER DE FOIX was born Abt. 1382, and died 4-May-1436. He married\n\nJEANNE D'ALBRET Feb-1421/22, daughter of CHARLES and MARIE.\n\nChild of JEAN and JEANNE is:\n\n4. i. GASTON IV DE FOIX, b. 1423; d. 25-Jul-1472, Roncevalles.\n\nGeneration No. 4\n\n4. GASTON IV DE FOIX was born 1423, and died 25-Jul-1472 in Roncevalles. He\n\nmarried ELEANOR D'ARAGON 30-Jul-1436, daughter of JEAN and BLANCHE.\n\nChild of GASTON and ELEANOR is:\n\n5. i.

She married FRANCOIS DE\n\nBRETAGNE 27-Jun-1471 in Clisson, FRA, son of RICHARD and MARGUERITE.\n\nChild of MARGUERITE and FRANGOIS is:\n\ni. ANNE DE BRETAGNE6, b. 25-Jan-1476/77, Nantes, FRA; d. 9-Jan-1513/14,\n\nBlois, FRA.\n\nNotes for ANNE DE BRETAGNE:\n\nAnne de Bretagne, duchess of Brittany, maybe one of the most popular\n\ncharacters in Brittany, married once to a german emperor (Maximilian von\n\nOsterreich), and twice to a king of France (Charles VIII and Louis XII).\n\nThe \"marriage\" to Maximilian appears to have been more of an engagement,\n\none which was never completed or consummated.\n\nWilliam Addams Reitwiesner\n\nwr...@erols.com\n\nAlways optimistic--Dave\n\nI am trying to get a copy of two pages from the NEw England Historical and\n\nGenealogical Review on the de Greene family of Green's NOrton etc., from\n\nInterLibrary Loan here. The reference appears in David Faris,\n\n\"Plantagenet Ancestry...\" and has been referred to several times on\n\nGen-Med, but the answer that came back on ILL is that nothing on the\n\nGreenes appears on those pages.\n\nCould someone who has the reference at hand confirm the vol and pages as\n\nthe following or correct them :-)\n\nVol 23, pp. 180-81 January 1969\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nNorma Leigh Rudinsky\n\nrudi...@ucs.orst.edu"
