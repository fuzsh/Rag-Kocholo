        "text": "Queen of Navarre from 1425 to 1441\n\nFor other persons of this name, see Blanca of Navarre (disambiguation).\n\nBlanche I (Spanish: Blanca I de Navarra; 6 July 1387[1] – 1 April 1441) was Queen of Navarre from the death of her father, King Charles III, in 1425 until her own death. She had been Queen of Sicily from 1402 to 1409 by marriage to King Martin I, serving as regent of Sicily from 1404 to 1405 and from 1408 to 1415.\n\nBlanche was the second eldest daughter of King Charles III of Navarre and infanta Eleanor of Castile. She became the heiress to the throne of Navarre on the death of her elder sister, Joan, in 1413.\n\nBlanche married firstly Martin the Younger, King of Sicily and Prince of Aragon. They were married by proxy on 21 May 1402 in Catania. Blanche traveled to meet Martin, and they were married in person on 26 December 1402. The bride was about 15 years old and the groom 28.\n\nMartin had been in need of legitimate heirs, as he had survived his previous wife and former co-ruler, Queen Maria of Sicily, and their only son. From October 1404 to August 1405, she served as regent of Sicily during the absence of her spouse in Aragon.\n\nFrom August 1408 to July 1409, she served as regent of Sicily during the absence of her spouse in Sardinia. When Martin died on 25 July 1409, he was succeeded by his own father, Martin I of Aragon. Her former father-in-law allowed her to continue as regent of Sicily, which she did also after his death, during the years of succession struggle in Aragon. She was a popular regent in Sicily, where she was seen as a symbol of Sicilian independence against Aragon. There were plans to marry her to Nicolás Peralta, a descendant of the Sicilian royal house, and thereby restore the Sicilian royal house with her and Nicolás as king and queen.\n\nWith the victory of Ferdinand I in Aragon, Blanche lost her regency power in Sicily, which was annexed to Aragon in November 1415, and left for Navarre.\n\nUpon her return to Navarre, Blanche was sworn in as heir to the throne in Olite the 28 October 1415 and was given allegiance by the lords. On 6 November 1419, Blanche married her second husband, John, duke of Peñafiel, the second son of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque, by proxy in Olite. Ferdinand had succeeded his maternal uncle Martin I in 1412.\n\nJohn travelled to meet her. On 10 July 1420, they were married in person in Pamplona. The couple first lived in Peñafiel, but were called to live in Navarre by her father in 1422.\n\nCharles III died on 8 September 1425 and Blanche succeeded him as Queen regnant of Navarre. John became King of Navarre in her right as John II, and the couple were crowned together in Pamplona 15 May 1429.\n\nDon Juan Vélaz de Medrano, Lord of Igúzquiza, royal chamberlain of the Kings of Navarre and Aragón, accompanied Queen Blanche I on a pilgrimage to Santa María del Pilar in 1433.[6]\n\nBlanche died in Santa María la Real de Nieva in 1441. After her death, John kept the government of Navarre in his own hands, from the hands of their own son Charles of Viana, the rightful heir of the line of Navarrese kings. He would become King of Aragon and King of Sicily upon the death of his elder brother Alfonso V of Aragon in 1458.\n\nBlanche and Martin had one child together:\n\nInfante Martin of Aragon and Sicily (1406–1407)\n\nBlanche and John II of Aragon had four children together:\n\nCharles (IV) of Navarre (1421–1461)\n\nJoan of Navarre (1423 – 22 August 1425)\n\nBlanche (II) of Navarre (1424–1464), married Henry IV of Castile. The marriage was never consummated. After 13 years of marriage, Henry sought and obtained a divorce. Blanca was sent home, where her family imprisoned her, and she was later killed by poison.[citation needed]\n\nEleanor (1426–1479) Queen of Navarre (1479)\n\nFößel, Amalie (2013). \"The Political Traditions of Female Rulership in Medieval Europe\".
