        "text": "Can't really talk about internal Castilian affairs, however the first obvious butterfly of Henry IV of Castille leaving a son behind would be that Isabella won't succeed him: thus, Spain's unification won't happen or will be delayed. It's also possible Isabella doesn't marry Ferdinand II of Aragon in the end, but I don't know her story enough to be sure.\n\nRegarding Navarra, the butterflies would be interesting. Blanche II of Navarra was actually one of the three children born out of John II of Aragon and Blanche I of Navarra's marriage alongside her brother Charles and sister Eleanor. Upon Blanche I's death, John II of Aragon usurped the crown of Navarra while the King should have been his son Charles. As a result, Charles and Blanche both rebelled against their father, Charles entitling himself as \"Charles IV, King of Navarra\". Upon his death, Blanche inherited his rights and proclaimed herself \"Blanche II, Queen of Navarra\".\n\nOTL, Blanche II's claim and the Navarese rebellion died with her because she was childless and the crown passed to her sister Eleanor, who had remained loyal to John II of Aragon. ITTL, with Blanche II having a son with Henry IV of Castille, we have an interesting situation: the King of Castile as a claim on the Navarese throne who is usurped by the King of Aragon... There is room for a War and Castile might get Navarra in this scenario.\n\nI do know a bit more about Isabel's story. From what I know, she'll resist any attempt by the nobles to use her to cause trouble for a legitimate heir. Of the marriageable suitors that courted Isabel in OTL, the only one she really had interest in was Fernando according to what I've read. I'm not sure how this effects her brother though. One of the conditions for ending the uprising by Alfonso was that Isabel had power over who she could marry. This won't happen if there is no rebellion obviously.\n\nDoes Blanche still die? Does Henry still marry Joanna?\n\nThis also probably strengthens Villena against all comers, maybe even to Alvaro de Luna levels if he plays his cards right.\n\nRegarding Navarra, the butterflies would be interesting.

There is room for a War and Castile might get Navarra in this scenario.\n\nThat's what I thought too, a possible conflict over the Navarrese inheritance. In this case, or Henry IV gives open support to Charles of Vianna against John II of Aragon (would it be enough for him to defeat his father) or Charles still dies childless and Henry claims Navarre against John.\n\nJust a doubt, assuming that Henry is able to unite Castile and Navarre under his son, what would happen to the French fiefs owned by the Navarrese monarchs? Would the Valois take them?\n\nI do know a bit more about Isabel's story. From what I know, she'll resist any attempt by the nobles to use her to cause trouble for a legitimate heir.

Does Henry still marry Joanna?\n\nGive the conditions how Blanche died IOTL I think that she probably would live longer ITTL, and Henry wouldn't marry Joanna of Portugal.\n\nSo, IOTL Henry IV of Castile was believed to be impotent, as his two wifes couldn't get pregnant. When his second wife Joan of Portugal gave birth to his daughter Joanna La Beltraneja the nobilitybelieved that she was a bastard, and it sparked the conflict that would eventually lead to Isabella I and Ferdinand of Aragon becoming the monarchs of an united Spain.\n\nHowever, WI Henry got more luck and had a son by his first wife, Blanche II of Navarre? What would be the effects of it? Would the nobility still rebell against him for other reason? And what could be the consequences in Navarre? Any ideas?\n\nIf Henry IV of Castille had a son with Blanche depending on when he is born, Isabella and Alfonso might not be born either but if Henry IV had a son with Joan of Portugal, Isabella or Alfonso will have no chance to inherit Castile.\n\nGonzaga said:\n\nJust a doubt, assuming that Henry is able to unite Castile and Navarre under his son, what would happen to the French fiefs owned by the Navarrese monarchs? Would the Valois take them?\n\nThat would depend... If there are territories the rulers of Navarra only because they are his vassals, then the Valois could claim them. If the territories are part of the Navarese's hereditary possessions, then I'm not sure the Valois could do anything about it.\n\nOf course, the days of the Spider King are not that far off... With Louis XI, anything is possible given how scheming and effective he was in politics\n\nIf Henry IV of Castille had a son with Blanche depending on when he is born, Isabella and Alfonso might not be born either but if Henry IV had a son with Joan of Portugal, Isabella or Alfonso will have no chance to inherit Castile.\n\nNot necessarily, only if such son by Joan of Portugal is born early enough to convince the nobility that Henry's previous lack of children was to be blamed on Blanche. If this son is just a male version of Joanna la Beltraneja there would still be the rumors of bastardy.\n\nAnyway, I agree that Henry having a son (or more) with Blanche would probably butterfly away the second marriage of John II of Castile, avoind the birth of Isabella and Alfonso.\n\nHenry though, even if he can have a son is still Henry and that means pretty weak. He'll still hand out titles and alienate lands like he did in OTL. Alfonso's rebellion was pretty much led by the nobility in OTL since they had more of the power until Isabel grabbed it back. Without Alfonso and Isabel I don't know who the nobles would rally around for a legitimate revolt.\n\nCastillian centralization will proceed more slowly in this TL I think. What was the character of Blanche? Castillian queens often had a great deal of power (though stepped aside for brothers or sons for the good of the kingdom historically). It could be possible that Blanche would become a political force in Castille if their son was small when Henry dies. Or perhaps the nobility would go to Blanche and try to get Henry sidelined in favor of a regency council for his son? Historically it was also the towns that supported the under-age heirs against the nobility because it allowed them more freedom.\n\nHenry though, even if he can have a son is still Henry and that means pretty weak.

So that might be changed a bit ITTL as she was a son to take care."
