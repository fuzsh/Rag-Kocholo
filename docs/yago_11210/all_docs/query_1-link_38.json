        "meta_description": "Blanche II of Navarre (9 June 1424 â€“ 2 December 1464), titular queen of Navarre, was the daughter of John II of Aragon and Blanche I of Navarre. She was also Princess of Asturias by marriage. She married Henry IV of Castile in 1440. The marriage was never consummated. In 1453, after thirteen years, Henry sought the annulment of the marriage. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche. After this, Blanche was sent home to Navarre, where she was imprisoned by her family.",
