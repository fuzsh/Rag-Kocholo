Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCatherine of Aragon was King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella of Spain’s daughter. The Church of England and the Catholic Church separated due to the Pope’s refusal to grant King Henry VIII an annulment to Catherine so that he could remarry. In 1536, Catherine passed away in England. Mary Tudor, her only surviving child, acceded to the throne in 1553.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Catherine of Aragon, or you can download our 27-page Catherine of Aragon worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE AND MARRIAGE\n\nCatherine, the youngest child of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, was raised to be a politician after her birth in 1485.\n\nThe young princess was educated to the highest standards, studying philosophy, needlework, Latin, and French.\n\nIn 1501, she married Prince Arthur, the heir apparent to the English throne and son of Henry VII.\n\nUnfortunately, Arthur passed away in 1502 after only a year, leaving Catherine, then only sixteen, a widow.\n\nCatherine married Henry VIII in 1509 following a dispute between Spain and England over her dowry, during which Catherine became the first female envoy in the annals of European history.\n\nYoung King Henry had lofty aspirations and the education and intelligence to support them; together, they were the epitome of a Renaissance marriage.\n\nCatherine presided over England as regent from 1512 to 1514 when Henry was engaged in military operations in France, just three years after their marriage.\n\nA group of 11,000 men rode from London to Dover behind Henry and a pregnant Catherine. At Dover Castle, before leaving, Henry formally inaugurated Catherine as regent and appointed Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, and William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, as her counselors.\n\nThe Scots were preparing an assault on England by July 1513, perhaps believing they could easily overcome England with Henry away in France.\n\nThe 80,000-man army of Scottish King James IV crossed the border into England on August 22, 1513, giving Catherine her first significant duty as regent.\n\nThat year, in September, Catherine traveled to the north and addressed the troops in a stirring speech, encouraging them to fight for England’s good cause against the Scots.\n\nIt was a strong indication of Catherine‘s political influence and strength. However, there were no further conflicts after the English defeated the Scots on September 9 in the Battle of Flodden, a particularly terrible battle in which 10,000 Scottish troops and their King, James IV, died.\n\nThe Scottish banner and coat of King James IV, who had died, were presented to the Queen as prizes following the fight by her advisor, the Earl of Surrey, who had secured the victory.\n\nUnfortunately, Catherine was worn out after participating in the Battle of Flodden, which led to the early birth of her son, who would soon die.\n\nIt is a credit to her character and diplomatic abilities that she would play a significant role in the peace and reconciliation between the two countries at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, having first advised Henry VIII against allying with Francis I.\n\nCatherine used her position as Queen and her experience as a diplomat to good use through hosting dignitaries, dances, and theatrical performances, as well as personally receiving the French King Francis I in the French camp for a sumptuous supper.\n\nShe also shared the stage with the French Queen Claude de France to symbolize the newly formed alliance between the two monarchies.\n\nCatherine showed her political expertise and diplomatic prowess even before the meeting started. They threw a feast for Charles V, the new Holy Roman Emperor, Catherine‘s nephew when the Royal entourage paused at Canterbury en route. Charles V was a significant figure in European affairs.\n\nShe used her abilities as a hostess once more, but this gathering would ultimately lead to conflict between Francis I and Henry VIII.\n\nUnfortunately, as with most medieval queens, their accomplishments, talents, and political prowess are frequently disregarded. The success of women is often determined by their capacity to procreate, produce heirs, spares for the king, and thus ensure the continuation of their dynasty.\n\nSix children were born to Catherine, but only one of them—the future Mary Tudor—lived to maturity.\n\nHenry VIII’s desire for a divorce was sparked by his difficulty with only having a daughter.\n\nHe believed his marriage to Catherine was invalid because of her prior union with his brother, and the king petitioned Pope Clement VII for a divorce in 1527.\n\nCatherine proved her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, thus, the annulment was invalid in the eyes of the Catholic Church.\n\nGiven that Catherine‘s nephew was the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Pope Clement VII was hesitant to terminate her marriage to avoid upsetting him.\n\nHowever, Henry’s desire to wed a different woman ultimately resulted in the breakaway of the English church from Rome.\n\nThomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated at Henry’s secret marriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533.\n\nFAMILY BACKGROUND\n\nIsabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon had a fifth child, Catherine of Aragon. Her birthplace was Alcalá de Henares.\n\nThe grandmother of Catherine’s mother,\n\nCatherine of Lancaster, the daughter of Constance of Castile, and the second wife of John of Gaunt, a descendant of Edward III of England, was most likely the inspiration for the name Catherine.\n\nCatherine of Lancaster, a child of Constance and John, wed Henry III of Castile and bore John II of Castile, Isabella’s father.\n\nPeter (Pedro) of Castile, sometimes known as Peter the Cruel, was deposed by his brother Henry (Enrique) II. Constance of Castile was his daughter.\n\nJohn of Gaunt attempted to usurp the throne of Castile by claiming that his wife Constance was a direct descendant of Peter.\n\nFerdinand, Catherine’s father, was the great-grandson of Philippa of Lancaster, Blanche of Lancaster’s first husband, and the mother of John of Gaunt.\n\nHenry IV of England was Philippa’s brother. Consequently, Catherine of Aragon possessed a sizable amount of English royal ancestry.\n\nHer parents were also members of the House of Trastámara, an Iberian peninsula dynasty that ruled from 1369 to 1516.\n\nThe dynasty descended from King Henry (Enrique) II of Castile, who was ousted by his brother Peter in 1369 as part of the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nThis Peter was the father of Isabella’s grandmother Constance of Castile, whom Henry John of Gaunt attempted to overthrow.\n\nLATER YEARS AND DEATH\n\nThe king tried multiple times to compel Catherine to accept the annulment, including isolating her from their daughter Mary. On the other hand, Catherine never recognized the legality of her annulment or Henry’s second marriage.\n\nIt had ramifications for Mary’s future. Their daughter had previously been considered England’s only heir to the throne.\n\nAlthough Mary was illegitimate soon after Anne Boleyn gave birth to their first daughter, Elizabeth, Elizabeth became the new successor to the crown.\n\nCatherine still viewed herself as Queen of England, so when Anne Boleyn appealed for her crown and treasures, she refused.\n\nOn Henry’s instructions, Catherine was kept apart from her daughter until her death at 50.\n\nCatherine died in 1536 at Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, England, and is buried at Peterborough Cathedral.\n\nFUN FACTS\n\nMost people forget that Catherine and Henry were married for 24 years, much of it happily. However, she is primarily recognized for failing to bear a male heir for the Tudor dynasty.\n\nIn 1513, Catherine served as regent with Governor of the Realm and Captain General titles while Henry waged war in France.\n\nCatherine was well-educated, well-liked by her subjects, and talented in her job as Queen.\n\nCatherine of Aragon was a legitimate claimant to the English crown. She was descended from John of Gaunt through two valid lines, one of which was through Blanche of Lancaster, making her a ‘genuine Lancastrian.’ She was King Henry VII’s third cousin.\n\nHenry VII acceded to the throne through the Beaufort line of the House of Lancaster. The problem is that the Beaufort line was initially illegitimate.\n\nBy marrying his mistress Catherine Swynford, Edward III’s son, John of Gaunt, legitimized the Beaufort dynasty by royal and papal proclamation. The Beaufort family, however, could never inherit the English crown.\n\nCatherine had red hair.\n\nThe pomegranate is Catherine’s emblem.\n\nShe insisted on being called “Queen” even after her divorce.\n\nLater wives of Henry were coincidentally named Catherine.\n\nOn the day of Catherine’s funeral, a strange coincidence happened, Anne Boleyn miscarried a male heir.\n\nCatherine of Aragon Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Catherine of Aragon across 27 in-depth pages.
