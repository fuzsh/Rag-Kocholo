Era hija de Sancho VI de Navarra y de Sancha de Castilla (hija ésta de Alfonso VII) y hermana de Sancho VII de Navarra.\n\nSe casó el 1 de julio de 1199 con Teobaldo III de Champaña. Tuvo un hijo: Teobaldo I de Navarra (1201–1253), rey de Navarra y conde de Champaña.\n\nA partir de 1201, y tras la muerte de su marido, Blanca gobernó el condado de Champaña como regente. La regencia estuvo llena de dificultades, el cuñado de Blanca, Enrique II de Champaña, dejó una deuda muy elevada a la que ella no pudo hacer frente después de la muerte de su esposo. Se cuestionó la legitimidad del infante en el momento de heredar el condado. Blanca fue desafiada por la hija de Enrique II, Felipa y su marido Erard de Brienne, uno de los condes más influyentes de la región. En 1215 se produjo la guerra entre los Brienne por la sucesión del condado, que no se resolvió hasta que Teobaldo II llegó a la mayoría de edad en 1222.\n\nPara finalizar las disputas Blanca tuvo que pagar una sustanciosa cantidad a los Brienne y asegurar su estabilidad. Se vio obligada a pactar la dote matrimonial de su sobrina Alicia, hija de Enrique II, al casarse en 1230 con el rey de Chipre, vendiendo los derechos del condado de Blois, de Sancerre y Chateaudun al rey de Francia.\n\nSu hermano, Sancho VII de Navarra, fue el último rey de la dinastía Ximena. Tras la Batalla de las Navas de Tolosa, casado, pero sin hijos legítimos, se retiró a un convento y Blanca de Navarra tuvo que gobernar como regente el Reino de Navarra. Tras la muerte de Berenguela de Navarra, que no tuvo descendencia de Ricardo Corazón de León, las Cortes de Navarra lideradas por el partido de los francos en confrontación con la Navarreria presionaron al anciano Sancho VII para nombrar heredero suyo al hijo de Blanca, hermana de Berenguela.\n\nBlanche de Navarre (1170s-1229) was Countess-consort of Champagne, then Regent of Champagne, and finally also regent of her native kingdom of Navarre.\n\n[edit] Family She was the youngest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre (d. 1194) and Sancha of Castile. Her maternal grandparents were Alfonso VII of Castile and Berenguela of Barcelona. Her eldest brother Sancho VII of Navarre succeeded their father as king of Navarre, and was the last male descendant of the first dynasty of Kings of Navarre, the Pamplona dynasty, dying childless. Her brother Ramiro of Navarre was Bishop of Pamplona, and her elder sister Berengaria of Navarre married Richard I of England and Aquitaine, the northern neighbour of their kingdom.\n\n[edit] Life Blanca married Count Theobald III of Champagne, who died young in 1201, leaving her pregnant. When she gave birth to a son, he immediately became count Theobald IV of Champagne (1201-53). Blanca ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 in 1222. The regency was plagued by a number of difficulties. Blanca's brother-in-law, count Henry II had left behind a great deal of debt, which had not been paid off when Theobald III died.\n\nFurthermore, their son Theobald IV's right to the succession of Champagne was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful Champagne nobles. The conflict with the Briennes broke into open warfare in 1215, in what became known as the Champagne War of Succession, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time Theobald and Blanca bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Blanca had also arranged the dowry of Henry II's elder daughter Alice of Champagne, when she married the young Hugh I of Cyprus. In the 1230s, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to Louis IX of France.\n\nBlanca also took over administration of the kingdom of Navarre when her brother Sancho VII went into retirement (\"El Encerrado\"). Blanca died in 1229, her brother in retirement remaining as King of Navarre and her son Theobald continuing as Count of Champagne. Their eldest sister, Berengaria of Navarre, Queen of England, died without issue in 1232, leaving Sancho as the sole surviving child of Sancho VI. When he died in 1234, Blanca's son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognised as the next King of Navarre. Theobald had married twice during Blanca's lifetime, but had not succeeded in producing children by the time of her death. However, he later had children by his third wife.\n\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanca_S%C3%A1nchez_of_Navarre\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanca_Sánchez_of_Navarre\n\nBlanca Sánchez of Navarre From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n(Redirected from Blanca of Navarre (daughter of Sancho VI)) For other persons of this name see Blanca of Navarre (disambiguation).

Blanca had also arranged the dowry of Henry II's elder daughter Alice of Champagne, when she married the young Hugh I of Cyprus. In the 1230s, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to Louis IX of France.\n\nBlanca also took over administration of the kingdom of Navarre when her brother Sancho VII went into retirement (\"El Encerrado\"). Blanca died in 1229, her brother in retirement remaining as King of Navarre and her son Theobald continuing as Count of Champagne. Their eldest sister, Berengaria of Navarre, Queen of England, died without issue in 1232, leaving Sancho as the sole surviving child of Sancho VI. When he died in 1234, Blanca's son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognised as the next King of Navarre. Theobald had married twice during Blanca's lifetime, but had not succeeded in producing children by the time of her death. However, he later had children by his third wife.\n\nMi nuevo libro, LA SORPRENDENTE GENEALOGÍA DE MIS TATARABUELOS está ya disponible en: amazon.com barnesandnoble.com palibrio.com.
