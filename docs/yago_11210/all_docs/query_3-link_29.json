She was also the lover of Brother Landry and Mother to Landry's daughter Eve.\n\nJoan was only a year old when she became Queen Regnant of Navarre and Countess of Champagne after her father's, Henry I of Navarre untimely death. When Joan was about two or three, her mother Blanche of Artois decided to take her to Paris to seek protection in the court of her mother's cousin, King Philip III of France, as Navarre was under threat of invasion from its neighbours."
