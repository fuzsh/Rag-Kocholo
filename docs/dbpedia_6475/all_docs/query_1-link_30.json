        "text": "*The parliamentary difference between a joint session and a joint meeting has evolved over time. In recent years the distinctions have become clearer: a joint session is more formal and occurs upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution; a joint meeting occurs when each legislative body adopts a unanimous consent agreement to recess to meet with the other legislative body.\n\nMeetings listed date from the present back to 1993. For a complete list back to 1789, consult the Joint Sessions and Meetings, Addresses to the Senate or the House, and Inaugurations (GPO-govInfo)(PDF) table in the Congressional Directory."
