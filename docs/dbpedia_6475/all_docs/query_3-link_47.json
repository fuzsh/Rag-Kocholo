        "text": "What is a “red state,” and what does it mean for a Presidential Election? If a state is a “red state,” the voters within that state primarily vote for the Republican Party. The term is also used to describe a state that is perceived to have conservative views. Blue states vote Democratic and tend to have more liberal views. This means that red states believe in a smaller, deregulated government and have an aversion to rapid change. Red states desire to preserve the political philosophy and regulations articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and preserve traditional morality, such as that in the Bible.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the colors were reversed, red states were Democratic while blue states were Republican. During the U.S. Presidential Election in 2000, journalist Tim Russert used the terms “red state” and “blue state” based on the colored maps used during his televised coverage of the election. Since that election, the media have used red for Republican and blue for Democrats.\n\nThe Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) shown in the table below is a measurement of how strongly a United States congressional district or state leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party compared to the national average. For example, if the national average is 48% Republican, and the Republican candidate of a state wins 57% of the two-party share, then that state voted nine percentage points more Republican than the country. The PVI for that state is R+9.\n\nAccording to Gallup Daily tracking numbers in 2017, a total of 13 states are solid Republican. Those states are Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Three additional states lean Republican: Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri. Out of these states, some are considered to be “dark red” because they lean more Republican than the other states. This includes Wyoming, the most conservative state in the United States, with a PVI of R+25. These “dark red” states can also include Utah (R+20), Oklahoma (R+20), West Virginia (R+19), and Idaho (R+19).\n\nIs Florida a red state?\n\nYes. Florida was once considered a battleground state but is now leaning Republican after Donald Trump won Florida in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

Florida’s CPVI is R+3.\n\nIs North Carolina a red state?\n\nNo, while North Carolina leans Republican, it is considered to be a perennial swing state and a swing state in the 2020 presidential election. North Carolina has voted for the Republican presidential candidate ten times in the last 12 presidential elections.

Wisconsin has a CPVI of R+2.\n\nIs Indiana a red state?\n\nYes, Indiana has long been considered to be a Republican stronghold. Indiana has a Republican governor and Republican majorities in the Indiana General Assembly. Only five Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900. Indiana’s CPVI is R+11.\n\nIs Arizona a red state?\n\nArizona is considered a deep red state; however, it turned blue in the 2020 presidential election, voting for Joe Biden. Arizona has voted Republican in every presidential election in 1976 except in 1996 and 2020. Arizona has a CPVI of R+3.\n\nIs Louisiana a red state?\n\nYes, Louisiana is a red state. Louisiana has voted Republican in every presidential election since 2000 by a fairly large margin. Additionally, four of the six U.S. Representative seats and every statewide office, except for the governor, are held by Republicans. Louisiana’s CPVI is R+12.\n\nIs Nevada a red state?\n\nNevada is not a red state; it is a swing or battleground state. Since 1976, the state has voted Republican six times and Democratic six times, including the last four presidential elections. Nevada has an even CPVI.\n\nIs Tennessee a red state?\n\nYes, Tennessee is considered a safe red state.
