        "text": "Overview\n\nSince 1972, there have been 10 different Libertarian Presidential nominees, in 12 elections. (Two candidates were nominated twice.) In 1972, the LP's first Presidential candidate John Hospers received the first and only electoral vote in the party's history when one \"faithless elector\" voted for him. The first candidate to break the one percent mark was Ed Clark in 1980. This remained the best showing both as a percentage and in raw number of votes until 2012, when Gary Johnson became the first candidate to receive more than one million votes (but just shy of one percent). Running again in 2016, Gary Johnson then beat the previous record by both measures by a wide margin, receiving more than three percent and more than four million votes.\n\n1972 Presidential Election\n\nIn 1972, the Libertarian Party was barely organized and was still in its infant stage. The Presidential nominee was John Hospers. The Vice-Presidential nominee was Tonie Nathan. The ticket was only on the ballot in 2 states and received one electoral vote from a faithless elector Roger MacBride in Virginia.\n\n1976 Presidential Election\n\nBy 1976, the party had started to organize and was able to mount a more solid campaign for president. The nominee was Roger MacBride, the same faithless elector who voted for John Hospers in the last election. The Vice-Presidential nominee was David Bergland. The pair managed to gain ballot access in 32 states and was able to gain more than 100,000 votes, a milestone for the relatively new political party.\n\n1980 Presidential Election\n\nThe 1980 Presidential Election was another major milestone for the Libertarian Party. The Party nominated Ed Clark for President and David Koch for Vice-President. The campaign was largely self-financed and was able to run several national television advertisements. The ticket gained ballot access in all 50 states. In Alaska, the ticket gained 11.66% of the vote.\n\n1984 Presidential Election\n\nAt the 1984 National Convention, many Libertarians walked out, leading many to suspect the end of the party was near. As a result of the walkout, David Bergland was nominated for President and Jim Lewis was nominated for Vice-President. The ticket had ballot access in 36 states.\n\n1988 Presidential Election\n\nIn a nomination contest that featured candidates with very different backgrounds and styles, and was also seen by some as a choice between presenting a \"right\" or \"left\" image, former Congressman Ron Paul was selected over American Indian activist Russell Means as the Presidential nominee for 1988. Andre Marrou, one of the few Libertarians who had been elected to a state legislature, was the Vice-Presidential nominee. The campaign raised over $2,000,000 and was on the ballot in 46 states.\n\n1992 Presidential Election\n\nFor the 1992 Election, the previous vice-presidential candidate and former Alaska legislator Andre Marrou was nominated as the Presidential Candidate. Nancy Lord was nominated as the Vice- Presidential Candidate. The ticket gained ballot access in all 50 states.[1]\n\n1996 Presidential Election\n\nHarry Browne was the Presidential nominee in 1996 and his running mate was Jo Jorgensen. Partly due to personal financial support by the candidate, the campaign was able to get on the ballot in all 50 states.\n\n2000 Presidential Election\n\nHarry Browne was re-nominated as the Presidential nominee in 2000 but chose Art Olivier as his running mate. The campaign had some controversy surrounding it after the National Director was found to have worked on the campaign in 1996 before Harry Browne's candidacy had been decided. The campaign nearly got on the ballot in all 50 states again but a split with the Arizona Libertarian Party caused Harry Browne to be replaced on the ticket with another Libertarian.\n\n2004 Presidential Election\n\nAt the 2004 Convention, the Presidential Nomination Election was very close. The race was between Michael Badnarik, Gary Nolan, and Aaron Russo. All three candidates were within 2% of each other for the first two ballots. However, Michael Badnarik made a surprising comeback and won the nomination. In a separate nomination, Richard Campagna was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee. During the election cycle, Badnarik raised over $1,000,000 and ran national television ads on CNN and Fox news. The ticket gained ballot access in 48 states but didn't gain access in New Hampshire or Oklahoma.\n\n2008 Presidential Election\n\nBob Barr was nominated as the Presidential nominee in 2008 with Wayne Allyn Root nominated as the Vice-Presidential Candidate. The Barr campaign was expected to do very well but due to several factors such as Sarah Palin's nomination as McCain's VP, Ron Paul's dropping of his endorsement of Barr, and the campaign's lack of advertising. The campaign still raised nearly $1.4 million dollars but didn't get as many votes as many Libertarian Leaders felt it could have. The ticket was on the ballot in 44 states. Barr returned thereafter to the Republican Party.\n\n2012 Presidential Election\n\nGary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico, was nominated in 2012, with Jim Gray as his running mate. The ticket was on the ballot in all but two states, and became the first to receive more than one million votes, and the first to break the record for that measure set 32 years earlier by Ed Clark.\n\n2016 Presidential Election\n\nGary Johnson was nominated again in 2016, this time with William Weld as his running mate. This was seen by some as the LP's most \"credible\" national ticket ever, with both candidates being former governors, but others saw the inclusion of Weld as a dilution of the party's brand. For the first time since 2000, the LP had a presidential ticket on the ballot in all 50 states. In an election that was very close between front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but with many voters unhappy about that choice, the LP's team achieved a record-breaking three percent of the national vote, receiving the votes of almost 4.5 million people. William Weld was a controversial candidate due to a past broken promise with the Libertarian Party of New York and certain policy positions, particularly on gun control. During the campaign, he stated that \"he was here to vouch for Hillary Clinton\" causing some Party members to view that as an endorsement of an opponent. In 2019, Weld broke his promise that he would never switch to another party and re-registered with the Republican Party.\n\n2020 Presidential Election\n\nDr. Joanne \"Jo\" Jorgensen, Harry Browne's former running mate in 1996, was nominated as the LP POUTS candidate at the 2020 National Convention. Her running mate was Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen. The 2020 LP Presidential ticket achieved 50 state ballot access for the second consecutive cycle in the party's history. The ticket could be described as a unifying ticket as Jo was a more moderate and pragmatic candidate to Spike's radical presentation, though both are self proclaimed anarchists. The campaign was divided along the POUTS and VPOTUS teams, who worked separately to cover more geographic area in the United States. One of the major factors in this campaign was the use of a touring bus to be able to consolidate travel expenses, and easily organize and mobilize the teams across state lines. A major controversy among the membership that occurred with this campaign was the perceived alliance with the Black Lives Matter Organization. Dr. Jorgensen has been quoted saying \"It is not enough to be passively not racist, we must be actively anti-racist.\". Variations of this quote have been adopted across the Libertarian lexicon numerous times since.\n\nPresidential preference primaries\n\n1988\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNorth Dakota held an open primary on June 14th with candidates of all parties on one ballot.\n\nCandidate Votes Percentage Ron Paul 985 2.25%\n\n1992\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHeld on Feb. 18th.\n\nCandidate Votes Percentage Notes Andre Marrou 3,388 100% Marrou received 100% of the Libertarian ballot votes(3,219), 99 Republican write-ins, and 70 Democrat write-ins.\n\nNebraska\n\nHeld on May 12th.\n\nCandidate Votes Percentage Andre Marrou 32 96.97% Write-In 1 3.03%\n\nCalifornia\n\nHeld on June 2nd.\n\nCandidate Votes Percentage Andre Marrou 15,002 99.92% Write-ins 12 0.08%\n\n1996\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHeld on Feb. 20th.\n\nCandidate Votes Percentage Notes Harry Browne 653 40.48% Browne also received 1 write-in vote in the Republican primary.
