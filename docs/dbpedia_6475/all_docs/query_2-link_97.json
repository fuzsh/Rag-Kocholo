Mr. Biden, whose margin in Arizona is currently about 11,000 votes, or 0.3 percentage points, is the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since President Bill Clinton in 1996.

Voters also passed recreational marijuana legalization — which failed narrowly in 2016 — and were set to decide on an education tax. — Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Jennifer Medina, Eileen Sullivan and Hank Stephenson Read less"
