        "text": "North Dakota joined the Union in November 1889, one of four states admitted in the first part of that month, the busiest period of new-statehood creation in U.S. history. North Dakota has participated in 33 presidential elections, voting Republican in 27 of them, including all 14 since 1968. Of the five times it went “blue,” only 1916 (Woodrow Wilson’s second-term victory) was not a nationwide landslide for the Democratic candidate. (North Dakota's first election as a state was won by a 3rd party candidate). Today, North Dakota is a very safe state for the Republicans in presidential elections. In 2020, Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden by a 65% to 32% margin. The state’s population of about 673,000 is little changed from what it was in 1920. As a result, North Dakota is one of six states with the minimum three electoral votes."
