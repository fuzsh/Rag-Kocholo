        "text": "Electoral Map: Blue or Red States Since 2000\n\nAs the 2016 election cycle approached, the electoral map had become pretty predictable. All but 10 states had voted consistently Democratic or Republican for (at least) the prior four consecutive presidential elections. For the GOP, this represented 179 electoral votes. The Democratic states, comprising 242 electoral votes had all actually gone blue since 1992 - six straight elections. Further highlighting this polarization: While relatively competitive overall, only four states (FL, NC, OH, VA) were decided by less than 5% popular vote margin in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nSame Since 2000: After 2020 Election\n\nThe last two elections have seen five states and a district in Maine break their same party streaks. To win in 2016, Donald Trump broke through some of the 'blue wall' of 242 electoral votes that had voted Democratic in each presidential election since at least 1992. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and one district in Maine voted Republican in 2016.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden won Georgia and Arizona, states that had last voted Democratic in 1992 and 1996, respectively.\n\nAll five of the aforementioned states were decided by 1% or less in the year (2016 or 2020) they came off this map.\n\nNote that the next image reflects the electoral map as of 2024. Had there been no changes, Democrats would have 195, Republicans 152. To see what's changed, click the image. On the resulting URL, usee the '2020' or 'Change' buttons above the map"
