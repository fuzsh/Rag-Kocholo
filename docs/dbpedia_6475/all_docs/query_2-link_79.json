        "text": "Introduction\n\nNOTE: The following is presented for informational purposes only. NCSL does not provide advice on how to conduct a recall campaign in any state. For the specific procedures to be followed in any state, please contact your state's election officials.\n\nIn the 19 states that allow recall elections, citizens can attempt to remove an elected official from office at any time. Typically, the recall process consists of gathering a certain amount of signatures on a petition in a certain amount of time. Beyond this, details of the recall process vary by state. The following information explains these processes and provides a list of each state's laws governing the recall of state officials.\n\nOverview\n\nRecall is a procedure that allows citizens to remove and replace a public official before the official’s term of office ends. Historically, recall has been used most frequently at the local level. By some estimates, three-fourths of recall elections are at the city council or school board level. This webpage, however, focuses on the recall only as it applies to state officials. For more information on state laws on local recalls, see Local Recalls.\n\nRecall differs from another method for removing officials from office—impeachment—in that it is a political device while impeachment is a legal process. Impeachment typically requires a state legislature’s lower chamber to bring specific charges, and the upper chamber to act as the jury in an impeachment trial. In contrast, in most of the 19 recall states specific grounds for recall are not required, and the recall of a state official is accomplished through an election.\n\nNineteen states plus the District of Columbia permit the recall of state officials:\n\nRecall of State Officials\n\nAlaska\n\nIllinois\n\nNew Jersey\n\nArizona\n\nKansas\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nCalifornia\n\nLouisiana\n\nOregon\n\nColorado\n\nMichigan\n\nRhode Island\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nMinnesota\n\nWashington\n\nGeorgia\n\nMontana\n\nWisconsin\n\nIdaho\n\nNevada\n\nSource: National Conference of State Legislatures\n\nAll these states lay out the right to recall elected officials in their constitutions, with the exception of Montana, where the right to recall is found only in state statutes. Additionally, each recall state except Illinois and Rhode Island further explains its recall processes in state statutes. A full citation list of these laws is below.\n\nCurrently, only these 19 states allow recall elections of statewide elected officials, but other states have recently considered establishing recall procedures. Between 2015 and 2019, legislatures in several states considered bills that would allow for recall elections of state and local officials. For example, in 2017 and 2018, recall election legislation failed to pass the New York and West Virginia legislatures, and legislation that would have allowed recall of state legislators failed to pass the Illinois General Assembly. In 2019, legislation that would have provided for recall of any elected official in Connecticut failed to pass the General Assembly. Also in 2019, the Oklahoma House of Representatives introduced a bill that would allow citizens to petition for the recall of any elected official in the state.\n\nVirginia has a process that is similar to recall, but it is not listed here as a recall state because its process, while requiring citizen petitions, calls for a recall trial rather than an election. In Virginia, after a petition containing the required number of signatures is verified, a circuit court decides whether a Virginia official will be removed from office. In the recall states, the voters decide in an election.\n\nRecall of Local Officials\n\nIn at least 30 states (some sources place this number at 38), recall elections may be held in local jurisdictions.\n\nProcess\n\nHow the Recall Process Works\n\nThe recall process varies in its details from one state to another, but in general, recall campaigns follow these steps:\n\nFile an application to circulate a recall petition (some states allow petitions only if they contain certain grounds for recall).\n\nCirculate a recall petition and gather a specified number of signatures in a specified period of time (view the detailed petitioning requirements).\n\nSubmit petitions to election officials for verification of signatures.\n\nIf enough valid signatures are presented, hold a recall election.\n\nGrounds for Recall\n\nIn most of the recall states, any registered voter can begin a recall campaign for any reason. The language in Michigan's constitution is typical of most states: “The sufficiency of any statement of reasons or grounds ... shall be a political rather than a judicial question.” (Const. Art. II §8) Indeed, recall campaigns are often politically motivated. For example, in 2011, Republican senators in Wisconsin faced recalls for supporting the governor's effort to reduce the influence of public employee unions, and in Arizona, a senator faced recall for sponsoring a controversial immigration bill.\n\nSpecific grounds for recall are required in only eight states:\n\nAlaska: Lack of fitness, incompetence, neglect of duties or corruption (AS §15.45.510)\n\nGeorgia: Act of malfeasance or misconduct while in office; violation of oath of office; failure to perform duties prescribed by law; willfully misused, converted, or misappropriated, without authority, public property or public funds entrusted to or associated with the elective office to which the official has been elected or appointed. Discretionary performance of a lawful act or a prescribed duty shall not constitute a ground for recall of an elected public official. (Ga. Code §21-4-3(7) and 21-4-4(c))\n\nKansas: Conviction for a felony, misconduct in office, incompetence, or failure to perform duties prescribed by law. No recall submitted to the voters shall be held void because of the insufficiency of the grounds, application, or petition by which the submission was procured. (KS Stat. §25-4301)\n\nMinnesota: Serious malfeasance or nonfeasance during the term of office in the performance of the duties of the office or conviction during the term of office of a serious crime (Const. Art. VIII §6)\n\nMontana: Physical or mental lack of fitness, incompetence, violation of oath of office, official misconduct, conviction of certain felony offenses (enumerated in Title 45). No person may be recalled for performing a mandatory duty of the office he holds or for not performing any act that, if performed, would subject him to prosecution for official misconduct. (Mont. Code §2-16-603)\n\nRhode Island: Authorized in the case of a general officer who has been indicted or informed against for a felony, convicted of a misdemeanor, or against whom a finding of probable cause of violation of the code of ethics has been made by the ethics commission (Const. Art. IV §1)\n\nVirginia: Neglect of duty, misuse of office, or incompetence in the performance of duties when that neglect of duty, misuse of office, or incompetence in the performance of duties has a material adverse effect upon the conduct of the office, or upon conviction of a drug-related misdemeanor or a misdemeanor involving a \"hate crime\" (§24.2-233)\n\nWashington: Commission of some act or acts of malfeasance or misfeasance while in office, or who has violation of oath of office (Const. Art. I §33)\n\nSource: National Conference of State Legislatures, May 2019\n\nIn 2012, Michigan passed a law requiring that a recall petition must clearly and factually state the reason(s) for the recall, which must be based on the elected official's conduct during his or her term of office (M.C.L. §168.951A). This differs from the specific grounds required in some other states, as Michigan’s new requirement will not necessarily eliminate politically-motivated recalls. For example, under this Michigan law a voter could initiate a recall against a legislator on the political grounds that the legislator voted against an issue the voter supports. As long as that allegation is stated clearly and factually, it would presumably meet this new criteria.\n\nCirculating a Recall Petition\n\nThe recall process is similar to the ballot initiative process in that it requires the submission of citizen petitions. The number of signatures necessary to trigger a recall election, however, is often significantly higher than the number required for ballot initiatives. The required number of signatures is generally equal to a percentage of the vote in the last election for the office in question, although some states base the formula on the number of eligible voters or other numbers. These requirements can be demanding and are listed in the table below.\n\nRequirements for Circulating a Recall Petition\n\nWho Can Be Recalled\n\nSignature Requirement\n\nCirculation Time\n\nSource: National Conference of State Legislatures, May 2019\n\nThe Recall Election\n\nIn seven states, the election for a successor is held simultaneously with the recall election.\n\nIn all recalls in Colorado and in all recalls except for local officers in California, the ballot includes two questions. The first question is whether the official should be recalled. Voters are then asked to vote for a candidate for the office. The official who is the subject of the recall may not be among the listed candidates. If a majority votes \"yes\" on the recall question, then the incumbent is recalled and the successor is elected via the second part of the ballot. If a majority votes \"no\" on the recall question, the incumbent remains in office and the second portion of the ballot is moot.\n\nIn the other states using the simultaneous model (Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota and Wisconsin), the submission and certification of the recall petition essentially triggers a special election for the office, and the recall ballot consists of a list of candidates for the office. The name of the official who is the subject of the recall may appear on the ballot along with other nominees. In fact, in Arizona, Michigan, North Dakota and Wisconsin, the name of the official being recalled is automatically placed on the recall ballot for reelection unless the official resigns from office.\n\nIn the remaining 12 states and in local recalls in California, the recall ballot contains only the question of whether the official should be recalled. If the majority votes for recall, the office is declared vacant and is filled at a special election or as otherwise provided by law, which in some states is by appointment for the remainder of the term. The chart below details how the recall election is conducted in each state.\n\n1) In these states, the recall ballot consists of a list of candidates for the office held by the person against whom the recall petition was filed. The name of the officer against whom the recall was filed may appear on the ballot for re-election.\n\n2) In these states, the recall ballot consists of two parts. The first asks whether the officer against whom the recall petition was filed should be recalled. The second part consists of a list of candidates who have qualified for the election. In California, this does not apply to recalls of local officers. Note that courts in both states have ruled that a voter's choice of candidate on the second part of the ballot must be counted regardless of whether the person cast a vote on the recall question first.\n\n3) The governor appoints a successor who must be a member of the same political party as the recalled officeholder, and must be selected from a list submitted by a committee of the political party of the person recalled.\n\n4) If vacancy occurs within 85 days of the general election in the second year of the term (terms are four years), the county board of commissioners appoints a successor to serve until the election.\n\n5) County board of commissioners appoints a person from a list submitted by a committee of the political party of the person recalled."
