        "text": "The years 2009 and 2010 mark the 140th anniversary of woman suffrage in the United States. Wyoming passed the first woman suffrage law on December 10, 1869, and women voted for the first time in 1870. The word suffrage comes from the Latin word suffragium, meaning the right to vote.\n\nWomen in the United States had fought for suffrage since the time of Andrew Jacksonâs presidency in the 1820s. Before the Civil War, women were allowed limited voting in a few states. New Jersey allowed women to vote before their stateâs constitution outlawed it in 1844.\n\nIn 1869, Congress passed the soon-to-be-ratified 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which gave all men the right to vote. The amendment didnât mention women. While the federal government didnât give women the right to vote at that time, it was still possible for individual states to pass womenâs suffrage laws.\n\nRailroads and Rights\n\nThat same year, the transcontinental railroad was completed, connecting the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific rail lines. This may seem like it has nothing to do with women being allowed to vote, but it was actually very important.\n\nThousands of workers had come to the American west to work on the railroad. As the population grew, Congress decided to split off a piece of land in the Dakota, Idaho, and Utah territories to create the Wyoming Territory. In May 1869, the same month that the Union Pacific Railroad was open to the public, President Ulysses S. Grant named John A. Campbell the new governor of Wyoming Territory .\n\nThe first elections were held in Wyoming Territory in September 1869. William H. Bright, President of the Council of the Wyoming Territorial legislature, introduced a woman suffrage bill in the legislatureâs first session. The bill sailed through the Democratic legislature and was quickly signed by the Republican governor .\n\nThe law reads:\n\nFemale Suffrage\n\nChapter 31\n\nAn Act to Grant to the Women of Wyoming Territory the Right of Suffrage, and to Hold Office\n\nBe it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Wyoming:\n\nSec. 1. That every woman of the age of twenty-one years, residing in this territory, may at every election to be holden under the laws thereof, cast her vote. And her rights to the elective franchise and to hold office shall be the same under the election laws of the territory, as those of electors.\n\nSec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\n\nApproved, December 10, 1869.\n\nWhy Wyoming?\n\nYounger states and territories like Wyoming were more willing to consider fresh ideas about who could vote. Still, people were a little surprised. Wyoming passed the first woman suffrage law in the United States, with almost no discussion or controversy.\n\nThere were several reasons why the bill was passed so quickly. Historian C. G. Coutant wrote, âOne man told me that he thought it right and just to give women the vote. Another man said he thought it would be a good advertisement for the territory. Still another said that he voted to please someone else, and so on.â\n\nMany legislators voted for the bill hoping to increase the territoryâs population. Women were scarce out west, and perhaps men were acting desperately to entice them. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 said territories could apply for statehood once the population reached 60,000. âWe now expect at once quite an immigration of ladies to Wyoming,â wrote The Cheyenne Leader, a local newspaper.\n\nOne politician claimed womenâs suffrage started as a joke. Edward M. Lee, a secretary in the Territory in 1869, wrote, âOnce, during the session , amid the greatest hilarity, and after the presentation of various funny amendments and in the full expectation of a gubernatorial veto, an act was passed Enfranchising the Women of Wyoming. The bill , however, was approved, became a law, and the youngest territory placed in the van of progress . . . How strange that a movement destined to purify the muddy pool of politics . . . should have originated in a joke . . . All honor to them, say we, to Wyomingâs first legislature!â\n\nEven though some treated his bill as a joke, William Bright took suffrage very seriously. Mrs. Bright later said that her husband, a Southerner who fought on the Union side in the Civil War , believed that if all men could vote, then there was no reason why his own wife and mother could not vote as well.\n\nWilliam Bright wrote in the Denver Tribune, âI knew it was a new issue, and a live one, and with strong feeling that it was just, I determined to use all my influence.â\n\nSome legislators voted for the bill because they believed it didnât have a very good chance of passing. William Bright took advantage of this opinion. In 1882, Governor John W. Hoyt explained how William Bright cleverly played both sides against each other:\n\nâHe said to the Democrats: âWe have a Republican Governor and a Democratic Assembly. Now, then, if we can carry this bill through the Assembly and the Governor vetoes it, we shall have made a point, you know; we shall have shown our liberality and lost nothing. But keep still; donât say anything about it.â They promised. He then went to the Republicans and told them that the Democrats were going to support his measure, and that if they did not want to lose capital they had better vote for it too. He didnât think there would be enough of them to carry it, but the vote would be on record and thus defeat the game of the other party. And they likewise agreed to vote for it. So, when the bill came to a vote, it went right through! The members looked at each other in astonishment, for they hadnât intended to do it, quite. Then they laughed, and said it was a good joke, but they had âgot the Governor in a fix.â So the bill went, in the course of time, to John A. Campbell, who was then Governor âand he promptly signed it!â\n\nAfter the bill passed, the Wyoming Tribune wrote that it âis likely to be THE measure of the session , and we are glad our Legislature has taken the initiative in this movement, which is destined to become universal. Better appear to lead rather than hinder when a movement is inevitable.â\n\nOf woman suffrage in Wyoming, American civil rights activist Susan B. Anthony said happily, âWyoming is the first place on Godâs green earth which could consistently claim to be the land of the Free!â Telegrams came in from as far away as Britain and Prussia.\n\nJudge and Jury\n\nThe woman suffrage bill not only gave women the right to vote, but also to sit on juries and to run for political office. In February 1870, three women were commissioned as justices of the peace in Wyoming, although only one, Esther Morris, was known to have actually served as a judge . She tried more than forty cases in the territory. She lost none on appeal and was widely regarded as a good judge , but wasnât nominated for re-election when her term ended.\n\nThe first women jurors began their service in March or April of 1870. In T. A. Larsonâs A History of Wyoming, the author writes that male jurors stopped smoking and chewing tobacco once women began to serve alongside them. Men stopped gambling and drinking during their jury breaks.\n\nWomen in general were more likely to find someone guilty than men would, gave tougher prison sentences, and were less likely to accept self-defense as a reason for murdering a person. Women proved they had the ability to serve as members of the jury . They took their duties seriously, but not everyone approved women jury members. Newly elected judges banned women from jury duty in 1871.\n\nWomen Vote"
