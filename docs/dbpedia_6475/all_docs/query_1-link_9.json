        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nThe 2020 presidential election was decided by a handful of states, none closer than Arizona, where President Biden's margin of victory was fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThe close race meant that Arizona became ground zero for lies that the election was stolen and illegitimate.\n\nStephanie Sy has this update on what's happened since.\n\nStephanie Sy:\n\nIn the last four years, the integrity of Arizona's election system has sustained repeated attacks from conspiracy theorists and allies of former President Trump.\n\nOne of its staunchest defenders is an elected Republican, Stephen Richer, who, as recorder, oversees voter registration and mail-in ballots in Maricopa County. His pushback to election deniers angered many in his own party. And, last week, he lost the GOP primary as he sought a second term.\n\nStephen Richer joins me now.\n\nRecorder Richer, thank you for joining the \"News Hour.\"\n\nYou have faced death threats for your vocal defense of democracy in the 2020 election, yet you decided to run for a second term. And, of course, last week, you lost in the primary to a candidate backed by election deniers. How did you take that? And does it mean the election fraud lies are still dominating the GOP as we head into this next election?\n\nStephen Richer (R), Maricopa County, Arizona, Recorder: It's still a significant portion of the conversation, and there's certainly still a lot of people who believe inaccurate information about the 2020 election and the 2022 election. So there's a lot of work to be done.\n\nI'm going to continue doing it to the best of my abilities over the next five months. And I would love to instill confidence in the process in as many people as possible before I head out. But I'm sad to be leaving my team, to be leaving this important office, but I'm also very excited to be able to move on from some of the unpleasant parts that you mentioned and to try a new adventure.\n\nStephen Richer:\n\nOh, I haven't made any determination as far as that. I don't know how he would govern or how the Democrat running in this race would govern.\n\nMy focus is going to be on the next four months in ensuring that we deliver a fair, lawful, transparent 2024 general election. And then it will be in someone else's hands to steer the office forward. And that, of course, could take a different approach. And if it's unlawful, then people will sue. And if it's not as good, then maybe people will look back fondly on some of the transparent things that we did.\n\nStephen Richer:\n\nTo keep doing what I have been doing throughout this past three-and-a-half years, and we have put so much effort into explaining this process.\n\nWe have done livestreams, we have done tele-town halls, we have done virtual tours of our facility, we have done over 200 tours of our election facility. It's my sincerest wish that the average Arizona and feel good about the election in terms of how it's administered, feel confident in the results. And we're going to keep working towards that with the only weapon that we have at our disposal, which is more and more information.\n\nAnd so we will keep doing that. And I just really hope that there are enough people out there who can still be convinced by facts and logic.\n\nStephen Richer:\n\nI certainly won't be actively helping, and I haven't decided how I'm going to vote yet.\n\nBut as I have said before, I am a long time Republican, but there are a number of comments and actions that the former president has made with respect to my office that have given me great pause and have had some very negative effects for the people working here in my office and for election administration throughout the country.\n\nThose are unacceptable in my book. And so it's an election that's causing me great anguish as a long time Republican voter."
