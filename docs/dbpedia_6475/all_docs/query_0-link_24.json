I will try and avoid making changes even if they turn out to be wrong, for the sake of seeing how well I predict the future. Hopefully I do well! Please feel free to comment on your thoughts of how accurate these predictions are, whether you're a Democrat or Republican. Hearing and interacting with other people's opinions makes me happy!\n\n2028 United States Presidential Election (Dark Brandon) is under construction. Therefore, please excuse its informal appearance while it is being worked on. We hope to have it completed as soon as possible. Thank you.\n\nNote: Please do not edit or alter this page unless you have permission from the pages' author(s).\n\nSome minor grammar and spelling fixes are allowed if you find any errors of the type.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This page is in need of serious repair so forgive me for the unclear GOP nominee at this point in time\n\nThe 2028 United States presidential election was the 61st quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 7, 2028. The Democratic ticket of incumbent president Kamala Harris and incumbent vice president Tim Walz defeated the Republican ticket of Louisiana governor Jeff Landry and Nevada governor Joe Lombardo while also defeating former President Donald Trump and his running mate, former general Michael Flynn who ran as a third party ticket for the Patriot Party after Trump failed to receive the republican nomination. This was the first election in which the Republican ticket included someone who was non-white. This was the first election in which 52 states participated, marking the first participation of Puerto Rico and the first participation of District of Columbia (officially the Douglass Commonwealth) as a state, rather than under its special inclusion in presidential elections per the 23rd Amendment. This became the only presidential election in American history where the threshold for victory was 273 electoral votes.\n\nIncumbent Democratic President Joe Biden, who was age 85 at the time of the election, was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the 22nd Amendment. The Democratic primaries were marked by a sharp contest between Whitmer and the original frontrunner, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris held an early lead in most national polls among likely Democratic primary voters, a string of upset victories by Whitmer in New Hampshire and Nevada propelled her into the lead after Super Tuesday, and she received a narrow majority of delegates. She became the presumptive nominee in June 2028. Whitmer chose incumbent Arizona senator Ruben Gallego as her running mate.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, having been imprisoned since early 2025, ran for President a fourth time. However, after suffering a series of stinging defeats to multiple candidates in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Trump's primary campaign collapsed. With Donald Trump faltering, and many loyal Trump voters feeling leaderless, numerous Republican candidates attempted to ascend in his wake, but no candidate was able to take a commanding lead. The \"MAGA vote\" representing between 30-40% of the GOP electorate became splintered between over half a dozen different candidates. The Republican primary ended with no candidate receiving a majority of delegates, resulting in a brokered convention, the first occurrence of such an event in the modern era of the presidential primary system, and the first contested convention since 1952. On the 15th ballot, former South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley emerged victorious with a majority of delegates. Many attributed her victory to the desire of Republican delegates loyal to the party establishment for an \"electable\" candidate with \"a more positive and inclusive vision of conservatism.\" Haley chose incumbent Nevada governor Joe Lombardo as her running mate.\n\nAfter Nikki Haley secured the Republican nomination, Donald Trump and his far-right conservative allies declared that the \"Republican Party has gone woke,\" interpreted by many as dog-whistle sexism and racism to criticize the GOP's choice of a Indian female nominee. While many had believed Donald Trump would forgo a run for the Presidency as a third party candidate in exchange for a pardon by Haley, his convictions on multiple state felony charges, and no possibility of pardons from New York or the Georgia Board of Pardons made such a promise worthless. Trump became the nominee of the Patriot Party, a far-right political party that he previously vowed to create if he were to not win the Republican nomination in 2024, and campaigned fiercely against both Whitmer and Haley, attacking the so-called \"corrupt uniparty\" and the \"woke deep state.\"\n\nTurnout in this election fell significantly from the previous election, but was still relatively elevated compared to elections in the pre-Trump era, being higher than every election from 1968-2016. Support for minor party candidates also dipped to its lowest percentage since 1984; with three candidates on the ballot, and the two major parties nominating someone other than Biden and Trump, many voters were drawn to choosing one of the three candidates.\n\nThe central issues of the campaign included the size and role of the federal government in the economy, with Biden's second-term domestic agenda including the passage of the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which created a public option, under intense controversy; immigration issues were also a major issue, with Republicans in state legislatures across the country sparking backlash against the passage of the Immigration Modernization Act; LGBT rights, including those relating to transgender persons and their access to gender-affirming care; access to abortion, after Biden's power struggle with the Supreme Court over the passage of the Abortion Rights Act in 2025, and Nikki Haley's opposition to nationwide abortion legalization; another issue was the rising tensions with Iran over their development of nuclear warheads and other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Republican split enabled Whitmer to win 39 states and a landslide victory in Electoral College with just 49.8% of the vote, the lowest percentage of the vote for a successful Democratic presidential nominee since Bill Clinton in 1996. Whitmer ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 473 electoral votes, while Haley received 57, and Donald Trump received 13, making it the most lopsided electoral college landslide since Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984. Whitmer won the popular vote by approximately 17.8%, only 0.4% behind Ronald Reagan's 18.2% victory in 1984, which translated to a margin of roughly 27 million raw votes, the largest raw vote margin in history. Whitmer's victory was the largest for any Democrat in both the electoral college and the popular vote since President Johnson's re-election in 1964. She won every state carried by Joe Biden in 2024, and carried every state won by Obama in 2008 (with the exception of Maine's 2nd congressional district, mainly due to Maine's use of ranked-choice ranking), including the states of Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and Florida, as well as a number of states not won by a Democrat for generations, including Missouri and Louisiana for the first time since 1996, Montana for the first time since 1992, Mississippi and South Carolina for the first time since 1976, and Kansas for the first time since 1964.\n\nDonald Trump emerged with a plurality of votes in two states: Alabama and West Virginia, making this election the first time since George Wallace's victories in the Deep South during the 1968 election that a third party candidate managed to win electoral votes. However, Donald Trump's performance in the popular vote was not as strong as Ross Perot's 18.9% of the vote in 1992. Tim Scott suffered the worst defeat for a Republican in the popular vote and the electoral college since Barry Goldwater's landslide loss to President Johnson in 1964. Haley was able to salvage two symbolic victories in Alaska and Maine's 2nd congressional district, in which Whitmer finished ahead of Haley with a plurality, but Haley won after the vast majority of votes for Trump, who came in third place, were transferred to Haley through those states' ranked-choice voting system.\n\nBackground[]\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.\n\nSince 1964, the electoral college had consisted of 538 members, which was derived from the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 100 senators, and 3 seats for the District of Columbia under the 23rd amendment. However, in 2025, Congress passed two bills granting statehood to the District of Columbia (officially the Douglass Commonwealth), as well as Puerto Rico. Shortly after, Congress passed the 28th amendment, a conditional repeal of the 23rd amendment. While the District of Columbia's addition to the Union did not change the number of electors from 538, as it was already included in the electoral college, Puerto Rico was apportioned 2 senators, and 4 representatives, without taking away from other states' House delegations, making the total number of electors 544, and the threshold to win 273.\n\nIf no candidate receives the minimum 273 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nTwo states used ranked-choice voting (RCV) in the 2028 election, those states being Maine and Alaska. Gretchen Whitmer won three out of the four electoral votes of state of Maine with an outright majority of votes, and Greg Abbott won Alaska and Maine's 2nd congressional district with a majority of votes. On December 18, 2028, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government. The newly elected Congress, with Vice President Harris in her role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes on January 6, 2029.\n\nSimultaneous Elections[]\n\nThe presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives and kept control of the Senate.\n\nNominations[]\n\nDemocratic Party[]\n\n‹ 2024 2032 › 2028 Democratic Party presidential primaries February to June 2028 Nominee Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Home state Michigan California New York Electoral vote 2,170 1,219 - States carried 47 8 1 Popular vote TBD TBD Percentage 48.1% 33.2% Nominee Wes Moore Gavin Newsom Home state Maryland California Electoral vote - - States carried 0 0 Percentage - - 3,774 delegates to the Democratic National Convention\n\n1,888 delegates needed to win\n\nSince Joe Biden's first term in office, Kamala Harris had long been the frontrunner in most polls for 2024 among Democratic voters that did not include Joe Biden, and after Biden's successful re-election, she remained in that position. However, she was never able to achieve a majority of support, opening up the possibility for a successful challenger.\n\nNumerous center-left Democrats entered the race for President, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the only significant member of the more left-wing part of the Democratic Party to enter the race for President. With the specter of Donald Trump in the race for President for a fourth time, Democratic voters were once again keenly focused on \"electability.\" While Joe Biden remained popular among nearly all Democratic voters, boosting Harris' chances, she was viewed by many as unappealing to the necessary swing voters in the Midwest. As one Democratic operative put it, \"Sure, Kamala is pro-worker, pro-middle class. Sure, she's gonna pass policies that make people's lives better. But how the hell are you gonna convince someone in Pittsburgh or Detroit that some former prosecutor from uber-liberal San Francisco who spent four years in the Senate blowing hot air in the Judiciary Committee and then spent eight years doing absolutely nothing in the Vice Presidency is the best hope for their future and for their pocketbooks?\"\n\nWhitmer ignored the first state, South Carolina, as it was obvious that Kamala would win a state where a majority of Democratic primary voters are black. She campaigned heavily in New Hampshire, where her Midwest bona vides matched with the electorate, and Nevada, where her popularity with culinary unions was unmatched, having been chiefly responsible for the repeal of Michigan's right-to-work law. Harris won the South Carolina primary with her overwhelming support with black voters, but Whitmer finished in a strong second place, boosting her momentum. Whitmer swept Harris in Nevada, New Hampshire, and later in her home state of Michigan.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, despite many of the states favoring Harris due to their high populations of black voters, Whitmer took the lead over Harris in delegates, and won the critical state of Texas. After Super Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez officially dropped out of the race, leaving only Harris and Whitmer. Whitmer rode to victory in numerous states outside the south in the weeks just after Super Tuesday, most significantly in Florida. After Whitmer's defeat of Harris in the Wisconsin primary, she became the presumptive nominee.\n\nPrimary Schedule[]\n\nState/Contest Date Winner 2nd place 3rd place 4th place 5th place South Carolina Feb 5 Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Wes Moore Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gavin Newsom Nevada Feb 8 Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gavin Newsom Wes Moore New Hampshire Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Gavin Newsom Wes Moore Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Michigan Feb 25 Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gavin Newsom Alabama March 7\n\n(Super Tuesday) Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez American Samoa Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Arkansas Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Colorado Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Maine Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Massachusetts Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Minnesota Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez North Carolina Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Oklahoma Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tennessee Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Texas Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Utah Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Vermont Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Virginia Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrats Abroad March 7-14 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Georgia March 14 Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Idaho Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Mississippi Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Missouri Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Washington Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Arizona March 21 Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Florida Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Illinois Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Kansas Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Ohio Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Louisiana March 25 Kamala Harris Gretchen Whitmer Wisconsin April 4 Gretchen Whitmer Kamala Harris Kamala Harris drops out of the race; Whitmer becomes presumptive nominee All other races April-June Gretchen Whitmer\n\nWhitmer nominated Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego as her running mate, making him the first Latino candidate on a major party ticket.

While Trump was prosecuted and charged for falsifying business records, taking classified documents, and for election interference in Georgia, he was never prosecuted for charges of sedition and insurrection, preventing a legal ban from his running for public office again under the 14th amendment. Shortly after the 2026 midterm elections, which resulted in another significant underperformance by the Republican Party, Trump entered the presidential race for the fourth time in a row.\n\nDuring the lead-up to the 2024 GOP primary, Donald Trump consistently led in nearly all public polls of Republican voters, but in the 2028 race, his polling fell drastically. While many GOP voters still reported favorable opinions of Trump himself, many were weary of losing a third presidential election in a row.\n\nIn 2026, Joe Biden and congressional democrats' successfully passed the Immigration Modernization Act, the most significant immigration reform since the 1960s that allowed a full path to amnesty and citizenship for most immigrants at the southern border. The bill resulted in an eruption of backlash from conservatives, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, whose state covers roughly half of the Mexican-American border, made a name for himself by vociferously resisting the federal government's execution of the new law.\n\nBy 2027, Greg Abbott had taken a small, but commanding lead in most polling, with roughly 40% support, and Donald Trump at 30%. While Vivek Ramaswamy, a candidate in the 2024 election, remained popular, his ideological overlap with Donald Trump kept his polling tampered down.\n\nAbbott remained the most well-funded candidate in the election, but pursued a more localized campaign strategy. Most Republican strategists believed that if Donald Trump were to lose in just the first two states of Iowa and New Hampshire, his aura of being supposedly unbeatable would collapse, and he would be the \"Emperor Without Clothes\" as one Abbott surrogate noted. With Abbott already popular among evangelicals for his hard line on abortion and transgender persons, Abbott invested in ground-game operations in the state of Iowa, but did not campaign there himself nearly as much as other candidates. Abbott instead went to New Hampshire and \"camped out,\" traveling to nearly every small town and engaging with voters on a retail basis.\n\nAbbott defeated Donald Trump in Iowa by a margin of 45% to 30%, and one week later, defeated Trump in New Hampshire by a narrow 40% to 36%. With Trump's campaign collapsing, Vivek Ramaswamy, who had all but dropped out of the race, re-entered in Nevada, and finished 2nd behind Trump. Tim Scott, having also resurged in the wake of Trump's collapse, won his home state of South Carolina. Vivek Ramaswamy won his first primary in the early state of Michigan. By Super Tuesday, all other minor candidates, such as former Florida governor Ron DeSantis and former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, dropped out of the race. While Donald Trump remained on the ballot in the Super Tuesday states, he only polled between 15-20% in most states. Abbott won nearly every delegate-rich state on Super Tuesday, with Ramaswamy winning in more northerly states. By late April, Abbott became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party.\n\nAbbott selected South Carolina senator Tim Scott as his running mate, making Scott the first non-white Republican candidate for President or Vice President. They were officially nominated at the Republican National Convention in July 2028.\n\n2028 Republican Party ticket Tim Scott Joe Lombardo for President for Vice President United States Senator from South Carolina\n\n(2013–2028)\n\nGovernor of Nevada\n\n(2023–)\n\nGeneral Election[]\n\nIssues[]\n\nRole of the Federal Government[]\n\nEarly into Joe Biden's second term, Democrats were able to break the legislative filibuster in the Senate with 51 votes, opening up the possibility of passing the most vexing and ambitious parts of Joe Biden's agenda that had previously been unable to pass with a 60-vote threshold. Most of the legislation passed by the Democrats in 2025 that did not involve any changes in taxes or spending was widely popular in public opinion polls, such as bills relating to voting rights, election law, gun control, and abortion. However, with bills that involved new taxes or spending, the public was closely divided.\n\nJoe Biden's three most important landmark pieces of domestic economic policy legislation in his second term were the American Families Investment Reconciliation Act of 2026 (which was nearly a copycat of the previously failed Build Back Better Act) the Affordable Health Care for America Act, also known as BidenCare, which lowered the Medicare age to 60 and established a government-funded Medicare-equivalent healthcare insurance option for all Americans, and the Social Security Fairness Act, which eliminated the income cap on Social Security taxes. While they remained popular with a narrow majority of Americans, they were funded by the most significant increases in taxes, mostly on the wealthy, since the Johnson administration. It created a major backlash amongst large sections of the American public who disliked increases in the size of the federal government.\n\nWhile inflation remained near the historical mean during Joe Biden's second term, thwarting a popular Republican attack on government spending, the most salient issue of the 2028 campaign was still of spending and the federal government's role in American life.\n\nAbbott campaigned on a message of reining in \"reckless, out of control tax-and-spend liberals.\" He promised to repeal Joe Biden's domestic agenda, cut spending on entitlements and discretionary spending through the privatization of multiple government programs, and send money to states through a series of block grants to fund healthcare and other services.\n\nWhitmer, on the other hand, campaigned on the success and narrow popularity of BidenCare, and promised to improve the programs by making them more cost-efficient and responsive. In order to stand out in the Democratic primary, she also proposed the negative income tax, which would provide a de facto guaranteed universal basic income for all people below a certain threshold. She campaigned heavily on that promise in the general election, too, bringing in the support of many low-income voters. Whitmer also focused her economic message on voters' optimism about the state of the economy. She touted her agenda as governor of Michigan, having passed landmark legislation to improve infrastructure in her state.\n\nImmigration[]\n\nIn Biden's second term, the Democratic controlled Congress was able to pass the Immigration Modernization Act after the repeal of the Senate filibuster. The law included a pathway for over 15 million immigrants to gain a pathway to amnesty and citizenship within the United States. While the bill included many Republican amendments, such as enhanced border security, immigration courts, labor restrictions, and drug enforcement, it created a major backlash within conservative parts of America.\n\nAbbott, being the governor of the state with the largest section of the border, ran afoul of the federal law, using his own state law enforcement to track down immigrants, even those who had legally entered through the new system. Abbott used the national guard to post new checkpoints in areas around the southern border, even in places deemed unnecessary by the Department of Homeland Security. He also encouraged the Texas Legislature to nullify parts of the federal law to restrict immigrants' access to public services, housing, labor, and roadways. Abbott's hard-line on immigration as Governor of Texas has been widely seen as the key factor in his success at winning the Republican nomination in 2028 against Donald Trump and his other opponents.\n\nWhitmer, on the other hand, voiced her support for the Immigration Modernization Act, and campaigned on proposals to tweak the Department of Homeland Security, and various provisions of the act to be executed more efficiently. She criticized Abbott for \"dehumanization\" of immigrants from Central America, and called on Congress to craft policy that would help Central America proper, so that people in those countries would not be desperate to travel to America.\n\nAbortion[]\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, abortion remained a top issue for Americans throughout the 2020s in every election cycle, both in midterm elections and in presidential elections. In 2025, Congress passed the Abortion Rights Act, after the repeal of the legislative filibuster, and it was signed by President Biden. However, in early 2026, the law was struck down by the Supreme Court through an initial injunction order. Biden and congressional Democrats began threatening to expand the court if the court ruled against the law, which, in the words of Biden, be a \"direct assault on the American people and their democratic power to elect their representatives to change the laws they want to be changed.\" In a shocking decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Texas v. Jones, with Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh writing a joint opinion and joining the three liberals, that Congress has the power to prevent states from banning abortion, but also ruled that Congress has the power to fully ban all abortions throughout the 52 states and territories, even if a state's own laws protect it. The ruling also stated that states could still implement their own restrictions and barriers to abortion.\n\nWhile abortion became legal permanently throughout the 52 states after the summer of 2026, it still remained a top issue for voters in the midterm election and the 2028 election. Greg Abbott, who was the governor of the state that had served as the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case and had signed multiple bans on abortion. He was also notorious for comments made after the Dobbs ruling in which he defended Texas' ban on abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest by stating that the state's goal would be to eliminate rape, so that no woman would have to get an abortion because they were raped. By 2028, it was clear to nearly all Republicans that conservatives' stance on the issue of abortion was resulting in major electoral failures, having lost the presidency and both Houses of Congress in 2024, and failing to win either chamber back in the 2026 midterm elections. Greg Abbott attempted to soften his stance on abortion, attacking liberals for \"extorting\" the court, but avoiding any reference to a full national ban on abortion. In most public messaging, he stuck to a message that he would appoint more Supreme Court justices that would \"follow the Constitution as written, and this will sort the abortion issue out for itself.\"\n\nWhitmer, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of staunch support of for the right to abortion. As the Governor of Michigan, she had successfully campaigned for Michigan's Proposition 3, which codified the right to \"Reproductive Freedom\" including the right to abortion through viability. She also signed a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Michigan legislature that repealed Michigan's 1931 law that banned abortions. She promised to veto any law passed by a future Congress that repealed the Abortion Rights Act, and promised to continue federal funding of abortions. She also promised to nominate Supreme Court justices that would overturn the Dobbs decision. In her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, she said that \"I will nominate Supreme Court justices that uphold our Constitution, but our Constitution is a living document, a document that grows stronger over time, a document that has given men and women across America more rights. It is a sacred document that promises that we, the people, will continue to grow America into that more perfect union, and yes, the right to reproductive freedom is a part of that more perfect union.\"\n\nForeign Policy[]\n\nWhile domestic policy remained the cornerstone of the 2028 campaign for President, foreign affairs occasionally made its way into the campaign. Two issues were the most salient in 2028: Rising tensions with China and more importantly, Iran's successful development of nuclear weapons in the year 2027.\n\nBoth candidates consistently presented themselves as tough-on-China, and committed to a policy of deterring China's expansion across the globe, especially in East Asia. Greg Abbott touted his agenda as the Governor of Texas to counter Chinese influence within the United States, including his state's extreme restrictions on Chinese foreign nationals' ability to acquire land. On the other hand, Whitmer focused her China policy more on the trade and economics side, touting her agenda as Michigan's governor to try to revive the industrial Midwest and keep America competitive with China. Polls showed that most voters found China to be an adversary worthy of concern, but neither candidate was favored by any statistically significant margin by voters most concerned about China.\n\nMore concerning for voters in the 2028 election was Iran's completion of their development of nuclear weapons/weapons of mass destruction in the year 2027, which resulted in a destabilization of the Middle East. While Iran did not immediately use their nuclear weapons for any attack or invasions, nor did the number of terrorist attacks against the countries of Saudi Arabia or Israel increase within the first 2 years, it created mass hysteria among most of Iran's neighbors. Different alliances, including those intertwined with Israel and the United States began to come apart as fears of retaliation from the Iranians created a \"chilling effect.\"\n\nRepublicans across the country placed blame on the Biden administration for Iran's development of nuclear weapons on their watch, while Democrats placed blame on Donald Trump for scrapping the Iran Nuclear Deal of 2015, and dislodging the United States from its previous position of strength to negotiate. Republicans had originally planned on making a nuclear Iran a top issue of the 2028 general election campaign because it was expected that Vice President Harris would be the Democratic Party nominee for President. However, with Whitmer on the ticket instead, it made placing blame much more difficult.\n\nDebates[]\n\nAfter the 2024 election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump featured no general election debates, for the first time since 1972, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which had served as the main vehicle for debates since the 1988 election, was disbanded.\n\nDifferent news organizations began making bids with the two major parties starting in 2027 for organizing general election debates. The Democratic Party refused any cooperation with the Fox News Channel for a general election debate, and the Republican Party refused any cooperation with MSNBC, and its parent company, MSNBC.\n\nThe Democrats and the Republicans agreed first on two debates, the first hosted by PBS, and the other by ABC. The Democrats refused cooperation with CNN, after complaints over its coverage of Donald Trump in the 2024 election, but agreed to allow CNN to air the debate if the event was officially hosted by a third-party organization. The AARP, the American Association of Retired Persons, offered to host a town hall-style debate with questions mainly coming from senior-citizens on questions relating to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs for elderly people. The Democrats agreed to this proposal in exchange for a second town-hall style debate, also officially hosted by CNN, with questions coming from college students and other young voters. This brought the total number of debates to four, the most ever in a general election. The Vice Presidential debate was agreed to be hosted by CBS, after the negotiations were completed for the presidential debates.\n\nFirst Debate[]\n\nThe first debate was held at Arizona State and moderated by Amna Nawaz of PBS News. Most of the questions were related to domestic policy, with both candidates asked questions about their plans for healthcare in the wake of the passage of the public option in 2026. Greg Abbott focused his message mainly on criticisms of President Biden for overspending and increasing the role of the federal government in the economy, and labeling Whitmer as a \"tax and spend\" liberal. Whitmer tied her message to Americans' increasing positivity on the economy, stating how she would be a president who would promote \"stability, growth, and fairness.\" The candidates were also pressed on the issue of abortion, with Whitmer in fierce opposition to any bans on abortion before fetal viability, while Greg Abbott positioned himself as a \"compassionate pro-life conservative.\"\n\nPolls of viewers showed that Whitmer was considered a narrow winner of the first debate. Many political commentators took note of the fact that this debate was the first presidential debate that didn't include Donald Trump since 16 years ago, and how it was a \"pleasing return to normalcy and civility.\"\n\nSecond Debate[]\n\nThe second debate was held in Tampa, FL, and was jointly hosted by CNN and the AARP. It was a town hall style debate, moderated by CNN's Kaitlyn Collins. The questions all came from voters of old age, and mainly focused on candidates' plans for Social Security and Medicare. Whitmer mainly focused her message on strengthening Social Security through higher taxes on the wealthy, and decreasing the cost of prescription drugs for seniors including cancer drugs and insulin. Abbott, on the other hand, focused his message on mainly false accusations of Whitmer of wanting to use the healthcare plans for seniors as a piggy-bank for younger Americans healthcare. He also accused Democrats' of defunding Medicare, which was slightly misleading, as Joe Biden had decreased the cost of Medicare by negotiating the cost of drugs, but didn't actually cut any benefits.\n\nViewers perceived Whitmer as slightly \"disconnected\" from the older voters asking the questions, while Abbott seemed more \"in touch\" with the people asking the questions. Polls showed that a small majority of voters thought Abbott won the debate.\n\nVice Presidential Debate[]\n\nThe Vice Presidential debate was hosted by CBS and moderated by Margaret Brennan. It featured the first ever debate of either presidential or vice presidential candidates in which neither one was white. Much like the first debate, questions mainly focused around issues of domestic policy, with a few questions about the United States' relationship with Iran and China mixed in. Questions also focused on the candidates' readiness to take office if something were to happen to the President. With the two candidates overshadowed by their running mates at the top of the ticket, it was not considered a consequential matchup.\n\nPolls after the debate showed a statistical tie between Gallego and Scott, with many viewers in focus groups saying they liked Scott's personality and positivity more than Gallego, who seemed more combative. However, viewers agreed more with Gallego on the issues, and found him to be more authentic, rather than talking from a memorized set of talking points.\n\nThird Debate[]\n\nThe third debate was also hosted by CNN, and moderated by Van Jones, a former Democratic operative, and S.E. Cupp, a former Republican operative. This debate was also a town-hall style debate, but questions were asked by younger voters, both in and out of college. Many of the questions related to the cost of attending college, and the increasing crisis of home ownership.\n\nPolls showed Whitmer as the clear winner of the third debate, with many voters saying that Abbott seemed derisive and angry when responding to younger voters, while Whitmer seemed calmer and more connectable.\n\nFourth Debate[]\n\nThe fourth debate was hosted by ABC News and moderated by David Muir. It was the only debate focused primarily on foreign policy. Questions mainly focused on the United States' increasing tension with China, but more importantly, Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. Whitmer focused on her work as the governor of Michigan to strengthen the manufacturing power of the Midwest to compete with China in new technologies, including electric vehicles and semiconductors. On the other hand, Abbott pressed blame on the Biden administration for failing to contain Iran, and not standing alongside Israel. Whitmer countered, by discussing how Donald Trump's actions in pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, which Abbott praised Trump for, were to blame for the crisis.\n\nPolls showed that viewers were evenly split on the winner of the fourth debate. The last debate had no real effect on national polls.\n\n13 Keys To the White House[]\n\nThe 13 Keys to the White House is a prediction system for determining the outcome of presidential elections in the United States. It was developed by American historian Allan Lichtman and Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981, adapting prediction methods that Keilis-Borok designed for earthquake prediction.\n\nThe system is a thirteen-point checklist that assesses the situation of the country and political system ahead of a presidential election: when five or fewer items on the checklist are false, the incumbent party nominee is predicted to win the election, but when six or more items on the checklist are false, the challenging party nominee is predicted to defeat the incumbent party nominee in the election.\n\nSome of the items on the checklist involve qualitative judgment, and therefore the reliability of this system relies heavily on the knowledge and analytical skill of whoever attempts to apply it. Using the system, Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcomes of every presidential election since 1984. Here is the result of the 13 Keys in 2016, in which Lichtman correctly predicted that President Harris would win re-election:\n\n# Key True/False 1 Midterm gains: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections. True 2 No primary contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination (nominee gets 2/3rds of delegates on 1st ballot). True 3 Incumbent seeking re-election: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president. True 4 No third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign. False 5 Strong short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. True 6 Strong long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. True 7 Major policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy. True 8 No social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term. True 9 No scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal. True 10 No foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. True 11 Major foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs. False 12 Charismatic incumbent: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. False 13 Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.
