        "text": "Two Republican candidates have dropped out of the primary since the Iowa caucus.\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy suspended his campaign late Monday night after finishing in fourth place. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced late Tuesday morning that he would quit the race, after placing sixth.\n\nWho came in fifth? A little-known Texas businessman and pastor named Ryan Binkley, who's still in the race.\n\nBinkley garnered 774 votes, amounting to 0.7% (a notch higher than Hutchinson's 0.2%). Chris Christie, who dropped out last week, got less than 0.1%.\n\nWhile there's no official ballot for the Iowa Republican caucus (and voters can vote for any candidate), the state GOP was tracking votes for all of the above.\n\nBinkley is the president and CEO of Generational Group (an investment bank and business advisory) as well as the co-founder and lead pastor of a church, both of which are located in Richardson, Texas.\n\nHe declared his candidacy in April 2023, with a solutions-focused campaign bent on restoring Americans' faith in God and each other. Top priorities listed on his campaign website include securing the border, rescuing the economy, transforming health care, revitalizing urban America and restoring unity.\n\nBinkley, 56, became the first Republican candidate to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties in early November (DeSantis accomplished the same feat in December).\n\nBut he did not qualify for any of the televised GOP debates or gain any traction in the polls. Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Polls put him at 0% in August, October and December, and 1% in January.\n\nBinkley told supporters on Monday night that he would continue to the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nAnd he quoted Elton John, who became just the 19th person to achieve EGOT status at the Emmy Awards that same night: “I’m still standing.\"\n\nKaroline Leavitt of New Hampshire became just the second Gen Z candidate — and first Republican — to win a House primary in 2022. Leavitt, a former Trump press staffer who amplified his false claims of a stolen 2020 election, ended up losing in the general election.\n\nNow a national spokesperson for Trump's political action committee, Leavitt doesn't believe the former president is facing a similar fate. She pointed to his landslide victory in Iowa as a sign of his momentum — and told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep that Trump is already focusing on the general election matchup against President Joe Biden.\n\n\"It's time for us to turn the page away from this Republican primary and move forward to focus on our ultimate opponent, which is Joe Biden and the Democrats,\" she said.\n\nShe said Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis don't have a practical pathway to the nomination, and said it is \"unfortunate\" that they didn't back out, as fourth-place finisher Vivek Ramaswamy did. She called on them to \"stop wasting millions of dollars, so we can take this fight to the Democrats.\"\n\nNPR's Franco Ordoñez, who covers the presidential campaign, says the Trump camp wants big wins in Iowa and New Hampshire to stop the momentum of its rivals — but faces an uphill battle in New Hampshire, where there are more independent voters (which is not where Trump tends to perform best).\n\nLeavitt says Trump will be holding campaign events in New Hampshire \"pretty much every single night\" before the primary on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has a busy schedule this week for other reasons, as another civil defamation trial against him by writer E. Jean Carroll is being held in New York. Leavitt confirmed Trump plans to be there, and made the case for his ability to balance those commitments.\n\n\"There is no one that has more tenacity and a greater work ethic than President Trump,\" she said. \"He arrived last night in New York at 3:30 in the morning, he's going to the courthouse this morning, and then he's on his way back to New Hampshire to give a raucous rally speech in front of a very large crowd.\"\n\nTrump, who is facing 91 criminal charges across four different cases, is expected to face a busy year of court proceedings. Leavitt accused Democrats of election interference by scheduling those trials during the presidential campaign cycle — though, as Inskeep points out, those judges and officials have not explicitly discussed the reasons behind those decisions.\n\n\"But it's not going to matter because people see right through it,\" Leavitt added. \"They believe in the president, and they want their lives to return to what they felt like under his leadership.\"\n\nLeavitt went on to argue that most Americans have concerns about election integrity, and repeated Trump's calls for paper ballots and same-day voting. She said voters should be able to learn election results the night they cast them.\n\nWhen asked if that would be feasible with paper ballots, Leavitt responded that \"we did it for hundreds of years before voting machines.\"\n\n\"America has done it for 200-plus years, actually, as a matter of fact, and many nations around this world do that as well and you hear their results in the exact same night,\" Leavitt said.\n\nInskeep added, \"When it's not close, that is.\"\n\nOrdoñez points out that the Republican Party expressed more openness to mail-in voting after the 2020 election, feeling that Democrats had gotten an advantage from early voting (dozens of election officials and court cases across the country have disproven Trump's claim of fraud).\n\nBut in recent months, he says, Trump has been pushing for a return to paper ballots and a single day of voting.\n\nTLDR: Yes, there is good polling, but these voters are new here, and there will be many more polls to come.\n\nWhen asked about young voters' decreasing support for President Biden in an interview with NPR’s Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition, Jack Lobel, national press secretary for the youth-run organization Voters of Tomorrow, argued that pollsters haven't been able to measure Gen Z's political attitudes yet accurately.\n\n\"A lot of these polls are conducted by the phone, and a lot of us don't really pick up the phone,\" Lobel said.\n\nTo back up for a second: just 9% of Gen Z and younger millennials (voters under 29) turned out in the Iowa caucuses last night, according to entrance polling.\n\nAnd while that minimal showing may be chalked up to several factors, questions remain over the larger political attitudes of Gen Z and younger millennials right now.\n\nNotably, young voters have overwhelmingly turned out and supported Democratic candidates over the past few election cycles.\n\nAnd while phone calls may be slightly passé to young people (and everyone), there's been noticeable dissatisfaction among this age group with President Biden in recent months — particularly over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAnd this recent polling (notably from the New York Times/Siena College Poll in December) shows a much closer match-up between Biden and former President Trump — especially when third-party candidates are in the mix, according to the recent biannual Harvard Youth Poll.\n\nPlus — while the December poll from The New York Times says surveys were conducted via phone, many surveys are also conducted online — notably, the Harvard Youth Poll — which focuses on young voters under 30.\n\nBut again — 2024 marks just the third presidential election in which Gen Z can take part. There will be many more polls.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis spent a lot of time in Iowa — in fact, he saw basically all of it by campaigning in all 99 counties.\n\n\"We’ve got our ticket punched out of Iowa,\" DeSantis told a crowd of supporters in the state last night.\n\nDeSantis, who made his campaign about fighting for anti-\"woke\" policies and against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, has been popular among conservatives for the past two years, but some of that appeal seems to be waning.\n\nBack in Florida, DeSantis hasn't proposed any new policies for the legislative session that started this month. Florida Republicans have split loyalties when it comes to DeSantis: high-profile Republicans in the state like Byron Donalds have clashed with the presidential candidate, and one congressman even changed his previous endorsement of DeSantis to Donald Trump.\n\nLynn Hatter, news director at member station WFSU in Tallahassee, Fla., says that while DeSantis' agenda may have resonated with voters in Iowa, his policies and personality may not resonate in New Hampshire next week, where there is a higher percentage of moderate Republicans and independent voters.\n\n\"Some people say he just doesn't present very well,\" Hatter told NPR's Michel Martin.\n\nThe similarities between DeSantis and Trump may also prove difficult for the governor going into next week’s caucus. DeSantis’ campaign is trying to appeal to Trump’s base, but that strategy doesn’t seem to be working for him.\n\n\"The former president's supporters just seem to like their guy better,\" Hatter said on Morning Edition.\n\nListen to the full story here.\n\nThe days leading up to last night's caucuses were filled with snowstorms, extreme wind chill, freezing temperatures — and a lot of worry about what the weather would mean for turnout.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, which take place in person, have traditionally not attracted many participants (which is one reason why many states opt for more accessible primaries).\n\nThe best-attended GOP caucus was in 2016, the last time Trump was on a contested primary ballot. A record 186,000 voters participated — but even that only amounted to some 25% of registered Iowa Republicans.\n\nTurnout was much lower this time around. Only about 110,000 Republicans participated (as of 1:30 a.m. ET, with 99% of results in). That represents less than 15% of the total number of registered Republicans in the state.\n\nHere's how that turnout number compares to previous contested GOP caucuses:\n\n2016: 186,743\n\n2012: 121,503\n\n2008: 118,411\n\n2000: 86,440\n\n1996: 96,451\n\n1988: 108,806\n\n1980: 106,051\n\nIt's hard to say how much yesterday's record cold played a role in keeping would-be voters home.\n\nIowa Public Radio's Sheila Brummer says that some people may have been eager to get out of the house after being stuck at home in snowstorms all week.\n\nNPR's Don Gonyea says while the cold weather may have dampened turnout, there's no reason to think that a greater turnout would have changed the results in any meaningful way.\n\nRegardless, last night's caucus was decided by a relatively small number of key voters — especially when you consider how much money GOP candidates spent on TV ads in Iowa.\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated that it comes out to $1,124 per person who showed up to vote.\n\nA year ago, Donald Trump was considered the Republican Party's favorite candidate for president, but it wasn’t clear that he would dominate the way he did in Iowa last night.\n\nFrank Luntz, a pollster who has worked with Newt Gingrich, attended eight caucuses last night. He told Morning Edition that last night, Trump voters were decided and passionate in their resolve for the former president.\n\n\"Trump voters are voting for him not despite what's going on in the outside world, but because of it,\" Luntz told NPR’s Steve Inskeep.\n\nWhile the voters he talked to last night were clear that the former president’s indictments and court appearances were not a problem for them, Luntz says Trump might have a harder time convincing the broader electorate that his legal troubles aren't a concern.\n\n\"The very thing that makes him so popular among Republicans turns off Democrats and a majority of independents,\" he said.\n\nAnd that is important to keep in mind as voters look towards the general election later in the year.\n\n\"In the end, just getting your base vote doesn't elect you,\" Luntz said.\n\nBoth President Biden and Donald Trump have a hard road ahead when it comes to convincing voters that they are the right candidate for the job, according to Luntz.\n\n\"We have two flawed likely nominees and an electorate who really doesn’t want a rerun of 2020,\" Luntz said.\n\nListen to the full story here.\n\nIowa Public Radio's Sheila Brummer spent caucus night at a precinct in Sioux City. She shared her observations with Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep today.\n\n\"What they do is they get a piece of paper, they write down the candidate's name, and then a precinct chair counts who got what,\" she explains of the process. \"And then they read it over a loudspeaker to everybody, so everyone knows before they leave how the precincts turned out.\"\n\nOutside, the temperature was six below. Brummer said she expected the weather to affect turnout, but saw the opposite — her site, at Western Iowa Tech Community College, actually saw 25% more people show up.\n\n\"It was a week of nasty weather: a couple of snowstorms, a blizzard, the coldest air in a long time, and I think maybe people just wanted to get out of the house,\" she explains.\n\nAfter talking to voters, Brummer says many wanted to get out to make sure their candidate was the one to be on the general election ballot in November.\n\nTrump supporters say he's been wrongly accused of the 91 criminal charges against him, she says, while supporters of DeSantis and Haley say the country needs someone without that baggage.\n\nListen to their full conversation here.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu used to joke that \"Iowa picks corn, New Hampshire picks presidents.\"\n\nThere is something to that last part: The winner of the New Hampshire primary has become the Republican presidential nominee in the last three open primaries and six of the eight primaries since 1976.\n\nIn the same period, only three of the Iowa caucus winners went on to become the presidential nominee: George W. Bush in 2000, Bob Dole in 1996 and Gerald Ford in 1976.\n\nA recent ABC News analysis found that in the half-century since the start of the modern primary system, the presidential candidates who won Iowa's caucuses failed to win the presidency 16 times, not including uncontested races.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, it's entirely possible to lose the Iowa caucus but still become the nominee and ultimately win the presidency.\n\nPresident Biden broke precedent, losing both Iowa and New Hampshire on his way to the White House. And the last three eventual GOP nominees all lost the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe real currency of the Iowa caucuses is momentum. How candidates perform, especially compared to expectations, can determine who still sees a viable path to the nomination.\n\nPoliticos like to say there are \"only three tickets out of Iowa\" — a nod to the fact that in the last five decades, the eventual presidential nominee has almost always finished the caucus within the top three.\n\nSince 1976, seven of the eight Republican nominees and eight of the last 10 Democrats were in the Iowa top three.\n\nOne person who wasn't surprised by last night's results is former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary.\n\nWalker emerged as an early front-runner in the GOP race, but suspended his campaign before the Iowa caucuses and called on other Republican candidates in the crowded field to do the same.\n\nHe served as governor until 2019 and is now the president of Young America's Foundation, a conservative youth organization.\n\nWalker told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep that last night's outcome was \"exactly what I expected,\" with an easy Trump victory and a close race for second place. And he thinks it's safe to say Trump will cinch the nomination, too.\n\nWalker predicts New Hampshire is likely Ron DeSantis' \"last stand.\" Even if Nikki Haley wins New Hampshire or comes close, he says, she's likely to lose her home state of South Carolina to Trump next month, as well as the other contests in March.\n\n\"It's not done yet, but it's pretty close,\" Walker says.\n\nTrump has made revenge and redemption central to his reelection campaign, as Inskeep points out. But Walker argues that most Republican voters are motivated not by Trump's election falsehoods, but by what he accomplished during his time in office.\n\nWalker says most Republican voters think DeSantis has done a solid job governing Florida and Haley was a good ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"So it wasn't attacks on them and preference that way over Trump,\" he adds. \"I think more than anything in the primary — and I would say even among some swing voters in states like mine — there's a feeling amongst voters that they're tired of politicians, of candidates, who say all the right things and then go to Washington and backtrack from the things they promised when they were campaigning.\"\n\nWalker believes Trump can be an effective president again if he focuses on the issues, particularly the economy, an area of top concern to young voters and one in which President Biden is seen as vulnerable.\n\n\"If he focuses on, 'Hey, life was pretty good when I was president, particularly before COVID, we can make that happen again. Here's our plan, in contrast with what's happening with President Joe Biden,' I think he's got a real shot, at least in battleground states like mine,\" Walker says.\n\nNPR political correspondent Susan Davis and White House correspondent Tamara Keith listened in on Walker's interview, and say he makes some valid points.\n\nDavis notes that young voters are an issue for the Biden campaign, with poll after poll showing a lack of enthusiasm from people age 18-35 about the state and future of the country, and Biden himself. Enthusiasm is an issue for both parties, she adds, and the question of how to get young people to the polls in 2024 looms large.\n\nKeith says the Biden camp acknowledges it has a problem with younger voters, as well as Black and Latino voters. Biden's campaign considers independent voters \"a persuasion target,\" she adds.\n\nThe week between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary is shaping up to be a busy one for former President Donald Trump — and not just because of campaign events.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll's second defamation case against him is expected to begin in New York today.\n\nCarroll first brought a civil lawsuit against Trump, alleging he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Trump was found liable last year and ordered to pay $5 million.\n\nIn June 2019, while Trump was president, Carroll published a book detailing the incident, which Trump denied, saying she \"is not my type.\" That's the defamation case scheduled for this week.\n\nThe trial is expected to last only a few days and wrap up no later than Monday, reporter Andrea Bernstein told Morning Edition.\n\nWill Trump be in the courtroom this week? He didn't attend the last Carroll trial, Bernstein says, but has said he wants to not only attend but testify at this one.\n\n\"His lawyers tried to get the trial postponed again, claiming he had to travel for his wife's mother's funeral, but after Carroll's lawyers pointed out he had a rally scheduled on one of the dates he wanted to be off for the funeral, the judge denied that request,\" Bernstein says.\n\nWhat could he say? The answer is contested by lawyers on both sides. Last week, New York district Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that \"the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused — indeed, raped — Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established,\" effectively blocking Trump's lawyers from arguing that he did not rape her.\n\nBernstein stresses that the question in front of the \"no-nonsense\" judge is not whether Trump did it, but how much money he will have to pay.\n\nThe last Carroll lawsuit saw a verdict within hours, she adds, so the answer could theoretically come right before the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday.\n\nTrump also faces having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for business fraud in a separate case, in which a verdict is expected later this month.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy ended his bid for president Monday night after a lackluster performance in the Iowa caucuses. The far-right, “America first” candidate was unable to break through in the Republican primary field despite attempting to set himself apart as the youngest major contender in the race.\n\nAt 38 years old, Ramaswamy often spoke about being a part of the millennial generation. Subsequently, he joined TikTok a few months back, arguing it was a necessary place to engage with young Republicans. (Young voters have largely voted for Democratic candidates in recent major elections, but about a fourth identify as Republican and more than a third identify as Independent.)\n\n“We’re in this to reach young people, to energize young people, and to do that, we can’t just hide,” Ramaswamy said in his first post back in September. “I care about the issues that affect not just millennials but Gen Z and all young people in this county. We have a generation of politicians that is badly out of touch,\" he added.\n\nRamaswamy focused many of his posts on campaigning in Iowa and doing explainer videos tailored to younger voters. He also did collaborations featuring controversial YouTuber and boxer Jake Paul.\n\nThe account has more than 357,000 followers.\n\nRamaswamy was the only major GOP presidential contender to have an official TikTok presence, while his former opponents publicly came out against using the social media platform.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary is exactly one week away.\n\nNikki Haley is expected to perform better there than in Iowa — and perhaps even win — given the state's more moderate electorate and semi-open primary, which includes unaffiliated voters.\n\nNew Hampshire Public Radio's Josh Rogers spoke to Morning Edition about what voters in the state are thinking as election season begins. Listen to that conversation here.\n\nHe notes that New Hampshire is among the least religious states in the country, and polling shows that most Republicans there support abortion rights.\n\nAnd Independents make up the bulk of the electorate. They gravitated towards Trump in 2016 (he won the primary that year), and are being courted heavily by Haley this time around.\n\n\"She'll probably need their backing to make things competitive here,\" Rogers says.\n\nRogers says Haley has been finding an audience there for her argument that the country needs a generational shift in conservative leadership.\n\nBy contrast, most Republican voters Rogers talks to see Trump's legal issues as \"not significant disqualifying factors.\"\n\nDeSantis, he says, has some \"hard-core support\" in the state, but not a broad audience — his New Hampshire campaign has felt like \"diminishing returns\" for months.\n\nRogers says New Hampshire voters are most concerned about issues like the economy, inflation, the cost of housing, foreign policy and to some extent, immigration.\n\nVoters curious about Haley, for instance, say they're attracted to what they see as her more traditional views on the U.S.' role abroad, Rogers says — whereas those who reject her often cite those same values as a concern, since it's at odds with Trump's \"America First\" vision.\n\nOne thing is clear from last night: The polls that showed Donald Trump with a significant lead in Iowa weren't wrong.\n\nThe fact that the AP called the race for Trump in just over half an hour \"confirmed that this was just Trump's night, and it put a big exclamation point on it,\" NPR's Don Gonyea reports this morning from Des Moines, where it's eight degrees below zero outside.\n\nHe says there are two other takeaways of note. For one, Republicans in Iowa are not bothered by the fact that their candidate of choice faces 91 criminal charges. And second, the cold weather did appear to put a damper on turnout — at least compared to the record set in 2016 — but wasn't likely to have made a huge difference.\n\n\"There's no sense here that greater turnout was going to change those numbers in any meaningful way,\" Gonyea says.\n\nWinning Iowa doesn't necessarily guarantee the presidential nomination, Gonyea points out. But he says Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are facing a steep comeback climb.\n\n\"In fact, it's a mountain,\" he adds.\n\nDeSantis placed second, which Gonyea says he needed based on all he'd invested in the state — visiting all of Iowa's 99 counties and securing the endorsement of its governor. Gonyea says DeSantis arguably needed a \"better second place than he got, but this gives him something to hang on to to fight another day.\"\n\nAs for Haley, Gonyea says she's likely at least a little disappointed given her recent rise in the polls, which suggested she could have finished second. But she was always expected to do better in New Hampshire, with its more moderate electorate.\n\nOne more notable development: The GOP primary field has narrowed, with Vivek Ramaswamy suspending his race after finishing fourth. Gonyea says those votes are likely to go to Trump — whom Ramaswamy endorsed — since they're running \"in the same lane.\"\n\nThe next few weeks will be crucial for the Republican presidential candidates as the primary gets into full swing.\n\nBy March 5, aka Super Tuesday, Republicans will have allocated almost half of their delegates. A week later, they'll be up to 54%. And 71% of delegates are set to be decided by the end of the month.\n\nAt the same time, former President Donald Trump's trials — over his handling of classified documents, alleged hush money payments and efforts to overturn the 2020 election results at the state and federal levels — will be gearing up.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump, the first former president to be federally indicted, faces 91 criminal charges in four different cases. His legal team has sought to delay them all until after the election.\n\nTrump's federal trial for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election is set to begin March 4, the day before Super Tuesday, after a judge rejected the defense's request this year to delay the case to 2026.\n\nThe trial's outcome and timeline are also notable because almost half of Republican voters have said they wouldn't support the former president if he is convicted of a felony, according to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nBut this primary calendar means there won't be a verdict in any of the multiple cases against Trump before the nominee is essentially decided.\n\nIn total, Trump faces four scheduled criminal trials, including a criminal trial in Georgia that prosecutors have proposed to begin on Aug. 5 — just weeks after the July 15-18 Republican National Convention.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIowa and New Hampshire, the first to states to hold their nominating contests, tend to produce different winners. There are a couple of factors that help explain that pattern.\n\nFor one, the people who vote in each of these early nominating states are very different.\n\nA majority of Iowa voters have historically been religious conservatives, more rural and more likely to consider themselves “very conservative.” Historically, about 6 in 10 Iowa Republican caucus-goers self-identify as white evangelicals or born-again Christians.\n\nNew Hampshire GOP primary voters, on the other hand, are more moderate and more likely to live in the suburbs.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe two states also vote differently, logistically speaking.\n\nIowa is a closed system, so only Republicans can participate. But independents are allowed to vote in New Hampshire's semi-open primary, which helps explain its more moderate electorate.\n\nUnaffiliated, or “undeclared,” voters make up about 40% of New Hampshire voters, so they can make a big difference.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary will take place on Tuesday, Jan. 23."
