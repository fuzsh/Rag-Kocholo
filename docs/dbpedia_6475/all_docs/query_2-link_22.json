        "text": "Amy Walter:\n\nThat's right. If you think about this from where we were when Biden was in this race, so in the pre-July 21 world, if we think about this as a contest, as a game, the contest was very lopsided against Biden.\n\nHe was behind by a significant number, not just at the national popular vote, but in those individual states, those individual battleground states. You can see almost six points in a state like Georgia and Nevada.\n\nNow, just in the time that Harris has been in the race, you have seen those numbers move pretty significantly toward Harris, again, four- or five-point shifts in those battleground states, which is mirroring what we're seeing in the national poll as well. It hasn't turned those states, though, from once that favored Trump to once that now favor Harris.\n\nIt just means now that the race is no longer as lopsided in Trump's favor as it was, say, in late July, as it is today, which is why we're calling this race a toss-up.\n\nAmy Walter:\n\nWell, I think the most important thing to talk about is what has happened in the three weeks since Kamala Harris got into this contest.\n\nIf you think about where we were before that, think about Republicans as a football team and they had every single member of their team on the field. And Democrats were a football team where maybe like 70 percent of their members were on the field.\n\nNow what's happened with Harris, the enthusiasm, the energy, the shots you showed from where she's campaigning in these battleground states means that both teams now have everybody on the field, which means this is a battle of inches, not of yards. They are both lined up. They're evenly matched teams, where it could be anything from a fumble from one side that wins the game to one candidate getting a surge at the end.\n\nBut I do think, look, the battle right now, it was in your piece that you introduced the show with. It's the battle to define the Harris/Walz ticket. They are not particularly well-known. Even the vice president isn't as well-known. The one benefit she is getting is I think a lot of folks assumed, because she was the vice president, she would come in with all the same baggage that Biden had.\n\nInstead, we have seen her favorable numbers shift 10 points in — more favorably than they were before then. She was much more tied to opinions of Biden than she is today. That's the good news for her.\n\nBut, as you can see, Republicans are trying to fill in those gaps themselves, calling her dangerously liberal. They have ads up going after her, specifically on things like the border, but also police reform and her opinions on some of those issues where she moved to the left in some cases during the 2020 campaign.\n\nSo I think, for the next, let's call it — more so after the — the DNC is where she gets a chance to tell her story. After that, it's still Republicans trying to make the case about who they would like voters to see her as.\n\nAmy Walter:\n\nThat's right.\n\nRemember when we were watching this dance of, is Biden going to stay and is Biden going to get out, and the number of candidates who started to come out? We saw that number start to ratchet up, especially in some of these states where voters knew that a decreased enthusiasm would mean that they too would find fewer voters coming and turning out.\n\nTheir overall numbers haven't changed. What has changed, I think, is that they feel more confident that the voters they know are already for them will show up. What they were worried about is that the voters who were for the Senate candidates were not excited about Biden, and so they may have stayed home."
