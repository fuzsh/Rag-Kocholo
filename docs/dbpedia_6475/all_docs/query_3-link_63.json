        "text": "In an opinion piece for the Washington Post published this evening, Welch wrote that “the stakes could not be higher.”\n\n“We cannot unsee President Biden’s disastrous debate performance,” Welch wrote. “We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night.”\n\nThe first-term senator said he is calling on Biden to withdraw “with sadness.”\n\n“Vermont loves Joe Biden,” Welch said. “President Biden and Vice President Harris received a larger vote percentage here than in any other state. But regular Vermonters are worried that he can’t win this time, and they’re terrified of another Trump presidency.”\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer, the longest-serving Democrat in Oregon’s House delegation, said, “President Biden should not be the Democratic presidential nominee.”\n\n“The question before the country is whether the president should continue his candidacy for re-election. This is not just about extending his presidency but protecting democracy,” he said in an emailed statement.\n\n“It is a painful and difficult conclusion but there is no question in my mind that we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.”\n\nBlumenauer, elected to Congress in 1996, will not be seeking reelection this year.\n\nBiden welcomed new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the Oval Office, saying he sees the U.K. as the “knot tying the transatlantic alliance together.”\n\nThe meeting on the margins of the 75th NATO summit in Washington follows the leaders’ phone conversation last week when Starmer took office.\n\nBiden praised Starmer for “seeking closer ties with Europe,” saying it would be good for the entire NATO alliance.\n\n“The special relationship is so important,” Starmer replied.\n\nThe two leaders engaged in a free-flowing conversation in the Oval Office, rather than delivering prepared statements. The leaders began with a jovial discussion of England’s soccer victory over the Netherlands, and Biden remarked that soccer is now more popular in the U.S. than ever before.\n\nBiden appeared to ignore a barrage of questions about his political future and doubts within his party about his reelection campaign. He responded to a question about Democratic donor and actor George Clooney calling on him to step aside by saying, “AFL-CIO, Go, Go, Go,” appearing to reference his appearance Wednesday morning with the union.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he’s not concerned about American commitment to the alliance if Trump is returned to the White House.\n\n“The United States is safer and stronger with NATO, and that’s why I expect it to remain in NATO,” he said, noting longstanding support for the alliance from former presidential administrations, particularly after it invoked its Article 5 mutual defense pact to support the U.S. following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nHe noted that bipartisan support for NATO among U.S. lawmakers remains strong, including among Republicans who are backing Trump. But even when it comes to Trump’s own complaints about NATO, Stoltenberg says those have been addressed.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned NATO’s relevance, suggested that he might withdraw from the alliance or, short of that, has threatened not to defend allies who do not meet the 2% defense spending commitments. Twenty-three of the 32 allies now meet their pledge to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense and most of the rest have plans to do so in the near future, he said.\n\n“The United States has been understood,” Stoltenberg said. “Allies have acted.”\n\nWhite is set to speak on Thursday next week before Trump addresses the GOP delegates.\n\nWhite’s appearance was confirmed by a Republican official familiar with the convention plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is friends with White and regularly attends UFC fights. Footage of his appearances often rocket around social media, which Trump’s campaign has acknowledged helps him reach out to people in nontraditional ways, especially young fans of the sport.\n\nAsked for comment on Clooney’s opinion piece, Biden’s campaign pointed to the president’s letter earlier in the week to congressional Democrats vowing to stay in the race.\n\nHis team also disputed the actor’s representation of Biden’s demeanor during the Los Angeles fundraiser, with campaign officials who attended the event pointing out that the president stayed for more than three hours at the event, despite just having returned from Europe.\n\nNew York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado joined a growing list of Democrats calling on Biden to end his presidential campaign.\n\nDelgado, a former New York representative, wrote in a statement published on social media that Biden deserves “eternal gratitude” for defeating Trump in 2020 and leading the country out of the coronavirus pandemic, but that Biden “can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign and making room for a new leader.”\n\n“There is no greater threat to our democracy than former President Donald Trump. He must be defeated. That’s is why I join with millions of Americans — including everyday New Yorkers from all walks of life — who are expressing legitimate concerns about President Biden’s ability to wage a successful campaign against Trump,” Delgado wrote.\n\nHis statement marked a significant break with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has emerged as one of Biden’s biggest supporters and surrogates. Hochul appointed Delgado to the role in 2022.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will be among those speaking at the Republican National Convention next week, according to a Republican official familiar with the convention plans who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nRamaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, was a political novice who fashioned his campaign after Trump, as a brash outsider from the business world. He quickly endorsed Trump after dropping out and has campaigned on his behalf.\n\nThe network said that Holt will interview Biden on Monday in Austin, Texas. Highlights will run on “NBC Nightly News” and the full interview will air during a prime-time special on NBC Monday night. A similar playbook was followed when Biden was interviewed last Friday by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos.\n\nBiden is stepping up the appearances following his performance during the debate with Trump, which has given rise to calls for him to end his campaign.\n\nAndy Schor, the mayor of Lansing, Michigan, said Biden’s Tuesday call with Democratic mayors lasted about 45 minutes. The president only took about three questions from the many mayors who had their hands raised before Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego ended the session, he said.\n\nBiden did not appear to be relying extensively on notes as he rattled off his plans to support cities and what he planned to do next. He said other mayors were concerned after the debate, but Schor left the meeting “impressed” by the president.\n\n“He’s going to be running, and I think that we all need to be supporting him,” Schor said.\n\nPoland President Andrzej Duda says he was glad to hear Biden’s speech to NATO leaders with a “very hard, very strong message.”\n\n“The part saying that Ukraine will defeat Russia, in the sense that it will not yield to Russia, that Russia will not win,” Duda, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, said Wednesday. “This is information as to the future U.S. policy, also within NATO, and also regarding support for Ukraine.”\n\nDuda said it will be the “duty and the privilege of the Americans to decide who will be the next president of the U.S.” He has also long expressed admiration for Trump and met with the presumptive GOP nominee in April.\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said that Biden has done an incredible job during the past four years, but it’s up to him to evaluate whether he remains the best candidate to beat Trump.\n\n“This election is about one thing and that is defeating Donald Trump,” she said. “Whatever the president decides I will be all in.”\n\nAsked if she thinks Biden can win, Healey said yes.\n\n“But again, that’s a decision that the president has to make about whether or not he wants to continue to be the one, to be the nominee to go forward,” she said.\n\nThe White House is sending Biden’s top advisers to speak with senators Thursday.\n\nThe move comes as Democrats in Congress have been worrying about their party and the ability of the man on top of their presidential ticket to win against Trump in November.\n\nNo Senate Democrat has yet called for Biden to step aside, but several have expressed serious concerns.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet said Tuesday he fears Biden could lose to Trump in a “landslide.”\n\nTrump says he’s “pretty well set in my own mind” on his choice of running mate. He dished on the finalists in a Fox News Radio interview Wednesday.\n\nIs Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s facial hair a strike against him? No, Vance “looks good. He looks like a young Abraham Lincoln,” Trump said with a laugh.\n\nWhat about the highly restrictive abortion law North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed into law? “Well, it’s a little bit of an issue. It’s a pretty strong ban,” said Trump.\n\nAnd what about the fact that Sen. Marco Rubio would likely have to move out of Florida? “No, but it does make it more complicated,” he said.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden hosted NATO spouses at the Smithsonian’s Museum of American History for a brunch of green goddess chicken and seared tuna.\n\nMore than 20 spouses, including Ukraine’s Olena Zalenska, also had a chance to see an exhibit featuring cultural objects such as Muppets and the ruby red shoes worn by Dorothy’s character in “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\nThe group is set to meet again Thursday at Camp David.\n\nThe first lady advised her counterparts to dress comfortably and wear flats or sneakers as they’ll be getting in and out of helicopters.\n\nFaith leaders from hundreds of Black churches in Georgia will gather to support Biden on Thursday.\n\nThe event at the Georgia State Capitol aims to turn the attention back to Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\n“Democrats have been fighting each other for the last two weeks, and it must stop now,” said Bishop Reginald Jackson.\n\nHe presides over 500 African Methodist Episcopal churches in the state and is one of the event’s organizers.\n\nBlack voter turnout will be key in Georgia, a battleground state.\n\nAn eighth Democratic member of Congress has publicly called on President Joe Biden to step aside, the New York Times reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan of New York said he no longer believed Biden could make the case necessary to defeat Trump.\n\nHe called Trump an “existential threat” to American democracy and said that he was asking Biden to drop out “for the good of the country.”\n\nIt comes as Democrats continue to wrestle with the extraordinary question of whether to stand behind the president or push him to bow out.\n\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Biden to leave the presidential race.\n\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race and any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\n“This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private,” wrote Clooney, who has hosted high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month.\n\nThe president of Finland says that regardless of whether Biden or Trump win the presidency in November, the U.S. will remain a superpower. That will require it to have strong allies — especially in Europe.\n\nAlexander Stubb said he is worried about the “polarization of the political climate,” calling it “quite toxic.”\n\nStubb spoke to reporters as he arrived at the NATO summit Wednesday.\n\nStubb also said there is “strong bipartisan support” for Ukraine and NATO, following a meeting with 15 U.S. senators.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ukraine is on an “irreversible” path to NATO membership.\n\nThat advances American assurances that Ukraine will be allowed to join the Western self-defense alliance after its war against Russia ends.\n\nAll 32 allies are expected to issue a joint communique Wednesday cementing that “irreversible” commitment to Ukraine. That’s according to a European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss before the release.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has battled for a firm guarantee Ukraine can join. The U.S. and some others have opposed to avoid an escalation with Russia that could lead to a larger war.\n\nFacing pressure from within his own party to abandon his reelection campaign, President Biden is relying on labor unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nThe 81-year-old Democrat is set to meet later today with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of trade unions.\n\nAfter meeting for around two hours to discuss whether Biden should remain at the top of their presidential ticket, Senate Democrats almost unanimously have agreed on one thing — not to say anything about it.\n\nInside the room on Tuesday, several Democrats expressed deep concerns about whether Biden can win. But no Democratic senators have said publicly that he should step aside, underscoring the deep bind that the party is in.\n\n▶ Read more about the democrats’ closed door meetings on Biden\n\nBiden welcomed NATO leaders to Washington yesterday by celebrating their unity against Russia’s Ukraine aggression and underscoring America’s ironclad commitment to the alliance under his watch — a message that seemed aimed at bucking up his own wobbly Democratic supporters as much as allies confronting the prospect of a return to the White House of NATO skeptic Donald Trump.\n\nHe’s been making his case on the campaign trail, in a defiant letter to Democratic lawmakers and now at an international summit that he’s still up for four more grinding years in the White House.\n\n▶ Read more about the NATO summit’s opening day\n\nPressure and chaos swirling since Biden’s disastrous debate performance is causing cracks inside a White House that until now has been marked mostly by discipline and loyalty.\n\nThe Biden White House has been mostly a restrained and staid operation, marked more by an insistence on showcasing policy rather than palace intrigue. But the president’s shaky debate performance has led to an unusually public blame game.\n\n▶Read more about the internal drama, leaks and second-guessing causing cracks in the White House\n\nPresident Joe Biden announces the U.S. and an array of other NATO allies will send Ukraine dozens of air defense systems in the coming months that Kyiv has been desperately seeking to help fight off Russian advances in the war.\n\nIn his 13-minute remarks, Biden, using a teleprompter, told world leaders gathered in Washington that “NATO is more powerful than ever” on its 75th anniversary, highlighting the expansion of the alliance under his watch.\n\nThe U.S. and an array of other NATO allies will send Ukraine dozens of air defense systems in the coming months, according to a new joint agreement that the president announced Tuesday.\n\n▶ Read more on the joint agreement, which Biden called, “a historic donation of air defense equipment for Ukraine”\n\nAfter days spent lying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public, Trump used his return to the campaign trail in Florida to revel in their disarray and ratchet up his attacks on both Biden and Harris, indulging speculation that she could replace the president as the Democratic nominee this year and alleging, without evidence, that his son Hunter Biden is “running our government” and first lady Jill Biden “is helping.”\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appeared in no rush, as much of the political world’s attention is still centered on questions about Biden’s ability to govern for another four-year term.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s return to the campaign trail\n\nWith tensions running high, House and Senate Democrats met privately yesterday as they wrestled over President Joe Biden’s reelection amid concerns over his ability to lead them to victory.\n\nLate Tuesday, a seventh House Democrat, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, publicly said Biden should not run for re-election.\n\nWhat could become a time for Democrats to bolster their president, instead fell deeper into crisis over real fears they could lose the White House and Congress and watch the rise of a second term Donald Trump.\n\n▶ Read more about the Democrats calling for Biden to drop"
