        "text": "A conviction for a felony suspends the rights of the person to vote (A.R.S. § 13-904) unless they have been restored to civil rights (Ariz. Const. Art. 7 § 2). First-time offenders have rights restored upon completion of probation and payment of any fine or restitution (A.R.S. § 13-907). A person who has been convicted of two or more felonies may have civil rights restored by the judge who discharges him at the end of the term of probation or by applying to the court for restoration of rights (A.R.S. § 13-908).\n\nPersons convicted of a felony shall be eligible to register to vote when they have:\n\na. Fully served their sentence of court-mandated calendar days or had their sentence discharged, including any term of incarceration, parole or supervision, or completed a period of probation ordered by any court.\n\nb. Received a commutation that reduced the sentence of any active felony conviction to time served pursuant to federal or state law and have no other outstanding sentence under any other felony conviction.\n\nc. Received a commutation pursuant to subsection F of Section 332.2 of Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes for a crime that has been reclassified from a felony to a misdemeanor and has no remaining time to serve, including:\n\n(1) Any incomplete term of incarceration.\n\n(2) Any remaining parole or supervision.\n\n(3) Any incomplete period of probation.\n\nd. Been granted a pardon pursuant to federal or state law and have no other outstanding sentence under any other felony conviction (OK ST T. 26 § 4-101).\n\nNo person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored by the governor or other appropriate authority (VA Const. Art. 2, § 1). The Department of Corrections is required to provide persons convicted of felonies with information regarding voting rights restoration and assist with the process established by the governor for the review of applications (VA Code Ann. § 53.1-231.1 et seq.). Individuals with felony convictions may petition the courts in an attempt to restore their voting rights (VA Code Ann. § 53.1-231.2). In 2021, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam released an executive action that allows any person released from incarceration to qualify for restoration of voting rights. In 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin reversed that practice and began requiring individuals to apply for rights restoration once again."
