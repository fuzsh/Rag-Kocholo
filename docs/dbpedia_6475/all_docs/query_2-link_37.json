        "text": "Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nSection 3’s application hinges on a finding that there was an insurrection. Since its ratification in 1868, at least eight public officials have been formally adjudicated to be disqualified and barred from public office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Importantly, many of those who were disqualified were never found guilty of any crimes, because Section 3 does not require a criminal conviction.\n\nJust as the Civil War was an insurrection, so too have courts and other government bodies found that January 6, 2021, was an insurrection. Bipartisan acts of Congress, congressional reports, presidential statements, judicial decisions, and other “public documents” have all found that January 6 was an insurrection. Perhaps most importantly, the bipartisan U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol established in its final report that the January 6 attack was an insurrection within the meaning of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn State ex. rel White v. Griffin, a New Mexico state district court concluded “that the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol and the surrounding planning, mobilization, and incitement constituted an ‘insurrection’ within the meaning of Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment.” As a result of that decision, Couy Griffin, a former New Mexico county commissioner who was a grassroots mobilizer and member of the mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6, was removed from office. This case, brought on behalf of three New Mexico residents by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was the first time since 1869 that a court had ordered a public official removed from office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, and the first time any court had ruled the events of January 6, 2021, were an insurrection as defined by the Constitution.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms to enforce Section 3.\n\nQuo Warranto Lawsuits: Section 3 can be adjudicated through civil lawsuits where state attorneys general or private citizens can bring a legal action challenging an officeholder’s qualifications for office. Quo warranto lawsuits are a remedy commonly used to challenge the authority of a public official to hold office or exercise power. They provide a legal avenue to challenge the eligibility, qualifications, or conduct of public officials and, in so doing, help ensure accountability, preserve the rule of law, and uphold the public’s trust in the integrity of government.\n\nLegislative Exclusion: Congress and state legislatures have significant control over their own membership and can refuse to seat members-elect who fail to meet qualifications for office. When judging “qualifications,” the Supreme Court has said that the House and, by implication, the Senate may evaluate an officeholder’s potential “disqualifications,” including Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nCongress has, in the past, refused to seat members-elect for violating Section 3. After the North Carolina legislature elected their Civil War-era governor, Zebulon Vance, to the U.S. Senate in 1870, the Senate deemed him ineligible to serve under Section 3 because of his past support of the Confederacy. However, amnesty was granted to Vance under Section 3 in 1872, and he was reelected to the Senate and served until his death in 1894. Similarly, in 1919, the U.S. House of Representatives refused to seat Congressman-elect Victor Berger, citing the disqualification clause, due to his political views and alleged disloyalty.\n\nBallot Exclusion and Candidate Eligibility Challenges: Although paperwork errors like invalid signatures are a common reason for candidates to be excluded from the ballot, every state plus the District of Columbia has excluded candidates who fail to meet other statutory or constitutional requirements for seeking or holding office. If a private party believes that a candidate has been improperly placed on the ballot, they can bring a candidate eligibility challenge.\n\nAlthough processes vary across states, a candidate eligibility challenge may come in the form of a writ of mandamus arguing that the requisite elections official committed an abuse of discretion by placing a statutorily or constitutionally ineligible candidate on the ballot.\n\nNorth Carolina law, for instance, specifically authorizes candidate eligibility challenges if “the candidate does not meet the constitutional … qualifications for the office.” In 2022, 11 North Carolina voters, represented by Free Speech for People, brought a lawsuit against then-Representative Madison Cawthorn, arguing that he should be disqualified from running for office because of his efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Although the lawsuit was dismissed as moot after Cawthorn lost the primary election, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit nonetheless endorsed the legality of candidate eligibility challenges by holding that the individuals who had petitioned to prevent Representative Cawthorn from appearing on the ballot had standing “due to their rights under state law to challenge his candidacy.”"
