Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. They coincided with the presidential election of the same year, in which Democrat Bill Clinton was re-elected president.\n\nRepublicans held a 54–46 majority going into 1996, however, a January special election in Oregon resulted in Democrats reducing the majority to 53–47. Despite the re-election of Clinton and Gore, and despite Democrats picking a net 2 seats up in the elections to the United States House of Representatives held the same day, the Republicans had a net gain of 2 seats in the Senate, following major Republican gains 2 years before in the 1994 elections. As such, Clinton became the only president to be re-elected without ever having any Senate coattails since the ratification of the 17th Amendment.\n\nThe Republicans won open seats previously held by Democrats in Alabama, Arkansas, and Nebraska. The only Democratic pickup occurred in South Dakota, where Democrat Tim Johnson narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Larry Pressler. The cycle featured an unusually high number of retirements, with 13 in total.\n\n↓ 45 55 Democratic Republican\n\nDoes not include Oregon's January 1996 special election.

This seat would remain controlled by Republicans until the election of Doug Jones[2] in 2017.\n\nIn the 1968 presidential election, Alabama supported American Independent Party candidate George Wallace over both Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. Wallace was the official Democratic candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the \"National Democratic\".[3] In 1976, Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.\n\nSince 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and, until 2010, comprised a longstanding majority in the Alabama Legislature.\n\nRoger Bedford won the Democratic primary over Glen Browder. Sessions won the Republican primary over Sid McDonald and Charles Woods, defeating McDonald in the runoff.

Cuddy in the open primary.\n\nIn the general election, Stevens faced off against Democratic nominee Theresa Obermeyer, a former member of the Anchorage School Board,[4] and Green Party nominee Jed Whittaker, a commercial fisherman.\n\nThe race drew national attention for Obermeyer's erratic behavior: she blamed Stevens for her husband's failure to pass the bar exam and contended that he had passed the bar by fraud. She \"trailed\" him to campaign events, frequently wearing a prisoner's outfit and once dragging a ball and chain behind her. During the campaign, she was arrested and served 30 days in prison in California and Oregon for probation violations.[5]\n\nStevens was re-elected in an overwhelming landslide and Whittaker finished ahead of Obermeyer.\n\nOpen primary[6] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 138,492 100.00%\n\n1996 United States Senate election in Alaska[7] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 148,856 64.19% +30.15% Turnout 231,916 Republican hold Swing\n\nArkansas election\n\n← 1990\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Tim Hutchinson Winston Bryant Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 445,942 400,241 Percentage 52.7% 47.3%\n\nCounty Results\n\nHutchinson: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nBryant: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nDavid Pryor\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nTim Hutchinson\n\nRepublican\n\nIncumbent Democrat David Pryor decided to retire.

Republicans nominated Guy Millner, a multi-millionaire businessman who was also the unsuccessful candidate who ran against Zell Miller in the 1994 gubernatorial election. Millner emerged as the victor from a crowded 6-person primary in July 1996, which included State Senator Clint Day and former gubernatorial candidate Johnny Isakson. However, Max Cleland, the Secretary of State of Georgia ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nDespite being held by Democrats since 1852, the election for this seat became tightly contested between Cleland and Millner. It was the closest race for that seat since at least 1852. Nonetheless, Max Cleland defeated Guy Millner on November 5. Max Cleland narrowly edged out a victory with 1,103,993 votes (48.87%) to Guy Millner's 1,073,969 votes (47.54%) – a margin of 1.33%.\n\nThe Class 2 United States Senate seat had been reliably Democratic, with a member of that party holding it since 1852. Additionally, no Republican had ever held this seat since it was established in 1789. In fact, during the previous election, Sam Nunn was unanimously re-elected and defeated Mike Hicks by an almost 60% margin in 1984. Republican Paul Coverdell narrowly unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler in Georgia's other United States Senate seat in 1992. On October 9, 1995, 4-term incumbent Class 2 Senator Sam Nunn announced his retirement.[14] This left the seat open for the first time since 1972.\n\nAfter the retirement of Sam Nunn, Democrats began seeking a successor for him. Eventually, Secretary of State of Georgia Max Cleland entered the race. Cleland was the only Democratic candidate to file for election, thus he became the nominee by default on July 9, 1996. During the primary, he received 517,697 votes – 100%.\n\nRepublicans also saw opportunity with an open Senate seat in Georgia. Six candidates filled to enter the Primary Election and become the Republican Nominee after July 9, 1996.\n\nAfter the Republican Primary, Guy Millner emerged as the nominee. Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, noted that defeated rival Johnny Isakson was more likely to win the moderate vote due to his pro-abortion rights views on abortion. Several polls earlier that year showed Cleland defeating both Millner and Isakson. In contrast to Isakson's opinion, Guy Millner was opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. Johnny Isakson was later elected United States Senator after Zell Miller retired from his seat in 2004. Opponent Max Cleland quickly labeled Millner as an extremist, saying that \"I think people in this state want to elect a moderate ... not an extremist, not an ideologue, and not somebody hung up on some ideological agenda.\" In response, Millner began campaigning on other issues to capture more moderate voters.[15]\n\nOn Election Day, Democratic nominee Max Cleland narrowly won against Republican Guy Millner. It was one of the closest United States Senate Elections in the history of Georgia. Cleland received 1,103,993 votes to Millner's 1,073,969 votes.

She prevailed by 5,788 votes out of 1.7 million cast, the narrowest national result of the thirty-three races for the U.S. Senate that year and one of the closest election margins in Louisiana history. At the same time, Democrat Bill Clinton carried Louisiana by a considerable margin of 927,837 votes to 712,586 cast for Republican Bob Dole.\n\nThe multi-candidate field for the primary included Democratic state Attorney General Richard Ieyoub and the former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, running again as a Republican. Among the minor candidates was Peggy Wilson, an at-large member of the New Orleans City Council, and Troyce Guice, who had sought the same seat thirty years earlier when it was held by the veteran Senator Allen J.

He took his case to the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and petitioned for Landrieu's unseating pending a new election. In a hearing, carried live by C-SPAN, the Senate Rules Committee in a party-line 8–7 vote agreed to investigate the charges. The decision briefly placed Landrieu's status in the U.S. Senate under a cloud.\n\nOnly a month into the probe, however, it emerged that Thomas \"Papa Bear\" Miller, a detective hired by Jenkins to investigate claims of fraud, had coached witnesses to claim they had participated in election fraud. Three witnesses claimed Miller had paid them to claim that they had either cast multiple votes for Landrieu or drove vans of illegal voters across town. The others told such bizarre tales that FBI agents dismissed their claims out of hand. It also emerged that Miller had several felony convictions on his record, including a guilty plea to attempted murder. The Democrats walked out of the probe in protest, but the probe continued.[30]\n\nThe investigation dragged on for over ten months, angering the Democrats and exacerbating partisan friction in the day-to-day sessions of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee to which Landrieu was assigned as a freshman member of the 105th Congress. Finally, in October 1997, the Rules Committee concluded that while there were major electoral irregularities, none of them were serious enough to burden Louisiana with a new election at that stage. It recommended that the results stand.\n\nThe Landrieu-Jenkins contest was not the only U.S. Senate election in 20th century Louisiana in which the results were hotly disputed. Future Senator John H. Overton claimed the renomination and hence reelection of Senator Joseph E. Ransdell was tainted by fraud. In 1932, Senator Edwin S. Broussard claimed that his primary defeat by Overton was fraudulent.

Kerry's previous two opponents in 1984 and 1990 had no prior elected office experience. The election was one of many competitive senate elections in 1996.\n\nAt the federal level, Democrats controlled both U.S. Senate seats and eight of ten U.S. House seats. No Republican won a senate election since 1972. In the 1984 presidential election, President Ronald Reagan won 49 of 50 states, with Massachusetts being his worst performance (excluding Walter Mondale's home-state of Minnesota. Reagan carried the state with just 51% of the vote. In 1994, incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election against businessman Mitt Romney with just 58% of the vote, the lowest percentage since his first senate election campaign in 1962.\n\nThe first debate between Weld and Kerry was held in Faneuil Hall on April 8 with a second debate held on June 3. A third debate was held at the Emerson Majestic Theater on July 2. The Weld and Kerry campaigns agreed to eight debates and a spending cap of $6.9 million negotiated at Senator Kerry's Beacon Hill home on August 7; Senator Kerry later mortgaged his house to raise funds in October. On the same day the spending cap was agreed upon, Governor Weld jumped into the Charles River. He later spoke at the 1996 Republican National Convention on August 14 before debating U.S. Senator Kerry again on August 19.

Prior to that accusation, Boschwitz had significantly outspent Wellstone on campaign advertising and the race was closely contested, but Wellstone went on to beat Boschwitz by a nine-point margin in a three-way race (Dean Barkley received 7%).[39] Despite losing here, Barkley was later appointed near the end of the next term after Wellstone's 2002 death.\n\nMinnesota general election Party Candidate Votes % Majority 197,236 9.04% Total votes 2,182,905 100.00% Democratic hold\n\nMississippi election\n\n← 1990\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Thad Cochran Bootie Hunt Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 624,154 240,647 Percentage 71.0% 27.4%\n\nCounty results\n\nCochran: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90% >90%\n\nHunt: 50–60%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nThad Cochran\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nThad Cochran\n\nRepublican\n\nIncumbent Republican Thad Cochran won re-election to a fourth term, unopposed in the Republican primary, by a landslide over Democrat Bootie Hunt, who defeated Shawn O'Hara in the Democratic primary.\n\nMississippi general election[40] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 383,507 43.6% Turnout 878,662 100.00% Republican hold\n\nMontana election\n\n← 1990\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Max Baucus Denny Rehberg Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 201,935 182,111 Percentage 49.56% 44.69%\n\nCounty results\n\nBaucus: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nRehberg: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nMax Baucus\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nMax Baucus\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Democrat Max Baucus, who was first elected in 1978 and was re-elected in 1984 and 1990, ran for re-election.

Wyden then defeated Smith in the general election by just over one percentage point.[53] Smith would win the regularly-scheduled election to the Senate later that year and serve alongside Wyden until 2009, when he was succeeded by Democrat Jeff Merkley.\n\nDemocratic primary[54] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 25,121 5.85% Total votes 429,722 100.00%\n\nRepublican primary[55] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 147,902 38.25% Total votes 386,712 100%\n\nGeneral election[56] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 18,220 1.52% Total votes 1,196,608 100.0% Democratic gain from Vacant\n\nOregon general election\n\n← 1990\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Gordon Smith Tom Bruggere Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 667,336 624,370 Percentage 49.8% 45.9%\n\nCounty results\n\nSmith: 40-50% 50-60% 60-70% 70-80%\n\nBruggere: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nMark Hatfield\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nGordon H.

Smith, who had run for the Senate earlier that year, won the Republican primary with nominal opposition, while businessman Tom Bruggere won a contested Democratic primary over Harry Lonsdale, who had run in two previous Senate elections and was the Democratic nominee in 1990. The contest between Smith and Bruggere was one of the toughest that year, but ultimately, Smith was able to keep the seat in the Republican column and defeated Bruggere by a four-point margin.\n\nDemocratic primary[57] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 304,968 100.00%\n\nRepublican primary[57] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 287,500 100.00%\n\nThis was the second Senatorial race for Gordon Smith in 1996; he had previously lost to Ron Wyden in the special election to fill Bob Packwood's seat.\n\nBoth candidates spent heavily from their own resources. Bruggere won the Democratic nomination with $800,000 of his own money in the primary race,[58] and was one of 134 candidates for the U.S. Congress to finance their own elections in excess of $50,000 in that cycle.[59] Smith had already spent $2.5 million of his own money earlier that same year in an unsuccessful effort to defeat Democrat Ron Wyden in the 1996 special election to replace Bob Packwood, who had resigned.[58]\n\nShortly after their respective primary victories, the rivals met for a highly publicized lunch, and agreed to run issue-oriented campaigns. However, in the final weeks of the campaign, Bruggere supporters ran advertisements alleging a pollution problem with Smith's frozen foods business, which the Smith campaign characterized as a breach of that agreement.[58] A Boston Globe profile highlighted their similarities as corporate candidates with minimal political experience.[58]\n\nIn the general election race, most Oregon daily newspapers endorsed Smith over Bruggere.[60] The race was close, with neither side claiming victory for several days after the elections absentee ballots were tallied. After all votes were counted, Smith won by 4 percentage points.[61] It was the last of the 1996 Senate elections to be determined; overall, the Republicans gained two seats in the Senate, increasing their majority from 53 to 55 seats.[62]\n\nOregon general election[7] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 52,966 3.89% −3.60% Turnout 1,360,230 Republican hold Swing\n\nRhode Island election\n\n← 1990 November 4, 1996 2002 →\n\nNominee Jack Reed Nancy Mayer Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 230,676 127,368 Percentage 63.3% 35.0%\n\nCounty results\n\nMunicipality results\n\nReed: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nMayer: 40–50% 50–60%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nClaiborne Pell\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nJack Reed\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Democrat Claiborne Pell decided to retire.

Elliott Springs Close, a 43-year-old political novice from Columbia, entered the Democratic primary and faced opposition from black photographer Cecil J. Williams. Close was a wealthy heir of a textile business, a brother-in-law of President Clinton's chief of staff Erskine Bowles, who styled himself as a fiscal conservative and a social moderate. Even though he proclaimed himself as such, he took positions that would align himself with the liberal wing of the Democratic party. Close would not have voted to balance the budget, he agreed with the Don't ask, don't tell policy of the military initiated by Clinton and he supported continuing welfare as a federal entitlement program.\n\nDemocratic primary Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 165,736 100.00%\n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party held their primary on June 11, 1996, and the contest pitted 93-year-old incumbent Senator Strom Thurmond against two relatively unknown candidates. Secretary of State Jim Miles was the only Republican statewide official who had not endorsed Strom Thurmond and it was rumored that he was considering entering the primary. Thurmond's press secretary, Mark Goodin, criticized Miles for not endorsing Thurmond and told those who contributed to Miles campaign fund that they were contributing to a contest against Thurmond, not the state's other Senator, Democrat Fritz Hollings. Miles soon endorsed Thurmond which left Harold G. Worley, a state representative from Myrtle Beach, and Charlie Thompson, an educator from Charleston, as the only opponents to Thurmond's election. Worley spent $600,000 of his own money and based his campaign almost solely on Thurmond's age. He questioned Thurmond's mental ability to make decisions and whether he had the capacity to fill out a full term, which would put Thurmond at one-hundred years old. Nevertheless, Thurmond cruised to a primary victory and Worley only carried Horry County.\n\nRepublican primary Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 217,996 100.00%\n\nThe race between Thurmond and Close boiled down to whether Thurmond could retain the affection of voters who had re-elected him over and over or whether Close could convince the voters that Thurmond's age was an impediment to effective service for the state. Thurmond therefore adopted a non-confrontational approach to the campaign. He chose to not debate Close, not only because he had not debated an opponent since Olin D. Johnston in the 1950 Senate election, but also because it would only emphasize the 50-year age difference between the candidates. Thurmond energetically traversed the state greeting the voters and pointed out to them that with his experience, he could more effectively serve the state than a political neophyte.\n\nClose ran television advertisements that highlighted the age issue by declaring that although Thurmond had admirably served the state for over fifty years, it was time for someone new to represent South Carolina. He poured almost a million dollars into his campaign, but his campaign never remained focused. For instance, trying to not appear too wealthy, Close traded his fancy foreign car for a Cadillac. He acquired a speeding ticket in the Cadillac and a newspaper criticized him for driving a luxury automobile. Frustrated, Close then switched his Cadillac for a Buick. Another instance of his jumbled campaign came when said that his family's textile factories did not lay off an employee during the Great Depression. Yet a week after this statement, three mills were closed and 850 employees were out of work.\n\nBy the day of the election on November 5, polls had shown that the voters thought it was time for Thurmond to retire, but they did not want to throw him out of office. Close spent almost a million dollars of his fortune to defeat Thurmond and his decision to raise a million dollars from outside sources was attacked by the Thurmond campaign of a lack of confidence by Close in his own campaign. Thurmond spent a little more than $2.6 million on the race and was said to have \"dodged the bullet\" by The State reporter Lee Bandy after his victory.[66] The campaign aides of Thurmond stated he could have been defeated had either former Governor Richard Riley or 5th district congressman John M. Spratt, Jr. run against him.\n\nSouth Carolina general election Party Candidate Votes % Majority 109,100 9.4% −22.3% Turnout 1,162,125 64.0% +8.8% Republican hold Swing\n\nSouth Dakota election\n\n← 1990\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Tim Johnson Larry Pressler Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 166,533 157,954 Percentage 51.3% 48.7%\n\nCounty results\n\nJohnson: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nPressler: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nLarry Pressler\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nTim Johnson\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Republican Larry Pressler ran for re-election to a fourth term, but narrowly lost to Democratic nominee Tim Johnson by 9,000 votes.\n\nPressler and Johnson swapped leads in their own polls all year. The two candidates also swapped charges. Pressler said that Johnson was too liberal for the state, while Johnson contended that Pressler was beholden to the out-of-state interests that have fattened his campaign coffers.\n\nSeeking a fourth term, Pressler noted his seniority; his close ties to his longtime Senate colleague, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole; and, most emphatically, the power he wielded as the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n\nYet the massive changes in telecommunications law that he shepherded through the Senate since becoming chairman last year proved to be a mixed blessing politically for Pressler.\n\nPolitical action committees related to industries affected by the legislation were generous donors to his campaign, and Pressler assured South Dakota voters that, over the long run, the bill will lower prices and provide jobs. But both telephone and cable television rates had gone up in South Dakota that year, leading Pressler to pull an ad stating that phone rates were going down.\n\nDespite this apparently negative short-term effect, Pressler said that Johnson's votes against the \"telecom\" bill, along with his opposition to the GOP's seven-year balanced-budget plan and changes in farm policy, proved Johnson votes inconsistently with his moderate rhetoric.\n\n\"You say one thing in South Dakota and vote liberal all the time in Washington,\" intoned an announcer in a Pressler TV ad. In another ad, which Pressler called \"the essence of my campaign,\" the senator himself called Johnson a liberal.\n\nJohnson countered that Pressler's vote for the deficit- reducing budget-reconciliation package was a blow against the interests of farmers and seniors, two groups that helped fuel Pressler's victories in the past. Johnson also warned that farmers will be more vulnerable in years of poor yield under the new farm law. The so-called Freedom To Farm Act received mixed reviews from major agriculture groups in the state. The results were 51% for Johnson and 49% for Pressler.\n\nGeneral election results Party Candidate Votes % Majority 8,579 2.64% −4.68% Turnout 324,487 Democratic gain from Republican Swing\n\nTennessee election\n\n← 1994 (special)\n\n2002 →\n\nNominee Fred Thompson Houston Gordon Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 1,091,554 654,937 Percentage 61.37% 36.82%\n\nCounty results\n\nThompson: 50–60% 60—70% 70–80%\n\nGordon: 50–60% 60–70%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nFred Thompson\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nFred Thompson\n\nRepublican\n\nRepublican Senator Fred Thompson ran for re-election to a second term.

Morales, who never ran for public office before, pulled a major upset in the primary by defeated three politicians: U.S. Congressman John Wiley Bryant, U.S. Congressman Jim Chapman, and former State Supreme Court litigator John Odam. In the March run-off, he defeated Bryant with 51% of the vote. He became the first minority in Texas history to become a United States Senate nominee from either major party. Despite having no staff, raising only $15,000, and not accepting any special interest money he obtained 2.5 million votes.[68]\n\nGramm previously ran for president earlier in the year, but lost to fellow U.S. Senator Bob Dole in the Republican presidential primary. Gramm was the heavy favorite. A September poll showed Gramm leading 50% to 40%. A late October poll showed him leading with 53% to 31%.[69]\n\nExit Polls showed that Gramm performed well with Anglos (68% to 31%), while Morales won African Americans (79% to 19%) and Latinos (79% to 20%) respectively.\n\nGeneral election[70] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 598,904 10.9% Turnout 5,527,441 100.00% Republican hold\n\nVirginia election\n\nIncumbent Republican John Warner won re-election to a fourth term.

W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Colin Powell, while Miller was endorsed by the Christian Coalition of America and the National Rifle Association of America (NRA).[73]\n\nRepublican primary[74] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 493,535 100.00%\n\nThe two Warners (no relation) competed in one of the closest Senate elections in Virginia history. The incumbent, who was a moderate Republican, was very popular and did not even have a major opponent in his last re-election bid in 1990. Although Mark Warner was relatively unknown, he became one of John Warner's strongest challengers. The Democrat self-financed his campaign and ended up outspending the Republican. In October, the Democrat outspent the incumbent 5–1.[75]\n\nThe incumbent had to compete in a primary against James C. Miller III, who was more conservative, because he decided to endorse an independent in the 1994 U.S. Senate election, opting not to endorse the controversial Republican nominee, Oliver North. Despite this, North did endorse John Warner in the 1996 election.[76] In the general election, the incumbent called the Democrat a \"robber baron,\" \"Carpetbagger,\" and a \"Connecticut Yankee\" who raised money from outside the state.[77][78][79] Mark Warner tried to compete in the Southern part of the state, which is traditionally Republican territory. He earned the endorsement from the Reform Party of Virginia.[80]\n\nIn June, the incumbent was leading 58%–24%.[81] On September 19, the incumbent led 54%–34%.[82]\n\nVirginia general election[7] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 119,762 5.09% −57.67% Turnout 2,354,715 Republican hold Swing\n\nMark Warner lost the parts of the state that are outside the three largest metropolitan areas, 51%–49%, a very impressive result for a Democrat in this heavily Republican territory. However, John Warner's strength among moderates enabled him to carry Northern Virginia 55%–45%, which got him over the top.[83] Warner would win election to the U.S. Senate in 2008, receiving John Warner's endorsement.\n\n1996 United States Senate election in West Virginia\n\n← 1990 November 5, 1996 2002 →\n\nNominee Jay Rockefeller Betty Burks Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 456,526 139,088 Percentage 76.65% 23.35%\n\nCounty results\n\nRockefeller: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90% >90%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nJay Rockefeller\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nJay Rockefeller\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller won re-election to a third term victory over Betty Berks.\n\nIncumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller ran for re-election to a third term.
