The report will be updated again for the 2004\n\npresidential election.\n\nPresidential Elections in the United States: A Primer\n\nSummary\n\nEvery four years, Americans elect a President and Vice President, thereby\n\nchoosing both national leaders and a course of public policy. The system that governs\n\nthe election of the President combines constitutional and statutory requirements, rules\n\nof the national and state political parties, political traditions, and contemporary\n\ndevelopments and practices.\n\nAs initially prescribed by the Constitution, the election of the President was left\n\nto electors chosen by the states. Final authority for selecting the President still rests\n\nwith the electoral college, which comprises electors from each state equal in number\n\nto the stateâs total representation in the House and Senate. All but two states award\n\nelectoral votes on a winner-take-all basis to the candidate with a plurality of the\n\nstateâs popular vote.\n\nThe process of electing the President is essentially divided into four stages: (1)\n\nthe prenomination phase, in which candidates compete in state primary elections and\n\ncaucuses for delegates to the national party conventions; (2) the national\n\nconventionsâheld in the summer of the election yearâin which the two major parties\n\nnominate candidates for President and Vice President and ratify a platform of the\n\npartiesâ policy positions and goals; (3) the general election campaign, in which the\n\nmajor party nominees, as well as any minor party or independent contenders, compete\n\nfor votes from the entire electorate, culminating in the popular vote on election day\n\nin November; and (4) the electoral college phase, in which the President and Vice\n\nPresident are officially elected.\n\nPresidential elections in recent years differ in several important respects from\n\nthose held earlier in American history. The first is the far wider participation of voters\n\ntoday in determining who the party nominees will be; the political parties have in\n\nrecent years given a much greater role to party voters in the states (in lieu of party\n\nleaders) in determining the nominees. The second difference involves the role of the\n\nelectronic media and, most recently, the Internet, both in conveying information to the\n\nvoters, and shaping the course of the campaign. Third, the financing of presidential\n\ncampaigns is substantially governed by a system of public funding in the pre-\n\nnomination, convention, and general election phases, enacted in the 1970s in response\n\nto increasing campaign costs in an electronic age and the concomitant fundraising\n\npressures on candidates. Thus, contemporary presidential elections blend both\n\ntraditional aspects of law and practice and contemporary aspects of a larger, more\n\ncomplex, and more technologically advanced society.\n\nContents\n\nI.

It\n\nprovides general information about Presidential candidates and their campaigns and\n\nit reviews the laws, activities, and customs that govern each of the four stages of the\n\nprocessâthe primary campaign, the national nominating conventions, the general\n\nelection, and the electoral college.\n\nChapter one discusses the candidates themselvesâtheir qualifications for office,\n\nthe procedure for gaining ballot access, the stages of their campaigns, and the\n\nprotection accorded them by the federal government.\n\nChapter two focuses on the nomination process, describing the evolution of the\n\ncurrent system of primaries and caucuses, the basic structure, methods and rules\n\ngoverning selection of delegates to the nominating conventions, and the major\n\ncharacteristics of the contemporary process.\n\nChapter three examines the national party conventions, including both their\n\nevolution and traditions, and contemporary structure and procedures.\n\nChapter four focuses on the general election campaign, from the Labor Day\n\nâkickoffâ to November election day. It offers general comments on widely used\n\ncampaign methods during this period, examines the important role played by\n\ntelevisionâthrough advertising, news coverage, and debatesâand provides\n\ninformation on election day itself (how it was selected, polling hours in the states,\n\netc.).\n\nChapter five provides information on the electoral college, the process by which\n\nthe President and Vice President are officially elected. It follows the steps in the\n\nprocess of convening the electors and counting their votes, and offers information on\n\npast discrepancies between electoral and popular vote leaders. It also discusses\n\npossible scenarios for contingent election, in which no candidate receives an electoral\n\nmajority or when a candidate dies at some stage of the process.\n\nOne aspect of the process not examined in this discussion is treated in a\n\ncompanion CRS report on the funding of presidential elections, in particular the\n\nsystem of public financing available since 1976. See CRS Report RS20133, The\n\nPresidential Election Campaign Fund and Tax Checkoff: Background and Current\n\nIssues.\n\nI. Presidential Candidates\n\nQualifications for the Office of President\n\nArticle II, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that, to be President or Vice\n\nPresident, a person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35\n\nyears of age, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.1 Most\n\nconstitutional scholars interpret this language as including citizens born outside the\n\nUnited States to parents who are U.S. citizens under the ânatural bornâ requirement.2\n\nUnder the 22nd Amendment, no one may serve more than two full terms, although a\n\nVice President who succeeds to the Presidency and serves less than two full years of\n\nthe prior incumbentâs term may seek election to two additional terms.\n\nPrior Occupations of Presidents\n\nAmerican voters have chosen men of varied backgrounds on the 53 occasions\n\nthey have gone to the polls to elect a President. All 41 Presidents served the country\n\npreviously either in government or the military. Of the 24 Presidents who served prior\n\nto 1900, seven had been Vice Presidents (three of whom were elected to the\n\nPresidency, while four succeeded a deceased incumbent), four were Members of\n\nCongress, four were governors, and nine previously held an appointive federal\n\nposition.\n\nThe trend in 20th century presidential elections has favored former Vice\n\nPresidents, Governors, and Senators. Of 17 20th century Presidents, several served\n\nin more than one of these positions. At the time of their inauguration, one\n\n(Eisenhower) had served as a career Army officer; two (Taft and Hoover) had most\n\nrecently served as cabinet officers; five (Wilson, F.D. Roosevelt, Carter, Reagan, and\n\nClinton) as governors; two (Harding and Kennedy) were Senators; and seven were\n\nVice Presidents. Five of the seven Vice Presidents (T. Roosevelt, Coolidge, Truman,\n\nJohnson, and Ford) succeeded on the death or resignation of the incumbent; two Vice\n\nPresidents were electedâone (Nixon) as a former and one (Bush) as an incumbent.\n\nThe Candidate Field\n\nBefore the primaries and conventions, the candidates determine the presidential\n\nfield. The decline of party leader dominance over the nominating process has resulted\n\nin a system whereby self-selected candidates compete in the states for the delegates\n\nneeded for nomination. The democratization of the nominating process has meant\n\n1 Defined as including the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\n2 Citizens born in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are legally defined as\n\nânatural bornâ citizens, and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected President, provided they\n\nmeet qualifications of age and 14 years residence within the United States. Residence in\n\nPuerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions does not qualify as residence within the\n\nUnited States for these purposes. [U.S. Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service,\n\nU.S. Insular Areas and Their Political Development, by (name redacted) and (name reda\n\ncted), CRS Report 96-578GOV (Washington: Jun. 17, 1996), pp. 9, 21, 33].\n\nCRS-3\n\nthat many candidates enter the race, begin raising money, and organize for the\n\nprimaries and caucuses well before the election year in order to be competitive.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, 203 individuals had filed\n\nstatements of candidacy or had committees file statements of organization for the\n\n2000 presidential election as of January 31, 2000. Just 33 of these individuals had\n\nmet the Federal Election Campaign Actâs (FECA) criteria for candidacies subject to\n\nfederal election laws, i.e., raising contributions or making expenditures in excess of\n\n$5,000 [2 U.S.C. Â§431(2)]. In reality, only a small number of these are considered by\n\nthe media as serious candidates seeking the nomination of the two major parties.\n\nExploratory CandidaciesâTesting the Waters\n\nThe formal announcement of candidacy is often preceded by a period in which\n\ncandidates âtest the watersâ as unannounced candidates for nomination; this may\n\nbegin several years before the convention. Likely candidates may form exploratory\n\ncommittees to gauge popular support and to begin developing a base of supporters\n\nand contributors, while avoiding some of the legal requirements (such as contribution\n\nlimits and disclosure of receipts and disbursements) of the FECA. As unofficial\n\ncandidates who are not technically campaigning for office, persons may raise and\n\nspend unlimited amounts of money without registering as candidates with the Federal\n\nElection Commission (FEC). Upon declaration of candidacy, however, the individual\n\nmust register with the FEC and report all financial activity while testing the waters;\n\nthese amounts become retroactively subject to all FECA regulations.\n\nAnnouncement of Candidacy\n\nAn individual must file a statement of candidacy with the FEC within 15 days of\n\nreaching the lawâs financial threshold (i.e., $5,000 in receipts or expenditures), and\n\nmust name a principal campaign committee to receive contributions and make\n\nexpenditures. This committee must file a statement of organization with the FEC\n\nwithin ten days after being designated; the statement must identify the committeeâs\n\ntitle (which includes the candidateâs name), the treasurer, bank depositories, and any\n\nother committees the candidate has authorized to raise or spend on his or her behalf.\n\nSuch other committees which the candidate authorizes may raise and spend funds, but\n\nthey must report such activity through the principal committee.\n\nThe timing of the formal announcement is crucial because of its political impact,\n\nand also because of the legal and tactical implications. Once a public declaration of\n\ncandidacy is made, candidates are subject to state and national spending limits if they\n\nqualify for and choose to accept public matching funds, and they are subject to the\n\nbroadcasting provisions of the equal-time rule (47 U.S.C. 315(a)).\n\nNominations today are usually won during the primary campaign rather than at\n\nthe convention, and primaries have proliferated and been scheduled earlier in the\n\nelection year. Because of these developments, competitors are pressed to announce\n\ntheir candidacies much earlier than in years past. Whereas in 1932, Franklin\n\nRoosevelt formally announced for the Presidency 156 days before the convention,\n\nMichael Dukakis formally announced his candidacy 446 days prior to the 1988\n\nCRS-4\n\nDemocratic National Convention. The trend toward earlier, longer campaigns is a\n\nhallmark of modern presidential elections.\n\nQualifying for the Primaries and Caucuses\n\nThe guidelines that candidates follow to qualify for primaries and caucuses differ\n\nfrom state to state. In primary states, the Secretary of State (or other chief elections\n\nofficer) is the authority for listing candidate names on the ballot; in caucus states, the\n\nparties oversee the procedures for candidates to gain ballot access (they do not always\n\nhave to file to be eligible for delegates in caucus states, however).\n\nCandidates generally file a statement of candidacy with the Secretary of State or\n\nthe party chair at the state level. In some primary states, the Secretary of State may\n\nautomatically certify for the ballot the names of all major party candidates, those\n\nsubmitted by the party, candidates who have qualified in other states, or candidates\n\nwho have applied with the FEC or are eligible for federal matching funds. Presidential\n\ncandidates may also be required to pay a filing fee, submit petitions, or both.\n\nSignatures may be required from a requisite number of voters in each congressional\n\ndistrict or from a requisite number of voters statewide.\n\nParty Nominations\n\nThe primary season gradually reduces the field of major party candidates. The\n\naccelerated pace of the present system winnows out those who fall short of\n\nexpectations, and hence, find it difficult to raise the money needed to sustain their\n\ncandidacies. Furthermore, the reforms of the past 30 years have changed the dynamics\n\nof the nominating process by closely tying the allocation of delegates to electoral\n\nperformance. The days when a candidate could compete in a select number of\n\nprimaries to demonstrate popular appeal have passed: the nomination goes to the\n\ncandidate who has amassed a majority of delegates in the primaries and caucuses.\n\nParty conventions have largely become ratifying bodies that confer the nomination on\n\nthe candidate who won it in state contests. The 1976 Republican National Convention\n\nwas the most recent one at which the determination of a major partyâs nominee was\n\nin any real doubt before the nominating ballots were cast.\n\nThe General Election Ballot\n\nThe names of the major party nominees for President and Vice President are\n\nautomatically placed on the general election ballot. Some states also list the names\n\nof presidential electors adjacent to the presidential and vice presidential candidates\n\nwhom they support. Voters mark their ballots once for a partyâs presidential and vice\n\npresidential ticket; electors also cast a single vote in the electoral college for the party\n\nticket. Minor party and independent candidates are also listed on the ballot, if they\n\nqualify according to provisions of the state codes, and several such candidates are\n\nusually on the ballot in different states.\n\nCRS-5\n\nSecret Service Protection3\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy while he\n\nwas seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Congress passed legislation\n\nwhich, for the first time, authorized Secret Service protection of presidential and vice\n\npresidential candidates.4 The law made the Secretary of the Treasury responsible for\n\ndetermining which major candidates are eligible for protection, after consultation with\n\na bipartisan advisory committee comprised of the Majority and Minority Leaders of\n\nthe Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, and\n\none additional member to be chosen by the committee. (Spouses of such candidates\n\nare also entitled to protection, within 120 days of the general election.) On occasion,\n\ncandidates have declined protection offered to them.\n\nWhile the law provides protection for major party presidential and vice\n\npresidential nominees in the general election, it does not specify the criteria for\n\ndetermining major candidates in the primary season. However, criteria and standards\n\nin the advisory committeeâs guidelines specify that an eligible individual: (1) is a\n\npublicly declared candidate; (2) is actively campaigning nationally and is contesting\n\nat least 10 state primaries; (3) is pursuing the nomination of a qualified party (i.e.,\n\nwhose presidential candidate received at least 10% of the popular vote in the prior\n\nelection); (4) has qualified for public matching funds of at least $100,000, and has\n\nraised at least $2 million in additional contributions; and (5) as of April 1 of the\n\nelection year, has received at least an average of five percent in individual candidate\n\npreferences in the most recent national opinion polls by ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN,\n\nor has received at least 10% of the votes cast for all candidates in two same-day or\n\nconsecutive primaries or caucuses.5 Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury, after consultation with the advisory committee, may provide protection for\n\na candidate even if all of the conditions of the guidelines have not been met.\n\nSecret Service protection for primary candidates generally begins shortly after\n\nJanuary 1 of the election year. On occasion, the Secretary of the Treasury has\n\naccorded protection to certain candidates earlier than the election year.\n\n3 Frederick Kaiser, Specialist in American National Government, in the CRS Government &\n\nFinance Division assisted in preparation of this section.\n\n4 P.L. 90-331; 18 U.S.C.

The Nomination Process\n\nPrimaries and caucuses are the initial testing ground for the next President. The\n\nprimary season plays an essential role in presidential elections by narrowing the field\n\nof major party candidates. The nomination is conferred on the candidate who holds\n\na majority of delegates at the party convention, but under the present system for\n\nchoosing delegates one candidate is likely to emerge with a majority by the end of the\n\nprimary season, if not sooner, and well before the convention meets.\n\nThe Development of the Nominating System\n\nThe emergence of the national nominating convention in 1831, in place of the\n\ncongressional caucus method of choosing nominees, gave the political parties a more\n\ndemocratic means of bestowing nominations, based more closely on popular\n\nsentiment. (See Chapter III for detailed information on national nominating\n\nconventions.)\n\nEarly Delegate Selection Methods.\n\nDelegates to the early conventions were either appointed by a party leader or\n\nwere chosen under a party-run caucus system. While both methods involved more\n\nparticipants than the congressional caucus, in reality they merely shifted control of\n\nnominations to the state party leadership, which usually controlled the stateâs entire\n\ndelegation. Delegates were chosen in this manner until the beginning of the 20th\n\ncentury when members of the Progressive Party, whose aim was to reform the\n\nstructure and processes of government, introduced an innovative device called the\n\nprimary.\n\nEmergence of the Primary.\n\nIn 1904, Florida became the first state to adopt the primary as a means of\n\nchoosing delegates to the nominating conventions, and many states followed within\n\nthe decade. By 1916, 20 Democratic and Republican parties selected delegates in\n\nprimaries. The primary took democratization of the nominating process a step further\n\nby enabling party members to choose the delegates. It was the first large-scale\n\ninnovation in the process since the introduction of the party convention about 80\n\nyears earlier.\n\nHailed as a triumph of democracy upon its debut, the primary failed to attract\n\nmany voters, and, in the first half of this century, it never became the principal route\n\nto the nomination. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt won nine of 13 Republican\n\nprimaries, but his name was not even placed in nomination at the Republican\n\nConvention (which instead re-nominated incumbent William Howard Taft, who had\n\nwon only one primary, but whose forces controlled the partyâs National Committee).\n\nThe primary movement made little progress in the years following the first World\n\nWar, and some states abandoned it as the method for choosing delegates. The\n\nnumber of state party primaries in which delegates were chosen stood at around 14\n\nfor the next four decades.\n\nCRS-7\n\nMany candidates avoided primaries altogether or ran in a select few, simply to\n\ndemonstrate their popular appeal. In 1952, Democratic contender Estes Kefauver\n\nentered and won 12 of 15 primaries held, only to see the convention turn to Adlai\n\nStevenson, who had not entered any primaries. In 1960, John F. Kennedy\n\ndemonstrated electability by winning a few selected primaries, but his delegate totals\n\nwere amassed more by his cultivation of key party leaders and state delegations.\n\nReform and Revival of the Primary.\n\nThe violence that marred the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago\n\nunderscored growing discontent in that party with the dominant role played by party\n\nleaders in the nomination of candidates. In response, the Democratic National\n\nCommittee formed the âMcGovern-Fraser Commissionâ to evaluate the delegate\n\nselection process and to recommend changes designed to make the system more\n\nresponsive to rank-and-file party members. The Commission, in 1969, proposed a\n\nseries of reforms that addressed most aspects of delegate selection, the principal aim\n\nof which was to increase popular participation and link it more directly to the\n\nselection of delegates. The National Committee accepted nearly all of the\n\nCommissionâs proposals, which were subsequently adopted by the state parties.\n\nFurthermore, some state legislatures, many of them under Democratic control,\n\nenacted statutes applicable to both parties which incorporated the Commissionâs\n\nrecommendations.\n\nThe Commission recommended a series of sweeping changes that addressed\n\nnearly every major aspect of delegate selection. It established guidelines for\n\ntranslating public support for candidates into delegate votes and eliminated automatic\n\nex-officio delegate slots by calling for the election of all of the delegates to the\n\nconvention. Guidelines for equal representation of women and minorities were\n\nadopted, and devices that vested considerable power in the party leadership (e.g.,\n\nproxy voting, the unit rule, etc.) were eliminated. The McGovern-Fraser\n\nrecommendations, as subsequently modified, changed the process for the Democrats,\n\nand had an impact as well on the system used by the Republicans, who made changes\n\nto respond to perceived public pressure for greater democratization.\n\nPerhaps the principal effect of the reform movement was the revitalization of the\n\nprimary in determining the choice of party nominees: it was viewed as the most\n\nsuitable method for encouraging broad participation. In 1968, 37.5% of Democratic\n\ndelegates were chosen in 17 primary states; the 16 Republican primary states that year\n\nsent 34.3% of the delegates to that partyâs convention. By 1976, the Democrats held\n\nprimaries in 30 states which selected 72.6% of the delegates, while the Republicans\n\nchose 67.9% of their delegates in 28 primary states. The percentage of delegates\n\nchosen in states holding primaries has been higher in recent cycles. Under the present\n\nschedule for 2000, 85.2% of Democratic delegates (in 38 states and the District of\n\nColumbia) and 90.1% of Republican delegates (in 41 states and the District of\n\nColumbia) will be selected in states holding primaries.\n\nThe resurgence of the primary was accompanied by changes in other aspects of\n\nthe political landscape which reinforced the importance of primary elections. The\n\nmedia became a full-fledged participant in the nominating process through their\n\nextensive coverage of primaries and their role in publicizing primary results.\n\nCRS-8\n\nCandidates are now likely to pick and choose which primaries to contest because\n\ndelegates are at stake in virtually all of them. Early primaries are especially vigorously\n\ncontested, particularly by lesser known candidates who seek to gain crucial media\n\ncoverage and establish campaign momentum; the pace of the entire season has\n\nquickened. The nominating process in the post-1968 era thus focused attention once\n\nagain on the primaries, where nominations today are won or lost.\n\nAssignment and Categorization of Delegates by the National Parties\n\nAllocation of Delegates to the States and Other Jurisdictions.\n\nEach party has its own method for assigning delegates (and alternates) to the\n\ndifferent states and jurisdictions.\n\nDemocrats. The Democratic Party allocates delegates and alternates according\n\nto a formula based on population, as measured by electoral college strength and past\n\nlevels of voting for Democratic presidential candidates in the general election. The\n\nDemocratic National Committee also awards delegates and alternates to five\n\njurisdictions for which the allocation factor cannot be computed because they do not\n\nparticipate in the presidential electionâAmerican Samoa, Democrats Abroad, Guam,\n\nPuerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Furthermore, the party assigns additional\n\ndelegate slots for party leaders, former distinguished elected officials, and the entire\n\nDemocratic membership of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nRepublicans. The Republican allocation system assigns three delegates per\n\ncongressional district and six delegates at-large for every state. It also assigns bonus\n\ndelegates based on the stateâs Republican vote in the previous election for President,\n\nU.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and Governor. Delegates to the\n\nconvention for other jurisdictions are assigned by the Republican National Committee.\n\nCategories of Delegates.\n\nDemocrats. The Democratic Party has two basic types of delegates, grouped\n\nby whether or not they are pledged to support a particular candidate. Furthermore,\n\nthere are three categories of pledged delegates (which comprise the majority of\n\ndelegates to the convention) and four categories of unpledged delegates.\n\nPledged delegates. The allocation formula determines only the number of\n\ndelegates in the pledged categories:\n\n! District-level base delegates;\n\n! At-large base delegates; and\n\n! Pledged party and elected official delegates.\n\nOf the number of delegates assigned to a state according to the allocation\n\nformula, 75 % are assigned at the district level and 25 % are designated at-large.\n\nAlthough district-level and at-large delegates are allocated in the same manner, they\n\nare chosen separately at different stages of the process.\n\nCRS-9\n\nPledged party and elected official delegates represent a 15% addition to the base\n\nnumber of allocated delegates. They are usually chosen in the same manner as the at-\n\nlarge delegates.\n\nUnpledged Delegates. The number of unpledged delegates for a state depends\n\non the number of individuals available in each specified category. Delegate slots are\n\nallocated for:\n\n! Former Democratic Presidents and Vice Presidents, former\n\nDemocratic Majority Leaders of the U.S. Senate, former Democratic\n\nSpeakers of the U.S. House of Representatives, and all former Chairs\n\nof the Democratic National Committee;\n\n! Democratic Governors;\n\n! Members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), including\n\nthe State chairs and vice chairs and officers of the DNC; and\n\n! All Democratic Members of the U.S. Senate and House of\n\nRepresentatives.\n\nRepublicans. Aside from three congressional district delegates and six at-large\n\ndelegates assigned to each state under Republican allocation rules, a number of bonus\n\ndelegates may be awarded for the at-large category as well.\n\nFour and one-half at-large bonus delegates are assigned to each state which cast\n\nits electoral votes for the Republican nominee in the previous election. One bonus\n\ndelegate is allocated to each State in which a Republican was elected to the Senate\n\nor the Governorship between the last and the upcoming presidential election. One\n\nbonus delegate is also allocated to states in which half the delegation to the House of\n\nRepresentatives is Republican. (In 1996, 15 at-large delegates have been allocated\n\nto the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico has been allocated 14 at-large delegates, and\n\nfour delegates have been allocated each to Guam and the Virgin Islands.)\n\nThe national party also awards bonus delegates to states where the primary or\n\ncaucus is held after mid-March of the election year. In states where the primary or\n\ncaucus is scheduled between March 15 and April 14, a 5% increase to the national\n\nconvention delegation is awarded; a 7Â½% increase is awarded to state parties with\n\ncontests scheduled between April 15 and May 14; and, a 10% increase is awarded to\n\nstates where the primary or caucus is held between May 15 and the third Tuesday in\n\nJune.\n\nState parties have considerable flexibility to determine the means of electing or\n\nchoosing the district and at-large delegates, according to national party rules.\n\nDelegate Selection Structure\n\nUnder the present system for choosing presidential nominees, state parties use\n\ntwo main electoral devices: the primary and the caucus/convention system. State\n\nparties combine the two in a variety of ways to choose delegates to the national\n\nCRS-10\n\nconventions and the resulting mix of methods accounts for the complexity that\n\ncharacterizes the presidential nominating process. Furthermore, the timing of\n\ndelegate selection events is determined by either the state legislatures or the state\n\nparties, depending on which electoral method is used. Primary dates are usually\n\ndetermined by the legislatures, while caucus events are scheduled by the stateâs\n\npolitical parties. In large part, this divided authority concerning the choice of method\n\nand the timing of delegate selection events explains and perpetuates the inherent\n\ncomplexity of the nominating system.\n\nThe Present Mixed System of Presidential Nomination Events.\n\nPrimaries. A primary is a state-run election for the purpose of nominating party\n\ncandidates to run in the general election. Presidential primaries perform this function\n\nin an indirect manner, because voters elect delegates to a national convention rather\n\nthan directly selecting presidential candidates.\n\nMost states restrict voting in a primary to party members; these are closed\n\nprimary states. Open primary states allow the voter to choose either partyâs ballot\n\nin the voting booth on primary day; none of the open primary states require voter\n\nregistration by party.\n\nIn 1992, more state parties selected delegates in a primary than ever beforeâ34\n\nDemocratic and 37 Republican (out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia).\n\nIn 2000, 39 Democratic and 42 Republican primaries are scheduled in the states and\n\nthe District of Columbia.\n\nCaucuses and Conventions. A caucus is a meeting of party members or leaders\n\nto select nominees for public office and to conduct other party business. In the\n\npresidential nominating process, it is often used in combination with a state\n\nconvention to elect delegates to the national nominating convention.\n\nThe caucus/convention process is typically comprised of several tiers, beginning\n\nwith broad-based meetings of rank-and-file party members, usually at the precinct\n\nlevel. Because of their cumbersome nature, precinct caucuses invariably attract fewer\n\nvoters than do primaries. Participants must invest substantial time to attend a caucus,\n\nin contrast to voting in a primary, and participants usually register their support for\n\na presidential candidate by public declaration (by a show of hands or by gathering in\n\ngroups according to presidential preference). In some places, caucus participants may\n\nvote by ballot for presidential candidates, but, in any event, the process requires face-\n\nto-face contact with other participants that is not required when casting a ballot at a\n\npolling place.\n\nOnce the presidential preference vote is tallied, caucus participants elect\n\nrepresentatives for their preference who attend the meeting convened as the next\n\nstage in the process. Precinct caucuses are usually followed by county or\n\ncongressional district meetings, with a smaller number of representatives selected at\n\neach stageâbased on support for them or the candidate they favorâto go on to the\n\nnext level. Delegates to the national convention are finally chosen by the\n\nrepresentatives to the congressional district caucus or the state convention, or both.\n\nCRS-11\n\nIn 2000, both state parties in nine states will select delegates using the caucus\n\nprocess; Democrats scheduled caucuses in three additional states.\n\nChoice of Device for Electing Delegates. Because primaries are administered\n\nby the states, the guidelines and timing are determined by state law; however, a\n\npolitical party may opt out of the primary and select delegates in a caucus process\n\ninstead. Not all states provide for a presidential primary, in which case both parties\n\nuse the caucus method and accordingly set their own rules and dates for caucus\n\nevents. In many primary states, caucuses are a component of the process for choosing\n\ndelegates as well, but the results of the primary are the crucial factor in determining\n\nthe division of delegates.\n\nMethods of Selecting Delegates.\n\nThe principal difference between the parties in choosing delegates is the\n\nDemocratic Partyâs requirement that delegate candidates selected in primaries and\n\ncaucuses state their presidential or uncommitted preference as a condition for\n\nelection. The Republican Party does not require a declaration of preference and,\n\nconsequently, Republican delegate selection is less uniform and more dependent upon\n\nthe different approaches of the state parties.\n\nDemocrats. Under the present system, state Democratic parties use one of the\n\nfollowing four methods to elect district delegates:\n\nCaucus/convention system. This consists of one to four tiers. As a general rule,\n\ngrassroots participation is at the first tier, at which representatives to the next tier are\n\nelected, and so on. Delegates and alternates are chosen at a district meeting, usually\n\nthe second or third tier.\n\nPre-primary caucus. This nominates district delegates, who are subsequently\n\nelected on the basis of the vote for President in the primary.\n\nPost-primary caucus. This is held after the primary to elect the number of\n\ndelegates a presidential candidate has won on the basis of the primary vote.\n\nTwo-part primary. This requires that the voter mark the ballot for presidential\n\npreference and again for individual delegates within a preference.\n\nDistrict delegates declare a presidential preference or run as uncommitted in the\n\nprimaries and caucuses. At-large and pledged party and elected official delegates also\n\ndeclare a presidential or uncommitted preference, but they are chosen by the state\n\ncommittee, a committee of elected district delegates, or by the state convention to\n\nreflect primary or caucus results.\n\nRepublicans. District delegates may be elected in a primary or may be selected\n\nby presidential candidates on the basis of the primary vote. They can be chosen in\n\ncongressional district caucuses, or they may be combined with the at-large delegates\n\nand selected as a unit at the state convention.\n\nCRS-12\n\nAt-large delegates may be elected by primary voters, chosen by presidential\n\ncandidates according to the primary vote, selected by the state committee, or, as in\n\nmost states, chosen at the state convention.\n\nTiming of Delegate Selection Events.\n\nWith three exceptions, the Democratic Party restricts first-stage delegate\n\nselection events to the period between the first Tuesday in March and the second\n\nTuesday in June. Party rules permit three states to hold delegate selection events\n\nprior to the first Tuesday in March: the Iowa Democratic Party may conduct its\n\nprecinct caucuses 15 days earlier; the New Hampshire primary may be held seven days\n\nearlier; and the Maine first-tier caucuses may be held two days earlier. These\n\nexceptions honor traditional dates for holding primaries and caucuses in New\n\nHampshire, Iowa and Maine that pre-dated the national partyâs rule that restricts\n\ndelegate selection contests to a specific period. For 2000, Iowa was given approval\n\nby the DNC to hold its caucuses even earlier, on January 24, and New Hampshire\n\nreceived approval to hold its primary on February 1. Maine Democrats no longer use\n\na caucus process, but elect delegates in a primary (on March 7, 2000).\n\nNational rules for the Republican Party state only that participants in caucuses\n\nor conventions for the purpose of choosing national convention delegates shall not be\n\nelected prior to the official call for the convention. The Party issues the call prior to\n\nJanuary 1 of the election year.\n\nThe timing of 2000 events appears in table 1, which presents the dates for state\n\nprimaries and caucuses in chronological order, along with the number of delegates\n\neach state sent to the respective conventions.\n\nTable 1. 2000 Presidential Primaries and Caucuses, by Date\n\nDate\n\nState\n\nMethod a\n\nDems\n\nReps\n\n(Primary or Caucus)\n\nJanuary 24\n\nIowa\n\nCaucus\n\n56\n\n25\n\nAlaska (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n23\n\nFebruary 1\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPrimary\n\n29\n\n17\n\nFebruary 7-13\n\nHawaii (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n14\n\nFebruary 8\n\nDelaware (R)\n\nPrimary b\n\nâ\n\n12\n\nFebruary 19\n\nSouth Carolina (R)\n\nPrimary b\n\nâ\n\n37\n\nFebruary 22\n\nArizona (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n30\n\nMichigan (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n12\n\nFebruary 26\n\nAmerican Samoa (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n4\n\nGuam (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n4\n\nCRS-13\n\nDate\n\nState\n\nMethod a\n\nDems\n\nReps\n\n(Primary or Caucus)\n\nVirgin Islands (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n4\n\nFebruary 27\n\nPuerto Rico (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n14\n\nFebruary 29\n\nNorth Dakota (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n19\n\nVirginia (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n56\n\nWashington (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n37\n\nMarch 7\n\nCalifornia\n\nPrimary\n\n434\n\n162\n\nConnecticut\n\nPrimary\n\n67\n\n25\n\nGeorgia\n\nPrimary\n\n92\n\n54\n\nHawaii (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n33\n\nâ\n\nIdaho (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n23\n\nâ\n\nMaine\n\nPrimary\n\n32\n\n14\n\nMaryland\n\nPrimary\n\n92\n\n31\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPrimary\n\n118\n\n37\n\nMinnesota (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n34\n\nMissouri\n\nPrimary\n\n92\n\n35\n\nNew York\n\nPrimary\n\n294\n\n101\n\nNorth Dakota (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n22\n\nâ\n\nOhio\n\nPrimary\n\n170\n\n69\n\nRhode Island\n\nPrimary\n\n32\n\n14\n\nVermont\n\nPrimary\n\n22\n\n12\n\nWashington (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n94\n\nâ\n\nAmerican Samoa (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n6\n\nâ\n\nMarch 9\n\nSouth Carolina (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n52\n\nâ\n\nMarch 10\n\nColorado\n\nPrimary\n\n61\n\n40\n\nUtah\n\nPrimary\n\n29\n\n29\n\nWyoming (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n22\n\nMarch 10-14\n\nDemocrats Abroad\n\nCaucus\n\n9\n\nâ\n\nMarch 11\n\nArizona (D)\n\nPrimary b\n\n55\n\nâ\n\nMichigan (D)\n\nPrimary b\n\n157\n\nâ\n\nMarch 11-12\n\nMinnesota (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n91\n\nâ\n\nMarch 12\n\nNevada (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n29\n\nâ\n\nMarch 14\n\nFlorida\n\nPrimary\n\n186\n\n80\n\nLouisiana\n\nPrimary\n\n74\n\n29\n\nMississippi\n\nPrimary\n\n48\n\n33\n\nOklahoma\n\nPrimary\n\n53\n\n38\n\nTennessee\n\nPrimary\n\n81\n\n37\n\nMarch 14\n\nTexas\n\nPrimary\n\n231\n\n124\n\nCRS-14\n\nDate\n\nState\n\nMethod a\n\nDems\n\nReps\n\n(Primary or Caucus)\n\nMarch 18\n\nGuam (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n6\n\nâ\n\nMarch 21\n\nIllinois\n\nPrimary\n\n189\n\n74\n\nNevada (R)\n\nCaucus\n\nâ\n\n17\n\nMarch 25\n\nWyoming (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n18\n\nâ\n\nMarch 26\n\nPuerto Rico (D)\n\nPrimary\n\n59\n\nâ\n\nMarch 27\n\nDelaware (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n22\n\nâ\n\nApril 1\n\nVirgin Islands (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n6\n\nâ\n\nApril 4\n\nKansas\n\nPrimary\n\n42\n\n35\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPrimary\n\n191\n\n78\n\nWisconsin\n\nPrimary\n\n92\n\n37\n\nApril 14-17\n\nVirginia (D)\n\nCaucus\n\n98\n\nâ\n\nMay 2\n\nIndiana\n\nPrimary\n\n88\n\n55\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPrimary\n\n103\n\n62\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nPrimary\n\n32\n\n15\n\nMay 9\n\nNebraska\n\nPrimary\n\n32\n\n30\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPrimary\n\n42\n\n18\n\nMay 16\n\nOregon\n\nPrimary\n\n58\n\n24\n\nMay 23\n\nArkansas\n\nPrimary\n\n48\n\n24\n\nIdaho (R)\n\nPrimary\n\nâ\n\n28\n\nKentucky\n\nPrimary\n\n58\n\n31\n\nJune 6\n\nAlabama\n\nPrimary\n\n63\n\n44\n\nMontana\n\nPrimary\n\n24\n\n23\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPrimary\n\n124\n\n54\n\nNew Mexico\n\nPrimary\n\n35\n\n21\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPrimary\n\n22\n\n22\n\na The events listed here are the initial step for choosing national convention delegates, at\n\nwhich rank-and-file voters participate. In a primary, Democratic voters mark their\n\nballot either for a presidential candidate (with delegates chosen or allocated afterwards,\n\naccording to the results) or for both a presidential candidate and individual delegate\n\ncandidates. Republican primary voters may have a third option, whereby the voter\n\nmarks the ballot for individual delegate candidates without an accompanying\n\nPresidential candidate preference vote. The caucus process is comprised of several\n\nstages (usually three or four), where rank-and-file voters participate at the first stage,\n\nto choose participants for the next stage,\n\nand so on. National convention delegates are chosen at a later stage, after the initial mass\n\nparticipation event. Under the convention system, a group of participants assembles to choose\n\nthe national delegates. Convention participants may have been chosen through the caucus\n\nCRS-15\n\nprocess, they may be party officials from throughout the state, or they may have been\n\ndesignated to attend the convention according to some other mechanism. Most state parties\n\nadopt a delegate selection system that combines, in some manner, at least two of these\n\nmethodsâthe primary, caucus, or convention.\n\nb Party-run primaries.\n\nCharacteristics of the Contemporary Nominating System\n\nLength of the Campaign.\n\nPotential candidates begin organizing their campaigns and raising money a year\n\nor more in advance of the primary season in order to be competitive. While the length\n\nof the nominating season has remained virtually unchanged, the pre-election\n\nmaneuvering by candidates may begin shortly after the previous presidential election,\n\nand exploratory committees are often in operation one or two years before the\n\nelection. In 1972, 12 of 15 major party contenders announced their candidacies no\n\nearlier than two months preceding January 1 of the election year; in 1988, all 14 major\n\nparty candidates announced before the election year began (one of whom announced\n\nin 1986). For the 2000 election, six candidates had announced by the end of April\n\n1999 and all twelve major party candidates had announced their candidacies (or the\n\nformation of their exploratory committees) by September.\n\nThe Accelerated Pace.\n\nIn 1976, the Iowa Republican Party advanced its caucus date to January 19, the\n\nsame day as Democratic Party caucuses, thereby supplanting the New Hampshire\n\nprimary in its traditional role as the first two-party delegate selection event of the\n\nnominating season. Since then, Iowa and New Hampshire have played an incipient\n\nrole in narrowing the field of candidates and setting the stage for ensuing primaries\n\nand caucuses. Other states have reacted to the influence and attention accorded Iowa\n\nand New Hampshire by advancing their dates as wellâa phenomenon known as\n\nâfront-loading.â\n\nThe 2000 calendar was the most front-loaded ever. The nominating season began\n\nin Iowa and New Hampshire, according to tradition, although events in these states\n\ntook place nearly a month earlier than in past years. The Iowa caucuses were moved\n\nto January 24 (from February 21 in 1996) and the New Hampshire primary was\n\nscheduled on February 1 (it was held on February 29 in 1996)\n\nFollowing New Hampshire, Republicans scheduled events in eight states during\n\nFebruary. But the most significant change to the calendar was the scheduling of\n\nprimaries in California, New York, and Ohio on March 7, the first date on which\n\nDemocrats may hold delegate selection events according to national rules (from which\n\nIowa and New Hampshire are exempt). Seven primaries were scheduled on the first\n\nTuesday in March in 1996, mostly in New England states, but the addition of\n\nCalifornia, New York, and Ohio in 2000 swelled the number of delegates at stake and\n\ncreated a national event with contests taking place in each region of the country.\n\nTwelve primaries and caucuses were scheduled for both parties on March 7, 2000,\n\nand caucuses for one party or the other were scheduled in an additional four states.\n\nCRS-16\n\nIn contrast, delegate selection events had been held in 23 states by the end of March\n\nin the 1992 calendar, while in 1976, delegate selection had begun in only seven states\n\nby that time.\n\nOn March 14, six southern states (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,\n\nTennessee, and Texas) hold primaries on the date previously known as âSuper\n\nTuesday.â The event was organized by mostly Democratic members of the Southern\n\nLegislative Conference in 1988 as a 14-state southern regional primary. âSuper\n\nTuesdayâ offered nearly one-third of the delegates to either convention on a single\n\nday, but met with mixed reviews. Some analysts suggested the event achieved its\n\ngoals, while others said it fell short of expectations. In 1992, five of the states which\n\nparticipated in the 1988 âSuper Tuesdayâ primaries rescheduled their events for later\n\nduring the campaign season, while Georgia officials moved their primary to the week\n\nprior to âSuper Tuesday.â In 2000, only six of the original 14 states will hold\n\nprimaries simultaneously on March 14.\n\nIncreased Number of Debates.\n\nCampaign debates have become an increasingly important aspect of the\n\nnominating process in recent years. An unprecedented number occurred during the\n\n1988 primary season: approximately 60 debates (virtually all televised locally or\n\nnationally) were held among candidates of one or both parties.6 For the 2000 election\n\ncycle, 19 debates between the Democratic or Republican candidates were held\n\nbetween October 27, 1999 and February 21, 2000, according to the Alliance for\n\nBetter Campaigns.7\n\nIn general, the increase in debates coincided with a decrease in the number of\n\nâstraw pollâ elections before and during the nominating season; these polls measure\n\ncandidate popularity among party activists at state conventions but have no bearing\n\non the selection of delegates. To some extent, candidate debates offset one of the\n\nmost frequently cited criticisms of the processâthat the combined influence of the\n\nmedia and the proliferation of primaries (with their mass audience) seem to foster an\n\nemphasis on candidate image over substantive issues. Debates will likely continue to\n\nplay an important role in the pre-nomination period.\n\n6 R.W. Apple, Jr., âPolitical Debates and Their Impact on The Race,â New York Times, Apr.\n\n23, 1988. p. 10; In 1992, some 15 debates were held during the primary season, a lower\n\nnumber than 1988, partly because of a greater degree of competition in both parties in the\n\nearlier year.\n\n7 Glenn Kessler, âIn Debates, Sponsorâs Canât Lose,â The Washington Post, Feb. 29, 2000,\n\np. E1.\n\nIII. The Nominating Conventions\n\nNational conventions combine three important functions: nomination of\n\ncandidates for the office of President and Vice President; formulation and adoption\n\nof a statement of party principlesâthe platform; and adoption of rules and procedures\n\ngoverning party activities, particularly the nomination process for presidential\n\ncandidates in the next election cycle.\n\nEvolution and Traditions of the Party Convention\n\nThe first nominating convention by one of what emerged as our two major\n\npartiesâthe Democratsâwas held in Baltimore, Maryland, between May 21 and 23,\n\n1832. Nomination by party convention replaced earlier arrangements, which included\n\nnomination by both congressional party caucuses, and by state legislatures, which\n\nprevailed through 1828.\n\nHistorical Developments.\n\nThe Caucus System. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson was nominated by a caucus\n\ncomprised of Democratic-Republican Members of Congress. The Federalists chose\n\nthe same method to renominate President John Adams. Following Jeffersonâs\n\nsuccessful election to the Presidency that year, the Democratic-Republicans continued\n\nto use the caucus method until the election of 1820, when incumbent President James\n\nMonroe was the unchallenged consensus candidate. The declining Federalists, who\n\nrelied on meetings of party leaders to nominate their choices after 1800, fielded their\n\nlast presidential ticket in 1816.\n\nEmergence of the National Party Convention. The election of 1824 brought\n\nan end to both the Democratic-Republican-dominated âera of good feelingâ and the\n\nuse of a congressional caucus as a nominating device. Although the Democratic-\n\nRepublican caucus nominated William Crawford of Georgia as its candidate, three\n\nother candidates (John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Andrew Jackson) were also\n\nnominated by rival factions within the party. After a bitter contest and an electoral\n\ncollege deadlock, Adams was elected President by the House of Representatives.\n\nA brief transitional period followed, in which state legislative caucuses and\n\nconventions and various other methods were used to nominate presidential\n\ncandidates. In 1832, the three parties contesting the electionâAnti-Masonic,\n\nDemocratic, and National Republicanâused national conventions as vehicles for\n\nnominating their presidential tickets for the first time. The use of nominating\n\nconventions reflected the growing trend toward greater democratic participation\n\nwhich characterized the âJackson Era.â\n\nâKing Caucusâ had been criticized as being both basically undemocratic and\n\ninsufficiently reflective of the popular choice of candidates. The national convention,\n\nby comparison, was comprised of delegates chosen by party voters, activists and\n\nofficeholders in each state. It was a natural extension, on the national level, of the\n\nCRS-18\n\nparty conventions used to nominate elected officials on the county and state levels.\n\nThe Anti-Masonic Party was the first to use the national convention, which met\n\nin Baltimore in September 1831, to choose William Wirt as its candidate; the\n\nDemocrats and National Republicans followed suit the next year. By 1840, the\n\nDemocrats and Whigs had adopted the national convention as the standard\n\nnominating device, which the major parties have used without exception ever since.\n\nClassic Elements of the National Convention.\n\nFor over a century, national conventions were often unruly, strongly contested\n\ngatherings. It was common for a number of names to be placed in nomination, with\n\nno single candidate possessing the requisite number of votes to win on the first ballot.\n\nIn 1860, the Democrats were unable to decide on a candidate after ten days and\n\nwere forced to reconvene six weeks later in another city to finalize their selection. On\n\nother occasions, many ballots and extensive political maneuvering were required\n\nbefore a presidential candidate could be nominated. Various party rules and political\n\npractices contributed to these characteristics.\n\nThe Two-Thirds Rule and Dark-Horse Candidates. A major factor was the\n\nDemocratic Party requirement, adopted at the 1832 convention and not abandoned\n\nuntil 1936, that the partyâs nominee receive a two-thirds majority of delegate votes.\n\nThe record for the number of ballots cast is held by the Democrats, who required 103\n\nballots to nominate John W. Davis in the 1924 national convention.8\n\nFear of deadlock among the most widely-known candidates led to the occasional\n\nemergence of a âdark horseâ candidateâa minor candidate or party figure who had\n\nnot originally been thought of as a candidateâas a compromise choice. James K.\n\nPolk of Tennessee, nominated by the Democrats in 1844, is often cited as the first\n\ndark horse candidate to win nomination. In 1936, the Democrats adopted rules\n\nchanges requiring only a simple majority for nomination, largely ending the lengthy\n\nballoting which had occasionally resulted in the selection of dark horse candidates.\n\nThe Smoke-Filled Room. Convention deadlock was not unknown among the\n\nRepublicans, despite the fact that they required only a simple majority to nominate.\n\nAt their 1920 convention, Ohio Senator Warren Harding emerged as a compromise\n\ncandidate on the 10th ballot. According to legend, Hardingâs nomination was\n\nengineered at a secret late-night meeting of party leaders held in a hotel suite, giving\n\nrise to an enduring element of national convention loreâselection of the presidential\n\nnominee in âthe smoke-filled room.â The term came to imply choice of a nominee by\n\na small group of party leaders meeting out of the view of public scrutiny.\n\nFavorite Sons. The âfavorite sonâ candidacy is another once-common device\n\nwhich is seen much less frequently in contemporary national conventions. Favorite\n\n8 The Republican record is held by the 1880 convention, which took 36 ballots to nominate\n\nJames Garfield.\n\nCRS-19\n\nsons were political figures (often Governors, Senators, or Representatives) who ran\n\nfor the Presidency, usually campaigning only in their home states, for the purpose of\n\nretaining control of state delegations. Once at a convention, the favorite son typically\n\nused his delegates as bargaining chips, to influence the party platform, to help secure\n\nthe nomination for a preferred candidate, to seek future political favors, or to enhance\n\nhis own prospects as vice presidential nominee.\n\nA 1972 Democratic Party rules change required that candidates secure pledges\n\nof support from at least 50 delegates, not more than 20 of whom can be from a single\n\nstate. This rule, which essentially required candidates to secure at least a modest level\n\nof support from a more geographically diverse representation of delegates, further\n\nserved to reduce the number of names placed in nomination at subsequent\n\nconventions. Similarly, current Republican Party rules require that candidates must\n\nbe able to demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from five or more\n\nstates in order to have their names placed in nomination.\n\nThe decline of favorite son candidacies in both parties is also attributed to the\n\nchanging nature of the pre-convention nomination process: fewer uncommitted\n\ndelegates are elected in the primaries and caucuses. Moreover, as state and local\n\nparty leaders gradually lost control of the selection process, they were unable to keep\n\ndelegates from supporting major candidates for the nomination.\n\nThe Modern Convention\n\nRatifying the Party Choice.\n\nThroughout most of the first half of the 20th century, national conventions were\n\nfrequently the scene of contentious struggles for the presidential nomination. It was\n\nnot uncommon for a convention to open without a clear favorite and with no\n\ncandidate holding the votes needed to win the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nSince that time, the choice of nominees has been much less likely to be made at\n\nthe convention. Although there can beâand frequently areâspirited controversies\n\nover rival candidacies, the nominee today is usually known well in advance of the\n\nconvention, based on an accumulation of a comfortable majority of delegate votes.\n\nAs a result, the convention now characteristically serves largely to ratify a choice\n\nalready arrived at by party primaries, caucuses and state conventions.\n\nTo a large extent, this change has resulted from a corresponding change in how\n\nconvention delegates are chosen. Traditionally, most delegates were selected by party\n\nleaders and officials. Since World War II, and especially since the 1970s, increased\n\nreliance on caucuses and primaries has opened the delegate selection process to larger\n\nnumbers of party activists and the voting public, effectively wresting control from\n\nstate and national party professionals. Primary voters usually declare their presidential\n\ncandidate choice at the same time as they indicate their choice of convention\n\ndelegates.\n\nCRS-20\n\nMoreover, despite the large numbers of candidates who have entered the race\n\nin recent elections (at least when no incumbent was running in a particular party), the\n\nincreasing length of the primary and caucus season has tended to eliminate weaker\n\ncandidates, winnowing the field to one or two major contenders. In almost every\n\nconvention since 1956, one candidate has gone to each partyâs convention with a\n\nclear, strong lead in delegate totals.\n\nThe Influence of Television.\n\nSince 1952, when full-scale television coverage began, the national convention\n\nhas been transformed from a gathering of the party faithful to a media event which\n\nattracts widespread national interest. Television coverage led to a complete\n\nreorganization of scheduling and events. Convention sessions, once primarily\n\nconducted during the day, are now largely scheduled for peak viewing hours, in order\n\nto attract the widest television audience. The once-leisurely pace of events has been\n\ntightened, time-consuming demonstrations are more strictly limited, and lengthy\n\nspeeches have largely been curtailed or eliminated.\n\nEmphasis has been placed on producing stage-set platforms geared more to\n\ntelevision viewers than convention participants. Both parties also make increasing use\n\nof professionally produced films on the candidates and the party. Included as an\n\nintegral part of the convention proceedings, these serve the dual purpose of\n\nentertaining delegates and broadcasting a carefully tailored image and message to\n\nviewers nationwide.\n\nAs of 1992, the three major commercial television networks announced a\n\nreduction in convention coverage, citing increased costs and declining viewer interest.\n\nMore extensive, even âgavel-to-gavel,â convention coverage has been provided,\n\nhowever, by the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), Cable News Network (CNN),\n\nand C-SPAN.\n\nPlanning the Convention\n\nThe âCallâ.\n\nThe official âcallâ to the convention, customarily issued by the national\n\ncommittees of the two major parties some 18 months in advance, announces the dates\n\nand site of the national convention. The call also includes information on delegate\n\nallocation and rules for deciding disputed delegate credentials. In recent years, the\n\nDemocrats have included rules governing affirmative action in the delegate selection\n\nprocess, activities of convention committees, and procedures and scheduling for\n\nvarious committees and convention events.\n\nTiming and Location of National Conventions.\n\nDuring the 20th century, national party conventions have come to be held during\n\nthe summer immediately preceding the opening of the general election campaign for\n\nPresident. Since 1952, all conventions have been held in July or August. In a\n\nCRS-21\n\ntradition that dates to 1932, the party out of power has convened first, usually about\n\na month before the party holding the Presidency. In 2000, the Republican National\n\nConvention is scheduled to be held from July 31-August 3 in Philadelphia, while the\n\nDemocrats will meet from August 14-17 in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 19th century, difficulties of travel led to the selection of centrally located\n\ncities as convention sites. Baltimore, located midway along the Atlantic seaboard,\n\nwas a favorite choice in early years. As the center of population moved west,\n\nChicago and other midwestern cities were more frequently selected. With the advent\n\nof air travel and further population growth in the west, south, and southwest, a\n\nbroader range of locations has been considered. Chicago has been host to the greatest\n\nnumber of conventions (11 Democratic and 14 Republican).\n\nTable 2.

Selection of sites for national party conventions is a lengthy\n\nprocess in which facilities, security arrangements, and level of assistance offered by\n\nlocal governments are all considered by a special committee of the partiesâ national\n\ncommittees. An incumbent Presidentâs choice of location may also be an important\n\nfactor in his partyâs decision. State and local governments actively seek conventions\n\ndue to the economic benefits conferred by the presence of large numbers of delegates,\n\nparty officials and media representatives, as well as the presumably favorable national\n\npublicity generated by a national convention.\n\nThe Delegates.\n\nDelegates to national political conventions are chosen by various methods, as\n\ndetailed in Chapter II. The number of delegates is established by the respective party\n\ncommittee and has risen over the years. In 2000, the Democratic National\n\nConvention will be comprised of 4,337 delegates and 610 alternates, while the\n\nRepublicans select 2,066 delegates and an equal number of alternates.

The Permanent Chair, who presides for the balance of the convention, is\n\nusually a senior party figure, most often the party leader in the House of\n\nRepresentatives. (Since 1972, the Democrats have required that the permanent\n\nchairmanship alternate between the sexes every four years.) In 1996, House Speaker\n\nNewt Gingrich (GA) chaired the Republican National Convention, while Senate\n\nMinority Leader Tom Daschle (SD) and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt\n\n(MO) co-chaired the Democratic National Convention.\n\nConvention Committees.\n\nCommittees of the national conventions prepare reports for the conventions on\n\ndelegate credentials, rules of procedure, and party platforms. The full convention\n\nratifies or amends the respective recommendations from each of these committees.\n\nPermanent Organization. The Permanent Organization Committee, which\n\nfunctions continuously between conventions, has as its primary role the selection of\n\nconvention officers. As part of its 1972 reforms, the Democrats abolished the\n\nPermanent Organization Committee, transferring its duties to the Rules Committee.\n\nCredentials. The Credentials Committees of both parties examine and rule on\n\nthe accreditation of state delegations to the conventions. In closely contested or\n\nunusually acrimonious nomination campaigns, the Credentials Committees\n\noccasionally consider conflicting claims for recognition by competing slates of\n\ndelegates. The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee\n\nmonitors the delegate selection process to ensure party rules are observed.\n\nRules. The Rules Committees of the two parties recommend procedures under\n\nwhich the national conventions are conducted.\n\nPlatform. The first party platform was adopted by the Democrats at their 1840\n\nnational convention. The task of drafting the platforms of the two major parties is the\n\nresponsibility of the Platform Committees, which draft the document for the\n\nconventionsâ approval. Typically, these committees hold hearings around the country\n\nprior to the convention at which public views on policy questions are solicited.\n\nThe Convention Day-by-Day\n\nContemporary national conventions are generally held over a four-day period,\n\nwith both parties observing similar schedules. The proceedings are regularly\n\nCRS-25\n\ninterspersed with films honoring party figures. A continuing procession of party\n\nnotables, usually selected to reflect the party's diversity, offer short speeches\n\nthroughout the proceedings, while clergymen from various denominations offer\n\ninvocations and benedictions to open and close each session.\n\nThe following day-by-day account provides a general overview of the course of\n\nevents at a typical national convention. Variations in scheduling, both planned and\n\nthose necessitated by time-consuming floor procedures, are not uncommon.\n\nDay One.\n\nThe first day of a national convention is generally devoted to routine business.\n\nThe convention is called to order by the national party chair, the roll of delegations\n\nis called, and the temporary chair is elected. Welcoming speeches are delivered by the\n\nmayor of the host city and often the governor of the state in which the convention is\n\nheld. Committee appointments, which have been previously announced, are ratified.\n\nThe Democrats generally install permanent convention officers at the first session,\n\nwhile the Republicans, in recent years, have completed adoption of credentials, rules,\n\nand the party platform before turning over convention proceedings to the permanent\n\nchair, usually on the second or third day.\n\nThe Democratic Convention keynote address is also delivered on the first day\n\nof convention proceedings. The Republicans tend to schedule keynote speeches for\n\nlater in the convention, usually at the second session.\n\nThe Keynote Address.\n\nThe keynote address sets the themes and tone of the convention and often of the\n\ngeneral election campaign to follow. Keynote speakers are usually prominent office\n\nholders or party officials, chosen because of their national appeal and speaking ability,\n\nor because they may be viewed as ârising starsâ in the party.\n\nThe keynote address is highly partisan in tone and content. It extols the party\n\nrecord and the incumbent President, when the party holds the White House. It attacks\n\nthe opposition candidates, policies, and record. Perhaps the most famous such\n\naddress was delivered at the 1896 Democratic National Convention by William\n\nJennings Bryan of Nebraska. His passionate attack on the gold standard, coupled with\n\na plea for free silver (âYou shall not crucify mankind on a cross of goldâ) stampeded\n\nthe convention and led to his own nomination.

Routine convention business often spills over into the second day\n\nof proceedings, as reports of the credentials, rules, and platform committees are\n\ndebated and approved by the delegates. While the acceptance of delegate credentials\n\nis usually a perfunctory procedure, in some years credentials have been hotly\n\ncontested as rival slates of delegates from the same state, representing contending\n\nfactions, were presented.\n\nIn 1968, the Democratic National Convention voted to unseat the racially\n\nsegregated Mississippi Regular Democratic delegation and replace it with the rival,\n\nintegrated Freedom Democratic delegation. Four years later, in 1972, challenges to\n\nboth the California and Illinois Democratic delegations resulted in lengthy struggles\n\non the floor. These struggles grew out of infighting between supporters and\n\nopponents of candidate George McGovern and focused on whether the delegations\n\nhad been elected in accordance with newly adopted reform rules. In both cases, the\n\npro-McGovern delegations were seated, helping insure nomination of the South\n\nDakota Senator and constituting a major defeat for more traditional party leaders.\n\nRules. Adoption of the Rules Committee report, setting convention procedures,\n\nis another important function usually completed on the second day of the convention.\n\nConsideration of the committee report has occasionally been accompanied by spirited\n\ndebate, particularly in a close convention when delegates have sought to boost their\n\ncandidate's chances by securing rules changes.\n\nAt the 1976 Republican Convention, supporters of Ronald Reagan\n\nunsuccessfully sought a rules change which would have required candidates for the\n\nnomination to name their vice presidential running mate before the first ballot. Failure\n\nto comply with the proposed rule change would have freed all delegates from their\n\ncustomary pledge to vote for the candidate to whom they were committed on the first\n\nround. Reagan supporters hoped that adoption of the rule might force opposing\n\ncandidate Gerald Ford to name a running mate unacceptable to some of his committed\n\ndelegates, and thus enhance Reaganâs chances of nomination.\n\nCRS-28\n\nPlatform. Adoption of the party platform is another task usually completed on\n\nthe second day of a convention, although consideration of proposed amendments to\n\nthe Platform Committee draft will occasionally continue into the third day.\n\nThe party platform, a statement of principles and policy proposals, is prepared\n\nin advance by the Platform Committee, but is sometimes amended on the floor\n\nthrough minority reports. These reports are filed by those who were unsuccessful in\n\nincorporating their views into the draft version. Consideration of minority reports by\n\nthe convention is contingent upon obtaining a threshold level of delegate support.\n\nThe process of platform approval has also occasionally led to spirited struggles\n\nbetween contending convention factions, often allied with opposing candidates. In\n\n1984, for instance, candidate Jesse Jackson sought platform âplanksâ (statements of\n\ndistinct party policies) renouncing âfirst useâ of nuclear weapons, denouncing runoff\n\nprimary elections (deemed discriminatory to black candidates), and embracing the use\n\nof quotas to combat racial discrimination, all controversial positions considered by\n\nopponents as pushing the party too far to the âleft.â Convention forces loyal to\n\neventual nominee Walter Mondale rejected all three proposals, although compromise\n\nlanguage allegedly acceptable to Jackson was eventually adopted.\n\nPlatforms are intended to maintain the loyalty of committed party activists, while\n\nattracting the support and votes of political independents. As such, they generally\n\navoid proposals which might be interpreted as extreme. On the occasions when party\n\nplatforms have incorporated allegedly radical proposals of the left or right, they have\n\ntended to damage the election chances of the presidential ticket.\n\nAlthough serving as a statement of principles and intentions, party platforms are\n\nnot binding. Presidents, once in office, may choose to ignore the pledges made by the\n\nparty in convention. For example, in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected on a\n\nplatform calling for increased austerity and a balanced budget. Once in office,\n\nhowever, his administration undertook a program of spending measuresâthe New\n\nDealâintended to stimulate the economy and end the Depression. Furthermore,\n\nRepublican platforms in 1980, 1984, and 1988 called for a balanced federal budget,\n\nbut budget deficits throughout this period continued to increase.\n\nDay Three.\n\nThe third day of national conventions is usually reserved for the nomination of\n\nthe presidential candidate. In recent years, the nomination is accomplished in one\n\nevening, with only one ballot. The last national convention requiring more than one\n\nballot to nominate a presidential candidate was the 1952 Democratic National\n\nConvention, in which Adlai Stevenson was chosen on the third round of voting.\n\nThe Nominating Speech. Prominent or promising party figures are usually\n\ngiven the task of placing the names of candidates in nomination, followed by a series\n\nof seconding speeches. The classic form of nominating speech, which generally\n\nincluded a long list of the candidateâs strengths and achievements, avoided naming the\n\ncandidate until the final paragraph. This device, known as âthe man who,â was\n\nCRS-29\n\nintended to postpone the inevitable and time-consuming demonstrations of delegate\n\nsupport which inevitably followed mention of the candidateâs name. This classic\n\nformulation has largely disappeared from contemporary nomination speeches.\n\nBalloting. Following completion of the nominating and seconding speeches, the\n\nrole of states is called, by the clerk of the convention, a position usually filled by the\n\npermanent secretary of the partyâs national committee. The tally of delegate votes in\n\neach state is announced by the chair of the delegation, often the partyâs highest\n\nranking elected official in the state. A running count of vote totals is maintained,\n\nusually culminating in a âspontaneousâ demonstration for the nominee when he or she\n\nreceives enough votes to go âover the topâ to secure the nomination. Following the\n\ncompletion of balloting, the chair usually entertains a motion to demonstrate party\n\nunity by making the nomination unanimous by acclamation. In 1984, the Republicans\n\ndeparted from tradition by nominating incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice\n\nPresident George Bush in a joint ballot.\n\nDay Four.\n\nThe fourth day of the convention is usually dominated by the nomination of the\n\nvice presidential candidate and the presidential and vice presidential nomineesâ\n\nacceptance speeches.\n\nNominating the Vice President. In a current practice embraced by both parties,\n\nthe choice of a vice presidential nominee remains the prerogative of the presidential\n\ncandidate. Franklin Roosevelt (particularly in 1940 and 1944) is generally regarded\n\nas the first President who was able to impose his personal vice presidential choice.\n\nIn 1948, Republican nominee Thomas Dewey followed suit when he chose Earl\n\nWarren as his running mate. Prior to these precedents, party leaders usually chose the\n\nvice presidential nominee, often an unsuccessful presidential candidate who had wide\n\nsupport, or who was perceived as adding geographical balance to the ticket.\n\nThe concept of ticket balance remains an active element in contemporary\n\nnominations, with such factors as geography, age of vice presidential nominee, and\n\npolitical ideology (i.e., a presidential nominee perceived as liberal will often choose\n\na more conservative running mate, and vice versa) figuring in the nominee's choice.\n\nThat choice is rarely challenged, although a notable deviation from this tradition\n\noccurred in 1956, when Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson encouraged open\n\nnominations for Vice President from the convention floor. A spirited contest ensued,\n\nin which Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver bested a number of challengers on the\n\nthird ballot, including Senators Albert Gore, Sr. (TN), John F. Kennedy (MA), Hubert\n\nHumphrey (MN), and New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner.\n\nIncumbent Presidents seeking reelection usually select their current Vice\n\nPresidents as running mates, in the interest of continuity and party unity, although\n\nthere have been occasional efforts to deny an incumbent Vice President a place on the\n\nticket. For instance, in 1956, some Republican leaders unsuccessfully urged President\n\nEisenhower to replace Vice President Nixon. More recently, in 1976, Vice President\n\nNelson Rockefeller announced that he would not seek the nomination, an action\n\nCRS-30\n\nwidely interpreted at the time as an effort to preserve party unity by opening the slot\n\nfor a more conservative candidate and to bolster President Fordâs candidacy.\n\nThe procedure for nominating the vice presidential candidates mirrors that for\n\nthe presidential candidates, with the name placed in nomination by a prominent party\n\nleader, seconded by others, and followed by a roll call of the states (often a motion\n\nto nominate by acclamation occurs in place of the roll call).\n\nAcceptance Speeches. Following his or her nomination, the vice presidential\n\ncandidate delivers an acceptance speech which is followed by the last major activity\n\nof the conventionâthe presidential nomineeâs acceptance speech.\n\nDemocratic nominee Franklin Roosevelt, in 1932, was the first candidate both\n\nto appear at a national convention, and to deliver his acceptance in person. Prior to\n\nthat time, a committee of party dignitaries customarily visited the candidate to inform\n\nhim of his nomination. Republican nominee Thomas Dewey inaugurated this practice\n\nin the GOP in 1944.\n\nThe candidateâs acceptance speech ranks with the keynote address as one of the\n\nhighlights of the convention, and it serves as its finale. It provides an opportunity for\n\nthe nominee to establish the tone, content, and general themes of the election\n\ncampaign to come, while providing incumbent Presidents running for reelection with\n\nthe opportunity to defend their record and seek a renewed mandate from the voters.\n\nAdjournment. Immediately following the nomineeâs acceptance speech, the\n\npresidential nominee is joined on the podium by the vice presidential nominee, their\n\nspouses, families, defeated rivals and other party leaders for the traditional unity pose.\n\nShortly afterwards, the convention is adjourned sine die.\n\nCRS-31\n\nIV. The General Election\n\nAdjournment of the national nominating conventions marks the beginning of the\n\nnext phase of the presidential election processâthe general election campaign. In the\n\nmonths following the conventions, the candidates, parties, and campaign organizations\n\nseek to build a winning popular and electoral vote coalition.\n\nLabor Day has traditionally marked the start of the general election campaign.\n\nAlthough party nominees make campaign appearances throughout the summer,\n\nscheduling and media advertising begin in earnest in September. Dramatic âkickoffâ\n\nevents seek to draw the greatest possible attention to the national ticket. Democratic\n\nnominees traditionally began their campaigns with a large Labor Day rally in Detroit's\n\nCadillac Square. However, in recent years, both parties have varied the site.\n\nCampaign Structure\n\nImmediately following the conventions, the nominees are faced with several tasks.\n\nThese include uniting the party behind the candidates, establishing a general election\n\ncampaign organization, and preparing a campaign plan.\n\nCampaign Organizations.\n\nIn recent years, presidential campaigns have been managed by separate candidate-\n\ncentered organizations, ad-hoc groups assembled for the specific purpose of winning\n\nthe election. After the conventions, these committees are usually expanded from the\n\nnomineeâs primary organization to include key party professionals and staff from the\n\ncampaigns of rival contenders for the nomination.\n\nThe campaign organization prepares the campaign plan, schedules appearances\n\nby the nominees and surrogate campaigners, conducts opposition and survey research,\n\nmanages the national media campaign, and conducts both voter registration and get-\n\nout-the-vote (GOTV) drives. The organization is organized on the national, state, and\n\nlocal levels, overlapping, especially on the local level, existing party structures. The\n\ncampaign organization seeks to broaden the candidateâs appeal beyond committed\n\npartisans, bringing his or her message to the largest number of independent voters\n\npossible and to dissatisfied members of the other party.\n\nCampaign Plans.\n\nCampaign plans detail the strategy and tactics which the campaign organizations\n\nand candidates hope will bring a winning combination of electoral and popular votes\n\nin the general election. They specify the issues to be emphasized by the nominees and\n\naspects of the candidatesâ personal image they hope to project to the voters. They\n\ninclude: plans of attack on the platform, issues, and candidates of the opposition;\n\ntargeting of socioeconomic, ethnic, and religious groups deemed to be most amenable\n\nto the campaign message; assessments of the ticketâs strengths and weaknesses in\n\nvarious states; and decisions on which geographic areas the candidates should\n\nconcentrate in order to assemble an electoral college majority.\n\nCRS-32\n\nCampaign plans, while often quite detailed, tend to be flexible. They seek to\n\nanticipate possible events, emerging issues, and fluctuations in voter attitudes, allowing\n\ncandidate and organization activities to be adjusted or âfine tunedâ in order to\n\nstrengthen the ticket as needed and to most effectively allocate resources.\n\nCandidate Activity\n\nThe contemporary model of presidential candidates crisscrossing the country on\n\ncampaign tours, participating in a wide variety of political gatherings, is actually a fairly\n\nrecent innovation in presidential campaign activity.\n\nTraditional MethodsâThe Front Porch Campaign.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, and well into the 20th, campaigns were conducted\n\nlargely at grassroots levels by âsurrogatesââparty leaders and officeholders who spoke\n\nfor the national ticket. With a few notable exceptionsâin 1896, Democratic nominee\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan toured the country by rail in his impassioned, yet unsuccessful,\n\ncampaign, nominees conducted âfront porch campaigns,â staying at home, receiving\n\ngroups of supporters, and issuing occasional statements to the press.\n\nThe Modern Campaign Style.\n\nActive campaigning by presidential candidates became more common in the 20th\n\ncentury. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt conducted the first modern âwhistle stopâ\n\ncampaign, traveling 13,000 miles by train and visiting 36 states. In succeeding\n\nelections, the âwhistle stopâ campaign, in which candidates toured the country by train,\n\ndelivering speeches from the rear platforms, became a regular fixture of presidential\n\npolitics. President Harry Truman apparently holds the record, covering 32,000 miles\n\nand averaging 10 speeches a day in his successful 1948 election bid.\n\nDuring the same period, candidates made increasing use of air travel, another area\n\nin which Roosevelt pioneered. In 1932, he flew from New York to Chicago to accept\n\nthe Democratic nomination, the first candidate to do so in person. Modern presidential\n\ncampaigns are almost exclusively conducted by air, with the candidates able to cover\n\nboth coasts in a single day. Air travel enables candidates to touch base in media\n\nmarkets in different parts of the country on the same day, maximizing their television\n\nexposure to voters. Sometimes, the candidatesâ appearances are confined to airport\n\nrallies, after which the campaign plane flies to another metropolitan area.\n\nThe Rose Garden Campaign.\n\nA variation of the front porch campaign survives in contemporary presidential\n\nelectoral politics. Sitting Presidents running for reelection, seeking both to maximize\n\nthe advantages of incumbency and to project a âpresidentialâ image, are likely to make\n\nuse of the âRose Gardenâ campaign style. They maintain a limited campaign schedule,\n\nwhile carrying out their duties as President. The incumbent makes well publicized use\n\nof the perquisites of the Presidency, including the use of the Presidentâs airplaneâAir\n\nForce One, scheduling frequent announcements and activities at the White House, and\n\nCRS-33\n\ndelivering grants and other federal benefits in states and localities which, it is hoped,\n\ncontribute to the reelection effortâs success.\n\nTelevision Dominated Presidential Campaigns\n\nThe 1930s and 1940s saw the increasing use of radio as a major campaign\n\ncommunications tool. The advent of widespread commercial television broadcasting\n\nin the late 1940s added a further dimension. With its use of compelling video images,\n\nTV eventually revolutionized presidential contests. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower\n\nbecame the first presidential candidate to make systematic use of the new medium,\n\nspending almost $2,000,000 on television advertising.9 The Eisenhower campaign\n\nmessages, the first created by advertising professionals, were credited with creating a\n\nfavorable image of the GOP candidate, contributing substantially to his victory.\n\nSince that time, television has come increasingly to dominate presidential election\n\ncampaigns. Its influence is felt in three separate, but related areas: paid political\n\nadvertising, news coverage, and candidate debates.\n\nPaid Advertising.\n\nTelevised political advertising today comprises the largest single expense in any\n\npresidential general election campaign. In 1996, more than 60% of the money spent\n\nby the Clinton and Dole general election campaigns (by the candidates and national\n\nparties) was devoted to electronic media advertising, most all of it for television.10\n\nSince the advent of broadcast political advertising, first on radio and later TV,\n\ncandidate messages have grown progressively shorter. The standard 30-minute\n\nbroadcast speech by a nominee was succeeded by the five-minute spot, which in turn\n\nhas yielded to the 30- and 60-second messages most common in todayâs campaigns.\n\nTelevised political advertising, which has achieved a high degree of technical\n\nsophistication, generally falls into either of two categories: positive or negative. Both\n\napproaches are likely to be used, aired in different markets at different times, as\n\ndictated by the campaign plan and changing circumstances.\n\nPositive Messages. Positive political advertising seeks to portray the candidate\n\nand issues in a favorable light. The candidate, his family, career achievements, and\n\nissue identifications are emphasized. If he is an incumbent running for reelection, the\n\nachievements of his administration are detailed. Positive campaign spots generally seek\n\nto solidify party support and attract undecided voters of either party.\n\n9 Stanley Kelly, Professional Public Relations and Political Power (Baltimore: Johns\n\nHopkins Press, 1956), p. 161, 162.\n\n10 Campaign Study Group, as reported in: Ira Chinoy, âIn Presidential Race, TV Ads Were\n\nBiggest â96 Cost By Far,â Washington Post, Mar. 31, 1997, p. A19.\n\nCRS-34\n\nNegative Messages. So-called negative, or comparative, political advertising has\n\nbeen used increasingly in recent years. It conveys or seeks to evoke a basically\n\nunfavorable view of the opposing candidate or party, often by means of comparison\n\nwith the sponsoring candidate. Negative spots are intended to establish doubts among\n\nthe public about a candidate or his policies, in hopes of persuading them to vote\n\nagainst that candidate or party, or not to vote at all.\n\nNews Coverage.\n\nTelevision news is "
