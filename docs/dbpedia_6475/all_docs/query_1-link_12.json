Your voting rights may be restored following the completion of your sentence, including prison term, probation, and parole. If you have been convicted of more than one felony offense, you must apply to restore your voting rights. Some sentences have a time limit dependent on the type of conviction. Persons sentenced to lifetime probation are not eligible for rights restoration under statute.\n\nPretrial detention and misdemeanors do not restrict your voting rights.\n\nVoters without traditional residence:\n\nIn Arizona, a person may not be refused voter registration or declared unqualified to vote because they do not live in a permanent, private, or fixed structure. Any of the following may be used as a registration address in the state:\n\nA homeless shelter\n\nA temporary place for living that the individual is a resident of (halfway house, transitional housing, etc.)\n\nThe county courthouse in the county in which the resident resides\n\nA general delivery address for a post office covering the location where the registrant is a resident\n\nIf you use your states Registration form, you must provide proof of citizenship in order to register.\n\nThe simplest form to use for your voter registration in Arizona is the Standard Federal Registration Form You can find the federal standardized form in English here and in Spanish here. For more language options go here.\n\nIf you register to vote using the Arizona State Registration form, the following will serve as proof of citizenship and no additional documents are needed:\n\nAn Arizona driver license or non-operating identification number issued after October 1, 1996:\n\nA Tribal Identification number (Bureau of Indian Affairs Card Number, Tribal Treaty Card Number, or Tribal Enrollment Number)\n\nThe number from your certificate of naturalization\n\nIf you do not have the above information, you must attach proof of citizenship to the form.

The following is a list of acceptable forms:\n\nA legible photocopy of a birth certificate that verifies citizenship and supporting legal documentation (i.e. marriage certificate) if the name on the birth certificate is not the same as your current legal name\n\nA legible photocopy of pertinent pages of a United States passport identifying the applicant\n\nPresentation to the County Recorder of United States naturalization documents\n\nIndian Census Number, Bureau of Indian Affairs Card Number, Tribal Treaty Card Number or Tribal Enrollment Number\n\nA legible photocopy of a Tribal Certificate of Indian Blood or Tribal or Bureau of Indian Affairs Affidavit of Birth.\n\nIf you are registered in Arizona and use the registration form because you move within a county, change your name, or change your political party affiliation, you do not need to provide photocopies of proof of citizenship. You only need to provide proof of citizenship if you are a new resident in an Arizona county.\n\nYou have several accessible voting options.\n\nAccessible Polling Places:\n\nAll polling locations will provide handicap parking and be able to accommodate people in wheelchairs, as well as people with visual or hearing impairments. If you need modifications to your polling location please contact your county recorder.\n\nAccessible Voting Systems:\n\nAll polling locations/voting centers must have an accessible voting device available for use. Each polling location will also have magnifying instruments, large print versions of pamphlets and trained poll workers ready to assist if needed.\n\nCurbside Voting:\n\nIf you are unable to enter the polling location you may ask that a ballot be brought to you by a poll worker.\n\nPermanent Early Voting:\n\nIf you have a permanent physical disability, you may request to be placed on the Permanent Early Voter List.

This includes getting assistance at the polling place by poll workers from two different parties, or from someone who you choose to help you.\n\nHAVA Hotline:\n\nThe Help America Vote Act (HAVA) can help people who have questions about voting with disabilities. The Arizona Center for Disability Law runs a hotline to help answer questions. You can call them at 602-274-6287 or 1-800-927-2260 anytime from 7am-7pm on Election Day.\n\nFor more information, you can utilize the American Association of People With Disabilities (AAPD) resource.\n\nThe voting systems used in Arizona are Optical Scan and DRE.\n\nOptical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.\n\nDirect Recording Electronic (DRE): All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.\n\nThere are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.\n\nSome of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.\n\nYou let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource."
