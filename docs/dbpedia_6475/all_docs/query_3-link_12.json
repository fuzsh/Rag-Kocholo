In addition the web version contains maps and tables of all this data plus Presidential general results back to 1789. Note: Democrats are represented in red and Republicans in blue contrary to the more recent practice.\n\nPresidential Elections by Congressional District\n\nBy congressional district (103rd–116th Congress [1992-2018])\n\nBy county (1976–2004)\n\nResults available in .csv.\n\nNotes on the data from www.polidata.org:\n\n\"Only a few states compile the results of the presidential election by congressional district. Therefore, data must be collected from local election offices. This normally means precinct-level election results. There are 450 counties that include a portion of more than one congressional district. Also, due to the presence of split precincts and centrally counted absentee and early votes, there may not be a hard-and-fast number for some districts and there may be slight variations amongst the few sources for these data.\n\n\"There are only a handful of projects that bother to undertake this months-long project. While commercial enterprises are involved in these projects, this is not a big money project. POLIDATA has been involved with the development of these data since 1984.\"\n\nDave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Elections\n\n-U.S. House of Representative general elections data by state, congressional district, county, and New England towns (1992–present)-Senate general elections data at the state and county level (1990–present)-Voter registration and turnout data for all 50 states, counties, and New England towns (1992–present)-Data in Excel.

Votes from each biennial election are tallied by Democratic and Republican candidate and are further grouped by state and congressional district. The party of the incumbent is also indicated. These data are arranged by election year in 48 separate files. Data come from CQ publications which were based on corrected ICPSR collections.\n\nConstituency-Level Elections Archive (CLEA)\n\nMajor archive of legislative election data at the constituency level. For the US, you can easily get all House and Senate elections in multiple formats (Stata, SPSS, R, Excel) ready for analysis. Use the subsetting tool to just get US elections or specific years (accessed separately through the lower chamber and upper chamber archive links).\n\nU.S. House Primary Election Results (1956-2010)\n\nPrimary election returns from all Democratic and Republican primaries for the US House of Representatives for 1956-2010 at the Congressional District level.

The variables for the presidential vote include the percentages of ballots cast for major and \"significant\" minor party candidates, and estimates of voter turnout in the presidential elections. There are similar variables for the congressional vote except that returns are reported for parties and not for candidates. Congressional district numbers are also reported for each county for every election.\n\nVital Statistics on American Politics—Elections\n\nTime-series statistics on American elections, including:\n\nparty competition, by region (1860–2010)\n\npopular vote and seats in House elections, by Party (1896–2010)\n\ndivided government, by Congress (1861–2013)\n\nmean turnover in the House, by decade (1789–2010)\n\nincumbent re-election rates (1960–2010)\n\nlosses by president's party in midterm elections (1862–2010)\n\nminority elected officials (various years)\n\nTables in Excel or .csv format. For tables that report only one or a small number of years, consult previous editions (click Browse Previous Editions or view in print at JK274 .V58 Firestone).\n\nState Legislative Election Returns, 1967-2022\n\nState legislative election returns 1967-2022. Each of the more than 400,000 observations provides general election return totals for an individual candidate who ran for state legislative office (with some observations for primaries and special election returns in various years). Candidates are uniquely identified and names are standardized. The data includes numerous district, election, and candidate variables, including type of district, redistricting status, incumbency status, vote share, uncontested elections, chamber details, prior experience, tenure, and term length. There is also a version of the dataset that has been reshaped so that the unit of analysis is an individual election contest, which is useful for analyzing the proportion of the two-party vote going to Democrats/Republicans. This updates the public version of SLERs 1967-2016.\n\nThe Downballot Election Data Guide\n\nPresidential general election returns and some statewide returns (e.g., governor, senator, state attorney general, etc.) broken down by congressional district and state legislative district (including different vintages). Also tracks state legislative special elections and open seats, as well as relationships of legislative districts to each other (upper to lower) as well as to congressional districts and counties. Excellent methodology document explains sourcing and calculation methods and well illustrates the complexities of electoral geographies. Data in Google sheets, generally 2012-present.\n\nNCSL Ballot Measures Dataset\n\nContains all U.S. state ballot measures attempted from 1902– 2016 compiled directly from the National Conference of State Legislatures’ (NCSL) “Ballot Measures Database” (see NCSL's up-to-date database). The database includes all types of ballot measures (e.g., legislative referendum, initiative, popular referendum), type of election (e.g., general, primary, special), whether a measure passed or failed, the percentage yes votes for the measure, and the category of topic area (as coded by NCSL). Data in Excel, .csv, and Stata formats.\n\nAmerican Local Government Elections Database, 1989–2021\n\nThe most comprehensive database of local elections in the United States. Includes election returns on more than 57,000 contests and ~78,000 unique candidates from 1989–2021 across most medium and large-sized cities, counties, prosecutor districts, and school districts with a population over 50,000. Offices covered: mayors, city councils, county executives, county legislatures, sheriffs, prosecutors, and school boards. Also includes partisan and demographic information about candidates (largely modeled), demographic data on constituencies, and recent presidential election results and ideological preference (modeled) for most cities and counties. For more detail, see the data descriptor paper. Data in .csv and R formats.\n\nLEAP data use agreement\n\nUsing the LEAP data link above, select the data you would like to receive and take a screenshot to email to the LEAP team. You will also need to submit this data use agreement and include a brief abstract of the project and how the data will be used.\n\nCounty FIPS Matching Tool\n\nThis handy tool by Carl Klarner provides a simple csv or Stata file for merging to your data to easily assign Census county FIPS codes to variously presented county names. County names collected from various sources, such as election returns, frequently present county names in a variety of ways and often have misspellings. This will make the process much easier. There are roughly 3000 counties, and this tool provides more than 70,000 variations for matching.\n\nHarvard Election Data Archive\n\nPresidential, Congressional, and Statewide office elections by precinct, 2002–2012 (for most states; some states have earlier data and most also have 2014 data). Usually includes gubernatorial elections and some other statewide offices as well.\n\nGeo-referenced to US Census Voting Tabulation Districts for comparison to Census data at low levels. Data can be downloaded to a variety of formats. Also includes GIS shapefiles. For more information on the challenges of merging election geographies with Census geographies, see the Public Mapping Project.\n\nOpenElections\n\nIncludes general, primary, and special elections to federal, gubernatorial, and state legislative office (by county and precinct, generally 2000–present). The project is continually in process, so data for many states is in various levels of completeness (raw, pre-processed, cleaned). Data in .csv. The team has published about the immense challenges in acquiring official precinct-level data due to the lack of standardization in formats and processes: Willis, Derek, Thessalia Merivaki, and Ioannis Ziogas. 2022. “Election Data Transparency: Obtaining Precinct-Level Election Returns.” Public Integrity 24 (2): 162–78. https://doi.org/10.1080/10999922.2021.1883854.\n\nRecord of American Democracy (ROAD) (1984–1990)\n\nAll elections at and above State House, along with party registration and other variables, in each state for the roughly 170,000 precincts nationwide.\n\nData has also been merged with many demographic and socioeconomic variables from Census data. Data can be downloaded to a variety of formats.\n\nALARM Project Census 2020 Redistricting Data\n\nThe Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project provides precinct-level demographic and election data from the 2020 decennial census and the Voting and Election Science Team which have been tidied and joined together using 2020 precinct boundaries. Code to generate the data from these sources is included; the entire workflow is open-source and reproducible. Final files are at Census VTD level (where available; also available through RDH), but files projected to 2010 blocks (vest-2010 folder) and then crosswalked to 2020 blocks (crosswalks folder) are available.\n\nUnited States Congressional District Shapefiles\n\nThis site provides digital boundary definitions for every U.S. Congressional District in use between 1789 and 2012. Produced by Jeffrey Lewis at UCLA. Boundaries are available as shapefiles or GeoJSON definitions. Includes extensive documentation of how boundaries for districts were constructed. These have been incorporated into the GeoReferenced Electoral Districts (GRED) dataset, which merges them with CLEA constituencies for the US. They have also been utilized in the Spatiotemporal Congressional District Data project by Levi Wolf creating a fully georeferenced dataset of election results and district boundaries (see the write-up in Nature). For CD boundaries 2016-present, see the United States Districts project."
