The 1996 United States presidential election was the 53rd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1996. In a closely contested election, Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo of New York defeated Arizona Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.

Incumbent George H.W. Bush was ineligible for a third term, and Cuomo secured the Democratic nomination with relative ease, defeating a challenge by outgoing New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley. McCain was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination and despite a contentious primary battle with Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander and others, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. To heal the primary tensions, McCain selected Alexander as his running mate, while Cuomo selected Tennessee Senator Al Gore, who had run for the nomination twice before, in 1988 and 1992.

Both major−party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not entirely ignored. Cuomo noted how Republicans had held the White House for sixteen years and that it was time for a change in direction, while McCain pledged to continue the policies and prosperity of the Reagan−Bush years. Cuomo's campaigning skills outclassed McCain's, as he focused extensively on the swing states. Moreover, he was aided by his running mate Gore, who enabled him to hold the support of traditionally Democratic voters in rural and working−class areas and made him more competitive in the normally Republican South. McCain, on his part, made a series of missteps and was outclassed by Cuomo at the debates.

On Election Day, Cuomo narrowly defeated McCain, winning a majority of the popular and electoral vote. He was able to carry several Midwestern and Northeastern swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, as well as every state in New England except for the Republican bastion of New Hampshire, New Mexico in the Interior West, and the Pacific Coast states of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington. McCain won most of the Southern and Western states, including the large states of Florida and Texas. Cuomo and McCain each carried 25 states, with Cuomo also carrying the heavily Democratic District of Columbia. Cuomo was the first Democrat to win the White House since Jimmy Carter in 1976, 20 years earlier.

Results[]

By Election Day, the race between Cuomo and McCain was viewed as even. It took most of the night and the following morning to declare the winner. It was not until 2:00 a.m. in the morning before NBC News was able to declare that Cuomo had carried Ohio and had thus accumulated the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. Seconds later, ABC News also declared Cuomo the winner, based on projections in New Jersey and Ohio, while CBS News announced Cuomo's victory at 2:45 a.m. Cuomo defeated McCain by two percentage points in the popular vote.

The electoral vote was the closest since 1976, the last Democratic victory. Cuomo carried 25 states and the District of Columbia with 321 electoral votes, while McCain carried 25 states with 217 electoral votes. Cuomo's victory came primarily from his near−sweep of the Northeast (he lost only New Hampshire) and his narrow victories in important Midwestern swing states, such as Ohio, Iowa, and Missouri. Cuomo also carried the Pacific Coast states of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington, and the heavily Catholic state of New Mexico in the Interior West. McCain won every other Western state, and also carried most of the Southern states except for Arkansas (Bill Clinton's home state, which Cuomo won with a narrow plurality) and Tennessee (Al Gore's home state). The most tightly contested state in the election was Maine, which Cuomo won by slightly over 5,000 votes.

Of the 3,143 counties/districts/independent cities making returns, Cuomo won in 1,103 (35.09%) while McCain carried 2,040 (64.91%). Cuomo became the first presidential victor since John F. Kennedy in 1960 to carry a minority of counties, and only the second Democratic presidential candidate in history, behind Kennedy, to do so.
