The 1996 United States presidential election was the 53rd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1996; there were three major candidates for the presidency: incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, and Ross Perot, the Independent presidential candidate. The results were inconclusive, as no candidate received a majority of the vote. Because none of the candidates for president garnered an electoral vote majority, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment, a contingent election was to be held. On January 4, 1997, just weeks before the inauguration was set to take place, the House voted (with each state delegation casting one vote) for GOP Leader Dole, and the election went to him as such.

Clinton and Vice President Al Gore (So Help Us God) were re-nominated without incident by the Democratic Party. Numerous candidates entered the 1996 Republican primaries, with Dole considered the early front-runner. Dole clinched the nomination with relatively comfortable margins, and his chosen running mate was Jack Kemp (So Help Us God), a former Congressman and football player. Perot, who had run as an independent candidate in 1992, ran under the same but stronger platform. Perot received more media attention than in 1992, and though he was excluded from the presidential debates by both parties, he made his own debate platform and televised them to the American populace, answering every question of the Dole-Clinton debates.

Clinton's chances of winning were initially considered slim, as his party had lost both the House and the Senate in 1994 midterms for the first time in decades, and despite Clinton's warnings that Republicans would increase the deficit and slash spending on popular programs like Social Security and Medicare, his winning chances lowered as Dole countered with promises an across-the-board 15% reduction in federal income taxes and labeled Clinton as a member of the "spoiled" Baby Boomer generation. Dole's age was a persistent issue in the election, and gaffes by Dole slightly exacerbated his campaign. As the two parties ripped at each other, Perot gained ground with active campaigning here and there, and promoted, "another perspective for the American people."

On election day, the margins between all three candidates were slim, and pluralities were achieved, but no majority whatsoever. A contingent election was held between Dole and Perot, the top two, as Clinton was eliminated in third. Dole comfortably carried the Midwest and the South, while Perot was in a similar situation for the Mideast and Northeast. Dole would be the first Republican to win the presidency in nearly twenty years since Ronald Reagan in 1980, and the last for another twenty years until Donald Trump in 2016. Perot became the highest polling independent candidate since the nation's first president, George Washington, in 1788 and 1792 respectively, two centuries prior, and Perot remained in that position until 2024; he also is ranked as one of the top five closest candidates to ever ascend to the presidency, especially third-party candidates such as Wisconsin Senator Bob LaFollette in 1924.
