        "text": "Iâ€™ve been meaning to show my latest book collecting obsession for a while. As most regular readers know (and I see I have some new ones â€“ hello! â€“ always lovely and increases my google reader list every time as I discover new blogs to return read), I have fond memories of the books that were read to us as children, many include animals dressed in clothing and I regularly find myself collecting Richard Scarry and Racey Helps among others. My most recent addition are some books by BESHLIE, my Mum gave me my childhood copy of â€˜Romany Woodâ€™ last time I was home, Iâ€™d completely forgotten about it to be honest, but was thrilled to see itâ€™s contents.\n\nIâ€™ve found it quite difficult to find much information on Beshlie on-line but from the books themselves it appears she lived a Travellers life with her husband Dominic Reeve and between them they wrote and illustrated a number of childrenâ€™s books. The drawings are of animal characters, generally living an itinerant life and contain a lot of nature details, they are the kind of images that the more you look at the more detail you see.\n\nEven the front pages are beautiful.\n\nMy favourite book is â€˜Travellerâ€™s Joyâ€™, it contains a series of illustrations of common (weed) flowers that Beshlie and Dominic find whilst regularly pitching their trailer and a description of their features, habitat and uses. Beshlie heads the written sections with an animal (in clothing, of course!) image to help children remember the plant names. Love it.\n\nOn a work progress note, I wrote myself a list at the beginning of last week of projects that urgently need finishing, the main one being to complete and list new products on Folksy as my store there is very neglected. I have pretty much failed and the same list was carried over to this week and will now be carried over to next, life is getting in the way. I am nearly there though so fingers crossed with C on full days from Monday I will finally get to check everything off ðŸ™‚"
