        "text": "Quantification of scientific contributions\n\nCitizen science contributes substantially to many domains of science, including wildlife conservation, natural resources, and environmental science (McKinley et al., 2017). For example, data collected on bird populations by the citizen science projects of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology have been used to examine changes in bird distribution over time and space, influences of environmental changes on breeding success, spread of emerging infectious diseases through wild animal populations, and effects of acid rain (Altizer et al., 2004; Hames et al., 2002; Rosenberg et al., 1999; Wells et al., 1998). However, few studies have quantified the global contribution of citizen science as a whole (i.e., not just contributions to the peer‐reviewed literature) and most are limited to a specific project or location (e.g., Arthur et al., 2014; Gardner et al., 2019; Poisson et al., 2020). In a survey across several groups of citizen science projects, Newman et al. (2017) found the contribution to management plans was 14% for CitSci.org projects and 50% for The Stewardship Network New England projects. The contributory and place‐based model of citizen science used by Earthwatch leads to over 60% of projects annually producing scientific publications as well as input to management plans or policies (Chandler, See, et al., 2017).\n\nOur study allows to quantify and compare 3 types of the scientific contributions of citizen science focusing on rare or threatened species. Our Pearson correlation coefficient among scientific contribution types of 0.40–0.51 means that projects that are proficient in a specific scientific contribution type will usually be proficient, to some extent, in the other scientific contribution types, although some trade‐offs are likely to occur. As we predicted, projects contributed more to the gray literature and conservation measures than to the peer‐reviewed literature. The monitoring of threatened species often relies on governmental or nonprofit organizations whose outputs typically include reports or proposed conservation measures. Legal protection for threatened or rare species often relies on the best available science, and the contribution of raw data, gray literature, and direct mitigation actions provided by citizen science projects to species conservation should not be underestimated (Hemmi & Graham, 2014; Sullivan et al., 2006). We revealed diverse and numerous conservation measures arising from citizen science projects focusing on rare or threatened species. As shown in other studies on a specific taxon, citizen science projects focusing on rare or threatened species collect data that can be used to conserve these species or their habitats and provide for evidence‐based government policy (Greenwood, 2007; Kelly et al., 2020).\n\nAlmost one‐half of the projects included in our survey produced at least 1 peer‐reviewed paper, although this number included pas only partially based on citizen science, only partially on rare or threatened species, and sometimes on topics other than conservation and monitoring (e.g., a study where citizen scientists provide validated biodiversity data on frogs of Australia, another monitoring humpback whale [Megaptera novaeangliae] behavior). Theobald et al. (2015) found a similar proportion for biodiversity citizen science projects: 12% of environmental citizen science projects were recorded as leading to a peer‐reviewed publication based on traditional literature‐based methods compared with 45−60% based on a manager‐survey method. Theobald et al. (2015) propose that the inconsistent responses by project managers to survey questions may be indicative of confusion regarding the meaning of peer reviewed, leading to inclusion of gray literature and technical reports in self‐reported publications. Our results do not support this explanation because we specifically asked for 3 different types of contributions and distinguished between gray literature and peer‐reviewed publications. Moreover, most of our respondents provided titles or links to back up the number of contributions they provided. We therefore propose that traditional literature‐based methods underestimate publication rates, most likely due to the lack of direct or prominent mention of the project origins in peer‐reviewed publications.\n\nPredictors of scientific contribution success\n\nCitizen science is experiencing an explosion in growth, but the use of data produced by citizen science projects in scientific publications and conservation decision‐making has not reached its full potential yet (Newman et al., 2017). Various citizen science projects highlight the importance of several factors that lead to tangible contributions to science and conservation. These include design and implementation strategies that match the needs of science and public engagement with the right type of project and approach to maximize collaboration among stakeholders, from volunteers to decision makers, while integrating cross‐disciplinary approaches (Maas et al., 2021; Newman et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2018).\n\nLongevity was the most important factor influencing the number of peer‐reviewed papers, gray literature publications, and conservation measures. This result aligns with those of Tulloch et al. (2013) and Theobald et al. (2015), who analyzed peer‐reviewed publications of birds and biodiversity citizen science projects, respectively. Chandler, Rullman, et al. (2017) also found a similar result; the longevity of Earthwatch‐supported projects was highly correlated with publication rate and contributions to management plans. In this study, contributions increased over time, peaking for management plans and policies at 6–8 years, which was earlier than contributions to publications that peaked at 7–9 years. Project implementation is complex and has a strong element of trial and error that involves human, budgetary, and technical constraints. Furthermore, data accumulation takes time, especially for rare or threatened species. As such, long‐term studies may be more likely to lead to scientific contributions because they improve the ability to measure change over space and time (Bird et al., 2014; Tulloch et al., 2013).\n\nThe success of long‐term projects may be related to several factors, such as co‐funding to maintain a long‐term financial support (Conrad & Hilchey, 2011; Cunha et al., 2017) and methods that reflect the goal of the project and the motivations and capabilities of the target volunteer profile, which avoids bias in the data set and loss of motivation due to frustration (Chandler, Rullman, et al., 2017; Couvet et al., 2008; McKinley et al., 2017). Multiple organization types leading a project (e.g., university + NGOs) bring a range of scientists and citizen scientists together and may provide 2 major elements that are often lacking in projects run by a single organization: recruitment with long‐term engagement and scientific rigor (Cunha et al., 2017).\n\nData quality was another important predictor of success in terms of peer‐reviewed and gray literature publications, and to a lesser extent, conservation measures. This result differs from Theobald et al.’s (2015) results that probability of publication was largely unaffected by the data quality assurance measures. This difference with our finding may mean that an index combining the most important metrics may be a better measure of data quality than individual metrics, either because the combined effect is greater than the sum of their separate effects or because the variance in our sample was bigger than the earlier study. Data quality is particularly relevant when studying rare and threatened species because misidentification of threatened animals could have broader legal implications (Ely et al., 2017), than, for instance, biodiversity. Data sets produced by citizen scientists using rigorous methods can reliably produce high‐quality outputs on par with those produced by professionals (Kosmala et al., 2016; McKinley et al., 2017). A comment from a project manager reflects this: “One of our guiding principles is Do ‐ Discover – Influence: Do good survey work, Discover through data analysis, and Influence policy, conservation management, research priorities, and development assessment processes.”\n\nOur data quality point system, based on a list of important criteria, such as data validation and metadata inclusion, provides a tool to quantify and compare data quality, which will help managers optimize their scientific productivity (see Appendices S12–16 for data quality's predictor of success). However, simpler opportunistic citizen science projects that might have a low data quality index can still provide relevant data on rare species than structured citizen science projects due to higher spatial and temporal sampling coverage, leading to higher detection probabilities (Henckel et al., 2020).\n\nCollaboration type influenced the number of gray literature publications and conservation measures; transdisciplinary projects produced on average more contributions than other approaches. The idea that more holistic projects yield more conservation outcomes is also supported by a study that examined the explicit inclusion of multiple dimensions of place in citizen science project (Newman et al., 2017). It is reasonable to say that transdisciplinarity may not be as important to achieve peer‐reviewed publications because the first objective of this type of contribution is often knowledge advancement. In contrast, a transdisciplinary approach may be essential to enact conservation measures for 3 reasons. First, a transdisciplinary approach can better tackle real‐world problems, such as endangered species conservation, that involve nonacademic stakeholders. Second, powerful new knowledge can be created by merging multiple knowledge streams and different value systems. Third, this approach also increases creativity because stakeholders’ different points of view could inspire others and lead to the best solution to a problem (Putra, 2017). Interdisciplinary citizen science projects, which also include a high level of cooperation, are common in the biological domain (Pettibone et al., 2017) and were well represented in our surveyed projects. Transdisciplinary projects were scarcer, meaning that there is an unexploited potential to improve the scientific value of citizen science projects on rare or threatened species. However, this approach takes more time and effort, which emphasizes the importance of proper planning to ensure projects last long and reach their full potential. Because many funding agencies focus on short‐term deliverables, we advise consideration of the increased benefits of long‐term commitment for citizen science projects focusing on rare or threatened species.\n\nTwo potential sources of bias in our study are the process of discovering and selecting projects for analysis and the process for obtaining information about each of the selected projects. We expect we undersampled projects in communities speaking languages other than English, Spanish, French, and Chinese for our spatial and temporal trend analysis and projects in communities speaking languages other than English for our scientific contribution analysis; projects without websites (i.e., very local or small scale); projects fitting the definition of citizen science, although not defining themselves as such or projects founded before the late 2000s, when the terms citizen science and participatory science became popular; completed projects; and projects not focusing on rare or threatened species but producing scientific contributions on rare or endangered species (e.g., eBird, iNaturalist; Pocock et al., 2015).\n\nAlthough projects like eBird and iNaturalist generate very important data on rare and threatened species, there are many cases in which a more focused approach will be helpful. For example, iNaturalist relies primarily on photographs and audio and has relatively few bat entries. A more targeted approach for rare or threatened bats is thus warranted. Moreover, because citizen science is a term more popular in North America, the use of other keywords, such as participatory science or volunteer, extended our search geographically. We have no way of estimating how these other kinds of projects might differ from our project's subsample. Nonetheless, our search was standardized, repeatable, and, we believe, an informative sample of this type of project and a valuable starting point for future citizen science projects, and it allowed for a systematic analysis of citizen science focusing on rare or threatened animals. In addition, bats were overrepresented due to our specific search for this taxon in English (see note in Appendix S1). However, because the results for bats only did not differ from other taxa (preliminary results), we are confident that including bats separately did not bias our overall results.\n\nWe found that citizen science contributes substantially to rare or threatened animal monitoring and conservation in a wide range of ways, from theoretical frameworks in peer‐reviewed publication to applied conservation measures. Results gained from this study, in which we combined web searches and manager surveys, would have been unachievable with a traditional literature‐based method. To our knowledge, we provide the first quantitative analysis of a large spectrum of scientific contributions of citizen science projects focusing on rare or threatened animals on multiple continents. We also provide indicators to inform the future development of citizen science activities and increase scientific contributions. Although we focused on the quantification of scientific contributions and identification of factors increasing contribution numbers, not all contributions are equal in terms of quality and impact for science and conservation. Quantity is not always a guarantor of success, and future research should take into consideration other indices of success, such as the contribution quality (Chandler, Rullman, et al., 2017).\n\nCitizen science is a promising approach to help scientists address gaps, which is essential to ensure effective conservation of rare or threatened species. Several conservation measures emerged from our study. To increase all types of scientific contributions, we call for increased conceptual and methodological development when starting citizen science projects to ensure project persistence, high‐quality data, and transdisciplinary values in research design and outputs by undertaking the following steps. Plan projects so that they are likely to have long life spans, and find multiple sources of funding as a hedge against cuts in resources (Conrad & Hilchey, 2011; Cunha et al., 2017). Educate and train project managers because this can affect the timely delivery of projects (Brown et al. 2007). Ensure good data collection and management by integrating factors included in our data quality index or those described in Kosmala et al. (2016). Include diverse stakeholders in all stages of the project to ensure best practices that link scientific research to conservation interventions.\n\nAppendix S1.
