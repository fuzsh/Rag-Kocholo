        "text": "Print: Racey Helps - The Motor Race (A3)\n\n€30.00\n\nTales for Tadpoles\n\nAngus Clifford Racey Helps (1913-1971) was a leading children’s illustrator who produced many illustrations for The Medici Society throughout the 1950s and 60s. Born in Somerset he worked as an antiquarian book-dealer. A course at the West of England College of Art set him on his career as an author and illustrator of children’s books. His anthropomorphic illustrations of woodland animals are full of humour and appeal to children and adults alike. ​ Printed on 315gsm museum quality watercolour art board (acid free), which has a natural white finish with a slightly structured, soft-textured surface equivalent to a traditional etching fine art paper. The surface has a special matte coating, designed for high quality fine art reproduction with giclée technology. It is an archival quality paper with great colour accuracy. The ivory mount fits a standard A3 frame. Individually cellophane wrapped with an artist biography backing sheet."
