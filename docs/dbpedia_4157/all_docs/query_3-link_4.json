The name Rhys is derived from the Old Welsh word \"res,\" meaning \"ardor\" or \"enthusiasm.\" It is believed to have been used as a given name in Wales as early as the 6th century.\n\nIn medieval times, the name Rhys was particularly popular among the Welsh nobility and ruling families. One of the most notable historical figures with this name was Rhys ap Gruffydd, a 12th-century prince of the Kingdom of Deheubarth in southwestern Wales. He played a significant role in Welsh resistance against Norman conquest and is remembered for his military prowess and leadership.\n\nThe variant spelling \"Racey\" emerged in the 16th century, likely as an Anglicized version of the Welsh name Rhys. This spelling was more commonly used in England and other parts of the British Isles, while the original Welsh spelling remained prevalent in Wales.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded instances of the name Racey can be found in the parish records of St. Mary's Church in Beverley, Yorkshire, England, where a child named Racey Williamson was baptized in 1587.\n\nThroughout history, several notable individuals have borne the name Racey. One such person was Racey Helps (1802-1849), an English architect and surveyor who designed several buildings in London, including the Church of St. Peter in Selsdon.\n\nAnother Racey of note was Racey Maddison (1836-1897), a British soldier and explorer who served in the British East India Company and later explored parts of Central Asia and the Himalayas.\n\nIn the 20th century, Racey Burden (1923-2003) was a British jazz drummer and bandleader who played with several prominent musicians, including Ronnie Scott and Victor Feldman.\n\nRacey Walker (1931-2004) was an American football player who played as a defensive back for the Detroit Lions in the 1950s and later became a coach and executive in the National Football League.\n\nFinally, Racey McMath (born 1999) is a contemporary American football player who currently plays as a wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans in the National Football League.\n\nData source\n\nThe first name data used on this page comes from the Social Security Administration (SSA).
