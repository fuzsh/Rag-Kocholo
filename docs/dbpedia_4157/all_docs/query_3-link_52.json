        "text": "The four roles that stakeholders might play in any project include the following:\n\nResponsible: People or stakeholders who do the work. They must complete the task or objective or make the decision. Several people can be jointly Responsible.\n\nAccountable: Person or stakeholder who is the “owner” of the work. He or she must sign off or approve when the task, objective or decision is complete. This person must make sure that responsibilities are assigned in the matrix for all related activities. Success requires that there is only one person Accountable, which means that “the buck stops there.”\n\nConsulted: People or stakeholders who need to give input before the work can be done and signed-off on. These people are “in the loop” and active participants.\n\nInformed: People or stakeholders who need to be kept “in the picture.” They need updates on progress or decisions, but they do not need to be formally consulted, nor do they contribute directly to the task or decision.\n\nHow to create a RACI matrix\n\nThe simple process for creating a RACI model includes the following six steps:\n\nIdentify all the tasks involved in delivering the project and list them on the left-hand side of the chart in completion order. For IT projects, this is most effectively addressed by incorporating the PLC steps and deliverables. (This is illustrated in the example below.)\n\nIdentify all the project stakeholders and list them along the top of the chart.\n\nComplete the cells of the model identifying who has responsibility, accountability and who will be consulted and informed for each task.\n\nEnsure every task has at least one stakeholder Responsible for it.\n\nNo tasks should have more than one stakeholder Accountable. Resolve any conflicts where there is more than one for a particular task.\n\nShare, discuss and agree the RACI model with your stakeholders at the start of the project. This includes resolving any conflicts or ambiguities.\n\nRACI matrix example\n\nFor purposes of simplification, let’s say your project can be broken down into four discrete tasks, undertaken by a team of application developers, along with a sponsoring project executive, project manager, business analyst, and technical architect.\n\nAnalysis for each stakeholder:\n\nAre there too many R’s: Does one stakeholder have too much of the project assigned to them?\n\nNo empty cells: Does the stakeholder need to be involved in so many of the activities? Can Responsible be changed to Consulted, or Consulted changed to Informed? I.e., are there too many “cooks in this kitchen” to keep things moving? (And if so, what does that say about the culture within which this project is being managed?)\n\nBuy-in: Does each stakeholder totally agree with the role that they are specified to play in this version of the model? When such agreement is achieved, that should be included in the project’s charter and documentation.\n\nAnalysis for each PLC step or deliverable:\n\nNo R’s: Who is doing the work in this step and getting things done? Whose role is it to take the initiative?\n\nToo many R’s: Is this another sign of too many “cooks in this kitchen” to keep things moving?\n\nNo A’s: Who is Accountable? There must be one ‘A’ for every step of the PLC. One stakeholder must be Accountable for the thing happening — “the buck stops” with this person.\n\nMore than one A: Is there confusion on decision rights? Stakeholders with accountability have the final say on how the work should be done and how conflicts are resolved. Multiple A’s invite slow and contentious decision-making.\n\nEvery box filled in: Do all the stakeholders really need to be involved? Are there justifiable benefits in involving all the stakeholders, or is this just covering all the bases?\n\nA lot of C’s: Do all the stakeholders need to be routinely Consulted, or can they be kept Informed and raise exceptional circumstances if they feel they need to be Consulted? Too many C’s in the loop really slows down the project.\n\nAre all true stakeholders included in this model: Sometimes this is more of a challenge to ensure, as it’s an error of omission. This is often best addressed by a steering committee or management team.\n\nRACI matrix in project management\n\nIt is the above analyses, which are readily enabled by the use of a RACI matrix, that deliver the real benefit of the model. It is the integration of the model with a specific PLC that ensures that the project is structured for success. Without either component, problems with the structure of the project management process may remain hidden until (or even while…) they cause the project to bog down. Making the time and effort to create a customized PLC/RACI for each significant project is an opportunity to design your project management process for project success."
