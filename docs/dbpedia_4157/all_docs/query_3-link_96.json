        "text": "Project management is constantly evolving in terms of technology and trends, from RACI to Gantt and back. It’s no wonder that sometimes it feels like a Pandora’s box of different decision-makers, project roles, and responsibilities. This is particularly true if you don’t have a project plan and the structures in place to complete the task milestones from start to finish while managing the responsible parties involved.\n\nWithout this, it’s pretty easy for the right hand to be in the dark about what the left hand is doing. One steadfast method involves the use of something called a RACI chart. In this blog, we’ll cover what the RACI model is, why it’s important for a healthy project management environment, and how to implement it the right way.\n\nGet started\n\nWhat is a RACI matrix?\n\nRACI is a responsibility assignment matrix that teams use as part of their project management tactics and strategy. Also called a RACI matrix or linear responsibility chart, RACI charts are a type of responsibility assignment matrices in project management. These simple spreadsheets or tables highlight the different states of responsibility a stakeholder has over a particular task or deliverable and denote it with the letters R, A, C, or I. It’s typically implemented by color-coding each responsibility level and creating a simple table layout.\n\nGenerally, nobody should have more than a single responsibility level for each deliverable or activity group in the RACI chart. In this example, we’ve given every person some level of involvement to keep things simple. But when you make a real model for more than four people, there’s often more white space. We will get more into how class RACI looks and functions later.\n\nPro tip: Check out our easy-to-use RACI matrix template\n\nWhat does the acronym RACI mean?\n\nThe letters in RACI stand for:\n\nResponsible\n\nAccountable\n\nConsulted\n\nInformed\n\nThe RACI matrix uses these terms to describe individuals’ roles and responsibilities for project activities and deliverables.\n\nOnce your responsibility assignment is complete, all participants should understand precisely what they need to do to make the project successful.\n\nDefinitions of RACI terms\n\nHere’s how the RACI chart framework envisions each role and responsibility.\n\nResponsible\n\nThe person assigned as Responsible is the individual who is in charge of the day-to-day work of the project including actual hands-on work, delegating responsibilities, and day-to-day management. This function is often held by a project manager, team lead, developer or engineer, designer, or content creator.\n\nAccountable\n\nThis role is given to the person who is accountable for making sure the work is completed satisfactorily. This is the individual who signs off that the job is done to the standard required. This function is often a department head, C-level executive, or a product owner.\n\nConsulted\n\nSometimes, work may require advice or other input from a subject matter expert to get the job done. Allocate the Consulted role to a person whose advice for task completion is necessary. Consultants are typically subject matter experts, legal counsels, financial advisors, UX specialists, and marketing specialists.\n\nInformed\n\nThe Informed role is for those stakeholders who need to be kept in the loop as a task progresses. They won’t provide any input on how the task gets done, but are likely a key stakeholder who needs to know what’s happening. This role is held by stakeholders, end users, client representatives, or other department heads.\n\nRACI best practices\n\nThere’s no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to building your RACI charts. Here are some of the best practices that we recommend sticking to:\n\n1. Map out deliverables and activity groups thoroughly before using RACI\n\nDon’t jump immediately into assigning individual responsibilities. Start by consulting with subject matter experts and accurately mapping out the moving parts. Only once you’ve got a clear outline of your project can you make educated decisions. That could be your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or a project roadmap.\n\n2. Don’t be afraid to give responsibility to less senior staff\n\nAssigning the accountable role to a high-level executive or project manager for all tasks is a mistake. Since they have the final say on when a job is complete, you instantly create a bottleneck. Instead, don’t be afraid to assign that role to experienced staff on the project team itself, who is most familiar with the work.\n\n3. Standardize the approach across departments and locations\n\nWhile a single project team is good, stakeholder relationships don’t exist in a vacuum. Your whole organization must get on board to truly maximize the return on investment. Make distributed responsibility and decision-making part of your corporate purpose. Everyone — from executive to intern — must be on the same page.\n\n4. Each task must have at least one Responsible person and only one Accountable person\n\nThe goal here is to avoid overwhelm, not increase it. That’s why it’s critical to have one accountable role for each task to make decision making as easy as possible.\n\n5. Use the right digital tools to implement RACI at scale\n\nA written memo isn’t enough to standardize your methods and remove departmental silos. Use digital tools to build a platform for efficient RACI implementation and stakeholder management.\n\nWhen you should use RACI\n\nThe RACI model is a great solution when multiple people are involved in a project and you need clarity. It helps avoid searching for answers across multiple team members and stakeholders. Another bonus of using RACI is that it gives team members confidence. Everyone knows exactly what they are responsible for and who to turn to when necessary.\n\nA large scale project could involve many stakeholders, such as:\n\nGovernment regulators\n\nVIP clients and project sponsors\n\nCompany executives\n\nBusiness analysts\n\nInternal users of the product\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nInvestors\n\nWhen RACI is used from the beginning, teams are able to avoid miscalculations and blunders that could cost precious time and money. And of course, it will contribute to your overall stakeholder engagement efforts.\n\nHow do you create a RACI chart?\n\nYou can create a RACI chart using a simple grid, but it’s better to use a digital workspace so you can easily update and fix it.\n\nGet a head start with our monday work management RACI chart template\n\nOn the left of the RACI diagram, split your project into logical phases, and note down all of the action items that require completion. Along the top of the matrix, the four project roles of the RACI model are already entered for you.\n\nNext, where a task and role intersects, add in the person who will assume the role. Here’s an example containing a few common tasks for a new product launch:\n\nResponsibleAccountableConsultedInformedPackaging DesignMaryJaneStephenGrahamAdvertising CampaignJane, StephenJane------Manufacturing QCGrahamSusanMarkJaneShipping LogisticsJaniceStephen------\n\nThere are a few rules to stick to when you compose your RACI chart.\n\nTo make sure a task gets done, each one should have someone allocated as Responsible. Similarly, it’s best practice for every work item to have someone Accountable, too, so they can sign off the task when it’s finished.\n\nFor large tasks you can assign more than one person to each of the roles, if needed. Or if it makes sense, you can have the same person allocated to a deliverable as both Responsible and Accountable. As you can see in the above example, not all tasks require a Consulted or Informed person ― you don’t have to assign these roles if you don’t need them.\n\nNow let’s move on to understand the benefits of using a RACI diagram to define roles for a project.\n\nThe pros and cons of RACI\n\nIt’s clear that using RACI charts boosts organization and often clearer communication, but like anything else, RACI also has its downside. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nUsing a RACI chart can bring several advantages to project management, enhancing efficiency, clarity, and team alignment:\n\nCommunication with stakeholders is clearer and more organized\n\nTeam leads can avoid assigning too much responsibility to specific team members\n\nGive visibility to stakeholders to understand what is in the pipeline and what is coming their way\n\nCons\n\nRACI charts can also present challenges, including potential confusion, tension, and delays among team members:\n\nRoles can be confusing in the beginning (for example, understanding the difference between Accountable and Responsible)\n\nTension may exist between Consulted and Informed stakeholders\n\nSetting up a RACI chart may require an initial time investment\n\nRACI matrix alternatives\n\nAs the RACI chart is a simple project plan at its heart, it’s flexible enough for you to optimize it to fit your particular need. Especially when you’re using a fully customizable template like the one from monday.com.\n\nThere are many variants of the RACI matrix that have tried to address the ambiguities with role names, or added in new roles entirely. Here are a few alternatives you could use instead.\n\nDACI\n\nThe DACI chart uses the following role definitions to reduce the confusion caused by Responsible and Accountable in RACI.\n\nDriver: the person who ‘drives’ the task forward (Responsible in RACI)\n\nApprover: the person who signs off the task (Accountable in RACI)\n\nContributor: the Consulted role in RACI\n\nInformed: same as RACI\n\nRASCI\n\nThe RASCI chart uses the RACI format but adds in the additional role of Support. This role is a person who assists the Responsible person in completing an allocated task. They won’t provide advice like the Consulted role or be the main driver for task completion.\n\nCARS\n\nThe CARS model attempts to define the roles of RACI in a more precise manner and adds in a supporting role like the RASCI model.\n\nCommunicate: combines the Consulted and Informed roles in RACI.\n\nApprove: uses more explicit language for the Accountable role in RACI.\n\nResponsible: same as RACI role.\n\nSupport: uses the same support role as the RASCI model.\n\nCAIRO\n\nThe CAIRO model expands RACI by adding in the letter O (and jumbles up the letters). The letter O is for Out-of-the-loop and is for situations where you need to designate an individual or team as not involved in a task at all.\n\nRACI vs. RASCI\n\nThe terms RACI and RASCI are largely used interchangeably today. As mentioned above, RASCI is the same as RACI but adds support into the mix. The Support function makes sure that the Responsible team member has everything he/she needs to get the project done. This can be helpful on larger projects where more assistance is needed.\n\nWho uses a RACI matrix?\n\nEven though the RACI model is a project manager’s useful tool for stakeholder management, that doesn’t mean it should be used for all projects. The deciding factors on who uses it relate to the scale of the project and the company structure.\n\nUse the RACI matrix for projects that are:\n\nLarge-scale with clear-cut deliverables or workgroups\n\nFor organizations with static roles and responsibilities\n\nInvolving a wide variety of stakeholders for different aspects\n\nSpanning multiple departments\n\nIn highly regulated industries\n\nDon’t use the RACI matrix for:\n\nSmall, single-department projects — it’s likely not necessary\n\nTeams working with an Agile framework like Scrum\n\nIn Agile organizations, cross-functional teams and collaboration is the default. So task responsibility depends on the employees’ initiative rather than a top-down decision. For Agile teams, implementing a hard version of RACI will likely not be helpful, as teams should be self-organizing.\n\n(Image Source)\n\nRAPID vs.RACI— What’s the difference?\n\nSometimes when you want to define RACI, it’s important to use another method for comparison.\n\nRAPID and RACI are both two important tools for project managers, but they have different functions. As we have seen, the RACI method revolves around deliverables and the key person responsible throughout each stage of the process. RAPID however, focuses primarily on the decision-making process and the actions made by an organization.\n\nYou can see the breakdown of RAPID here:\n\n(Image Source)\n\nWhile making a key decision is a part of the project management process, it’s not the whole journey. The RACI framework outlines who should do a task, who to keep in the loop, and who gets the final say.\n\nHow to create a RACI chart with monday work management\n\nWhile there is a wide variety of project management apps out there, in the particular case of a RACI, monday work management provides an outstanding offering of robust integrations and extensibility that allow you to build the exact platform you need to manage this structure and more.\n\nYou can get started much quicker with our RACI matrix template and share it with the entire team. Keep track of the RACI roles for all project activities and easily see project phases and individual deliverables for each.\n\nIn addition to customizations on columns, statuses, and more, easily assign roles to internal users or guest users created for external stakeholders. All assigned roles will automatically get informed of status changes to the work item.\n\nHere are a few more ways you can get the most out of your RACI matrix.\n\nContinually update and revise to reflect the real-time statuses\n\nAn out-of-date RACI diagram helps nobody. Use board permissions to let responsible users directly edit the status of the row themselves.\n\nKeep stakeholders involved with shared boards and dashboards\n\nWith monday.com, you can easily give them viewer access to project and workflow boards. That way, they know the actual status of the project in real-time. They can then use that information to guide their decisions. You can also inform stakeholders of crucial changes automatically with automations.\n\nOur integrations with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Gmail let you send messages based on status changes, new items, missed due dates, and more.\n\nRemove data silos to keep everyone on the same page\n\nNaturally, every department uses a different set of tools and applications. monday.com’s robust integrations make it easy to bring all of this data And even if you use custom business apps, you can easily integrate them into monday.com using our API and 50+ pre-built adaptors.\n\nEmpower stakeholders with RACI charts\n\nThe RACI matrix is an excellent method for assigning responsibilities and keeping stakeholders engaged throughout the journey because it clarifies where everyone should focus their energy and makes it easy for people to lead the way in their area of expertise.\n\nThat being said, the platform and tools you use to make it automated and up to date can have a significant impact on its success. Use our RACI template and share it with your entire team to ensure everyone understands and deals with it accordingly.\n\nGet started\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the four rules under the RACI chart?\n\nThe four rules in RACI are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. In the RASCI model, a fifth rule, Support, is added.\n\nWhat is the difference between the R and A in RACI?\n\nThe Responsible role is the person responsible for executing the task/project. The Accountable person is ultimately in charge of making sure the project is completed and is the project owner.\n\nWhat is the golden rule of RACI?\n\nThe golden rule of RACI charts is that only one person can be assigned the Accountable role for each project.\n\nCan the same person be accountable and responsible in RACI?\n\nYes, the same person can be both Accountable and Responsible in RACI. The Accountable status can only be assigned to one person, as this is the ultimate authority and owner of the task.\n\nWhich software is best for RACI?\n\nmonday.com makes it easy to build effective and visual RACI charts. Assign team members the different roles at the click of a button so everyone can stay informed and understand their part in getting the project completed well and on-time."
