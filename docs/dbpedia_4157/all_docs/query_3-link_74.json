Yip!\n\nJust for this post, you may bark, meow, cluck, or tweet your approval at any time. Perfectly acceptable. After all, it’s hard to curb your enthusiasm for this fun and frisky interactive story-in-verse and writing journal rolled into one, just purrrrfect for kids in grades K-3 (or bears of any age).\n\nPet Crazy includes 36 poems in all, with three poems featured in each of 12 PowerPacks.\n\nPowerPacks include:\n\nPowerplay Activity\n\nAnchor Poem\n\nResponse Poem\n\nMentor Poem\n\nPower2You Writing Prompt\n\nThe anchor poems in Pet Crazy were written by Kristy Dempsey, Janice Harrington, Carole Boston Weatherford, Eric Ode, Helen Frost, Tamera Will Wissinger, Elizabeth Steinglass, Laura Shovan, Padma Venkatraman, Eileen Spinelli, April Halprin Wayland and Don Tate. Five poems culled from the Poetry Friday Anthology series take their place alongside seven newly penned verses.\n\nJanet Wong has written original response and mentor poems, cleverly weaving all into a charming story about young Ben, who yearns for a dog of his own, friend and cat lover Kristy, and Daniel, Ben’s best friend, who gives Ben an unusual pet for his birthday.\n\nEach PowerPack focuses on a different poetic element or form (rhyme, repetition, alliteration, stanzas, question, acrostic, found poem, emotion). Kids will enjoy all the PowerPlay activities (circling words, filling in speech bubbles, drawing, doing mazes and word finds); these are perfect pre-writing warm-ups before reading the poems and writing one’s own poems from the prompts. And the larger trim size of this book (8.5″ x 11″) gives budding poets ample space to write, doodle, draw, and squiggle to their heart’s content.\n\nAs with the other Poetry Friday Powerbooks, Pet Crazy includes a wealth of resources for students, teachers, librarians, parents — anyone wishing to read, share, write, perform, or discuss children’s poetry. I especially like the suggestions for further reading: Poetry Books About Cats and Dogs, Books About Writing Poetry, Books with Poems Written By Children, and the suggestions for places to publish poetry. And look for the cool Hidden Language Skills for each of the PowerPack poems!\n\nI love how Janet linked the poems from 12 different poets to create an engaging story that’s sure to resonate with young readers. They will be eager to draw upon their personal experiences to write their own pet poems after reading about Kristy, Ben, Daniel, the dogs, cats, and surprises in the story. The themes of friendship, companionship, kindness, caring, empathy, responsibility, and helping others are great talking points and sources of inspiration.\n\nNow, just to whet your appetite for this delightful book, here’s what’s included in PowerPack 1:\n\n[PowerPlay Activity (Mix and Match)]:\n\n[Anchor Poem]:\n\nALL WORN OUT\n\nby Kristy Dempsey\n\nTippy-toe, Kitty Cat\n\nis sneaking through the house,\n\npushing on a puff of yarn,\n\nwishing for a mouse.\n\nKitty loves to play all day,\n\njumping, pouncing, leaping.\n\nWhere is kitty hiding now?\n\nShh! Kitty’s sleeping.\n\n*\n\n[Response Poem]:\n\nTHE GREATEST PETS EVER (Kristy) by Janet Wong Cats are the greatest pets ever! They are so clean and clever. Would I like a dog? No, never! Cats are my favorites -- FOREVER!\n\n*\n\n[Mentor Poem]:\n\nTHE PERFECT PETS FOR ME (Ben)\n\nby Janet Wong\n\nKristy likes neat pets.\n\nCats don’t drool.\n\nShe should meet my uncle’s dogs.\n\nThey’re super-cool.\n\nMy uncle’s dogs will sit and stay —\n\nand stay and s-t-a-y.\n\nTheir house is kind of far,\n\nbut we could go there someday.\n\nWhen we play together,\n\nKristy will see:\n\ndogs are pretty much\n\nthe perfect pets for me!\n\n*\n\n[Power2You Writing Prompt]:\n\nThe Perfect Pets for Me (a poem with rhyme)\n\nTry writing a poem of your own that uses rhyme at the ends of lines. You can write about a pet of your own, a pet you would like to have, whether you prefer cats or dogs, or another topic that interests you.\n\n*\n\nNaturally, all the furry helpers in the Alphabet Soup kitchen loved this book. There was one teensy problem, though. Each felt he/she would make the best pet. Tough call.\n\nBut they all agreed on two things. They loved the part in the story where Daniel reads to his grandpa’s dog Ruby. And they really perked up when hearing how Kristy invited Ben, Daniel, and new friends James and Amy to her house to have milk and cookies. Naturally, they had to have some milk and cookies too. Naturally.\n\nCongratulations to Sylvia and Janet on another wonderful book. When it comes to making learning fun, and taking the “fear” out of reading, writing, or teaching poetry, they are the BEST!
