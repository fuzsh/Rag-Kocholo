        "text": "Shubhanshu Shukla Picked As ‘Prime Astronaut’ For Indo-US Space Mission\n\nNEW DELHI (ANI) – Indian Air Force Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla has been selected as the prime astronaut for the upcoming Indo-US mission to the International Space Station (ISS), the Indian Space Research Organization has announced.\n\nTowards the goal of mounting a joint ISRO-NASA effort, the Human Space Flight Centre of ISRO has entered into a Space Flight Agreement with NASA-identified service provider Axiom Spacefor its upcoming Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, the Indian space agency said on August 5.\n\nA National Mission Assignment Board has recommended two Gaganyatris as prime and backup mission pilot for this mission. These include Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (prime) and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair (backup).\n\nDuring the mission, the Gaganyatri will undertake selected scientific research and technology demonstration experiments on board the ISS as well as engage in space outreach activities. The experiences gained during this mission will be beneficial for the Indian Human Space Program and it will also strengthen human space flight cooperation between ISRO and NASA.\n\nIn February this year, four Indian Air Force pilots were chosen: Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to be part of India’s first human space flight program. The four astronauts were trained at Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia.\n\nThe Gaganyaan mission is India’s first human space flight program for which extensive preparations are underway at various ISRO centers.\n\nLVM3 rocket – The well proven and reliable heavy lift launcher of ISRO, is identified as the launch vehicle for Gaganyaan mission.\n\nHuman safety is of paramount importance in Gaganyaan mission. To ensure the same, various new technologies comprising of Engineering systems and Human centric systems are being developed and realized.\n\nIn 2023, in a stellar display of prowess, India soared to new heights with the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the South Pole of the Moon and the successful launch of Aditya-L1, India’s first solar mission.\n\nThese milestones not only secured India’s standing in the global space economy but also fueled the engines for the private space sector in India.\n\nAmong other feats India now aims for setting up ‘Bharatiya Antariksha Station’ by 2035 and sending the first Indian to the Moon by 2040."
