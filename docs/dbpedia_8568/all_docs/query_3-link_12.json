        "text": "CD's Insolvency Application Dismissed Due to Lack of Bona Fides Background: M/s Agroha Paper Industries Private Limited (the Appellant) filed an appeal against an order of the NCLT Allahabad Bench that dismissed its application under Section 10 of the IBC to initiate CIRP against itself. The Appellant had defaulted on loan repayments to Bank of Maharashtra (the Respondent), which had declared the account as a NPA on 28.10.2018 and initiated proceedings under the SARFAESI Act. Issues: 1. Whether the NCLT erred in rejecting the Section 10 application despite it being complete in all respects. 2. Whether the pendency of SARFAESI proceedings should have been considered while deciding the Section 10 application. Decision: NCLAT dismissed the appeal, upholding the NCLT's order rejecting the Section 10 application. Discussion/Observations: 1. The NCLAT acknowledged that the Section 10 application met all procedural requirements and the Appellant was not disqualified under Section 11 of the IBC. 2. However, the Tribunal noted the Appellant's conduct, stating: \"We notice that the Appellant was selectively approaching the Bank requesting for some reprieve but was deliberately avoiding the Bank in the proceedings being conducted for being a wilful defaulter. This glaring duplicity in the conduct of the Appellant as pointed out by the Respondent Bank has also been taken cognisance of by the Adjudicating Authority in concluding that the Appellant has come before it with unclean hands.\" 3. The NCLAT observed that SARFAESI proceedings had reached an advanced stage before the Section 10 application was filed. The Tribunal stated: \"All these steps under the SARFAESI proceedings had therefore clearly preceded the filing of the Section 10 application by the Appellant.\" 4. The NCLAT agreed with the NCLT's assessment that the Appellant was \"making all out efforts to stall the process in one way or the other, by abuse of process of law.\" 5. Regarding the Appellant's multiple legal actions, the NCLAT observed: \"When we take a holistic view of the entire conspectus of facts, it does not escape notice that the Appellant was trying to embroil the Respondent Bank in multiple layers of litigation.\" 6. The Tribunal emphasized that while Section 10 provides rights to Corporate Debtors, it should not be misused. Case Name: M/s Agroha Paper Industries Private Limited Vs. Bank of Maharashtra Case No: Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 1342 of 2023 Tribunal: NCLAT Principal Bench Judge: [Justice Ashok Bhushan] Chairperson [Barun Mitra] Member (Technical) Citation: [2024] IBCInsights [198] NCLAT (PB) Date: 25.07.2024 #IBC2016 #Insolvency #CorporateLaw #LegalUpdates #IBCUpdates #IBCNews #InsolvencyJudgments #NCLATJudgments #IBCLawyer #CIRP #539\n\nINSIGHTFUL Conversation, at INSOL India Seminar on 'Navigating the Insolvency & Restructuring Landscape: Looking Ahead' - A Glimpse into IBC's Journey with Dr. M.S. Sahoo. At our recent session, a first of its kind, featured an in-depth conversation between Dr. M. S. Sahoo, the first Chairperson of the IBBI and Pooja Mahajan Managing Partner, Chandhiok & Mahajan, Advocates and Solicitors. This unique session provided a rare glimpse into Dr. Sahoo's journey with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and his leadership in shaping its evolution. Key Takeaways - IBBI as a regulator: Dr. Sahoo spoke about his journey with various regulators including SEBI, CCI and ICSI and how IBBI is a Regulator like no other, highlighting the unique position of IBBI as a regulator of profession, markets and utilities. - ⁠Journey with IBBI: Dr. Sahoo shared his experience of the initial days of IBBI and how IBBI has evolved over time. He shared anecdotes and instances to highlight the innovation and responsiveness of IBBI in addressing various challenges in the initial years such as the speed at which IBBI amended the regulations to enable homebuyers to file their claims in Jaypee’s insolvency process. He also spoke about the initial challenges faced by IBBI vis-a-vis its relationship with the Tribunals (NCLTs) and the efforts taken towards mutual appreciation of each others’ roles. - ⁠Performance Evaluation of IBC: IBC’s performance cannot be measured by percentage of recovery alone. Dr. Sahoo spoke about the need to link realisation for creditors with value of assets on the ground. He highlighted IBC’s success in achieving its primary objective of resolution of stress through either resolution plans or liquidation, noting improvements in market practices, efficiency and credit culture. - ⁠Role of CoCs: Dr. Sahoo shared his views on having a code of conduct for CoC and why regulation of CoC would not result in regulatory overlap. Giving example of regulation of certain activities by SEBI, he explained how regulation of entity is different from regulation of activity. He also dwelled on general vs. sector regulation and need to have one regulator to regulate and enforce insolvency norms. - ⁠Position of Operational Creditors: Dr. Sahoo addressed the ongoing debate about the role of operational creditors, acknowledging the need for a more equitable distribution mechanism in insolvency proceedings. - ⁠Future Reforms: He called for ongoing reforms to adapt to market changes, emphasizing flexibility and market preparedness over rigid statutory mandates. Dr. Sahoo's reflections, drawn from his pioneering role as the first Chairperson of the IBBI Board, underscore the importance of adaptability, market efficiency, and equitable practices in refining the insolvency process. His insights are crucial as we move looking ahead to the next phase of IBC reforms. #INSOLIndia #IBBI #IBCReforms #Restructuring #MarketEfficiency #CreditCulture #FutureOfIBC #Leadership\n\nVoluntary Closure of Companies There are two routes for voluntary closure of a company, namely, one under the Companies Act, 2013 for companies with no assets, no liabilities, and no litigation, and the other under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 for solvent companies. The former is a process culminating in the striking-off of its name from the register. Striking-off under the Companies Act, 2016 took an average of 500 days till 2022. Then came C-PACE (Centralised Processing for Accelerated Corporate Exit through the 2022-23 budget, which simplified and streamlined the process. The closure through C-PACE, which has struck off 14,390 companies, takes less than 90 days now. This illustrates the importance of process reforms for supply-side efficiency. A piece by Mr. Sanjeev Sanyal and Ms. Aakanksha Arora highlights such an impressive outcome from process reforms in voluntary closure. #voluntaryclosure #processreforms #C-PACE\n\nThe Expert Committee, under the Chairmanship of Dr. T.K. Vishwanathan was constituted by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), to examine the scope of use of mediation in respect of processes under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code). Dr. Vishwanathan handed over the Report to Mr. Ravi Mital, Chairperson, IBBI at IBBI office in New Delhi recently. Members of the Expert Committee apart from myself, Sumant Batra and member secretary Santosh Shukla were also present during the handover. Other members of the esteemed Committee included Dr Rajiv Mani and Shardul Shroff. The Expert Committee in its Report has made recommendations on the likely framework for the introduction of mediation as a complementary mechanism for resolution of disputes around the processes under the Code. The mediation framework under the Code, as recommended by the Committee, would best operate as a self-contained blueprint within the Code, with independent infrastructure to ensure that the objectives of the Code are met without compromising or diluting the basic structure of the Code in terms of timelines, public rights, etc. In consonance with the Mediation Act, 2023, the Committee has recommended a voluntary mediation framework under the Code. The Committee has taken a cautious approach and endeavoured to balance the fundamental objectives of the Code, i.e., “time-bound reorganization” and “maximization of value”, with autonomy to parties to voluntarily opt for the ‘out-of-court’ mediation process to enhance the efficiency of the insolvency resolution process. The Committee has recommended a phased introduction of voluntary mediation as a dispute resolution mechanism under the Code while maintaining the sanctity of the timelines for various existing insolvency resolution processes. The core essence of the framework is its independence and flexibility to provide room for quick incorporation of implementational learning.\n\nIntervention Allowed in Section 7 Proceedings Background: The matter relates to an application filed by Suraksha Realty Limited and Lakshdeep Investments and Finance Private Limited (Applicants), who are the Successful Resolution Applicants (SRAs) of Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), seeking impleadment as respondents/interveners in an ongoing insolvency proceeding against Jaypee Healthcare Ltd. (Corporate Debtor) initiated by J.C. Flowers Asset Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. (Financial Creditor) under Section 7 of the IBC. Issues: 1) Whether the Applicants, being SRAs of JIL (holding company of the Corporate Debtor), have locus standi to intervene in the insolvency proceedings against the Corporate Debtor. 2) Relevance and applicability of the Supreme Court's observations in Jaypee Kensington case regarding the rights of Resolution Applicants of JIL. Decision: The NCLT, Allahabad Bench, allowed the application for impleadment of the Applicants as respondents/interveners in the insolvency proceedings against the Corporate Debtor. Discussion/Observations: 1) Generally, in a Section 7 petition, only the Financial Creditor and Corporate Debtor are necessary parties. However, the NCLT recognized the unique factual matrix, where the Applicants are SRAs of the holding company (JIL) of the Corporate Debtor. 2) The NCLT noted the Supreme Court's observation in Jaypee Kensington case that the Resolution Plan deals with the assets of JIL, and shares held by JIL in the Corporate Debtor are considered JIL's assets (Para 186). 3) The NCLAT order dated 13.10.2023 held that there is no bar to hearing the Section 7 application, and all issues shall remain open (Para 13). 4) The Applicants' Resolution Plan would impact the financial health and operations of JIL and the Corporate Debtor (JIL's subsidiary). 5) For implementing the Applicants' Resolution Plan, it is significant that SRAs of JIL be heard as necessary and proper parties to resolve the Financial Creditor's debt against the Corporate Debtor. 6) The Applicants, being SRAs of the holding company (JIL), have become rightful candidates to work out a viable solution and have a limited right to intervene. In view of the above, the NCLT allowed the Applicants' impleadment as respondents/interveners in the insolvency proceedings against the Corporate Debtor. Case Name: Suraksha Reality Limited Vs. J.C. Flowers Asset Reconstructions Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. Case No: IA NO.535/2023 IN CP (IB) NO.512/ALD/2019 Tribunal: NCLT Allahabad Bench Judge: Mr. Praveen Gupta, Member (Judicial); & Mr. Ashish Verma, Member (Technical) Citation: [2024] IBCInsights [44] NCLT (New Delhi) Date: 08.04.2024 #IBC2016 #Insolvency #CorporateLaw #LegalUpdates #IBCUpdates #IBCNews #InsolvencyJudgments #NCLTJudgments #IBCLawyer #CIRP #414\n\nCorporate Guarantee's Validity and Lenders' Rights in Consortium Lending Background: The appeal challenged an order initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against M/s. B.P. Bansal Agritech Private Limited (Corporate Debtor), which had provided a Rs.181.29 crore corporate guarantee for credit facilities to M/s. B.P. Food Products Private Limited (Principal Borrower) from a consortium including IDBI Bank Limited (Respondent No. 1). Key Issues: 1) Validity of the corporate guarantee under Section 186 of Companies Act, 2013 2) Lenders' right to initiate action against the guarantor 3) Going concern status of the Corporate Debtor Decision: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dismissed the appeal, upholding initiation of CIRP against the Corporate Debtor. Observations: 1) The Corporate Debtor and Principal Borrower were family-owned group companies controlled by the same people, so avoiding guarantee obligations was unjustified. 2) Relevant clauses in agreements allowed lenders to proceed against the guarantor, with support from court precedents on third-party beneficiary rights under trusts. 3) The meager settlement offers against the huge guarantee amount and the Corporate Debtor's poor financial health negated the going concern plea. 4) The facts distinguished this case from cited judgments like Rakshit Doshi vs. IDBI Bank. Hence, NCLAT upheld initiating CIRP against the Corporate Debtor based on the valid corporate guarantee to the consortium and lenders' rights against the guarantor. Case Name: Shri Prem Prakash Bansal Vs. M/s. IDBI Bank Limited & Anr. Case No: Comp. App. (AT) (Ins) No. 1541 of 2022 Tribunal: NCLAT Principal Bench Judge: [Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain] Member (Judicial) [Mr. Naresh Salecha] Member (Technical) [Mr. Indevar Pandey] Member (Technical) Citation: [2024] IBCInsights [98] NCLAT (PB) Date: 10.04.2024 #IBC2016 #Insolvency #CorporateLaw #LegalUpdates #IBCUpdates #IBCNews #InsolvencyJudgments #NCLATJudgments #IBCLawyer #CIRP #406"
