        "text": "It's fortunate fisherman have stamina. All that staring at streams as time drips by will prove useful training for ­watching this self-funded, ­self-distributed film about a high-end brand of angling gear. Hardy's of ­Alwick are \"the Rolls Royce of fishing ­equipment\". If it's a supple split bamboo rod you're after, or a smooth-as-silk reel with dreamy torque, Hardy's is your shop of choice (Prince Charles is an especial fan of their 1912 range). The Lost World is half-promo, half-elegy, a lugubriously paced hymn to beautiful utilitarianism. Men reminisce, in sheds, about ­sanding. Bucolic piano tinkles away. There's old footage of tweedy gents grinning through their pipes as they display lightly flapping salmon. It's charming. For the first half-hour, at least. Then, it's like mainlining Nightol."
