        "text": "Born in 1927, Jim finished his education at Uppingham in 1944, and then served with the Derbyshire Yeomanry in North Africa and the 15th/19th King’s Royal Hussars in Palestine. In 1948 he took a special engineering apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong in Newcastle before joining the Hardy fishing tackle business, where he spent a year ‘working at the bench’ and learning the ropes in various departments. He then qualified in work-study engineering before setting up the company’s own Work-Study Department. He joined the board in 1959 as Works Director and in 1967, shortly after the firm was bought by the Harris & Sheldon Group, was appointed Marketing Director. It was partly due to his efforts that Hardy’s fortunes improved dramatically in the home and overseas markets.\n\nLike all Hardys, Jim was a fervent and very knowledgeable fisherman, having been first introduced to the sport at the age of seven. A formidable competition caster, he won three Professional Casting Championships at world championship level and took 35 British and All-Comers Professional Casting records.\n\nHe retired from the company in 1992, after 44 years, but was retained as a consultant, often being seen in the factory taking a keen interest in the business. He spent many years researching the history of the company and writing a book, The House the Hardy Brothers Built, which was published in 1998 by The Medlar Press.\n\nHis wife Gwynne, who died last year, was also a keen angler, and they lived just a few miles from Alnwick, in his beloved Northumbrian countryside. Jim is survived by their two children, Roy and Rona.\n\nThe Lost World of Mr Hardy featuring Jim Hardy was a critically acclaimed success – watch the trailer below…\n\nThe Lost World of Mr Hardy (trailer) from Trufflepig Films on Vimeo.\n\nThis is the story of an angling passion over the centuries.\n\nAs a boy, mad keen on fly fishing, I was fascinated with the legendary Hardy’s, the ‘Rolls Royce of angling’. 25 years later, I realise just how special a place Hardy’s still have in the hearts of anglers everywhere. I wanted to know why, to find out how that name came to mean so much more than just fishing to so many people all over the world.\n\nA film journey across 135 years was the result.\n\nThe Lost World of Mr Hardy is being hailed as a ‘modern classic’, read what the critics are saying:\n\n“Spectacular… I defy you to watch with a dry eye”\n\nKen Russell, THE TIMES\n\n“Savour the glory… relish every minute.”\n\nFieldsports magazine\n\n“Unmissable. Buy it now.”\n\nClassic Angling magazine\n\n“I can’t recommend it highly enough!”\n\nFly Fishing and Fly Tying magazine\n\nHeike Bachelier and Andy Heathcote completed their feature length documentary film The Lost World of Mr Hardy in 2008.
