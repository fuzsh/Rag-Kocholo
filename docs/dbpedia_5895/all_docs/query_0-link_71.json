        "text": "Jim Hardy, the man who was the last direct link to the original Hardy fishing tackle company, has passed away. This is a loss to not only the British fishing community, but to anglers everywhere.\n\nBorn in 1927, Jim would study engineering before going to work for his family's legendary company. Even though his family owned the company, Jim started out at the bottom, working his way up through the ranks. This allowed him to learn all the aspects of the Hardy Tackle company. He joined the company's board in 1959 as \"Works Director\". In 1967 he became Hardy's marketing director.\n\nIt is no secret that through Jim Hardy's efforts the company expanded & grew both domestically in Great Britain & throughout the globe - especially in America. New products & advertising campaigns had new anglers discovering the company & older anglers coming back to them.\n\nJim was a masterful & knowledgeable angler as well. Having started fishing at age seven, Jim was a world class fly casting champion. He won three professional casting championships at world championship level & took 35 British & all-comers professional casting records.\n\nHe retired in 1992, after 44 years, but stayed busy with the company as a consultant. He was (rightfully so) proud of the Hardy company & it's legacy of success & quality. In 1998 his book \"The House The Hardy Brothers Built\" was published in which he chronicled the history & legacy of the world-renowned company. He can also be seen at length in interviews in the movie \"The Lost World of Mr. Hardy.\"\n\nJim Hardy was a quiet legend in the fly fishing world. He will be sadly missed.\n\nTo read more about Jim Hardy, please go HERE."
