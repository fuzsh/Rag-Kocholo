        "text": "\"A wonderful story of fishing and business and history\".I rarely buy DVDs, because 99.99% of those I see for sale aren't worth watching once, never mind a second time. But I'd highly recommend \"The Lost World of Mr. Hardy\" -- it would make a superb Christmas present for a fly angler.Eric Sharp, Detroit Free Press Newspaper (Oct '10)\n\nProjections Film Review WebsiteAny fly fisherman worth his hackle knows that Hardy’s continues to represent the ideal of a simpler time. “The Lost World of Mr. Hardy” is a loving benediction to that time and to a company that lived, floundered and still found a way to keep that ideal alive in the hearts and minds of all sportsmen.Dennis King, Projections (Oct '10)\n\n\"A spectacular new fishing documentary casts its spell\" - THE TIMESGo fishing. That’s exactly what you’ll want to do after seeing the spectacular new documentary film The Lost World of Mr Hardy. Made by the director Andy Heathcote and his partner Heike Bachelier with the same care, gentle humour and true aim with which a fishing devotee casts his line into sparkling water, the story follows the rise, fall and rebirth of the premier family-based fishing equipment manufacturer, Hardy’s of Alnwick.Ken Russell The Times (30th Oct 09)\n\n\"Equal to any Hollywood production...but with soul\".Regardless of subject matter, it is an exceptional documentary. The fact that it is about one of fly fishing’s great marques is a bonus. If fly fishing means more to you than just catching fish, you should have this DVD..Brad Harris, Flylife Magazine (June 09) Read full article\n\n\"One of the finest works of its kind ever filmed\"The film is much more than just a chronicle of the Hardy Bros. firm. It is a social history of Britain, a technological history of fishing, and a social commentary on the modern world, all rolled up into one neat and graceful motion picture. It is also as one of the finest works of its kind ever filmed. Perhaps Jim Hardy summed it up best when, while viewing a forgotten Hardy film..., he turned to his companion Ian Blagburn. “This is history,” he quipped, “and it’s visible.” One might say the same thing about The Lost World of Mr. Hardy. .Dr Todd Larson Fishing for History (May 09) Read full article\n\n\"I've already started raving about it\"The slow-moving, languid style of the documentary suits its subject matter perfectly, and you find yourself transported into another world, when quality products were built with love and care, to last forever. It’s not preaching to the converted: while fishermen of all types will delight in this film, it’s geared to the layman, too, as the story it tells is universal. Oh, and it’s beautifully shot, too, and weighted as precisely as an expert cane-rod fly cast.Alex Leith editor, Viva Lewes What's On Guide (May 09)\n\n\"Savour the glorious story...relish every minute\".Set aside an hour and a half of your time, close the door and settle into an easy chair. Then watch The Lost World of Mr. Hardy and savour the glorious story of how a small company from the tiny town of Alnwick in Northumberland managed to capture the very hearts and minds of anglers throughout the world. Angling purists, anyone who has North East connections, avid Hardy collectors and everyone who respects traditional craftsmanship will relish every minute of this film, a firstclass documentary that entertains, teaches and inspires in equal measure.Jason Hill, Fieldsports Magazine (Autumn 08)\n\nTaunted by WatersPressure of space in Trout Fisherman’s review section meant that the books squeezed out this delightful DVD. No way could I let it pass into the ‘out’ tray un-noted, however.I had two reservations as I slid it into the DVD player: firstly, that it would be a dry, earnest and ultimately dull backtrack through the annals of Britain’s famous Hardy company. Secondly, that it would show every sign of the director being in thrall to the company’s PR department.Completely wrong on both counts. As fascinating as it is independent, Andy Heathcote and Heike Bachelier’s film fuses grainy footage and photographs from the company’s past with an enchanting score composed by Stephen Daltry.Always staying the right side of sentimentality, it is an oral history; its script written as it happened by the recollections of men who invested much of their working life in what is a British angling institution. To a man, they are noticeably unfaltering in their speech and memories; a sign, perhaps, of people discussing a passion rather than just a job.And the PR people, you suspect, got nowhere near it. The camera is unflinching as it records the visible unease of the managing director recalling the sleepless nights he had while preparing to implement the fresh directions in which he felt Hardys had to move.Flyfishing is not without its ugliness, be it pollution, declining stocks or the anti-social jerk who thinks his fly box is covered by the Official Secrets Act. Yet it retains a calm and gentleness capable of enchanting even the outsider. For all the wistfulness of its tale, The Lost World of Mr Hardy captures those qualities perfectly and is a credit to its makers and Hardy alike.Jeffrey Prest, editor Trout Fisherman magazine writing in Taunted by Waters (Nov 08)\n\n\"Unmissable. Buy it now\".Ah, but those golden days! Hardy was once the biggest employer in the Northumberland town of Alnwick. For fishermen, a trip to London and visiting Hardy’s in Pall Mall was akin to seeing Buckingham Palace. Hardy ruled the world, supplying tackle to maharajahs, film stars and royalty. The film-makers, Andy Heathcote and Heike Bachelier, tell the Hardy story with sympathy and a touch of hope, not for Hardy’s perhaps, but for those who still believe in hand-making beautiful things. Every reader of this magazine will love this DVD ... it has pace, some wonderful anecdotes, sensitive filming and tight editing. You know the ending, but you won’t want it to end. Enhanced by great footage from the Hardy archives of the 1920s, including a quite wonderful sequence of a ghillie doing all the hard work with a 40lb Norwegian salmon, while the angler claims the glory and leaves the ghillie to carry back both rod and fish. Unmissable. Buy it now.Keith Elliott, Classic Angling Magazine (July 08)\n\n\"Essential\"The Lost World Of Mr. Hardy tells the story of the Hardy tackle company by way of glorious archive films and photographs, and interviews with current and retired Hardy workers, with contributions from modern independent craftsmen, notably reel maker Chris Lythe and rod maker Edward Barder. It is nostalgic and romantic. On one level an historic record, on another a lament for lost manufacturing prowess... Simply, you are left wanting more. This is a beautiful film, several cuts above much angling viewing, and one that could be broadcast on mainstream television. Essential. Richard Baker Richard Baker, Trout & Salmon Magazine (May 08\n\n\"I can't recommend it highly enough\"When The Lost World of Mr Hardy arrived I sat down to grab a few minutes viewing over a cup of coffeee. Ninety three minutes later I watched the last frame... We can get the film quality out of the way quite quickly: superb image quality, first class editing, excellent sound, pleasing original music. A good start then... An exceptionally well made, hugely entertaining and thought-provoking documentary - I can't recommend it highly enough!Magnus Angus, Fly Fishing & Fly Tying Magazine (May 08)\n\nVerdict: 10/10Filmmakers Andy Heathcote and Heike Bachelier have created an excellent documentary and the big companies could learn a thing from these two independent film makers. This DVD will appeal to all who have a passion for angling and I think it will be a future classic. I therefore give it 10 out of 10.Bryan Baron, Fishingmagic.com website (April 08)\n\n\"A lush and beautifully made film\"...and a real treat for anyone interested in the traditions of quality vintage fishing tackle and the history of Hardy's. The filming is excellent and has the feel of a big screen production rather than that of a television documentary. You will find no snappy editing or quick 'bites'; there is plenty of time to enjoy the places and the people involved, both past and present, in making fine fishing tackle. The music has been specially composed by Stephen Daltry, and I am sure many will be ordering the film score music CD when it is available from Trufflepig Films.The Lost World of Mr.Hardy is a film to enjoy again and again, not just for the information but for a hefty dose of that misty, nostalgic comfort of the past. It shows the age of the British Empire, when Hardy's were at the top of their game, their fishing tackle the best, created mostly by hand in Alnwick by the people who used it. The film has been described as a 'requiem' for British manufacturing in the face of global competition, but that aspect is almost incidental to the main theme, which is the very human story behind the manufacture of what was the finest fishing tackle in the world.Malcolm Cullen, Pure Piscator Website,Read full article (opens new window at PurePiscator.com)\n\n\"Only the best is good enough for fishermen\"... and though it was fishing tackle that John James Hardy Jr. had in mind when he uttered that line near the end of the 19th century, after viewing this documentary one might surmise that J.J.'s words are indeed prophetic, as they have come to embrace the efforts of Heathcote and Bachelier and their film, The Lost World of Mr. Hardy.Though The Lost World could stand alone on the anecdotes of former Hardys directors and employees or perhaps even composer, Stephen Daltrys' music, particularly intriguing is the way the filmmakers chose to incorporate present-day rod and reel makers, Edward Barder and Chris Lythe ... their inclusion brings the film full-circle and thus fulfills Andy Heathcote's desire that we \"Be inspired by a poignant reflection of the world we live in and the myriad ways it has changed over 130 years.\"As I reflected on my first go at The Lost World of Mr Hardy, I found myself at once, not only wrestling with a sense of loss, but also nuturing rekindled feelings of adoration for those who churned out and stamped their intitials into my Hardy reels ... one reel at a time.Shoeless Joe, Clarks Classic Fly Rod Forum\n\n\"Bravo! Encore!I have just watched The Lost World of Mr Hardy. Wonderful! I feel like I’ve just been to the cinema and am still totally captured by the experience. What keeps coming to my mind is how this is just such a superb, magnificent story, capturing our changing world over the years up until our modern day so very well. How different is the language of today’s contemporary manager. Equally interesting for non-anglers, the film manages to show the real value of craftsmen and of the handmade. Touching interviews. Humour and wisdom. Once again: wonderful!\"Ralf Koss, Journalist (Cologne, Germany)"
