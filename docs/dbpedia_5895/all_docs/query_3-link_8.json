        "text": "The Lost World of Mr. Hardy (2008, UK)\n\nThe Lost World of Mr. Hardy is a documentary film about the story of a much loved family fishing tackle business and the struggle for craftsmanship in our modern world. It is also an astonishing story of how a passion for angling and a love of craftsmanship created one of the most interesting, quirky and best loved British companies ever.\n\n“Mister Jim” is how the employees respectfully addressed their boss Jim Hardy, the last of the family to work for the firm and now retired.\n\nHis Grandfather and Great-Uncle, opened a small shop in the far north of England in 1873. Both passionate fisherman, they invented fishing tackle. Their skill, devotion, and innovative marketing strategies allowed them to conquer the world. Hardy’s fishing tackle was adored by royalty (Prince Charles is an especial fan of their 1912 range), maharajas and film stars alike. “The Rolls Royce of fishing equipment”, their attention to detail and quality brought fulfilment and pride to a work place where whole generations of families worked together. The name Hardy’s has been synonymous with the best in angling for more than a century.\n\n“Only the best is good enough for fisherman” said J.J. Hardy at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThis film uniquely captures the essence of why people are so engrained with the history and tradition of fly fishing. Despite a poignant reflection of the world over the past hundred years, it’s said that fly fisherman to this day remain deeply rooted in tradition with a respect and appreciation for the history of fly fishing.\n\nFor more information, click here.\n\nI find it very inspiring to watch people who spend their working lives in the pursuit of perfection and quality in the drastic changes in our culture we live in. There’s something special about the longevity of the craftsmanship that makes me want be a part of.\n\n-N."
