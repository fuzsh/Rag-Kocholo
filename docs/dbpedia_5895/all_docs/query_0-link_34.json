        "text": "The Lost World of Mr Hardy Trailer\n\nTrailer from the film The Lost World of Mr Hardy\n\nClick Here for the Hatches review\n\n\"Only the best is good enough for fisherman\" said J.J. Hardy at the end of the 19th century and how right he was. The name Hardy has been synonymous with the best in angling for 135 years, a name to stir the heart of many a fisherman.\n\nâMister Jimâ is how the employees respectfully addressed their boss Jim Hardy, the last of the family to work for the firm and now retired. His Grandfather and Great-Uncle, opened a small shop in the far north of England in 1873. Both passionate fisherman, they invented fishing tackle. Their skill, devotion, and innovative marketing strategies allowed them to conquer the world. Kings, Queens and Maharajahs loved them and the name Hardy's has been synonymous with fishing for more than a century.\n\nExperience a beautiful, evocative film about the people who have spent their working lives in the pursuit of perfect fishing tackle.\n\nSee long forgotten films capturing an incredible world of 80 years ago with unbelievable rivers full of enormous salmon.\n\nDiscover a new world of rod and reel makers still working by hand today and the magic and elegance of the world's very best fishing tackle.\n\nBe inspired by a poignant reflection of the world we live in and the myriad ways it has changed over 130 years.\n\nCelebrate quality, the longevity of the craftsman's hand and the essence of angling."
