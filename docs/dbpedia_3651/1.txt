What a mess of a narrative! Jerry Lewis' character George tries to do three things: establish himself as a legitimate business man, get some shady money for his legit business, and convince his soon-to-be-ex-wife that he's trustworthy. They also throw in story lines from a nurse/Girl Guide leader and a dental hygienist for some reason.

Get off the phone, George.

In Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River (1967), George's scenes with Pamela, the wife (Jacqueline Pearce) are charming. The film should have stayed with the two of them more. When he's not with Pamela the movie drags on through some convoluted plot about microfilm implanted in someone's tooth.

Pamela is not amused

It pains me to say that I cannot recommend this film except to the most avid Jerry Lewis fans.

But I mention it mostly for the intro under the credits. Danny Street sings the title song. Jerry Lewis wears a smart dark suit, narrow tie, fashionably slim-legged, high-water pants, an anachronistic bowler hat and carries an umbrella while sauntering down the streets of London for a good two minutes until the title song goes off.

I love it! It's like a music video before that term was coined. You can see a few people on the street glance his way every now and then. Are they extras? Are they just random people going about their day who happen to see someone who looks like a movie star?

Why do I love this intro? I haven't the vaguest notion. The simple elegance of it, perhaps.

It reminded me of the Justin Timberlake video for "I'm Lovin' It" in which the music star just casually walks down a crowded street to an upbeat catchy tune.

Jerry Paris directs. Terry-Thomas is on hand to elevate the comedy.
