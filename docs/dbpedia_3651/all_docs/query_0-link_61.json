        "text": "My first really bad review appeared in my hometown newspaper, The New York Times. The piece that garnered this unique honor was my string sextet Soul Garden, which I had composed for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. I had written it specifically for a virtuoso violist, Paul Neubauer, to perform with the cellist Fred Sherry and the Miami Quartet. At the time I considered it my finest composition to date.\n\nApart from one short notice when, as a 15-year-old, I performed the Copland Clarinet Concerto (“A truly exceptional talent!”) it was my second review from the Grey Lady. The first was a brief mention of my clarinet concerto Voices, which I had performed with the American Composers Orchestra three years earlier at Carnegie Hall. The review had been lukewarm at best, but I managed to excavate a favorable clause. “If you can eke out one good quote, that’s all you need,” my Dad cheerfully reassured me.\n\nThe premiere performances of Soul Garden went well, better than I had expected, considering the difficulty of the piece. During the previous decade I'd been developing a personal system of musical notation, using quarter-tones and glissandi to evoke the expressive microtonality of gospel music. It took a good deal of work for the performers to fully integrate these stylistic techniques into their playing. With Soul Garden I felt that I had begun to create my own language, manifest in the harmony, melody, and counterpoint; it was an important aesthetic and conceptual jump forward for me.\n\nSo late that Monday evening, I was hanging out with my buddy Dave at a bar on the Lower East Side. Before biking home to Brooklyn over the Williamsburg Bridge, I decided to stop at a bodega to check the early edition Times. I lingered on the street corner, paging impatiently through the newspaper: Water wars in Bolivia… environmental catastrophe at Superfund sites… political corruption in Queens politics… horse racing… where was the classical music? Finally I located the arts section, a slim sheaf of pages near the back. My review! Well, actually, it was Paul Neubauer’s review. And it looked quite favorable… until I reached the section about Soul Garden, where the tone took a sour turn.\n\nEach victim recalls this traumatic moment differently. Some remember every reprehensible word, taking a masochistic pleasure in reading aloud the cruelest phrases, perhaps hoping that the brutal edges will gradually soften. Others, optimists, scour the few lines of text for all they’re worth, seeking to dredge from the muck a vaguely positive – or even neutral – spin. With what other experience can it be compared? Perhaps a sudden, bitter breakup…a few stark words etched instantly into the jilted lover’s brain. In this particular instance, I retained most vividly the summing-up: “Bluesy notions hardly worth a sideways glance.”\n\nI felt a keen pang in my stomach and my mouth dropped open. There it was: the public record of my piece, the final word, all that would remain for eternity. Naturally it would never be played again; this bad review would hang around Soul Garden’s proverbial neck like a weighty albatross. I couldn’t fathom it. How could the reviewer write this, believe this? Bluesy notions, hell no! It was a finely wrought piece, and a creative one.\n\nOr was it? Maybe it wasn’t… I pondered furiously. It needed minor revisions, it’s true; that middle section especially needed a few bars added. Or subtracted. But no, it was basically ready for prime time. The critic just didn’t comprehend it, that was the bottom line. Or perhaps it wasn’t so much the piece he had disliked, but the performance. Or the notes I had written in the program book. That might have been the deciding factor… I suppose I hadn’t fully explained that I was trying to do something as yet untried, that I wasn’t using quarter-tones in a “stereotypical” way, that I had found a novel method of embedding jazz embellishments into notated music, a brand new approach to melodic contour. His ignorance was at fault. I fumed that this so-called aficionado was incapable of grasping the significance and future ramifications of my experimental techniques and ideas.\n\nI flashed back to the pre-concert discussion on the stage: had I spoken too casually about my innovations? Perhaps the critic thought I wasn’t serious enough. Maybe I hadn’t articulated clearly what the piece was about. Had the moderator neglected to ask pertinent questions? (I tried to remember — what were those questions again?) Somewhere out there in the audience this critic, armed with a pen, had lurked, plotted. He misunderstood my musical language, and now he was punishing me, taking revenge, determined to ruin my reputation. He was my enemy, vengeful and cackling! Why did he detest me and my music?\n\nOverwrought, I watched yellow taxis filing onto the bridge. On a sudden impulse, I reread the review – twice. Slowly, and with grim intensity, I recognized that he hadn’t hated it. Hah! If only he had hated it… In fact he had dismissed it, trivialized it. He had chosen a noun, a plural noun that evoked banality, a label that reduced my music to an insignificant distraction, that brushed away my precious, hard-earned notes as if they were fluff, detritus, random dots on a scrap of manuscript paper. I conjured the main theme in my head. I carefully considered the cadenza. Maybe he was right, maybe the piece only added up to a few worthless, bluesy notions. I racked my brain: why “notions”? Why had he chosen that particular word?\n\nI don’t remember the ride home over the Williamsburg Bridge, nor do I recall locking my bike on South 2nd Street and lumbering up the stairs to my second floor apartment in the silent, wee hours of the morning. I vaguely remember phoning my girlfriend; she listened to me babble for a while, and finally sighed exhaustedly, “Jesus, just get over it!” (I had woken her up and she had work at 6am the next morning.) Most of the night I lay suspended in bed-ridden time, trapped in an endless spiral of thoughts: the review, the performance, the pre-concert talk, the composition, the misunderstanding, my career, the shame of it all.\n\nThe public shame! Everyone would know, and if they didn’t already, they would eventually find out. They would read the article in The New York Times, of course. They would flip past tales of world wars, economic crises, sports victories, endearing human interest stories, cutting-edge scientific advances, and like homing pigeons they would inevitably race to section C to seek out those few sentences in a review of a viola recital. A review with no photo, even, just a few terse paragraphs comprised of phrases, one of them deadly and dismissive, and belonging solely to me. Bluesy notions. Not even worth a glance….hardly! Hardly worth a sideways glance….\n\nI was referred by sympathetic friends to the Lexicon of Musical Invective, Nicholas Slonimsky’s witty compilation that recaps centuries of harsh reviews of masterpieces, beginning with Beethoven’s 2nd Symphony. I glumly checked out a copy from the public library the following week and devoured the generations of vitriol, chortling vociferously to myself as I devoured pistachios. Unfortunately the panacea ultimately proved less effective than envisioned. Though I too had received a lousy review in a prestigious journal, I remained unconvinced that this misfortune automatically placed me alongside the likes of Debussy, Mahler, and Copland.\n\n**************************\n\nAs my Dad had suggested, artists probably put too much stake in reviews. The composer John Corigliano once told me that he hadn’t read them for years. John must be one of the few who doesn’t at least sneak a peek. I don’t have his strength; like most artists I possess a morbid fascination with critical opinion, especially when intelligently articulated.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, writing in The Paris New Music Review, a sardonic journal that I co-founded with several friends, I attempted to review a recently-released CD recording of electronic music. It took an agonizing month to complete the article, which ran no more than a few paragraphs. In the end I reluctantly recognized that I was a lousy critic; I couldn’t bring myself to write anything negative, being overly empathetic with the composers and unconvinced that my opinion – informed as it may have been – carried any real validity or importance.\n\nIt would be ten years before I was exposed to the viewpoint of the “other half,” at a lecture by Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times on the role of the music critic. Tony made several assertions that surprised me; first of all, he mentioned that all other attributes being equal, it was more important that a critic be an engaging writer than a musical scholar. His audience was the general public, Tony insisted, not necessarily other musicians (Tony is also an accomplished pianist). Of course, any journalist would have found these statements to be self-evident, but to me, who read reviews as personal vendettas, they were a revelation.\n\nAnd what about a seasoned composer’s perspective, one who actually reads reviews? Philip Glass once came in to speak with the young composers in my Making Score seminar at the New York Youth Symphony. During the talk one student, not particularly known for tact, raised his hand. “Mr. Glass,” he began earnestly, “I googled you and realized that you’ve had a LOT of bad reviews.”\n\nI cringed. Philip, however, smiled gently and replied, “Yes, that’s true; if you do something interesting and individual, you’re bound to get plenty of bad reviews.”\n\n“How does it make you feel when a writer doesn’t like your music and just keeps hating and hating on you in their reviews?”\n\nPhilip considered this question for a few seconds. “Well… of course, it doesn’t feel good, not at the time, I suppose. But you know, the thing about critics is…” and here he paused. “Eventually they die.”\n\nThe kids laughed, and I did too. But Philip’s face bore a faraway look.\n\n******************\n\nAbout five years before Philip’s visit, I had traveled to Los Angeles for a very cool gig. John Adams conducted my concerto, Voices, with the L.A. Philharmonic, with me as the soloist. From my vantage point, the audience seemed to dig it; they brought John and me back for several bows. The next morning both local papers were delivered to my hotel room door. Complimentary newspapers, featuring bad reviews…. really bad! Both were deathly dismal. The meaner of the two was from Alan Rich in the L.A. Weekly. “Silly symphony of squeaks and squawks!” he railed. I can’t deny that I felt embarrassed, but for some reason, this time I couldn’t manage to summon the bitterness sparked by “bluesy notions.” In fact, I remember thinking, “Wow, this guy must have worked pretty hard to come up with that alliterative phrase.” I was impressed. And suddenly, I burst out laughing.\n\nHad I reached a new level of maturity, acceptance, or maybe cynicism? Perhaps some combination of the above. Whatever the case, this first unsavory notice from Alan Rich was – unbeknownst to me – merely the opening salvo in what was to be a battery of harshness flowing from his typewriter for the next few seasons. Each time I returned to L.A. I was further lambasted: “A gooey conceit!” he wrote the following year. “A time-wasting piece!” he thundered. Now I was faced with a new challenge: a serial critic, out to murder my career! Alan Rich had it in for me; I felt sure that he arrived at every concert itching to launch poisonous barbs in my direction.\n\nAnd Alan Rich wasn’t just any critic. He was an important writer who had been reviewing concerts for decades and had championed such revolutionary composers as Feldman, Nancarrow, Reich, and indeed Bolcom and Adams, all musical heroes of mine. So I couldn’t easily dismiss his dismissal, or at least I didn’t feel that I had the right to do so. Betty Freeman, the photographer and philanthropist who commissioned my orchestral work Elixir, took a more belligerent attitude. “I am so angry at Alan Rich with all the nasty stuff he writes about you, I’ve stopped talking to him!” she snapped. “Oh, it doesn’t matter, you know,” I shrugged. But of course, secretly I loved hearing Betty rant on my behalf.\n\nDespite the Rich diatribes, L.A. did not give up on me. I was appointed composer-in-residence for three years with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, and shortly thereafter I received an invitation from the L.A. Philharmonic to write a work for their 2009-10 season. I was excited for these back-to-back performances, though somewhere in the back of my brain I envisioned Alan Rich gleefully preparing to eviscerate me. But at the opening of the L.A. Phil concert at Disney Hall, a P.A. announcement took me by surprise. “We are dedicating this concert to the memory of Alan Rich, devoted music critic for the L.A. Weekly, who died last week.” I half-gasped in my seat. Strangely, there was no feeling of victory, no schadenfreude, just a raw emptiness as the eulogy continued. “Alan supported contemporary music faithfully, and we have no doubt he would have been delighted that we’re featuring a world premiere tonight, by composer Derek Bermel.” Oh, irony of ironies. Need I mention that this process was repeated a month later, when the L.A. Chamber Orchestra presented my work, similarly dedicating the evening to Alan Rich?\n\nWhat a strange, ghostly rendez-vous at these concerts, Alan Rich and me. I felt no compulsion to dance on his grave; instead, I found myself moved by the tribute and applauded his mettle along with the rest of the audience. We then communally feasted our ears on that Bermel composition he surely would have detested. I had almost come to relish facing my nemesis, and perhaps I even harbored a perverse longing for the challenge; After all, I couldn’t be the bad boy in the room without an adversary present.\n\n“Eventually they die.” A witty retort; it sounded almost capricious! But no wonder Philip had stated it mirthlessly. In the end, critics are the only folks who convey to a wider public what we artists do. The absence of the music journalist, more and more common, cannot possibly be a positive development for us. By the nature of their profession, critics are marginalized — even ostracized — and yet they stay focused, independent from the allure and echo chamber of the “music biz,” mapping out the truth as they understand it. As the music critics disappear, so too does the public’s awareness of what we make, why we make it, and who we are. So as the bad reviews roll in, I try to seek a modicum of Zen, grateful that — at least for the time being — when my tree falls in the forest, it doesn’t fall on deaf ears.\n\nAs a wide-eyed and weary graduate student at the University of Michigan, I often referred to the local Kinko’s as my “second home”. Today Kinko’s has been swallowed up into the mega-vortex of a corporation known as FedEx, but at the time it was the 7-11 of copyshops, open 24 hours. These days, I occasionally find myself standing, stupefied, outside a FedEx Office storefront at 10:30pm, peering into the darkened edifice. My brain still cannot process the fact that the stores have a closing time, for in the age of portable printers, few all-night copy shops still remain. But throughout the ‘90s, the humming, fluorescent-lit, industrial-carpeted interior, featuring signs with bland fonts and pastel hues, were the comforting hallmarks of a timeless cocoon, complete with all the replicative needs of a young composer – self-service machines capable of double-sided printing (a rare commodity in that ancient era), paper-cutters, copious quantities of White-Out and correction tape, and plastic combs which could be deftly overlapped to bind tabloid-sized musical scores (the current generation of FedEx Office employees seem to have abandoned the skill – or the desire – to execute this rather mundane task, and it is therefore difficult to find a copyshop where the employees can operate the equipment with the kind of assured dexterity exhibited by a deadline-haunted composer).\n\nI begin with this extended soliloquy merely to emphasize how many working man-hours I spent xeroxing music – both my own and others’ scores. If a particular composition appealed to me – say Berio’s Sinfonia or Vivier’s Lonely Child – I’d haul it to Kinko’s and xerox it, then later study it, after which it would linger, its pages gradually yellowing and becoming brittle at the edges, perhaps at some point in the distant future either inviting closer scrutiny or subject to a re-xeroxing as a musical example for a talk or masterclass. At the time I had selected Porgy and Bess as a focus of my oral exam, and had managed through wily means to procure a full orchestrated score, which I spent hours painstakingly copying, back-to-back 11”x17”, late at night in the Ann Arbor Kinko’s.\n\nReturning home bleary-eyed from one such all-night sojourn, I encountered an eagerly blinking light on my answering machine, and was surprised to hear the voice of the music school’s dean, Paul Boylan, crackling through the speaker. “Derek, I wonder if you might call me tomorrow morning; I have a somewhat unusual request.”\n\nIt was already past 9am, and I decided to call before crashing in bed for the day. Boylan’s request was indeed unusual. “Do you have the next few days free?”\n\nActually I didn’t. A faculty member, Michael Webster, was performing my short solo clarinet piece Theme and Absurdities, which I had composed the previous year. I was looking forward to the program, which would take place at the Kerrytown Concert House. “Well, actually, I have a commitment—”\n\n“Do you know who Krzysztof Penderecki is?” Boylan asked. Of course I did; Penderecki was a name from the music history books. All music majors were familiar with the Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima, his groundbreaking work for strings that had extended the textural and sonic boundaries of orchestral writing. At 60, Penderecki was already a hallowed icon, royalty in the pantheon of modernist musical gods.\n\nBoylan continued, “He’s conducting a Polish orchestra on an American tour, and there’s an error in his itinerary; a driver was not booked between Ann Arbor and Chicago. They asked if I might be able to find somebody – like a student – and I thought of you. Interested?”\n\nI hesitated – Penderecki or Webster? I had rarely, if ever, missed a performance of one of my compositions.\n\n“Oh yes,” Boylan added, “I almost forgot to mention – the pay is $150 per day.” That last tidbit sealed the deal. After all, $600 would allow me to copy a hundred scores at Kinko’s, then send them to anonymously-judged competitions whereupon a jury of important composers would yawningly pore over my scrawl, assigning a random jumble of numerical values to my masterpiece.\n\nOn hanging up the phone I felt a surge of mystique and curiosity. Penderecki, a name from Larousse and Grout! A piece of history – not really a person – a paragraph of lore. Almost immediately a deep anxiety set in. I was familiar with the Threnody, Anaklasis, and De Natura Sonoris, pieces from the early ‘60s. But it was 1995; what had Penderecki been writing for the past thirty-odd years? I had no idea. I glanced at my watch. It was 9:30AM. The next day at this time I would be chauffeuring Krzysztof Penderecki and his wife Elżbieta across the Midwest. I imagined him leaning forward from the back seat and regarding me with a look of hauteur. “So, Mr. Bermel,” he would say, “pray tell, what do you know of my music?” And I would be embarrassingly stumped.\n\nI was dead tired from my all-night Kinko’s-fest, but I’d need to spend hours in the library, boning up on the Maestro’s recent oeuvre. I had a few hours before an afternoon class, then a few more before the evening concert he was conducting in Hill Auditorium – Penderecki, Mozart, Beethoven – the same program he was taking on tour. I imagined horrific scenarios: “So Mr. Bermel,” he would ask haughtily, “how did you enjoy last night’s concert?” “Uh… unfortunately I didn’t hear it, Maestro; I was too busy studying all that music of yours that I’d never bothered to listen to over these years.” No way! I’d have to somehow do it all.\n\nIt was the ‘90s. There was no internet, I couldn’t surf YouTube, browse Spotify, or log in to Rhapsody. There was only the University of Michigan Music Library, with scores, LPs, and a few CDs. Students were not allowed to check out recordings, so I spent most of the day with headphones glued to my skull, my nose buried in operatic and symphonic scores – St. Luke Passion, Rex Ubu, Canticum Canticorum, Lacrimosa, Polish Requiem, various concerti and symphonies. I learned that Penderecki had “invented” Neo-Romanticism (although today I could attribute that claim to at least a dozen other composers), that he loved large forms and had adopted a somewhat reactionary musical persona over the years, perhaps partially due to a complex and tortured relationship with the avant-garde (his predecessors Boulez, Stockhausen, and Xenakis, among others). An early enfant terrible, he soon perceived his own innovations in extended techniques to be an artistic straitjacket and yearned to incorporate them into a more expressive musical language. Later that night I read two biographies and an interview which touched on various details of his personal life, his relation to Catholicism, his love of nature, his early years spent playing violin and composing film scores.\n\nSo when I arrived at the Campus Inn the following morning at 7:30am, where the Lincoln Town Car awaited me – the same hotel, incidentally, where I would stay 12 years later when receiving, of all honors, the Paul Boylan Award – I felt as though I had known the maestro for years, my brain literally crammed, as it were, with trivea related to Penderecki’s life and work.\n\nHis wife Elżbieta greeted me warmly, though somewhat exhaustedly, as I opened the car’s rear door for her. I held it for her husband, but to my surprise he opened the front door and climbed into the seat next to mine. “Krzysztof!” he declared, extending his hand. Was he really going to ride shotgun? I think I shook it, but my face must have betrayed astonishment, because Penderecki nonchalantly explained, “My wife likes to ride in the back and read. In the front seat it makes her nauseous. But I prefer to converse.” So that was that; I was going to be chatting with Penderecki for several days!\n\nI felt cheerfully overprepared for conversation but didn’t know where to start, bursting as I was with a zillion factoids about his music and life. As we veered onto Route 23, heading south towards Toledo, I ventured: “So I understand that you are a connoisseur of trees. Did you happen to check out the Arboretum while you were in town?”\n\n“Yes, I do indeed like trees, but I didn’t visit there,” he replied.\n\n“Oh, that’s too bad!” I exclaimed. “It’s such a beautiful place, and it has 93 species of trees,” suddenly unsure both of the statistic’s accuracy and of why I had even recalled it in the first place (perhaps it had been drummed into our collective student unconscious).\n\n“My arboretum in Switzerland has over 900 species of trees,” he mused distractedly. A lengthy silence ensued. I gazed glumly ahead at the open landscape. “It’s gonna be a long trip,” I thought.\n\nPerhaps Penderecki was simply unimpressed with my opening salvo of idle chit-chat, but he seemed to bear no ill will, for when the conversation turned to music he became lively and congenial, and by the end of the trip we had hit it off.\n\nHe appeared amused at my familiarity with his extensive catalog, though his smirk betrayed an inkling that I had crammed last-minute for the ride. Along the way, I couldn’t help professing my admiration for Ligeti’s music. Penderecki considered that for a moment, then said, “Ligeti, yes, he is a fine composer. A miniaturist.” That was all he had to say on the subject, and I filed away this characterization for future consideration.\n\nIt was a moment of epiphany, in which I realized the futility of imploring an artist to comment on the work of a contemporary. Even the most charitable responses can seem obtuse, and not always for reasons of malice or even indifference. For what perspective can one really offer on one’s peers? The context in which their work has been created – i.e. the present age – is so close to home that it is probably wiser to avoid either praising it effusively or dismissing it cavalierly. Of course, many artists are quite openly nasty in assessing the work of their contemporaries and recent forebears, but with hindsight such observations often appear foolish and small-minded; certainly a healthy dose of egoism is needed to imagine that one’s own opinions – good or bad – about peers are particularly useful for others (outside of pure curiosity or gossip value).\n\nPenderecki listened closely to my music and made pointed observations. “You are an opera composer,” he said at one point, after hearing to my clarinet piece SchiZm. This echoed a similar statement George Crumb had made to me two years earlier, and I filed this away too, for later mulling over and general angst. He also spoke at great length about his own musical evolution as a composer, and before we parted ways he presented me with a stunningly beautiful facsimile of his sketches that his publisher Schott had compiled in honor of his 60th birthday. Before beginning to compose a piece, I learned, he would paint an abstract watercolor that helped to articulate the form of the piece and various events inside it.\n\nOn the last day, after his concert in Indiana, we drove through a small forest, a fertile valley in the vast, flat Indiana heartland, and he reminisced about his own schooling. “At the Academy of Music in Kraków, we had no access to the modern music from the West. It was the early 1950s, and Poland was occupied. We had mostly 19th-century scores, practically all of them German and Russian. And of course we had Symanowski…” He spoke often and fondly of the great Polish composer Symanowski’s music, reminding me of a recent lecture I had witnessed by Gorecki, in which he traced his lineage from Chopin to Symanowski to the present day, stunning me by skipping over composers whom I considered seminal. I had also read an interview with Messiaen in which he offered a history of music that traveled from Bach, Couperin, and Rameau to Berlioz, Fauré, Debussy. And so it goes….\n\nPenderecki continued, “Then one day Luigi Nono came across the Iron Curtain to give masterclasses. And he brought with him dozens of scores from the West, so many new, interesting scores; we didn’t even have Bartók’s and Webern’s music; we were very deprived. You have to understand… we needed these scores, we needed them more than you can imagine. So before he returned to Italy, we made sure to copy them all.”\n\nI nodded empathetically, mentioning that I too had recently spent all night in Kinko’s, copying scores. “Do you know Kinko’s?” I inquired. “It’s kind of a composer’s paradise. Sometimes it’s my second home.”\n\nHe gazed at me unblinking. “I don’t mean copied like…that. I mean we copied them. With a pen, by hand.”\n\nHe registered my disbelief and softened a bit. “You see, there was no other way. He was leaving to go back to the West. We didn’t know whether we would ever see that music again.”\n\nThere was a long silence, but this time it was my silence. I considered that vague word: copying. I suspected that Penderecki had absorbed more from copying – note for note – a Webern bagatelle than I had gleaned from those mountains of xerox copies over the years. For his was a willful act of internalizing, of transference, as opposed to a simple, mindless replication. After all, wasn’t copying a score – really copying it out – so much more valuable than xeroxing it and “studying” it?\n\nGazing out the window at the continually arriving landscape, my long nights at Kinko’s suddenly seemed capricious and self-indulgent. I felt guilty as we whizzed by the islands of trees, distant relatives of those felled in the name of my own enthrallment with the superficial trappings of being a Composer, instead of with the essential transference of ideas – of raw knowledge – from hand to hand and mind to mind, across generations, resisting geographical and political boundaries, a legacy without end. Those dead trees would sit inert on my bookshelf, their lineage dry and denied, with no descendants to blossom anew in some faraway arboretum, large or small.\n\nI’ve been in Rio this month, sitting in on samba and chôros gigs with some great musicians: Gabriel Improta, Andrea Ernest Dias, Zé Paulo Becker, Sheila Zagury, Yamandú Costa, Daniela Spielmann, Tomás Improta, Itibere Zwarg, and many others… My first week it rained steadily, so I hibernated indoors and practiced. Between tunes, my mind drifted to thoughts of my friends up north in Salvador da Bahia – a rhythmic paradise and cultural crossroads of Brazil.\n\n**************************************************************\n\nIn 2003 I traveled to Salvador at the behest of Lucas and Pedro Robatto, who had invited me to teach composition and clarinet during seminários at the Universidade Federal da Bahia. While there I was determined to improve my caxixi playing, so each day after teaching I would trek to Julio Goés’ house to take lessons. It took about an hour to walk there from Pelourinho in the town center. I’d arrive in his front room, a starkly empty chamber save for a couple of chairs and a rug with percussion instruments laid out: caxixi, shekere, double-bells, berimbau, and small drums used in candomblé – a Yoruban ritual ceremony (overlaid with a Catholic veneer) that permeates the Northeast coast of Brazil.\n\nJulio was a superb craftsman, and musicians from all over Brazil – Recife, São Paulo, Belem, Brazilia, Porto Alegre, Rio, Manaus, Belo Horizonte – placed orders on a regular basis. All except one of the instruments in the room had been hand-made by him; the oddball was a tabla drum from India, his preferred toy of the moment. Often, as we concluded a lesson, Julio would grab the tabla and we’d spend half an hour or more jamming. It was a study in innovation to witness a Brazilian traditional musician inventing rhythmic patterns on a watery, lush tabla. “I love the subtlety, the flavors…” he would kvell, coaxing bubbly tones from the drumheads.\n\nJulio was perhaps best known for his sonorous caxixi, which he manufactured in an abundant variety of shapes, sizes, and sounds. Though hardly the most renowned of Brazilian instruments, caxixi occupy a central place in capoeira; during expositions of this dance/martial-art tradition, a berimbau stick is grasped in one hand, and the bow-shaped frame – along with one or more caxixi – is held in the other. In this role they serve an accompanimental function, akin to the West African rattle, from which they are descended.\n\nMore recently, virtuoso percussionists like Airto Moreira and Naná Vasconcelos began experimenting with caxixi as expressive instruments, featuring them in solos, designing and executing complex rhythms and backbeats, and dramatically raising standards of technique. It was this newer tradition – along with the caxixi’s handy portability (they can be played while sitting, standing, or walking) – that inspired me, at age 21, to purchase my first pair at Drummer’s World in New York.\n\nMy first teacher, Nadav Serling, demonstrated a series of exercises – accompanied by textural swishes, shakes, and swirls of sound – that allowed polyrhythms to flow between the two hands; he dissected complex beats into basic rhythmic cells of twos and threes. As I improved, I began to diverge from more traditional grooves. I enjoyed recreating typically American beats, in addition to the samba-inflected ones. I found that caxixi could provide a funky, gritty complement to singing or rapping, and I used them as teaching devices when working with kids, as well as in my band Peace by Piece.\n\nIn Brazil I also learned that playing two caxixi could be a full-body experience, in harmony with the natural rhythm of walking. In Salvador, I took lessons with Giba Conseção, who insisted that playing caxixi was a form of dancing. If one did not move vigorously while playing – he cautioned me – the inflections would be weak, the articulations insufficient, the accents unfocused. Watching Giba play was indeed like watching a dancer, and imitating him was an athletic undertaking. After an hour my arms were raw and sore, my shirt soaked in sweat.\n\nUpon leaving Bahia, I bought six of Julio’s caxixi as parting gifts for my friends in the Robatto family: two large caxixi for Silvio and Lia, two medium-sized ones for Lucas and Pedro, and two for Pedro and Sandra’s kids, Paulo and Lara. The largest ones looked like skinny buckets and couldn’t be played using traditional wrist motion; instead the player had to hold the handles, allowing gravity to pull the weight of the dried beans earthward until they finally crashed on the gourd bottom.\n\nAt my last lesson, Julio brought out a pair of what he called caxixi rodas or ‘wheels’. They appeared glorious, colorful, and rather unwieldy. He grabbed them by the inner ‘spokes’ and swished them around rhythmically. The effect was hypnotizing, but I couldn’t fathom how their donut shape facilitated any technical mastery; their real purpose, it seemed, stemmed from a visual inspiration on his part.\n\n“Has anyone bought a pair of rodas from you, Julio?” I inquired.\n\n“Not yet, but they will,” he replied. “It is such a pleasure to make them,” he added, proudly admiring his creations. “I want a whole family of these, in three or four sizes! Can you imagine?” I wasn’t sure I could, but I enjoyed his fanciful detour; Julio was a dreamer.\n\nFour years later I returned to Bahia, this time for a residency at the Fundação Sacatar in Itaparica. One weekend morning I took the ferry-boat across the bay and decided to stop by Julio’s house to visit. I had originally intended to take the bus, but I became worried that – in trying to negotiate the intricate public transit system of Salvador – I would wind up in some remote favela, so I decided to walk instead. I remembered that Julio lived on one of the narrow stairway/streets snaking up a hill overlooking the Dique de Tororó. From the main road I squinted to identify the recessed entrance, and began scaling the crumbling steps.\n\nAfter several flights I arrived at his house, rapped on the door, and waited. I had taken a rather big gamble, not having the slightest idea whether he would be at home, or even in town. Standing on the threshold, I glanced behind me toward the street. Mangy stray cats prowled the alleys, flies circled, curious children peeked out from behind cracked doors, old women swept the sidewalk, eying me suspiciously as snatches of pagode and samba de roda crackled over transistor radios. I knocked again with greater urgency.\n\nSalvador had changed; it was noisier, more crowded, more polluted, more rushed. Unfinished construction projects dotted the cityscape. During the past few years Brazil had been benefitting from an unprecedented economic boom. It was proudly boasting one of the fastest ’developing’ economies, ascending along with China, India, and – to some extent – Russia. But Julio’s neighborhood had not changed; the Brazilian economic miracle was passing it by.\n\nI knocked again and waited in silence for a while, then I heard a faint stirring inside, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Footsteps reluctantly made their way toward the front of the house; the door creaked open, and a slight, wiry-framed man with long dreadlocks peered out.\n\n“Julio!” I said. “Como vai?”\n\nHe blinked in unrecognition for a few moments, then a slow smile crept across his face and he emerged from the house to embrace me. “Deriki!” he proclaimed. “Faz muito tempo! Tudo bem?”\n\nWe exchanged greetings, and after a couple of minutes he grew visibly excited. “Deriki, venha comigo…eu gostaria te mostrar alguma coisa…” He motioned for me to come into the house. I stepped in and my eyes adjusted to the shadow. Julio had dragged an enormous caxixi across the floor and into the daylight. It was the size of a small child, about three feet in height. Other than that, it looked identical to the regular, handheld kind. I probably appeared stunned, gawking at this bizarre creature the way a guinea-pig-owner might stare at a capybara. It looked like a mutant percussive strain – absurd, yet quietly proclaiming its own territory on the floor nearby, justifying itself via its mere grandiose existence.\n\nJulio was beaming. “Boa, não é?” he said, reddening slightly as he noticed the startled expression on my face. Yes, it was indeed beautiful, but this entity was far too large to imagine actually playing, and I posed the inevitable question – one which I felt sure he had been asked before – “Claro que sim… mas… como tocar?”\n\nHis countenance turned earnest and he replied – somewhat defensively – “Of course it can be played! I just have to lift it a little…” I watched, bemused, as Julio heaved the gargantuan caxixi into the air. It crashed back to the ground a second later with a percussive CRUNCH. Not the most elegant rhythmic device, but at least it made an impressive noise. “You see?” he boasted breathlessly. “A robust sound! And the scale is proportional in every way to the tiny ones.”\n\nI cast a quick glance at the myriad small caxixi stacked on his shelf. The huge specimen was indeed a mirror replica of its miniature relative, but what of its utility? What musician would possibly want a shaker of such size, more akin to a piece of vintage furniture than a musical instrument?\n\n“Dereki, what is beautiful to me is the form,” he said thoughtfully, as if in response to my unarticulated musings. “And this one is just a protótipo. The real one is in the back room. I need you to help me, because I can’t lift it alone.” I grinned, anticipating the next bizarre chapter, and followed him to the inner chamber. There it was, resting in the shadowy corner: the mother of all caxixi. Standing nearly six feet tall, the Amazon entity – fashioned from wicker, and filled with dried beans – sported a flattened gourd bottom, like the others.\n\nJulio wore a broad smile. “Here, let’s bring her outside for some air.” The two of us dragged the giant caxixi onto the landing. Several curious children gathered cautiously near the doorstep, but were promptly shooed away by a watchful woman nearby. Before I could inquire, Julio remarked to me, “Now, I have no doubt that this can be played; I just need to figure out how…” We tried to lift it, first separately, then together, to no avail. I had a clear sense that this caxixi would never shake, except perhaps in an earthquake.\n\nAfter several tries we gave up and Julio began fussing with a tiny crack in the gourd base. Somewhat guardedly, I said, “Julio, I think – perhaps – these should be in an gallery. They’re not really…exactly… musical instruments, you know?”\n\nHe stared at me, uncomprehending. “A gallery?” he echoed, seeming to contemplate the thought. I wasn’t actually sure if he knew what I meant by a gallery; maybe I had used the wrong word.\n\n\"Exposiçao?\" I tried, tentatively.\n\nHe suddenly burst out laughing. “How can you think that? Dereki, Just imagine how this music will sound. It will be tremendous, awesome!” He stood back and savored his work. “I have always wanted to make caxixi this size, but I was…frightened. And for a long time, I didn’t feel sure enough in my technique. But now! Now that I have finally built one, I think that it is perhaps the most perfect thing I have created.”\n\nI marveled at the huge shaker, speechless. At what point, I wondered, had Julio’s work morphed from instrument-making into sculpture? Had the transition occurred at the juncture when form became detached from function? The tricky issue was that Julio himself did not distinguish between these two aspects of his craft. From his perspective, he remained foremost a maker of musical instruments. Defining his creation primarily as an art-object was unthinkable – an utter diminishment that would rob it of its raison d’être.\n\nThen again, perhaps it was a bona fide hybrid. Julio had smashed a functional boundary and was ushering a traditional, utilitarian practice into fresh and unknown territory. I applauded that bravery and felt elated for him, but I also sensed that his blissful undertaking would be an isolated journey that peers would likely ridicule and – at best – deem incomprehensible. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed kids gaping and snickering in the street. I looked back at Julio, cleaning cobwebs off his monster caxixi. On a dusty, boiling day, on a dingy streetcorner near the Dique de Tororó, I felt that I was witnessing the mysterious, lonely rebirth of art.\n\nI received my first paid commission in the Spring of 1990, when I was 22 years old. My friend Jane had invited me up to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend, where she was visiting some acquaintances. Our host was a gregarious, retired businessman named William Barron. We sat down for lunch on Sunday and upon hearing that I was a composer, Mr. Barron confessed a long-held wish.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to commission a talented young composer,” he announced, chewing voraciously. “Like a young Leonard Bernstein, you know?”\n\n“Yup!” I said. Actually I knew almost nothing about Bernstein’s life, but I had played a some of his music – the clarinet sonata, the overture to Candide, the 'Cool' dance from West Side Story (on the piano) – and I’d seen a couple of his Young People’s Concerts broadcast on TV; he seemed like a pretty impressive figure.\n\n“…A spanking new march,” he continued. “It’d be called the Barron March.” He paused momentarily to frame the imaginary title, then resumed munching. “Either for my daughter’s wedding or my funeral,” he chuckled, between mouthfuls. “Whichever comes first. You know?” I nodded profusely, not exactly sure how to respond. “You could do a march, right?” he asked earnestly. “Jane says you’re a very talented guy.”\n\nOf course I could do that, I thought confidently. The medium was utterly familiar to me. In fact I had already composed a piece for my high school band, a short variation on the Hebrew hymn Ani Ma Amin. In any case, I had played dozens of marches over the years and knew the form inside and out: first strain, second strain, trio….\n\n“Sure,” I said. “You mean like a Sousa march?”\n\n“No, heavens no, not a Sousa march!” He waved away the thought in mid-bite. “Something classier. You know, a serious piece. Tell you what, I’ll pay you five hundred bucks – a hundred up front and the rest when you deliver the piece. Whaddaya say?”\n\nFive hundred bucks! I was speechless. My heart pounded with excitement. After twelve years of toiling for the love of the art, I was actually going to be paid to write music! I had finally made it. I had a patron, just like the composers of yore; Bach had Prince Leopold, Tchaikovsky had Madame von Meck, and now I had Mr. Barron! For the first time in my life I felt like the real thing, not an imitation. I was confident that I could write not just a march, but a great march.\n\nDuring the drive home to Boston with Jane, I recounted to Mr. Barron’s generous proposition. She raised an eyebrow, keeping her gaze on the road. “Bill can be whimsical,” she said, smiling enigmatically. Jane looked at me. “Is that something you want to write?” she asked pointedly.\n\nI was puzzled by her oddly cynical reaction. To me, his offer had seemed practical, not capricious. After all, he was a businessman who had always wanted to commission a composer; he merely spotted a good opportunity and took it. “Of course!” I replied enthusiastically. “It’s my first real commission! He even wrote up a contract!” I pulled it out to show Jane; it was a short paragraph outlining the terms of the agreement, detailing the $100 payment and $400 balance, signed with a flourish by William Barron.\n\nShe glanced at it and nodded. “The Barron March; very impressive!” She grinned. “So do you have any tunes in mind yet?”\n\n“Jeez, gimme a couple of days!” I laughed.\n\nThe following day I was back in New York, still on a high and relishing my new life as a professional composer. A month earlier I had returned from Jerusalem, where I had studied orchestration with André Hajdu. It was a grueling experience; every two weeks I would travel to his house for an afternoon-long lesson, and at each meeting he’d send me home with an orchestral score – plus one or two new piano pieces – by a different composer: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Debussy, Grieg, Ives, Ravel, Bartók, Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg, Prokofiev, Copland, Messiaen, Hindemith, Milhaud, Kurtag, Ligeti. I was expected to study the score, then bring back my own manuscript of the piano pieces, orchestrated in the said composer’s style; the following lesson Hajdu would dissect my work, indicating where I had succeeded and where I had erred. It was my first experience delving deeply into the orchestral literature, and I loved it.\n\nNow, bolstered by my commission, I felt the imperative to similarly investigate the band repertoire from a conductor’s vantagepoint, studying specific aspects of instrumentational invention and innovation. It was music I knew ad nuseum from a clarinetist’s perspective, but suddenly those old warhorses seemed fresh and bursting with vitality. I delighted in Holst’s command of form and variation in the Chaconne of the First Suite, the odd harmonies and quirky orchestrational choices in Grainger’s Hill Songs, the raw power and emotional arc of Husa’s Music for Prague. I pored over Mark Hindsley’s ingenious arrangements of orchestral chestnuts like Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloe Suite and Brahms’ Academic Festival Overture. In the process I tackled principles of wind instrumentation, discovering myriad ways in which band writing differed from orchestral: the instruments commonly doubled each other’s melodic lines; the clarinets and flutes effectively replaced the orchestra’s violins; the brass were a more present and malleable force throughout, their role distinct and separate from that of the percussion.\n\nIt felt as though I had entered a time machine that transported me back to elementary school band, our austere and exacting director Steve Tupac ambitiously programming transcriptions of Corelli and Handel. My junior high school band director Pat Chodi’s abominable jokes rang in my ears – “You made a mistake? That’s OK, don’t worry about it; I made a mistake too – once!” I flashed back to the days when my high-school band director – Mick Dayo, an idealistic entrepreneur and hopeless lush – arrived like a whirlwind direct from Florida State (not exactly an upward, or even a lateral, career move…). He launched countless impressive and high-budget projects – for example, convincing the superintendent to dispense a small fortune on fundraisers, tours, and spanking new marching band uniforms – even as our school instruments fell apart.\n\nMr. Dayo’s star burned brightly and quickly; by the end of his second (and final) year, he had become a pale apparition of his former self, depressed and prone to flying into tantrums during rehearsals, after which he would dramatically flee the podium, sequester himself in his office, and drink heavily. These outbursts unfortunately failed to instill the desired spirit of guilt and concentration in the musicians; on the contrary they sparked our more mischievous instincts; armed with a copious reservoir of chutzpah, I would mount the podium, grab the baton, and conduct the remainder of the rehearsal. At last I was standing before the true authority – the full score! No longer was I hopelessly trapped behind a music stand, poking out the 1st clarinet part; it was an enormously liberating, and life-changing, experience.\n\nFinally, in my senior year of high school, arrived the kinder gentler Rob Freeberg, a fine jazz trumpeter who couldn’t have been older than 28. Early on we terrorized and tested him mercilessly, recognizing that he was young and ‘green’, but he swiftly won our respect. Since that time he has greatly elevated the band program – which he still directs to this day – and has become a potent and positive force in Westchester music education.\n\nIt was via this colorful crew of band directors that I first encountered the banal but indestructible marches of Clifton Williams, the sweeping works of Alfred Reed, the Russian Christmas Music of Vaclav Nelhybel, the simple and delightful Folk Song Suite of Ralph Vaughan-Williams. During my sophomore year I performed in the New York All-State Band, and I became familiar with experimental works like David Bedford’s impressionistic Sun Paints Rainbows on the Vast Waves, the quintessentially American Chester by William Schuman, and Aaron Copland’s bold Emblems. Many great orchestral works were likewise revealed to me first through band arrangements. Even today I can close my eyes and hear the swelling of euphoniums in Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, the sonorous saxophones in Bach’s D Minor Toccata. I feel as though I’ve played all the virtuosic violin runs in Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet, when in fact those quicksilver scales – cascading and burbling towards a climax – were realized by a gaggle of clarinetists, dutifully reaping the rewards of years spent endlessly practicing scale passages from Klosé and Baermann étude books. My extensive and visceral knowledge of the great band literature was ready to be mined and tested; an inevitable and potent force had led me towards a noble purpose – engendering the Barron March!\n\nHowever, I still needed to wrestle with the thorny task of composing a piece appropriate for either a wedding or a funeral. I occupied myself for several days with this tricky problem. My eventual solution was to write an unusual march – one capable of expressing both pathos and grandeur, at once rousing and heartfelt. Suppose, I reasoned, that the piece opened with a plaintive, wistful theme in minor key, then morphed into a brighter melody in major mode in its second strain. As long as that duality of mood was maintained, the piece could move through a plethora of variations and the opposing poles would likely reinforce each other, endowing the march with balance, proportion, and a deeper, more nuanced psychological breadth. In this way, I surmised, the Barron March could be uniquely, gloriously, atypical, remaining true to my artistic intentions while honoring my signed agreement.\n\nI worked on the march steadily through the summer, adding finishing touches in August. I sold my beat-up spinet and bought a Yamaha Clavinova, a state-of-the-art, 24-note polyphonic keyboard with weighted keys. This instrument would allow me to utilize a revolutionary new technological tool – MIDI sequencing – to create a real-time piano reduction of the piece. I input pitch, volume, and rhythmic information into the sequencing program Master Tracks Pro, and I used the Clavinova as a playback device; all this meant that I would be able to let Mr. Barron hear the march. I felt certain he’d be grateful for the chance to listen to a recorded version of his commissioned work, and that he’d admire how I’d deftly wedded both melancholy and triumphant sounds into a unified work.\n\nBefore bringing the handwritten manuscript down to the copy shop, I signed the final page, adding the date for posterity. The score was ledger size – 11 by 17 inches – and therefore required a special double-binding: two large black plastic combs, overlapping in the middle, framing the majestic manuscript. I enclosed a cassette tape of my MIDI realization and labeled the box neatly, with proper credentials. With a palpable sense of thrill, relief, and accomplishment, I sealed and posted the oversized, self-addressed, bubble-wrapped envelope to Mr. Barron – registered mail, return receipt requested – along with a cover letter recapping our original agreement (not mentioning the balance due, of course; that would have been ‘gauche’), and detailing my struggle to conceive of and produce a march that embodied such an extended emotional gamut, thanking him for the fascinating assignment and for his faith in my abilities, and looking forward to hearing from him.\n\n******************************************\n\nThroughout that whole, hot summer, I had been working in a music store in Manhattan, selling keyboards on commission. I was learning the ropes from a guy who the staff had nicknamed ‘Slick Rick’. Rick could sell anything to anyone, and he took me under his wing, sharing his tried-and-true techniques of convincing customers to purchase musical equipment they didn’t need. Slick Rick trained me to scrutinize and rapidly identify the various types of customer (‘breeds’, he called them): there were timehogs – the dispossessed, lonely people who came in simply to gab all day and never bought anything; gawkers – gullible customers who could be talked up in price; fatcats – rich folks purchasing expensive equipment in order to stoke their egos or appease their spoiled kids; geekteases – gearheads who used our showroom to try out stuff they would subsequently buy cheaper elsewhere, and so on. Each required a specific regimen of treatment, but the key to success – he impressed upon me – was steering customers towards items with a higher ‘spiff’, or commission paid to the salesman, even if it was an inferior product.\n\n“See this keyboard?” he would rap on a sparkling new Casio VZ-10M synthesizer. “Fantastic machine, truth be told. 16-voice polyphony! Beats the DW-8000 hands down,” he would insist, gesturing dismissively towards the inferior Korg. “But the markup? Forget it, dude!” He would lean towards me, intoning gravely, “Spiff on Casio is D,” as if ‘D’ signified death or devastation. Then he would make an about-face, turning to the hapless Korg with mock reverence, stroking the gaudy and unwieldy digital display, and like a whirlwind he would launch into stunning demos of the DW-8000’s most attractive and flashy features.\n\nRick liked me, but frequently referred to me a ‘lost cause’, rolling his eyes conspicuously as he spied me enumerating to customers the virtues of such spiff-less items as Roland R-8 drum machines, Ensoniq ESQ-1 synths, and Akai S-1000 samplers. I was mortified at the prospect of selling merchandise under misleading premises, and with this warped view I was doomed in the world of quick sales.\n\n“What if they realize it sucks and return it?” I would posit, guiltily.\n\n“They won’t!” he would fire back, exasperated. “Believe me, dude, they learn to like what they buy! All those questions they ask are just stalling tactics, or are based on irrelevant shit some nerdy friend told them. These folks don’t know their heads from their asses, equipment-wise; they NE-VER return stuff! And if they DO bring it back, you know what?” A sly smile would creep across his face and his voice would hush slightly. “It doesn’t matter…the thing is, you still don’t lose the spiff; once that box is out the door, the cut is yours!”\n\n“But what if they get customer feels cheated and gets mad?” I would whisper back anxiously. I mean, it’s kind of like tricking them…”\n\n“Oh my god. Go back to music school, dude!” He would throw his hands into the air despairingly and stomp away. “That’s where you belong!”\n\n******************************************\n\nTwo weeks or so had passed since sending the march, and I still hadn’t heard back from Mr. Barron. It seemed likely that he would be away; I’d probably have to be patient. But with my abysmal sales record at the store I was looking forward to receiving my $400 balance. I called Jane, thinking she might know details about the Barrons’ schedule.\n\n“Hm,” she said, “I’m fairly sure they’re in town. Maybe they haven’t gotten around to listening yet…”\n\n“I think he’s going to dig the march, once he’s checked it out,” I ventured, smugly.\n\n“Well, you've certainly put in a great deal of work,” she said. “I’ll try and prompt them to get in touch,” she promised.\n\nAugust turned into September; cooler winds were prevailing. I had realized that Slick Rick was probably correct about my future, so I’d begun applying to graduate schools. I had also started a new job, teaching music to emotionally disturbed kids. This new employment paid even less than my old job at the music store, and I was therefore more eager than ever to claim my 400 bucks. There was still no word from the Barrons, so I phoned Jane again. We talked for a few minutes, and then somewhat awkwardly I remarked, “I suppose you haven’t heard anything yet about my march…”\n\n“No,” she said apologetically. “I spoke with Amy and…well, come to think of it, she didn’t bring it up. Wait a second…” she broke off, and returned to the phone a half-minute later. “Here’s their number.” She read the digits to me. “Why not contact them yourself?”\n\nThe next day was Saturday. Thinking that the weekend might be a more ideal time to reach the Barrons, I called that afternoon. The phone rang and rang; no answer. I tried later in the day; still nothing. That night, I sat awake in bed, perturbed, wondering why they hadn’t even mentioned the piece to Jane. I knew that the package had been delivered; three days after sending it I had received a return receipt. A terrible thought occurred to me; what if the cassette had been poor quality? Perhaps the tape had unspooled and was unlistenable (it had happened to me once before). That potentiality and many others troubled me. I tossed and turned and fretted over various drastically negative possibilities, and after a several obsessive hours I fell asleep, exhausted.\n\nI tried calling again the next morning, then once again late that afternoon. The phone rang ten or more times; I was about to hang up, but suddenly there was a soft click. “Hello, who is this?” inquired a tiny soprano voice.\n\n“Mrs. Barron?” I inquired eagerly.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Oh, I’m so glad to speak with you. This is Derek Bermel.”\n\nThere was a short, baffled silence. The connection was not very good. “I’m sorry, who?”\n\n“Derek Ber-MEL,” I said a little slower, accenting the last syllable of my surname. I was used to this; most people who read my name pronounced it BUR-mul or BRE-mul.\n\n“I think you must have dialed the wrong number,” she replied edgily. How did you get this number?”\n\n“Oh, Jane gave it to me. I’m Jane’s friend, the one you met last summer, the…musician.” I paused and thought that I could detect the faint sound of Cape Cod crickets chirping. “The composer,” I continued. “I wrote a march…”\n\n“Oh yes,” she said, with distant recognition. “Nice to hear from you.”\n\nAnother crackling silence ensued, which I gladly filled. “Yes, I, uh, I sent a score – I mean…the sheet music…with a tape. Did you receive it, by any chance? I mean, I think you received it; I mailed it to your husband…”\n\n“Yes,” she said quietly. “Thank you, he did get it. But he’s not available right now. He’s a bit busy…”\n\nAnother awkward silence. I began to feel queasy. A thought occurred to me; perhaps he was ill. That would explain things. But wouldn’t Jane have told me? Maybe they didn’t want anyone to know.\n\n“I’m sure he is,” I said. “Um...can I call back some time?”\n\n“Yes…or, well…” she stammered, haltingly. Barely able to hear her voice, I jammed the phone up against my ear. A slightly longer, more agonizing silence ensued. The static was deafening. I suddenly thought of another possibility; suppose their marriage was problematic, and they were estranged. What if he was having an affair, and she received my package and threw it away in disgust? But Mrs. Barron broke in, dispelling that fleeting notion. “Hold the line a second. He’s inside; let me see if I can find him.”\n\nAn interminable silence followed, seemingly lasting for weeks. Something seemed very wrong. I began to regret sending the Barrons a MIDI version of the piece. Perhaps the recording was too stiff-sounding, or the cassette quality had been rotten. In my mind, I heard Slick Rick's voice, admonishing me, “MIDI sucks! Use your chops to demonstrate; it’s way more impressive and distracting for the customers.” Naturally, I was confident that Mr. Barron possessed a more sophisticated and discriminating musical aptitude than my keyboard customers, yet even so, perhaps I ought to have played him the piece live, at the piano; it might have appeared more personal. As I cycled through the potential pitfalls of MIDI realizations, a gruff voice emerged from the crackles. “Hello? Hello? Derek?”\n\n“Oh, hello Mr. Barron!” I said in the most cheerful tone I could muster.\n\n“Derek! Now listen, what the dickens is this monstrous thing you sent me? This is awful, God-awful stuff! It’s – I don’t know the technical term – dissonant?...ugly-sounding? How could you possibly think this might be played at a wedding? Or even a funeral, for that matter? It’s…cacophonous! And it doesn’t sound anything like a march.” He laughed out loud, presumably at the thought of the unintentionally cacophonous wedding/funeral event. “What I wanted was something grand-sounding. We talked about that, don’t you remember? Anyway, what am I supposed to do with this chintzy piano recording?” He snickered a bit more while the line crackled.\n\nDuring this soliloquy I experienced such a wild rush of emotions – shame, indignation, incredulity, despair – that I could hardly summon any breath to respond. My voice shook with an audible tremor as I attempted to solidify my thoughts. “Mr. Barron-” I began, half-choking back a sob of wounded pride, “I worked very hard, I mean, I wrote this… you wanted… it was difficult to write something that could be… you asked for either a funeral or a wedding piece…”\n\n“ME-LO-DY,” he interrupted, emphasizing each syllable. “I wanted a march with a melody that a person can identify and sing.” He continued, a bit patronizingly, but with more empathy, “Don’t get me wrong, you’re obviously very talented, but for God’s sake, couldn't you take out some of those ear-splitting sounds and add some real honest-to-God tunes? Your piece doesn’t contain a shred of melody. Didn’t they teach you how to write one at Yale?”\n\nI searched frantically for an appropriate answer. What was he talking about? Had I sent the wrong cassette tape? My march had a very clear melody, several in fact. It was the most tuneful composition I had written since high school. But in this piece I had attempted – and, I felt, accomplished – something much more sophisticated and subtle; through a slow process of variation, two main themes seamlessly converged – one in minor key, one in major – how could I explain this to him? “Mr. Barron… I mean…there are melodies are in there… Maybe they’re not quite as perceptible as–”\n\n“Well I can’t hear them,” he snapped. “Look, Derek, I wanted a real rousing march. Do you know Battle Hymn of the Republic? Like that one! Now that’s a real march, with a fantastic melody.”\n\n“But – Battle Hymn – that’s…” I broke off, completely flummoxed, took a deep breath, and began again. “I asked you if you wanted a Sousa march, and you insisted that you didn’t like – that you wanted something more interesting…a young Leonard Bernstein…”\n\n“Interesting, yes! Like a good melody,” he added curtly. “Look, I’m not a music scholar or anything, but to me a strong, clear melody is at the foundation of music. Haven’t you heard West Side Story?”\n\n“Sure,” I began. “But Bernstein also wrote–”\n\n“Now, Derek,” he interrupted with annoyance, “I don’t have time to debate this all day. Here’s what we’ll do. You rewrite this for organ – take out some of those intolerable harmonies, and please add at least a couple of tunes that a regular person can recognize – and we’ll call it a deal. I really would have preferred a recording of a real band, but at this point I suppose organ would do.”\n\n“…organ?” I echoed, weakly, at a loss for words.\n\n“Right, a pipe organ!” he said, heartened. \"You know, Derek, I’m actually glad you called to work things out. When I first heard your…thing... I must admit, I was a bit miffed. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry! Not that I don’t appreciate your – uh – experimentation, but I don’t like being taken for a guinea pig. In any case, I think we’re clear on things now, right?”\n\n“Yeah…uh…ok…Mr. Barron…if you don’t mind, let me just think about all this. I’ll…I’ll call you back soon.”\n\n“Don’t think too long! Just get writing, like Lenny would’ve done! C’mon!” He laughed heartily. “I’m sure it’ll be great! Looking forward to it, Derek…bye!”\n\n“Do you think the…” I began, but before I could finish the thought I heard a sharp click. I stood with the phone to my ear for another couple of seconds until the line went dead.\n\nBattle Hymn of the Republic? I couldn’t fathom this in the least. What the hell? I had misunderstood the whole assignment, right from the start, and now the puzzle pieces were falling into place. All Barron had wanted was a pompous melody or two, backed up by a few banal chords, capped off with a cheesy flourish at the end. Meanwhile there I was, attempting to weave an intricate tapestry, agonizing over details. Now I was back at square one, with a new assignment to write an organ march, of all depressing things. But now the challenge and the ebullience I had felt before were absent; there was only a seething sizzle in my gut. My first ‘commission’. That had sure turned out great.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I’d been so intimidated and surprised that I’d forgotten to ask for my four hundred dollars. During our conversation, money had been the farthest thing from my mind, but now my upcoming rent loomed like a vampiric presence. I felt simultaneously humiliated and ripped off. Why hadn’t I stood up for myself? What was I afraid of? I plunked down on my bed, dejected. Maybe I wasn’t really cut out for this composer thing. Maybe a freelance composer had to be a self-employed businessman with a killer, commercial instinct. A real composer might have anticipated what Mr. Barron would want, might have known how to ask the right questions initially, might have gauged his intentions more accurately.\n\nThe phone rang. I stared at it, ringing insistently. It was probably Mr. Barron calling back, I thought. Perhaps he realized that he had been overly harsh, even boorish, ignorant. Maybe this time he would offer payment – even a little extra cash as an incentive – to write the organ piece. Then, after some thought, I might agree to the new terms, explaining that it would require a great deal of effort but that I was willing to do my part to ensure his satisfaction. I summoned some courage and picked up the phone. “Hello?” I said, in a measured tone.\n\n“D-rock!!” a familiar voice cried. It was my college roommate George.\n\n“Hey G,” I said, ever-so-slightly disappointed, but relieved.\n\n“What’s shakin’, Beethoven? How’s the great composer?”\n\n“Uh, not so great, in either sense of the word. You?”\n\n“Aw man, I have had a crazy day. Three clients with crises; I’m trying to manage everything at once. As Stevie would say, ‘Living Just Enough for the City.’ You know, Rock?” He heaved an audible, satisfied sigh. George was an entrepreneur, who – shortly after graduation – plunged into the record business and founded his own management company. A natural businessman with a keen musical ear and a flair for cutting a deal, he worked with both bands and producers, and at age 23 was already knee-deep in the mix of the New York indy music scene. “What’s going on with you, homes?”\n\n“Well, I finished off a march. You remember that guy I told you about who commissioned it?”\n\n“Yeah, Barron! The Barron March,” he intoned with mock grandeur. “I thought you finished that one a while ago. What else you been doing?”\n\n“Well, yeah, I finished it, but…the thing is, I hadn’t heard back from him-”\n\n“Why not? Did you deliver the goods?”\n\n“Yeah, well, I guess I did, but they were the wrong goods. I wrote what I thought was a really good march; I mean, it WAS a really good march. But it was nuanced, you know? Not typical; it was layered. It was supposed to be either for his daughter’s wedding or-”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, or his funeral, I remember. What a wacky assignment! I’m sure whatever you came up with was great. So, you sent it, and…?”\n\n“Right away. I sent it registered mail, weeks ago.”\n\n“And you never heard back from him?”\n\n“No, so I finally called him. And he got the package.” I paused. “But he hated it,” I admitted, feeling oddly embarrassed. “Or maybe he doesn’t exactly hate it…but he doesn’t understand it. I dunno. He wants me to do something else.”\n\n“Did you get paid?” he asked in a flat tone unfamiliar to me.\n\nI shuddered. “Well, I got paid the first hundred bucks. Before I wrote it. But I didn’t really ask about money this time, because he was… because it was so… awkward. You know?” I realized that I was blushing slightly and my head felt hot. “I guess I’m stupid, but I never figured he wouldn’t LIKE the piece. I mean, on some level I don’t really care; he obviously doesn’t know the first thing about music. He said he wanted a march like Battle Hymn of the Republic –”\n\n“D-rock, you can’t go out like that. Do you have a contract?”\n\n“Yeah, but he –”\n\n“What’s the balance? What does he owe you?”\n\n“Uh, let’s see…about four hundred bucks.”\n\n“About, or exactly?” I could hear George scribbling something on a pad. “Look homes, he can request anything he wants, but first you gotta get paid.”\n\n“Well, it’s true…you’re right. I should get paid. But…shit! It feels weird to ask him for the rest when he hates the piece.”\n\n“Come on, this guy is a multi-millionaire who lived down the block from Teddy Kennedy, and you’re a starving artist!”\n\n“Well… I dunno… maybe I should just write him a new march – this new organ piece he wants or whatever – and then he’ll feel happier about the whole thing.”\n\n“D-rock, it’s not about happiness; we’re gonna get you paid. What’s this guy’s address? I’m drafting a letter right now…”\n\n“G-- I mean… he’s a friend of a friend…”\n\nIn the earpiece I could hear another phone ringing incessantly at George’s office. “I gotta pick this up, D. Wait a sec.” He slammed down the phone.\n\n“Hello?” I heard him ask into the other phone. “Nope, I can’t guarantee that. Sorry, can you hold on? Thanks.”\n\nHe picked up my phone again. “Find that contract from Barron and fax it to me today, all right?”\n\n“It’s just a letter, like it just outlines–”\n\n“Is it signed? By both parties?”\n\n“Yeah, but-”\n\n“Fax it to me today. Dude, I gotta take this call. See you later. Don’t forget!”\n\n“OK.” I hung up the phone and took a deep breath. Right, the contract. I dug into my filing cabinet and pulled it out. There it was: the signed paper, written in Mr. Barron’s eloquent hand, acknowledging receipt of $100 and requesting delivery – before the end of the summer – of a ‘march for band, entitled the Barron March, suitable for performance at either a wedding or a funeral’. I shoved it in my backpack, shut the front door, and began unlocking my bike from the ‘no parking’ sign on the street outside my apartment.\n\nSo here was the end of my triumphant story, I thought; my manager buddy ekes my paltry commission money out of a rich guy who hates my music. Is this what it’s all about, I wondered? How pathetic that this incident would mark the onset of my career as a freelance composer! The thought of Jane momentarily flashed through my head, and I considered how embarrassing the whole scenario might turn become. I stopped fiddling with the bike lock, feeling conflicted and uncomfortable. I should just let this go, I realized. Let it all go. No amount of money was worth alienating my friend. I turned around and headed back to the stoop and climbed the steps up to my apartment, picked up the phone again, and called George.\n\n“Management!” his voice boomed.\n\n“Hey G-\"\n\n“’Sup D-rock?”\n\n“Look, I really, really appreciate all your help. But… I mean the guy hates my music. And he’s a friend of a friend. I just – I don’t want to take his money. Really, it’s OK.” I paused. “I didn’t write it for the money anyway. Seriously, G.”\n\nGeorge sighed. There was a short silence. “Why did you write it, then?” he asked gently.\n\nI thought for a few seconds. “I don’t know. Because – it was exciting to get the commission; I liked the idea that someone would pay me to do what I love to do anyway. It made me feel – important, I guess. But once I started writing that march, it became more than a random, goofy assignment; it was a challenge. And boy was I glad that he DIDN'T request a Sousa march!” The situation seemed suddenly funny, and I chuckled. “You know, maybe Barron is right; maybe my piece is bizarre-sounding. I mean, to a traditional ear. But it’s beautiful - to my weird ears anyway. You know, it really doesn’t sound like any other march I've heard.” I felt a twinge of pride, but realized I was babbling a bit, and stopped talking. I could detect the sound of the printer whirring in George’s office.\n\n“OK, D, I get it,” George said quietly. But fax me that contract anyway, all right? Just so I have a copy on file here.”\n\n“Sure, man. Hey, thanks again, G, for listening, and everything. I hope you understand. You’re a good friend.”\n\n“No prob. Speak to you soon, D-rock.”\n\nI felt immediately relieved, as if a great weight had been lifted from my mind. I shook my head. Then I climbed onto my bike, headed over to the copy shop, faxed the letter to George, and stopped on the way back for a slice of pizza.\n\n******************************************\n\nTwo weeks later, autumn was in full swing; the air was crisp and dry and leaves were beginning to fall from the trees. I returned home from work to find an embossed envelope in the mailbox; there was no return address. I ripped it open without paying much attention, assuming it was junk mail. Inside was a check for $400, signed by Amy Barron. I looked inside the torn envelope again. No letter was enclosed, but at the bottom of the check was scrawled, ‘balance of payment for march.’\n\nGeorge.\n\nI fingered the weighty envelope; it was the same richly textured, tactile paper on which the contract had been written. Glancing down at my hand, I realized that I was holding very expensive stationery. I stared at the check absent-mindedly for a few seconds, put it hastily in my pocket, hopped on my bike, and began riding towards the bank.\n\nI sit at my desk with a pencil poised on the manuscript paper, trying to sort and sift ideas. I close my eyes, attempting in vain to keep my brain focused on the music, but I feel overwhelmed by the events unfolding around me. Back in February 2003, I marched through the streets of New York City, one of a million people who demonstrated to express outrage at our militaristic U.S. foreign policy. The entire East Side of Manhattan shut down; buses, taxis, and police vehicles were rendered helplessly immobile in a sea of people waving signs and chanting for judicious restraint. Now, three and a half years after the Defense Secretary predicted a quick victory that would take “a matter of weeks, not months”, American soldiers are caught in a bloody civil war with violence on the rise. 3,500 Iraqis died just this month, more than the total number of Americans who died on Sept. 11, 2001. Our own military casualties will soon surpass that number as well. Each day, mothers and fathers – Iraqi, Afghani, and American – lose their children, and an endless war is raging, on my behalf – on our behalves as U.S. citizens.\n\nIn the wake of John F. Kennedy’s murder, Leonard Bernstein wrote \"This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before…Sorrow and rage will not inflame us to seek retribution; rather they will inflame our art. Our music will never again be quite the same.” This statement, an artist’s sincere and earnest attempt to find a response to national crisis, has been used to promote the notion that creating music is powerful enough to overcome violence. For artists, the notion that creative acts are a valid and equal response to destructive ones, is an attractive idea. At times it has helped me to feel heroic simply by going about my daily business of writing, playing, and generally making music.\n\nAnd yet the violent acts continue. How can I continue to scribble sixteenth notes under those circumstances? Is it possible to respond to such violence simply by making music? How deeply is this war dehumanizing us all, little by little, hour by hour?\n\nA friend recently bolstered Bernstein’s pronouncement by pointing out that if we all played violins continually, we wouldn’t be able to kill or inflict pain (unless, I suppose if we all played violin as badly as I do…). This is true, but as the fighting goes on, that hypothesis seems more and more irrelevant. I write and play music passionately; others wage war passionately. I pick up a clarinet; someone else picks up a gun. The two acts are essentially unrelated, yet unfortunately, in the end, the guns are more plentiful. It’s not only easier to learn how to shoot than to compose, it’s also cheaper (join the army!) and it’s the path to greater glory. Making music may have been heroic to Lenny, but to most Americans the soldiers are the heroes.\n\nOf course, the very story of Bernstein’s life is a rejection of passivity. It is only the frequent citation of this statement in times of war that irks me. For it reveals a troubling implication about the American psyche: that we profess to conquer violence while refusing to acknowledge its deeper roots in cultural conflict, poverty, imperialism, and turf battles over control of natural resources. John F. Kennedy’s assassination was no accident; nor was 9/11. Both events were part of an opposition's calculated political agenda, and both events were responses – however unjust and cruel – to U.S. policy.\n\nIf therefore, as individuals, we abhor violence, we cannot bury our heads in the sand. Protesting it cannot be left to our elected representatives. The government will always indicate that our sole role is to 'keep living our lives', continuing to be productive taxpayers, ‘stimulating the economy’; in short, during a time of war we should do what we always did, only with more conviction and sense of purpose. Those who make music play more devotedly, farmers farm with greater fervor, bankers bank even more intensely. And of course, shoppers shop with renewed vigor and determination.\n\nRemember how, in the wake of 9/11, George W. Bush commanded us to go shopping? That would be our victory over the terrorists. “Shop!” we were fitfully instructed, as if carrying out that sacred command would prove that we hadn’t given in, that our lives hadn’t been disrupted by terrorist tactics. Dubya suggested that we answer violence thus: “Do your business around the country. Fly and enjoy America's great destination spots. Get down to Disney World in Florida. Take your families and enjoy life, the way we want it to be enjoyed.” In the meantime, the federal government would respond to the violence for us, with a brutal 'shock and awe' preemptive war. Bush’s spokesperson Ari Fleisher had an additional, slightly more sinister, piece of advice for us citizens: “Watch what you say.” Accept the collective response of war. And accept the costs, the priorities. Our government spends more more each day for the war in Iraq than we spend each year funding the arts.\n\nWhat’s the difference whether we shop or make music? Either choice constitutes a pyrrhic victory if it is accompanied by political passivity. I worry that Harold Pinter uttered a great truth in describing America as “a salesman…out on its own, and its most saleable commodity is self love.” How can we be so smug as to believe that the proper response to cataclysmic events is to continue with ‘business as usual’? In a democracy, how can we be so unmotivated to excoriate the policies of our own government and the conduct of our elected representatives? Has our lexicon become so distorted by Karl Rove’s doublespeak that we actually believe that doing nothing is equivalent to taking bold action?\n\nThe question becomes not merely whether – but when and how – we should stand up and say ‘enough!' War is a confusing situation, because withdrawal seems as fraught as “staying the course.” As predicted by many analysts from the start, a civil war has now broken out in Iraq, and the situation is now far beyond our control. What remains is a hopelessly anarchic unrest, its graveness ignored by the warmongers of this administration, whose corporate and political interests benefited from the onset of hostilities. In all the hand-wringing over what to do next, it is easy to forget that the pretexts of self-defense under which we attacked Iraq have long since faded into the sunset. The only remaining excuse for continuing to occupy Iraq is to retroactively justify our misguided invasion.\n\nI often muse over the complex and intertwined relationship between art and politics. I once brought a newly finished piano work to my very 'political' teacher Louis Andriessen. He looked at the dedication and grinned wryly.\n\n\"What's this?\" He pointed to my inscription, which read, 'For Yitzhak Rabin.' It was the week after Rabin had been shot, and I felt pained by his death.\n\n\"I wanted to do something,\" I said solemnly, \"to express something....about his death...\"\n\n\"Did you know him?\" he queried, amusedly.\n\n\"No...\" I replied.\n\n\"Then you shouldn't use his name,\" he snapped. \"This is silly.\"\n\nAt first I thought he was just being deliberate and contrarian, but now I think he was probably right (and he is Dutch, after all...). Our politics doesn't always belong in our art, at least not in that way. It's tricky.\n\nOne book that had a profound effect on me was Antonio Tabucchi’s novel ‘Sostiene Pereira’ (there’s also a movie version, with Mastroiani). The story begins as fascism creeps slowly into Portuguese pre-war politics. The protagonist Pereira is a middle-aged newspaper editor who begins to encounter violence more and more in the headlines; he finds his conscience torn, and one day he decides that he can no longer calmly go about his daily routine; he is drawn inextricably toward the only possible effective response – activism. Around the same time, in 1936, Llorca, the great Spanish poet and playwright, lost his life fighting with the Communists; his body was dumped in a ditch. Should he have balked at fighting for a cause in which he believed, and instead continued to write more and more beautiful poetry? Did he accomplish more through his ‘heroic’ death than he would have through his writing? It’s hard to know.\n\nFor who is to say that composing – or making music of any kind, for that matter – isn’t itself an act of violence? Why romanticize and tranquilize creativity? Composing, it seems to me, is largely about upheaval, about disturbing the status quo. The transfer of sensation, information, and emotion from one person to another may feel profound, even spiritual, but it is certainly not peaceful.\n\nArtaud, in fact, was convinced that our most violent urges could be quenched and quelled by means of art. His “Théâtre de la cruauté” supposed live theatre to be the medium by which we might exorcise our antisocial instincts, returning home thereafter to properly behaved homes. In his world, art would not attempt to erase violence, but would instead serve as the catharsis by which violence could be experienced in a transformed – and physically harmless – form.\n\nBeing an artist demands a temperment that is sensitive to the joys and cruelties of the outside world. Ironically, artists sometimes seem desensitized to what goes on around them, but I believe that this remoteness – sometimes even manifesting itself in outwardly hostile behavior – can be a self-defense mechanism employed by extraordinarily vulnerable souls who decry injustice and tyranny.\n\nIn 1988, shortly before his death, Bernstein offers an eloquent – and now eerily prescient – rant against tyranny. In a New York Times essay he enumerates the dangers of fascism lurking within our own political system, especially during election years. “To call for war at the drop of a pipeline (while secretly dealing for hostages); to teach jingoistic slogans about armaments and Star Wars; to prescribe the weapons industry for the health of our doped-up credit card economy; to spend a dizzying percentage of the budget on arms at the expense of schools, hospitals, cultural pursuits, caring for the infirm and homeless – these are all forms of tyranny.”\n\nThe tyrant to whom he referred of was none other than George Bush the First.\n\nOne could argue that the ‘tyrant’ neocons have in fact taken a rather artistic approach to foreign policy, though it is played out in the theatre of war rather than the theatre of cruelty. They imagined a world as they’d like to see it, and they have been trying to fit the real world – our world – into that fantasy, inconsistencies notwithstanding. Or as the Downing Street Memo illuminated it: “the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy”. Artists must likewise believe in the world that they manufacture out of thin air. When our faith wanes in the fabricated worlds of our making, the ‘vision’ is lost. So Dick Cheney, too, is a dreamer, albeit a tyrannical and authoritarian one.\n\nAt the end of his essay, Bernstein strikes a hopeful note. He writes: “I love my country – so much, in fact, that I am putting all my energies into seeing it to a better day, a more tranquil night, a shining and limitless future. And I abide by the words of that splendid liberal Thomas Jefferson that are inscribed on his monument in Washington: ‘I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.’”\n\nTime to write some music.\n\nDuring the summer of 1992, I spent four months in Northwestern Ghana studying the Lobi xylophone with Ngmen Baaru and Richard Na-Ile. The small village of Lawra was located in the northern corner of the Upper West Region, a two-day bus ride from the capital city Accra. In that part of the country the borders were porous; folks crossed to and from the ‘French Side’ (Burkina Faso), which was only a few miles away. I had a fellowship which allowed me to pursue an ‘independent study’ over the summer; the cash was just enough to get me to West Africa and back.\n\nHaving fallen in love with the sound of Malian music, especially the kora – a West African harp – I had originally intended to travel to Bamako. Unfortunately, Mali was in the throes of a civil war, so I decided that Ghana was a wiser choice. I called the magnificent percussionist Valerie Naranjo, who gave me Na-Ile’s address at the Lawra Ministry of Culture. Ministry of Culture? An African village may have dirt roads, mud huts, and no electricity or running water, but you can bet that it will have a healthy bureaucracy, thanks to its rich colonial history.\n\nThe Daghati people are split between three countries: Ghana, Burkina-Faso and Côte-d'Ivoire. Their main instrument, the ‘gyil’, is an ancestor of the Western marimba, and is ubiquitous in the society; it is played inside and outside, at festivals, funerals, ceremonies, and church services. Several times during my stay Baaru traveled on foot to a nearby river; there he gathered materials, which he later hand-crafted into xylophones with his nephews Kuulinsu and Maanibe.\n\nThe gyil has fourteen- (or eighteen-) keys and is constructed from tuned slabs of carefully carved mahogany wood, bound with animal hide to a sturdy wooden frame. Each gyil key has its own gourd resonator; crushed and flattened spider-webs are seared with rubber over holes carved in the gourd, creating a buzzing membrane as the keys are struck. The process of making a xylophone takes several months, because the wood needs to be “cooked” and dried. Matching gourds must be found for each key; they could be up to a foot in length.\n\nIn performance practice, two xylophonists play along with a drummer, and it is not uncommon for a gyil player to sing and play the same song for over an hour; phrases might be repeated twenty or thirty or a hundred times. The harmony is pentatonic, without octave equivalence, and with several of the notes falling \"in-between\" pitches of the Western chromatic scale. Throughout the piece a “dance beat” often surfaces in the high register of the xylophone, revealing a strong tie to the bell pattern and to the movements of the dancers. The link between dance and music is absolute; the two genres are inextricable, musicians cueing dancers and dancers signaling to musicians, back and forth.\n\nThe virtuosity of the players (and the dancers) is staggering, and their sheer stamina is extraordinary. In one of the most distinctive and challenging rhythmic techniques I learned from Kuulinsu and Maanibe, one gyil player mirrors the other's melodic improvisations one sixteenth pulse behind. Try it at home some time!\n\nIt took quite a while to get accustomed to their way of learning. I would bring my cassette recorder to lessons, then retreat for several hours to a hut to practice passages slowly on the xylophone, continually checking to the tapes. The gyil players in Lawra – most of whom were farmers during the day – found my “loner” approach amusing; they would stop by to watch as I practiced in solitude, fascinated to observe me learning in this bizarre way.\n\nFor them, learning was a communal activity and therefore took place in a social environment. In contrast with our TV-saturated generation, aspiring xylophone players in Lawra, Tumu, and other towns where I stayed – some as young as four – would quietly sit watching older musicians for hours. Only after the adults were finished playing would the kids reverently approach the gyil, tentatively grasping the thick, rubber-wound sticks. Instead of practicing specific licks slowly, determinedly, and in solitude – as I did – these young players stripped a melody down to its core, recreating simple, skeletal versions of the tunes, usually in strict tempo.\n\nLearning the gyil was alternately inspiring and frustrating; misunderstandings abounded, as in any cross-cultural scenario. When I first heard the funeral song “Kukur Gandaa Bie, Kuora Gandaa Bie” I felt sure it was in 4/4 time, with occasional half-note triplets thrown in here and there. But one day, while practicing the tune on the xylophone, I noticed – out of the corner of my eye – one of Baaru’s wives dancing to the music; she was dancing in 3/4! This fleeting experience forced me to reconsider the building blocks of the music and to adjust my rhythmic orientation; what I had perceived as a broad triplet rhythm was actually the basic pulse.\n\nMost of my initial mistakes stemmed from hearing the music as dependent on bass motion, when in fact the structure was rooted in the bell pattern. I was often seduced by hearing shifts in harmonic rhythm, a Western sensibility of hearing from the bottom up that was very difficult to shake. Because our ‘functional’ hearing is so grounded in tonality, it is hard to fully grasp music that is grounded on bell patterns. Those who like Salsa music might argue that Latin music is also based on cascára, but its Afro-European hybrid nature allows Westerners to hear its tonal grounding as primal. In a funny way, most of us probably hear Latin music 'wrong'.\n\nWest African music is most certainly bell-oriented, and on the xylophone those bell patterns manifest themselves as short melodies played and embellished in the upper register. If I had been more attuned to the bell pattern, I would have had an easier time intuiting the correct architecture of the music. For example, when I first began to learn “Luba Pog Nung Wa Da Bin Kobo” (“The Lobi Woman Bought Feces for One Penny [at the market, thinking it was food]”), I had no doubt that the melody began in the middle of the bar. Weeks later I realized suddenly that it started at the beginning of the bar. Once again, my sensibility became flipped on its head.\n\nOne day I sat down to play a string of songs in ‘Bewa’ style (including one of my favorites, ‘The White Man Cannot Eat the Green Leaf Soup’, the awful truth of which was revealed to me after several nights with a roiling stomach). After I finished playing, Na-Ile said to me: “You have done well. But, if you play more low notes, the people will enjoy the music more, and they will dance.”\n\nI was confused; Na-Ile’s statement seemed to contradict what I knew about building energy in gyil music; from what I understood, higher pitches - outlining the bell pattern – were used to ramp up the intensity of the musicians and dancers. Perhaps I was wrong. “Can you show me?” I asked.\n\nRichard sat down at the xylo to demonstrate, and played for about ten minutes (a short excerpt often lasted at least that long, which is why I requested demonstrations only when I had a burning question). I listened closely, but aside from the fact that he sounded much more fluid, Richard was playing much like I had. In fact, it seemed as if he was hitting more high notes – not low ones – than I had. I still felt puzzled as he handed the sticks back to me.\n\n“More low notes, you say?” I confirmed uneasily, taking my seat on the tiny stool.\n\n“Correct,” he said.\n\nI began to play, adding abundant low notes. As I understood the Lobi aesthetic, low notes were generally employed to demonstrate virtuosity (rather like flourishes in the upper register in virtuosic passages by Chopin or Ysayë). “I can say that a master xylophone player shows his strong left hand,” the local truckdriver and consummate gyil player Borre had once remarked, commenting on Baaru’s mellifluous playing style, “He demonstrates his skill on the xylophone by the fine elaborations he makes with his left.”\n\nSo I laid off the top keys a bit and concentrated on adding more variations in the left hand, ornamenting bass patterns on the bottom several keys. Na-Ile listened politely, waiting until I had finished. He did not look convinced. “Let me show you again,” he said calmly, moving toward the xylophone. You are playing some nice melodies, but the people will not dance….”\n\n“Then maybe instead of those bass notes, I should play the dance beat up on the high keys instead…?”\n\n“Yes, play the dance beat, but play it low. Always low.”\n\nI was flummoxed. “Low? I don’t understand. You taught me to play the dance beat with my right hand.”\n\n“Yes, of course, you should play with the right, but always low!” he exclaimed.\n\n“You mean you want me to cross my hands?” I asked confusedly. I had never seen anyone play like this, though I supposed it was possible.\n\n“No, let me demonstrate,” and he played for another ten or fifteen minutes, the last few minutes looking at me intently while strongly accenting the dance notes in his right hand.\n\nI fidgeted until he finished, feeling immensely impatient. “But you’re playing the high notes, with your right hand! I don’t understand. You’re not playing low notes.”\n\n“But Mr. Derek, of course I am showing you the low notes! I can even say that I play them with more presence!”\n\n“No, you were playing them high, up here…” and I pointed to the upper notes of the xylophone.”\n\nHe glanced where I was pointing, then back at me, smiling. “You say ‘high’, but you are pointing to the low notes!” he insisted, smiling, a hint of annoyance creeping into his voice.\n\n“Low? You call these…these notes…low? But these are the highest notes on the xylophone…” I was dumbfounded.\n\n“Of course we call them low! How else can we call them?”\n\nThen what do you call these notes?” I pointed towards the bottom few notes of the xylophone.\n\n“Look at the xylophone!” He stared at me in exasperation, and a moment of complete incomprehension passed between us. “Those notes are not low. They are high. And deep,” he added.\n\n“High…and deep?” I muttered, eyeing the gyil's wooden frame. The hugest keys, all the way on the left side, needed bigger gourd resonators, so the large gourds were congregated near the ‘deeper’ notes. The keys and frame of the xylophone therefore curved upward to accommodate the gourds, making the 'deepest' notes farther from the ground, or…higher.\n\nI laughed. Of course. Our use of the word “high” is a description from physics, meaning (more exactly) “a higher frequency of sound wave cycles per second.” This association had trumped all my other possible descriptions of how a pitch might manifest itself as “low” or “high.” Na-Ile’s was a clear representation of height, in inches off the ground.\n\nIt all depends what your definition of “is” is. Perhaps if I played cello or bass, the high/low mix-up would have been clear from the start. Several cellist friends of mine have remarked that adult students generally encounter great difficulty with the downward direction of the hand’s motion as the pitch moves higher on the string, and vice-versa. Young children, less sensitized to the “high-low” verbal cue, make the leap with little problem.\n\nWhen we consider how divergent vocabularies can be, it is no wonder that great discord exists in the world. So much basic comprehension is subjective and so many so-called ‘universals’ are culturally determined. It can be eerie to contemplate how terminology programs and transforms the fundamental facets of perception. In that sense we are prisoners of our cultural context and vocabulary.\n\nYet viewed through a different prism we are also transmitters of a unique cultural perspective, avatars of our own language in a particular place and time. That uniqueness is something to treasure and nurture. And in those rare moments of epiphany, when a wide chasm has been bridged, I have felt an overwhelming joy as a mysterious and evasive truth was suddenly, dramatically, revealed.\n\nAfter school I floated around for a while. Busked on the streets in Paris until my clarinet got stolen at a phone booth, then herded baby goats on a farm in Languedoc-Rousillon. Afterwards I headed to Israel to do ethno- research on Yemenite women’s vocal music and to study orchestration. One day I received the news that a close friend from college had died, and I decided to return to the States for his funeral. So at 22 years old, I found myself back in New York, lacking gainful employment.\n\nAfter a few weeks of intensive searching, I landed a position teaching music to emotionally disturbed youths at a residential treatment center. One of the largest of its kind in the country, the center housed about 1000 boys. My duties were teaching the after-school music program and conducting the choir.\n\nI was grateful to receive a steady paycheck, but the job was exhausting. These were not your average kids; they had graduated from the school of hard knocks. Many were already experienced thieves and drug sellers. The week I arrived, one of my students – home on a weekend visit – was arrested after midnight in Queens; he had been discovered in a stretch limo along with two prostitutes, carrying several thousand dollars in cash. He was 12 years old and sang 2nd soprano in my choir.\n\nAt this place you could never predict which and how many kids were going to show up on a given afternoon, nor in what mood they would arrive. So how do you plan an after-school program that might randomly consist of a 6-year-old, four 8-year-olds, a 10, 11, and 12-year-old, three 14-year-olds, and a 17-year-old? The answer is: you don't. You summon your most potent powers of improvisation, adjust to events as they take place, and try to weather the class period, as the clock ticks ever more slowly.\n\nLuckily I had a seasoned pro as my mentor and cohort, the drama teacher Maxine. I had seen her wilt a youngster – and many an adu"
