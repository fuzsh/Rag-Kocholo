        "text": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a skin disorder that starts with blocked hair follicles, leading to painful nodules, abscesses and scarring. Front-line providers can work with dermatologists to diagnose and treat this often debilitating condition by asking three questions and following a five-tiered approach to treatment.\n\nDr. Vivian Shi, former UAMS dermatologist and director of the hidradenitis suppurativa clinic, offered tips to family medicine providers at the UAMS 2024 Family Medicine Spring Review last April. She said, “It requires a multidisciplinary approach. An HS team including all of these specialists and dermatology providers are the principal providers, but we really lean on front-line providers … to detect, treat, refer and to collaboratively manage.”\n\nMost of her HS patients have had it more than 10 years after having seen their providers at least five times, and around 15% are disabled or unable to work because of HS pain. Girls typically show signs in their early teens, and boys start in their mid to late teens. If the teen has severe acne, have the patient lift the arms to check for HS signs. The typical onset is between puberty and age 40, with women being three times more likely to be affected.\n\nThree key diagnostic questions every provider must ask the patient:\n\n1. In the last 12 months, did you repeatedly have big, painful nodules and boils in the armpits or groin?\n\n2. Have you had outbreaks of boils in the last six months?\n\n3. Do you repeatedly have outbreaks of big sores, painful nodules or boils that heal with scars in any of these locations?\n\nIf the answer is “yes,” there is a 90 percent chance of HS.\n\n“There’s no reason healthcare providers should be missing this if they ask these questions,” said Dr. Shi.\n\nHS can show up anywhere on the body – behind the ears, outer arms or legs – not just the skin folds and areas with sweat glands. The two exceptions are the palms and soles of the feet. It’s chronic, inflammatory and very painful. Initially, the patient will have inflamed nodules, abscesses, white heads and black heads. The more advanced stage includes draining sinus tracts (narrow channels) and severe scarring, which are especially true in Blacks. Often it is misdiagnosed as cellulitis.\n\nHS is divided into three Hurley Stages. The mildest is Hurley Stage 1: Abscesses that resolve without any trace of scarring, but this is rare. As soon as the patient has any sign of a scar, it’s labeled Hurley Stage 2. This stage includes recurrent abscesses, sinus tracts and scarring, but normal-looking skin will appear between them. The most advanced stage is Hurley 3, characterized by multiple connected sinus tracts and abscesses across the entire area with little to no normal-looking skin between. She describes it as an “over-exaggerated inflammatory response where, over time, the hair follicles connect with each other and form sinus tracts and extensive scarring.”\n\nDr. Shi recommended a pyramid of treatment. The front-line provider can manage all the treatments except for biologics, the top tier. In early moderate to severe patients (late Hurley 1 to early Hurley 2), Dr. Shi suggested preparing patients for biologic therapy by prescribing oral antibiotics because payors typically require patients to fail 90-plus days of systemic antibiotics to qualify. Regardless of disease stage, providers should refer the patient to a dermatologist for advanced therapy, while collaboratively managing the patient.\n\nLifestyle Modification\n\nThe first tier of the pyramid is lifestyle modifications where the provider would screen for comorbidities and start treatments. In a recent JAMA Dermatology report, patients with HS said diet changes were the most used non-prescription treatment with the Mediterranean diet and intermittent fasting both being effective. The two exercises that HS patients can tolerate are Pilates and swimming. Weight loss surgery is also a strong consideration if the patient is greater than 35 BMI, and if the patient smokes, encourage them to quit since cigarette smoke has dioxin-like compounds that can cause acne and scarring. Loose-fitting clothing and anti-chaffing products applied in skin folds can reduce friction and pain.\n\nIf the patient has draining sinus tracts, bathing helps to rinse out the tunnels. Dr. Shi recommends alternating daily with 10-minute baths of Epsom salt, CBD oil and ¼ cup 6% commercial bleach which help with pain, itch, relaxation and decrease biofilm.\n\nTopicals\n\nThe next level is topical treatments. She typically uses clindamycin 1%; however, resorcinol 15% elicits a better response in mild to moderate HS. Resorcinol is especially helpful because it breaks down the outer layers of the skin and unplugs the hair follicles. There are also washes such as benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine or dapsone. Dr. Shi cautioned against benzoyl peroxide wash used together with topical dapsone because they’ll have reversible yellowing of the hair follicles.\n\nOral Antibiotics\n\nDr. Shi’s office typically starts with the tetracycline family because it’s better at reducing inflammation in the hair follicle and less costly. She recommends 100 milligrams of doxycycline or minocycline twice daily or extended release minocycline at a weight-adjusted dose once a day for eight to 12 weeks. Dr. Shi cautioned that dosage may need to exceed 100 milligrams for it to work, so ensure the patient doesn’t have anemia. She uses this for flare-ups or to bridge to biologic therapy.\n\nRotating through combined systemic antibiotics also works, being careful not to extend beyond three months. One combination is clindamycin with rifampin. A second choice is rifampin with moxifloxacin and metronidazole, which is especially helpful for drainage. And one thing providers want to consider is to stop the metronidazole after six weeks because longer use can cause reversible peripheral neuropathy.\n\nCertain supplements also should be considered. Persons with HS typically have lower serum zinc levels. Prescribing 100 – 200 milligrams of daily zinc (with copper included after two months) has shown to reduce HS severity in 80% of patients. Another supplement to consider is Vitamin D since most patients with HS are deficient. Vitamin D regulates hair cycle and skin cell activity.\n\nHormonal Treatments\n\nDr. Shi recommends these hormonal / metabolic therapies:\n\nBiologics\n\nBiologics is the last step of treatment. Dr. Shi said providers should learn the basics of biologics so they can explain how it works before they refer to a dermatologist. The patient must be on at least 90 days of an oral antibiotic before most insurance will allow biologics.\n\nDr. Shi’s takeaways:\n\nAsk the three questions to have a high confidence of diagnosing HS.\n\nRefer to dermatology once diagnosed.\n\nScreen for metabolic syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, hormonal and mental health abnormalities.\n\nReverse screen for HS if the patient has Down syndrome.\n\nStart antibiotics if the patient has any scarring because biologics is the next step. Most insurance requires 90 days to four months of oral antibiotic to be eligible for biologic treatment, so this is the referral window.\n\nMore information on HS can be found at hs-foundation.org\n\nIf you’re interested in more of UAMS’ primary care CME/CE, check out our list of upcoming CME/CE here.\n\nUAMS’ 27th Annual Family Medicine Update with Tobacco & Disease Symposium will offer up to 18 hours of online continuing education Oct. 24–27, 2023, for primary care physicians, doctors of osteopathic medicine, advanced practice registered nurses, registered nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, physical therapists, respiratory therapists and certified health educators.\n\nPresented by the UAMS College of Medicine, the annual conference provides an opportunity for health care professionals to learn about the latest advances and information impacting family medicine.\n\nThe conference is completely virtual. Courses are offered in two-hour blocks, twice daily, at $40 per block, with sessions on Friday, Oct. 27, at no cost. Friday’s session offers three, two-hour blocks of content.\n\nTo register, visit https://cvent.me/nRD90O or call 501-686-6626 by Oct. 23.\n\nSeveral talks on cardiovascular issues will feature Andre Ramdon, M.D., who will speak on peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysms, and pharmacist Pilar Murphy will speak on the pharmacology to treat heart failure.\n\nLester Matlock, CFP, will offer practice tips for providers with his talk on “Work Until You Drop,” and physical therapist Andy Glidewell will give practical physical therapy pointers that providers can use in their practice.\n\nTwo experts will speak on opioid issues. Michael Mancino, M.D., professor at the UAMS Psychiatric Research Institute and program director for the Center for Addiction Services and Treatment, will discuss treating Opioid Use Disorder in primary care. Karen Burks, M.D., a family physician, will also be speaking on opioid use and prescribing.\n\nThe block on “Cravings to Consequences” will feature a talk on eating disorders with Laura Jones, APRN, who works with adolescents at Arkansas Children’s Hospital, and Elizabeth Cleveland, Ph.D., is slated to talk on fetal alcohol syndrome disorder.\n\nOther topics include maternal depression with Nikki Edge, Ph.D., and Shashank Kraleti, M.D., chair of the UAMS Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, and young onset colorectal cancer with Smita Krishnamurthi, M.D., with the Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Hematology and Oncology.\n\nFriday will be dedicated to the Tobacco & Disease Symposium with talks centered on tobacco cessation strategies, talking to patients about quitting tobacco and how tobacco/nicotine products are engineered to be more addictive.\n\nSymposium speakers include Emily Einstein, Ph.D., chief of science policy at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, who will talk on topics for teens regarding tobacco, alcohol and drug use; Aaron Weiner, Ph.D., owner of Bridge Forward Group; and Angela Criswell, M.A., director for GO2 for Lung Cancer, whose talk will focus on lung cancer screening as part of tobacco cessation.\n\nDr. Clinton Smith with 1st Choice Healthcare was named the Arkansas Cancer Coalition Healthcare Provider of the Year at the Arkansas Cancer Summit March 7 for his 75 percent rate of colorectal cancer screening with his patients.\n\nThe family physician has participated in the UAMS Partnerships in Colorectal Cancer Screening for Arkansas (PiCS-AR!) since 2020, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grant that seeks to raise colorectal cancer screening rates in the state. His 75 percent rate is closing in on the national goal of 80 percent set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable.\n\nSmith’s first year with the PiCS-AR! grant showed a screening rate of 65 percent. His rate grew to 70 percent in 2021 and has escalated in one year to 75 percent. He said the reasons for his higher screening rate stem from frequently reminding the patients of screening, making it easy for them to screen, and relaying the facts.\n\n“Each time I have a checkup with a patient (not even necessarily a wellness checkup), I try to mention (screening) and see if they’re due for anything. And if they are, we try to go ahead and facilitate that and get it set up,” said Smith. “The best time to (mention) it, in my opinion, is when you see them. Sometimes people are non-compliant and you may not see them for a while. Now, it does take extra time, and sometimes I get behind, but I feel that prevention is the key. It’s better to prevent a problem than to have to treat it later.”\n\nSmith gives his patients several screening options: stool-based tests and a colonoscopy. The stool-based tests (FIT or Cologuard) require that the patient send a sample of their stool in the mail, which takes minutes and is not invasive and requires no dieting, fasting or anesthesia. The colonoscopy is considered the most accurate for colorectal cancer screening, but with his rural patient population in northeast Arkansas, arranging a colonoscopy can be cost- and time-prohibitive.\n\n“I tell them about the options and let them decide. I think the FIT tests have helped a lot. We’re rural, so to get a colonoscopy, you not only have to take a day off of work, you have to drive 30 miles outside of town,” said Smith.\n\nColorectal cancer is the second deadliest cancer for Americans, and it’s on the rise with younger age groups, according to the American Cancer Society. The rate of new colorectal cancer cases among Americans younger than 55 increased from 11 percent of all cases in 1995 to 20 percent in 2019. The recommended screening age for those with average risk is 45, which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force lowered from age 50 two years ago because of this new trend. Screening at an earlier age means cancer will be caught in its first stage and is highly treatable if detected early.\n\nSmith also credits his employer, 1st Choice Healthcare, for allowing him to spend more time with his patients who are often chronically ill and require more than the suggested 15 minutes many physicians are tethered to. 1st Choice is one of two healthcare partners working with the PiCS-AR! five-year grant. Mid-Delta Healthcare System in eastern Arkansas is the latest system to join.\n\nLeticia Rodriguez, director of the Lovely Sunshine Learning Center in Little Rock, has transformed a room in her childcare center into a place where staff and clients can feel comfortable breastfeeding or pumping breast milk, thanks to a $3,000 subgrant from the UAMS Department of Family and Preventive Medicine’s State Physical Activity and Nutrition for Arkansas (SPAN).\n\nLovely Sunshine Learning Center is one of 15 early childcare centers that will receive the subgrants from SPAN, which is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity. SPAN seeks to encourage breastfeeding in early childcare settings because research has shown that children who breastfeed six months or more may reduce their risk of obesity as well as severe asthma, SIDS, ear infections and some chronic diseases.\n\nRodriguez has used the money to buy two nursery swivel chairs, a colorful throw rug, mini-refrigerator, lamp with USB outlets, boppy pillow, bookshelf and framed pictures for décor. She also wants a drape that will separate the room so two mothers can privately breastfeed at the same time. SPAN will also supply milk storage bags, posters and pamphlets.\n\n“I have a breastfeeding mom (parent of a student) and one staff member that breastfeed. My employee doesn’t care if anyone sees her breastfeed, but the mom was not comfortable in the room. She breastfed in the reception area which isn’t private because staff members and parents are always coming through,” said Rodriguez, who completed the room September 2022. “So far, the response has been good!”\n\nThree other childcare centers have also received the funds, and moms have immediately begun using the made-over rooms. Bingham Road Baptist Child Development Center in Pulaski County took an unused infant room and gave it a breastfeeding makeover, complete with chair, rug, mini-refrigerator, décor and covers for moms as they breastfeed their babies. A staff member and new mom were quick to use the room, with the new mom saying, “It’s so great not having to feed in my car.”\n\nTonya Ritter, director/coordinator for ABC Preschool at Heber Springs Elementary, has redone an unused office at the school with a soft chair, lamp, rug and mini-refrigerator. She plans to add a plant in the corner, brochure stand, framed landscapes for the walls and a shelf to house WIC information and a book about breastfeeding for children. Supplies for the moms are conveniently stored in a basket, and the room connects with the nurse’s office in case of issues.\n\n“It has been used by a few who had to pump in their cars on their breaks,” Ritter said. “They are so appreciative. We have a few expectant mothers who are so excited to have a place to go rather than their cars.”\n\nAnother childcare center that used the grant money is Janna’s Little Angels in Little Rock. Lanna Horton, director, transformed a room for storage/staff into a light-filled, colorful breastfeeding space for her families. Two moms have started using it, and the center plans to add a refrigerator to store milk. A door connects to the infant classroom, so mothers will now have a space where they can visit on their breaks, a much better solution than the director’s office.\n\nFebruary 1, 2022 – Kent McKelvey, M.D., 52, of Little Rock died Monday, Jan. 17. He was an Associate Professor in the Division of Genetics and served as Director of Cancer Genetics Services in the UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. He was also a long-time medical director for the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine’s Community Health and Education division.\n\nDr. McKelvey had been battling acute myeloid leukemia for the past five years. His devotion to his patients, his mission in his field and his love of life sustained him through three stem cell transplants, the most recent in July 2021.\n\nA faculty member since 2003, Dr. McKelvey was a founding member of the Division of Genetics and served as Director of Cancer Genetics Services in the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. He was a champion for Arkansans with Down syndrome and other genetic conditions and was instrumental in establishing the Adult Genetics Clinic at UAMS. He was invested as the inaugural recipient of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Chair in Clinical Genetics in 2009.\n\nDr. McKelvey was a nationally recognized leader on the ethical use of predictive genetic testing in clinical medicine and was on the forefront of teaching the responsible use of molecular genetics in preventive medicine. Between his own stem-cell transplants, he tenaciously continued his career seeing patients and families via telemedicine and working closely with the Arkansas Down Syndrome Association on their behalf. After many years of research, despite his ongoing battle with AML, he published definitive guidelines for treatment of adults with Down syndrome in JAMA in October 2020, and continued his collaboration with fellow members on the American College of Medical Genetics Secondary Findings Committee, which resulted in authorship of his final publication on genome sequencing in Nature Genetics in Medicine in May 2021.\n\nDr. McKelvey is one of six doctors from three generations of his family to practice in the state of Arkansas. He received his medical degree from UAMS in 1996 and completed his residency at the UAMS Family Medicine program in Texarkana. After working in emergency departments in DeQueen and Nashville, Arkansas, and two years in private practice in Mountain Home, he completed a fellowship in medical genetics at his college alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2003, he returned to Arkansas to raise a family and rejoined UAMS as Director of the Family Medicine Pre-doctoral Program in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine. Dr. McKelvey served in the Division of Genetics following its establishment in 2008, and continued to hold an additional appointment in Family Medicine. He directed the Medical Genetics Course in the College of Medicine, and was elected by his students for numerous teaching awards.\n\nDr. McKelvey brought his gift of strength and determination to the diverse roles he served at UAMS throughout his life. He was an intense person with a good sense of humor and a force of vitality wherever he went. Although his career goal was to give back to those around him, he spent much of his final years at UAMS as a patient rather than a physician, and he found himself overwhelmed with gratitude for the physicians, colleagues, nurses and staff who would treat him like family at the only hospital that would ever feel like home. He considered these final years to be the happiest of his life. Dr. McKelvey’s family would like to extend their thanks to all those who cared for him.\n\nService arrangements are on hold due to the recent pandemic surge, but a celebration of life is being tentatively planned both in Memphis and in Little Rock, and dates will be forthcoming.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Elise; his children, Caroline and Kent David McKelvey III; his stepdaughters, Anna Douglas Piper and Mary Catherine Piper; his sister and fellow UAMS faculty member Dr. Samantha McKelvey; his sister and Neonatal Intensive Care CNP, APRN at ACH, Betsy McKelvey Peeler, and their entire family in your thoughts during this difficult time. He is also survived by his mother and stepfather, Don Varner and Josephine Charlotte Egner Varner, and half-brothers Michael Varner and Matthew McKelvey. He was pre-deceased by father Dr. K. David McKelvey Sr."
