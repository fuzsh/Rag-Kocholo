(2001), the blockbuster hit The Fast and the Furious (2001), and Resident Evil (2002). With Hollywood calling her name, the future for this feisty Jersey girl is as strong as the punches she throws.\n\nJeremy Davies attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California. He made his film debut starring in David O. Russell's acclaimed first film, the Indy classic, \"Spanking the Monkey\", which became a surprise Sundance Film Festival winner, earning Jeremy an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance.\n\nDavies' portrayal of Tom Hanks' interpreter, 'Corporal Upham', in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning film, \"Saving Private Ryan\" also earned him considerable critical acclaim and subsequent Oscar buzz.\n\nDavies' other film credits include Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris\", with George Clooney and Viola Davis; \"Going All the Way\" with Ben Affleck; \"The Locusts\" with Vince Vaughn; Wim Wenders' \"Million Dollar Hotel\"; Lars von Trier's acclaimed avant-garde films, \"Dogville\" and \"Manderlay\" with Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgard; \"Rescue Dawn\" with Christian Bale and Steve Zahn, and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog; \"Nell\" with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson; \"Half Nelson\" writer/directors Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden's \"It's Kind of a Funny Story\"; \"Guncrazy\" with Drew Barrymore, and Jan de Bont's \"Twister\" with Phillip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nIn television, Davies was invited to join the cast of JJ Abram's groundbreaking show, \"Lost\", and soon after, his character, 'Daniel Faraday', quickly became an integral part of the \"Lost\" mythology and a favorite of critics and fans (to the extent that ABC began selling Faraday bobbleheads).\n\nAfter \"Lost\", Davies joined Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins and Margo Martindale on Graham Yost's acclaimed, Emmy winning FX show, \"Justified\", based on a short story by the great Elmore Leonard. Wildly against his better judgment, Yost generously granted Jeremy unusual freedom to develop the character of Mags Bennett's middle son, and Davies' subsequent ferocious and fragile Richard the Third-esque portrayal of Harlan, Kentucky outlaw 'Dickie Bennett' was so far removed from 'Daniel Faraday', his work earned him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor.\n\nDavies' television work also includes the Emmy-honored HBO film, \"The Laramie Project\".\n\nDavies was raised without television, and experienced a vividly nomadic (non-military brat), low-income childhood, growing up throughout the US and abroad, including Vermont, Seattle, Oregon, Kansas, Michigan, New Orleans, Latin America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and the Kingdom of California.\n\nIan Somerhalder was born and raised in the small southern town of Covington, Louisiana. His mother, Edna (née Israel), is a massage therapist, and his father, Robert Somerhalder, is a building contractor. He has Cajun (French), English, and Scots-Irish ancestry. Boating, swimming, fishing and training horses filled much of his recreational time growing up, as did the school drama club and performing with the local theater group. With his mother's encouragement, at age 10, he began a modeling career that took him to New York each summer. By junior high, he opted to put modeling on the back burner and focus more on sports and school. A few years later, when the opportunity to model in Europe arose, Somerhalder grabbed it, embarking on an enriching path of work, travel and study that took him to cities, including Paris, Milan and London. At 17, he began studying acting in New York and, by 19, had committed himself to the craft, working with preeminent acting coach William Esper. His fate was sealed while working as an extra in a club scene in the feature film, Black and White (1999). A talent manager visiting a client on the set spotted Somerhalder in a crowd scene of 400 and immediately signed him for representation. He was cast later for the drama Changing Hearts (2002) directed by Martin Guigui. Happy to be anchored in New York, Somerhalder spends much of his time studying acting, writing and practicing yoga. His recreational interests include water and snow skiing and horseback riding.\n\nThe entertainment industry isn't new to young Malcolm David Kelley, a show business veteran from the age of five.

He was also featured in numerous commercials, including Cap'n Crunch, Kool Aid, Disney and Kohl's department store. Recently, he was seen in a Snoop Dog video and completed a voice over for the Nickelodeon cartoon Fatherhood.\n\nIn 2010, Malcolm teamed with his former \"Gigantic\" co-star Tony Oller to create great music together and subsequently formed the pop/rap music duo MKTO. In March 2012 they proudly signed with Columbia Records and have completed their first album. Their debut song \"Thank You\" and music video was released worldwide on January 4, 2013. They will begin their U.S. tour in early 2013.\n\nMalcolm spent the first eleven months of his life in foster care before being adopted by the Kelleys. His sister, Sydney, was adopted by the family two months later. He enjoys playing soccer and basketball, despite his small stature. He keeps up with his favorite basketball team, the Lakers, and politics, even getting involved as class Treasurer at his middle school. His leadership earned him the role of Student Ambassador with People to People Student Ambassadors, with whom he traveled to the United Kingdom to represent the United States.\n\nA leading actress of theatre, film and TV in the former Yugoslavia, Mira Furlan emigrated to the U.S. with her husband, Goran Gajic, in November 1991, due to the intolerable political circumstances in her homeland.
