1960 Rome Italy Olympic Games Cycling 100 km

First Cycling 100 km Amateur Team Time Trial Olympic Event

Knud Enemark Jensen of Denmark participated in the 100 km Team Time Trial event in Rome he collapsed during the race, fractured his skull, and was pronounced dead in a nearby Rome hospital shortly thereafter. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, Roniacol (Ronicol/Roniacol Retard, Nicotinyl alcohol tartrate), a direct-acting peripheral vasodilator that causes flushing and may decrease blood pressure. He was also reported as swallowing eight pills of phenylisopropylamine and fifteen pills of amphetamine and coffee. On March 24, 1961, the three physicians who performed the autopsy submitted a final report stating that the death was caused by a heat wave, not by the drugs found in his body. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that "dope - whole cartloads -[were] used in such royal quantities."
