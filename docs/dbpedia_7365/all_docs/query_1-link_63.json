        "text": "One down. Seven to go.\n\nChina won its first gold medal in diving on Saturday on the first full day of competition in the Paris Olympics, a perfect start for the team of Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen.\n\nChina has ruled diving for decades, and three years ago in Tokyo it won seven of eight gold medals. But it's never pulled off the elusive gold sweep. That's the goal this time.\n\nThe Chinese were first on Saturday in the women's synchronized three-metre springboard with 337.68 points on five dives. They were followed by Sarah Bacon and Kassidy Cook of the United States 314.64 points and the British team of Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen with bronze and 302.28 points.\n\nThe same Chinese duo also won gold in the last three world championships and were heavy favourites going in.\n\nThe crowd, heavy with Chinese fans and and flags, chanted \"jiayou\" — roughly translated \"lets go\" — each time the Chinese walked out to dive.\n\nThis event was added in 2000, and Chinese women have won gold six times in seven Games. The only loss was to Russia in 2000. China won three years ago in Tokyo with Shi Tingmao and Wang Han.\n\nStarting with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics where China claimed its first diving gold, it had won 47 of 64 gold medals in diving. Add to that 23 silver and 10 bronze.\n\nIf you start counting from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China had won 27 of 32 gold at the Olympics.\n\nThese are the numbers before Paris. Now add another gold to the total and watch the numbers climb as the Olympis roll on in Paris.\n\nCanadian fencer Arfa upsets defending champ\n\nCanadian fencer Fares Arfa was narrowly defeated in the men's individual sabre quarterfinal on Saturday, hours after beating the three-time defending Olympic champion.\n\nArfa, making his Olympic debut, was defeated 15-13 by South Korea's Oh Sang-uk. Sang-uk is ranked fourth in the world, while Arfa ranks No. 35.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Arfa upset Aron Szilagyi, the three-time gold medallist from Hungary, 15-8.\n\nThe win sent him to the round of 16, where he defeated France's Bolade Apithy, also 15-8.\n\nThe 29—year-old Arfa, who was born in Algeria, hails from Laval, Que. He has represented Canada at two editions of the Pan American Games.\n\nOvernight rain postpones skateboarding\n\nThe first event of the skateboarding competition at the Paris Olympics on Saturday was postponed after rain overnight and into the morning.\n\nSkateboarding is played at the outdoor venue of La Concorde Urban Park in Paris. World Skate, the sport's governing body, cited adverse weather conditions for the move.\n\nMen's street skateboarding scheduled for Saturday was postponed to Monday. The women's event is scheduled for Sunday.\n\nRain has been one of the big stories early in the Games after constant showers and occasional downpours served as the backdrop for the opening ceremony. As of 10 a.m. local time, much of the rain had cleared from the area and no other events had yet been disrupted by rain.\n\nOlympic organizers apologize to South Korean athletes\n\nOlympic Games organizers said they \"deeply apologize\" for introducing South Korea's athletes as North Korea during the opening ceremony in Paris.\n\nAs the South Korean athletes waved their nation's flag on a boat floating down the Seine River Friday evening, they were announced in both French and English as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. South Korea is the Republic of Korea.\n\n\"We deeply apologize for the mistake that occurred when introducing the Korean team during the opening ceremony broadcast,\" the International Olympic Committee said in a post on X in Korean.\n\nThe South Korean Ministry of Culture Sports and Tourism Vice Minister Jang Mi Ran requested a meeting with IOC President Thomas Bach over the incident, the ministry said in a statement Saturday. It said the ministry also asked South Korea's Foreign Ministry to file \"a strong government-level complaint\" with the French government.\n\nThe statement said South Korea's Olympic committee separately asked the organizers of the Paris Games to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.\n\nThe Korean peninsula has been bitterly divided into South Korea and North Korea since the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nThe blue sign on the boat carrying the South Korean athletes did show the correct name.\n\nGeorgian shooter becomes 1st 10-time female Olympian\n\nGeorgian shooter Nino Salukvadze has become the first woman to compete at 10 Olympic Games in a career which began representing the Soviet Union.\n\nSalukvadze has competed at every Summer Olympics since 1988 — when she won gold as a 19-year-old Soviet prodigy. She set her latest record when she stepped into the shooting range for qualification in the women's 10-metre air pistol Saturday.\n\nSalukvadze placed 38th and didn't advance to Sunday's eight-shooter final, but she gets another shot at a medal Friday in qualification for the 25-metre pistol event.\n\nIn a career spanning five decades, Salukvadze has competed on three different Olympic teams — first with the Soviet Union in 1988, then the Unified Team which was organized for ex-Soviet athletes in Barcelona in 1992 after the Soviet Union collapsed. For the last eight Summer Olympics, she's represented her home country of Georgia following its independence.\n\nSalukvadze was in the spotlight again in 2008, when Russia fought a brief war with Georgia during the Beijing Olympics. Salukvadze won bronze and embraced Russian silver medallist Natalia Paderina on the podium in what was widely seen as a gesture for peace.\n\n\"Why did this gesture surprise everyone? We are athletes, there is no conflict between us,\" she said at the time.\n\nIn 2016, Salukvadze and her son Tsotne Machavariani, who's also a pistol shooter, became the first mother-and-son duo in Olympic history to compete at the same Games.\n\nSalukvadze had considered retiring after the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo three years ago but was persuaded to continue by her father and coach Vakhtang, who died this year.\n\nSalukvadze already had the record for most Olympic appearances by a female athlete and is now tied with Canadian showjumper Ian Millar for the most of any athlete.\n\nSalukvadze is the only Olympian to compete at 10 Summer Games in a row, unlike Millar, whose appearances weren't consecutive because Canada boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.\n\nCyclists criticize streets, man-made mountain bike venue\n\nRemco Evenepoel was unimpressed by the rough roads that Olympic cyclists had to cover in the time trial through Paris on Saturday, while Nino Schurter was just as critical of the gravel covering the man-made mountain bike course in nearby Elancourt.\n\nEvenepoel, fresh off his third-place finish in the Tour de France, described the first and last five kilometres of the time trial as bad roads being made worse by the rain, which made for a damp opening ceremony on Friday night and continued into Saturday, when the start of skateboarding had to be postponed due to the weather.\n\nThe time trial began upstream from the Eiffel Tower on the Esplanade, and covered 32.4 kilometres (19.8 miles) past Place de la Bastille and through the Polygone de Vincennes, before finishing at the gilded Pont Alexandre III bridge over the Seine River.\n\n\"Quite some beautiful sightseeing as well,\" Evenepoel acknowledged, \"but the road surface is pretty bad in the beginning and in the end. So that might be a problem if you have black spots in front of your eyes in the last kilometres. It's not so nice.\"\n\nThe Belgian is the reigning time trial world champion and won the first of two time trials during the Tour de France.\n\nMeanwhile, at Elancourt Hill about 40 kilometres (24.8 miles) outside of Paris, the Olympic mountain bike course was carved through the site of a former sandstone quarry-turned-landfill. It was regenerated into a park in the 1980s, and one of the highest points in the region now offers sprawling vistas of the Eiffel Tower, La Defense and the forests around Paris.\n\nThe course was designed by South African expert Nick Floros, who also designed the mountain bike venue for the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Games, and features man-made jumps and rock gardens with stretches of gravel-covered paths.\n\nThe women's competition is Sunday and the men cover the same course Monday.\n\n\"It's slippery. It's quite loose,\" said Schurter, a three-time Olympic medallist and the champion in Rio. \"If you go fast it's super slippery. I hope the gravel still goes a bit to the side and makes it less loose everywhere. You can feel there was no mountain biking before and it's 100 per cent man-made, like we saw in London and in Rio.\n\n\"It could be a bit more natural,\" Schurter acknowledged, \"but in general it's nice.\"\n\nBrazilian rider issued warning over horse treatment\n\nEquestrian's governing body issued a warning to Brazilian rider Carlos Parro on Saturday for potentially causing \"unnecessary discomfort\" to his horse Safira after receiving evidence from an animal rights group.\n\nThe Federation for Equestrian Sports received a letter and photos that were sent to its president, Ingmar De Vos, by animal rights group PETA on Friday. One photo shows Parro hyper-flexing Safira's neck in a prohibited movement called \"Rollkur\" — compromising the horse's breathing.\n\n\"The FEI Officials have issued a yellow warning card [to Parro] as the action of the athlete could have caused unnecessary discomfort to the horse. Additionally, the Ground Jury has directly addressed the situation with the athlete and the chef d'Equipe of Brazil,\" the FEI said in a statement. \"The FEI Stewards are aware of this incident and will be vigilant at all times for any behavior that is not in line with horse welfare and are prepared to take immediate action if such behavior occurs.\"\n\nPETA's letter, which was shared with The Associated Press, said \"Rollkur\" also damages the horse's spine and leads to long-term health issues.\n\n\"The pain this horse must be enduring is almost unimaginable,\" PETA said. \"The public is unlikely to accept this, as illustrated by the mass outrage over the Charlotte Dujardin abuse video.\"\n\nOther Canadian results:"
