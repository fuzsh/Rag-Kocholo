        "text": "Lydia Jacoby, 17, is the the first American Olympic swimmer from Alaska. She just won gold\n\nAmerican swimmer Lydia Jacoby has won the gold medal in the women’s 100m breaststroke.\n\nJacoby, just 17, was not expected to win the event. She beat South Africa’s Tatjana Schoenmaker, who clinched silver, and Lilly King of the US, who collected bronze.\n\nJacoby is the first-ever Olympic swimmer from Alaska.\n\nShe went to high school in Seward, a small, picturesque city in the south of the state with a population of fewer than 3,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Olympics Committee clinches the gold in men's gymnastics\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee has captured the gold medal in men’s all-round gymnastics.\n\nNikita Nagornyy, Denis Abliazin and Artur Dalaloyan and David Belyavskiy together scored a total of 262.500, which is the top mark.\n\nJapan claimed the silver with a total of 262.397, and China took the bronze medal with a score of 261.894.\n\nWhat is the Russian Olympic Committee? Due to a ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency for doping non-compliance, Russian athletes aren’t competing under their country’s name, flag and national anthem at major international sporting events until Dec. 16, 2022. They are officially recognized as members of ROC, an abbreviation of Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nOlympic champion Tom Daley hopes his gold medal can provide \"hope\" to LGBT community\n\nTeam Great Britain’s Tom Daley ended his long wait to top an Olympic podium after winning the men’s synchronized 10-meter diving competition with his partner Matty Lee on Monday.\n\nIn December 2013, Daley came out on YouTube and almost eight years later, the Briton says he is proud of the LGBT representation that he has witnessed at the Games.\n\nHe said that he hopes they don’t feel “so frightened and scared and alone.”\n\nDaley’s husband, screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, posted a video on Instagram of him screaming and celebrating the win from Canada as they watched the live event from afar. The couple have a three-year-old son together.\n\nIn comments after the event, Daley said he also felt he’d grown since becoming a husband and father.\n\n“My husband, he said to me that my story wasn’t finished, and that my son … needed to be there to watch me win an Olympic gold medal,” he said.\n\nRead more about Tom Daley here:\n\nNora Gjakova earns a Judo gold for Kosovo\n\nKosovo’s Nora Gjakova further extended the country’s golden Olympic judo record by winning the women’s under-57kg final on Monday.\n\nTwo-time world champion Gjakova defeated France’s Sarah-Léonie Cysique to claim her maiden gold medal.\n\nGjakova’s gold is Kosovo’s second of the Tokyo Games after Distria Krasniqi’s victory in the women’s under-48 kg category on Saturday.\n\nIt’s Kosovo’s third Olympic medal in total since the country made its debut at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nMajlinda Kelmendi earned the country’s first historic gold in the women’s under 52kg at Rio 2016.\n\nDefending champion Kelmendi, though, was eliminated in her first round contest in Tokyo on Sunday.\n\nThe Olympics are in full swing. Here's what you need to know\n\nHere are some highlights from the first Monday of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (in 2021).\n\nBig surprises and upsets:\n\nIn the performance of a lifetime, Austria’s Anna Kiesenhofer won the cycling gold medal, after she raced so far ahead that she was out of sight of the other cyclists. She only took up the sport in 2014 and does not have a professional contract at the moment.\n\nTunisia’s Ahmed Hafnaoui shocked the swimming world by winning gold in the 400m freestyle. During the preliminary round, he qualified in 8th place with the slowest qualifying time of all finalists.\n\nThe US men’s basketball team, flush with NBA stars, lost its first game to France. The French used the size of three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert and a magnificent performance from fellow NBAer Evan Fournier to shock the Americans, who could not capitalize on multiple attempts to close out the game.\n\nSome firsts:\n\nAnastasija Zolotic became the first American woman to win Olympic gold in Taekwondo and Fencer Lee Kiefer is the first US woman to win gold in individual foil.\n\nAt just 13, Nishiya Momiji of Japan, is now one of the youngest gold medal winners in Olympic history, after she won the women’s street skateboarding event. She is just months older than the current female record-holder, American diver Marjorie Gestring, who was 13 years and 267 days old when she won gold at the Berlin Games in 1936.\n\nWhat’s on tap today in Japan:\n\nSwimming: Britain’s Adam Peaty won the 100m breaststroke gold, while Ariarne Titmus beat American great Katie Ledecky in the women’s 400m freestyle final.\n\nRugby sevens: Rio 2016 winner Fiji beat host Japan 24-19 in the morning, while New Zealand, another favorite, took care of business against South Korea 50-5. A second round of matches will be held starting at 4:30 p.m. in Japan.\n\nCovid-19 continues to loom large:\n\nThe Games have been overwhelmingly unpopular among the Japanese public, according to polls. But the mood appears to be shifting as Japan brings in gold medals.\n\nMeanwhile, Tokyo continues to report a rising number of daily new coronavirus cases, with at least 153 cases linked to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, organizers said Monday.\n\nThe full schedule can be found on the Olympics website here.\n\nNationalist sentiment rises as China off to strong start at Tokyo Olympics\n\nEditor’s note: A version of this post appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nThe Olympics has long been an occasion for celebrating national pride. And for an increasingly confident China, the Tokyo Games is seen as the latest opportunity to showcase its national strength, as it looks to challenge the United States for top spot on the medal table.\n\nSo far, Team China has got off to a strong start, to the cheers of millions of fans online.\n\nOn Saturday, Chinese social media exploded in euphoria when shooter Yang Qian won the first gold of the Tokyo Games in the women’s 10-meter air rifle. The 21-year-old also set a new Olympic record with a 251.8 final score.\n\nAs of Monday morning in Japan, China has bagged six gold medals — three in weightlifting, one in fencing and one in diving in addition to Yang’s air rifle gold. That’s enough to top the medal table, followed by Japan and the United States.\n\nNationalist sentiment: On Weibo, China’s heavily censored version of Twitter, the Tokyo Games has been among the top trending topics since Friday evening. While many are rightfully proud of the Chinese team’s achievements, the nationalist sentiment has at times been more aggressive.\n\nThe comment sections of top state media outlets like the People’s Daily are among the most strictly censored corners of Weibo. The fact that the comment was allowed to receive nearly half a million “likes” and occupy top spot suggests at least official tolerance, if not encouragement of such rhetoric.\n\nIn other cases, the nationalist sentiment has gone too far even for Chinese censors. On Saturday, Yang was briefly attacked by some online nationalists and told to “get out of China” for having previously shown off her impressive collection of Nike sneakers on Weibo.\n\nNike, along with H&M and other big Western apparel brands faced calls for boycott in China in March, owing to their stand against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in Xinjiang.\n\nRead more:\n\nLuka Doncic just opened his Olympic career with 31 points ... in the half\n\nBasketball superstar Luka Doncic’s Olympic career is off to a tremendous start.\n\nIn his first game for Slovenia at the Summer Games, the 22-year-old Dallas Mavericks phenom scored 31 points — just in the first half.\n\nTo put that in context, Doncic scored more in a half than any player in last night’s marquee matchup between France and the United States.\n\nDoncic’s Slovenia led Argentina 62-42 going into the half.\n\nDoncic’s heroics should come as no surprise after the stellar season he put together in the NBA last year. In just his third season, he was named to the All-NBA first team and leapfrogged Michael Jordan on the all-time triple-double list.\n\nSkateboarder Nishiya Momiji, 13, just became one of the youngest gold medal winners ever\n\nTeenager Nishiya Momiji of Japan has won the women’s street skateboarding event.\n\nAt just 13 years old, she is now one of the youngest gold medal winners in Olympic history.\n\nShe is just months older than the current female record-holder, American diver Marjorie Gestring, who was 13 years and 267 days old when she won gold at the Berlin Games in 1936.\n\nMomiji’s win came just a day after fellow Japanese skater Yuto Horigome won the first-ever Olympic gold medal in skateboarding for the men’s street competition.\n\nThe silver medalist was another 13-year-old, Brazilian star Rayssa Leal. Japan’s Funa Nakayama, 16, took bronze.\n\nUS wins men's swimming 4x100m freestyle relay\n\nThe United States has won the gold medal in the men’s 4x100m freestyle relay at the Tokyo Olympics with a winning time of 3:08.97.\n\nIt’s the fifth gold medal for the US at the Games and 12th medal overall.\n\nItaly finished second for the silver medal with a time of 3:10.11, and Australia claimed bronze with 3:10.22."
