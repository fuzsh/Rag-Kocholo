More than 120 of its students, faculty, staff, and alumni have participated as inventors of sports, athletes, coaches, sport psychologists, trainers, judges, officials, administrators, researchers, reporters, volunteers, and more.\n\nSince the first U.S. Olympic Committee (now USOC) in 1894, Springfield College’s Humanics philosophy has been symbiotic with the Olympics. Serving on that committee was the director of the College’s Physical Department, Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick. The Olympic Charter defines Olympism as “a philosophy of life exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will, and mind...”\n\nSpringfield College is the only college to receive the Olympic Cup, which was created by Modern Olympics Founder Baron de Coubertin to honor an institution for furthering the Olympics through merit, integrity, and ideals.\n\nLong noted as an international pioneer in the field of athletics, Springfield College Professor of Exercise Science and Sport Studies Mimi Murray, Ph.D., worked with students and athletes as a sport psychologist and a coach, in the collegiate and international arenas, including as a coach of the U.S. Women's gymnastics team.\n\nDuring her six years as head coach of Springfield College women's gymnastics, Dr. Murray's teams were undefeated in dual meet competition, won five Eastern Championships, and three Division I National Championships. Murray coached the USA Team for the World University Games, was named National Gymnastics Coach of the Year, and has been a commentator for ABC's Wide World of Sports and NBC's Sportsworld.\n\nShe has been recognized by the Women's Sports Foundation as one of five \"pioneers\" in women's athletics. During the efforts to secure passage of the landmark Title IX legislation, Dr. Murray was a prime mover. Her textbook, Gymnastics for Women, is considered an authoritative source in sport. She appeared on The Jane Pauley Show in 2005 to discuss what has become a prevalent topic in today’s news: harassment of athletes by coaches.\n\nAs a sport psychology consultant, Murray has served with the USA Equestrian Team at the Los Angeles Olympic Games, the USA Field Hockey Team at the Atlanta Olympic Games, and worked with many professional, collegiate, and high school athletes and coaches.\n\nIn addition to the Women's Sport Foundation, she has been honored by numerous regional, national, and international organizations for her contributions to the field of physical education and women’s athletics, including with the Luther Halsey Gulick Award and the R. Tait McKenzie Award from the American Alliance of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance (AAHPERD, now known as SHAPE America). The Gulick Award honors an individual who exemplifies the highest standards in accomplishment, innovation, and leadership. She also has been recognized by the International Council of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, Sport and Dance; and as an Ethics Fellow of the International Institute for the Study of Sport. She was elected president of AAHPERD and elected president of the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport. She was inducted into the inaugural class of the New Agenda: Northeast Women's Hall of Fame, and is an inductee in the Springfield College Athletic Hall of Fame. She is the 2017 recipient of the Springfield College President's Humanics Achievement Award.\n\nFollowing is a partial compilation of Springfield College alumni who have showcased their talent and shared their expertise during the Olympic Games.\n\nInventors of Olympic Sports\n\nThe College’s most famous connection to the Olympics is the invention of two Olympic sports, basketball and volleyball, by alumni James Naismith and William Morgan.
