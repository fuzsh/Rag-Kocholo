He began rowing as a freshman at MIT, and for a couple of summers stole over to Great Hosmer for early-morning sculling sessions while the circus was in training. He attended graduate school at Oxford, and rowed in the Boat Race for four years, ending with a streak-breaking win against Cambridge in 2000. Returning to Boston, Toby was a coaching assistant to Harry Parker at Harvard for two years and continued training out of the Harvard boathouse for several more years. During this time he taught freshman physics at MIT and coached the Brookline High School boys’ team. He also spent two summers rowing with the elite men at Penn AC in Philadelphia. In 2008 he and his wife moved to Salisbury School in northwest Connecticut, where Toby teaches physics and coaches the rowing team. He turned his experiences at Harvard into The Sphinx of the Charles, a year-long profile of Harry Parker. Toby continues train and race in masters events, both on the water and on the erg, with recent wins at CRASH-Bs, the Head of the Charles, and other regattas.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJanet Bellantoni: Janet has been rowing and coaching for over 30 years, including coaching men and women at all levels (elite, club, masters, college, and juniors).

He was assigned to photograph the men’s 8+ event at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. Fujii took a gamble and jumped on the media launch following the boats down the race course. It was here he saw the beauty of synchronicity and power come together. After the USA 8+ won the gold for the first time in 40 years, Fujii vowed to learn more about the sport. Twenty years later, he’s still looking for that proper timing and power from sweep to sculling. Fujii coached everything from learn-to-row, youth, adult and a short stint coaching Texas Christian University's rowing crew. He recently departed Seattle's vibrant rowing scene for the tropical paradise of Hawaii. Fujii continues to work with youth and adult rowers with Ikaika Rowing and the Honolulu Rowing Club.
