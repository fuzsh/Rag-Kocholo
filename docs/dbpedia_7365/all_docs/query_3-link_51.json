This marks the third time Paris will host the Olympics, following the 1900 and 1924 Games, a testament to its enduring legacy in sports and its deep cultural roots.\n\nOver 100 years later, the Olympics returned to the “City of Light,” which is said to be the biggest Olympics yet. Thousands of athletes represent their countries in the beautiful city, which will host various events in some of its most famous locations.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, the Grand Palais, and the Champs-Elysees will serve as stunning backdrops for several competitors, providing a visually spectacular experience that blends sport with culture.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Summer Olympics will include Traditional sports and new additions that will aim to captivate audiences and sports fans worldwide.\n\nHere’s an in-depth look at the sports competition this summer.\n\n1.

Gymnastics:\n\nTrampoline: Athletes perform acrobatic moves while bouncing on a trampoline.\n\nRhythmic Gymnastics: Combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, and dance, performed with apparatus like ribbons and hoops.\n\n3. Basketball: Perhaps the most anticipated game in the Olympics with a loaded roster of All-time greats and up-and-coming superstars soon in the NBA.

This roster has been compared to the 1992 Dream Team that featured Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. Fans have even gone so far as to compare this year's roster to the Avengers because of the star power on the team.\n\nThe 12-player roster that will compete for the USA Men’s Basketball Team includes Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, and others. The roster includes old veterans like Lebron, Steph, and Durant and young players like Tatum, Anthony Edwards, and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nIt will be an excellent opportunity for young players to learn from the games played by old veterans during the Olympics. Steph, Lebron, and Durant are already in the final years of their careers, and this past season showcased each of them going home early in the playoffs. It was the first time in almost 20 years that the playoffs consisted of young players remaining, with Lebron and KD losing early.\n\nCurrently, the USA team is playing in the Basketball Showcase, a week of practice games against international teams to help prepare them for the Olympic games starting on July 28th against Serbia at 8:15 AM PDT.\n\nThe games' schedule will be in group stages. The USA team will play three games between July 28 and August 3. If they successfully win all the games, they will move on to the next round, the quarterfinals, until they reach the finals and play for the gold medal.\n\nThe Olympics have been described as the toughest to win a gold medal this year because of all the talents worldwide. There are so many better players internationally now than there were 10-15 years ago, including two-time MVPs Giannis Antentoukonmpo and Nikola Jokic, who will stand in the USA’s way of trying to bring home the gold.\n\nHowever, with this talented collection of players on the roster, Team USA is favored to continue its legacy of basketball dominance on the Olympic stage.
