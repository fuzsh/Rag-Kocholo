        "text": "One of my first modern memories is waking up to record my first summer Olympics in 1996. I was excited to learn about every new event and athlete. I’ll be leading Rustic Pathways travel programs in Japan this summer, and then I’ll be watching the games right after.\n\nFor the record, judo is my favorite summer sport and curling is my favorite during the winter games. Enjoy my giant list of facts about the Olympics. May the Olympic spirit flow through us all.\n\nAbout 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris start on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, with the official opening ceremony on Friday, July 26. Best of all, fans will be able to watch the summer Olympics in person, unlike the Tokyo 2020 Olympics which were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe 2024 games include the Refugee Olympic Team, with the number of refugee-athletes increasing from 10 in 2016 to 29 in 2024. The new Olympic sports for 2024 include: surfing, karate, skateboarding, and sport climbing. Baseball and softball will return to the summer games. They were cut in 2012.\n\nThe Olympic mascot is designed by the host country and represents a cultural trait of the host. The mascots for 2024 are called Phryge which means liberty cap and symbolizes the pursuit of liberty and freedom.\n\nFacts About the Ancient Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games (776 BC): The first Olympic games were held in Olympia, Greece, in 776 BC, and again every four years for 12 centuries. Olympia was a sacred area with olive tree plantations and a giant statue of Zeus.\n\nOlympic Truce: In ancient Greece, an Olympic Truce was declared during the games to ensure athletes and spectators could travel safely to the events. The games lasted five or six months.\n\nFirst Olympic Events (776 BC):\n\nFrom 776 to 724 BC, the only event at the Olympic Games was the stadion, a 190-meter footrace. The word stadium in English comes from this word. Contrary to popular belief, there was no chariot racing or marathon at this time.\n\nPankration was introduced in 648 BC. Pankration was a brutal combination of wrestling and boxing. The only rules were no biting and no eye-gouging. The bouts had no points, time limits, or weight classes. Fighters indicated surrender by raising an index finger. By the way, pankration competitors fought naked and covered in oil.\n\nMost Successful Olympic Athlete: The most accomplished athlete of this early Olympic era — the Usain Bolt of his day if you were — was Leonidas of Rhodes who won 12 titles across four consecutive Olympiads (164-152 BC). He won gold in three different foot race distances (190 meters, 400 meters and a race of varying distances holding weights in kind of a cross-fit style event) for four consecutive games.\n\nFacts About the Modern Olympics\n\nIntroduction and Early Modern Olympics\n\nModern Olympics Revival (1896): In 1896, the first modern Olympics were brought back by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. De Coubertin, a French teacher and historian, wanted to use the Olympic symbol to promote physical education and international peace. Baron Pierre de Coubertin envisioned the games as a way to encourage amateur competition in sports while increasing cultural understanding and a spirit of camaraderie between nations. The Olympics was the Rustic Pathways of its day.\n\nFirst Marathon (1896): The marathon was introduced in the first modern Games in 1896, to commemorate the run of Pheidippides from Marathon to Athens.\n\nFirst Olympic Event Winner (1896): The first Olympic event winner was James Brendan Bennet Connolly, who won for triple jump in 1896. He tried to take a leave of absence from Harvard to attend but the school turned him down. So, the first Olympic award winner was a Harvard dropout.\n\nYoungest Olympian (1886): The youngest Olympian of the modern Olympic games was a 10-year-old bronze medal-winning Greek gymnast Dimitrios Loundras. Loundras competed in the team parallel bars event in 1896.\n\nUnusual Events (1900): The 1900 Paris Olympics featured croquet and live pigeon shooting. Croquet is not in the Olympics anymore. Leon de Lunden of Belgium won the pigeon shooting medal.\n\nWomen in the Olympics (1900): Women have been allowed to compete in the Olympics since 1900. Women earned the right to vote in the United States in 1920.\n\nTug of War (1900): Tug of war was an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1920. Kids on the playground unite!\n\nFirst Modern Medal Awards (1904): The 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis were the first modern Olympics that awarded gold, silver and bronze medals for first, second and third place. In the 1896 Olympics, first-place winners got a silver medal and an olive branch, and second-place winners got a bronze medal and a laurel branch. There were no awards for third place.\n\nMarathon Standardized (1908): In the 1908 London Olympics, the marathon distance was standardized to 26 miles and 385 yards exactly (42.195 km).\n\nEarly 20th Century Olympic Milestones\n\nContinental Participation (1912): The 1912 Stockholm Games was the first to include athletes from all five continents. From 1912 to 1948, the Olympics included competitions in art categories such as architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The 1912 Olympics were the last to feature gold medals made entirely out of solid gold. I wonder if those last two facts about the Olympics are related?\n\nLongest Wrestling Match (1912): 1912 also featured the longest Greco-Roman wrestling match in Olympic history at 11 hours and 40 minutes, contested between Martin Klein of Estonia and Alfred Asikainen of Finland in 1912. The men tied. Time limits were introduced later to every one’s glee.\n\nOlympic Flag (1913): The Olympic flag was introduced in 1913, representing unity among the continents. The games were canceled in 1916 due to World War I. A flag didn’t help, I guess.\n\nOlympic Oath (1920): The Olympic oath, introduced in 1920, is taken by an athlete from the host country during the opening ceremony.\n\nFirst Winter Olympic Games (1924): The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, in 1924.\n\nOlympic Flame (1928): The first time the Olympic flame was lit during the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nNotable Events and Records\n\nFirst Olympic Village (1932): The 1932 Los Angeles Olympics saw the first Olympic Village built for athletes.\n\nFirst Live Broadcast (1936): The 1936 Berlin Games were the first to be broadcast live on closed-circuit television in Germany.\n\nYoungest Gold Medalist (1936): The youngest gold medalist is American Marjorie Gestring, a 13-year-old American springboard diver, who won in 1936.\n\nBest Sportsmanship: King Soloman Edition (1936): During the 1936 games, two Japanese pole-vaulters tied for second place and cut their medals in half to share them.\n\nBest Sportsmanship: Sharing is Caring Edition (2000): At the Tokyo Olympics (2021), men’s high jumpers Mutaz Essa Barshim from Qatar and Gianmarco Tamberi from Italy both cleared 2.37 meters. They were given the option to have a jump-off to decide the winner, but instead agreed to share the gold medal.\n\nOlympic Torch Relay (1936): The Olympic torch relay was started at the 1936 Berlin Olympics under the Nazi regime to highlight Aryan logistics and glory. The Olympics are mostly remembered for Jesse Owens winning four gold medals, deflating that Nazi supremacy myth.\n\nWorld War II Impact\n\nCanceled Games (1940 and 1944): Tokyo was initially selected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, but the games were moved to Finland and eventually canceled due to war. In fact, both the 1940 and 1944 games were canceled due to World War II.\n\nPolitical and Social Milestones\n\nGermany and Japan Banned (1948): Germany and Japan were banned from the 1948 Olympics after the World Wars.\n\n1956 Boycotts: Egypt, Iraq, Cambodia, and Lebanon boycotted in response to Egypt’s invasion by Israel, the United Kingdom, and France.
