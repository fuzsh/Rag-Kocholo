        "text": "The Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will see the worldâs best athletes put on a spectacle for viewers across the globe.\n\nLetâs have a look at the Olympians and Paralympians who are gearing up for a record-breaking appearance this summer.\n\nSarah Storey\n\nCountry:â¯Great Britain\n\nSport:â¯Cycling and swimming\n\nSarah Storey, Great Britainâs most decorated female Paralympian, began her journey as a swimmer at the age of 14 at Barcelona 1992. She secured two gold medals before competing in three more Paralympics, earning three additional golds, four silvers, and a bronze. In 2005, Storey transitioned to cycling, where she shattered the world record for the LC 1â2/CP 4 3km individual pursuit. Her remarkable achievements include a total of 17 gold, eight silver, and three bronze medals.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, Storey captured three gold medals in the pursuit C5, road race C4-5, and road time trial C5 â making it the ninth consecutive Games where she has medalled. Now, Paris 2024 will be her ninth Paralympics, where sheâs aiming to defend her titles once again.\n\nTeresa Perales\n\nCountry:â¯Spainâ¯\n\nSport:â¯Swimming\n\nTeresa Perales is the most decorated Spanish athlete at the Paralympic Games, amassing an impressive medal tally. Her Paralympic journey started at Sydney 2000, where she secured five medals (one silver and four bronze). Since then, she has consistently won medals in every Paralympics, European Championship, and World Championship she has competed in. To date, she boasts 27 Paralympic medals (seven gold, 10 silver, and 10 bronze), 20 world cup medals (three gold, 10 silver, and seven bronze), and 37 European Championship medals (10 gold, 19 silver, and eight bronze). Additionally, Teresa holds five world records.\n\nAs she prepares for her seventh Paralympic Games in Paris 2024, if the 48-year-old wins a medal she will equal legendary swimmer Michael Phelps medal record.\n\nNino Salukvadze\n\nCountry:â¯Georgia\n\nSport:â¯Shooting\n\nIn a career that has spanned almost four decade, Nino Salukvadze has won every title a shooter can. The Tokyo 2020 Games saw her become the first woman to compete in nine Olympics.\n\nAfter Salukvadze secured a quota spot for her country in the womenâs 25m pistol at the 2023 European Games, the 55-year-old is likely to equal the record set by Canadian equestrian jumperâ¯Ian Millar for most Olympic Games appearances (10).\n\nShe made her Olympic debut for the former Soviet Union at Seoul 1988, winning a gold and set a world record in the 25m pistol. Salukvadze would also go on to win silver in the 10m air pistol. At Beijing 2008, the shooter clinched bronze for Georgia in the 10m Air Pistol event.\n\nThe Georgian shooter has also stood on the podium total of 23 times with 11 golds, seven silver and six bronze across Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships.\n\nDiana Taurasi\n\nCountry:â¯United States\n\nSport:â¯Basketball\n\nAfter securing her fifth consecutive gold medal in Tokyo 2020, the American point guard said: âSee you in Paris.â\n\nTaurasi will be 42 years old when she takes to the court in the French capital and will be eyeing off a sixth consecutive gold medal. If she does, sheâ¯will become the most-decorated team athlete of all time.\n\nHer time on the Olympic stage has seen drastic change from her Athens 2004 teammate Dawn Staley becoming her coach at Tokyo 2020 to Seimone Augustus who Taurasi won three gold with is now on the USA Basketball committee selecting the Paris 2024 team. Evenâ¯Sue Bird, who won five golds alongside Taurasi (the only two Olympic basketball players to achieve this feat), has retired.\n\nRodrigo Pessoa\n\nCountry:â¯Brazil\n\nSport:â¯Equestrian\n\nAlongside football legend Formiga and sailor Robert Scheidt, Pessoa shared the record for most summer Olympic appearances (7) by a Brazilian. Well, thatâs about to change with 51-year-old set to compete in his eighth Olympics.\n\nPessoa made his debut at Barcelona 1992 as a 19-year-old, becoming one of the youngest riders to compete in the Olympics. Then at Atlanta 1996, he helped Brazil win Team Jumping bronze. He would stand on the podium two more times, taking bronze again in the Team Jumping at Sydney 2000 then silver (later upgraded to gold) for Individual Jumping in Athens 2004.\n\nEquestrian runs within Pessoa veins as his father competed in five editions of the Olympics between Melbourne 1956 and Barcelona 1992.\n\nWhat about the Aussies?\n\nAndrew Hoy holds the Australia record for most Olympic Games appearances with eight followed by Colin Beashel (Sailing), James Tomkins (Rowing), Russell Mark (Shooting), Michael Diamond (Shooting), Jian Fang Lay (Table Tennis) and Mary Hanna (Equestrian), whoâve all made six appearances.\n\nIn Paris, Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are set to join Andrew Gaze as the only Australian men basketballers to play at five Olympics. Meanwhile, Lauren Jackson will become the first Opals player to don the green and gold at a fifth Olympics.\n\nJacksonâs selection comes 12 years after she last played at an Olympic Games â London 2012 â making it the fourth-longest gap between Olympic appearances in Australian history.\n\nMeanwhile, diver Melissa Wu will become the first Australian diver to make five Olympic Games. In fact, itâs something only eight other divers in the history of the sport have achieved.\n\nEdwina Tops-Alexander (Equestrian) and Eddie Ockenden (Hockey) will also join the fifth Olympic Games club at the upcoming Games.\n\nWheelchair basketball teammates Tristan Knowles and Shaun Norris will gear up for their sixth Paralympic Games. Both Rollers made their Paralympic debut at Athens 2004, where they bagged silver before going on to win gold four years later at Beijing 2008.\n\nWheelchair Rugbyâs Ryley Batt is also set to feature in his sixth Paralympic Games. Considered one of the greatest players to grace the game and has two Paralympic gold medals plus a silver in his collection."
