        "text": "MLB – Major League Baseball\n\nYesterday\n\nDetroit Tigers 6, Seattle Mariners 2\n\nOakland Athletics 3, Chicago White Sox 2\n\nChicago Cubs 8, Minnesota Twins 2\n\nTigers 6, Mariners 2 – Skubalâs 7 strong innings and Meadowsâ homer saving catch lead Tigers beat Mariners 6-2\n\nTarik Skubal allowed two runs over seven innings, Parker Meadows made a homer-saving catch in the eighth inning and the Detroit Tigers beat the Seattle Mariners 6-2. Skubal was overpowering in stretches. The 27-year-old left-hander allowed three hits, struck out nine and continued to strengthen his resume in the AL Cy Young Award conversation. But Meadows’ catch will be the lasting image of the game as Seattle dropped out of first place in the AL West. With Seattle trailing 3-2 in the eighth, Cal Raleigh’s bid for a second home run in the game was denied by Meadows at the wall in center field. Detroit added three more runs in the ninth inning.\n\nAthletics 3, White Sox 2 – A’s score 3 in the 7th inning for a 3-2 win over White Sox\n\nArmando Alvarez and Zack Gelof hit RBI singles and Lawrence Butler knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly â all in the seventh inning â as the Oakland Athletics rallied past the Chicago White Sox 3-2. The White Sox lost their 10th straight series, one day after ending their American League record-tying 21-game losing streak. Chicago (28-89) hasnât won consecutive games since a three-game winning streak from June 27-29. The White Sox fell to 8-24 in one-run games and 0-67 when trailing after seven innings. Oakland (48-68) improved to 5-1-1 in its last seven series. Andrew Benintendi hit a two-run homer for Chicago.\n\nCubs 8, Twins 2 – Ian Happ and Michael Busch homers power Cubs past Twins 8-2\n\nIan Happ and Michael Busch homered and five Chicago pitchers combined for a six-hitter as the Cubs beat the Minnesota Twins 8-2. Javier Assad worked the first four innings and Jorge LÃ³pez (2-2) worked two innings and earned the victory. The Cubs took the last two games of the three-game series and have won six of their last eight. Matt Wallner and Brooks Lee had RBI hits for the Twins.Â Happ hit a two-run homer off Josh Winder in the fourth inning, a 376-foot shot that landed in the palm of the hand of a fan standing in the party deck in right field. Dansby Swanson and Christian Bethancourt added RBIs off Caleb Theilbar in the eighth.\n\nTonight\n\nDetroit (TBD) at Seattle (Woo 5-1), 9:40 p.m.Â Â Â Â Â News/Talk/Sports 94.9 WSJM 9:15\n\nWhite Sox and Cubs are off\n\nNFL – NFL Preseason\n\nTonight\n\nDetroit Lions at New York Giants, 7:00 p.m.\n\nNFL – Giants and Lions each fined $200,000 for multiple fights during joint practices\n\nThe NFL has fined the Giants and Lions each $200,000 for multiple fights that broke out at join practices between the teams this week. On Monday, there were at least four scrums after plays where the players rushed to the altercation from all sides of the field and peace was eventually restored. Two of those fights involved Lions All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, one with safety Dane Belton and the other with rookie cornerback Dru Phillips. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones rushed into one tussle. Lions defensive back Emmanuel Moseley is out indefinitely after being injured in one of the fights. On Tuesday, Giants rookie WR Malik Nabers got into a fist-swinging altercation with Lions safety Kerby Joseph.\n\nNCAAFB – NCAA hands Jim Harbaugh a 4-year show cause order for recruiting violations\n\nThe NCAA says former Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh had impermissible contact with recruits and players while access was restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has handed him a four-year show-cause order if he wants to return to college coaching. The NCAA says Harbaugh engaged in unethical conduct, failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance and violated head coach responsibility obligations. Harbaugh left the national-championship winning Wolverines to coach the Los Angeles Chargers. The NCAA has already given Michigan three years of probation, a fine and recruiting limits in the same case.\n\nOlympics – Hall gives US another come-from-behind gold\n\nQuincy Hall became the latest American to electrify Olympic track and field with an out-of-nowhere comeback on Day 12 of the Paris Olympics. Hall sprinted from far behind in the 400 meters to reel in three runners and capture the gold medal. He crossed the line in 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever. Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. The win came about an hour after Noah Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal heat. Lyles will race for the gold medal Thursday.\n\nOlympics – U.S. takes silver and almost pulls upset in steeplechase\n\nSoufiane El Bakkali of Morocco defended his title in the menâs steeplechase with a .36-second win over American rival Kenneth Rooks.Â Rooks had the lead heading into the homestretch and was looking to pull off a massive upset, but El Bakkali overtook him. Rooks still beat his personal best by almost 9 seconds to capture the second silver in three Olympics in the event for the United States.\n\nOlympics – U.S. women’s basketball keeps winning\n\nAâja Wilson scored 20 points and Jackie Young added 15 to help the United States beat Nigeria 88-74 in the women’s basketball quarterfinals. The victory extended the Americans’ record Olympic winning streak to 59.Â Breanna Stewart also had 13 points for the Americans, who havenât lost since the 1992 Barcelona Games and are now two victories away from an unprecedented eighth consecutive gold medal. They will face a familiar foe in Australia in the semis.\n\nOlympics –Americans win gold in women’s team pursuit\n\nThe American womenâs pursuit team had twice before raced for the Olympic gold medal, and it had been on the podium all three times the cycling event had been on the program for the Summer Games.Â Successful, but never on top. The U.S. changed that at the Olympic velodrome when road race champion Kristen Faulkner, time trial bronze medalist Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Lilly Williams finally took that last step up. They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nWinter Olympics –U.S. figure skaters finally get their medal\n\nA touch of winter came to the Summer Games when the United States figure skating team finally got their gold medals as 2022 Olympic champions.Â The special medal ceremony allowed the nine Americans to receive the medals exactly 2Â½ years after the figure skating team event ended at the Beijing Olympics. A doping saga from the winning Russian team led to the Americans being declared the winner.Â All nine American skaters came to Paris: Karen Chen, Evan Bates, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou. Seven of the eight members of the Japan team came to get their silver medals â an upgrade from their third-place result in Beijing.\n\nMEDAL COUNT\n\nG\n\nS\n\nB\n\nTOTAL\n\nUnited States\n\n27\n\n35\n\n32\n\n94\n\nChina\n\n25\n\n23\n\n17\n\n65\n\nFrance\n\n13\n\n17\n\n21\n\n51\n\nGreat Britain\n\n12\n\n17\n\n20\n\n49\n\nAustralia\n\n18\n\n12\n\n11\n\n41\n\nJapan\n\n12\n\n6\n\n13\n\n31\n\nSouth Korea\n\n12\n\n8\n\n7\n\n27\n\nItaly\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n27\n\nNetherlands\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n20\n\nCanada\n\n6\n\n4\n\n9\n\n19\n\nGermany\n\n8\n\n5\n\n5\n\n18\n\nBrazil\n\n2\n\n5\n\n7\n\n14\n\nSpain\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n11\n\nNew Zealand\n\n3\n\n6\n\n1\n\n10\n\nRomania\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n8\n\nSweden\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n8\n\nHungary\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n8\n\nUkraine\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n8\n\nIreland\n\n4\n\n0\n\n3\n\n7\n\nKazakhstan\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n7\n\nSwitzerland\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n7\n\nGreece\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n7\n\nCroatia\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n6\n\nIsrael\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n6\n\nPoland\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n6\n\nCuba\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\nBelgium\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n5\n\nJamaica\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n5\n\nThailand\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\nKenya\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\nChinese Taipei\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n5\n\nNorth Korea\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\nPhilippines\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nHong Kong\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nGeorgia\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\nSouth Africa\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\nTurkey\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\nDenmark\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\nUzbekistan\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIran\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nMexico\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\nArmenia\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\nLithuania\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nTajikistan\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n3\n\nIndia\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n3\n\nSerbia\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\nUganda\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\nSaint Lucia\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\nEcuador\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\nChile\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\nGuatemala\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNorway\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCzechia\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nEthiopia\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nKosovo\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTunisia\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMalaysia\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nDominican Republic\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nMoldova\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nBahrain\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nMorocco\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nDominica\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nAlgeria\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nSlovenia\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nArgentina\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nColombia\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nMongolia\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFiji\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nCyprus\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nZambia\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPortugal\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPeru\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIndonesia\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nGrenada\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nEgypt\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCape Verde\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSlovakia\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAustria\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMWL â Midwest League Baseball\n\nLast Night\n\nWest Michigan 7, Beloit 0\n\nLansing 3, Great Lakes 2\n\nFort Wayne 3, South Bend 1"
