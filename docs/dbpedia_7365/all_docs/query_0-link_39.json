        "text": "Here we present an archive of the hits of each of the Summer Olympic Games from 1948 together with some memory-jogging highlights.\n\nGreece was the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896. The revival of the ancient Olympics attracted athletes from 14 nations, with the largest delegations coming from Greece, Germany, France and Great Britain. On 6 April 1896, the American James Connolly won the triple jump to become the first Olympic champion in more than 1,500 years.\n\nTo summarise, the first 13 Olympiads were as follows: (we'll pick up the detail with the post-WWII Olympics staged in Britain in 1948.)\n\n1896 - the I Olympiad: Athens\n\n1900 - the II Olympiad: Paris\n\n1904 - the III Olympiad: St. Louis\n\n1908 - the IV Olympiad: London\n\n1912 - the V Olympiad: Stockholm\n\n1916 - the VI Olympiad: no games due to WWI\n\n1920 - the VII Olympiad: Antwerp\n\n1924 - the VIII Olympiad: Paris\n\n1928 - the VIX Olympiad: Amsterdam\n\n1932 - the VX Olympiad - Los Angeles\n\n1936 - the VXI Olympiad - Berlin\n\n1940 - the VXII Olympiad - no games due to WWII\n\n1944 - the VXIII Olympiad - no games due to WWII\n\nAnd in detail...\n\nLondon 1948\n\nHelsinki 1952\n\nMelbourne 1956\n\nRome 1960\n\nTokyo 1964\n\nMexico City 1968\n\nMunich 1972\n\nMontreal 1976\n\nMoscow 1980\n\nLos Angeles 1984\n\nSeoul 1988\n\nBarcelona 1992\n\nAtlanta 1996\n\nSydney 2000\n\nMain index\n\nLondon, Great Britain, 1948\n\nDates of the XIV (14th) Olympiad: 29 Jul - 14 Aug\n\nOpened by: His Majesty King George VI\n\nOlympic flame lit by: John Mark (athletics)\n\nParticipating countries: 59\n\nDespite the difficult years due to the rationing of food, clothing and other essential products, the British Organising Committee did a remarkable job. Spartan Games it could be said but it was a true victory over dark times.\n\nThe 1948 London Games were the first to be shown on home television, although very few people in Great Britain actually owned sets. A womens canoeing event was held for the first time - and won by Karen Hoff of Denmark. 17-year-old American Bob Mathias won the decathlon only four months after taking up the sport. He is the youngest athlete in Olympic history to win a mens athletics event. Two athletes who were Olympic champions in 1936 managed to defend their titles twelve years later. They were Ilona Elek of Hungary in womens foil fencing and Jan Brzak of Czechoslovakia in the canoeing Canadian pairs 1,000m. Dutch mother-of-two Fanny Blankers-Koen, nicknamed the 'flying-housewife', was the world record holder in six events, but, according to the rules of the day, was only allowed to enter four. She won all four: the 100m dash, the 80m hurdles, the 200m and the 4x100m relay. Concert pianist Micheline Ostermeyer of France won both the shot put and the discus throw. Karoly Takacs was a member of the Hungarian world champion pistol shooting team in 1938 when a grenade shattered his right hand - his pistol hand. Takacs taught himself to shoot with his left hand and, ten years later, he won an Olympic gold medal in the rapid-fire pistol event. The United States once topped the medal table with Sweden and France their nearest rivals.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 3\n\nDouble Sculls (rowing)\n\nCoxless Pairs (rowing)\n\nSwallow (sailing)\n\nTop Hits of the 1948 Olympic Games 1 Anne Shelton with The Wardour Singers * Bill Johnson * Bing Crosby * Denis Martin * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Josef Locke * Joseph McNally * Michael O'Duffy with Duncan Morison * Robert Wilson * The Sentimentalists presented by Billy Cotton Galway Bay 2Sam Browne with The Keynotes & Primo Scala's Accordion Band * The Andrews Sisters * The Merry Melody Makers * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraHeartbreaker 3Bing Crosby * Enric Madriguera & his Orchestra * Jack White & his Orchestra * Jimmy Dorsey & his Orchestra * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Lou Preager & his Orchestra * Vaughn Monroe & his Orchestra * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraDance Ballerina Dance 4Anne Shelton * Archie Lewis with The Geraldo Strings * Jack Simpson & his Sextet featuring Dave Kydd * Joe Loss & his Orchestra with Howard Jones * Rita WilliamsTime May Change 5Al Jolson * Art Mooney & his Orchestra * Russ Morgan & his Orchestra featuring Milt Herth organ * The Merry Melody Makers * Turner Layton * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraI'm Looking Over A Four-Leaf Clover 6Dick Haymes & The Song Spinners * Dick James * Jack White & his Orchestra * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Mantovani & his Concert Orchestra * Nat 'King' Cole * Nat 'King' Cole * Red Ingle & The Unnatural Seven * Sarah Vaughan * Turner LaytonNature Boy 7Charles Williams & his Concert Orchestra * Frederick Ferrari * John Hendrik * Mantovani & his Concert Orchestra * Philip Green & his Orchestra * Reggie Goff * Ronnie Ronalde * Tano Ferendinos * The Luton Girls' Choir with Herbert DawsonThe Dream Of Olwen 8Johnny Denis & his Ranchers with Primo Scala & his Accordion Band * Lou Preager & his Orchestra with Rusty Hurren * Oscar Rabin & his Band with Harry Davis with Diane * The Andrews Sisters * The Five Smith BrothersToole Oolie Doolie (The Yodel Polka) 9Bing Crosby * Geraldo & his Orchestra with Carole Carr * Guy Lombardo & his Royal Canadians with Don Rodney * Jack Fina & his Orchestra * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraGolden Earrings 10Anne Shelton with The Keynotes & Alan Dean (woodpecker effects) * Danny Kaye & The Andrews Sisters with The Harmonica Gentlemen * Geraldo & his Orchestra * Kay Kyser & his Orchestra * Lou Preager & his Orchestra * Mel Blanc with The SportsmenWoody Woodpecker\n\nNB: The above chart is based on sheet music (hence the number of different artists) as there are no details of record sales until Nov 1952.\n\nTop of page\n\nHelsinki, Finland, 1952\n\nDates of the XV (15th) Olympiad: 19 Jul - 3 Aug\n\nOpened by: President Juho Paasikivi\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Paavo Nurmi et Hannes Kolehmainen (athletics)\n\nParticipating countries: 69\n\nThe 1952 Helsinki Games began dramatically as Paavo Nurmi, now 55 years old, carried the torch into the stadium and handed it to Hannes Kolehmainen, now 62, who lit the cauldron. It seemed appropriate that the most impressive achievements in Helsinki should be those of another long-distance runner, Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia, who became the only person in Olympic history to win the 5,000, 10,000 and marathon at the same Olympics. The Soviet Union entered the Olympics for the first time. Although their athletes were housed in a separate \"village\", warnings that Cold War rivalries would lead to clashes proved unfounded. Particularly impressive were the Soviet women gymnasts who won the team competition easily, beginning a streak that would continue for forty years until the Soviet Union broke up into separate republics. One of the first women allowed to compete against men in the equestrian dressage was Lis Hartel of Denmark. Despite being paralyzed below the knees after an attack of polio, Hartel, who had to be helped on and off her horse, won a silver medal. Lars Hall, a carpenter from Sweden, became the first nonmilitary winner of the modern pentathlon. Back in 1924, Bill Havens had been chosen to represent the United States in coxed eights rowing, but declined in order to stay home with his wife, who was expecting their first child. Twenty-eight years later, that child, Frank Havens, won a gold medal in the Canadian singles 10,000m canoeing event.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 1\n\nGrand Prix Team Jumping (equestrian)\n\nTop Hits of the 1952 Olympic Games 1Billy Cotton & his Band * Billy Thorburn's The Organ \"the Dance Band & Me * Les Baxter & his Chorus & Orchestra * Sharkey & his Band * Teddy Johnson * Vera Lynn with Soldiers & Airmen of HM Forces * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraAuf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart 2Alma Cogan * Edmundo Ros & his Rumba Band * Hugo Winterhalter & his Orchestra * Lee Lawrence * Leroy Anderson & his 'Pops' Concert Orchestra * Ray Martin & his Concert Orchestra * Ray Martin & his Concert Orchestra * Reginald DixonBlue Tango 3Art Mooney & his Orchestra * Bill Darnel * Bill Macey & his Orchestra * Ella Mae Morse * Harry James & his Orchestra * Oscar Rabin & his Band * Ronald Chesney & George Elliott * Sid Phillips & his Band * Sy Oliver & his Orchestra * Ted Heath & his MusicThe Blacksmith Blues 4Alma Cogan & Larry Day * Alma Cogan & Larry Day * Billy Cotton & his Band (Alan Breeze The Mill Girls & Chorus) * Dickie Valentine * Teddy Johnson * Vera Lynn with Sailors Soldiers & Airmen of HM Forces * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraThe Homing Waltz 5Billy Cotton & his Band with Charles Smitton * Dennis Lotis * Eddie Fisher * Franklyn Boyd * Norman Kay * Roberta Lee * The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraTell Me Why 6Bill Hayes * Billy May & his Orchestra * Frankie Laine * Lita Roza * Tex Ritter with instrumental accompaniment * Tex Ritter with Wordless Orchestra * Wilfrid ThomasHigh Noon (Do Not Forsake Me) 7Bill Hurley * Bill Hurley * Bob Eberly * Camarata & his Music * David Hughes * Dennis Day * Dickie Valentine * Jan Garber & his Orchestra * Lee Lawrence * Lester Ferguson * Toni ArdenNever 8the Dance Band & Me * Donald Peers * Eve Boswell * Guy Mitchell * Jimmy Young * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Teddy Johnson with The Peter Knight Singers * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraWe Won't Live In A Castle 9Bill Johnson with Ted Heath & his Music * Guy Mitchell * Jerry Gray & his Orchestra * Mickey Katz & his Orchestra & Chorus(There's A Pawnshop) On A Corner In Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 10David Hughes * Dick Beavers * Eddie Fisher * Eddie Fisher * Eve Boswell * The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraI'm Yours 11Alan Dean * David Hughes * Don Estes * Dorothy Squires * Eddy Howard & his Orchestra * Helen O'Connell * Jimmy Young * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Peggy Lee * Roberto Inglez & his Orchestra * Vera Lynn * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraBe Anything (But Be Mine) &nbsp12Billy May & his Orchestra * Dick James * Dorothy Squires * Joe Loss & his Orchestra * Luckie Robinson * Nat 'King' Cole * Ray Martin & his Concert Orchestra * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraUnforgettable 13Jimmy Young * Johnnie Ray * Paul Chapman * The Four Knights * The Maple Leaf Four * Vera LynnCry 14the Dance Band & Me * Burl Ives * Dinah Shore with The Peter King Singers * Gary Miller * Robert Wilson * Vera Lynn with Soldiers & Airmen of HM Forces * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom OrchestraFrom The Time You Say Goodbye (The Parting Song) 15Billy Cotton & his Band * Frankie Laine with The Norman Luboff Choir * Frankie Laine with The Norman Luboff Choir * Harry Farmer * Tennessee Ernie * The WeaversThe Gandy Dancers' Ball 16Diana Coupland * Doris Day * Ella Fitzgerald * Mickey Katz & his OrchestraA Guy Is A Guy 17Guy Mitchell * The StargazersThe Day Of Jubilo (Tell It To The Preacher) 18Bill Hurley * Bing Crosby * Evelyne Dorat * Kurt Burling & his Rococo Orchestra * Lee Lawrence * Norrie Paramor & his Orchestra * Ray Martin & his Concert Orchestra * Roberto Inglez & his Orchestra * Ted Straeter & his Orchestra * Tony MartinAt Last At Last 19Billy Cotton & his Band * Eddie Fisher * Eddie Fisher * Lou Dinning with Quartet * Teddy Johnson * Victor Silvester & his Ballroom Orchestra * Wally Peterson & Joy NicholsTrust In Me 20Dick Haymes * Frankie Laine with The Norman Luboff Choir & Carl Fischer (piano) * Lee Lawrence * Roberto Inglez & his OrchestraWhen You're In Love\n\nNB: The above chart is based on sheet music (hence the number of different artists) as there are no details of record sales until Nov 1952.\n\nTop of page\n\nMelbourne, Australia, 1956\n\nDates of the XVI (16th) Olympiad: 22 Nov - 8 Dec\n\nOpened by: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Ron Clarke (athletics)\n\nParticipating countries: 72\n\nMelbourne won the right to host the 1956 Olympics by one vote over Buenos Aires. Australian quarantine laws were too severe to allow the entry of foreign horses, so the equestrian events were held separately in Stockholm in June. The Melbourne Games were the first to be held in the southern hemisphere. Laszlo Papp of Hungary became the first boxer to win three gold medals. American Pat McCormick won both diving events, just as she had in 1952. Two athletes dominated the gymnastics competition. On the mens side, Ukrainian Viktor Chukarin earned five medals, including three gold, to bring his career total to eleven medals, seven of them gold. Agnes Keleti of Hungary brought her career total to ten medals by winning four gold medals and two silver. The U.S. basketball team, led by Bill Russell and K.C. Jones, put on the most dominant performance in Olympic history, scoring more than twice as much as their opponents and winning each of their games by at least 30 points. U.S. weightlifter Paul Anderson weighed 137.9kg. In weightlifting, ties are broken by awarding the higher place to the athlete with the lower body weight. Incredibly, this worked to Andersons advantage when he tied for first with Humberto Selvetti of Argentina. Selvetti weighed 143.5kg. Prior to 1956, the athletes in the Closing Ceremony marched by nation, as they did in the Opening Ceremony. In Melbourne, following a suggestion by a young Australian named John Ian Wing, the athletes entered the stadium together during the Closing Ceremony, as a symbol of global unity.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 3,000m Steeplechase (Chris Brasher)\n\nWomen's 100m Backstroke (Judith Grinham)\n\nLightweight (57-60 kg) (Richard McTaggart)\n\nWomen's Individual Foil (Gillian Sheen)\n\nTeam Three-Day Event (equestrian)\n\nTop Hits of the 1956 Olympic Games 1Johnnie RayJust Walking In The Rain 2Frankie VaughanGreen Door 3Frankie LaineA Woman In Love 4Malcolm VaughanSt Therese Of The Roses 5Bill Haley & His CometsRip It Up 6PlattersMy Prayer 7Elvis PresleyHound Dog 8Jimmy YoungMore 9Eddie FisherCindy, Oh Cindy 10Elvis PresleyBlue Moon 11Bing Crosby & Grace KellyTrue Love &nbsp12Mitchell TorokWhen Mexico Gave Up The Rumba 13Winifred AtwellMake It A Party 14Ronnie HiltonTwo Different Worlds 15Guy MitchellSinging The Blues 16Bill Haley & His CometsRockin' Through The Rye 17Vera LynnA House With Love In It 18Nat 'King' ColeLove Me As Though There Were No Tomorrow 19Jim LoweThe Green Door 20Tony BrentCindy, Oh Cindy 21Dickie ValentineChristmas Island 22Elvis PresleyLove Me Tender 23Bill Haley & His CometsRock Around The Clock 24Glen MasonGreen Door 25Jimmy ParkinsonIn The Middle Of The House 26Melachrino OrchestraAutumn Concerto 27Elvis PresleyI Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine 28Pat BooneFriendly Persuasion 29Perry ComoMore 30Bill Haley & His CometsRudy's Rock 31Fats DominoBlueberry Hill 32PlattersThe Great Pretender / Only You 33Alma CoganIn The Middle Of The House 34Tommy SteeleRock With The Caveman 35Tommy SteeleSinging The Blues 36Vince MartinCindy, Oh Cindy 37Johnston BrothersIn The Middle Of The House 38Freddie Bell & The BellboysGiddy-Up-A-Ding-Dong 39Deep River BoysThat's Right 40Lonnie DoneganBring A Little Water Sylvie / Dead Or Alive\n\nTop of page\n\nRome, Italy, 1960\n\nDates of the XVII (17th) Olympiad: 25 Aug - 11 Sep\n\nOpened by: President Giovanni Gronchi\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Giancarlo Peris (athletics)\n\nParticipating countries: 83\n\nFifty-four years after Italy had to give up hosting the Olympics, Rome finally got its chance. They made the most of their dramatic history, holding the wrestling competition in the Basilica of Maxentius. Among the other ancient sites that were used were the Caracalla Baths (gymnastics) and the Arch of Constantine (finish of the marathon). Paul Elvstrom of Denmark won the gold medal in the single-handed dinghy class yachting - for the fourth consecutive time. Hungarian fencer Aladar Gerevich earned his sixth consecutive gold medal in the team sabre event. In canoeing, Swedens Gert Fredriksson won his sixth gold medal. Yugoslavia, which qualified for the final by winning a coin toss, won the football tournament after losing in the final three times in a row. Sante Gaiardoni of Italy became the only cyclist in Olympic history to win both the time trial and the match sprint events. By winning the silver medal in light-welterweight boxing, Clement \"Ike\" Quartey of Ghana became the first black African Olympic medalist. Five days later in the marathon, Abebe Bikila, running barefoot, outlasted Rhadi Ben Abdesselem of Morocco to become the first black African Olympic champion. Rafer Johnson and C.K. Yang were decathlon training partners at UCLA, but in Rome Johnson represented the United States and Yang represented Chinese Taipei. In a dramatic finish, they took first and second places and then, exhausted, fell against each other for support. Suffering from concussion and a broken collarbone after a fall in the endurance test of the three-day equestrian event, Bill Roycroft left his hospital bed to compete in the jumping test and ensure the gold medal for Australia. The USA and the USSR were as competitive as ever and it was the Soviets who topped the medals table with a total of 42 golds. American sprinter Wilma Rudolph caught the public imagination as she won three gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay. As one of 19 children she had suffered from polio. Ethiopia's emergence on to the long distance running scene was emphasised by Abebe Bikila winning the men's marathon - barefooted. Competition in the swimming events was of a particularly high standard with Olympic record broken in every event. Great Britain's Anita Lonsbrough prevented Australia and America from producing a clean-sweep of all 15 events.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 2\n\nMen's 50 km Walk (Don Thompson)\n\nWomen's 200 m Breastroke (Anita Lonsbrough)\n\nTop Hits of the 1960 Olympic Games 1ShadowsApache 2Elvis PresleyMess Of Blues 3Duane EddyBecause They're Young 4Cliff RichardPlease Don't Tease 5Everly BrothersWhen Will I Be Loved 6Connie FrancisEverybody's Somebody's Fool 7Ricky ValanceTell Laura I Love Her 8Johnny Kidd & The PiratesShaking All Over 9Shirley BasseyAs Long As He Needs Me 10Kaye SistersPaper Roses 11Ken DoddLove Is Like A Violin &nbsp12Roy OrbisonOnly The Lonely 13Anthony NewleyIf She Should Come To You 14Brenda LeeI'm Sorry 15Lonnie DoneganLorelei 16Rolf HarrisTie Me Kangaroo Down Sport 17Mark WynterImage Of A Girl 18Hank LocklinPlease Help Me I'm Falling 19Johnny PrestonFeel So Fine 20Brian HylandItsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 21Jimmy JonesGood Timin' 22Gary MillsLook For A Star 23King BrothersMais Oui 24Connie FrancisMama / Robot Man 25Mike PrestonI'd Do Anything 26Hollywood ArgylesAlley Oop 27Fats DominoWalking To New Orleans 28Percy FaithTheme From 'A Summer Place' 29Jim ReevesHe'll Have To Go 30Acker BilkWhite Cliffs Of Dover 31VenturesWalk Don't Run 32Frank SinatraNice 'N' Easy 33Lonnie DoneganI Wanna Go Home 34Bobby RydellVolare 35Adam FaithWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home 36Adam FaithHow About That 37Bob LumanLet's Think About Living 38Tommy BruceAin't Misbehavin' 39Wanda JacksonLet's Have A Party 40Emile Ford & The CheckmatesThem There Eyes\n\nTop of page\n\nTokyo, Japan, 1964\n\nDates of the XVIII (18th) Olympiad: 10 Oct - 24 Oct\n\nOpened by: The Emperor Hirohito\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Yoshinori Sakaï, a student born on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima\n\nParticipating countries: 93\n\nThe 1964 Tokyo Games were the first to be held in Asia. The Japanese expressed their successful reconstruction after World War II by choosing as the final torchbearer Yoshinori Sakai, who was born in Hiroshima the day that that city was destroyed by an atomic bomb. Judo and volleyball were introduced to the Olympic programme. American swimmer Don Schollander won four gold medals. Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia became the first repeat winner of the marathon - less than six weeks after having his appendix removed - this time wearing shoes. Russian rower Vyacheslav Ivanov won the single sculls for the third time, and Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser won the 100m freestyle for the third time. Al Oerter of the United States did the same in the discus throw despite a cervical disc injury that forced him to wear a neck harness and torn rib cartilage incurred a week before the competition. Hungarian water polo player Dezso Gyarmati won his fifth medal in a row. Another Hungarian, Greco-Roman wrestler Imre Polyak, finally won a gold medal after finishing second in the same division at the previous three Olympics. By winning two medals of each kind, Larysa Latynina of the Ukraine brought her career medal total to an incredible 18. She is also one of only four athletes in any sport to win nine gold medals. The most successful athlete at the Games was American swimmer Don Schollander with four gold medals, while Soviet gymnast Larissa Latynina celebrated her final Olympic appearance with two more golds and six medals in total.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 4\n\nMen's 20 km Walk (Kenneth Matthews)\n\nMen's Long Jump (Lynn Davies)\n\nWomen's 800 m (Ann Packer)\n\nWomen's Long Jump (Mary Rand)\n\nTop Hits of the 1964 Olympic Games 1Roy OrbisonOh Pretty Woman 2Sandie Shaw(There's) Always Something There To Remind Me 3SupremesWhere Did Our Love Go 4Herman's HermitsI'm Into Something Good 5Julie RogersThe Wedding 6SearchersWhen You Walk In The Room 7Matt MonroWalk Away 8HolliesWe're Through 9Four SeasonsRag Doll 10BachelorsI Wouldn't Trade You For The World 11AnimalsI'm Crying &nbsp12Cliff RichardTwelfth Of Never 13Henry Mancini OrchestraHow Soon? 14Jim ReevesI Won't Forget You 15Cliff Bennett & The Rebel RousersOne Way Love 16Dean MartinEverybody Loves Somebody 17PJ ProbyTogether 18Marianne FaithfullAs Tears Go By 19Manfred MannSha La La 20Lesley GoreMaybe I Know 21Wayne Fontana & The MindbendersUm Um Um Um Um Um 22NewbeatsBread And Butter 23SupremesBaby Love 24Dionne WarwickReach Out For Me 25Shirley BasseyGoldfinger 26Brenda LeeIs It True? 27HoneycombsHave I The Right? 28Frank IfieldSummer Is Over 29ApplejacksThree Little Words 30Rockin' BerriesHe's In Town 31KinksYou Really Got Me 32Shangri-LasRemember (Walkin' In The Sand) 33Jim ReevesI Love You Because 34Dave BerryThe Crying Game 35Nashville TeensGoogle Eye 36Dave Clark FiveAnyway You Want It 37Val DoonicanWalk Tall 38Dusty SpringfieldLosing You 39HoneycombsIs It Because? 40ZombiesShe's Not There\n\nTop of page\n\nMexico City, Mexico, 1968\n\nDates of the XIX (19th) Olympiad: 12 Oct - 27 Oct\n\nOpened by: President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Norma Enriqueta Basilio de Sotelo (athletics)\n\nParticipating countries: 112\n\nThe choice of Mexico City to host the 1968 Olympics was a controversial one because of the city's high altitude, 2,300m, which meant that the air contained 30% less oxygen than at sea level. Sure enough, the rarefied air proved disastrous to many athletes competing in endurance events. On the other hand, the high altitude led to world records in all of the mens races that were 400m or shorter, including both relays, and in the 400m hurdles, in the long jump and triple jump as well. Bob Beamons spectacular long jump of 8.90m would last as a world record for 22 years. The Mexico City Olympics, the first Summer Games to include sex testing for women, were blessed with many outstanding heroines. Mexican hurdler Enriqueta Basilio became the first woman to light the cauldron at the Opening Ceremony. Eulalia Rolinska of Poland, Gladys de Seminario of Peru and Nuria Ortiz of Mexico were the first women to compete in shooting. Wyomia Tyus of the United States became the first repeat winner of the 100m dash. The most popular female athlete of the 1968 Games was Vera Caslavska, the Czech gymnast. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia two months before the Olympics, Caslavska went into hiding for three weeks. She emerged to win four gold medals and two silvers. On the male side, Al Oerter of the United States won the discus throw for the fourth time. American high jumper Dick Fosbury won gold with his 'flop' style that was to revolutionise the event and replace the conventional straddle technique. The 1968 Games also saw the first drug disqualification, as a Swedish entrant in the modern pentathlon, Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, tested positive for excessive alcohol.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 400 m Hurdles (David Hemery)\n\nMiddleweight (71-75 kg) (Christopher Finnegan)\n\nTrap (shooting) (John Braithwaite)\n\nFlying Dutchman (sailing)\n\nTeam Three-Day Event (equestrian)\n\nTop Hits of the 1968 Olympic Games 1Mary HopkinThose Were The Days 2Joe CockerWith A Little Help From My Friends 3BeatlesHey Jude 4CasualsJesamine 5Leapy LeeLittle Arrows 6Hugh MontenegroThe Good, The Bad And The Ugly 7Engelbert HumperdinckLes Bicyclettes De Belsize 8Jose FelicianoLight My Fire 9MarblesOnly One Woman 10TremeloesMy Little Lady 11Love AffairA Day Without Love &nbsp12Union GapLady Willpower 13HolliesListen To Me 14Dave Clark FiveRed Balloon 15Mason WilliamsClassical Gas 16Barry RyanEloise 17Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & TichWreck Of The Antionette 18Isley BrothersThis Old Heart Of Mine 19Johnny NashHold Me Tight 20Status QuoIce In The Sun 21BandwagonBreaking Down The Walls Of Heartache 22Jimi Hendrix ExperienceAll Along The Watchtower 23DoorsHello I Love You 24Marvin Gaye & Tammi TerrellYou're All I Need To Get By 25Bee GeesI've Gotta Get A Message To You 26Cliff RichardMarianne 27Long John BaldryMexico 28BandThe Weight 29CreamSunshine Of Your Love 30Aretha FranklinI Say A Little Prayer 31Tom JonesHelp Yourself 32Jeannie C RileyHarper Valley PTA 33Billie DavisI Want You To Be My Baby 34LocomotiveRudi's In Love 35MarmaladeWait For Me Mary-Anne 36Beach BoysDo It Again 37Sly & The Family StoneM'Lady 38Mama CassDream A Little Dream Of Me 39Cupid's InspirationMy World 40WhoMagic Bus\n\nTop of page\n\nMunich, Germany, 1972\n\nDates of the XX (20th) Olympiad: 26 Aug - 11 Sep\n\nOpened by: President Gustave Heinemann\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Günter Zahn (athletics, junior 1 500m champion)\n\nParticipating countries: 121\n\nThe first Olympic mascot: Waldi the dachshund\n\nThe 1972 Munich Games were the largest yet, setting records in all categories, with 195 events and 7,173 athletes from 121 nations. They were supposed to celebrate peace and, for the first ten days, all did indeed go well. But in the early morning of 5 September, eight Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic Village, killed two members of the Israeli team and took nine more hostage. In an ensuing battle, all nine Israeli hostages were killed, as were five of the terrorists and one policeman. The Olympics were suspended and a memorial service was held in the main stadium. In defiance of the terrorists, the International Olympic Committee ordered the competitions to resume after a pause of 34 hours. All other details about the Munich Games paled in significance, but it did have its highlights. Archery was reintroduced to the Olympic programme after a 52-year absence and handball after a 36-year absence. Whitewater (or slalom) canoeing was included for the first time. The 1972 Games were also the first to have a named mascot: Waldi the dachshund. U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz won an incredible seven gold medals to go with the two he had earned in 1968. Lasse Viren of Finland fell midway through the 10,000m final, but rose and set a world record to win the first of his four career gold medals. Freestyle wrestler Ivan Yarygin of Russia pinned all seven of his opponents en route to his first Olympic championship in the heavyweight division. West German, Liselott Linsenhoff, competing in the dressage event, became the first female equestrian to win a gold medal in an individual event. The media star of the Munich Games was the tiny Soviet gymnast, Olga Korbut, whose dramatic cycle of success in the team competition, failure in the individual competition and renewed success in the apparatus finals captured the attention of fans worldwide.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 4\n\nWomen's Pentathlon (Mary Peters)\n\nIndividual Three-Day Event (Richard Meade)\n\nFlying Dutchman (sailing)\n\nTeam Three-Day Event (equestrian)\n\nTop Hits of the 1972 Olympic Games 1SladeMama Weer All Crazee Now 2Rod StewartYou Wear It Well 3Faron YoungIt's Four In The Morning 4Mott The HoopleAll The Young Dudes 5Lynsey De PaulSugar Me 6Blackfoot SueStanding In The Road 7Roxy MusicVirginia Plain 8HawkwindSilver Machine 9Alice CooperSchool's Out 10Derek & The DominoesLayla 11T RexChildren Of The Revolution &nbsp12Jackie WilsonI Get The Sweetest Feeling 13Michael JacksonAin't No Sunshine 14David CassidyHow Can I Be Sure 15Hot ButterPopcorn 16Little EvaThe Loco-motion 17Cliff RichardLiving In Harmony 18Bee GeesRun To Me 19Terry Dactyl & The DinosaursSeaside Shuffle 20DriftersCome On Over To My Place 21Bill WithersLean On Me 22Partridge FamilyBreaking Up Is Hard To Do 23Junior Walker & The All-StarsWalk In The Night 24Donny OsmondPuppy Love 25Mardi GrasToo Busy Thinking About My Baby 26Donny OsmondToo Young 27Electric Light Orchestra10538 Overture 28Judge DreadBig Six 29Johnny NashI Can See Clearly Now 30Duncan BrowneJourney 31Dandy LivingstoneSuzanne Beware Of The Devil 32SweetWig-Wam Bam 33Procol HarumConquistador 34Royal Scots Dragoon Guards BandHeykens Serenade / The Day Is Ended 35Hurricane SmithWho Was It 36New SeekersCircles 37Lieutenant PigeonMouldy Old Dough 38Gary GlitterRock And Roll Parts 1 & 2 39Elton JohnHonky Cat 40HolliesLong Cool Woman In A Black Dress\n\nTop of page\n\nMontreal, Canada, 1976\n\nDates of the XXI (21st) Olympiad: 17 Jul - 1 Aug\n\nOpened by: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Stéphane Préfontaine and Sandra Henderson (two athletes aged 16 and 15).\n\nParticipating countries: 92\n\nMascot: Amik the beaver\n\nThe 1976 Montreal Games were marred by an African boycott to protest the fact that the national rugby team of New Zealand had toured South Africa and New Zealand was scheduled to compete in the Olympics. Womens events were included for the first time in basketball, rowing and team handball. Olga Korbut found herself upstaged in gymnastics by fourteen-year-old gymnast Nadia Comaneci of Romania. She caused a sensation when, for her performance on the uneven bars, she was awarded the first-ever perfect score of 10.0. She eventually earned seven 10.0s. On the mens side, Japans Shun Fujimoto broke his leg while completing his floor exercises routine. The Japanese team was engaged in a close contest with the Soviet Union, so Fujimoto kept his injury secret. But when he dismounted from the rings, he dislocated his knee and was forced to withdraw. The Japanese womens volleyball team won all their matches in straight sets, and in only one of fifteen games did an opponent score in double figures. Individual stars included Klaus Dibiasi of Italy, who won his third straight gold medal in platform diving; Viktor Saneyev of Soviet Georgia, who won his third triple jump gold; and Irena Szewinska of Poland, winner of the 400m run, who brought her career total to seven medals - in five different events. Alberto Juantorena of Cuba put together the first 40m-800m double victory. Miklos Németh of Hungary won the javelin throw to become the first son of an athletics gold medalist to win a gold of his own. His father, Imre, had won the hammer throw in 1948. The United States and East Germany dominated the swimming events with Britain's David Wilkie one of only two competitors to break their domination. Wilkie won the 200m breaststroke in a new world record. Clarence Hill of Bermuda earned a bronze medal in boxings super-heavyweight division to give Bermuda the honor of being the least populous nation (53,500) ever to win a medal in the Summer Olympics.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 3\n\nMen's 200 m Breastroke (David Wilkie)\n\nModern Pentathlon team\n\nTornado (sailing)\n\nTop Hits of the 1976 Olympic Games 1Elton John & Kiki DeeDon't Go Breaking My Heart 2Dr HookA Little Bit More 3Demis RoussosThe Roussos Phenomenon 4David DundasJeans On 5TavaresHeaven Must Be Missing An Angel 6ManhattansKiss And Say Goodbye 7Dorothy MooreMisty Blue 8Candi StatonYoung Hearts Run Free 9Jimmy James & The VagabondsNow Is The Time 10100 Ton & A FeatherIt Only Takes A Minute 11QueenYou're My Best Friend &nbsp12Liverpool ExpressYou Are My Love 13Isley BrothersHarvest For The World 14Johnny WakelinIn Zaire 15Status QuoMystery Song 16Real ThingYou To Me Are Everything 175000 VoltsDr Kiss Kiss 18Hot ChocolateMan To Man 19Bryan FerryLet's Stick Together 20Sensational Alex Harvey BandThe Boston Tea Party 21BeatlesBack In The USSR 22Billy OceanLove On Delivery 23Don WilliamsI Recall A Gypsy Woman 24Bee GeesYou Should Be Dancing 25T RexI Love To Boogie 26Our KidYou Just Might See Me Cry 27Shangri-LasLeader Of The Pack 28KC & The Sunshine Band(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty 29Billy ConnollyNo Chance (No Charge) 30WingsLet 'Em In 31Billie Jo SpearsWhat I've Got In Mind 32Walter MurphyA Fifth Of Beethoven 33Steve Harley & Cockney RebelHere Comes The Sun 34Beach BoysGood Vibrations 35WarMe And Baby Brother 36Rod StewartTonight's The Night 37Bryan FerryExtended Play 38Chi-LitesYou Don't Have To Go 39Lou RawlsYou'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine 40Diana RossI Thought It Took A Little Time\n\nTop of page\n\nMoscow, USSR, 1980\n\nDates of the XXII (22nd) Olympiad: 19 Jul - 3 Aug\n\nOpened by: President Leonid Brezhnev\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Sergei Belov (basketball).\n\nParticipating countries: 80\n\nMascot: Misha the bear\n\nA U.S.-led boycott reduced the number of participating nations to 80, the lowest number since 1956. Aleksandr Dityatin earned medals in every men's gymnastics event to become the only athlete ever to win eight medals in one Olympics. Super-heavyweight Teófilo Stevenson became the first boxer to win the same division three times. Gerd Wessig became the first male high jumper to break the world record at the Olympics and swimmer Vladimir Salnikov broke the 15-minute barrier for the 1,500m. The men's 100m saw a very close finish between Great Britain's Alan Wells and Silvio Leonard of Cuba, with Wells taking the gold. Britain had two other Gold successes in men's track events; Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe clashed over both 800 and 1500 metres, with Ovett winning at Coe's favoured 800m and Coe winning at the longer distance. In the pool Britain's Duncan Goodhew won the 100m breaststroke gold, repeating the 200m success of David Wilkie four years earlier.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 100 m (Allan Wells)\n\nMen's 800 m (Steve Ovett)\n\nMen's 1,500 m (Sebastian Coe)\n\nMen's Decathlon (Daley Thompson)\n\nMen's 100 m Breastroke (Duncan Goodhew)\n\nTop Hits of the 1980 Olympic Games 1OdysseyUse It Up And Wear It Out 2AbbaThe Winner Takes It All 3Diana RossUpside Down 4Leo SayerMore Than I Can Say 5Olivia Newton-John & Electric Light OrchestraXanadu 6Kate BushBabooshka 7Bob Marley & The WailersCould You Be Loved 8Sheena Easton9 To 5 9Gap BandOops Upside Your Head 10Stacy LattisawJump To The Beat 11Dexy's Midnight RunnersThere There My Dear &nbsp12Detroit SpinnersCupid - I've Loved You For A Long Time 13Roxy MusicOh Yeah (On The Radio) 14DartsLet's Hang On 15George BensonGive Me The Night 16UndertonesWednesday Week 17Bad MannersLip Up Fatty 18Rolling StonesEmotional Rescue 19Gibson BrothersMariana 20Tom BrowneFunkin' For Jamaica (NY) 21UB40My Way Of Thinking / I Think It's Going To Rain 22Joy DivisionLove Will Tear Us Apart 23David BowieAshes To Ashes 24Hot ChocolateAre You Getting Enough Of What Makes You Happy 25ChangeA Lover's Holiday / Glow Of Love 26Yellow Magic OrchestraComputer Game (Theme From 'The Invaders') 27Joan ArmatradingMe Myself I 28Black SabbathNeon Knights 29PiranhasTom Hark 30Gene ChandlerDoes She Have A Friend 31Paul McCartneyWaterfalls 32Grace JonesPrivate Life 33Electric Light OrchestraAll Over The World 34New MusikSanctuary 35Kelly MarieFeels Like I'm In Love 36UltravoxSleepwalk 37Saxon747 (Strangers In The Night) 38WhispersMy Girl 39Mike BerryThe Sunshine Of Your Smile 40John FoxxBurning Car\n\nTop of page\n\nLos Angeles, USA, 1984\n\nDates of the XXIII (23rd) Olympiad: 28 Jul - 12 Aug\n\nOpened by: President Ronald Reagan\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Rafer Johnson (decathlete).\n\nParticipating countries: 140\n\nMascot: Sam the eagle\n\nAlthough a revenge boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, a record 140 nations took part. With television rights fetching vast sums, some critics felt that the Games, once a festival for amateur sport, had become over commercialised. Joan Benoit won the inaugural women's marathon and Connie Carpenter-Phinney the first women's cycling road race. Carl Lewis won both sprints and the long jump and earned a fourth gold in the 4x100m relay. Pertti Karppinen won single sculls rowing for the third time. Sebastian Coe became the first repeat winner of the men's 1,500m. Britain's Sebastian Coe and Daley Thompson both successfully defended their 1500m and decathlon titles while in Gymnastics, Romanian Ecaterina Szabo won four golds and a silver medal. Women's synchronized swimming was among the new events while a change to the Olympic charter allowed professional players to be eligible for the football competition. Archer Neroli Fairhall was the first paraplegic athlete to take part in a medal event. She competed in a wheelchair.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 1,500m (Sebastian Coe)\n\nMen's Decathlon (Daley Thompson)\n\nWomen's Javelin (Tessa Sanderson)\n\nMen's Three Positions Rifle (Malcolm Cooper)\n\nMen's Coxed Fours\n\nTop Hits of the 1984 Olympic Games 1George MichaelCareless Whisper 2Frankie Goes To HollywoodTwo Tribes 3Black LaceAgadoo 4Tina TurnerWhat's Love Got To Do With It 5Frankie Goes To HollywoodRelax 6NeilHole In My Shoe 7PrinceWhen Doves Cry 8Hazell DeanWhatever I Do (Wherever I Go) 9Grandmaster Flash & Melle MelWhite Lines (Don't Do It) 10Laura BraniganSelf Control 11QueenIt's A Hard Life &nbsp12Howard JonesLike To Get To Know You Well 13Jeffrey OsborneOn The Wings Of Love 14Phil Fearon & GalaxyEverybody's Laughing 15ShakatakDown On The Street 16Kane GangClosest Thing To Heaven 17Cyndi LauperTime After Time 18Trevor WaltersStuck On You 19BluebellsYoung At Heart 20Stevie WonderI Just Called To Say I Love You 21WindjammerTossing And Turning 22DivineYou Think You're A Man 23Billy IdolEyes Without A Face 24Tracey UllmanSunglasses 25Rod StewartSome Guys Have All The Luck 26Alison MoyetLove Resurrection 27BlancmangeThe Day Before You Came 28Nik KershawI Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me 29Iron Maiden2 Minutes To Midnight 30Band Of GoldLove Songs Are Back Again (Medley) 31Pointer SistersJump (For My Love) 32Elton JohnPassengers 33Miami Sound MachineDr Beat 34Mighty Wah!Come Back 35Lionel RichieStuck On You 36A Flock Of SeagullsThe More You Live The More You Love 37Tears For FearsMother's Talk 38SOS BandJust The Way You Like It 39AC / DCNervous Shakedown 40Thompson TwinsSister Of Mercy\n\nTop of page\n\nSeoul, Korea, 1988\n\nDates of the XXIV (24th) Olympiad: 17 Sep - 2 Oct\n\nOpened by: President Roh Tae-woo\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Chong Son-man, Kim Won-tak, Son Mi-jong (athletics).\n\nParticipating countries: 159\n\nMascot: Hodori the tiger\n\nDrugs scandals were to overshadow the competition, in particular the athletics blue riband event, the men's 100m. Canadian Ben Johnson recorded a new world best of 9.79 secs and he stormed away from his arch-rival Carl Lewis. However, three days later it was revealed that Johnson had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and was disqualified. Lewis took the gold while Johnson was banned from representing Canada again, although that was later reduced to two years. On a positive note, the Seoul Games were highlighted by numerous exceptional performances. Christa Luding-Rothenburger, who was also a speed skater, earned a silver medal in cycling to become the only person in history to win Winter and Summer medals in the same year. Florence Griffith-Joyner was the outstanding athlete at the Games, winning three golds and a silver, while also setting a new world record in the 200m. Tennis regained its Olympic status after a 64 year absence with Steffi Graf beating Gabriela Sabatini in the women's final and Miloslav Mecir crowned as the men's champion. Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals in 1972 came under threat in the swimming events. East German Kristin Otto won six golds, while American Matt Biondi won five golds, a silver and a bronze. Greg Louganis repeated victories in both diving events. Florence Griffith-Joyner dominated the sprints. For the first time, all the medalists in dressage were women.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 100 m Breastroke (Adrian Moorhouse)\n\nMen's Three Positions Rifle (Malcolm Cooper)\n\nMen's Coxless Pairs\n\nStar (sailing)\n\nMen's Field Hockey\n\nTop Hits of the 1988 Olympic Games 1HolliesHe Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother 2U2Desire 3Phil CollinsGroovy Kind Of Love 4Whitney HoustonOne Moment In Time 5Womack & WomackTeardrops 6Jason DonovanNothing Can Divide Us 7Bill WithersLovely Day 8Rick AstleyShe Wants To Dance With Me 9Pet Shop BoysDomino Dancing 10Inner City featuring Kevin SaundersonBig Fun 11Bobby McFerrinDon't Worry Be Happy &nbsp12YelloThe Race 13PasadenasRiding On A Train 14ProclaimersI'm Gonna Be 15BrosI Quit 16ErasureA Little Respect 17Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound MachineAnything For You 18Yazz & The Plastic PopulationThe Only Way Is Up 19Bon JoviBad Medicine 20Wee Papa Girl RappersWee Rule 21Alexander O'NealFake '88 22Duran DuranI Don't Want Your Love 23CommodoresEasy 24Bomb The BassMegablast / Don't Make Me Wait 25Brother BeyondThe Harder I Try 26Hazell DeanTurn It Into Love 27Salt-N-Pepa featuring EUShake Your Thang (It's Your Thing) 28BananaramaLove Truth And Honesty 29Jane WiedlinRush Hour 30T'PauSecret Garden 31Coldcut featuring Junior ReidStop This Crazy Thing 32Michael JacksonAnother Part Of Me 33Kim WildeNever Trust A Stranger 34SinittaI Don't Believe In Miracles 35Beatmasters With PP ArnoldBurn It Up 36Transvision VampRevolution Baby 37Marc AlmondTears Run Rings 38Julio IglesiasMy Love 39BreatheHands To Heaven 40Kylie MinogueThe Loco-Motion\n\nTop of page\n\nBarcelona, Spain, 1992\n\nDates of the XXV (25th) Olympiad: 25 Jul - 9 Aug\n\nOpened by: His Majesty King Juan Carlos I\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Antonio Rebollo (paralympic archer).\n\nParticipating countries: 169\n\nMascot: Cobi the dog\n\nThe 1992 Games went down as one of the best Olympiads ever, and for once not one single nation boycotted the Olympics. South Africa were welcomed back on to the international stage while Germany competed as one nation again. Even Afghanistan joined the opening ceremony despite not having any athletes participating in the Games. Certainly the opening ceremony was spectacular and richly entertained a world-wide television audience estimated at two billion. Men's basketball was open to all professionals, and the US sent a \"Dream Team\" that included Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. The most successful competitor in Barcelona was gymnast Vitali Sherbo from the Unified Team who picked up six gold medals. Britain had reason to celebrate with Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell striking gold in the 100m and 400m hurdles respectively. Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia won the 10,000m run to become the first female black African Olympic champion. Her victory lap with silver medallist Elana Meyer, a white South African, symbolised hope for the future of the Olympic Movement.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 5\n\nMen's 100 m (Linford Christie)\n\nWomen's 400 m Hurdles (Sally Gunnell)\n\nMen's 4,000 m Individual Pursuit (cycling) (Christopher Boardman)\n\nMen's Coxless Pairs\n\nMen's Coxed Pairs\n\nTop of page\n\nAtlanta, USA, 1996\n\nDates of the XXVI (26th) Olympiad: 19 Jul - 4 Aug\n\nOpened by: President Bill Clinton\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Muhammad Ali (boxing).\n\nParticipating countries: 197\n\nMascot: Izzy (after \"what is he?\")\n\nThe 1996 Games were given a dramatic start when the cauldron was lit by Muhammad Ali. On 27 July during a concert held in the Centennial Olympic Park, a terrorist bomb killed one person and injured a further 110 people, but the Atlanta Games are best remembered for their sporting achievements. A record-setting 79 nations won medals and 53 won gold. Carl Lewis became only the third person to win the same individual event four times and the fourth person to earn a ninth gold medal. Naim Suleymanoglu became the first weightlifter to win a third gold medal. Michael Johnson smashed the 200m world record to complete a 200m and 400m double. Carl Lewis picked up his ninth Olympic gold, spread over four Games by winning the long jump. Britain's Steve Redgrave won his fourth gold in successive Games and led to him being hailed by many as Britain's greatest ever Olympian. But defending 100m champion Linford Christie was disqualified after two false starts leaving Canada's Donovan Bailey to take his crown in a new world record of 9.84 seconds.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 1\n\nMen's Coxless Pairs\n\nTop Hits of the 1996 Olympic Games 1Spice GirlsWannabe 2FugeesKilling Me Softly 3Los Del RioMacarena 4Peter Andre featuring Bubbler RanxMysterious Girl 5UnderworldBorn Slippy 6Robbie WilliamsFreedom 7WinkHigher State Of Conciousness 96 Remixed 8Gary BarlowForever Love 9DodgyGood Enough 10Mark MorrisonCrazy 11OMCHow Bizarre &nbsp12Livin' JoyDon't Stop Movin' 13SuedeTrash 14Neneh CherryWoman 15Baddiel / Skinner / Lightning SeedsThree Lions 16Manic Street PreachersEverything Must Go 17Alanis MorissetteHead Over Feet 18Toni BraxtonYou're Makin Me High 19Celine DionBecause You Loved Me 20Bone Thugs-N-HarmonyTha Crossroads 21Alisha's AtticI Am, I Feel 22EternalSomeday 23Adam Clayton & Larry MullenTheme From Mission: Impossible 24Paul WellerPeacock Suit 25Tina TurnerMissing You 26Pato Banton / Reggae RevolutionGroovin' 27East 17Someone To Love 28Sean MaguireDon't Pull Your Love 29UmbozaSunshine 30Apollo 440Krupa 31Todd Terry featuring Martha Wash & Jocelyn BrownKeep On Jumpin' 32Tori AmosHey Jupiter / Professional Widow 33Tina ArenaSorrento Moon (I Remember) 34NasIf I Ruled The World 35Tony Rich ProjectNobody Knows 362Pac featuring K-Ci & JojoHow Do U Want It 37Mariah CareyAlways Be My Baby 38Ocean Colour SceneThe Day We Caught The Train 39Sex PistolsPretty Vacant (Live) 40New EditionHit Me Off\n\nTop of page\n\nSydney, Australia, 2000\n\nDates of the XXVII (27th) Olympiad: 15 Sep - 1 Oct\n\nOpened by: Sir William Deane, Governor General of Australia\n\nOlympic flame lit by: Cathy Freeman (athletics).\n\nParticipating countries: 199\n\nMascots: Olly the kookaburra, Syd the platypus & Millie the echidna\n\nThe Sydney 2000 Games were the largest yet, with 10,651 athletes competing in 300 events. Despite their size, they were well organised, renewing faith in the Olympic Movement. Home favourite Cathy Freeman was the star of a spectacular opening ceremony which celebrated the Olympian ideal and Aussie culture. She then became the first Aboriginal to win track gold - to the delight of a rapturous capacity crowd. Britain's Steve Redgrave confirmed his place in the Olympic Hall of Fame with a fifth straight rowing gold medal - one of 11 British golds in Sydney. Maurice Greene cemented his reputation as the world's fastest man with victory in the 100m, while fellow American Michael Johnson became the first man to successfully defend the Olympic 400m crown. American runner Marion Jones became the first woman to win five medals in athletics at one Olympics. The swimming competition was dominated by 17-year-old Australian Ian Thorpe, who won broke his own world record to claim gold in the 400m freestyle. He then went on to win another two gold and two silver medals. However, the most prolific medal winner at Sydney was gymnast Alexei Nemov who took six medals back to Russia with him, equalling his Atlanta tally four years ago. Elsewhere, swimmer Eric 'The Eel' Moussambani became a worldwide superstar. The 22-year-old from Equatorial Guinea, who had only been swimming for just over six months, huffed and puffed his way to winning his 100m freestyle heat and the hearts of all those around him. His triumph was made possible due when the two other swimmers in his heat were eliminated for false starts. Moussambani set a landmark all his own - by actually managing to complete the distance. Birgit Fischer earned two gold medals in Kayak to become the first woman in any sport to win medals 20 years apart. Judoka Ryoko Tamura lost in the final in both Barcelona and Atlanta, but came back to win the gold medal in Sydney. The US softball team won in stirring fashion, losing three games in a row and then coming back to defeat each of the teams they had lost to.\n\nBritish Gold Medals: 11\n\nMen's Triple Jump (Jonathan Edwards)\n\nWomen's Heptathlon (Denise Lewis)\n\nSuper-Heavyweight (+91 kg) (Audley Harrison)\n\nWomen's Modern Pentathlon (Stephanie Cook)\n\nMen's Finn (sailing) (Ian Percy)\n\nWomen's Europe (sailing) (Shirley Robertson)\n\nLaser (sailing) (Ben Ainslie)\n\nMen's 1,000 m Time Trial (cycling) (Jason Queally)\n\nMen's Double Trap (shooting) (Richard Faulds)\n\nMen's Coxless Fours (rowing)"
