The U.K. equestrian team earned bronze in dressage.\n\nStewart said she has reserved a stall for Snoop at her stable when he's ready to get a horse.

Both Nemour and Khelif have dealt with obstacles outside the field of play on their journeys to the Olympic podium.\n\nNemour previously represented France but obtained Algerian citizenship through her paternal ancestry after her home federation tried to bar her from competing.

Medal matches, including the final, are expected to take place Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. and Spain have been the gold medal favorites, and a possible matchup in the final would reprise the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where the Americans took gold.\n\nSpain beat the women's team in early pool play in Paris 13-11, but the U.S. team, hoping for an unprecedented fourth consecutive gold medal in Olympics water polo, men's or women's, has a greater goal differential — 26 compared to Spain's 15.\n\n'Amazing to be on the Olympic stage,’ Scheffler tells Tirico\n\nScottie Scheffler joined Mike Tirico to talk about winning gold in the Olympic men’s golf event and what it’s like to compete in the Games.\n\nMen's vault highlights: Carlos Yulo golden again after epic performance\n\nJust one day after winning an historic gold medal for the Philippines on the floor exercise, Carlos Yulo picked up a second gold medal on the vault.\n\nBobby Finke, U.S. women’s relay team set world records to end Olympic swimming\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nNANTERRE, France — Bobby Finke and the U.S. women set world records in the 1,500-meter freestyle and the 4x100-meter medley today, adding final touches of glory for Americans, who suffered a relative collapse in the gold market but still took home the most medals from this quadrennial swim meet.\n\nThe U.S. made 28 visits to the Paris La Défense Arena podium, but Americans were on the top step only eight times.\n\nWhile both numbers were more than any other country's, it was a slight step back by supremely high U.S. standards.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFaulkner stuns in gold medal win in women’s road race\n\nU.S. cyclist Kristen Faulkner surprised everyone when she won the women’s road race with a time of 3:49:23.

Chloé Dygert’s crash affected the race.\n\nYesterday marked a historic haul of medals for the U.S.\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nTeam USA picked up 18 medals yesterday — five gold, six silver, seven bronze —the most for the U.S. in a single day since Oct. 1, 1988, at the Seoul Games, when the U.S. also won 18.\n\nEntering these Games, only five athletes in Olympic history had ever won four gold medals in the same individual event. Yesterday, two American athletes joined that list in a matter of hours.\n\nVincent Hancock became the sixth athlete to complete the feat, winning his fourth gold medal in shooting’s men’s skeet. Later, swimmer Katie Ledecky won her fourth gold medal in the women's 800-meter freestyle.\n\nTune in to prime-time coverage\n\nFull prime-time coverage begins tonight on NBC and Peacock at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nSee the photo finish of the men's 100 meters\n\nNoah Lyles won the men's 100 meters by five-thousandths of a second over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson — Lyles' torso crossing the line first.\n\nHere's the photo finish.\n\nLyles was last at 40m, says 'reaction time does not win races'\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nAccording to official race data, Noah Lyles had the worst reaction time of the men’s 100-meter final, as he was in last place for the first 40 meters and still in seventh at the halfway point.\n\nIn fact, he never led the race until the final few steps, pipping by the smallest of margins Kishane Thompson, who was winning for much of the sprint, according to the data.\n\n“Oh shhh ...!” Lyles exclaimed, just stopping himself short, when reporters told him about his improbable midrace comeback.\n\n“Slowest reaction time? Dang, I’m amazing. That’s crazy! That’s crazy! That just goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.”\n\nLyles: I thought Thompson had beaten me\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nTeam USA’s Noah Lyles said he thought Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson had won the 100-meter final when the pair crossed the line five-thousandths of a second apart.\n\n“I did think Thompson had it at the end,” Lyle told a scrum of reporters. “I went up to him afterward, while we were waiting. I even said, ‘Bro I think you got that one, big dog.’ And and then my name popped up and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m amazing!’” he added with a laugh.\n\nWhen his name did show up on the giant screen in the stadium, Lyles said, it came as a rare surprise for a man never short of self-confidence.\n\n“I’m going to be honest, I wasn’t ready to see it,” he said. “And that’s the first time I’ve ever said that in my head that I wasn’t ready to see it.”\n\nThompson “was a few quite a few lanes over — he’s in lane four, I was in lane seven — so it was hard for me to picture where we were. But I guess that was a good thing.”\n\nBad luck for American Kenny Bednarek\n\nCrazy but true: Kenny Bednarek’s time of 9.88 in the 100-meter sprint would have earned him a medal at the Rio or Tokyo Games.\n\nIn Paris, he ended up in seventh.\n\nKishane Thompson says 100m final was his 'closest race ever'\n\nand\n\nAfter losing the 100-meter gold to Noah Lyles by five-thousandths of a second, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson said Lyles went up to him after the race and said he thought that Thompson had won it.\n\nThompson, on the other hand, didn't have a clue until the results were officially announced.\n\n\"I couldn't see him. ... He was to my far right, so I wasn’t sure,\" Thompson told reporters. \"My closest race ever.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought runners should share the gold medal, Thompson quickly dismissed the idea, asserting that the sport was too competitive for such a thing.\n\nThompson, 23, had run faster times than Lyles this season, including in the Olympic heats leading up to the final. He said he would've loved to win the gold but still felt \"super grateful\" for the silver at his first Olympics.\n\nLyles: 'I was always the fastest man in the world'\n\nand\n\nAfter fulfilling part one of his Olympic destiny, Noah Lyles said that for him, there was never any doubt.\n\n\"I was always the fastest man in the world,\" he said after his 100-meter win. \"Now I just got the medals to prove it.\"\n\nAsked whether he has ever run like that before, he said he has \"had many races like that, but never at the Olympics.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you that, that was an amazing moment, but it was tight, and it was great,\" he said.\n\nOverhead shot of Noah Lyles' win\n\nNoah Lyles claimed the 100 meters in one of the tightest finishes in history. Here's an overhead shot of the finish.\n\nWhat's next for Noah Lyles? The double looms large\n\nLyles could be the first sprinter to win the Olympic double since Usain Bolt in 2016 and the first American since Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nThe most difficult test, the 100 meters, is complete, but Thursday he'll also have to win the 200-meter final, which is his signature event. Lyles achieved the elusive feat at last year's world championships.\n\nHe could win a third Olympic gold medal when he runs the 4x100-meter relay Thursday.\n\nTrack: All 3 Americans advance to 1500-meter final\n\nAmid an insanely talented crop of runners, all three Americans running the 1500-meter race will vie for gold in the final.\n\nAmerican record holder Yared Nuguse was the fastest in the two semifinal heats, clocking in at 3:31.72, with fellow American Hobbs Kessler right behind him.\n\nFinishing first in the other heat was defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen from Norway, followed by defending world champion Josh Kerr from Great Britain, and USA's Cole Hocker in third.\n\nNuguse, Kessler and Hocker each won a medal at World Indoors in March and will look for their first Olympic medals in what promises to be an exhilarating final on Tuesday.\n\nLyles stuns an exhilarated Paris crowd\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nA moment of outrageous drama here at the Stade de France. First a dazzling light show that illumined the arena in a constellation of purple. Then the athletes came out, with eventual winner Noah Lyles running and jumping down the track to ostentatiously announce his presence.\n\nThen from sheer noise to pin-drop quiet as the runners lined up on the start.\n\nAfter the starting gun, from the stands it was hard to pick a clear favorite during the sub-10 seconds they were haring down the track. Spectators and competitors alike seemed none the wiser as to who had won, with Lyles only celebrating when the photo finish was declared.\n\nNoah Lyles: 'America, I told you'\n\nBy just five thousandths of a second, Noah Lyles ended a 20-year American gold medal drought in the men's 100-meter sprint.\n\nAfter a tense review period, Lyles earned his first Olympic gold medal. He's halfway to his goal of winning the Olympic double, which will come down to the 200-meter Thursday.\n\nUpon clinching the gold, he looked straight into the camera and said, \"America, I told you.\"\n\nLyles wins gold in 100-meter final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nTeam USA’s Noah Lyles wins gold in the men’s 100-meter final and Fred Kerley gets bronze!\n\nUkrainian high jumper who fled Russia's war wins high-jump gold\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nAfter fleeing her hometown on the front lines of Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh has just won gold at the Stade de France.\n\nAn almighty roar erupted from the stands when it became clear that Mahuchikh had bested her main rival, Australia’s Nicola Olyslagers. So did it too when she rang the Olympic champions bell inside the stadium, which will be hung inside the rebuilt Notre-Dame Cathedral after the Games.\n\nAside from her remarkable origin story, Mahuchikh has captured the attention this tournament for her unique routine in between jumps: She swaddles herself in a sleeping bag. Olyslagers, meanwhile, furiously writes in her journal.\n\nAfter an epic gold-medal battle, the pair embraced as soon as the result was confirmed.\n\nFencing: France wins men's team foil bronze over USA\n\nAfter the U.S. women took gold in the team foil event, the men narrowly missed the podium in theirs, losing to France 45-32.\n\nFollowing strong bouts in the first two relays from USA's Alexander Massialas and individual bronze medalist Nick Itkin, the French fencers dominated the remaining seven, picking up momentum from the energized home crowd and securing the bronze medal.\n\nIn the fencing finale of this Olympic Games, Italy and Japan are currently fighting in a tight match for gold.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Tommy Fleetwood and Hideki Matsuyama accept their medals after the conclusion of the Olympic men’s golf event.\n\nTrack: Akins misses out, but Whittaker qualifies for 800-meter final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nTeam USA's Nia Akins finished third in her semifinal for the women's 800-meter, but her time of 1:58.20 means she wasn't quick enough to qualify for the final. However, that does mean that her compatriot Juliette Whittaker does go through, with her time of 1:57.76 being enough to make tomorrow night's denouement.\n\nTrack: Waiting game for Whittaker on 800-meter qualification\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nJuliette Whittaker of Team USA gave an extraordinary push on the back straight to finish third in her women's 800-meter semifinal. Only the top two go through automatically, so Whittaker will have to wait until the last round to see if she makes the cut.\n\n3x3 basketball: USA men finish 2-5, won't advance to knockouts\n\nWhile Team USA dominates the 5x5 men's basketball pool, the 3x3 team has struggled, finishing 2 for 5 in the pool rounds and ultimately failing to advance.\n\nAfter losing its first four games, the 3x3 men's team came back to win their next two, giving themselves a chance to win a third and advance to the play-in rounds. But the Netherlands dashed those hopes quickly with a commanding 21-6 win today.\n\nThe U.S. team had been playing shorthanded since losing key player Jimmer Fredette to a leg injury in their second game.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's 3x3 team will look to defend their gold medal from Tokyo and face Spain in the semifinals tomorrow.\n\nBednarek qualifies on time; three Americans in men's sprint final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nWith all the heats done, we now know that Kenny Bednarek has qualified for the men's 100-meter final despite not finishing in the top two of his heat. Bednarek and Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs, of Italy, had the two fastest times of those who did not automatically go through.\n\nThat means that three of the eight finalists will be Americans: Bednarek, Noah Lyles and Fred Kerley, who qualified automatically in the other heats.\n\nJon Rahm was four shots clear of the field on the back nine Sunday at the Olympic men’s event, but finished without a medal. He tried to put his emotions into words.\n\nFred Kerley is second American to make men's sprint final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nTeam USA's Fred Kerley finished second in his semifinal of the men's 100-meter sprint, meaning he joins fellow countryman Noah Lyle in the final.\n\nAmerican Bednarek fails to automatically qualify for sprint final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nIn the second semifinal for the men's 100-meter sprint, Team USA's Kenny Bednarek has come in fourth, meaning he will have to hope he is among the fastest also-rans if he has any hope of qualifying for the final.\n\nOnly the top two go through from each heat, plus the next fastest two runners.\n\nBadminton: Taiwan takes back-to-back men's doubles golds in stunning upset\n\nEven after winning gold in Tokyo, Chinese Taipei duo Yang Lee and Chi-lin Wang were not the favorites to win men's badminton doubles in Paris. China's Wei Keng Liang and Chang Wang loomed large as the No. 1-ranked pair in the world after winning the Asian Championships earlier this year.\n\nBut Lee and Wang prevailed, winning an extremely close, emotionally charged three-game match against their Chinese opponents, and clinching their second straight gold medal in the event. Overcome with emotion, Lee and Wang collapsed to the ground as their supporters erupted into a standing ovation.\n\nTeam USA's Noah Lyles qualifies for men's sprint final\n\nReporting from Stade de France\n\nAmerican sprinter Noah Lyles bagged a comfortable second place in the men's 100-meter semifinal, earning him a place in the final later this evening.

Both nations entered the final race with seven gold medals in swimming in Paris before the Americans emerged victorious.\n\nBelgium withdraws from mixed relay triathlon after athlete who swam in Seine River falls ill\n\nPARIS — Belgium’s Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon at the Paris Olympics after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine River fell ill.\n\nClaire Michel, who competed in the women’s triathlon Wednesday, “is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,” the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement.\n\nThe mixed relay triathlon is scheduled for Monday, with the swim portion of the competition slated for the Seine as well.

Canada was left winless in three games and eliminated.\n\nChina wins 4x100 medley relay in dramatic comeback\n\nPan Zhanle anchored China to a thrilling come-from-behind win in the men’s swimming 4x100 medley relay, rallying past the United States and France.\n\nThe U.S. and hosts were neck and neck headed into the freestyle before Pan’s time of 45.92 put his team past American Hunter Armstrong (47.19) and Frenchman Florent Manaudou (47.59).\n\nThe 4x100 medley is considered one of America’s strongest events, with the U.S. having captured gold in 15 of 16 Olympic finals before tonight.\n\nBobby Finke sets world record in 1500-meter freestyle\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nAmerican Bobby Finke defended his 1500-meter freestyle title in word-record fashion, winning a second consecutive gold in the arduous race.\n\nThe Tampa native pulled away from Italy’s Gregorio Paltrinieri in the final 50 and touched the wall at 14:30.67, besting the previous mark held by China’s Sun Wang, who had a time of 14:31.02 in 2012.\n\nIreland’s Daniel Wiffen, considered the favorite here, took bronze.\n\nBasketball: U.S. women win 58th straight Olympic game\n\nDespite an impressive first two games in its first-ever Olympics, the German women's basketball team couldn't come close to breaking the U.S. women's formidable winning streak, as the U.S. cruised to an 87-68 victory.\n\nA'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart each scored in the double digits, but the star of the game was Jackie Young, who exploded for a game-high 19 points, including five 3-pointers. The U.S. showed off its depth, with its bench contributing 52 points compared to Germany's 13.\n\nThe U.S. will next play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, as it pursues its eighth straight Olympic gold medal.\n\nSwimming: No surprise as Sweden's Sarah Sjöström wins 50-meter free\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nSwedish speedster Sarah Sjöström splashed and dashed to gold in the 50-meter freestyle.\n\nSjöström was the overwhelming favorite here, having set an Olympic record in the semifinals last night.

Rahm and Schauffele faltered as Scheffler fired four straight birdies and tied a course record of 9 under 62 to win the men's competition.\n\nGreat Britain's Tommy Fleetwood fell out of the lead with a bogey and landed silver, while Japan's Hideki Matsuyama took bronze.\n\nCycling: Kristen Faulkner soars ahead in massive upset for Team USA\n\nIt was the \"upset of a lifetime\" in women's road cycling today as American Kristen Faulkner surged ahead of the pack to secure gold at the end of the race.\n\nFaulkner was not a favorite to win this race, but the former rower crossed the finish line almost a full minute ahead of Netherlands' Marianne Vos and Germany's Lotte Kopecky.\n\nThis is the first Olympics for Faulkner, who did not qualify on her own for the race and was added to Team USA at the last minute. She only began cycling as a hobby, saying it provided an outlet for her venture capital job in New York City.\n\nFaulkner is the first American woman to win gold in the women’s road race since 1984.\n\nRead the full article here\n\nBasketball: USA seizes control from Germany, leads 41-29 at halftime\n\nAfter Germany appeared to be stiff competition at the start of the game, the U.S. women's basketball team remembered who they were in the second quarter.\n\nThe U.S. hit their stride with a sharp 11-0 run fueled by improved shooting and more aggression in the paint. But the team still has room for cohesion, and they might be lucky that Germany's 3-pointers went cold.\n\nAfter a sluggish start, A'ja Wilson found her form again, combining for 19 points with Breanna Stewart.\n\nBasketball: Germany takes early 19-16 lead over U.S. women\n\nGermany set the tone early, with three consecutive shots from downtown to continue their strong 3-point shooting in Paris so far. The U.S. continued to struggle with theirs, missing all three of their attempts in the first quarter.\n\nBreanna Stewart leads the U.S. in scoring with 6 points.\n\n'I thought I was done': Lee on health battles after bars bronze\n\nReporting from Bercy Arena, Paris\n\nDid Suni Lee think she would be here at Paris 2024 given her recent battles with kidney disease?\n\n“Absolutely not,” she said. “In the back of my head, I really thought that I was done.” Gymnastics “wasn’t even something that I wanted to do anymore. I was ready to move on with my life. I wanted to move across the country, and everyone’s like, ‘What are you talking about? Like you can’t make decisions when you’re sad,’” she added with a laugh.\n\nThe result, however, is a Games where she and her fellow Team USA gymnasts are clearly in a better place than at Tokyo 2020. “You could look back and see a lot of the girls not really having a lot of fun and not smiling,” she said. “And this time we’re celebrating after every turn, going up and hugging everybody.”\n\nBeaming, she said that “gymnastics is a lot more fun when you’re having fun. So I’m just having a blast here.”\n\nLee also revealed the inspirational effect she’s had on others.\n\n“The past couple of days I’ve been flooded with messages from people saying they’ve had chronic illnesses,” she said. “So it’s a really good feeling, knowing that I can inspire others, especially knowing I’ve spent a lot of months at my lowest. Having people who were there to uplift me and support me along the way was such a good feeling. And I think that’s such an important message: to just lean on your people when you need them.”\n\nBasketball: U.S. women play Germany in final group play game\n\nWith its final group play game against Germany underway, the U.S. women's basketball team aims to extend its remarkable streak of 57 straight Olympic wins, dating back to the 1992 Barcelona Games. But Germany is expected to be tough competition, as it also enters the matchup 2-0 with Dallas Wings star Satou Sabally leading the charge.\n\nThe winner of this game will emerge as the champion of Group C, though both the U.S. and Germany have already secured spots in the quarterfinals.\n\nCameroon-born Cindy Ngamba secures first-ever medal for Refugee Olympic Team\n\nBoxer Cindy Ngamba not only earned her personal glory at the Paris Games, but the Cameroon-born athlete has guaranteed the Refugee Olympic Team its first medal.\n\nShe defeated France's Davina Michel today, moving forward to a gold medal match in Women's 75-kg boxing. Ngamba is guaranteed a bronze medal regardless of how her next bout in the ring ends.\n\nNgamba left Cameroon for the U.K. with her mother and brother when she was just 11, where she said she struggled with the English-language. She is also openly gay, something she could not be in her country of origin as homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon.\n\nAt the end of her fight against Michel, which Ngamba won by unanimous decision, she grabbed a board and pointed to the Refugee Olympic Team name for the camera and the crowds.\n\nSuni Lee: 'I was coming back to redeem myself'\n\nReporting from Bercy Arena, Paris\n\nAfter winning bronze in women’s uneven bars, Team USA’s Suni Lee told reporters that after a challenging time battling kidney disease, her main goal today was redemption.\n\n“I told myself that I was coming back to redeem myself on bars and that’s what I did this time; I really wanted to just put a good, clean routine together,” said Lee. “I saw that I could if I just did the routine that I did the past couple of days, then I could have medaled. I just wanted to go up there and prove to myself that I can do it.”\n\nSome may think Lee had an advantage in going last because she knew what she needed to do. But she said “it’s a lot harder because I had to watch everybody in front of me, so it definitely put the pressure on.”\n\nLee’s teammate Simone Biles warned journalists earlier in the day to “stop asking athletes what’s next after they win a medal at the Olympics.” When NBC News asked Lee whether she could return at Los Angeles 2028, she locked her stare, gave a half smile, waited a beat and said, “No comment.”\n\nGymnastics: Men's vault podium\n\nThe race for a vault medal came down to tenths of a point, the equivalent of a foot shuffle upon landing. Artur Davtyan earned Armenia its second ever Olympic gymnastics medal. The only other one also belongs to him.\n\nCarlos Yulo, Philippines, 15.116\n\nArtur Davtyan, Armenia, 14.966\n\nHarry Hepworth, Great Britain, 14.949\n\nGymnastics: Carlos Yulo wins second gold for Philippines\n\nTwenty-four hours after winning the first Olympic gymnastics medal for the Philippines, Carlos Yulo has won a second gold, this time in vault.\n\n“I am happy that I won a gold medal and also a house,\" he said after yesterday's floor exercise win, referring to the nation's policy of gifting Olympic gold medal winners a home.\n\nHe has yet to share whether this means he gets two houses.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz reflects on silver medal\n\nAlcaraz fell 7-6, 7-6 to Novak Djokovic but still is proud of what he was able to accomplish.\n\n“It is painful to lose the way that I lost this match,\" he said on NBC after the defeat. \"I had my opportunities. ... Novak is playing great. He deserved this. In the difficult moments, he increased his level. He played unbelievable.”\n\n“I am a little bit disappointed, but I’m going to leave the court with my head high. I gave everything that I had. Fighting for Spain was everything for me. I’m proud of the way I played today.”\n\nTennis: Djokovic had to work for it, but at last he has gold\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, who had hinted that this would be his last Olympics, has finally added an elusive gold medal to his arsenal of Grand Slams and trophies.\n\nIt was his fifth attempt to take gold.\n\nAfter winning two sets against Carlos Alcaraz, each with a neck-and-neck tiebreaker, Djokovic did it, defeating his Spanish opponent 7-6, 7-6.\n\nGymnastics: Nemour wins Africa's first gymnastics medal\n\nKaylia Nemour's uneven bars gold is the first ever Olympic gymnastics medal for an African country.\n\nNemour was born and raised France, but is representing her father's Algeria in Paris due to a dispute with her home country's federation. She switched nationalities last year and qualified for the Paris Games despite Algeria not fielding a full gymnastics team.\n\nThe French team is sure to be lamenting burned bridges with Nemour this week. They had a disastrous showing in front of their home crowd in qualifying and failed to advance to any finals.\n\nTennis: Djokovic tied with Alcaraz during grueling second set\n\nNovak Djokovic is three games away from a gold medal. But he's fighting tooth and nail to get there.\n\nWith the second set underway, the Serb and the Spaniard are tied 4-4.\n\nAs the Paris heat beats down on them, it's clear Carlos Alcaraz is losing focus.\n\nMeanwhile, Djokovic has just about every honor in tennis except Olympic gold. He is halfway there to getting it, but facing an uphill climb, as winning each point becomes a herculean task for either player.\n\nAusten Smith wins bronze in women's skeet shooting\n\nTeam USA's Austen Smith has won bronze in the women's skeet shooting event.\n\nThis is 23-year-old Smith's second Olympic Games, finishing 10th in this event in Tokyo, and her medal follows yesterday's men's skeet event in which Team USA's Vincent Hancock and Conner Prince took gold and silver.\n\nRemarkable drama for Suni Lee\n\nReporting from Bercy Arena, Paris\n\nAhead of Team USA's big hope in the uneven bars, the stadium built to a crescendo roar before dying back down to almost complete silence as Suni Lee began her routine. Shouts of \"come on, Suni!\" could be heard from the crowd, which erupted when she landed on the mat.\n\nWhen her score came through on the big screen, enough to gain a bronze medal, Lee visibly gasped, the audience saluting her with rapturous applause.\n\nSuni Lee takes bars bronze\n\nLee's suitcase is getting heavy in Paris. She claimed the bronze in Sunday's bars final, her third medal of these Olympics and sixth total.\n\nShe had the advantage of going last, which gave her the opportunity to perform the most strategic routine possible. Lee earned a 14.800 with a slightly more conservative routine, clinching her second consecutive bronze in the event.\n\nGymnastics: Algeria's Kaylia Nemour fulfills her destiny\n\nUpon landing her dismount on her signature event, Kaylia Nemour couldn't keep the emotion from her face.\n\nHer road to Paris was a long one. She weathered a dispute with her home country of France that led to a switch in national delegation to her father's Algeria. She is representing Algeria here and is now in a position to secure the country their first medal in gymnastics.\n\nIt's likely to be gold. She earned a 15.700, the highest score on the event of the entire Olympics.\n\nGymnastics: China's Qiu Qiyuan launches into first\n\nThe uneven bars podium has a new leader: Qiu Qiyuan of China.\n\nQiyuan has struggled with consistency in Paris, falling in Thursday's all-around final, but not today. She earned a 15.500, putting her in first place by a wide margin ahead of the reigning Olympic champion, Nina Derwael.\n\nGymnastics: Becky Downie, Great Britain's veteran, falters in medal quest\n\nBecky Downie is a three-time Olympian, but an Olympic medal continues to elude her.\n\nShe is a world medalist on bars, but fell on her routine in Sunday's final, an error that will likely keep her from the podium.\n\nCompeting in Paris at all is a triumph for Downie, who suddenly lost her brother ahead of the Tokyo trials and failed to make the team that went on to win a historic team bronze. Simone Biles could be seen covering her face in the crowd after Downie's mistake, a testament to Downie's international popularity in the sport.\n\nAudible gasps at bars slip for Britain's Rebecca Downie\n\nReporting from Bercy Arena, Paris\n\nThe Bercy Arena let out a collective gasp as Team GB's Rebecca Downie lost her grip and fell onto the mat during her uneven bars final routine. She scored 13.633, putting her in third place so far.\n\nGymnastics: Reigning Olympic bars champion attempts a repeat\n\nBelgium's Nina Derwael, who won the uneven bars gold medal in Tokyo, narrowly earned a Paris berth after dislocating her shoulder.\n\nHer 14.766 will overtake Alice D'Amato, but she has yet to return to peak form.\n\nShe had to qualify on her weaker event, the balance beam, to make it to Paris, but easily earned her spot in this bar final.\n\nGymnastics: Alice D'Amato eyes individual medal\n\nAfter narrowly missing the all-around podium Thursday, Italy's Alice D'Amato had a strong showing in Sunday's uneven bars final, earning a 14.733.\n\nShe's in first for now, but many contenders have yet to go, including Suni Lee and Algeria's Kaylia Nemour, who is favored for gold.\n\nTennis: Djokovic takes first set 7-6 after grueling tiebreaker\n\nThe gold-medal match between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic is neck and neck. It’s a rematch of last month’s Wimbledon final, from which Alcaraz walked away victorious.\n\nAfter 13 unsuccessful break points, the first set moved into a tiebreaker, during which the players alternated scoring. Djokovic was on the attack, going for winners more than once during points sometimes. Alcaraz had a number of unforced errors that flopped on execution. But at moments, you could see the 21-year-old Spaniard getting under Djokovic’s skin, as he got frustrated with the closeness of the set.\n\nUltimately, Djokovic won the tiebreaker and took the first set after more than 90 minutes of battling. Whoever takes the best of three will take home the gold.\n\nHuge reaction for Suni Lee in the arena\n\nReporting from Bercy Arena, Paris\n\nThe athletes are out warming up for the uneven bars, and Team USA's big hope, Suni Lee, just got a huge reaction from the Stars and Stripes-waving section of the crowd when her name was called out.\n\nGymnastics: China tops rings podium\n\nChina secured some redemption in today's men's still rings final after narrowly losing the top spot in the all-around and team finals to Japan.\n\nLiu Yang, China, 15.300\n\nZou Jingyuan, China, 15.233\n\nEleftherios Petrounias, Greece, 15.100\n\nSuni Lee is the sole U.S. representative in the bars final\n\nTeam USA has one chance to medal on the uneven bars final today, and that one chance is named Suni Lee.\n\nLee is in third after qualifiers with a score of 14.866, trailing Kaylia Nemour in first and Qiu Qiyuan in second.\n\nNemour is the gold-medal favorite today, and while both Qiu and Lee are expected to medal, it's unclear who will grab silver and who will take bronze.\n\nQiu was the likely contender for silver heading into Paris, but she's struggled with consistency throughout these Games, notably falling in the all-around final Thursday in her signature event.\n\nLee has been stunning in all of her bars performances so far, one of which helped her team win the gold medal on Tuesday and the other earning her a bronze in the all-around on Thursday.\n\nBrady Ellison takes silver after dramatic men's individual archery final\n\nFive millimeters is all that separated Team USA's Brady Ellison from achieving his dream of an Olympic gold medal, but the Arizona native will have to settle for silver after losing to South Korea's Kim Woojin by the tiniest of margins.\n\nWith the scores level after five sets, the gold came down to a one-arrow shoot-off, with whoever's arrow landed closer to the center of the target taking the gold. Kim went first, landing his arrow on the outer edge of the 10, but in response, Ellison's arrow was heartbreakingly just five millimeters farther away from the center.\n\nThe result means Ellison takes silver, his second medal of these Games and the fifth of his career — his tally now standing at three silvers and two bronzes.\n\nTennis: Alcaraz fighting back\n\nReporting from Roland Garros\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has fought back to make it even at 3-3 in the first set of the gold-medal match against Novak Djokovic.\n\nDjokovic up early in first set\n\nReporting from Roland Garros\n\nNovak Djokovic has an early advantage in the first set, 2-1, over Carlos Alcaraz as the two men battle for gold.\n\nBrady Ellison into gold-medal match in men's individual archery\n\nTeam USA's Brady Ellison is into the gold medal match of the men's individual archery competition after beating Germany’s Florian Unruh 7-3 in the semifinals.\n\nEllison claimed his fourth career Olympic medal, with a bronze in the mixed competition alongside Casey Kaufhold earlier in the Games. Now in his fifth Olympics, the Arizona native has two Olympic silvers and two bronzes to his name. At a minimum, he will add another silver to his haul, but he will now have the chance to secure the elusive Olympic gold.\n\nEllison has been in hot form all day, earlier beating South Korean second seed Kim Je Doek 6-0. He will now face top seed Kim Woojin, also from South Korea, in the gold-medal match shortly at around 8:45 a.m. ET. Kim is searching for his third gold medal of these Games, having already taken the men's team and mixed team titles.\n\nWatch the MVP of these Olympic Games, Snoop Dogg, attempt to weightlift with Team USA.\n\nTennis: Men's singles match about to begin\n\nReporting from Roland Garros\n\nThe packed house at Roland-Garros' Court Philippe-Chatrier erupted moments earlier when Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic made their way onto the court.\n\nThe duo, who faced off just last month at the Wimbledon final, with Alcaraz prevailing, will compete for the gold medal.\n\nTeam USA cyclist Kristen Faulkner’s unusual path to the Olympics\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nCyclist Kristen Faulkner is set to compete in the women's road race this morning, but her journey to the Olympics is surprising.\n\nShe didn’t even start cycling until after college.

Bol, fresh from making headlines last night after overhauling three runners in the 4x400m mixed relay to take gold in an epic race, took her heat in 53.38s.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the defending Olympic champion, has rewritten the record books in this event, breaking her own world record at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year. Bol then went on to run the third-fastest time ever in the event last month, setting up a tantalizing clash at these Games.\n\nAnna Cockrell and NCAA champion Jasmine Jones both won their heats to ensure all three Americans in this event progress.\n\nHistory on the line as Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz go head-to-head for gold\n\nWhen Novak Djokovic takes to the court to face off with Carlos Alcaraz at Roland-Garros today, he will be looking to win the one title that has eluded him his entire career — Olympic gold.\n\nVictory would see 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic complete what is known in tennis as the \"Golden Slam\" — winning all four Grand Slam titles and Olympic gold across a career. He would be joining the illustrious company of Steffi Graff, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams in the record books.\n\n\"This dream is long lived and fought for,\" Djokovic posted on X after his semifinal victory against Lorenzo Musetti Friday, which saw Djokovic at his glittering best despite concerns over his knee. Certainly, the Olympics have been a brutal beast for the Serbian icon — a bronze in 2008 was the only Olympic medal to his name before today. At 37-years-old, this may well be Djokovic's last chance to put his Olympic demons to rest.\n\nSpanish phenom Alcaraz, who only turned 21 in May, will be aiming to create history of his own. He is looking to become just the second man ever, behind his compatriot Nadal, to win the French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic gold in the same summer.\n\nThis will be a rematch of last month's Wimbledon final with Alcaraz the comfortable straight-sets victor on the grass in London. It was miraculous that Djokovic was even at Wimbledon, let alone the final, with it coming a matter of weeks after Djokovic underwent knee surgery.\n\nThe gold medal match of the men's singles is due to begin at around 8 a.m. ET.\n\nGrant Holloway fastest in men's 110m hurdles heats, Freddie Crittenden takes a mulligan to go again in repechage\n\nGrant Holloway, the three-time reigning World Champion, is safely through to the semifinals of the men’s 110m hurdles, but there was a bizarre moment involving one of his Team USA teammates.\n\nHolloway narrowly missed out on gold in Tokyo and is the heavy favorite to earn redemption this time around. He dominated his heat to qualify fastest in 13.01s, the fastest time by more than two-tenths of a second in the heats.\n\nDaniel Roberts scraped through to Wednesday's semifinals, taking a three-way photo finish to scrape through his heat in third.\n\nFreddie Crittenden, who came fourth at last year's World Championships, strangely jogged his heat, saying afterwards he strategically chose to take it easy after tweaking something in the build-up. He came in dead last and will now have until Tuesday to recover when he will have a second chance to make the semifinals in the repechage, essentially a second stage of heats for those who failed to qualify first time around.\n\nHolloway, Roberts and Crittenden have run the three quickest times in the world this year, and there is hope that Team USA could sweep the podium in this event.\n\nTennis: Spanish duo win first set in bronze medal match\n\nReporting from Roland Garros\n\nCristina Busca and Sara Sorribes Tormo took the first set 6-2 from Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova of Czechia in the bronze medal match of women's doubles.\n\nBusca and Tormo got off to a similar start in the second set and took the first two games there as well.\n\nJulien Alfred, 20, stunned Sha’Carri Richardson in the women’s 100m final, winning St. Lucia’s first Olympic medal with a run of 10.72 seconds.\n\nAmericans all qualify for 200-meter semifinals with Gabby Thomas fastest overall\n\nThe final heat of the women's 200-meter has just wrapped and all three Americans competing in the event have progressed to tomorrow evening's semifinals, with Gabby Thomas with the fastest overall time.\n\nThomas, who won the bronze medal for this event in Tokyo, will be joined in the semifinals by 2019 world silver medalist Brittany Brown. Thomas' 22.20s was the quickest time in this morning's heats with Brown fourth fastest, winning her heat in 22.38s.\n\nMcKenzie Long also won her heat, finishing in 22.55s to qualify with the eighth fastest time.\n\nBoxing: Lin Yu-ting wins, locks up medal for Chinese Taipei\n\nReporting from Villepinte, France\n\nLin Yu-ting won her quarterfinal bout against Bulgarian Svetlana Staneva in a unanimous decision that assured a medal for the featherweight representing Chinese Taipei.\n\nLin and Algeria’s Imane Khelif have faced withering scrutiny during these Olympics, based on a 2023 disqualifications by the Russian-led International Boxing Association which claimed that unspecified tests called the boxers’ gender into question.\n\nIOC has staunchly defended the boxers, saying concerns over their gender are baseless. The IBA has since been called into question, with USA Boxing terminated its relationship with the body last year.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nGold medal favorite Shericka Jackson withdraws minutes before 200m heat, opening path for Gabby Thomas\n\nHuge news from the Stade de France with Jamaica's Shericka Jackson pulling out of the 200-meter, minutes before the heats this morning.\n\nJackson, who has won back-to-back world titles in this event, had pulled out of the 100-meter earlier this week. No official reason has been given for her withdrawal from this event yet, though she had been struggling with an injury coming into the Games after pulling up at the Hungarian Grand Prix three-weeks ago.\n\nIt is another blow for Jamaica after Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce withdrew from her 100-meter semifinal last night because of an injury.\n\nTeam USA's Gabby Thomas is safely through to tomorrow's semifinal, winning her heat in a time of 22.20s. Jackson was set to be her main competition for gold in this event, and her withdrawal really opens up the competition for the rest of the field. Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred, fresh from winning gold in the 100-meter last night, eased into victory in her heat in 22.41s to also progress into the semifinal.\n\nGabby Thomas about to get her Olympic campaign underway\n\nTeam USA's Gabby Thomas is involved in this morning's 200-meter heats, which are about to get underway at the Stade de France.\n\nThomas, who took bronze in Tokyo, is in the second of the six heats.\n\nJamaica's Shericka Jackson has been the woman to beat in this event in recent years and is Thomas' main rival for gold. She goes in the third heat.\n\nGabby Thomas balances training for Paris while working at a Texas health clinic\n\nA typical day for U.S. track and field athlete Gabby Thomas is a full 24 hours. During the day, she trains three to six hours in anticipation of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nBut at night, she works at an Austin, Texas, volunteer health care clinic for people without insurance.\n\nHow does one of the fastest athletes in her sport find the time to do it all? She attributes that work ethic to her mother. When Thomas and her twin brother were young, their mom waitressed and took classes to become a professor.\n\n“She showed me in real time growing up what it’s like to go after your dreams and to achieve them, and to become successful,” Thomas, 27, told NBC News. “I watched her just achieve all of that by herself and while raising us.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTeam USA gearing up for Super Sunday\n\nWith 20 gold medals due to be handed out today, Team USA is hoping to bring in a big medal haul with superstar Noah Lyles headlining one of the most eagerly-anticipated events of the Games — the men's 100-meters.\n\nLyles has claimed throughout the build-up to the Olympics he is the fastest man on the planet after winning the world title last year, but with Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and Oblique Seville also in the mix, this looks set to be one of the most hyped and competitive 100-metre races since the days of Usain Bolt.\n\nIt's the final day in the pool, and the U.S.-Australia rivalry is on a knife edge. Team USA has already guaranteed they will walk away from the pool with the most total medals — 25 and counting — but in terms of golds, Australia are narrowly in front with seven golds to the U.S.'s six.\n\nThere are some very strong events in the pool for Team USA today though; the U.S. has won every gold medal in the men's 4x100m medley relay since 1960 (except for the boycotted 1980 Games) and will be the favorites for gold again.\n\nBobby Finke goes in the men's 1500m freestyle as he looks to defend his Olympic title. Team USA and Australia are also expected to clash for gold in the women's 50m freestyle and the women's 4x100m medley relay.\n\nElsewhere, Suni Lee is involved in the women's uneven bars final, Xander Schauffele is tied for the lead in the men's golf heading into the final round and Team USA are expected to be in the medal mix in fencing's men's team foil event.\n\nFrom Egypt to Italy: A history of fencing\n\nThe men's team foil medal bouts in fencing take place today.\n\nLike the pommel horse, fencing also has its origins in military training before slowly evolving into a sport.\n\nThe earliest depiction of swordplay is a relief in the temple of Medīnat Habu, built by Egyptian pharaoh Ramses III in about 1190 BCE, near to the Egyptian city of Luxor.\n\nBut it wasn’t until two-and-a-half thousand years later that it became a sport.\n\nInspired by the Italian, German and French fencing masters of the early 15th century, it made the transition from a form of military training to sport. German fencing masters then began organizing the first guilds, including the famous Marxbrueder of Frankfurt in 1478.\n\nBy the 17th and 18th centuries, the sport of fencing had already begun to resemble what is seen at the Olympics today, with the invention of the flat-tipped foil weapon and wire-mesh masks, as well as rules governing procedure and target area.\n\nMen's golf set for thrilling conclusion as Xander Schauffele looks to defend Olympic gold\n\nThe stage is set for an epic finale in the men's golf competition with Team USA's Xander Schauffele tied with Jon Rahm at the top of the leaderboard heading into today's finely-poised final round at Le Golf National.\n\nSchauffele and Rahm are level on 14-under-par with 18 holes left to play, and some of the biggest names in the sport are close behind in the chasing pack.\n\nGreat Britain's Tommy Fleetwood is just one shot back, while Team USA's Scottie Scheffler, Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama are all in the top 10 and can propel themselves into medal contention with strong final rounds.\n\nThe final round is already underway with the leading trio of Schauffele, Rahm and Fleetwood the last to tee off for the day at 6:39 a.m. ET.\n\nTeam USA's historic Saturday in Paris with 18 medals added to haul\n\nSaturday was a historic day for Team USA, who added five golds, six silvers and seven bronze medals — the most medals won by U.S. athletes in a single day since the Seoul Games in 1988.\n\nAmong them, Simone Biles won her seventh career Olympic gold in the vault. Vincent Hancock and Katie Ledecky made history by becoming just the sixth and seventh Olympians to win four gold medals in the same individual event — Hancock doing so in the men’s skeet shooting and Ledecky winning her fourth career 800m freestyle gold. Ryan Crouser took his third consecutive gold medal in the men’s shot put.\n\nHow to watch\n\nStream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock.\n\nFull primetime coverage begins tonight on NBC and Peacock at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe women’s gymnastics all-around final in slow motion\n\nGymnasts never fail to deliver mesmerizing performances, seamlessly pairing athleticism with grace. The best moves from Simone Biles, Suni Lee and others in the women’s individual all-around are even more epic in slow motion.\n\nWhen Simone Biles does the Yurchenko double pike, the most difficult vault ever done by a female gymnast, the whole world watches in awe. Relive the two phenomenal vaults that earned Biles her 10th Olympic medal.\n\nDay 8 recap: What you missed in swimming, gymnastics, track and field, and more\n\nDay 8 of the Olympics was jam-packed with action. We saw legends in their sport add to their gold-medal counts, thrilling finishes on the track and much more. Let’s dive into the day’s biggest events.\n\nRead the full story here."
