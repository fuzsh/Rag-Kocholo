If the Olympic gold medal hanging from Lance Armstrong's neck looks more like a bronze, there's a simple explanation.\n\nLance Armstrong earned his first Olympic medal by riding to the bronze Saturday in the men's time trial.\n\nIt is a bronze. Armstrong placed third in the 33-mile Olympic time trial Saturday, giving his best effort but falling short in his drive for gold. Afterward, the two-time Tour de France champion saw no reason to apologize. \"I came to win the gold medal, but I can't complain,\" he said. \"I went as hard as I could. I wish I could tell you I had a problem like a flat or I felt bad or I had bad legs. To me, the ride was complete.\" The gold went to Viacheslav Ekimov of Russia, who races with Armstrong on the U.S. Postal Service trade team. Ekimov was timed in 57 minutes, 40 seconds, seven seconds better than silver medalist Jan Ullrich of Germany, who won Wednesday's road race, and 34 seconds ahead of Armstrong. \"I just didn't go as fast as the other two,\" said Armstrong, of Austin, Texas. \"They are both great bike riders. I'm not going to cry about it.\" After he broke a neck vertebra in a collision with a car one month ago, there were questions about how Armstrong would perform in Sydney. He insisted the injury wasn't a factor in the time trial or his 13th-place finish in the road race. \"The test that I did before I came over said I was close,\" he said, referring to his victory in the Grand Prix des Nations time trial two weeks ago. As another Olympic warmup, Armstrong teamed with Ekimov to win a dual event, the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx time trial on Aug. 27, two days before Armstrong's crash. The two are buddies, rooming together when the Postal Service team travels. Armstrong got the headlines when he rolled down the Champs-Elysees, but Ekimov was one of his workhorses, sort of an offensive lineman on wheels. \"If you watched the Tour de France, he put it all on the line for me to win,\" Armstrong said. \"As upset as I am not to win a gold medal, I'm that much happier for him to win one. He's a true champion and a true gentleman.\" Tyler Hamilton of Marblehead, Mass., another Postal Service team member, finished 10th in 59:26. Ekimov raced in the second of three flights, with Armstrong, Ullrich and other top riders assigned to the third flight. After he rode, Ekimov watched from the pits and smiled broadly as his time survived the assaults. \"I was totally nervous watching the last riders,\" said Ekimov, who won the gold in pursuit for the former Soviet Union at the Seoul Olympics. \"I hoped inside to get a top five would be great, but this is just outstanding.\" It was a sunny day with breezy winds. When a reporter suggested Ekimov may have had an advantage by riding when winds were low, Armstrong refused to make it an issue. \"If you're asking if the wind in the third wave was more than the wind in the second wave, I don't want to say that. I was here when the riders in the second wave were riding and it was windy also,\" he said. While Armstrong didn't get the gold he wanted, at least he has a medal for his crowded trophy case. Until the time trial, he was 0-for-4 in Olympic races dating to the 1992 Barcelona Games. \"I came to win the gold medal, but I did everything I could,\" he said. \"I went as hard as I could. My heart rate was pegged the whole time. I could not have gone any harder.\" Gold, silver or bronze, Armstrong came to Sydney to celebrate. The fourth anniversary of his cancer diagnosis is approaching. When Armstrong raced in the Atlanta Olympics, finishing sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road race, he was suffering from testicular cancer, though he didn't know he had the disease. By the time it was diagnosed on Oct. 2, 1996, the disease had spread to Armstrong's lungs and brain. He went through surgery and chemotherapy before resuming his racing career in 1998. As he does each year, Armstrong will throw a party to mark the date. \"Every year we have a party or have some special time with friends and family,\" he said. \"They've occurred all over the world, sometimes in Austin, sometimes in France. This year, it will be in Sydney. \"I'm glad the race is over and I can enjoy myself,\" he said. \"I had hoped to make it a double celebration but I can't complain.\""
