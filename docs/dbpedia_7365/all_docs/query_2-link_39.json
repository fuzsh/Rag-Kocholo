        "text": "Cuban legend Juan Hernández Sierra was one of the premier welterweights on the amateur circuit throughout the 1990s. During that stretch he won two Olympic silver medals and four World Championship gold medals.\n\nHernández, who was one of three brothers, was born in the town of Guane, Pinar del Río in the very west of Cuba, on March 16, 1969.\n\n“I had a very simple life in my childhood but a happy one,” Hernández told The Ring through Gerardo Saldivar. “Both my parents were hard workers. My father worked as a food warehouse worker and my mother as a hospital cleaner.\n\n“Me and my brothers used to hang out after school and play sports. I started as a football player as central defender.”\n\nWhen he was around 11, 12-years-old, he first watched boxing and it quickly became his chosen path.\n\n“I remember watching my cousin, Jose Luis Hernandez, on TV and that got my attention,” he said. “He was a source of inspiration and I wanted to be like him.\n\n“I was selected for the talent program and went at an early age to study in the EIDE (sports institution school) in my province and then I moved up to the ESPA (perfection training school) and then the national team, I went from grassroots to elite level from 1987 to 2000. I was part of national team and I’m really proud about it.”\n\nHe won nine national titles, no small feat considering the vast pool of talent on the Island. During his tenure on the national team he boxed all over the world and represented Cuba in many tournaments.\n\nUnfortunately for him he had to settle for silver at the Olympics in Barcelona in 1992, losing 13:10 to Michael Carruth, as well as in Atlanta in 1996, where he was edged out by his big rival Oleg Saitov 14:9.\n\nHowever, it was at the World Championships where he picked up the top prize in 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1999 as well as bronze in 1997, that he came to the fore.\n\n“I was always well-prepared as in the Olympics but at the World Championships, I got luckier,” he said.\n\nAfter losing at the quarter final stage to eventual gold medalist Yermakhan Ibraimov at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Hernandez retired from boxing with a record of 360-36.\n\nDespite his amateur accolades he says the lure of professional boxing wasn’t there for him.\n\n“Not really, as at that time Cuba was not involved in professional boxing,” he explained.\n\nSince then, he has put the wealth of experience he picked up from his own career back into boxing.\n\n“I’m a coach with national Olympic team, I’m taking care of Saidel Horta, who I want to teach how to move in the ring,” he said. “I was also coach of Kevin Brown, Emmanuel Reyes and David Morrell. The Cuban boxing school is unique, one of the best in the world and has adapted through times, this new generation it’s different to our times. Inclusion in professional boxing has made our boxing improve.\n\n“My objective is to bring my experience to the table with the national team and bring home one or more Olympic gold medals.”\n\nHernandez, now 55, lives in Havana.\n\nHe graciously took time to speak to The Ring about the best he fought in 10 key categories.\n\nBEST JAB\n\nDaniel Santos: “The ’95 World championships in Berlin. In the first fight I had to figure out how to get inside and avoid his fast jab.”\n\nBEST DEFENSE\n\nOleg Saitov: “His upper body movement was especially difficult and tricky as he could find himself in a position to counter-attack.”\n\nBEST HANDSPEED\n\nFreddy Dominguez: “Agile and it was like ghost hands you couldn’t see where they came from.”\n\nBEST FOOTWORK\n\nDamian Austin: “His way of walking the ring is like you were someone dancing.”\n\nSMARTEST\n\nSaitov: “He had master technique. We fought four times, I beat him in ’95 World Championships in Berlin and then he beat me three times.”\n\nSTRONGEST\n\nLeonard Bundu: “The Italian at the Houston World Championships. He was always coming forward, his style was complicated.”\n\nBEST PUNCHER\n\nDavid Reid: “He’s the hardest puncher I faced. He caught me with a swing to the chin and I felt like I was doll as I flew through the air. I felt bad and had to stand up and come back and then he got me back with a punch in the forehead, I felt I left the floor and was the only and first time I visited canvas twice. I been looking for that fight in the internet without success. I wish I could watch that fight again.”\n\nBEST CHIN\n\nBundu: “He was a stronger boxer physically.”\n\nBEST BOXING SKILLS\n\nSaitov: “He beat me three times. What can I say, great boxing technique and skills, nothing but respect.”\n\nBEST OVERALL\n\nSaitov: “Saitov had mastered a technique in the upper body movement and has also power punch and was difficult to figure out his style when we face each other.”\n\nGerardo Saldivar helped coordinate and translate this feature. The Ring appreciated his assistance\n\nQuestions and/or comments can be sent to Anson at [email protected]."
