        "text": "West German cyclist Manfred Rich was a member of the disappointing 4,000 metres track pursuit team that was eliminated in the qualification round at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The day before the race, the team was involved in an accident with a car during a training session. In 1992, 1996 and 2004, Rich participated in road race events at the Olympics. At Barcelona in 1992 he won the gold medal with the 100 km team time trial, representing the then re-unified Germany. The team members were awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany’s highest sports award. At Athens in 2004, Rich finished fourth in the individual time trial.\n\nRich turned professional with Team Gerolsteiner in 1999. He won five national titles in time trial events, and also won three silver medals (2001-02 and 2004), and one bronze (2003) at World Championships. His high points were winning the Tour de la Somme in 1999, the Bayern Tour in 2002-03 and 2005, and the International Rheinland-Pfalz Tour in 2005. Rich later became a sports journalist, team coordinator, and developer of racing bikes."
