        "text": "Chris Hoy (born March 23, 1976, Edinburgh, Scotland) is a British cyclist and race-car driver whose six career Olympic gold medals are among the most won by any Briton.\n\nHoy took up cycling at age seven. He competed in bicycle motocross racing until 1991, when he turned briefly to mountain biking. He also rowed for Scotland at the junior championship level. Hoy changed disciplines to track cycling in 1992, and in 1994 he won his first British championship track medal, a silver in the junior sprint.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nA pivotal point in his career came in 1997 when the British Cycling Federation launched its World Class Performance Plan, which provided funding for Hoy while he completed his studies. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1999 with a bachelor’s degree in sports science. That same year he also won his first senior world championship medal, a team sprint silver.\n\nHoy won a team sprint silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. In 2002 he became a double world champion in the kilometre time trial and team sprint. Though he was less successful in 2003, he regained the world kilometre title in 2004 and, that same year, won gold at the Athens Olympic Games in the kilometre time trial while setting an Olympic and world sea-level record with his time of 1 min 0.711 sec.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee’s decision in 2005 to drop the kilometre event from the program for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games prompted Hoy, who was noted for his analytic approach to the sport and training, to rethink his strategy and focus on pure sprinting. His final ride at the kilometre distance was on May 12, 2007, in La Paz, Bolivia, where he tackled the absolute world record at altitude (58.85 sec) set in 2001 by Frenchman Arnaud Tournant on the same track. Hoy fell short by just five one-thousandths of a second on his second attempt. He left Bolivia with the consolation of having taken more than a second off the world record for a flying-start 500-metre time trial, clocking 24.758 sec, the following day.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2007 Hoy won four more world titles, and at the 2008 world championships, in Manchester, England, he laid the foundation for his Olympic success by winning the keirin (motor-paced) and individual sprint races. France won the team sprint, but the Great Britain trio of Hoy, Jamie Staff, and Jason Kenny avenged that defeat in Beijing, setting a world record of 42.950 sec to give Hoy the first of his three gold medals. Hoy’s victories in the team sprint, keirin, and individual sprint at the Beijing Games made him Scotland’s most successful Olympian, as well as the first Briton to win three gold medals in a single Olympics since swimmer Henry Taylor in 1908. In December 2008 Hoy was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Hoy did not compete in any of the major cycling events in 2009. In 2010 he won the keirin event at the world championships, which was his 10th career world title. He won the keirin at the world championships again in 2012. At that summer’s London Olympics, Hoy captured gold medals in the team sprint and keirin competitions to become the most-decorated British Olympian of all time, with six career golds and one silver; his medal total was surpassed by Bradley Wiggins in 2016.\n\nHoy retired from competitive cycling in 2013. He subsequently became involved in car racing, and in 2015 he won the European Le Mans Series LMP3 title. The following year he competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing 18th overall."
