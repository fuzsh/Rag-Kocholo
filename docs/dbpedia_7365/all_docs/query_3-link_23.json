        "text": "Hosting the Olympic Games – Top 3 Pros and Cons\n\nThe Olympic Games were first held in Olympia, Greece, in 776 BC as a religious festival to honor Zeus. The first Olympic Stadium was in an area thought to have been cleared when Zeus hurled down a lightning bolt. When not in use as a stadium for the Games the area (which never contained an actual building) was a wheat field.\n\nThe early games included sports for male athletes only such as pankration (a combination of boxing and wrestling with only two rules: no biting and no gouging), along with boxing, chariot racing, running, wrestling, and field events.\n\nPaul Christesen, professor of ancient Greek history at Dartmouth College, explains, “It is hard for us to exaggerate how important the Olympics were for the Greeks. The classic example is that when the Persians invaded Greece in the summer of 480 (BC) a lot of the Greek city states agreed that they would put together an allied army but they had a very hard time getting one together because so many people wanted to go to the Olympics. So, they actually had to delay putting the army together to defend the country against the Persians.”\n\nThe Games occurred every four years for 1,168 years from 776 BC to 393 AD, when they were ended by Emperor Theodosius I.\n\nA French nobleman, Pierre, baron de Coubertin, revived the Games after becoming interested in physical education. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in Apr. 1896 and included 241 athletes from 14 countries competing in 43 events.\n\nThe Games have been held since, with five canceled due to the world wars. The first modern Winter Games were held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Beginning with the Lillehammer Winter Olympics in 1994, Games were held every two years, alternating between Summer and Winter.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, were originally scheduled to begin on July 24, but were postponed due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) concerns to July 23 to Aug. 8, 2021 and were still referred to as Tokyo 2020. The Games were closed to foreign and domestic spectators and played under a COVID-19 state of emergency. The 2020 Games were the first time the Olympics were rescheduled in peacetime. Despite the delay, the 2020 Games debuted four new sports: karate, skateboard, sports climbing, and surfing. Baseball and softball returned for the first time since Beijing 2008.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2021, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics: “The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic games given [China’s] ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.” Australia, Canada, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom also announced diplomatic boycotts.\n\nThe Beijing 2022 Winter Games debuted seven new sports: freestyle skiing: mixed team aerials; freestyle skiing: men’s big air; freestyle skiing: women’s big air; short-track speedskating: mixed team relay; ski jumping: mixed team event; snowboarding: mixed team snowboard cross; and bobsled: women’s monobob.\n\nBreaking (breakdancing) and kayak cross will debut at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, which will include a total of 363 medal events in 45 sports.\n\nCricket, squash, flag-football, lacrosse, and baseball-softball will debut in Los Angeles, California, for the 2028 Summer Games.\n\nThe host cities for five future Games have been announced: Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter 2026, Los Angeles Summer 2028, the French Alps Winter 2030, Brisbane Summer 2032, and Salt Lake City Winter 2034.\n\nAre the Olympic Games an Overall Benefit for Their Host Countries and Cities?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n1. Would your city (or a nearby larger city) benefit from hosting the Olympic Games? Why or why not?\n\n2. What should happen with the Olympic sports facilities after the games are over? Explain your answer(s).\n\n3. How should international events such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic) impact the games? Explain your answer(s).\n\nTake Action\n\n1. Consider “7 Ways Hosting the Olympics Impacts a City,” at Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\n2. Explore the official Olympic Games site.\n\n3. Learn about the history of the Olympics, partially written by Harold Maurice Abrahams, subject of the Academy Award winning film Chariots of Fire.\n\n4. Consider how you felt about the issue before reading this article. After reading the pros and cons on this topic, has your thinking changed? If so, how? List two to three ways. If your thoughts have not changed, list two to three ways your better understanding of the “other side of the issue” now helps you better argue your position.\n\n5. Push for the position and policies you support by writing US national senators and representatives.\n\nSources"
