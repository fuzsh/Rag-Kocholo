        "text": "Michael Phelps (born June 30, 1985, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.) is an American swimmer, who is the most-decorated athlete in Olympic history with 28 medals, which include a record 23 gold. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, he became the first athlete to win eight gold medals at a single Olympics.\n\nPhelps was raised in a family of swimmers and joined the prestigious North Baltimore Aquatic Club at age seven. He finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. At the 2001 U.S. spring nationals, he became at age 15 the youngest world-record holder in men’s swimming when he posted 1 min 54.92 sec in the 200-meter butterfly. He went on that year to win his first international title at the world championships in Fukuoka, Japan. He claimed five medals at the 2002 Pan Pacific championships, including three gold (200-meter and 400-meter individual medley [IM] and 4 × 100-meter medley relay). At the U.S. spring nationals in 2003, he became the first male swimmer to claim titles in three different strokes at a single national championship, and he later broke an unprecedented five individual world records at the world championships in Barcelona, Spain. Phelps also captured five titles at the U.S. summer nationals—the most won by a male swimmer at a single championship.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nAt the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Phelps captured six gold medals (200-meter and 400-meter IM, 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly, 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay, and 4 × 100-meter medley relay) and two bronze medals (200-meter freestyle and 4 × 100-meter freestyle relay) while setting five Olympic or world records. His four individual swimming gold medals tied a record set by American Mark Spitz at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Phelps continued to dominate the sport at the 2007 world championships in Melbourne, where he won seven gold medals (200-meter and 400-meter IM, 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter freestyle, and 4 × 100-meter and 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay) and set five world records. With his seven titles, Phelps tied Spitz for most wins at a major international meet.\n\nPhelps entered the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing with the goal of breaking Spitz’s record of seven gold medals at one Olympics. He took the gold in each of his first three events—the 400-meter IM, the 4 × 100-meter freestyle relay, and the 200-meter freestyle—and each victory took place in world record time. On August 13 he won golds in the 200-meter butterfly and the 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay to capture his 10th and 11th career gold medals, a new Olympic record. Phelps then won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games by breaking his own world record in the 200-meter IM. He tied Spitz’s record by winning the 100-meter butterfly final by 0.01 second and broke the mark as a member of the victorious American 4 × 100-meter medley relay team. All told, Phelps set world records in all but one (the 100-meter butterfly) of his eight gold medal-winning events. He followed his record-setting Olympics with five golds (100-meter and 200-meter butterfly, 4 × 100-meter and 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay, and 4 × 100-meter medley relay) and a silver (200-meter freestyle) at the 2009 world championships in Rome.\n\nAt the 2012 Olympics in London, Phelps had a disappointing start, failing to medal in his first event, the 400-meter IM. However, he subsequently won silver medals in both the 4 × 100-meter freestyle relay and the 200-meter butterfly and a gold medal in the 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay. With the latter win, Phelps captured an unprecedented 19th career Olympic medal, surpassing the record set by Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. He also claimed gold in the 200-meter IM, becoming the first male swimmer to win the same individual event at three consecutive Olympics; he later won the 100-meter butterfly for the third consecutive time. Phelps, who had announced that he was retiring from the sport after the London Games, captured a gold medal in his final event, the 4 × 100-medley relay."
