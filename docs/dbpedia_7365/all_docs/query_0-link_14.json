        "text": "Salient piece from Les Earnest on the curious case of Alexi Grewal.\n\nIt starts with a revealing digression on testing at the Red Zinger / Coors Classic in the late 70s-early 80s with a most honorable mention of Phil Anderson:\n\n1984 was a banner year for cycling -- after a 72 year drought, U.S. riders won eight Olympic medals. It was the year that the U.S. Cycling Federation (USCF) adopted detailed medical control regulations for the first time. It was also a year of unsurpassed political skullduggery among the officers and directors of the Federation.\n\nUp until then, USCF drug testing regulations said, in effect, “Thou shalt not take drugs,” but specified no testing procedure. I was working on more complete drug testing regulations when an incident just before the Olympics pointed up inadequacies in the drug testing program. The sixth stage of the Coors International Bicycle Classic that year was a circuit road race in Aspen, Colorado, which was also the home town of rider Alexi Grewal, who tested positive for a prohibited substance after that race. This was an awkward situation because he was a member of the U.S. Olympic Team.\n\nAs I eventually figured out, no riders could have tested positive at the Coors race before 1983, even though drug testing was required by international regulations. I had started officiating there in 1978 when this race was still called the Red Zinger. There was a great show made of medical control in the Red Zinger/Coors. Top finishers and a few other riders selected at random in each race had to provide urine specimens under the surveillance of a race official. I found it remarkable that no one ever tested positive, given that there are many non-prescription drugs that contain prohibited substances. In fact, after a couple of years of this, I asked UCI International Commissaire Artie Greenberg how the riders managed to keep so clean. His reply was, “Don't ask.”\n\nOf course, I immediately became more inquisitive and eventually learned that the promoter was unwilling or unable to pay for lab tests. Instead, after urine samples were collected, they were carefully flushed down the nearest toilet. While the “toilet test” was a great waste of time for all involved, it helped keep up the pretense that this was a “clean race” and probably deterred some riders who didn't know about the testing procedures.\n\nOne rider managed to get suspended for failing the “toilet test.” This happened to Australian Phil Anderson in 1978 in Vail when he was distracted by a young lady's invitation to visit her place just after he won the race and somehow didn't return to take the test. As near as I can tell, the toilet test continued to be used at the Coors race through 1982. Real testing was carried out for at least some stages beginning in 1983, when rider Mike King of Ohio got caught for ingesting ephedrine.\n\nList of winners of the Red Zinger/Coors Classic:\n\n1975 John Howard United States Hannah North United States\n\n1976 John Howard United States No women's race\n\n1977 Wayne Stetina United States Connie Carpenter United States\n\n1978 George Mount United States Keetie van Oosten-Hage Netherlands\n\n1979 Dale Stetina United States Keetie van Oosten-Hage Netherlands\n\n1980 Jonathan Boyer United States Beth Heiden United States\n\n1981 Greg LeMond United States Keetie van Oosten-Hage Netherlands\n\n1982 Patrocinio Jimenez Colombia Connie Carpenter United States\n\n1983 Dale Stetina United States Rebecca Twigg United States\n\n1984 Doug Shapiro United States Maria Canins Italy\n\n1985 Greg LeMond United States Jeannie Longo France\n\n1986 Bernard Hinault France Jeannie Longo France\n\n1987 Raúl Alcalá Mexico Jeannie Longo France\n\n1988 Davis Phinney United States Inga Thompson United States\n\nFrom Wheelmen on Eddie B (part I):\n\nBorysewicz’s life in Poland had revolved around cycling. He joined the Polish national team as a teenager, won national championships, and traveled around Europe competing in bike races. As he moved up through the ranks of cycling in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he thought maybe the life of a professional athlete wasn’t so bad. Poland was then a hotbed of cycling, and the sport was fully supported by the Soviet-dominated Communist government.\n\n...\n\nBorysewicz had a sense of curiosity. He had always been a good student, though he had delayed university education to become a cyclist. Soon after his misdiagnosis, he enrolled in the Academy of Physical Education in Warsaw to study physiology and exercise science, an extremely prestigious field in Communist Poland. He continued to race on the Polish national cycling team, but focused more on his studies. Other riders called him professor. At the university, he took a position coaching the junior national team.\n\nHe came up with individual training plans for the cyclists and he kept detailed diaries of their performance and fitness levels and the progress they made in response to his training regimens. He was conducting what was essentially a scientific experiment on some of the finest athletes in Poland to learn the best methods of training. Some of the riders were conducting their own experiments—with drugs. They told him about the various types of amphetamines and hormones they took to be able to compete at a higher level, yet they would always downplay their importance. “Oh, it’s just a vitamin,” they would say, or “Oh, it’s something for my heartburn.” Eddie would take mental notes of the names of the drugs and then look them up in an old medical book. He discovered that many of them had dangerous side effects. Sometimes, if the rider was someone he particularly liked, he would show him the book and make him read about the terrible damage the drugs could do.\n\nSoon Borysewicz was one of the top athletic coaches in Poland, in charge of developing young talent to feed the Olympic ranks. But as an employee of the state, he didn’t earn much. To bring in some spending money for his family, he also worked as a tour guide. Life was good enough, but after he learned about his wife’s affair, he decided he had to leave. The Polish government gave him permission to attend the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics as a spectator. He flew into JFK and had planned to drive to Montreal. He never did\n\nWheelmen on Eddie B (part II):\n\nBy late 1977, he was schooling the best cyclists in the tri-state area. Before Borysewicz, most of the cyclists in the area rode hard all summer and then got completely out of shape as the weather got cold. Borysewicz explained to them that winter was the best time to lift weights and build up the muscles needed for bike racing. Weight training was anathema. They thought if their muscles got too big, it would weigh them down and make their bodies inflexible. Cycling was about endurance, not strength.\n\nTo prove his point, Borysewicz showed Fraysse and some of the other riders the training diaries of some of the top cyclists in Poland, including Ryszard Szurkowski, who had just won the world championship in the road race and the time trial. This would have been the equivalent of opening Lance Armstrong’s training diary and showing his secret workout plans—had there been a cyclist of that caliber in the States at the time, which of course there was not. Szurkowski’s winter training plan included dozens of weight-lifting sessions and running. The Americans thought it looked more like the training plan for a decathlete than a cyclist. But, convinced by then that Borysewicz knew what he was talking about, they began meeting up with him at a new, state-of-the art gym in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Borysewicz developed individual training plans for the riders, demonstrated weight-training techniques to them, and told them to keep diaries. The regimen worked. Many members of the North Jersey Bicycle Club who trained with Borysewicz had better results in 1977 than they had ever before achieved.\n\nFraysse thought that if Borysewicz could have such great results with the North Jersey Bicycle Club in such a short period of time, he might be able to boost the performance of the country’s Olympic cyclists, too. Fraysse and Borysewicz came up with an idea: They’d put together a junior training camp for Olympic hopefuls in Squaw Valley, California, which had hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics and whose Olympic training facilities were free for use in the summer months. The camp was advertised largely through word of mouth, at bike shops and cycling clubs.\n\nWheelmen on Eddie B (part III):\n\nBorysewicz took on LeMond as a special project, keeping in contact after the summer, sending him training plans and updating them as he learned more about LeMond’s unique physiology. He acted as another father for LeMond...\n\nAt each training camp, Borysewicz explained to the young cyclists the core principles of training: The body’s fitness level, he said, is constantly peaking and recovering. With periods of intense exercise, the body responds to the stress by increasing its blood volume, lowering its resting heart rate, and priming its cells for a more intense workload. But a body can remain at this peak level only for roughly two or three weeks before it begins to slow down so that it can rebuild itself and recover. The key to training for races, he explained, is to schedule the training so that the rider is peaking at race time.\n\nMuch of what Borysewicz taught the riders was common knowledge in Europe, but in the United States it was revolutionary—and the effects started to be seen. In 1979, when LeMond was eighteen, Borysewicz took him to Argentina for the junior world championships, a race held to determine the best rider in the world under the age of nineteen. Competitors for the title ride on national teams, just as they do in the Olympics. LeMond won the race convincingly, beating the best riders from Russia and from the cycling meccas of Belgium and France. This was arguably the best international racing result any modern American cyclist had ever achieved.\n\nWheelmen explaining USOC's internal testing system, early 80s:\n\nAfter the 1980 Olympics, the Americans realized they were behind in the pharmacology department. The general feeling within the US Olympic Committee, which oversees all sports, was that if the Soviets were doping, the Americans needed to do it, too. It was practically a matter of national security. In 1982, the US Olympic Committee funded a laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles, to develop new tests for detecting steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Those tests would be used at the 1984 Olympics. Americans would have the advantage in 1984 because they would know exactly which tests were being used during the games and how they worked. The USOC used the UCLA lab to conduct “informal testing,” whereby athletes could voluntarily submit to testing and get the results without facing any consequences. That allowed athletes to see how long the particular drugs stayed in their systems, useful information as well. This was the American version of the state-sponsored doping programs in other countries—the difference being that the US Olympic Committee wasn’t part of the government, and no American athlete was forced to use drugs.\n\nBorysewicz trained his team hard during those four years. He brought his team to Europe for international competitions and, for the first time in history, the United States was consistently winning international cycling events. He also began working his connections in East Germany to get top-level cycling equipment smuggled into the United States.\n\nbriefly back to the Coors Classic, where, according to the previously cited Les Earnest, nobody could have ever tested positive before 1983 because the testing was totally rigged.\n\nLemond won the race in 1981.\n\nHere's his account of the race:\n\nAnd then just shortly after that we flew back with the Renault team to the Coors Classic which had the Russian Olympic Gold Medalist.\n\nCB: Soukouroutchenkov?\n\nGL: Soukouroutchenkov and Barinov [1980 Olympic bronze medallist] and the whole Russian team, which for me was, for me, a test to see who would have been the Olympic champion. This was my real revenge on missing the Olympics. I can't believe we actually boycotted the Olympics because they invaded Afghanstan. We've invaded 2 countries and nobody has boycotted anything right now.\n\nThat race I ended up winning, I don't know how much time I took out of Soukouroutchenkov, something like 10 minutes. We went head to head. Me against 4 Russians on the Morgul Bismark course. They tried every which way to drop me and every time they would attack I'd chase one guy down. I would slow down just before I caught him. And then as the other group caught up, just before they caught up I'd do an attack and drop everybody. Then I'd slow down and then when they would catch me they'd send somebody off and the immediately I'd go after him.\n\nI just played this game with them and they couldn't drop me and I ended up second in that stage. I won that race. That was my big victory for '81, the Coors Classic.\n\nhttp://www.bikeraceinfo.com/oralhistory/lemond.html\n\nSo:\n\n- no testing at the race\n\n- Lemond comfortably beating a bunch of doped-to-the-gills Russians (and 'doped-to-the-gills' is an understatement)\n\n- right in a period when according to Wheelmen (see previous post) Borysewicz and his team were experimenting with drugs with USOC's backing\n\nto be continued.\n\nNow then, the story of blood doping among US cyclists is about to take an interesting twist.\n\nEnter Danny Van Haute:\n\nIn the wake of the 1984 scandal, Franky Van Haute, father of Danny (one of the cyclists who had admitted to blooddoping), gave this comment:\n\n...The elder Van Haute supplied Danny's phone number, but he wasn't available for comment. Neither were the other implicated medalists. But Van Haute's father explained that Danny first had learned of the procedure [i.e. blood transfusions; sniper] during a trip to Poland with the Junior Team.\n\nhttp://articles.mcall.com/1985-01-12/sports/2463039_1_blood-doping-olympic-trials-elder\n\nAs you can see, Van Haute doesn't specify what year that junior event in Poland took place.\n\nWhen I posted this in the Lemond thread the other day, I assumed that it must have been under Eddie B. somewhere in the late 70s or early 80s. However, pcmg76 correctly counter-argued that Van Hauten couldn't have been on the Junior Team under Borysewicz in those years, simply because he would have been too old to be a junior (Danny was born 1956).\n\nAnd pcmg76 was right: Danny Van Hauten was on the US Junior team much earlier, in 1974.\n\nNow, look where the young lads went that year:\n\nVan Haute already had had a decade of bicycle-racing when he decided five years ago [i.e. in 1974; sniper] to concentrate on the sport; that was the summer he graduated from Gordon Tech, where he lettered in hockey and cross-country, and made the team representing U.S. junior-class riders at the world championships in Poland. http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/08/05/page/230/article/pedaling-the-banked-track-to-glory#text\n\nSo, US Cycling Juniors, doing transfusions in Poland, in 1974 already.....?\n\nRemember what Les Earnest said wrt blood doping in the US, mid-70s:\n\nFor example, the U.S. Olympic Committee claimed that they had a rule against blood doping whereas in fact there was none. There had been strong evidence of blood doping in the Olympics since at least 1976 but because they didn't have a good laboratory test for it they buried their heads in the sand and pretended it wasn't happening. http://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/cyclops/dopestrong.htm\n\nThe birth of, and some background on, Montgomery Securities:\n\nIn 1971, he joined the investment bank Robertson, Colman & Siebel, in San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, the firm took several venture-backed tech companies—including Applied Materials—public. With guidance from his friend Bloomberg, then running the Salomon Brothers equity trading desk in New York, Weisel added a profitable trading desk. But when investment banking hit a slump, the firm’s trading operation grew bigger, and Weisel, who was the junior partner and the most aggressive, began to battle with his partners over profits. In 1978, Weisel became CEO of the firm, and the partners split up. Weisel changed the name of the firm to Montgomery Securities—after Montgomery Street in downtown San Francisco. Because Montgomery was a relatively young firm, competing with giant New York investment banks, Weisel tried to build a culture that rewarded entrepreneurial drive. He believed in “equity upside” and “huge profit participation.” He viewed himself to be a “frustrated athlete,” and liked to hire and fraternize with those who were also competitive in sports. After he took up running, for instance, he brought in his running coach as Montgomery’s personnel director—and formed a corporate running team that won a series of national championships over the course of a decade. Montgomery placed ads in running magazines, seeking women runners interested in working in financial services—a way to fill out the corporate women’s running team for corporate challenge cup races. One of the women who answered the ad wound up as Weisel’s second wife. He firmly believed that success in sports would bring success in business and life, too.\n\n(excerpt from Wheelmen)\n\neporesis said:\n\nYou forgot Simes, Eustice, and Fred Megoni, essentially the other side of the battle with Fraysee/USCF.\n\nFWIW, Reed probably got all the Eddie B stuff from Eddie and Mike F. It's a touching portrait, brings a tear to my eye. Bad, bad, Ed Burke. I speculate it was horses for courses with Eddy B. Or horse drugs, in the case of the ever vanishing Thom. But Eddie's juniors had nothing bad to say about him, even, if memory serves, he did hand them over to real creeps like Carmicheal and Angus Fraser.\n\nAs far as Walden is concerned, there was zero evidence of drugs through the 80s, if some petty corruption and favoritism. All skills and tactics. I think he would have exiled the first person to show up with a PM.\n\nWhile Eddie may not have messed with the juniors, he had no problem jacking up Montgomery Subuaru's team. I've mentioned before about misbehavior at Thom's Park City house where they trained prior to the US Olympic trials. Lance was first in line and showed early \"pro\" attitude. Having raced against Weisel and the usual 5 other guys in the age group at Masters Natz my opinion is not all were dirty, not all were clean. They gladly took his support money, though.\n\nWhat's new? Thom has a big compound in Sun Valley. He's a very big supporter of the US Ski team. Thom's son is on the US Ski team. You'd think USSA could find another rich dude to take money from to avoid the stank.\n\nOldermanish said:\n\n...\n\nWhile Eddie may not have messed with the juniors, he had no problem jacking up Montgomery Subuaru's team.

I think many sections of Wheelmen suggest such redrafting post legal read.\n\nAnd so one is left reading between the lines quite a bit. But doing so, one of the things I took from that second chapter on Eddie B is that he brought all his Eastern Block doping skills to US Cycling. And the chapter is in fact quite unambiguous about Eddie B's 'training' programs whilst still in Poland, with explicit references to amphetamines and hormones and him supervising a guy like Ryszard Szurkowski (who it is not difficult to do the math on). And then of course we have 1984, but even more so the years leading up to those Games, with USOC implementing some kind of internal testing system allowing free PED experimentation. I mean, reading all that, you gotta make such a leap of faith to assume Eddie didn't have a direct hand in doping juniors. And as we know he was interested particularly in recruiting and guiding juniors. Or am i being too cynical here?\n\nThe other thing I take away from Wheelmen is, as you suggest, that Lance was doped for Triathlons as a teenager and that his mother and step dad were completely in on what he did and highly supportive of it. Whether EPO was already in the mix is a different question.\n\nwhat do you think?"
