        "text": "Team USA finished in the lead when it came to the total medal count at the end of the Tokyo Olympics, with 113 medals overall. The United States also won the most gold medals at a final count of 39, beating China's gold medal count by one.\n\nOver 100 athletes with ties to Southern California participated in the Games this summer, including some of those medal-winners. Some train in the area, while others have called SoCal home for years.\n\nThis year's list of local Olympians rounds out the end of the games with 63 medals won, from 55 athletes with SoCal ties who made it to the Olympic podium.\n\nThis total number of medals won counts each athlete individually, even in team sports, and counts each medal won by those athletes separately.\n\nGold Medalists\n\nMen's 4x100m Freestyle Swimming Relay\n\nTeam USA won the gold in the men's freestyle swimming relay, and two of the team's members train at the Mission Viejo Nadadores Swim Club:\n\nZach Apple\n\nThis swimmer, who hails from Ohio, had a blistering 46.69 anchor leg in the relay, allowing the U.S. to touch more than a second ahead of Italy, which took silver.\n\nBlake Pieroni\n\nPieroni, from Indiana, and his mid-47 leg in the middle of the race helped Team USA pull ahead of France.\n\nMen's 4x100m Medley Swimming Relay\n\nTeam USA won gold again in the men's medley swimming relay, in a performance that broke a world record set 12 years ago.\n\nMichael Andrew\n\nAndrew's performance during the breaststroke leg of the race helped produce one of the fastest splits of the race. The Encinitas native worked alongside his teammates Ryan Murphy of Illinois and Caeleb Dressel of Florida, as well as Zach Apple.\n\nApple and Pieroni won gold once again. Apple swam the anchor freestyle leg during the gold-medal race, while Pieroni won a medal due to his role as an anchor during the preliminary heats.\n\nTom Shields\n\nThis native of Huntington Beach also won gold for his contributions during the preliminary heats, where he swam the butterfly leg of the race.\n\nMen's Individual Golf\n\nTeam USA won its second-ever Olympic gold in golf on Sunday.\n\nXander Schauffele\n\nThis San Diego native who played for Long Beach State his freshman year of college before transferring to San Diego State University, won after shooting 4-under par in the final round, finishing the tournament 18-under.\n\nHe joins Charles Sands as the other of only two Americans to win Olympic gold in golf.\n\nSydney McLaughlin\n\nThe Playa Vista resident, who trains in Los Angeles, broke the world record for fastest time in the women's 400m hurdle event, winning the gold for Team USA. Her new record time of 51.46 shaved nearly a half second off her own world record from the U.S. Trials, which made her the first 400m hurdler to go under 52.\n\nMcLaughlin qualified for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro at age 16, making her the youngest track and field Olympian at the time since 1976.\n\nWomen's 4x400m Relay\n\nSydney McLaughlin won a second gold medal in Tokyo, as part of the women's 4x400m relay team.\n\nAllyson Felix, a Los Angeles native and another member of that team, became the most decorated U.S. Olympic track athlete of all time with her gold medal from the event.\n\nDalilah Muhammad, USC graduate, also won gold with the relay team, after winning silver in the 400m hurdle event.\n\nKendall Ellis, also of USC, also won gold for the relay event, for finishing first in the preliminary events.\n\nDiana Taurasi\n\nThe native of Chino was part of the seventh straight gold-winning women's basketball team. The victory against Japan marked another win for Team USA, which has not lost an Olympic basketball game since 1992.\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nThis Los Angeles native and UCLA graduate was part of the gold-winning men's basketball team. The team beat France 87-82, to snag its fourth straight gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nWomen's Beach Volleyball\n\nSoCal's beach volleyball A-Team went undefeated in Tokyo, winning the gold medal against Australia 21-15, 21-16 after an unbroken chain of other wins.\n\nApril Ross, Costa Mesa native and graduate of USC, won her third Olympic medal in the game.\n\nAlix Klineman, Manhattan Beach resident and Ross's volleyball partner, won her first Olympic medal in the game, as a first-time Olympic athlete in Tokyo.\n\nWomen's Volleyball\n\nThe U.S. Women's Volleyball team won its first-ever gold medal in Tokyo, defeating Brazil 25-21, 25-20 and 25-14 to claim victory. That win came with help from three women with SoCal ties:\n\nKim Hill, an outside hitter and graduate of Pepperdine University who won bronze in Rio in 2016;\n\nKelsey Robinson, another outside hitter and a native of Manhattan Beach, and\n\nJustine Wong-Orantes, libero from Cypress, California and first-time Olympian in Tokyo.\n\nMen's 4x400m Relay\n\nTeam USA's men's relay team earned the first men's track gold medal in track and field at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMichael Norman, Murrieta native and USC graduate, won gold while helping to hold off Botswana for the first three legs.\n\nRai Benjamin, the USC graduate who won silver in Tokyo's 400m hurdle event, crossed the finish line well ahead of the pack in the final leg, winning the gold.\n\nWomen's Water Polo\n\nTeam USA's women's water polo team won its third consecutive gold medal, a three-peat streak kept alive since the tournament was introduced in 2000. The victory against Spain came from a team dominated by women from SoCal, including:\n\nAlys Williams, a Huntington Beach native and UCLA graduate;\n\nAmanda Longan, USC graduate from Moorpark;\n\nAria Fischer, who hails from Laguna Beach and is sister to;\n\nMakenzie Fischer, Aria's older sister and another Laguna Beach Native\n\nAshleigh Johnson, a resident of Seal Beach;\n\nMaddie Musselman, a UCLA graduate from Newport Beach;\n\nMaddie Steffens, resident of Long Beach;\n\nPaige Hauschild, USC graduate from Santa Barbara;\n\nRachel Fattal, Seal Beach native and UCLA graduate, and;\n\nStephania Haralabidis, USC graduate.\n\nSilver Medalists\n\nTeam USA Softball\n\nThe Olympic softball team won silver after Japan beat the undefeated team 2-0 during the gold medal match.\n\nTeam USA won the 2018 Women’s World Championship, and were favorites to win the tournament.\n\nGoing into the gold medal game, U.S. softball was undefeated, thanks in part to the skills of seven women from SoCal:\n\nAlly Carda, UCLA grad from Elk Grove outside Sacramento;\n\nRachel Garcia, Palmdale native and UCLA graduate from the Class of 2021;\n\nDejah Mulipola, Garden Grove native and Pacifica High School grad;\n\nAubree Munroe, Brea native and Brea Olinda High School grad;\n\nMadilyn \"Bubba\" Nickles, also a UCLA graduate from the Class of 2021;\n\nJanie Reed, Placentia native, El Dorado High School grad and wife of Dodgers player Jake Reed, and;\n\nDelaney Spaulding, Rancho Cucamonga native, Etiwanda High School grad and member of UCLA's Class of 2017.\n\nMen's Baseball\n\nTeam USA's baseball team was shut out by host nation Japan in the gold-medal game, with the same score on the same field as the first game between the two countries eleven days earlier. Two players with ties to SoCal helped secure the silver medal:\n\nAnthony Gose, native of Bellflower, graduate of Bellflower High School, and player for the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and;\n\nTim Federowicz, player for the Oklahoma City Dodgers baseball team, a minor-league baseball team and affiliate of the LA Dodgers.\n\nJessica Springsteen\n\nThe daughter of famous rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialifa, a Los Angeles native, helped the U.S. Equestrian team earn silver in the team jumping event.\n\nSabine Shut-Kery\n\nThe equestrian dressage silver medalist is from Krefeld, Germany, but trains in Thousand Oaks, where she operates a boutique dressage training business.\n\nPreviously, Shut-Kery has competed internationally as a Grand Prix rider and trainer. In 2018, she earned a spot on the U.S. Nations Cup team, which won gold.\n\nHer winning Tokyo performance came during her first-ever appearance in the Olympics.\n\nKatie McLaughlin\n\nThe Dana Point native and graduate of Santa Margarita Catholic High School was the starting member of the team that won silver in the women's freestyle 4x200m swimming relay.\n\nThe silver-medal victory was during McLaughlin's first time in the Olympics. She finished fourth at this year’s Olympic Trials, overcoming a neck injury that prevented her from competing in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nWorking with teammates Katie Ledecky, Allison Schmidt and Paige Madden, she was able to swim \"lights out,\" according to Ledecky, to pull the team up to second place behind China.\n\nAbbey Weitzeil\n\nThe Saugus native and graduate of Saugus High School and UC Berkeley won a silver medal with the rest of the women's 4x100m medley relay team.\n\nAustralian relay legend Cate Campbell chased her down, despite Team USA's .25 lead, but Weitzeil still managed to clinch the silver medal alongside teammates Regan Smith, Lydia Jacoby and Torri Huske.\n\nWeitzeil also won a bronze medal, listed below, with her team during the women's 4x100m freestyle relay.\n\nRai Benjamin\n\nIn his Olympic debut in Tokyo, Benjamin's 400m men's hurdle race time of 46.17 broke the previous world record, and won him the silver medal. However, even after his Aug. 3 victory, Benjamin is not the current world record holder.\n\nBenjamin's Norwegian competitor, Karsten Warholm, set the original 46.78 record one month ago. Though Benjamin's time in Tokyo beat that number, Warholm's staggeringly fast 45.94 race beat his own previous record and won him the gold, making for a historic race.
