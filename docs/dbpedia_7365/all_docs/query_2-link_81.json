        "text": "Pinned\n\nKatie Ledecky 'so honored to represent our country'\n\nKatie Ledecky was proud to be able to represent the United States on the Olympic stage and expressed it as much after she won the 1,500-meter freestyle in dominant fashion.\n\nLedecky tied the Olympic record with eight gold medals and 12 medals overall as she won the race by more than 10 seconds. She set a new Olympic record time as well at 15:30.02.\n\n\"I’m just so honored to represent our country,\" Ledecky told NBC’s Melissa Stark on Wednesday night. \"Those women who have set the standard for so many years have inspired me. They inspired me when I first started swimming. Thank you to them and thank you to everyone who has supported me for all those years.\"\n\nIt was the second medal for Ledecky overall. She won a bronze in the 400-meter freestyle over the weekend. She could potentially break the overall mark set by Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres in the 800-meter freestyle. Thompson and Ledecky are also tied for most gold medals.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Gaydos\n\nPosted by Ryan Gaydos Share\n\nWhat is the Olympic motto?\n\nThe Olympic motto comes from before the official Olympic Games began.\n\nThe original motto was first said in 1881 by the Dominican priest Henri Didon in the opening ceremony of a sports event.\n\nIn Latin, the motto is, “Citius, Altius, Fortius.” In English that translates to “Faster, Higher, Stronger.”\n\nPierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympic movement, was in the crowd for Didon’s speech and adopted those words as the Olympic motto in 1894.\n\n“It expresses the aspirations of the Olympic Movement,” the IOC said. “Not only in its athletic and technical sense but also from a moral and educational perspective.”\n\nThe motto was changed during a session of the International Olympic Committee in July of 2021.\n\nIt now reads in Latin, “Citius, Altius, Fortius – Communiter.” Which in English translates to “Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together.”\n\nThe change was made to recognize the “unifying power of sport and the importance of solidarity.”\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nJoel Embiid sits in USA's win over South Sudan\n\nOne game after Team USA head coach Steve Kerr called himself an \"idiot\" for not playing Jayson Tatum in the Olympic opener against Serbia, he had another player not see an ounce of playing time - this one was an MVP.\n\nJoel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers star center, was a starter against Serbia, but he was replaced by Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis in the 103-86 victory over South Sudan on Wednesday in Paris.\n\nEmbiid was the only player on Team USA to not see an ounce of playing time in the first half, let alone the entire game, against South Sudan, a scrappy bunch that gave the Stars and Stripes fits during their exhibition game this month.\n\nEmbiid, who opted to play for the United States while also having eligibility for France and his home country, Cameroon, was deadpan on the Team USA bench throughout the game, as the broadcast picked up.\n\nInstead of substituting for Davis off the bench, Kerr called on Bam Adebayo to relieve him. Adebayo played 21 minutes and led the U.S. in points with 18 on 8-of-10 shooting, along with seven rebounds, two blocks and one steal.\n\nEmbiid was the NBA’s leading scorer last season, averaging 33 points per game for the Sixers, but he struggled in the team’s opener against Serbia. He only played 11 minutes, going 2-for-5 from the field for four points while going 0-for-3 from the free throw line. He had just two rebounds as well.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Scott Thompson.\n\nPosted by Scott Thompson Share\n\nHow expensive is it to host the Olympics?\n\nHow expensive is it to host the Olympics? In short, quite expensive.\n\nParis has already spent $9.7 billion on Olympic expenses, and the French taxpayers are paying for about $3.25 billion of that according to The Associated Press.\n\nThere is no guarantee you end up making that money back either.\n\nThe IOC projects Paris’ will receive $12.2 billion of economic benefit from these games, leaving them in the black should they come true.\n\nThe IOC says that the “economic benefits for the city, region, and country and predicted to far outweigh the Games-related investments.\n\nYet the numbers from past games tell a different story.\n\nIn 2012, London spent $14.6 billion and generated $5.2 billion. In 2010, Vancouver spent $7.6 billion yet only brought in $2.8 billion.\n\nIn 2008, Beijing spent a whopping $42 billion and only brought in $3.6 million.\n\nAccording to the University of Oxford, every Olympics since 1960 – except for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles – has been over budget by an average of 172%.\n\nThe reason the 1984 Olympics were profitable for Los Angeles was because most of the infrastructure required for the Games were already built.\n\nA lot of cities that were over their budget built brand new stadiums for the Olympic Games. Those stadiums have been seldom used since the Games left their respective cities.\n\nParis has only built one competitive venue for the 2024 Games, relying on previously built infrastructure and temporary venues to avoid having to build so many new venues.\n\nTime will tell if the 2024 Paris Games can join the 1984 Los Angeles Games as being the only Olympics that has been profitable in the last 64 years.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nSimone Biles' social media feud with former teammate continues after winning gold\n\nBlock by block, Simone Biles is building an unforgettable Paris Olympics resume. She added another big block to it on Wednesday.\n\nIn an Instagram post featuring a collage of photos from Tuesday's competition, she appeared to reference a comment from former American Olympic gymnast MyKayla Skinner with a caption that read \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions.\"\n\nAfter making light of Skinner's comments with her Instagram post, Biles later sent a post that read, \"oop I’ve been blocked,\" on X on Wednesday.\n\nCurrently, Biles and Skinner are not following each other on X or on Instagram.\n\nShortly after making the comments about this year's team, Skinner posted a video defending her comments on Instagram Stories, saying that she had been \"misinterpreted or misunderstood.\" She later posted an apology note on her Instagram page to Biles and the rest of the team.\n\n\"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work,\" Skinner's statement said, in part.\n\nBiles later appeared to respond in a post on Threads that read, \"[N]ot everyone needs a mic and a platform.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Jackson Thompson.\n\nPosted by Jackson Thompson Share\n\nKatie Ledecky warns Team USA is ‘heating up’ in thank you message to fans\n\nExpect more medals, Olympic swimming legend Katie Ledecky said as she thanked fans for their support in a video message shared on social media following a big night in the pool.\n\n“Thanks so much for the support tonight and all week, we’re feeling the love and Team USA is heating up,” Ledecky said in the message shared by USA swimming on X. “Let’s go USA!”\n\nThe United States leads the total medal count with 30 Olympic medals. Ledecky’s gold medal in the women’s 1500-meter freestyle on Wednesday night raised the American’s gold medal count to five.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nWhen were the Olympic Games last held in Paris?\n\nThe last time the Olympics were held in Paris was exactly a century ago in 1924.\n\nIn those games, there were 126 trials for 17 sports. Just 135 of the 3,089 athletes that competed were women.\n\nThe Olympic Games were starting to gain more relevance globally, as 44 countries sent representatives to Paris. All continents were represented in the 1924 Olympic games.\n\nThe 1924 Games were historic because it was the first Games where the Olympic Village was built. Later that year, in the winter of 1924, France was host to the first ever Winter Olympics. The competitions held in Chamonix are considered the inaugural Winter Olympic Games.\n\nThe history of Paris and the Olympics dates back further than 1924.\n\nGreece was the host of the first Olympics, but Paris hosted the second ever Olympic Games in 1900.\n\nIn fact, they were not even called the Olympics yet. “The Games of the II Olympiad” took place over the course of five months from May to October 1900.\n\nThe Paris 2024 games will make history as well: they will be the first carbon-neutral games, and the first gender-equal games.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nYoung USA fan goes viral for reaction to Katie Ledecky after gold medal swim\n\nKatie Ledecky has always been a fan favorite, but one young fan experienced an unforgettable moment after Ledecky took home the gold medal with ease in the women's 1500-meter freestyle on Wednesday night.\n\nVideo of the young girl gripping an American flag and shouting after Ledecky left the pool deck has gone viral on social media.\n\n\"She waved at me,\" the young girl appeared to say before sitting back down in shock.\n\nLedecky's official time of 15:30.02 broke the Olympic record in the event – a record she previously set at the Tokyo Games. It also marked her 8th gold medal, tying her for the most won by an American woman.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nSimone Biles 'blocked' after taking shot at former Olympic teammate\n\nBlock by block, Simone Biles is building an unforgettable Paris Olympics resume. She added another big block to it on Wednesday.\n\nAfter leading the U.S. women's gymnastics team to a gold medal and becoming the most decorated American gymnast in Olympics history, Biles made sure certain people didn't forget it.\n\nIn an Instagram post featuring a collage of photos from Tuesday's competition, she appeared to reference a comment from former American Olympic gymnast MyKayla Skinner with a caption that read \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions.\"\n\nPrior to the start of the Paris Olympics, Skinner said, \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t like what it used to be. Just notice, like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don’t work as hard. The girls just don’t have the work ethic,\" in a since-deleted YouTube video, according to the New York Post.\n\nAfter making light of Skinner's comments with her Instagram post, Biles later sent a post that read, \"oop I’ve been blocked,\" on X on Wednesday.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Jackson Thompson.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nUSWNT remains undefeated through group stages with 2-1 win over Australia\n\nThe U.S. women’s soccer team was already through to the quarterfinals, but they continued their domination through the group stages to remain undefeated with a 2-1 win over Australia on Wednesday.\n\nTrinity Rodman got Team USA on the board first with a goal in the 43rd minute and Korbin Albert sealed their victory with another score in the 77th minute.\n\nThe U.S. advanced out of the group stages with nine goals, the most in for the program in Olympic history. The United States is the winningest team at the Olympics, with four gold medals in women’s soccer – a streak they’re hoping to continue under new coach Emma Hayes.\n\nThey will next play Japan on Saturday at Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nBreaking News\n\nKatie Ledecky breaks Olympic record with gold medal finish in women’s 1500m freestyle\n\nKatie Ledecky has further proved herself as the best long distance swimmer in the game after a dominating win in the women's 1500-meter freestyle final on Wednesday night.\n\nLedecky's official time of 15:30.02 broke the Olympic record in the event – a record she previously set at the Tokyo Games. Ledecky owns the top 20 times in the women’s 1500m free and Wednesday’s time ranks eighth overall.\n\nWednesday marks Ledecky’s eighth Olympic gold medal, tying the most won by an American woman and the most overall Olympic medals won by an American woman (12). She still has a chance to break those records with the 800-meter freestyle and the 4x200-meter freestyle relay.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nBreaking News\n\nTeam USA’s Torri Huske picks up third medal of Paris Olympics in women’s 100m freestyle\n\nTorri Huske has earned her third medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics with a silver medal finish in the women’s 100-meter freestyle on Wednesday, missing the gold by just thirteen hundredths of a second.\n\nSarah Sjostrom of Sweden, the current world record holder in this event, was not the favorite heading into Wednesday’s final, but pulled out a shocking victory in the final meters of the race.\n\nHuske, 21, won silver as a member of Team USA’s women’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay and an individual gold medal in the women’s 100-meter butterfly.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nDanielle Collins points the finger at Olympic organizers after withdrawing from women’s singles\n\nDanielle Collins, the final American tennis player competing in the women’s singles in Paris, withdrew from her quarterfinal match against Iga Swiatek in the third set on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Collins said she cramped and went into convulsions because of dehydration and exhaustion after competing in heat that reached 97 degrees on Tuesday.\n\nShe went on to blame Olympics organizers for not having insulated water bottles, for the water not being cool enough, and for not “prioritizing the health of the athletes.”\n\nPolish tennis player Iga Swiatek, who was hit by a shot while up at the net, moves on with the hopes of capturing her first Olympic medal.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nParis streets littered with bicycle crashes during Olympics triathlon amid wet conditions\n\nThe cycling leg of the women's triathlon at the Paris Olympics descended into a flurry of bicycle crashes on Wednesday as competitors slipped across wet cobblestone.\n\nThe conditions for the event featured rainstorms, heat and humidity. It resulted in several competitors being unable to control their bicycles around various turns on the cobblestone roads of Paris, as several athletes crashed and fell onto the ground.\n\nGuam's Manami Iijima was the first athlete to crash, and her tumble was soon followed by Brazil's Vittoria Lopes, Germany's Lisa Tertsch and Belgium's Jolien Vermeylen.\n\nSome athletes even withdrew from the competition due to the constant crashing, including Norwegian athlete Lotte Miller, who withdrew from the event after crashing and falling off her bicycle twice.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Jackson Thompson.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nFormer opponent of Olympic boxer in gender eligibility controversy speaks out\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif’s participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics despite being disqualified in the 2023 World Championships over gender eligibility concerns raised questions at the start of the Summer Games.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee cleared Khelif to compete, but that did not stop Olympic viewers from expressing outrage on social media on Tuesday. A video of Khelif’s fight against Mexico’s Brianda Tamara Cruz Sandoval in December 2022 raised the temperature.\n\nThe video of the 66-kilogram fight in the WBT Golden Belt Series showed Khelif pummeling the Mexican fighter. Tamara told The Telegraph she never felt the way she felt after the fight during her boxing career.\n\n\"When I fought her I felt very out of my depth,\" Tamara added. \"Her blows hurt me a lot. Thank God that day I got out of the ring safely, and it’s good that they finally realized.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Gaydos.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nAmerican Evy Leibfarth earns first Olympic medal in women’s canoe single\n\nTwo-time Olympian Evy Leibfarth has earned her first Olympic medal with a third place finish in the women’s canoe single final on Wednesday.\n\nLeibfarth, 20, was holding on to gold medal position for the first half of the women’s final before Elena Lilik of Germany finished with an official time of 103.54. Leibfarth went first in the final after entering with the highest qualifying time, but she managed to hold on to medal position through all 12 finalists.\n\nAustralia’s Jessica Fox has picked up her second gold medal of these Olympics, after winning the women’s kayak single on Sunday.\n\nLeibfarth has a chance to medal again when she competes in the women’s kayak cross event beginning on Friday.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nAre the Summer Olympics every 4 years? When are the next games?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympic Games are underway and will continue through August 11.\n\nWhen will we see the Olympic Games next?\n\nThe summer Olympics are held every four years, and the next time we see the summer Olympics will be in 2028 in Los Angeles.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Tokyo Games actually took place in 2021.\n\nThe first Olympic Games started in 1896, and the winter Olympic Games began in 1924.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1992 the summer and winter Games were held in the same year. The four years period is called an “Olympiad.”\n\n1992 was the last year the games were played in the same year when Barcelona hosted the summer Olympics and Albertville hosted the winter Olympics.\n\nSince 1992, the summer and winter Games are still played every four years, but not during the same year. The summer Games are held during the first year of the Olympiad, while the winter Games are held during the third year of the Olympiad.\n\nThe next winter Olympic Games will be in 2026, hosted by Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo in Italy.\n\nPosted by Ryan Gaydos Share\n\nThese sports have never been part of the Olympic Games\n\nOver the next few weeks, the world will get to watch some of the best athletes in the world compete at their craft.\n\nWhile the 2024 Paris Games have 33 different events, there are still some notable sports that have never been played in the Olympics.\n\nAmerican Football\n\nAmerican Football has never made an appearance in the Olympics. However, flag football has been approved by the IOC to be an Olympic event for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.\n\nSome of the NFL’s best yearn for the opportunity to play flag football in the 2028 Los Angeles Games to represent their country.\n\nCricket\n\nDespite it being the second most-watched sport in the world, it only appeared in the 1896 Games before being withdrawn from the event due a lack of entrants.\n\nHowever, cricket will be an event in the 2028 Olympic Games so the over century long wait will be over in four more years.\n\nDarts\n\nThere was some discussion about darts potentially making it into the 2024 Paris Olympics, but to no avail.\n\nThe sport is gaining momentum around the world but not yet an Olympic sport.\n\nBowling\n\nBowling has appeared as a demonstration sport in the Games before, but never officially an Olympic sport.\n\nMixed Martial Arts\n\nMMA is immensely popular across the world, but not an Olympic sport. Some believe the sport is too violent to ever be an Olympic sport.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nHow many times has Team USA won the Olympics?\n\nTeam USA is looking to continue to build upon their Olympic dominance at the Paris 2024 Games.\n\nThroughout the Olympic Games, the United States is the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics.\n\nThe United States collected a total of 2,968 medals throughout the history of the Games prior to the 2024 Summer Olympics. 1,179 gold medals, 956 silver medals, and 833 bronze medals.\n\nTeam USA has placed first in the Summer Olympic table in 18 of the 29 Games in 28 appearances. The United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\n\nTeam USA won the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, bringing home 113 total medals, with 39 of them gold.
