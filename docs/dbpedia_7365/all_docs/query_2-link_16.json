        "text": "Mark Spitz (born February 10, 1950, Modesto, California, U.S.) is an American swimmer who, at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, became the first athlete to win seven gold medals in a single Games.\n\nLike many other outstanding American swimmers, Spitz trained for several years at the Santa Clara (California) Swim Club. He served as captain of the intercollegiate swimming team at Indiana University, Bloomington (graduated 1972). At the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City he aroused controversy by publicly predicting that he would capture six gold medals. In fact he won only two, both in team relay races (4 × 100-metre and 4 × 200-metre freestyle). He did win two individual medals, silver (100-metre butterfly) and bronze (100-metre freestyle).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz"
