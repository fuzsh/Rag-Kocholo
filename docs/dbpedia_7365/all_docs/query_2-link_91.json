        "text": "Meet the people behind the voices!\n\nAlongside Team USA gymnasts at the 2024 Paris Games, there’s a squad of highly skilled, highly excitable announcers calling the athletes’ every move for the fans at home as they twist, tumble, and vault their way into Olympics history.\n\nWith five Olympians on the NBC and Peacock men’s and women’s commentary team, the group’s expertise runs deep. So listen up for their informed expertise about such topics as Simone Biles’ off-the-charts degrees of difficulty.\n\nAnd count on them to just marvel like the rest of us at jaw-dropping moments, like when Stephen Nedoroscik morphed from a bespectacled Clark Kent to bewitching Superman on the pommel horse. And their work doesn't stop when the competition does, as they are also there for the men's and women's gymnastics medal ceremonies.\n\nRELATED: Simone Biles Reveals the Gymnastics Team’s “Official” Nickname — And an NSFW One\n\nGet to know the Paris 2024 Olympics announcers for the gymnastics events.\n\nLaurie Hernandez\n\nPhoto: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nGymnastics analyst Laurie Hernandez was part of the gold medal-winning “Final Five” team at 2016 Rio Olympics, where she also took home a silver medal for the balance beam. Paris marks her debut as part of the team of Olympics commentators. She’s already nailing it. USA Today reported that fans said she is “funny, affable, enthusiastic.”\n\nSamantha Peszek\n\nPhoto: Stew Milne/Getty Images\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Samantha Peszek was a member of the silver medal-winning U.S. women’s gymnastics team. Because of an ankle injury during warm-ups at the qualifying round, she only competed in the bars event.\n\nPeszek went on to compete in gymnastics, which she began at age 2 as a kid in Indiana, at the collegiate level for the University of California at Los Angeles. Before her gig as an analyst in Paris, she provided commentary on the gymnastics events leading up to the Games.\n\nTim Daggett\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici/NBC\n\nAt the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, where he scored a perfect 10 on the high bar, Tim Daggett won a team gold medal and a bronze for the pommel horse. Daggett, who was also a gymnast at UCLA, made his debut behind the scenes as an NBC analyst in Barcelona in 1992. He’s covered gymnastics at every Olympic Games since!\n\nTerry Gannon\n\nPhoto: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images\n\nPlay-by-play announcer Terry Gannon carved out an illustrious basketball career at North Carolina State University and became a sports broadcaster in 1986. He joined up with NBC Sports in 2010, covering an array of events. He’s been an announcer for every summer and winter Games since.\n\nRELATED: Simone Biles’ Clap Back at Team USA Critics Is Also Worthy of A Gold Medal\n\nJustin Spring\n\nPhoto: Michael Allio/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nSpring makes his debut as an analyst for gymnastics at the Paris Games, but he’s well-versed in the sport and has a bronze team medal from the Beijing 2008. Spring has gymnastics experience at both the elite and collegiate levels. Since retiring from the sport in 2009, he’s carved out an extensive coaching career.\n\nRich Lerner\n\nPhoto: David Cannon/Getty Images\n\nAt Paris 2024, Rich Lerner, a daytime play-by-play announcer, notches his fourth year covering the Games with NBCU. Beyond gymnastic apparatuses, Lerner knows his way around the links.\n\nZora Stephenson\n\nPhoto: James Black/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nZora Stephenson is an NBCU reporter for women’s gymnastics who conducts interviews with Team USA athletes after the nail-biting competitions are over. Previously, she worked as an NBC Olympics social media host at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nJohn Roethlisberger\n\nPhoto: NBC Sports"
