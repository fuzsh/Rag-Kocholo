        "text": "Which country is the most successful at the Olympic Games? Here are the top-ranked countries in terms of total medals won when all of the summer Games are considered (including results from the Tokyo 2020 Games). There are two tables presented, the first table just lists the top countries based on the total medals won, and the second table factors in how many Olympic Games the country appeared, averaging the total number of medals per Olympiad. A victory in a team sport is counted as one medal.\n\nThe USA Has Won the Most Medals\n\nThe USA has clearly won the most gold medals and the most medals overall, more than doubling the next ranked country (these figures include medals won in Tokyo 2020, updated August 2021). Why are they so successful? Second-placed Soviet Union/USSR had fewer appearances at the Olympics, and actually won more medals on average (see the 2nd table). This top 10 includes one country no longer in existence (the Soviet Union), so their medal totals will obviously not increase, however, China is expected to continue a rapid rise up the ranks. With the addition of the 2021 data, China has moved up from 11th (in 2008) to 9th (2012) to 7th (2016) to 6th (2021). The country that has attended the most games without a medal is Monaco (21 Olympic Games), and the country that has won the most medals without winning a gold medal is Malaysia (0 gold, 8 silver, 5 bronze).\n\n# combining the results of USSR and the 1992 Unified Team (but Russia is separate)\n\n* combining the results of Germany, West Germany, and the United Team of Germany (but not East Germany)\n\nThe USSR was the most successful on average\n\nIt seems unfair to rank countries on total medals won when some countries have appeared at the Olympic Games many more times. The following list averages the medals won per Olympiad, so the success of countries can be compared more directly. Based on this calculation, the former Soviet Union was the most successful country with 112 medals per appearance compared to the US with 94 medals per appearance. However, also to be fair, the USSR can be considered a combination of many countries.\n\nEast Germany has been listed separately from the Germany's results, highlighting how much more successful the East Germans were compared to the rest of the country. It is not surprising what a littleÂ state-sponsoredÂ dopingÂ program can do.\n\nThe ranking in this table is based on the average total medals per Olympiad, though whether using the figure of total gold medals or total all medals, the list order is essentially the same.\n\n# combining the results of USSR and the 1992 Unified Team (but Russia is separate)\n\n* combining the results of Germany, West Germany, and the United Team of Germany (not East Germany)\n\nRelated Pages\n\nYou can see the medal list of all countries from which the above data is extracted.\n\nMedal tables from all Olympic Games\n\nA comparison of different ranking systems\n\nMedals per Country Size — comparing medals with country size (both land size and population)\n\nFirst Olympic Gold Medal Winners from Each Country.\n\nList of the First medal winners (any color) from each country\n\nOld Comments\n\nCommenting is closed on this page, though you can read some previous comments below which may answer some of your questions.\n\nJust heard that the IOC banned Russia from the Olympics. So much for the idea of \"fair play\". I intend to completely boycott all Olympic games forever. When you are so corrupt that you are willing to use sports for political purposes, especially when you are already the undisputed leader in that arena, and the majority of people are dumb enough to allow it, the end of your civilization is at hand. How good can a sport be when the second place team is eliminated from competition, accused of wrongdoing, that the established winner has been caught doing in the past. I suspect that the US, under ownership of the pharmaceutical companies, not only has more of, and more sophisticated drugs, but has probably used the doping rules themselves to discriminate against other nations. If I was an Olympic athlete and I was told I couldn't wear the flag of my home country and that our national anthem could not be played, I would not participate. If I was an American athlete, I would boycott on moral principals, what value is there in participating in a rigged game? Of course it would be hard to pass up the payday that comes with the medals. I predict the US will make a clean sweep of the medals (statistically speaking) and the games themselves will be BORING. BOYCOTT the Olympics. (from Jon, 2017)\n\nYou can boycott if you like and you can cry if you like but politics played no part in them being banned. It's called more than half of your athletes tested came up positive for roids. (Aurelius72 , 2017)\n\nPete, what county's children are there that can name more than 40 countries? Almost none, please stop making yourself look like an idiot. What interests me, is the subtleness of your USSR compilation of medal earnings. How many countries did the USSR include during it's rule? What was it's population under that ruling? Well it had a population of around 293 million people in 1991 and ecompassed over a DOZEN different countries. Just as you said, a higher population will lead to a higher medal count, it seems they were merely on par if not below the USA's standards of medal earnings. To be fair. David (2013)\n\nHigher population is meaningless. India has almost one billion people and Michael Phelps has almost as many medals as India has won combined. Arizona65 David (2016)\n\nCorrection, he now has more than India has ever won at a single olympic games. Go Phelps! He is consistently better than the average of 1.3 billion swimmers. That is worth somethin. Jacob Sawyer arizona65 (2016)\n\nDude you are still not comparing apples with apples. You have to look at the amount of funding, infrastructure, coaching etc. Can the 1.3 billion in India get the same facilities that the Americans can avail? Anuj Jacob Sawyer (2016)\n\nYou cannot get through to American folk my friend. The Americans have always thought that they are better than everyone else on the planet, I just laugh at them. William Alexander Plumbasket Anuj (2017)\n\nI'm American and I laugh at them too. Party on! Black 'Mericuh William. Whites Are Victims William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nBecause we so obviously are.... Fedex Routes William Alexander Plumbasket (2017). You laugh because it makes you nervous that we are... I want to appologize for that.Sorry. - Lee Jones William Alexander Plumbasket (2020) Not as hard as we laugh at you. Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nMan you're thick. It is down to funding - GDP, that breeds success, not the gene pool, population, you moron. Unless of course, some American people think that they are a superior race (lol). Another certain country had similar ideas in the last century, it did not finish too well for them - did it now. American exceptionalism springs to mind. It is common knowledge, that a percentage of the American population suffer from 'Delusions Of Grandeur' - You're just one of those ignorant statistics. William Alexander Plumbasket Jacob Sawyer (2017)\n\nThere is not a singular American race is you have not been up to date with American news (Which you dont need to be)there is still a lot of racism and things that divide the different races of America. Chase Sam William Alexander Plumbasket (2018)\n\nWilliam, genetics totally matter for sports. Why do you think blacks always dominate any track related sports? But go ahead and ignore science and brag about how wonderful the crumbling unites kingdom and storm yourself off to your own ethnicity. Gary Johnson William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nHe did it with Chinese traditional cupping. Is that banned? GuanKim Jacob Sawyer (2016)\n\nClearly not. But, he did do it without the Chinese traditional state-funded doping. Grossman GuanKim (2016)\n\nok americans are good at sports,we get it,but you live in a fool's world if you think you're a superior race or something just cuz you have more medals. A fish will live his whole life believing it's a moron if you judge his intelligence by climbing trees. And why can't USA produce enough scientist to run NASA and stop hiring indian brains? just saying... Rahul Biswas Jacob Sawyer (2016)\n\nFor being from such an intelligent stock of people, I thought you would have already known that American is not a race, it's a nationality. Americans are comprised of many different races of people (including Indians). Also, the \"Indians\" you claim run NASA, are actually Americans. You see, except for rare cases of exception, you have to be a U.S. citizen to work at NASA. Etesvous stupide? Rahul Biswas (2016)\n\nWell that last point also comes down to the school system and how the government doesn't fund schools as much as they should Asian and Indian parents tend to push their kids way harder than Americans because there are ways to be successful other than doing good in school and being smart. Americans dont end up in poverty when they do not do well in school lol. Chase Sam Rahul Biswas (2018)\n\nindia is a filthy mess. They need the British to come back and clean the place up again. Rmclarkjr . Rahul Biswas (2017)\n\nMost of these \"Indians\" are American. America isn't even close to just white people you know... Da Dude Rahul Biswas (2017)\n\nUSA is the ONLY superpower for a reason. just saying. Rahul Biswas (2016)\n\nThe rest of the world should know when they have been conquered either directly or indirectly... Rmclarkjr . (2017)\n\nWOW... 300 years as a superpower and there is the \"REASON\" behind it... imagine what Greeks, Egyptians, Mongolians, Persians (yes that's Iran), Ottomans, Chinese and a dozen others can say given that they run at one point or another empires for 1000's of years. They must have had a bigger \"REASON\" to say the least. :) Georgios Kappos (2016)\n\nGeorgios, times have changed. Things move very much faster. These old civilizations and cultures would not have lasted as long in a modern era. To find fault without thinking before posting is a sign of envy. Typical of people critical who lash out using any subject. The U.S is like the gentle giant in a schoolyard full of punks. There are times when the gentle giant kicks butt. It seems that the U.S is always under attack. The U.S has far less than 300 years as a \"superpower\" but it is holding on in a universe that is moving at least 100 times faster than a thousand years ago if not 2000 or 3000 years ago. No one is perfect but the U.S has done a lot of good and it is disappointing to see all the criticism. Americans can dig heels just like anyone else and they are more self reliant than anyone else. You should never forget that. It is what made this country. You would be more appreciative if you had a sense of the size, complexity and efficiency of the American infrastructure which you do not and cannot interpret in a short visit or two. It takes years to understand the phenomenon America is. Paul Homsy Georgios Kappos (2017)\n\nNot even 300 years as a 'superpower' - more like about 100 years. American people suffer from Delusions Of Grandeur, they always have done. I do agree with some of what you are saying though. William Alexander Plumbasket Georgios Kappos (2017)\n\nExactly I guess the rise of both USSR and USA was 1918 the end of first world war, 3 superpowers woth UK which lost the status in 1945 and USSR in 1991 now with China rise as superpower in 2020. America may celebrate but they now have a tough competitor and they will use India here for the benfit. Abhishek Srivastava William Alexander Plumbasket (2020)\n\nMr. Plumbasket. The Brits have won many wars and battles because they are disciplined loyal troops but they invariably always lost in parliament because of their own \"delusions of grandeur\", the disdain they harbored all over the world for those they had battled who weren't exactly like them. A sense of pride bordering on insane provinciality. The distance they kept. Never mingling and always thinking of England as \"home\". Very commendable but clearly showing at the time of the colonies the inability to truly leave your shores with an open mind. As for the great cultures that lasted thousands of years, times were different and nothing traveled as fast as things do today. Your put down attitude towards the U.S is the purest reflection of your lack of gratitude. The U.S saved Europe twice. At least take the high road and show the class you think you have by being thankful. You're a silly poser. Bar stool prophets are a dime a dozen. The majority of the last two or three generations have been more open minded, better traveled, it isn't the miles you log but the eyes you use to actually see, the new generations in general see the world with a very different optic than the old era colonialists of which you seem to be a vestige without much of a rudder. Luckily the newer generations of your country and most others have evolved well beyond your current capabilities which they show by being far more citizens of the world than the likes of you ever were regardless of what distant moons you traveled under. They have joined the world while those who wallow in their past perceived glory do a disservice to their country in their boorish inability to see beyond their local beaches. Paul Homsy William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nYou just did the same thing, assuming that NASA only hires Indian brains? You correct about assuming their a superior race, because countries all over the world play different sports. The olympics are very western, most of the sports are popular among westerners. And if Indians are apparently so smart, how come they haven't started their own space program? Batman Georgios Kappos (2016)\n\nThough I agree with your first line but just for your knowledge an answer for your last line Batman .. either you don't read news apart from Western world or you were asleep for last 5 years otherwise you would not have undermined India and India do have a space Agency called ISRO just google and has their own indigenous space programs too including chandrayaan-1 (moon mission) in 2008 and Mangalyaan (Mars mission ) in 2014 became Asia's first country to successfully reach Mars orbit and at cheapest cost so pls correct your facts. Gyan Batman (2017)\n\nNASA have people working from all over the world - it would be a no brainer to suggest otherwise. If it was just Americans, well, I would not like to imagine that outcome. William Alexander Plumbasket Batman (2017)\n\nWithout British colonisation - well, you'd still be wiping your bottoms of leaves.\n\nI hate to say this, but I really wish that my ancestors had not colonised America at all, you'd still be a nice & quiet country then. Only a complete idiot would even imagine that they are superior human beings, oh look, only an American would think that. It was only last Century that certain individuals from another country, thought that they were 'superior human beings' - it didn't finish too well for them, according to the history books ;-) Maybe there is a lesson to be learned by you American folk. Have a nice day :-) William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nOh, and we did kind of kick your butts in the revolutionary war. MattTempco William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nwhat would you have done without America in the world wars? MattTempco William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nSpeaking German lol. Fedex Routes MattTempco (2017)\n\nBro the U.S is made up of many nationalities. More than almost every country in the world. And yea the U.S is better at sports except soccer. But we do lack in other areas. We dont think we're the best in everything. We just take pride in what we do. Eric William Alexander Plumbasket (2018)\n\nNo, no, no, the British, France, and Spanish colonized America. YOYOYO William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nNow who's the arrogent fool suffering from \"delusions of grandoure\" as you so called it, quoting some other probably arrogent fool. Da Dude William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nAnd who thinks of themselves as s**t hot now? When you say \"some Americans think they're a superior race\". Unlike many Europeans and you in particular, hardly any American thinks of himself or herself as part of a superior race. I believe you cornered the market on that one. You're projecting your own feelings. Big fail. Americans are far easier to get along with than a stuck up jerk thinks. You impose your own self-limitations with your narrow views and actual feelings of superiority. Stop gathering your information from tabloids. We didn't invent them...You did. Paul Homsy William Alexander Plumbasket (2017)\n\nIgnorance is Bliss. Do you have any data on how many indians are working for NASA? Dont go by the pesudeo patrotic-social posts. Swagat Rath Rahul Biswas (2016)\n\n22% of the people in India are in poverty. Only dedicated athletes can try to make the olympics and a lot of people have to work their butts off to stand a chance at living.This proves that india actually has a smaller percent of people who actually can compete and want to. William Huang arizona65 (2019)\n\nI will make this simple for you, being as you are an American. There is a few determining factors that makes America a leading medal winner, are you ready? GDP/ funding/ academies\" - it really is as simple as that. Now, some American people will claim that they are superior human beings (arrogance/ignorance) or whatever you want to call it. Now, certain individuals, from another country, had similar ideas last Century. As I am sure that you will appreciate, it did not finish too well for them. Maybe there is a lesson for you folk. It seems that a moderate percentage of Americans suffer from 'Delusions Of Grandeur' - It is noticeable, especially after reading your comments.\n\nHave a nice day :-). William Alexander Plumbasket arizona65 (2017)\n\ni just want to add one logical perception regarding the medal tally. why there are so many number of medals in some sports like swimming and only one gold in team sports like hockey and football. i think there should be some kind of parity between these medals. in the sports which require the contribution of whole team, they give only one gold while some sports like swimming, they are giving many golds. i think there should be some parity regarding weightage of gold medals so that one gold in football or hockey will not be compared with one gold of any particular kind of swimming sport. because the efforts which the whole team has made to win a team sport gold is much more than a single athlete's effort in sport like swimming. Skandh soni arizona65 (2016)\n\ni disagree....being that football/soccer, basketball, hockey, or whatever it may be is a weighed team sport swimming and track takes more because there are different regions within it or categories. you don't get a medal for best header in football or best dunk or best check in hockey. However best 100m best butterfly swimmer and best javelin all require different skills and isn't played in a game format. Kut Thomas skandh soni (2016)\n\nFunding counts more then population something the US does in abundance.... Others obviously can't compete if they don't having means for funding. Ricardo arizona65 (2016)\n\nIt's not meaningless - but its one important variable (there are others - such as money invested in sport - and whether you are a rich democracy). India is not a rich democracy so doesn't have much money to spend on sport. A gold medal typically costs around $1m of investment. Niico100 arizona65 (2016)\n\nIndia do have money. If they took some of the money spent on cricket and invested it in sport acadamies, who knows what the results may be. BrilliantIdiot niico100 (2019)\n\nomg... i keep on seeing your comments... hey mate... Greek here and of course broke as a nation! Imagine what... we are named broke by your american -ups international- institutions, yet we own less that 1% that you do. So let's be honest, there is only one thing you are clearly better... weapons and willingness to use them on innocent children in order to secure your economic interests. From there the equations are really easy to be followed... and yes they lead to superpowers!!! Georgios Kappos (2016)\n\nwhile your point is made clearly, you have mis-spoke. If you are referring to the US for comparison to India... Neither country is a Democracy. The US is a Republic and always has been. Read the Pledge of Allegiance. \" To the Republic for which it stands\" Brian Holland niico100 (2016)\n\nThere isn't a true democratic country in the world, a actual Democracy is where every civilian of that said Democracy votes and decides policy of the government, which if it were in place today it would literally be impossible to accomplish hardly anything because of the vast different number of opinions which would make the political process impractical and almost impossible, the United States is a Democratic Rebuplic which is the same and is a base from which all Democratic governments use, it's neither a true Democracy nor a true Republic it takes the best parts of both to create a government with the ability to have the people participate like a democracy and have the most simplicity and efficiency of a republic. AMERICAN WORKER Brian Holland (2016)\n\nThe USA took lands off the Indians so we don't know how things might have panned out in that territory if one culture had not subjugated another. Pix042 David (2014)\n\nUs Cherokee Indians are extremely good at Javelin throw and Ping Pong. Watch out.... 2020.... for the Native American team of athletes! LOL (yes im Cherokee) Jacob Sawyer pix042 (2016)\n\nIf you were Cherokee you'd call yourself just Cherokee or native not an Indian. Alexander DeLarge Jacob Sawyer (2016)\n\noh I Know Thorpe still holds records in American Football too and he was Native American.. Can you Imagine if the native American had not been conquered by the Europeans.. imagine 7 foot tall man wrestling in the olympics.. Yes the native Americans were tall people. All along the eastern seaboard from Hudson bay to Florida. to the Gulf of Mexico down to Mexico were these Giants. Talmadge Williams pix042 (2016)\n\nMy maternal great grandmother was full-blooded Choctaw, and she was very short, under 5'. Choctaws were generally short people. Quite a few Native American tribes were short people. My family is from the coast of the Gulf Of Mexico, all branches of it. Melanie Talmadge Williams (2016)\n\nIf everyone has the idea a larger population gives you a better chance of getting Olympics medals, please explain how the top few populous countries India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh did so badly perennially. Gillette00 David (2016)\n\nPopulation is important, but GDP is more important. Taking these 2 things together, you can easily come up with a formula to predict (at least explain) the differences in medal tallies in different countries. Francis Gillette00 (2016)\n\nAgree that GDP should be looked at more favorably than population. Something to consider though, many medalists from poorer nations train in the US or attend US universities. Therefore, they have access to the same training and facilities as the US athletes. Grossman Francis (2016)\n\nsoooooo what happens when you add the fact that team usa is not sponsored by its govt, while many of its competitors are? Badd_KungFu Francis (2016)\n\nThe individuals such as those in Team USA not sponsored by states are rewarded financially far more handsomely. Pluses and minuses in both system. Francis Badd_KungFu (2016)\n\nThere are many countries where people can't name countries. Just because you don't know doesn't mean nobody knows. You Americans didn't even know Vietnam until the war ðAnkush Sawant David (2016)\n\nLmao why did we need to, it's like a king knowing the names of all the peasants in the kingdom, and then out of nowhere the peasant threatens to move to another kingdom which threatens the size of our kingdom and by that we take notice of him. Eli Ankush Sawant (2016)\n\nWhy do you include West Germany in the German totals but not East Germany? This seems arbitrary. East Germany was unified with West Germany into Germany, so if you accept West German medals, you logically have to accept East German medals. Ian (2016)\n\nIan, I can see an argument for including West Germany's medals with those of the united Germany as in effect the continuing German state between 1945-89. However, to include those of East Germany as well would be unfair as in many events East and West Germany together would have had twice as many competitors as other countries so distorting the results, e.g. athletics - six German competitors per event compared with three from the USA or USSR. In any event East Germany's medal success is so completely tainted by systemic drug abuse I'm certain Germany wouldn't wish to be credited with these medals. Many ex-East German athletes, particularly women, are still paying the price for the state sponsored abuse of their bodies. Nick ian (2016)\n\nJust because you are given the privilege of posting does not meant you also get the privilege of posting false accusations.... First dont compare kenya with any of the countries you mentioned.... KENYA does not have the financial muscle that the others have to have a sophisticated doping system.... But whats more important is each of the mentioned countries have had medals stripped from their athletes for doping at the olympics.... Now read this NOT A SINGLE KENYAN HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF THEIR OLYMPIC MEDAL EVER.... as for doping yes kenyan athelets of no particular value in athletics or recognition have dopped.... And also every other country has but non of our medal winners.... So pleaee watch what you say about our athletes. Mohamed Benjamin Hoffmeister (2016)\n\nVery odd including Australia as a 'bigger nation using doping'. We have less than 1/10th of the population of the US at around 25 million compared to 350 million and I believe we have only ever had 3 IOC doping charges. Historically, Australia is one of the cleanest nations when it comes to doping, as well as being one of the most successful medal winning nation per capita of population at 7th in the world overall and number 1 in the world for nations with populations over 10 million. USA is 36th in the world for medals won per capita of population out of a total of 64 nations. Russian Federation is 41st and China is in 56 place. Beau Ravn Ap Gwyddon Benjamin Hoffmeister (2016)\n\nSomeone tell me why Russia is listed as the soviet union. TunaSalad (2017)\n\nthey are not, USSR/Soviet Union and Russia are listed separately. You can see them both on the complete list which has been recently updated Rob Admin TunaSalad (2017)\n\nI think there is a problem with the AVERAGE chart in that there were far less possible medals to win in the early Olympics prior to the USSR participating. You'd need to weigh the number of possible medals into each olympics before calculating the average. DarkHorseSki(too many upvotes) (2016)\n\nI agree, factoring the number of available medals would improve this analysis .. I've just got to find the info and do the calculations. Rob Admin DarkHorseSki (2016)\n\nYeah, you'll need a total medals awarded number per Olympics. And that has to be actual results because trying to shortcut things would throw off the numbers thanks to the early Olympics not having the Gold/Silver/Bronze... and some sports, like Judo, awarding 2 bronzes... DarkHorseSki(too many upvotes) Rob (2016)\n\nYou forgot to mention that during the 70s and 80s the United States was not allowed to have professional athletes. The Soviet Union did allow them and that drastically affected the medal haul for the USA. That skewed the results, So the USA still has the most impressive haul. Why didn't you mention this? Are you Canadian or something? World Rob (2019)\n\nVery interesting your web page. I agree with you in considering the ex-USSR ( Soviet Union ) as the best ever team taking in mind they only attended in 10 Olympic editions. On the other hand, why don't consider Germany as an unique team after its re-unification, if so they are the third ever successful country with 400 gold medals. Congratulations again and greetings from Lima - Peru. Carlos Mendoza (2015)\n\nKeep in mind USSR's success had partly to do with the commandeering of about 15 or so countries through force, and state sponsored doping/forced drug use. Not to downplay their success to be disrespectful, but yes, their stats are nowhere comparable to the stable and consistent success of countries like USA and China. Jacob Sawyer Carlos Mendoza (2016)\n\nOh the irony. Just reading through all the comments and one must chuckle. Instead of comparing one country with another. Look at the years in which the global climate has been anything but peaceful and yet as a group we are able to come together on a world stage and enjoy the ideals of the best man has to offer in spirit and in physical abilities. Granted many have \"cheated\" and standards of what is acceptable has changed. So much so that many athletes of 50 years ago would have not passed doping regs of today if used back then. Stop looking with a finite mindset, but rather seeing the showcase of mankind simplified and unified under one roof regardless of race, region, creed, religion or anything else that may drive us a part. We are human and we can cohabitate that's the beauty of these games. Regardless of medal counts. We all win when we strive as one race in the greatest race of all...the human race. Jon Carson (2016)\n\nomg this is so cool i never knew this because i am learning about this in socialology. Brool (2020)\n\nThank you for the nice article. I went ahead and searched for the medals per capita because countries with 10 or a hundred times the population of my country have fewer medals. I was born in Bulgaria and I am proud of how high they rank with a population of only 7 million people. This is pretty embarrassing for countries like the States, Russia, France, and Germany. Vlad Rangotchev (2019)\n\nGood job coming up with a completely random statistic to put Russia on top. USA is the most athletic country on Earth by a large margin. Get over it. Good Krypollo (2019)\n\nThe USSR athletes were aided by goverment sponsored performance enhancement programs and their athletes were basically profesional athletes they were given goverment jobs that allowed them to get payed to practice for their olympic events all year round. Drizzt228 (2018)\n\nthe men who built america started the entire world motivated. who invented cars? who started the rail road? who built refineries? who invented the television? who invented pc's/ which led to a battle over who's was better... now hand held computers? we [usa] may not have been the first, but we definitely started the world we live in today!!!!! Joker (2017)\n\nrailroad: the Brits, automobil: germany, TV; US, Radio: Italy, Marconi. Polish pharmacist and inventor Ignacy Åukasiewicz established an oil refinery in JasÅo, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Poland) in 1854. electricity: Ben franklin. BrilliantIdiot joker (2019)\n\nAmerica is obviously the best y'all morons. Stats prove that. Hahahaha USA USA USA. Dalton Corbin (2017)\n\nCan we even count the USSR? I mean it's 2018 and these guys are still trying to get away with doping. Imagine what they got away with back then. Hank W (Sypher117) (2017)\n\nWhoa,so many people were angered by my previous comment months back. No wonder Trump is your President. Anyways,going back to how intelligent Indians are,ISRO,the Indian Space Research Organisation sent an orbiter to Mars at the cost of 1/10th of what Nasa did. Oh that burns,I'm sorry. And to the ignorant Brits,who don't even know that we do have a space program,let me ask you one question,do you have your own space program? And colonisation of India,yes,I'm coming to that,aren't you even ashamed of directly causing the famines in Bengal and what not. Oh and please come and talk to me when you have the heart to return our kohinoor diamond back. Yes the mighty Queen's Kohinoor diamond was stolen from India. So thats the history of Great Britain...Apply Burnol to burned areas please. ð ð Rahul Biswas (2017)\n\nMedals from Olympic events from years ago are all tainted by the possibility of drug use. Even today everyone is aware of the cheating that goes on and not only by the athletes themselves but by coaches, drug checkers and even Nations. People like the great Paavo Nurmi, winner of 10 Olympic gold medals in the 1920s, used a drug containing the male hormone testosterone to boost his performance and right up to today's latest drug takers, the need to 'win at all costs' will mean that some athletes will stoop to drug taking if available. The East German Olympic team and also I suspect most of the Soviet Union teams of the past were certainly using drug enhancement, so to use gold/ silver/ bronze medal count as some sort of sporting league table is to be taken with a BIG pinch of salt. Mal (2016)\n\nNice table, a much fairer comparison. You just need to update the numbers for Russia, it has won 149 gold medals in total and not 147. Manuel Falla (2016)\n\nWow!!! How did reading this article turn into a pointless comments about race. You all going to add religion and politics next?!? AMW (2016)\n\nIf life wasn't a competition why did god call us The Human Race? Arizona65 (2016)\n\nThis is what it comes down to....America it's the shiznit and all other countries suck...shouldn't qatar have the most medals because that's the richest county in the world ship money doesn't mean anything cause they never win so what it comes down too is every country sucks except America.....MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!!! Justin Dismore (2016)\n\nThe unfair advantage that USA, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and a lot of western countries have (but these in particular) is the greatest mixture of races which produces the best athletes. Add to that the superior funding and infastructure, stable environment and there's no comparison. They(predominatly white north European) just take credit for what a mixture of African, South American, Asian and East European genes contribute. When you take all this into account they should be even more dominant. It still doesnt match the achievements of Soviet Union/Russia (which was a mixture of far more similar people),China and many other countries for that matter. Jillimy Jilikers (2016)\n\nThe US is one of the most cosmopolitan places in the world. yes, they have serious racial issues. So do other countries. BrilliantIdiot Jillimy Jilikers (2019)\n\nWow. Two sentences in and it goes political. Nice. Why bother with the Olympics or even a song by Coke. No one really cares anymore. If they ever did. How do we go from naming countries to subjugating Native Americans? Geez... Mmotherday (2016)\n\nwhat about medals per capita?n Would not that be a more accurate measurement of success? Godisalljust (2016)\n\nOn this site I analysed the total medals won all time relative to population size, while that site you referenced only compares for each Olympiad. Rob Admin Beau Ravn Ap Gwyddon (2016)\n\nso Germany is #3 (GER+FRG+UTG) AND #11 (East-Germany) in your list (East-Germany would still be #9 in Gold-Ranking) // by the way, some athletes won medals for East-Germany AND Germany -> so why split them? -> if you add them up there will be 3 nations with each more than 1000 medals... Benjamin Hoffmeister (2016)\n\nWeighted Medals per Capita All Time: So Finland is the best :) lol Vargaati79 (2016)\n\nThere is no country in the world called GB. I presume you are all thinking of the UK. The ignorance of the morons who organized the UK's team is mind-blowing. I am embarrassed that the good people of Northern Ireland have been so shoddily treated. Nick (2016)\n\nThe British Olympic Association and the IOC both refer to the team from the United Kingdom as Great Britain, even though it is the team of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The team also represents the Crown dependencies (Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) and all but three of the British overseas territories. Rob Admin nick (2016)\n\nBeing such small nation in comparison to USA and Soviet union team GB is in fourth place so Britain is great. Sabin Bhattarai (2015)\n\nI am an American and am proud of our success, I am also proud of all the people of the world for doing well. GB for being much smaller, Australia for being even smaller in population than GB, wow some impressive totals. Brian (2015)\n\nplease make a top ten medals winner not country a athlete man or woman (im danish i need it at school) Please (2015)\n\nHehe, Sweden and Hungary here is very great success to these nations, because comparing to the 50-100 million inhabitants \"superpowers\" (I didn't talk about China), Sweden and Hungary is around 10 million people, and the last century their population moved between 7-10 million. This is what we can call real sport nations! Congratulation to Hungary and Sweden for this brathtaking accomplishments!!!!!!
