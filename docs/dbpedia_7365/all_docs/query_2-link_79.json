Every four years the Summer Olympics come around and athletes vie for medals, sporting glory, and the success of their country. Athletes in peak condition stun crowds, create new records, and push the limits of the human body. And over time, those bodies have gotten noticeably bigger. Using data from Sports Reference (via Kaggle), Georgios Karamanis plotted the average height and weight of Olympic athletes by sport to show how their body dimensions have changed over the years. Sports Where Olympic Athletes are Getting Bigger At first glance, all sports seemed to have moved to the right and ascended up the chart (a higher average weight and height) over the last 50 years. Here‚Äôs a table of the average weight of male Olympians, in kilograms, categorized by sport. Only sports where a direct comparison could be made between 1960 and 2016 were included: Sport 1960 (Kg) 2016 (Kg) % Change Athletics 72.4 74.6 +3.04% Basketball 83.9 100.2 +19.43% Boxing 65.9 67.8 +2.88% Canoeing 75.1 82.8 +10.25% Cycling 69.9 73.6 +5.29% Diving 66.2 66.9 +1.06% Equestrianism 68.5 73.4 +7.15% Fencing 72.5 79.5 +9.66% Football 70.2 74.1 +5.56% Gymnastics 65.1 63.1 -3.07% Hockey 69.8 77.3 +10.74% Modern Pentathlon 71.0 74.2 +4.51% Rowing 79.2 86.7 +9.47% Sailing 76.6 77.3 +0.91% Shooting 75.8 80.2 +5.80% Swimming 75.2 81.3 +8.11% Water Polo 82.4 94.6 +14.81% Weightlifting 76.3 87.8 +15.07% Wrestling 72.2 85.9 +18.98% The biggest example of the phenomenon is in basketball, where the average weight for men has gone up by more than 16 kilograms (35 lbs).

Nor will he have his fans waiting for him in a hall full of 17,000 fans to pump him up like they are these days at La D√©fense. The zenith of the French hero is now. Now is when he intended to set his marks in stone and break the absolute record for the 400-metre medley. But there is a problem. It cannot be now because the pool that the Paris Games organisers ordered to be built is not deep enough: 2.20 metres compared to the 2.50 metres that the international federation has imposed as a minimum from 2023. Two spans that represent an immensity in a sport that discriminates between the good and the fabulous in hundredths of a second. The physics of fluids conspires against Marchand and against the fifteen or so swimmers who entered this championship with times bordering on world records. ‚ÄúYou have to find depth to reduce the resistance produced by the waves on the surface,‚Äù explains Ra√∫l Arellano, a biomechanical specialist in charge of the laboratory at the University of Granada, one of the centres that has most studied the phenomenon that enables elite swimmers to propel themselves. ‚ÄúWhen they do the underwater swimming phase at the start and during the turns, swimmers generate vortices with the undulation of their body,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThese vortices are rotational flows, similar to a wave, that push swimmers and produce their maximum energy when they are done in sufficiently wide areas. But if you get too close to the bottom or the surface, these vortices are less efficient. Swimmers go down more than a metre and a half. If the pool is 2.5 metres deep, you still have a metre below. In Paris, the distance from the bottom has been reduced.‚Äù When a swimmer wants to go under 4 minutes in the 400-meter medley, which is an epic time, all these details have an impact. As it is a distance of 400 meters, this is amplified because the best swimmers can advance up to 100 meters underwater, 15 meters for every 50. Marchand was affected in a decisive way because he is a swimmer who uses the underwater phase in an extraordinary way.‚Äù After four days of finals, the results point to a sudden drop in speeds. A phenomenon that, with a few exceptions, such as the Australian women‚Äôs relay, means that the morning and evening times in practically all the competitions are worse than at the Tokyo 2021 Games and the Fukuoka 2023 World Championships, or that swimmers such as David Popovici, the first man to swim the 200-metre freestyle in 1m 42 seconds in a textile swimsuit, won gold on Monday with a time of 1m 44.72s. A time that would not have been enough to win any Olympic championship since Sydney 2000. As poor as the time in the 100 breaststroke final, settled by the eight participants in the 59-second range, when in Tokyo they all went under 59s and Peaty took gold with 57...\n\nA 100 years ago today, the inaugural Olympic Winter Games started in Chamonix, France. Back then, winter sports were considered elitist, and there was little appetite for a winter equivalent to the modern Olympic Games which began at Athens 1896. In the early 1900s, editions of the \"Nordic Games\" were held in Sweden and Norway, featuring many winter sports but also non-winter sports such as fencing. Figure skating was the first winter sport to become an Olympic sport when it was added to the Olympic programme at the summer-edition Olympic Games London 1908. It was joined by ice hockey, the second winter sport to be added to the programme, at Antwerp 1920. It was then decided that an International Winter Sports Week should be held in the same country hosting the summer-edition Olympic Games beginning with France in 1924. Bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, military patrol, figure skating, speed skating, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping were contested by 258 athletes from 16 teams, but just 13 of them were women ‚Äì all in figure skating. Since that inaugural event, the Olympic Winter Games have evolved to an event featuring over 2,800 athletes across more than 100 events and 16 disciplines.

With the Paris Summer Olympics fast approaching, organizers will be spending $4.7 billion to host the games to two million fans visiting from abroad. This year, 10,500 athletes will compete across 329 events to billions of viewers worldwide. Kayaking and breaking (commonly known as breakdancing) will debut, while surfing and skateboarding return for their second Olympics. This graphic shows the countries with the most medals in Summer Olympic sports, based on data from the International Olympic Committee. The Most Gold Medals in Summer Olympic Sports, by Country In the table below, we rank countries by all-time gold medals in the Summer Olympics: Rank Country All-Time Gold Medal Count 1 U.S. 1,061 2 ‚ò≠ Soviet Union 395 3 Great Britain 284 4 China 263 5 France 223 6 Italy 217 7 Germany 201 8 Hungary 181 9 Japan 169 10 Australia 164 11 East Germany 153 12 Sweden 147 13 Russia 147 14 Finland 101 15 South Korea 96 16 Netherlands 95 17 Romania 90 18 Cuba 84 19 Poland 72 20 Canada 71 As of July 5, 2024 During the vast majority of the 20th century, the U.S. won 10% of Summer Olympic medals. Among the sports with the highest medal counts are track and field and swimming, with 344 and 257 gold medals, respectively. American swimmer, Michael Phelps, has won more medals than any Olympic athlete ever, with 23 gold medals under his belt. Going further, almost 25% of all U.S. gold medals in Summer Olympic sports are from swimming. Ranking in second is the former Soviet Union, with 395 gold medals. During a period of heightened focus on elite athleticism during the Cold War, the USSR earned more medals than any other country during the 1956-1992 Summer Olympics, with the exception of 1968. It even won the most medals in 1992 after the dissolution of the ‚ÄúSoviet Union‚Äù. With 284 Summer Olympic gold medals, Great Britain falls next, thanks to its success in rowing, cycling, and track and field. Between 1984 and 2016, the Great Britain Team won a gold medal in rowing at every Summer Olympics game. Since returning to the Summer Olympics in 1984 after 30-year absence, China ranks fourth worldwide. Approximately 75% of Olympic gold medals have come from six sports, all found in the Summer Olympic Games. These include the undeniable success in table tennis, diving, shooting, weight lifting, and gymnastics. Not only that, two-thirds of China‚Äôs Summer and Winter Olympic gold medals are won by women.

Arguably the tightest and most competitive Women‚Äôs 400 Freestyle field ever assembled. The final has defending champions, a group of world record holders and world champions, old and new. If even at the 350, watch Titmus‚Äô (AUS) speed capability over Ledecky‚Äôs (USA) endurance attrition, all other factors being equal. Fairweather (NZL) is in form and along with Macintosh (CAN) will create the pressure on the top 3. Men‚Äôs 400 Free. A similar time spread, sees 1.62 seconds across the top 8 from heats. A tight field, with M√§rtens (GER) the most recent inform athlete, dangerously close to the only, remaining ‚ÄúSuper Suit‚Äù World Record in the books (Paul Biedermann (GER) 3:40.07), set in 2009. Possibly a closer race across the top three than in the women, Winnington (AUS), Short (AUS) and Woo-Min Kim (KOR) have specific endurance strengths to challenge M√§rtens. Women‚Äôs 4 x 100 Free Relay. The depth and strength of Australia‚Äôs women 100 freestylers makes for a good defence of Olympic titles. The US should never be discounted, particularly from a changeover capability, grounded in collegiate competition. China and Sweden both have strength but lack in overall depth. Men‚Äôs 4 x 100 Freestyle Relay. This will be a super race, with AUS, USA and CHN all powerful for different reasons. Watch the changeover, underwater and breakout performances of the US team, especially. This strength in the US team will be off set by Australia‚Äôs BES (back end speed) capability. #olympicswimming #Paris2024"
