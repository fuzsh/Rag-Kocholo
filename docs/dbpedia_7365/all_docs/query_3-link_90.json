        "text": "Husker Nation’s Olympic history has spanned 106 years with 107 different athletes and eight coaches representing 29 nations. That rich Olympic history includes two women who are leaders among athletes who appear in the games, 46 medals earned, a Husker football coach’s mother, and a nine-time medal winner.\n\nNebraska’s Olympic history, by the numbers, includes:\n\nFirst Husker — Lewis Anderson, a farm boy from Genoa, Nebraska, was the Huskers’ first Olympic athlete. The middle-distance runner competed in the men’s 1,500 meter run at the 1912 Summer Games in Stockholm, Sweden. After college, Anderson farmed on a 175-acre farm near Lincoln, raising bees, fruits and vegetables.\n\nMedal count — Nebraska’s medal count stands at 46 through the 21 Olympic games that have included Husker athletes. The total includes 11 gold, 11 silver and 24 bronze. The most recent medals awarded to Nebraska athletes went to Jordan Larson, Kayla Banwarth and Kelsey Robinson, who were part of Team USA volleyball’s bronze medal-winning team in 2016.\n\nFirst medalist — Keith Alvin Saint Hope Gardner, a Jamaican track and field athlete who ran under the British West Indies flag in the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Italy, is Nebraska’s first Olympic medalist. He was a part of the British West Indies’ 1600m relay team, which earned the bronze medal.\n\nFirst gold medalist — The Huskers’ first Olympic gold was earned by Charlie Greene, a sprinter who ran in the 1968 games in Mexico City. Despite an injury, Greene ran the first leg in Team USA’s 400m relay, which took the gold medal. He also earned a bronze in the 100m dash. In his career as one of the world’s fastest men, Greene collected six individual NCAA championships and set four world sprint records. Learn more about Greene.\n\nFirst woman — The mother of Scott Frost, Nebraska’s new head football coach, was the first woman to represent the Huskers in the Olympics. Carol (Moeske) Frost, a track and field athlete, competed in the discus throw at the 1968 games in Mexico City. At the 1967 Pan American Games, Frost earned gold in the event. Frost would also return to Nebraska to coach the women’s track and field team from 1977 to 1980. She coached Merlene Ottey, the Huskers’ first woman to earn an Olympic medal.\n\nNine-time medalist — Merlene Ottey is Nebraska’s most decorated Olympian and the first Husker woman to earn a medal. Known as the “Queen of the Track,” Ottey holds the record for the most Olympic appearances (seven) of any track and field athlete. She also ran for two countries — Jamaica (1980-2001) and Slovenia (2002-2012). Known as the “Queen of the Track,” Ottey’s first medal was bronze, which she earned in the 200m dash at the 1980 games in Moscow, Russia. Overall she earned three silver and six bronze medals in the 100m and 200m dashes and 400m relay.\n\nMost appearances — Two Husker women, sprinter Merlene Ottey and swimmer Therese Alshammar, are amongst the most prolific Olympians in terms of competing in the games. Ottey holds the record for most Olympic appearances (seven) by any track and field athlete. Her games include 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000 for Jamaica, and 2004 and 2008 for Slovenia. At 48 years of age in 2008, she failed to make her eighth Olympic games by just .28 seconds. Competing for Sweden, Alshammar is the first female swimmer to compete in six Olympic games. A winner of three Olympic medals, Alshammar competed in the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 summer games. Her medals, all earned in the 2000 games in Sydney, include two silvers (50m freestyle and 100m freestyle) and a bronze (400m freestyle relay). Alshammar served as the flag bearer for Sweden during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWinter duo — Only two Huskers — Curt Tomasevicz and Shelley-Ann Brown — have competed in the winter Olympic games and both served as push athletes on bobsled teams. Tomasevicz, who played Husker football, is a two-time Olympic medalist who competed for Team USA in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 games. Brown, a track athlete, competed for Canada and earned a silver medal in the two-woman competition at the 2010 games in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTrack and field tradition — Breaking down the 106 Husker athletes who have competed in the Olympic games, track and field leads the way with 43 competitors and 18 medals. Nebraska swimming is second with 22 Olympians and nine medals.\n\nCoaching Olympians — According to the Huskers’ online records, eight Nebraska coaches have participated in Olympic games. Both Peggy Liddick (women’s gymnastics) and Jan Bidrman (swimming) have led the way by working four Olympic games from 2000 to 2012. Liddick served as head coach for Australia, while Bidrman was an assistant coach for Canada. A complete list of coaches who have led Olympians is at the end of the list of Huskers who have competed in the games.\n\nHuskers in the Olympics\n\n1912 Summer Games at Stockholm, Sweden\n\nLewis
