John Stenner of Boulder, Colo., won the men’s individual time trial by nearly one minute in the U.S. Cycling Olympic Trials and National Championships at Altoona, Pa. Jeanne Golay of Glenwood Springs, Colo., won her fourth national title in the women’s event.

Stenner, 27, completed the 40-kilometer course in 51 minutes 15.78 seconds. Kent Bostick of Corrales, N.M., an eight-time national titlist, finished second in 52:14.48. Matthew Koschara of Selden, N.Y., was third in 52:28.82.

A former national ‘A’ team member, Stenner was dropped from the squad this season after two disappointing years. But he continued cycling, and paid his own way to the national championships.

“I didn’t handle the pressure well,” said Stenner, who spent a couple of seasons racing in Europe.

Golay, 30, of Glenwood Springs, Colo., a double Pan American Games gold medalist last summer, won the 40-kilometer women’s race in 58:55.23. Bunki Bankaitis-Davis of Boulder, Colo., a 1988 Olympian, finished second in 59:42.48. Carol Ann Bostick, Bostick’s wife, was third in the field of 36 women in 59:49.90.

Defending champion and national record-holder Inga Thompson of Reno, Nev., did not compete because of a medical emergency involving her boyfriend.

Caitlin Bilodeaux won her fourth Division I women’s foil title and a spot on the U.S. Olympic fencing team at the U.S. Fencing National Championships in Dolton, Ill.

Bilodeaux, of Concord, Mass., beat Ann Marsh of Royal Oak, Mich., 6-5, 5-3 in the gold medal match.

Mary Jane O’Neill, also of Concord, and Molly Sullivan of Malden, Mass., also made the Olympic team.
