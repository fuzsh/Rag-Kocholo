This is a book that contains a list of the one hundred irreplaceable books from the science fiction genre. But it is also rather more than just a list, because not only is each book lucidly introduced, summarized and placed in its general context, there are many ‘read on’ suggestions. These will take the interested reader down a number of sidetracks to distant literary places, some of which will come as a surprise to many people. The net that contains SF is a big one and fantastic literature can be cast over a wide area. Not everything is obvious. Beyond even the recommendations, there is an argument that runs throughout the book. It gently explains, defines, promotes, defends science fiction, always with a civilized enthusiasm and from a position of authority. When I discovered the genre long ago, late in my teens, there were far fewer SF books to read than there are now. In fact it felt (perhaps falsely) that with a little dedication it would be possible to sit down and read everything that had ever been published. I never attempted the\n\nv\n\n00 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:41 pm\n\nPage vi\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nfeat, although when I encountered some of the more serious science fiction fans I did wonder if they were trying it. In the early to middle 1960s, most of the science fiction that then existed had been written for magazines. SF was predominantly a shortstory form, and novels were comparatively rare. The few there were had almost all first appeared as serials, which is how many of the older novels on the main list in this book were published. To return to the story of my own brief contact with reading science fiction, I devoured the books avidly for a few years, but by the time I was in my mid-twenties my tastes had become more complex and not long after that I stopped reading science fiction almost completely. (Almost completely, because for several years I was a publisher’s professional reader, and throughout my career I have occasionally reviewed new books.) It always feels to me as if I gave up before I had seriously tackled the subject. I was surprised to discover, therefore, when I read this long list compiled by Messrs Andrews and Rennison, that I had read almost half of the books here. Naturally, they tend to be the older ones, but not entirely. Do I agree with the choices on the main list? Yes and no. I would like to have seen J.G. Ballard’s stories given prominence over his novels. He is still an under-rated writer, and that is because people judge him by his novels: on his scale, the B-list. There ought to be a Richard Cowper book here: The Twilight of Briareus or The Road to Corlay, or his stories. The same from Robert Sheckley, who was one of the finest 20th century short story writers, but whose novels weren’t as good. I would have chosen John Wyndham’s The Day of the Triffids or The Kraken\n\nvi\n\n00 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:41 pm\n\nPage vii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nWakes over The Midwich Cuckoos. Aldiss’s Greybeard rather than Hothouse. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle. What would I have left out? The Asimovs and the Heinleins, certainly, since in completely different ways they did much to distract everyone from the idea that science fiction should be written well. (This is a personal view – the consensus of the SF world is against me.) The novels by ‘Doc’ Smith, Jack Williamson and Raymond F. Jones are period pieces, and belong in a museum. Including two novels by Alfred Bester is including one too many, but The Stars my Destination is probably central to the entire SF argument. And H.G. Wells’s The Island of Doctor Moreau is famous, while not being one of his best books. On the whole, though, I go along with the selections here. I have long argued that science fiction is not something that should be judged as a unitary form. Any generalized argument in favour of SF, no matter how well or strenuously mounted, can be instantly undermined by pointing at one of the genre’s many, many embarrassments. (The opposite is also true, but not as subversively enjoyable to do.) Much better to think of SF as a place where adventurous or original writers can take advantage of certain blessings practically unique in literature: an articulate, faithful and intelligent readership, an active professional market for short stories, a consistent commercial niche within publishing and bookselling, a body of literary criticism that is both knowledgeable about the literature and expectant of high quality. This is the sort of literary environment where writers can practise, where they can develop their individual voices and be heard, encouraged and soon relished. That is the best way to read and understand this book: as an intro-\n\nvii\n\n00 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:41 pm\n\nPage viii\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nduction not to a genre that might or might not be to everyone’s taste, but as a recommendation of the works of authors who are not known to many people outside the genre. There are many surprises here, in that sense. Nearly one hundred of them, in fact. Christopher Priest\n\nviii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage ix\n\nABOUTTHISBOOK\n\nThis book is not intended to provide a list of the 100 ‘best’ SF novels. A definitive list of the greatest SF novels is an impossibility – personal tastes in SF, as in any area of writing, differ and any ‘Best of…’ list is always unacceptably subjective. We have been guided instead by the title of our book and have chosen 100 books to read in order to gain an overview of the rich and diverse writing to be found in SF. The Introduction, on the evolution and proliferation of SF, provides a useful background to understanding references in the entries to movements and moments in SF’s history – there is also a short glossary of definitions on page 176. The entries, arranged A to Z by author, describe the plot of each title while aiming to avoid too many ‘spoilers’, offer some value judgements and describe the author’s place in the history of SF and/or their other works. The symbol >> before an author name (e.g. >> J.G. Ballard) indicates that one or more of their books is covered in the A to Z author entries, suggesting to the reader the option of turning immediately to the relevant entries to explore that particular writer’s work and place in SF history. Each entry is followed by a ‘Read on’ list, which includes books by the same author, books by stylistically similar writers or books on a theme relevant to the entry. We have also noted significant film versions (with\n\nix\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage x\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\ndates of release), where applicable. ‘Read on a Theme’ listings are designed to help you explore a particular area of SF in greater depth, and at the end of the book you will find listings relating to film, music and key awards. Space dictated that most entries be kept short, and for more detailed information on the writers you may like to consult The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (ed. John Clute and Peter Nicholls). We aimed to produce a book that would be useful as a starting point for exploring the genre and, in order to do this, we decided that we needed to cover all the major themes of SF – from perennial ideas you might expect from experience of the mass media to more unusual concepts that rarely appear in the genre outside books. This is why some authors are not represented by what are usually considered their best books. It is also why most authors have only one book. This approach caused us some difficulties, especially in the cases of writers who are both prolific and brilliant. Robert Silverberg, for example, is one of a number of writers represented here who, it could be argued, deserves a second selection. Even authors of particular significance like Philip K. Dick had to be limited to two entries. Only H.G. Wells, we decided, whose status as the founding father of modern SF makes him unique, should have three entries. In our final choice of books, we focused on titles that we thought both representative of particular themes in SF and singularly important to the development of the genre. We believe SF to be a genre that thrives on debate and we have excluded a number of canonical works and writers at the expense of books and authors whom we feel deserve greater exposure in the hope that this will stimulate it. We have also ignored the constraints of our title by including two short story collections, which we believe are\n\nx\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xi\n\nABOUT THIS BOOK\n\nessential to a full understanding of the history of SF. In this, we were also influenced by the fact that the two writers (John W. Campbell and Harlan Ellison) have been regularly excluded from earlier lists, largely because their finest work is in short story form. We have tried to select books that are reprinted regularly. A trip to your local bookshop armed with a list of your chosen titles should be enough for a bookseller to check their availability for you. We were delighted to find that a large number of classic SF titles were in print either in the USA or UK at the time this book went to press. However, the commercial reality of publishing is such that many classics do remain out of print for years on end, only reaching readers via the goodwill of committed editors at major publishers and dedicated fanatics at small presses. None the less, due to print-on-demand technology and the generally easy availability of out-of-print titles and imports via the internet, hours of scouring second-hand bookshops for that elusive masterpiece should only be an enjoyably serendipitous last resort.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Patricia Jones, Eve Gorton, David & Margaret Andrews, Christopher Priest, Yvonne Aburrow, Heather Bird, Graham Bray, Martin Folkes, Simon Hemmings, Colin Litster, Judy Tither, Peter Waterman, Ian Watson and everyone at A & C Black, especially Jenny Ridout, Katie Taylor, Caroline Ball and Suzi Nicolaou.\n\nxi\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xiii\n\nINTRODUCTION Science fiction has always been an infamously difficult genre to define. Today, after decades of blockbuster movies and popular television series, defining SF (as I will refer to science fiction from now on) is harder than ever. Almost everyone has his or her definition of what SF is – and almost everyone's definition is inadequate. SF writing, in particular, is broader in scope and maturer in execution (as well as older) than anyone judging the genre solely on its manifestations in film and television would realize. Popular misconceptions of SF are understandable, since much of it was published contemporaneously with the growth in the technology that has allowed both the mass media to flourish and SF itself to conquer extra-literary media. Written SF has, therefore, long been in competition with the more accessible ‘sci-fi’ of other media. Since the mid-seventies – a period when written SF reached a point of complexity and seriousness that belied some of its humble origins – the genre has been excessively dominated by cinema, TV and computer games. Less\n\nxiii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xiv\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nvisible to the majority of people in print than it has been in the mass media, SF has come to be defined, in the popular imagination, by its appearances in cinema and television. Books have been a neglected poor relation of competing media with more surface glamour. Ironically, written SF has become a victim of its own prophecies of all-conquering technologies. The seductive hi-tech of Playstation® and the CGI special effects of Hollywood blockbusters have made paperbacks look oldfashioned to generations raised on the immediacy of screens. Books involve more effort from their audience but they offer levels of reward and quality scarce in other media. So, the current popular opinion of SF writing is that it is a literature of implausible adolescent entertainment, fixated on gleaming starships and absurd zap guns, gimmicky time machines, clunky robots and slimy aliens. This perception is a narrow and inaccurate one, based largely on ignorance. Written SF matured a long time ago; mass media SF often still seems to be wrestling with a protracted puberty. This is not to say there is no great SF outside books – directors like Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott, auteurs like David Cronenberg, scriptwriters like Nigel Kneale and rock musicians like David Bowie and Hawkwind are just a few examples of first-rate artists who have worked primarily in mass media SF. The focus of this book is on written SF but we have ensured that the books we have included in this guide are some of the most exciting and stimulating reads in the history of fiction, many of which will appeal to readers whose experience of SF is not predominantly literary. The term ‘novel’ has the same roots as the word ‘novelty’, something of which there is no shortage in SF. What follows in this guide will be far from dry, worthy and dull. We can be confident in claiming that you're in for a wild ride.\n\nxiv\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBefore attempting our own definition of SF, we need to examine its history. As the above makes clear, there has been a myriad of arguments over the decades about what SF is, and there is no consensus. This is healthy. Like all good fiction, SF is enriched by debate. My personal opinion is that it is the definitive literature of change itself. We have seen more of that in the past 200 years than in the whole of previous human history and it is into that past that we need to travel in search of the origins of the genre.\n\nBACK TO THE FUTURE Some commentators have argued that SF first appears in antiquity, with works such as The Epic of Gilgamesh (circa 2000BC), which features flying machines and The True History of Lucian by the Greek author Lucian (circa AD140–180) which covers a trip to the moon and a war in space. However, these and other works of what has been called ‘protoSF’ probably owe as much to mythology and magic as they do to technology. This places Lucian and other pioneers of astounding voyages to strange places firmly in the realm of fantasy writing rather than SF. The Greek legend of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was eternally punished for the gift of knowledge he gave to mankind, could also be a template for some future SF writing. However, most people would argue that mythology and the supernatural are, by definition, unscientific. Since most proto-SF depends on one or the other, it may have to be excluded from the genre. While the modern novel gradually emerged from medieval chivalric romances (which played a central role in the development of the fantasy genre), many writers continued to tell tales of voyages to other\n\nxv\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xvi\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nworlds and some described perfect societies in philosophical works such as Thomas More’s Utopia (1516). Some, such as Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), satirized their own culture by using the metaphor of imperfect societies. (One of the best ways to try to understand the complex and sometimes absurd nature of our world is via a distorting mirror of reality that uses exaggeration to draw our attention to the pivotal events and assumptions of the society that shapes our lives. SF may often be set in the future or on other worlds, but it is often using these settings as symbolic of our present.) However, many critics have argued that SF itself could not exist before the age of scientific method, when accurate observation, rigorous theorizing and repeated proof-making experimentation became the key to technological advance. Before the Enlightenment in the 18th century, tradition and organized religion had checked the forward momentum of knowledge, but the combined social impact of the French Revolution and the innovations of the Industrial Age created the ideal conditions for fiction truly conscious of science to flourish. (It is worth noting here that both social and technological change are central to SF, so to think of the genre only in relation to the 'hard' sciences of physics, engineering, biology and chemistry is a mistake. Other disciplines inevitably have an effect on human beings and SF can also encompass the 'soft' sciences of sociology, psychology, politics and philosophy.) The final condition that set the stage for the arrival of ‘true’ SF was the major trend in early 19th-century arts: Romanticism. Romanticism was a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment but it succeeded in incorporating some of the ideals of 18th-century thinking into its own\n\nxvi\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnew outlook. Romanticism continued to encourage people to enjoy the new intellectual freedom the disciplines of science fostered but it insisted there should also be a focus on the sublime and the wondrous. Although the impact of Romanticism was most strongly felt in poetry and music, it had its effect on fiction, particularly on the form known as the Gothic novel. The power of Gothic writers lay in their willingness to dream and to encourage the kind of ‘sense of wonder’ that has coloured SF ever since the appearance of a book many commentators (notably >> Brian Aldiss) have identified as the first true SF novel: >> Mary Shelley’s 1818 Frankenstein (The entry on Shelley examines this argument.) As the Industrial Revolution gathered pace, SF novels became more common. Speculations on future wars were particularly popular as the implications of more efficient machines and weapons became clear. Utopias also flourished as new political ideas such as socialism began to develop, notably News From Nowhere (1890) by the artist, poet and craftsman William Morris and Erewhon by Samuel Butler (1872). Other new sciences encouraged writers to work on fresh themes. Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), for example, uses pharmacology as a basis for physical and mental transformation that allowed the author to meditate upon the balance of good and evil in man and the potentially destructive power of new knowledge. Most significant in the formulation of what most people today would recognize as SF were the careers of the American author Edgar Allan Poe (1809–49) and the Frenchman >> Jules Verne (1828–1905). Poe was probably the most important writer in the history of genre fiction and\n\nxvii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xviii\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nwas a pioneer of detective fiction, horror and fantasy as well as SF. He wrote short stories almost exclusively (his only novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym is a ‘hollow Earth’ SF story) in a dense GothicRomantic style that inspired writers interested in the bizarre. The emotional intensity of his prose and the melodramatic influence of his alcohol-induced depressions brought a decadent outsider element to the genre. Verne, meanwhile, produced numerous direct, optimistic and adventurous novels from the 1860s onward that had a massive influence over magazine writers to come. Verne dubbed his works ‘voyages extraordinaires’ and they include such classics as Journey to the Centre of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. The fact that many of Verne’s novels (Around the World in Eighty Days, for instance) are straightforward exploration stories with no SF elements and that many of his books were massive bestsellers explains how SF and adventure became synonymous in the popular imagination. At the end of the 19th century, while Verne was the undisputed master of the as yet unnamed genre, the Englishman >> H.G. Wells started producing the ground-breaking books that cemented his reputation as the father of modern SF. Wells described The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds and The Invisible Man (among many others that helped expand what have become perennial themes of SF) as ‘scientific romances’ in order to distinguish them from the social and character-based novels that dominated the fiction of his day. Wells knew his fiction was not realism but, by using the term ‘scientific’, he was affirming that his work had its basis in the rational yet currently improbable, rather than in the magical and the impossible. He was\n\nxviii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nspeculating and extrapolating from the knowledge of his day to suggest the possibilities of tomorrow. His excellent prose skills, the plausibility of his imagination, his fierce intelligence and his literary versatility (Wells was also a distinguished social novelist who explored the new middle classes, feminism and left-wing politics) have ensured that he remains the undisputed Grand Master SF writer for all time.\n\nAMAZING STORIES Some commentators (particularly >> Norman Spinrad) have argued that the history of SF is the history of how it has been marketed, suggesting that if writing is published with the label ‘science fiction’ on its binding, then it is SF, and a book not marketed as such is not SF. This may seem an obvious point but it is a useful one to make. By the early twentieth century, the cheap magazines known as ‘pulps’ (named after the inexpensive paper they were printed on) flooded the news stands of America. The pulps covered genres such as crime, adventure and westerns. Between the Edwardian era and the end of the First World War, writers like >> Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan of the Apes), Robert E. Howard (Conan the Barbarian) and H.P. Lovecraft (The Cthulhu Mythos stories) were setting the standards for pulp writing in the fantasy genre and occasionally producing the odd SF tale. Meanwhile >> E.E. ‘Doc’ Smith was starting to write ‘space operas’. All the elements of Star Wars, the cultural artefact most people today would cite as an example of SF, were present in Smith’s classic works, which is an indication of how far the cinematic and television versions of the genre have trailed behind written SF. Publisher Hugo Gernsback took a decisive step by naming the genre\n\nxix\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xx\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nin his editorial for the first issue of his magazine Amazing Stories (1926). He called it ‘scientifiction’, using the works of Wells, Verne and Poe as examples of what he meant by this new word. By 1929, this unwieldy term had mutated into ‘science fiction’. (Experts have identified European magazines up to fifty years older as exclusively SF magazines and have discovered that a poetry critic used the term even earlier but Gernsback deserves the credit as the first editor to label his publications as ‘science fiction’.) Gernsback was more interested in technological accuracy than literary quality. Verne’s adventure writing, the themes of extraterrestrial life and time travel explored so eloquently by Wells and the lurid, verbose style of Poe came together in Gernsback’s optimistic vision. Science fiction as a publishing category had finally appeared and, through the beliefs of Gernsback and his successor, >> John W. Campbell Jr, magazine-based SF separated itself from mainstream fiction to become a distinct literary genre. Daring themes such as robotics, faster-than-light travel, ESP, computers, parallel worlds and so on became commonplace in genre SF. With notable exceptions, SF in the mainstream has been more conservative in its speculations. Many believe this separation did more harm than good, turning the genre tradition into a ghetto, its stories regarded by general readers as a commercially driven, immature form of fiction (>> Thomas M. Disch has even proposed the idea that SF is a kind of children’s literature). There is some truth in this viewpoint. The poorer examples of pulp SF undoubtedly contributed to the popular idea, still dominant in the media, of SF as childish escapism. But genre SF still possesses a raw energy in its execution and an intellectual audacity in its themes that\n\nxx\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncan make most general fiction seem stilted and mundane by comparison. Some genre SF is very well written indeed. Literary snobbery and pseudo-intellectual ignorance have played their part in damning the magazine tradition as entirely unworthy of serious consideration. Other commentators have expressed a wish to see genre SF rejoin the mainstream from which it diverged, claiming that it is a specifically American model. The true home of SF, in this argument, is Britain. The importance of Swift, Shelley and other writers such as Richard Jefferies (his After London, Wild England (1885) inspired the particularly English disaster novel popularized among general readers by >> John Wyndham) in the formation of the genre adds weight to this argument. Writers working outside the pulps (such as >> Aldous Huxley, Olaf Stapledon and >> George Orwell) continued to produce Wellsian titles enjoyed by general readers and this tendency continues today. There is a huge list of SF novels that have been produced by writers working outside any genre tradition. In 1937, John W. Campbell was appointed editor of Astounding, bringing a new discipline to Gernsback’s vision. Campbell rivalled E.E. Smith as a writer of space opera but, despite his insistence on accurate science, he also had an eye for good prose and storytelling talent, encouraging and discovering the writers who are usually credited with defining modern genre SF. Our entry on Campbell details his significance as the architect of what fans now call the Golden Age. Campbell’s domination of SF continued until the end of the 1940s and the launch of two ground-breaking magazines that brought new levels of intellectual sophistication, literary style and more adult subject matter to the genre. Galaxy and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science\n\nxxi\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxii\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nFiction fostered new authors eager to break with Campbell and his acolytes, some of whom had already produced their definitive works. The Holocaust, atomic bombs and the subsequent Cold War, and the mysterious appearance of flying saucers, ushered in new fears about the way our world was going and provided rich areas for writers to explore. The post-war economic boom in America that produced the consumer culture, the birth of rock and roll, and the widespread availability of TV also broadened the scope for SF that was more focused on the human sciences. Horace Gold at Galaxy and Anthony Boucher at Fantasy & Science Fiction were sophisticated editors, ready to encourage writers keen to tackle this brave new world. Genre SF novels now appeared as books for the first time, having previously been limited to publication as magazine serials. Although paperbacks threatened the pulps so much that they would be all but extinct by the end of the fifties, genre SF flourished as never before or since. >> Alfred Bester introduced dazzling wordplay, >> Frederik Pohl and C.M Kornbluth added sociology, >> Philip José Farmer broke sexual taboos and >> Ray Bradbury’s poetic approach won over mainstream critics, while >> Philip K. Dick threw dice with reality in his wild explorations of human perception. In Britain, traditional SF masters like >> Arthur C. Clarke saw their popularity and expertise grow and John Wyndham became the first example of a genre writer crossing back into the mainstream bestseller list by using a more accessible style that general readers loved. Both Clarke and Wyndham had been active as writers before the Second World War and they paved the way for newcomers in the late fifties like Brian Aldiss and >> J.G. Ballard. British genre SF was curated by E.J. Carnell, editor of New Worlds, the UK equivalent of Astounding and Galaxy rolled into one. xxii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxiii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBRAVE NEW WORLDS, BOLD NEW WAVE OR FROM NEW WAVE TO CYBERPUNK By the early sixties the paperback was king and only the best magazines survived. The next generation of SF writers, emerging at the end of the previous decade, was even more willing to challenge the status quo. Instrumental in sparking the revolution in SF that became known as New Wave (a term appropriated by >> Christopher Priest from French experimental cinema) was >> Michael Moorcock, a young fantasy writer who believed that experimental author >> William S. Burroughs was pointing the way forward to a bolder, more mature SF and that only Ballard and Aldiss were following the lead he was providing. Much of the best SF has always been, metaphorically at least, about the present rather than the future and Burroughs was the one mainstream author of stature (admirers compared him to James Joyce) who was using the satirical and polemical potential of SF to greatest effect. Moorcock took over the editorship of New Worlds in 1964, steering the magazine away from pulp into daring, innovative explorations of drugs, sex, time, politics and art. Moorcock’s anti-heroic stance encouraged powerful young American writers such as Thomas M. Disch, >> John Sladek and Norman Spinrad to move to Swinging London to join him, alongside home-grown talent like Aldiss, Ballard and >> M. John Harrison, in making genre SF part of the counterculture, inspired by experimental modernist literature, Pop Art, the civil rights movement, the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, the Pill, feminism, psychedelic drugs and rock music. In America, the hippies made not only Tolkien’s fantasy The Lord of the Rings but also SF works like >> Robert A. Heinlein’s Stranger in a\n\nxxiii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxiv\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nStrange Land and >> Frank Herbert’s Dune into massive bestsellers. Maverick short-story writer >> Harlan Ellison announced he was editing a ground-breaking anthology entitled Dangerous Visions. Joined by contemporaries like >> Robert Silverberg, >> Samuel R. Delany (the first major black SF author), >> Roger Zelazny, >> Ursula K. Le Guin (the finest female writer of SF to date) and some of the New Worlds writers, plus established masters like Philip K. Dick and Philip José Farmer, the mercurial Ellison pushed the envelope with this book and it became the focus of the American New Wave. It now seemed that anything was possible in SF and that the genre would triumphantly rejoin the mainstream. Female writers became more visible, some (like hardcore feminist >> Joanna Russ) entering SF via the New Wave. Before this time, most publishers of SF magazines regarded their market as composed primarily of young males and consequently courted writers and writing that appealed to a masculine sensibility. Few women had been accepted as pulp writers, so male authors had a head start in exploring the thematic possibilities of the genre. By the sixties, many of the recurrent ideas of genre SF had been thoroughly explored except from feminist angles. As SF is a modernist genre and modernism acclaims the pioneers of new ideas, this was another advantage male writers enjoyed until the New Wave. Additionally, many women choosing a career in imaginative fiction elected to write fantasy instead. Some women authors, like Anne McCaffrey, even write SF that, because of its use of magical symbolism such as dragons, reads like fantasy. Although the high quality of writing by many female SF writers is indisputable, these historical circumstances provide the main explanation for the relatively small number of women authors represented in this book.\n\nxxiv\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor the same reasons, important writers of alternative sexualities and of non-Caucasian ethnicity were also scarce in SF publishing before the New Wave. Since the dawn of the seventies, far more women and those of sexual and racial minorities have written and read SF, but the influence of the mass youth culture in popularizing the genre ensured that big publishing houses and film studios would continue to put their commercial focus on traditional SF written by white Anglo-Saxon males, many of them by now famous. Genre SF entered the realms of big business as elder statesmen like Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein and Herbert commanded huge advances from publishers and produced massive bestsellers. New Wave writers like Ballard, Priest and >> Keith Roberts worked hard at blurring the boundaries between genre SF and mainstream literature in Britain and the Dangerous Visions contributors watched their awards pile high as their audacity became an acceptable facet of American SF. Hard SF made a comeback as the decade progressed. Writers with engineering backgrounds like >> Larry Niven followed the traditional right-wing model established by Robert Heinlein, while other scientist-authors like >> Joe Haldeman and >> Gregory Benford produced SF that showed the influence of both conservative and New Wave writing. By the late seventies, written SF seemed to be running out of steam and the fantasy publishing boom began to gather pace. Once, it would have been impossible for even a large bookshop to shelve fantasy separately, as ‘sword and sorcery’ (the most popular variant of the genre) was written only by a handful of authors. Fantasies ended up being shelved with SF and, indeed, some seminal authors wrote variants of both. However, since the early eighties, fantasies have become as\n\nxxv\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxvi\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\ncommon as SF paperbacks and the dividing lines between them have become increasingly blurred, contributing greatly to public misconception of SF as predominantly clichéd, juvenile material. For, although there are many excellent fantasy works that should be sampled by all kinds of readers, the large majority of such books are highly derivative and formulaic, merely riffing on The Lord of the Rings. In the age of the pulp magazines, fantasy and SF were published in different periodicals (with only a handful of exceptions), again an indication that editors had established there were two distinct genre markets to serve. Today, bookshops, recent marketing by publishers and journalists who habitually use contradictory labels such as ‘science fiction fantasy’ have all contributed to this muddying of the genre waters and SF fans themselves have not always helped when they have impishly voted for the occasional fantasy novel as a Hugo award winner, further confusing the general reader. In the late seventies Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET thrillingly revitalized popular cinema, but they contributed to the simultaneous commercial success and dumbing-down of genre SF, as mediocre tie-in books became bestsellers. On the other hand, bold, superb films like Alien, Blade Runner and Videodrome partially inspired the next generation of American genre writers, who sought to find a true hybrid between hard science and New Wave experimentalism. These were the cyberpunks. Their understanding of the coming information age combined with an attitude derived from the rock groups of the era brought a blast of cold, thin air into the lungs of readers. >> William Gibson, >> Bruce Sterling and >> Pat Cadigan brought an exhilarating postmodern edge to genre SF that made the mainstream critics (used\n\nxxvi\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nby now to the literary ability of the British New Wave) sit up and take notice. Cyberpunk engaged with virtual reality, body modification, artificial intelligence and urban blight in a manner that was stunningly contemporary. Sterling’s Mirrorshades anthology was the manifesto for this new angle of attack. Almost twenty years later The Matrix appeared, instantly popularizing cyberpunk concepts that had been around in written SF for a long time. Young British writers responded to cyberpunk by using the post-New Worlds magazine Interzone to launch a new British renaissance in radical hard SF in the late eighties, emboldened by the success of >> Iain M. Banks. (An unfortunate effect of this was that New Wave veterans were occasionally left out in the cold – Keith Roberts, Christopher Priest and M. John Harrison were often marketed and published as writers of general fiction, which lost them sales to less well-informed genre readers.) Fantasy fiction continued to flourish, restricting the shelf space and publisher spending previously earmarked for SF. Readers in the nineties did, however, embrace the likes of >> Peter F. Hamilton, Dan Simmons and >> Michael Swanwick, whose galaxy-spanning adventures and ease with the language of technology updated the space opera for the internet generation. While many find the new radical hard SF and postmillennial cyberpunk of today exhilarating, others claim that its occasional technobabble has returned SF to the genre ghetto it occupied before the New Wave. Another argument would be that SF has actually won its battle for credibility without sacrificing its outsider status: mobile phones, PCs, iPods, cosmetic surgery and newscasts about cloning and environmental crisis are all around us. We live in a world that SF predicted. SF\n\nxxvii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxviii\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nthemes also continue to reinvigorate the mainstream, with books like Cloud Atlas, The Time Traveller’s Wife, Oryx and Crake and Never Let Me Go, all of which borrow from SF, filling the bestseller charts in the Sunday supplements.\n\nSF, MORE THAN SCI-FI After this swift précis of the history of SF, it should be easier to agree a definition. But even the label itself remains uncertain. Judith Merril, Heinlein, Ellison and Margaret Atwood have argued that the term ‘speculative fiction’ should be used instead of ‘science fiction’ in order to broaden the possibilities for the genre so that works outside the technology-fixated Campbellian tradition can be included. Critic Robert Scholes has suggested ‘structural fabulation’, a highly technical literary term that allows closer connections with mainstream postmodernism and fantasy. The mass media prefers the flippant and dismissively pejorative ‘sci-fi’ but hardcore readers dislike its association with the poorer TV series and clichéd movies. I suggest that ambiguously calling the genre ‘SF’, without an insistence on a firm decoding of the term, will allow the audience to find their own personal meaning. Author Damon Knight said that science fiction is what we point at when we say the words. I feel that any all-encompassing definition would involve a sense of the historical progression of the genre from Frankenstein onwards but would point to ideas of ‘conceptual breakthrough’ and ‘paradigm shift’ as the essential meat of SF. The genre inevitably involves the reader (and often the characters in the story) breaking through into a new understanding of the universe or in a fresh situation unlike any humankind has previously encountered. SF stories\n\nxxviii\n\n01 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n8:44 pm\n\nPage xxix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\noften begin with an unfamiliar worldview (or paradigm) that shifts our consciousness into looking at the universe in a fresh way. For example, what if there were a scientist who could create a man by combining electrical engineering, chemistry, dubious surgical techniques and parts of dead bodies? The impact of such an innovation would change our society into something fundamentally different. The possibilities of today’s genetic engineering technology imply that soon Frankenstein may be more than just science fiction…. The debate about what SF is will continue but I’m confident that, by the time you’ve read this book and our suggested novels, you’ll have discovered dozens of superb, entertaining writers and you’ll be able to start deciding for yourself what science fiction is. By that time, the real world will resemble an SF novel even more closely than it does already. For now, I’ll conclude this introduction with my own definition of SF: SF is the literature that suggests the significant, scientifically explicable changes that may potentially occur in the sphere of human knowledge and experience, exploring how they might affect our minds, bodies and culture. Happy reading. Stephen E.

The result has been a radical alteration in the flora and fauna on the planet. The sunward side of the Earth is largely given over to plants and it is dominated by the vast efflorescence of a gigantic, multi-levelled tree. While the vegetation and plant species, many of them weird and wonderful, and brilliantly described by Aldiss, have flourished, human life has retreated to one of the lowest rungs of the ecological ladder. Stranded amid the fecund jungle of the future, and surrounded by the berrywhisks, trappersnappers, oystermaws and wiltmilts of Aldiss’s imagination, the greenskinned descendants of man have to struggle to survive. The story focuses on a boy named Gren who is taken away from his tribe and comes into contact with an intelligent fungus intent on using humans for its own purposes. Linked to the fungus in a symbiotic relationship, Gren and others are led on a journey that eventually takes them to the dark side of the planet. Like Non-Stop, Aldiss’s first SF novel, Hothouse follows a human quest to understand the nature of the world. The narrative is driven 1\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 2\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nforward by Gren’s voyage further and further into the unknown but what the reader eventually remembers of Hothouse is not so much the quest itself as the inventiveness with which Aldiss creates his alternative world. Aldiss has been an important figure in British SF for close on half a century and his Helliconia trilogy, first published in the 1980s, is an epic vision of the rise and fall of civilizations but his earlier novels, of which Hothouse is a fine example, can scarcely be matched for the sense of wonder and astonishment they evoke.

The classic 1940s’ vision of the robot (although the stories were not published in book form until 1950, they had mostly appeared in SF magazines in the previous decade) is that of Isaac Asimov. Built around the famous Three Laws of Robotics, the stories collected in I, Robot did much to shape popular notions of what a robot might be and it is 2\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 3\n\nISAAC ASIMOV\n\ndifficult to over-estimate their influence. Although the three laws were created by Asimov in close collaboration with Astounding editor >> John W. Campbell, it was Asimov who used them to most memorable effect. The nine stories in I, Robot, self-contained but tied together by the character of Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist working for the company which first manufactured the thinking machines, explore the consequences and implications of the laws when humans and robots interact. Through the stories Asimov not only builds up a gripping fictional history of the development of robotics from the late 20th century to the late 21st century but also sets out the logical and moral dilemmas that face both humans and robots as machine intelligence grows more powerful. In one story a robot on a space station, after logically deducing the existence of a deity, decides to serve God rather than man; in another a telepathic robot struggles to reconcile contradictory interpretations of the Laws and self-destructs when it finds it impossible to do so. Asimov’s inventive stories, ranging in tone from darkly dystopian to humorous, examine questions about the dividing line between man and machine that have always intrigued SF writers.

Hari Seldon, a professor of psychohistory (statistical and psychological prediction of the future), foresees a disastrous era of war and anarchy in the empire to come, and establishes two Foundations on the galaxy’s edge, apparently dedicated to safeguarding civilized knowledge until it is again required. This first volume concentrates on the first Foundation, allowing readers to watch its history unfold over more than a century in a series of snapshots from the passing decades. More of Seldon’s long-term plans are revealed, years after his death. The influence of the Foundation begins to spread from the planet on which it was originally established to neighbouring worlds. Through the power of religion and trade, the seeds of a new civilization in waiting are planted. Originally published in instalments in >> John W. Campbell’s Astounding magazine (which explains the episodic structure of the books), the Foundation trilogy is a massively ambitious attempt to map out the decline and eventual resurrection of an entire galaxy-wide civilization. Working on such a vast canvas, Asimov has little opportunity (or indeed inclination) to make use of subtlety of characterization or carefully nuanced plotting but this scarcely matters. In Foundation, he is not concerned with the ordinary and the everyday but with the large-scale workings of history and destiny. The grandeur of his imagination as he allows it the scope to play with the rise and fall of empires remains impressive more than fifty years after the books were first published. In later life Asimov returned to the Foundation universe to write a series of sequels. All are disappointing when compared to the 4\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 5\n\nJ.G.

An expedition heads southwards from the Arctic to study the flora and fauna of this new world. One of the expedition members is a scientist named Robert Kerans. Amid the lush swamplands and hidden monuments of a drowned London, Kerans begins to experience strange dreams. Just as the Earth has regressed to a past state, so too Kerans seems to be making a psychic descent into prehistory. Left in the primal lagoons covering the city when the expedition heads back north, Kerans and two 5\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 6\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\ncolleagues begin to respond to the deep, atavistic urges that are calling to them from the surreal landscape but they are interrupted by the arrival of Strangman, a dandified pirate with a cohort of violent henchmen intent on plundering the drowned world. Ballard’s fascination with the exploration of inner space and with plumbing the psychic depths, so unusual and liberating in the SF of the early 1960s, is most brilliantly revealed in The Drowned World. His prescience in describing a world transformed by environmental catastrophe may seem all the greater as the years pass but the strength of the novel lies not so much in this as in the voluptuous power with which he conjures up his vision of a primeval landscape and its effects on those who enter it. The Drowned World is a short novel but it is one that provides a startling and memorable perspective on the conscious and subconscious mind.

Recuperating after a minor light aircraft accident, aviation publisher Paul Sinclair accompanies his 6\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 7\n\nJ.G.

Repelled yet intrigued by bluff, burly psychologist Wilder Penrose, the would-be caretaker of EdenOlympia’s hollow soul, Paul decides to investigate the mystery of the assassinations only to discover that behind the serene blandness of the colony lies a disturbing new social development. For where there is apparent clinical calm, a new kind of cathartic brutality is arising from a most unexpected source. Echoing his early collection Vermillion Sands, Super-Cannes might be described as the second volume of a thematic tetralogy Ballard has produced recently (including Cocaine Nights, Millennium People and Kingdom Come), focusing on the effects of excessive luxury upon the middle classes. There are similarities between these books and his savage 1970s’ urban series (Crash, Concrete Island and High Rise), as both sequences push the envelope of contemporary psychopathology with bullseye observations singularly relevant to their times. While hardcore Ballardians may rightly claim that the author will never produce a work more extreme than the epochal road-accident fetishism of Crash, his recent imagery is seductively subtle while his world-class prose has never been better. Although Ballard has only produced one pure SF novel since the late sixties (Hello America), Super-Cannes is a masterful speculation in social science that can arguably be claimed for the genre. Alongside >> Dick and >> Priest, Ballard has done more to make us consider how (post)modernity has altered our consciousness. His significance as a cultural icon is mirrored by the success of slipstream novels like American Psycho and Fight Club where reality is what the protagonists say it is. 7\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 8\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nRead on Mark Adlard, Interface; Martin Bax, The Hospital Ship; >> William Gibson, Pattern Recognition; >> Christopher Priest, The Quiet Woman; >> Robert Silverberg, To Live Again\n\nIAIN M. BANKS\n\n(b. 1954) UK\n\nTHE PLAYER OF GAMES (1988) Nearly all of Banks’s science fiction works are set in the seemingly utopian society of the far future he calls the Culture, a vast galaxy-wide civilization in which man and machine live in symbiotic harmony and individuals are allowed the time and the opportunity to develop their every talent and indulge their every desire. Nearly all of his plots begin at the point where apparent utopia either begins to break down or encounters less admirable societies. The central character of The Player of Games is Jernau Gurgeh, a man from the Culture whose entire life revolves around the playing of strategy games. In a society where leisure and recreation are so important, Gurgeh’s expertise is valued and he is a famous and honoured man. He is also a dissatisfied man who feels that there should be more than endless comfort and privilege in his life. When the opportunity arises to take part in perhaps the greatest game in the universe, Gurgeh seizes it. As it expands, the Culture constantly comes into contact with other, less advanced societies. One of these is the Empire. The Empire is a society entirely\n\n8\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 9\n\nIAIN M. BANKS\n\nfounded on the playing of an elaborate war game. Success or failure in the game dictates each individual’s position in the hierarchy. The greatest of all players becomes Emperor. Gurgeh journeys to the Empire to play as a guest in the game and succeeds beyond everyone’s expectations. As he progresses further and further through the Empire’s elaborate tournament, the dangers to his well-being grow and he learns more and more about the brutal realities that underpin the Empire’s apparent civilization. Banks is well known as a mainstream novelist (his first book, The Wasp Factory, remains controversial more than twenty years after publication) but his science fiction is also integral to his work as a writer and is clearly important to Banks himself. Within the vast, imaginative universe he has created in the Culture, he is able to tell stories which play wittily with ideas and concepts that he would struggle to incorporate in his non-SF fiction.

Henry Meacher is a geologist who travels to Edinburgh to investigate moon rock collected years earlier in the Apollo mission. Dust samples from the moon rock escape the laboratory and fall on the extinct volcano in the heart of the city. Soon the volcano is extinct no longer and the ‘moonseed’, its effects spreading rapidly, threatens Earth with the same explosive end as Venus. A race is on to save humanity and the only hope seems to lie in a mass evacuation to the moon. Neglected space technology has to be quickly revived to ensure a future for the survivors of the ongoing disaster. Baxter, a graduate in mathematics and engineering, is one of the leading exponents of contemporary hard SF. His doomsday scenario in Moonseed is worked out with a strict adherence to scientific possibility and the practicality of the desperate attempts to leave a stricken Earth are described with a loving attention to detail and plausibility. Yet Baxter never neglects the storytelling essentials required to maintain the reader’s interest. His plotting is cleverly organized to maximize the tension as the countdown to destruction continues and his characters, especially the flawed but credible Meacher, ring true. Baxter is a versatile and imaginative writer, whose other books range from epic\n\n10\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 11\n\nBARRINGTON J.

BAYLEY THE GARMENTS OF CAEN\n\n(b. 1937) UK\n\n(1976)\n\nIn the Ziode Cluster, tailoring is a mundane occupation that ensures Peder Forbath remains a man of slender means, insignificant to the rest of society. But in Caen, a neighbouring galactic spiral arm, clothes are more than mere vestments, they are a way of life, encompassing not only a human being’s philosophy but expanding his supernormal potential to boot. While the garments of Caen are illegal in the conservative Ziode, Forbath longs to elevate tailoring to its highest potential and become known as a Sartorial, the designation tailors enjoy in the culture next door. Falling in with foppish liqueur-sipping chancer Realto\n\n11\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 12\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nMaast, Forbath participates in an illegal salvage mission on a frontier planet, raiding a wrecked cargo ship which contains a stash of Caenic couture that the duo will fence on the black market. But unknown to the villainous Maast, Peder has kept the prize of the haul for himself, a legendary Franchonard suit, one of only five in existence, much prized even in vogueish Caen. Soon Forbath finds his personality and fortunes transformed by his enigmatic garb, but Maast has learned of the deception and initiates a pursuit that leads to a galactic odyssey in which the clothes really do make the man. Colourful, fast-moving and witty, The Garments of Caen is typical of Barry Bayley’s inventive approach to traditional SF. With engaging characters and a vivid prose style that has an affinity with that of >> Alfred Bester, >> M. John Harrison and his friend >> Michael Moorcock, Bayley is one of the most vital and entertaining of British writers, tackling perennial subjects such as space opera, time travel, robots and aliens in a refreshing manner that leaves the majority of genre SF authors standing. Although the book we’ve selected here is one of his most playful works, Bayley is equally at home with darker themes due to his affiliations with the British New Wave. We strongly recommend his novels to jaded readers looking for surprising takes on themes other writers have worn thin with overuse.

Usually the alien is out there – in the far reaches of space or on a distant planet. In Blood Music, almost more terrifyingly, the alien is within. In the last twenty-five years biology has replaced physics as the science that both promises us most and threatens us most, and SF has not been slow to take up the themes that DNA and genetic engineering have offered. Blood Music is one of the earliest and finest works of fiction to bring together the new biology and the old SF theme of the alien. Vergil Ulam is a maverick scientist who is sacked from the laboratory in which he has been carrying out cutting-edge experiments in cell biology. In order to continue with the work he has been doing, he injects his experimental cells into his own bloodstream. However, the cells have their own intelligence and, lodged within Ulam’s body, they begin to evolve and mutate until they have taken it over and reworked his mind and consciousness for their benefit. Not only is Ulam now a vehicle for the cell intelligence but he is also highly infectious. The blood and brain plague he has unleashed is about to spread through humanity. Only a few people seem to carry an immunity to the mutating cells but they can do little to halt a process which is changing life and consciousness irreversibly. Carrying echoes of ideas that have been present in SF since it began (the Frankenstein story of the hubristic scientist losing control of his own creation is an obvious influence), Blood Music is also a masterly fictional embodiment of much more contemporary debates. As genetic\n\n13\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 14\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nengineering and the possibilities of downloading consciousness to machines beckon us towards a post-human or transhuman future, Bear’s engrossing novel remains essential reading.

In the physics department at the University of California, Dr Gordon Bernstein is working on an experiment to measure nuclear resonance in a chemical compound. What should be a smooth piece of research is being affected by interference recorded by the monitoring apparatus. Establishing that the rogue data is no equipment problem, Bernstein realizes that the experiment is picking up a signal in Morse. Despite pressure from his academic peers to explain away the strange phenomenon in a manner acceptable to the scientific establishment, Bernstein secretly passes the data to a biochemist for interpretation. Ostracized by the academic community, Bernstein develops a startling new theory that will change physics, make his name and possibly alter the future. At Cambridge University in 1998 another scientist is\n\n14\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 15\n\nGREGORY BENFORD\n\nattempting to utilize faster-than-light particles known as tachyons to send a message back to 1962 that could prevent the environmental collapse that threatens his world. Timescape is the perfect answer to the misconceived argument that scientists cannot write excellent novels and it is one of the finest depictions of academic life in fiction. Benford is Professor of Physics at the University of California and his work has been acclaimed by both hard SF writers and literary figures such as >> Anthony Burgess and >> M. John Harrison. Timescape is scientifically accurate when it deals with contemporary theories about time. Smoothly written in a realistic style, it is packed with superbly realized characters of both sexes, including Peterson, the coolly calculating womanizer from the World Council of 1998, Penny, Bernstein’s spiky, proto-hippy girlfriend and the awkward, tenacious Bernstein himself.

Haunted by a recurrent, violent nightmare of a faceless man, Reich seeks the help of a telepathic psychiatrist. Realizing that the only means to banish the dreams is to rid himself of business rival D’Courtney, Reich sets himself the objective of killing his fiscal archenemy. But in a world filled with ‘Peepers’, ESPer police who can read any mind, no man has got away with murder for decades. Disguising his homicidal intent by endlessly repeating a specially written mnemonic jingle in his head, Reich embarks on his atavistic purpose that could bestow upon him the ultimate sentence: demolition. Lightning-paced, hard and glittering like the multiple facets of a cut diamond, The Demolished Man was not only Bester’s first novel but also the first recipient of the Hugo Award for Best Novel. Having worked on newspaper comic strips, radio serials and short stories, Bester’s disciplined, taut prose had no equal in the early fifties and this novel (published in Galaxy) raised the bar for writers wishing to escape the strictures >> John W. Campbell had imposed upon magazine SF and create a fresh species of increasingly literate, socially aware speculations. Alongside his quicksilver plotting, razor-edged characters and enough energy to fuel a particle accelerator, Bester employed innovative techniques (such as using typographic layouts borrowed from concrete poetry in order to represent the mental conversations of Telepaths). The vibrant word-painting he brought to SF inspired future mavericks such\n\n16\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 17\n\nALFRED BESTER\n\nas >> Delany, >> Ellison, >> Moorcock and >> Gibson, all of whom strove to further the modernist literary qualities of the genre. The best was yet to come: sublime short stories (the very best of which are collected in Virtual Unreality, which many believe are the greatest in the history of genre SF) appeared throughout the fifties alongside Bester’s next novel (The Stars My Destination), a landmark work that outstrips even the senses-shattering genius of The Demolished Man, a book which none the less remains one of the most exhilarating rides SF has ever offered.

However, Gully succeeds in navigating his crippled ship to the Sargasso Asteroid, an isolated space outpost where the inhabitants have reverted to tribal savagery, and eventually escapes back to Earth where he starts his campaign of vengeance against the crew members of the Vorga. Slowly, driven by his overwhelming desire for revenge, he moves closer and closer to Presteign of Presteign, the fabulously wealthy owner of the\n\n17\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 18\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nVorga, who has his own reasons for wanting a confrontation with Gully. The Stars My Destination is a breathtaking narrative that scarcely ever pauses for a moment as its implacable anti-hero relentlessly pursues his goals. On the future Earth that Bester imagines, a man named Jaunte has discovered a means of mental transportation which takes his name. Jaunting is at the heart of The Stars My Destination, just as ESP fuels the plot of The Demolished Man, and the plot moves with the same speed as jaunters propelling themselves through space. The sheer prodigality of Bester’s inventiveness is remarkable. Ideas which another writer would have stretched out to support an entire novel, Bester recklessly and exhilaratingly throws away in the space of a paragraph or two. The book is dominated by the driven outsider Gully Foyle, one of the most unforgettable characters in all of SF, but it is also a vehicle for its author’s pyrotechnic displays of imagination. >> Harlan Ellison once said that, ‘Bester was the mountain, all the rest of us merely climbers toward that peak’, and The Stars My Destination, together with The Demolished Man, reveals just why other writers continue to admire him so much.

Despite the mild cynicism Paul employs to dampen his continued attachment to RuthClaire, he has to admit she is correct: the mysterious visitor is a specimen of Homo Habilis, one of mankind’s ancestors thought to be extinct for a million years. But what is ‘Handy Man’ doing in contemporary Bible Belt USA? To Paul’s dismay, RuthClaire coaxes ‘Adam’ into the couple’s former shared home and shortly the Habiline is sharing her bed. Stifling his jealousy, Paul’s sidelined role in the ménage shifts when the world’s scientific and tabloid press discover Adam, and the local Ku Klux Klan takes an unhealthy interest in the protohuman’s racial provenance. Just as RuthClaire accepts a commission to paint a tableware set depicting the genealogical tree of the family Hominidae, Adam is forced to defend himself in a manner that will have tragic consequences. Michael Bishop emerged as a leading writer of anthropological SF in the seventies, displaying his interest in human behaviour in a number of novels set on other planets. Displaying an ease with social comedy written in a persuasive mainstream style, Ancient of Days tackles the question of how we define ourselves in a warm, dignified manner. Deftly ensuring that the absurd elements of Adam’s spiritual transformation from nut-nibbler to amateur theologian never descend into slapstick, this gently amusing yet thoughtful book also conjures\n\n19\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 20\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nconsiderable sympathy for the ousted Paul without descending into mawkishness. Bishop also wrote the first SF novel about >> Philip K. Dick, the gripping homage The Secret Ascension (aka Philip K. Dick is Dead, Alas).

One of the scientists, a biologist named Ramon RuizSanchez, is also a Jesuit priest and, as he studies Lithia and its dominant species, an intelligent reptile twice the height of humans, he begins to ask himself questions about the nature of Lithian society. Is Lithia the paradise it seems, a place where perfect peace and\n\n20\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 21\n\nJAMES BLISH\n\ncontentment reign, or is it something entirely different? Is it, in fact, a planet created by the devil specifically to tempt man with a vision of an unfallen world? As the narrative shifts back to Earth and follows the growth to adulthood of Egtverchi, a young Lithian who has been sent back with the exploratory team, Ruiz-Sanchez’s doubts and crises of conscience only grow worse until he is impelled towards a dramatic and irreversible resolution of them. Nearly fifty years after its first publication, A Case of Conscience remains one of the most unusual and thought-provoking SF novels ever written. Blish gives no indication that we are supposed to assume that the Jesuit’s beliefs about Lithia are correct. His interest is not in religion as such but in the moral dilemmas that confrontation with ‘otherness’ produces. The conclusions at which Ruiz-Sanchez arrives are not those likely to be reached by most readers but the genuine agonies of conscience he suffers are brilliantly evoked. In his later career, Blish worked largely on Star Trek novelizations but his original fiction, from Cities in Flight (a collection of linked stories in which tramp cities, plucked from their terrestrial settings, wander the universe) to A Case of Conscience, makes philosophically stimulating and imaginative reading.

Everyone talks about the first manned expedition to Mars, seduced by the majesty of the escapade. We follow the failures of their first missions, learn of the shifting physical and psionic character of the child-like yet calculating Martians as the latter realize that the invaders from the third planet are not going to relinquish their dreams of dominion easily. Reading like the steps of a swooning dance that so often ends in shadow, the book shows the Martians advancing in their silver masks as death stalks the sons of Earth. Like virtually all the genre SF novels written before the mid-fifties, The Martian Chronicles comprised a sequence of linked stories that were published in the pulps. But The Martian Chronicles was not a serial, but a collection of vignettes. Freed from the convention of a narrative that focused on a handful of characters, this approach allowed Bradbury to exploit fresh angles on (and startling insights into) the diverse aspects of men and Martians with each successive tale. The result is a singularly compulsive book that expertly explores humanity’s naïve expectations of the alien and the thoughtless cruelty of our predispositions as conquerors. The author also expresses the strangeness of the inscrutable Martians with a lyrical gift that still fascinates readers today. Bradbury’s early history as a deft exponent of crime, fantasy and horror stories ensured that by the late forties he was a virtuoso of shock, a quality that he matched with a homely charm that outstripped all his contemporaries. The Martian Chronicles saw the flowering of Bradbury’s 22\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 23\n\nRAY BRADBURY\n\nmature, poetic style that won him boundless praise from mainstream critics, resulting in a career as one of the definitive short story writers for the slick magazines. The Martian Chronicles is a flawless introduction to the planetary romance for anyone who has never read SF and it continues to be luxuriated in by those whose shelves groan with the weight of gaudy paperbacks.

In the oppressive society of the future, books and the potentially liberating knowledge they contain are illegal. At first happy in his work and his life, Montag begins to question the values of his world. His friendship with the teenage Clarisse McClellan, whose openness to experience and to nature stands in contrast to his wife’s 23\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 24\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nbrain-numbing addiction to interactive television and tranquilizers, unsettles him. So too does the inexplicable behaviour of an old woman to whose house he is called. Rather than abandon her books, she burns with them. What power can books have that some people are prepared to die rather than relinquish them? Not for the first time, Montag steals a book from one of the collections he is supposed to burn. When he hears of the death of Clarisse in a car accident, he falls even further into depression and confusion. As the novel progresses, the fireman is torn between his old life, represented by his boss Captain Beatty, and a new, clandestine world of books and ideas, personified by the retired Professor Faber. Finally, after a climactic confrontation with Beatty, Montag faces a choice between conformity and freedom. He chooses freedom and escapes to join an outlaw group of intellectuals who have memorized the world’s great books in order to preserve them for the future. Beginning life as a short story called ‘The Fireman’ which was published in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1951, Fahrenheit 451 appeared in its extended, book form two years later.

The Shockwave Rider, with its prescient vision of computer networks and viruses, is often cited as a forerunner of cyberpunk. Stand on Zanzibar not only tackles the theme of overpopulation unflinchingly but it does so in a marvellously ambitious array of styles and techniques that owes more to major American modernist fiction like John Dos Passos’s USA than it does to the average SF novel. Stand on Zanzibar has always been Brunner’s most highly acclaimed book (it won both the Hugo award and the inaugural BSFA award in the year it was published) but The Sheep Look Up, published three years later, is an equally challenging dystopia which took the then unfashionable subject of environmental degradation and conjured from it a dark yet gripping vision of a dying world. Water shortages cause chaos, climate change is devastating the planet and new diseases have emerged to plague humanity. At the heart of Brunner’s story is the environmentalist Austin Train, whose writings cataloguing our abuse of the Earth have become bestsellers, and who has become the unwitting (and sometimes unwilling) inspiration for thousands of ‘Trainites’ across the USA. But, like Stand on Zanzibar, The Sheep Look Up is a portrait of a sick world painted on a giant canvas. The narrative branches out in dozens of directions; an array of characters, from millionaires and muckraking journalists to TV\n\n25\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 26\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nstars and political radicals, jostles for the reader’s attention; and Brunner makes use of every means he can devise (news reports from around the world, transcripts of interviews, advertizements) in order to tell his story of a planet racing towards its doom.

But each journey brings a little more information about the strange artefact back to Earth and eventually the maze is mapped. Barker’s bloody-minded, perverse courage and the faith in science of Edward Hawks, the man who created the machinery to transmit the duplicates to the moon, have been justified. Algis Budrys was born in East Prussia in 1931 and came to America with his Lithuanian family when he was five years old. He has not been a prolific writer and he is another of those many SF authors whose best work can arguably be found in their short stories rather than in their longer fiction. However, Rogue Moon remains an utterly compelling novel, as gripping in its analysis of the complicated psychologies of its central characters as it is in the unfolding of its plot. The image of the enigmatic alien artefact, the purpose of which is never discovered, the deranged determination with which Barker resurrects himself over and over again and Hawks’s indomitable belief in the power of the human mind to overcome all obstacles remain with the reader long after the book is finished.

The novel is narrated by Alex, one of the gang members, in the distinctive argot used by the teenagers, derived largely from corrupted Russian words and known as ‘nadsat’. Alex is a paradoxical anti-hero. He is a thug whose ideas of a good time involve rape and blood-letting but he is also a passionate enthusiast for classical music, especially the works of Beethoven. After breaking into a house and beating an old man to death, Alex is arrested and forced to become the subject of an experiment in advanced aversion therapy. Films of violence and torture are shown to him while drugs induce sickness and vomiting. With his favourite Ludwig van playing as background music, Alex learns a connection between violence and his own physical discomfort. When he emerges from the experiment, he is apparently cured of his taste for antisocial behaviour but he has also lost his delight in Beethoven. Burgess’s arguments in favour of free will and his distaste for the kind of conditioning inflicted on Alex are clear enough but the strength of A Clockwork Orange lies not so much in any ‘message’ its narrative may contain but in the extraordinary inventiveness and energy of the language in which it is written. In later years, the multi-talented Burgess, who published many other novels, claimed not to care for A Clockwork Orange and expressed regret that it seemed likely to be the book for which he would be best remembered. More than a decade after his death, it is still his best-known work by far, but Burgess’s dislike of it 28\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 29\n\nEDGAR RICE BURROUGHS\n\nseems difficult to understand. As a blackly comic vision of a violent future, written in language of startling originality, A Clockwork Orange remains one of the most memorable of all SF dystopias.

Although the lower Martian gravity gives Carter stupendous agility relative to his size, he is nevertheless snared by a giant, four-armed, green-skinned alien known as a Thark. Despite entering a near-deserted Martian citadel as a captive, Carter gradually wins the respect of the brutal yet honourable humanoids, developing telepathic powers and proving his mettle as a warrior in the arena. When a flotilla of mysterious airships appears above their city, the monstrous Tharks bring one down, capturing a 29\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 30\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\ncopper-skinned, sable-maned woman of impeccable beauty – the delectable Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, mistress of an empire that has long been the nemesis of Carter’s hosts…. The first of eleven books of Barsoom, this slender volume is the classic pulp vision of Mars: dead seas, oviparous aliens, strange customs and high adventure. Although the science in the book is negligible, its striking setting and bold use of fantasy elements have ensured that this landmark novel has the best claim to being the original Planetary Romance – its vivid colours and lively inventiveness, tinted with sharp heroism and discreet flashes of eroticism confirm it as the seminal work of the subgenre that developed in its wake. Even after decades of numerous imitations, it remains an unputdownable exploit with a cliffhanger finish that leaves the reader ravenous for more tales of Carter and Thoris. Princess was Edgar Rice Burroughs’ first book, which was soon followed by Tarzan of the Apes and a host of other definitive SF and fantasy novels. Although as a literary stylist his work is closer in quality to that of Verne than Wells, Burroughs’ mastery in creating noble yet savage heroes combined with a command of adventure narrative that rivals Conan Doyle made him one of the most important pioneers in the development of genre fiction.

The Mob has loathsome appetites, exploiting their target planet to the max by draining its energies and deriving repulsive sexual kicks from the enslaved populace whom they manipulate through all manner of addictions. Working through politician and board director puppets, the Mob generate WMD conflicts, escaping into outer space before the planet goes ‘nova’ in thermonuclear war. An anti-organization called The Nova Police is fronted by Inspector J. Lee, a being dedicated to snapping antibiotic handcuffs on the aliens. When the Mob reaches Earth, cosmic alarms trigger and Lee (Burroughs himself) and his operatives materialize on primitive Terra, the inspector admitting he has never seen such fear and degradation. Burroughs was magus of the Beats, a literary movement that inspired generations of underground nonconformists. Homosexual, dope fiend and SF reader, Burroughs’ most celebrated book is The Naked Lunch, originally issued by legendary avant-garde/pornography publisher Olympia Press. Denounced as obscene by some and fêted as a masterpiece by others, this collection of sketches has been described as the first part of a trilogy. However, The Naked Lunch does not use the same basic narrative (described above) as The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded and Nova Express, although it is thematically similar. The Nova Trilogy (which can be read in any order) also employs the radical ‘cut-up’ technique Burroughs is infamous for, whereas The Naked Lunch does not. Devised by surrealist painter Brion Gysin, these experiments involved Burroughs taking pages from books (including >> Henry Kuttner’s Fury), magazines and newspapers then scissoring them\n\n32\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 33\n\nWILLIAM S. BURROUGHS\n\ninto strips, creating new sentences. Startling juxtapositions and striking images sometimes resulted from these games, which Burroughs then incorporated into his SF, often creating dizzying effects of randomness and shamanic repetition. Although challenging for the reader, the finished text is extremely exciting once one grows familiar with this innovative approach. The Ticket That Exploded is the most avant-garde and rewarding of the trilogy. As many readers try The Naked Lunch and never finish it, we recommend everyone read Junky (Burroughs’ straightforward yet superb autobiographical novel about heroin addiction) first before tackling other Burroughs as this will familiarize them with the narcotics slang and countercultural scenarios the author uses throughout his work. The fundamental influence on the New Wave, Burroughs’ amazing non-linear satires are essential reading for an understanding of contemporary literary SF. Read on Burroughsian New Wave: >> J.G.

Gabe Ludovic works in marketing for Diversifications Inc., an IT multinational producing medical implants. Routinely spending his time in virtual reality simulations with people he has never actually met, Gabe’s career is on the slide and his marriage is breaking down as his wife’s own success edges toward the apex of its bell curve. Even the AI housekeeper wired into the walls of his condo berates him for a lack of ambition that has kept him from producing computer art in his free time. Gabe’s rebellious teenage daughter Gina still has the aesthetic temperament her father squanders. She is a Synner, a computechmanipulating hacker adept at withdrawing images from the minds of performers and converting them into virtual reality software for others to experience. Gina’s partner at EyeTraxx is Visual Mark, a youth with a natural genius for alternative rock videos, the VR medium the small company excels at. But EyeTraxx has been acquired by Diversifications Inc., who plan to utilize Visual Mark’s skills to trial and sell implants that can involve the buyer in dreams synthesized from the subsconscious of others. But in the grey area where big business meets the outsider attitudes of these near-future EMO-metal kids, a struggle for freedom in the interface between human minds and corporate networks develops a third corner when mysterious computer viruses enter the fray. Pat Cadigan’s rightful claim to be the first lady of cyberpunk (the term was taken from the title of a story by Bruce Bethke and applied to the fledgling subgenre by editor-author Gardner Dozois) dates back to her 34\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 35\n\nJOHN W.

Although several other female writers have attempted cyberpunk writing with mixed results, Cadigan remains without serious competition, displaying a debt to >> Dick and a willingness to engage with plot complexity that outpaces her male contemporaries too.

The group deduces that the find must be from beyond Earth as one of its occupants managed to crawl out of the machine before it froze to death: a dwarfish being with three red eyes and blue vermiform hair. Excavating the 35\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 36\n\n100 MUST-READ SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS\n\nextraterrestrial from its wintry grave and returning to their camp, the men soon discover that their unique specimen is no longer inert but that it poses a greater threat to the planet than they could have imagined: a colonial creature whose every cell is an independent organism, it can assimilate and mimic any life-form perfectly. The group realize they can no longer trust their friends as any one of them could be a thing. It will take all of their inventiveness, resolve and desire to prove that man is master of the universe and to ensure they survive the onslaught of the invader and stop its progeny infecting the entire world. ‘Who Goes There?’ (1938) is one of five superb stories in this essential collection by the architect of modern genre SF. It has been filmed twice, the later version being more faithful to the original tale. Editor of Astounding from 1937 until his death, Campbell insisted that his writers worked hard at their craft, raising the bar for literary quality, scientific accuracy and disciplined extrapolation, ensuring the plot consequences of their ideas were worked out logically. In the late thirties Campbell discovered >> Asimov, >> Heinlein, >> Sturgeon and >> Van Vogt (among many others) and ushered in the Golden Age of pulp SF. His editorial policy moulded the genre until the early fifties and his influence remains prevalent even today. Barred from writing and selling to other publishers or even contributing stories to his own magazine by its owners, Campbell sacrificed his authorial career to Astounding. His stories are essential reading – exciting and well-executed, they provide vital insights into the approach of the most influential editor in the history of SF. Campbell’s belief in man’s intellect and Übermensch potential has led to some commentators labelling him as right-wing (an influence perhaps most prevalent on Heinlein and Van Vogt) but it would be fairer to say that his optimism and faith in mankind are typical 36\n\n02 100 MR SF\n\n8/8/06\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPage 37\n\nJOHN W.
