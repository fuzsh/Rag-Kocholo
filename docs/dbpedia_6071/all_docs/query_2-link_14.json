        "text": "Antonio \"Zacara\" da Teramo (in Latin Antonius Berardi Andree de Teramo) was an Italian composer, singer, and papal secretary of the late Trecento and early 15th century. He was one of the most active Italian composers around 1400, and his style bridged the periods of the Trecento, ars subtilior, and beginnings of the musical Renaissance."
