        "text": "Guido Reni (1575-1642) was one of the most successful artists of seventeenth-century Italy, with such illustrious patrons as Philip IV, Marie de’ Medici, and Urban VIII vying for his works. Despite his historical significance and the tremendous attention he has received from writers and scholars over the past four centuries, his early career remains surprisingly little examined and largely misunderstood. Reni’s eventual fame has obscured the ordinary struggles of his youth and the distinctive character of his early work completed before his dramatic artistic transformation in Rome. This dissertation will investigate the period before his celebrated success. It presents the most comprehensive account of his early career, as a painter, draftsman and printmaker, from his musical beginnings in Bologna to his efforts to establish himself as a prominent painter in Rome. Part I examines Reni’s education and artistic training in Bologna. Part II investigates his early independence and activities in both Bologna and Rome, between which the artist restlessly traveled in these years. A fresh portrait of Guido emerges through a critical examination of his works from this period; the specific details of commissions—formal qualities, physical contexts, patronage, documentation, and reception—are carefully reviewed. In addition, his relationships with members of the Bolognese and Roman artistic milieus are thoroughly explored, with special attention given to his complex, sustained relationship with the Carracci. The Epilogue considers Reni’s activities after settling in Rome but before entering the service of the papal family—the Borghese—in 1608. The appendix presents a documented chronology of Reni’s early career and includes newly discovered documents and a critical examination of old archival material, both of which considerably alter heretofore chronologies. This study dismantles the tidy, carefree version of Guido’s early career that we have inherited, demonstrating that his pursuit of wealth and glory was far messier and less certain than previously thought. Yet this reappraisal only elevates his standing, for his humble start and the deliberate pace of his artistic development underline, rather than undermine, his extraordinary success.\n\n300 words) This thesis explores Baglione&#39;s contributions to art and to the history of art by examining the nature of his artistic and critical originality and the significant influences thereon. In the work for which he is best known, Le Vite... (1642), Baglione was an interesting and generous critic who was unusually receptive to pictorial effects, even when in architecture and sculpture. He assesses Caravaggio&#39;s accomplishments with well chosen observations thereby breaking his restriction to discuss only accessible works of art. A broad view of his paintings and drawings shows Baglione&#39;s complex, original and thoughtful voyage of discovery assisted by the intelligence with which he absorbed artistic influences, particularly from Raphael and the Cavalier d&#39;Arpino. His refined style of drawing distances him from Caravaggio. In paintings from the first decade, light and shadow give form to graceful figures enveloped in voluminous garments. After 1610 the compositions..."
