HERE is the full programme.\n\nFLOREMUS 2022\n\nThe sixth edition of the international festival FloReMus. Rinascimento Musicale a Firenze, organised by the association L'Homme Armé, will take place in Renaissance venues in the city until Sunday 11 September 2022: it is the first festival entirely dedicated to music from the late 14th to the 16th century set in the cradle of the Renaissance and can boast, unique in Tuscany, the important recognition of being included in the REMA network - Réseau Européen De Musique Ancienne. Once again this year the event is divided into Evening Concerts (9.15 pm). Tuesday 6 September Cappella Pratensis (Netherlands) , a male voice ensemble specialising in the Renaissance repertoire, in Maria zart. A monument of Renaissance sacred music; Thursday 8 September La fonte musica, an ensemble founded and directed by Michele Pasotti, in Enigma Fortuna.

Liturgia immaginaria di fine secolo tra Firenze e Milano; music by H. Isaac and G. Weerbeke.\n\nFEAST OF THE RIFICOLONA\n\nWednesday 7 September sees the return of one of the oldest and most heartfelt festivals in all the districts of Florence, the traditional Festa della Rificolona, which involves the whole city, but mainly the Piazza della Santissima Annunziata. DISCOVER THE PROGRAMME AND ITS HISTORY HERE.\n\nPIANONOVECENTO 2022, THE LAST EVENTS OF THE REVIEW DEDICATED TO 20TH CENTURY PIANO MUSIC\n\nThe fourth edition of PianoNovecento, the musical review conceived and curated by pianist Riccardo Sandiford and dedicated to 20th century piano music, hosted in the cloister of the Museo Novecento, is drawing to a close. The review ends with two appointments, respectively on Wednesday 7 and Thursday 8 September at 9.00 p.m., featuring a programme that can rarely be heard live: Enoch Arden, a melologue by R. Strauss based on a text by Alfred Tennyson, with actor Maurizio Pellegrini and pianist Piero Rotolo; and the programme for the left hand only performed by Giovanni Nesi, who has come to the forefront of international pianism, in particular through his recording for the British Heritage label of important works by Domenico Zipoli.\n\nFIL_HARMONIA, THE FESTIVAL OF MUSIC AND SPIRITUALITY AT THE CERTOSA\n\nUntil 16 September 2022, the Certosa of Florence hosts Fil_Armonia, a festival of music and spirituality, conceived and produced by La Filharmonie, a young orchestra founded in 2016 and the only under-35 music hub in Tuscany, with the artistic direction of Giulio Arnofi and the musical direction of Nima Keshavarzi. Music enters the place of silence: the monumental complex of the Carthusian Monastery, built in the 14th century on the outskirts of the city, was in fact inhabited for centuries by Carthusian monks who made silence their main method of relating to their own individuality, the community and the world.\n\nITALIAN CHEFS CHARITY NIGHT ON THE TERRACES OF FORT BELVEDERE\n\nThe solidarity network of Florentine chefs does not stop. For the sixth year - after the appointments dedicated to the reconstruction of Amatrice, to the fight against feminicide, to support Careggi and the elderly - the traditional charity evening organised on the terrace of Forte Belvedere is back. The appointment is for Wednesday, 7 September from 8.30 p.m. and will involve some of the most renowned Florentine and Tuscan chefs, who have responded with great generosity to the appeal launched by the Italian Chef Charity Night committee to give a sign of continuity with the initiatives of recent years. The evening's programme includes a buffet dinner open to the public, with a minimum donation of €25 donated to the Italian committee of the UN World Food Programme, in favour of the populations affected by the war in Ukraine. Participants will be able to taste signature dishes from 16 important chefs from the Florentine and Tuscan scene, including the owners of several starred restaurants: Riccardo Monco (Enoteca Pinchiorri), Filippo Saporito (La Leggenda dei Frati), Paolo Lavezzini (Il Palagio, Four Seasons Hotel Firenze), Marco Cahssai (Atman at Villa Rospigliosi) and Vincenzo Martella (Linfa, San Gimignano) will be present, together with Vito Mollica (Chic Nonna), Giovanni Cerroni (Mimesi), Ariel Hagen (Saporium), Andrea Perini (Al 588), Lorenzo Romano (Insolita Trattoria), Edoardo Tilli (Podere Belvedere), Salvo Pellegriti (La Vetreria), Luigi Bonadonna (The Stellar), Gabriele Andreoni and Elisa Masoni (L'Oste di Calenzano), Giuseppe Papallo (Architettura del Cibo) and Matteo Donati (Castiglion della Pescaia).\n\nCIRK FANTASTIK\n\nUntil 18 September the 2022 edition of the international contemporary circus festival with a programme full of novelties and previews. El Juego is this year's theme: a tribute to the preciousness and power of play. Many companies from all over the world, comic-acrobatic shows, theatre-box, figure theatre, aerial dance and physical theatre, live music. The essence of the festival is the dissemination of a 'no border' art that is rooted in fertile ground for continuous experimentation.\n\nFIRENZE JAZZ FESTIVAL\n\nFrom 6 to 10 and from 14 to 18 September 2022, the Firenze Jazz Festival returns. After the difficult years of the pandemic, it relaunches with a rich programme with 41 concerts and 13 nationalities represented. A great musical celebration involving the entire city, bringing jazz to the streets, squares and some of the most beautiful locations in the Oltrarno and beyond. A rich array of proposals, ranging from more intimate experiences for connoisseurs to great concerts: jazz in all its many facets with precious forays into electronic music, soul and pop. On 8 September in the Limonaia di Villa Strozzi, one of the most original voices within the new generation of jazz musicians, Taiwan's Yuhan Su.

The magic of Antonello Salis' piano solo recital opens the evening of Friday 9 September at Villa Bardini. On Saturday 10 September, Firenze Jazz Festival starts in the morning in Sala Vanni with Marco Colonna Trio's tribute to Charles Mingus on the centenary of his birth. Firenze Jazz Festival returns on 14 September in Sala Vanni with F2, the duet born from the encounter between drummer Francesca Remigi and clarinettist Federico Calcagno. The evening of Wednesday 14 continues at the Amphitheatre of Villa Strozzi with Rosa Brunello presenting Sounds Like Freedom. On Thursday 15 September, musicteller Federico Sacchi pays homage to the artist Judy Garland with one of his listening experiences, a real live documentary that blends music, theatre, storytelling and video. On Friday 16 September at 7 p.m., the Firenze Jazz Festival presents one of the best line-ups of new Italian jazz, Lilac for People, in the Sala Vanni. On Saturday 17 September the Festival starts again at 10.30 a.m. from the Sala Vanni with a musical encounter characterised by an expressive charge of the highest level, alternating with moments of profound lyrical intensity, in a repertoire that moves between original compositions and jazz standards. Flavio Boltro, the trumpet of reference in Italian and European jazz, paired with Fabio Giachino, one of the most virtuosic young Italian pianists, will perform Things to say.\n\nIl BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA AT THE MAGGIO MUSICALE FIORENTINO\n\nThe opera season of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino will begin on 8 September (replays on 10, 12, 14, 15) in the Zubin Mehta Hall with Il barbiere di Siviglia by Gioachino Rossini, in the highly acclaimed production directed by Damiano Michieletto, revived by Andrea Bernard, with principal conductor Daniele Gatti on the podium.

An enchanting route that combines cities of art and medieval villages surrounded by nature. Departures every weekend from Florence's Santa Maria Novella station with destination Faenza, Brisighella and Ravenna.\n\nL'ALTRO GIACOMO BY AND WITH RENATO RAIMO AT FORTE BELVEDERE AND PALAZZO MEDICI RICCARDI\n\nImmersive, with no barriers between audience and actors, capable of stimulating all the senses in a journey that goes from the visit to the residence to the dinner with the artists.
