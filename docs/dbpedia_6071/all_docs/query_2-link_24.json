Interest conflicts and funding. An author of an article to be considered may be involved in two types of interest conflicts. The first one relates directly to the work authors and the financial and personal relationships that could influence or bias the manuscript in some way. The second type of interest conflict is related to the financial backer of the research.

The existence or absence of interest conflicts must be specified at the end of the article. It must be also specified whether it has received money by way of funding, specifying the origins and codes of calls where they obtained the resources.
