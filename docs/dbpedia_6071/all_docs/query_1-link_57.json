A fascinating period was the Trecento, and, moreover, equally fascinating to the cultured fourteenth and fifteenth century gentleman collector, for many of the compositions were copied and preserved in libraries beyond the Italian border. Thanks to the ever-growing number of philologists, musicologists, and musicologically trained performers, who have dedicated themselves to the Italian Ars Nova, we have been provided with excellent critical editions and fine recordings. But musicological research continues. Much has happened since the pioneering works of Johannes Wolf and Friedrich Ludwig first appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century and opened the vault to the fourteenth-century treasures of Italian music. Since then many papers have been read before national and international musicological congresses; articles have been published on specific practices; translations of fourteenth-century treatises are now available as are studies on Italian notation, composers, and their music; manuscript inventories have appeared in our musicological journals and simplified their identification; and recently, complete collections have been begun by Nino Pirrotta for the American Institute of Musicology and by Leo Schrade and this writer for Editions de l'Oiseau Lyre. T o these various facets such writers as Heinrich Besseler, Leonard Ellinwood, Kurt von Fischer, Federico Ghisi, Annamarie von Konigslow, Susan Le Clercx, Ettore LiGotti, Nino Pirrotta, Gilbert Reaney, Claudio Sartori, Leo Schrade, and myself (to mention but a few) have contributed to the expanding Trecento edifice. In the face of this wealth of informaix\n\nX\n\nForeword\n\nto the First\n\nEdition\n\ntion concerning the music and literature of this period, we are overwhelmed yet delighted when still another publication comes to our attention. H o w to keep the facts straight and in their proper niches has no doubt been asked by many a student and teacher. Fortunately, this situation was foreseen by Viola Hagopian in 1961 when she embarked on the tortuous path and undertook the laborious role by examining the contents of these publications dealing with the Italian Trecento. Each item was duly noted, briefly described, and entered under its proper classification. Once the reader has familiarized himself with the method of classification, he will certainly find this bibliography a trustworthy and useful guide, a time-saving tool, and a welcome addition to Trecento studies. Mrs. Hagopian has indeed rendered a much-needed service to the cause of musicology. W . T h o m a s Marrocco 1964\n\nForeword to the Second Edition\n\n5 W 5\n\nIn eight years, Viola Hagopian's study on Italian Trecento music has reached the coveted status, \"out of print.\" Certainly for the author and the publisher, the publication proved to be a necessary and useful tool; and the University of California Press is to be commended in sensing the need for a second edition. T h e original purpose of this book remains the same: a bibliography of Italian Ars Nova music. Since 1964, new sources have come to light, new studies have been published, and new editions of music have appeared. T h r o u g h the inspired and indefatigable leadership of Professor Kurt von Fischer, the Centro di Studi sull' Ars Nova Italiana del Trecento, in Certaldo, Italy, continues to flourish, thanks to a subvention from the Italian government. T h a t it has become an international center is attested to by the fact that at its last meeting in 1969, scholars from eight countries (including Japan and Poland) presented papers on various aspects of Italian T r e c e n t o music. Some refuted or questioned previously accepted notions; others added new data and strength in support of ideas once thought untenable; fresh and often differing interpretations of the entire subject have been expressed; and a more accurate chronology has been determined. T h e papers have thus filled three volumes—a far cry indeed from the few paragraphs allotted to the Italian Trecento by the Finneys and the Fergusons of the early 1940s. It must appear to the interested student that an exhaustive inquiry of this magnitude would have penetrated every nook and cranny in the intricate web of Trecento musical practice. Yet, despite the heavy concentration of scholarly activity, there still remain a few crevices that refuse to admit a shaft of light. I am thinking of that bête noire, musica ficta, the role of instruments in the performance of the music, the manner of singing with or without embellishments, the meaning of ligatures in xi\n\nxii\n\nForeword\n\nto the Second\n\nEdition\n\na textless tenor part, the large number of compositions still classified as anonymous, and finally, biographical data of many composers whose activities beyond those of their métier are completely unknown to us. A l t h o u g h the last chapter has yet to be written, the chase after these elusive problems continues. W . T h o m a s M arrocco 1972\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\nT o those familiar with research techniques it is a well-known fact that bibliographies by their very nature are subject to obsolescence, or at best to near obsolescence. This is particularly applicable to the bibliography of the Italian Ars Nova, since this field of music has been the beneficiary of some seventy years of scholarly activity, an activity that continues to gather momentum. T h e most important single factor contributing to this accelerated momentum has been the establishment in 1959 of the Centro di Studi sull'Ars Nova Italiana del Trecento, located at Certaldo. In the auspicious first ten years of its life the center has yielded a bonanza of information, yet this is not to say that scholars have not continued to work independently as well. T h e results of these combined efforts have prompted an updating of this bibliography. In order to enhance the usefulness of this second edition, the majority of entries have been given a capsule description. V. L. H. Spring 1972\n\nAcknowledgments (TWi\n\nI recall with gratitude the first of a number of visits to Professor Federico Ghisi in Florence when, in 1962, he kindly read the manuscript of the first edition of this guide and shared generously with me his vast fund of knowledge. It was he who made me acquainted with Certaldo, at the same time recommending that I substitute \"Ars Nova\" for \"Trecento\" in the title. When early in 1967 I began to think seriously of a revised and enlarged second edition of this work, my proposal met with the wholehearted enthusiasm of Dr. W. Thomas Marrocco of the University of California at Los Angeles and of Dr. Vincent H. Duckies, music librarian at the University of California at Berkeley. During the intervening years I incurred a debt to them both, for the latter was always ready with advice concerning the organization of the bibliography, and Professor Marrocco made numerous helpful and generous contributions to my own efforts. He also read the final manuscript in detail with me. In addition, I am grateful to Mrs. Grete Frug£ of the School of Librarianship of the University of California, who made several useful editorial suggestions regarding certain portions of the text. In the summer of 1971 it was my good fortune to have a meeting with the indefatigable Kurt von Fischer, and in the months that followed I was the fortunate beneficiary of his profound scholarship. Shortly before this manuscript was delivered to the press, a chance correspondence with F. Alberto Gallo proved fortuitous, for he too made a number of voluntary contributions. These, together with several others, for the most part forthcoming publications, will be found in the Postscript. Finally, I wish to thank all of the librarians of the great Music Library of the University of California at Berkeley for their sustained help and cooperation. V. L. H. Spring 1972\n\nIntroduction\n\nSCOPE T h e Trecento of Dante, Giotto, Petrarch, and Boccaccio is also distinguished for its musical contribution, namely the awakening and unparalleled flowering of secular vocal music. It was during this period that the love affair between poetry and music, which had its inception with the trovatori and laudesi, came to full fruition. N o one has put it more aptly than N i n o Pirrotta in referring to \" T h e spring flowers of the Ars Nova.\" 1 Indeed, these \"flowers\" represent a yield of some six hundred compositions on popular (volgare) texts. It is the purpose of this bibliographic guide to bring to light, as nearly as possible, the entire output of this musical activity that has become available in modern editions and, in addition, to provide a guide to the literature pertaining to these works, to the manuscripts, and to the composers. Transcribed fragments and fragments of sources in facsimile are excluded. Also excluded are dance forms (istampite, saltarelli, trotti). It is obvious that a thorough study of Italian Ars Nova music cannot be undertaken without a consideration of both the rich literary background and the theoretical treatises. But because this guide purports to be an in-depth study neither of poetry nor of theory, only major works pertaining to these two areas are cited. Italian music for our purposes will mean works in the Italian style; this must of necessity include a number of contributions by composers who, like Ciconia and Dufay, though not Italian by birth or heritage, spent a great part of their lives in Italy, thus coming under the Italian influence. It will also apply to works by composers of doubtful origin, such as Egidio, when the style is Italian. O n the other hand, works that do not fit this description are excluded, even when composed by Italians, as in the cases of Bartolomeo Brollo, Antonello and Filippo da Caserta, and i. Pirrotta 25, 57.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nMatteo da Perugia. Over half a century of papal residence at Avignon (1309-1376) had brought about a close political relationship between France and Italy, with a resultant infiltration of the French style and language into Italy. T h i s is nowhere better exemplified that in the works of Matteo da Perugia and of the two Casertas, which display the characteristics of the French mannerists found at Avignon. Yet the notation is typically fourteenth-century Italian, that is, individual signs are employed for special note values. In some instances, pieces in the Italian style were composed on French texts, 2 while chansons in the French style made use of Italian words. 3 In still other cases, we find a mixture of Italian and Latin, or of Italian and French texts, as in some of the works of H u g o de Lantins and Zachara da T e r a m o . It will be observed throughout the following pages that the terms \" T r e c e n t o \" and \"Italian Ars N o v a \" occur interchangeably. A l t h o u g h the shades of difference between these expressions must be left to the text, it must here be pointed out that there is some disagreement among scholars in this area. Kurt von Fischer scrupulously avoids the use of the more recent connotation \"Italian Ars Nova,\" yet Federico Ghisi prefers it. Professor Fano (Fano 4) defends its application to an entire century of polyphonic activity, which does not coincide literally with the span of the fourteenth century, or Trecento, but extends rather from about 1325 to 1425. W e know that the French and Italian Ars N o v a shared in common a fresh polyphony, together with a heretofore unknown rapport with the poetry that inspired it. T h e Italian, while lacking the Gothic style of the French, displayed a far greater capacity for lyricism, and this lyricism was to remain one of its distinguishing characteristics. O n the basis of stylistic analysis, the period under consideration may be divided into three generations. T h e first consists chiefly of Piero, Giovanni da Cascia (also known as Johannes de Florentia), Jacopo da Bologna, and Vincenzo da Rimini. More difficult to define is the second generation, for many composers in this period are borderline cases. Most certainly to this group belong Gherardello, Donato and Lorenzo da Firenze, and Nicolò da Perugia. O n the border of this generation and the third one we find Andrea dei Servi, Bartolino da Padova, Paolo Tenorista, and that most prolific of all Ars N o v a composers, Francesco Landini (also known as \"Il Cieco\"). T h e s e composers, particularly Paolo, tend to lean toward the last group. T o this third generation, often referred to as the \"late Ars N o v a \" group, belong unequivocally Antonello da Caserta, Bartolomeo Brollo, Bartolomeo da Bononia, Johannes Ciconia, Guil2. Landini's \" A d i u . . .\" (Fischer 32, 38); the anonymous \"Quant je voy\" (Fischer 3. Dufay's \"Quel fronte . . . ; \"Dona 1 ardenti rari.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nlaume Dufay, Matteo da Perugia, Zachara da Teranio and Zacherias, CDNP. Before 1900 this vast treasure mine had remained virtually undiscovered, 4 but at the turn of the century the pioneer studies of Friedrich L u d w i g and Johannes Wolf paved the way for the extensive researches that were to follow. It was Wolf's study of mensural notation in 1904 (Geschichte der Mensuralnotation . . .) that provided the key to the great body of Trecento music. In 1905 Riemann, too, made his contribution, and Heinrich Besseler commenced his studies in the 1920s. Conspicuous among later scholars are the names of Ellinwood, Fischer, Ghisi, Marrocco, Pirrotta, Reaney, and Schrade, w h o have brought to light a wealth of new material, and w h o have not been content with merely transcribing the contents of the manuscripts into modern notation. T h e y have also written extensively on every aspect of this music, and there is little indication of waning interest. Indeed, to the roster of distinguished names may now be added those of Frank D'Accone, F. Alberto Gallo, Ursula Giinther, Marie Martinez-Gollner, Nigel Wilkins, and others. In 1958 K u r t von Fischer (Fischer 33) surveyed the achievements of over half a century of research, commenting on the momentum this scholarly activity had gathered. T h e brief interval between his survey and the appearance of the first edition of the present bibliography saw the publication of the Ars N o v a papers at the Colloques de W i g i m o n t , the establishment of the Centro di Studi sull'Ars Nova Italiana del Trecento at Certaldo, a continuation of the manuscript studies in Musica Discipline a second edition of W . T h o m a s Marrocco's Fourteenth-Century Italian Cacce, Leo Schrade's edition of the works of Francesco Landini, and three additional volumes of N i n o Pirrotta's distinguished collections, The Music of Fourteenth-Century Italy. Between the years 1963 and 1971 there has appeared a fifth volume to the Pirrotta set, while Dr. Marrocco, in undertaking the completion of the l'Oiseau-Lyre Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century (Italian Secular Music), has already published volume 6 of the set, with volume 7 and 8 due in 1972. In informing me that the preparation of the remaining three volumes has beeen completed, Professor Marrocco very kindly made available to me the tables of contents of these three volumes, thus enabling me to account for numerous additional transcriptions. In preparing this bibliographic guide the writings of the above-named 4. Although as early as 1776 Charles Burney (General History of Music, 1 [and ed. 1935], 625-646) had displayed a keen awareness of it, and Fitis made more than passing comments in 1835 (Fit /) and again in 1876 (Fit 5, 305-315). Somewhat later there followed brief articles: Gandolfi, in Rassegna nazionale, 1888; Gandolfi and Wolf in Nuova musica between the years 1896-1899. Nor to be overlooked are Gandolfi's comments accompanying his facsimile edition of Florentine music in 189s (Gandolfi 2).\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nscholars have been consulted extensively; and Gustave Reese's Music in the Middle Ages, together w i t h Fischer's Studien zur italienischen Musik . . . h a v e served as principal starting points for the study. T h e latter provided a b i b l i o g r a p h i c a l guide, and those familiar w i t h the work will n o w recognize the need for amplification. T h e present u n d e r t a k i n g provides a composer approach, whereas Fischer's approach, though i n c l u d i n g a composer i n d e x a n d tabulation by composer, is essentially an approach through text i n c i p i t — n o t w i t h o u t logic, since the composer e n j o y e d little importance d u r i n g the A r s N o v a period. B u t in the f o l l o w i n g centuries, the role of the composer assumed a n e w importance, and his ever-increasing importance has been accompanied by an increased need for composer guides. In view of the abundance of literature pertaining to the musical activity of this period, an extensive bibliography is also pertinent. It is h o p e d that this guide will prove useful to p e r f o r m i n g musicians and to musicologists alike, by p r o v i d i n g ready information on w h a t is available in terms of music and related literature. It can n o w be said that w i t h i n a very short time the transcriptions of this vast body of T r e c e n t o music w i l l have been virtually completed, w i t h the possible exception of a h a n d f u l of illegible fragments. 5 In addition, m a n y problems relating to identity a n d attribution have n o w been solved. Y e t it is quite possible that scholars w i l l uncover still more of these fourteen th-century treasures, h i d d e n away in some obscure, out-of-the-way manuscripts; for Sacchetti lists other works by composers whose names are already familiar, as well as a n u m b e r by Jacopo and G i o v a n n i de Gherardello, O t t o l i n o da Brescia, a n d even one by himself. 6 A n d L i G o t t i makes m e n t i o n of an A l b e r t u c c i o della V i n o t a and of one Scochetto. 7\n\nARRANGEMENT\n\nAND\n\nMETHOD\n\nT h e History a n d Criticism section (pp. 13-74) is divided into ten classified parts. A l l areas are so closely linked that they often overlap. T h i s is particularly applicable to stylistic analysis, which, because it is diffused throughout the numerous entries, has not been assigned a specific section heading. A very small n u m b e r of works cited have not been examined, and these 5. A l t h o u g h this bibliographic guide does not cover sacred works of the period, it is nevertheless fitting to call attention to the announcement of yet another volume in the l'Oiseau-Lyre series ( P M F ) .

A t the same time, in the interests of selectivity and conciseness, some of the material that was examined has been rejected. A l l material used is listed alphabetically in A p p e n d i x I (page 111). Complete entries are given for each item the first time it is used in the body of the work. Thereafter, it will be referred to by the number assigned to it in A p p e n d i x I. For example, Fischer 6 will always denote his \"Les compositions a trois voix. . . .\" Similarly, Pirrotta 26:1 will denote his The Music of Fourteenth Century Italy, Vol. I. Symbols have been devised for periodicals, series, and for reference works most frequently used, such as MGG. Whenever possible, use has been made of the symbols employed by Reese in the bibliography of Music in the Renaissance. W h e r e no biographical information is indicated, it is to be assumed that the following standard reference works were consulted: Baker, Eitner, F^tis, Grove, MGG, Riemann, and Schmidl. T h e reader is advised to consult bibliographies of all MGG articles cited. T h e variant forms of composers' names can often prove troublesome. I have preferred the Italian form whenever possible, excepting in the case of those theorists w h o are generally known by the Latinized form of their names. Provision has been made for the variants in both the composer listings and in the index. In cases where there is a complete edition of a composer's works or where a substantial number of compositions is found in a single collection, it is listed first.

This study scarcely represents a departure from the author's earlier view (Besseler 11, 13), and the Trecento is included almost reluctantly under the heading Ars Nova. T h e Tonwortkunst is held as the essence of Trecento music, while conceding that often poet and singer were not the same. There was no representative large form resembling the isorhythmic motet; in fact, Italian composers resisted this form. Yet an acquaintance with French works of this period is revealed in their use of the hocket, particularly in accompanying instrumental parts. T h e caccia and canonic madrigal are derived from the French chace, while the ballata, reaching its highest point of development with Landini, had its roots in the thirteenth-century lauda. 13\n\n14\n\nHistory and\n\nCriticism\n\nT h e madrigal was to remain a soloistic Gesangmusik. In principle it resembles Provençal organum, but now with a free melismatic upper voice over a quiet tenor. Italian coloratura virtuosity is evident in the works of Giovanni and Jacopo, and this Singfreudigkeit reaches a high point in the works of the Florentines Gherardello and Lorenzo. . Die Musik des Mittelalters und der Renaissance. Potsdam, Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft Athenaion, 1931. Although the following critical annotations cover only pp. 151-166, \"Italien und der Mittelkreis im Gotischen Zeitalter,\" it is strongly recommended that the student begin reading from p. 112 in order to have the background essential to an understanding of what follows. In spite of the thesis advanced by some scholars, Italy's surrender and almost total renunciation of the achitectural grandeur of the northern motet makes it impossible to consider the Trecento as the herald of a new epoch in music history. Activity in Italy is no more than a tributary and does not alter the course of the Gothic mainstream. Nor is the precedence of the ephemeral madrigal over the French ballade in the least demonstrable. Italy became active relatively late in music history, and therefore there is little to assess of its role until the thirteenth century, when the lauda assumed importance. This lauda, particularly that of Francesco d'Assisi and his followers, became the most potent factor leading to the Trecentokunst. T h i s is not to say that there were not other contributing factors, such as the Provençal troubadour art of the north Italian courts and the dolce stil nuovo. T h e oldest form of Italian secular polyphony, the two-voiced madrigal, is derived from Provençal organum and is comparable to the French ballade. Here is a new base for polyphonic music. In contrast to the Gothic effort to maintain individuality of voices, the Trecentokunst reveals a \"oneness of polyphonic tonal capacity,\" as demonstrated in the coloratura upper voice; and the tenor is a true bass in the harmonic sense. T h e addition of thirds and sixths to this two-part madrigal leads in time to the threepart madrigal. In contrast to the pathos of the troubadours and the chivalric ideals of the preceding period, here the social milieu is one of courtly elegance, as exemplified in Boccaccio's Decamerone. Perhaps this Luxuskunst, or \"jeunesse dorée,\" explains the inner weakness of the Italian Trecentokunst. Even Landini's leadership was marked by a stylistic weakness, being no more than a luxury product of the nobility, and as a result it could not maintain itself against the stronger north. . \"Studien zur Musik des Mittelalters: Neue Quellen des 14. und beginnenden 15. Jahrhunderts.\" AfMW VII (1925), 167-252. Again the importance of French influence is stressed, and contributing factors are enumerated: French epics, which were known and had been translated (two Tuscan translations of the Roman de la rose); art of the Provençal troubadours; influence of French language and literature, as well as of architecture and sculpture; motet of Notre Dame not unknown in Italy. .\"Studien. . . .\" AfMW VIII (1926), 137-258. This discredits Riemann's hypothesis regarding the date of the\n\nPomerium,\n\nArs Nova Period in General (/)\n\n15\n\nfor it is felt that it must be later. It is also felt that the madrigal emerges from the conductus as a pure Italian form and not from accompanied monody, as Riemann would have it.

In the abstract, \"Ars Nova\" could be applied to any manifestation of the new, from the organum of Notre Dame to twentieth-century musique concrète. T h e new is always linked to a certain decadence, which sets in when the old reaches an impasse. As related to the subject in question, the term \"Ars Nova\" can be used to convey the idea of fourteenth-century polyphony in a broad sense. How can its sudden appearance in Italy be explained in the absence of a previous background? Avignon, the perfect meeting ground between French and Italian, seems the obvious answer, though there still remain some unresolved questions. . \"Considérations générales sur la conjonction de la polyphonie italienne et de la polyphonie du nord pendant la première moitié du XV\" siècle.\" Institut historique belge de Rome, Bull.

In the former, this was sober and calculated, while in the latter, music prevailed over words. Indeed, in Italy there was a musical exuberance.

B y way of an introduction to the Wégimont conference, the chairman recognizes the phenomenon of the Ars N o v a as one of those moments in the history of art and human thought when the new appears suddenly, as a sort of mutation. T h i s eloquent spokesman and champion of the French Ars N o v a concedes that Italy too played a role; for in the melting pot of Avignon, Italy had been exposed to French influence, yet it remained true to its own tradition, a tradition marked by roots deep in classical antiquity and in the old Mediterranean world.\n\n*\n\n.

B u t f o r our purposes the unique value of this work lies even more in the fact that it furnishes so complete a picture of prevailing musical conditions in the neighboring areas of Liège and Avignon, and thus sets in bold relief the vital role Avignon played in shaping the music of the late Italian Ars Nova, where we find a mélange of the Italian and French styles. . \"Propos sur l'Ars N o v a . \" RB X (1956), 1 5 4 - 1 6 0 .

T o the credit of the Church, the religious songs (laude) have been preserved, enabling one to study their structure and thus to perceive the metric and spiritual relationships between words and music. On the other hand, since the layman paid little attention to secular monodie song, documentation regarding the monodie ballata remains scanty. This is largely true also of the troubadour songs, and as a consequence there is little proof of a suspected accompaniment on harp or viols. T h e spirit of the Italian Renaissance already makes itself felt in the pulsating humanism of the Trecento, and myriad poets contribute to Italy's superiority over France. Dante's dolce stil nuovo is equated with the Florentine Ars Nova, and both poetic and musical aspects of madrigal, caccia, and polyphonic ballata are discussed. and G. Pannain. Storia della musica.

This is a comprehensive résumé of the activity of a century in which \"a completely independent polyphonic art developed in Italy,\" and deals with every aspect of this art: social background, extent of musical culture, music in contemporary literature, influence of the poets, manuscript sources, notation, forms (including etymology of the term \"madrigal\"), composers, thirteenth-century influence of the laudi spirituali and of the early Italian trovatori who used the language and verse forms of Provence. It is stressed that above all the principal source of the new Italian style is found in the repertory of the conductus. Arguments are supported by numerous musical examples. . \"Francesco Landini and His Music.\" MQ_, X X I I (1936), 190-216. This biographical sketch of Landini, with an exposition of his compositional tedinique, stresses the importance of troubadour art in Italy, which began with the crusades, when the Albigensian Crusade scattered troubadours from Provence.

A t the time this paper was read there was \"only a handful of representative compositions . . . published in facsimile or in transcription.\" T h e thesis is that the madrigal is derived from the conductus, but that there was no transition through the motet.

The new music of Florence and of northern Italy displayed no link with the Gothic northern stream, for here the influence of Giotto and his followers can be felt. With the advent of secular music, individuality plays a major role, and the fetters of the northern motet school are absent. Melody is supreme, and melismas coming out of the East allow for a new melodic freedom. It is wrong to dismiss these as instrumental mannerism. Now there is a new concept of melody, and a union of melody, rhythm, and harmony. . \"The Transition on the Continent.\" NOH (i960), 134-164. Fischer, Kurt von. \"Ars Nova.\" EM I (1963), 123-124.

In challenging the varying theories of Ellinwood, Besseler, Pirrotta, and other scholars regarding the derivation of the madrigal, the hypothesis is advanced that the madrigal's structure seems to depend on an older instrumentally accompanied monody. In the course of its development Trecento polyphony was influenced by the French style, even though the Italian elements remained active. There follows an investigation into the structure of two- and three-part Trecento compositions in relation to those of the French Ars Nova, and observations are supported with musical examples. . \"Quelques remarques sur les relations entre les laudesi et les compositeurs florentins du Trecento.\" Cert III (1970), 247-252.

T h e problem is approached with respect to chronology and style, the two elements that dictate terminology; and the varying interpretations of scholars working in this area have been assembled in concise yet thorough form. The question is not when the Ars Nova begins but rather when it ends, and the argument here presented is that the emergence of the ars subtilior spells the demise of the Ars Nova. In the latter part of the fourteenth century there is a reciprocal influence between France and Italy, and a new style emerges that is characterized by a wider and more complex variety of rhythms and notation. T h e question is raised regarding the validity of the expression \"late Ars Nova,\" a term that has enjoyed wide usage in denoting the musical activity of this period. T w o alternative terms are considered. Apel / calls the notation \"mannered notation\" and writes of the \"manneristic period.\" T h e varying 12.

A n analysis of Guido's ballade, \" O r voit tout en aventure,\" appropriately sheds new light on the end of the Ars N o v a epoch, and lends some validity to the term \"mannerism,\" for in the text, doubtless also written by the composer, 1 3 we find \" N o s faysoms contre nature. . . .\" Ars subtilior is looked on with favor, for it is pointed out that subtilior is the comparative of subtilis or subtilitas. T h e former was used early in the century by Jacobus de Liège and somewhat later by other theorists. Pirrotta 75 speaks of \"subtilitas\" in referring to the polyphonic practice of the early fourteenth century. W h e n did the change from Ars N o v a or ars subtilis to ars subtilior take place? A t the onset of the more complicated style, i.e., 1370-1377, according to various scholars. T h e r e is an unquestioned parallel between the schism (1378-1417) and this new direction. By the 1380s the new style was widely disseminated, although L a n d i n i remained relatively untouched by it. Nowhere is this ars subtilior better exemplified than in the works of Matteo da Perugia, but it extends even as far as Dufay. . \" D i e Mensuralnotation der Ars Nova in T h e o r i e und Praxis.\" X I X - X X : 1 (1962-63), 9-28.\n\nAfMW\n\nT h e objective is to demonstrate the practice of mensural notation by means of the compositions themselves, since they are more reliable and convincing than theoretical treatises. T h e positions taken by Borren and W o l f that Italy must have introduced the binaria into France are held as untenable; and it is agreed with Besseler, Handschin, and Reaney that in France there h a d been evidence of d u p l e rhythms even before the fourteenth century. T h e former theory is discredited by means of examples demonstrating that the superiority of the French system led to a more rapid development of the new complicated rhythms, and the conclusion is that the Italian influence is negligible, if not entirely nonexistent. T h e r e is a listing of the most important factors in this investigation which lead to the above stated conclusion.

T h e practice of writing a free melisma in one voice, unknown to the French, proves shocking to contemporaries, yet carries with it an indebtedness to Italy for introducing the coloratura element into vocal music. Landini, taking his texts from the treasures of Italian poetry, is to Italy what Machaut is to France.

A n examination of the theoretical treatises now at our disposal, together with the earliest two-voiced madrigals of Rs, reveals no evidence of a preexisting tenor and leads to the conclusion that, unlike French works of this period, Trecento polyphony had its origins in the Italian monodic tradition. 1 4 Yet in view of the spotty musical tradition in Italy before 1300, it is felt that this singular type of musical composition cannot stand as an isolated phenomenon, and that a connection with France is not to be dismissed. 15 T h e nature and development of madrigal, caccia and ballata are discussed, together with the divergent opinions of scholars regarding them.

A historian views the Ars Nova in the sociopolitical perspective of the fourteenth century, which he sees as one of the great centuries in a long and changing period. With reference to France and Italy, it is closely linked with the search to free oneself from the shackles of the preceding century. T h e many aspects of the economic revolution are cited as part of the social reform, or \"style nouveau,\" which manifested itself also in art and music. As a result, despite the opposition of the Church, the via moderna, in replacing the via antiqua, becomes more than a musical style.

Comprehensive coverage is compressed into these few pages. A summation of the continuing polemic surrounding terminology concludes that the term Ars Nova should not be restricted to its original Latin connotation, but that it is more applicable to an artistic conception. There follow considerations of the treatises of Petrus de Cruce, Johannes de Mûris, Vitry, Marchettus, and Jacobus de Liège and a reemphasis of the meteoric rise of Italy. Before and immediately following this Italian Ars Nova period die predominantly monodic forms presented little need for a complicated notation. Relative to the early years of the Trecento, neither in Antonio da Tempo's treatise (Delle rime volgari, 1332) nor in Rs is there any distinction in the poetic forms between those destined for monodic versus polyphonic treatment. Page 195 deals with some specifics of the later period, such as Florence in particular, Landini and the polyphonic ballata, and mannerism, that tendency toward artificiality which manifested itself at the end of the century. See also bibliography. *\n\n. \"Ars Nova e stil novo.\" RIM I:i (1966), 3-19. T h e Italian version of a paper read at the Dante Symposium at Johns Hopkins, 1965, in which Dr. Pirrotta, having first posed the question whether there is justification for introducing the Ars Nova into a Dante celebration, now considers the possibility of a connection and states his reasons for so doing, namely, that this meteoric outburst of polyphonic activity took place in a century that had been inaugurated by Dante and Giotto and that was resolved by the voices of Petrarch and Boccaccio. T h e characteristics of the stil novo abound in the Ars Nova output; and Riemann, in referring to Florence as the cradle of the Ars Nova, evidently relates it to the dolce stil novo. Yet the years immediately preceding 1330 seemed unimportant to Riemann. T h e fact is that all references to music of that period were made not to polyphonic activity, but rather to the various genres of the unwritten, from the troubadour type of street song to the dance music and to the religious lauda. In this latter case the music\n\n28\n\nHistory\n\nand\n\nCriticism\n\nremained religious but was now used for secular texts. T h e ballata in its earliest monodic form is the principal vehicle of the musical expression of the stil novo and by the same token is the oldest. Only later does it become polyphonic (ca. 1370), when it is written with such enthusiasm that madrigal and caccia fall into disuse. Most of the manuscripts from Florence correspond in time and place with the current ideas of Dante's \"poesia volgare,\" and there is a link between the creative impulse of the stil novo and the increased polyphonic activity of the Ars Nova. In at least one case the dependence of medieval culture on France is broken, thanks to Dante. T h e merit of the Italian Ars Nova is found in its own unique style of refined equilibrium and freshness of expression. In stressing the separation between written and unwritten music, the author points out with Torrefranca that the unlocked \"secret\" of the mid-Quattrocento, somewhat paralleling that of the pre-Ars Nova period, may be ascribed to a reverting reliance on the unwritten. . \"Cronologia e denominazione dell'Ars Nova italiana.\" WSg (1959), 9 3 109.

Dulcedo and subtilitas were in reality opposite poles. T h e latter offered the widest range of possibilities, and the theories on which fourteenth-century music was based were superseded by a myriad of new writing, of which the Modena Codex in particular is an example. T h e introduction of French stylistic and technical elements into Italian polyphony at the turn of the century has all the characteristics of yet another phenomenon, that of a change in musical taste. . \"Italien.

This is an aesthetic approach to the entire question, and the spirit of the cultural world in Italy is contrasted with that of France.

Some consideration is given to the structure of the madrigal and of the canonic madrigal, which closely resembles the caccia. . \"Marchettus de Padua and the Italian Ars Nova.\" MD I X (1955), 5i-7iAn investigation of the conditions surrounding the birth of the Italian Ars\n\nArs Nova Period in General (I)\n\n29\n\nNova, relating the Lucidarium and the Pomerium to them.

With musical supplement. T w o scholars, one literary, the other musical, approach this subject from their respective points of view: \"Tecnica poetica,\" by LiGotti; \"Pratica e tecnica musicale,\" by Pirrotta. T h e latter section deals principally with the relationship between music and poetry. This relationship can be reduced to three fundamental patterns: music and poetry, being of equal importance, are adapted one to the other; music is subservient to poetry; poetry bows to music. U p to the end of the Duecento and the beginning of the Trecento (through the Dante period), patterns one and two prevail exclusively. T h e same music is sometimes even used for both sacred and secular texts, as with the laude (and monodic ballate). In the Trecento, pattern three appears, and we have \"poesia per musica.\" With this there is a refinement of rhythms through mensural notation, and the development of a contrapuntal technic brings with it new possibilities. As new demands are made on singers, the \"cantori specializzati\" appear on the scene. T h e three forms—madrigal, caccia, and polyphonic ballata—are discussed, as well as the etymology of the word \"madrigal.\" See p. 50 for the monodic ballata. Footnotes serve as a bibliography and also abound in information that is as pertinent as that contained in the body of the text. For example, p. 62 n. 3: \" T h e affirmation that the Italian Ars Nova is exclusively secular . . . appears too uncompromising. . . .\" T h e motets Lux purpurata and Gratiosus magnanissimus are cited as examples.

Pages 291-308 deal specifically with Italy; nevertheless, the significance of this movement cannot be thoroughly grasped without a careful perusal of the preceding thirty pages, which provide a concise survey of the historical and cultural background. Here again is a consideration of the label \" A r s N o v a , \" a label that is stylistic in its connotation. Italy is compared with France. Whereas the Gothic style of the latter soars, the former is more earthbound. In France there were the continued chivalric romans; in Italy, such masterpieces as Dante's Commedia and Boccaccio's Decamerone. Vitry's Ars Nova is considered vis a vis Marchettus' Pomerium, and the importance of Petrus de Cruce is underscored. Italian notation is more adaptable to the coloratura style of the Italian, as opposed to the more frequent use of the liocket in the French. T h e r e follows a study of the forms and of some important composers. L a t e in the fourteenth century the Italian style incorporates some French features, though the use of French texts is relatively rare. . \" T h e M i d d l e Ages.\" In A History\n\nof Song, ed. by Denis Stevens, ad ed.\n\nN e w York, Norton, 1970, 37-62.

C h a p t e r 13 begins with a recognition of the nonliturgical monody of the Duecento lauda, and the u n i q u e contributions of Italy are enumerated, namely, that she produced a body of fresh polyphony in which the melisma played an important role; that whereas the main melody of the conductus h a d usually been in the lower voice, it is now shifted to the top. Italy now becomes divorced from the cantus firmus, and there is an early \"feeling for tonality.\" T r e c e n t o composers are listed by generation, following Ellinwood's arrangement.

Dr. Riemann's outlook on the Ars Nova period is more unique than that of his colleagues, for he prefers to look on this activity as a new art song brought about by a change of mood, rather than as a set of technical and mechanical innovations, obviously made possible by the new notation. T o support his thesis he cites examples from the \"tone painters\" Paolo and Piero. His emphasis is more on actual practice than on theory. Here again the case is stated for instrumental accompaniment and for the instrumental execution of the opening and ending melismas, citing a reference to this in the Decamerone. A tenable hypothesis is advanced that perhaps in the end the custom of accompanying songs on the lute had passed from Spain to Italy. Sachs, Kurt.

T h e former did not experience a change in the musical concept, and the Gothic was more concerned with \"musical engineering\" than with musical imagination. In Italy, on the contrary, the climate was more revolutionary. Here was a new world of poets and color. In her preference for time signatures she also differed from her northern neighbor, for she favored the use of imperfection, or the binary, to an extent not found in France. Schering, Arnold. \" 'Ars antiqua' e 'ars nova.' \" CorteA (1945), 42-46. In contrasting the Ars Antiqua with the Ars Nova, a study of the music itself is favored over a study of the theory. T h e Speculum, then thought to be by Johannes de Mûris but now known to be by Jacobus de Liège, is considered the most revealing of the then contemporary theoretical writings. T h e author of this treatise revolted against the \"modern rude . . . and ignorant \"cantores' \" (here canlores means anyone who makes music) who held in contempt the old, which they thought had neither the subtilitas nor the complicated structure of the new. Important role of the organ is stressed. *\n\n. Sludien zur Musikgeschichte der Fruhrenaissance. Leipzig, C. F. Kant Nachfolger, 1914. In the introduction and early pages of this masterly study 1 8 it is emphasized that the new cannot be divorced from what came before, and that one must give the Ars Antiqua its due investigation. It is for this reason that the reader is advised to study at least the first 1 2 3 pages of this work. T h e bridge between the old and the new is not to be found in speculative theory, but in the living practice of the art, and a plea is made for placing periods in their proper perspective. Unlike Riemann, who 18. Restricted though the resources were.\n\n32\n\nHistory\n\nand\n\nCriticism\n\nfeels that the Ars Nova came into being in 1334-1342, this author believes that it was already coming to life two decades earlier, with the dying Ars Antiqua, and that it was the triumph of the new instrumentally accompanied song that actually ushered in the new. With this came the resistance of the Church. In citing a parallel between Paumann's organ arrangement of \"Des klaffers neyden\" and Giovanni's \"Nascoso il viso,\" the question is posed whether these resemblances may not indeed go deeper, particularly since Giovanni himself was an organist (pp. 16-17). W e are reminded that the greater part of Paumann's compositions are arrangements of folk melodies. In this connection much consideration is given to the positive and the portative organs of Landini's time and to him and his image as an organist. Schering's thesis in all of his writings remains the same, namely that these melodies were not only accompanied by the organ, but that they were often played in entirety by it and other instruments, such as the lute and viola (as illustrated in Gandolfi 2). Schneider, Marius. Die Ars Nova des XIV Jahrhunderts in Frankreich und Italien. Wolfenbiittel-Berlin, Kallmeyer, 1930. More emphasis and space devoted to French, but with some comparisons between French and Italian. . \"Das gestalttypologische Verfahren in der Melodik des Francesco Landino.\" Acta X X X V (1963), 2 - 1 4 . An analysis of three compositions of Landini demonstrates his use of the eastern Gestalt technique and the connection between the Italian Ars Nova and Incid-Mediterranean music making. Could not this perhaps account for the melismas that abound in Italian Ars Nova compositions? . \"Klagelieder des Volkes in der Kunstmusik der italienischen Ars Nova.\" Acta X X X I I I (1961), 162-168. T h e character of the Sicilian and Corsican folk lament is displayed in examples from Landini and Andrea (as particularly related to the Mediterranean melisma), with the conclusion that a closer examination of the Italian compositions of this period reveals in reality many more of the older elements than would appear on the surface. It is because the technique of the Ars Nova is to a large extent controlled by structural laws that these older elements are not readily detected, and a strong plea is made for further research into this area.

Italian Trecento music lends itself to a more easy and natural understanding than the French, which is rationalistically organized and tends to be contrived. Regarding the studies of Ludwig and Wolf, the former inclines more toward the roots of the music and its interpretation, whereas the latter is more interested in the theory.\n\nArs Nova Period\n\nin General (7)\n\n33\n\nSeay, Albert.

Bibliography is very brief. Smith, F. Joseph. \"Ars Nova—a Redefinition?\" MD X V I I I (1964), 19-35; X I X (»965). 83-97. This article represents a unique stance in the ever-present Ars Nova polemic. Likening this term to that of the twentieth-century Neue Musik, it is asked whether this too is not a mere slogan imposed by historiographers. T h e Ars Nova, in planting the seed that disrupted the rationality of the Middle Ages, dealt a death blow to the medieval age of reason. It therefore follows that in order to redefine Ars Nova we must again study the rational background of the medieval theory of the Ars Antiqua, with its mathematical concepts of sound, number, and proportion. Particularly important is the concept of number, for consonance is represented by the sacred number three and is disrupted by the new dissonance. Jacobus de Liège remains the champion of the rational consonance in medieval music theory; and a reediting and réévaluation of the Speculum is recommended, for this treatise is considered to be the key to understanding the true significance of this historic upheaval. For this réévaluation (1966), see the section on theory (VII), p. 73, below. Strunk, Oliver. \"Intorno a Marchetto da Padova.\" RaM X X (1950), 3 1 2 - 3 1 5 . Marchettus is the principal spokesman of the Trecento through his Lucidarium (plainsong) and Pomerium (mensural notation). In setting out to establish the date of the Pomerium vis à vis the treatises of Vitry and Johannes de Mûris, the varying hypotheses of earlier scholars are first weighed. By relating its appearance to historical facts, it is here concluded that it was written no later than April 1319, and therefore the first Trecentists were in no way dependent on Johannes de Mûris or Vitry. 20 Vecchi, Giuseppe. \"Letteratura e musica nel Trecento.\" Cert I I I (1970), 485-503.

Deals principally with sacred music, but its concern with the lauda renders it relevant. It is felt that the Duecento has not yet been seen in its totality, and this article represents an investigation into the slow maturation of the musical experiments of this century, without which the astonishing achievements of the Trecento could not have been accomplished. T h e young lauda is considered hand in hand with a mature hymnody, where monody find a place by the side of polyphony and the vernacular a place beside the Latin. It is not enough to limit one's observations to the lauda output. One should rather recognize the Duecento as a century of faith, when the brotherhoods inject a brighter profession of faith into the song and language of the people. Soon the monodic ballata imposes itself on the lauda. Wesselofsky, Alessandro, ed. \"II paradiso degli Alberti\" di Giovanni da Prato. 3 vols. Bologna, Romagnoli, 1867. Giovanni da Prato's novel, II paradiso degli Alberti, written about 1390, deals with life in Florence, including its musical aspects.

One of the earliest pioneer studies on Trecento Florence, 21 and for this reason alone it must always remain in every bibliography relating to this period. In surveying briefly the rich French background, it is conceded that in Italy there was little musical activity between the years of Guido and the mid-thirteenth century. There was no Lied literature in Italy, and northern Italy took delight in Provençal poetry. About the middle of the Duecento Italy developed its own vernacular poetry, and during the Dante period Florence was a ridi and flourishing city. Poets were no doubt also composers, as Casella may have been (p. 600), and perhaps the same was true of Dante. Florentine musical activity begins early in the fourteenth century, and the notation practice of that time is described in the Pomerium, \"soon after 1309.\" Sources, composers, poets, and distinguishing characteristics are enumerated.

Although this article is concerned chiefly with Paduan fragments, it is of general interest and importance, since it is one of the earliest known articles to deal with this subject. 23 It appears to be connected with the musical supplement of fifteen works of the Italian Ars Nova, here transcribed by Wolf for the first time. Page 75 of this same volume also contains what appears to be an editorial, \" L a nostra música,\" regarding the supplement to follow. In a tribute to Professor Wolf, it is stated that Italian notation of the fourteenth century is little known, since nothing to date has been written about it and since there have heretofore been no transcriptions. 24 . \"Italian Trecento music.\" PMA L V I I I (1931), 1 5 - 3 1 . Today this paper, delivered at the Musical Association four decades ago, seems almost elementary and naive, as though the remarks were intended for a group of laymen. It might well demonstrate how far musicology has progressed since then and what noteworthy strides have been made in this particular area. Yet several points can still command attention: the general milieu, particularly Florence, the center of this activity; differing views regarding the etymology of the term \"madrigal\" and performance practice; the probability that Casella composed music and the speculation that Dante himself may possibly have also composed; the importance of the literary background, with reference to treatises dealing with metrical forms; the suggestion that perhaps the ballata was to be danced, and thus related to the estampida of the trovatori. , and H.

T h e consensus is that the publication is too \"authentic\" a reproduction, that there are errors in both transcriptions and in Italian texts, and that the Revisionsbericht is much too abbreviated. These shortcomings may be due in part to the fact that the work was published posthumously.\n\nFORMS (II) An initial glance at the entries in the following section will reveal the interdisciplinary nature of musical forms and literary forms. As has already been stated in the introduction, this bibliographic guide does not propose to go deeply into literature; yet in studying the musical forms it is impossible to divorce them from the literary ones. An effort has therefore been made to limit the references in the latter area to writings that are truly indispensable and that link the two disciplines. However, as an aid to the student who wishes to make further investigations into the literary background, an appendix with additional entries has been included (Appendix II). Angles, Higinio. \"The Musical Notation and Rhythm of the Italian Laude.\" In Essays in Musicology: A Birthday Offering to Willi Apel, ed. by Hans Tischler. Bloomington, Indiana University School of Music, 1968, 51-60. Lacking the international flavor of other European lyric monodies, the Italian lauda in its simplicity more nearly resembles improvisation and reflects the popular oral tradition. Those few laude that were passed down with musical notation may look to the cantigas of Alphonso's thirteenthcentury Spain for a clue to their rhythmic interpretation. Transcriptions.
