Conversation turned to our respective experiences working with Reinhard Strohm, whose doctoral supervision we had sought because of his unparalleled command of the European musical canon, his inluential rethinking, particularly of dramma per musica, and his insights into critical theory and the philosophy of history. In the course of our doctoral studies we had each discovered in Reinhard not only great enthusiasm for our work but also a startling humbleness about his own knowledge. Reinhard’s respect for the irreducible complexity of the past is informed by his extraordinarily broad and penetrating view of its musical, historical and intellectual terrains, and gives him a lexibility of approach, a delight in indings, and a curiosity about new historical perspectives that supported and inspired us in equal measure. his collection, published to mark his 65th birthday, attests therefore both to Reinhard Strohm’s scholarly achievements and to the creative power of his thinking. To bring this testimonial into being required generosity, patience and hard work from many quarters. All the authors who contributed to the volume deserve recognition for the enthusiasm with which they welcomed this initiative and for their prompt replies to our sometimes onerous requests. Many other colleagues and friends have also answered our call with generosity and contributed to the success of this volume with their support, advice and specialist knowledge. Our heartfelt thanks go to Irene Auerbach, Francesco Fanna, Michael Fend, Malcolm Gerratt, Lowell Lindgren, Owen Rees, Susan Wollenberg, and to all our specialist readers: Mario Armellini, Suzanne Aspden, Lorenzo Bianconi, Bonnie Blackburn, Federico Celestini, David Charlton, Teresa Chirico, Alessandro Di Proio, Laurence Dreyfus, Peter Franklin, Simon Keefe, Rainer Kleinertz, Huub van der Linden, Alexander Lingas, Pierluigi Petrobelli, Owen Rees, Angela Romagnoli, David Schulenberg, Vassilis Vavoulis and Adrienne Ward. David Burn generously put his many talents as reader, translator and language editor at the service of the project, and Bonnie Blackburn was a key source of advice and an exemplary copy-editor. Working with such a responsive, professional and dedicated team of scholars has been edifying as well as rewarding. To bring this volume to print took the support and courage of institutions and individuals. We received vital funding from the University of Oxford (Research Development Fund), the Faculty of Music, Wadham College, the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi and Istituto per la Musica at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini (Venice), the Royal Musical Association and, of course, the friends and colleagues listed in the tabula gratulatoria.\n\nxii Music as Social and Cultural Practice At Boydell Press Bruce Philips and Caroline Palmer were instrumental in obtaining our publishing contract and guiding this book to publication, and the quality of the inished product has been greatly enhanced by the participation of Alexander Campkin and Jeanne Roberts, who prepared the musical examples, and of David Roberts, who compiled the index. Essential help came from the institutions at which we are respectively employed, where meetings over meals or aternoon tea aided the resolution of knotty organisational problems. Finally, our gratitude goes to Brenda Strohm for her support, encouragement and practical help, from initial plotting in the early hours of New Year’s Day 2004 through to the project’s inal stages. Our respective husbands Philip Riordan and Andrew Joncus we thank for their patience, support and domestic troubleshooting.

Much as I have tried to shape it otherwise, this Ouverture has unavoidably turned out to be the story of our friendship, simply because the strong bond that unites us lies in our common attitude that sees music as an integral part of the history of culture, of history tout court. Our irst encounter took place in the late summer of 1964 in Salzburg, during the Seventh Congress of the International Musicological Society; it was my irst experience of a truly international gathering of musicologists, and I was strongly impressed by the dazzling variety of attitudes, personalities, methods and ideas all present on the same stage. During an interval, sitting on a lawn bathed in the aternoon sun, I started a conversation with a young student from Munich with blond curly hair, extremely polite and pleasant in manner, who happened to mention, listing them in a plain, matter-of-fact tone, the various laws he had detected, while preparing a report for the Georgiades seminar on Ars Antiqua, in no less than Ludwig’s Repertorium. he conversation, if I remember correctly, took place in Italian, a language that Reinhard had already mastered, thanks not only to his frequent visits to Italy, but also and especially because of his open attitude towards other cultures. his particular aspect of Reinhard’s personality seems to me closely connected with, in fact derived from, the cultural and intellectual milieu in which he grew up, especially the milieu of his family: his father Hans, a gracious person and a ine classical scholar, was a specialist in Synesius. It was this environment that facilitated, in the best tradition of German education and culture, the development of Reinhard’s interests, especially his view of music as an integral part of our humanistic heritage: books like he Rise of European Music, 1380–1500 and Music in Late Medieval Bruges are the direct consequence of this outlook. In 1966 the irst issue of the Rivista italiana di musicologia was published. he editorial board, to which I then belonged, had unanimously decided to request a contribution from Reinhard Strohm, to be printed next to those by Nino Pirrotta and Federico Ghisi, in order to emphasise the cultural programme we intended to foster and develop through the Rivista; we felt that Reinhard’s article would exemplify the claim that our attitude was shared by the best young scholars on the international level.\n\n2\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nIn the following years our lives and our careers moved in diferent directions. But quite unexpectedly they crossed again in 1976, at King’s College in London. he four years we both taught there together was a further occasion for the intense exchange of ideas and the development of common projects, from which I derived, needless to say, a constant and extraordinary stimulus, especially because Reinhard’s cultural interests had in the meantime shited towards eighteenth-century musical theatre, where I too had also happened to land. Later Reinhard spent the academic year 1988–9 in Rome, at ‘La Sapienza’, as Visiting Professor, and there some of the best students who had taken my courses became his students as well, in an ideal cross-fertilisation of minds and personalities. I have already mentioned en passant some of the features that characterise Reinhard’s intellectual and cultural personality: a strong sense of history, thoroughly grounded in documentary evidence, manifests itself through a broad and cogent reading of the musical event. In order to achieve this, various aspects of the historical moment in which the musical event took place are taken into careful consideration; their comnections and possible mutual inluence are closely examined, with the result that in the end the picture with which the reader is confronted is much wider and more illuminating, since it illustrates an entire historical period, and not just a musical event. his astonishing result is achieved thanks to yet another idiosyncrasy of Reinhard’s scholarship: his attitude towards the interpretation of the events or period in question. I would like to deine this attitude as dialectic, in the sense that a irst, more ‘natural’, interpretation is literally bombarded with other equally possible readings, and even challenging interpretations, the one complementing and enriching the other through a contrasting intellectual dialogue. his is possible because strong emphasis is always placed on the relationship of the musical document to the literary, linguistic and even artistic manifestations of the period. Exemplary in this sense are Reinhard’s studies in the literary tradition—Italian, French, Spanish, German—on which the seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Italian librettos were grounded. In this way a libretto becames a sort of touchstone, a primary historical document of the crossing and interchange between diferent cultural trends. In the end the operatic tradition that emerges from such a study is presented in a completely new way, and its truly European origin and signiicance are revealed. One last point I would like to make concerning Reinhard’s ‘opus’: his extraordinary skill as a writer, no matter which language he is using. In describing a musical event, or a historical moment, he manages to make it vivid, setting it before the eyes of his reader; it is not by chance, I think, that many of his writings—and this concerns various historical periods—deal with visual matters as well as with musical facts. It is quite obvious that Reinhard ‘sees’, while he is\n\nPetrobelli\n\n• Laudatio\n\n3\n\nwriting, the object of his investigation; and he manages to convey to his reader in verbal terms the physical impact the event has provoked in him. Exemplary from this point of view, it seems to me, is the book devoted to music in medieval Bruges, especially the chapter in which the constant presence of diferent sounds throughout the hours of the day in the life of the Flemish town is evoked and revealed. his is, then, a good occasion to wish that Reinhard—with our deeply felt friendship, admiration and gratitude—may continue his exemplary activity as scholar and as ‘maestro’; and at the same time to hope that in the future we will have the possibility of reading other writings by him as enriching and as stimulating as those we have enjoyed till now. I have no doubt that, from this point of view, many pleasant surprises are already in store; they await only the proper occasion to be written and produced. Ater all, surprise at the revelation of new, unexpected aspects, relationships and peculiarities is the key feature of our reactions as readers of Strohm’s writings.\n\n• Introduction • Melania Bucciarelli & Berta Joncus\n\nW\n\nhile studies in music history inevitably revolve around musical works, the concept of the ‘musical work’ itself remains as elusive as it is pervasive. he term suggests a range of assumptions about the composer’s agency and aesthetic goals, and about the dissemination or inluence of the composition. Philosophers and music scholars have argued that around 1800 the musical work had been conceptualised in its most elaborate, discrete form, crystallising as a speciic set of regulative practices in musical production and reception, against which modern and postmodern composers would have to battle. What constitutes the musical work so deined, and why it held sway during the nineteenth century, has become a subject of lively debate. he musical work, however, existed as both artefact and concept for many centuries before 1800. his was the starting point for Reinhard Strohm’s seminal re-evaluation of the historiography and ontology of the work-concept in his article ‘Looking Back at Ourselves: he Problem with the Musical WorkConcept’. Strohm argued against the commonly held view that around 1800 the paradigm of the work-concept had changed dramatically. Examining twentieth-century theorising about the musical work, Strohm showed how it resulted from the methodologies and biases peculiar to the authors and their era. Most importantly, he collapsed the argument for a watershed in Western art music marked by the emergence of a regulative work-concept. He drew attention to discussions about the musical work reaching back to the iteenth century and insisted that the conceptualisation of the musical work as such was part of a long-standing discourse that continually revisited basic themes: the unparalleled skill of creative artists, the impulse to memorialise their output, and the tension between artistic expression and social function. On this last point Strohm challenged reigning opinion by emphasising that an otherwise autonomous musical work could be integrated with social and cultural practices. he essays in this volume build on Strohm’s argument by demonstrating how social and cultural practices generate diferent conceptualisations of the musical work at diferent times and in diferent places. As such, this collection shits the debate about the work-concept from the ontological plane onto the historical. hese essays attest not only to the accuracy of Strohm’s conclusions about the work-concept, but also to the great number of internationally eminent scholars who have proited from the new perspectives they open. he articles are arranged in four sections, ordered chronologically and bound together by a shared critique. he opening section, ‘Music in heory\n\nBucciarelli & Joncus\n\n• Introduction\n\n5\n\nand Practice’, builds on Strohm’s use of medieval and Renaissance sources to explore early conceptualisations of the musical work. he results are oten startling. Amnon Shiloah tells us, for example, that authors of medieval Arabic treatises, many of whom were anonymous, recorded for posterity the practices of celebrated musicians who themselves did not notate, and thereby preserve, their music. Because a composition was largely improvised during performance, authors of treatises were describing the musical work and its aesthetic value for later audiences rather than seeking to transmit a sound event. Improvisation is also a touchstone for Anna Maria Busse Berger, who shits the paradigm of what constituted a fourteenth-century musical work. Studying artists’ model books as well as music and musical treatises from the period, she concludes that visual artists and composers drew on basically the same types of practices to negotiate shared patterns and individual inventiveness in the creative process. Both relied on the extensive memorisation of standard models – images from model books for artists, note-against-note counterpoint for musicians – which masters would embellish to create unique forms. Margaret Bent explores a group of pieces with parts labelled ‘trompetta’ and ‘concordans’ and shows how the practice of adding a contrapuntal line to existing polyphony (usually notated in a versi sections) or of crating ‘character pieces’ designed probably for instruments or their vocal imitation could in itself constitute, or reconstitute, the musical work. When applied to existing compositions, trompetta-writing could transform the work, ‘attesting that it was valued and had a living existence’ (Bent). Her indings invite further research into the intersection of scribal practices with those of performance. Performance practices were certainly a central concern of the sixteenthcentury Spanish canonist Martín de Azpilcueta, or ‘Doctor Navarrus’, discussed by Bonnie Blackburn. In outlining the competing interests operating in liturgical music between composer, performer and congregation, Azpilcueta pinpointed dilemmas central to sacred music-making: should it be a platform for masterworks, for dazzling performance, or for binding worshippers in devotion? While he commended the last, Azpilcueta conceded the legitimacy of the irst two, and their potential for enhancing the service. In their research on iteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian liturgical music and the Veneto, David Bryant and Elena Quaranta engage with the relationship between tradition and innovation, drawing on the distinction between the daily practice of minor institutions and the musical production of more important establishments. Commissioned by illustrious patrons or institutions, masterpieces belonged to a ‘history of exceptions’ and do not relect common practice and continuity of tradition in iteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian sacred music. A study of the archives of local churches, where speciic practices and social functions typically overrode other concerns, highlights the continuity\n\n6\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nin sacred music-making between the centuries, the sharing of local musicians between high- and low-level institutions, and a tendency to use instruments in musical worship during feast days or festivals. Edward Wickham provocatively enquires into the composer- and work-centred perspective of the programming and marketing of recordings of pre-Baroque music. Drawing on his experience directing the celebrated Clerks’ Group, he describes the means by which concert halls and recordings undermine, but at the same time corroborate, a Renaissance conceptualisation of the musical work. he second section, ‘Art and Social Process: Music in Court and Urban Societies’, looks at the social and cultural practices informing composition from the late Renaissance until the mid-eighteenth century. Pace the twentieth-century idealisation of the musical work as freeing itself from social function, works conceived within this time frame were oten produced to fulil such a function, yet could still constitute, and be recognised as, artistic vessels of the highest order. Owen Rees shows in his study of Luis de Aranda’s sixpart motet Quomodo sedet sola that social function could inspire profound self-expression. Aranda’s motet was one artistic element among many in the elaborate exequies staged throughout Spain to mourn the death of King Philip ii in 1598. he exequies featured specially constructed catafalques around which readings and musical ceremonies took place. Designed according to the conventions of these civic duties, Aranda’s music nonetheless conveyed the composer’s unique vision and enjoyed a life beyond the immediate context in which it was created. he same held true for Alberto Ristori, whose innovative serenate for August iii of Poland existed to legitimate the presence of a ruler unwanted in Poland. he works of Handel and Mozart can conjure up contrasting conventional notions of unique masterpieces, timeless and borderless, removed into the domain of the autonomous art work on the one hand, and of routine compositions put together to satisfy immediate demands of various natures on the other. Ellen Harris and Christoph Wolf show how much is let out by such readings. Harris explores the means by which the Italian cantata – a genre notable for its social function and, because tied to a poetic text, considered by some ineligible for consideration as ‘autonomous’ music – provided a medium for Handel to develop musical models fundamental to all his later writing. Her investigation also ofers important insights into the evident community of interests between Handel and his patrons. Mozart’s case was similar: as Wolf proves, he published the piano sonata k. 533/494 to stake public claim to his new rank as court composer. Correcting earlier readings, Wolf establishes that k. 533/494, far from being an awkward binding of a new with an old piece (the rondo k. 494), was ‘polyphonically upgraded’ by means of the rondo integrated elegantly into a sonata whose contrapuntal sophistication\n\nBucciarelli & Joncus\n\n• Introduction\n\n7\n\nand coherent structure (similar to the case of k. 475/457) not only alerted music-buyers to his talents, but also reveals the presence of ‘a forward-looking Mozartean work-concept’ (Wolf). he third section of this volume investigates the social and cultural practices of opera production in diferent eras, and the means by which musical works emerged within these opera ‘industries’. According to Norbert Dubowy, the nature of the changes made by the seventeenth-century Roman librettist Giuseppe Domenico de Totis to a libretto by Aurelio Aureli served, through its pronounced departure from Venetian practice, to articulate the speciic identity and literary ambitions of Roman intellectuals. Comparing eighteenthcentury Venetian opera to oratorio, Michael Talbot uses Vivaldi’s oratorio Juditha triumphans to clarify how the conventions of these two genres could intermingle within one work and serve celebratory intents. Melania Bucciarelli investigates more closely the instrumentalising of opera for political ends in early eighteenth-century Venice. Comparing the opera Armida abbandonata (1707) and its sequel Armida al campo (1708) to their source text (Torquato Tasso’s Gerusalemme liberata, 1587), she demonstrates how opera productions could mediate public perception of Oriental cultures and of contemporary gender roles. In the middle of the eighteenth century, the canonisation of Metastasian librettos in dramma per musica productions contrasted starkly with the seeming ephemerality of operatic compositions, which were oten designed to suit individual singers or other imperatives of production and typically changed radically between performances. Conceptualisation of the musical work could follow diferent paths. As Francesca Menchelli-Buttini explains, aesthetic achievement was traditionally ranked according to the success with which librettists adapted established dramaturgical practices for the musical stage. Composers could then expand in music upon the librettist’s poetic achievements, as Jommelli did in his setting of Ciro riconosciuto. As Berta Joncus discusses, the performance event itself could constitute a ‘musical work’ within which the performance of the star singer was oten a primary signiier for audiences. Michel Noiray challenges common views of French eighteenth-century opera. Analysing Cherubini’s Médée (1797), he points out that opera during and ater the Revolution, while generally viewed as the genre that best represented the spirit of the time, in fact perpetuated earlier Parisian traditions, such as the pantomime ballet and the compositional practices of Gluck and other leading composers. Cherubini is also the point of entry for Michael Fend’s enquiry into the relationship of this composer’s ‘hack work’ with his reputation as a writer of musical art works. Fend concludes that Cherubini’s substitute arias were a vital creative source that the composer drew on elsewhere\n\n8\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nto establish his reputation; in the light of French eighteenth-century writings on the musical work, Fend also argues against the twentieth-century notion that the genres Cherubini helped cultivate would not admit the creation of ‘musical works’. In the realm of nineteenth-century Italian opera, Emanuele Senici reveals the interactions between Verdi’s Forza del destino and Manzoni’s inluential novel I promessi sposi (1827). Tackling the widespread view that the opera lacks cohesion, Senici highlights parallels in the treatment of storia (historical, descriptive passages) and invenzione (narration) by the composer and the novelist, exploring the means by which Verdi created a musical equivalent of Manzoni’s pioneering implementation of storia within a plot. he last section of the volume covers issues of intertextuality and historiography that afect how we read musical works. In his examination of Mahler’s Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen, Federico Celestini explicates the notion of ‘aurality’, that is, an interpenetration of literature, earlier compositions and an original setting that can deepen and change the resonances sounding within the work. By contrast, Pamela Potter views the Austro-German musical canon in terms of its twentieth-century institutionalisation. She traces the continuity between the agendas of post-1918 German musicologists and those of musicologists working under the Nazis; she explains also the assimilation of these same agendas into post-Second World War German and American musicological institutions. Finally, Giovanni Morelli ofers philosophical and interdisciplinary relections on the trope of the pastoral in the musical work. From their varied perspectives the authors in this volume explore the contribution of social and historical practices to our conception of the musical work. As such, this collection pays tribute to Reinhard Strohm, whose command of repertory, originality of thought and brilliance of insight have transformed our understanding of these practices.\n\n•\n\nI\n\n•\n\nmusic in theory and practice\n\n•1• Anonymous Arabic Treatises on Music: Lost Legacies, Hidden Answers Amnon Shiloah\n\nT\n\nhe musicologist studying Arabic music of the past faces from the outset a peculiar and insoluble problem: musical documents do not exist. Owing to the absence of notation, no artefacts transmit the music from remote ages. Yet, though we can no longer recreate how the music sounded, written sources provide much information on the musical culture of the medieval Islamic world. Exploring these sources was the aim of my two rism volumes, he heory of Music in Arabic Writings. In these, I investigated and analysed over 526 texts from primary manuscript sources in collections housed in Europe, the United States, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Israel.1 What was startling about this corpus was the high percentage of anonymous treatises, a phenomenon that deserves particular attention. Statistically speaking, out of the 341 treatises described in the irst rism volume, seventy-one are anonymous; of the 184 items in the second, ity-ive are anonymous. In other words, the anonymous entries amount to roughly 25 per cent of the body of theory described. Beyond the statistical aspect, impressive in itself, many anonymous works contain a noteworthy amount of original commentary complementing what is oten recycled material. New material, although sometimes drawing on theory and speculation from famous classical treatises, more frequently addresses issues about musical works and performing practice; such commentary apparently arises from knowledge earned through a musician’s experience. Generally speaking, the ideas, valuations and aesthetics in anonymous treatises relect commentary elsewhere about musical structures and their criteria, a pattern that Alan Merriam has termed ‘verbal behavior’.2 he appraisal of anonymous Arabic treatises that follows pays special attention to the common material between the treatises and related theoretical commentary. he treatises also share a great deal of commentary among themselves, a theme that I will also 1 Amnon Shiloah, he heory of Music in Arabic Writings, Répertoire international\n\ndes sources musicales, b x (Munich, 1979); id., vol. ii, b xa (Munich, 2003) (= heory I and II). 2 Alan Merriam, he Anthropology of Music (Evanston, Ill., 1964), p. 114.\n\n12\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nexplore. Table 1.1 summarises the overlap of materials among the fourteen anonymous works cited in this study.\n\nthe advent and development of arabic writings on music Anonymous treatises shed much light on aspects and themes of a lost Arabic musical repertory. he treatises encompass diverse types of writing, ranging from the anecdotal and entertaining to the philosophical and speculative. he latter treated music as one of four branches of mathematics collectively called the Quadrivium. Writings belonging to this category emerged during the ninth and tenth centuries owing to the comprehensive translations of Greek works covering many areas of knowledge, including music. he musical treatises written under the inluence of these Greek sources followed two major trends: one relied on metaphorical descriptions, the other on speculative-mathematic descriptions; in both, the best contributors were mainly Arab philosophers. Exponents of the former, for instance, were al-Kindī (d. 840), H unain ibn Ishāq (d. 873) and the confraternity called the Brethren of Purity (tenth century). hey extolled in metaphors the place of music in the cosmos and the interrelation between music’s cosmic or ethical properties and its therapeutic efects. hey also made ample use of Pythagorean doctrine, analysing music according to numbers and numerical ratios. On the other hand, the Aristotelian philosophers like al-Fārābī (d. 950), known in Europe as Alpharabius, and Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037), known as Avicenna, studied components of music, such as melody, rhythm, acoustics and instruments. A perfect theorist, according to al-Fārābī’s views, was expected to use knowledge inferred from his observations on the foundations of music. his allowed musical material to be analysed in the light of scientiic principles. he theorist’s role was to abstract the essence of knowledge contained within music. However, before endowing the study of music with a systematic character, there existed an alternative way of discussing music and its place in man’s life. his perspective placed music in the framework of a variety of disciplines, such as literary, historical, lexicographical, legal and encyclopedic works. In many cases, observations on music were part of the encyclopedic knowledge designed to form the educated individual and stimulate intellectual powers. For instance, biographical stories about famous male and female singers and instrumentalists, observations about the emotional efect of music, musical performance, musical life, and qualities distinguishing the perfect musician followed this didactic programme. Central to these wide-ranging views on music was the strong belief that music possessed therapeutic properties, and\n\nShiloah Table 1.1 Title\n\n• Anonymous Arabic Treatises\n\n13\n\nComparative table of anonymous treatises Contents of Part i\n\nContents of Part ii\n\nUseful matters copied Cairo, Cdk, mt 13/3, from al-Fath  iyya Anon. vi; heory ii concerning music\n\nLocation & call no.\n\nComments on al-Lādhiqī’s treatise: al-Fath iyya\n\nhe inluence of music with reference to the mystic al-Nābulusī\n\nAl-Fath  iyya or Kitāb al-Fath\n\nExtensive summary of al-Lādhiqī’s al-Fath iyya\n\nhe Central Asian shashmaqam compound form\n\nAl-Fath and an Cairo, Cdk, j 7, Anon.

In the eternal debates by theologians on the lawfulness of music, the question of music’s inluence on external life was vital. Despite being oten anecdotal, the aforementioned writings bear witness to the culture concerned, revealing fundamental assumptions about the function and efects of music. he corpus is therefore highly representative, and interested scholars will proit from an acquaintance with this material as well as its related writings described below.\n\nevolving theories of musical practice Ater the classical period, the two strands of writings on music – the literary-anecdotal and the scientiic – co-existed but also merged, incorporating discussions of musical practice and performance. Unlike most of the classical speculative treatises, these writings, to which the majority of anonymous treatises belong, are seemingly by musicians, rather than by philosophers. hey are mainly concerned with problems of performance and composition. One can glean from this group of treatises hints about the major characteristics of musical practices and about prevailing musical concepts. he treatises verbalise an art that was transmitted orally and took shape spontaneously, typically with improvisation during performance. he writings remind us of the many factors – performance circumstances, the musician’s creativity and the listeners’ enthusiasm – that contributed to the work’s creation, drawing attention to the means by which nuance and subtlety distinguished Eastern musical artists and their local traditions. Such sensitivity related to the artist’s fondness for the details making up the work, suggesting that structure may have emerged in performance out of the details, rather than being preconceived. One revealing example is a dialogue between two famous musicians of the eighth century, which eloquently summarises the qualities of a perfect musician: Mālik ibn abī᾿l-Samah, one of the greatest musicians of the early Islamic period, asked ibn Surayj, his famous colleague musician, what the qualities of the perfect musician were. He replied: ‘he musician who enriches the melodies, has a long breath, gives proportions to measures, emphasises the pronunciation, respects grammatical inlections, holds long notes to their full values, disconnects short notes distinctly and, inally, uses the various rhythmical modes correctly: such a musician is considered perfect.’ Mālik ibn abī᾿l-Samah adds: ‘I reported this statement\n\nShiloah\n\n• Anonymous Arabic Treatises\n\n15\n\nto Ma῾bad (another famous musician of that epoch), who declared: “If there was a Koran of music it could not be otherwise.” ’3 Of course, the features described are not exclusive to the period when this treatise was written. hese same qualities remain of importance for subsequent generations, later being combined with factors such as innate talent, creativity, vocal and improvisatory skill and the ability to play more than one instrument. Another treatise combines theoretical-speculative features with literaryanecdotal material in a way that might be called a theory of practice. his eleventh-century treatise, by al-H asan al-Kātib, Kitāb adab al-ghinā᾿ (‘he Perfection of the Musical Knowledge’), appears to sum up the experience of a teacher aiming to improve the knowledge and taste of his musical colleagues.4 As he states at the outset: ‘Each art has an ideal of perfection and a degree of proit thanks to which the art becomes more perfect and of superior merit. Hence, one should do his utmost in the pursuit of this ideal.’5 In forty-three chapters al-H asan outlines the conceptualisation and performance of an oral musical work, while providing theoretical speculation. Al-H asan’s observations do not refer to normative or codiied theory; they evidently belong to empirical knowledge gathered from, and limited to, what musicians themselves observed and experienced, which subsequent generations of artists would add to. Many topics in al-H asan’s book show the underlying principles under study: ‘the correct arrangement of the diferent parts of the music performed’; ‘the favourite sounds and formulae in vocal and instrumental pieces’; ‘the things recommended to be set in relief in melodies, or things that should rather be disguised in melodies’; ‘the regulation of the respiration and things convenient for the larynx’; ‘on borrowing and plagiarism’; ‘the listeners’ applause and demand of repetition’ (to help increase the performer’s imaginative powers); ‘melodic modes and rhythms’; and ‘the entry into rhythm of the piece performed’, among others. Another group of chapters is devoted to the relationship between poetry and music. hese chapters are concerned with prosody and rhythm, prosody and compositional forms, and conceiving melodies that work with the poetry. In this context, al-H asan refers to ‘the musical role of the vowels’ in performance, underlining in particular the importance of the semivowels L, M, N, which in 3 See A. P. Caussin de Perceval, ‘Notices anecdotiques sur les principaux musiciens\n\narabes des trois premiers siècles de l’ islamisme’, Journal asiatique, 7 ser., 2 (1873), pp. 392–397. 4 Al-H asan al-Kātib, La Perfection des connaissances musicales, trans. A. Shiloah\n\n(Paris, 1972). 5 Ibid., p. 12.\n\n16\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nArabic can function as individual syllables. Many Arab authors claimed that because they have a pleasant, melodious sound and their sound can extend like vowels, these consonants are of great importance to the melodies. hese letters are in fact specially endowed with emotive accentuation in Koran chanting. he author’s astonishing list of special voice types in art music indicates both the predominance of vocal repertory and important considerations in vocal production. Twenty-eight terms typify distinctive vocal qualities, such as tender, redundant, hoarse, strangled, greasy, in a classiication system referring to efects – power, focus, density, volume and timbre – rather than to pitch.6 In many writings, making basic rules in prosody and poetry the ideal for composing melody, rhythm and form created a particular kind of link between poetry and music. In discussing the criteria for a musical composition or song, theorists and critics always refer to the two constituent elements of the perfect musical work – the poem and the melody – and discuss their ideal association. Melody draws sense or signiicance from the words it sets; melody in turn extends, reinforces and increases the beauty of the verse set to music. he reference is usually to the poem’s individual verses upon which the structure and modality of the melody are mapped. Analytical criteria draw on versiication, prosody and eloquence of the lyrics and various compositional parameters. While admitting that independent melodies without words are possible, authors consider such music less efective and lattering to the ear. Yet, although based on models in literature, musical aesthetics elaborated its own norms and criteria. his was particularly true for the aesthetics of musical performance, for which oral transmission was more important than for the public recitation of poetry.\n\nselected examples of anonymous treatises A group of four anonymous treatises from a manuscript collection in the National Egyptian Library (Dār al-kutub) exemplify through their shared material the characteristics of the corpus to which they belong.7 Written in bipartite form, they are clearly ailiated with a well-known theoretical treatise, al-Risāla al-fath  iyya, by the leading Ottoman author Muhammad ibn ῾Abd al-H amīd al-Lādhiqī (d. 1495).8 Al-Lādhiqī was a favourite of the 6 See Shiloah, heory i, pp. 125–6, where the complete list of the forty-three chapters\n\nof al-H asan’s work is provided. 7 hese manuscripts are described in heory ii, pp. 208–11. 8 heory i, pp. 264–7. he Risāla al-fath  iyya was published and annotated by\n\nMuhammad al-Rajab (Kuwait, 1986). he heory i entry includes the description of another treatise by al-Lādhiqī called Zayn al-alh  ān … (= Adorning of the melodies).\n\nShiloah\n\n• Anonymous Arabic Treatises\n\n17\n\nOsmanli sultan Bayazid ii (1481–1512), to whom he dedicated the Risāla alfath iyya (Epistle of Victory), probably to commemorate the sultan’s victory (his conquest of Moldavia and the western coast of the Black Sea in 1484). AlLādhiqī’s work enjoyed great popularity and a wide circulation. his probably explains the four anonymous authors’ indebtedness to this work, although none completely represents his work and only one – the shortest – mentions his name. To grasp how those works relate to their source, a short description of al-Lādhiqī’s al-Risāla al-fath  iyya is required. his extensive theoretical work (over 100 folios) is divided into an introduction and two major parts. he introduction contains three chapters dealing with the deinition of music and other generalities. Part i treats the science of melody and its components: the theory of sound; its production and perception; intervals, scales and systems; the theory and classiication of modes together with their appropriate role in composition. Part ii is devoted to the science of rhythm. It deines rhythm generally and then its parameters, dividing rhythmical modes into four classes: the six rhythmical modes of the Ancients; the eighteen rhythmical modes of the Moderns; a group of three little-used modes; and a group of nine modes, which according to al-Lādhiqī had been abandoned at his time. he title of the irst anonymous manuscript at the Egyptian National Library (Cdk, Mūsīqā Taymūr 13/3, fols 65–70) carries the title: ‘Useful Matters Copied from al-Fath  iyya Concerning Music’.9 Its irst section includes scattered features gleaned from the original work as well as from other sources. Before continuing to the second part, it explains briely why Al-Lādhiqī called his work Risālat al-fath  iyya. he extensive second and third manuscripts (Cdk, Funūn jamīla 7, 60 fols, and Mūsīqā Taymūr 11, 241 pages) are roughly similar in content and structure, and appear under the respective titles he Book of Victory and he Victory, without mentioning al-Lādhiqī.10 On the irst page of the second treatise another hand has written ‘his treatise is composed by the perfect philosopher al-Fārābī.’ his inscription was crossed out by yet another hand and replaced by the title he Victory (al-fath iyya). Both manuscripts devote the irst section largely to abbreviating al-Lādhiqī’s text while retaining his structure. his abridgement may mirror traditions in the literary mukhtasar, or compendium, a term typically used for writings condensing a longer work. hese largely preserved their source’s form and content while adding their 9 heory ii, Anonymous vi, pp. 208–9. 10 heory ii, Anonymous vii, pp. 209–10. Because of their similar content I combined\n\nthe two manuscripts in one entry.\n\n18\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nown glosses; common in medieval scholarship, they enjoyed considerable popularity among Arab writers.11 From the four treatises under consideration here, two are divided, like alFath iyya, into two major sections, while omitting al-Lādhiqī’s important introduction; the original ive discourses are subdivided into twelve brief chapters. In another deviation, the two authors replaced al-Lādhiqī’s reined classiication of twenty rhythmical modes in four distinct categories by a plainer list of twenty-one modes (one more than the original), varying somewhat al-Lādhiqī’s nomenclature. As in the original, however, this part concludes with the mode called ‘two hundreds’, or two hundred beats. his unusual mode, mentioned by another anonymous writer listing sixteen rhythmic modes,12 concludes alLādhiqī’s work, while the two anonymous treatises continue into an extensive second part, using the mode in question as an ingenious transitional device. he beginning of the fourth anonymous manuscript (Cdk, adab m 21, 59 fols) is missing.13 But the bulk of its contents and its bipartite structure show a close ainity with the other three treatises. he irst part deals with the science of melody, with some important variations. he most essential diference appears in the content of the second part.\n\nthe second parts of the bipartite treatises Signiicantly, in the second part all four treatises contain new material unrelated to the subject and the speculative approaches of the irst part. he new material introduces many elements that relate essentially to performance practice. he irst, short treatise concludes with a brief section (Mūsīqā Taymūr 13/3, fols 65–70) commenting on sound’s inluence through pitch.14 he anonymous author quotes a statement by the famous Syrian mystic, theologian and poet ῾Abd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī (d. 1731) about the properties of melodies.15 He defended music and the whirling dance of the Mewlevi order to which he belonged in several treatises. By contrast, the second and third treatises pivot between the opening and following section by posing a question about the unusual rhythmic mode of 11 See Mukhtasar Encyclopedia of Islam, new edn (Leiden, 1986), vii, pp. 536–40. 12 heory ii, Anonymous xxiv, the beginning of which is missing; it contains\n\nmaterial drawn from a treatise of Shihāb al-dīn al-῾Ajamī, who wrote at the end of the iteenth century (see heory i, p. 53). 13 heory ii, Anonymous viii, p. 211. 14 Ibid., Anonymous vi, pp. 208–9. 15 hree treatises by al-Nābulusī are described in heory i, pp. 290–4.\n\nShiloah\n\n• Anonymous Arabic Treatises\n\n19\n\ntwo hundred beats. his query was explained as being due to the performer’s particular skill. he question leads us to a far province of the Islamic world; the ‘supreme sultan Ghiyāth al-dīn Muhammad in the Royal residence of Samarqand in Bagh Naqsh’ addresses this query to the treatise’s anonymous author, presumably a musician. At this point the text suddenly changes to a completely diferent event involving another place, person and subject. he writer describes how during the Muslim month of Sha῾bān 16 in 1573, the eminent sultan of the Tabriz province, Jalāl al-dīn H  usein, ordered the author – now using the irst person ‘me’ – to compose a nawba or nūba (a suite or compound and cyclic composition) for each day of Ramadan to be performed before him.17 Although his musical colleagues doubted the feasibility of this enormous task, the author succeeded thanks to his gits and skill. In the treatise’s most revealing section, the author gives a detailed analysis of the nawbāt composed, and catalogues the names and roles of fellow musicians who participated throughout Ramadan. According to the author, each nawbāt had ive parts and included Persian poems, which are reproduced. Although I have found no information on either of the two sultans, the precise dating and the description of the technical features lend credibility to this account, at least regarding the essential features described. his story is presumably associated with the compound form of the nawba, or nūba, and its lengthy development throughout a vast geographical region. his passage in the treatise perhaps describes a precursor of the traditional Central Asian Shashmaqom during an earlier, formative stage.18 he fourth treatise based on the al-Fath  iyya also appears to attest to the evolution of the nawba form. Its second part, original as in the other treatises, appears as an epilogue ater the material ater the al-Fath  iyya. But unlike the two other treatises discussed, this section describes diferent compositional forms and performance practices in vogue during the author’s lifetime in various regions. In addition to the nashīd, the author presents the structure of two compound compositions.19 First, he describes the nūba or nawba not of 16 Sha῾bān is the name of the eighth month of the Muslim year preceding the month\n\nof Ramadan. his implies that the musician had only a short time for completing the assignment. 17 Funūn jamīla 7, fol. 55a; Mūsīqā Taymūr 11, p. 209. 18 In the traditional music of the Uzbeks and Tadjiks, Shashmaqom means literally\n\nsix maqāmāt and compositions based on them, all having the same internal structure emphasising the cyclic principle. Each maqām composition consists of two main divisions. he irst is instrumental, the other, considerably longer, is vocal and comprises an extensive set of accompanied songs. 19 he nashīd is the declamation of poetry, in chant and song. he term also desig-\n\nnates various musical forms including the vocal prelude.\n\n20\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nCentral Asia, but of the Near and Middle East, with its traditional repertory.20 his nawba is composed of ive parts, one of which, the murassa῾ (‘adorned’), combines verses in Arabic, Persian and Turkish in one song. Second, he discusses the Turkish fasl: a multi-sectional form including texts in verse and prose, as well as instrumental sections.21 he author, probably a practising musician, also describes the tah  rīr, a vocal technique that characterises Persian music, held, according to him, in high esteem.\n\nfurther instances of anonymous works in bipartite forms he bipartite pattern outlined above – theoretical speculation based on authoritative writings followed by original observations on forms, genres and performance practice – is found in many anonymous works. he authors of such treatises would appear to be professional musicians. A large group of over a dozen, mostly anonymous, treatises follow this pattern, reproducing in their introduction similar general relections, in the roughly the same order, about music’s purpose, origin and inluence. In their second part, the treatises present diferent material. Nine of them focus on the modal system and its practical application; another three devote their second part to biographies of musicians and a song anthology.22 Two lengthy anonymous treatises, Fann al-anghām (he Art of Modes) and the treatise which became widely known as Sharh  Mubārak Shāh, clarify this model.23 he latter treatise is a comprehensive commentary on the Kitāb aladwār (he Book of Cycles or Modes) by the supreme authority on modal theory, Safī al-dīn al-Urmawī (1230–94).24 he Kitāb al-adwār was analysed, commented on and circulated in many copies, becoming an authoritative model for new developments. he irst anonymous treatise, Fann al-anghām, is divided into an introduction and two chapters. he introduction describes the skilful musician, who should command all the modes, their derivations and the facility to pass elegantly between modes. Chapter 1 deals with a lost anonymous work on 20 Funūn jamīla 7, fol. 55a; Mūsīqā Taymūr 11, p. 209. 21 he Turkish multi-sectional fasl seems to have developed out of the Eastern\n\nnawba. he term refers to a sequence of various instrumental and vocal genres, allowing a certain amount of freedom; some of the pieces are improvised, others precomposed. Two restrictions had to be observed: the order of the piece and modal unity. 22 See heory ii, pp. 4–5 and a comparative table in heory i, pp. 396–7. 23 heory i, pp. 373–4. 24 Ibid., pp. 419–20.\n\nShiloah\n\n• Anonymous Arabic Treatises\n\n21\n\nthe principles of modes. Chapter 2 analyses compositions in diferent modes; beginning with the ‘father of all modes’, the rasd, the author mentions the Ayyūbid ruler al-Malik al-Ashraf (c.1200–50), ‘one of the composers of our time who mostly excelled in the mode rasd’, thus suggesting that this treatise stems from Syria around the same period. In same context, the author mentions the famous ‘Alī al-Sayyarī, author of ive hundred compositions in rasd’. Ater describing a nawba in rasd, the author distinguishes between two species of nawba: ‘the nawba of the companions’ and the ‘nawba of the masters’. he former includes four types of pieces, the bayshar, basīt, tasnīf and khafīf, while the latter uses the qawl, ghazal, taran and farudast; the author remarks that ghazal is always in Persian, while others are in Arabic. He adds that the ‘nawba of the masters is a ixed work based on strict rules and composed by a known musician’. he chapter continues with a presentation of the other modes. he Sharh Mubārak Shāh was a well-known commentary on Safī al-dīn’s seminal treatise on the modes mentioned above. he title indicates that the commentary was compiled during the early sixteenth century for Shah Shujā῾, who receives a long and eloquent dedication. H. G. Farmer believes the author is probably ῾Alī Muhammad al-Sayyid al-Sharīf al-Jurjānī (d. 1413), ‘the only scholar of the time to whom one could attribute it with likeliness’.25 his is unlikely: the anonymous author states that he is a physician who studied the science of music as an indispensable part of his medical training, while alJurjānī did not write any work related to medicine.26 No evidence supports Farmer’s attribution. his manuscript is a good illustration of the technique of systematically commenting on an authoritative work by adding to the original, phrase by phrase, notes and observations. he resulting work is three times the length of its iteen-chapter source.27 he vast critical apparatus contains many original thoughts and topics. For example, chapter 13’s commentary covers rhythmic theory and discusses composition at length, presenting independent views, without reference to the Kitāb al-adwār. he anonymous author refers to many vocal and instrumental forms (both free or improvised and pre-composed), referring partly to al-Fārābī and partly to modern practices. In chapter 14, titled ‘On the inluence of modes’ in the Kitāb al-adwār, the anonymous author interpolates observations on twelve musical genres. he inal chapter, titled, as in its source, ‘Remarks and Advice on Musical Practice’, contains explanations about 25 Rodolphe d’Erlanger, La Musique arabe, iii (Paris, 1938), preface, p. xiii. 26 Ibid., p. 186. 27 For further details see Franz Rosenthal, he Technique and Approach of Muslim\n\nScholarship, Analecta Orientalia (Rome, 1947), p. 46.\n\n22\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nthe qawl (a sung poem in Arabic) and ghazal (a sung poem in Persian), adding that the compound form of the nawba includes qawl, ghazal and tarana.\n\nconclusion he anonymous treatises discussed here have a bipartite structure. Typically they take features from, or are based on, the works of famous theorists and combine these with personal observations based on the author’s practical musical experience. hrough their dichotomy between theory and practice most of these works belong to what we may call ‘the theory of practice’, a category also masterfully illustrated in two eleventh-century treatises, one by al-H asan al-Kātib, he Perfection of Musical Knowledge,28 and another by Ibn al-Tahhān’s al-Mūsīqī, he Collection of Arts and the Consolation of the Vexed.29 Written around the same period, these two treatises, in combination with the anonymous treatises, represent a common impulse to write about the theory of practice. A further practical aspect of these treatises is their aesthetic appreciation and valuation based on contemporary music-making and its quest for formal perfection. he evident link – except in improvised music – between music and poetry partly heralded the inclusion of such discussions in treatises, since both poetry and music order their materials periodically and structure time artiicially. Based on the treatises, the multi-sectional or compound form of nawba or nūba was seemingly omnipresent, with various forms and local styles throughout the vast Islamic civilisation. he principles of a given maqām’s unity, the alternating vocal and instrumental pieces, the deined sequence of pieces, and the contrast through rhythm of heavy versus light movements (and their expression) typically form the basis of diferent suite traditions of the nawba or nūba. he nūba form developed largely through a slow cultural transmission between diferent ruling peoples. Where political and cultural exchanges peaked, the transfer of musical features probably did likewise. For example, the traditional capital of the Persian province of Adharbaydjan, the city of Tabriz, was such a location. Cited in anonymous treatises from the Egyptian Library, the majority of its inhabitants spoke a local dialect (AdharbaydjanTurkish) characterised by Persian intonation. Under the Mongols Il Khānids, Tabriz became the true centre of an empire stretching from the Oxus to Egypt 28 See above, n. 4. 29 See Ibn al-Tah  hān, H  āwī al-funūn wa-salwat al-mah  zūn, ed.

During the rule of the Iranian Safavids several Turco-Persian wars took place, changing the city’s rulers: Ismā῾īl i occupied Tabriz in 1500; the Ottoman sultan Selim made a triumphal entry into it in 1514; ater the Persian reconquest, Suleiman the Magniicent came to Tabriz in 1534; Shah ῾Abbās reoccupied the city in 1603. his period probably brought musicians from diverse areas into contact. hat said, because musicians usually followed their patron’s court and belonged to established schools, one must also assume that they preserved their indigenous practices in their new environment. he number and signiicance of the anonymous treatises raises the question of why authorship was concealed. Deinite answers escape us. One banal reason may be the defective state of manuscript sources, which are missing the front page or the irst pages. he eminent scholar Franz Rosenthal suggests another possibility: ‘he desire of certain authors to achieve celebrity for their works, even if this meant that their names had to be concealed and replaced by the name of some recognized authority.’30\n\n30 See above, n. 27.\n\n•2• Compositional Practices in Trecento Music: Model Books and Musical Traditions Anna Maria Busse Berger\n\nW\n\ne know very little about the process of composition in fourteenth- and early iteenth-century Italy. Although the most popular pieces, be they madrigals, ballatas or caccias, are notated and their composers identiied, how they came into existence is unclear. Speciically, we are not certain whether writing was necessary for their creation and transmission.1 Recent studies of compositional process show that much composition was done in the mind before being written down.2 We are faced with an enormous gap between what musical sources record and what we know about the process of, and instruction in, composition. On the one hand, we have the compositions as they are transmitted in manuscripts, which show the inished product, with voices separately notated and dissonance carefully applied and controlled. On the other hand, we have only music theory treatises devoted to the art of counterpoint to tell us how composers achieved this control and what kind of music education they received; moreover, these treatises seem exceedingly rudimentary. We know that from the fourteenth century onwards theorists oten distinguish between noteagainst-note and diminished counterpoint. However, while most of them acknowledge the existence of diminished counterpoint, they describe only note-against-note counterpoint.3 1 Ludwig Finscher dates the advent of individualised musical works to the Trecento.\n\nLudwig Finscher, ‘Zum Problem Komponisten-Individualität und Individualstil in der Musik des 14. Jahrhunderts’, International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music 6 (1975), pp. 29–45. For the most recent discussion of authorship in Trecento music, see Oliver Huck, Die Musik des frühen Trecento (Hildesheim, 2005), pp. 129–35. Huck believes that many attributions came about as a result of what he calls ‘das retrospektive Interesse der Musikwissenschat am Komponisten’; ibid., p. 133. 2 Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Compositional Techniques in the Four-Part Isorhythmic\n\nMotets of Philippe de Vitry and his Contemporaries (New York, 1989); Jessie Ann Owens, Composers at Work: he Crat of Musical Composition (New York and Oxford, 1997); Anna Maria Busse Berger, Medieval Music and the Art of Memory (Berkeley, 2005). 3 For a detailed discussion of this topic, see Claude V. Palisca and Werner Krützfeld’s\n\nBusse Berger\n\n• Compositional Practices in Trecento Music\n\n25\n\nFourteenth- and iteenth-century artists may provide us with vital insights into creative processes of this period. At the exhibition ‘Prague, the Crown of Bohemia, 1347–1437’ at the Metropolitan Museum of New York (20 September 2005 to 3 January 2006), I was particularly struck by a so-called ‘model book’ from the Viennese Kunsthistorisches Museum, Sammlung für Plastik und Kunstgewerbe (inv. 5003, 5004).4 he art historian Julius von Schlosser described this particular model book in a benchmark article of 1902, ‘Vademecum eines fahrenden Malergesellen’.5 (Was he alluding perhaps to Mahler’s song cycle?) He coined the term ‘Modellbuch’ (modern scholars use also the term ‘pattern book’) to describe it.6 he model book (c.1400) consists of fourteen tablets of maple wood held together by strips of parchment. Each tablet includes four drawings on pieces of paper (95 × 90 mm). here are forty drawings altogether of busts and one skull, and another thirteen of animal heads plus a spider (see Figure 2.1). he model book came with a leather case with hooks, which could easily be attached to a belt. Von Schlosser suggested that the teacher of an itinerant artist made the drawings and showed them to prospective patrons in an attempt to demonstrate that he could paint a wide variety of religious subjects. Von Schlosser pointed out that the drawings cover essentially any face type that an artist might have to paint: Jesus on the cross between Mary and Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, an Ecce homo, an angel, a Madonna with Jesus, a monk, Mary as regina caeli, the heads of the apostles, two old women (probably Anna and Elizabeth), two old men, representatives of upper and lower classes, the skull and the animals. Indeed, a number of drawings and panels seem to be derived from this model book. For example, two small drawings in the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge are so closely related to the head of the Virgin and the head of the archangel Gabriel that they might have been copied from the model book.7 (See Figure 2.2.)

As von Schlosser points out, heads are ‘simpliied and stylized, as are the locks of hair and the drapery’.8 Von Schlosser’s article stimulated many studies on the subject and several other model books from the late ninth to the early iteenth century have been identiied and described. In an important study treating the close similarities between Western miniatures and Byzantine mosaics, Ernst Kitzinger distinguishes three diferent kinds of model books. First are the so-called generic guides that were ‘pictorial manuals designed from the outset for repeated use’.9 Second are pictorial or iconographic guides, which oten supplied only the skeletons of the composition, for example, of a church. Artists could then ill in this skeleton with elements from his third group, the motif books. To quote 8 Ibid, p. 275. 9 Ernst Kitzinger, ‘he Role of Miniature Painting in Mural Decoration’, he Place\n\nof Book Illumination in Byzantine Art, ed. Kurt Weitzmann (Princeton, 1975), pp. 115–16.\n\n28\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice\n\nKitzinger, these are ‘somewhat haphazard collections of drawings of igures, parts of igures, occasional groups and, more rarely, entire compositions copied from various contexts’. Motif books were efectively an ‘artist’s sketch book, a jumble of jottings and notations, not of his own inventions, but of works of art he has seen’.10 hey allowed the artist to ‘lesh out sketches, with the help of an established and largely formulaic repertory of igures and scenery elements’.11 Model books helped transmit artistic creations ranging from simple drawings to more complicated designs from one place to another. Sometimes artists reproduced an earlier drawing; at other times drawings became a point of departure for something considerably diferent. Many of the models were connected with an increasing demand for altarpieces. his demand led to a more structured education of apprentices and ‘more eicient working procedures in the bottega’.12 As the art historian Robert Scheller explains: Collections were formed of models that served various purposes. hey were a stock of examples, oten collected or designed by the master, which could be used repeatedly by the bottega for any number of commissions. hey could also serve as examples for the irst drawing exercises of the garzoni, whose trial pieces also found their way into the collection.13 Model books played thus an important role in training artists. In addition, the collected exempla could be consulted by members of the workshop, who could pick suitable samples for their paintings. In the iteenth century, artists gradually replaced model books with drawings or sketchbooks and these drawings were now considered the property of the master. Students would still copy from their teacher, but at the same time try to forge their own style.14 Model books continued to live on in collections of examples for artisans and decorative artists. Sketch books, like model books, relied extensively on memorisation.15 When Leonardo classiied nasal types, he aimed ‘less to categorize nature in 10 Ernst Kitzinger, ‘Norman Sicily as a Source of Byzantine Inluence on Western Art\n\nin the Twelth Century’, Studies in Late Antique Byzantine and Medieval Western Art (London, 2003), ii, p. 1089. See also Kitzinger, ‘he Role of Miniature Painting’, p. 135. 11 Kitzinger, ‘he Role of Miniature Painting’, p. 135. 12 Scheller, Exemplum, p. 79. 13 Ibid., p. 80. 14 Ibid., p. 85. 15 David Rosand, ‘Remembered Lines’, Memory and Oblivion, ed.

For example, Dürer stated that ‘no one can ever make a beautiful igure out of his own thoughts unless he has well stocked his mind by study. … [a] wellpractised artist has no need to copy each particular igure from life. For all he need to do is pour forth that which he has for a long time gathered into him from without.’17 his short excursus shows that art historians have studied compositional process in the Middle Ages more closely than have musicologists simply because they have more evidence to analyse. Despite relating to a diferent discipline, model books suggest guidelines to help musicologists answer questions posed by art historians. Can we ind working methods for composers of medieval polyphony? How did students learn from their teachers? What would be the musical equivalent to a model book? As I have discussed elsewhere, students acquired throughout their life a memorial archive into which they delved when composing or performing polyphony.18 hey irst memorised chant, then mastered the basics of elementary music theory, and inally proceeded to study counterpoint. Every singer who wanted to learn or perform polyphony had to master counterpoint, and, as I mentioned above, theorists leave little doubt that note-against-note counterpoint represents the central part of the instruction. A number of Italian counterpoint treatises treating Trecento music – Paolo da Firenze’s Ars ad discantandum contrapunctum,19 the regola del grado treatises,20 Prosdocimus de Beldemandis’s Contrapunctus 21 and Ugolino of 16 Ibid., p. 812. 17 Quoted ibid. 18 For a more detailed discussion, see Busse Berger, Medieval Music. 19 Pier Paolo Scattolin, ‘Il trattato teoretico di Paolo da Firenze’, Mensurabilis\n\nmusicae tractatuli, ii (Bologna, 1975), pp. 63–79 (including facsimiles of the sources, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Ashburnham 1119, and Siena, Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati, LV 36).

He also wrote a counterpoint treatise that its squarely within traditions of fourteenth- and iteenth-century teachings. Because of his compositional talent, his textbook potentially ofers keen insights into how an accomplished professional thought counterpoint should be learnt. Like all early theorists of counterpoint, he deals only with composition for two parts. He starts by listing all perfect consonances – he calls them simply consonantie – followed by imperfect consonances, which he calls disonantie.24 hat he intended interval classiications to be memorised is shown by his meticulously cataloguing of every perfect and imperfect consonance for every note of the C hexachord (c–d–e–f–g–a), instead of describing generally how perfect and imperfect consonances are composed. Next, he proceeds to give examples of note-against-note interval progressions. Again, it is clear that the three-note formulas were meant to be memorised. he irst group of examples deals with various ways of going from the interval of an octave to a ith and back to the original octave. Paolo is exceedingly thorough: there are six diferent ways of going from an octave to a ith within the C hexachord, and he presents each one: the tenor repeated, the tenor ascending a second, the tenor ascending a third, and so on (see Example 2.1). Not only does he present all possible octave–ith progressions for the irst note c ut of the natural hexachord, but he gives these progressions for each of the six notes of the C hexachord, again an indication that the progressions were meant to be memorised. Before proceeding further, Paolo adds a short musical example that combines previous (memorised) material with two notes against one, some even in syncopation. Paolo’s next group of examples shows octave to sixth progressions, examining irst the movement 8–6–8, and then 5–6–8; again, he writes these out for every possible note of the natural hexachord (see Example 2.2a). He then shows the motion 8–6–8 with the tenor moving up a second (see Example 2.2b), a third and a fourth. He then turns to examples of progressions of the 22 Ugolino of Orvieto, Declaratio musicae disciplinae, ed. Albert Seay, 3 vols, Corpus\n\nScriptorum de Musica vii (Rome, 1959–62). 23 Busse Berger, Medieval Music, pp. 131–8. 24 ‘Ars ad discantandum’, in Scattolin, ‘Il trattato teorico’, pp. 63–5. he regola del\n\ngrado treatises use the same terminology for perfect and imperfect consonances. Cf. Busse Berger, Medieval Music, p. 135.\n\nBusse Berger\n\n• Compositional Practices in Trecento Music\n\n31\n\nEx. 2.1 Paolo da Firenze, Ars ad discantandum, 8–5–8 progressions (from Seay, p. 138) (a)\n\n8\n\n5\n\nPari\n\n8\n\nPari\n\nPari\n\nPari Pari\n\nPari\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nith moving to the sixth and then to the octave (see Example 2.2c); thereater he gives a group of ive examples showing various ways to progress from the twelth to the octave and back (see Example 2.2d). Between these, as before, he applies two notes against one to the progressions just explained. Four examples follow, each consisting of ive notes covering the progression 12–10–8–10–12 (see Example 2.2e). He concludes his explanation with six examples of the progression 12–10–12 (see Example 2.2f). Paolo’s treatise mirrors the procedures standard among contemporary counterpoint treatises, giving plenty of examples, notated and descriptive, of note-against-note progressions for memorisation, with no mention of diminished counterpoint.25 In the absence of written instruction, how did Paolo and other Trecento composers then learn to write diminished counterpoint? Only the compositions as they are transmitted in the manuscripts provide clues to how musicians might have acquired the art of diminished counterpoint. his evidence raises, however, more questions. Did writing down the composition ix the content, such as pitch or rhythmic value, or did Trecento musicians recompose elements of a piece in diminished versions during performance? Was there the expectation that musicians perform the version transmitted in 25 In contrast to other theorists, Paolo gives examples rather than rules, does not\n\nprohibit parallel perfect consonances and does not specify that one should move from the nearest imperfect consonance to a unison, ith or octave.\n\n32\n\nMusic as Social and Cultural Practice Ex. 2.2 Paolo da Firenze, Ars ad discantandum, 8–6–8 progressions (from Seay, p. 139)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n12\n\n(f)\n\n12\n\n8\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n12\n\n8\n\nwriting?

Table 2.1 compares these note-against-note progressions to those discussed by Paolo and Ugolino. Surveying this table, three points are apparent: irst, the theorists cover all the interval progressions in the madrigal; the composer/performer would therefore already have memorised these progressions prior to the madrigal’s composition. Second, in all eleven versions the note-against-note structure remains unaltered.28 hird, all the variations are typical of those used by performers. hese ornamentations may have originated at the keyboard, as James Haar and Nino Pirrotta suggest, or with singers, as Anne Stone maintains.29 (See Example 2.4 for three variants of bar 16.) Stone argues that some of the pieces were irst performed and only later written down. Her point is signiicant, because she discusses Ars subtilior repertory, which is considered the written text par excellence; due to its complexity, oral transmission is not thought to be an option.
