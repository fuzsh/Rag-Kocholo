        "text": "(i) Evaluation and sources.\n\nThe evaluation of Zacara changed substantially in the 1980s as a result of several factors: the recognition that a single man composed this entire body of music; the discovery of new sources and works, additionally showing that his music was exceptionally widely distributed; the evidence that he may have been born as early as ; and the belief that Ciconia was born in about rather than, as previously thought, in the 1330s. On this last matter, it now seems easy to conclude, for example, that Zacara's Gloria ‘Micinella’ and Credo ‘Cursor’ actually influenced one of Ciconia's Gloria-Credo pairs (PMFC, xxiv, , nos.3–4); as early as Layton (who was the first to recognize correctly the full extent of Zacara's output) noted the more consequential tonal structure of Ciconia's work, though he implied that Ciconia was the pioneer here. Similarly, it now seems almost certain that the ‘parody’ Gloria and Credo of Bartolomeo da Bologna were also influenced by Zacara. Fischer ( ; supported in Di Bacco and Nádas, ) also suggested that Zacara was the initiator of contrasting ‘divisi’ passages for the upper voice in mass movements, a trend continued by Ciconia and Du Fay, among others. Sadly, Zacara's theoretical treatise is extremely brief and merely enumerates the concordant pitches above each note of the hexachord.\n\nSeveral works were copied widely: two of his mass movements are known from six manuscripts, two more from five, among them manuscripts from Poland and even in one exceptional case the otherwise resolutely English Old Hall Manuscript. Many newly discovered manuscripts and fragments contain Zacara's work, particularly the important I-Fsl 2211 and I-Tn T.III.2. In addition, Simone Prudenzani's poem Il saporetto (ed. Debenedetti) cites at least seven of his songs alongside a group of songs by Ciconia. The later Abruzzo necrology added that ‘he composed several songs that are still sung throughout Italy and held in the highest regard by French and German singers’.\n\nThree main manuscripts give the basis of Zacara's work and the way it is best understood. The elegant Squarcialupi Codex devotes a section of eight openings to his songs (ff.175v–183), though only two and a bit were filled, containing seven apparently early works in an evidently planned sequence; all his other known songs could have been fitted into the now blank openings. (The date of completion of the Squarcialupi Codex remains uncertain, though current views favour .) The Mancini Codex (I-La 184 and I-PEc 3065, reassembled in Nádas and Ziino; probably finished in about ) similarly lays out its music in groups by composer, with Zacara's music in the seventh gathering and the first half of the eighth (ff.55v–66); that the first four songs here were used for an apparently coherent group of four mass movements similarly suggests careful planning. For most of his mass music the main source is I-Bc Q15 (begun in the 1420s): here there is no specific group of Zacara pieces (apart from the four based on his Mancini songs), but the pairings, which often seem improbable, are several times confirmed by other sources and suggest that the Q15 scribe had a close knowledge of his work. There must even be a suspicion that mass movements not included here are either spurious or of lesser importance.\n\n(ii) Songs.\n\nApart from the caccia Cacciando per gustar, the Latin ballade Sumite, karissimi and the madrigal Plorans ploravi, all Zacara's secular works appear to be in ballata form—an unusual feature at a time when other Italian composers were reviving the madrigal. On the other hand, his use of figurations that are typical of the older Italian notation is characteristic of his generation.\n\nThat the question of identities occupied so many musicologists for so long is easily understood: his songs in the Squarcialupi Codex are in many ways startlingly different from those in the Mancini Codex, hence Reaney's remark (CMM, xi/6, p.ix) that ‘the rather unassuming ballate of [Squarcialupi] suggest Nicolaus' authorship’. It is hard to resist thinking that the seven songs in Squarcialupi are among his earliest surviving works: there is nothing among them that matches the sheer waywardness and invention of the songs that open the Zacara group in the Mancini Codex. Indeed the only overlap between the two manuscripts is the last of the Squarcialupi songs, Sol mi trafigge 'l cor. The rest seem to owe much to the style of Landini and even Jacopo da Bologna; they have nothing of the angular and fragmented style found in his Mancini songs. Nor are they so extensive, apart from Cacciando per gustar, the longest and perhaps the last of the surviving Trecento cacce. Moreover, their texts are absolutely standard for that repertory, with none of the elaborate political or allusive manner found in the Mancini songs; and several scholars have identified traces of Roman dialect in his Squarcialupi songs. On the other hand, Ziino ( , pp.339–43) has noticed several telling contrapuntal figures in common between the Squarcialupi songs and those in Mancini; his analysis contains the germs of an eventual characterization of Zacara's musical style.\n\nZacara's Mancini Codex songs include some of the strangest in the entire Trecento repertory: their texts are riddled with obscure references but seem to be politically subversive; their music abounds in odd textures, enormous apparently textless sections, hocket and imitation. It is hard to see either precedents or successors for this music. But one view could be that this was just a different approach to the ‘mannerism’ displayed by the Ars Subtilior composers; although he composed perhaps the most rhythmically complex piece of the entire Ars Subtilior in his Sumite, karissimi, he may then have wished to try a different kind of mannerism in his music.\n\n(iii) Mass music.\n\nNo motet by Zacara survives (though Sumite, karissimi has a Latin text in ballade form) and his mass music is confined to Gloria and Credo settings, many of them apparently paired — a procedure in which he seems to have been both an innovator and an experimenter. His extensive use of hocket and imitation is far beyond what appears in the known mass music of the 14th century. Moreover the sheer length of some of his mass movements is remarkable. Together with a dazzling range of unusual counterpoint and formal designs, these features mark Zacara as a composer of often bizarrely ambitious invention.\n\nThe question of pairing is vastly more complex with Zacara than with most other composers of the early 15th century. The Gloria ‘Micinella’ and the Credo ‘Cursor’ plainly belong together as in I-Bc Q15: ranges, texture, mensural structure and cadences match. Their repeating tenor and contratenor patterns reflect the Italian motet style of the time.\n\nThe next four movements are based on four consecutive ballata settings that open the Zacara section of the Mancini codex; the appearance of the Credo ‘Scabioso’ and the Gloria ‘Fior gentil’ in the Siena fragments (I-Sas 326–7) adds intriguingly to the evidence of grouping for these four pieces. But the musical evidence for their pairing is by no means obvious. The Gloria ‘Rosetta’ and Credo ‘Scabioso’ cadence on different pitches but have the same voice ranges, the same use of perfect time, the same unusually heavy use of 6-3 triads, and make similarly incomplete use of their models. The Gloria ‘Fior gentil’ and the Credo ‘Deus deorum’ both make fuller use of their models, though they are in most other respects far more distant from one another: in voice ranges (almost an octave apart), in design, in texture and in metrical structure. But both are in major prolation throughout, end on the pitch G, and are articulated by little riffs that recur identically to link the phrases (two-voice in ‘Fior gentil’, three-voice in ‘Deus deorum’). While the Gloria ‘Fior gentil’ has the manner of a caccia, the Credo ‘Deus deorum’ is cast in a more sober alternation of two- and three-voice sections.\n\nEven odder is the case of the Gloria Gloria laus honor and the Credo paired with it in both I-Bc Q15 and I-Pu . They share voice ranges and final pitch but nothing else; and the Gloria has the added oddity of a trope found only in the contratenor line, which has none of the main text, so the work is effectively bitextual. Most perplexing of all is the pairing in I-Bc Q15 of a four-voice Gloria (ascribed to Zacara only in the index, and elsewhere ascribed to Bosquet and to Nicolaus de Capoa) with the four-voice Credo ‘du vilage’: they share only mensuration, voice ranges and the use of an alternating cursiva technique between the two upper voices.\n\nIf the scribe of I-Bc Q15 was an informed witness, the techniques of pairing used by Zacara were far more varied and indirect than those of the next generation. Apparently the use of common musical materials in the same pair or cycle was an idea that took hold only gradually. But everywhere in his music there is evidence of unpredictable procedures: the Gloria headed ‘Ad ongni vento’ has no musical link with Zacara's ballata Ad ogne vento, so perhaps its title, if correct, alludes to some common event or patron; it must in any case be among his earliest works, with its thick four-voice texture that recalls Machaut's mass.\n\nUse of the words ‘perplexing’, ‘surprising’ and ‘bizarre’ in the above remarks must surely reflect the amount that must still be done to establish a clear historical and aesthetic position for Zacara's music."
