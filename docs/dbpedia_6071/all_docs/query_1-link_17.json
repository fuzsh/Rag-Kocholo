        "text": "The later Trecento repertoire contains many short, monostrophic ballatas with philosophical or moralising texts. Why should the poets and composers, mostly Florentine, have preferred the ballata over the madrigal when exploring serious subjects, and why did they employ the monostrophic form?\n\nIt turns out that the text structure of the monostrophic ballata is, in its essentials, comparable to the pattern of the geometric demonstration from Euclid's Elements, comprising premise, argumentation and return to the enhanced, proved premise (quod erat demonstrandum). Considered in light of Florentine Humanism's engagement with philosophy, including Ockham methods of demonstration, this article examines the possibility that Francesco Landini and other composers were sufficiently influenced by philosophy to view the structure of the monostrophic ballata as a means of logical demonstrations of refined arguments.\n\n1 Even the Italian origin of the ballata is no longer certain. Aurelio Roncaglia has proposed that the form was linked to the much earlier Arabo-Andalusian poetic genre of zajal, which has a similar formal structure. See his ‘Laisat estar lo gazel (contributo alla discussione sul rapporto fra lo zagial e la ritmica romanza)’, Cultura neolatina, 9 (1949), 67–99; ‘Di una tradizione lirica pretrovatoresca in lingua volgare’, Cultura neolatina, 11 (1951), 213–50; and ‘Sequenza adamiana e strofa zagialesca’, in La sequenza medievale. Atti del convegno internazionale. Milano, 7–8 aprile, 1984, ed. Agostino Ziino (Lucca, 1992), 141–54. The extensive bibliography on this topic is summarised in Heijkoop, Henk and Zwartjes, Otto, Muwaššaḥ, zajal, kharja: Bibliography of Strophic Poetry and Music from al-Andalus and Their Influence in East and West (Leiden, 2004)Google Scholar.\n\n3 For the dating of this source, see Rijk, E. Abramov-van, ‘Evidence for a Revised Dating of the Anonymous Fourteenth-Century Italian Treatise Capitulum de vocibus applicatis verbis ’, Plainsong and Medieval Music, 16 (2007), 19–30 CrossRefGoogle Scholar, where the evidence is presented in the form of a citation that clearly permits dating the Capitulum later than 1332, definitely linking it to da Tempo's Summa.\n\n6 Such a style of performance surfaces in the description of a dance with singing in the Diaffonus, a Latin poem by Giovanni del Virgilio written in 1315–16. Here a young man began by singing the ritornello (‘Ornatae Juveni quae me sine jure peremptat / Murmure multorum funde, Cupido, preces’), which was then repeated three times by the group of young men and women, alternating with the strophes performed by the leader. See Marrocco, W. Thomas, ‘The Ballata. A Metaphoric Form’, Acta Musicologica, 31 (1959), 32–7CrossRefGoogle Scholar, at 33–4; and Bisanti, Armando, ‘Suggestioni classiche, mediolatine e romanze nel Diaffonus di Giovanni del Virgilio e ser Nuccio da Tolentino’, Schede Medievali, 46 (2008), 119–68Google Scholar.\n\n7 de’ Prodenzani, Simone, Sollazzo, ed. Milani, Matteo, Biblioteca romanica: Studi e testi (Alessandria, 2004)Google Scholar. In fact, the metric form of Sollazzo's verses adheres more closely to the barzelletta than to the ballata. They are written in octonario (eight-syllable) verse, as was characteristic of the genre in the Quattrocento, instead of hendecasyllables and/or settenari, typical of the Trecento ballatas. Howard Mayer Brown discussed the question of how these ballatas might have been sung and danced: ‘To judge from Il Saporetto, Sollazzo sang the poems alone while the guests danced. Prodenzani neither mentions instruments, nor introduces the possibility that the dancers sang a refrain.’ ‘A Lost Trecento Dance Repertory Rediscovered’, in Studien zur italienischen Musikgeschichte, ed. Friedrich Lippmann, Analecta musicologica 30/1 (Laaber, 1998), 1–13, at 4.\n\n8 Regarding the hierarchical value of contemporary poetic forms, Dante proposed, in his De vulgari eloquentia, that the poetic genres in which sublime ideas are treated must have no ritornellos. Thus, the noble canzone has no ritornello, whereas the ballata, as a genre with ritornello, is less elevated: ‘Dicimus ergo quod cantio . . . est equalium stantiarum sine responsorio ad unam sententiam tragica coniugatio’ (2.VIII.8) (I say, then, that the canzone is a linked series of equal stanze in the tragic style without a refrain and for a single train of thought.) Alighieri, Dante, De vulgari eloquentia, in Dante in Hell: The ‘De vulgari eloquentia ’, ed. Welliver, Warman (Ravenna, 1981)Google Scholar, 115.\n\n33 ‘In his treatise on Optics Euclid states that the ratio between the apparent size of objects depends on the optical angle within which they are contained, while Alhazen, reformulating this axiom, states that we can be certain of the true size of an object only if, in addition to the angle, we also know the distance between the eye and the object measured along the central axis of the visual pyramid. In terms of trigonometry it is precisely these two factors, angle and distance, which are used to measure the dimensions of an object.’ Camerota, Filippo, ‘Teaching Euclid in a Practical Context: Linear Perspective and Practical Geometry’, Science and Education, 15 (2006): 323–34CrossRefGoogle Scholar, at 325. To recall, Landini's father was the renowned Florentine painter Jacopo da Casentino.\n\n40 Stinson, J.J., ‘Francesco Landini and the French Connexion’, Australian Journal of French Studies, 21 (1984), 266–80CrossRefGoogle Scholar, at 278, lists six modern editions of Landini's poem in defense of Ockham. The first is that in Il Paradiso degli Alberti: ritrovi e ragionamenti del 1389, romanzo di Giovanni da Prato dal codice autografo e anonimo della Riccardiana, ed. Alessandro Wesselofsky, 2 vols. (Bologna, 1867), 2: 296–301. For recent editions, see Lanza, Antonio, Polemiche e berte letterarie nella Firenze del primo Rinascimento, 1375–1449 (Rome, 1971), 233–8Google Scholar; and Michael Long, ‘Musical Tastes in Fourteenth-Century Italy: Notational Styles, Scholarly Traditions, and Historical Circumstances’, Ph.D. diss., Princeton University (1981), 219–22, with an English translation on pp. 136–41. Recently I proposed a new candidate for Landini's objections in my article ‘Who was Francesco Landini's antagonist’.\n\n49 This type of rhyming is described by Antonio da Tempo in his Summa artis rythmici vulgaris dictaminis as ‘equivocus’, that is, the identical words with different meaning (Da Tempo, Summa, 87–90). See also Memelsdorff, Pedro, ‘ Equivocus: per una nuova lettura del rapporto testo-musica nel Trecento italiano’, in L'Ars Nova italiana del Trecento, VII: ‘Dolci e nuove note’, ed. Zimei, Francesco (Lucca, 2009), 143–87Google Scholar. For the correct interpretation of the ‘equivoci’ in the Detto d'amore, see the relevant entries in the Enciclopedia Dantesca (Rome, 1970).\n\n63 Quoted from http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI6.html. At present, this theorem is demonstrated differently, through drawing the altitude from the vertex angle of the given isosceles triangle and proving the congruency of the two resulting rectangular triangles. However, when Euclid was dealing with theorem 6 of Book 1, he was quite limited in the tools available for demonstration, consisting of a number of definitions, principles and axioms exposed in the introduction, and of the five previously demonstrated questions. That is why his demonstration appears to be fairly contrived as compared to the modern one. It was the nineteenth-century German mathematician David Hilbert who rearranged the axiomatic system. This, on the one hand, made possible more coherent and elegant demonstrations on the earlier stage of the studies, but, on the other hand, the gradual logical proceeding of Euclid's argumentations became much less evident for the student."
