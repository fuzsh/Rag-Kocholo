        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music From the emergence of plainsong to the end of the fourteenth century, this Companion covers all the key aspects of medieval music. Divided into three main sections, the book first of all discusses repertory, styles and techniques – the key areas of traditional music histories; next takes a topographical view of the subject – from Italy, German-speaking lands, and the Iberian peninsula; and concludes with chapters on such issues as liturgy, vernacular poetry and reception. Rather than presenting merely a chronological view of the history of medieval music, the volume instead focuses on technical and cultural aspects of the subject. In nineteen chapters, seventeen world-leading scholars give a perspective on the music of the Middle Ages that will serve as a point of orientation for the informed listener and reader; the book is a must-have guide for anyone with an interest in listening to and understanding medieval music. mark everist is Professor of Music and Associate Dean in The Faculty of Humanities at the University of Southampton. His research focuses on the music of western Europe in the period 1150–1330, French opera in the first half of the nineteenth century, Mozart, reception theory, and historiography. He is the author of Polyphonic Music in Thirteenth-Century France (1989), French Motets in the Thirteenth Century (1994), Music Drama at the Paris Od´eon, 1824–1828 (2002), and Giacomo Meyerbeer and Music Drama in Nineteenth-Century Paris (2005) as well as editor of three volumes of the Magnus Liber Organi (2001–3).\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to\n\nMEDIEVAL MUSIC ............\n\nedited by Mark Everist University of Southampton\n\ncambridge university press Cambridge, New York, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town, Singapore, S˜ao Paulo, Delhi, Dubai, Tokyo, Mexico City Cambridge University Press The Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 8RU, UK Published in the United States of America by Cambridge University Press, New York www.cambridge.org Information on this title: www.cambridge.org/9780521608619\n\n◦ Cambridge University Press 2011 C\n\nThis publication is in copyright.

But our two Austin canons pictured in the initial stand with their mouths resolutely closed. Furthermore, it is difficult to square the elaborate ligatures on the roll before which the two Augustinians stand with any sort of psalmody; at the very least the music looks more like a melisma from a gradual, alleluia or responsory; the more optimistic modern gaze might even see the tenor of a polyphonic work there. And while the cleric on the right is pointing to the notation on the roll, there is very little doubt that the one on the left is indicating solmization syllables on his hand (although never described by Guido d’Arezzo, this practice was known throughout the Middle Ages as the Guidonian Hand). In many ways, then, the initial that adorns this book addresses issues raised by its contents: monophony and polyphony, psalmody and composed chant, written and unwritten, codex and rotulus, musical literacy, cheironomy, silence and sound. The component parts of our ‘Cantate’ initial are very much the concerns of the contributors to The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music. We are interested, of course, in following the path of music history from the middle of the first millennium to around 1400, but we are also interested in the ways in which plainsong and polyphony interact: there is always the risk in any book of this sort of treating monophony – liturgical, sacred and vernacular – as something that stopped as soon as someone sang a fifth above a fundamental, and our accounts, for example, of the role of plainsong in trecento Italy or in Parisian organum of the twelfth century, or the weight given to Machaut’s monophonic songs will make clear our reluctance to fall prey to this sort of reasoning. The friction between theory and practice – perfectly dramatized by our two Austin canons – lies at the heart of much of the volume, and our chapters on liturgy and institution take us right to the centre of the question of when and when not music was composed, performed and consumed. The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music is a totally different proposition to almost every other volume in the Cambridge Companions series. Whereas The Cambridge Companion to Stainer or The Cambridge Companion to the Ocarina, when they are written, will have their scope relatively straightforwardly defined by their subject matter, our attempt to assemble\n\n2 Mark Everist\n\na companion to a body of music that spans the best part of a millennium, and most of what is now considered Europe, is an exercise fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty. So while The Cambridge Companion to Mozart and The Cambridge Companion to Rossini treat the life, works and contexts of their respective subjects in clearly different ways, there is little doubt as to how many concert arias the former wrote or how long the latter spent in Naples. Furthermore, in companions with such clearly defined limits, the scope for the examination and analysis of, say, Mozart’s Requiem or Rossini’s Guillaume Tell is broad; by contrast, the luxury of more than a handful of exemplary analyses to support general points would have made The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music significantly longer than it already is. We focus, then, on repertories and their contexts rather than on groups of works defined by composer. ‘Composer’ is of course a highly contested term. In a post-Romantic age that professionalizes the composer in a way largely unknown before the past two hundred years, it is helpful to return to the idea of composition as something that went hand in hand with singing, instruction and theorizing. In particular, coming back to the idea of composition as the placing together – as its etymology (componere) suggests – gives a context to the common medieval practices of reworking text and music sometimes over a period of centuries. This is no less a process of composition than the one portrayed in the images of Beethoven composing the ‘Pastoral’ Symphony or of Haydn composing in his best clothes. Time and time again in the pages that follow, the question of composition and authorship will surface in very different ways, and our understanding and enjoyment of medieval music will be impoverished if reworking and embellishment are treated as something on a lower plane than what we understand today as ‘composition’. There is a sense then that the canticum novum sung by our Austin Canons might allude to almost any part of the music of the Middle Ages: all could be considered old, and all could also be counted as new. What are the Middle Ages, and what should a Companion to Medieval Music include? Both beginnings and endings are severely problematic, to say nothing of the general question of periodization. One could speculate on what the successor to this volume might be called: The Cambridge Companion to Music of the Early Modern Period – in acknowledgement of the unease that the terms Renaissance and Reformation have generated? An answer to this question might assist with finding an end point for our study. But at the beginning of the period treated by this volume, the problem can be articulated through a number of questions: how does the formulation ‘late antiquity’ play into the history of music? Is there a place for the concept of the Dark Ages? What criteria might one use for answering such questions? Yet at the end of the period, there are almost more answers than questions:\n\n3 Introduction\n\nthe fall of Constantinople (1453), the end of the Wars of the Roses (1485), the beginnings of the colonization of America (1492) or the beginnings of the Reformation (1517). But as these examples show, decisions about periodization are largely formed along disciplinary lines: different fields of study prefer different solutions (European history, English history, the history of colonization, and so on). And if such divisions are marked by events that are deemed of significance in individual subject areas, it might seem, there should be little difficulty in doing the same for music, although even here there are significant differences even between different areas of study: Du Fay seems fairly placed in the ‘Renaissance’ whereas arguments are made for considering Dunstaple ‘medieval’, although Reese’s Music in the Middle Ages was unique in including the composer. Looking further afield – and this is the case in Robert Curry’s chapter on medieval music east of the Rhine – the points of change may be even more marked. It of course goes without saying that Lawrence Earp’s chapter on the modern reception of medieval music largely begins where the rest of the book leaves off. It is easy to subject the question of periodization to endless interrogation and to overlook the equally important issues of geography and topography. In this regard, The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music is simultaneously conservative and path-breaking: conservative in its conventional distinction – made by the choices of chapter and author in Part II – between England, Italy, the Iberian peninsula and Eastern Europe, but path-breaking in the synoptic view of the Middle Ages provided by Christopher Page, which, among other things, looks back to third-century Carthage as the origins of the gradual, in the context of what he calls ‘circuits of communication’. There is an important counterpoint in the volume between the disciplining of musical repertories that are given in Part II and an account of modes of musical transmission found in Page’s chapter. Needless to say, such an organization – regional studies in Part II and a chronological account of musical repertories in Part I – opens up the unattractive prospect of a Hauptcorpus identified with French mainstream repertories in Part I and subsidiary corpora in Part II, coupled to the implication that the French music that forms the basis of the chapters in Part I somehow represents a centre to which the music discussed in Part II is a periphery. Such a view is of course as pernicious as the analogous one that holds Austro-German music of later periods a centre with other repertories as ‘national’ – as if there were little or no national importance to Austro-German music or that non-Austro-German repertories had no role to play east of the Rhine. Page’s chapter goes a long way towards blurring the boundaries between centre and periphery, but it would be a wilfully blind\n\n4 Mark Everist\n\neditor who denied that any volume such as this is to a degree a prisoner of its disciplinary and scholarly past. And in other ways, The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music differs from previous studies in its attempts to control the music of the Middle Ages. While questions of performance, instrumental music and iconography are treated in those chapters where they belong, rather than being selected for special attention, Part III deploys the knowledge gained from Parts I and II to give a synoptic view on such subjects as the liturgy, institutions, poetry, composition, manuscripts and music theory. Thus, some repertories will appear both in Part III and in either Part I or II. This bifocal view enables the reader constantly to balance a view of the subject based both on repertories and on musical cultures. There is always an irony about writing about music: the one thing that characterizes music – its sonic quality, whether in modern recorded sound or musica instrumentalis – is absent, and the closed mouths of the Austin canons in our ‘Cantate’ initial bear eloquent testimony here. There is a further irony in writing about medieval music in that almost the only witnesses that come down to us are essentially visual, whether in terms of the manuscripts that preserve musical repertories or those that record theoretical and other writings about music (again our initial is emblematic). And while this irony has only recently been acknowledged in literary studies in the wake of the so-called New Philology, in music the importance of the visual – the manuscript evidence – has always been paramount. Nowhere is this more clear than in the dozens of published facsimiles of medieval music manuscripts that grace library shelves, both public and private. Hardly surprisingly, then, contributors have made regular reference to the particular wealth of visual material also available to readers of The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music. Useful collections of facsimiles are also in print (all listed in the bibliography), and may well be viewed as addenda to this volume. Particularly useful are Cullin’s L’image musique, Besseler’s Schriftbild der mehrstimmigen Musik, Bell’s Music in Medieval Manuscripts, and, more important perhaps, the online Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (www.diamm.ac.uk/index.html) where some of the material discussed in this volume is presented in high-quality colour images. Such initiatives are certain to continue with individual libraries presenting treasures of their own in an open-access digital format; major sources from St Gall and Montpellier have been made available during the final stages of work on this project, and more will certainly have emerged by the time of the book’s publication. Acknowledgements in a multi-authored volume such as this, beyond the editor’s thanks to his contributors, are probably superfluous; each contributor recognizes the debts, both acknowledged and unacknowledged,\n\n5 Introduction\n\nto the giants on whose shoulders we sit. I am however personally grateful to Penny Souster who first broached the idea of this project, and to Vicki Cooper who has supported it with such enthusiasm.

Already in the fourth century, responsorial psalmody, performed by a soloist with congregational responses, followed the readings in the first part of the mass. Descriptions of Western liturgical practice in the fourth and fifth centuries suggest an emerging repertory of chant along the lines of the full annual cycle that was established in the Jerusalem liturgy by the middle of the fifth century.1 Patristic writings such as the sermons of Saint Augustine and Pope Leo I refer to commentary by the celebrant at mass on a psalm verse just performed, but at first the liturgical assignments of these verses were not entirely fixed.2 The emphasis of early writers on the psalms in the liturgy is part of a broader intellectual movement in late antiquity that made the Book of Psalms central to Christian liturgy and exegesis; as early as Augustine and Cassiodorus, commentary traditions present the psalms as prophetic texts, and allegorical readings of the psalms profoundly shaped the choice of those psalm verses that were used as chant texts.3 The principal scriptural influence on the shape of the annual liturgical cycle was the gospel reading at mass. The Roman cycle of gospel readings for the Sundays and principal feast days of the liturgical year was established by the end of the sixth century.4 The gospel reading reflected the event commemorated on that day or occupied a place in a series that emerged from the continuous reading of the gospels over the course of the year. The theme of the gospel often shaped the texts of the liturgy for the day as a whole. Another important consideration governing the selection of chants for the liturgy was the difference between proper texts, which change according the liturgical occasion, and common texts, which remain essentially unchanged (throughout the year, during a liturgical season, or on the same day of every week). Over the course of the Middle Ages, the number of propers increased with the introduction of new feasts and cults of saints. Patristic writings suggest that the responsorial proper chants of the mass were already florid, virtuosic pieces. However, liturgical books from the period before 900 provide only the texts for the chant repertory, and\n\n10 Susan Boynton\n\neven with the development of Western musical notations in the ninth and tenth centuries, the unheighted neumes of Latin chant must still be interpreted in light of sources with staff lines. Each genre of plainsong had a particular musical style and liturgical function. In the divine office, the focus of individual hours on the communal chanting of psalms and canticles seems to have fostered musical settings that are fairly unadorned except in some of the antiphons for the canticles, and in the great responsories of matins and vespers. In the mass, the ritual focus on the Eucharist and the diverse responsibilities of the ministers involved in this celebration engendered both a wider range of styles than in the office and a more complex distribution of musical roles. The liturgy included many different forms of musically heightened declamation that correspond to various points on a continuum between song and the spoken word. Readings were sung to reciting tones that varied from place to place and also by occasion, with the most elaborate tones reserved for major feasts.5 The psalms pervaded the Latin liturgy both as the source for the texts of individual chants in practically all the genres of plainsong (except for the ordinary of the mass and the office hymn), and in the form of entire psalms, which comprised the foundation of the eight daily services of the divine office.\n\nChant in the office By the early Middle Ages the singing of psalms in the daily office followed a particular ordering which distributed the totality of the psalter over the hours of the day and the days of the week; the distribution employed in monastic churches, found in the Benedictine Rule, differed from that in collegiate or cathedral churches, where services employed fewer psalms.6 Certain feast days had particular series of psalms, which like the ferial psalm series differed slightly in monastic and secular churches. The psalms of the office were sung to tones consisting of melodic formulas employed in the syllabic chanting of a psalm verse on a single pitch; each formula had its own melody for the intonation and intermediary pause in the middle of the verse. The conclusion of a psalm verse was sung to a cadential termination formula known as a differentia; each psalm tone had several different possible differentiae.7 The lesser doxology (Gloria Patri et filio et spiritui sancto sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper et in secula seculorum amen) was performed at the end of a psalm or a group of psalms. In many chant manuscripts the vowels of the last two words in the doxology (e u o u a e) are written below the melodies of the differentiae as a guide to singers.\n\n11 Plainsong\n\nThe performance practice of psalms in the monastic office changed over time from responsorial singing in late antiquity to antiphonal singing in the Carolingian period.8 Beginning in the ninth century, the psalm tones were linked to the modes; each mode was represented by one psalm tone, and the psalm tone and possible cadences of each mode were listed in tonaries (catalogues of chants by mode). Other texts in the divine office that were sung to recitation tones were the New Testament canticles at vespers (the Magnificat) and lauds (the Benedictus).9 Over the course of the Middle Ages, the modality of chants came to be categorized in reference to the characteristics associated with these tones.10 The office genre with the largest repertory is the antiphon, a brief chant of relatively simple style sung chorally in alternation with psalms. Antiphons were performed before and after each psalm or group of psalms (and in the early Middle Ages, the antiphon seems to have been sung after each psalm verse). Antiphons for the daily office had texts drawn from the psalms with which they alternated; greater textual variety characterizes the antiphons for feast days. The mode of an office antiphon determined the choice of the psalm-tone cadence so as to ensure that the termination of the psalm was in the same mode as the melody of the antiphon. Antiphons for the psalms illustrate the relationship between mode and formulaic structure; most antiphons in mode 1 exhibit similar turns of phrase, such as a minor third from D to F and a leap of a fifth between D and A.11 These gestures combine in a melodic contour that reflects the characteristics associated with the mode. Consequently, many different antiphon texts have similar or nearly identical melodies. Longer and often more complex than the psalm antiphons are those sung with the Magnificat at vespers and the Benedictus at lauds. These chants (known as gospel antiphons because the Magnificat and Benedictus originated in the gospels) usually have texts from the gospel reading of the day’s mass. Still more elaborate antiphons are those sung at the beginning of matins with the invitatory psalm (Psalm 94, Venite exultemus), and repeated after each verse. Even antiphons that are not part of such a cohesive group draw upon similar melodic conventions. Nevertheless, the medieval repertory of office antiphons, which numbers in the thousands, exhibits enough diversity that more study is required to achieve an adequate description of the whole. Two further antiphon types are distinct from the rest of the repertory in that they were sung independently, without psalms. Processional antiphons were performed during the processions on major feasts of the church year such as Palm Sunday, Christmas, and the Rogation Days. Another genre of independent antiphon was the Marian antiphon, which emerged in the twelfth century for use in devotions to the Virgin, including the procession\n\n12 Susan Boynton\n\nafter compline that concluded with the performance of a Marian antiphon in front of an image of the Virgin. Each hour of the divine office also included a hymn, sung to a melody (usually strophic) in strophic form.12 Hymns were introduced into the office as early as the fifth century, but their melodies were rarely recorded before the eleventh.13 Another syllabic genre was the brief responsory, which consisted of a respond sung by a soloist and repeated by the choir, followed by a solo verse, a choral repeat of the respond, a solo doxology, and a second choral repeat of the respond. The simplest genres of the divine office were those texts chanted to recitation tones: besides the psalms, these comprised the readings, prayers, and versicles and responses (sung in dialogue by choir and presider) that opened and closed each service. The great responsories of matins, much lengthier and more ornate than the brief responsories, employ a wide variety of melodic formulas.14 Great responsories are proper chants; their texts are often related to the lessons that precede them. The office of matins included three sets of chants organized in units called nocturns, each one comprised of antiphons and psalms followed by lessons and responsories (nine in secular uses, twelve in monastic use).15 The verses of great responsories were often formulaic tones (one was associated with each mode), although newly composed verses are not unusual, especially in the later repertory. The performance practice for great responsories varied somewhat from place to place, but it essentially followed the alternation of choir and soloist just described for the brief responsory. The repeat of the respond was usually abbreviated to only its second half; many manuscripts contain cues indicating where the repeat should begin. According to the Benedictine Rule, the doxology should be sung only with the last responsory of each nocturn, and in the Middle Ages the custom was to perform only the first half of the doxology (the words Gloria patri et filio et spiritui sancto).16 Example 1.1, a transcription of the final responsory in the monastic office of St Benedict as found in an eleventh-century antiphoner from the Parisian abbey of St-Maur-des-Foss´es, demonstrates the repetition of the second half of the respond and the performance of the doxology. The verse of this responsory is newly composed, not one of the traditional responsory verse tones.\n\nChant in the mass Whereas the great responsories were the only musically elaborate element of the divine office, the liturgy of the mass included several different complex genres of plainsong (see Table 1.1).17 Mass began with the introit, a proper chant composed of an antiphon with psalm sung by the choir during the\n\n13 Plainsong Example 1.1 Gloria Christe tuo tibi personat in benedicto, twelfth responsory for matins of St Benedict in an eleventh-century antiphoner from St-Maur-des-Foss´es (F-Pn fonds lat. 12044, fol. 63r)\n\nprocession of the clergy into the church. The style of the introit was comparable to office psalmody, but the tones used for the psalm verses in introits were slightly more elaborate. The communion, also a proper chant, similarly included a psalm verse chanted to a formulaic tone. The length of the introit could vary according to the amount of ceremonial accompanying the\n\n14 Susan Boynton Example 1.1 (cont.)\n\nentrance of the clergy; apparently its length would be extended by performing multiple verses of the psalm. On major feasts, tropes could introduce the introit and alternate with its phrases (see Chapter 2). The introit was followed by the Kyrie, an ordinary chant with an invariable Greek text (Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison, each performed three times). Introduced into the Latin mass in the fifth century, the Kyrie was employed as an invocation in many different liturgical contexts. It was originally a congregational chant, but by the eighth century was sung by the choir, as stated in the early-eighth-century description of the papal mass known as Ordo Romanus I. Kyrie melodies seem to have originated in the same period as this change of performance practice; they can be fairly ornate, exhibiting a variety of patterns of repetition and contrast.18 Already in the earliest manuscripts containing notated Kyries, which were copied in the tenth century, many compositions include Latin verses\n\n15 Plainsong\n\nTable 1.1 Outline of the mass in the central Middle Ages introit (proper) Kyrie (ordinary) Gloria (proper) epistle (first scriptural reading) gradual (proper) alleluia (proper; replaced by tract in penitential seasons) sequence (proper) gospel (second scriptural reading) Credo (ordinary; not sung at every mass) offertory (proper) preface (celebrant’s prayer) Sanctus and Benedictus (ordinary) canon of the Mass Lord’s Prayer versicle and response (Peace) Agnus Dei (ordinary) rite of peace communion (proper) post-communion (prayer) Ite Missa Est (ordinary)\n\nthat seem to be original to the chants; recent research suggests that they were not interpolated as tropes into pre-existing Kyrie melodies (see also Chapter 2).19 The Kyrie was followed by the Gloria, which was introduced by Pope Symmachus (498–514) as a congregational chant for Sundays and saints’ feasts, but eventually came to be performed by clergy. The repertory encompasses a range of styles from simple recitation to more ornate, throughcomposed melodies. After the reading of the epistle came the gradual, a responsorial chant performed by a soloist in alternation with the choir, like the great responsory. Graduals, the oldest genre in the mass proper, take their origin from the performance of a responsorial psalm in the first part of the mass; in the core repertory of 105 graduals, all but eleven have texts from the psalms. More than half the graduals in the Gregorian repertory are based on two model melodies. The next part of the mass was the alleluia, a responsorial proper chant consisting of a melismatic vocalization on the word ‘Alleluia’ followed by a verse (usually taken from the psalms); the lengthy melisma (the jubilus) that concludes the initial Alleluia recurs at the conclusion of the verse. The performance practice of the alleluia was not everywhere the same in the Middle Ages, but generally outlined a three-part form. The first part (just the Alleluia, or the Alleluia and jubilus) was sung by the cantor and repeated by the choir, after which the cantor sang the verse, and finally the choir repeated the opening Alleluia with the jubilus. Example 1.2, the Alleluia. Ascendens Christus, illustrates the characteristic style and structure of this\n\n16 Susan Boynton Example 1.2 Alleluia. Ascendens Christus, in a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Parisian gradual (F-Pn fonds lat. 1337, fol. 158v)\n\ngenre; the word ‘hominibus’ at the conclusion of the verse is sung to the same music as the initial word ‘alleluya’. Much of the melody’s ornate circular movement remains within the span of a fifth from D to A; in the verse, the melisma on the penultimate syllable of ‘captivitatem’ explores the fourth from A to D and repeats the pitch on A, both features characteristic of the first mode. The alleluia was interpreted by medieval writers as angelic song, an image explored in prosulae (see Chapter 2), sequences, and liturgical commentary.\n\n17 Plainsong\n\nBecause of its associations with rejoicing, the Alleluia was not performed during penitential seasons such as Advent and Lent; it was replaced by the tract, a lengthy proper chant performed by a soloist. Tracts constitute one of the most formulaic genres, both in their overall structure and in their use of individual melodic gestures. The construction of tracts is closely bound to their modality; all tracts are either in mode 2 or mode 8, and those in the same mode are so similar to one another that they can be described as realizations of the same compositional template.20 The alleluia and the sequence (see Chapter 2) were followed by the chanting of the gospel reading of the day, then by the Credo, an ordinary chant with a small repertory of mostly syllabic melodies. The next proper chant was the offertory, which like the gradual is a responsorial chant with formulaic melodies set to texts mostly taken from the psalms. As it accompanied the liturgical action of carrying gifts to the altar, it originally included multiple verses, but over time the number of verses was reduced to one or at most two. Unlike the verses of the introit, which are related to office psalmody, the verses of offertories are ornate compositions.21 The Sanctus and Agnus Dei are chants of the ordinary that in the early church are thought to have been performed by the congregation (in the case of the Agnus Dei, along with the clergy); numerous melodies for these chants are preserved beginning in the eleventh century. Many feature repetitive phrases with melismas that are narrower in range than those found in the mass propers. The communion, the final chant of the mass proper, is generally less melismatic in style than the responsorial genres, and bears some resemblance to the introit in its structure of antiphon with verse. In addition to liturgical books, valuable information on plainsong can be found in theological or homiletic writings, commentaries on the liturgy, and prescriptive texts (such as monastic rules and ordinals). For instance, the Benedictine Rule, written in the sixth century and diffused in much of Europe beginning in the ninth and tenth, states unequivocally that no activity in a monastery should ever take precedence over the divine office.22 The lengthy section on the performance of the office concludes with a passage that indicates the theological significance of the liturgy: ‘therefore we should consider how one should be in the sight of the divinity and his angels, and let us stand to sing the psalms in such a way that our mind be in concord with our voice’.23\n\nThe origins of Gregorian chant Although the liturgy developed in response to the church calendar and the annual cycles of feasts, liturgical assignments were formalized or codified\n\n18 Susan Boynton\n\nat different times. In the early Middle Ages certain elements (such as the choice and number of verses in some responsorial chants) might be left to the discretion of the soloist or choirmaster, which could account for some of the differences between early manuscripts. The question of who composed the early mass proper chants and determined their liturgical assignments has no single answer. James McKinnon argues that the schola cantorum at Rome in the seventh century collectively composed the mass propers in cycles by genre, while Peter Jeffery maintains that the early mass proper chants instead cluster around liturgical occasion.24 New feasts introduced in the seventh and eighth centuries employed chants that were borrowed from already existing feasts, suggesting that a process of new chant composition had come to an end. In the Carolingian period a legend emerged attributing to Pope Gregory I the formidable corpus that had come into existence by that time, but there is no historical basis for applying the name ‘Gregorian’ to a repertory that formed gradually, in the eighth and ninth centuries. Beginning with P´epin’s consecration by Pope Stephen II in 754, the political relationship between the Frankish kings and the Holy See fostered the introduction of Roman chant in the Frankish kingdom. This tendency became a systematic programme of liturgical reform under Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. From a long-term process of assimilation came a new, hybrid repertory which would more accurately be called ‘Romano-Frankish’, although the misnomer ‘Gregorian’ remains standard (and is used here for that reason). The earliest books of Gregorian chant represent the products of reception and adaptation described in ninth- and tenth-century historical narratives that recount (from both northern European and Italian points of view) the Franks’ importation of chant from Rome.25 Even the earliest extant manuscripts containing notated cycles of Gregorian chant for the proper of the mass, which date from the tenth century, preserve a relatively uniform melodic tradition; thereafter, chants tend to have similar contours in mass books from different places. A quite different transmission pattern appears in the manuscripts of the divine office, which attest to considerable variation in the selection, ordering, assignments, and melodies of chants. Even in the first notated office books, the repertory was much less stable than the mass and more local in character.26 The coherence of the mass repertory witnessed by the earliest notated sources is particularly remarkable given that most of the musical information had to be preserved in the oral tradition. Singers had to learn from one another rather than from books, for the early forms of neumatic notation used at this time indicated general contour and phrasing, but not pitch or intervallic content. Scholars have put forth various explanations for this phenomenon. If the earliest extant notated manuscripts are chance survivals\n\n19 Plainsong\n\nof a longer manuscript tradition, they may represent vestiges of earlier written exemplars that would have made it possible for the melodies to be widely distributed in essentially the same form. Such melodic uniformity in earlier manuscripts now lost would suggest that the melodies were precisely fixed in singers’ memories for generations before they were written down. On the other hand, the relationship between notation and performance may have been more indirect; scribes copying chants could have relied primarily on what they remembered aurally instead of mechanically reproducing the neumes in the exemplar.27 Part of the mystery surrounding the origins of the Gregorian chant resides in the difficulty of recovering what came before. The Gallican chant practised in Gaul before the Carolingian importation of the Roman liturgy seems to have been almost completely effaced by the Gregorian repertory.28 The earliest extant notated sources from Rome with mass and office chants were produced in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, long after the transmission of Roman chant to the north. Many scholars believe that the Roman chant repertory was preserved in the oral tradition until that time, but we cannot be certain that the earliest Roman chant manuscripts preserve what was sung in earlier centuries.29 The melodies in these ‘Old Roman’ manuscripts exhibit a recognizable relationship to the melodies transmitted with the same texts and liturgical functions in manuscripts of Gregorian chants. In many cases the deep structures of the Old Roman and Gregorian versions are comparable, but the chants employ different melodic formulas and ways of deploying them.30 Many Old Roman chant melodies are more ornamental and repetitive than their Gregorian counterparts, as can be seen from the comparison of a Gregorian melody with an Old Roman melody for the first antiphon of lauds on Holy Saturday in Example 1.3. Many Old Roman chants also exhibit an archaic tonal organization apparently predating the eight-mode system, which developed in eighth-century Jerusalem and was received in the West in the ninth century.31 Other early Latin chant traditions differ notably from both the Roman and the Gregorian chant repertories in genre, form and style. Most of these regional traditions were largely supplanted by the Gregorian chant as a result of reforms promoted by eleventh-century popes who sought to impose the Roman rite throughout the Latin West. Practically the only corpus of Latin chant to survive this period besides the Gregorian is the Ambrosian rite, the ancient liturgy of the diocese of Milan named after Saint Ambrose (Bishop of Milan from 374 to 397). The Old Hispanic chant, which originated in the Visigothic period, was replaced in the Iberian peninsula by the Gregorian chant beginning in the late eleventh century. At the time of the suppression of the Old Spanish rite, almost none of the melodies were written down in staff notation, so the adiastematic neumes in which they are recorded\n\n20 Susan Boynton Example 1.3 Comparison of the Gregorian and Old Roman melodies for the antiphon O mors ero mors tua in F-Pn fonds lat. 12044, fol. 99r and I-RVat ASP B 79, fol. 102v\n\nhave not yet been deciphered (on the Iberian peninsula, see Chapter 9 by Nicolas Bell). The native south Italian repertory known as the Beneventan chant was also suppressed, but some of it survives in manuscripts of Gregorian chant copied in the region.32 One of the most widespread of these survivals is the Beneventan version of the Exultet, a lengthy late-antique text performed by the deacon to accompany the lighting of the paschal candle during the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday. The Beneventan Exultet had a distinctive text and melody and was performed from a scroll; several illuminated examples of such Exultet rolls have survived.33 In England, where the texts and chants brought from Rome in the early Middle Ages blended with local repertories, the Norman Conquest and the subsequent introduction of usages from France led to a radical transformation of liturgy and chant not unlike what had taken place in those parts of Europe where the Gregorian chant replaced earlier traditions. Comparison of the few extant pre-Conquest liturgical manuscripts with later books suggests that the Anglo-Saxon chant tradition did not entirely disappear, but the melodies are difficult to recover because they are written in unheighted staffless neumes. Syncretism in the post-Conquest period fostered the development of local English cathedral repertories such as the Salisbury rite, as well as particularly insular usages among the religious orders.\n\nNotation and performance With the widespread reception and adaptation of the Gregorian chant in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the melodies came to be written down more frequently. The development of staff notation in this period\n\n21 Plainsong\n\nFigure 1.1 Aquitanian neumes in a late-eleventh-century antiphoner (collection of author): antiphons and psalm incipits for the office of lauds on the Tuesday of Holy Week\n\nenables us to transcribe chant melodies and to compare them with the contours outlined less precisely by earlier unheighted staffless neumes.34 Not all staffless neumes were unheighted, however: in Aquitanian notation, drypoint lines provided an axis around which pitches could be oriented with great precision (see Figure 1.1). In the 1020s or 1030s, the north Italian monk Guido of Arezzo devised a system of staff notation with a red line indicating F and a yellow line indicating C, the type seen in Figure 1.2. In the course of the eleventh century, analogous systems using one or two lines were introduced in much of western Europe. The wide variety of neumatic notations that had existed in\n\n22 Susan Boynton\n\nFigure 1.2 Central Italian neumes in a twelfth-century antiphoner (collection of author): responsories, antiphons and psalm incipits for matins on the feast of St Martin\n\n23 Plainsong\n\nchant manuscripts gradually gave way, in many places, to a more uniform type known as ‘square’ notation (based on solid black squares). Staff notation and square notation lack most of the nuances and idiosyncrasies that are such a prominent feature of the earlier neumatic notations. Some of the performance indications that gradually fell away include the significative letters in tenth- and eleventh-century manuscripts, principally from the areas that now comprise Germany and eastern France, but also Aquitaine, Winchester and the Iberian peninsula. These letters signify directions for pitch and rhythm, instructing performers to sing higher, lower, or at the same pitch, to speed up or to slow down, and so on. Such information would have been useful because the early neumes do not indicate precise pitches, intervals or durations. Other features of early notation that all but disappeared in the high Middle Ages were the distinctive neume forms signalling ornaments or changes of vocal production. Their precise meanings are not fully understood. Notational diversity was not lost altogether, however. In some regions, particularly in Germanic areas, the Netherlands and Bohemia, neumes were used well into the thirteenth century and later, often written on staff lines. Even square notation can manifest regional particularities.\n\nLate chant composition The performance and composition of chant continued throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. Chant composition met a variety of needs, such as providing music for the celebration of new feasts, or creating a repertory of proper chants specifically tailored to a particular occasion. Although some of the most prominent manifestations of this compositional activity are tropes and sequences (see Chapter 2), the same historical context gave rise to thousands of new chants for the mass and office. Late chant resembles the earlier layers of Gregorian chant in many ways, but tends to use melodic formulas and conventions even more consistently. In a few rare cases one can study the work of individuals who created new services by composing new chants and compiling existing ones.35 Following a trend initiated in the tenth century, many new office chants had texts in verse (sometimes in quantitative metres); for a number of saints, entirely new versified offices were composed.36 In late offices, the antiphons and responsories were often arranged in modal order, so that a chant in mode 1 would be followed by one in mode 2.37 The earliest examples of such organization are the offices attributed to Bishop Stephen of Li`ege (ruled 901–20).38 Modal ordering was not a universal feature of new offices, but it was common enough to indicate that from the tenth century\n\n24 Susan Boynton\n\nonwards, composers of chant consciously deployed the eight modes as they are described by theorists of the period, emphasizing the final pitch and the species of tetrachord (fourth) and pentachord (fifth) that, in combination, comprise the typical range of each mode. By the eleventh century, each mode was associated with certain melodic gestures that pervade the corpus of late chant. Both old and new office antiphons embody these features, whereas office responsories present a wider range of possibilities. For the verses of great responsories, composers employed the traditional melodic formulas associated with the modes, adapted the existing tones for the verses, or composed entirely new music for them. Each office presents its own combination of tradition and innovation.39 With the spread of new religious orders across Europe cam"
