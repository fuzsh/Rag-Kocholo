        "text": "Bruce Springsteen has spent much of 2024 touring…when he’s able to, that is. The rocker has had to take some time off from a number of shows due to some vocal issues, but other than a handful of concerts, he’s been entertaining audiences across the U.S. and Europe throughout the year.\n\nAll the excitement around his continuing tour, paired with a very special anniversary, has helped one of Springsteen’s most beloved projects return to the charts.\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. is back on the U.K. albums chart this week. The title reappears at No. 56 on the ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths in the country.\n\nSpringsteen’s classic is now 40 years old, which may be hard for some longtime fans to accept. Born in the U.S.A. is one of the most successful and beloved rock albums in history, and clearly people all around the world–and especially in the U.K., at the moment–are still enjoying the many hits the title produced.\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in 1984. After several months, it climbed to No. 1, where it would eventually spend five weeks on top.\n\nThroughout the years, the set has racked up 136 weeks somewhere on the U.K. albums chart. It’s Springsteen’s second-longest-running title, as only his 1995 Greatest Hits compilation has spent more time on the tally. That collection has thus far earned 143 stays on the roster.\n\nWhile it remains incredibly popular, Born in the U.S.A. hasn’t been seen on the U.K.’s main albums ranking for many years. The last time the title was found on the chart was back in April 2015. For one week that year, it sat at No. 50, before disappearing again for nearly a decade."
