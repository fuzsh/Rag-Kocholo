        "text": "I finally got to see Bruce Springsteen in his own right when he played Villa Park, my first ever show in the Midlands, and only my fifth outdoor stadium show, the most recent of which was Bon Jovi and Manic Street Preachers at Anfield in June 2019, as reviewed here.\n\nI went along with my friend Brenda from the football, whom I’ve twice been to gigs with before (but never just the two of us) – the ABBA tribute act Waterloo at the then-Echo Arena in October 2008 and then Manic Street Preachers and British Sea Power at Mountford Hall in the University of Liverpool two years later.\n\nI arrived into Birmingham at lunchtime, heading off for a few hours of solo adventuring before we got the shuttle bus up to Villa Park.\n\nI sought out the city’s oldest surviving record shop The Diskery, but sadly its recent move around the corner seems to have led to it no longer stocking any CDs so my visit was short-lived.\n\nI had a pint of St. Austell’s Proper Job sitting outside The Sly Old Fox before briefly browsing a remarkably stock-empty second-hand bookshop over the road.\n\nThere was still time before I was allowed to check into my hotel, so I headed to The Craven Arms for Brew 61’s very pleasant Spring Meadow.\n\nAfter a brief pit-stop at the hotel, I headed to Nicholsons’ Bacchus for a pint of Pale Brummie from Birmingham Brewery, as well as nice beef brisket burger, while also continuing to make my way through the boss’s thoroughly readable autobiography.\n\nI made one final stop, at The Wellington, which I had visited in July 2022 en route to my annual Oxford jaunt. I think I had the same as last time, Oakham Ales’ Citra.\n\nBrenda and I met in the hotel lobby and joined the lengthy, but fairly quick-moving queue for the bus, with the journey speedy enough and entry to the venue very smooth also.\n\nMy history with the boss\n\nFeel free to skip ahead to the next section if you’re not interested in when and where I got hold of all my Bruce CDs!\n\nThe first Bruce I ever bought was Nebraska on tape back in the very late 1980’s, I believe, while I think I also owned The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle and Tunnel Of Love on cassette and a couple of 7” singles, the double-sided I’m On Fire/Born In The U.S.A. and Cover Me backed with a live version of Tom Waits’ Jersey Girl.\n\nNebraska was also the first of his albums I got on CD, for £7.99 from Sister Ray in March 1993, picking up CD singles by The Fall and Luna at the same time.\n\nI added the then-new Greatest Hits for £9.99 from WH Smith in Kensington in April 1995 before purchasing Born To Run and Darkness On The Edge Of Town second hand from the Music & Video Exchange in Notting Hill, for £7 and £8 respectively, a month later, also getting Scarlet’s Naked and compilations by Simple Minds and Sandie Shaw at the same time – presumably I popped in quickly and browsed the ‘S’ section!\n\nI got The River from Our Price in Richmond for a tenner in June 1996, then the 18 Tracks outtakes collection from Reckless Records for £8.99 in September 1999., when I also returned home with The Fall’s The Light User Syndrome and The Chiselers single.\n\nA week later I was in Madrid for work, and I bought Tunnel Of Love and The Ghost Of Tom Joad from FNAC for 1,395 pesetas each (about £5.50 at the time), as well as Tom Waits’ Mule Variations.\n\nI got the boss-adjacent All I Want Is Everything: The Best Of Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes (1979-1991) from Virgin on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles on a work trip in September 1998 for £7.99 (not quite sure how I have it down at such a UK-specific price point!), also getting albums by Carlene Carter, Rosanne Cash and Lucinda Williams at the same time.\n\nDecember 2000 brought me Born In The U.S.A. from HMV on Oxford Street as part of a mammoth 21-disc spree, with albums by The Four Brothers, Art Garfunkel, Van Dyke Parks and Elvis Presley also in that haul.\n\nI bought the debut Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. album from HMV on a trip to Kingston in January 2001, buying six other albums from there that day, including ones by Emmylou Harris and Iris DeMent.\n\nWhile working for a short while at Sony in Basingstoke I was able to pick up the odd cheap CD from the company’s stocks, so I got the brand new The Rising in August 2002 for just £4.50.\n\nNext up for me was 1973’s The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, which I paid £4.99 for from HMV in Covent Garden in June 2005, also picking up albums by Ryan Adams, Mary Gauthier, Rooney and Richard Thompson at the same time.\n\nI got to see Bruce in the flesh when he guested on two songs with Lucinda Williams at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire in November 2006, a cover of Melvin ‘Lil’ Son’ Jackson’s Disgusted and then her Joy from Car Wheels On A Gravel Road. Here’s Joy:\n\nI went quiet on the boss front until I bought the new Wrecking Ball via Amazon for £7.96 in April 2012, having missed a few of his more recent albums, then getting January 2014’s High Hopes immediately on release from WOW HD for £8.99.\n\nI left my Springsteen collection there until I knew last summer that I would be attending this gig. I then proceeded to plug pretty much all the gaps, all at bargain prices.\n\nI got the 1992 pair of Human Touch and Lucky Town via an Amazon seller for a combined £4.37 last July, adding Western Stars from Music Magpie for £3.60 and Letter To You from Amazon for £5.56 in September.\n\nMusic Magpie also yielded Magic (£2.65), Working On A Dream (£2.63) (when I also bought I Am Sam – Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture) and The Promise (£3.06) in October, while I found Devils & Dust in Soho’s Reckless Records for £4 that same month, also unearthing some cheap copies of albums by Eels, Randy Newman and Dylan & The Dead.\n\nI managed to find the excellent double Springsteen On Broadway for just £4 in Sister Ray in November, just a few days after watching the performance on Netflix for the first time, when I also picked up some albums by David Bowie, Low, The Magnetic Fields, Mudhoney and Tom Waits dirt cheap.\n\nThat same month I paid £5.26 for the triple Live/1975-85 via Amazon before getting last year’s soul covers record Only The Strong Survive from HMV in Liverpool last January, with this only costing me £2 as I part-exchanged it for an unwanted Christmas gift.\n\nMy most recent acquisition was We Shall Overcome – The Seeger Sessions via Discogs for £6.30, also in January, meaning I now have 31 discs’ worth of Springsteen, putting him ninth in my list of most-owned artists.\n\nNebraska remains my favourite of his many albums, alongside Darkness. I’ve never grown to love either Born To Run or The River as much as their reputations would suggest, but I’ve definitely gained a fair appreciation for his recent work in the past few months, with some of the gig’s highlights even being songs from this millennium.\n\nThe main event\n\nAfter a lengthy wait for some food for Brenda, and some water in the heat, we managed to get in touch with our friend Peter, who was also at this show, successfully navigating our way across the pitch and finding him with his wife.\n\nHe was also with a young scouser that I think he’d just stumbled across, who turned out to also be a season ticket holder, and a regular at aways both at home and abroad, so a few war stories were shared as we waited in the warm evening until Bruce and co. entered at about 7.15pm.\n\nThe set was very similar to other shows on the tour, with half of the twelve songs off Born In The U.S.A. featuring, and tracks off seven other albums out of his 21 studio efforts, including the two most recent ones, but nothing off 2014’s High Hopes or Western Stars from 2019.\n\nTo get my only gripe out of the way first, there was very sadly nothing off Nebraska, despite Johnny 99 having been played at some previous dates on this tour.\n\nHe kicked off with No Surrender off Born In The U.S.A., one of the second-tier numbers off that (very good) album in my opinion.\n\nHe was backed a seventeen-piece band, if my counting was up to scratch. The big names amongst those were guitarists Steven Van Zandt (aka Little Steven) and Nils Lofgren, Garry Tallent on bass (sporting an Elvis t-shirt) and drummer Max Weinberg (who I have just discovered is the father of Slipknot skinsman Jay Weinberg!).\n\nFor the sake of my anal completeness, it’s worth saying that Lofgren features on several Neil Young albums in my collection and the self-titled Crazy Horse debut (bought from HMV in Meadowhall, Sheffield as part of a 3-for-£20 deal in November 1994, also getting three Sparks LPs in the same deal and albums by The Jesus And Mary Chain and The Police).\n\nI also have the second record by his band Grin, 1972’s 1+1, bought from Stand Out! Records in Ladbroke Grove for £9 in January 2002 (together with albums by Food, The Gun Club, J.K. & Co. and Sir Douglas Quintet), while he also plays on Carl Perkins & Ringo Starr’s Honey Don’t on the former’s 1996 Go Cat Go! guest-packed album (snapped up for just £2.99 from Fame in Amsterdam in October 1999).\n\nTallent is on three tracks of Bill Lloyd’s 1994 power pop album Set To Pop that is also on my shelves (bought from an Amazon seller for £10.53 in November 2010), also featuring on Steve Earle’s I Feel Alright from two years later (acquired for £8.99 from MVC in Cardiff in August 1998, on a trip to South Wales to stay with my best mate’s parents in Porthcawl. I also bought the Marty Robbins two-fer Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs/More Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs at the same time.)\n\nOthers on stage included Soozie Tyrell on acoustic guitar, keysmen Roy Bittan and Charles Giordano, Jake Clemons on sax (the nephew of Clarence) and percussionist Anthony Almonte.\n\nBittan plays on a pair of Bowie albums (1976’s Station To Station, which I bought for £8.50 from somebody online in September 2002, and Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) from 1980, which cost me £5.32 from Amazon in February 2016, with the parcel also containing Soft Days by Sea Pinks), Peter Gabriel’s second eponymous LP from two years later (bought from HMV on Oxford Street for £6.99 in April 2003, at the same time as Johnny Cash’s 1960 LP Ride This Train) and Lucinda Williams’ Car Wheels On A Gravel Road (that I got from Virgin in Kingston for the odd sum of £6.02 in January 2001, alongside John Hiatt and Barry White compilations and a Neil Young album).\n\nAnyway, back to the gig! After Prove It All Night from Darkness came a slightly surprising early highlight in the title track to Letter To You, a song not known to large swathes of the audience, but one I definitely enjoy.\n\nIt’s noteworthy how many of his title tracks are amongst the best on their albums, especially so in recent years.\n\nThe classic album cuts kept coming, before a bit of a dip for me in the form of the lengthy, jazzy Kitty from his second LP and then perhaps the least interesting song off the current record, Nightshift, originally by the post-Lionel Richie Commodores.\n\nI was asked by the woman next to us who Brenda had been talking to “do you know this one?” in a surprised tone during The E Street Shuffle from the second album. It was clearly not one she knew, but I’m not quite sure why she seemed to find it odd that someone else did.\n\nHe returned to Born In The U.S.A. for My Hometown before saying that The River was “for Birmingham”, with this apparently being the song’s debut on this tour – on its 43rd date.\n\nBruce gave his first lengthy speech before the next song, recalling the 2018 death of George Theiss, the only other surviving member of their high school band The Castiles. This had inspired the number he performed solo with acoustic guitar, later joined by Barry Danielian’s trumpet – Last Man Standing from Letter To You. This proved to be the biggest highlight of the whole show for me.\n\nI’ve just discovered that Danielian features on David Byrne & Brian Eno’s Everything That Happens Will Happen Today from 2008 that nestles in my racks (bought from the Music & Video Exchange in Notting Hill for £6 in January 2012 as I also purchased albums by Richmond Fontaine and Isobell Campbell And Mark Lanegan).\n\nAfter Backstreets from Born To Run came another peak in the set for me in the form of Because The Night, which I know most from the Patti Smith Group version that was on their 1978 Easter album (which I got as a birthday present off my best mate Kris in February 1990). It was first recorded by Bruce and the E Street Band at the very start of the Darkness sessions in June 1977, but didn’t appear in studio form until the 2010 The Promise archive set.\n\nDespite this being one of my favourites in the set, I found it remarkably difficult to move in any kind of time to. I’m blaming the nature of the song rather than my skills!\n\nBorn To Run’s She’s The One went down well, but I enjoyed more the next brace of fairly recent title tracks – Wrecking Ball and then The Rising.\n\nBadlands from Darkness was up next as the set hit the home straight, with much of the crowd singing the opening to Thunder Road before Bruce delightedly joined in.\n\nThe band didn’t vacate the stage with the encores flowing straight afterwards, as Born To Run followed Born In The U.S.A..\n\nThree more off USA followed in a row, with the pick of them for me being Glory Days. After Dancing In The Dark, Bruce theatrically ripped his shirt open and then introduced the band.\n\nThe final band number was Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, the fifth song to feature from Born To Run, with the big screen dominated by tributes to the fallen Danny Federici (organist who died in 2008) and especially Clarence Clemons (d. 2011).\n\nThe band left the stage, with the boss staying on alone to perform the touching I’ll See You In My Dreams from 2020’s Letter To You (making it four in total to be pulled from that LP), meaning that two of my favourite moments of the set came from this somewhat unheralded album. It left me wondering how good it would be to be able to see him performing without the band, but that seems a little unlikely.\n\nSo, he finally went off stage a smidgen under three hours after having kicked things off, leaving me and no doubt the vast majority of the crowd well satiated.\n\nAs detailed, the set list proved to be nicely varied, obviously weighted towards the biggest hitters at the end, but covering off plenty of great, slightly lesser-known songs too.\n\nDespite six cuts from Born In The U.S.A. getting an airing, these didn’t include two of the seven singles released off the album in the US (but just five in the UK) – I’m On Fire and Cover Me.\n\nI made a CD for the car probably eight to ten years ago, exclusively from his first eight albums. Just eight of the seventeen songs I included made the set-list, so some of my favourites that got left out were Growin’ Up from the debut, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) off the second album, Adam Raised A Cain and the title track of Darkness, The River’s Hungry Heart, Cover Me and anything from Nebraska or Tunnel Of Love.\n\nIn terms of the ‘newer’ albums, he also didn’t sing a few other songs I’ve already got to like a fair deal, despite being only more recently exposed to them, such as Land Of Hope And Dreams from Wrecking Ball and The Ghost Of Tom Joad.\n\nHowever, it was indeed a boss night – one I’d be happy to repeat, depending on location, timings and cost.\n\nTonight’s t-shirt\n\nIn honour of his most recent record of soul covers, and his deep roots in those sounds, I wore my somewhat faded yellow Stax t-shirt.\n\nAs well as a large number and variety of Bruce tees, I spotted others for Aerosmith, Arctic Monkeys, Janis Joplin, Little Steven, Pearl Jam, Blackberry Smoke, Neil Young, Nirvana, Dropkick Murphys, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, The Gaslight Anthem, Iron Maiden, Ramones, IDLES and Hüsker Dü.\n\nFollow me\n\nIf you want to get an email notification each time there is a new blog post (about once a fortnight, on average), then click on the “Follow” button at the bottom.\n\nPlaylist"
