        "text": "The Fourth of July gives us a chance to celebrate everything that makes America a big, messy and complicated but wonderful place to be. So, this week, we thought we'd look back at an album that's all about this push and pull in our country: Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A., which recently turned 40 years old.\n\nTo do this, we dug back in NPR's archives to share a couple of pieces. One is the original review of the album that aired in June of 1984. We've also got a reappraisal from 2019 that digs into how and why the title track has been so wildly misunderstood over the years."
