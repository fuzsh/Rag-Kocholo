        "text": "These musicians write the songs that make the whole world sing—take a tour of the homes that shaped them\n\nWe at AD can certainly understand the public’s interest in the well-designed homes of music’s biggest stars. But even though seeing the best that a chart-topper’s album sales, record-breaking tour earnings, and refined taste can net is our bread and butter, there’s something special about going back to where their journeys began: their childhood abodes. Some, like the two-room Tupelo, Mississippi, house Elvis Presley was born in, have become their town’s claim to fame and host a constant trickle of visitors. But regardless of whether they announce their starry heritage with a plaque or sit unassumingly behind the bushes in a quiet neighborhood, there is an undeniable magic in the grounds of these storied dwellings. Read on for a look at the childhood homes of seven Grammy winners."
