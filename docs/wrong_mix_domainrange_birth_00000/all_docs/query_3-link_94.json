        "text": "The Jersey shore home where Bruce Springsteen wrote the album “Born to Run” is back on the market.\n\nThe two-bedroom cottage at 7 ½ West End Court in Long Branch is owned by three fans of the singer. They bought it in 2009 with the idea of turning the home into a tribute to the New Jersey rock legend, but those plans were derailed.\n\nSpringsteen has said that he wrote every song on the “Born to Run” album — including the title track and other classic songs such as “Thunder Road” and “Jungleland” — while living in the home from 1974 to 1975.\n\nThe house does occasionally draw visitors, and the current owners say they try to accommodate the fans.\n\nThe home’s list price is $299,000."
