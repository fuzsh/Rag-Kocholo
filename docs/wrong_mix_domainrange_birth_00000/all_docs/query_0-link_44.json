        "text": "‘GLORY DAYS’ IN NEW JERSEY\n\nFifty years ago, Bruce Springsteen released his first album, “Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.,” named for the beach town 20 minutes up the Garden State Parkway from my family’s summer house in the Pine Barrens.\n\nEvery June, on the way to our place, we’d pass the Jersey Freeze stand in Freehold where Springsteen took his children for ice cream. But we didn’t turn off the highway to visit the town in the title of his landmark album. Asbury Park was a sad, rundown place that had been losing visitors for years to spiffier spots like Long Beach Island.\n\nBut Springsteen and I had things in common besides our Jersey Shore roots."
