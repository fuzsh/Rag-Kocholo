        "text": "Bruce Springsteenâs iconic album âBorn in the U.S.Aâ turned 40 years old this month.\n\nThe titular track on the album has become an anthem for political rallies, though itâs notoriously thought of as a pro-America song even though the actual lyrics tell a different story.\n\nSteven Hyden chronicled the historic album in his new book âThere Was Nothing You Could Do: Bruce Springsteenâs âBorn in the U.S.Aâ and the end of the Heartland.â\n\nHyden joined âInside the Issuesâ host Amrit Singh to discuss the political role the rock song has played over the last four decades.\n\nHyden explains in the song âBorn in the U.S.Aâ Bruce Springsteen writes about the perspective of a disillusioned Vietnam War veteran who feels the country has left him behind, but because of the catchy chorus, it got appropriated as a pro-America song for political rallies.\n\nâThe greatness of this record is that [Springsteen] is writing about an America with a great amount of complexity. Heâs someone who ultimately believes in the possibility of America â the potential of America to live up to its ideals,â Hyden said. âBut heâs also taking stock of where America falls short.â\n\nHyden also writes in his book that Springsteenâs songs are a uniting force for both Democrats and Republicans. In a way such that both sides can identify with Springsteen in their own way.\n\nâBruce, in this era, was something of a Rorschach test for a lot of Americans,â Hyden said.\n\nSpringsteen would use his songs to speak out about progressive issues. Hyden points out conservatives still would see him as an example of a hard worker who embodies American ideals.\n\nAnd 40 years later, âBorn in the U.S.A,â is still played at political rallies, âYou would think by now people would know what this song is about,â Hyden said."
