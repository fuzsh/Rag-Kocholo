        "text": "Are you The Boss' biggest fan? Do you have the windows open right now, singing every last note of Born to Run? You may have gotten to know Bruce Springsteen over the years for his marathon concerts and gritty brand of rock 'n roll, but now it's time to get to know him in a more intimate, personal way.\n\nSpringsteen: His Hometown is a historical exhibit that looks at how Monmouth County has been a major part of this star's career. Continue reading to learn more about this unique exhibit and what you can expect to find there.\n\nGet to Know Bruuuuuce Like Never Before\n\nThe Springsteen: His Hometown exhibit will have over 150 unique items on display. It features selections from the Monmouth County Historical Association, The Bruce Springsteen Archives, and Center for American Music at Monmouth University. The Monmouth County Historical Association will play host to these items.\n\nWhat items will you be able to see up close? We're glad you asked.\n\nHow about a personal scrapbook made by Bruce's mom, Adele, that takes a look at Bruce's earliest days? There's also a 1943 high school yearbook from Adele that provides an up-close family history.\n\nThere's even a 19th century Civil War document that includes information about Alexander Springsteen, an ancestor of Bruce.\n\nUnderstanding Every Note of Springsteen's Most Popular Songs\n\nDo you know the history of the first band Bruce was ever a part of? The Castiles originated in Freehold, and were one of Bruce's first bands that he played in. He was able to get on-stage experience in this band that played local benefits and high school graduation dances (even Bruce's very own class of 1967 dance in June of that year). See an original color poster from the Castiles at the exhibition.\n\nNebraska was Springsteen's 6th album, released back in the fall of 1982 on Columbia Records. It's still remembered as one of his top releases, thanks to the title track and other songs like Atlantic City and Mansion on the Hill, which have become staples in live shows over the years. See the 4-track recorder that was used to record some of these songs!\n\nPurchase Your Ticket Today\n\nGrab your ticket, bring a friend or family member, and celebrate the life of The Boss at the Monmouth County Historical Association. This exhibit runs throughout 2020, and Boro residents and MCHA members get in for free!"
