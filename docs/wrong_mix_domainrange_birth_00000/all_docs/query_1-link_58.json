        "text": "He may have been born in the USA but it seems Bruce Springsteen also has a hungry heart for exploring his Irish lineage.\n\nThe 73-year-old singer-songwriter's great-great-great-grandparents left Rathangan in County Kildare for New Jersey in 1853.\n\nSpringsteen visited the town on Thursday while in the Republic of Ireland for a string of live shows.\n\nSitting around a pub table with locals, at one point he broke into song.\n\nThe Grammy-winning musician joked he would sack his band after the pub's customers joined in for the chorus of My Hometown, the final song on his 1985 album Born in the USA.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
