        "text": "Just as we pass Saint Patrick’s Day, the luck of the Irish continues through Freehold. The Borough is set to become twin cities with Bruce Springsteen’s ancestral home in Ireland.\n\nThe Asbury Park Press reports that a seven-person delegation from Rathangan, Ireland, will visit the Township. The two towns will forge A twin city resolution during the March 18th council meeting. It is then the Mayor and The Council will authorize the twinning agreement.\n\nThe council meeting is scheduled for 6:30 pm. The full agenda can be read here.\n\nALSO SEE: Bruce Springsteen: His Top 50 Songs Ranked\n\nAbout Freehold’s New Twin City\n\nRathangan is a town West of County Kildare, with a population of just over 3,200 as of 2022. It is located about 40 miles from the center of Dublin.\n\nThe town is the ancestral home of many residents in Freehold, including Bruce Springsteen.\n\nAsbury Park Press reported that Springsteen’s great-great-grandmother on his father’s side, Ann Garrity, came to the township in 1852.\n\nA hidden gem of Rathangan is the Bog of Allen Nature Centre. This is a center point of conservation for the area.\n\nAccording to the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, who maintain the land, there are 250,000 hectares of peatland in Ireland. 1 hectare is the equivalent of just about 2.5 square feet.\n\nRathangan, Co. Kildare, Ireland\n\nFind local businesses, view maps and get driving directions in Google Maps.\n\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band are scheduled to return to Ireland in May for their 2024 world tour.\n\nThis is not the first time Freehold forged a twinning bond with another city. Just 5 years ago, Freehold passed a resolution joining the township and Peralejos de las Truches in Spain. The Spanish town named Bruce an “adopted son” in 2014.\n\nBruce and Freehold\n\nSpringsteen continues to leave a fun footprint on the township. Freehold is slated to be the future landing spot for the Bruce Springsteen Story Center. This will serve as a museum and event space at the firehouse on W. Main Street.\n\nPer the Asbury Park Press, Freehold is working with Monmouth University on the effort.\n\nSign me up for the WRAT email newsletter!\n\nJoin ClubRAT for access to all the perks delivered right to your inbox from Jersey's Concert Connection!
