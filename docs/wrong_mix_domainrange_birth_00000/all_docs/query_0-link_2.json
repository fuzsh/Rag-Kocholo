        "text": "Gary Lewis, a lifelong Freehold Borough resident, remembers when his childhood friend “Brucie” started playing the guitar on the borough’s Holmes Terrace.\n\n“I can remember very, very well,” Lewis said. “He was friends with David Oakley and Larry Lee. They would throw stones, play marbles and baseball, and then Brucie started playing guitar.”\n\nThe future Boss could be heard playing next to a vegetable stand on Throckmorton Street, Daniels, 60, said.\n\nWATCH: Bruce Springsteen calls Trump a \"lying, racist moron\n\nMORE: Bruce Springsteen and a camera crew visit Freehold\n\n“In my heart, I knew Bruce Springsteen was a good guy and he was destined for stardom,” said Lewis, whose brother is the late Dan Lewis, formerly of the Detroit Lions. “Brucie always walked around town with a guitar on his back.”\n\nBruce Springsteen, famous around the world for his rock ’n’ roll, returns to Freehold to promote his new autobiography, “Born to Run,” noon Tuesday, Sept. 27 at Barnes & Noble. It’s the same day the book is being released by Simon & Schuster. The event is billed as a special “appearance” which will include a pre-signed copy of the book.\n\nTickets have already been distributed for the event.\n\n“He's coming back to a bookstore,” said Freehold historian Kevin Coyne. “It’s not a concert stage, it’s not a bar, and it’s not Jersey Freeze. What’s cool about it is he’s transitioning from a rock ’n’ roll artist to an author. It’s not improbable as he’s been one of the greatest writers of the last 50 years, but he’s been writing songs. If you take the songs together, they add up to one big novel.”\n\nSpringsteen and a camera crew visited St. Rose of Lima School in Freehold, which he attended, on Tuesday, Sept. 6 for CBS’ “Sunday Morning,” which aired Sept. 18. Prior to that, he last publicly appeared in Freehold for a benefit show in 1996 at the St. Rose gymnasium. In 1982, Springsteen jumped on stage with Sonny Kenn at the Monmouth County Fair, held in Freehold Township.\n\nYet he’s certainly been no stranger to Freehold. The rocker’s primary residence in Jersey is in Colts Neck, a short drive from town.\n\n“We have an unwritten rule in Freehold when he’s in town, we just let him have his quiet time and not draw attention to his visit,” said Freehold Mayor Nolan Higgins. “It’s not unusual for him to come here. He’ll visit Federici’s (Family Italian Restaurant) and Jersey Freeze — those are the places that have been reported — and his roots are here, his family roots are here. He’s quietly behind the scenes, and he’s been generous to a lot of people here, and he’s helped a lot of people in town without anyone knowing about it.”\n\nSpringsteen grew up on Randolph Street, in a house that is no longer there; on 39 Institute St. and 68 South St., the site of the many “battles” between him and his father, Douglas Springsteen, that the Boss used to share with audience members earlier in his career. The Springsteens were a working-class family. Springsteen distilled his experiences in Freehold and the Jersey Shore — both the good and bad — and used them to tell a bigger story about America.\n\n“For in the life of our country only a handful of people have tapped the full power of music to tell the real American story — with honesty; from the heart; and one of those people is Bruce Springsteen,” said President Barack Obama during his remarks when Springsteen received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009.\n\nMORE: Springsteen and 9/11: We need you now\n\n“The reason people respond so viscerally is because he’s not making these stories up,” Coyne said. “It’s a record of the lives of real people, and that’s why people (who are fans of Springsteen) come here — they want to know what’s the raw material. I’ve never been to Liverpool, but Penny Lane, to me, is different. Those are landmarks, points on a map. Bruce’s connection to Freehold is so deep that you see him walking down Randolph Street, he’s still trying to figure out how all that stuff came out of there.”\n\nIn Freehold, Springsteen recognized the multicolored mosaic that is America through the diversity of the town. He had black friends, and his first kiss was with a Hispanic girl.\n\n“Back in those days, we were accepting of each other, we were working-class people,” Lewis said. “In my neighborhood, you looked out for each other, no matter what color you were.”\n\nSpringsteen’s “My Hometown,” from 1984’s “Born in the U.S.A.”, was a visceral portrait of the racial tension, economic distress and downtown blight that had befallen his hometown of Freehold — and many other Shore towns — starting in the ’60s. The song told a story that echoed across the nation. It was released as single in 1985 and became a Top 10 hit.\n\n“My cousin lost an eye when a guy pulled out a gun,” said Daniels, referring to the lyrics of “My Hometown.” “(Springsteen) put that into the song.”\n\nIn 1969, Springsteen moved out of Freehold to Ocean Township and then subsequently several other Shore towns en route to rock 'n roll stardom as his parents and youngest sister moved to California.\n\nMORE: Springsteen at MetLife: Boss' 6 best stories\n\n\"I would come back and visit these streets many, many times, rolling through them on sunny fall afternoons, on winter nights and in the deserted after-hours of summer evenings, out for a drive in my car,\" Springsteen writes in \"Born to Run.\" \"I would roll down main street after midnight watching, waiting, for something to change. I would stare into the warmly lit rooms of the homes I passed, wondering which one was mine. Did I have one? I'd drive past the firehouse, the empty courthouse square; past my mom's now-dark office building; past the abandoned rug mill, down Institute Street to the Nescafe plant and baseball field; past my copper beech tree, still rooted and towering in front of the emptiness that was once my grandparent's house (on Randolph Street); past the memorial of white crosses for our fallen war heroes at the town's end; past my dead at the St. Rose of Lima Cemetery -- my grandmother, grandfather and aunt Virginia -- then out to the pitch-black highways of Monmouth County.\"\n\n\"This town, my town, would never leave me, and I could never completely leave it, but I would never live in Freehold again.\"\n\nNow, Springsteen's Barnes & Noble appearance will being national attention to the Freehold on Tuesday.\n\n“I think Freehold will be portrayed in a very positive light,” Higgins said. “It’s significant that he’s here to have the event in Freehold, which starts off a national (book) tour.”\n\nIt’s the talk of the town.\n\n“Bruce loved his music, and I always thought he would make it one day,” Lewis said. “It’s crazy. God works in mysterious ways.”\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com"
