        "text": "âAstonishing.â\n\nâVanity Fair\n\nâAn utterly unique, endlessly exhilarating, last-chance-power-drive of a memoir.â\n\nâRolling Stone\n\nâFrank and gripping.â\n\nâDavid Brooks, The Atlantic\n\nâBruce Springsteen's life is now officially an open book. Born to Run takes readers on a riveting ride through the everyman rock starâs deeply lived existence.â\n\nâAssociated Press\n\nâIntensely satisfying...Born to Run is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people and a gift for sizing them up..â\n\nâDwight Garner, The New York Times\n\nâSpringsteen can writeânot just life-Â­imprinting song lyrics but good, solid prose that travels all the way to the right margic...And like a fabled Springsteen concertâalways notable for its deck-clearing thoroughness âBorn to Run achieves the sensation that all the relevant questions have been answered by the time the lights are turned out. He delivers the story of Bruceâin digestibly short chaptersâvia an informally steadfast Jersey plainspeak thatâs worked and deftly detailed and intimate with its readersâcleareyed enough to say what it means when it has hard stories to tell, yet supple enough to rise to occasions requiring eloquenceâsometimes rather pleasingly subsiding into the syntax and rhythms of a Bruce Springsteen song.\"\n\nâRichard Ford, The New York Times Book Review.\n\nâA virtuoso performance, the 508-page equivalent to one of Springsteen and the E Street Band's famous four-hour concerts: Nothing is left onstage, and diehard fans and first-timers alike depart for home sated and yet somehow already aching for more.â\n\nâNPR\n\n\"Kinetic...The ultimate rock star shares like he's got one last chance to make it real. It's like sitting next to Springsteen in the campfire light hearing his life story -- you'll be begging for another exhilarating refrain.\"\n\nâPeople (Book of the Week)\n\nâExcellent...very funny....eminently readable and engaging. Springsteen was also born to write. He has an active, energetic style that is part Jack Kerouac and part Instagram post.â\n\nâAsbury Park\n\nâBorn to Run has a compelling narrative and an organized structure worthy of a Catholic schoolboy of the 1950sâ¦.Mr. Springsteen writes fluidly about subjects light, dark and darker. Heâs funny and solemn, tender and insightful. In Born to Run, he risks his mythic stature, but he emerges as more substantial, more admirable. Now Mr. Springsteen isnât merely a star. He is a man â a son, a husband, a father and a friend â willing to share what heâs learned.â\n\nâWall Street Journal\n\nâRichly rewardingâ¦.Bruce Springsteen proves that he has taken on life fully engaged both in living and examining it, and in doing so, heâs delivered a story as profoundly inspiring as his best musicâ¦.Itâs alternately brutally honest, philosophically deep, stabbingly funny and, perhaps most important, refreshingly humble.â\n\nâLos Angeles Times\n\n\"A master storyteller.... the language of his memoir often sings and leaps off the page with alliteration and pulse, especially when he's rhapsodizing about rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nâWill Hermes, NPR\n\nâBoth an entertaining account of Springsteenâs marathon race to the top and a reminder that the one thing you canât run away from is yourself.â\n\nâEntertainment Weekly\n\n\"Bruce Springsteen is the bard of lost American dreams....The origin of poetry, thought William Wordsworth, was emotion recollected in tranquillity. That motto describes both the content of Mr Springsteenâs book and the appeal of his songs, many of which look back on youthful traumas from a mature perspective.â\n\nâThe Economist\n\nâGloriousâ¦a philosophically rich ramble through a rock 'n roll lifeâ¦. Reading his intimate look back on a remarkable yet troubled life, itâs safe to say that Bruceâs aesthetic wouldnât be complete without this long-form Song of Springsteen. Itâs the lyric he was born to write.â\n\nâUSA Today (four stars out of four)\n\nâWhere Springsteen soars â both as musician and writer â is in his ability to bear witness, not only to his own inner life but to the lives of those left behind in the post-industrial wastelands of this nation. Springsteen made it out of Freehold, but he never turned away from the âgrinding hypnotic powerâ of the place and its people. Born to Runâ documents the unlikely rise of a rocker hellbent not on escape, but on reckoning with the moral failings of the world he was born into.\"\n\nâBoston Globe\n\n\"A masterpieceâ¦.Bruce Springsteen could have put out a collection of recipes in Esperanto, cribbed from Campbell soup cans, and it would still be an international bestseller. Typically, he went the distance. And the result is nothing short of magnificentâ¦.I wish I could buy everyone a copyâ¦.This isn't just a book for Bruce fans, but for anyone who loves rock 'n' roll, the Shore or the last 40 years of Jersey pop-culture history. It's as epic as his recent four-hour concerts. And just as satisfying.â\n\nâJacqueline Cutler, NJ.com\n\n\"He must be conceded a magic with words: He can spin not only a yarn but often an extended analysis, too.... His disclosures here are rich, deep, and useful to help destigmatize mental illness.\"\n\nâSlate"
