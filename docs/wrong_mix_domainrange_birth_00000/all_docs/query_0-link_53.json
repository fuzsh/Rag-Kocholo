The anniversary edition also features a gatefold sleeve and exclusive booklet with archival material from the era, new liner notes penned by Erik Flannigan and a four-color lithograph. Originally released on June 4, 1984 - ‘Born In The U.S.A.’ had an unprecedented seven Top Ten singles on its tracklist, sold 17 million copies to date and captured the pop culture zeitgeist with once-in-a-generation impact.\n\nLos Campesinos! - All Hell\n\nExpected Release 19th July 2024 The UK’s first and only emo band Los Campesinos! return with thei...\n\nExpected Release 19th July 2024 The UK’s first and only emo band Los Campesinos! return with their highly-anticipated seventh album, ‘All Hell’. It is perhaps their most ambitious and assured album yet, whilst simultaneously recalling everything we’ve come to love about LC! over their faultless discography.

Hers is a specific and singular corner of the Great American Songwriters, artists like David Berman, Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Tweedy and Sufjan Stevens. They’re artists connected by a sense of immediacy, not just in the writing – which is precise, evocative, brutal at times, pitch-back funny right when you need it – but by their delivery, by the way they sing with an immersiv...\n\n£11.99 – £28.00\n\nCigarettes After Sex - X's\n\nReleased 12th July 2024 We have a limited number of signed prints to give away with purchases of ...\n\nReleased 12th July 2024 We have a limited number of signed prints to give away with purchases of the album. With X’s, Cigarettes After Sex finally takes centre stage as not just one of today’s preeminent indie bands, but as one of the most globally accomplished acts across any genre, whose often unconventional path to superstardom has helped reshape the very definition of success for artists in the modern era.
