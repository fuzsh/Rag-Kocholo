        "text": "The Boss wrote the classic album inside this house in Long Branch, New Jersey.\n\nWhether you’re a Bruce Springsteen fanatic or not, there’s no question The Boss is an icon.\n\nHis 1975 album “Born to Run” is an all-time classic, featuring hits like the title track and “Thunder Road.” Springsteen wrote the entire album 40 years ago inside this cozy beach home at 7 1/2 West End Court in Long Branch, New Jersey.\n\nA visit would be enough for some Springsteen fans, but now, you can actually own it.\n\nAccording to a report from the AP, three fans bought the home in 2009, and had big dreams for the 828-square-foot cottage by the sea:\n\n“They bought it in 2009 with the idea of turning the home into a tribute to the New Jersey rock legend, but those plans were derailed.”\n\nDamn, that sounds like a song Springsteen would sing, right? According to NJ.com, the trio simply couldn’t say no to the “Bruce-factor.”\n\nAnyway, the 2-bedroom home is now being listed for $299,000, has a new roof and is located just a short walk from the beach."
