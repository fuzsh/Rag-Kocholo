        "text": "Pokémon Go regional exclusives tie a handful of Pokémon to specific locations around the globe.\n\nEach new Generation in Pokémon Go has their own regionals - whether it's spawning only in that region, continent or hemisphere or having their forms spread out across the globe, encouraging players to travel and trade to catch 'em all.\n\nSince their release, by and large the creatures have remained locked to their specific regions, except in a handful of special events or regional swaps.\n\nSo unless you travel a lot - or have Friends willing to Trade them - you might have to be patient for them to arrive on your shores.\n\nHere on this page we'll run through the entire Pokémon Go regional exclusives list, as well as providing all regional exclusive locations of course, so you can get out and find them.\n\nOn this page:\n\nPokémon Go regional exclusives map and how regional exclusives worko\n\nPokémon Go exclusives by region, from Africa to New Zealand\n\nHow to catch Gen 1 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 2 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 3 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 4 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 5 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 6 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nHow to catch Gen 7 regionals in Pokémon Go\n\nPokémon Go regional exclusives map and how regional exclusives work in Pokémon Go\n\nEach generation of Pokémon has several creatures you can only find in specific regions. These can be specific countries (such as the USA's Tauros), entire continents (Europe's Mr. Mime), certain regions (Corsola in the Tropics), the postcards from the region (the various Vivillon patterns) and even 'halves' of the planet (such as Lunatone and Solrock).\n\nThese creatures are fairly common spawns in these regions, so if you are visiting for a short period, it won't take long to find them.\n\nRegionals can be found spawning in the wild - so don't expect them in gyms or in nests. From September 2019, regionals have also been made available in Eggs - but only from their respective regions. This is also the only way to get Mime Jr., the Gen 4 pre-evolution to Gen 1's regional exclusive Mr Mime.\n\nDecember 2022 introduced Scatterbug, Spewa and Vivillon to Pokémon Go, with the selection of Vivillon patterns all being connected to different regions across the world. To earn a Scatterbug encounter, you need to pin a number of postcards sent with Gifts from a specific region and, once caught, this bug can be evolved into a Vivillon with the pattern for that region. To learn more, visit our Vivillon map and pattern guide.\n\nIf you don't travel, then don't fret. Gen 3 has shown these creatures can swap round occasionally (such as Zangoose and Seviper) or drop regional exclusivity altogether (Plusle and Minun) and as mentioned above, shift temporarily for special events, such as Farfetch'd during Pokémon Go's 2017 Travel Challenge.\n\nBelow you'll find a map of all the regional exclusive Pokémon in Pokémon Go:\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nThank you to zoglandboy from reddit for creating this map.\n\nPokémon Go Regional Exclusives List -
