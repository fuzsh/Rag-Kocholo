        "text": "Video game-related events in 1980s\n\n1970s . 1980s in video games . 1990s Other topics: Anthropology . Comics . Fashion . Music . Science and technology . Sociology\n\nThe 1980s was the second decade in the industry's history. It was a decade of highs and lows for video games. The decade began amidst a boom in the arcade video game business with the golden age of arcade video games, the Atari 2600's dominance of the home console market during the second generation of video game consoles, and the rising influence of home computers. However, an oversatuation of low quality games led to an implosion of the video game market that nearly destroyed the industry in North America.[1] Most investors believed video games to be a fad that had since passed,[2] up until Nintendo's success with its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, Famicom) revived interest in game consoles and led to a recovery of the home video game industry.[3] In the remaining years of the decade, Sega ignites a console war with Nintendo, developers that had been affected by the crash experimented with PC games,[4] and Nintendo released the Game Boy, which would become the best-selling handheld gaming device for the next two decades.[5] Other consoles released in the decade included the Intellivision, ColecoVision, TurboGrafx-16 (PC Engine) and Sega Genesis (Mega Drive).\n\nNotable games of the 1980s included Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, Metroid, Elite, Tetris, SimCity, Galaga, Contra, Pitfall!, Frogger, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, Defender, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Super Mario Bros. 2, Bubble Bobble, Double Dragon, Final Fight, Ninja Gaiden, Adventure, Joust, Robotron: 2084, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Arkanoid, Populous, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, R-Type, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Super Mario Bros. 3, Prince of Persia, Sid Meier's Pirates!, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, Gauntlet, Strider, Tron, Dragon's Lair, Golden Axe, Ms. Pac-Man, Out Run, Dungeon Master, Final Fantasy, Altered Beast, Shinobi, Tempest, Lode Runner, Super Mario Land, Battlezone, Dragon Quest, Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, Pole Position, and Marble Madness.\n\nConsoles of the 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nThird generation consoles (1983–1993)\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in 1983 the third generation began with the Japanese release of the Family Computer (or \"Famicom\"; later known as the Nintendo Entertainment System in the rest of the world) by Nintendo. Although the previous generation of consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of this generation that home consoles were first labeled by their \"bits\". This also came into fashion as 16-bit systems like Sega's Genesis were marketed to differentiate between the generations of consoles. In the United States, this generation in gaming was primarily dominated by the NES/Famicom. Other notable consoles included Sega's Mark III, also known as the Master System.\n\nEarly Fourth generation consoles (1987–1996)\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in 1987 with the PC Engine in Japan and ending in 1996, with the last console being the Neo-Geo in 1991, the fourth generation of video game consoles consisted primarily of games and systems programmed for the 16-bit era. During this generation, 2D graphics had improved over the previous generation and experimentation began to occur with 3D graphics, although 3D games were more prevalent on the PC at the time. The fourth generation also was the first time compact discs were considered a viable port for video game retail sales with the CD-i. Some of the most notable systems released during this generation were the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1990), the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1988), and the Neo Geo (1991).[6] Nintendo's Game Boy was also released during the fourth generation, which would later become the most popular series of handheld gaming systems during the 1990s.[7] A rivalry between Sega and Nintendo occurred during this generation, starting the first ever console war.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGolden age of arcade games\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early-1980s, arcade games were a vibrant industry. The arcade video game industry in the US alone was generating $5 billion of revenue annually in 1981[8] and the number of arcades doubled between 1980 and 1982.[9] The effect video games had on society expanded to other mediums as well such as major films and music. In 1982, \"Pac-Man Fever\" charted on the Billboard Hot 100 charts[10] and Tron became a cult classic.[11]\n\nThird-party development and an oversaturated market\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing a dispute over recognition and royalties, several of Atari's key programmers split and founded their own company Activision in late 1979.[12] Activision was the first third-party developer for the Atari 2600.[13] Atari sued Activision for copyright infringement and theft of trade secrets in 1980,[14] but the two parties settled on fixed royalty rates and a legitimizing process for third parties to develop games on hardware.[15]\n\nIn the aftermath of the lawsuit, an oversaturated market resulted in companies that had never had an interest in video games before beginning to work on their own promotional games; brands like Purina Dog Food.[16] The market was also flooded with too many consoles and too many poor quality games,[17] elements that would contribute to the collapse of the entire video game industry in 1983.\n\nAmerican video game crash of 1983\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1983, the video game bubble created during the golden age had burst and several major companies that produced computers and consoles had gone into bankruptcy.[18] Atari reported a $536 million loss in 1983.[19] Some entertainment experts and investors lost confidence in the medium and believed it was a passing fad.[20] A game often given poster child status to this era, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial had such bad sale figures that the remaining unsold cartridges were buried in the deserts of New Mexico.[21][22]\n\nRise of computer gaming\n\n[edit]\n\nThe brunt of the crash was felt mainly across the home console market. Home computer gaming continued to thrive in this time period, especially with lower-cost machines such as the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Some computer companies adopted aggressive advertising strategies to compete with gaming consoles and to promote their educational appeal to parents as well.[23][24] Home computers also allowed motivated users to develop their own games, and many notable titles were created this way, such as Jordan Mechner's Karateka, which he wrote on an Apple II while in college.[25]\n\nIn the late 1980s, IBM PC compatibles became popular as gaming devices, with more memory and higher resolutions than consoles, but lacking in the custom hardware that allowed the slower console systems to create smooth visuals.[26]\n\nRejuvenation\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1985, the home market console in North America had been dormant for nearly two years. Elsewhere, video games continued to be a staple of innovation and development. After seeing impressive numbers from its Famicom system in Japan, Nintendo decided to jump into the North American market by releasing the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES for short. After release it took several years to build up momentum, but despite the pessimism of critics it became a success. Nintendo is credited with reviving the home console market.[3]\n\nOne innovation that led to Nintendo's success was its ability to tell stories on an inexpensive home console; something that was more common for home computer games, but had only been seen on consoles in a limited fashion. Nintendo also took measures to prevent another crash by requiring third-party developers to adhere to regulations and standards, something that has existed on major consoles since then. One requirement was a \"lock and key\" system to prevent reverse engineering. It also forced third parties to pay in full for their cartridges before release, so that in case of a flop, the liability will be on the developer and not the provider.[27]\n\nNotable video-game franchises established in the 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nArcades\n\n[edit]\n\nConsoles and home computers\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes:\n\n1Game franchises that also accompany major film or television franchises.\n\n2Game franchises that are considered spin-offs of previously established franchises.\n\nFinancial performance\n\n[edit]\n\nHighest-grossing arcade games of the decade\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following titles were the highest-grossing arcade video games of each year in the 1980s, in terms of coin drop earnings.\n\nHighest-grossing arcade games of the 1980s Year Market Chart(s) Title Revenue Inflation Developer Manufacturer(s) Genre Ref 1980 Worldwide — Pac-Man $6 billion $19 billion Namco Namco / Midway Maze [28][29] 1981 1982 1983 Worldwide — Pole Position Un­known Namco Namco / Atari Racing [30] 1984 UK Un­known Track & Field Un­known Konami Konami Olympic sports [31] USA AMOA Pole Position Un­known Namco Atari Racing [32] RePlay Pole Position II Un­known Namco Atari Racing [33] 1985 UK Un­known Commando Un­known Capcom Capcom Run-and-gun [31] USA Play Meter Hang-On Un­known Sega Sega Racing [34] RePlay Karate Champ Un­known Technōs Data East Fighting [35] 1986 Japan Game Machine Hang-On Un­known Sega Sega Racing [36][37] UK Electrocoin (London) Nemesis (Gradius) Un­known Konami Konami Scrolling shooter [38] USA Play Meter Gauntlet Un­known Atari Games Atari Games Hack-and-slash [39] RePlay Hang-On Un­known Sega Sega Racing [40] 1987 Japan Gamest / Game Machine Out Run Un­known Sega Sega Driving [41][42] USA Play Meter Sega Sega Driving [43] 1988 Japan Gamest / Game Machine After Burner Un­known Sega Sega Air combat [44][45] Hong Kong Bondeal RoboCop Un­known Data East Data East Action [46] UK Un­known Operation Wolf Un­known Taito Taito Light gun shooter [47] USA Play Meter Double Dragon Un­known Technōs Taito Beat 'em up [48] 1989 Japan Dedicated cabinet Final Lap Un­known Namco Namco Racing [49] Conversion kit Tetris Un­known Sega Sega Puzzle [49][50] USA AMOA (dedicated) Double Dragon Un­known Technōs Taito Beat 'em up [51] AMOA (conversion kit) Capcom Bowling Un­known Strata Capcom Sports RePlay (dedicated) Super Off Road Un­known Leland Leland Racing [52] RePlay (conversion kit) Ninja Gaiden Un­known Tecmo Tecmo Beat 'em up\n\nBest-selling home video games of the decade\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists the top 20 best-selling home video games of the 1980s.
