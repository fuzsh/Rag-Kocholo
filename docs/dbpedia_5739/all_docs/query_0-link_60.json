        "text": "I've had this SNES since I was just a couple years old, and in fact it might be the single possession that's been with me the longest!\n\nAfter only occasional use the last few years and flirting with the prospect of selling, I figured I'd finally try to integrate it into my living room. Which brings me to the last week of my life...\n\nGod I love this era of video games.\n\nThere's a problem though.\n\nInput lag.\n\nPlugged into one of the early era smart LG TV's via A/V inputs, the amount of input lag made Super Metroid brutally difficult, and Super Mario World practically impossible. These are pretty twitchy games, where you need very fast responses to play fluidly.\n\nThe internet though—as it was designed to do—provides.\n\nApparently modern televisions are pretty bad at the whole input lag thing for various reasons, and there are a few websites that actually test this and share their findings. One of them mentioned putting the TV in game mode. Tried that, and it made a huge difference. Still not perfect, but at least playable.\n\nDo I go full hipster and look for an old CRT tube screen TV? Maybe someday. But for now this is good enough. Although when I do upgrade this old TV, I'll specifically be looking for something with less lag. I hear using an Hdmi converter can either help/hurt this problem, depending on the source. I've got one on the way, so... We'll see?\n\nThe current catalog is as follows\n\nSuper Mario World- which I've probably played more than any other game ever made (either that or Final Fantasy X)\n\nSuper Mario World: Return to Dino Island-Which is a custom rom hack on a physical cartridge, basically just Super Mario World with a new level designs.\n\nF-Zero- One of the rare marque franchises that Nintendo has left behind. The soundtrack was truly legendary.\n\nSuper Metroid Zero- another custom rom hack on a physical cartridge. Basically Metroid: Zero Mission ported to the Super Nintendo and made harder\n\nmuch harder. If you aren't a huge Metroid nerd you've got zero chance at this one. Requires some very specific skills that are never taught. Chaining shinesparks, anyone?\n\nI'll slowly be collecting all the JRPG's whenever they show up at reasonable prices. Beating myself up over selling Chrono Trigger a decade ago—damn game goes for almost four figures nowadays. Eventually I'd like to add a Nintendo 64 as well. I miss Mario 64 and Ocurina of Time. I'd say PS1/PS2 as well, but uh.... I don't have enough hours in the day to go down that rabbit hole. Way too many amazing games.\n\nBought some 3-D printed mounting hardware off Etsy to do a wall mount set-up, I think once I work out the final design it should look pretty good.\n\nAnyways... Reject modernity, embrace tradition! Where are the retro gamers at?!\n\n@AestheticsInMotion said in Super Nintendo musings:\n\nAnyways... Reject modernity, embrace tradition! Where are the retro gamers at?!\n\nThe absolute best way to experience SNES on a modern flat screen TV is the Analogue Super NT.\n\nAs it is an FPGA hardware clone, it perfectly replicates the original SNES hardware processing while also having native 1080p HDMI output, which means zero input lag to a new TV or monitor set to Gaming Mode. It can run roms OR original cartridges without issue, as far as I know ALL original SNES / Super Famicom cartridges work with it. It also has extensive tweaking options in the menu, and even has built-in cheat code input menu similar to a Game Genie for the original console. You can use almost all original SNES peripherals too, including controller multi taps, Super Gameboy, even the Super Scope light gun (if you have it hooked to a CRT).\n\nI am super happy with mine, I've had it since 2018, going on 4 years and it's been absolutely perfect. I actually gave my original SNES console to a friend because I don't think I'll ever use it again, since the Super NT does everything it can and more. I kept all my original cartridges and use them with it.\n\n@AestheticsInMotion I mean as much as appreciate the nostalgia of using the original system, emulators really are more than sufficient to enjoy the old games. Plus you get the added bonus of save states so you are not subject to the limitations of cartridges. I quite like modern controllers too and you can usually avoid the input lag by just connecting a computer via HDMI instead. I've got plenty of old Xbox controllers that hook up to a Windows PC without too much trouble and those are perfect for playing super Mario world.\n\nMy favorite SNES games that I still play occasionally are Donkey Kong Country 2, Self Defense Force, and Contra II. The latter two being Dark Souls level of difficult which is why I love them. I actually cannot beat them without save states so it makes it much more playable on an emulator."
