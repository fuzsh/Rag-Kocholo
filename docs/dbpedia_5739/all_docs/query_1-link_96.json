        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n3 Mexico was one such nation. For the United States the Cold War was a global struggle against communism as embodied by the totalitarian Soviet state. The United States government and a significant portion of its citizenry considered communism an evil force in the world, one that must be combated with all available ideological, military, and financial means. Mexicans, and Latin Americans in general, on the other hand took a much less critical view of communism and were less likely to associate all things communist with the Soviet Union. As a result, Mexicans viewed the Cold War not as a principled crusade, but as an example of aggression by imperialist states whose financial and military power allowed them to dominate less developed countries.\n\n6 In addition to heteroglossia, Bakhtin provides another concept useful for analyzing the Cold War in the Third World during the 1960s. Carnival or carnivalization involves the destabilization of the center, the normal, and the regular through the addition of multiple points of view. This concept illustrates the processes occurring in Mexico and throughout the Third World as countries began to contextualize the Cold War and learn how to exist, even succeed, within it. Their voices became part of the global policy discussions of the day. The resulting multivocal dialogue was at once destabilizing and complicating for the superpowers. Thus, in carnivalesque fashion, Mexico by the 1960s, had begun to reframe the Cold War not as a contest between communism and capitalism, but as a contest between the nations that were internationally dominant and those that were dominated. Taken together, heteroglossia and carnivalization posit a world in which Third World peoples appropriated the rhetoric, ideologies, and symbols of the Cold War for their own purposes. In doing so the multiplicity of texts within the Cold War context fractured the bipolarity the superpowers had worked so assiduously to maintain.\n\n7 In this environment where bipolarity had given way to conflicting discourses and an increasingly multivocal understanding of the Cold War, Mexicans began to view the Cold War, its combatants, and its battles through the lens of their own Revolution. That Revolution, as embodied in the 1960s by its institutionalization (the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional or PRI) and revolutionary nationalism, was an ongoing struggle between the government and the popular classes and their advocates for control of the national agenda. The Cold War became a primary discursive arena in which this struggle was waged in the 1960s. Most prominently in the watershed year 1968, when Mexico hosted the Olympic Games and experienced its most significant social protest movement in a generation, the conflicting discourses of the Cold War took center stage. This article seeks to identify those discourses and the points at which they influenced the events of 1968.\n\n2. The Influence of Communism\n\n12 The Cuban Revolution in 1959 and Fidel Castro’s conversion to communism shortly thereafter brought these issues to the forefront of Mexican political discourse.\n\n3. Politicization and Internationalization\n\n4. The Context of Mexican-US Relations\n\n23A third explanation of the convergence of revolutionary nationalism and the Cold War lies in the long history of Mexican relations with the United States. Looking at diplomacy, politicians on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border had long since recognized the importance and the complexity of the relationship between their two nations. With a shared colonial past and hard-fought struggles for national independence, the doctrine of pan-Americanism had found many adherents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in both countries. However, as the nature of Mexico’s dependent status relative to the United States became clear, and as Mexico became embroiled in a revolution in which that dependence would be a key issue, the relationship between the two neighbors became more complex. Perceived cordial relations with the United States became a political liability for Mexican officials at home but a virtual necessity abroad. Militarily, the United States dominated Mexico, the United States was Mexico’s most important trading partner, and a long history of cross-border migration left the populations and interests of the two nations inexorably intertwined.\n\n24 During the 1910 Revolution, anti-Americanism became a hallmark of Mexican nationalism when militants targeted United States and other foreign investments and new laws tightened the country’s hold on its natural resources and key industries. Expropriation of US-owned property, assertion of subsoil rights, and limitations on foreign ownership all framed foreign involvement in Mexico as a threat to revolutionary principles. The land and labor reforms so central to the revolutionary ideology of 1910 were substantively tied to anti-Americanism as post-Revolutionary governments took land from foreign owners and distributed it to the campesinos and as new labor laws protected workers from the exploitation they had previously suffered. It was also politically expedient for the new ruling party, which framed economic nationalism alongside land and labor reform as the third leg of the institutionalized revolution.\n\n26 As the students took on their government in 1968, the latter’s relationship with the United States was of central importance. Anti-Americanism had occupied a prominent place in Mexican revolutionary nationalism since the days of the Revolution itself, but that sentiment had ebbed and flowed throughout the intervening half century. Episodes like the oil expropriation in 1938 and the nationalization of the electrical grid in 1958 sparked groundswells of anti-Americanism, as did the Cuban Revolution, Bay of Pigs invasion, and death of Che Guevara. As the latter three items suggest, popular criticism of the United States, its policies, and all it represented was on the rise in the 1960s, and was quite visible in the 1968 student movement.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\n29While scholars provide far more eloquent explanations, the old cliché that all politics are local ultimately proves illusory. Mexicans viewed the events of the Cold War, internalized them, and came to understand them as related to their own history and particularly their revolution. The Cold War was an all-encompassing international ideology. The Mexican Revolution was an all-encompassing domestic ideology. Both were pervasive throughout politics, economics, society, and culture, becoming explanatory discourses in the process. Both provided legitimacy to their adherents and were delegitimizing for those in opposition.\n\n30 As President Diaz Ordaz and Mexico’s youth were locked in conflict to determine the meaning of that revolution and the character of the national agenda for the future, the Cold War was the arena in which they waged this battle. Three factors contributed to the centrality of the Cold War in 1968 Mexico. First, the juxtaposition of the aggressive anti-communist stance of the United States with the more tolerant and more fluid understanding of communism in Mexico made identifying communists a politically expedient move. In Mexico, politicos quickly learned that labeling an individual or group as communist was sure to raise suspicion and even contempt for them. Thus, when Diaz Ordaz was looking to discredit the student movement in 1968, labeling them as communist and raising the specter of a communist threat to the stability of Mexico seemed a likely way to win support from the United States, other members of the international community, and certain sectors of the Mexican population for repressing the students. Unfortunately for Diaz Ordaz however, the communist label did not produce the desired results. Few either at home or abroad took the threat seriously enough to act upon it. As it turned out, Diaz Ordaz was right about the global context, but wrong in assuming that this context could overcome the local text that rejected his notion of communist control of the student movement.\n\n31 The second factor, “the politicization and internationalization of everyday life” similarly brought the Cold War more prominently into Mexican politics. The filtering of national life to express its Cold War significance effectively carnivalized the Cold War by assigning so many issues a Cold War significance and thus bringing so many people into Cold War debates. Bipolarity gave way to a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints coming out of the Third World and demanding acknowledgement. In 1968 Mexico, the press played an integral role in this “politicization and internationalization” across the Mexican political landscape, most prominently on issues related to the student movement. The press, particularly that on the left, routinely framed the student rebellion and politics in general within the context of the Cold War.\n\n32 The third and final factor in making the Cold War a primary discursive arena for the contest between the students and the government was anti-Americanism. Mexico had a long history of anti-Americanism, the context of which had little to do with the Cold War prior to the 1950s. Thus, when the students marched in the streets carrying signs of Che Guevara or chanting Ho-Ho-Ho-Chi-Minh, theirs was not solely a display of solidarity with the peoples of Cuba and Vietnam, but rather a declaration of support for revolution, independence, and anti-imperialism. Neither did this represent acceptance of Soviet, Cuban, or Southeast Asian communism, but instead acceptance of Third World economic nationalism and national sovereignty. The youth were embracing anti-American symbols and in so doing, in 1968, in the height of the Cold War, elevating national issues to become international Cold War debates.\n\n33 These Mexican Cold War narratives included a position on communism which evolved throughout the decade, from the early 1960s when being labeled a communist was a political liability, to the late 1960s when governmental attempts to similarly label the student movement failed. These narratives also included a strong anti-American and anti-imperialist stance, both of which had their roots in Mexican revolutionary nationalism and the long history of United States-Mexican relations. In each of these cases, domestic, revolutionary ideologies became the lenses through which Cold War issues and events were filtered. More importantly, they became arenas in which Mexican nationalists and proponents of the institutionalized revolution could prove themselves. By 1968, this pattern was well established. The ideological impact of the Cold War had already become such a part of the Mexican political landscape when the student movement began that it was already inseparable from the events themselves.\n\n34 Mikhail Bakhtin provides us useful theoretical tools with which to come to an understanding of the integration of the Cold War into national life at all levels and with varying degrees of significance. The expansion of Cold War understanding and debate that such integration precipitated served to carnivalize the Cold War, transforming it from mere bipolarity into the complex cacophony of influences that it clearly was by 1968. Further, heteroglossia serves to bridge the analytical gap between the macro and micro-level workings of the Cold War, between the overarching ideologies and agendas and the everyday events and attitudes. We know 1968 changed nations as well as the international milieu in which nations operated. We know that 1968’s legacy is at once profound and nebulous. This application of theory to the events of 1968 in one country is meant to serve as an example of how research that seeks to integrate the national and the international, the ideological and the practical might be undertaken. The three issues in the Mexican case (the different understandings of communism, the convergence of the everyday and the local with the significant and the global, and the impact of long-standing pre-Cold War factors) serve as points of departure for further research. In this way a truly global understanding of a watershed year like 1968 may be gradually put together.\n\nJulia Sloan, Assistant Professor of Social Science / History, Cazenovia College, Cazenovia, NY"
