Global Play is available for all our games except for World of Warcraft.\n\nThe three play regions are:\n\nAmericas for players in North America, Latin America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nEurope for players in the European Union, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nAsia for players in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.\n\nTo switch between Play Regions, click the globe icon dropdown button next to the Play button.\n\nHelp Me Decide\n\nYour game progress is tied to your Play Region, and isn't shared across regions. By default, you will play in your home region, which is determined by your country of residence. Choosing to play in a different region may negatively affect your connection to our servers.\n\nWhen your client patches, you will be locked out of any other regions that have not yet received that patch. Once those regions undergo maintenance and patch as well, you will be able to play in those regions."
