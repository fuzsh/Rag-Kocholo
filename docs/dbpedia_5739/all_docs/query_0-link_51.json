        "text": "Common Era First Millennium\n\nCastle Camelot\n\nThe final years of the Eastern Han dynasty saw China fall into civil war, with the three kingdoms of Wu, Shu and Wei fighting for control of the country. With flashy spear combat and magic (Dynasty Warriors)\n\nMeanwhile Europe got a bit medieval and King Arthur ruled over Britain... until he and the Knights of the Round Table were trapped in the Cave of Glass by Queen Morgana. Fortunately the wizard Merlin was able to transport the New York Knights football team back in time to replace them (King Arthur & The Knights of Justice). 200ish Dynasty Warriors 8\n\nDynasty Warriors Advance 500ish King Arthur & The Knights of Justice 500 Legends (England level) 560 Daikatana (Dark Ages Norway) 600 Chrono Trigger 11th Century\n\nExciting political things happening, probably\n\nThe unification of Scotland and the Norman conquest of England in 1066 brought them further into European feudal politics. That's when things really got interesting... if you're any good at Crusader Kings II anyway.\n\nThis is also Chrono Trigger's present day era, and it strays a bit from Earth history here by having teleporter technology and time travel. 1000 Chrono Trigger 1066 Crusader Kings II 15th Century\n\nA nightclub in 15th century North America\n\nThe 15th century was the beginning of the European colonisation of the Americas and the start of the Spanish Inquisition, but more importantly it was the first time that Count Dracula got a stake through his heart due to a member of the Belmont Clan.\n\n26 years later he came back and got staked by another Belmont. It became a bit of a pattern for him after that. 1400 Legends (America level) 1450 Castlevania Legends 1476 Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse 16th Century\n\nMichelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel\n\nThe 16th century was the time of the Spanish Armada, the start of the European Renaissance, and a good time for artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo DaVinci. This is when the Mona Lisa was painted and the Sistine Chapel got its ceiling decorated. The 1500s also featured the creation of the world's first theme park.\n\nBut the games I played set during this century were all about Belmonts whipping Dracula. 1576 Castlevania: The Adventure\n\nCastlevania II: Belmont's Revenge 17th Century\n\nCount Dracula ruining Simon Belmont's wedding\n\n1691 was a busy year for Dracula, as he got defeated by Simon Belmont in like five different realities. Then a few years later Simon put his pieces back together and killed him again. It didn't stick. 1691 Castlevania\n\nVampire Killer\n\nCastlevania Chronicles\n\nHaunted Castle\n\nSuper Castlevania IV 1698 Castlevania II: Simon's Quest 18th Century\n\nA typical pirate bar from the 18th century\n\nThe Golden Age of Piracy spanned the 1650s to the late 1720s, so pirate games like The Secret of Monkey Island and Claw fit in around here. This was when the legendary buccaneer Guybrush Threepwood faced off against the ghost/zombie/demon pirate LeChuck and found the treasure of Big Whoop. Europe had demons of its own during the Industrial Revolution, and much of England was wiped out by them in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, while Dracula was being killed again by Richter Belmont and his own son Alucard.\n\nThere was also a bit of tension between America and Britain at the time, leading to the War of Independence in 1775. Soon after, founding fathers like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin drafted the US Constitution, with help from time travelling roadie Hoagie (depicted in Day of the Tentacle).\n\nIt's also possible that Zorro takes place here but who knows? 1780s Day of the Tentacle (past) 1792 Castlevania: Rondo of Blood\n\nCastlevania: Dracula X 1794 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein 1797 Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 19th Century\n\nA typical cowboy saloon from the 19th century\n\nIn 1861 the United States fell into civil war, leading to the era of the cowboy game. Wild West stories typically take place between the 1860s and 1890s so Outlaws, Lucky Luke and Tequila & Boom-Boom should probably go here. Not Tin Star and Wild Guns though, on account of all the robots.\n\n1865 was the beginning of Japan's Keiō era, when a 3000 year old super intelligent super villain schemed to turn the planet into a racoon world with ancient alien technology, and was stopped by a warrior with a dragon and a bunny girl costume.\n\nMeanwhile Victorian England reached its steampunk era, which featured big hats, shiny metal gadgets, and a Chaos Engine corrupting space and time. Also Dracula came back again. This time there wasn't a Belmont around to sort him out though, so Keanu Reeves had to go on a mission to rid Europe of vampires by kicking them to death in their coffins.\n\n1840 Lost in Time (past) 1848 The Oregon Trail 1872 Keio Flying Squadron 1873 Keio Flying Squadron 2 Late 1800s The Chaos Engine\n\n1890s Dracula the Undead 1897 Bram Stoker's Dracula 20th Century 1910s\n\nI didn't write about History Line, but the intro jumped straight into my mind so I'm using this shot anyway.\n\nUnfortunately Dracula's niece escaped Keanu Reeves' holy boot and orchestrated the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand to spark World War I in a scheme to resurrect her uncle. 1917 Castlevania: Bloodlines 1920s\n\nAn Elvira calendar from 1928\n\nThe 1920s was a decade of Art Deco and jazz, of electrical appliances and motion pictures. It was also a decade of paranormal gunfighting, with Patrick Galloway taking care of his friend's family curse and Caleb getting revenge against the dark god Tchernobog. 1923 Clive Barker's Undying 1928 Blood 1930s\n\nA typical American street in the 30s\n\nAmerica banned alcohol in 1920 and this prohibition continued until 1933, making the 30s a good time for gangster games like The Untouchables and Mafia. Plus the decade had the perfect aesthetic for hard-boiled private detectives like Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade and Jack Orlando.\n\nThe 1930s was also a time of movie serial heroes like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, so it makes sense that this is where you'll find Indiana Jones and his imitators like Earnest Evans. 1930 Mafia 1938 The Rocketeer\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade 1939 Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis 1940s\n\nRussian soldiers throwing potatoes at a German prisoner in Moscow, 1941\n\nThe 30s ended with Nazi Germany invading Poland, making the 40s the decade of World War II. An alliance of nations fought against the Nazi regime in games like Medal of Honor and Commandos, facing off against their super science and the occult. US Army Ranger B.J. Blazkowicz defeated Hitler after shattering his mech suit, but the war continued and Blazkowicz eventually suffered a head injury that left him lying in a coma as the Nazis ultimately conquered the world.\n\nMeanwhile construction began on the underwater city of Rapture.\n\n1940 The Saboteur 1941 1942 Wolfenstein 3D\n\nCall of Duty 2 1943 Return to Castle Wolfenstein 1944 Call of Duty\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nMedal of Honor: Allied Assault\n\nWalker (Berlin stage) 1945 Rick Dangerous 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950s\n\nThe aftermath of Rapture's New Year's 1959 celebration\n\nRapture was completed in 1951 and hundreds of people disappeared around the world as they were secretly invited to move into Andrew Ryan's objectivist paradise. By New Year's Eve 1958 the city had fell into civil war, accelerating the population's decline into insanity as they altered their own DNA to give themselves combat magic (BioShock).\n\nAlso Marty McFly returned to 1955 Hill Valley to prevent Biff Tannen's manipulation of the timeline.\n\n1953 The Clue! 1955 Super Back to the Future, Part II (past)\n\n1960s\n\nA delicious and balanced maple flavour CalorieMate meal, from 1964* (*not actually introduced until 1995)\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the world was split into two - East and West. This marked the beginning of the era called the Cold War. That means that the 60s were a decade of spy action, with B.J. Blazkowicz back in action, along with Naked Snake, Cate Archer and James Bond.\n\nThe 60s were also a time of great technological progress, as nations and terrorist groups began manned space missions, with H.A.R.M. constructing a space station and the Nazis constructing a base on the moon. Giant mechs also became a concern, as the German resistance fought back against Deathshead's mechanical nightmares in Europe, while CIA unit FOX fought to stop Colonel Volgin's Shagohod project in Russia.\n\n1960 BioShock\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order\n\n1961 1962 1963 1964 Goldfinger\n\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater 1965 1966 1967 The Operative: No One Lives Forever 1968 Contract J.A.C.K.\n\nNo One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way 1969 1970s\n\nA 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T\n\nThe spies were still busy during the 70s, with James Bond ending up in a blaxploitation movie and Naked Snake starting up his own PMC. Not much going on with the city of Rapture this decade, but another rich megalomaniac called Stromberg planned to create his own underwater civilisation. His plan ran into some pushback from the British and Soviet governments however, when he attempted to destroy the rest of humanity (The Spy Who Loved Me). 1970 1971 1972 1973 Live and Let Die 1974 Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker 1975 1976 1977 The Spy Who Loved Me 1978 1979 1980s\n\nArcade graphics from the year 198X\n\nThe 80s featured humanity's first contact with a race of E.T.s in the California suburbs. A year later, a deep space mission encountered another kind of alien, with... dramatic consequences (Spirits of Xanadu).\n\nThe world also saw a major increase in the use of time travel, with Doctor Emmett Brown inventing a time travelling DeLorean, Bill & Ted borrowing historical figures for their history report, and the Terminator dropping by to kill Sarah Connor.\n\nThe decade ended with John McClane resolving a hostage situation at Nakatomi Plaza, a new bat-themed vigilante preventing a clown from poisoning Gotham City, and Tokyo being obliterated by a psychic singularity.\n\n198X also takes place this decade but it's vague on exactly when (it has to be right at the end though, with those graphics). 1980 1981 1982 E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial 1983 Spirits of Xanadu 1984 Beverly Hills Cop\n\nThe Terminator games present day 1985 Super Back to the Future, Part II (present day)\n\nA View to a Kill 1986 Shenmue\n\nGoldenEye 007 (dam mission) 1987 The Living Daylights 1988 Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\n\nDie Hard\n\nDie Hard: Nakatomi Plaza 1989 Batman\n\nHotline Miami\n\nLicence to Kill 1990s\n\nThe 90s\n\nThings got a lot busier in the 90s (mostly because it was the 'present day' for all the video games that came out that decade).\n\nThe decade started with the Gulf War, and the Desert Strike crew soon returned to the Gulf to stop another dictator. Meanwhile FOXHOUND carried out operations in Outer Heaven and Zanzibar Land to tackle the rising problem of walking battle tanks.\n\nZombies were also a real problem this decade due to the Umbrella Corporation's experiments with the t-Virus, and there was a sharp rise in dinosaur attacks due to the InGen Corporation filling two islands with the creatures. Alien attacks also increased dramatically, with the space pirate Scab trying to steal the FIFA World Cup in 1994 (Soccer Kid), and at least two separate invasions in 1999 (Banshee and UFO).\n\nThe other major concern facing humanity in the 90s was near complete annihilation, with a biological weapon wiping out much of the world's population (Snatcher), and devastating global nuclear wars in 1997 (Terminator 2), 1998 (Wasteland) and 1999 (Buck Rogers). Even Chrono Trigger's world got to join in the fun as the alien space parasite Lavos emerged and sprayed explosive spines across into the air to destroy civilisation. 1990 Die Hard 2: Die Harder 1991 GoldenEye 007 (Severnaya mission)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 1992 F1 ROC: Race of Champions\n\nLost in Time (present day) 1993 GoldenEye 007 (Kyrgyzstan mission)\n\nJurassic Park\n\nTime Trax (past)\n\nWalker (Middle East stage) 1994 Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers\n\nSoccer Kid 1995 Gargoyles\n\nGoldenEye 007 (main story)\n\nMetal Gear\n\nThe Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery\n\nTerminator: Future Shock\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day 1996 Demolition Man (prologue)\n\nRise of the Triad: Dark War (\"One year in the future.\")\n\nTomb Raider 1997 Deadline\n\nParasite Eve\n\nTomorrow Never Dies 1998 Jurassic Park: Trespasser\n\nSnake's Revenge\n\nResident Evil\n\nResident Evil 2 1999 Banshee\n\nChrono Trigger (Day of Lavos)\n\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake\n\nThe World is Not Enough\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six\n\nUFO: Enemy Unknown 21st Century 2000s\n\nStylish gang violence in 2008\n\nHumanity survived the turn of the millennium, but the US now faced a new threat: gang violence. Cities like Liberty City and Stilwater became a warzone, with gangsters carrying out brutal crimes while performing extreme stunts in stolen cars.\n\nThe world was also invaded by aliens again, in 2000 (Hybrid Heaven), 2007 (Duke Nukem 3D), 2009 (Incoming), and whenever Half-Life takes place.\n\nMega Man is set in 200X, so the game takes place during this decade as well. Metroid is set in 20X5, but that's CC (Cosmic Calendar), not AD, so it might take place ten thousand years from now for all we know. 2000 Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nHybrid Heaven 2001 Max Payne\n\n2002 Medal of Honor (2010) 2003 Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne 2004 Immercenary (present day) 2005 Constantine\n\nForbidden Siren 2\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2006 Saints Row 2007 Duke Nukem 3D (according to the calendars).\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (Tanker chapter)\n\nOutcast 2008 Grand Theft Auto IV\n\nSaints Row 2 (but it's somehow also set five years after the first game). 2009 Incoming\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (Plant chapter)\n\nResident Evil 5 2010s\n\nCivilization had progressed little in the last 20 years\n\nIn 2010 a new virus called VITAS was discovered, which went on to destroy a quarter of the world's population. A year later, the return of magic to the world led to the Year of Chaos, where human mothers began to give birth to elves and dwarfs, and dragons began to awaken. This began the era of the Sixth World (Shadowrun).\n\nAlien invasions continued to be a recurring problem for humanity throughout the 2010s, plus Tokyo exploded again and by 2012 the Earth was in ruins due to yet another apocalypse.\n\nReally Max Payne's life didn't seem all that bad by comparison, even though he did have to personally put a bullet into practically every street criminal, outlaw paramilitary unit, and corrupt cop in São Paulo. 2010 2010: The Graphic Action Game\n\nThe Firemen 2011 Saints Row: The Third 2012 Max Payne 3\n\nRogue Trip: Vacation 2012 - An easy one.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl 2013 Saints Row IV (also somehow at least five years after the third game). 2014 Battlefield 3\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth 2015 Super Back to the Future, Part II (future).\n\nTerminator: Future Shock\n\nThe Peace Keepers\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown 2016 2017 Giant Machines 2017 - Another easy one. 2018 SeaQuest DSV 2019 Akira\n\nBlade Runner\n\nDuke Nukem Forever (12 years after Duke Nukem 3D).\n\nShock Wave: Invasion Earth 2019\n\nWalker (Los Angeles stage) 2020s\n\nDetroit, 2027\n\nHey, this is where we are! Half-Life 2 also takes place somewhere around here, which means yet another alien invasion/apocalypse. 2026 also saw the beginning of World War III, which ultimately killed 600,000,000 humans and left most major cities in rubble (Star Trek). By 2028 solar flares had ruined the planet's atmosphere, turning 80% of the surviving population into zombies (Carmageddon). Things got even worse on August 23, 2029, when the asteroid 99942 Apophis collided with Earth, destroying human civilization once again (Rage).\n\nThis was also the decade that VR really started to take off, with all humanity becoming enslaved inside an MMO that looks like a 3DO game by 2027 (Immercenary). Cybernetic augmentation also took off in a big way, with humanity being split between the wealthy and fortunate who had been enhanced and those who hadn't, despite the surgery leading to a dependency on an immunosuppressive drug. The corporations grew in power and by the end of the decade the US police force was scrapped due to corruption, with private security forces taking their place (SiN). 2020 Time Commando (it's all VR, so despite the time travel you never really leave this time period). 2027 Deus Ex: The Fall\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\n\nImmercenary (VR world) 2028 Blood II: The Chosen\n\nCarmageddon (censored version)\n\nMetal Slug: Super Vehicle-001\n\n2029 Skynet future in Terminator games like Terminator 2029 2030s\n\nPolice precinct and museum in 2032\n\nBy the 2030s, Earth was a paradise, with the last of our weapons stored in museums or sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Barbara merged as one giant city called San Angeles, and creation engines were developed to create matter for free (Demolition Man and Hostile Waters).\n\n2030 Daikatana (near-future San Francisco) 2032 Demolition Man\n\nHostile Waters: Antaeus Rising 2037 SiN 2040s\n\n5-inch floppy disks were obsolete by 2046\n\nIn 2040 the Earth's ecosystem lay in ruins due to environmental disasters and the Resource Wars, with the the majority of humanity living off scavenged trash under the towers of the elite (Phantom 2040). A year later, in 2041, a Chaos Dunk tragedy at a basketball game in post-cyberpocalyptic Neo New York led to the sport being outlawed, and its players hunted and killed (Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden).\n\nBy 2042 all resource problems had been solved, war had been abolished (again), and a process had been developed to use water as fuel (Consortium). Human society became almost entirely governed by robots servants (Rise of the Robots), but Neo Kobe City suffered from a series of murders, with robots killing humans and wearing their skin as a disguise (Snatcher). There was also a rise in digital drug addiction, with people entering a simulated matrix reality using 'Tek'.\n\nIn 2049 the entire population left its home planet to colonise other worlds, with the robots left behind to clean up all the pollution. One of the robots accidentally had his head replaced by a nuclear missile and became the new insane evil ruler of Earth (VectorMan). 2040 Phantom 2040 2042 Consortium 2043 Rise of the Robots\n\nUndercover Cops 2044 Crash 'n Burn 2045 TekWar: The Game 2046 Snatcher 2050s\n\nBasketball violence in 2053\n\nBy the 2050s human civilisation was in decline. The gap between the rich and poor had only increased and a lethal pandemic called the Gray Death spread across the globe (Deus Ex).\n\nIn 2053 another Chaos Dunk occurred in Manhattan, now part of a sprawling metropolis known as Mega-City One (Judge Dredd), with a death toll in the millions. It was followed by a devastating nuclear strike that finally brought World War III to an end (Star Trek). Nuclear war had left most of the Earth uninhabitable by 2055, so humanity moved out to form two colonies in the Alpha Centauri system, Vekta and Helghan (Killzone).\n\nBut the Earth was rebuilt and megacorporations seized power (Shadowrun). Several factions gained influence as humanity fell into war and economic depression during a period known as the 'Collapse' (Deus Ex)\n\n2050 Johnny Bazookatone\n\nShadowrun (SNES) 2052 Deus Ex 2053 Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden 2055 Virtuoso 2056 Kabuki: Quantum Fighter 2058 Shadowrun (Mega Drive) 2060s\n\nBarrier City #42, 2065\n\nBy the 2060s the Earth was in ruins due to an alien invasion. The last survivors of humanity found refuge within cities protected by energy shields that prevented the alien ghosts from getting inside (Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within), or within domed communities sitting on pillars far above the clouds (The Jetsons).\n\n2062 The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates 2065 Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (not a game, but I wrote about it anyway.) 2069 Electrocop 2070s\n\nNuclear detonation near Boston, 2077\n\nMuch of humanity now lived in walled city states on Earth, while the miners working on Mars suffered in terrible conditions. In 2072 Chicago was reduced to grey goo by a nanite bomb, three years later the Martian miners fought back against the Ultor Corporation, and on October 23, 2077 human civilisation was wiped out once more by another global nuclear war (Fallout)\n\n2072 Deus Ex: Invisible War 2075 Red Faction 2077 Fallout 4 (prologue) 2080s\n\nSomehow life continued in the wasteland\n\nA digital plague known as the nanophage spread across Poland, killing thousands, and a megacorporation seized power again (Observer). Meanwhile the rebellion on Mars continued and construction worker Douglas Quaid travelled there to solve the mystery of his own obsession with the planet (Total Recall).\n\n2080 Red Faction II 2084 Observer\n\nTotal Recall 2087 Wasteland 2090s\n\nEuropean cyberpunk metropolis in 85 NC (New Calendar)\n\nThe world had fallen further into dystopia, with most nations now under the control of corporations who fought for dominance with cybernetically augmented agents (Syndicate). Many people were implanted with a 'CHIP' to alter their perception of reality and make them more susceptible to manipulation and less likely to rebel against the misery and poverty they live in. Meanwhile the US fell under control of a fascist theocracy called the 'Hand of God' that banned cybernetics and virtual reality (Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller).\n\nAlso human-assisted robot (HAR) fights really took off as a sport in this decade (One Must Fall: 2097), along with hover racing and Speedball (Speedball). 2095 Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller 2096 Syndicate 2097 One Must Fall: 2097\n\nI'm fairly sure Wipeout 2097 would go here if I'd played it too. 2098 Future Cop: L.A.P.D. 2099 Down Load Far Future 22nd Century\n\nSpace racism in 2183\n\n22nd century Earth was a harsh place, with much of the United States now a barren wasteland (Wasteland 2, Rage, Fallout). People survived in underground vaults and giant Mega-Cities (Judge Dredd) and much of humanity was now kept as pets by the ruling race of tentacles (Day of the Tentacle) or the sadistic computer AM (I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream)\n\nSpace travel became common in this era and many discoveries were made. New species of aliens were discovered by the starship Von Braun (System Shock 2) and the crew of the Nostromo (Alien), while scientists on Mars discovered an alien outpost (Mass Effect) and a gateway to Hell (Doom 3). Meanwhile Conrad B. Hart discovered that shapeshifting aliens had infiltrated society and were planning to conquer the human race and Commander Shepard discovered that the Reapers were coming to reap the advanced cultures of the galaxy.\n\nA united humanity eventually proved its worth to the other powers in the galaxy and in 2161 they earned their place on the council of the newly created United Federation of Planets (Star Trek). Meanwhile the Solar System was in the grip of a fierce civil war between the Alliance and the Coalition. Realising that they weren't going to win, five sleeper ships escaped to start new colonies in the Sirius Sector (Freelancer), while the Andromeda Initiative headed out to a new galaxy in six arks (Mass Effect).\n\nMega Man X4 also takes place during this century as it's set in 21XX, but they're weirdly sketchy on the specific year. 2100ish I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream 2102 Wasteland 2 2105 Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe 2112 Donk! The Samurai Duck 2114 System Shock 2 2129 Time Slip 2134 Judge Dredd (Arcade) 2135 Rage 2137 Alien: Isolation 2142 Flashback 2145 Doom 3 2149 Radix: Beyond the Void 2161 Fallout 2165 Rage 2 2179 Alien Trilogy\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines 2183 Mass Effect 2185 Mass Effect 2 2186 Mass Effect 3 2190s Day of the Tentacle (future)\n\n2193 Time Trax (present day) 2197 Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Final years Chrome\n\n23rd Century\n\nThe bridge of a Constitution-class starship in the 2260s\n\nThe 23rd century began with colonists on the Moon working to reclaim the Earth after a 20 trillion ton asteroid collided with it, wiping out civilisation (Millennium 2.2). Scattered communities fought to survive in the ruins, with a New California Republic forming in the western side of what used to be the United States (Fallout 2).\n\nEarth had to fight off two alien races during this century, the Strogg and the Daleks, but they were victorious and humanity entered a new post-post-post-apocalyptic golden age. Captain Kirk took command of the USS Enterprise in 2265 and began a five year mission of space exploration and sci-fi adventures. 2200 Millennium 2.2 2230 Malice 2241 Fallout 2 2246 Quake 2\n\nQuake 4 2251 Unreal II: The Awakening 2254 Doctor Who: Dalek Attack 2260s Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (NES)\n\nStar Trek: 25th Anniversary (PC) 2277 Fallout 3 2281 Fallout: New Vegas 2287 Fallout 4 2288 Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Starship Bridge Simulator 24th Century\n\nThe bridge of a Galaxy-class starship in 2370\n\nThe 24th century was a time of trouble for Earth's colonies, as the Halcyon system came close to collapse due to extreme capitalism (The Outer Worlds), while Helghan forces attacked Vekta (Killzone). Maris also had its problems, as the Nohzas civilisation decided it would be a nice place to lay their eggs... as soon as all the humans were killed (Zillion).\n\nEarth, on the other hand, had been at peace so long that humanity had lost the instinct to fight. The government was obviously concerned about this, so they developed a video game to turn people violent again. Unfortunately the simulation went and captured people instead, holding them as hostages (Gain Ground).\n\nStarfleet was up to its sixth USS Enterprise at this point, under the command of Captain Picard, but it was a golden age for the Federation. At least it was until the Borg invaded and took on their fleet near the star Wolf 359. 2300 Chrono Trigger (bad future) 2348 Gain Ground 2355 The Outer Worlds 2357 Killzone 2360s Star Trek: The Next Generation - Echoes from the Past 2367 Star Trek: Borg 2369 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Crossroads of Time 2370 Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity 2374 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen 2376 Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force 2377 Star Trek: Borg (prologue)\n\nStar Trek: Bridge Commander 2380 Star Trek: Elite Force II 2387 Zillion 25th Century\n\nThe 25th century was all-action\n\nThe 25th century is famously when space hero Buck Rogers came out of hibernation (a whole 50 years after Duck Dodgers). Earth at this point was under the totalitarian rule of Kage Mishima, who maintained control by holding both the only cure to a plague and also a magic time-travelling sword (Daikatana).\n\nEarth suffered the Great War in this century, where countless little dudes were slaughtered by a mech with infinite ammo (Walker). This was possibly the same World War XVII that devastated many of Earth's colonies across the galaxy (Top Gear 3000). Meanwhile the mining planet of Hillys was under siege by alien invaders called the DomZ, and under control of an apparently benevolent military force called the Alpha Sections (Beyond Good & Evil).\n\n2412 Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter 2420 Walker (Great War stage) 2435 Beyond Good & Evil 2455 Daikatana (present day) 2456 Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday is set some point after this year. 26th Century\n\nSexy naked hologram technology, from 2552\n\nAt some point around the year 2530, an alien alliance known as the Covenant decided that humanity was an affront to their gods and declared a holy war against Earth. By 2552 humanity was still holding on (it helped that the aliens didn't know where Earth was), but a devastating attack on the colony world Reach sent the starship Pillar of Autumn running straight into a mysterious ancient ringworld structure (Halo: Combat Evolved). Meanwhile drunken space captain Grayson Hunt drove his vessel straight into the battleship Ulysses (partly out of revenge, partly because he was really drunk) (Bulletstorm).\n\nEarth had its own problems this century, due to a self-replicating AI with ambitions to replace the human race. Fortunately the scientists made sure that a psychokinetic boy had the key to destroy her (Galerians). 2552 Halo: Combat Evolved 27th Century In the distant future, mankind was locked in a deadly war with a race of space cats called the Kzinti Kilrathi. An ace space pilot assigned to the Confederation carrier TCS Tiger's Claw called Christopher Blair was instrumental in shooting lots of them down (Wing Commander).\n\nBy 2688, humanity had achieved a utopia again, due to a really good song by two 20th century musicians: Bill S. Preston, Esq., and Ted \"Theodore\" Logan.\n\n2634 Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces (Super Contra) 2654 Wing Commander 28th Century Marathon takes place in 2794 and Terminal Velocity is set in 2704, but I never actually played them myself so I can't say anything about the 28th Century. Sorry. 29th Century This is where Mass Effect: Andromeda would go if I'd written about it, with the ark Hyperion arriving in the Helios cluster in 2819. Marathon 2 is set in 2811 but I haven't played that either. 30th Century\n\nPlanet Leeds, Leeds System, 2960s\n\n800 years after the civil war that drove them to flee Earth's solar system, the colonies started by the Alliance sleeper ships had formed colonies of their own (Freelancer).\n\nMeanwhile outlaw thrill seekers, starved of fun by the Bureau of Reasonable Entertainment's suppression of anything too exciting, had a once-in-a-millennium chance to join a car race through the twelve star systems of the Galactic Conglomerate of Unified Planets in 2962. I suppose it was also the first chance anyone had gotten to join the race, unless there was intergalactic racing tournament held in 1962 (Top Gear 3000).\n\n2960ish Freelancer 2962 Top Gear 3000 31st Century Turrican II is set in the year 3025, so it seems plausible that Turrican takes place around here as well. Then again, after reading about their stories I'm not sure they're even set in the same reality\n\nThe MechWarrior games definitely take place during this century, as one of them's called MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat. It was a time of high adventure, apparently, and an age of war unlike any before and since. Maybe because everyone fighting was either in giant robots or robot suits.\n\n3024 MechWarrior 40th Century I thought the Turrican and Mechwarrior games were going to win this, but then I discovered that Rex Blade takes place in 3900. That's the 40th century! This is the furthest into the future that Super Adventures has ever travelled, as far as I'm aware.\n\nThough maybe I'm wrong about that! If I am, let me know."
