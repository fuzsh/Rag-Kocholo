        "text": "When choosing appropriate video games for your child, you can use age ratings to help you.\n\nFrom rating systems like PEGI and ESRB to those in app stores, this guide breaks down what it all means.\n\nIt’s important to pay attention to the age minimums for the video games your child plays. However, there is sometimes contradicting information. For example, Clash of Clans is rated Everyone 10+ on the Google Play app, 7 through the PEGI rating system and for 13+ by Supercell which created the game.\n\nTherefore, when choosing a video game for your child, it’s important to:\n\nreview age ratings;\n\nread up on why they have those age ratings;\n\nconsider your child’s maturity level and development.\n\nBelow, you can explore the main age ratings and their content warnings to help you make an informed choice on video games."
