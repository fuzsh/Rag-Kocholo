        "text": "85% of U.S. teens say they play video games. They see both positive and negative sides, from making friends to harassment and sleep loss.\n\nToday, nearly all U.S. teens (96%) say they use the internet every day. And the share of teens who report being online “almost constantly” has roughly doubled since 2014-2015 (24% vs. 46%).\n\nThree-quarters of U.S. adults who have recently faced some kind of online harassment say it happened on social media.\n\nTwo-thirds of parents in the U.S. say parenting is harder today than it was 20 years ago, with many citing technologies – like social media or smartphones – as a reason.\n\nOverall, 43% of U.S. adults say they often or sometimes play video games. Gaming is popular among teens – especially teenage boys.\n\nIn the U.S., four-in-ten women and roughly a quarter of adults ages 65 and older say they play video games at least sometimes.\n\nNearly a quarter of Americans say they’ve earned money in the digital “platform economy” in the past year, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Perhaps surprisingly, though, the most commonly cited motivation for these workers is not the pay.\n\nHispanics are more likely than whites or blacks to categorize themselves as gamers.\n\nAmericans’ attitudes toward games – and the people who play them – are complex and often uncertain."
