        "text": "1\n\nOnlyItsMeReid\n\nI’m really surprised, football is huge here and with all the games on the Eshop you would expect more\n\n2\n\nanextphilosophy\n\nYou’d think someone would want to port some sports games over to the switch just because a halfway decent one would corner the market\n\n3\n\nGrailUK\n\nMy favourite American Football game is Madden 92 on the Megadrive. Added enough on to the original to make it meaninful and 93 onwards started to do too much. (And the theme tune!!!) Randall Cunningham was injured A LOT lol. I would be happy if this miraculously turned up somehow. But alas, EA don't see their IP as just video games.\n\n4\n\nScreen\n\nRetro Bowl is coming so that can be the 5th entry.\n\n5\n\nPat_trick\n\nNothing will ever be as good as Madden 08!\n\n6\n\nJayJ\n\nI actually love Mutant Football League, I thought I wouldn't but I had a blast playing that game and actually played through an entire season. It's sorta like NFL Blitz, but with the cartoonish violence cranked up a notch. Makes for a very fun game.\n\n7\n\nJasmineDragon\n\nI'm honestly not that surprised. This came up a few months ago when we were talking about some cricket game - American football has significantly fewer fans than soccer and cricket do. Like, half a billion fewer. Of course it's a huge deal in the States, but it's not even in the top ten sports worldwide.\n\nPersonally I find almost all sports hella boring, so I'm playing Steredenn for Thanksgiving.\n\n8\n\nSmaggTheSmug\n\nI am just waiting for Blood Bowl.\n\n9\n\ntamantayoshi\n\nBears fan here too, Bear down!!\n\n10\n\nDman10\n\nShame how there’s no Madden or NHL on Switch. Not even NHL 94 Rewind, come on EA, make it happen.\n\n11\n\ntheGamerPad\n\n@Screen 6th\n\n12\n\nTasuki\n\nMutant Football League does allow you to turn off the extreme hits and field hazards, once you do that it plays just as well as a Madden game.\n\n13\n\nScreen\n\n@theGamerPad\n\nUnless they want to count both versions of Tecmo Bowl as one.\n\n14\n\nFixMadden22\n\n@JasmineDragon One of the reasons for that is madden has the exclusive nfl rights for \"simulation\" football games. So madden has a monopoly on the american football game market. (which makes it even more baffling that it is not on switch)\n\n15\n\nadh56\n\n@JasmineDragon okay so being American and hearing you say Cricket is more popular then (American) Football blows my mind. Could that possibly be true?\n\nAs for Soccer I can and do understand that is immensely popular worldwide, but here in the states it’s well behind Football, Baseball and Basketball. I’m my mind here in the states it’s also behind hockey, my favorite, but I could be wrong on that one. Cricket isn’t even a thing over here except for maybe some kind of country club lifestyle thing like Polo.\n\n16\n\nRushDawg\n\nFeels like there's a huge opportunity for a developer to create a solid, simulation-style football game for the Switch.\n\n17\n\nMystique\n\n@Pat_trick I would buy a copy but Scott the woz has all of them\n\n18\n\nDeerock69\n\nWhy doesn't 2K release their football game without the NFL license? Maybe put XFL in there, instead.\n\n19\n\nFlashmanHarry\n\n@adh56 Cricket is huge in a lot of Asian countries like India and Pakistan so that brings its numbers up.\n\n20\n\nValZ\n\nWhat's so surprising? It's not that bad. Unless you aren't a sports fan, editor, but that's not a bad thing.\n\n21\n\nxDeckardx\n\nNow if we could just get a Blood Bowl game on Switch...\n\n22\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\n@JasmineDragon Keep in mind that Canada plays a very similar football game (with just a few notable rule changes like a longer field and only 3 downs per series) and their own professional league, although that's still just 2 countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Cricket may top American/Canadian football, but it isn't that popular worldwide, since it has basically zero presence in countries where baseball is popular instead (United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, Cuba, much of the rest of the Caribbean, Venezuela, South Korea, Japan, etc.).\n\n23\n\nCovidBarbie\n\nSports games don't interest me so I will not be purchasing any of these.\n\n24\n\nCovidBarbie\n\nLittle Bug looks interesting, but my mind is firmly set on Pokemon for the time being.\n\n25\n\nmattesdude\n\nI’m not really a sports game fan…or even sports in general. But I do like a game of Mutant League Football every once in a while. I think it’s fun…though I could see how you wouldn’t if you were a huge football fan.\n\n26\n\nShiryu\n\nImagine me, an hockey fan. https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/super_blood_hockey (Mario v Sonic Olympics doesn't count), but at least it's a good one.\n\n27\n\nSteamEngenius\n\nRetro Bowl on mobile is where it's at.\n\n28\n\nKrambo42\n\n10 Yard Fight is on Switch, no?\n\n29\n\nrockodoodle\n\nEA is ridiculous for not making a Switch version. 90 plus million install base with no previous version and very limited options? It would sell very well.\n\n30\n\nHIGHscores85\n\n@Krambo42\n\nNo, that's an Irem game that Nintendo ported to NES, which is also why there is no Kung Fu sadly.\n\n31\n\nthedudeabides05\n\n@tamantayoshi DA BEARS!\n\n32\n\nStocksy\n\nNHL and a good American football game are the two big sports gaps now…. Ideally I’d love a college and a NFL game - college hoops too tbh.\n\nObviously the boxing game is a licensed Rocky thing… it’s not ideal but it passes… same as the WWE battlegrounds and Retromania…. But both decent enough for me….\n\nNASCAR I haven’t played yet but ordered physical from America. Wouldn’t mind a SRX port or either Tony Stewart game….\n\nIf we are doing wish lists….\n\nSSX 3 port please, Wave Race of any kind and any of the DIRT games 2/3 would be my pick as 5 unlikely… or a DIRT game built for just switch. Like the old days when consoles got their own 3rd party titles….\n\n33\n\nKrambo42\n\n@HIGHscores85 https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/arcade-archives-10-yard-fight-switch/\n\n34\n\nHIGHscores85\n\n@Krambo42\n\nNice\n\n35\n\nRich10\n\nLegend Bowl is coming to the switch.\n\n36\n\nWhiteTrashGuy\n\nI was just talking to my wife last night about how insane it is that there is not SOME form of MADDEN on the Switch. EA does not understand the Switch user-base at all. Being a father of 3 who owns and PS5 and Quest, I can tell you right now that the Switch is where 90% of my gaming happens due to the portability factor.\n\n37\n\nGannonBanned\n\n@adh56 Cricket is big in India which has like a billion people right? Add in the UK and that’s cooking with gas\n\n38\n\nNTELLIGENTMAN\n\nThe only football game I bought on Switch is 10 Yard Fight. The one game you forgot.\n\n39\n\nblackknight77\n\nTecmo Bowl arcade is awesome. Go with that one\n\n40\n\nNatiaAdamo\n\nMaybe it's a good thing that Madden is not on the Switch...\n\n41\n\nTasuki\n\n@Deerock69 They did back in 2008, All Pro Football 2K8 but without the NFL licensing the game just bombed in sales and 2K just stopped making Football games instead just concentrating on NBA and WWE games.\n\nAs for XFL I am sure once the league is active again Dwyane Johnson will probably look for a company to make a licensed game.\n\n42\n\nfortius54\n\nI am a huge football fan, and a huge video game fan. I lean more towards arcade football video games. Actually, I am more of a fan of arcade style sports games than the simulation games.\n\nI play video games to step out of reality for a bit. That said The Tecmo Super Bowl series is by far my favorite. I’d welcome a new entry for the Switch.\n\n43\n\nThe_Top_Loader\n\n@adh56 You do realize America .. isnt the world right? Do you know how popular cricket is in India? .. with a population of 1.4 billion people\n\nPlus Australia ? The UK ? New Zealsnd ? South Africa? The list goes on\n\n44\n\nMountain_Man\n\nPeople wondering why there aren't more football games on the Switch, it's because EA has an exclusive license with with the NFL, so they're the only publisher who can use real teams and players. Other publishers have to make up their own teams, which is less appealing to football fans.\n\n45\n\nSpoony_Tech\n\nThat's a sad list of football games.....\n\n46\n\nParker75\n\nBlood Bowl 3 is still listed as having a switch release next year...\n\n47\n\nJasmineDragon\n\n@adh56 @BulbasaurusRex Almost all American people think that. Football is massive in the States, so it must be a big deal on a global scale, right? But no, the number of football fans is a fraction of the number of cricket and soccer fans. It's not even close. Google \"most popular sports world\" for some surprises.\n\n(The difference is actually a lot more than the \"half a billion\" I threw out there in my first comment!)\n\n48\n\ncyrus_zuo\n\nI've had many hours of fun with Football Heroes Turbo. I highly recommend it if you like tecmo bowl. It gets too grindy after the fourth league, but is fun to play up to that point over and over...\n\n49\n\nLEGEND_MARIOID\n\nI have never really been interested\n\n50\n\nromanista\n\n@Shiryu which one did you mean? your link doesn't;t work.. blood sport ghockry? junior leaguhockey? really would love some nil 94 style hockey, with switch level graphics, portable.. can be with a fantasy license\n\n51\n\nShiryu\n\n@romanista ops, wrong paste up there. Fixed, it's Super Blood Hockey. It's always Super Blood Hockey.\n\n52\n\nstvnorman\n\nI missed Football Frenzy coming out. Nice one. Thanks.\n\n53\n\nAnnoyingFrenzy\n\nAs a Packers fan, I guess I can't be on this site anymore.\n\n54\n\nDrDaisy\n\nFootball is one of two things I really don't like about Thanksgiving.\n\n55\n\nMagician\n\nAlthough it isn't a great game, MFL is still the best Murican Football on Switch to date.\n\n56\n\nPatendo\n\nI wish Speedball 2 (from the Amiga days) would get a release! In fact most of bitmaps Amiga catalogue would be amazing haha\n\n57\n\nShambo\n\nHere in Europe we have this very popular sport where people kick round objects they call 'a ball' with their lower limbs, mostly the end of them that they call 'a foot'.\n\nWe call the sport hand prolate spheroid.\n\nThe eshop has some good examples of my understanding of the sports, one is called Behold the Kickmen. Mario Strikers was also just announced, an interpretation of the sports, but with added fun and less recycled code from 4 years ago, as with the most popular pick of... 'soccer' games, as the Americans say.\n\n58\n\nDioBrando\n\nIt would be great to see the original Mutant League Football. Or NFL Blitz.\n\n59\n\nMarzipanD\n\n@BulbasaurusRex yeah cricket is more popular than baseball too.\n\n60\n\nSlimPieEats\n\nAmerican foot ball is crap. I hate it. That said I own mutant league and it's fun as hell.\n\n61\n\nGitface\n\nI love Tecmo Bowl on NES, but have never played the arcade version. Is it worth picking up?\n\n62\n\nNintendoEternity\n\nTheir are NO excuses for lazy ea not to put Madden on Nintendo Switch; in fact, they've put Madden Games out on the Nintendo Wii for crying out loud and that wasn't HD at all. It's okay, I'm Buying MLB The Show 22 Digital Deluxe Edition for my Nintendo Switch on Day 1.\n\n63\n\nNintendoEternity\n\n@Gitface Absolutely 💯! It's Fantastic!\n\n64\n\ncyrus_zuo\n\nPlayed Retro Bowl today - it's fun!\n\n...and...\n\nFootball Heroes Turbo is a better game in many aspects.\n\nGlad to have them both.\n\nAwaiting Madden...\n\n65\n\nBionicDodo\n\n@GrailUK I love that game, especially the ambulance! I wish there was a new version of it like the NHL 94 update they released for modern consoles.\n\n66\n\nGrailUK\n\n@BionicDodo Great minds...erm...something something\n\n67\n\n120frames-please\n\nRetro Bowl and Football Heroes Turbo are both a lot of fun. I hope the devs of Retro Bowl bring their beautiful 60fps pixel engine to tennis, baseball, soccer, and any other sport that's fun in videogame form.\n\n68\n\njruasap\n\nIt's absolutely insane that EA won't port Madden over to Switch. The last Madden on a Nintendo Console was Madden 13 as a launch title for the Wii U! lol.\n\nI'd killer for a portable version- at least right now I can stream the Game Pass and even the Stadia versions to my phone to compensate.\n\n69\n\nblindsquirrel\n\nWe need madden on the switch.\n\n70\n\ntatanga\n\nI bought Retro bowl after your review, and i like it !\n\nIt remind me Nintendo pocket football club, but in us football. Very addictive.\n\n71\n\nBCMT\n\nI feel like there’s a huuuuuuge opportunity for someone like the Super Mega Baseball guys to pivot and make a super good football game like they do with their baseball games. Hockey too for that matter! I would trust those guys with any sport!\n\n72\n\nBCMT\n\n……and Tecmo is great in a pinch. But we all wish it was Super Tecmo Football from NES, with 8 plays instead of 4. Just port it and take the nfl names out!\n\n73\n\nEdd-O\n\nIt is a shame that Madden isn’t on Switch but Madden these days is FAR from the game it was 15 years or so ago.\n\nOn the PS2/Gamecube/Xbox the games were incredibly deep with superb franchise modes. Nowadays it’s all about Madden Ultimate Team and ‘pay to win’. The decline can be seen in the difference in Metacritic averages. Most of the PS2/Gamecube/Xbox games have Metacritic scores between the mid 80s and mid 90s. Nowadays the last couple of Maddens have been in the low 60s.\n\nHence why even as a big fan of the NFL I’d rather play any of the Maddens 2005-2008 or NFL 2K5 than Madden 22.\n\nShout out also to all of the people who pointed out how popular cricket is worldwide. Due to the number of fans in India/Pakistan/Bangladesh it can claim to be the second most popular sport in the world. Looking forward to Cricket 22 coming out on the Switch at the end of March (hopefully it’ll have ironed out most of the bugs that plagued the PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions when they launched last November).\n\n74\n\nSublogic\n\nJust a reminder, Madden sucks now. It hasn't been good since the late 2000s. As soon as they made the step up to the next gen and integrated the forstbite engine the game has been trash. Everything is now an animation and not actual physics. You think you will make a catch just to be shot up because a defender put you into an animation where you drop the ball. Why anyone wants that on switch is beside me and this is the main reason they keep pumping out this awful game. They gutted the game and people still play it.\n\n75\n\nromanista\n\nBought retro bowl today. Really nice. Geaux saints!\n\n76\n\nromanista\n\n@Patendo i recently bought a retro cade for that particular itch. (And there is a mini amiga coming out soon).\n\n77\n\nGamerGrandpa\n\n@Sublogic\n\nYeah I'd be happy with a retro-style Madden game for Switch, with updated teams and rosters, etc. Similar to Madden '97 or something, but as you say, updated physics too. I haven't played a Madden game since early on Wii.\n\n78\n\nDirty0814\n\n@GrailUK madden worked until mid 2000’s . It has sucked since.\n\nSwitch needs to add super Tecmo bowl for nes and snes.\n\n79\n\nDirty0814\n\n@BCMT super Tecmo for both nes and snes and super Tecmo 2 and 3 for snes need to all be on switch.\n\n80\n\nDirty0814\n\n@120frames-please agreed\n\n81\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\n@MarzipanD No, it's not! Cricket has never been in the Olympics save for the very first modern games, nor has there ever been a World Cricket Classic. While cricket is more popular in Europe, India, and Australia; it's overall following is behind baseball, which is popular in most of the Western Hemisphere, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nYes, American (or Canadian) football doesn't have much of a presence outside of North America, but baseball is a true international sport and overall one of the most popular team sports in the world (although soccer is of course the most popular in that regard).\n\n82\n\nKrull\n\n@BulbasaurusRex By most of the Western Hemisphere, do you mean just the Americas? Because Europe is also the West, and baseball comes below handball and volleyball in Europe. Baseball is basically just North America and Japan. And we all know why it exists in Japan.\n\nI also enjoyed your comment about baseball being most popular in the Caribbean. When cricket is synonymous with the West Indies.\n\nThat said, I quite like baseball. It’s alright. I like gridiron and (ice) hockey more, out of the big US favourites, but I like it a lot more than basketball. Which is also a much more international sport that baseball.\n\n83\n\nMarzipanD\n\n@BulbasaurusRex by all accounts 2 and a half billion cricket supporters to half a billion baseball supporters. I'll take your word cricket hasn't been to the Olympics but it does have a World Cup open to all cricket federations.(in fact they actually have 2 one for test cricket and one for one day internationals)Cricket is popular in India, Pakistan, Australia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indes, Zimbabwe and South Africa. So essentially Asia, Africa and parts of Europe.\n\nCricket is currently listed as the 4th most popular sport in the world by participation.\n\n84\n\nPatendo\n\n@romanista my Raspberry Pi keeps me going for retro fix 🤣\n\n85\n\nMontyCircus\n\n@JasmineDragon \"I'm honestly not that surprised. This came up a few months ago when we were talking about some cricket game - American football has significantly fewer fans than soccer and cricket do. Like, half a billion fewer. Of course it's a huge deal in the States, but it's not even in the top ten sports worldwide.\"\n\nYeah but Americans and Canadians have a lot of money. About 32% of global video game $$$ so it's baffling to ignore us.\n\n86\n\nJasmineDragon\n\n@BulbasaurusRex Dude, you need to stop. Baseball has about 500 million fans. Cricket has FIVE TIMES that number. These are facts. Arguing against them is pointless.\n\n87\n\nJasmineDragon\n\n@MontyCircus I think it's largely due to the fact that Madden is the only game franchise that can use actual NFL players, and NFL is the only league anyone cares about. With soccer there is a tradition of worshipping Everyman type players, following teams in foreign countries and actually playing in amateur leagues. People all over the world follow teams like Man U and Real Madrid intently. The World Cup is a major pop culture event from Beijing to Mexico City.\n\nEven other largely American sports have traditions of amateur leagues and stunt teams, so a lot of people are open to playing fantasy leagues.\n\nWith American football, it's pretty much NFL or nothing, and when one franchise owns the NFL there's not a lot of money for other companies to go for.\n\nThis is all conjecture, but I'm genuinely trying to think of an explanation. Because you're right, the NA market is massive and it would be strange for gaming companies to ignore a potentially profitable subgenre.\n\n88\n\nromanista\n\n@Patendo oh have lots of ways, my android tv with retroarch does most consoles for me (have a big usb stick into it), and a gpd xd but retrocade has some nice features too...\n\n@jasminedragon although I agree with your general points (although I think 2,5 billion cricket fans is just adding India's and Pakistans whole population , while table tennis gets half of the Chinese in this table https://www.thetealmango.com/sports/most-popular-sport-in-the-world/ ) you miss the whole college football fenomenen in the US.. most Americans also have an allegiance to their college (or the college in their state)\n\n89\n\nMostHandsieBoy\n\n@anextphilosophy there is only one really - Madden. APEX Legends was so bad I don't think anyone really cares to see what they could do with Madden.\n\n90\n\nJasmineDragon\n\n@romanista To be honest I have some doubts about the accuracy of those numbers, but when you come down to it the scale of the difference is so massive those numbers could be off by a billion and there woukd still be a huge majority for cricket. Same goes for soccer.\n\nAnd yes, there is a college football scene. But apparently it isn't the kind of thing that translates into video games or video game sales.\n\nStill, I'm just speculating.\n\n91\n\nEVIL-C\n\n100M units sold... and still no Madden.\n\nThink about that.\n\n3rd party publishers like EA are Full. Of. 💩.\n\n92\n\ndux\n\namerican football still fails to make the slightest sense to me at all.\n\n93\n\nBarryandWill\n\nRegarding India's number of cricket fans. In Europe, Africa, Central America, South America and much of Asia soccer is the most popular sport by a long, long, long way. For instance in the UK, cricket, rugby league and rugby union would be major sports but they are absolutely dwarfed by soccer.\n\nIn India, there is one major sport and it is cricket and it is massive. Everything else is a minority sport. It really can't be underestimated how big it is.\n\nIn the US it is different with the team sport space shared by American football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey. Not saying they are equally popular because that's nonsense but it's shared space.\n\nSo, the massive numbers in India shouldn't surprise people. (And as others have said, the cricket world cup predates baseball world cup and has greater participation).\n\nCricket though only has about 12 nations that are globally competitive against each other with over 90 other nations members of its governing body. Baseball is a similarly global minority sport with a handful of teams in the Americas plus Japan and South Korea being competitive.\n\n@JasmineDragon has the measure of it though. Most American sports are franchised without promotion and relegation - therefore rights are key here. If there are only a handful of teams people care about then games have to have the player and team rights otherwise everything is fantasy.\n\nI suspect a decent game which used college football teams and names / images would be hugely successful and the Madden games can exist in their current space.\n\n94\n\nRed_Silurian\n\nRemoved - trolling/baiting\n\n95\n\nromanista\n\n@barryandwill Don't forget us dutch for baseball (world champion 2011, semi finals in de WBC 2013,2017)...\n\nCricket seems to be less interested in involving smaller / non-test countries though... the dutch team regularly qualified for the World Cup, but now it's almost Impossible for a non odi-nation... Which makes me now support the west-indies, since I discovered the dutch island of st. Martin actually is a member of it cricket federation..\n\n96\n\nEdd-O\n\n@romanista The Netherlands qualified for the last T20 World Cup late last year, sadly they underperformed and lost 3 games out of 3.\n\nThey are also playing in the World Cup Super League (50 overs) alongside the 12 test teams, as the 13th side. The 50 over Cricket World Cup is going back up to 14 teams in 2027 so hopefully they'll be back in then, as well as making the T20 World Cups later this year and in 2024/2026 (the T20 World Cup is expanding from 16 to 20 teams for 2024 and onwards).\n\n97\n\nromanista\n\n@Edd-O Ah good to hear it's going back up... (and i'll never forget the T20 win over england in 2014)\n\n98\n\nCammyUnofficial\n\nIt's a hail mary but I'd love to see tecmo super bowl 3 from the SNES on switch\n\n99\n\nWindy\n\nAt this point Madden 95 and NHL 94/95 would be welcome sights for football and hockey fans. Weak is all I can say\n\n100\n\nsamuelvictor\n\nI was today years old when I discovered Madden is not on the Switch. No NHL or PGA either? Whats going on? 🤯\n\nI assumed they at least released legacy editions like with FIFA. While I've been annoyed at legacy editions, that's at least better than no option at all! Are those series not a big sellers anymore? I assumed they were big as ever in the States, just as FIFA is in Europe.\n\n101\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nThe sillier the better for me. As I have no interest in the sport otherwise but arcadey nonsense is always welcome.\n\n102\n\nAndroidiOS\n\nI reger to it as 'American Rugby'\n\n103\n\nroboshort\n\n@AndroidiOS Rugby is also called Rugby Football so that would make it American Rugby Football\n\n104\n\nAndroidiOS\n\n@roboshort No, it's just American Rugby.\n\n105\n\nCoffeemonstah\n\nHigh Impact Football (arcade/SNES) was my kick back in the day. I have a fondness for most of the Midway/Williams sports games of that era - having grown up in the era of Dan Marino and John Elway, airing it out was incredibly satisfying.\n\nHope someone at Hamster is taking notes.\n\n106\n\ntravisbrowning\n\nBear Down!! FTP!\n\nI do wish we would get a Mario take on football.\n\n107\n\nZZalapski\n\n@Windy @samuelvictor It is absolutely wild to me that you need more than two hands to count the number of golf games on the Switch, yet there are no decent ice hockey games that we can play on the same console. Considering how it's almost like a video game sport already, it seems inexplicable that no notable developers have taken a crack at bringing hockey to the Switch.\n\n108\n\nromanista\n\nSo we still not have a madden '93 beater.. still retro bowl is fun\n\n109\n\nsamuelvictor\n\n@ZZalapski Yeah it seems crazy 😳\n\n110\n\nskycargav2000\n\nAXIS is the best game of American Football on the list. Just lacks the license. Great game!\n\n111\n\ndkxcalibur\n\nI've been craving a Madden game but sadly stupid EA doesn't see any money in bringing an NFL game to the Switch here in NA. Total missed opportunity.\n\nOff the subject, the NFL signed exclusively with EA which shut down the very promising 2K NFL games. The contract runs our in 2025, but could go an extra year!\n\n112\n\nSalnax\n\nMadden’s license exclusivity has been a disaster for the genre.\n\n113\n\nSalnax\n\n@samuelvictor EA’s sports lineup is still sizable in the USA, but series like Madden seemingly peaked in the later half of the PS2’s lifespan. This is in contrast to FIFA, which is WAY bigger nowadays.\n\nWhat makes this weird is that American Football did not decline IRL, with the Super Bowl growing in popularity from the mid 00’s to 2015.\n\nMy guess is that the football genre in the USA previously existed as a competition between series, and Madden’s NFL license killed not only other football series but also EA’s efforts to make top tier games, leading to slowly decreasing sales. Note that Madden sales peaked in the few years after they got exclusivity, and declined during the console transition.\n\n114\n\nsamuelvictor\n\n@Salnax Oh, that's really interesting insight, thank you! So even though sports games are often thought to sell to more casual audiences, the quality drop was still very noticeable. EA really let it slip. Big shame. For me, the PS2 era is the last one where I really paid attention to any of these games except FIFA. I wasn't aware of this slow decline.\n\n115\n\nHawkPigXII\n\n@skycargav2000 Would have to disagree and IMO, Legend Bowl is far and away the best football game on Switch at the moment. There is just the right amount of sim style (and fun) gameplay that can also be the right amount of challenge too.\n\nI also got a lot of enjoyment (and hours) out of Retro Bowl and I'm hoping the College iteration will also find its way Switch bound.\n\nAxis isn't too bad but there are too many issues holding it back. The franchise mode is fantastic but I don't feel the gameplay is there just yet, I'm hoping that '24 will improve that though. I'm no expert when it comes to football games but for some reason there is just absolutely no challenge in Axis and no discernible difference in the difficulty settings.\n\nHowever, I just can't see anything getting close to the fun factor that both Legend Bowl and Retro Bowl provide anytime soon.\n\n116\n\nSalnax\n\n@samuelvictor Don't forget, the generic sports audience may be fairly casual, but they often buy iterations of the same game year after year. Meaning that if anyone is going to have enough experience to see a decline in series quality, it's them.\n\n117\n\nsamuelvictor\n\n@Salnax Very true! It's a shame EA lost the quality they uses to be known for. I've heard good things about EA FC though, considering jumping back in for that one 😀\n\n118\n\nWindy\n\n@ZZalapski would love to see a decent hockey game. I say slap online play on NHL old-school and at least start it in the right direction. I miss the days of the Xband which NHL and Madden both worked on sega genesis. Yup I'm old lol. Yup we need a good hockey game but that ship is sailing now. Maybe Switch 2\n\n119\n\nchiefeagle02\n\nI’m good with Tecmo Bowl.\n\n120\n\nrough-machine01\n\nYou know, my mom would be a better pro at these (and she's not even a gamer) because even in my 30s, I still have NO idea how to play football or how it works. (Doesn't help that the \"How to Play Football\" short from Disney had the crowd purposely drown out the narrator when he tries to explain, only quieting down long enough for him to say \"And that's how the game works\")\n\n121\n\nCoffeemonstah\n\nKinda hoping that Hamster get round to the High Impact games that Midway/Williams did.\n\nAnd NBA Jam as well. I think that benefitted hugely from High Impact, since it helped Turmell & Co figure out what they were doing and how they wanted to do it.\n\n122\n\nDarthmoogle\n\n@IceDomino ok I’ll explain football to you. Bunch of big 200+ pound guys run into each other attempting to either protect or knock down usually smaller man with ball and give each other concussions… there I think I summarized it fairly well lol\n\n123\n\nrough-machine01\n\n@Darthmoogle There are two things I enjoy about football: the Super Bowl commercials and the snacks. Think mom and I joked once when I played an NFL demo on PS4 about a decade ago, and we were more focused on the NPC in the stands getting concessions than the actual game itself.\n\n124\n\nwuntyme8\n\nLong overdue for a true Mario American Football arcade sports game.\n\nAlso, bring back NFL Blitz & NFL Street games.\n\n125\n\nPoodlestargenerica\n\n@wuntyme8 Yunno, I was just about to say the same thing. I'm not a football fan at all, but I think Mario Football would be awesome, and I'm amazed that they never made one. You're also right about Blitz and Street. Everyone wants simulation now, but I don't think that suits American football like it does with basketball.\n\n126\n\nLikelySatan\n\n@IceDomino They carry a ball to a goal line. If they cross that goal line, they get points.\n\n...it's thrilling.\n\n127\n\nlocky-mavo\n\nPersonally don’t care for NFL, as it’s not my country’s sport, and not nearly as exciting as they make it out to be in the movies. But I would have like to of seen the Blood Bowl games on Switch.\n\nBB3 was announced, never released but never cancelled afaik, but was a pretty mediocre game in the end. A port of BB2 would have been nice."
