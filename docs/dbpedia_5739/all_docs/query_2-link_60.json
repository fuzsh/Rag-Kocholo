When a Content Descriptor is preceded by the term “Mild” it is intended to convey low frequency, intensity or severity.\n\nOnline Music Not Rated by the ESRB – Warns that songs that are streamed or downloaded as add-ons for music-based games have not been rated and that their content has not been considered in the ESRB rating assignment.\n\nESRB Ratings Criteria for Non-Game Apps:\n\nThe ESRB Rating Guide and all search results on ESRB.org refer to games rated through our traditional rating process. However, ESRB also assigns ratings to non-game apps on certain mobile and digital storefronts that have licensed the IARC rating system. For insight into some of the criteria ESRB uses to rate non-game apps, click here."
