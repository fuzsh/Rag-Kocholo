        "text": "Most people still think of boys and teens when they hear about gamers. However, gaming is no longer exclusively a male-dominated industry.\n\nIn 2022, women comprised around 48% of US gamers. The number of women gamers has been consistently increasing over the years.\n\nRead on about the shifting gaming demographics and the latest industry developments.\n\nAn Overview of the Video Gamers’ Demographics\n\nThe gaming community is becoming a diverse group in terms of age, with increasing numbers of younger and older players alike.\n\nMen spend over 6 hours in video gaming, ahead only an hour from the hours women spend at 5 hours.\n\nThese and more are just some of the statistics that will be discussed in the following sections of the article below.\n\nStatistics on Video Gamers\n\nFrom 2.7 billion video gamers in 2020, the figure rose to 5.6% in 2023 at 3.2 billion. By 2024, this number will increase to 3.34 billion.\n\nThe majority of the increase is attributed to the Asia Pacific market. These numbers will only increase now that everything is back to normal.\n\nRead on to find out the latest statistics on video gamers.\n\n1. 3.24 billion people worldwide play video games.\n\n(Statista)\n\nThe gaming world is rapidly growing. The gamer demographics for 2021 show that over 40% of the global population are gamers. Most of the world’s gamers come from Asia – 1.48 billion.\n\nThe growth is visible compared to 2020 when the world had an estimated 2.7 billion gamers.\n\n2. 76% of gamers in the US were over 18 in 2022\n\n(Entertainment Software Association)\n\nGaming demographics for 2022 show that the largest group of gamers are, in fact, adults.\n\nOnly 24% of gamers in the US are under 18. The largest group are people aged 18 to 34, with 36%. The smallest group is gamers over 65, with 6%.\n\n3. The average age of video game players is around 35 years.\n\n(VentureBeat)\n\nThe gamer age statistics worldwide show that the gaming world is changing all the time. The average of video game players is shifting upwards. In 2022, it was between 35 and 44.\n\nWith the growth of the mobile gaming industry, people of all ages are enjoying games. Video games are no longer just for children.\n\n4. In 2022, 70% of adult US gamers played games on their smartphones.\n\n(Entertainment Software Association)\n\nDue to mobile games’ growing popularity and availability, smartphones are the most used devices for playing video games. Game consoles come second, at 52%, while 43% play on PCs.\n\n5. Nearly 79% of all Internet users regularly engage in gaming activities.\n\n(Newzoo)\n\nGamers are an appealing demographic for brands, especially those that bring the right message, as players have a 36% more positive outlook on brands than non-players.\n\nThere is more to gaming than just playing: Trends in the metaverse and in-game socialization have accelerated and skyrocketed.\n\nGaming Demographics Gender Stats\n\nGender is one of the demographic aspects that has changed the most in the past decade. Women gamers are on the rise, and there’s no stopping them.\n\nHere are some interesting statistics on the gender demographics of gamers.\n\n6. 48% of US gamers identify as female.\n\n(Entertainment Software Association)\n\nOver the years, the male-to-female gamers’ ratio was perceived to favor men. But, the statistics show that the difference is pretty small.\n\nFemale gamers have consistently hovered around 40% since 2008. But women’s share of the gaming population has grown to nearly half over the past decade.\n\n7. Women make up 41% of PlayStation 4 and 5 owners.\n\n(Push Square, Axios)\n\nIn 2022, Sony announced that over 21.7 million units of PlayStation 5 have been sold globally since its release. 41% of combined PlayStation 4 and 5 sold are owned by women.\n\nThe percentage of women owners is increasing and is much higher than for PlayStation 1 – only 18%.\n\n8. 96% of boys and 76% of girls played games regularly.\n\n(National Center of Biotechnology Information)\n\nA recent Norwegian study in 2020 showed that within the 9-18 age group, 96% of boys and 76% of girls play video games regularly.\n\nIn 2018, the percentage of boys was the same, while only 63% of girls identified as gamers.\n\n9. 80% of US male gamers aged 18-34 prefer shooter games.\n\n(Entertainment Software Association)\n\nMen aged 18-34 prefer shooter games, while women prefer family games.\n\nThis explains why games such as Call of Duty earn almost $2 billion annually and Mario games are still trendy.\n\n10. In 2021, 10.9% of women and 11.9% of men worldwide play video games for over 20 hours per week.\n\n(Statista)\n\nMen and women spend 8.45 hours a week on average playing video games.\n\nIn January 2022, a survey involving gamers in the US revealed that 6% of women while 9% of men played video games for 13 to 24 hours a week.\n\nVideo Gamers Demographics by Race and Country\n\nThere are billions of gamers worldwide, so you might wonder which country has the most gamers or produces the most skilled gamers.\n\nHere are some interesting global gamer demographics that you need to know.\n\n11. In the US, 215.5 million people regularly engage in video gaming.\n\n(Entertainment Software Association)\n\nThe US is one of the countries with the highest video game revenues and the highest number of gamers. 2021 stats show that almost 70% of the population plays video games.\n\nThis was nearly 6% more than in 2020, when gamers reached 214 million, and 28% more than in 2019, when the US had 164 million gamers.\n\n12. Female gamers make up 37% of Asia’s total gamer population.\n\n(Business of Apps, Niko Partners)\n\nThe latest report from Niko Partners revealed that 37% of gamers in Asia are women. This figure is growing at a rate of 11% per year.\n\nFemale gamers comprise about 23.5% of the Asian games market’s total revenue.\n\n13. In 2022, there were nearly 2 billion mobile gamers.\n\n(Statista, PocketGamer.biz)\n\nRevenue from smartphone games is expected to reach $91.4 billion in 2022, representing 45% of the total gaming market. With a global revenue of $58.6 billion, console games came second.\n\nFurthermore, research shows that women account for most mobile gamers, with 63% saying they turn to mobile gaming as their source of “me time.”\n\n14. 71% of American gamers belong to the Caucasian group.\n\n(Entertainment Software Association, Axios)\n\nThe second largest ethnic group, with 10%, is Hispanic, 8% are African American, 7% are Asian or Pacific Islanders, and 3% are other ethnicities.\n\nIt may seem like a small percentage of the population, but the share of non-white gamers is rising.\n\nFactors such as gatekeeping, representation, spending power, and class divide contribute to the number of players according to their ethnic group.\n\n15. China has the most gamers of all countries, with an estimated 744 million as of 2022.\n\n(Newzoo)\n\nChina’s gaming population is the largest worldwide, with nearly 750 million gamers. This is unsurprising since China has the largest population and one of the largest gaming industries.\n\nHowever, it’s yet to be seen how the demographic of gamers in China will change now that restrictions on underage gamers went into effect in 2021.\n\n16. The United Arab Emirates has the world’s highest per-capita rate of adult gamers.\n\n(Statista)\n\nIn 2022, 91% of people in the UAE said they played video games at least occasionally, with many being avid mobile gaming fans.\n\nSmartphone mobile gaming is a rapidly expanding industry because it attracts new players by being accessible on the go and costing very little to get started.\n\nThe Endgame\n\nThe gaming scene has indeed changed over the years. Not only are women closing the gap in terms of population with men, but they are also at par with their skills.\n\nAlthough there is still much work to be done regarding representation, as this multimillion-dollar industry evolves, so does the audience.\n\nStatistics may have changed, but one thing remains: gaming, after all, goes beyond age and gender."
