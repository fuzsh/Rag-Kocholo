Seems great.\n\nYou do realize that few collectors collect just to keep it to themselves, right? Would you rather I started ANOTHER stupid YouTube channel? There are tons of collectors uploading new videos with each new addition and I don't want to add to that noise. This works for me.\n\nPart of the problem is that a lot of this is done at a flea market where there is no cellular signal. I have a plain-text offline copy of the OP and the buy list which I routinely update before going offline. What I really need is a printout of all the pricecharting prices before I go offline.\n\nWhy does it have to be \"between the TWO of\" us? The part about \"where I can reference it\" is important. It's a public link I can give to someone else random when we are working out trades. I don't want some cloud service with some required app or a downloadable text file or spreadsheet that some phones wouldn't know what to do with. I don't have to sign up for web-hosting or friend them on Facebook or invite them to a Facebook group.\n\nSpeaking of Facebook groups, being \"on a public forum\" doesn't mean we can't socialize and look for others similarly excited about certain subjects. Your primary complaint stems from the misconception that social posts don't belong on public forums.\n\nFacebook groups don't seem to work nearly as well for collection-tracking/updates. They are chiefly local which drastically limits those interested in participation. I already got a suggestion I would not have had on my buy list if it weren't for this thread. My Zelda II thread was social and that legitimately helped me in ways that would have been ruined if I just looked up an online FAQ or walk-through.\n\nIf multi-posting annoys you, how do you feel about thread-crapping? The only reason you see so many posts in a row up there is because the nature of the content, which someone asked for (participation, remember?), required me to break up a single post and integrate it into four. Tapatalk glitches and won't let me edit posts with long lists in code tags so I had to turn a \"Complete\" list into a reply with \"Have,\" \"Want,\" and \"Remainder\" lists. The extra posts would have been integrated into replies or updates otherwise with plenty of back and forth. Even if you don't consider all of those a reply to him at least I responded in a way that undeniably added some utility to my list while skirting Tapatalk's glitches.\n\nNow: You clicked the thread so I assume you had SOME interest. How familiar are you with the NES library? Do you have any suggestions that should be in my \"buy\" list?\n\nI remember playing Ikari Warriors a couple times, but I recently picked up Guerilla war instead. I seem to remember having a lot more fun with that.\n\nMy only memory of Ikari Warriors was that a friend brought it over once when we were kids and it was great fun beating it with two players. The label even promotes that with something like \"Two can play together!\" on the front. I recall that it either had arcade-style unlimited continues or it was very generous with them which is why we were able to just keep going. I think the ending had a sort of cinematic with an airplane and the president's daughter or something.\n\nEdit: Looks like that was Ikari Warriors III: The Rescue, which is the only one I still don't have.\n\nThe original PC/XT keyboard did the same thing.\n\n74LS322 1 in 8 out shift register with sign extend.\n\nThe 8 bit parallel output went to port A of the 8255 PPI that you read at 60h, the clear/reset lines went to some bits in port B of the 8255 @ 61h, but the magic is that the sign extend of the 74LS322 pushes a bit out the end into a single 74LS74 flip flop whose output drives pin 19 of the 8259 PIC for INT1.\n\nThey keyboard sends 9 bit bytes with a start bit such that on the 9th shift the start bit is pushed out into the 74LS74 once the last bit of the scancode is shifted in, which triggers INT1.\n\nThe interrupt routine installed by the BIOS reads the byte at the shift register presented by the 8255 @ 60h, translates/stores it in the BIOS data area keyboard buffer, toggles the shift register and flip flop clear/reset presented as bits in 8255 @ 61h, acknowledges and clears the interrupt, and the process repeats.\n\nIt's so simple it's genius.\n\nI'm on a massive hardware kick right now.\n\nGoing to build me one of these:\n\nhttp://www.mtmscientific.com/pc-retro.html\n\nThen experiment with connecting a Cyclone II FPGA to the ISA slot and try making my own console style VDP (tile based multi layer scrolling, sprites, etc) for the PC.\n\nThere's not reason with a 4.77 MHz 16 bit CPU with an 8 bit bus @ 1.19 MB/s can't do SNES+ quality graphics. Consoles had a huge advantage with 2D hardware acceleration for over a decade.\n\nHell even most other PCs had some form of hardware sprites or BITBLT or something.\n\nAlright, Woz, you've convinced me. *shove aside* Now you let me do the talking.\n\nI have been thinking about asking my friend to search his dad's shed for his old PC XT so I can poke around but never thought about making a clone. I guess it'd just be too easy to pick up an old one with the floppy drives and input and everything good to go."
