Feel free to add any that you know of to the list in the comments\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nSoldam: Drop, Connect, Erase\n\nThe End Is Nigh\n\nIttle Dew 2+\n\nCave Story +\n\nBattle Chasers: Night War\n\nDe Blob\n\nDe Blob 2\n\nThe Legend of Kay: Anniversary\n\nThis Is The Police\n\nResident Evil Revelations Collection\n\nSome of these may be incorrect, but I've had very little input from others across multiple sites.\n\nI'm finding a lot of THQ Nordic and Nicalis titles are North America only releases.\n\nHopefully other people can add to this or make adjustments so we can have something that may look complete and accurate for reference.\n\nWas going to say there quite a bit of US release now but some are only exclusive to EU market that you have to get it from Amazon UK, FR, GR or only from Amazon JPN and some only come from exclusive online sellers like LRG, SRG and others. So the list isn't extensive but can be long. I have a half dozen eShop but have roughly 100+ Physical NSW. So listing them would be a chore. Unless someone pays me to list them."
