        "text": "The Rarest & Most Valuable Xbox Games (OG Xbox)\n\nThe original XBox doesn’t have quite as many cult classics as the PS2 and Gamecube, but there are still some gems and oddities in the library that collectors do their best to snatch up. Â Much like Gamecube games on the Wii, many of the games listed below still benefit greatly from being backward-compatible on newer Xbox hardware.\n\nIn stark contrast to the Cheapest Games series, this Rare & Valuable series takes a look at the most in-demand and expensive games for a console.. Below you will see two prices beside each title. The first is the average daily selling price, which is typically the going rate for either a loose disc or a game in a case but without a manual. The second price is the highest price in the past three months which is usually the price for a gem mint copy (sealed values are then listed separately). The list is ordered by the balance of the two primary prices.\n\nPrices Current as of November 2023\n\nRECENT GROWTH OF NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL GAMES\n\nWith three full years since our last guide revision, it was easy to notice a lot of ranking shifting with the North American retail releases. Â I decided to chart out the major movers. Â In the chart below I compared the average pricing between the different average loose/rough price levels for a game and their highest mint copy sale during the time frame. Â I compared those averages between our 2020 guide and this 2023 guide to calculate the value growth percentage. If youâ€™d like to see the full 2020 guide for comparison, I have made it available to my Patreon members. (Only $1 of support or more is needed to access)\n\nAfter the chart, we will dig into the details of the top North American, Japanese, and PAL OG Xbox games â€” we have a lot to cover!\n\nTreasured Standard USA Releases\n\nSteel Battalion: $170 – $1050 ($1400 sealed)\n\nSteel Battalion (Game only): $70 – $105\n\nThe original Xbox was and interesting entry into the console wars: an American tech powerhouse adapting in PC architecture and trying to shake up the industry.\n\nEven though Microsoft had a difficult time getting strong Japanese developer support, but those that did sign on were excited to make use of its hardware strengths. Capcom was amongst the established developers that created some fresh content for the Xbox and really took things to the next level with Steel Battalion. The game not only delivered a high-end mech simulator that gamers would only expect on a PC, but created a custom controller that drastically elevated the experience. Both during the Xbox’s original run and in the two decades that followed, Steel Battalion has remained a legend that is included in our Games That Defined the Xbox guide.\n\nItâ€™s a bit unfair to include Steel Battalion so high on the list as most of the value of the full set is due to the massive controller that remains as a mech fanâ€™s dream come true. However, even the bare game still holds its own in the top 10, so we canâ€™t complain too much. It’s also worth mentioning that used copies have are now significantly over its original retail price of $200. Back in our 2009 guide, it was only in the $81 to $204 range with the controller in our 2009 guide (and $30 to $35 for the game only).\n\nIf you arenâ€™t familiar with it, Steel Battalionâ€™s controller tries to replicate being inside a Mech and had nearly 40 buttons. With the large, expensive controller setup and a relatively niche audience, the initial production was close to 2,000 units but the game was re-released, adding a few more copies to the market. Later releases had blue buttons on the controllers compared to the green buttons of the original run. There is usually a bit of a premium on the original green-button units, but often the condition/existence of the outer box makes more of a difference in resale value.\n\nCheck for Steel Battalion on eBay\n\nCheck for Steel Battalion on Amazon\n\nOutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast : $200 – $360 ($400 Sealed)\n\nSega has so many awesome franchises under their belt, but in recent years they have struggled to do them justice. However, the 21st-century resurrection of the Outrun franchise was right one the mark when it came to maintaining the exhilarating arcade feel in a modern gaming world.\n\nThe original Outrun 2 release is quite an affordable gem to own on the OG Xbox, but this Coast 2 Coast follow-up (which is the same game with some extra modes, cars, and some redesigned levels) did not get a very large production run on the Xbox despite being relatively plentiful [and still affordable] on the PS2.\n\nWith that being said, keep in mind that while Coast 2 Coast is indeed a solid release from Sega, you could be more than fine with the original Outrun 2 release or play Coast 2 Coast on another platform more affordably. Back in our original 2009 version of this guide, Coast 2 Coast was merely an honorable mention on the list, weighing in at a $20 to $28 price range. It wasn’t until 2016 that solid collecting interest in this version really started to take off, hitting a $70 to $80 range. Since then, Coast 2 Coast has risen gradually and established itself as the most in-demand Xbox standard retail release that doesn’t include a special controller.\n\nCheck for OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast on eBay\n\nCheck for OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast on Amazon\n\nFuturama: $110 – $280 ($350 Sealed)\n\nThe cult-classic animated series from Matt Groening was struggling to find a mainstream audience on Fox when this console game adaptation was in development. The show ended up getting canceled in 2003, the same year the game arrived in stores. Since the game wasnâ€™t released until after the last episode of season 4, the Futurama game was viewed as a â€œlost episodeâ€ containing 28 minutes of new animation.\n\nVivendi Universal Games had a feeling the show wasnâ€™t doing well so the print run of both the PS2 and Xbox versions were kept rather low. (You can find the PS2 version at a similar price point on that Rare and Valuable guide) A Gamecube and Game Boy Advance port was also originally developed but canceled.\n\nEven though the animated series was revived four years later, the game has remained a collector’s item and has appreciated quite well over the last few years. Back in 2012, you could score a copy in the $30 to $36 range, but it has been climbing steadily since then.\n\nCheck for Futurama on eBay\n\nCheck for Futurama on Amazon\n\nTeen Titans : $100 – $225 ($260 Sealed)\n\nEvery now and then, it’s fun to pick up a fun beatemup based on one of your favorite licensed properties and zone out. Teen Titans from THQ is one of these types of games that was released on all the major platforms in the era.\n\nIt’s quite easy to find copies of the same game on the PS2 and Gamecube for under $20, but the Xbox version is much trickier to find in the wild and commands about 4 to 5 times the value.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the Xbox version only had a 2X premium over its PS2 and Gamecube peers, but collectors eventually started noticing it is a trickier pickup.\n\nCheck for Teen Titans on eBay\n\nCheck for Teen Titans on Amazon\n\nNBA Ballers Platinum Hits: $70-$255 ($270 Sealed)\n\nTypically a “greatest hits” series is rather easy to find, but sometimes there are some random examples of releases that have a rather small print run for the series.\n\nThe NBA Ballers Platinum Hits edition is by far the hardest to find of the series at least in part because of being released so late into the OG Xbox life span. The Platinum Ballers also happens to be among the very hardest OG Xbox releases to find as a whole.\n\nBack in this Reddit thread from 2020, it was stated that collectors thought “there are like 5 copies we know about in varying states and one of them sold for a $1000 or something a while ago.” As far back as 2017, there were many doubting the variant even existed, despite being listed on Wikipedia.\n\nWhile it is indeed rare, more people are learning of its significance and starting to cash in on it, balancing out the supply and demand. Â And while it is definitely not a single-digit print run, it is still likely the rarest North American Xbox release.\n\nCheck for NBA Ballers Platinum Hits on eBay\n\nSpikeout Battle Street: $75-$200 ($260 Sealed)\n\nSega produced a handful of interesting Xbox exclusives in the year that followed their departure of the console hardware business.\n\nHowever, many Sega fans, including myself didn’t really hear much about Spikeout Battle Street, a modern beatemup which was released in the Spring of 2005, just months before the Xbox 360 was launched.\n\nSpikeout Battle Street was developed by Dimps (known for their work on the Sega Advance series and eventually collaborated with Capcom on Street Fighter IV and V). The Spikeout series originated in the arcades (and this is the only console installment) and Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi also directed this installment.\n\nCheck for Spikeout Battle Street on eBay\n\nCheck for Spikeout Battle Street on Amazon\n\nMarvel vs Capcom 2: $75 – $200\n\nIf you want the biggest mashup of characters in your fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 is the place to be. It may not be the most balanced game for tournaments, but its one of the most popular mainstream 2D fighters out there even nearly 20 years after its initial release.\n\nMost gamers may flock to the PS2 version, but the Xbox release is just right behind it in terms of value. The more recent Marvel vs Capcom games have stolen some attention from part 2, but some fans still swear by this installment and its often the ones that gets the most nostalgia talk (I’m personally still partial to the original Marvel vs Capcom and even X-Men vs Street Fighter before it).\n\nThese physical releases original had a higher ranking on the Rare and Valuable guides, but MvC2 has also been released digitally on XBLA and PSN making it more accessible and calming down the value of these “vintage” releases. Back in our 2009 guide, copies were in the $73 to $155 range (and were a bit more expensive couple years earlier.) The game took a big dive in 2009/2010 after the digital re-releases and just stared to increase a bit more between 2016 and now.\n\nCheck for Marvel vs Capcom 2 on eBay\n\nCheck for Marvel vs Capcom 2 on Amazon\n\nDef Jam Fight for New York (Black Label): $62 – $156 ($250 Sealed)\n\nDef Jam Fight for New York (Platinum Hits): $55 – $120\n\nIt’s not too often you see a mainstream, multi-platform EA game on a Rare and Valuable guide like this, but this follow-up to Def Jam Vendetta has remained a fan favorite and has had more people looking to pick up a copy than there are people looking to part with their own copy.\n\nThis sequel expanded from exclusively wrestling battles to more fighting styles such as Streetfighting, Kickboxing, and Martial Arts. It also, of course, adds to its lineup of rapper and other pop-culture celebrities to battle with. Fight for New York also strived to make the controls more intuitive and offer a Create-A-Fighter feature.\n\nFight for New York also received a Platinum Hits release (which is mentioned down below), but there is a slight premium on this original, “Black Label” release.\n\nUnlike some of the other multiplayer games on this list, Fight For New York is actually more expensive on the PS2 — in fact, it’s about double to price. This could be more of a demand issue for those that are nostalgic for a game like this have one of the plentiful PS2s out in the wild.\n\nCheck for Def Jam Fight for New York on eBay\n\nCheck for Def Jam Fight for New York on Amazon\n\nAdditional Valuable North American Releases\n\nThe Guy Game: $55-$130 (eBay)\n\nDef Jam Fight for New York (Platinum Hits): $55 – $120 (eBay)\n\nJet Set Radio Future (Standalone): $50-$115 ($250 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nOtogi 2: $50-$110 ($140 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nObscure: $40-$115 ($200 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nAuto Modellista: $45-$110 ($200 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nAzurik Rise Of Perathia [Not for Resale]: $50-$100 (eBay)\n\nFatal Frame 2: $44-$95 ($120 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nXyanide: $47-$90 (eBay)\n\nDino Crisis 3: $35-$97 (eBay)\n\nCurse The Eye of Isis: $40-$92 ($180 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nGrand Theft Auto Trilogy: $26-$105 (eBay)\n\nBloody Roar Extreme: $40-$85 ($150 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nDigimon Rumble Arena 2: $35-$85 (eBay)\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants Lights Camera Pants Platinum Hits: $30-$90 (eBay)\n\nFatal Frame: $33-$85 (eBay)\n\nSteel Battalion Line of Contact: $40-$75 (eBay)\n\nGodzilla Save the Earth: $34-$76 ($135 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nHalo Triple Pack: $40-$70 ($300 Sealed) (eBay)\n\nSonic Riders [DVD Bundle]: $35-$71 (eBay)\n\nSplinter Cell [Not for Resale]: $40-$65 (eBay)\n\n50 Cent (Platinum Hits): $43-$60 (eBay)\n\nHarry Potter Sorcerers Stone: $26-$71 (eBay)\n\nGauntlet Dark Legacy: $18-$60 (eBay)\n\nIHRA Drag Racing Sportsman Edition: $27-$45 (eBay)\n\nCapcom Classics Collection Volume 2: $20-$52 (eBay)\n\nFight Night Round 2 Platinum Hits: $20-$35 (eBay)\n\nMost Valuable PAL Region Xbox Games\n\nRoom Zoom\n\nThis racer is essentially a modern take on the Micro Machines (or the N64/Dreamcast RC racer, Re-Volt) with the setup of having toy cars racing around everyday household locations such as kitchens, bedrooms. The game incorporates a fun and whimsical atmosphere with colorful graphics and dynamic gameplay.\n\nThe game was quite affordable in North America (including a PS2 release), but was quite difficult to find in PAL regions. Even to this day, it’s tricky to find it show up on eBay.\n\nCheck for Room Zoom on eBay\n\nXiaolin Showdown\n\nThis beatemup game by Konami is based on the Kids WB animated series that ran through the early aughts, allowing players to step into the shoes of the Xiaolin monks â€“ Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay â€“ as they embark on a quest to thwart the evil Heylin forces.\n\nThe game blends martial arts combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. Players can switch between the four main characters, each possessing unique elemental abilities corresponding to their Wu Xing elements.\n\nXiaolin Showdown was in wide distribution in North America on the Xbox, PSP, PS2, and DS. PAL regions saw a version of each, but the PAL Xbox version had a quite limited print run in the region and has become hunted down by collectors.\n\nCheck for Xiaolin Showdown on eBay\n\nCastlevania: Curse of Darkness\n\nUnlike its predecessor, “Lament of Innocence,” and other 3D Castlevania titles, Curse of Darkness featured a more open-ended, non-linear structure. Players explored a variety of interconnected environments, deviating from the linear level design of previous 3D entries.\n\nWhile maintaining the series’ signature gothic atmosphere, Curse of Darkness departed from the traditional linear approach of 3D Castlevania titles.\n\nEven though it isn’t the strongest 3D Castlevania installment, the game has maintained a respectable resale value in all regions on both Xbox and PS2. However, the PAL Xbox version is pretty tricky to find in the wild, resulting in this premium.\n\nCheck for Castlevania: Curse of DarknessÂ on eBay\n\nAdditional PAL Region Rarities\n\nFrankie Dettori Racing: $150-$160 (eBay)\n\nGene Troopers: $50-$200 (eBay)\n\nOutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast: $70-$150 (eBay)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone: $75-$140 (eBay)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 Mutant Nightmare: $60-$140 (eBay)\n\nNightCaster II: Equinox: $50-$100 (eBay)\n\nGreg Hastings Tournament Paintball MAX’D: $60 – $80 (eBay)\n\nOtogi: Myth of Demons: $50-$80 (eBay)\n\nJaws Unleashed: $50-$80 (eBay)\n\nKnights of the Temple II: $40-$66 (eBay)\n\nMost Valuable Japanese XBox Releases\n\nDaemon Vector: $300 – $500\n\nDaemon Vector is an ultra-obscure action-adventure game featuring a medieval setting where European adventurers inadvertently unleash a curse from an Asian artifact, turning humans into zombies.\n\nAs the hero, players combat this undead threat in a gothic-styled slashing action RPG, where a sinister strain of the Black Plague animates the decaying dead of Medieval Europe. The narrative traces back to the 14th century, triggered by Marco Polo’s return, breaking a seal from ancient China and plunging Europe into the horrors of the Black Death.\n\nEven though the cover looks impressive and the premise is intriguing, the general consensus is that the actual game is sadly lacking. Daemon Vector is a console exclusive to the Japanese Xbox, but also received a PC release in the UK.\n\nIt is rumored that this Xbox version only had 200 copies produced, which is the prime reason this game is such a collector’s item.\n\nCheck for Daemon Vector on eBay\n\nPlus Plum 2: $105 – $300\n\nPlus Plum 2, a puzzle game developed and published by Takuy, presents a competitive puzzle experience with three falling object types requiring color-matching in groups of three. The twist lies in disappearing objects and changing contiguous object colors upon matching.\n\nCareful planning allows players to create multi-chain color combos, factoring in color changes as objects vanish. Adding complexity, the game introduces a weight concept, as the platform holding falling objects functions as a scale influenced by block quantity.\n\nCheck for Plus Plum 2 on eBay\n\nShikigami no Shiro II: $130 – $220\n\nShikigami no Shiro II is a vertically scrolling shoot ’em up (shmup) game developed by Alfa System. The game is renowned for its unique blend of traditional bullet-hell mechanics and an innovative “Tension System.” In Shikigami no Shiro II, players can switch between two distinct modes â€“ Human and Shikigami â€“ altering their attack patterns and abilities. The Tension System rewards players for close encounters with enemies, encouraging risk-taking for higher scores.\n\nVisually, Shikigami no Shiro II is striking with its vibrant anime-inspired art style and intense, bullet-filled action. The challenging gameplay, coupled with a dynamic scoring system and engaging character narratives, makes it a standout title in the shoot ’em up genre, appealing to both genre enthusiasts and those seeking a fresh take on classic arcade shooters.\n\nCheck for Shikigami no Shiro II on eBay\n\nPsyvariar 2: Extend Edition: $120 – $200\n\nPsyvariar 2: Extend Edition is another solid vertical shmup. What sets it apart is the “Buzz System,” allowing players to level up their craft by grazing bullets without getting hit. This risk-reward mechanic not only boosts the player’s firepower but also alters the game’s difficulty dynamically, offering a personalized and evolving experience.\n\nThe game features branching paths, determined by player performance, providing multiple routes and encouraging replayability. The dynamic level design and evolving enemy patterns keep the gameplay fresh and challenging. The game’s trance-inducing electronic soundtrack complements the fast-paced action, creating an immersive experience.\n\nThe Xbox edition known as “Extend Edition” features less slowdown than the original Dreamcast port and replay saves to hard disk, and replay sharing on Xbox Live. It also does not have the “roll” button that the PS2 port includes.\n\nCheck for Psyvariar 2: Extend Edition on eBay\n\nDouble S.T.E.A.L. The Second Clash: $110 – $155\n\nDouble S.T.E.A.L.: The Second Clash is the sequel to Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions (which was on the PS2, Xbox and Gamecube). This sequel was released only in Japan in 2005. Despite this region-specific release, the game is completely in English.\n\nThe series is an action racing game – the original game set in Hong Kong, and this sequel is set in America. Having already freed Hong Kong from the grip of the Yakuza in their last game, the Dragons of the Hong Kong Police Force fly to America to hand Tiger Takagi off to the CIA. Unfortunately, Takagi is barely on American soil for five minutes before his Yakuza cronies spring him, and this time it’s up to the Dragons alone to put him behind bars for good.\n\nPlayers assume the roles of two elite anti-crime task force members, driving a variety of vehicles through the bustling streets. The missions involve intense car chases, stunts, and combating the criminal underworld.\n\nWith the OG Xbox’s commercial struggles in Japan and it being released so late in the platform’s lifespan, it isn’t surprising, this was such a limited release. Now it remains a pricey exclusive.\n\nCheck for S.T.E.A.L.: The Second Clash on eBay\n\nDrihoo: $70 – $193\n\nDrihoo, an obscure Japan-only Xbox title from 2002, has emerged as a foundational influence on FromSoftware’s renowned “Soulsborne” series, which includes titles like Dark Souls, Demon’s Souls, and Bloodborne. Developed and published by Highwaystar Co., Ltd., Drihoo played a pivotal role in the evolution of the franchise due to the involvement of game designer and director KaikÅ Arima. Arima joined FromSoftware after Drihoo’s release and contributed to major titles, including Elden Ring.\n\nDrihoo tells the story of a futuristic miner who excavates the ruins of an ancient civilization looking for treasures and other riches. Drihoo’s deliberate design choices, including slow and deliberate attacks, a dark and claustrophobic setting reminiscent of Soulsborne locales, and an obtuse storytelling style, are highlighted. The game’s narrative, set in a dark underground realm with parallels to real Egyptian mythology, offers an intriguing blend of mystery, exploration, and unique mechanics.\n\nNoteworthy connections between Drihoo and the Soulsborne series include animation priority, a third-person camera perspective, and a health system emphasizing decision-making. The leveling system, currency mechanics, and the emphasis on player exploration without explicit guidance also draw parallels.\n\nDespite its lack of recognition outside Japan, Drihoo has recently garnered attention, thanks to the efforts of Shawn Sackenheim, founder of Delisted Games. Sackenheim has undertaken an exhaustive translation of Drihoo (see the ROMhacking.net listing), aiming to introduce this overlooked title to a wider audience.\n\nCheck for Drihoo on eBay\n\nTakahashi Junko no Mahjong Seminar: $100 – $140\n\nTakahashi Junko no Mahjong Seminar, as the name might suggest, is a Mahjong game featuring the Japanese professional mahjong player Takahashi Junko. The games are focused on providing players with a virtual mahjong experience, often including tutorials and tips from Takahashi Junko herself.\n\nEven though the original Xbox was not very successful in Japan, this game was exclusive to the platform but seems to have had a limited print run. Â It’s a rather under-the-radar collectible at this point, but it routinely has high price tags when it surfaces.\n\nCheck for Takahashi Junko no Mahjong Seminar on eBay\n\nMetal Wolf Chaos $100 – $139\n\nThe Xbox was known for having very poor sales in Japan, but somehow the system still managed to have a fairly high-profile Japanese exclusive in its library. Metal Wolf Chaos is a third-person mecha shooter game developed by FromSoftware (known for their Armored Core and Souls series) in a bit of a partnership with Microsoft in an attempt to boost interest for the Xbox in Japan.\n\nInterestingly enough, the game built up a cult following in the States due to the interesting storyline of a fictional US President digging into a mecha battle with an rebelling military led by the fictional Vice President and the exaggerated patriotic themes that go along with such a premise.\n\nWith it being a Japanese exclusive, it has never really been considered an affordable pickup for North American collectors. Interestingly enough, there was prequel in the form of Murakumo: Renegade Mech Pursuit (without as much bravado in its premise) that was released in North America and is quite affordable (although the reviews also weren’t as favorable).\n\nWith growing popularity, Devolver Digital worked with FromSoftware to localize the game and bring a remaster to the PC, Playstation 4, and the Xbox One in the summer of 2019. So far, it has only reduced the resale values of the Xbox original by 10% to 20%.\n\nCheck for Metal Wolf Chaos on eBay\n\nCheck for Metal Wolf Chaos on Amazon\n\nAdditional Valuable Japanese Releases\n\nTenerezza: $90-$130 (eBay)\n\nRent-A-Hero No. 1: $85-$120 (eBay)\n\nAoi Namida: $90-$100 (eBay)\n\nC.A.T.: Cyber Attack Team: $85-$100 (eBay)\n\nTogue R: $80-$100 (eBay)\n\nDinosaur Hunting: $80-$90 (eBay)\n\nBistro Cupid 2: $70-$85 (eBay)\n\nRarest North American Xbox Games At Affordable Prices\n\nEach of these games are quite hard to find, but routinely sell for $20 or less.
