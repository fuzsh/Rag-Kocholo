        "text": "{Note: RETRO subscribers can adjust which sections of the publication they receive emails from in their Substack account settings.}\n\n‚è∞ Reading Time: 9 minutes\n\nüìï Section: Games\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report analyzes over 800 games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by determining how many times since 2019 a sealed and graded copy of each of these titles either entered a public market and was sold or entered a public market in which it remains available. The intent of this report is to help gamers who are in the sealed-and-graded video game market to make smarter game-collecting decisions.\n\nWhile this report does not run through the full box-and-seal condition of every sealed-and-graded NES game whose sale or pending sale it catalogues, it does detail how many copies of each game are in a ‚Äú9.0‚Äù or better box condition on the WATA grading scale (or the equivalent, a ‚Äú75+‚Äù or better condition, on the VGA grading scale; these figures represent the lowest end of the ‚Äúnear-mint‚Äù category for each grading house).\n\nWhile the scope of this report‚Äîwhich covers nearly 4,500 transactions‚Äîis too broad for seal conditions to be cross-indexed with box conditions, across thousands of transactions RETRO has discovered that relatively few seals in the sealed-and-graded video game market are in worse than ‚ÄúB+‚Äù (‚Äúaverage‚Äù) condition, so while low-quality seals on occasion appear in this submarket, it‚Äôs rare enough that knowing the condition of a sealed box usually gives one enormous insight into the probable value of a given game.\n\n{Note: Any collector who decides to seek out a particular game after studying the rarity and box-condition data below can review the 22 markets covered by this report‚Äîwhich sell well over 95% of the publicly sold sealed-and-graded games in the United States‚Äîto get seal data.}\n\nAn Important Note About the Difference Between the ‚ÄúSealed‚Äù and ‚ÄúComplete-in-Box‚Äù (CIB) NES Markets\n\nIf the rankings below focused on ‚Äúcomplete-in-box‚Äù (CIB) games rather than sealed games, they‚Äôd look quite different‚Äîand the way in which they would look different is important to discuss.\n\nCIB games (defined here) have no proven or identifiable market value in the medium- or long term, so the market for CIB games is largely focused on exploiting potential buyers‚Äô nostalgia for the past. What this means is that the most readily available NES games in the CIB market are almost exclusively well-known, highly successful NES titles. If there‚Äôs a game you remember from your childhood that your best friends from that era also remember, chances are it‚Äôs easily acquired in CIB format‚Äîand you should not pay a premium to acquire it as a CIB title (unless you‚Äôre particularly focused on the condition of the box and its contents; if you are, CIB games can be very expensive).\n\nThe sealed-and-graded video game market is different. Rankings of the most readily available games in this market are topped by three very different types of games: (1) games of varying quality that are associated with a licensed property, (2) games that didn‚Äôt sell at the time they were released and remain not particularly well-regarded, and (3) games that are not associated with a licensed property and are well-regarded.\n\nBecause sealed-and-graded video game collectors are much more likely to be investors, resellers, or speculators than simply nostalgic gamers, they hedge their bets by looking for games with a built-in audience; this often means games tied to established brands.\n\nBut the sealed-and-graded video game market is also flooded with games that are just bad. This means they didn‚Äôt sell well at the time of their release, usually (if not always) for good reason. Many unopened (sealed) copies of such games get sent in for grading.\n\nFinally, there are games that we might call badass. Collectors and investors alike revere these games not because they are linked to a licensed property or simply because they sold well at the time of their release, but because they‚Äôre well regarded as video games.\n\n‚ÄúBrand‚Äù Games: Some Examples\n\nLegacy Franchise Games: Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, Double Dragon, Castlevania, Mega Man, any titles featuring characters from these franchises\n\nSuperhero Games: Marvel, DC\n\nFandom Games: Star Trek games, Star Wars games, Disney games, M.C. Kids (a McDonald‚Äôs tie-in game), Spot: The Video Game (a PepsiCo tie-in game)\n\nMovie Tie-in Games: Back to the Future, Jaws, Friday the 13th, RoboCop, Platoon, Mission Impossible, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Top Gun, Willow, The Untouchables\n\nComic Book Games: Dick Tracy (also a movie tie-in game), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also a TV tie-in game and now a legacy franchise game)\n\nTV Tie-in Games: The Simpsons, Knight Rider, The Three Stooges, Sesame Street, MTV‚Äôs Remote Control, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, Win Lose or Draw, Airwolf\n\nProfessional Sports Games: licensed MLB, NBA, NFL, and WWF games\n\n‚ÄúBad‚Äù Games: Some Examples\n\nThe Adventures of Bayou Billy\n\nBandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach\n\nCybernoid: The Fighting Machine\n\nDash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum\n\nDestination Earthstar\n\nFlight of the Intruder\n\nGotcha! The Sport!\n\nImpossible Mission II\n\nMilon‚Äôs Secret Castle\n\nNES Play Action Football\n\nOperation Wolf\n\nSilent Service\n\nStar Voyager\n\nTaboo: The Sixth Sense\n\n{Note: The games in this category aren‚Äôt uniformly bad, though none are better than middling. What‚Äôs notable about them is that they had a bad run on the video game market and never got enough critical praise to change their fortunes‚Äîin most cases for good reason. You likely shouldn‚Äôt purchase a game in this category unless you‚Äôre getting a very, very good deal on it.}\n\n‚ÄúBadass‚Äù Games: Some Examples\n\nAdventure Island (series)\n\nBattletoads (series)\n\nBionic Commando\n\nGuerilla War\n\nIce Hockey\n\nJackal\n\nKirby‚Äôs Adventure\n\nSection Z\n\nShadowgate\n\nStar Tropics (series)\n\nSuper Spike V‚ÄôBall\n\nTetris (series)\n\n{Note: Some of the games in this category spawned series, but these were short-lived‚Äîand did not become ‚Äúlegacy franchises‚Äù of the sort listed above. In most cases, they‚Äôre NES-only series. Even Tetris fizzled out quickly; Tetris 2 was panned by critics, and didn‚Äôt sell especially well.}\n\nOther Notable Trends\n\nCollecting Trends\n\n‚ÄúBlack Box‚Äù Games: Some sealed-and-graded video game collectors try to collect the first 30 Nintendo games, all of which were released in black boxes. Notably accessible (but highly valued) ‚Äúblack box‚Äù games include Pinball, Kung Fu, Golf, and Excitebike.\n\n‚ÄúBundled‚Äù Games: Some games came bundled with the NES console; while these may be decent games, their ready availability on the market is largely determined by how many gamers purchased them semi-voluntarily (leading to many never opening them). Dragon Warrior and Duck Hunt are two notable examples of this.\n\neBay Sales Trends\n\nSealed and Graded NES Game Prices on eBay\n\n(completed sales in the prior 90 days on eBay, shipping not included, as of September 10, 2021)\n\n$1 to $1,000: 67 ¬∞\n\n$1,001 to $2,000: 22\n\n$2,001 to $3,000: 11\n\n$3,001 to $4,000: 5\n\n$4,001 to $5,000: 2\n\n$5,001 to $6,000: 1\n\n$6,001 to $7,000: 2\n\n$7,001 to $8,000: 1\n\n$8,001 to $9,000: 1\n\n$9,001 to $10,000: 0\n\n$10,000+: 1\n\n¬∞ $1 to $250: 17; $250.01 to $500: 24; $500.01 to $750: 19; $750.01 to $1,000: 7.\n\n{Note: It‚Äôs worth looking at the information above and considering that Goldin Auctions, part of a conglomerate of grading and auction companies that has lately been accused of market manipulation, launched its video game auctions in September with a minimum bid for all items of $1,000‚Äîa clear attempt to push the market upward. While the games at Goldin admittedly are higher-end items, the use of a four-figure minimum bid nevertheless signals a concerted effort to eliminate the bustling three-figure sealed-and-graded market. Indeed, this market has been so healthy that the only option for would-be market manipulators is to kill it administratively, via minimum bids at auction houses that aim to create an expectation of four-figure sales even on sites like eBay. Note that the two-figure‚Äînot three-figure‚Äîmarket for sealed-and-graded NES games was healthy in 2019 and 2020, per Heritage Auctions data, but was dead by the start of 2021, with just 4 sealed-and-graded NES titles selling for <$100 at Heritage this year.}\n\nMethodology\n\nNo CIB games are considered.\n\nNo ‚Äúbox-only‚Äù (often called ‚Äúdisplay-only‚Äù) transactions are considered.\n\nNo ‚Äúrepro‚Äù (reproduction games) are considered.\n\nA very small number of NES-licensed ‚ÄúPAL‚Äù-region (Europe- and Australia-only) games are listed here; please research any relevant state and federal laws to determine if these titles can be legally sold in the United States.\n\nNo ‚Äúloose cart‚Äù (cartridge-only) transactions are considered.\n\nNo distinction is made between earlier and later box releases, or box ‚Äúerrors‚Äù or ‚Äúvariants.‚Äù Though these certainly exist for some titles and do affect market value, the focus here is on the availability of game titles, rather than title variants.\n\nBecause the focus here is on title availability, a game that reappears in a public market a second or subsequent time during the period of review is counted each time it appears in a market, rather than just once.\n\nNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of copies of a game that appeared in the 22 surveyed markets with a box condition of ‚Äú9.0‚Äù or higher (on the WATA scale) or ‚Äú75+‚Äù or higher (on the VGA scale). These grades are considered roughly equivalent.\n\nAs you review the report below, please keep in mind that it‚Äôs never a good idea to invest in any product or collectible beyond your financial means. RETRO discourages irresponsible market speculation‚Äîand offers this report in significant part to reduce the occurrence of such speculation. As a general rule, unless one is extremely fond of a video game and wants to ‚Äúslab‚Äù it for enjoyment purposes, one wouldn‚Äôt want to‚Äîfor investment purposes‚Äîbuy any of the games on the first two lists below. These games are regularly available, and are expected to continue to be regularly available for some time to come. This means they will be near-ubiquitous on the graded-game market at any time in the future you may try to sell them. While many of these NES games are now selling for thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars, and therefore could offer an opportunity for a lucrative short-term flip, the medium- and long-term market prospects for the Top 50 most widely available games are wholly speculative.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the best collecting strategy is to only buy games you can afford and that you‚Äôd be willing to live with the rest of your life‚Äîas you may well do so.\n\n{Note: The fact that Intellivision and Atari 2600 games aren‚Äôt worth nearly as much as NES games tells us that as generations of collectors age, certain markets lose their luster. Eventually those of us who value NES games will make up only a minuscule percentage of the total game-collecting population. In other words, potential buyers get old and die; one mustn‚Äôt forget that.}\n\nPreamble\n\nBelow, 810 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games are ranked by scarcity and box condition across 4,359 transactions. The entry for each game is followed by the number of copies known to have appeared since January 2019 in the 22 public markets listed below, which combined account for more than 95% of the public sales of sealed and graded games in the United States. The number in parentheses is the number of copies on the public market in a ‚Äú9.0‚Äù or better box condition (on the WATA scale) or an ‚Äú75+‚Äù or better condition (on the VGA scale). If there is no parenthetical number after a title, there is no sign of copies of that game in a ‚Äú9.0‚Äù/‚Äú75+‚Äù or better condition.\n\nMarkets Reviewed (22)\n\nAmazon: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nBrian‚Äôs Toys: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nCertifiedLink: transactions through October 19, 2021.\n\nComicConnect: transactions through October 31, 2021.\n\nDave and Adam‚Äôs Card World: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nEBay: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nEtsy: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nEvolve Comics & Collectibles: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nGoldin Auctions: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nHake‚Äôs: transactions through November 4, 2021.\n\nHeritage Auctions: transactions through October 31, 2021.\n\nInstagram (Game Mine): transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nInstagram (Playcadia): transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nMercari: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nMetropolis Comics: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nPrime City Comics: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nPristine Auction: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nReece‚Äôs Rare Comics: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nRetro Raven Games: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nSqueaks Game World: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nVideo Game Sage: transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nWalMart (QFH): transactions through October 25, 2021.\n\nThe Top 25 Most Available Sealed/Graded NES Games\n\n(including all known publicly for-sale or sold copies since 2019, with scarcity rank preceding each game and the number of copies in a ‚Äú9.0‚Äù/‚Äú75+‚Äù or better condition in parentheses)"
