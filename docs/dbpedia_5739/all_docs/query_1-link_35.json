        "text": "Board games have been a part of most cultures and societies throughout history. The oldest board game known to have existed is Senet, which was discovered in Ancient Egypt burials from 3500 BC and involves players moving across a small gridded board with counters.\n\nNowadays, the choice of board games is vast and every year it seems like a new variation of a classic is introduced. Here we take a look at some of the most popular board games from the 20th century, a golden age in the games industry with many family favorites produced for the first time during this period. So come with us as we fawn over the vintage packaging and discover the stories that led to the creation of these popular games.\n\nCirculated informally at first, the game only gained popularity when Pennsylvanian games designer Charles Darrow produced the first commercial version in 1933, which you can see in the first image below. By that time, several changes had been made to Magie’s original version including players being able to raise rents by building houses and hotels, creating a “monopoly” of properties. Darrow produced 5,000 copies at his own expense and sold them in a Philadelphia department store. Hearing of the success, Parker Brothers (an American toy and game manufacturer which later became a brand of Hasbro) bought the rights in 1935 and sales soared. Since then, Monopoly has appeared in 40 countries and 25 foreign languages, with many versions now ditching paper money in favor of an electronic banking system.\n\nAt least 20 million copies of the game have been sold, but Game of the World (as seen below) looks to be a precursor of the widely successful game. Developed by the Decker Brothers of Buffalo, New York in 1899, the pair devised their own version of a question-and-answer game. Game of the World featured questions that were both historical and geographical in nature and it was sold as an educational tool for well-meaning parents to buy their children.\n\nAnspach got in trouble immediately with his game and was sued by General Mills, the then owner of the Monopoly copyrights. A ten-year legal battle began, with Anspach basing his defense on the grounds that the game itself existed in the public domain before Parker Brothers purchased it, and therefore the trademark on the name should be nullified. These origins of the game had previously been kept a secret for many years by the games company. Finally a settlement was reached and Anspach was vindicated allowing him to publish his game.\n\nOriginally it was included in a game set called LUCK - 15 Dice Games. The present-day commercial Yahtzee began when toy and game entrepreneur Edwin S. Lowe filed Yahtzee as a trademark with the US Patent Office on April 19, 1956. The first commercial usage of the name Yahtzee was a few weeks earlier on April 3. Lowe classified his product as a \"Poker Dice Game\" and the objective of the game remains the same, which is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations."
