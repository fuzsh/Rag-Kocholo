We already have 50% female representation in our Executive Team and we are committed to supporting underrepresented communities wherever our consumers, employees and partners live and work. In Seattle for example we contributed to supporting minority owned businesses and facilitating resources to reach the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. While in New York State, we are a founding contributor of a grant assisting hundreds of NYS minority and women owned businesses adjust operations to the impacts of Covid 19.\n\nWithin our own business we are have a number of inclusive Business and Employee Resource Groups, representing diverse viewpoints, experiences and communities. In North America, our 9 Business Resource Groups represent ethnicity, gender, LGBTQIA+, veterans, sustainability and career development.\n\nWe celebrate moderation and continue to address the harmful use of alcohol, expanding our programs that tackle underage drinking, impaired driving and binge drinking.\n\nTo date we have reached over 155m people with messages of moderation from our brands, including Crown Royal - the first spirits brand ever to advertise within a regulation football game.\n\nOur DRINKiQ quiz and site have reached over 500,000 consumers this year with information to help them make responsible choices about drinking alcohol and we support Responsibility.org (U.S) and Educ’alcool (Canada) on initiatives to educate that underage drinking is unsafe, illegal and irresponsible.\n\nA year working in partnership with Black, Latino, and Native American organizations to address alcohol-related harm in the U.S. - In 2022, we established the Multicultural Consortium for Responsible Drinking (MCRD) in partnership with influential members of the Black, Latino and Native American communities, including law enforcement, faith-based and media organizations.\n\nThis past year the MCRD reached over 1.6 million people through various engaging events and community media partnerships that focused on raising awareness on the risks of alcohol-related harm and providing education to these communities.\n\nTo preserve the natural resources on which our long term success depends, we’ve set ourselves an ambitious range of sustainability goals across our supply chain.\n\nThis year we have saved over 113 million litres of water, improving our water use efficiency by 3% this year despite increased production volume. We also doubled the recycled materials in our Seagram’s 7 Crown bottles made from 100% recycled plastic bottles.\n\nIn Kentucky, we opened our first carbon neutral whiskey distillery in the U.S. The distillery in will operate using 100% renewable electricity and zero fossil fuels for bourbon production. And in partnership with American Forests, Bulleit will plant one million trees over the next five years."
