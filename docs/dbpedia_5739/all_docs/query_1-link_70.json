        "text": "The global board games market size was valued at USD 13.06 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 14.37 billion in 2024 to USD 32.00 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 10.52% during the forecast period. North America dominated the board games market with a market share of 41.27% in 2023.\n\nTabletop games are becoming increasingly popular as a source of entertainment and recreational activity. Board games, a tabletop game category, are generally perceived to enhance brain function and self-confidence in individuals. As the name implies, these games employ a board, technically excluding card games from the category. Market participants focus on developing modern products to achieve product differentiation, requiring players to strategize and team up to win. Despite the increasing adoption of modern and themed games, board games will likely retain their prominence worldwide in the coming years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chain operations across industries. Only some end-use sectors, such as travel & tourism, faced extreme losses, while a few sectors, such as pharmaceutical and gaming, registered strong growth throughout this period. The gaming industry, in particular, witnessed considerable sales across e-commerce channels despite the temporary or permanent shutdown of offline distribution channels.\n\nBoard Games Market Trends\n\nRapidly Evolving E-Commerce Shopping Trend to Favor Market Growth\n\nOnline sales contributed significantly to the market growth amid the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 as lockdown restrictions encouraged numerous consumers to shop through e-commerce platforms. In this respect, the growing number of sales channels and product availability on various e-commerce platforms will favor the market expansion in the forthcoming years. Traditional tabletop games, such as Ludo and chess, will likely witness strong demand globally in the coming years.\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nBoard Games Market Growth Factors\n\nRising Number of Board Game Bars and Cafés to Favor Market Expansion\n\nBoard game cafes and restaurants provide various games for customers, which typically bring individuals together. The ease in lockdown restrictions contributed significantly to the popularity and expansion of board game cafes across various countries. The rapid evolution of board game cafes on the back of an expanding number of board game enthusiasts will propel the market growth. Over the years, board game cafes were established in the U.S., Germany, Dubai, and the UAE. Furthermore, several new board game cafes are being launched, thus boosting the demand for board games. For instance, in December 2023, Fox Den Board Game Café, a board game café, was opened in Burnsville, Minnesota, U.S.\n\nAdapting tabletop games from popular series, movies, comics, and video games is expected to accelerate the product adoption globally. For instance, in November 2020, after the release of the Queen’s Gambit, a popular Netflix series, the sales of chess sets by Goliath Games, a Hattem, Netherlands-based games & toys company, increased by over 1,000%. Moreover, chess sales on eBay, a California-based e-commerce platform, increased by 215% in 2020 compared to the November 2019 sales. These theme-based tabletop games appeal to new audiences to try games with exciting and distinct characters, fueling product sales globally.\n\nRising Popularity of Theme-based Games and Growing Industry Support to Trigger Product Demand\n\nTheme-based tabletop games, as the name implies, are based on a specific concept/movie/series. These games are typically popular among children in the age group of 5-12 years as industry participants usually launch theme-based games with characters that are popular among children. For instance, in March 2022, Ravensburger, a German toys & games company, announced the release of a Star Wars-themed tabletop game with characters intended to attract children.\n\nIn September 2023, USAOPOLY, Inc., a California, U.S.-based board game manufacturer, collaborated with Hasbro, a U.S.-based play and entertainment company, to launch a new SCRABBLE: Dr. Seuss Edition. According to the company, the new board game is based on Dr. Seuss' classic children's book collection.\n\nIn September 2023, USAOPOLY launched its new MONOPOLY: The Witcher Edition. According to the company, the game is based on Witcher, a popular fantasy role-playing game.\n\nGrowing industry support for advocating interests, including intellectual property protection & industry standards, of board game publishers and designers will propel the market growth. Industry associations facilitate collaboration and networking among their members, fostering the overall industry growth. Several new associations are being formed to promote tabletop game designers. For instance, in November 2023, The Tabletop Game Designers Association (TTGDA), a new organization, was launched by game designers Sen Foong-Lim, Elizabeth Hargrave, and Geoff Engelstein to support tabletop game designers, including board games.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nConsumer Inclination Toward Alternative Gaming Platforms Might Hamper Market Growth\n\nDigital gaming platforms are gaining widespread popularity across the globe due to the introduction of technologically advanced video games. Furthermore, the rising consumer preference for high-quality graphics and progressive games will positively influence the global demand for video and PC games, thereby hampering board game sales. In addition, the growing penetration of smartphone games may impede the product demand across different countries.\n\nBoard Games Market Segmentation Analysis\n\nBy Game Type Analysis\n\nIncreasing Demand for Multiplayer Economic Theme-Based Games to Trigger Monopoly Sales\n\nBy game type, the market is segmented into monopoly, scrabble, chess, and others. The monopoly segment accounts for the largest market share owing to the increasing demand for multiplayer economic theme-based games.

For instance, in July 2022, Hasbro, a U.S.-based gaming & consumer products company, launched Monopoly and Game of Life in Tamil, an Indian language.\n\nThe growing popularity of strategy-based and educational games will drive the demand for scrabble. An increasing number of national & international competitions and exhibitions will accelerate the popularity of scrabble word games, most notably among millennials and the gen-Z population.
