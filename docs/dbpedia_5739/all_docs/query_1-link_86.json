        "text": "Updated August 11, 2024\n\nby Ronaldo Tumbokon\n\nContents:\n\nThe Positive Effects of Video Games\n\nThe Negative Effects of Video Games\n\nWhere Playing Video Games Doesn’t Have An Effect\n\nAre video games good or bad for you? It can be both\n\nVideo games are frowned upon by parents as time-wasters, and worse, some education experts think that these games corrupt the brain. Playing violent video games are easily blamed by the media and some experts as the reason why some young people become violent or commit extreme anti-social behavior. But many scientists and psychologists find that video games can actually have many benefits – the main one is making kids smart. Video games may actually teach kids high-level thinking skills that they will need in the future.\n\n“Video games change your brain,” according to University of Wisconsin psychologist C. Shawn Green. Playing video games change the brain’s physical structure the same way as do learning to read, playing the piano, or navigating using a map. Much like exercise can build muscle, the powerful combination of concentration and rewarding surges of neurotransmitters like dopamine strengthen neural circuits that can build the brain.\n\nAccording to Marc Palaus, author of the study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, there is a broad consensus in the scientific community that playing video games not only changes how the brain performs, but also its structure.\n\nBelow are the good and bad effects of video games – their benefits and disadvantages, according to researchers and child experts:\n\nThe Positive Effects of Video Games\n\nWhen your child plays video games, it gives his brain a real workout. In many video games, the skills required to win involve abstract and high level thinking. These skills are not even taught at school.\n\nThe main benefits of playing video games involve enhancing mental skills that include:\n\nProblem solving and logic – When a child plays a game such as The Incredible Machine, Angry Birds or Cut The Rope, he trains his brain to come up with creative ways to solve puzzles and other problems in short bursts\n\nHand-eye coordination, fine motor and spatial skills. In shooting games, the character may be running and shooting at the same time. This requires the real-world player to keep track of the position of the character, where he/she is heading, his speed, where the gun is aiming, if the gunfire is hitting the enemy, and so on. All these factors need to be taken into account, and then the player must then coordinate the brain’s interpretation and reaction with the movement in his hands and fingertips. This process requires a great deal of eye-hand coordination and visual-spatial ability to be successful. Research also suggests that people can learn iconic, spatial, and visual attention skills from video games. There have been even studies with adults showing that experience with video games is related to better surgical skills. Also, a reason given by experts as to why fighter pilots of today are more skillful is that this generation’s pilots are being weaned on video games.\n\nPlanning, resource management and logistics. The player learns to manage resources that are limited, and decide the best use of resources, the same way as in real life. This skill is honed in strategy games such as SimCity, Age of Empires, and Railroad Tycoon. Notably, The American Planning Association, the trade association of urban planners and Maxis, the game creator, have claimed that SimCity has inspired a lot of its players to take a career in urban planning and architecture.\n\nMultitasking, simultaneous tracking of many shifting variables and managing multiple objectives. In strategy games, for instance, while developing a city, an unexpected surprise like an enemy might emerge. This forces the player to be flexible and quickly change tactics.\n\nCognitive researcher Daphne Bavalier talks about how video games can help us learn, focus and, fascinatingly, multitask.\n\nQuick thinking, making fast analysis and decisions. Sometimes the player does this almost every second of the game giving the brain a real workout. According to researchers at the University of Rochester, led by Daphne Bavelier, a cognitive scientist, games simulating stressful events such as those found in battle or action games could be a training tool for real-world situations. The study suggests that playing action video games primes the brain to make quick decisions. Video games can be used to train soldiers and surgeons, according to the study. Importantly, decisions made by action-packed video game players are no less accurate. According to Bavelier, “Action game players make more correct decisions per unit time. If you are a surgeon or you are in the middle of a battlefield, that can make all the difference.”\n\nAccuracy – Action games, according to a study by the University of Rochester, train the player’s brain to make faster decisions without losing accuracy. In today’s world, it is important to move quickly without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nStrategy and anticipation – Steven Johnson, author of Everything Bad is Good For You: How Today’s Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter, calls this “telescoping.” The gamer must deal with immediate problems while keeping his long-term goals on his horizon.\n\nSituational awareness – – Defense News reported that the Army include video games to train soldiers to improve their situational awareness in combat. Many strategy games also require the player to become mindful of sudden situational changes in the game and adapt accordingly.\n\nDeveloping reading and math skills – The young gamer reads to get instructions, follow storylines of games, and get information from the game texts. Also, using math skills is important to win in many games that involves quantitative analysis like managing resources.\n\nPerseverance – In higher levels of a game, the player usually fails the first time around, but he keeps on trying until he succeeds and move on to the next level.\n\nPattern recognition – Games have internal logic in them, and the player figures it out by recognizing patterns.\n\nEstimating skills\n\nInductive reasoning and hypothesis testing – James Paul Gee, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that playing a video game is similar to working through a science problem. Like a student in a laboratory, the gamer must come up with a hypothesis. For example, the gamer must constantly try out combinations of weapons and powers to use to defeat an enemy. If one does not work, he changes hypothesis and try the next one. Video games are goal-driven experiences, says Gee, which are fundamental to learning.\n\nMapping – The gamer use in-game maps or build maps on his head to navigate around virtual worlds.\n\nMemory – Playing first person shooter games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield series enables the player to effectively judge what information should be stored in his working memory and what can be discarded considering the task at hand, according to a study published in the Psychological Research.\n\nConcentration – A study conducted by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory reveal that children with attention-deficit disorder who played Dance Dance Revolution improve their reading scores by helping them concentrate.\n\nImproved ability to rapidly and accurately recognize visual information – A study from Beth Israel Medical Center NY, found a direct link between skill at video gaming and skill at keyhole, or laparoscopic, surgery. Doctors who spent at least three hours a week playing video games made about 37 % fewer mistakes in surgery and performed the task 27% faster than non-gaming surgeons. Another study found that people who play video games on a regular basis are better at registering visual data and are therefore quicker visual learners. They are also more resistant to perceptual interference, and are therefore able to learn for a longer period of time in distracting environments.\n\nReasoned judgments\n\nTaking risks – Winning in any game involves a player’s courage to take risks. Most games do not reward players who play safely.\n\nHow to respond to challenges\n\nHow to respond to frustrations\n\nHow to explore and rethink goals\n\nTeamwork and cooperation when played with others – Many multiplayer games such as Team Fortress 2 involve cooperation with other online players in order to win. These games encourage players to make the most of their individual skills to contribute to the team. According to a survey by Joan Ganz Cooney Center, teachers report that their students become better collaborators after using digital games in the classroom.\n\nManagement – Management simulation games such as Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zoo tycoon teach the player to make management decisions and manage the effective use of finite resources. Other games such as Age of Empires and Civilization even simulate managing the course of a civilization.\n\nSimulation, real world skills. The most well known simulations are flight simulators, which attempt to mimic the reality of flying a plane. All of the controls, including airspeed, wing angles, altimeter, and so on, are displayed for the player, as well as a visual representation of the world, and are updated in real time.\n\nNon-English speaking players report learning English by playing games.\n\nVideo games introduce your child to computer technology and the online world – You should recognize that we are now living in a high-tech, sophisticated world. Video games make your child adapt and be comfortable with the concepts of computing. This is particularly important for girls who typically are not as interested in high technology as much as boys.\n\nVideo games allow you and your child to play together and can be a good bonding activity – Some games are attractive to kids as well as adults, and they could be something that they share in common. When your child knows more than you, he can teach you how to play and this allows you to understand your child’s skills and talents.\n\nVideo games make learning fun – Your kid likes games because of the colors, the animation, the eye candy, as well as the interactivity and the challenge and the rewards of winning. The best way to learn is when the learner is having fun at the same time. That’s why video games are natural teachers. Having fun gives your kid motivation to keep on practicing, which is the only way to learn skills. Video games is also capable of making difficult subjects such as math fun.\n\nMore Info:\n\nAre video games good for you?\n\nList of Video Games That May Be Good for the Brain\n\nThe Negative Effects of Video Games\n\nOn the other hand, playing video games can have negative effects, especially when done excessively. The type of games played, as well as individual susceptibility to the effects also count as factors. The bad effects involve mental health issues, physical health problems, cognitive and behavioral issues, as well as social problems. These include:\n\nIncreased Anxiety and Depression – Excessive gaming has been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression, particularly in adolescents and young adults.\n\nGaming Addiction – Recognized as a mental health disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, gaming disorder involves compulsive use of video games, leading to significant impairment in personal, social, and occupational areas.\n\nVision Problems – Extended screen time can cause eye strain, headaches, and may contribute to the development of myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nSedentary Lifestyle – Excessive gaming often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, poor posture, and related health problems like cardiovascular disease.\n\nSleep Disorders – The blue light emitted by screens and the stimulating nature of video games can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or poor-quality sleep.\n\nImpaired Attention – Excessive gaming, particularly action games, can negatively affect attention spans and the ability to focus on non-gaming tasks.\n\nIncreased Aggression – Some studies suggest that violent video games may contribute to increased aggressive behavior, though this is still a topic of debate.\n\nPoor Academic Performance – Excessive gaming can detract from time spent on educational activities, leading to lower academic achievement.\n\nSocial Isolation – Excessive gaming can lead to withdrawal from real-life social interactions, contributing to loneliness and social isolation.\n\nRelationship Strain – Gaming addiction can strain relationships with family members, friends, and romantic partners, sometimes leading to conflicts or breakups.\n\nReduced Impulse Control – High levels of gaming, particularly in younger individuals, may impair the development of executive functions like impulse control and decision-making.\n\nEmotional Numbing – Repeated exposure to violent content in video games may lead to desensitization to violence, making individuals less sensitive to the suffering of others.\n\nMore Info:\n\nAre video games bad for you?\n\nWhere Playing Video Games Doesn’t Have An Effect\n\nMeanwhile, other studies failed to prove that video games have these effects:\n\nA study by neuroscientists from the University of Vienna and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that playing a violent video game had no discernable effect on empathy and underlying brain activity. (However, they added the caveat that this may not be the case for vulnerable subpopulations. According to researcher Claus Lamm “Are children and young people also immune to violence in video games? The young brain is highly plastic, so repeated exposure to depictions of violence could have a much greater effect. But of course these questions are difficult to investigate experimentally without running up against the limits of scientific ethics”\n\nVideo game playing causes no harm to young children’s cognitive abilities – regardless of duration of game play and video game genre.\n\nIn a study published in Psychological Reports, it was found that overall time spent playing video games is not associated with anxiety or stress, at least for college students. This is regardless of the game genre, except for life simulation games where the students experience higher levels of anxiety.\n\nLooking for non-video games to give to your kids?
