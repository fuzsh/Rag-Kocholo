        "text": "Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs) Football Club is located in North London. The club is also known as Spurs. Tottenham's home ground is White Hart Lane. The club motto is Audere est Facere (To dare is to do).\n\nBilly Wingrove, one of the UK’s premier football freestylers, has joined our community coaching team. Starting during the Christmas holidays, Billy will be teaching children aged 6 — 16 years old how to do great ball juggling skills and tricks at freestyle coaching courses held as part of the community scheme’s growing coaching programme in North London, Essex and Hertfordshire.\n\nCommenting on his appointment Billy Wingrove said: “This is great opportunity for me to be part of a superb community coaching programme. Football freestyling is really great fun and becoming more and more popular. I’m really excited about teaching young kids how to improve their skills and tricks.”\n\nKathryn Robinson, Tottenham's Director of Community Development commented: “Last year 250,000 children benefited from our community scheme in a number of different ways and that is a fantastic achievement. However, as part of our commitment to the local community we want to continually develop the coaching programmes we offer. With Billy on board, we can offer something completely unique and new to the children who already enjoy our coaching courses and to young people who may have never thought of taking part in our courses before.”\n\nBilly Wingrove’s talents as a freestyler first came to light when he reached the last four of the first Nike Freestyle event at London's Earl's Court. Since then, Billy has become a familiar face on the football exhibition scene and has also appeared on several TV programmes including Sky One's hit series Dream Team (where he also toured with the cast taking part in celebrity charity matches across the UK), live on Nickelodeon, the Disney channel and Fox Kids. Billy’s first freestyle coaching session will take place at White Hart Lane on December 23rd 2004.\n\nContact Tottenham Hotspur Community on 0870 420 500 to book a Spurs Freestyling course."
