        "text": "The Star hotel, Alex Polizzi's venture showcased on her Channel 5 show, may have put Alfriston on the hospitality map, but it's not the only decent place to stay in this East Sussex village.\n\nAt the other end of the High Street is Wingrove House, itself recently renovated and extended to create a 16-room boutique bolthole. Overlooking the green to the spire of St Andrew's (the renowned 'Cathedral of the Downs'), it puts guests immediately in the centre of village life.\n\nWingrove House is that rarest of finds: an independently owned hotel that's characterful, well run and smart. You'll find traditional country comforts offered with a fresh, contemporary flair.\n\nThe property comprises a Victorian villa (complete with colonial-style, galleried facade) and an adjoining terrace of period, flint-built cottages. In keeping with the main building's heritage, the decor is classic but playfully executed, so it feels up-to-date and stylish.\n\nMounted antlers, touches of tartan and a palette of cool, earthy tones give the overall impression of a traditional hunting lodge.\n\nThat theme is subtly carried to the spacious and bright guest rooms via cushions with game-bird motifs. Seven guest rooms are in the main house, with the remainder carved into the cottages. No two are alike, though nearly all enjoy views of the garden or village green, and each has its own unique quirk.\n\nIn the main house, for example, two rooms share access to the New Orleans-style balcony, while some of the cottage rooms are duplex. Others have huge, free-standing bathtubs. Sizes range across four categories and beyond to the top suite, The Churchill Room.\n\nDays at Wingrove House begin with breakfast in the airy restaurant that doubles in size on fine mornings by opening on to a garden terrace.\n\nTucked behind thick hedges and shaded by olive trees and that galleried veranda, this sunny, south-facing space is equally lovely for lunches or afternoon tea.\n\nIn the evenings, a bistro-style menu covers all the bases with the likes of beef fillet for traditionalists or cauliflower steak for more avant-garde tastes.\n\nMeals here aren't cheap, but their calibre, presentation and generous portions make them excellent value. The breakfast menu ticks all the boxes, from full English to avo on toast.\n\nLocal flavours feature proudly, especially in the form of spirits, soft drinks, coffee and sparkling wines from neighbouring businesses.\n\nTo meet the makers, head up the hill to the cellar door at Rathfinny Wine Estate (rathfinnyestate.com), or take a pleasant, mile-long stroll along the river to Litlington, home to the Long Man Brewery and Liquid Spirit Coffee Roasters.\n\nThere's also an e-bike rental station (cadence cycle.club) to make light work of pedalling up the South Downs, or down to the coast for that most famous of East Sussex landmarks: the Seven Sisters cliffs.\n\nRound off the day back at Wingrove House, relaxing in the cosy lounge â€“ ideally with a celebratory glass of Sussex sparkling."
