        "text": "Sidemen came out on top in a 13-goal thriller as they swept aside YouTube All-Stars 8-5 in the charity match at the London Stadium.\n\nIn front of a sell-out 62,000 fans at the London Stadium, it was YouTube All-Stars who started the brighter of the two teams as Theo Baker, Chris MD and Filly all had chances. Despite their dominance, Sidemen took the lead against the run of play in the ninth minute through Bezinga.\n\nBut Sidemen's advantage didn't last long as YouTube All-Stars equalised on the quarter of an hour mark, with Chris MD slamming the ball home from inside the area. Billy Wingrove's Sidemen went back in front when Miniminter netted, before Chunkz levelled on the stroke of half-time.\n\nNine more goals were scored in the second period as Sidemen came out on top, with Manny scoring a hat-trick, while TBJZL, Wroteshaw and Tareq also found the net for Billy Wingrove's side. Max Fosh, Chunkz and Niko added to YouTube All-Stars' tally in east London.\n\nHere are six talking points from the game.\n\nChris MD brilliance\n\nWith over 5.5million subscribers and many football compilations, many expected Chris to be one of the stars of the show in east London - and he showed exactly why. The 27-year-old scored for YouTube All-Stars in the 14th minute with a terrific solo strike.\n\nChris beat three defenders and jinked into the box, before taking his time and slotting the ball into the bottom corner. It was a terrific finish from the Jersey-born content creator, who impressed throughout and tried to take the game by the scruff of the neck for his side.\n\nNasty Baker injury\n\nIt proved to be a major blow for YouTube All-Stars when Theo Baker went down injured in the 25th minute. Baker, who had hip surgery last September, collapsed on the floor in agony and was forced to be stretchered off.\n\nBaker had been lining up a shot from the edge of the box before landing awkwardly. He was replaced to a standing ovation from the London Stadium crowd and he now faces an anxious wait to see the extent of the issue.\n\nKSI 'fight'\n\nKSI jokingly fought three YouTubers before saving a penalty during the Sidemen charity match.\n\nKSI played as a goalkeeper for the first time due to his upcoming fight with Tommy Fury. KSI will take on the Love Island favourite in a boxing match next month. The YouTuber-turned-rapper-turned-boxer decided to play in net to avoid injuring himself outfield, but he still evade a number of punches and kicks from three opposing players.\n\nChunkz, IShowSpeed and Kai Cenat all tried to get under KSI's grill after a penalty was given against Sidemen FC. Thankfully, the three YouTubers weren't actually attacking KSI and it was all just a bit of fun to entertain the millions of fans watching the live stream.\n\nGoldbridge in the dugout\n\nEarlier this week, Mark Goldbridge was optimistic about his side's chances and he saw YouTube All-Stars dominate large spells of the first-half at the London Stadium. He told talkSPORT that if his team could have a spine they would have a real chance of winning, but his side's second-half defensive showing left a lot to be desired.\n\nThey conceded five goals after half-time, with Manny scoring a hat-trick, while TBJZL and Wroteshaw also finding the back of the net for Sidemen. Despite that, YouTube All-Stars were a major threat going forward and Goldbridge's style of play in attack was clear to see. They were free-flowing and often would like to the ball out wide, with Chris dictating the game in midfield.\n\nSidemen clinical\n\nAlthough it was not their best performance, the Sidemen were clinical in the final third and did what they needed to secure their fourth victory in five charity matches. In fact, the YouTube All-Stars actually notched up a higher xG with 3.5, compared to 3.1 from Sidemen.\n\nAnd Sidemen also only had 12 shots on target, scoring eight of them. Manny, in particular, was outstanding in the second-half as he scored a quick-fire hat-trick, with his second the pick of the bunch. But Wroteshaw arguably scored the goal of the game with a belter from 25 yards.\n\nYouTuber slammed\n\nKai Cenat has been criticised for telling Nada she looked \"peng\" during the Sidemen charity match.\n\nCenat, who has 4.67million subscribers on his main channel, spoke to pitchside reporter Nada - who is also a radio presenter - during a water break, with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees. She asked him: \"The heat is unimaginable. Kai, can you tell people about the heat right now?\"\n\nKai replied: \"Well before I get to the heat, I would actually like to say that you look absolutely peng today... you look absolutely peng today!\"\n\nNada thanked Kai for his remark, but that didn't stop fans on social media questioning it. They've accused him of trying to \"rizz up\" the commentator. \"Rizz\" is a slang word that means flirting, with Kai often using the expression on social media.\n\n\"Kai didn't come for the football, he just came here to rizz that interviewer,\" tweeted one social media user. Another added: \"Kai really trying to rizz up the reporter.\"\n\nThe commentators tried to make light of the situation, with one uttering: \"So much rizz on display there from Kai.\""
