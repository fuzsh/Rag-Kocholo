        "text": "In September 2017, Donovan Hunt - like many people his age - enrolled at college. Four months later, his life changed.\n\nAged 16, he won the Fifa FUT Champions Cup - a professional esports tournament with a top prize of nearly Â£17,500.\n\nHunt - known as F2Tekkz - has since met his idol Steven Gerrard, beaten England forward Raheem Sterling on Fifa, played football against Kaka at Old Trafford and won more than Â£200,000 in prize money.\n\nNow the ePremier League champion is among the favourites for this weekend's Fifa eWorld Cup Grand Final, an event watched by more than 29 million people, external last year.\n\nHunt, 18, lives with his family in the Midlands. He was born in Devon but moved north with his family because a slow internet connection was affecting his gaming.\n\nHe started playing Fifa at the age of five, but it wasn't until two years ago he realised how good he was.\n\nAnd then he won his first major event - in Barcelona.\n\n\"I had about 300 Twitter followers before the event, but when I got back I'd gained about 50,000 - it was crazy,\" he says.\n\n\"Before that tournament I was just a normal kid at college. When I got home, some guy came up to me, and was like: 'Aren't you that kid who won the Fifa tournament?'\"\n\nFollowing his success in Barcelona, Donovan received offers from a number of professional esports teams - but had his heart set on just one.\n\nThe F2 Freestylers - Billy Wingrove and Jeremy Lynch - are a football freestyle duo whose skills videos on YouTube have had nearly two billion views.\n\n\"The F2 wanted to get into esports and one of the reasons they approached me was because I do a lot of skills in-game,\" says Donovan.\n\n\"They're all about skills and my style fits their brand. I knew I wanted to sign with them.\"\n\nAfter joining the F2, Donovan received a surprise video containing a welcome message from former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard., external\n\n\"I just sat there staring at the video and I don't think I said a word,\" he says.\n\n\"I was like: 'What? Gerrard has messaged me?!'\n\n\"Before joining F2 I never thought I'd meet players like Steven Gerrard. I'm a Liverpool fan and he's every Liverpool fan's hero.\"\n\nDonovan is widely recognised as one of the world's best Fifa 19 players.\n\nReaching that level has taken hours upon hours of practice.\n\n\"When a new Fifa game comes out, I play about 10 hours a day, every day,\" he says.\n\n\"But after a couple of months you only need to play a couple of hours per day to keep on top of the game.\"\n\nSome of his family weren't completely on board with his professional gaming aspirations at first.\n\n\"There was a corner shop that had just been built outside my house when I lived in Devon,\" he says.\n\n\"My dad was like: 'Go and get a job there.' I was like: 'No, I need to keep playing Fifa.'\n\n\"My mum's supported me the whole time and my dad came around when I qualified for my first major.\"\n\nThe rewards are big at the top level of esports.\n\n\"When I go to the tournaments, I don't really care about the money,\" he says. \"I just want to win the trophy.\n\n\"I think the first thing I bought was a new hoodie. But I also paid for a holiday for my mum to San Francisco - she'd wanted to go there her whole life.\"\n\nNow, Donovan heads to the O2 Arena with only one thing on his mind - winning the biggest tournament on the calendar, which would earn him more than Â£200,000.\n\nIf the past year is anything to go by, you wouldn't bet against him achieving his dream.\n\nA version of this feature was first published in January 2019."
