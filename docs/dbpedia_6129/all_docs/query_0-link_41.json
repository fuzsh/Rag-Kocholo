        "text": "Jeremy Lynch is both a footballer & football freestyler who reached the Semi-Finals of Series 2 of Britain's Got Talent. Before Britain's Got Talent, Lynch had played for Arsenal.\n\nIn his audition, he performed to 'Crazy in Love' by Beyoncé. He balanced a football on his head and on the back of his neck, before circling it round his neck. He then performed some kick-ups, before balancing the ball on his forehead. He then finished his performance with some kick-ups while laying down. Piers described him as 'The first [football tricks act], who's turned it into a proper entertainment act', with Simon adding 'I've got to say Jeremy, your the best [act] we've seen in London so far'.\n\nIn the Semi-Finals, he performed to 'A Little Less Conversation' by Elvis Presley. He danced around the ball, performed some skilled kick-ups, span the ball around the stage whilst trapped at his feet and performed kick-ups as he lay down, yet the ball kept rolling off of the stage and Jeremy needed to constantly recover it. His performance was buzzed by Piers & Simon. Amanda remarked 'You recovered brilliantly [and] your performance was really entertaining for me', with Simon adding 'Your a showman and I think you do have star potential'.\n\nBefore BGT[]\n\nIn 2007 Lynch appeared in a documentary film entitled In the Hands of the Gods. The film followed himself, fellow BGT auditionees Paul Wood, & Mikey Fisher, alongside Sami Hall, and Danny Robinson. In it, they attempted to raise money by showcasing their free-styling skills in order to fund a trip to Buenos Aires to meet their idol Diego Maradona.\n\nAfter BGT[]\n\nLynch is now one half of the duo of F2 Freestylers, with the second half being Billy Wingrove. The pair are well known for producing videos upon YouTube, with their YouTube Channel having over twelve million subscribers. As well as earning money from YouTube's ad-revenue monetisation, Wingrove and Lynch's videos feature brand endorsements; with previous sponsorship deals including Adidas and Carlsberg.\n\nIn 2017, the pair led a team of YouTubers and ex-professional footballers competing under the name Tekkers Town in the Wembley Cup against Hashtag United, and in 2018, they entered the competition as F2 FC, winning in the final against Rebel FC.\n\nAdditionally in 2017 Lynch signed a short-term semi-professional contract with Billericay Town, playing in the Isthmian Premier League. Lynch's first goal for the club registered on October 3rd 2017, scoring Billericay's fifth goal in a 6–1 win against Hungerford Town in the FA Cup. After being absent from the team for several matches in late 2017, the club revealed on Twitter that it had been agreed with Lynch that his work as part of the F2Freestylers would take priority over playing for Billericay.\n\nIn 2018, Wingrove and Lynch produced a YouTube original series, titled F2 Finding Football, which was streamed on YouTube Premium. The series, which features a number of celebrity guests, was well received and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for an Outstanding Travel and Adventure Program as well as two Streamy Awards.\n\nIn 2018, Wingrove and Lynch established a football management agency, F2 Talent, despite neither being a licensed intermediary with the FA. The agency courted controversy over the use of a photo publicising a newly-signed young player, violating the FA's policy to not promote players under the age of 15. Additionally in 2018, the duo founded F2 Revolution, an agency aimed at recruiting 'social talent'.\n\nThe duo have been invited to perform at a number of high-profile footballing events, including the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony. They have featured in several charity football events, including Soccer Aid in 2018, where Lynch scored for the England side, and in 2019 in which Lynch scored twice, once again for England.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Wingrove and Lynch served as ambassadors for Santander UK. They produced a series of videos designed to improve numeracy and increase physical activity, in line with UK curriculums for students unable to attend school during lockdown. In early September 2020, Lynch competed in Soccer Aid for UNICEF in support of Save Generation Covid upon the World XI team, who ultimately won the match.\n\nIn late February 2021, Lynch appeared on 'The Mo Gilligan Podcast' on Mo Gilligan's YouTube channel. He discussed going up against professional footballers in 2020's Soccer Aid, perfecting his craft of Football Free-styling, and the impact of the F2freestylers upon his life."
