        "text": "Freestylers don't quite walk around with toothpicks on their lips, tipping ten-gallon Stetsons to the ladies and quaffing whisky at nine in the morning, but they are about as renegade as football gets outside of Chris Waddle's local barber's.\n\nRemember Mr Woo's T-Mobile-sponsored keepy-uppys during Euro 2004? That's them. They can use their feet, hands, neck, back, that slightly clammy area behind their knee - just about anything as long as they keep the ball in the air. \"Basically it's about expressing yourself,\" says one of the UK's finest, Billy Wingrove. \"You've got this piece of leather and it's a question of what you can do with it to make it look exciting. You're using your body and agility and skills to create moves and entertain.\"\n\nAll very spiritual, no doubt, but Wingrove has just been given a contract by Tottenham Hotspur to flick and flip his finest as part of their coaching courses and show off his sprightly shenanigans at White Hart Lane. Is freestyling going establishment?\n\nUntil now, freestyling has shared a lot with the French-originated parkour, or free-running. It's undertaken by wilful misfits; it almost requires a secret handshake and an online pseudonym; it is filmed on grainy handhelds and set to edgy urban sounds on Channel 4, and broadcast dangerously late for a school night. Kids assemble in the shadow of tenements to show off their burgeoning repertoire, while a handful of the sport's originators, who are able to earn their crust as exhibition masters, are talked of with hushed reverence.\n\n\"There are about six of us around England and Wales who consider ourselves professional freestylers,\" says Wingrove. \"We'll all go for auditions together and do competitions as a team. We are the best, but there are plenty of other people who are starting to get into it. Since they've seen it on the telly, they've got into it as a fun thing, like a kind of street football.\"\n\nThat initial exposure was thanks largely to Nike, who took freestyling and inked it thickly onto the map with a series of adverts featuring the magician's touch of Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry. They even started an annual freestyling competition, though that has now finished and Nike have moved on to a new plaything, breakdancing.\n\n\"Nike did sort of pick it up and then get bored, but we can't complain,\" says Wingrove, who finished runner-up in Nike's inaugural competition. \"They got people interested, got people to treat it like a sport and to love it. Plus, these things are pretty cyclical. They'll probably pick it up again soon and it'll be like new. People will fall in love with it all over again.\"\n\nThat's another notion that puts freestyling firmly in line with parkour: its participants have that uniquely male obsession with having the best darn Russian sequence there is; conversation on another topic is limited and quickly diverted via well-trodden routes. It also requires hours of practice, often with nothing more than a ghettoblaster and a trusty hip hop compilation for company.\n\n\"I can spend anything upwards of 20 hours a week with the ball at my feet,\" says Wingrove, who can often be found in Tottenham's Centre of Excellence, ghettoblaster plugged in, only his castigations punctuating the appropriately urban soundtrack. \"I might practice for one or two hours in the morning, then go and coach for a few hours, then perform in front of hundreds of people.\n\n\"Whatever it is it all counts, I'm always improving. And the bonus is, it's my job!\"\n\nAnd, like parkour, the rewards aren't just fiscal. It's amazing just how much gratification a successful sequence of moves can bring, but finally pulling off that Touzani ATW [that's a really, really snazzy stepover, to you and me] off can make hours, even days of repetition and failure feel worth it. And while the kids in the street chase professional standards, the professionals are all chasing one man: Mr Woo.\n\n\"We call him the Zinedine Zidane of freestyling - even if you're David Beckham, you look up to him,\" Wingrove explains. \"He's the ultimate role-model. Everything he does looks so natural, that's the level we're all trying to get to.\"\n\nWingrove looks natural enough as he flicks the ball up in the air and keeps it there via a string of exquisitely crafted moves. Even trying to pick up some of his most simple ideas is a frustrating (not to say embarrassing and ungainly) exercise. But he insists it takes virtually military dedication to keep it up.\n\n\"It's hard work,\" he says. \"But even nailing one move gives you so much confidence. If a child can stick at it for long enough to learn one trick, I guarantee you that they will be hooked.\n\n\"They'll want to know where they went wrong, and if you can get that across to them, and give them the right encouragement when they get it right, that'll make sure they have the right attitude, that they become determined to keep going and keep getting better.\"\n\nGetting better, of course, brings bragging rights. Which takes us back to our original question: has Wingrove forgone the chance to show off by signing up for the 9-5?\n\n\"It doesn't really work like that,\" he laughs. \"We're still growing as a sport, so the others can see that this position gives me recognition, more exposure.\n\n\"I'm the face of a Premiership club, I've got that feather in my bow. Plus, I'm a lifelong Spurs fan, so they know I'm made up about it.\n\n\"The other week I was showing Robbie Keane how to do a trick,\" he adds, beaming from ear to ear. \"Then Fredi Kanoute comes over and asks me to show him something else.\n\n\"It's like being in the first team. I feel like I've reached my goal: I'm doing what I was born to do, at Spurs.\""
