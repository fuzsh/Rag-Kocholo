        "text": "Lynch, who has played in Arsenal's Academy, has agreed to play for the Isthmian Premier League club this season, alongside his other footballing commitments.\n\nThe talented trickster hit the big time after forming the F2 Freestylers with Billy Wingrove. The pair have more than six million YouTube subscribers and have filmed with some of the best footballers on the planet.\n\nLynch could now make his debut for Town in this afternoon’s FA Cup match against Didcot Town, which kick-off at 12.30pm.\n\nAnd he said he was hugely excited to get involved.\n\n“I wanted to be involved and train at a good standard,” said Lynch, who is playing in the Wembley Cup at the start of October – a match between YouTube talents and legends of international football.\n\n“The set-up is unbelievable so I spoke with (manager) Glenn (Tamplin) and the lads are unreal and are so friendly.\n\n“Glenn and I are both believers and businessmen. I will give this all I can.\n\n“To be around these guys and being able to work on my fitness with them is very exciting.”\n\nAnd he said he had been following Billericay’s rise since Tamplin took over the club at the end of last year.\n\n“I can’t turn on the radio without hearing this guy,” he laughed. “This is the start of something amazing.\n\n“I don’t know if you will see some tricks today,” he added. “Who knows!”\n\nAnd manager Tamplin said he was hugely pleased to add Lynch to his squad, having been introduced six weeks ago by Town midfielder Jamie O’Hara.\n\n“Jamie O’Hara introduced us and we hit it off straight away,” said Tamplin.\n\n“Jezza was at a higher level than I expected him to be to be honest.\n\n“I knew he did amazing tricks but I didn’t know how good a player he was.”"
