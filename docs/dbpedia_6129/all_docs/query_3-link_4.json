This year's charity match takes place at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge and will be broadcast live on ITV on Sunday night.\n\nAn England and World XI, consisting of a host of famous faces, will take to the pitch to raise cash for the charity UNICEF.

His role included performing at half-time breaks and corporate events.\n\nBilly's role at Soccer Aid as skills coach is to help the celebrity players develop the skills they will need to play in their positions.\n\nPlayers for the England team include Sir Mo Farah and Steven Bartlett joining footballing legends Jermain Defoe, Jill Scott (Captain), David James (Professional Goalkeeper), Gary Cahill, Joe Cole and Karen Carney.\n\nThere will also be stars Sam Thompson, Bobby Brazier, Eden Hazard, Stuart Broad, Miniminter, Paddy McGuiness (Celebrity Goalkeeper), David Seaman (Goalkeeping Coach), Tom Grennan, Jack Wilshere, Alex Brooker, Erin Doherty, Steven Bartlett, Danny Dyer, Theo Walcott and Ellen White on the pitch.\n\nFrank Lampard joins Harry Redknapp and Robbie Williams as England manager and facing them down will be Mauricio Pochettino, returning as manager for Soccer Aid World XI.\n\nThe live show will be hosted by UNICEF UK Ambassador Dermot O’Leary, who will be joined by Alex Scott with Sam Matterface and Iain Stirling commenting again."
