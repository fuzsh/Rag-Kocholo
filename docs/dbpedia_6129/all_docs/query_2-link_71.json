        "text": "TRANSACTIONS\n\nIn Triple-A, The Minnesota Twins signed free agent RHP Giovanny Gallegos and assigned him to the Saints. The Twins also sent IF Kyle Farmer to CHS Field to begin a rehab assignment.\n\nA lot of roster movement has happened down in Fort Myers in the past two days as recent draft picks started being assigned to the rosters of the Mighty Mussels and FCL Twins. On Tuesday those official moves were 3B Jay Thomason, OF Caden Kendle, and C Derek Bender being assigned to the Mighty Mussels.\n\nSAINTS SENTINEL\n\nColumbus 7, St. Paul 4\n\nBox Score\n\nRight-hander Adam Plutko was coming off his longest outing of the season with the Saints in his last start, but ended up with his shortest in this one.\n\nThe Clippers put together four singles and a double in an extended top of the first, putting an end to this one for Plutko after 43 pitches. He was charged with four earned runs, walked nobody, and struck out nobody in his lone inning.\n\nRyan Jensen came on for the second and went the next two innings. He gave up two earned runs on three hits and a walk. He struck out three. Nick Wittgren went the next three, allowing four hits, one earned run, and striking out three.\n\nThe Saints finally got on the scoreboard in the bottom of the seventh, against the major-league rehabbing Sam Hentges of the Cleveland Guardians. Rylan Bannon was hit by a pitch in front of a Wynton Bernard single. Another hit batter (Anthony Prato) led to a bases-loaded walk from Edouard Julien that made it 7-1 Clippers. Julien’s walk made it the 32nd straight game with the Saints where he has reached base.\n\nSaints relievers Matt Bowman (2 IP, H, BB, 2 K) and Hobie Harris (1 IP, K) kept the visitors off the scoreboard for the final three innings.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth the Saints finally showed some life. Alex Isola drew a walk. Prato followed with a double. Edouard Julien then launched his sixth Saints home run of the season off the batter’s eye in center field, making it 7-4 with one out. Payton Eeles then hit a single before the Saints rally came to an end.\n\nDaShawn Keirsey Jr. was the only Saints hitter with multiple knocks, finishing 2-for-4 with a triple. The rehabbing Kyle Farmer played second base and finished 0-for-4 with a pair of strikeouts from the second spot in the batting order. As a team the Saints were just 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position, and left nine men on base.\n\nWIND SURGE WISDOM\n\nWichita 5, Corpus Christi 4 (10 innings)\n\nBox Score\n\nThe Wind Surge got on the scoreboard first in the opening frame, as Ricardo Olivar and Carson McCusker put together a mini two-out rally with a single and RBI double respectively, for a 1-0 lead.\n\nStarting pitcher Christian MacLeod did most of the heavy lifting from there, putting together five strong innings. He scattered just three hits and one walk, while striking out eight Hooks hitters. He threw 82 pitches in the game, with 57 going for strikes (70%), including a solid 12 swinging.\n\nHe left the game with a 3-1 lead, as Wichita added more run support in the top of the fourth. Tanner Schobel clubbed a solo home run. Noah Cardenas followed with a double and was driven in by a single from Jorel Ortega. Schobel added his second home run of the game in the sixth, putting the Wind Surge up by three.\n\nUnfortunately for MacLeod, reliever Cody Laweryson wasn’t able to keep runners off the base paths in the sixth. He ended up charged with three runs (1 earned) on three hits and a walk in 2/3 of an inning, knotting up the game at four. John Stankiewicz got the final out with no further damage.\n\nThe score remained tied for the rest of regulation, as Mason Fox (1+ IP, H, 4 BB, K) and Taylor Floyd (3 IP, 2 K) kept the Hooks from taking advantage of any baserunners.\n\nIn the top of the 10th, Ortega wasted little time as his RBI single as the first batter of the inning put the Wind Surge back in front 5-4. They may have been able to add to that lead for Floyd, but both Ortega and Luke Keaschall, after a single of his own, were thrown out trying to steal second base.\n\nFloyd picked up the win with a one-two-three bottom of the tenth, striking out the final two hitters of the game to punctuate the victory.\n\nBoth Schobel (2-for-4, 2 R, 2 HR, 2 RBI) and Ortega (2-for-4, 2 RBI, K, SB) had multiple hits in the win. Jake Rucker added a double.\n\nKERNELS NUGGETS\n\nCedar Rapids 5, Peoria 7\n\nBox Score\n\nTop prospect Walker Jenkins got the Kernels going to lead off the game, knocking his first double in the Midwest League.\n\nTwo batters later Rubel Cespedes traded spots with a double of his own for the game’s first run. Poncho Ruiz followed with an RBI single, and Cedar Rapids had an early 2-0 lead.\n\nJeremy Lee was on the bump for the good guys, and he worked the first five innings. After a one-two-three bottom of the first, Lee gave up a pair of singles in the second inning that would turn into the Chiefs first run of the game.\n\nIn the top of the fourth, the Kernels offense got that one back and more. Nick Lucky drew a one-out walk, and moved to third on a Misael Urbina single. Jenkins then came up with two outs and delivered his second double of the game, driving in both runners to make it 4-1.\n\nLee got bit by singles again in the bottom of the frame, with three of those and a sac fly making it 4-3. He finished a scoreless fifth and was charged three earned runs on five hits. He struck out three.\n\nGabriel Yanez came on for the sixth and worked two scoreless, hitless innings. Back out for the eighth he allowed a leadoff single and a change was made. Nolan Santos proceeded to give up three straight hits and a wild pitch that put Peoria out front 6-5. Yanez was charged with one earned run in two-plus innings. He gave up one hit and struck out one. Santos got hit with the loss and blown save, allowing three earned runs on four hits in his lone inning. His defense did let him down some, as a lazy fly ball into short center field ended up failing between three defenders, and a subsequent throw home was cut off when it likely would have beat the runner by quite a bit.\n\nIn the top of the ninth, Gabriel Gonzalez led off with a single, bringing the tying run to the plate. Cespedes hit one hard to the right side, but a diving play got him at first, and Gonzalez thought the ball got through, and ended up being caught between second and third for the second out. Kevin Maitan then went down on strikes to end the game.\n\nThe Kernels got multiple hits from Jenkins (2-for-5, R, 2 2B, 2 RBI, K), Gonzalez (2-for-5, K), Ruiz (2-for-4, R, RBI) and Urbina (2-for-3, R, RBI, BB, K), but weren’t able to string together enough of their 11 hits as a team. Nate Baez added a double to the effort.\n\nMUSSEL MATTERS\n\nFort Myers 9, Jupiter 7\n\nBox Score\n\nThe Mighty Mussels got an influx of new talent for this week’s series with the Hammerheads, and they came up big as a group to help push them to a victory after a brief rain delay on Tuesday.\n\nBefore that happened though, starting pitcher Cesar Lares was ambushed by Jupiter for three runs in the bottom of the first inning. Lares would go on to finish 3 2/3 innings, allowing four earned runs on five hits and three walks, while striking out three.\n\nIn the top of the second the first of the new guys made his presence felt. Third round draft pick Khadim Diaw got the inning started with a single. After a walk to Yasser Mercedes, Rixon Wingrove brought them all in with his eighth home run of the season, tying it at three.\n\nIn the top of the fourth it was the 33rd overall pick in June’s draft, Kyle DeBarge, who tied the game at four with an RBI single. In the fifth, second round pick Billy Amick led off with a single. Later in the inning he and Diaw would come around to score on a wild pitch and sac fly off the bat of fourth round pick Jaime Ferrer.\n\nDeBarge struck again with an RBI triple in the sixth to put them ahead by one, before fifth round selection Caden Kendle brought him in with a single. Diaw followed with an RBI single as well and the Mussels had a 9-6 lead.\n\nRelievers Ben Ethridge (2/3 IP, H, 2 ER, 2 BB), Jack Noble (2 2/3 IP, H, BB, 4 K), Samuel Perez (1 IP, H, ER, BB), and Xander Hamilton (1 IP, H, BB, K) finished off the game for Fort Myers with 5 1/3 total innings.\n\n17th round pick Jay Thomason also chipped in two hits, making his own mark among everyone playing their first game from the most recent draft class.\n\nAmick, Mercedes, and Kendle all had doubles. Diaw and Mercedes each stole a base. Wingrove’s three-run homer led the day in the RBI department.\n\nDOMINICAN DAILY\n\nDSL Twins 3, DSL NYY Bombers 4\n\nBox Score\n\nTwins starting pitcher Santiago Rojas faced the minimum through his first three innings, allowing only a walk that got erased on double-play. But the Bombers squad finally got to him in the fourth. After a pair of walks, a couple hits, and the game’s first run, Rojas’ day was finished. He completed 3 1/3 innings, and ended up charged with two earned runs on two hits and three walks. He struck out three.\n\nThe Twins lineup finally came through in the top of the fifth with three runs of their own to take the lead. Ramiro Dominguez led off with a double. Ricardo Paez brought him home with an RBI single. Later in the frame a strikeout should have ended the inning, but it turned into a wild pitch that allowed Paez to score and Luis Rodriguez to reach first. Rodriguez then stole second and third base. After a walk to Merphy Hernandez, a throwing error on his own steal attempt put the Twins in front.\n\nAnderson Ramos was the Twins reliever summoned back in the fourth inning, and he would end up finishing the game. He allowed one inherited runner to score in that fourth inning, but delivered a scoreless fifth after the Twins had taken the lead. A two-out walk in the sixth spelled disaster, however. Two singles and an error from the Twins catcher put the Yankees back out front, and the Twins went down in order in their final at-bat. Ramos worked 2 2/3 innings, giving up two runs (one earned) on two hits and three walks, while striking out three.\n\nThe Twins managed just three hits as a team, with Dominguez collecting two of them. They finished 1-for-5 with runners in scoring position, and left only three men on base in the game. Hernandez stole his 27th base of the season.\n\nTWINS DAILY MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS OF THE DAY\n\nPitcher of the Day - Christian MacLeod, Wichita Wind Surge (5 IP, 3 H, ER, BB, 8 K)\n\nHitter of the Day - New Guys, Fort Myers Mighty Mussels (10-for-25, 6 R, 2 2B, 3B, 5 RBI)\n\nTanner Schobel, Wichita Wind Surge (2-for-4, 2 R, 2 HR, 2 RBI)\n\nPROSPECT SUMMARY\n\nCheck out the Prospect Tracker for much more on our recently-updated Twins Top 20 prospects after seeing how they did on Tuesday.\n\n#1 – Walker Jenkins (Cedar Rapids) – 2-for-5, R, 2 2B (2), 2 RBI, K\n\n#2 – Brooks Lee (Minnesota) – 1-for-3, 2B (2), K\n\n#4 – Luke Keaschall (Wichita) – 1-for-5, K\n\n#7 – Gabriel Gonzalez (Cedar Rapids) – 2-for-5, K\n\n#12 – Brandon Winokur (Fort Myers) – 0-for-2 (was pinch hit for in the fourth inning)\n\n#14 – Yasser Mercedes (Fort Myers) – 1-for-4, R, 2B (1), BB, K, SB (3)\n\n#16 – Kyle DeBarge (Fort Myers) – 2-for-5, R, 3B (1), 2 RBI\n\n#17 – Tanner Schobel (Wichita) – 2-for-4, 2 R, 2 HR (7), 2 RBI\n\nWEDNESDAY’S PROBABLE STARTERS\n\nColumbus @ St. Paul (1:07 PM CDT) - TBD\n\nWichita @ Corpus Christi (6:35 PM CDT) - RHP Andrew Morris (5-3, 2.14 ERA)\n\nCedar Rapids @ Peoria (6:35 PM CDT) - RHP Darren Bowen (2-6, 6.17 ERA)\n\nFort Myers @ Jupiter (5:30 PM CDT) - RHP Charlee Soto (0-4, 5.64 ERA)\n\nDSL Twins @ DSL NYY Yankees (9:00 AM CDT) - completion of game suspended on 7/22.\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions and discuss Tuesday’s games!\n\nInterested in learning more about the Minnesota Twins' top prospects?
