        "text": "Lockdown boredom produced a host of viral internet challenges, from ping-pong ball trick shots to using rolls of toilet paper for keepie-uppies.\n\nGlobal stars including Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Bruno Fernandes all tried the juggling challenge in tandem with grassroots players trying to take the edge off the tediousness of a summer without football.\n\nFor former Arsenal and Birmingham City player Freda Ayisi, the challenge was the start of a new project away from her playing career in the FA Women’s Championship as she began posting videos of trick shots and freestyle skills online.\n\nNow nicknamed “the female Berbatov” after a video went viral of her controlling a ball dropped from a fourth-storey balcony, the Lewes midfielder’s lockdown habit has seen her garner attention from Ian Wright through her challenge and tutorial videos.\n\n“It wasn’t random because I have always done little tricks, messing around in the park but I never recorded them or uploaded them,” the 27-year-old tells The Athletic. “I have footage from when I was younger but never uploaded it. It came about during lockdown when it was that really boring stage, when we were only allowed out once a day, so I was just taking the mick saying, ‘Who remembers this old football skill?’ People just started liking the videos and then I did one that just blew up.\n\n“There’s been a few videos I have been shocked at. I did a free kick one the other day and that’s been popular on Twitter and Instagram. The most popular one is probably with Ian Wright reacting to my tricks, that’s the best one and I enjoyed that one the most. It’s a ‘wow’ moment and it made me laugh. He picked it up, watched it and reacted — I didn’t know him before.”\n\nAyisi’s videos take her to pitches across south London on her days off from training and playing with Lewes, who are seventh in the Championship table.\n\nShe joined the Sussex outfit from London City Lionesses in the summer after spells at Leicester City and Birmingham City, whom she joined from Arsenal in 2015 in search of “more first-team opportunities”.\n\nSince starting her own YouTube channel and gaining support from Wright, her social media following has grown as she tries to show a side of herself outside of the setting of elite-level football.\n\n“Some of the tricks that I’m doing, you wouldn’t do on the pitch,” she says. “A few you can try but you wouldn’t risk it in a game. The practice does become useful in terms of tight control and keeping the ball close to your feet to go past players. It allows people to see me off the pitch as well, show that it’s not always about being serious. This is me at the park messing around like I’m a little kid again. It is fun as well, so it’s good for me mentally and good for others to see as well. Freedom away from the world of professional football.\n\n“A lot of places that we film now are not too far from where I grew up and I know most of the people that play football there anyway. I go down to the pitches and have fun, see what I can get. Growing up, we lived on the estate. If I was outside already and couldn’t be bothered to go upstairs I would call my brother and he would throw a ball to me, like in the video where they throw it off the balcony and I control it.\n\n“So it was never something I would think about too much — except the need to control it so it didn’t hit the cars. People online were impressed but it became so normal to me from being a kid.”\n\nAyisi will be a familiar face to fans of the WSL, having made 57 appearances across all competitions for Birmingham as well as scoring in a Champions League tie for Arsenal after progressing through the academy. New club Lewes are just over an hour away from her home in south London but have provided a supportive environment in 11-a-side and the skill-based sides of her game.\n\n“Everybody is supportive and I’m getting game time,” she says. “I’m enjoying my football down there as well so we’ve just got to keep pushing to get the results we deserve. Mainly, it’s been the environment for me, it’s been so positive — you see fans walking around and they always show love, make the effort to say hello. It’s such a good environment with the girls and all the staff as well.\n\n“Lewes support it, I did a video not that long ago in kit at the training ground. The girls take the mick sometimes but they all support and like it really. They can’t get on to me really if they can’t do it themselves! I have to be careful with how much I do because I usually have training or a match the next day and I don’t want to get burnout. But I’m always happy to take on a challenge because I can usually pick up tricks easily enough.”\n\nThe tricks themselves are usually ones that Ayisi has honed over the years or picked up quickly but each can require multiple takes. Keeping the camera rolling is key to not missing any improvised moments of brilliance.\n\n“There are some that are easy to do and don’t take many takes. Anything with my touch, they might not happen first time but they’ll be quick. Shooting into a bin might not take too long, maybe five to eight tries, but there was one where I was standing on one ball and tried to jump onto another ball and that took ages.\n\n“I go to the pitch with some of the boys and we’ll get a couple of clips here and there either using a tripod or getting someone to hold the camera steady. We just have fun but we have to keep things neat to a point. But the camera is just rolling and whatever we filmed that day gets edited and chopped so we can use it.”\n\nAs for the future, there is still plenty of the season left to run at Lewes as Craig Gill’s team chase promotion to the Women’s Super League but beyond that, Ayisi’s social media skills videos could open doors.\n\n“Freestyling is never something that I’ve done — people might think of me as a freestyler but it’s more a case of individual tricks,” she says. “I probably could manage it if I learned it but if you see some of the stuff freestylers do, it’s mad. I’d have to train to try to go into that.\n\n“I’d like to make my own space in that field but I wouldn’t mind collaborating with someone like (F2 Freestylers) Billy Wingrove or Jeremy Lynch because their stuff is amazing. Some of the freestylers add flips into their routine… I’m not sure if I could learn that at the moment. But who knows what the future holds.”\n\n(Top photo: Jose Breton/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"
