        "text": "At the moment Tom Hiddleston and Martin Compston are asking for money for Unicef, accompanied by a piano in the middle of the pitch.\n\nThere’s now a song...think this is the longest half-time EVER...\n\nThe typical comment when some ‘proper’ fans speak of Soccer Aid is something along the lines of ‘it’s not a real game it’s a kickaround’. And in many ways they’re right. But try telling that to the actors, comedians, sporting stars and YouTubers who will be aiming to grace Stamford Bridge tonight.\n\nIt’s the 13th iteration of Soccer Aid, and every match the preparations seem to ramp up in seriousness as those who weren’t quite good enough to make it as footballers scratch that itch and try to convince everyone they were ‘offered trials at Crystal Palace aged 12’ (who wasn’t...).\n\nSome of the greats of the game have played in this fixture. Diego Maradona (in 2006, when he was up against Bradley Walsh and Jamie Theakston...), Franco Baresi (in 2008, when he was up against Gareth Gates and Craig David), and Zinedine Zidane (in 2010, when he came up against the might of Olly Murs).\n\nThose lacing up their boots again this year are regulars Usain Bolt, Sir Mo Farah Roman Kemp, Martin Compston and Steven Bartlett joining footballers Jermain Defoe, Jill Scott, David James, Gary Cahill, Joe Cole and Karen Carney. New signings for this summer include cricketer Stuart Broad, King of the Jungle Sam Thompson, Strictly Come Dancing star Bobby Brazier and footballing legend – and former Chelsea icon – Eden Hazard.\n\nIn the dugouts will be Frank Lampard, who joins his uncle Harry Redknapp and Robbie Williams as England manager. Facing them down will be Mauricio Pochettino, returning as manager for the World XI.\n\nHaving not won for six years, England are in dire need of a win with the overall tally World XI 7 England XI 5.\n\nStay here for all the build-up and action from what will doubtless, at the very least, be a fun evening in west London."
