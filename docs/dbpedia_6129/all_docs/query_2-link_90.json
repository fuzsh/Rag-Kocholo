        "text": "Some months, their Instagram account gets more video views than ANY other account in the UK.\n\nThey travel the world doing what they absolutely love.\n\nAnd they’ve created an incredible partnership that allows them to do more than either could do on their own.\n\nMeet the F2 Freestylers, Jeremy Lynch and Billy Wingrove, two of the world’s best soccer freestylers who teamed up a few years ago to create a wildly popular YouTube channel and brand.\n\nIf you don’t know what a freestyler is in soccer, it’s someone who is an expert at doing trick shots, awesome moves, and impressive feats with a soccer ball.\n\nConsidering soccer is the #1 sport in the world (in the U.S. we’re off from the rest of the world here), Jeremy and Billy have a MASSIVE audience of super fans.\n\nBut that’s only part of what motivates them to keep going.\n\nThey are thinking far beyond what just the two of them can create in their physical prime.\n\nThey’re cultivating younger talent to come up behind them and replicate their success.\n\nThey’ve launched a hugely successful clothing brand that is a business of its own.\n\nAnd they make sure to spend as much time acknowledging their fans in person as possible. They get that without fans, they don’t have a business as entertainers.\n\nI love these guys so much and their enthusiasm and passion for their work is contagious.\n\nWhether or not you’ve heard of them or love soccer, I know you’ll love the message of the F2 in Episode 472."
