        "text": "The Royal Lancaster London Hotel played host to this year’s Football Content Awards, with an array of talented creators and big organisations within the industry in attendance.\n\nThe evening was hosted by Snack Media, one of the U.K.’s largest independent sports publishers, with ex-Soccer AM’s Rocket Long and The Football Terrace’s Terry Flewers taking up the role of on-stage presenters.\n\nThe event was kicked off with the award for Young Content Creator of the year — a prize that recognises some of the finest up-and-coming talent within the sector. United Cloud took home the award, who has grown an audience of over 140,000 followers on Instagram, thanks to his unique and creative Manchester United graphics.\n\nShortly after, we heard all about the vital work of Street Child United, the awards’ charity partner, who do some incredible work with homeless youths by utilising the universal appeal of football and hosting a World Cup.\n\nNext up we celebrated the Best Football League Podcast, where Sheffield’s own Sheff United Way won gold thanks to their fantastic audio work and YouTube channel.\n\nA Celtic State Of Mind — sporting a lovely blazer and on-brand green tie — scooped the international podcast award while Arsenal Vision collected the award amongst their Premier League peers.\n\nThe aforementioned first two podcasts would then go on to win gold in the Club Content Creator category, with City Xtra finally getting their hands on the top prize for the Premier League award: “Not bad for a team with no fans, hey?” Founder Freddie Pye jokingly remarked.\n\nMoving onto Best In Social, Sky Sports saw off fierce competition from the likes of AFTV and Bleacher Report to win the award for best organisation. The 92 Bible and TSR Football were the recipients of the same honour for creator and small/medium business respectively.\n\nThe Athletic were the winner for Best In Video — which seemed to even surprise themselves, given the small size of their team working on the content — in a space where they’ve clearly left a big impression over a relatively short period of time.\n\nThogden fended off stiff competition to win the creator category for video, while HITC Sport got their hands on the same award in the small/medium business section.\n\nAfter the interval, we moved on to the ever-popular Best Influencer award, and there was a familiar face claiming gold. Mark Goldbridge won the individual/journalist award, who sadly couldn’t be in attendance but sent in a video message to acknowledge it and thank those who voted for him.\n\nF2 Freestylers naturally won the freestyle prize, although co-presenter Billy Wingrove was typically gracious when accepting the award, highlighting the fantastic work of other creators such as Jack Downer.\n\nMoving on to Content Creators, AFTV came first for being the best in the business, thanks to the revolutionary work of Robbie Lyle, A.K.A. ‘Don Robbie’, and former professional footballer Curtis Shaw was announced as the best new creator.\n\nFantasy Football Scout cleaned up in the world of FPL, while India’s finest, The FPL Wire, and the minds behind FPL Blackbox also won their respective categories.\n\nBest In Non-League is always a prestigious award at The FCAs, with Snack Media keen to recognise some of the fantastic work that’s done further down the football pyramid. Rootz TV celebrated winning the best small/medium business category alongside Football In Berkshire for podcast and Will Burford for creator.\n\nBleacher Report managed to get their hands on a prize later in the evening, capturing the Best Branded Campaign award, with the Charitable Campaign prize going to the popular and brilliant ​​Gooners V Cancer.\n\nAfter that, the FCAs recognised some of the phenomenal work that’s being done in arguably the industry’s most underrepresented but most rapidly growing area: Women’s Football. Lauren Baker was voted as the best creator, alongside The Women’s Football Podcast and BBC Sport, who collected the small/medium business and organisation awards.\n\nTo round things off, Terry and Rocket announced the winners of the more professional categories — those being Best Club, Best Footballer, and Best Media Organisation.\n\nArsenal won the Premier League category, with Bristol City taking the Football League title, Bury AFC winning out in the Non-League, and Zenit St Petersburg coming through for the International prize, thanks to their ever-growing social media presence in the U.K.\n\nWhen it came to the players, fan-favourite Adebayo Akinfenwa accepted the Football League prize with Cristiano Ronaldo winning the International category and Watford’s own Ben Foster taking top spot in the Premier League, thanks to his exceptional The Cycling GK YouTube channel.\n\nFinally, Sky Sports saw off The Athletic and BBC Sport for their second award of the evening, winning Best Media Organisation, which closed out another hugely successful year for the FCAs.\n\nSee below for a full list of winners:"
