        "text": "English YouTube personality\n\nBrent Di Cesare (born 7 April 1979), known by his online pseudonym Mark Goldbridge, is an English YouTuber and radio presenter best known for supporting Premier League club Manchester United and his livestreams on the Manchester United-based fan channel The United Stand.\n\nHe was born Brent Di Cesare on 7 April 1979[4][5] in Nottingham, and attended Toot Hill School in Bingham, Nottinghamshire. He lives in Solihull as of 2019.\n\nHe has stated that he created the alias when he started his YouTube career. This alias was used at the request of his employers during his job as a police officer investigating financial fraud.[6]\n\nYouTube career\n\n[edit]\n\nGoldbridge has four YouTube channels: \"The United Stand\" which consists of Manchester United content,[7] \"That's Football\" which consists of general football content and watchalongs of non-Manchester United matches,[8] \"Mark Goldbridge That's Entertainment\" which consists of clips from his recent livestreams, and \"Mark Goldbridge\" which includes more personal content such as cooking, vlogging and general chit-chats.[9]\n\nGoldbridge started The United Stand in 2014 under the name \"Soccer Box TV\",[10] providing videos on Premier League match predictions. He then switched his content to post-match reactions of Manchester United games.[6] Later, Goldbridge started live streaming watchalongs of the matches. BBC Sport has described these as \"an amateur online version of Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday\".[11] In April 2022, Goldbridge made his Talksport debut, presenting a late-night show.[12]\n\nIn September 2022, Goldbridge was invited to be one of the managers in the Sidemen charity match.[13] There were two teams in the charity match.[14] Sidemen FC which included the Sidemen and a few select influencers, including MrBeast and LazarBeam. The other team was the YouTube All Stars which included social media influencers such as IShowSpeed and Noah Beck. Goldbridge managed the YouTube All Stars, who lost 8–7 to Sidemen FC.[15] In total, they raised over £1,000,000 for their select charities.[16]\n\nIn March 2023, Mark Goldbridge held his first ever live-shows with The United Stand. The shows took place in Dublin, Manchester and London.[17]\n\nIn September 2023, Goldbridge was back for the Sidemen Charity Match as manager of YouTube All Stars, where they raised over £2,400,000 in just two hours. The Sidemen won the match, beating the YouTube All Stars 8–5. Miniminter, W2S and Behzinga were all on the score sheet for Sidemen FC, while ChrisMD, Max Fosh and Niko Omilana were on target for the All-Stars.\n\nIn November 2023, Goldbridge raised over £52,000 for the end of life charity Marie Curie. This was part of his yearly charity live stream which saw Goldbridge participate in a number of video games on YouTube for 24 hours.[18]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
