        "text": "I am originally from Mississippi grew up in West Virginia and the last place I called home was in Tennessee. My wife and I love to hang out with our 2 dogs, spend time with friends and watch Mississippi State in any sport! We are so excited about being a part of the Self Regional Family.\n\nWe chose Self because of the legacy of excellence academically and mostly the people! I was looking for a place that would be a challenge to become a competent and confident physician while being in a supportive environment and felt like Self was the best place for that. When my wife and I came down for the interview I kept telling her that the people of here were people I would want to be around in medicine and would aspire to be like. They work hard but are also some of the kindest people I have met. All along the way everyone went out of their way to be available and answer any questions. One of the things that stood out the most is that they treated my wife’s opinion as important as my own and continue to engage her as we transition to South Carolina. I feel like it the best combination of an extremely strong program while maintaining a family like environment.\n\nI grew up in the Fargo/Moorhead area of the Red River Valley which is located on the border of Minnesota and North Dakota. I enjoy outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, and camping as well as water sports and pickleball. My journey to medicine started as soon as I could answer “What did I want to be when I grew up?” I majored in Biology at the University of North Dakota, where I also met my wife. I attended Iowa State University for my Master’s in Biomedical Science and Ross University for my medical doctorate.\n\nMy first interaction with Self was early on during my interview season and I was impressed. My wife also loved the fact that she felt included during the interview process. I desire to practice full-spectrum family medicine and the extensive inpatient and obstetrics experience will be a strong foundation for my future. All of this, in combination with the caring nature of the faculty and staff during our visit to Greenwood, confirmed that Self Regional was the place for us.\n\nI was born and raised in small, rural Pike County, GA where I grew up playing outside, working in the garden, and riding horses. I attended UNG for undergrad where I majored in Biology and was able to develop a love for the Appalachian Mountains. During my gap year before attending Mercer for medical school, I worked with local small farm operations to develop organic practices for pest control. I am passionate about rural and underserved populations, and have been to both the Dominican Republic and Honduras for medical missions. When not busy, you can catch me with my dog Duke enjoying anything and everything outdoors such as hiking and camping, kayaking, rock climbing, fishing, and playing any kind of sport.\n\nDuring the crazy season of virtual interviews (thanks Covid), Self was one of the only programs to allow an in-person option (following proper safety regulations). I gladly accepted and immediately felt welcomed and at home with the people here. Everyone is so warm and genuine, and the unopposed broad scope training residents get here sold me. I have strong interests in rural and global health, both which have robust programs here. My second look sealed the deal as everyone was so supportive and accommodating, and the program stood out among others in the training, faculty, and community they offer. I’m excited to see the physician I will become through the exceptional training at Self, and know I will be prepared for my future patients both in a rural setting and on international soil.\n\nGrowing up as the oldest of four in the small, South Carolinian town of Sumter, I was surrounded by family connections to medicine, but never imagined I would join them. Upon completing high school, I went to Clemson for Bioengineering, pursuing prosthetic development. Along the way, however, I realized that my fascination with the broad expanse of human physiology and the joy in interacting with the people I cared for, was more consistent with a career in medicine. While I prepared for and worked through medical school, family medicine attracted me with its direct, continuous patient relationships and broad scope of medical problems it addressed. When I’m not studying or working on rotations, I enjoy the company of good board games, good books, and great friends. I also deeply appreciate the fellowship and truth that my family and local church have provided me.\n\nIt was during rotations at the University of South Carolina SOM in Columbia that I first heard about Self Regional from one of my attendings. He had been a resident at Self Regional and spoke highly of his attendings and the rigorous training they provided. What he told me about the quality of the education and others told me about the nature of the community that Self Regional promoted in its residents prompted me to explore Self’s residency program for myself! As I learned more and visited the program personally, its excellent academics, close community, friendly residents, and approachable attendings made me confident it was my first choice in every way. I am thrilled to be joining the team at Self Regional and look forward to both the learning opportunities and the relationships that make this program so special.\n\nI was born and raised in Oxfordshire, England and spent the majority of my childhood there. I then moved to Panama City, FL at the age of 13, and experienced quite the culture shock. I went to college at the University of South Florida in Tampa, and then Ross University for Medical School.\n\nMy boyfriend, Kevin, and I met in a little fishing town called Port st Joe, FL. We spend most of our free time on the boat, fishing, hunting and camping. We’re outdoor enthusiasts for sure!\n\nWhen researching residency programs, I wanted to be somewhere that offered versatile training that would make me the most well-rounded physician. Not only did Self provide this, but it just felt like “home”. Everyone here was so welcoming, and so much fun! At the end of our visit to Greenwood, both my boyfriend and I knew that this was where we wanted to end up. I immediately canceled all of my other interviews and kept my fingers crossed for match. We are so thankful to have ended up at Self Regional.\n\nI grew up in a small town in southeastern Kentucky called Barbourville. After attending a program called PEPP at the University of Kentucky hospital during the summer after my sophomore year of undergrad, I realized my calling was in the medical field as a physician. While keeping an open mind during my clinical rotations in medical school, I quickly found that the specialty for me was Family Medicine. I loved the variety of patients and conditions that I encountered, and I had multiple family doctors in my home church to look up to, including my uncle. Outside of medicine, I love staying active and doing things outdoors like golf or tennis, and am always rooting on my UK Wildcats! I also play guitar/banjo and sing, playing in a band with my buddies since high school. I’ve been very involved with my church back home as well.\n\nConsidering I love pediatrics and sports medicine, when I found out that Self has a strong emphasis in both these areas, I thought it could be a great fit for me. After coming to the resident dinner and interview, I found out how one-of-a-kind their program and people truly were. Residents get tons of procedure experience, and their in-training exam scores are top of the line. I kept finding myself comparing other programs to Self, and they all fell short. I know the Lord has called me here, and I can’t wait to see what He has planned for the future!\n\nI was born and raised in Marietta, SC right down the road from Jones Gap State Park. I felt called to medicine early in high school and knew it combined my love for biology with my desire to serve the people around me. I went to college at North Greenville University, where I majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry, and began medical school at the Medical University of South Carolina shortly after. My husband Zach and I met in college and got married during my third year and his first year of medical school (right in the middle of rotations and tests!!).\n\nWe are beyond excited to have ended up at Self for my Family Medicine residency! Some amazing friends and mentors of ours in Charleston trained here, so we had heard what a wonderful place it was. It is such a blessing to get to work with and learn from physicians that I aspire to be like in my own practice, and that is something I believe truly sets this program apart. I plan to practice broad spectrum family medicine and Zach and I hope to do medical mission work in the future.\n\nI grew up in Elko, NV, a small mining and ranching community in the middle of nowhere Nevada. It was a great place to grow up with an all-American feel, everyone showed up to support the one high school, lots of parades, and a county fair that brought in people from all over. I moved away to sunny Southern California for college where I received a Bachelors in Biological Sciences and minored in Biblical and Theological Studies. I then moved to the East Coast and earned a Masters at Rutgers University. I had planned to go back west for medical school, but Campbell not only had a big focus on medical missions and active Christian community, but I instantly fell in love with the Carolinas. I knew I ultimately wanted to work and practice in a place much more similar to my hometown, a place where people were invested in their community and you knew your neighbors.\n\nNot only was Self everything I wanted in a program, academic and clinical excellence with a family feel, Greenwood was exactly what I wanted in a community. The faculty, staff, and residents instantly made it feel like home and it was obviously they not only valued me as a physician, but also as a person. Additionally, I am particularly interested in medical missions and hospice and palliative care and Self has excellent opportunities for both. Self has the faculty and residents I want to be like, personally and professionally. I feel incredibly blessed to get to call Greenwood home.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy traveling (I have been to 47/50 states, done several cross-country road trips, and a few countries), hiking, photography, history, baking, being involved with my church, and adventures with my lab, Huxley.\n\nI grew up on a farm outside of Eudora, AR. After graduating high school, I went to college at Hendrix College in Conway, AR. I met my husband during my sophomore year at church (he went to a different college in town). We got married a week after college graduation, and I started medical school at UAMS that fall.\n\nWhile at UAMS, we’ve had three kids: Kaitlyn, born right after 1st year, Pete, born 13 months later during a much needed leave of absence, and Rebekah born February of my 4th year. They are the center of our world! Between my schooling and my husband’s coaching schedule, we spend most of our free time at home or with family. We love to cook, play outside, and watch movies all together.\n\nWhen I started medical school, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do other than practice in a rural area. With this in mind, I finally settled on family medicine so I could offer the most possible to my future patients. I then looked for a residency that could train me in full scope practice including obstetrics. Greenwood was my first interview and my first choice. The program had all of the training I was looking for which was wonderful, but what hooked me was the people here. I immediately felt at home with everyone I met. At the end of my interview, I didn’t want to leave. We all hear during interview season we need to find a place where the people will support you as a whole person not just a physician, and you definitely have that here. The people here are a family that is happy to welcome you and whatever family you bring with you.\n\nI was born in Davenport, IA and grew up there before moving to Pittsburgh, PA. I enjoyed Pittsburgh, especially Primanti Bros. sandwiches and cheering on the Steelers. When my sister moved south for college, I decided to do the same! At Clemson, I was able to combine my passions for Spanish and health while studying Language and International Health which took me to Costa Rica, Argentina, Nicaragua, and Spain. After I graduated, my parents moved to Clemson from Pittsburgh, and I moved to Zaragoza, Spain to teach English and culture in two public elementary schools. I enjoy exploring new places, whether it be towns closer to home or those farther away. Other hobbies include stand-up paddleboarding, trying new recipes, brewing beer with my dad, and watching Clemson football.\n\nSelf Regional easily stood out for me on my residency interview trail! After meeting the team and learning about the program, it was clear Self Regional would be where I would receive exceptional training to become the Family Medicine physician I would like to be. The people are truly kind and very supportive, a group I am excited to be a part of.\n\nI was born and raised in Gastonia, NC. My family then moved down to Charleston, SC when I was in 7th grade. I attended Clemson University and majored in Bioengineering. It was during my Senior year that I met and fell in love with my beautiful wife Jess. After Clemson, I returned back home to Charleston for medical school at MUSC and Jess and I got married after my first year there. Medicine is a passion of mine that I feel God has called me into, but I also enjoy many other aspects of life including spending time with Jess and our dog Sidney, CrossFit, college football (Go Tigers!), hiking/backpacking, volunteering at our local church, financial literacy, and learning more about nutrition.\n\nFamily Medicine has always been on my radar due to my strong interests in preventative and lifestyle medicine as well as building long-lasting relationships with patients. I first heard about Self from some close friends who went to residency there, and they had nothing but good things to say about it. During my 3rd year of medical school I was able to do my Family Medicine rotation at Self for 6 weeks and saw first-hand what makes this place so special. I quickly discovered that not only do the faculty and residents at Self provide high quality evidence-based medicine, but they also display a genuine love for their patients. Additionally, the full-scope training offered at Self including a robust Sports Medicine curriculum ensured that they would be my top choice for residency.\n\nI’m from Springfield, Illinois-the hometown of Abraham Lincoln! I grew up playing soccer, basketball, singing, and acting. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, reading, and spending time outdoors. I enjoy connecting with people and find humor in the mundane. I attended Wheaton College where I was an Applied Health Science major. One of the best decisions during college was choosing to spend a summer as a camp counselor in northern Wisconsin. Highlights from that summer include learning to kayak, throwing clay on a pottery wheel, and canoeing overnight in a 54-mile race!\n\nBetween college and medical school, I worked in an emergency department for several years. As a third-year medical student, I fell in love with family medicine. I enjoyed being able to care for all patients in a variety of settings and wanted to be in a position to serve my patients and their families for years and decades at a time.\n\nMy brother Joe who is a family medicine resident in Iowa encouraged me to meet Self at the AAFP National Conference. When I attended the conference, I was impressed with how personable the faculty were. I found people with whom I could both easily laugh and have serious discussions. Over the course of interview season, I grew in my desire to pursue excellence as a family medicine physician. Feeling a sense of God’s calling to care for patients as a physician, I felt like Self offered the best training to help me become the excellent family medicine physician that I am striving to become.\n\nI grew up in central Illinois in a small town called Pontiac. I have always been interested in family medicine as my mother is a family nurse practitioner. During medical school, I was a member of the Rural Medical Education Department (RMED) and plan to practice full-scope, rural family medicine. Family medicine offers a unique opportunity to provide a wide variety of services to a small community while also developing meaningful relationships with patients.\n\nHaving spent three summers in east Tennessee with a college ministry program, I was interested to check out programs in the southeast region. I learned about Self when I met Dr. Tiller at the AAFP National Conference in Kansas City. When I interviewed in Greenwood, I felt the warm southern hospitality and could tell that the program was filled with great residents, faculty, and staff. I left knowing that Self would provide me with the top-notch training and procedural skills to be an excellent rural family physician.\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy a good cup of coffee, playing sports, hiking, hunting, and riding my motorcycle.\n\nI was born in Lugoff, South Carolina, a small town in the middle of the state. I grew up enjoying the outdoors, in particular hunting, fishing, woodworking and farming. I went to Clemson University for undergrad where I majored in Biological Sciences, After graduating from Clemson, I went on to get my masters degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, MS. I attended Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Spartanburg, SC for medical school. I knew that I wanted a residency in a small town in South Carolina, which is initially what made Self Regional catch my eye. When I interviewed at Self Regional, I was blown away with the family feeling that I felt from everyone I encountered while on my interview. I am so excited to be able to learn from the wonderful people and train alongside such a special group of residents that make up the Self Regional family.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in Greenville, SC and returned there after high school to attend Furman University, where I majored in Neuroscience and Philosophy. My wife Maria and I crossed paths after our churches went through a merge. We got married in the fall of my first year of medical school, and we welcomed our daughter, Marleigh, into the world right before I took Step 1!\n\nHaving a little one keeps us very busy, but we try to slow down and enjoy time with one another. You may find us at any given time making music, baking yummy things on Saturday mornings, taking a walk (or swinging perpetually) at the park, reading a good book, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.\n\nComing into medical school, I was fairly confident that I wanted to do Family Medicine. My clinical rotations confirmed this for me. When looking for a residency program, several things set Self apart. I did an away rotation at this program and found that the residents and faculty were all down to earth and very approachable. Self has a strong inpatient program, and the hospital pulls from a large enough area that you get to see a lot of different pathology to learn from. Yet the responsibilities that the residents shouldered did not seem overwhelming. I was looking for a program that offered broad-scope training, and Self offered that as well. In particular, I was very interested in their advanced OBGYN track, as this is something I would like to pursue as part of my practice. In addition, my family and I are considering global missions as a possible avenue for ministry in the future. Given this, I loved that Self also offers both an international medicine track and an underserved track to help prepare me for this trajectory.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI am from Greenville, SC. I went to a small college in Tigerville, SC called North Greenville University, where I played football for 2 years. I grew up playing football and got to live the college dream, but I knew my calling was always in medicine. I moved on to stay home in Greenville for medical school, all the while supported by my high school sweetheart, Kayla. We are huge Gamecock fans and you can usually find us in Columbia on Saturdays in the fall when there is a home game. Our other big hobby is hunting (picture taken in a wet and rainy duck blind), I have grown up hunting with my dad and brother.\n\nGreenwood was the easy choice for us as we left both knowing it was where we wanted to be. For me that education was that being provided was second to none, the ability to be the only residents in this hospital was something I wanted from my family medicine residency as I feel that is the only way to truly be an excellent family physician. The availability of the sports medicine track was also a huge draw. One of the biggest things that stood out to me about Greenwood was the camaraderie of the residents not just with their peers but also with the staff. It was truly just one big family there to learn and care for patients as well as each other. Even the support of the spouses was obvious among residents and staff.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in Oxford, Ohio until my senior year of high school when my family moved to Starkville, MS. I met my husband when I was a freshman in high school, I was 14 and he was 15. I attended Mississippi State University and after 2 years of long distance, my husband enrolled at MSU. He supported my decision to pursue medicine and off we went to University of Mississippi Medical Center. Towards the end of my third year, I realized my love for family medicine. Family medicine allows me to practice the many specialties that interest me and apply them to a single patient.\n\nWhen I was looking at different programs, Self Regional not only checked all my boxes as a strong program, but also the people were just amazing. From the moment my interview day started, I knew this place was different from the others. Everyone was so welcoming and genuine. I knew that these were the people that would help me to grow as physician, as a wife, and spiritually. My husband and I are so blessed to have the Self Regional family in our life.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI am from Dallas, GA, and I studied biochemistry and Spanish at Berry College before moving to Greenville for medical school. I have a strong interest in Global Health and have served abroad in the Peruvian Amazon and several other countries throughout Latin America. Apart from medicine, you’ll find me hiking, kayaking, or dancing. Over the last four years I have fallen in love with the Upstate and I am thrilled to be continuing the next phase of my journey in Greenwood!\n\nMy interview at Self was my first interview of the season, and I was immediately blown away. The sense of authentic community that I found among the residents as well as the quality of full-scope family medicine training that the program offers really captivated me from the start. Throughout the rest of my interview season I found myself comparing every other program to Self, and no one ever quite measured up. I hope to practice in a resource-limited setting, and I have no doubt that the training I will receive at Self will prepare me for practice anywhere from rural South Carolina to the banks of the Amazon River. I am overjoyed to be joining the family at Self, and I can’t wait to see how the Lord uses these next three years to challenge and grow me.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nMy wife, Alexus, and I are outgoing, fun, God-loving people. In our free time, we love spending time with family, friends, and our dog Retta, traveling, and college football games (Go Gamecocks!!!). We are high school sweethearts that grew up in 2 small southern towns not far from Greenwood; Saluda and Batesburg-Leesville. I attended Limestone College in Gaffney, SC where I played baseball for 4 years. Afterwards, my medical school journey led me to the beautiful Caribbean island of Dominica to attend Ross University. We endured many hardships in this third world country, but we will forever be grateful for our experience there and for giving us a whole new appreciation on the greater things in life. During this crazy journey, home was always where Alexus and I wanted to be.\n\nThe main reason Alexus and I chose Self Regional as our residency home is the emphasis the program places on family. Everyone in the program from faculty to residents, to spouses and kids, are fully involved and dedicated to making the program great and genuinely family oriented. My wife also recently opened a business in Greenwood, so we plan to make the area our permanent home. We are beyond excited to start this journey with our new Self family!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nHi, I’m Taylor from Taylors! I’ve lived in South Carolina my whole life and went to Clemson University for undergrad. I majored in biology and felt called to medicine during my junior year after getting involved in a local free clinic. My husband Jon and I met while I was in medical school and got married during my third year. We love serving together at church, reading, old records, concerts, food trucks, and hanging out with our lab mix, Sophie. I also enjoy cycling, anime, and baking shows. My medical interests include lifestyle medicine and underserved populations.\n\nAfter meeting Dr. Tiller, Carleigh, and several residents at the AAFP conference, I knew that I had to check out Greenwood. Jon and I were welcomed with open arms and pizza for my interview dinner, where we were invited to crash the weekly intern hang out. We were so impressed with the family atmosphere and how much the residents truly cared about each other. Self offers a robust training experience that is grounded in a deep sense of community. By the end of interview season, I knew we were meant to be in Greenwood. We are so thankful that God saw fit for us to train at such a wonderful place with truly amazing people.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in Birmingham, AL, spent my formative years of middle/high school in Hillsboro, MO, and moved to Augusta, GA, 10 years ago. Since this is really the place I have lived the longest, I consider it my “hometown.” I was raised by my Alabama-bred parents who taught me the two most important things in life – “Jesus loves you” and “Roll Tide.” I met my husband, Tyler, when I was 13 years old.\n\nI moved from Missouri to Georgia to attend Augusta University for undergrad, chasing above mentioned heart thief. From there, I attended VCOM Carolinas for medical school. It was during my third year of school that I realized I enjoyed every part of medicine, in all of its intricacies and interwoven parts. Family medicine is unique in that it gives you an opportunity to walk through the ups and downs of life with someone through many years. What an incredible honor that is!\n\nToo often patients are viewed as the sum of their diseases, and I knew I wanted to find a program that would teach me to view them as people – mind, body, spirit. This is one of the reasons Self Regional towered far above any other program on my list. From the first time I viewed their website and through the interview process – it was blatantly obvious that people are what matter here. And after seeing how the interns interacted with upper levels and the residents interacted with faculty, it was clear that relationships are valued, as well. There is a true family atmosphere at Self, and Ty and I are so excited to be joining the family this summer!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nGrowing up in Gulf Breeze, FL, I enjoyed playing sports and being on the water. Later on, I traded the beaches and water for mountains and the Appalachian Trail at Berry College. While there, I spent a lot of time hiking and studying biochemistry. After college, I was accepted to Creighton School of Medicine. Through Creighton, I got to experience living in snow in Omaha and then exploring desert life in Phoenix. Throughout my education, I developed a love for international work, sports medicine, and working in small towns. My passion lies in working with people within the feel and connectedness of a small community.\n\nI was blown away by the authenticity of Self Regional’s Family Medicine residency. Going to their interview felt like going home. I felt welcomed and wanted here at the program — I came away with the impression that they worked hard to create a culture of supporting each other and working hard. Self Regional is in a smaller town that has excellent opportunities for me to explore all my interests. Most importantly, I knew that these were people I would want to experience life with. I could not be happier to start my residency here.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in Memphis, Tennessee and raised in Sandy Springs, Georgia. I studied anthropology at the University of Notre Dame with the goal of becoming a forensic anthropologist, but God had other plans. After completing my degree, I wasn’t satisfied with my limited career options, so my father suggested I find work in the medical field. Hesitant to return to school without knowing I loved the discipline, I applied for a job as an EMT. Within weeks of treating my first patient, I discovered my passion for medicine.\n\nI spent 8 years working as an EMT and paramedic in metro Atlanta. While I loved the experience, I wanted to play a greater role in treating illness and preventing human suffering, so I completed a biology degree at Georgia State University and applied to medical school. Given my background, I assumed I would practice Emergency Medicine, but by then I should have known God had other plans for me.\n\nI truly believe I discovered Self through divine intervention. As a third-year medical student at the Medical College of Georgia, I completed my only away rotation at Self’s Family Healthcare clinic in Edgefield, SC. The clerkship revealed the many career paths available to family physicians and allowed me to witness the profound impact physicians have in fulfilling the healthcare needs of their communities. I was hooked as soon as I started. My experience with Self during interview season only strengthened my view of the program.\n\nMy lovely wife, Leanne, is a former marketing analyst who now works part-time in graphic design. We have two dogs and hope to have several children. We enjoy traveling, hiking, swimming, gardening, and fixing up old homes.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up right here in Greenwood, SC. I met my husband in school, and we started dating while at Emerald High School. As the daughter of two physicians in town, I have always known medicine. It was in high school that I decided to pursue it as a career. I attended college at Clemson University (to my parents’ disapproval) and graduated with a degree in Biology. JC and I got married the following week, and moved to Greenville to start a new journey for our family; in medical school for me, and seminary for my husband. In our time since leaving Greenwood, we have seen God’s faithfulness in growing us in our knowledge of him, and placing in us a call to medicine and ministry. Together we enjoy being outdoors, having friends over for bonfires, and experiencing new “firsts” with our daughter, Eliza, born in 2018.\n\nI never expected to return to Greenwood as an adult, but after spending time with the faculty and residents at Self, I knew this was where I wanted to be. The culture here is unmatched, and creates an atmosphere of encouragement and support that I did not see at any other program on the interview trail. This program’s emphasis on serving cultivates within residents the compassion and competence to serve patients in many different settings after their training. I am confident that at Self, I will receive the training I need to be an excellent family physician. I am honored to be a part of this program, and I am thankful for the Lord’s providence in bringing my family back to Greenwood.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in St. Petersburg, FL but raised in a small town outside of Milwaukee, WI. Sports have always been a big part of my life growing up as I enjoyed playing soccer, basketball, and golf. I majored in Physiology at the University of Iowa and went on to complete my Masters in Biomedical Sciences as well as medical school at Rosalind Franklin University in Chicago. During my time in medical school, I met my beautiful wife and we are now expecting our first child!\n\nWe came to know Self Regional when attending the AAFP Conference in Kansas City during my fourth year. Carleigh and Dr. Tiller along with some of the residents were extremely friendly and welcoming that we ended up spending the whole weekend with them! From there I did a rotation at Self Regional to get to know the hospital and Greenwood. What immediately drew me to Self Regional was the tight-knit community that was apparent during my rotation. Also, the exposure and hands-on experiences that this hospital provides are seemingly endless.\n\nSpending almost my whole life in the Midwest, my wife and I fell in love with the small town charm of Greenwood nestled between the mountains and the ocean and couldn’t wait to begin our lives away from the cold.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama until I finished my sophomore year of high school and my family relocated to South Florida. I finished high school in Parkland, FL (#MSDStrong) and headed to Duke University, where it is almost impossible not to become a college basketball fan. I studied Biological Anthropology & Anatomy, Spanish and Global Health. I also had the opportunity to continue my dance training on campus and was very involved with Duke Ballet Repertory.\n\nAfter obtaining a Master’s degree in Medical Sciences at University of South Florida, I made a full circle back to Mobile for medical school. I participated in medical mission trips to Peru and Rwanda, and I was happy to discover that the faculty at Self would encourage and support my desire to explore international medicine and caring for the underserved. When I interviewed at Self, I could see that there was a strong emphasis on community and everyone that I met was very genuine. I felt a greater sense of fit at Self compared to other places, so I had no doubts about ranking it first. I am excited to see what God has in store for me in Greenwood!\n\nOutside of medicine, I love all things related to ballet and the performing arts, good food, good coffee, and reading.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in Clover, South Carolina – “the town with LOVE in the middle” – and from an early age I knew I wanted to be a doctor. Not just any doctor, but one of the old-timey ones with a black leather bag who rode around town on a horse making house calls. But after an eye-opening shadowing experience while an undergraduate at Erskine College, I abandoned my quest for a medical career and headed to Clemson University for graduate research in [nerd alert!] plant pathology. I met my wife, Elizabeth, while I was finishing up at Clemson, and it was through her encouragement that I saw that God had called me to practice medicine. We moved to Charleston, SC, the week of our first anniversary and both of our birthdays, and I began my medical education at MUSC shortly after. Since then, God has blessed us with two amazing boys: our crazy dog, Hank, and our little man, Jack.\n\nMy first real experience at Self Regional was as a third-year student on an away rotation. By the end of the rotation I was convinced that this was where I wanted to come for residency. It was almost a year later on my interview early in fourth year that Elizabeth was convinced as well. There was an attractive warmth to the faculty, residents, and staff at Self that won us over; everyone genuinely delighted in what they did, and their compassion for patients and their investment in one another was contagious. We couldn’t be more excited to be a part of a program that not only forges excellent family physicians, but also shepherds its residents in their roles as spouses, parents, and community members.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nFirst, to clarify, I’m the second one from the left in this picture with my family on a trip to the Ark Encounter in Kentucky. But I grew up in the small town of Varnville, South Carolina. I majored in Biochemistry at Claflin University in Orangeburg, SC. Between college graduation and high school, I lived in Guatemala for about six months and went back to my hometown to substitute teach. During that time, I trusted in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for salvation, and my life has never been the same! I love spending time with my parents and two younger siblings, as well as with my church family. I also enjoy listening to Christian music and traveling. Crochet has become the newest craft I have picked up!\n\nAs I went through my third-year rotations in medical school, I realized a few things—I was enjoying aspects of just about every specialty, I liked spending time talking with patients, and I wanted to know how my patients were doing beyond our brief encounters. And family medicine brought all of these realities together for me. I look forward to serving in a rural and/or underserved area, and I want to be prepared to serve my future neighbors well.\n\nThe people from Self began showing me what family medicine training would be like in Greenwood before I even showed up for an interview. Their support for me extended beyond an interview day, and I am so excited to be a part of such a great community moving forward. The residents were working hard and still enjoying life! It was evident that Self would prepare me for whatever scope of family medicine I decide to pursue and be a supportive environment where I will be prepared to serve wherever the Lord leads! And yes, I’m glad to be back to small-town living again!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nMy name is Clint, and I am from Jackson, MS. I studied Clinical Exercise Physiology at Mississippi State University and completed my medical school at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, so I’ve pretty much been a Mississippi boy through and through. I have been a personal trainer for the past 7 years and have a huge passion for preventive medicine and hope to integrate that into my medical practice one day. When not at the hospital, I love to sing, go to the gym, hunt, fish, and play any sport thats available.\n\nI interviewed at Self early in my interview season, and I noticed that from that point on, I was unintentionally comparing every other program to it. I was captivated by the quality and character of the residents and faculty combined with the strong, full-scope training that Self offers. I especially was impressed by the huge volume of sports medicine cases as it is a particular interest of mine. I knew that this was the place I wanted to be, and I feel so blessed to be joining the family at Self. God is so good!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in the small town of Clinton, South Carolina, just 30 minutes from Greenwood. I received my B.A. in History from Presbyterian College (Go Hose!), and attended medical school at VCOM at the Carolina’s campus. After my first year of medical school, I was lucky enough to marry my best friend, Haley, who is an elementary school teacher. I enjoy sports, hiking, fitness, travel, photography, shooting, and just about anything we can do with our two golden retrievers, Stella and Charleston.\n\nGrowing up in Clinton, I was familiar with Greenwood and Self Regional, but it wasn’t until the Family Medicine Interest Day in Columbia, SC that I was able to meet Dr. Tiller, Carleigh, and several residents. From then, I knew the residency at Self was something special. Not only does it offer everything that I want in a program, but the faculty, staff, and residents are truly amazing. It didn’t take long for me to sense the true family feel the program creates. I will be able to pursue my passion for both international mission work, as well as sports medicine, while receiving an amazing education. Haley and I are so excited to take the next step of our lives in Greenwood at Self Regional.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born right down the road in North Augusta, and stayed in South Carolina for both undergrad and med school. My wonderful wife, Julianne, and her cat moved over from Georgia when we got married in 2016. We like it here. We enjoy the outdoors, the slow pace, and having our families close by. I even love my Gamecock football and its persistent mediocrity. That said, we were open to leaving the state for residency, thinking it might be a good few years to learn and grow in a different context. But we quickly realized there was a top-notch program right here at home.\n\nOur first visit to Self was unlike anywhere else, and set the standard for the rest of the interview season. Here we found a culture of clinical excellence coupled with a warm and supportive atmosphere. I felt confident this program would offer intensive, full-spectrum training alongside faculty and residents with hearts for service, and I knew that my family would be well cared for in the process. It was more than we could have asked. We are delighted that God has led us to Self, and excited to spend the next three years with some awesome folks!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in inner city Atlanta with my parents and younger brother. I had a wonderful time as a student at the University of Georgia living with my best friend from high school as my roommate. It was a further blessing that I was able find a roommate for medical school that has become another close friend for life. I love baking, musical theater, and spending time with my friends and family. I wasn’t sure what kind of doctor I wanted to be when I entered medical school, but I knew I wanted to serve those in need. My faith is very important to me and has played an important role in my decision to become a Family Medicine physician. I have been fortunate enough to work in multiple free clinics in the Augusta area as well as participate in an international mission trip while in medical school. One of my goals is to continue to make an impact in communities throughout the world by spending time each year involved in medical mission work outside of the United States.\n\nDuring my interview at Self, I quickly realized that this is a program where I will not only get excellent medical training, but will also grow and develop my love for people. The staff and residents at Self made it clear that they will quickly come to be part of my extended family, given the kindness and warmth I felt during my visits. I am thankful for the opportunity to train in such a supportive environment and I can’t wait to see what the next 3 year have in store.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in Chattanooga, TN, and grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. Feeling adventurous, I left for college to the beautiful mountains of Virginia. There I earned a BA in anthropology, with a focus on the study of different cultures and communities. I fell in love with the mountains and rural life and committed two years after college to anti-poverty service work with AmeriCorps in southeastern West Virginia. I also had the rare opportunity to spend 6 months teaching English to elementary school children on the remote island of Kaben on Maloelap Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\nDuring these experiences, I saw the great need for more rural doctors in primary care. I decided to help fill this need, so I went back to school to study family medicine. I was fortunate to receive a National Health Service Corps Scholarship, and I am committed after residency to work in a region of high healthcare need. Self Regional was the perfect residency to help me work toward this goal, with its commitment to education and its underserved and international medicine tracks.\n\nWhen I am not at work, I am an avid gardener and enjoy growing my own food and walking or jogging in nature. I also have a fondness for animals, with two dogs, two cats, and four boisterous chickens.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI’ve lived mostly around Georgia but spent six years in Austin, TX and a couple years in the South Pacific where my parents were missionaries. I studied Cell Biology and Public Health at UGA, and I was blessed to stay in the Classic City for medical school. I met my wife, Ashley, at a Braves tailgate and we held strong as she left UGA for OT school at MCG Augusta. She moved back, we married, and settled on a little farm with her horses north of Athens.\n\nWe came to know the name Self Regional through relationships with alumni and a current resident. Once arriving in Greenwood, we fell in love with the people, the mission statement, and the atmosphere. I arrived on the interview trail looking for the best place to be molded into a well-rounded family physician that could serve the various needs of a low resource rural population and found that Self Regional could guide me to that potential. I am also very excited about the international service opportunities.\n\nMy wife and I enjoy farm life, fishing, hiking, sports, reading and country music. I love to hunt and spend as much time as possible in God’s beautiful creation. We are so overjoyed with what the Lord has provided us in the Greenwood community.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in Thomasville, Georgia. Growing up, I loved being in a small town! Thomasville has such charm and wonderful people! I left Thomasville for Athens to pursue an undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Georgia. Go Dawgs! I then married my wonderful husband, Steven and we moved to Bainbridge, Georgia — another wonderful small town. We adopted our amazing “fur babies” — a boxer, Zeke and three cats, Emma, Matilda and Tux. We love being outdoors and on the water fishing.\n\nDuring medical school, I had to opportunity to rotate with physicians who were graduates of Self. I loved not only the doctors they are but the kind of people they are. After visiting Greenwood, I found it was the small town feel that I loved combined with a wonderful teaching program full of amazing people! We are so thankful that God lead us here and excited to continue our journey at Self!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nSometimes, God just has a plan for your life that you know nothing about! That is what happened to my husband, Josh, and I as he completed medical school. We thought we had it all planned out – I was in a combined degree program, he in the traditional MD program – we were obviously going to stay in Charleston for me to complete my degrees. However, as he went through interviews we quickly came to realize that God’s plan differed from ours just a bit! Josh felt that Greenwood and Self were a great match for his residency and I had to admit I enjoyed the atmosphere of camaraderie that I experienced during the interview as well. Shortly after interviewing, we began working to find a way to make my program and his residency work in Greenwood. Through a variety of events that we still don’t even comprehend, we soon found ourselves moving to Greenwood, expecting a child, and planning for me to participate in a new clinical campus for MUSC in Anderson, SC – easy driving distance from Greenwood.\n\nTwo years later and it was my turn to apply for residency. After watching Josh complete his residency in Family Medicine at Self, I saw how interesting and versatile family medicine could be. Our experience with this program was even better than originally anticipated, and we had continued to enjoy the family-friendly, mutually supportive atmosphere this program offered all while remaining one of the top family medicine residencies in the southeast. This made an easy choice for me when deciding where I wanted to complete my training. So here we are, three years later, preparing for round two!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in a small town just outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I went to a small high school where I was able to play mainly football, basketball, and golf (along with a few other sports). I then chose to attend Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana; the same small college where my parents met in the 1980s. I was blessed with the opportunity to play a year of college football there while pursuing Biology, Chemistry, and my now wife, Shelby. I left Pineville for medical school in Shreveport, and Shelby and I were married during third year of medical school.\n\nI know without a doubt that it was the Lord’s guidance that led us to Greenwood. Shelby and I were lucky enough to go to a Family Medicine Interest Day in Columbia, SC during the fall of my fourth year of medical school where we happened to run into some of the residents and faculty from Self. We immediately felt a strong connection and ended up comparing every program to Self for the entirety of the interview season. I knew that I wanted to train at an unopposed program where I could get the most hands-on experience possible. I knew that I also wanted to stay in the South. And finally, I have a passion for sports medicine that is fueled by the conversations I’ve had with the residents and other faculty at Self. I felt like I would make a great physician anywhere I trained, but I saw the potential to grow as a person, friend, leader, and even husband at Self. I’m looking forward to training with these great people for the next few years!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nBorn and raised in West Virginia, that has always been my home … until now! I met my delightful wife in college when we were both serving on the same campus ministry leadership team together. We really love being active together … running, biking, and anything else outdoors is always fun for us. We also love watching movies together. I enjoy golfing, basketball, and experimenting with wood-building projects.\n\nI had my first interaction with the Self Regional Residency at the AAFP Conference in Kansas City, Missouri. My peer mentor from med school told me I would like the program, and I definitely did. When Cecelia and I interviewed at Self, I had an excellent experience with the faculty, residents, and staff. I was even more impressed that Carleigh made arrangements for Cecelia to spend time with some of the spouses while I was busy interviewing. That sense of community and caring really meant a lot to me! It was evident Self was the program for us. I anticipate this season of life will bring great growth in our lives professionally, spiritually, and relationally. We are so excited to live, work, and play in Greenwood!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in far southern Illinois in a small town called Metropolis, the official “Home of Superman.” My wife, Emma, and I grew up as neighbors; however, I didn’t manage to snag the girl next door until we were in college. We got married just before our senior year at Murray State University. Together we enjoy traveling, good food, and hiking with our dog (Bourbon). I am also a hunter, cyclist, and private pilot.\n\nMy interest in family medicine was sparked by a rural rotation in my home community with an excellent family physician. I plan to practice traditional family medicine in a rural community with combined inpatient and outpatient care of all ages. I was drawn to Self because I wanted to train at an unopposed program with a strong inpatient curriculum and high patient volume. When I came to Self for my interview, I felt a powerful sense of community and support from everyone I met. We are excited that God has led us to Greenwood, and I feel confident that I will receive excellent training here.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nMy name is Garrett Rowe and I’m from the beautiful upstate of South Carolina, more specifically Travelers Rest! Growing up in the country I grew to love fishing, farming, and raising all kinds of animals. I love fixing things and learning how they work. This is part of the reason I enjoy learning about how beautifully the Lord has designed us.\n\nI have spent the last eight years in Charleston where I met my beautiful wife Christy. We have an awesome golden doodle, Finn, whose only real skill is cuddling with his mom. Self stood out to both of us on the interview trail because of its people. Everyone is treated like family and the primary focus is showing love to the community. We are looking forward to spending the next three years in Greenwood, growing friendships and strengthening our faith.\n\nut will also grow and develop my love for people. The staff and residents at Self made it clear that they will quickly come to be part of my extended family, given the kindness and warmth I felt during my visits. I am thankful for the opportunity to train in such a supportive environment and I can’t wait to see what the next 3 year have in store.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in a tiny town in rural West Texas. Stanton is known for a sign on the interstate welcoming travelers stating it is “home of 3,000 friendly people and a few old soreheads.” My wife, Tracye, and I began our friendship when we were 11 years old at a summer church camp and married after college. After attending Texas A&M University and working as a civil engineer, I felt the calling to pursue a career as a family medicine physician. While it has been challenging, I have not once regretted the career change.\n\nTracye, Ethan (our 9 year old son) and I are thrilled and thankful to have matched at Self. I was impressed with the top-notch training provided in a community that feels like “family”. My medical interests include full-spectrum family medicine care with emphasis on underserved populations.\n\nWe enjoy reading books and traveling as a family, are sports enthusiasts and Texas Aggie fans, and look forward to welcoming a dog to the family soon.\n\n“Our greatest fear should not be of failure but of succeeding at things in life that don’t really matter.”\n\n— Francis Chan\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nAs a former army brat, I spent my childhood moving across the United States before ultimately settling down in Columbus, Georgia. I went to school at the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!), where I put my lifelong bookworm habits into use studying for my English degree. Afterward, I spent a couple of semesters in South Korea teaching English in elementary schools and spending time with my family there.\n\nWhile I love being tucked away in a corner with a good book, my favorite moments are found spending time with my family and friends, especially my niece (who is currently ranked #1 on my favorite people list). I love wandering around new places, seeking out local festivals, and playing board games—especially Settlers of Catan. I also love getting back to South Korea every chance I can!\n\nWhat ultimately drew me to Self Regional was a combination of amazing training and a truly family-like atmosphere. There is a genuine love of teaching and helping at the residency program and a lot of opportunities for hands on experience. Everyone—from the people in the program to everyone else I’ve met in Greenwood—is so welcoming. I have loved my time here so far and look forward to spending the next three years with people I respect and enjoy working with!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was originally born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and my family and I came to the States when I was 2 years old. After living in the big city of New York for about 4 years, we moved to the smaller (but still really big) city of Orlando, Florida where I grew up. It was strangely through choral music and music theater in high school that I found medicine while volunteering at a local hospital singing to patients. Obviously, God had been leading me on this path for a while!\n\nI left Orlando to move to the much smaller town of Tallahassee, Florida for college and then medical school. I have come to love Tallahassee dearly and knew it would take an amazing program (in addition to God’s guidance) to get me to leave the wonderful community I had developed there. I believe I have found that amazing program at Self Regional. I know I will get amazing training here to be able to pursue anything within the Family Medicine field. It was also important to me to feel at home with the residents and faculty and I absolutely do among like-minded individuals who are passionate about Family Medicine. I am excited to train at this wonderful program for the next three years and thankful to God for leading me here!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up on a family farm in rural South Dakota. I am the second oldest of four brothers so, needless to say, my mother had her hands full. On the farm I learned about hard work, respect, faith, and family. I loved sports growing up and I participated in fast pitch softball, baseball, football, basketball, and track. I love to be active and watch sports. I also enjoy running and going to the gym. In medical school, I met my wife, who is now beginning her residency in Family Medicine at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia. We recently welcomed our son Maverick into the world and we look forward to watching him grow.\n\nThe Army brought us to Georgia, and when I interviewed at Self I realized this was the program where I wanted to continue my medical training. The reason I was drawn to Self was number one the people. Everyone is truly kind and sincere and felt like one large family. Additionally, the training is very thorough and I feel it will prepare me to return to a rural community some day. As a sports enthusiast, I am very interested in the sports medicine track. I look forward to working with patients from all ages and becoming a part of the Self team.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born in Lima, Ohio, but I did most of my growing up in the suburbs outside of Atlanta. I have a little brother with cerebral palsy, who I love spending time with, and to whom I attribute my interest in medicine. I met my wonderful wife, Michelle, in high school (awww, high school sweethearts) and got married in college. I love the sport of rowing, which I discovered in college and still try to do when I can. I’m also a competitive bowler, and I’ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get my wife into it since we’ve met. We do love to do outdoorsy things together like hiking, walking, running, and adventuring. I also carefully balance my allegiances to the Buckeyes and the Bulldawgs, neither of which I’m sure will be easy in South Carolina!\n\nWe were initially drawn to Self by its reputation for training great doctors and providing the full-scope training necessary to work anywhere in the world treating all ages, doing procedures, and providing OB care. When we came for our interview, we found a family-friendly culture who we knew would take care of us during my residency training. This was proven by how extremely helpful the program director was in helping my wife get an interview for a great job in Greenwood shortly after we matched. I was also drawn to the residents’ and faculty’s commitment to serve the underserved in Greenwood and abroad. I have a passion to serve the poor and to serve in areas of need, and I found many residents and faculty at Self who share that same passion. We’re so excited to be joining these wonderful people!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nAlthough commonly asked if I’m from Georgia or sung a version of Ray Charles’ hit “Georgia on My Mind,” my name comes from my Grandpa, George. I’ve been living in South Carolina now for almost eight years and am enamored by the region. My favorite place to be is outside, preferably in the mountains or on the lake, with my dog Jackson and the people I love (most importantly!). Friends would describe me as adventurous, fun-loving, and optimistic. Discovering new places, ideas, people, and cultures brings me great joy. I think any situation can be overcome with some perspective and gratitude, and I believe in creating health for people and our planet. Interests in medicine include full-spectrum care, underserved populations and global health, procedures, women’s health, hospice care, and integrative medicine. Music, nature, and backpacking are my other loves.\n\nWhy Self? I interviewed at 20 programs from the East to the West Coast, and initially thought I wanted to spend residency in a big city. However, I did an away rotation at Self and fell in love. Not only is the program top-notch, but I felt truly at home and noticed an unmatched positivity and support among the residents and faculty. As for the city, Greenwood is a small town with big values. Everyone you meet is super friendly! Living here helps keep life simple, and my mind focused and clear in what can be a stressful time. I recently bought a small home where I started a food garden and welcomed three chickens…feel free to stop by for some goods 🙂 I am so happy with matching at Self and sincerely can’t wait to spend the next three years here!\n\nWords to live by:\n\nLet Love Lead.\n\nIf it doesn’t challenge you, it won’t change you.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in a small farming community in southwest Minnesota and from a young age had an urge to travel. I stayed in Minnesota for undergrad and so I initially wanted to move away for medical school. I am so glad I stayed because the very first day of medical school I met my adventurous husband, Ryan, who is also a resident at Self. During medical school, I pursued a Master of Public Health degree with a Global Health concentration and interest in health policy. It was during this time I developed a desire to practice full-spectrum family medicine in a small town and serve the community in a variety of ways.\n\nI love anything outdoors; hiking, climbing, camping and I’m particularly fond of biking. One of my favorite memories is biking up Mt. Rainier with Ryan. It seems like I’m always picking up a new creative hobby too, and some of my favorites are crocheting, music, and calligraphy.\n\nSelf was our very first stop on our interview trail. We felt like we were home from the minute we came to Greenwood and knew the people here were truly special. After that, every other place we interviewed was compared to Greenwood and the faculty and staff at Self. At Self we found exactly what we were searching for in a residency: unbeatable training, impressive academics, and a strong community in a fun place to live. We feel beyond blessed and excited to have joined the Self Regional community and to call Greenwood, South Carolina our home!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up near Cleveland, Ohio, and I’ve lived all over the East Coast. I received my undergraduate degree in psychology, and this experience enabled me to meet my wife. We enjoy music, film, and outdoor activities including hiking, gardening, kayaking and going to the beach with our dog.\n\nI intend to practice full-scope rural medicine and I have many interests including obstetrics. It was important to me to find an unopposed program with high patient volume that provides outstanding opportunities to develop procedural skills, while pursuing my current interests and exploring others. After visiting Self Regional, I found the program offers all of this and so much more. It became immediately evident that the mentorship and training available at Self would enable me to become the physician that I envision myself becoming.\n\nOf equal importance is the strong family atmosphere shared by everyone I have met, creating a supportive and encouraging environment that will allow me to optimize every opportunity offered here. This family atmosphere extends beyond the hospital doors and out into the community, which is filled with some of the kindest and most welcoming people that I have ever met. My wife and I both look forward to spending at least the next three years in Greenwood!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI am a native South Carolinian and grew up in Lexington, where my family still resides. From there I took my marginal football talents and interest in biology to Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina (where the tea is sweet and the t is silent). After a proud four years as a Bluehose, I left with a biology degree and my future wife, Anna, which they threw in for no extra charge. With her I definitely out-kicked my coverage, and we are thrilled to finally be married after a courtship spanning her law school in Charleston and my medical school in Spartanburg. In addition to my passion for sports, I am a collector of hobbies with varying interest from Brazillian Jui-Jitsu, to fountain pens, cooking, and bass fishing. My wife and I share our newest hobby, which is spoiling our new “Whoodle” named Ash, who is a Wheaten Terrier/Poodle mix.\n\nAnna and I chose Self Regional because it felt like home. Interestingly, our first date was at the Outback Steakhouse in town since the food options are limited in Clinton. I feel the quality of training in the unopposed setting here speaks for itself, but after spending time here as a medical student, I knew most importantly that the faculty, residents, and staff are some of the kindest, welcoming, and knowledgeable people I could ever hope to train alongside. Thankfully the Lord has reaffirmed those feelings at every turn, and going forward I know that this was a place I will not only grow as a physician, but equally as a person.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in a small town in Mississippi, and being the son of a football coach, sports have always been a big part of my life. I grew up playing baseball, football, and golf, and I continued playing baseball through college. I also have a passion for music and started playing several musical instruments early in life. In college I decided to take voice lessons, which led me to sing with the Mississippi Opera. I met my wife in college, and we were married shortly after graduation.\n\nWe were drawn to Self for a variety of reasons, but mainly it was the people. I knew after my interview that this was the perfect fit and this was where God was calling us to be. We are excited about raising our family here for the next few years!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in a small town in Oklahoma. I studied close to home at the University of Oklahoma for undergrad and medical school. My husband, Reese, is a high school science teacher and coach. We love traveling, both around Oklahoma to see family and overseas. We had the great opportunity to spend time in Uganda this year and can’t wait to return. I also enjoy riding horses and catching up on my favorite tv shows. Reese loves anything sports-related.\n\nAlthough I am an Oklahoma girl at heart, I was actually born in Greenville, South Carolina. I still have family that live about an hour away from Greenwood and always loved visiting. South Carolina is full of kind-hearted people, sweet tea and serene trees, not to mention Charleston and the ocean. It always felt like a second home so we were excited for the opportunity to live here for a few years during residency. I explored many programs in the state and had an instant connection with Self Regional. I plan to practice full-scope rural medicine, and Self Regional had all of the qualities I was seeking, unopposed, high-volume with many patients with a rural background, an obstetrics track and strong international medicine opportunities. I know that I will receive mentorship from outstanding faculty for all areas of life, not just medicine. I also greatly appreciate the program’s strong commitment to family and faith. Reese and I feel blessed to call Greenwood home for a few years!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in Columbia, SC and attended Heathwood Hall, a small school on the Congaree River where both of my parents taught. I studied Biology as an undergraduate at Wofford College (we’ll sometimes show up in your NCAA bracket) up the road in Spartanburg, SC before returning to Columbia for medical school at USC where I found my calling for Family Medicine.\n\nI love spending time with my incredible family. My older brother, Wills, is also a teacher and football coach in Atlanta, Ga. My dad, recently retired, is always up for adventure. He is an avid boater, so we enjoy getting outside to go camping, fishing, or just cruising. My mother teaches music and is the real boss of the family and a saint for putting up with us men. My lovely girlfriend Frances, whom I met in high school, is an environmental engineer in Columbia. She and I enjoy traveling together and spending time outside with my beloved dog “Jeb”. In addition to the outdoors, I enjoy photography, drawing, and painting- although I’m a novice at all three.\n\nI chose Self Regional for so many of its great qualities. The mission of this program is to train the best family physicians in America, and it is clear to me that they do just that. The faculty is not only vast and experienced but is completely dedicated to Self and the residency program with an academic environment second to none. Greenwood is a wonderful small-town community, and the family at Self is full of the most welcoming people I’ve ever met. I knew that by choosing Self I will have the option to experience whatever I become interested in and am so happy to call Greenwood home!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nHey Everyone! My name is Reid Castellone and I’m originally from Charleston, South Carolina. I received my undergraduate degree from Boston College where I majored in biology, following in my dad’s footsteps. Although I had always known I wanted to be a doctor, my application was not quite competitive for medical school when I graduated in 2008, so I next pursued a Master of Science in Biology from East Carolina University in Greenville, NC. Although my time at ECU was great for a medical school application, doing research, teaching, and taking classes, I quickly realized biomedical research was not for me, further cementing my desires to go to medical school. Fortunately, the University of South Carolina School of Medicine’s admission committee offered me a spot in their 2015 class in the winter of 2011, which brings me to writing this statement four years later!\n\nThe best thing of my time in medical school was meeting my fiancée, Chelsea. We got engaged the day after matching at Self when she clearly was not thinking right due to the excitement of match day. However, weeks have gone by and she still hasn’t rescinded her acceptance, so I guess she is stuck with me for the long hall…and I cannot wait to spend my life with her! We love watching Carolina and BC football games, playing with out dogs Max and Jasper, visiting our families in Charleston and Savannah, and traveling.\n\nIn terms of why I chose Greenwood, it all started over steaks and wine with Dr. Tiller and current residents David and Stefani in Kansas City. It was there I learned of the excellent, full spectrum training the residents receive in Greenwood, with the program’s goal being not to only produce the best residents in South Carolina, but in the country. My father, who is a family doctor in Summerville, SC where he practices traditional family medicine, had always served as my model for how I wanted to practice and treat my patients, and it seemed to me that the Self Family Medicine Residency would train me to do just this. Furthermore, Dr. Tiller and the entire Self community are genuinely great people, and they were amazing at helping my fiancée, who is a PA, find a job. It was the training and the people who truly cemented my desire to train at Self in Greenwood, and I was fortunate enough to match here.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any and all questions!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota as the oldest four and my siblings are some my best friends. Growing up, I developed a love for reading and still read as often as possible. I got into running (not fast, but for fun) in college and now enjoy running races whenever I can, especially “fun runs.” I also enjoy camping, hiking, and being outdoors. While in college I spent my summers working at a kids’ camp in central Minnesota which is where I met my husband, Jordan. He is the biggest blessing in my life and I am so grateful for him! We love spending time just doing life together as newlyweds.\n\nUltimately the Lord led us to Self and we knew right away it was His plan for us to be here as it was such a perfect fit. We chose Self Regional for the combination of the training and the community. No other place had such a great combination of the two. We were impressed with the academics and experience residents receive here and knew that was vital to our choice. Also, when we came to visit we loved the people; all the residents, faculty and staff as well as the small glimpse we got of the community of Greenwood. It already felt like home and we knew this was the best place for me to train to be a full spectrum family doctor.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in the beautiful paradise of Costa Rica! I left home with the dream of validating my Costa Rican medical license here in the US, and I made it happen with the amazing help and invaluable support of my wonderful family and friends. I enjoy movies at home or at the theater, love the outdoors and my favorite thing to do is travel. I want to explore the whole world so you can imagine my bucket list is very, very, very long!\n\nI chose Family Medicine because I love the long-term relationship with the patients and becoming part of their lives. I believe that time is the most precious gift of all and I want to share that gift with my patients. I was looking for a program that cared about the patient as a whole, that cared just as much for the residents’ well being, where I could become a better person and physician, and if possible, located in a small town with a great sense of community where I could really make a difference.\n\nHow did I end up in Greenwood, SC all the way from paradise on Earth (Costa Rica)? That journey is one that I like to share with who ever is interested and to this day I get emotional every time I, because it fills my heart with joy and gratitude with God for what seemed small decisions and coincidences brought me here. It’s a long story, but if you are interested I can share it with you when you come visit! Greenwood was love at first sight for me. I immediately saw a united community filled with kind and welcoming people. Self was my first interview, and where I found everything on my list of an ideal program (which I thought I was not going to be able to find), and I found even more. Self has great faculty and staff, awesome residents, genuine care for the patients, and an environment that truly feels like family. It offers a very complete and challenging curriculum that I’m sure will mold me into the great, ready for anything, kind and compassionate physician I want to become. I felt at home. Ever since that very first visit, Self became my first option for my residency program, and Greenwood the place I wanted to spend the next 3 years of my life, and who knows? I enjoy it so much I may end up staying for good!! 🙂\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI was born and raised in a small mountain in north Georgia. Throughout my childhood sports has been a huge part of my life. I particularly enjoyed football, golf, basketball, and baseball. Naturally, growing up in the mountains I was also in the outdoors quite a bit either fishing, hiking, or camping. I attended the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!) where I received a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry. More importantly, it was where I met my beautiful wife. We share a passion for following Jesus and showing His love by serving others. Shortly after graduation we got married and left for medical school in Dominica. Our experience on the island was amazing, and it afforded us the opportunity to grow closer together as a couple and in our faith with Jesus.\n\nI first interviewed at Greenwood because I knew it was an unopposed program with a strong resume of producing great physicians. However, it was not just the quality of the program that sold me, but it was the people. They care about your personal development just as much as your professional development. From the moment my wife and I arrived it felt like home. There is such a strong community and support system not only among the residents and faculty, but among the spouses as well. Self Regional also provides many additional opportunities that interest me such as the track programs, international medical mission trips, and the sports medicine fellowship. We are so thankful that the Lord has brought us to such an amazing place!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up outside of Richmond, VA in a family full of Virginia Tech graduates. I soon followed suit and spent my college years in Blacksburg, VA,cheering on the Hokies. Here I found a love for the mountain scenery and fresh mountain air. I also discovered an urge to travel and found myself traveling to work in undeveloped countries. It was hard to ignore the needs of the undeserved people, so I applied for medical school in hopes of going back with a new skill set one day. While in medical school I met my best friend, Clay, when we interviewed on the same day. I liked him so much I married him. He convinced me to move to his home state of Georgia for our clinical years where I am learning to love southern cooking, farming, shooting, and wearing camo and Carhartt. You’ll find me the most relaxed when I’m in the sun and near the water surrounded by friends and family.\n\nFinding Self Regional Family Medicine Residency was an answer to prayer and an unexpected blessing. Clay and I were tired and burnt out when we got to our last interview (Self), but left feeling revived. We immediately knew that we fit in with the Self family and enjoyed the people so much that we didn’t want to leave! It was obvious that the quality of the program was unparalleled. We are so happy to be calling Greenwood, SC our home for the next few years!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI come from a small farming community in northeast Georgia where we work hard and play hard. I love anything outside; hunting, fishing, hiking, climbing, and about any athletic sport there is. I’m particularly fond of rugby, which I played during medical school. My favorite pastime, though, is being a volunteer fireman. It’s a family tradition and I’ve been hanging out at the firehouse for as long as I can remember.\n\nAfter college, I spent a couple years working at a church, school and clinic serving an unreached tribe in Africa. It was there that the Lord led me into medical school, which wasn’t in the original plan. I’m thankful for it though, because while in med school I met my wonderful wife, Lauren, who is also a resident at Self. Lauren and I have a desire to practice small town medicine and to serve overseas someday as missionary doctors.\n\nSelf was the last stop on our interview trail. We almost didn’t come, we were so worn out. Wow, would that have been a mistake. We felt like we were home from the minute we set foot in Greenwood. The faculty, staff, and residents were more than friendly. We immediately felt like we fit in. We left knowing there was nowhere else for us to be. We count it a blessing and are very thankful we get to train at Self Regional Healthcare.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI am a native South Carolinian who, after spending roughly 10 years out of state attending college and medical school, found myself returning home in order to be closer to family, friends and my roots. I eventually would find my husband, who, ironically, attended my high school and we are now endeavoring on toward parenthood with extreme excitement and joy.\n\nI selected the Self Regional residency program for its reputation for being exceptional to other prominent programs. Unlike many others, Self’s program is extremely comprehensive in terms of exposure to varying areas of care and this lack of limitation has certainly provided a far more well-rounded education and experience that will undoubtedly serve invaluable in my career as a physician.\n\nIn addition to this high caliber hands-on education, I very much value Self’s awareness of the need for work/life balance and its accommodations in meeting our life’s needs outside of work. The staff is caring, understanding and focused on molding each resident into the best physician he or she can be.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nMy name is Robert Rashad Brightharp. Everyone calls me Rashad. I grew up in Edgefield, SC. Edgefield is famous for two important reasons. First, it was the hometown of ten of South Carolina’s past Governors. Second, it was also the hometown of the late great Senator Strom Thurmond. Because of Edgefield’s rich history, you may ask why such a handsome, intelligent, and ambitious young man decided against a career in law and politics. The truth is science was always more interesting to me, and after years of hard work I find myself here as a resident in my third year of residency training at Self Regional Hospital.\n\nWhen I started medical school my ambition was to become a pathologist. During my third year medical school clerkships I realized that interaction with patients was more fun and energizing to me than looking at specimens under a microscope. I chose family medicine because I liked people of all ages, I liked the variety, and the broad training would serve me well should I choose to return to my hometown to practice. Edgefield County is a rural area. I chose Self Regional for residency because the education is first rate, and as a bonus the residency is only an hour away from where I grew up. During my leisure time I enjoy running, sleeping, eating barbeque pork, watching football, and above all else spending time with my family. I have no children of my own yet, but all of my siblings have children. Thus far I have a total of eight nieces and nephews. Because of the proximity, I get to cheer them on at their sporting events as well as spoil them on a regular basis. Life is good!\n\nAs for the future, I have decided to return to Edgefield, South Carolina to begin my practice. My contract is signed, and I will start working next year. I have enjoyed my time here at Self Regional. I encourage anyone who is interested in Family Medicine to contact us! You will not regret it!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI’m originally from Columbia, South Carolina and completed my undergraduate degree from North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina. Then, I completed medical school at Boston University School of Medicine. Unfortunately, I don’t have very many cool hobbies, but I do enjoy having a good time. I’ve always enjoyed science and being able to learn more. It seems that a passion for medicine naturally followed. I’ve been a reader since the time I picked up my first book and continue to enjoy reading to this day. I also enjoy watching movies and spending time with my family. I especially enjoy time with my husband as we cultivate our still very new marriage together. Together we’ve found a passion for traveling and learning new things about new places.\n\nAlthough we didn’t know much about Greenwood, my husband and I were instantly drawn to the other residents, faculty, and staff at Self Regional. We felt as if we were being embraced by a new family. It was a perfect fit.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI’m a native Alabamian, born and raised outside of Huntsville, the Rocket City. That location, combined with having parents that have built things that have gone into space, it’s no surprise I wanted to be an astronaut as a kid — it’s no surprise that I love astronomy! But that plan was scrapped after I took my first anatomy class in high school and went overseas on a medical mission trip, ultimately leading to where I am today. I try to go on international medical trips as often as I can, and I’ve been to Central and South America as well as Africa (where the donuts in Swaziland beat the pants off of Krispy Kreme!). I love doing things outdoors, whether it’s kayaking on a lake, reading a book on the porch, or shooting my rifles at the target range, especially if I’m doing those things with my fiancé, Tim. We met in college (Go Blazers!), and we are getting married in November 2014! We look forward to starting this exciting new phase in life and seeing what God has in store for us! Oh, did I mention that I’m a huge Star Wars fan?\n\nThe main reason I chose to do my residency at Self Regional is because it was the only program where I instantly felt like I fit in. I interviewed at over ten programs and liked many of them, but I just didn’t experience the same “click” as when I visited Self Regional. From the first interaction during my interview experience to the last, it was obvious that I had a lot in common with everyone in the program. The faculty and residents shared my faith, my high prioritizing of family in life, my desire to work hard and learn as much as possible, and my desire to work with positive, supporting people. When I returned for a second visit with Tim, he quickly felt welcomed and knew after one day that this program was where I was supposed to be, and our mutual opinions of the program solidified my decision.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI’m a South Carolina native and love just about anything that happens outdoors! My wife Casey and I love to hike in the foothills near Greenville whenever we get a chance. We both enjoy running, cycling, and swimming as well. Oh, and I can’t forget to mention that I love to bake as many confections as I can when time permits. My wife is also a medical student, soon to graduate. We look forward to building a family and being able to practice medicine nearby!\n\nMy wife grew up in a small town about 15 minutes away from Greenwood called Ware Shoals, and we knew we loved the area and would enjoy being close to family. We are starting to build a family of our own and it’s great to have grandparents and aunts nearby! We are looking forward to the years God has for us here!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up moving all over the country and abroad with my father in the military. We settled down in my parents’ hometown of Lexington, Kentucky after my dad retired from the Army. I did my undergrad at the College of Charleston where I met my amazing husband, who is a South Carolina native. While I was in medical school, my husband went back to school and became a critical care nurse. We absolutely love both working in the medical field and being at the same hospital. I was fortunate to participate in the Rural Physicians Leadership Program with the University of Kentucky, placing me in eastern Kentucky at a regional hospital for my third and fourth clinical years. This is where I fell in love with full spectrum family medicine. I also love traveling and have participated in several medical missions in the states and abroad. We hope to continue this throughout our careers.\n\nCurrently, my husband is an ER nurse at Self, we are going on 10 years of marriage, have twin toddlers and a little girl due in December. The season of young children is wonderful and busy. Having twins during intern year and another on the way as a third year, we can attest that the residency is not only family-friendly but very supportive of growing families.\n\nMy husband and I choose Self regional because of the people. The faculty and residents are amazing and we thoroughly enjoy working with them all. We also liked that the residency is very service-minded, and a lot of graduates go on to pursue careers serving underserved populations.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nSo … Where to begin? I grew up in a small costal town in Florida where the outdoors became a huge part of my life. Whether it be golf, tennis, hunting or fishing I could not get enough of it. Then I headed north to Pennsylvania College where my love of the outdoors continued as I became the president of the ski club. My next journey in life took me out to west to Telluride, Colorado where I was part of the ski patrol for a year before heading to medical school. Between graduating medical school and starting residency I got married to my beautiful wife.\n\nWe both have a love for medicine, as she just graduated from Wake Forest School of Medicine with a Physicians Assistant degree and works in a local clinic. We both love the Greenwood area as it offers a plethora of outdoor activities as well being conveniently located near Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina with all the shopping and amenities one could ask for. We chose Self Regional because it offered the best of both worlds: an unopposed program with the volume and resources necessary for a great education.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI’m originally from Seneca, SC. I went to a small Christian university in Indiana where I met my sweet bride, Elise. Together, we have two kiddos — a loveable smiley red headed boy and a sweet baby girl. In my time away from work, I love to camp, hike, and work in my yard (especially harvesting the best pecans in South Carolina). I also build furniture and have completed a kitchen renovation in our 1950s brick mill home. We love our church and doing ministry in our neighborhood. We are also passionate about international missions. Our family is on the trajectory to pursuing full time missions work post residency, and are excited to see where God leads us.\n\nI chose Self for my residency training because it provides the experience and training that best prepare me for work in an underserved area. We also are so grateful for the built in support the program provides me and my family. I love the people I work with, from the support staff to the residents and faculty. We are so glad to be in Greenwood at Self!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in the booming metropolis of Dillon, SC where I had easy access to South of the Border and the beach. There was not much to do in Dillon other than play sports so baseball, basketball, golf, water skiing, wakeboarding, and surfing were and continue to be some of my favorite activities. I attended Duke University for undergrad where I camped out with the Crazies during basketball season every year but still managed to miss seeing any victories over UNC at Cameron. From there, I went to Charleston for med school. Between studying, surfing, and intramural sports I happened to meet and marry my best friend. These days, I spend most of my time hanging out with my beautiful wife, son, and yellow lab in Greenwood.\n\nI knew the program was academically strong and would meet what I was looking for in a residency. However, the people that make up the program are what sold me. I wanted to be at a place with faculty that I could model myself after, not only as a physician but as a husband, father, and leader in the community. I found just that at Self Regional. I also found that the residents here had similar desires as me, people with whom I could grow and learn as much as possible. I am thankful that the Lord placed me in Greenwood and can not imagine being anywhere else.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nGreetings! My name is Billy Buselmeier, and I am from the great state of Tennessee. I’d like to tell you a little bit about myself by describing some of the things I value most in life. Among the top is my family. I have truly the sweetest wife in the world, Amy, and love my parents, brother and sister-in-law, and all my wife’s family dearly. I jump at any chance to get outdoors. Whether that’s relaxing in the backyard in our hammock, hiking to one of the waterfalls in the Southeast, or taking a rod-and-reel out fishing, any time in nature is time well spent. Traveling is great fun! The picture above is from the coast of California, up which my wife and I recently drove… in a Mustang convertible 🙂 Lastly and most importantly, I am a follower of Jesus. I try my best to live out my faith by loving and serving others, depending on God’s grace to help me understand what life is truly about.\n\nMy wife and I chose to come to Greenwood for residency for many reasons. The education here, as evidenced by our board scores and ACGME accreditation cycle length, is second to none. From the adult ICU and the pediatrics floor, to labor & delivery and our out-patient clinic, the breadth and diversity of patient-care opportunities we residents have here gives us a great opportunity to practice full-spectrum family medicine. This is a wonderful place to learn to be an excellent family physician. But equally as important, Amy and I found here amongst the residents and faculty a home-away-from-home. We have made friendships here that will last long after residency ends. We got that feeling during the interview experience, and found it to be true when we started here in July 2013. I’d choose Greenwood again in a second. I look forward to seeing you here!\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nMy husband, Brett, and I were not particularly interested in coming back to South Carolina for residency. We’d met in Nashville, TN in college, and then moved to the mountains of Eastern KY for med school. We loved the hiking and the gorgeous scenery of Appalachia. And, having been married a few years, we were eager to explore other parts of the country. We have hobbies that you can take anywhere: cooking, movies, video games (I’m unashamedly a video game fan), books (particularly theology…I particularly like Merton, Brett likes Augustine and Aquinas. We’re basically nerds.). Throw in a little outdoors for camping and hiking, and we’re pretty satisfied. So the location of South Carolina (despite me being from the state) wasn’t a huge pull when we started on the residency interview trail.\n\nSelf was my first interview, and I already had been impressed with the quality of the residents I’d met at a residency fair. When I left the interview day, I knew everywhere else I went would have to be measured against Self Regional. I loved the camaraderie and respect between the residents and faculty. The inpatient training is superb and their curriculum challenging. And I appreciated the interest the staff took in not only me as a candidate, but also my husband (who is non-medical). I wanted to be at a residency that would equip me to do practically anything after residency, and do it well. Self Regional clearly had that sort of program. After interviewing at several other stellar programs, it was clear that Self Regional was still where I wanted to train.\n\nI’m in my second year now, and I couldn’t be happier with my place at this residency. Brett and I just had our first child and the support for me as a physician and now a mother has been great. Self Regional is the kind of residency that attracts faculty and residents that, of course, want to be exceptional physicians, but it also is a place where I’m encouraged to be a better person. That’s just as important to me. I wasn’t looking to come back to the Southeast for residency, but I’m thankful now that I stumbled across those Self Regional residents at a residency fair. I couldn’t be happier to be here.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up the oldest of two brothers in Aiken, SC. My father was a hospital pharmacist and my mother was an ICU nurse. My brother is a chemical engineer after graduating from Clemson University here in South Carolina. I always had a fascination with medicine, and my parents were always supportive of my education. All of that education paid off when it allowed me to meet my wife, Marie, who is an occupational therapist. We met while both of us were studying at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, SC. Outside of school I enjoy reading, particularly about the history of medicine and the history of the Church. I also love jogging with my two year old Chocolate Lab, Annie. Marie and I also have a 6 month old Boston Terrier, Lucy.\n\nI knew that any program I chose needed to have outstanding faculty, a solid curriculum, and colleagues that I knew I would enjoy working with. I felt that as a regional hospital, Self offered access to a wide range of pathology without interference from other residents in specialty programs. I found all of those positive characteristics here at SRH after starting my internship. It was my month long rotation here as a fourth year medical student that let me know that SRH was not simply window dressing the program for interview season, but had a consistent tradition of bringing a diverse group of residents together as a family while teaching them to be leaders in family medicine throughout the country.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI enjoy plenty of activities and I am made happy by sharing life with a beautiful family. My wife’s secret mission is to keep me balanced in all things. I play soccer, ultimate frisbee, and any other sport which involves heavy sweating. We are actively involved in living out our faith and have partnered with an amazing church body. I enjoy a movie or two post-call and will dabble in the arts of drawing from time to time. Our family loves the outdoors and my mission is to introduce my 2 year old little girl to as many creepy crawlers as possible before she thinks they are “yucky”. We are thankful for all that we have and blessed with our current circumstances. Our plan is to head back to Sierra Leone, West Africa and serve in the mission field within the next few years.\n\nI thought that the program at Self offered a wide array of skill set development to allow me to become the best well rounded physician I could be. We knew that moving to the beautiful state of South Carolina would offer a taste of new culture and plenty of opportunity for exploration and new experiences.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI am from a rural town in Tennessee and went into medicine to do rural primary care. I have always loved living in “the country” and the outdoor activities that are so prevalent there. I grew up hunting, fishing, and working outdoors, and I could never imagine a better lifestyle. I married my wife Sheri just before medical school. We now have two little girls, and our third child is on the way.\n\nMy family and I are are very blessed to be in Greenwood, SC. I chose Self Regional for residency for the strength in training, and the amazing people. I knew I wanted to do rural primary care that included both inpatient and outpatient medicine, so I wanted a program that trained me to do both well. It was important to me to have strong inpatient training as I planned on being one of very few doctors in my future area. Also, the residents and faculty here are excellent. They are great teachers, are open to communication and change, and always have your back. As I get ready to graduate this year, I would not change a thing.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nI grew up in the midlands of South Carolina but have come to love the upstate since moving to Greenwood for residency. I met my lovely wife Rimmy while in medical school in Columbia, SC. The Lord has blessed us with 2 children (age 3 and 4) with a third child due in April, 2015. Our favorite family activities include hiking together at beautiful Parson’s Mountain or Star Fort, both located in the greater Greenwood area!\n\nThere were many reasons I chose to come to the family medicine residency at Self Regional. I loved the sports medicine curriculum and the opportunity to be team physician for a small regional high school football team. I loved the strong inpatient focus and training in the management of critical illness. But ultimately, I wanted to learn from the positive attitudes and diligence I saw in the residents and faculty I met here."
