        "text": "Jeremy Alistair Lynch[1] (born: July 28, 1988 (1988-07-28) [age 36]) and William Jonathan \"Billy\" Wingrove[2] (born: December 17, 1982 (1982-12-17) [age 41]), better online known as the F2 Freestylers (also known as the F2 Football Freestylers and often shortened to simply the F2), are English YouTubers best known for their football freestyling videos.\n\nAbout[]\n\nJeremy Lynch[]\n\nJeremy Lynch was born in London, England, United Kingdom on July 28, 1989. As a child, he played football and dreamed of playing professionally. When he was 15 years old, he was released from his football club because he didn’t understand the game enough, and his movement was poor, so he went to university and got his Coaching Badges.[3] In 2008, he went on Britain’s Got Talent for freestyle football,[4] and he decided to continue doing freestyle instead of trying to go professional because he enjoyed it more. Jeremy has his own YouTube channel.\n\nBilly Wingrove[]\n\nBilly Wingrove was born in London, England, United Kingdom on December 17, 1982. Similar to Jeremy, he played football as a child and dreamed of playing professionally. He started playing semi-professional at the age of 16. When he turned 19, he took an interest in freestyle football and started earning money for his tricks. Around this time, he decided that he would continue doing freestyle instead of trying to play professionally because he believed he was closer to being the best freestyler than being the best professional footballer.\n\nOther ventures[]\n\nClothing lines[]\n\nJeremy and Billy have founded two clothing lines, The F2 store, which is mainly merchandise for their YouTube channel, and Rascal Clothing, a lifestyle brand that sells active wear.\n\n[]\n\nIn 2016, they hosted the NBCSN 6 part miniseries It’s Called Football. The aim of the series was to give an insight into the Premier League and what goes on behind the scenes. They featured four different sides, which were Arsenal, Chelsea, West Ham, and Southampton.\n\nF2 Talent[]\n\nIn 2018, the duo created a football management agency named F2 Talent. The pair hired a licensed intermediary Leon Anderson, who left his old agency to join F2 Talent, due to neither Jeremy or Billy having their own intermediary license. Leon brought over all of his clients to the new agency, including Liverpool’s England Under-17 international Rhian Brewster.[5]\n\nF2 Revolution[]\n\nF2 Revolution was an agency created in the same vein as F2 Talent, except instead of football talent, it was created for the next generation of social talent. It was created to give opportunities to younger individuals, under the age of 16, as well as older, who approach the agency themselves looking to unlock opportunities and build their profile.\n\nTrivia[]\n\n\"F2\" doesn't stand for anything."
