        "text": "Soccer Aid is back for another edition, with the worlds of sport and celebrity colliding in an effort to raise as much cash for charity as possible.\n\nSome of the biggest names on the planet are coming together in aid of Unicef, as the popularity of the event continues to grow year on year.\n\nNew signings this year include cricketer Stuart Broad, reality star Sam Thompson, Strictly Come Dancing contestant Bobby Brazier and footballing superstar Eden Hazard.\n\nEngland will be managed by Frank Lampard, Harry Redknapp and singer Robbie Williams, while the World XI will be coached by former Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nOne or two selections might leave viewers scratching their heads, though, with comedian Lee Mack and presenter Roman Kemp turning out for the world side rather than England.\n\nIn Kemp's case, the reason is he holds dual citizenship in the US and UK having been born in Los Angeles. Mack has Irish heritage.\n\nSpeaking to the Mirror, Kemp said: \"I was speaking to Leo Woodall the other day, the lad from the new series on Netflix and I'm like 'Oh my God, congrats man on the new series,' and he goes 'Yeah, yeah it's great, I need to do Soccer Aid, who do I speak to? How can I get in?' People are obsessed. There are two things people want in the industry and that's to do Soccer Aid and get a Nandos black card, that's it.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's an amazing time, what it seems on the exterior is this really serious match but it's such a wonderful vibe, everyone is friendly, everyone is happy to be there and it raises so much money, you hear people say it but it's really for a good cause. You see where the money's going and we get to live out our childhood dreams.\n\n\"You've got these fully grown men and women that are melting at the fact that we're able to go out in these stadiums with legends and these are the parts of the job of someone that is in the industry, this is the great perk of the job.\"\n\nEngland XI\n\nCaptain: Jill Scott (Former footballer)\n\nSteven Bartlett (Entrepreneur)\n\nBobby Brazier (Actor and Strictly star)\n\nStuart Broad (Former cricketer)\n\nAlex Brooker (TV personality)\n\nGary Cahill (Former footballer)\n\nKaren Carney (Former footballer)\n\nJoe Cole (Former footballer)\n\nJermain Defoe (Former footballer)\n\nErin Doherty (Actor)\n\nDanny Dyer (Actor)\n\nSir Mo Farah (Olympic gold medalist)\n\nTom Grennan (Musician)\n\nEddie Hearn (Boxing promoter)\n\nDavid James (Former footballer)\n\nPaddy McGuinness (TV personality)\n\nMiniminter (YouTuber)\n\nSamantha Quek (Former hockey player/TV personality)\n\nSam Thompson (King of the Jungle)\n\nTheo Walcott (Former footballer)\n\nEllen White (Former footballer)\n\nJack Wilshere (Former footballer)\n\nCoaches\n\nFrank Lampard (Former footballer)\n\nHarry Redknapp (Former football manager)\n\nDavid Seaman (Former footballer)\n\nVicky McClure (Actor)\n\nRobbie Williams (Musician)\n\nSkills coach: Billy Wingrove (Freestyle footballer)\n\nWorld XI\n\nCaptain: Usain Bolt (Fastest ever human)\n\nMaisie Adam (Comedian)\n\nTheo Baker (YouTuber)\n\nTony Bellew (Former boxer)\n\nRoberto Carlos (Former footballer)\n\nPetr Cech (Former footballer)\n\nMartin Compston (Actor)\n\nAlessandro Del Piero (Former footballer)\n\nDiamond (Gladiator)\n\nMichael Essien (Former footballer)\n\nPatrice Evra (Former footballer)\n\nTommy Fury (Boxer)\n\nEden Hazard (Former footballer)\n\nRoman Kemp (Radio host)\n\nKaylyn Kyle (Former footballer)\n\nLee Mack (Comedian)\n\nJason Manford (Comedian)\n\nJohn Obi Mikel (Former footballer)\n\nEmmett J.
