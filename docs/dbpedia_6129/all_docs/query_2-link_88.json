        "text": "Are social media influencers merely hype? Does influencer marketing really work? Most marketers say it does. In fact, influencer marketing seems to be giving traditional advertising a run for its money because influencers are way more effective at engaging audiences than traditional media like TV, radio, print, or outdoor billboards.\n\nOur smartphones are now an undeniable extension of our being; studies have even shown that subjects suffer from symptoms synonymous with ‘missing limb syndrome’ when they are taken away.\n\nWe’re now effectively cybernetic organisms that made a monumental mental migration into cyberspace at the dawn of the new millennium. Much to the delight of savvy tech-entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, our devices are rarely ever more than an arms length away. For that reason, internet marketers must be rubbing their hands in glee too.\n\nThis reason we are so dependent on this modern handheld technology is because it is inextricably linked to the efficiency and efficacy with which we navigate and succeed in our everyday lives.\n\nCan’t find an answer to that question? Google it. Can’t figure out how to get to your destination? Look it up on Maps. Struggling to reach and engage your audience? Try influencer marketing.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, influencer marketing is likely to become $15 billion industry by 2022. The customer acquisition rate and ROI from influencer marketing is pretty impressive too. Even though brands might calculate ROI differently, they all agree that influencer marketing truly works.\n\nIt’s a relatively new phenomenon but has opened the floodgates for advertisers to get products and services in front of consumers’ screen-stuck, star-struck eyes.\n\nEvery day we see lots of advertising. It suffocatingly surrounds us. It’s no wonder people are trying to avoid ads and ignore annoying calls to action. But businesses need promotion, and that’s why companies now seek to attract people’s attention by enticing an opinion leader to tell their followers about something they could be really interested in.\n\nAccording to the recent influencer marketing statistics, up to 60% of consumers make their purchases due to recommendations on social networks. Impressive, isn’t it?\n\nWhat is influencer marketing and why does it work?\n\nAn influencer is a person who actively uses social platforms and has a certain scope of interests. They may be bloggers, journalists, celebrities, or simply other people that have a large following.\n\nSo, influencer marketing is a type of advertising where a brands’ promotion is maintained with the help of people who have influence in social networks. This method can help companies to increase brand awareness, grow loyalty, create unique content, get honest feedback, and importantly, attract a new audience.\n\nAside from the benefits listed above, influencer marketing works because of four key reasons:\n\nConsumers trust influencers: 88% of consumers trust online recommendations as much as personal ones.\n\nInfluencers create quality content: They already know how to capture the attention of and subsequently influence their audience – hence why they don the moniker – and can reveal a product in the best, most ‘natural’ way.\n\nInfluencer marketing doesn’t suffer from ad-blocking: Hundreds of millions of people use Adblock apps. But people can’t block an influencers’ post, even if it has a promotional nature. Moreover, they won’t even think of that – because influencer’s posts are interesting to them. They will view, read, discuss, and engage.\n\nInfluencer marketing will give you precious insights about your consumers and their needs: When you cooperate with content creators, you always get vital market feedback in the form of users’ likes, shares, and comments.\n\nBrands big, small, and everything in between can benefit from this model, as they can search for the influencers they want and negotiate deals with them directly at the click of a few buttons. Product gifting, cash payments, equity and royalties are just some of the enticing components of an influencer marketing offer.\n\nBut influencer marketing is not something that the football world has fully explored. Sure, some clubs have dipped their toes in the water, but on the whole the soccersphere has largely failed to realize the untapped opportunity here.\n\nHasn’t it been done before?\n\nIt would be too simple – and a waste of your time – for me to suggest sports sponsorships are the way forward. Clubs and brands do just fine in that regard: the brand pay the club to represent the brand, and in turn the brand hope to recoup the investment (and some) through increased exposure and subsequent sales.\n\nThis is the reason that Nike and Adidas pay their respective partnered teams so much. It’s a constant battle between the two juggernauts to get the top tier sides in their swooshes and stripes.\n\nBut perhaps it’s time to start look tangentially; how do clubs begin to unlock new markets and audiences? Could influencers in other arenas be part of the answer?\n\nRecently, Australian A-League side The Central Coast Mariners offered Usain Bolt a contract, albeit for “much, much less” than what the Olympic great’s camp requested. A deal was never done, but what a story it would have made had it been.\n\nIt’s not rare for obscure leagues like the A-League to attempt to attract imminently expiring footballers with riches to help boost their profile; Beckham and Gerrard to LA Galaxy in the MLS, Xavi to Al-Sadd in the QNB Stars League, Iniesta to Vissel Kobe in the J-League. The list goes on and on.\n\nBut this tactic has begun to hum of desperation, both on the side of the player for selling out to a financially rewarding swan-song and the club for squeezing the remaining dregs of juice from aging, fading stars.\n\nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald, Bolt’s camp had asked for a deal around $3 million, but the Mariners’ offer was only in the vicinity of $150,000. It understandably costs a pretty penny to employ the world’s fastest man, but he could have justifiably been worth every cent with the increased revenue potential he would have unlocked in terms of sponsorship and a boost in fanbase.\n\nTypically, sports sponsorship deals are calculated on the on-field success of a side, but what would happen if we flipped that thinking on its head? Sure, awards and accolades undoubtedly boost a clubs profile and finances, but so could rostering a handful of influencers. They could, in fact, provide the injection needed to revitalize a clubs fanbase and instigate interest from brands intrigued by the innovative approach.\n\nInfluencers can unlock a whole new market and engage a potentially untapped audience for clubs. When you sign an influencer, you effectively sign their fan base too.\n\nGoing back to the benefits of influencer marketing listed above, up to 60% of consumers make their purchases due to recommendations on social networks. Usain Bolt has 9.5m followers on Instagram alone. If 60% of those became Central Coast Mariners fans, it would increase their global exposure by integrating an international audience 5.7m strong that had perhaps never previously considered to support a side on the Eastern coast of Australia.\n\nUnique opportunities for those brave enough to innovate\n\nNobody really grows up wanting to be a freestyle footballer. Those you find on LinkedIn heralding that headline have often fallen in to that career as a result of failing to become a professional footballer. When one door closes, another can open just down the corridor: freestyling presents an interesting lateral move to something still somewhat oriented around their passion.\n\nEven the mega-famous F2 Freestylers Billy Wingrove and Jeremy Lynch have been described as “teenage rejects”, having been cast aside by the academies of professional football clubs as adolescents before finding success as influencers and freestyle footballers. That said, a Bleacher Report article that came out late last year revealed that the skillful duo rake in $716,15 PER MONTH from the 12m subscribers on their Youtube channel. That’s more than Liverpool FC make from the 4.7m on theirs.\n\nAs a teenager, Lynch played in Arsenal’s Academy, but was later released by the club. Lynch claims to have been told, “on the ball, technically, you are the best at the whole club; off the ball, you are the worst.” He’s certainly on the ball with his finances now.\n\nWingrove had a trial for Tottenham Hotspur aged 11, but was told he was too small and therefore not physically strong enough to make it at professional level. He began performing freestyle football to earn money, but continued to pursue a footballing career, playing at youth level for Enfield Town and then semi-professionally for Ware from 2004 until 2009.\n\nWingrove was the first professional freestyle footballer to sign for a Premier League club, signing for Tottenham Hotspur—who had previously rejected him as a youngster—in 2003, for whom he would perform at half-time breaks and corporate events and occasionally fill in for first-team players in advertisements. It was the first real foray into influencer marketing for football, but there’s still so much more opportunity to explore.\n\nWould signing a singer breathe new life in to a clubs fan base? Would rostering an e-sports star result in a surge of traffic on a clubs webpage? Would bringing in a universally recognizable face from the world of film, fitness, or fashion lead to a spike in sales?"
