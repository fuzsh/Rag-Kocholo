        "text": "In this week's installment of The Vault, we have gathered director Jeremy Kasten (The Wizard of Gore, The Profane Exhibit) and actor/director Ted Raimi (Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, Morbid Minutes) to discuss Two Evil Eyes.\n\n1990's Two Evil Eyes marks the first collaboration between George Romero and Dario Argento since 1978's Dawn of the Dead. Two Evil Eyes is actually an anthology movie that never quite came together, and instead features two hour-long films based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. Romero wrote and directed \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,\" which stars Adrienne Barbeau, and Argento wrote and directed \"The Black Cat\" with Harvey Keitel.\n\nPrevious Vault commentaries:\n\n- Zombie with video commentary by Brian Collins & Sean Keller\n\n- Deep Red with video commentary by Greg McDougall & Josh Thompson\n\n- Dead & Buried with video commentary by Dave Parker & Rebekah McKendry\n\n- The Crazies with...\n\nAnthology film The Profane Exhibit has been in the works for some time now, but things are moving along with casting news for the wrap-around along with more detailed descriptions of the various segments and quotes from a few directors.

They will be featured in the cast of \"22 Rue des Martyrs,\" written by Ray Garton, which serves as the film's wrap-around segment.\n\nDavid Bond and Manda Manuel are the architects of what is likely the most daring independent horror film project to date, both in concept and scope.

Today, we present our interview with director Jeremy Kasten, the man responsible for the wraparound segments embedded in this anthology horror film.\n\nInside, you'll find our chat with Kasten, who previously helmed All Souls Day, The Thirst and The Wizard of Gore remake.

The Theatre Bizarre 2. W2 Media will co-finance the sequel, and distribute both films. Original producers Severin Films and Metaluna Productions will return for the sequel. We've got more details after the jump. The original The Theatre Bizarre was inspired by France's Grand Guinol theatre, popular at the turn of the century for its portrayal of sex and gore. A woman sneaks into a long-abandoned theatre and discovers a bizarre scene before her, one that leads into the six separate short films.

Not to be too cruel, but it’s hardly worth covering extensively as it was just a stupidly long, plodding, crudely assembled, shoddy mess. But I’ll give a very quick summary of my feelings on each short so as to allow the numerous directors their own dues.\n\nRichard Stanley (director of Hardware) offered up the first segment based on an old French myth about the Mother of Toads. There’s a lot of contrived boring dialogue, some nudity, some sticky goo, a ridiculously hilarious witch / toad thing, and plenty of pointless exposition. It results in one of the worst short films I’ve seen in a...\n\nDread Central is closely following updates on the upcoming anthology film The Profane Exhibit. Last week we announced three of the ten directors involved in the project. This week some new info has dropped on Manna, the Michael Todd Schneider directed segment of The Profane Exhibit.\n\nManna was written by Scott Swan, who wrote for both the \"Masters of Horror\" and \"Fear Itself\" television series. (Incidentally, the episode of \"Fear Itself\" Swan wrote was entitled \"Skin and Bones\" starring Doug Jones. This was easily some of the best horror I've ever seen on television. Just how do you get NBC to air a program featuring cannibalism?) As a director Swan headed Big Junior and Maskhead.\n\nAlso working on the project are editor Jeremy Kasten (director of The Wizard of Gore remake and The Theater Bizarre's wraparound) and clothing designer Louis Fleischauer (one of the top fetish clothing designers in the...\n\n“My favorite films growing up were the works of John Carpenter,” Peter A. Dowling, writer and director of the feature flick Stag Night, told Dread as we discussed his film, which premieres this coming Monday, October 11th, at 9:30pm, as selected by Rachel Belofsky’s Screamfest L.A.!\n\n“Halloween is one of my all time favorites,” continued Dowling of his love for Carpenter’s body of work, “and Assault on Precinct 13 is a great exercise in sustained suspense in a single location, as was The Thing. Actually, until writing Stag Night (review here) and Flightplan, which takes place entirely on a plane, I hadn’t realized how much I must have learned from Carpenter. Being a first-time director I knew there was an unwritten - or maybe written by you guys,” he laughed, “formula for a low-budget horror film, and that is something horrible happens to a small...\n\nFollowing up on our story here reporting that Kip Pardue (The Wizard of Gore), Brian Hallisay (Eastwick, Bones) and Sarah Habel (Party Down, The Butterfly Effect 3) have joined the cast of Hostel 3, we now have four new names to add to the list. Check 'em out below. According to The Wrap, John Hensley (Nip/Tuck), comedic actor Skyler Stone, Chris Coy (True Blood) and German actor Thomas Kretschmann have also joined the cast of Hostel 3. The story concerns a Vegas bachelor party that turns grisly when the groom (Hallisay) learns that his longtime best friend (Pardue) has targeted him for ritual murder.\n\nLooks like production on Hostel 3 is moving along and to prove it we have the first bit of casting news today. According to Variety, Kip Pardue (The Wizard of Gore) has landed the lead role in Hostel 3. The story revolves around Pardue's character who 'attends his best friend's bachelor party with an insidious agenda that plays into the human hunt'. Hostel 3 will be directed by Scott Spiegel (Intruder, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money) and produced by Eli Roth, Chris Briggs and Mike Fleiss. Bloody Disgusting adds that Brian Hallisay (Eastwick, Bones) and Sarah Habel (Party Down, The Butterfly Effect 3) will also star.\n\nYou just can’t keep a good serial killer down, especially when he only exists in our imaginations. Freddy Krueger returns once again this Friday, April 30, but this time without Robert Englund. Jackie Earle Haley slips into the scar makeup and knife-fingered glove this time around, hoping to give new life to an old favorite. Haley has already proven himself is short time to be one of this generation’s great character actors, with a knack for the dark and creepy side of the craft. In light of the new Nightmare On Elm Street film, We Are Movie Geeks has compiled our Top Ten List of the Best Creepy Character Actors.\n\nHonorable Mention: Rondo Hatton\n\nOf all the actors on this list, none has had a more tragic personal story as Rondo Hatton. As a young man Hatton was diagnosed with a rare pituitary disorder known as acromegalia (the studios...\n\nAre you bored of the same old TV shows? Tired of the mainstream?

Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe…until a Dark Knight arises. We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot…so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts.\n\nMusic, when viewed from a historical perspective, can be likened to an old building. For some of us, it’s a gallery where we can view our favorite artists time and again showcased in brilliant light. For others, such as myself, it’s like going back to a childhood home. Everything is just the way you remembered it, everything is comfortable, and it‘s warm in the illumination of nostalgia. However music affects your life, it marks you for the remainder of your time on this planet. The things you hear echoing off these walls can enhance your best times and alleviate the worst moments you go through. Through it all, these chambers are the place you come to time and again. The different bands and trends that pass by are much like layers of paint on the walls, and the artists that come into the limelight and create revolutionary...\n\nTitle: The Wizard of Gore (2007) Starring Kip Pardue, Crispin Glover, Bijou Phillips, Jeffrey Combs, Brad Dourif and The Suicide Girls Produced by Open Sky Entertainment and Sick-o-Scope Written by Zach Chassler Directed by Jeremy Kasten Scores: Technical:85 , Story:80 , Acting:80 , Overall Score: 82 I saw the trailer for this movie the day it came to DVD and was so insanely excited I went out and rented it that day. As far as I’m concerned, you can’t get any better than Crispin Glover (Willard, Back to the Future), Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the Child’s Play series) gracing the screen in the same flick. These three are not only horror movie legends, but they’re cult film legends, which [...]...\n\nAs the theatrical market for high-impact horror has dried up—supplanted by bloodless, generic PG-13 offerings like Prom Night—the Weinstein Company's Dimension Extreme label has become an efficient pipeline for titles ranging from barely released art horror like Teeth and Diary Of The Dead to straight-to-dvd trash and treasures, including the queasily effective French thriller Inside. The latest batch of Dimension releases feature some conspicuously big names behind them, which raises the question of why they bypassed theaters in the first place. Maybe the capable Jaws knock-off Rogue never made it to American screens because of Primeval, a dismal, not-screened-for-critics flop that probably put the kibosh on 25-foot-killer-crocodile movies. Greg Mclean's follow-up to the unvarnished, viscerally effective torture-porn entry Wolf Creek stays in the Australian outback, but emphasizes beauty over backwater grime. In fact, Rogue would make the tourist board happy, were it not for the tourist-chomping croc that.\n\nDimension Extreme released the DVD details and artwork for their upcoming August 19th, 2008 release of “The Wizard of Gore” by director Jeremy Kasten and starring Kip Pardue, Bijou Phillips, Crispin Glover (The I Scream Man) and Brad Dourif (Deadwood). Synopsis: Magic, madness and mayhem join in this diabolical remake of the 1970 horror cult classic. Crispin Glover (Willard) stars as a master illusionist whose female audience participants (The Suicide Girls) are hideously murdered onstage, only to miraculously reappear untouched. But when a smart reporter (Kip Pardue, Remember the Titans) finds they’re later turning up dead with the same wounds as those inflicted during the performance, his investigation leads to unimaginable terror.
