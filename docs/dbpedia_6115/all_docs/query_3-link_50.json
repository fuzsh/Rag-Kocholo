Moore will executive produce and might have a role in the remake.\n\n\"I think there is a certain sincerity in the original that is kind of undeniable,\" said Bill Fishman, who bought the remake rights and will direct the film. \"(Moore's) a cult figure and a luminary ... He's an original.\n\n\"(We are) giving enough respect to the original and building on it,\" added Fishman, whose credits included \"Car 54, Where are You?\" and \"Tapeheads.\" \"We are going to use some of the original one liners. (Moore's) eminently quotable.\"\n\nFishman's Fallout Entertainment banner is in the initial stages of casting and has had discussions with several stars of comedy and hip-hop, including Snoop Dogg.\n\nFishman hopes to begin production in the fall. The film is set in Los Angeles, but he said there are discussions about shooting in New Orleans.\n\nReuters/Hollywood Reporter\n\nPost by Brain Of F'n J on\n\nOkay, it's been said Hollywood is bereft of ideas.\n\nBut are they that lacking in even good REMAKE ideas? Has EVERY OTHER MOVIE OF QUALITY been made that they have to resort to Dolomite? Should I expect a remake of I Spit On Your Grave soon?\n\nJed Shaffer\n\n~Remembers The Wizard Of Gore is being remade, finds the nearest dark corner, curls up in a ball and cries.\n\nPost by Baixo Astral on\n\nOnly if he's played by The Human Tornado in a fatsuit... c'mon, the second one was subtitled 'The Human Tornado'.\n\nAlso, odd fact... I did an essay comparing the mise en scene in Dolemite and Citizen Kane in Film Theory at University - it was called 'Nothing up the Sleeve', and stated that the very inferiority of the Rudy Ray Moore movie in all departments to Kane's masterpiece in a way made it an infinitely more honest movie, as Moore and D'Urville Martin couldn't create any kind of artifice.\n\nPost by Brick Killed a Guy on\n\nI could have sworn I heard about a remake being done while I was in college...starring LL Cool J as Dolemite with Rudy Ray playing his mentor.\n\nGlad they didn't do it that way. Snoop Dogg >>>> LL Cool J.\n\nCasting Suggestion: Lil Jon as Creeper (aka: Hamburger Pimp)\n\nPost by Captain Spaulding on\n\nuncivilized82 said:\n\nI could have sworn I heard about a remake being done while I was in college...starring LL Cool J as Dolemite with Rudy Ray playing his mentor.\n\nGlad they didn't do it that way.

I was hoping that they wouldn't do this but the idea of Lil Jon as creeper almost changes my mind.\n\nPost by Brick Killed a Guy on\n\nultimochocula said:\n\nThis won't make a single dime at the box office. The reason Dolemite was so good in the first place was because it was done on a shoestring budget.\n\nI'll go watch it anyway, but they better stick to the movie's roots...\n\n.....\n\nIf I don't see a boom mic somewhere in the movie, I'm asking for a refund.\n\nPost by Milkman Norm on\n\nbrainofj said:\n\nOkay, it's been said Hollywood is bereft of ideas.\n\nBut are they that lacking in even good REMAKE ideas?
