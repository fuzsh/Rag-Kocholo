        "text": "Talk about perfectly timed. Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid is, as the name brazenly suggests, set during the hot summer months. Published by Spike Chunsoft, you play as the son of a circus ringmaster and spend your days exploring the town where the circus currently resides, talking to townsfolk, fishing, bug catching, and watching the circus’ fireworks at night. If you enjoyed Shin-chan on Switch and are eager to play the recently confirmed sequel, this should make the wait more tolerable.\n\nOne new release oddly timed is Grey Dawn – a first-person horror adventure set during a Victorian Christmas, with a storyline based around a Priest accused of murdering alter boys. While quite linear, the ability to change seasons – making lakes freeze and so forth – adds much to the experience. We awarded the Xbox version 7/10 earlier this year.\n\nAlso flying under the radar somewhat is Omochapon. It’s a quirky 3D puzzle platformer in which you control capsule toys – including a car, tank, and a pink rabbit on a spring – while exploring a Japanese mall. Ryo Hazuki would approve.\n\nAs for the bigger releases of the week, there are three sequels on the agenda, each with similar levels of anticipation. Brutal pixel art hack ‘n slash platformer Volgarr the Viking II has been a long time coming – the original launched in 2013. The Metacritic score is, currently, identical to that of the original – a reasonable 76%. SteamWorld Heist II has been forever coming too, with the 3DS original dating back to 2014. This side-scrolling tactical adventure takes to the seas, throwing naval battles into the mix. Despite a couple of lukewarm reviews, the Metacritic sits at a respectable 86%.\n\nOpen-world RPG Cat Quest III takes to the seas too and is likewise going down well with critics, reportedly improving on the two titles before it. Review scores are mostly 7s and 8s, resulting in a 79% Metacritic.\n\nBandai Namco is also back with That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicle – a combat focused adventure based on the animated series, also featuring town planning and RPG style quests. Reviews are yet to go live, but from screenshots alone, it appears a step above the tie-ins of yore. Not to be outdone with lengthy titles, The Villainess Is Adored by the Prince of the Neighbor Kingdom is also out, based on a novel that’s popular with girls.\n\nFor retro diehards, there are two curios to investigate. Yokai Club is the second instalment in the new line of Jaleco re-releases, featuring a rewind tool, a translated ending screen, an item guide, and a speed running clock. The EGGCONSOLE release of the ‘80s RPG ARGUICE NO TSUBASA is obscurer still, including a 100 page (approx) novel required to decipher dungeon murals.\n\nOther releases for this week include the Chinese dating sim Love is All Around – which sold over 2.5m copies on PC – monochromatic platformer Cattie, first-person graphic adventure Delirium, and something called Billy Bumbum: A Cheeky Puzzler. Big ‘my first GamerTag’ energy, there.\n\nNew Switch eShop releases\n\nCat Quest III – £17.99\n\nGet whiskered away on a hearty catventure in Cat Quest III, the third installment in the award-winning Cat Quest series!\n\nPlay as a swashbuckling purrivateer in this 2.5D open-world action RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world – the Purribean – an archipelago swarming with Pi-rats searching for the Northern Star – a long-lost mythical treasure.
