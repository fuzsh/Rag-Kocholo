        "text": "Friday night we watched The Wizard of Gore. It is a remake of the 1970 film directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis. I have included the film trailer for your review. Read below to see what the Dungeon thought of this film.\n\nThe action revolves around maniacal magician Montag. Each Night he hosts a show where he gleefully slaughters a woman in the audience in a horribly graphic and nasty way. He then closes the act with the girls returning to the stage unharmed. Enter the newspaper journalist and his girlfriend who stumble upon the show one summers eve. The journalist is mystified and attends again the next night. When he learns that one of the girls from the show has turned up dead he is impelled to attend once more. He quickly becomes obsessed, attending shows nightly. With each viewing his sanity disintegrates. This character suffers from a series of bizarre and sometimes incomprehensible hallucinations throughout the film. It is often difficult to tell where reality ends and hallucination begins. We learn why he is having the episodes and how Montag is able to “will” the girls on to the stage. But in the end you are left with more questions then answers. Kip Purdue plays our journalist Edmond Bigalow. He looks like the captain of the football team. He has this private dick from the 1920’s thing going on that just got under my skin. I thought he was a bad choice for the role. Bijou Phillips was pretty unforgettable as the girlfriend. And is the only women to get on stage and not get naked. I did enjoy Brad Dourif as the pimp drug dealer guy though. The saving grace was definitely the Montag shows. Crispin Glover is delightful as the misanthrope maniac. There is some decent production value and some great gore. There is one death involving a broom and a towel that left me feeling completely disgusted and suitably impressed. There is not nearly enough Montag in the film to save it. The film definitely has its moments but its needlessly confusing subplot bogs it down. They upped the ante on the gore and the nudity but they failed to capture the genuine creepiness of Lewis’ original. Overall I would say it is worth the price of a rental for the Montag shows alone.\n\nDungeon Rating 3/5\n\nDirected by: Jeremy Kasten\n\nStarring: Kip Pardue, Bijou Phillips, Crispin Glover, Jeffrey Combs, Brad Dourif, Joshua John Miller, Garz Chan, Tim Chiou, Evan Seinfeld, Amina Munster, Flux Suicide, Cricket Suicide and Nixon Suicide\n\nDavid Cronenberg is one of the Dungeon’s favorite Horror Film directors. This fellow Canadian was born in my hometown of Toronto Ontario and boasts a most impressive resume. Since 2000, he has been swaying from the genre into new territory which I think is very sad news indeed. Now that he is getting Oscar Nominations for his work I wonder if he will ever revisit horror. I really want to hate his non-horror entries but I just can’t. I cannot deny the brilliance of Spider, Naked Lunch or Eastern Promises. But because we are all about the horror we are only going to look at those titles. I would be the first to say that Hollywood star power does not a good horror film make. Cronenberg proves that wrong again and again. The memorable performances given in many of his films elevate them to a completely different level. It is the performance you remember, not the actions. A rare and beautiful thing. Who could forget Jeremy Irons disturbing performance as gynecologist twin brothers Beverly and Elliot Mantle in Dead Ringers? Or Christopher Walken’s wrought and sympathetic performance as Johnny Smith in the Dead Zone? Always edgy, and often weird we love that Cronenberg never backs down from graphic and grisly visuals even in his more commercial endeavors. In addition to directing he also wrote the screenplay to all of his horror entries and was the producer on Dead Ringers and Existenz. He had a cameo in his own films The Fly and Dead Ringers and had featured roles in Clive Barker’s Night Breed playing Dr Philip K. Decker and in Jason X as Dr. Wimmer. I have enjoyed every single Cronenberg horror film I have seen in varying degrees from like to love. I cannot say that about a single other horror film director. Below are the Dungeon reviews for each Cronenberg title. Come back to the dark side David!! We need you here!\n\neXistenZ (1999)\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh is a virtual reality game designer who gets trapped in her own game. What results is a mind-bending trip with surreal visuals and tight performances. A wonderfully weird and original film.\n\nStarring: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie and Sarah Polley\n\nDead Ringers\n\nJeremy Irons plays gynecologist twin brothers descending into madness with disturbing perfection. Unsettling images that will stay with you for days after. Gynecological tools that would give any woman nightmares. Absolutely brilliant and one of our all time favorites.\n\nStarring: Jeremy Irons, Geneviève Bujold, Heidi von Palleske, Barbara Gordon, Shirley Douglas and Stephen Lack\n\nThe Fly (1986)\n\nA remake of the 1958 classic with the camp cut out. The chemistry between Goldblum and Davis helps along the emotional tension. Watching the Brundle characters transformation is a visual, grotesquely grand treat. One of the best horror remakes out there.\n\nStarring: Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis, John Getz, Joy Boushel, Leslie Carlson and George Chuvalo\n\nThe Dead Zone (1983)\n\nChristopher Walken plays Johnny, a teacher who wakes up from a five-year coma with the ability to see the future of people he touches. His “gift” leaves him emotionally wrought and an unwilling hero. Inevitably he sees a future where he will have to make the ultimate sacrifice. Walken kicks ass as usual and Sheen’s politician is the perfect dastardly bastard.\n\nStarring: Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Colleen Dewhurst, Martin Sheen and Nicholas Campbell\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nJames Woods plays a seedy TV programmer who discovers pirated snuff that controls its viewer. Some of the most messed up scenes to appear on celluloid including one of our favorite scenes we lovingly refer to as “the human VCR”. A truly bizarre and surreal nugget.\n\nStarring: James Woods, Sonja Smits, Deborah Harry, Peter Dvorsky, Leslie Carlson, Jack Creley, and Lynne Gorman\n\nScanners (1981)\n\nA group of “scanners” with telepathic ability are able to will people to explode. When a renegade group of scanners with dreams of grandeur run amok the result is a grisly and gory mess. Great effects! A little more downtime than I like, but not without its entertainment value.\n\nStarring: Jennifer O’Neill, Stephen Lack, Patrick McGoohan, Lawrence Dane, Michael Ironside and Robert A. Silverman\n\nThe Brood (1979)\n\nSamantha Eggar is great as a woman getting very unconventional treatment in an institution. Unconventional doesn’t really begin to describe this freaky and truly bizarre little film. If you are offended by children in horror films this is not going to be your film. I really don’t want to say more and spoil the fun for those who haven’t seen it. Freaky little film that offers some real chills and thrills. This is one of my all time favorites.\n\nStarring: Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar, Art Hindle, Henry Beckman, Nuala Fitzgerald, Cindy Hinds, and Susan Hogan\n\nRabid (1977)\n\nMarilyn Chambers plays a woman who has undergone experimental surgery and develops a taste for blood. Everyone she infects becomes “rabid”. There is a city wide epidemic in no time flat. For starters, this film has the best promo poster ever! It is one of those films I seen at a young impressionable age so it holds a special place in my horror filled wretched heart. It is full of copious violence and a beauty little scene I like to call attack of the Vaginal armpit. This one is on my list of Top 100 best horror films of all time.\n\nStarring: Marilyn Chambers, Frank Moore, Joe Silver, Howard Ryshpan, Patricia Gage, Susan Roman, and Roger Periard\n\nShivers (1975)(aka They Came from Within)\n\nCronenberg’s first full-length horror feature. A scientist living in an upscale Montreal condominium has let loose a parasite that transforms its victims into sex obsessed, violent, zombie-esque predators. By the time most of the buildings inhabitants figure out there is something wrong it is too late. The film has a claustrophobic feeling about it and has lots of nasty deaths. A very nice first outing.\n\nStarring: Paul Hampton, Joe Silver, Lynn Lowry, Allan Kolman, Susan Petrie, Barbara Steele, Ronald Mlodzik and Barry Baldaro\n\nFriday, February the 13th will see the release of the remake of the 1980 film FRIDAY THE 13th. We have already seen the release of a remade MY BLOODY VALENTINE this year. Where Valentine at least had a gimmick with the 3-D thing we wonder what Friday could possibly have to offer us. I have read a couple reviews of the upcoming FRIDAY THE 13th and they are trying to sell it as a fresh new story. I believe they used the word “reboot”. Why call it FRIDAY THE 13th then? They can try to sell it to me anyway they want, I’m not biting. I am just so tired of getting burned. Unlike the sequel, where we are watching an incarnation of an already iconic figure,with the remake, we are looking at a recreation of that iconic figure. Why fix something that ain’t broken? I assume, the idea behind remaking a film is to have a whole new generation love it as much as the previous one had. I don’t think it is possible to please me with a rehashed version of a film I adore. It’s so much more than just content when it comes to my favorites. The films I seen as a child/teen left an indelible impression on me. When I was a kid we would often lie to our parents about what movie we were seeing and sneak into a film we really wanted to see. On one such occasion we seen a matinee showing of THE CHANGELING. This film scared the crap out of us! That wet rubber ball bouncing down the stairs sent chills down my spine! When we got out of the film it was starting to get dark. That was the scariest, longest walk home ever! That was the beginning of my love affair with the horror film. I made it my goal to see as many as possible. Eventually my parents gave up on the idea of trying to prevent me from seeing horror films and once video rental outlets became common place I seen a lot more at home. The first time I seen Friday the 13th was on video at a friends house. As much as The Changeling scared me it did nothing to prepare me for the mental and emotional smack down I was about to receive. There was sex and nudity and people were dying in the most hideous and brutal ways! What the hell did I just see?! It left me feeling frightened, shocked and happily satisfied. How can you remake that? In my opinion, there are very few remakes that work. There of course are exceptions to that rule. John Carpenter’s THE THING and David Cronenberg’s The Fly are two examples of films that have remakes I enjoyed more than the original. I am mindful to the fact that these remakes came out when I was young and were new to me. Those who grew up with the originals probably do not share my point of view. So I suppose based on that, maybe there is room for remakes. Maybe If there is a fresh and original twist like the aforementioned then maybe it can work. And maybe if enough time passes. Maybe. It isn’t just North American films getting the makeover treatment. There have been a rash of Asian remakes. The freaking mess that North American film makers have made of great Asian horror films is shameful. The truth is, I think most remakes are awful. Not just because they are reinventing the wheel but because they do a half ass job of it. Instead of remaking a film from days gone by for new generations to adopt,why not create something new that truly represents them? A lot of the films that are being remade worked because there was nothing like them when they came out. They were new and fresh and completely original. I have a list of 28 horror films available for rental that I want to see. I think I will be getting me some of that action instead of spending my cash to see a remake at the theatre. We’ll wait for the rental, if we bother at all."
