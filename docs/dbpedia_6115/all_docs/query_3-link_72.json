        "text": "In the small Colorado mountain town of Leadville, a mysterious and highly contagious virus has infected most of the townspeople, prompting the government to order the military – lead by Captain Rhodes (Ving Rhames) – to step in and set up a quarantine zone. As the local hospital gets overwhelmed with patients coughing up blood, the situation soon gets out of hand when everyone starts to turn into zombies. Corporal Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari), Pvt. Salazar (Nick Cannon), and a few others are all that remain and they must all band together in order to escape the town before they, too, become food for the dead.\n\nGeorge A. Romero's Day of the Dead is arguably his best work and one of the best zombie films ever made. Its dark, gritty and graphic nature propelled it to cult classic status in no time at all and featured what is still some of the most amazing gore effects ever put on screen, which came courtesy of effects wizard Tom Savini and his crew. Now here we are, 23 years later, with a remake that has abandoned all of this and in its place put fourth an effort resulting in lackluster storytelling, ridiculous acting and some of the most obscure, ineffective zombie-like monsters to hit the movies in some time.\n\nFirst of all, why in the hell is this thing called Day of the Dead? Last time we checked, \"day\" implied a lot of sunlight. The majority of this movie takes place at night, with only the first fifteen minutes or so spent in the light. It's only during the final moments of the horrible ending that we are shown the sun once again. It doesn't make a lick of sense. Actually, this film isn't even a true remake. Only snippets of Romero's original are used here, mainly the names – Sarah, Rhodes, Salazar, Bub (we'll get to that one in a second), Dr. Logan and so on. This is a remake in name only.\n\nDirector Steve Miner (Halloween: H20, My Father the Hero) focused much more of his time making this a violent zombie actioner instead of a dramatic horror piece that would have done justice to Romero and his film. It's not even a direct sequel to Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake, which I personally believe would have been a lot more enjoyable had it not been called Dawn of the Dead.\n\nThe first tell tale sign that this flick was going to be a disaster came before a single roll of film was ever shot. Casting Mena Suvari as the lead was not what you would call a wise decision. She has to be the most out of place of all the actors in the film. Not only is she completely miscast, but also unable to handle the responsibilities – let alone a gun – that come with being in an action film. Watching her give orders is like watching your little baby sister try to boss you around. In looking at the rest of the cast, Nick Cannon plays the stereotypical jackass, dishing out one-liners like they are going out of style and playing the race card every now and then. It's when he grabs a machete and holds it up high, quoting He-Man, that the movie reaches the point of absolute trash. As for Ving Rhames, his role is small and his screen time is short. This makes him the smart one of the bunch.\n\nThe biggest problem of all, though, has to be the way they treated the Bub character. For those of us who really love Romero's Day, we all remember Bub, the ex-solider turned mad scientist's pet. He's probably the most famous and well-liked zombie in history. This time, though, he is known as \"Bud\" and is a bumbling, stumbling army private who is gaga over Suvari's character. He does, however, turn into a \"zombie\" about halfway through, after which it is explained why he is the only one of the \"walking dead\" that doesn't feast on human flesh. Are you ready for this? He is a vegetarian. A vegetarian? What?! Good job on that one, Jeffrey Reddick (who wrote this remake and Final Destination).\n\nIn focusing on the \"zombies\", themselves, it's rather hard to find anything positive to state about them. As in the previous Romero remake (Dawn), these \"zombies\" run full speed ahead in an attempt to tackle down and gnaw upon their victims. There is nothing wrong with that. Here, however, we have \"zombies\" that are practically super powered. They can leap from second story windows, landing on their feet like cats, and can even climb walls and crawl on ceilings like some kind of coked up tarantula. The term \"zombie\" is also one that doesn't seem to appropriately fit the creatures here since they aren't really undead. The victims come down with cold-like symptoms, freeze up for a moment or two, and then come out of it with mutated skin and a hunger for human flesh. We are shown this via a stupefying CGI look inside the body of one of the infected townspeople. Does it work? Hell no!\n\nSo is there anything at all that viewers can hope to enjoy if they so choose to watch this flick? Of course there is. The whole thing will take about 87 minutes of your life away. Better that than two hours, wouldn't you say?\n\nScore: 0 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nLacking a polished quality, the anamorphic widescreen presentation (1.85:1) is nothing special to witness; it's pretty standard. Black levels appear as they should, grain pops in every once and a while, and colors are fairly crisp and clean. There is quite a bit of contrast manipulation at play, however, and, as a result, various sequences tend to have their lighting exaggerated. It doesn't always work and does reach borderline excess, but it's just enough to keep things moving along and looking stylish.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nThis film has a quite a large number of action sequences and both the Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS tracks are more than capable of handling every last one of them. This is also one of the few times where there isn't a decipherable difference between the Dolby Digital and DTS mixes. Regardless, both allow the action to easily flow from one speaker and into another. The same holds true for every agonizing scream of a helpless victim and those odd sounding Velociraptor-like \"zombie\" belches. The only time things seem to be a bit on the underwhelming side is when the characters are merely participating in simple conversation. Here you will find the experience to be a bit more passive.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\nAh, the packaging. It's the only part of this DVD that is actually worth checking out. A standard plastic snap case is housed inside a very nifty holographic slipcover. It's pretty sweet and one of the best DVD covers out there. Having said that, the cover, itself, has absolutely nothing at all to do with the film. Unfortunately, these zombies do not spew out toxic sludge. That might've actually been something worth looking into when the writer thought about taking a crack at this project. Perhaps it is something of a premonition, giving us an example of what will happen once we finish watching the movie. Oh, well. Let's take a look at what you will find on this single disc:\n\nCast and Crew Commentary with Director Steve Miner, Writer Jeffrey Reddick, Editor Nate Easterling and Cast Members Michael Welch, Stark Sands and Christa Campbell\n\n\"On the Set\" Featurette\n\nInterviews\n\nAlternate Ending\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nInternational, Unrated and Theatrical Trailers\n\nThe packed commentary track is definitely one that you are going to want to avoid. With this being the first time most of the participants have ever done a commentary, the group does not have much to say and thus little worthwhile information is provided. You do get to hear some ridiculous logic as to why the writer switched \"Bub\" to \"Bud\". It's pretty funny stuff. \"On the Set\" is a fairly standard look at some of the action scenes and how they were set-up and executed. It will hold your attention for all of five seconds.\n\nThe Interviews are also pretty basic and are split up into sections; giving you the chance to pick and choose which interview you would like to watch. Your options are: Director Steve Miner, Special Makeup Designer Dean Jones & Actors Mena Suvari, Nick Cannon, AnnaLynne McCord, Michael Welch and Stark Sands. It's hard to pick just one isn't it? Well, for those of you who have difficulty deciding, you can always click on \"Play All\" and your worries will vanish. Meanwhile, the Alternate Ending delivers the conclusion that we all hoped would not make it into the final film. Here's a hint: A certain annoying character survives. It's definitely not as happy an ending as the one in the movie. The Trailers and Photo Gallery are all that remain to waste even more of your time.\n\nScore: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBoo! Hiss! Grr! Take it away. Please, just take it away."
