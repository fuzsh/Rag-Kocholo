When an underground journalist begins to investigate the strange deaths, the truth proves to be far more bizarre and disturbing than anything he or his readers might have imagined.",

        "text": "Has serious “plays in the background of your drug dealers place” vibes. Don’t know what that particularly means, but that’s the best way I can describe it.\n\nSo some sweaty loser trust-find kid who lives 24/7 as a noir 1940’s reporter watches a “Grand Guignol” show, discovers the girl that was mutilated at the show has turned up dead, then decides to get to the bottom of it.\n\nWhich he does... maybe. This movie thinks constant misdirections and unexplainable occurrences makes for an intelligent story. Which it does not. It felt like trying to make since of Basic (2003). And just like that film, it goes down better if you just run with it.\n\nThe movie doesn’t lack its titular…\n\nNot as good as the original. I respect that it changes the story up entirely but it's just not great, idk. Some interesting ideas here but I don't find it too compelling personally.\n\nThe production value was also a lot lower than I was expecting. Like God damn, some people can make low budget work but this is not it. Cool that they got Brad Dourif but they didn't really have anything for him to do. His character could've been cut from the story entirely and it wouldn't even matter.\n\nI also have mixed feelings about the way they did Montag in this one. It's a solid idea and a solid performance but it just didn't really work for me.…\n\nThis is so not-good but I'm sorry, I kind of love it. Some douchebag kid who lives a 24/7 LARP lifestyle as a 1930s newspaper editor discovers a new fixture on the L.A. scene: the gory stage show of a codpieced magician. But what is real, and what is illusion? And how does the kid's hot girlfriend play into this???\n\nWhen the filmmakers asked themselves \"How can we entrench this as firmly in mid-2000s alternative culture as possible?\", they came up with the idea of casting Suicide Girls. I approve. The special effects are pretty good, which goes to show how far you can go on a limited budget nowadays. The director described the film as a \"love letter to…\n\nI did it! My goal for this last year was to watch at least one movie every day. I have never done that before but always thought about it while running my blog. I managed to do that this year for the first and probably last time. I struggled through it at times. There were nights when I didn't feel like watching a movie and forced myself to do so, resulting in a little bit of lost sleep as a result since I got going on the movie late. I didn't review every film but only skipped that on 13 of my over 500 movies from this year. I don't plan on doing this again, as I have other things…\n\nFeels very \"off\" in a kind of magnetic way, cheap and weird remake branching off into a noir style (that's what it's called where a guy wears a hat and narrates I'm like 90% sure) That feels like Naked Lunch for goth kids but less cool and without all the Mugwump jism.\n\nGrispy Gloves is WORKIN IT as a reimagined Montag, like a crazed cross between a flamboyant Vegas performer and a fire and brimstone televangelist. We are having a (mostly) good time here, cheezin it up and soakin it down with blood.\n\nRemember when Suicide Girl was a thing? Is that still a thing?\n\nLots nekkidness, and everyone is real rude to women in this. Like sure okay, throwing…"
