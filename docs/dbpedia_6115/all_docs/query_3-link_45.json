        "text": "Masters of Schlock\n\nThe sci-fi and horror movies of the 1950s sparked a trend that continues even today of downright silly titles, ranging from 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' to 'The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!?' to 'Big Ass Spider!' (Yes, there also is a love affair with unnecessary punctuation.) Here, THR breaks down 50 of the best (and funniest) titles of all time. (Pictured from left: The Hideous Sun Demon, Attack of the 50ft Woman and Monster on the Campus.)\n\nSuperman and the Mole Men (1951)\n\nThe Man of Steel (George Reeves) mediates a hostile conflict between a small town drilling for oil and the subterranean race of mole people that they have disturbed. Lex Luthor must have been taking a holiday.\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films — in Just Four Minutes (Video)\n\nThe Mesa of Lost Women (1953)\n\nA mad scientist (Jackie Coogan) in Mexico is hard at work at developing giant spiders with the intention of injecting women with their venom in order to create a species of genetically enhanced super spider-women.

The film was the first 3-D movie released by Universal.\n\nCat Women of the Moon (1953)\n\nA group of astronauts discover the last living members of an ancient civilization living in a cave on the moon who just so happen to be scantily clad young women who like to drink and dine. Unfortunately for the astronauts, the ladies also enjoy stealing spaceships.\n\nThe Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953)\n\nThe film was the first to feature a prehistoric monster awakened by atomic bomb testing that went on a destructive rampage in a major city (this time New York City) but it was certainly not the last.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Thrillers: 19 Movies That Will Terrify You\n\nMonster From the Ocean Floor (1954)\n\nWhile vacationing in Mexico, young American artist Julie (Anne Kimbell) encounters a giant one-eyed amoeba monster that rises from the sea. Naturally, the locals dismiss her claims, most likely under the assumption that she’s had one too many shots of Mezcal, so its up to Julie and a conveniently available marine biologist (Stuart Wade) to neutralize the threat.\n\nRead more Hollywood Stars' Favorite Surfing Locations Revealed\n\nThe Creature With the Atom Brain (1955)\n\nNazis? Check. Mad scientist? Check again. Mind control? Once more, yes. Zombies? You better believe it. Gangsters? Seriously? Yeah, throw them in there. As you can probably guess, a Nazi scientist uses radio-controlled zombies to return an exiled mobster to power. Obviously.\n\nThe Beast With a Million Eyes (1956)\n\nAfter a spacecraft crashes in the desert just outside of a desolate date farm, the alien visitor takes over the minds of local humans and animals to terrorize the community and steal delicious dates.\n\nRead more From 'Blade Runner' to 'Star Wars': Hollywood's Favorite Sci-Fi Films\n\nGodzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956)\n\nThe “Americanized” version of the Japanese monster’s first appearance featured an American journalist (Raymond Burr) investigating mysterious occurrences off the coast of Japan, new footage for North American audiences, and, of course, a 400-foot lizard who became famous for laying waste to Tokyo and its inhabitants.\n\nThe Cosmic Man Appears in Tokyo (1956)\n\nMuch like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, this film features friendly aliens that find themselves on Earth and befriend humanity. Unlike E.T., the aliens here are actually giant starfish monsters that, fearing their hideous forms will result in an hysteric panic, nominate a female member of their race to take the form of a popular female pop-star to warn us of an approaching meteor that will destroy all life on Earth if we don't stop it. Also, there are no Reese's Pieces.\n\nPlan 9 From Outer Space (1956)\n\nNo plan from outer space is quite as sinister, as diabolical, or as outright insidious as Plan 9. In order to stop humanity from creating a powerful sun-powered bomb, invading aliens resurrect the dead on Earth as zombies, and also vampires, to wreak havoc on our planet. Ed Wood’s B-movie classic was famously labeled “the worst movie in the history of cinema” by film critic Michael Medved.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Films: 7 Musicals to Get Your Toes Tapping\n\nAttack of the Crab Monsters (1956)\n\nA team of scientists travel to a remote island to study the effects of nuclear weapons.

But its not all fun times and groovy moon babes: There’s also a monster, and the astronauts are tasked with dispatching it.\n\nInvasion of the Saucermen (1957)\n\nOriginally released as a double feature with I Was a Teenage Werewolf, the film focuses on that awkward time in life when teen romance blossoms and young lovers head up to make-out point, only to accidentally run over a wandering alien and spark a planetary invasion. Oh, to be young again.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Thrillers: 19 Movies That Will Terrify You\n\nThe Viking Woman and the Sea Serpent (1957)\n\nExpectations are often hard to check. You enjoy sea serpents, of course, but generally you like to watch your mythical leviathans battle with, at the very least, two Viking women. Well fear not, for the film’s alternate title offers a much more apt description of the high sea adventures in The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent.\n\nRead more 'SNL' 40 Red Carpet: Past Stars, Current Cast Recall Favorite Moments, Working With \"Childhood Heroes\"\n\nTerror From the Year 5,000 (1958)\n\nA professor (Frederic Downs) builds a time machine that brings back a woman (Salome Jens) from the year 5200 A.D.

When Professor Donald Blake (Arthur Franz) accidentally comes into contact with the blood of a specimen of newly discovered prehistoric fish, he transforms into a monstrous Neanderthal with a passion for murdering coeds.\n\nThe Brain That Wouldn’t Die (1959)\n\nIs there anything more romantic than the story of a doctor (Jason Evers) who keeps the decapitated head of his girlfriend (Virginia Leith) alive while he searches for a replacement body? No. Not even The Notebook.\n\nThe Hideous Sun Demon (1959)\n\nWhat could easily have been marketed as a 74-minute Coppertone commercial, the film centers on a man who, after being exposed to radiation (seriously, stay away from radiation, already!), turns into a monstrous lizard creature whenever he is exposed to sunlight.\n\nTeenagers From Outer Space (1959)\n\nIn this story of literal star-crossed lovers, a young teenaged alien falls in love with a beautiful Earth girl prompting him to try and persuade his race against their plans to use Earth as a food source for giant space lobsters.\n\nThe 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959)\n\nLou Costello stars as an inventor whose girlfriend (Dorothy Provine) is transformed by radiation into a 30 foot tall giantess.

(1964)\n\nThe southern town of Pleasant Valley is anything but for six Yankee tourists trapped in a murderous centennial celebration aimed at revenge on the northerners for the Civil War.\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\n\nThe Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!?
