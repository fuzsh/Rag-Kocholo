        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nThe iconic 1939 musical The Wizard Of Oz is being reimagined for a 2022 audience: more details on the new film here. The Wizard Of Oz, festive favourite around the world and arguably one of the most iconic films of all time, is getting a remake, or a ‘reimagining’ as it’s being described. The original followed Judy Garland’s Dorothy Gale as she is magically transported from a dull, black and white Kansas to the glorious Technicolor of Oz. There, she teams up with The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Black-ish creator Kenya Barris is behind the new film, as Warner Brothers has hired him to write and direct. It’s not the only Wizard Of Oz project on the slate either, as the long mooted film adaptation of Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwarz’s smash hit musical Wicked is finally beginning production at Elstree Studios in November. Showing events from the perspective of the witches, the film will be split into two parts. Holzman and Schwarz have penned the screenplay, with the latter also writing a brand new song for one of the films. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo will play Glinda and Elphaba respectively.
