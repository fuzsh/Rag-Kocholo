        "text": "Since 2003 we've been graced by some of the most substantial movie releases ever: Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars Episode III.

No wait, he's a detective, damn, our dreams haven't come true... Either way, this movie, supposedly directed by the legendary Ridley Scott, may rattle some cages during 2007.\n\nBeowulf\n\nRelease Date: November 16, 2007\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson\n\nSynopsis: The Scandinavian warrior Beowulf must fight and defeat the monster Grendel who is terrorizing towns, and later, Grendel's mother, who begins killing out of revenge.\n\nThe Hype: Zemeckis will bring this epic tale from ancient history to life; it's been yearning for a film adaption for years.\n\nBlades of Glory\n\nRelease Date: March 30, 2007\n\nDirector: Josh Gordon / Will Speck\n\nStarring: Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Jenna Fischer\n\nSynopsis: In 2002, two rival Olympic ice skaters were stripped of their gold medals and permanently banned from men's single competition.

That alone may give this a chance at being the film that the first one wasn't.\n\nGhost Rider\n\nRelease Date: February 16, 2007\n\nDirector: Mark Steven Johnson\n\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight, Eva Mendes, Sam Elliott, Peter Fonda\n\nSynopsis: Based on the Marvel character, stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to become a hellblazing vigilante, to fight against power hungry Blackheart, the son of the devil himself.\n\nThe Hype: One of the great upcoming comic book adaptations in 2007 that will feature some incredible special effects and an amazing performance from Nic Cage. A film not to miss on its February release day!\n\nThe Giver\n\nRelease Date: 2007 (Unconfirmed)\n\nDirector: Vadim Perelman\n\nStarring: Jeff Bridges\n\nSynopsis: In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the \"real\" world.\n\nThe Hype: A film adaptation of one of the most beloved books, The Giver, looks to be an intriguing film, directed by the same guy from House of Sand and Fog.\n\nThe Golden Compass\n\nRelease Date: December 7, 2007\n\nDirector: Chris Weitz\n\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richards\n\nSynopsis: In a parallel universe, young Lyra Belacqua journeys to the far North to save her best friend and other kidnapped children from terrible experiments by a mysterious organization.\n\nThe Hype: Describe online as possibly the \"new\" Lord of the Rings, The Golden Compass is an adaptation from a trilogy of fantasy books.\n\nGrindhouse\n\nRelease Date: April 6, 2007\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino / Robert Rodriguez\n\nStarring: Kurt Russell, Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan\n\nSynopsis: Two 75 minute horror movies written by Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez put together as a two film features. Including fake movie trailers in between both movies.\n\nThe Hype: A QT/RR production with two 75 minute films packed into one full-on feature. The first, Planet Terror, a zombie film by Robert Rodriguez. The second, Death Proof, a slasher flick by Tarantino. Distributed in the grungy exploitation film style with dirty reels and fake trailers. Absolutely amazing!\n\nHalo\n\nRelease Date: Delayed Until Further Notice\n\nDirector: Neill Blomkamp\n\nStarring:\n\nSynopsis: After they crash-land on an artificial ring-world called \"Halo\", a marine captain, his surviving marines, and a genetically-and-surgically-enhanced supersoldier called \"Master Chief\" must find out what the Covenant, the genocidal alien race they are at war with, are looking for on the ring.\n\nThe Hype: In coordination (not really) with the likely release of highly anticipated game Halo 3 on Xbox 360 in 2007, the film is sparking the interests of everyone who's ever played the game - which is just about everyone. Rumors have been rampant about Denzel Washington voicing Master Chief and about Peter Jackson directing, but nothing yet is official. UPDATE: Peter Jackson is producing and Halo will feature a directorial debut from award-winning shorts director Neill Blomkamp. It has been moved to summer of 2008, but I'll leave it on here anyway (but don't get confused).\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nRelease Date: July 13, 2007\n\nDirector: David Yates\n\nStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Imelda Staunton, George Harris, Helena Bonham Carter\n\nSynopsis: With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.\n\nThe Hype: A new director this time around again, but that doesn't matter. This next installment in the Harry Potter series will, as always, bring out loads of fangirls (and maybe some fanboys) to cheer again as Harry fights off Voldemort. Another list topper for 2007 guaranteed.\n\nHot Fuzz\n\nRelease Date: April 13, 2007\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nStarring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman\n\nSynopsis: Jealous colleagues conspire to get a top London cop transferred to a small town and paired with a witless new partner. On the beat, the pair stumble upon a series of suspicious accidents and events.\n\nThe Hype: The director of Shaun of the Dead and the stars of Shaun of the Dead come together again for the next great British comedy.\n\nI Am Legend\n\nRelease Date: November 21, 2007\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nStarring: Will Smith\n\nSynopsis: The lone healthy survivor of a biological war faces off against a new breed of nocturnal mutants.\n\nThe Hype: Johnny Depp is rumored to play the head vampire in this upcoming vampire film from the director of Constantine.\n\nThe Kingdom\n\nRelease Date: April 20, 2007\n\nDirector: Peter Berg\n\nStarring: Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman\n\nSynopsis: A team of U.S. government agents are sent to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East.\n\nThe Hype: Friday Night Lights director Peter Berg is putting together what hopes to be a better Middle East based film starring a great selection of actors.\n\nKnocked Up\n\nRelease Date: June 1, 2007\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann\n\nSynopsis: A young guy finds out he impregnated his one night stand.\n\nThe Hype: After the incredible success of 40 Year Old Virgin, director Judd Apatow returns to make his next comedy that has a plot that looks to be just as hilarious as 40 Year Old Virgin.\n\nLive Free or Die Hard\n\nRelease Date: July 4, 2007\n\nDirector: Len Wiseman\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Maggie Q, Timothy Olyphant, Mary Elizabeth Winstead\n\nSynopsis: The heroic John McClane comes out of retirement to take down an Internet-based terrorist organization.\n\nThe Hype: Although the cheesy title might thwart some people, this really is the 4th Die Hard movie. Rumors have been flying around about casting, but there's no denying that another Die Hard is definitely going to blow up the theatres (again) in 2007.\n\nMonkey's Paw\n\nRelease Date: Moved to 2008\n\nDirector:\n\nStarring:\n\nSynopsis: A man comes home with an artifact that is rumored to grant any wish... at a price.\n\nThe Hype: Although being created as more of a children's horror film, no one can forget the story of the Monkey's Paw from their years in grammar school. We've all \"wished\" for a true film adaptation to be made, and here it is (and at what cost?!).\n\nNext\n\nRelease Date: September 28, 2007\n\nDirector: Lee Tamahori\n\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel\n\nSynopsis: A man who can see into his own future has to avoid capture by a government organization and win the love of a woman who will be the mother of his child.\n\nThe Hype: Another Philip K. Dick adaptation (also A Scanner Darkly) that looks to be an incredibly interesting film with Nicolas Cage as the star.\n\nOcean's 13\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2007\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nStarring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, Ellen Barkin\n\nSynopsis: The continuing criminal exploits of Danny Ocean and his crew of crooks.\n\nThe Hype: The entourage cast returns again in what may be the final film in the incredibly successful trilogy of robbery films directed by the legendary Steven Soderbergh. Although Ocean's 12 didn't fare overly well, this third installment may be the perfect fit after the great first film and mildly entertaining second film.\n\nPathfinder\n\nRelease Date: April 27, 2007\n\nDirector: Marcus Nispel\n\nStarring: Karl Urban, Moon Bloodgood, Russell Means, Clancy Brown\n\nSynopsis: A Viking boy is left behind after his clan battles a Native American tribe. Raised within the tribe, he ultimately becomes their savoir in a fight against the Norsemen.\n\nThe Hype: After reports from Comic-Con and behind-the-scenes videos, this early 2007 movie may be the start to a great year of upcoming action flicks.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End\n\nRelease Date: May 25, 2007\n\nDirector: Gore Verbinski\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy, Chow Yun-Fat\n\nSynopsis: Captain Barbossa, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann must sail off the edge of the map, navigate treachery and betrayal, and make their final alliances for one last decisive battle.\n\nThe Hype: Likely to be in the very top 3 films of 2007, this is the epic conclusion to the already fantastic adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow. The second film ended in a cliffhanger and left everyone yelling for more, and At World's End will most likely be just as enticing as everyone wants it to be.\n\nPriest\n\nRelease Date: Moved to 2008\n\nDirector: Andrew Douglas\n\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Steven Strait\n\nSynopsis: A priest disobeys church law to track down the vampires who kidnapped his niece.\n\nThe Hype: The synopsis itselfs intrigues an eyebrow-raising interest into just what exactly Gerard Butler will be doing as a priest. Originally based on a Japanese comic and directed by the man behind The Amityville Horror, it may find hope.\n\nRatatouille\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2007\n\nDirector: Brad Bird\n\nStarring: Patton Oswalt, Brian Dennehy, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Ian Holm\n\nSynopsis: The story is of a rat named Ratatouille who lives in a upmarket Parisian restaurant run by an eccentric chef.\n\nThe Hype: Pixar has struck back in full force in almost less than a year's time since Cars was released. This time the adventure involves a rat in Paris and will hopefully have the heart that Pixar films (of past) have always had that make them so great.\n\nReno 911! Miami\n\nRelease Date: February 23, 2007\n\nDirector: Ben Garant\n\nStarring: Thomas Lennon, Ben Garant, Kerri Kenney, Cedric Yarbrough, Carlos Alazraqui, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Niecy Nash, Mary Birdsong, Paul Rudd, Nick Swardson\n\nSynopsis: A rag-tag team of Reno cops are called in to save the day after a terrorist attack disrupts a national police convention in Miami Beach during spring break.\n\nThe Hype: The immensely successful and exceptionally funny Comedy Central TV series is making a debut on film in a movie version of the show, however stuck this time in Miami. Although a real trailer is yet unreleased, the trailer was shown at Comic-Con and parodies Miami Vice's trailer both in comedic presence and action.\n\nRush Hour 3\n\nRelease Date: August 10, 2007\n\nDirector: Brett Ratner\n\nStarring: Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Vinnie Jones, Yvan Attel, Roselyn Sanchez, Yao Ming, Roman Polanski\n\nSynopsis: While in Paris, Lee and Carter inadvertantly get mixed up with the Chinese Triad crew.\n\nThe Hype: Although not that many people are excited to see these films continue after Rush Hour 2, it doesn't mean that this third one won't be fully entertaining. I'd like to say that Brett Ratner has gained a little bit more respect after directing X-Men 3, but that depends on your own opinion.\n\nShrek 3\n\nRelease Date: May 18, 2007\n\nDirector: Raman Hui / Chris Miller\n\nStarring: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Justin Timberlake\n\nSynopsis: When Fiona's dad dies Shrek is supposed to take the crown but Shrek doesn't want the responsibility. So Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Puss look for a new King. And so far King Arthur is the best they have.\n\nThe Hype: Shrek 2 remains one of the biggest openings for an animated film ever, and has enough of a great following behind it from adults and kids alike to possibly take a top spot in 2007. Either way, the movie will be a must-see that will last for months in the theatre - the same way Shrek 2 was.\n\nThe Simpsons Movie\n\nRelease Date: July 27, 2007\n\nDirector: David Silverman\n\nStarring: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe Hype: After 18 seasons, they've finally decided to make a feature length movie and release it in theatres. The Simpsons Movie is guaranteed to sweep the box office no matter what the storyline, all because of Homer's brilliant 17 year history of making us laugh.\n\nSin City 2\n\nRelease Date: 2007 (Unconfirmed - Casting Issues)\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller\n\nStarring: Brittany Murphy, Mickey Rourke, Michael Clarke Duncan\n\nSynopsis: In the dark bowels of Sin City, Dwight plans to have his vengeance against the woman who betrayed him, Ava Lord, while Nancy plans her vengeance against the Roarks for Hartigan's death.\n\nThe Hype: The first Sin City was a smashing success for fans of brutal action and comic books, and they've been cheering for another one since it's release day. Their dreams have come true and the Sin City excellence from Frank Miller will continue on in a second action-packed installment.\n\nSlipstream\n\nRelease Date: 2007 (Unconfirmed)\n\nDirector: Anthony Hopkins\n\nStarring: Christian Slater, Gena Rowlands, Jeffrey Tambor, Michael Clarke Duncan, Camryn Manheim\n\nSynopsis: Aging screenwriter Felix Bonhoeffer has lived his life in two states of existence: in reality and hbis own interior world. While working on a murder mystery script, and unaware that his brain is on the verge of implosion, Felix is baffled when his characters start to appear in his life, and vice versa.\n\nThe Hype: A late addition (to this list) written and directed by Anthony Hopkins surrounding an intriguing story that is largely based upon Hopkins's own thoughts about God, life, and death.\n\nSmokin' Aces\n\nRelease Date: January 26, 2007\n\nDirector: Joe Carnahan\n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, Ray Liotta, Jeremy Piven, Ryan Reynolds, Peter Berg\n\nSynopsis: When a Las Vegas performer-turned-snitch named Buddy Israel (Piven)decides to turn state's evidence and testify against the mob, it seems that a whole lot of people would like to make sure he's no longer breathing.\n\nThe Hype: After the high-intensity, non-stop action trailer was released online, the excitement surrounding this movie has increased quite a bit. Not only does it feature a pretty incredible cast, but it looks to just be incredible as is.\n\nSpider-Man 3\n\nRelease Date: May 4, 2007\n\nDirector: Sam Raimi\n\nStarring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard\n\nSynopsis: A specimen from the moon gives Spider-man new powers and a black suit, while Spider-man must battle the new Green Goblin, Sandman, Venom, and other dangers.\n\nThe Hype: The single-handed most anticipated movie of 2007. I don't even need to explain why this movie alone is enough to make 2007 one of the best year's ever in movie history.\n\nStardust\n\nRelease Date: July 27, 2007\n\nDirector: Matthew Vaughn\n\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Sienna Miller, Peter O'Toole\n\nSynopsis: In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.\n\nThe Hype: From the award-winning novel by Neil Gaiman comes this fantasy adventure. It has already gained a lot of hype from fans of Neil Gaiman and could be a sleeper hit.\n\nSunshine\n\nRelease Date: March 16, 2007 (Unconfirmed)\n\nDirector: Danny Boyle\n\nStarring: Rose Byrne, Cliff Curtis, Chris Evans, Troy Garity, Cillian Murphy\n\nSynopsis: 50 years into the future, the Sun begins to die, and Earth is dying as a result. A team of astronauts are sent to revive the Sun.\n\nThe Hype: A sci-fi thriller from the director of 28 Days Later that focuses more on the psychological horror / thriller side of the story than sci-fi elements. From a behind-the-scenes video put out by Danny himself, the movie will certainly captivate all of us and should be an interesting release.\n\nSurf's Up\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2007\n\nDirector: Ash Brannon / Chris Buck\n\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, Shia LaBeouf, Zooey Deschanel, James Woods, Jane Krakowski, Jon Heder\n\nSynopsis: A behind-the-scenes look at the annual Penguin World Surfing Championship, and its newest participant, up-and-comer Cody Maverick.\n\nThe Hype: Another cute animated penguin film, but this time about penguins surfing and the life of one little penguin by the name of Cody Maverick. Nothing much has been publicly released, but from what they showed at Comic-Con, it may be better than Happy Feet.\n\nThere Will Be Blood\n\nRelease Date: 2007\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano\n\nSynopsis: A story about family, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn-of-the-century Texas prospector in the early days of the business.\n\nThe Hype: An adaptation of a novel by Upton Sinclair and directed by the guy behind Boogie Nights and Magnolia comes this film about family, greed, religion, and oil. May be an epic drama worth its penny when it comes out next year.\n\nTMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)\n\nRelease Date: March 23, 2007\n\nDirector: Kevin Munroe\n\nStarring: Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Chris Evans, Zhang Ziyi, Kevin Smith\n\nSynopsis: Strange events are occurring in New York City, and the Turtles are needed more than ever, but Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo have become lost and directionless. With the city at stake, it's up to Leonardo and Zen Master Splinter to restore unity and ninja discipline to the Turtles.\n\nThe Hype: The geeks can rejoice! The revival of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film franchise is coming back, this time in CGI animation. Although a bit shaky at first when you hear about the CGI, you'll change your mind entirely (for the better) once you see the trailer. Cowabunga!\n\nTransformers\n\nRelease Date: July 4, 2007\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nStarring: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Jon Voight, Bernie Mac, Tyrese Gibson\n\nSynopsis: Dueling alien races, the Autobots and the Decepticons, bring their battle to Earth, leaving the future of humankind hanging in the balance.\n\nThe Hype: Many of our childhood memories are brightened by the mention of Transformers. And it's now come time for a live action Transformers movie that will spend nearly a year in CGI development to tweak and perfect the transformations and robot elements; on top of being directed by Michael Bay and being released on our nation's day of celebration - July 4th. Another film that may top the list in 2007 - at least in the \"totally badass\" category.\n\nZodiac\n\nRelease Date: March 2, 2007\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Edwards\n\nSynopsis: Based on the Robert Graysmith books about the real life notorious Zodiac, a serial killer who terrorized San Francisco with a string of seemingly random murders during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe Hype: Attendees at test screenings have already made an effort to come out and speak on the internet heralding David Fincher's post-Fight Club film to be simply an astounding \"novel-like\" piece in the works.\n\nFirstShowing.net will be running events for nearly every movie listed on here.
