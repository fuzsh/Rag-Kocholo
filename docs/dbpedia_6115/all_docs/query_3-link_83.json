        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is best known for playing Harry Potter in the fantasy film franchise.\n\nRadcliffe's highest-rated film is \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2\" (2011).\n\nThe actor's lowest-rated movies are \"Playmobil: The Movie\" (2019) and \"Beast of Burden\" (2018).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe's lowest-rated film is \"Playmobil: The Movie\" (2019).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 18%\n\nSummary: In the animated film \"Playmobil: The Movie,\" Marla (voice by Anya Taylor-Joy) tries to save her brother after they're both sucked into a world made of Playmobil toys. Along the way, they meet secret agent Rex Dasher (voiced by Radcliffe) and evade the capture of Emperor Maximus (voiced by Adam Lambert).\n\nCritics felt that \"Playmobil: The Movie\" failed to measure up to similar kids' entertainment like \"The Lego Movie\" (2014).\n\n\"['Playmobil' is] best watched running in the background of a playdate for preschoolers, buried under the noise of kids' own imaginations but offering the occasional distraction from a total toddler meltdown,\" Yolanda Machado wrote for The Wrap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Sean in \"Beast of Burden\" (2018).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\nSummary: \"Beast of Burden\" follows pilot Sean Haggerty (Radcliffe) as he flies drugs across the US-Mexican border. Throughout the journey, he is forced to choose between cooperating with the US Drug Enforcement Administration or remaining loyal to the cartel.\n\nCritics praised Radcliffe's central performance but held little regard for the film's shoddy script and flimsy plot.\n\n\"'Beast of Burden' places a number of burdens on the audience, almost none of which are worth enduring,\" Kenneth Turan wrote for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Igor in \"Victor Frankenstein\" (2015).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 26%\n\nSummary: In \"Victor Frankenstein,\" Igor Strausman (Radcliffe) attempts to bring his master Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) back from the brink of madness as he tries to create a cure for death and achieve immortality.\n\nThe fantastical film proved too silly for some critics, who felt like the adaptation did a disservice to Mary Shelley's source material.\n\n\"Taken as a lurid, B-movie-style pantomime fantasy, the film is quite fun but it is vexing to see actors of the calibre of McAvoy and Radcliffe reduced to such abject mugging,\" Geoffrey Macnab wrote for The Independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe played Walter Mabry in \"Now You See Me 2\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nSummary: In the sequel to \"Now You See Me\" (2013), master magicians J. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg), Dylan (Mark Ruffalo), Merritt (Woody Harrelson), Lula (Lizzy Caplan), and Jack (Dave Franco) are blackmailed into pulling off a seemingly impossible heist by tech magnate Walter Mabry (Radcliffe).\n\nCritics praised the talent of the ensemble cast but felt that \"Now You See Me 2\" started to unravel after stacking too many twists on top of each other.\n\n\"Unfortunately the sleight-of-hand thrill of live magic becomes an unconvincing sledgehammer on the screen: layer after layer of trickery and rushing about lead to exhaustion,\" Kate Muir wrote for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Maps in \"December Boys\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 41%\n\nSummary: The coming-of-age drama \"December Boys\" centers on four orphans growing up in 1960s Australia. After they travel to a seaside town, a rumor spreads that one of them could be up for adoption and causes tension in the group.\n\nCritics were split on \"December Boys,\" with some calling it heartwarming and others reducing it to a heavy-handed melodrama.\n\n\"It packs in the schmaltz and spells out all the life lessons in case you weren't paying attention,\" wrote Fred Topel for Can Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe starred as Ignatius Perrish in \"Horns\" (2014).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 42%\n\nSummary: In the horror fantasy \"Horns,\" Ignatius \"Ig\" Perrish (Radcliffe) uses his newfound demonic powers to track down his late-girlfriend's murderer. The only problem is that he's the no. 1 suspect.\n\nRadcliffe was showered with praise for his acting performance, but critics were generally divided on the merit of the film itself.\n\n\"Radcliffe is amazing, and the film is worth the price of admission just for his performance,\" Johnny Gayzmonic wrote for Fanboys of the Universe. \"It's just unfortunate that the film around him is guilty of a bit of sloth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Miles in the action film \"Guns Akimbo\" (2020).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 51%\n\nSummary: Set in the near future, \"Guns Akimbo\" centers on Miles (Radcliffe), a video-game developer who wakes up one day to find guns attached to his hands as an unwilling contestant for a dangerous underground deathmatch.\n\nA high-octane tonic of violence, gore, and flying bullets, \"Guns Akimbo\" earned mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\"[A] brash, crass, often mind-numbing ride,\" Gary Goldstein wrote for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe played Yossi Ghinsberg in \"Jungle\" (2017).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 61%\n\nSummary: In the intense drama \"Jungle,\" Yossi Ghinsberg (Radcliffe) and his three friends set off into the Amazon rainforest for an unforgettable journey. But a horrific accident leaves him stranded and fighting to survive.\n\nLike other films on this list that didn't fare well with critics, many reviewers still enjoyed Radcliffe's acting performance even if they didn't universally share that same love for the film.\n\n\"Some hallucinogenic episodes and fantasy sequences don't really work, but Radcliffe's wild-eyed grit keeps us watching to the end,\" Jason Best wrote for What's on TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe starred as Arthur Kipps in \"The Woman in Black\" (2012).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 66%\n\nSummary: This supernatural horror film, set in 20th-century London, centers on burgeoning lawyer Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) who travels to a remote village where residents report being terrorized by a ghostly woman clothed in black.\n\nBone-chilling and genuinely scary, \"The Woman in Black\" wasn't exactly received as a home run, but it did hit a few high notes for most critics.\n\n\"A few well-trodden horror tropes aside, I needed the distraction of my phone and the safety of a blanket to keep me safe from 'The Woman In Black,'\" wrote Ed Travis for the blog Hollywood Jesus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe played John \"Jack\" Kipling in \"My Boy Jack\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 71%\n\nSummary: Based on a true story, \"My Boy Jack\" follows Rudyard (David Haig) and Caroline Kipling (Kim Cattrall) as they desperately search for their son Jack (Radcliffe) after he's reported missing in action during World War I.\n\nOverflowing with emotion, \"My Boy Jack\" moved critics, who became emotionally invested in the characters' journies.\n\n\"[Radcliffe] simply soars,\" David Wiegand wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle. \"He is the heart of the film, even when he's not onscreen.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Manny in \"Swiss Army Man\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 72%\n\nSummary: In \"Swiss Army Man,\" just as he is about to give up all hope, stranded islander Hank (Paul Dano) sees a body wash ashore. After he dubs the corpse \"Manny\" (Radcliffe), Hank forms a connection with him and tries to bring his new friend back to life.\n\nBrimming with bodily functions and odd twists and turns, \"Swiss Army Man\" may not be for everyone, but it's worth seeing at least once, according to critics.\n\n\"The movie is cheerfully gross, surreally funny, and oddly touching,\" M. Faust wrote for The Public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Tim Jenkin in \"Escape from Pretoria\" (2020).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 73%\n\nSummary: Based on a true story, the drama \"Escape from Pretoria\" follows Tim Jenkin (Radcliffe), who plots to escape Pretoria Central Prison after being taken as a political prisoner in the apartheid era.\n\nAlthough it followed a formulaic structure, \"Escape from Pretoria\" was largely praised as a strong and effective drama.\n\n\"A solid, if familiar, genre film with a true-history backdrop,\" wrote John DeFore for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe starred as Wallace in \"What If\" (2014).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 74%\n\nSummary: In the romantic comedy \"What If,\" medical-school dropout Wallace (Radcliffe) is still recovering from a string of bad relationships when he meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan).
