        "text": "To say Herschell Gordon Lewis‘ and Jeremy Kasten‘s respective The Wizard of Gore releases pushed me to my limits is correct for all the wrong reasons. My choice to stack the 1970 original and 2007 remake back-to-back stands as one of my least favorite Revenge of the Remakes double-bills thus far. I’ve no objection to gore-forward perversions that assault audiences with repugnant visuals, unless their storytelling devolves from nonsense to unintelligible drivel from one title to the next. Even worse when one of the films can’t even sustain its titular “Gore” effects.\n\nLewis’ legacy as the Grandfather of Grossouts and Sorcerer of Sadistic Splatter isn’t lost on The Wizard of Gore, unlike Allen Kahn‘s screenplay, hacked apart and reassembled to maximize the grotesque kill sequences using sheep carcass guts. Kasten’s remake didn’t have to attain Kubrickian levels of storytelling to surpass its inspiration’s narrative cohesion, and yet writer Zach Chassler somehow pens an even more incoherent showcase of carnage. At least Lewis’ discombobulated tale of illusions and dismemberment was in the name of furthering Splattergore infamy using restricted 70s methodologies. Kasten revamps Lewis’ wicked wizardry decades later, yet fails even the repulsive practical signatures of Lewis’ immoral stage presentations.\n\nThe Approach\n\nChassler’s concept for 2007’s The Wizard of Gore remake actually sounds sneakily innovative. In Lewis’ exploitation mutilator, sportswriter Jack (Wayne Ratay) initially suggests it’s a psychotic audience member slaughtering Montag the Magnificent’s (Ray Sager) “volunteers” after curtains close. Kasten and Chassler adopt this incorrect assessment as their attempt at reinvention, distancing themselves from Lewis’ emphasis on Montag’s hypnosis and the dizzying kaleidoscope finale that follows. There’s little connective tissue beyond a “wizard” and “gore” between the two films, which inspires hope compared to other copy-and-paste examples like Quarantine and [REC].\n\nKasten’s The Wizard of Gore thrusts Montag the Magnificent (Crispin Glover) into a post-punk Los Angeles drenched in aughts depravity. Ed Bigelow (Kip Pardue) survives on trust fund money as he publishes his underground newspaper, the Cacoffiny Gazette, reporting on all of LA’s fetishistic nooks and hedonistic crannies. A disheveled vagabond (Jeffrey Combs plays the maggot-eating “Geek”) hands Ed and his girlfriend Maggie (Bijou Phillips) tickets to a magic show, which brings them to Montag’s doorstep. The showman presents a trick that seemingly disembowels a stripper from the crowd, only to exhibit her alive and well afterward — before her corpse is discovered later with the same wounds Montag pretended to inflict on stage.\n\nThere’s a protagonist role reversal at play since talk show host Sherry Carson (Judy Cler) swaps for the obnoxiously vintage Ed Bigelow. There are more pieces in play with the introduction of Chinatown scumlord Dr. Chong (Brad Dourif), Ed’s coroner contact “Jinky” (Joshua Miller), and the previously mentioned opening act, the hungry hobo himself, The Geek. Ed’s investigation leads him around Los Angeles’ shadier corners — mentioning dancers from nightlife staple Jumbo’s Clown Room — and into a much more tangled web of delusion.\n\nMontag goes on with his show the same way as bodies pile, but Chassler attempts to include Ed as more than just a concerned party — not very well, either.\n\nDoes It Work?\n\nThe Wizard of Gore morphs into a pseudo-psychological thriller with splatter influences, highlighting the oddness of its rebirth. You’d presume a Herschell Gordon Lewis remake at the height of “torture porn” momentum would recontextualize the disgust audiences held towards Saw or Hostel. Kasten chases a more sleazebag-noir element that honors Los Angeles’ more exotic sensual desires — featuring the Suicide Girls of course — that lacks Lewis’ excruciatingly elongated murder vibes. Kasten includes and promotes alternate exploitations (Michael Jackson role players, bloody wrestlers), but the emphasized homages to Lewis’ practical effects excessiveness are missing in action.\n\nAlso missing is a thread that helps pull audiences through an even more careless stringing of plot developments. Ed’s inability to remember important, possibly case-breaking details is like Christopher Nolan’s Memento meets a softcore parody. The more Ed chats with Dr. Wong about Tetrodotoxin conspiracies, the more Jinky hurls evidence at Ed, and the more Montag rambles through monologues about flesh armors, the more Chassler’s screenplay disintegrates. Ed’s paranoid inner narration rambles on like a numbing drone as he anxiously inhales from a brown paper bag, supposedly to let viewers into the story’s hidden truths, yet only succeeding at layering more convolution atop inundating slipperiness.\n\nPoints are awarded for trying something outside the box, but deductions begin as soon as Ed’s bones start to annoyingly click like they’re brittle branches snapping underfoot. Christopher Duddy represents the fractures in Ed’s mind through cinematography that begins glitching what looks like virtual simulation walls as Ed scribbles clues into notebooks or warps background perspectives as Ed and Maggie sit statuesque and motionless. Steve Porcaro‘s Casio keyboard soundin’ score does little to elevate moods, as it all comes together like Ed’s Matrix is crashing and time’s running out for the film to connect all its dots in a sloppy haste. Entire scenes pass where Kasten barely understands where his film currently exists on the storyboard roadmap, but damned if anyone will ask for directions.\n\nThe Result\n\nI’m partially (and sarcastically) impressed that someone could take The Wizard of Gore and make it worse. Lewis and Kahn leave oodles to be desired when it comes to their illusionist’s grand reveal that equates to the dreaded “it’s all but a dream” twist. Kasten and Chassler would have been applauded just for cleaning up the original’s scripted mess — yet they surpass dumbfounding plotlines with an even more aggressively senseless redo. Where Lewis barters in barbaric bloodlust that projects inhuman torture at a premium (commentary about society’s inability to look away from a trainwreck), Kasten chooses to inject uncomfortable sexual gratification and other distracting forms of exploitation as if Lewis’ old-school butchery wasn’t edgy enough for 2000s audiences.\n\nIt seems sacrilegious to remake a Herschell Gordon Lewis massacre with digital effects, and yet here we are, watching Montag wipe away animated blood spots from his torso. There’s some righteous gore when effects supervisors Elvis Jones and Jason Collins are allowed to open Victim #1 like a piñata filled with squishy organ treats for Montag to tear away with glee. There’s also too much killing done off-camera and digital workarounds when traps become too complicated (a bear trap decapitation). There’s more attention paid to goth raver costume designs — because how can we skimp on the Nazi-dressed audience member — while Lewis’ nauseating spectacle that claws out eyeballs and flings Pine-Sol-coated sheep chunks into actresses’ mouths is never outshone. Kasten rips the leaking heart and screaming soul from The Wizard of Gore, replacing it with computerized bits that might be faster but are in no way stronger.\n\nYou’re not watching Lewis’ films for acting masterclasses, which Kasten’s update keeps consistent — except for Crispin Glover. He’s the absurd white-suited master of ceremonies out of our fan-casting dreams. The way he introduces himself by squealing, “Sit down bitch! YOU, die tonight,” will bring a smile to anyone who desires to see Glover embrace the delicious weirdness of eccentric roles. He’s over-enunciating like a champion, projecting himself into your living room, and glows the unhinged personality of a magician who’s lost touch with moral expectations. Kasten’s The Wizard of Gore may be the worse production, but Glover dominates Montag the Magnificent comparisons.\n\nThe Lesson\n\nCredit where credit is due, Jeremy Kasten and Zach Chassler exhibit proper remake practices from vastly altered storytelling to nailing Montag’s casting with the best possible choice. The Wizard of Gore is — on paper — an intriguing approach to remake filmmaking. Although, proper intentions only get you so far. Even with the right mindset, you must produce a movie people will enjoy watching on the basest cinematic levels of competence. That’s where Kasten and Chassler fail, possibly as poorly as the impossibly disastrous April Fool’s Day remake.\n\nSo what did we learn?\n\n● While it’s partly about how you start, it’s also about how you finish.\n\n● You should still honor the hallmarks of an original, even if your story veers in another direction.\n\n● The 2000s has its share of stinker remakes amidst all the underappreciated gems.\n\n● I’ll take deceased animal parts (sourced naturally) over pixelated blood any day.\n\nThere are still so many more popular horror remakes left for me to cover, but I chose The Wizard of Gore because I wanted something less expected and wholly new to myself. Reader, I’m not thrilled. Next month’s entry will be two comfort-as-hell watches because I need to wash the cleaning product taste out of my mouth. All the respect to Herschell Gordon Lewis and his pioneering slaughterhouse foundations — I just needed something more from storytellers. Doubly so from a remake that captures one of my favorite Crispin Glover uses — he is innocent — and jettisons the performance into unfortunate irrelevance since it’s shackled to one of the worst horror reimaginings in the game.\n\nIn Revenge of the Remakes, columnist Matt Donato takes us on a journey through the world of horror remakes. We all complain about Hollywood’s lack of originality whenever studios announce new remakes, reboots, and reimaginings, but the reality? Far more positive examples of refurbished classics and updated legacies exist than you’re willing to remember (or admit). The good, the bad, the unnecessary – Matt’s recounting them all.\n\nWARNING: The following contains major spoilers for the Alien franchise.\n\nOf all of horror’s many sagas, few have produced such complex and dynamic female characters as the Alien franchise. From space-trekking astronauts and idealistic scientists to outlaw clones and alien queens, this cinematic galaxy is bursting with inspirational – and sometimes despicable – women fighting for their own survival.\n\nThough Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) remains the series’ most enduring character, each chapter in the century-spanning saga either delivers a new female warrior or expands our understanding of the story’s original survivor.\n\nAlien (1979)\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien sets the tone for a landmark series in cinematic female empowerment. The USCSS Nostromo is not only guided by an AI system known as Mother, two women occupy prominent roles in the disparate crew. When their mission is interrupted by a new directive from executives of the Weyland-Yutani corporation, the disgruntled team lands on Planetoid LV-426 to track down a mysterious distress signal. Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), the ship’s navigator, takes part in an exploratory mission that leaves Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt) mortally wounded with an alien entity attached to his face. When Lambert and Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) attempt to bring him back onto the ship, Ripley insists they observe protocol procedures and order them to stay outside and away from the rest of the crew. Unfortunately, the ship’s nefarious Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm) disregards her orders and opens the door, allowing the alien creature onboard as well.\n\nReleased in 1979, Alien presents a harrowing study of bodily autonomy. Not only do we see a man forcibly impregnated with alien spawn, Kane dies in a gruesome approximation of cesarean birth. But the ship’s only female crew members also suffer uncomfortably sexualized attacks. When Lambert is confronted by the fully grown xenomorph, the creature runs its tail up her legs before killing her offscreen, suggesting a penetrative death. Later, when Ripley confronts Ash about his responsibility in letting the monster onboard, the synthetic attacks her by attempting to stuff a rolled-up porn magazine into her mouth. Though admittedly uncomfortable, Scott sets an even playing field and allows both men and women to experience sexualized violence. Though Lambert does not survive the alien encounter, Ripley does find empowerment and salvation by orchestrating a plan to blow up the contaminated ship and suck the alien creature out into space.\n\nAliens (1986)\n\nJames Cameron’s sequel Aliens plays with female strength by pitting two fearsome mothers against each other to protect their young. After drifting in space for 57 years, Ripley is rescued and ultimately convinced to return to LV-426 to help find a group of terraformars who have lost contact with the corporation. As the new crew awakens from stasis, one of the marines sent to handle this “bug hunt” wakes herself up by doing pullups from the locker room infrastructure. Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) seems to resent Ripley’s presence onboard and makes a derisive reference to “sleeping beauty” while admiring her own impressive physique. Though she has a strong relationship with a fellow marine called Drake (Mark Rolston), she faces harassment from one of the team’s squeakier wheels. Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) asks if she’s ever been mistaken for a woman, likely commenting on her masculine style, short hair, and affection for large guns. But this confident woman quips back, “No. Have you?” refusing to be shamed for her strength and aggression. Throughout the film, Vasquez proves to be the strongest member of the marine team and sacrifices her own life to take out a swarm of approaching xenomorphs.\n\nAs Ripley predicted, the marine unit arrives to find the colony decimated and the terraform structures overrun with aliens. The only human survivor is a little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) whom Ripley seems to adopt as her own. Unfortunately, another villainous agent of the Weyland-Yutani corporation has joined the mission. Burke (Paul Reiser) plans to release two facehuggers to impregnate Ripley and Newt then sneak the valuable embryonic species past quarantine while the woman and child lie frozen in cryo-sleep. Whereas Ash was more concerned with scientific discovery, Burke plans to sacrifice mother and child while jeopardizing the continuation of humanity for the chance for a massive personal payday. With the help of several altruistic marines, Ripley is able to subvert this sinister plan and Burke winds up in the claws of the very monster he planned to capture.\n\nWhile searching for Newt, Ripley stumbles upon a field of alien eggs waiting to hatch and impregnate more humans with their parasitic spawn. While surveying the pods, she notices a majestic xenomorph queen who’s egg sack is busily producing multitudes of these dangerous eggs. Ripley rescues Newt from a nearby cocoon then threatens to torch the eggs if the queen will not let her pass. The two mothers come to a stalemate and agree to let the others’ offspring survive, but Ripley changes her mind the moment she clears this alien minefield. With a giant flamethrower, she torches the eggs, sending the queen into an understandable, murderous rage. This betrayal sets up the franchise’s most iconic moment as Ripley dons a heavy steel loader making herself a physical match to the gigantic alien queen. Both mothers battle to the death in defense of their children with Ripley once again jettisoning the xenomorph into deep space.\n\nAlien 3 (1992)\n\nRipley is the only significant female character in David Fincher’s Alien³ and this directly puts her life in danger. After crash landing on Fiorina 161, a men’s penal colony filled with murderers and sex offenders, she learns that Newt and the other two passengers did not survive the collision. Stranded amongst the male prisoners and guards, she has only Clemens (Charles Dance), the colony’s doctor, for protection. Venturing out into the nearby structures, Ripley insists on searching Newt’s body for alien infestation and is cornered by a group of dangerous prisoners. She finds an uneasy ally in Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), a felon turned spiritual leader, who fights the men off though he’s more concerned with the safety and peace of his followers.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a female being on Fiorina 161 threatening Ripley. Though Newt’s body is clean, examination reveals that Ripley herself has been impregnated while in stasis. She now carries the embryo of the queen, a monster who will lay thousands of eggs, each capable of destroying the entire prison population. With Weyland-Yutani operatives certain to harvest the species for use as a biological weapon, Ripley sacrifices her life to destroy the burgeoning queen. She throws herself into a massive furnace and dies to save the world from her greatest enemy.\n\nAlien Resurrection (1997)\n\nSet 200 years after the events of the third film, Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Alien Resurrection brings back the popular heroine via the process of cloning. The story opens with doctors working with an infantile version of the adult character then surgically removing an alien embryo from her chest. This lab-grown Ripley possesses much of the former astronaut’s strength and grit, but DNA splicing has given her exceptional strength and the ability to rapidly heal. After three films following this remarkable heroine, it’s fun to watch Weaver dabble in villainy. Not only does she attempt to kill her captors, the clone also empathizes with the alien species and refers to herself as “monster’s mother.”\n\nA later scene will show the horrors it took to bring this woman to life. While searching the ship, Ripley stumbles upon a room full of scientific nightmares. Noting the eight tattooed on her own arm, she finds seven failed versions who preceded her birth, each a different variation on a human/xenomorph nightmare. Even worse, the seventh clone is still alive. This pathetic humanoid creature has been confined to a hospital bed and begs to be put out of her misery. Ripley obliges, then weeps not only for the luck of her successful creation, but for the earlier clones and their intense suffering.\n\nWhen mercenaries clash with the ship’s military crew, Ripley meets a female clone determined to wipe out the aliens once and for all. Call (Winona Ryder) sneaks into Ripley’s stark quarters and attempts to remove the embryo from Ripley’s chest, only to find it has already been harvested. The two women eventually form a close bond and work together to kill the queen before it can reach Earth and begin to reproduce. Despite bonding with the monster she birthed and a subsequent offspring known as the Newborn, Ripley maintains her devotion to humanity. With her acidic blood, she cuts a tiny hole in the ship’s outer wall, causing the screaming Newborn to be sucked out to space, one gruesome piece of viscera at a time.\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nPaul W.S. Anderson’s Alien vs. Predator remains the only film to center a woman of color as the story’s main protagonist. Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) is a nature guide contracted by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) to explore a newly discovered heat source located 2,000 miles below the frozen surface of Bouvetoya, a remote island off the coast of Antarctica. After penetrating this massive ice shield, the team finds a place of ritual sacrifice. Worshiped as gods by ancient human civilizations, Predators have been traveling to Earth once a century for a ceremonial hunt of the world’s most dangerous species: the xenomorph. In order to create wild alien game, they sacrifice several humans, but have orchestrated a failsafe plan to keep the deadly creatures from reaching the earth’s surface.\n\nAs the team becomes host to these terrifying parasites, Alexa and a Predator called Scar (Ian Whyte) create a pact to kill them all. Though Scar does not survive, Alexa manages to destroy the newly hatched aliens as well as the fearsome alien queen. She is rewarded for her bravery with a ceremonial spear from the Predators’ arsenal and a small facial scar symbolizing her own first kill and acceptance into this powerful race of intergalactic hunters.\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)\n\nIn a series filled with inspiring female characters, Colin and Greg Strause’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem feels noticeably bereft. When Scar’s body spawns a hybrid predator/alien hatchling, the Predalien finds its way to Earth and begins to attack the citizens of Gunnison, Colorado. Though several women fall victim to this deadly invasion, only Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth) emerges with any kind of empowerment. The former soldier has just concluded a tour of duty and now finds herself somewhat estranged from her husband Tim (Sam Trammell) and young daughter Molly (Ariel Gade). The struggling family finds themselves caught in the crosshairs of a battle between the Predalien and his xenomorph siblings and Wolf (Whyte), a lone Predator sent to destroy these murderous beasts. When Tim dies trying to defend their home, Kelly escapes with Molly and joins other survivors to find refuge outside of the crumbling town.\n\nFortunately Police Chief Morales (John Ortiz) has made contact with military representatives and plans to gather survivors for an air evacuation in the center of town. But Kelly senses something is amiss and breaks off with a small group to find the town’s medevac helicopter. After battling their way through a hospital overrun with xenomorphs and facehuggers, Kelly, Molly, and a two recently reunited brothers manage to fly away moments before the military drops a tactical bomb on Gunnison, wiping out the surviving citizens along with both races of warring extraterrestrials. It’s not a particularly uplifting conclusion, but Kelly does manage to survive by listening to her instincts and acting in time to save her daughter.\n\nPrometheus (2012)\n\nRidley Scott’s highly anticipated return to the Alien franchise, Prometheus, begins with the conception of humanity. A large man who will come to be known as an Engineer (Daniel James), ingests a mysterious black substance near a picturesque waterfall then begins to disintegrate as his DNA sparks cells that will eventually become the human race. Generations after this fascinating moment, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a star map etched into the walls of an ancient cave dwelling and interpret it to be an invitation to commune with these beings. Once they’ve arrived on LV-223, they realize their idealistic speculation couldn’t be further from the truth. This massive race of engineers likely lost control of a biological weapon which destroyed the colony. Once awakened by the ship’s synthetic David (Michael Fassbender), the sole remaining Engineer (Whyte) intends to release the weapon on earth to decimate its human population.\n\nDue to his extensive programming and learning capabilities, David appears to be a protective force on the exploratory ship. However, the ship’s director, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) sees through his pleasant persona. Daughter of the ultra-wealthy Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), she knows that their true mission to the planet is to grant the elderly CEO eternal life. When David infects Halloway with the strange black fluid, Vickers prohibits him from reboarding the ship. Like Ripley before her, she insists that his unknown condition may put the rest of the crew in mortal danger.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s too late to prevent contamination. Dr. Shaw has already been impregnated with a strange alien form. Horrified by its rapid growth and unknown origins, she hijacks an automated surgical table and performs a self-cesarean to remove the offending creature from her own abdomen. Despite her heroic efforts, these creatures wreak havoc on the surviving crew in addition to the remaining Engineer who plans to wipe out the human race. Dr. Shaw eventually uses her own aborted spawn, now a fully grown alien being, to defeat the Engineer. With David’s help, she launches a second spacecraft intent on discovering why they insist on targeting humans.\n\nAlien: Covenant (2017)\n\nScott’s Alien: Covenant may feature the greatest amount of prominent female characters in the franchise’s history, but they fill roles similar to Lambert and Ripley in the original film. We join the sleeping crew of the USCSS Covenant en route to colonize a remote planet known as Origae-6 as a solar flare threatens the ship’s stability and causes a deadly malfunction in the captain’s cryo-pod. While mourning this loss and adjusting their plans, they receive a vaguely human signal from a nearby planet. Against the advice of chief terraformist Daniels (Katherine Waterston), the newly appointed captain Oram (Billy Crudup) orders an exploratory mission to the newly discovered land in hopes of avoiding a longer trip to their original destination. But a mysterious spore lurks in the seemingly pleasant air and two crewmembers become infected with alien spawn.\n\nAlso hiding in the planet’s lush vegetation is David, the only survivor of the Prometheus mission lost ten years before. Though he initially appears to be a benevolent force, his plans may be more devious than those of Ash from the Nostromo’s doomed flight. Using the body of Dr. Shaw, he has been carefully cultivating the alien species and believes it to be far superior to the humans currently colonizing the galaxy. He plans to use Daniels’ body to harvest a queen, then implant her eggs into the sleeping bodies of the Covenant’s 2,000 colonists. Unlike the original film’s conclusion, Alien: Covenant ends on a dire note as Danni slips into cryo-sleep moments after learning that her body will soon become host to a biological weapon.\n\nThis legendary franchise has been at the forefront of sci-fi innovation and special effects design for more than four decades. However, in addition to the terrifying creatures that emerge from each film, the continuing story presents a strong female character who fights to protect not only the safety of those around her, but the sanctity of her own womb. Ridley Scott may have designed the original cast to be gender neutral, but with nuanced explorations of pregnancy, gestation, motherhood, and care, the Alien franchise has become an enduring story of female empowerment and women fighting for their right to bodily autonomy.\n\nDon’t miss Cailee Spaeny as the franchise’s next heroine in Alien: Romulus."
