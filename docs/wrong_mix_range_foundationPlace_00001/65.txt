Lansdale Lions Club was founded in 1938. As of February 2023 we have 23 members. We are the chartering organization for Troop and Pack 399, Montgomeryville, PA. Without the Lansdale Lions Club they would not be able to function as they are today. We also give back to the community by cleaning the Wisshickon Creek in the area near Knapp Elementary. Our Leo Club provides community service to Manna on Main Street , Elm Terrace and various other social activities. We collect and recycle eye glasses through various drop boxes and drop off locations. We also support the Lions Eye Bank of Delaware Valley and the Overbook School for the Blind.
