Read the article\n\nResearch shows that 2% of hospitalized patients experience serious preventable medication-related incidents that can be life-threatening, cause permanent harm, or result in death. Published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, our best-performing AI model was able to anticipate physicianâs actual prescribing decisions 75% of the time, based on de-identified electronic health records and the doctorâs prescribing records. This is an early step towards testing the hypothesis that machine learning can support clinicians in ways that prevent mistakes and help to keep patients safe. Read the article"
