Then, put the sealed secrecy envelope into the official return envelope and complete the Voter’s Declaration on the back, taking care to sign & date the outer envelope. Ballots that are not in both envelopes cannot be counted per Pennsylvania Election Code.\n\nPursuant to the Pennsylvania Election Code, voted ballots may only be returned by the individual voter and not by any other individuals.\n\nAll drop box locations are monitored using CCTV video surveillance. Anyone depositing a ballot that does not belong to them without a Designated Agent Form will be referred to the District Attorney’s Office.\n\nOnly ballots issued by Montgomery County, PA can be returned to a Montgomery County, PA secure ballot drop box. If you live in another county, you must return your ballot to that county's Election Board.\n\nIf a voter has an illness or disability that will prevent them from dropping off their ballot, they can designate an agent to pick up or drop off their ballot. The agent can only pick up or drop off ballots for voters who are in the same household, and the ballot can only be picked up at the Voter Services Office located at 425 Swede St., 6th Floor, Norristown, PA 19401. The first page should be signed by the agent, and the second page should be signed by the voter. Click here to access the Certification of Designated Agent form.\n\nVoters can also return their ballots to any Montgomery County Voter Services office locations during office hours."
