        "text": "“We called AAA for a tow on a exotic car on Wednesday evening. After companies refusing to tow this car AAA was able to get Bobs Auto clinic to do the tow. We had Bill as our tow guy. This guy was amazing he stuck with the job and wasn't going to give up. Had he given up the car would have been either stolen or pieced out by the drug addicts. Bill has the biggest heart and understands life, and what people are going through. I had never even heard of this company before but now they have any business I can give them. I am also going to be telling everyone I know how great Bill at Bobs Auto clinic is. Being a hairdresser I talk to a lot of people. Bill you were a god sent and we all appreciate how hard and how determined you are. You have clients for life when we call AAA we are going to request Bobs Auto Clinic. Thanks the yellow Ferrari gang.”\n\n“After having the worst experience of my life with another tow company, I reluctantly called Bobs. The driver, Jay, was so friendly and anxious to help. I was so overwhelmed with how kind hearted and friendly, on top of being knowledgeable, Jay offered me a water and when I got in his truck, he helped me in (as the truck he was driving was 8 times the size of mine), and the truck was immaculate inside and out!!! Jay was extremely funny, and made my day a more enjoyable one. Quick response and outstanding skills, this is the best experience Ive ever had anywhere! I recommend Bobs AAA towing AND repairs to anyone; Tracy”\n\n“BOB'S is the BEST! I called AAA and Michael got to my car before I did. Michael was amazing. Changed my tire in torrential pouring rain. He had the Best attitude ever. I felt guilty having him work in the terrible weather - but he was so relaxed and friendly. I'm gonna use Bob's in the future for other automotive needs. Thank you, Michael! Thank you Bob's.”\n\n“I used their towing company and these guys and honest and ethical. Importantly, they have the experience to deal with complex situations.\n\nMy car broke down last week with broken axle and wheel off. I had called AAA and they send Five Points towing to tow my car. When the 5 points guy came, he refused to take my car to auto repair shop of my choice and came up with all kinds of excuses and insisted on taking me to their 5 Points auto repair shop. When I put my foot down, they demanded I pay an extra $250 to tow my car just 5 miles for use of special equipment. I called AAA and the agent confirmed that my membership covers the towing as well as use of any special equipment as part of the towing. However, the 5 points towing guys refused to tow unless I paid $250.\n\nAAA finally sent Bob's Auto Clinic Towing. Bob's Clinic guy was courteous and experienced. My car towing was not an standard towing since the wheel was off. However Bob's towing guy was amazing and managed to get my car on and off the truck with my wheel off and tow it to auto repair place of my choice.”\n\n“Big john turned my entire day around when he towed my truck back to Philly this weekend! I had a horrible experience with a tow from the turnpike so I can honestly say I probably wasn't in the Sweetest of moods, but john was nothing but pleasant and made everything go MUCH more smoothly than it had all day long..\n\nThanks john for turning my day around!!!!!”\n\n“I've brought my car in for some pretty serious repairs twice over the past 2 months and Bob's has delivered every time! They are no hassle to deal with. Finding a good mechanic is difficult because you never know what is true and what is not. But Bob's not only shoots you straight, but I never feel like they are trying to up sell me or convince me I need unnecessary work done on my car.\n\nIf you live in the Lansdale area and need work done on your car, Bob's is the best choice!”\n\n“I love Bob's Towing! Today was the second time that Bob's came to my rescue.\n\nThe first time I used them was February 2014. It was freezing cold and I went outside super excited because I was about to go adopt my new dog! My excitement was quickly squashed when I noticed my flat tire. I called AAA and they dispatched Bob's to come repair. They were timely and professional.\n\nToday I had just finished my wegmans trip and loaded my car up with groceries to discover a dead battery! I called AAA and once again Bob's came to my rescue. And once again they provided prompt service and professionalism. Ben was able to charge my battery, test it and replace the old one within about 15 minutes of his arrival. He did it with a sense of humor even though it was cold as H-E-double-hockey-sticks outside.\n\nThanks Bob's for saving me not once but twice! No offense but I hope I don't see you anytime soon! ;)”\n\n“Bob's auto clinic gets high marks from me. I had a flat tire yesterday on my lexus and i live in CT and have never been to anyone but the dealership for service... So John came out put on the donut, took my rim and tire and a few hours later on my way back to CT, i drove up and Bob had me out in less than 10 minutes. he went out and got the specific tire for me and charged me a very fair price that morning. i'm a blue bell native and wish i still lived in the area to support a businessman such as Bob. i couldn't have had a better experience. (unless he can find a way to fix all the potholes in montgomery county!!)”\n\n“Don't judge a book by its cover. When you drive by this place, you will probably think, 'There is no way in hell I'm going to have my car fixed here.' But that would be a big mistake for you.\n\nI've taken my cars for repairs with Bob several times. Bob is as honest as they come. He diagnoses the problem and charges a very fair price. When you compare his work and price compared to any dealer, Bob will save you tons of money.\n\nAny repair I've had done by him has been done professionally, on time and on budget. Further, I've never had to take back my car because of faulty labor.\n\nBob is straight forward, so don't be intimated by him. He is the real deal if you want you car fixed properly and for a fair price.”"
