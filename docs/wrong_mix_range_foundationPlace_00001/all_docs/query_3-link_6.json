Google.org supports nonprofits and organizations that are working with the most vulnerable groups of SMB owners, who are also among the hardest hit by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.1\n\nThe nature of work is changing. Both workers and workforce development organizations need better access to digital skills and tools to help them adjust to the demands of our current economy and find new opportunities.\n\nTo support these efforts, Google.org has committed more than $50 million globally to fund research and development projects to better understand how work is changing and identify new solutions.\n\nWe support organizations using data and technology to enable everyone to create and live in a more sustainable world.\n\nAs cities now account for more than 70% of global emissions, it is critical that they are supported in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Tools like Google’s Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), which has expanded to more than 100 cities worldwide, makes it easier to measure, plan, and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSince 2005, we have committed more than $250 million to tackle global education gaps, while empowering Googlers to volunteer their technical expertise. Our goal is to help more people—especially those in underserved communities—benefit from the promise of technology, in the classroom and beyond.\n\nWe know that reading is a critical life skill. Unfortunately, far too many children around the world don’t have access to engaging and affordable reading resources in their mother tongue, which can cause literacy development delays.\n\nA 2019 study from the Stanford History Education Group, found that two-thirds of high school students surveyed in the United States couldn’t tell the difference between news stories and ads.\n\nIn collaboration with the Google News Initiative, Google.org has committed $10 million to support organizations working on global media literacy efforts to help people distinguish quality content online."
