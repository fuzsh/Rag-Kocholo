        "text": "Google Career Certificates are designed to prepare you for an entry-level role in job fields like data analytics, digital marketing & e-commerce, IT support, project management, and UX design. Upon completion of a Google Career Certificate, like this one, certificate graduates in the U.S. will have the option to share their information with top U.S. employers that are hiring entry-level professionals, like HCL, World Wide Technology, Infosys, AT&T, Wells Fargo and of course, Google. Employer consortiums are currently available in the U.S., Canada, India, Singapore, Indonesia and are coming to more countries soon. The employers included will vary by country.\n\nGoogle had long faced an issue that many other companies also contend with: We had open IT support roles, but not enough qualified candidates to fill them. So we built and tested a training program to provide pathways to jobs in technical support at Google for people with no college degree or experience. In 2018, Google launched the IT Support Certificate so that this training could be available to everyone. Since then, thousands of people have completed the program. In the United States, 75% of certificate graduates report a positive career outcome (e.g., new job, promotion, or raise) within six months of completion.Â¹\n\nWhen we saw the positive impact this program was having on people all over the world, we expanded into additional fast-growing, high-paying career fields: cybersecurity, data analytics, digital marketing & e-commerce, project management and UX design. Built and taught by Google, these certificates prepare people from all backgrounds for jobs in fields with great demand for qualified candidates. No degree or previous experience is required. Graduates get the chance to connect directly with over 150 U.S. employers who are accepting Google Career Certificates for open jobs.\n\nÂ¹Based on program graduate survey, United States, 2022.\n\nThose planning to attend a degree program can utilize ACEÂ®ï¸ recommendationsOpens in a new tab or ECTS recommendationsOpens in a new tab, the industry standard for translating workplace learning to college credit. Learners can earn an ACE recommendation of up to 15 college creditsOpens in a new tab, or 5 ECTS credits, for completing the IT Support Certificate. This aims to help open up additional pathways to learners who are interested in higher education, and prepare them for entry-level jobs.\n\nTo share proof of completion with schools, certificate graduates will receive an email prompting them to claim their CredlyOpens in a new tab badge, which contains the ACE Â® ï¸ or ECTS credit recommendation.Â Once claimed, they will receive a competency-based transcript that signifies the credit recommendation, which can be shared directly with a school from the Credly platform. Please note that the decision to accept specific credit recommendations is up to each institution and is not guaranteed.Â\n\nCertificate graduates who also pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams will earn a dual credential from CompTIA and Google.\n\nThe Google IT Support Professional Certificate program aligns with the objectives covered by the newly updatedÂ CompTIA A+Opens in a new tabÂ certification.Â This Certificate program contains content that prepares you to take the CompTIA A+ exam. Upon completion of the certificate program, you can download the CompTIA A+Â exam objectivesOpens in a new tabÂ to ensure that youâve studied everything before taking the exams.\n\nIf you complete the certificate and pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams, youâll have access to a new dual credential from CompTIA and Google: a badge that can be posted on LinkedIn to catch the attention of potential employers.
