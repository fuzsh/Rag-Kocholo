Open Doors.\n\nThe people of Lansdale United Methodist Church welcome you and invite you to find out more about our church community. This church is our foundation from which we move into the world to nurture, witness and reach out to persons and families in the congregation and the community. This is how we continue the earthly ministry of Jesus.\n\nJoin us in joyful worship, heartfelt prayer, and a rich experience of faith and work in which we grow in spiritual well-being. Our hearts, minds and doors are open to help you find the saving power of God and to nurture you to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.\n\nOur History\n\nMethodism is considered one of the greatest renewal movements in the history of the Christian church. Founded by English brothers John and Charles Wesley in 1738, our church is based on the Methodist principles of grace through faith expressed in preaching, writing, song, mutual care and outreach to others.\n\nThe United Methodist Church formed when the Evangelical United Brethren – a product of religious revival among German speaking populations of Pennsylvania and Maryland at the turn of the 19th century – merged with the Methodist Church in 1968.\n\nThe Lansdale Methodist Church was founded in 1871 and was the first church in the borough of Lansdale. Its original site was Third and Walnut and first served a small community that was anchored by the railroad. As the Lansdale area grew, so did the church. By 1919 the present site at Third and Broad streets became our second home to a growing congregation. Today’s church building is a visible sign of our continued presence and support of the community. But it is our members who are the active and outward sign of God’s presence in the world.\n\nPraising God\n\n9:00 am Sunday Worship – rituals, creeds, prayers, monthly communion, and a powerful message you will find applicable in today’s world.\n\nJr Church – Children ages 3- 4th grade are welcome to attend Jr Church during the worship hour.
