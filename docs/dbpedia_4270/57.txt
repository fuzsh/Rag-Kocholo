J.K. Moser curriculum vitae and bibliography

Abstract

The year 2008 marks the eightieth anniversary of J. Moser’s birth; the following year it will be the tenth anniversary of his death. This special issue honors his memory as a leading mathematician of the modern era and as a great human being. The articles in this memorial issue are presented in two parts and cover a broad range of topics in which J. Moser worked. The first part contains contributions devoted to integrable systems and some related issues. The second part (RCD, January 2009, vol. 14, no. 1) contains papers on KAM theory and applications, stability problems, problems of celestial mechanics, etc.

Some of the contributions are brief recollections of meetings and working with J. Moser. We also reprint his remarkable and still very relevant lecture (ICM’1998, Berlin) "Dynamical Systems — Past and Present".

The main content is preceded by Moser’s curriculum vitae and bibliography.

Abstract

We show that there exists a projective dynamics of a particle. It underlies intrinsically the classical particle dynamics as projective geometry underlies Euclidean geometry. In classical particle dynamics a particle moves in the Euclidean space subjected to a potential. In projective dynamics the position space has only the local structure of the real projective space. The particle is subjected to a field of projective forces. A projective force is not an element of the tangent bundle to the position space, but of some fibre bundle isomorphic to the tangent bundle.

These statements are direct consequences of Appell’s remarks on the homography in mechanics, and are compatible with similar statements due to Tabachnikov concerning projective billiards. When we study Euclidean geometry we meet some particular properties that we recognize as projective properties. The same is true for the dynamics of a particle. We show that two properties in classical particle dynamics are projective properties. The fact that the Keplerian orbits close after one turn is a consequence of a more general projective statement. The fact that the fields of gravitational forces are divergence free is a projective property of these fields.

Abstract

Infinite- and finite-dimensional lattices of Lotka–Volterra type are derived that possess Lax representations and have large families of first integrals. The obtained systems are Hamiltonian and contain perturbations of Volterra lattice. Examples of Liouville-integrable 4-dimensional Hamiltonian Lotka-Volterra systems are presented. Several 5-dimensional Lotka–Volterra systems are found that have Lax representations and are Liouville-integrable on constant levels of Casimir functions.

Abstract

We consider a nonholonomic system describing the rolling of a dynamically nonsymmetric sphere over a fixed sphere without slipping. The system generalizes the classical nonholonomic Chaplygin sphere problem and it is shown to be integrable for one special ratio of radii of the spheres. After a time reparameterization the system becomes a Hamiltonian one and admits a separation of variables and reduction to Abel–Jacobi quadratures. The separating variables that we found appear to be a non-trivial generalization of ellipsoidal (spheroconic) coordinates on the Poisson sphere, which can be useful in other integrable problems.

Using the quadratures we also perform an explicit integration of the problem in theta-functions of the new time.

Abstract

We construct a new symplectic, bi-Hamiltonian realization of the KM-system by reducing the corresponding one for the Toda lattice. The bi-Hamiltonian pair is constructed using a reduction theorem of Fernandes and Vanhaecke. In this paper we also review the important work of Moser on the Toda and KM-systems.

Abstract

The relation between the characteristics of the equilibrium configurations of the classical Calogero–Moser integrable systems and properties of the ground state of their quantum analogs is found. It is shown that under the condition of factorization of the wave function of these systems the coordinates of classical particles at equilibrium are zeroes of the polynomial solutions of the second-order linear differential equation. It turns out that, under these conditions, the dependence of classical and quantum minimal energies on the parameters of the interaction potential is the same.

Abstract

We study restricted multiple three wave interaction system by the inverse scattering method. We develop the algebraic approach in terms of classical $r$-matrix and give an interpretation of the Poisson brackets as linear $r$-matrix algebra. The solutions are expressed in terms of polynomials of theta functions. In particular case for $n = 1$ in terms of Weierstrass functions.

Abstract

This paper deals with Lagrangian bundles which are symplectic torus bundles that occur in integrable Hamiltonian systems. We review the theory of obstructions to triviality, in particular monodromy, as well as the ensuing classification problems which involve the Chern and Lagrange class. Our approach, which uses simple ideas from differential geometry and algebraic topology, reveals the fundamental role of the integer affine structure on the base space of these bundles. We provide a geometric proof of the classification of Lagrangian bundles with fixed integer affine structure by their Lagrange class.
