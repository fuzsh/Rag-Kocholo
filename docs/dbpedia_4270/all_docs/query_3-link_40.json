The author himself selected the works to be published. The idea of publishing a separate volume of J. Moser’s works occured during the preparation of publishing a special issue of the Regular and Chaotic Dynamics journal dedicated to the 70th birthday of J. Moser. J. Moser wished to exposed to the Russian reader to a broader range of his ideas, thus instead of a single volume we decided to publish three volumes. Each volume comprises works sharing the same idea and the same methods of solution. The second volume, KAM-theory and stability issues, was released in Russian in 2001. The third volume is scheduled to appear at the end of 2003. Based upon discussions with us, J. Moser decided the ﬁrst volume ought to be devoted to integrable systems and some related issues. The second volume contains works on the KAM-theory, stability issues and invariant curves. The works collected in the third volume may be less well known to the Russian reader, they mostly deal with topology, averaging methods, normal forms and the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations. The works of each volume are arranged in chronological order to illustrate that throughout his life J. Moser revisited many of his ideas and methods, each time obtaining more profound and complete results. The style of the works of J. Moser is transparent. He never launches into lengthy discussions of vague generalities or uses confusing deﬁnitions and statements. He never makes the exposition too formal unless it is absolutely necessary. It should be noted that J. Moser inherited this style of writing from his teacher C. Zigel. We hope that the three-volume collection of J. Moser’s works in English will be useful for a broad range of mathematicians, engineers and physicists. For a young researcher his works serve as an example illustrating all stages of scientiﬁc exploration: from the formulation of a problem to a lucid presentation of the results. This edition is issued in commemoration of Jurgen Moser who died on 17 Dec 1999 at age 71, in Zurich.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\nFinitely Many Mass Points on the Line under the Influence of an Exponential Potential. — An Integrable System1\n\n§ 1. Analogue of the Toda Lattice for Finitely Many Mass Points We consider the analogue of the Toda lattice [8] where only a ﬁnite number of mass points are admitted which move freely on the real axis. Denoting the position of the mass points by xk , k = 1, . . . , n, we form the Hamiltonian n\n\nn−1\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nyk2 + e(xk −xk+1 ) H= 1 2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith the differential equations x˙ k = Hyk = yk , y˙ k = −Hxk = e\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , n, xk−1 −xk\n\ny˙ 1 = −Hx1 = −e\n\nx1 −x2\n\n,\n\n− exk −xk+1 ,\n\nk = 2, 3, . . . , n − 1,\n\n(1.2)\n\ny˙ n = −Hxn = exn−1 −xn . Thus we can write our system (1.2) as xk = exk−1 −xk − exk −xk+1 ,\n\nk = 1, . . . , n.\n\n(1.2′ )\n\nif we set ex0 −x1 = 0 and exn −xn+1 = 0, that is we have the formal boundary condition x0 = −∞, xn+1 = +∞. (1.3) It is the aim to study completely the ﬂow determined by this system of differential equations and relate the solution to the existence of n integrals of the 1 Proc.\n\nBattelle Rencontres Lecture Notes in Physics, 38, 1975.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n20\n\nFinitely Many Mass Points on the Line\n\nmotion. These integrals are essentially the same as those found by Henon [4] and Flaschka [1] for the same system of differential equations (1.2′ ) under periodic boundary conditions, say xk+n = xk + 1,\n\nyk+n = yk ,\n\nk = 0, ±1, . . .\n\n(1.3′ )\n\nThe crucial difference between the two problems is that the boundary condition (1.3′ ) gives rise to a compact energy surface and the solutions are expected to be quasiperiodic, lying on tori, as one is familiar from integrable Hamiltonian systems. If we impose the boundary condition (1.3) instead of (1.3′) the energy surface is noncompact, as the particles can run to inﬁnity. In fact, we will show, as is intuitively clear, that for any initial conﬁguration mutual distances between all particles grow indeﬁnitely, i. e. xk−1 − xk → ∞ for k = 2, . . . , n; and they behave asymptotically like free particles depending linearly on time. This suggests the scattering problem: To determine the relation between this asymptotic motion for the past and the future. This can be done explicitly here and one ﬁnds that yn−k+1 (+∞) = yk (−∞), so that at t = +∞ the ﬁrst particle has the velocity of the last at t = −∞ etc. as in a familiar experiment of collision of steel balls. Moreover, the phase relation can also be determined explicitly and we will show that log(yj− − yk− )2 , log(yj− − yk− )2 − xn−k+1 (t) − xk (−t) − 2yk− t → jk\n\nyj−\n\n= yj (−∞) are assumed ordered according to size. Thus the particles where behave asymptotically as if they interacted just pairwise! This will be derived in Section 4. In the limit t → +∞, the yk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n, or their symmetric functions, are t-independent integrals of the motion, and one may ask for integrals of the given system which asymptotically agree with these integrals. This is indeed possible, and Henon’s construction of integrals was based on this idea, even though in the periodic case this idea is not really justiﬁed and was only a guiding principle for the construction of integrals. For the noncompact case, i. e. boundary condition (1.3), the free system is indeed the limit state and this approach quite natural. On the other hand, the noncompact case is, of course, much less complicated, as the solutions have no recurrence property and the ﬂow has the nature of parallel ﬂow. In fact, we will show that (1.2) can be mapped into the following system of differential equations, dλk = 0, dt\n\ndrk = − ∂V , dt ∂rk\n\nk = 1, . . . , n,\n\n(1.4)\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n§ 2.

The mapping taking x, y into the variables λk , rk on (1.5) is up to translation of the xk one to one and will be given explicitly. The inverse mapping illustrates the inverse method of spectral theory. Thus this note does not claim any new idea and should be considered as providing a simple model illustrating the construction of integrals and its connection with the inverse method of spectral theory in extreme simplicity, yet with all rigor. On the other hand, it leads immediately to an unsolved problem if one wants to carry out this approach for the periodic boundary condition (1.3′ ). Although the integrals Ik for this problem are well known, no parameters are known on the level surfaces Ik = ck which determine the xk (mod 1), yk uniquely. This is related to the lack of an inverse theory for the Hill’s equation −u′′ + q(x)u = = λu, q(x + 1) = q(x) under periodic boundary conditions u(x + 1) = u(x) where the problem consists in ﬁnding a set of quantities which together with the eigenvalues allow one to determine q(x). One can hope to shed some light on this question if one could solve the above ﬁnite dimensional problem.\n\n§ 2.

It is characterized by the (2n − 1) numbers xk − xn , k = 1, . . . , n − 1, and yk , k = 1, . . . , n. Thus (2.1) deﬁnes an invertible transformation of the (2n − 1)-dimensional space of conﬁgurations into the domain D = a, b | ak > 0, k = 1, . . . , n − 1 , and it remains to study the ﬂow given by the quadratic differential equation (2.2) in D.

L(∞), L(−∞) differ just in the order of the diagonal elements. The physical interpretation of this result is: If for t → −∞ the particles xk approach the velocities yk = −2λk where y1 < y2 < . . . < yn then for t → +∞ the particles xk have the velocities yn−k+1 so that the particles exchange their velocities. This describes the ﬂow for our problem (2.2), (2.3).

The fact that the mapping ϕ has an inverse ϕ−1 : Λ → D corresponds to the inverse method of spectral theory, which in the elementary form described here goes back to Stieltjes [3].

We come to the «inverse problem» which requires that we determine ϕ−1 . With any point in Λ we associate f (λ) by (3.2). Then Im f > 0 for Im λ > 0 and λf (Λ) → 1 for |λ| → ∞. Thus 1 = λ + A − g(λ) f (λ) where A is a real constant and g(λ) is a rational function which satisﬁes Im g(λ) = Im λ +\n\nIm f > 0 for Im λ > 0. |f |2\n\nThus g(λ) has only simple poles on the real axis and their number is n − 1.

These differential equations represent the vector ﬁeld along the gradient of the function V (r) (see (1.4′ )) restricted to the part of the unit sphere lying in the positive quadrant. Thus every solution approaches for t → +∞ the minimum: r(t) → e1 and for t → −∞ the maximum: r(t) → en . Of course, it is also possible to give an analytical representation for the solutions, since they are obtained by projecting the linear differential equations r˙k = −λk rk on the unit sphere.

Solution of the Scattering Problem\n\n31\n\nAs we mentioned in Section 1 the ﬂow is particuarly simple in this case since no periodic or recurrent solutions are present. In the more interesting case of the periodic boundary condition one has quasiperiodic solutions and the task of ﬁnding coordinates for the integral surfaces which are tori, is more difﬁcult. The main problem is the «inverse problem» which consists in recovering L — which is then a cyclic matrix — from its eigenvalues and appropriately chosen quantities. This problem seems unsolved as yet.\n\n§ 4. Solution of the Scattering Problem From the results of Section 2 it follows that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of our problem (1.2′ ) is given by + −δt xk (t) = α+ ), k t + βk + o(e − −δt ) xk (−t) = −α− k t + βk + o(e\n\n(4.1)\n\nfor t → +∞ with some δ > 0.

Our goal is to determine the relation between the phases βk+ , βk− which can be given explicitly too. This remarkable fact is also a consequence of the integrable character of the system and the representation of exk −xk+1 , yk as rational functions of λj , e−λj t given by (3.10), (3.11). An explicit calculation seems prohibitive; nevertheless the following argument, which uses just rudimentary properties of rational functions will lead to the goal. The result is + ϕjk (α− ) (4.3) = βk− + βn−k+1 j =k\n\nwhere ϕjk (α) =\n\n− 2 log(α− j − αk )\n\n− 2 − log(α− j − αk )\n\nfor j < k, for j > k.\n\n(4.4)\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n32\n\nFinitely Many Mass Points on the Line\n\nFor n = 2 this amounts to − 2 β2+ = β1− − log(α− 1 − α2 ) ,\n\n− 2 β1+ = β2− + log(α− 1 − α2 ) .\n\n(4.5)\n\n− Thus ϕjk represents the phase shift between two particles with velocities α− j , αk at t = −∞. The result (4.3) can therefore be interpreted as follows: The particles are scattered just as if their interaction takes place two at a time! This was suggested to me by M. Kruskal who described an analogous phenomenon for solutions of the Korteweg – de Vries equation (see [6], Theorem 3.7) and by P. D. Lax. This phenomenon which had been discovered by Zakharov et al. (see [6] for references) is obviously intimately related to our result and it is conceivable that one can be derived from the other — but we have not pursued this point. We illustrate the statement in Figures 1, 2. Figure 1 illustrates the case n = 2, which is given explicitly in terms of cosh(λ2 − λ1 )t. The asymptotic behavior can be interpreted as the elastic reﬂection of two rods of length − 2 ϕ21 = log(α− 2 − α1 ) , provided this number is positive. For negative values of ϕ21 the particles reﬂect only after passing each other. However, this interpretation is somewhat misleading, especially if n > 2, since the length of the rods depends on their velocity, not on the label.

For n + 1 particles we denote the corresponding 2\n\n− α), α = (α− function by ψk ( 1 , . . . , αn+1 ).

Thus it sufﬁces to prove (4.14). Since both sides are independent of the βj− we may, − and will, choose βn+1 very large positive, so that the n particles x1 , x2 , . . . , xn have already undergone their mutual interaction and are very far apart by the time xn+1 interacts with any of them. In other words, when xn+1 (t) exerts some force on x1 , . . . , xn there are already close to + xk ∼ α+ k t + βk ,\n\n− where βk+ = βn−k+1 + Φn−k+1\n\nand t is large positive. Thus the interaction of xn+1 with xk (t), k n takes essentially place pairwise.

One may show, which we will not do here, that these integrals are in involution, i. e. the Poisson bracket for any two of these vanishes. Using the integrals as new Hamiltonians one can introduce n new vector ﬁelds which possess the same integrals and commute with each other. This makes the manifolds Ik = const into commutative groups. These are well known facts for integrable Hamiltonian systems (see, for example, Appendix 26 of [7]) which we will verify here directly. As a starting point we take the differential equation (2.7) which represents a deformation of the Jacobi matrix L leaving the spectrum ﬁxed. But there are many such isospectral deformations corresponding to different choices of B. We restrict ourselves to skew symmetric matrices B giving rise to orthogonal similarity transformations. But instead of permitting only one pair of off diagonals we allow several. Let Bp stand for a skew symmetric matrix with p off diagonals above and adjacent to the diagonal. Thus the matrix B deﬁned below (2.7) would be denoted by B1 . We claim that for every p in 1 p < n we can ﬁnd nontrivial matrices Bp such that L˙ = Bp L − LBp deﬁnes a meaningful differential equation, that is that the commutator Bp L − LBp has only one off diagonal above the diagonal, while the others all vanish.

Thus the solutions of (5.2) can be expressed as rational functions of λk 2 and e−λk t and the asymptotic behavior of its solutions is also completely understood from the results of the previous sections.

Introduction (a) Background. In the early stages of classical mechanics it was the ultimate goal to integrate the differential equations of motions explicitly or by quadrature. This led to the discovery of various «integrable» systems, such as Euler’s two ﬁxed center problems, Jacobi’s integration of the geodesics on a three-axial ellipsoid, S. Kovalevski’s motion of the top under gravity for special ratios of the principal moments of inertia, to name a few nontrivial examples. These efforts and their climax with the work of Jacobi who applied skillfully the method of separation of variables to partial differential equations, the Hamilton – Jacobi equations associated with the mechanical system, to establish their integrable character. However, this development took a sharp turn when Poincar´e showed that most Hamiltonian systems are not integrable and gave arguments indicating the nonintegrability of the three-body problem. In the same negative direction lies Brun’s discovery that the three-body problem has no algebraic integral except for the well-known classical ones and algebraic functions of these. These results express, in other words, that integrability of Hamiltonian systems is not a generic property; it is destroyed under small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Therefore it seems an anachronismus to discuss these exceptional integrable systems nowadays. However, in recent years various phenomena were discovered which are clearly intimately related to integrable Hamiltonian systems yet they have very different origin. One is related to the discovery by Kruskal and others [6] of so-called solitons for the Korteweg – de Vries equation. These are wave solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation having a strong stability behavior. Originally these phenomena were brought to light by numerical 1 Adv.\n\nMath., v. 16 (1975) 197–220.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n46\n\nThree Integrable Hamiltonian Systems\n\nexperiments and later on related to the existence of inﬁnitely many conservation laws that restrict the evolution of the solutions severely. If one interprets the partial differential equation, in this case the Korteweg – de Vries equation, as a Hamiltonian system in an inﬁnite-dimensional function space, with a certain symplectic structure, and the conservation laws as integrals of this system, one can view this as an example of an integrable system of inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. This was made precise in the work of Zakharov and Faddeev [15]. In an entirely unrelated development Calogero [2, 3] found that the quantum theoretical problem of n mass points on the line interacting under the inﬂuence of a potential proportional to the inverse square of the distance can be solved explicitly, and he conjectured that the corresponding classical problem might be integrable. This was established by Marchioro for the «three-body problem» by explicit calculation. Moreover, Calogero used his formula to study the scattering problem associated with the n-particle system in the quantum theoretical framework and found that the scattering is essentially trivial, in the sense that the particles behave asymptotically like elastically reﬂected mass points. (b) Results. It is our goal to show a close algebraic connection between these so different problems. However, instead of studying the inﬁnite dimensional problems related to the partial differential equation in the one and the quantum theoretical framework in the other case, we will restrict ourselves to ﬁnite-dimensional systems. The Korteweg – de Vries equation can be discretized so as to retain the desired integrability, as was shown by Toda [13] and his collaborators. Another discretization leads to the differential equations duk = 1 (euk+1 − euk−1 ) (k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) 2 dt\n\n(1.1)\n\n(where we set formally eu0 = 0, eun = 0) suggested by M. Kac and P. v. Moerbeke [8, 9]. Although this system does not have the appearance of a Hamiltonian system, it can be embedded into one, as was shown in [12]. The remarkable fact is that there are [n/2] = ν polynomials Pµ of uk , euk which are integrals of the motion, i. e., dPµ /dt = 0 (µ = 1, 2, . . . , ν) if one inserts a solution of the above differential equations. Moreover, all solutions can be expressed in the form euk = Rk (η)\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n§ 1.

Instead of Calogero’s quantum theoretical problem we look at the corresponding classical one, described by the equations d2 xk = − ∂U , ∂xk dt2 where U=\n\n(k = 1, 2, . . . , n)\n\n(xk − xl )−2 ,\n\nk, l = 1, 2, . . . , n,\n\n(1.2)\n\nk yn (+∞).\n\n(4.4)\n\n1 (¨ xn − x (xj − x1 )−3 > 0 (xn − xj )−3 + ¨1 ) = 2\n\n(4.4′ )\n\nt→∞\n\nexists and that From\n\nj1\n\nand the boundedness of x˙ k we conclude, by integration that +∞ (xk − xl )−3 dt < ∞ for k > l = 1 and for l < k = n.\n\n(4.5)\n\n−∞ 1 Note\n\nadded in proof.

This, in turn implies from (3.2) that the limits lim x˙ k (±t) exist, proving (4.3). Because t→∞ of the ordering of the particles we have obviously x˙ 1 (+∞) x˙ 2 (+∞) . . . x˙ n (+∞), x˙ 1 (−∞) x˙ 2 (−∞) . . . x˙ n (−∞).\n\n(4.6)\n\nTo prove (4.4) we proceed as follows: Consider ﬁrst ϕ(t) = xn − x1 > 0 which, by (4.4′), satisﬁes 1 ϕ¨ 2(x − x )−3 > 0. n 1 2\n\n(4.7)\n\nThus ϕ˙ is monotone increasing and ϕ(+∞) ˙ 0, by (4.6). Were ϕ(+∞) ˙ =0 then ϕ(t) ˙ < 0 and thus ϕ bounded. But then the righthand side of (4.7) would be bounded away from zero, hence ϕ unbounded. This contradiction shows that x˙ 1 (+∞) < x˙ n (+∞). Thus, in the ﬁrst row of (4.6) we do not have equality in all places, i. e., there exists an s with (4.8) x˙ s (+∞) < x˙ s+1 (+∞). From this we will show now x˙ 1 (+∞) < x˙ s (+∞) and x˙ s+1 (+∞) < x˙ n (+∞) which implies readily that all velocity are different. It sufﬁces to show x˙ 1 (+∞) < x˙ s (+∞), the other case being symmetric to it. From (4.8) we conclude that xj − xs = O(t−1 ) for j > s and therefore 1 d2 (x − x ) = (x − x )−3 − O(t−3 ) + (x − x )−3 j 1 s j 1 2 dt2 s j>1\n\nj t0\n\n˙ and is bounded from below. Thus ψ˙ is increasing and ψ(+∞) 0. As before ˙ we conclude that the assumption ψ(∞) = 0 leads to a contradiction.

The Periodic Case — Sutherland’s Equation\n\n57\n\n˙ be bounded away from zero, and so ψ unbounded. Thus ψ(∞) > 0 as we wanted to show. Since yk = −x˙ k we have established (4.4). This implies obviously (xk − xl )−1 = O(t−1 )\n\nfor t → +∞,\n\nk = l\n\nso that we can see that the matrix L(t) has a limit L(∞) which is a diagonal matrix. Since the eigenvalues λk of L(t) are independent of t we have yk (∞) = λk if we make the convention to order these like λn < λn−1 < . . . < λ1 . for t → −∞ the matrix L also approaches a diagonal matrix with the same eigenvalues in the diagonal, but, because of (4.6) in reversed order. Thus x˙ k (+∞) = −yk (+∞) = −λk ;\n\nx˙ n+1−k (−∞) = −yn+1−k (−∞) = −λk ,\n\nand (4.1) is proven. Finally, we observe that the integrals Ik = Ik (x, y) (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) are in involution. For xk − xk−1 → ∞ these integrals Ik converge with their derivatives to σk (y), the symmetric functions of y. Thus the Poisson bracket Gkl =\n\nn ∂(Ik , Il ) = {Ik , Il } ∂(xr , yr ) r=1\n\nconverges to {σk , σl } = 0. Thus, along any solution of our system Gkl → 0 as t → ∞. On the other hand, as is well known, Gkl are integrals themselves, hence Gkl = 0 for all x, y.\n\n§ 5.

Thus the energy surface is compact and most solutions of (5.2) turn out to be quasi-periodic. This will be a consequence of well known facts [1] about integrable Hamiltonian systems if we show that (5.2) has n independent integrals which are in involution. The construction of these integrals follows the pattern of Section 3.

Thus it follows that the coefﬁcients I1 , I2 , . . . , In det(λI − L) = λn + I1 λn−1 + · · · + In are independent integrals of the motion. We will not verify here that they are involution1, but observe that they are rational functions of yk and eiα(xk −xl ) . To verify (5.5) one has to use the addition theorem for cot x which gives, for k, l, r distinct modulo n: zkl =\n\nzkr zrl − α2 zkr + zrl\n\nhence, for k = l (mod n) 2\n\nPkl, r = zkr zrl − α − (zkr + zrl )zkl = 1 This\n\n0 −\n\n2 zkl\n\n2\n\n−α\n\nif r = k, l(n)\n\nif r = k, l(n).\n\ncould be done by replacing α by iα and using the same argument as in the previous section.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n60\n\nThree Integrable Hamiltonian Systems\n\nThis implies for 2 2 2 2 Qkl, r = (zkr − zrl )Pkl, r = −zkr (zrl + α2 ) + zrl (zkr + α2 ) − (zkr − zrl )zkl\n\nthat\n\nQkl, r =\n\nr\n\n⎧ ⎨0\n\n⎩ −2\n\n2 (zkr + α2 )zkr\n\nr\n\nso that the matrix with the elements\n\nr\n\nif k = l (mod n) if k = l (mod n)\n\nQkl, r agrees with the diagonal ma-\n\ntrix −2D3 .

From this identity one reads off that (5.5) agrees with the equation (5.3). This makes the statement about the Ik being integrals of the motion again obvious.\n\n§ 6. Rational Character of the Solution of (2.4) We return to the equations (2.4) or (2.5) and investigate their solutions using the fact that these differential equations describe isospectral deformation of Jacobi matrices. We begin with introducing a set of variables rk on the manifold of Jacobi matrices (2.1) for which the spectrum is ﬁxed. This is the analog of the inverse spectrum problem. Let R(λ) = (λI − L)−1 and e1 be the vector with components (1, 0, . . . , 0). We introduce the rational function f (λ) = (R(λ)e1 , e1 ) which has simple poles at λ = λk with a positive residue which we denote by rk2 , so that n rk2 . f (λ) = λ − λk k=1\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n61\n\n§ 6. Rational Character of the Solution of (2.4)\n\nOn account of the symmetry property K −1 LK = −L derived in Section 2, f (λ) is an odd function of λ. Thus, if we order the (always distinct) eigenvalues by λn > λn−1 > . . . > λ1\n\n(6.1)\n\nwe conclude that λk = −λn−k+1 ;\n\nrk = rn−k+1\n\nand f (λ) can be represented by f (λ) =\n\nν 2λrk2\n\nk=1\n\nλ2 − λ2k\n\n+ κn\n\n2 rν+1 λ\n\nwhere κn = 1 for n odd, κn = 0 if n is even and ν = [n/2]. Since f (λ) ∼ λ−1 for |λ| → ∞ we have n\n\nrk2 = 1.\n\nk=1\n\nand we prefer to free ourselves from the latter restriction by using the rk as projective coordinates.

In fact, the squares a2k (k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) of the elements in (2.1) can be expressed rationally in terms of those rj , λj , 1 j ν and rν+1 if n is odd.

Since the computation of the continued fraction from the partial fraction expression is a rational process one ﬁnds that a2k = Rk (r, λ) (6.4) where the Rk are rational functions, homogeneous of degree zero in the rj and homogeneous of degree two in λ. Moreover, (6.4) can be viewed as mapping which takes the domain D = {(λ, r), λ1 > λ2 > . . . > λν 0; rj > 0 (j = 1, 2, . . . , n − ν)} into the domain onto = {aj > 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1} D\n\nin such a way that the pre-image of each point is precisely one ray (ρr, λ) with a scalar ρ > 0.

To prove this assertion we introduce the eigenvectors ϕ(λj ) of L which we normalize by (6.6) ϕ1 (λj ) = (e1 , ϕ(λj )) > 0; |ϕ(λj )| = 1. If L is a solution of (2.3) these eigenvectors become functions of which evolve according to ϕ(λj , t) = U (t)ϕ(λj , 0), where U (t) is the unitary matrix of Section 2. Thus the eigenvectors satisfy the differential equation dϕ(λj , t) = −Bϕ(λj , t). dt We compute the resulting differential equation for the ﬁrst component ϕ1 = = (e1 , ϕ) ϕ˙ 1 = −a1 a2 ϕ3\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n§ 6.

We will show that any solution of (7.2) behaves linearly for large t: ± xk (±t) ∼ ±α± k t + βk\n\nas t → ∞\n\nwhere + − − α+ 2j = α2j−1 = αn−2j+2 = αn−2j+1 ,\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , ν,\n\n(7.3)\n\ni. e., the particles travel asymptotically in pairs, while the different pairs have negative and different velocities, in fact, it turns out 2 α+ 2j = −2λj ,\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , ν,\n\n(7.3′ )\n\nwhere the λ1 > λ2 > . . . are the eigenvalues of L.

The Scattering Problem\n\nThus the particles undergo a scattering in which the pairs behave as if they interacted pairwise at a time. The results (7.3), (7.3′ ), (7.4) are easily derived and we begin with their proof. We recall the differential equation (2.4) a˙ k = ak (a2k+1 − a2k−1 ),\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1\n\nwith a0 = 0 = an from which we see that n−1\n\na2k = const\n\nk=1\n\nalong solutions. Thus ak are bounded. Since d log(a a · · · a 2 1 3 2j−1 ) = a2j dt we conclude that\n\n∞ 0\n\na22j dt < ∞.\n\nSince a˙ 2j is bounded this implies that a2j (t) → 0\n\nas t → +∞.\n\n(7.6)\n\nThus, the Jacobi matrix L(t), given by (2.1), is asymptotic to a matrix blocked into two by two matrices with eigenvalues ±a2j−1 (t), j = 1, 2, . . . , ν. Since, on the other hand the eigenvalues λk are distinct and independent of t it follows that the limits a2j−1 (t) → a2j−1 (∞) exist and agree with these eigenvalues in some order. From the differential equations a˙ 2j 2 2 a2j = a2j+1 − a2j−1 and from (7.6) it follows that a22j+1 (∞) < a22j−1 (∞) and thus, if we order the eigenvalues λk of L according to (6.1) we conclude a2j−1 (t) → λj ,\n\n(j = 1, 2, . . . , ν).\n\n(7.7)\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n66\n\nThree Integrable Hamiltonian Systems\n\nUsing the relation 4a2k = euk = exk −xk+1\n\n(7.8)\n\nwe conclude from (7.1), (7.2), (7.7), (7.8) that x˙ 2j (+∞) = x˙ 2j−1 (+∞) = −2λ2j proving (7.3′ ) and the ﬁrst part of (7.3). The other part follows by considering the asymptotic behavior for t → −∞ analogously. Moreover, (7.7) and (7.8) implies that x2j−1 − x2j → log(4λ2j )\n\nfor t → +∞\n\nproving the ﬁrst part of (7.4). The second follows similarly. It remains to prove (7.5). This will be done by relating the ﬁrst order differential equations (7.2) to a second order system related to the Toda lattice, for which the scattering problem has been solved [12]. We notice that differentiation of (7.2) yields x˙ k = − 1 (euk u˙ k + euk−1 u˙ k−1 ) = 2 1 = − {euk (euk+1 − euk−1 ) + euk−1 (euk − euk−2 )} = 4 1 = − (exk −xk+2 − exk−2 −xk ) 4 where we set the undeﬁned exponential terms equal to zero. Thus with ξj = x2j ;\n\nτ = t/2\n\n(7.9)\n\nwe have d2 ξj dτ 2\n\n= eξj−1 −ξj − eξj −ξj+1 = ∂U , ∂ξj\n\nwhere U=\n\nν−1\n\n(j = 1, 2, . . . , ν)\n\n(7.10)\n\neξj −ξj+1 .\n\nj=1\n\nThis Hamiltonian system has already been established as an integrable one [13]. For the scattering one has again ′ ξj′ (+∞) = ξν+1−j (−∞),\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , ν\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n67\n\nReferences\n\nwhich is consistent with (7.3) as ξj′ (±∞) = 2α± 2j , and ξj (τ ) − ξν+1−j (−τ ) − 2γj τ →\n\nδkj\n\n(7.11)\n\nk=j\n\nwhere γj = ξ ′ (+∞) = 2α+ 2j ;\n\nδkj =\n\nlog(γk − γj )2, k > j\n\n− log(γk − γj )2, k < j.\n\nWith (7.9) the relation (7.11) translates readily into the statement (7.5). We conclude with a comment on the relation between the differential equation (2.5) by Kac and v. Moerbeke and the equations (7.10) for the Toda lattice. The ﬁrst one corresponds to an isospectral deformation the Jacobi matrix L given by (2.1), with zeros in the diagonal, while the second-order differential equation corresponds to such deformations of such Jacobi matrices with arbitrary diagonal elements (see [4, 12]). To establish the connection between the two we form L2 which is not any more a tridiagonal matrix, but is similar to one. In fact, with eα (α = 1, 2, . . . , n) denoting the unit vectors, one ﬁnds that L2 leaves the spaces E1 = span{e1 , e3 , . . . , en−1 } and E2 = span{e2 , e4 , . . . , en } invariant and reduces in each of these spaces to a symmetric Jacobi matrix. This explains why 2 the solutions of (2.4) are rationally expressible in terms of e−λj t while solutions of the corresponding equations for the Toda lattice are rational in e−λj t . This illustrates in a simple example how the operation L → L2 and more generally L → f (L) plays a role in these problems.\n\nReferences [1] V. I.

Integrable Hamiltonian Systems a) In these informal lecture notes we discuss a number of integrable Hamiltonian systems which have surfaced recently in very different connections. It is our goal to discuss various aspects underlying the integrability of a system like that of group representation, isospectral deformation and geometrical considerations. Since this subject is still far from being understood or being systematic we discuss a number of examples which are seemingly disconnected. In fact, there are some rather unexpected connections like between the inverse square potential of Calogero (Section 4) and the Korteweg de Vries equation. Here we show a surprising new connection between the geodesics on an ellipsoid and Hill’s equation with ﬁnite gap potential. b) form\n\nThe differential equations of mechanics can be written in Hamiltonian y˙ k = − ∂H ∂xk\n\nx˙ k = ∂H , ∂yk\n\n(k = 1, 2, . . . , n)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn , y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) ∈ Rn , are coordinates in the phase space R2n or an open subset of R2n .

In particular, H is an integral. If F is an integral of XH then H is an integral of XF . A set of functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fr are said to be «in involution» or to commute, if {Fk , Fj } = 0 for k, j = 1, 2, . . . , r. This implies clearly that the vector ﬁelds XFk commute. If ϕ = ϕ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξr ), ψ = ψ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξr ) then {ϕ(F1 , . . . , Fr ), ψ(F1 , . . . , Fr )} =\n\n∂ϕ ∂ψ {Fk , Fj }. ∂ξk ∂ξj k, j\n\nThus, if F1 , . . . , Fr are in involution, so are any functions of F1 , . . . , Fr . Definition 1. A Hamiltonian system (1), deﬁned in an open domain D ⊂ R2n is called «integrable» if there exist n integrals F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn in involution with linearly independent gradients, i. e. in D we have (i) {H, Fj } = 0; (ii) {Fk , Fj } = 0, (iii) dF1 , . . . , dFn linearly independent. n αk (x2k + yk2 ) deﬁnes an integrable system in R2n EXAMPLE 1. H = 1 2\n\nk=1\n\nwith Fk = x2k + yk2 (k = 1, 2, . . . , n).\n\nEXAMPLE 2. If H = H(y) is independent of x then the system is integrable with Fk = yk . Locally, that is near any point where dH = 0 any system is integrable; in fact, in appropriate canonical coordinates H agrees with y1 which is a special case of Example 2. Generally it makes sense to speak of a system being integrable in a domain which is invariant under the ﬂow generated by XH . It is highly exceptional for a Hamiltonian system to be integrable globally in an invariant open domain — or even locally near a stationary point (where dH = = 0). However many systems occurring in application are closely approximated by integrable systems. For example, the n-body problem becomes integrable in the limit when all but one mass tends to zero. The resulting system is a decoupled system of Kepler problems.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n§ 1. Integrable Hamiltonian Systems\n\n71\n\nAnother example is a system near a stationary point, say x = y = 0 where dH(0) = 0. Assume that the Taylor expansion of H begins with n\n\nH= 1 αk (x2k + yk2 ) + · · · 2 k=1\n\nwith real numbers α1 , α2 , . . . , αn . By a theorem of G. D. Birkhoff one can approximate this system locally by an integrable one (see [3], [4]): Given any large integer N , assume that j1 α1 + · · · + jn αn = 0, |j1 | + |j2 | + · · · + |jn | N , jk integers implies that j1 = j2 = . . . = jn = 0; then there exist canonical variables x∗1 , . . . , x∗n , y1∗ , . . . , yn∗ such that H = ϕ(F1 , . . . , Fn ) + RN +1 where RN +1 vanishes with derivatives of order N at the origin and Fj = = x∗j 2 + yj∗ 2 . Thus if we drop the term RN +1 the system is integrable. (To be precise, one has to excise the hyperplanes x∗k = yk∗ = 0 where the dFj are linearly dependent.) On the other hand one can show that in general, even if the α1 , α2 , . . . , αn are rationally independent the system is not integrable in any neighborhood of the origin. c) The structure of the integrable system is particularly simple. Given the integrals one considers the manifolds Nn deﬁned by F1 = c1 , . . . , Fn = cn with appropriate constants c1 , . . . , cn . These manifolds are invariant not only under XH (because of (i) of deﬁnition 1) but also under XFj (because of (ii)). Thus XF1 , XF2 , . . . , XFn span the tangent space of Nn . Since these vector ﬁelds commute each component of Nn is topologically a cylinder — and in case it is compact, a torus. Thus in the latter case D is foliated by n-dimensional tori. By a theorem due to Arnold [1], [2] and Jost one can near a compact component of Nn introduce canonical coordinates, called x, y again, such that H = H(y1 , . . . , yn ), that y = 0 corresponds to Nn and that points (x, y), ( x, y) with the integer (xj − x j )(2π)−1 correspond to the same points in D. The yk , xk are called the «action-angle» variables, respectively. In other words, the example 2 is typical. In Example 1 these tori are given by x2k + yk2 = ck if the ck are positive. The ﬂows generated by the commuting XF1 , . . . , XFn are the n rotations in the xk , yk plane.\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n72\n\nVarious Aspects of Integrable Hamiltonian Systems\n\nIn action-angle variables the differential equations become x˙ k = Hyk (y),\n\ny˙ k = 0.\n\nThus the differential equations are linear on Nn . If the frequencies Hy1 , . . . , Hyn are rationally independent then the orbits are dense on Nn . If one solution on Nn is periodic then all are. This occurs if and only if Hyk /jk = ρ is independent of k with some integers j1 , j2 , . . . , jn . Thus for an integrable system the periodic solutions form (n − 1) dimensional families. The proof that Hamiltonian systems generally are not integrable is based on the fact that generically the periodic solutions on a ﬁxed energy surface are isolated.\n\nReferences [1] V. I.

Examples of Integrable Systems, Isospectral Deformations In spite of their exceptional character a number of integrable Hamiltonian systems have been discovered recently for which the underlying symmetries are highly unexpected. The most interesting ones are given by partial differential equations and hence of inﬁnite degrees of freedom. For lack of space they will not be discussed here, but some of the following systems can be viewed as discretized versions of those of inﬁnite degrees of freedom. a) Toda lattice.

This fact was discovered by Henon and then by Flaschka. The solutions of this system can be expressed in rational form: exk are rational functions of eλ1 t , . . . , eλn t with some distinct constants λk . The original Toda lattice refers to inﬁnitely many particles, but we will restrict ourselves to n < ∞ (see [1]–[4]). b) The inverse square potential of Calogero is also given by (1) but (2) is replaced by U= (xk − xl )−2 . k 0. Then it follows from x2 y3 − x3 y2 = 0 x3 y1 − x1 y3 = 0\n\nthat x3 = y3 = 0 and the problem is reduced to one in R2 × R2 , where we have the quadric x1 y2 −x2 y1 = λ. This problem is still rotation invariant under SO(2) and we may use polar coordinates r, ϕ and conjugate variables pr , pϕ .

Then pr = Wr , pϕ = Wϕ gives pϕ y1 = pr cos ϕ − r sin ϕ pϕ y2 = pr sin ϕ + r cos ϕ and x1 y2 − x2 y1 = λ. Thus pϕ is the integral and H independent of ϕ.

Eliminating the integrals of the center of mass and the angular momentum one can reduce this system of 9 degrees of freedom to one of 4 degrees of freedom, i. e. reduce the phase-space from 18 dimensions to 8 dimensions. Using, in addition, the conservation of energy one has a vector ﬁeld on a seven dimensional manifold. b) The moment map. We describe the generalization of this reduction in abstract form. We consider a manifold M with a one-form θ for which ω = dθ is nondegenerate, so that (M, ω) is a symplectic manifold. One sometimes refers to (M, θ) as an «exact symplectic» manifold. An example is the cotangent bundle M = T ∗ N of a manifold N with the natural 1-form. If G is a Lie group we speak of a symplectic group action (ϕg ) if for every g ∈ G there exists a diffeomorphism ϕg : M → M such that ϕg ◦ ϕh = ϕgh for g, h ∈ G, ϕe = Id, and ϕg is symplectic, i. e. ϕ∗g ω = ω. If, moreover, ϕ∗g θ = θ we speak of an exact symplectic group action. For G = R this concept is the same as that of symplectic ﬂow. Every such ﬂow is generated by a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, say X for which X ω is closed. We will assume that this one form is even exact and set X ω = dF,\n\nC o p y rig h t ОАО « ЦКБ « БИБКОМ» & ООО « A ге н тствоK н ига- C е рвис»\n\n§ 3.
