        "text": "Beware!\n\nIf you love books, don’t read this post. Close the tab and look away from the second burning of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nIf you love books, then run to your favorite library (if it is still there), and take out every book you have ever thought of. Fill your rooms and offices with checked-out books, the older the better, and never, ever, return them. Keep clicking on RENEW, for as long as they let you.\n\nThe librarians had paved paradise and put up a parking lot.\n\nIf you love books, the kind of rare valueless books on topics only you care about, then Librarians—the former Jedi gatekeepers of knowledge—have turned to the dark side, deaccessioning the unpopular books in the stacks, pulling their loan cards like tomb stones, shipping the books away in unmarked boxes like body bags to large warehouses to be sold for pennies—and you may never see them again.\n\nThe End of Physics\n\nJust a few years ago my university, with little warning and no consultation with the physics faculty, closed the heart and soul of the Physics Department—our Physics Library. It was a bright warm space where we met colleagues, quietly discussing deep theories, a place to escape for a minute or two, or for an hour, to browse a book picked from the shelf of new acquisitions—always something unexpected you would never think to search for online. But that wasn’t the best part.\n\nThe best part was the three floors above, filled with dark and dusty stacks that seemed to rise higher than the building itself. This was where you found the gems—books so old or so arcane that when you pulled them from the shelf to peer inside, they sent you back, like a time machine, to an era when physicists thought differently—not wrong, but differently. And your understanding of your own physics was changed, seen with a longer lens, showing you things that went deeper than you expected, and you emerged from the stacks a changed person.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nThey didn’t even need the space. At a university where space is always in high demand, and turf wars erupt between departments who try to steal space in each other’s buildings, the dark cavernous rooms of the ex-physics library stood empty for years as the powers at be tried to figure out what to do with it.\n\nSo, I determined to try to understand how a room that stood empty would be more valuable to a university than a room full of books. What I discovered was at the same time both mundane and shocking. Mundane, because it delves into the rules and regulations that govern how universities function. Shocking, because it is a betrayal of the very mission of universities and university libraries.\n\nHow to Get Accreditation Without Really Trying\n\nLittle strikes fear in the heart of a college administrator like the threat of losing accreditation. Accreditation is the stamp of approval that drives sales—sales of slots in the freshman incoming class. Without accreditation, a college is nothing more than a bunch of buildings housing over-educated educators. But with accreditation, the college has a mandate to educate and has the moral authority to mold the minds of the next generation.\n\nIn times past—not too long past—let’s say up to the end of the last millennium, to receive accreditation, a college or university would need to spend something around 3% of its operating budget on the upkeep of its libraries. For a moderate-sized university library system, this was on the order of $20M per year. The requirement was a boon to the librarians who kept a constant lookout for new books to buy to populate the beloved “new acquisitions” shelf.\n\nLibrarians reveled in their leverage over the university administrators: buy books or lose accreditation. It was a powerful negotiating position to be in. But all that changed in the early 2000’s. Universities are always strapped for cash (despite tuition increases rising at two-times the rate of inflation) and the librarian’s $20M cash cow was a tempting target. Universities are also powerful, running their billion-dollar-a-year operations, and they lobbied the very organizations that give the accreditations, convincing them to remove the requirement for the minimum library budget. After all, in the digital world, who needs expensive buildings filled with books, the vast majority of which never get checked out?\n\nThe Deaccessioning Wars: Double Fold\n\nTwenty some years ago, a bibliovisionary by the name of Nicholson Baker recognized the book armegeddon of his age and wrote about it in Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper (Vintage Books/Random House, 2001). Libraries everywhere were in the midst of an orgy of deaccessioning. To deaccession a book means to remove it from the card catalog (an anachronism) and ship it off to second-hand book dealers. But it was worse than that. Many of the books, as well as rare journals and rarer newspapers, were being “guillotined” by cutting out each page and scanning it into some kind of visual/digital format before pitching all the pages into the recycle bin. The argument in favor of guillotining is that all paper must eventually decay to dust (a false assumption).\n\nThe way to test whether a book, or a newspaper, is on its way to dissolution is to do the double fold test on a corner of a page. You fold the corner over then back the other way—double fold—and repeat. The double-fold number of a book is how many double folds it takes for the little triangular piece to fall off. Any number less than a selected threshold gives a librarian carte blanch to deaccession the book, and maybe to guillotine it, regardless of how the book may be valued.\n\nLibrarians generally hate Baker’s little book Double Fold because deaccessioning is always a battle. Given finite shelf space, for every new acquisition, something old needs to go. How do you choose? Any given item might be valued by someone, so an objective test that removes all shades of gray is the double-fold. It is a blunt instrument, one that Nicholas Baker abhorred, but it does make room for the new—if that is all that a university library is for.\n\nAs an aside, as I write this blog, my university library, which does not own a copy of Double Fold, and through which I had to request a copy via Interlibrary Loan (ILL), is threatening me with punitive action if I don’t relinquish it because it is a few weeks overdue. If my library had actually owned a copy, I could have taken it out and kept it on my office shelf for years, as long as I kept hitting that “renew” button on the library page. (On the other hand, my university does own a book by the archivist Cox who wrote a poorly argued screed to try to refute Baker.)\n\nThe End of Deep Knowledge\n\nBaker is already twenty years out of date, although his message is more dire now than ever. In his day, deaccessioning was driven by that problem of finite shelf space—one book out for one book in. Today, when virtually all new acquisitions are digital, that argument is moot. Yet the current rate at which books are disappearing from libraries, and libraries themselves are disappearing from campuses, is nothing short of cataclysmic, dwarfing the little double-fold problem that Baker originally railed against.\n\nMy university used to have a dozen specialized libraries scattered across campus, with the Physics Library one of them. Now there are maybe three in total. One of those is the Main Library which was an imposing space filled with the broadest range of topics and a truly impressive depth of coverage. You could stand in front of any stack and find beautifully produced volumes (with high-quality paper that would never fail the double fold test) on beautifully detailed topics, going as deep as you could wish to the very foundations of knowledge.\n\nI am a writer of the history of science and technology, and as I write, I often will form a very specific question about how a new idea emerged. What was its context? How did it break free of old mindsets? Why was it just one individual who saw the path forward? What made them special?\n\nMy old practice was to look up a few books in the library catalog that may or may not have the kinds of answers I was looking for, then walk briskly across campus to the associated library (great for exercise and getting a break from my computer). I would scan across the call numbers on the spines of the books until I found the book I sought—and then I would step back and look at the whole stack.\n\nWithout fail, I would find gems I never knew existed, sometimes three, four or five shelves away from the book I first sought. They were often on topics I never would have searched online. And to find those gems, I would take down book after book, scanning them quickly before returning them to the shelf (yes, I know, re-shelving is a no-no, but the whole stack would be emptied if I followed the rules) and moving to the next—something you could never do online. In ten minutes, or maybe half an hour if I lost track of time, I would have three or four books crucial to my argument in the crook of my arm, ready to walk down the stairs to circulation to take them out. Often, the book that launched my search was not even among them.\n\nI thought that certainly this main library was safe, and I was looking forward to years ahead of me, even past retirement, buried in its stacks, sleuthing out the mysteries of the evolution of knowledge.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nNot the building or the space—they were still there. But the rows upon rows of stacks had been replaced with study space that students didn’t even need. Once again, empty space was somehow more valuable to the library than having that space filled with books. The librarians had paved paradise and put up a parking lot. To me, it was like a death in the family.\n\nWhy not bulldoze Williamsburg, Virginia, after digital capture? Why not burn the USS Constitution in Boston Bay after photographing it? Why not flatten the Alamo?\n\nI recently looked up a book that was luckily still available at the Main Library in one of its few remaining stacks. So I went to find it. The shelves all around it were only about two-thirds filled, the wide gaps looking like abandoned store-fronts in a failing city. And what books did remain were the superficial ones—the ones that any undergrad might want to take out to get an overview of some well-worn topic (which they could probably just get on Wikipedia). All the deep knowledge (which Wikipedia will never see) was gone.\n\nI walked out with exactly the one book I had gone to find—not a single surprising gem to accompany it. But the worst part is the opportunity cost: I will never know what I had failed to discover!\n\nShrinking Budgets and Predatory Publishers\n\nSo why is a room that stands empty more valuable to a university than a room full of books? Here are the mundane and shocking answers.\n\nOn the one hand, library budgets are under assault. The following figure shows library expenditures as a percentage of total university expenditures averaged for 40 major university libraries tabulated by the ARL (Association of Research Libraries) from 1982 to 2017. There is an exponential decrease in the library budget as a function of year, with a break right around 2000-2001 when accreditation was no longer linked to library expenditures. Then the decay accelerated.\n\nCombine decreasing rates of library funding with predatory publishers, and the problem is compounded. The following figure shows the increasing price of journal subscriptions that universities must pay relative to the normal inflation rate. The journal publishers are increasing their prices exponentially, tripling the cost each decade, a rate that erodes library budgets even more. Therefore, it is tempting to say that librarians don’t actually hate books, but are victims of bad economics. But that is the mundane answer.\n\nThe shocking answer is that modern librarians find books to be anachronistic. The new hires are by and large “digital librarians” who are focused on providing digital content to serve students who have become much more digital, especially after Covid. There is also a prevailing opinion among university librarians that students want more space to study, hence the removal of stacks to be replaced by soft chairs and open study spaces.\n\nAnd that is the betrayal. The collections of deep knowledge, which are unique and priceless and irreplaceable, were replaced by generic study space that could be put anywhere at any time, having no intrinsic value.\n\nYou can argue that I still have access to the knowledge because of Interlibrary Loan (ILL). But ILL only works if other libraries have yet to remove the book. What happens when every library thinks that some other library has the book, and so they throw their own copy out? At some point that volume will have vanished from all collections and that will be the end of it.\n\nOr you can argue that I can find the book digitally scanned on Internet Archive or Google Books. But I have already found situations where special folio pages, the very pages that I needed to make my argument, had failed to be reproduced in the digital versions. And the books were too rare to be allowed to go through ILL. So I was stuck.\n\n(By the way, this was a rare copy of the works of Francois Arago. In my book Interference: Optical Interferometry and the Scientists who Tamed Light (Oxford University Press, 2023), I make the case that it was Arago who invented the first interferometer in 1816 long before Albert Michelson’s work in 1880. But for the final smoking gun, to prove my case, I needed that folio page which took Herculean efforts to eventually track down. Our Physics Library had the book in its stacks just a decade ago, and I could have just walked upstairs from my office to look at it. Where it is now is anyone’s guess.)\n\nBut digital scans are no substitute for the real thing. To hold an old volume in your hands, run off the printing press when the author was still alive, and filled with scribbled notes in the margins by your colleagues from years past, is to commune with history. Why not bulldoze Williamsburg, Virginia, after digital capture? Why not burn the USS Constitution in Boston Bay after photographing it? Why not flatten the Alamo? When you immerse yourself in these historical settings, you gain an understanding that is deeper than possible by browsing an article on Wikipedia.\n\nPeople react to the real, like real books. Why take that away?\n\nAcknowledgements: This post is the product of several discussions with my brother, James Nolte, a retired reference librarian. He was an early developer of digital libraries, working at Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY in the mid 1980’s. But like Frankenstein, he sometimes worries about the consequences of his own creation.\n\nI often joke with my students in class that the reason I went into physics is because I have a bad memory. In biology you need to memorize a thousand things, but in physics you only need to memorize 10 things … and you derive everything else!\n\nOf course, the first question they ask me is “What are those 10 things?”.\n\nThat’s a hard question to answer, and every physics professor probably has a different set of 10 things. Obviously, energy conservation would be first on the list, followed by other conservation laws for various types of momentum. Inverse-square laws probably come next. But then what? What do you need to memorize to be most useful when you are working out physics problems on the back of an envelope, when your phone is dead, and you have no access to your laptop or books?\n\nOne of my favorites is the Virial Theorem because it rears its head over and over again, whether you are working on problems in statistical mechanics, orbital mechanics or quantum mechanics.\n\nThe Virial Theorem\n\nThe Virial Theorem makes a simple statement about the balance between kinetic energy and potential energy (in a conservative mechanical system). It summarizes in a single form many different-looking special cases we learn about in physics. For instance, everyone learns early in their first mechanics course that the average kinetic energy <T> of a mass on a spring is equal to the average potential energy <V>. But this seems different than the problem of a circular orbit in gravitation or electrostatics where the average kinetic energy is equal to half the average potential energy, but with the opposite sign.\n\nYet there is a unity to these two—it is the Virial Theorem:\n\nfor cases where the potential energy V has power law dependence V ≈ rn. The harmonic oscillator has n = 2, leading to the well-known equality between average kinetic and potential energy as\n\nThe inverse square force law has a potential that varies with n = -1, leading to the flip in sign. For instance, for a circular orbit in gravitation, it looks like\n\nand in electrostatics it looks like\n\nwhere a is the radius of the orbit.\n\nYet orbital mechanics is hardly the only place where the Virial Theorem pops up. It began its life with statistical mechanics.\n\nRudolph Clausius and his Virial Theorem\n\nThe pantheon of physics is a somewhat exclusive club. It lets in the likes of Galileo, Lagrange, Maxwell, Boltzmann, Einstein, Feynman and Hawking, but it excludes many worthy candidates, like Gilbert, Stevin, Maupertuis, du Chatelet, Arago, Clausius, Heaviside and Meitner all of whom had an outsized influence on the history of physics, but who often do not get their due. Of this later group, Rudolph Clausius stands above the others because he was an inventor of whole new worlds and whole new terminologies that permeate physics today.\n\nWithin the German Confederation dominated by Prussia in the mid 1800’s, Clausius was among the first wave of the “modern” physicists who emerged from new or reorganized German universities that integrated mathematics with practical topics. Carl Neumann at Königsberg, Carl Gauss and Max Weber at Göttingen, and Hermann von Helmholtz at Berlin were transforming physics from a science focused on pure mechanics and astronomy to one focused on materials and their associated phenomena, applying mathematics to these practical problems.\n\nClausius was educated at Berlin under Heinrich Gustav Magnus beginning in 1840, and he completed his doctorate at the University of Halle in 1847. His doctoral thesis on light scattering in the atmosphere represented an early attempt at treating statistical fluctuations. Though his initial approach was naïve, it helped orient Clausius to physics problems of statistical ensembles and especially to gases. The sophistication of his physics matured rapidly and already in 1850 he published his famous paper Über die bewegende Kraft der Wärme, und die Gesetze, welche sich daraus für die Wärmelehre selbst ableiten lassen (About the moving power of heat and the laws that can be derived from it for the theory of heat itself).\n\nThis was the fundamental paper that overturned the archaic theory of caloric, which had assumed that heat was a form of conserved quantity. Clausius proved that this was not true, and he introduced what are today called the first and second laws of thermodynamics. This early paper was one in which he was still striving to simplify thermodynamics, and his second law was mostly a qualitative statement that heat flows from higher temperatures to lower. He refined the second law four years later in 1854 with Über eine veranderte Form des zweiten Hauptsatzes der mechanischen Wärmetheorie (On a modified form of the second law of the mechanical theory of heat). He gave his concept the name Entropy in 1865 from the Greek word τροπη (transformation or change) with a prefix similar to Energy.\n\nClausius was one of the first to consider the kinetic theory of heat where heat was understood as the average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules that comprised the gas. He published his seminal work on the topic in 1857 expanding on earlier work by Augustus Krönig. Maxwell, in turn, expanded on Clausius in 1860 by introducing probability distributions. By 1870, Clausius was fully immersed in the kinetic theory as he was searching for mechanical proofs of the second law of thermodynamics. Along the way, he discovered a quantity based on action-reaction pairs of forces that was related to the kinetic energy.\n\nAt that time, kinetic energy was often called vis viva, meaning “living force”. The singular of force (vis) had a plural (virias), so Clausius—always happy to coin new words—called the action-reaction pairs of forces the virial, and hence he proved the Virial Theorem.\n\nThe argument is relatively simple. Consider the action of a single molecule of the gas subject to a force F that is applied reciprocally from another molecule. Also, for simplicity consider only a single direction in the gas. The change of the action over time is given by the derivative\n\nThe average over all action-reaction pairs is\n\nbut by the reciprocal nature of action-reaction pairs, the left-hand side balances exactly to zero, giving\n\nThis expression is expanded to include the other directions and to all N bodies to yield the Virial Theorem\n\nwhere the sum is over all molecules in the gas, and Clausius called the term on the right the Virial.\n\nAn important special case is when the force law derives from a power law\n\nThen the Virial Theorem becomes (again in just one dimension)\n\nThis is often the most useful form of the theorem. For a spring force, it leads to <T> = <V>. For gravitational or electrostatic orbits it is <T> = -1/2<V>.\n\nThe Virial in Astrophysics\n\nClausius originally developed the Virial Theorem for the kinetic theory of gases, but it has applications that go far beyond. It is already useful for simple orbital systems like masses interacting through central forces, and these can be scaled up to N-body systems like star clusters or galaxies.\n\nStar clusters are groups of hundreds or thousands of stars that are gravitationally bound. Such a cluster may begin in a highly non-equilibrium configuration, but the mutual interactions among the stars causes a relaxation to an equilibrium configuration of positions and velocities. This process is known as Virialization. The time scale for virializaiton depends on the number of stars and on the initial configuration, such as whether there is a net angular momentum in the cluster.\n\nA gravitational simulation of 700 stars is shown in Fig. 2. The stars are distributed uniformly with zero velocities. The cluster collapses under gravitational attraction, rebounds and approaches a steady state. The Virial Theorem applies at long times. The simulation assumed all motion was in the plane, and a regularization term was added to the gravitational potential to keep forces bounded.\n\nThe Virial in Quantum Physics\n\nQuantum theory holds strong analogs to classical mechanics. For instance, the quantum commutation relations have strong similarities to Poisson Brackets. Similarly, the Virial in classical physics has a direct quantum analog.\n\nBegin with the commutator between the Hamiltonian H and the action composed as the product of the position operator and the momentum operator XnPn\n\nExpand the two commutators on the right to give\n\nNow recognize that the commutator with the Hamiltonian is Ehrenfest’s Theorem on the time dependence of the operators\n\nwhich equals zero when the system become stationary or steady state. All that remains is to take the expectation value of the equation (which can include many-body interactions as well)\n\nwhich is the quantum form of the Virital Theorem which is identical to the classical form when the expectation value is replaced by the ensemble average.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom this is\n\nfor principal quantum number n and Bohr radius aB. The quantum energy levels of the hydrogen atom are\n\nBy David D.

Why weren’t they encrypted and stored in bits and pieces across the cloud? In fact, among all the technological wonders of the Star Wars universe, the cloud and the internet are conspicuously absent. Why?\n\nAfter the Microsoft IT crash of July 19, 2024, I think I know the answer: Because the internet and the cloud and computer operating systems are so fundamentally and hopelessly flawed that any advanced civilization would have dispensed with them eons ago.\n\nInformation Technology (IT)\n\nI used to love buying a new computer. It was a joy to boot up for the first time, like getting a new toy. But those days may be over.\n\nNow, when I buy a new computer through my university, the IT staff won’t deliver it until they have installed several layers of control systems overlayed on top of the OS. And then all the problems start … incompatibilities, conflicts, permissions denied, failed software installation, failed VPN connections, unrecognized IP addresses, and on and on.\n\nThe problem, of course, is computer security. There are so many IT hack attacks through so many different avenues that multiple layers of protection are needed to keep attackers out of the university network and off its computers.\n\nBut the security overhead is getting so burdensome, causing so many problems, that the dream from decades ago that the computer era would save all of us so much time has now become a nightmare as we spend hours per day just doing battle with IT issues. More and more of our time is sucked into the IT black hole.\n\nThe Microsoft IT Crash of July 19, 2024\n\nOn Friday the 19th, we were in New York City, scheduled to fly out of Newark Airport around 2pm to return to Indianapolis. We knew we were in trouble when we looked at the news on Friday morning. The top story was about an IT crash of Microsoft operating systems controlling airlines, banks and healthcare systems.\n\nAt Newark airport, we were greeted by the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) on all the displays that should have been telling us about flight information. Our United apps still worked on our iPhones, but our flight to Indy had been cancelled. We took an option for a later flight and went to the United Club with two valid tickets and a lot of time to kill, but they wouldn’t let us in because their reader had crashed too.\n\nSo we went to get pot stickers for lunch. Our push notifications had been turned on, but we never received the alert that our second flight had been cancelled because the push notifications weren’t going out. By the time we realized we had no flight, United had rebooked us on a flight 2 days later.\n\nNot wanting to hang around the Newark airport for 2 days, we went online to rent a car to drive the 16 hours back to Indy, but all the cars were sold out. In a last desperate act, we went onto Expedia and found an available car from Thrifty Car Rental—likely the very last one at the Newark airport.\n\nSo, on the road by 4pm we had 16 hours ahead of us before getting back home. The cost out of pocket (even after subtracting the $400 refund from United on our return flight) was $700 … all because of one line of code in a Microsoft update. The total estimated cost of that error worldwide is anticipated to exceed $1B.\n\nA House of Cards\n\nThe IT era began around 1980, about 45 years ago, when IBM launched its PC. Operating systems were amazingly simplistic at that time, but slowly over the decades they grew into behemoths, add-ons adding to add-ons, cobbled together as if with chewing gum and baling wire. Now they consist of millions of lines of code, patches on patches seeking to fix incompatibilities that create more incompatibilities in the process.\n\nIT is a house of cards that takes only one bad line of code to bring the whole thing crashing down across the world. This is particularly worrisome given the Axis of Chaos that resents seeing the free world enjoying its freedoms. It’s an easy target.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. It’s not unlike the early industrial revolution of steam power when every engine was different, or transportation when there were multiple railroad wheel widths, or electrification when AC did battle with DC, or telecommunications when different types of MUX on fiber-optic cables were incompatible. This always happens when there is a revolution in technology that develops rapidly.\n\nWhat is needed is a restart, to scrap the entire system and start from scratch. Computer Scientists know how to build an efficient and resilient network from the ground up, with certification processes to remove the anonymity that enables cyber criminals to masquerade as legitimate operators.\n\nBut to do this requires a financial incentive. The cost would be huge because the current system is so delocalized as every laptop or smart pad becomes a node in the network. The Infrastructure Bill could still make this goal its target. That would be revolutionary and enabling (like the Eisenhower Interstate System was in the 1950’s which transformed American society), instead of spending a trillion dollars to fill in potholes across a neglected infrastructure.\n\nIt may seem to be too late to start over, but a few more IT crashes like last Friday may make it mandatory. Wouldn’t it be better to start now?\n\nOne hundred years ago, in July of 1924, a brilliant Indian physicist changed the way that scientists count. Satyendra Nath Bose (1894 – 1974) mailed a letter to Albert Einstein enclosed with a manuscript containing a new derivation of Planck’s law of blackbody radiation. Bose had used a radical approach that went beyond the classical statistics of Maxwell and Boltzmann by counting the different ways that photons can fill a volume of space. His key insight was the indistinguishability of photons as quantum particles.\n\nToday, the indistinguishability of quantum particles is the foundational element of quantum statistics that governs how fundamental particles combine to make up all the matter of the universe. At the time, neither Bose nor Einstein realized just how radical his approach was, until Einstein, using Bose’s idea, derived the behavior of material particles under conditions similar black-body radiation, predicting a new state of condensed matter [1]. It would take scientists 70 years to finally demonstrate “Bose-Einstein” condensation in a laboratory in Boulder, Colorado in 1995.\n\nEarly Days of the Photon\n\nAs outlined in a previous blog (see Who Invented the Quantum? Einstein versus Planck), Max Planck was a reluctant revolutionary. He was led, almost against his will, in 1900 to postulate a quantized interaction between electromagnetic radiation and the atoms in the walls of a black-body enclosure. He could not break free from the hold of classical physics, assuming classical properties for the radiation and assigning the quantum only to the “interaction” with matter. It was Einstein, five years later in 1905, who took the bold step of assigning quantum properties to the radiation field itself, inventing the idea of the “photon” (named years later by the American chemist Gilbert Lewis) as the first quantum particle.\n\nDespite the vast potential opened by Einstein’s theory of the photon, quantum physics languished for nearly 20 years from 1905 to 1924 as semiclassical approaches dominated the thinking of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and Max Born in Göttingen, and Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, as they grappled with wave-particle duality.\n\nThe existence of the photon, first doubted by almost everyone, was confirmed in 1915 by Robert Millikan’s careful measurement of the photoelectric effect. But even then, skepticism remained until Arthur Compton demonstrated experimentally in 1923 that the scattering of photons by electrons could only be explained if photons carried discrete energy and momentum in precisely the way that Einstein’s theory required.\n\nDespite the success of Einstein’s photon by 1923, derivations of the Planck law still used a purely wave-based approach to count the number of electromagnetic standing waves that a cavity could support. Bose would change that by deriving the Planck law using purely quantum methods.\n\nThe Quantum Derivation by Bose\n\nSatyendra Nath Bose was born in 1894 in Calcutta, the old British capital city of India, now Kolkata. He excelled at his studies, especially in mathematics, and received a lecturer post at the University of Calcutta from 1916 to 1921, when he moved into a professorship position at the new University of Dhaka.\n\nOne day, as he was preparing a class lecture on the derivation of Planck’s law,\n\nhe became dissatisfied with the usual way it was presented in textbooks, based on standing waves in the cavity, and he flipped the problem.\n\nRather than deriving the number of standing wave modes in real space, he considered counting the number of ways a photon would fill up phase space.\n\nPhase space is the natural dynamical space of Hamiltonian systems [2], such as collections of quantum particles like photons, in which the axes of the space are defined by the positions and momenta of the particles. The differential volume of phase space dVPS occupied by a single photon is given by\n\nUsing Einstein’s formula for the relationship between momentum and frequency\n\nwhere h is Planck’s constant, yields\n\nNo quantum particle can have its position and momentum defined arbitrarily precisely because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, requiring phase space volumes to be resolvable only to within a minimum reducible volume element given by h3.\n\nTherefore, the number of states in phase space occupied by the single photon are obtained by dividing dVPS by h3 to yield\n\nwhich is half of the prefactor in the Planck law. Several comments are now necessary.\n\nFirst, when Bose did this derivation, there was no Heisenberg Uncertainty relationship—that would come years later in 1927. Bose was guided, instead, by the work of Bohr and Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest who emphasized the role played by the action principle in quantum systems. Phase space dimensions are counted in units of action, and the quantized unit of action is given by Planck’s constant h, hence quantized volumes of action in phase space are given by h3. By taking this step, Bose was anticipating Heisenberg by nearly three years.\n\nSecond, Bose knew that his phase space volume was half of the prefactor in Planck’s law. But since he was counting states, he reasoned that this meant that each photon had two internal degrees of freedom. A possibility he considered to account for this was that the photon might have a spin that could be aligned, or anti-aligned, with the momentum of the photon [3, 4]. How he thought of spin is hard to fathom, because the spin of the electron, proposed by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit, was still two years away.\n\nBut Bose was not finished. The derivation, so far, is just how much phase space volume is accessible to a single photon. The next step is to count the different ways that many photons can fill up phase space. For this he used (bringing in the factor of 2 for spin)\n\nwhere pn is the probability that a volume of phase space contains n photons, plus he used the usual conditions on energy and number\n\nThe probability for all the different permutations for how photons can occupy phase space is then given by\n\nA third comment is now necessary: By assuming this probability, Bose was discounting situations where the photons could be distinguished from one another. This indistinguishability of quantum particles is absolutely fundamental to our understanding today of quantum statistics, but Bose was using it implicitly for the first time here.\n\nThe final distribution of photons at a given temperature T is found by maximizing the entropy of the system\n\nsubject to the conditions of photon energy and number. Bose found the occupancy probabilities to be\n\nwith a coefficient B to be found next by using this in the expression for the geometric series\n\nyielding\n\nAlso, from the total number of photons\n\nAnd, from the total energy\n\nBose obtained, finally\n\nwhich is Planck’s law.\n\nThis derivation uses nothing by the counting of quanta in phase space. There are no standing waves. It is a purely quantum calculation—the first of its kind.\n\nEnter Einstein\n\nAs usual with revolutionary approaches, Bose’s initial manuscript submitted to the British Philosophical Magazine was rejected. But he was convinced that he had attained something significant, so he wrote his letter to Einstein containing his manuscript, asking that if Einstein found merit in the derivation, then perhaps he could have it translated into German and submitted to the Zeitschrift für Physik. (That Bose would approach Einstein with this request seems bold, but they had communicated some years before when Bose had translated Einstein’s theory of General Relativity into English.)\n\nIndeed, Einstein recognized immediately what Bose had accomplished, and he translated the manuscript himself into German and submitted it to the Zeitschrift on July 2, 1924 [5].\n\nDuring his translation, Einstein did not feel that Bose’s conjecture about photon spin was defensible, so he changed the wording to attribute the factor of 2 in the derivation to the two polarizations of light (a semiclassical concept), so Einstein actually backtracked a little from what Bose originally intended as a fully quantum derivation. The existence of photon spin was confirmed by C. V. Raman in 1931 [6].\n\nIn late 1924, Einstein applied Bose’s concepts to an ideal gas of material atoms and predicted that at low temperatures the gas would condense into a new state of matter known today as a Bose-Einstein condensate [1]. Matter differs from photons because the conservation of atom number introduces a finite chemical potential to the problem of matter condensation that is not present in the Planck law.\n\nPaul Dirac, in 1945, enshrined the name of Bose by coining the phrase “Boson” to refer to a particle of integer spin, just as he coined “Fermion” after Enrico Fermi to refer to a particle of half-integer spin. All quantum statistics were encased by these two types of quantum particle until 1982, when Frank Wilczek coined the term “Anyon” to describe the quantum statistics of particles confined to two dimensions whose behaviors vary between those of a boson and of a fermion.\n\nBy David D.

Because almost no one knows.\n\nBut there is one person behind all the answers: Simon Stevin of Bruges!\n\nThe Renaissance Man\n\nSimon Stevin was born in Bruges, the Flemish capital of the Low Countries, in 1548, five years after Copernicus published his heliocentric model of the universe, and he lived just long enough to see Kepler lay down his laws in Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae, published in 1619. This was the dawn of the Scientific Revolution, where Copernicus and Galileo and Kepler take center stage. Stevin was right there with them, and he was just as influential in his own time, but his star faded after his death, eclipsed by better press—Galileo, after all, was a master at it. Yet the echoes of Stevin’s discoveries reverberate today. Every time you write a decimal fraction, every time you sit down at a tuned piano, every time you reach for a dime, you are receiving the legacy of Simon Stevin.\n\nStevin was born a nobody, an illegitimate son who fortunately was acknowledged and educated by his family. He left Bruges in 1571 to escape the Spanish reign of terror against protestants, traveling across the continent to learn about the wider world and how it worked. In the convoluted politics of the sixteenth century, Catholic Spain had been given dominion over the mostly Protestant Netherlands and conflict was the rule, but in 1579 the seven northern provinces united, led by William of Orange, breaking free from Spain in 1581. Stevin was drawn back to the Low Countries and to the new republic, enrolling as a student at the University of Leiden where he became close friends with William of Orange’s second son, Maurits, Prince of Orange. Maurits was heir to William because his older brother was loyal to Spain. When William was assassinated in 1584 in Delft, Maurits assumed command of his father’s army in the war against Spain and he asked Stevin to serve as a military advisor. Stevin left the university, never returning to receive a degree, and for the next 20 years helped Prince Maurits expel the Spanish from the United Provinces.\n\nWhere and when Stevin had time to educate himself is anyone’s guess, but by the time of the truce of 1609, he had published 8 books that ranged in topics from book-keeping to hydraulics to weights-and-measures to compounded interest to political science to mathematics and more. Most of these were written in Dutch instead of Latin, making them accessible to the rising artesan class, and many were translated into other languages (by Willebord Snellius of “Snell’s Law” fame), where their practical impact on commerce and trade and daily life outweighed the more ethereal works of his better known contemporaries Galileo and Kepler.\n\nBecause the Netherlands were a seafaring country focused on trade, the physics of hydraulics as well as the physics of weights and measures were of direct usefulness, and Stevin’s always pragmatic interests were drawn to problems of buoyancy and stability, making him one of the Renaissance’s first physicists.\n\nThe Law of Fall\n\nIn all the contemporary documents associated with the life of Galileo, there is no evidence that he ever dropped balls from the leaning tower of Pisa. The story first appears in a biography of Galileo by the student of a student—by Vincenzo Viviani who was a pupil of Torricelli, writing about events that took place half a century earlier. The story goes that Galileo, while in Pisa in 1589, dropped weights of the same material but different masses from the leaning tower and showed that they fell at the same rates, demonstrating a clear departure from the physics of Aristotle who would have claimed that the heavier weight fell faster.\n\nIt is easy to see how a leaning tower might help in such an experiment, allowing the balls to be dropped carefully from rest and to fall vertically while clearing the base of the building. Coincidentally, there is another famous leaning tower in Europe, the Oude Kerk in Delft, in the Netherlands, built in 1350 at the edge of the old canal known as Oude Delft. The soft earth at the edge of the canal sagged as the church tower was being built, and though the builders tilted each new section to be vertical, to this day the church tower leans ominously.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence that Galileo ever performed the experiment, there is solid evidence that Stevin did the experiment himself by 1586 (three years before Galileo) when he published his book on buoyancy and statics. Enlisting the help of the burgomaster of Delft, Jan de Groot, two weights of the same size, but differing in mass by about a factor of ten, were dropped from 30 feet up onto a wooden board. The time of fall was evaluated differentially by the sounds of the impacts on the board, which were nearly simultaneous, despite the large difference in mass, clearly refuting Aristotle’s physics.\n\nAlthough Stevin gives many specific details of the experiment, he does not say exactly where it was performed. It has often been assumed that the experiment was performed at the Neue Kerk in the main square of Delft, since this was the tallest building in Delft at that time. But my money is on the Oude Kerk with its convenient tilt. I am not aware of anyone else making this connection. I have seen the Oude Kerk myself and its constant-width tower is perfect for dropping weights. And 30 feet is not that high, so there was no need to perform the experiment at the much taller Neue Kerk.\n\nIt is possible that the leaning tower of Pisa was substituted for the leaning tower of Delft in Viviani’s hagiography of Galileo, or that Galileo, knowing of Stevin’s experiment, described what would have happened had he repeated it. Biographies by disciples are never reliable, while Stevin’s writings are known for their even handedness. Furthermore, Stevin published before Galileo is supposed to have done his experiment, so Stevin had nothing to prove to anyone in his writing. There was no priority dispute.\n\nNone of this takes away from what Galileo accomplished. His experiments performed with balls on inclined planes were exquisitely detailed, complete and accurate—the forerunners of the kind of careful experimental study that elicit new laws of physics. Furthermore, Galileo’s thorough mathematical analysis of his experimental results inaugurated the field of mathematical physics. Stevin’s priority for dropping balls from leaning towers cannot place him ahead of Galileo for the epic shifting of paradigms.\n\nAlthough Stevin had no personal connection to Galileo in the realm of physics, he did have a connection in the realm of music theory, not to Galileo himself, but to Galileo’s father.\n\nMusical Temperament\n\nWhy do a pair of notes on a perfect fifth sound so harmonious? Why do other pairs sound dissonant? These questions are at the root of music theory that have perplexed mathematicians and physicists since the days of Pythagoras. Pythagoras proposed the ratio of small integers as the explanation, which works fine for the most fundamental intervals on the octave.\n\nAn octave consists of 8 notes with seven half-tone intervals. One octave is a factor of 2 in frequency. If the frequency of a root note is f0, then the note one octave higher is 2•f0. In Western music, the diatonic scale is the most common to span an octave. It contains 7 notes plus the octave (to make 8), such as C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C for the scale of C-major. In this diatonic scale the fifth note G is the most important. Pythagoras established that the ratio of the fifth to the root goes as the ratio of 3:2, or as we would say today, a frequecy of 1.5•f0. Furthermore, successive fifths define the root diatonic, such as C-G-D-A-E-B-F-C that spans 7 fifths and 4 octaves bringing the frequency to 16•f0.\n\nBut here is the problem that vexed musical theorists for over a millennium:\n\nIt doesn’t work! The ratio of 3:2 applied 7 times gives a frequency of 17•f0, but it should only be a frequency of 16•f0 for four octaves in frequency. There is an error of 6%! What happened?\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, lutes had evolved to have as many as 14 strings that the lutenist had to tune, and the best musicians, those with perfect pitch, knew that when tuning a lute in the scale of D, the tone of the “C” note was slightly different than if the lute were tuned in the scale of C. In other words, every key required slightly different frequencies even for the same “note”.\n\nYet there were some lutenists who realized that the differences were so minor, that a “compromise” tuning, known as a temperament, could be found so that songs in different keys would not require an entire retuning of all 14 strings.\n\nEnter Galileo’s father, Vincenzo Galilei, a minor aristocrat without means who partially supported himself as a lutenist. He had studied music under Gioseffo Zarlino in Venice, who had used an approach developed by Ptolemy that extended the Pythagorean ratios of the numbers 2, 3 and 4 to include the numbers 5 and 6 relying on superparticular ratios (in which the numerator is one unit more than the denominator) of 3/2, and 4/3 that were extended to include 5/4 and 6/5 as the basis of consonance. Later, Vincenzo came to realize that tuning on these ratios prevented continuous modulation across scales, so he settled on a superparticular ratio of 18/17 = 1.0588 as the multiplier that increased the frequency on a half-note interval, allowing a player to transition smoothly among scales without retuning. He published his modern theory of music intonation in a book in 1581 (the same year that his son began attending classes at the University in Pisa). [1]\n\nVincenzo Galilei’s solution was very close, but it was still in the Pythagorean vein. Stevin realized there was a better approach. By using Vincenzo’s ratio, multiplying it by itself 12 times while increasing one octave by taking 12 steps, the frequency of the higher tonic would be\n\nwhich is within 1% of the perfect factor of 2. But a perfect factor of 2 is what is required by a perfect theory of musical tone. Therefore, Stevin reasoned that the true factor, when multiplied by itself 12 times should yield a perfect factor of 2. The obvious answer is\n\nAt the turn of the seventeenth century, algebraic methods for calculating roots were already established, and Stevin wrote up his idea in the manuscript De Spiegheling der Singconst (Theory of the Art of Singing, ca. 1605). Though he was a persistent publisher, this one never quite got into print, remaining in manuscript form until 1884, well after issues of temperament had been established. But it established a rational mathematical approach (based on an irrational number) that differed from the Pythagorean reliance on ratios of integers.\n\nDecimal Notation\n\nIn Stevin’s day, not only music, but numbers too were being held hostage by Pythagoras’ legacy. Measurements were made as fractions: 1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1/16, etc. (In the US we are still held hostage by this ancient method when we talk of a “sixteenth” or a “thirtysecond” of an inch.)\n\nStevin thought of a more rational approach that would facilitate computations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. All fraction can be expressed as sums of powers with variable coefficients. For instance\n\nBut this example is in “octal” just to illustrate the point. What Stevin recognized is that the approach can be used with Fibonacci’s Indo-Arabic numerals based on 10 digits. Then\n\nStevin, inventing a new notation, expressed this as\n\nwhere he explicitly writes out the successive powers. This notation was later shortened to include only the symbol for the zeroth power, since the place notation implicitly included the other powers. The zeroth-power symbol became a point in some versions and a comma in other versions in wide-spread use today.\n\nStevin’s booklet on decimal notation was called De Thiende (The Art of Tenths) and was translated into French as Le Disme (pronounced “dime”, where the s is silent). Thomas Jefferson was directly influenced by the idea of decimal coinage when he was deciding on the currency system for the new United States of America. He was looking for a more rational approach than the old British usage of shillings and pennies and farthings (or the “pieces of eight” in the southern maritimes) that had no obvious relationship to each other for anyone not used to their system. So Jefferson adopted one hundred cents to the dollar and the “dime” for the ten-cent coin, paying homage to Simon Stevin of Bruges.\n\nBy David D. Nolte, May 22, 2024\n\nReferences\n\n[1] D. D.

(Read about the personal dramas of scientists and mathematicians as they developed the physics of motion.)\n\nThere are sometimes individuals who seem always to find themselves at the focal points of their times. The physicist George Uhlenbeck was one of these individuals, showing up at all the right times in all the right places at the dawn of modern physics in the 1920’s and 1930’s. He studied under Ehrenfest and Bohr and Born, and he was friends with Fermi and Oppenheimer and Oskar Klein. He taught physics at the universities at Leiden, Michigan, Utrecht, Columbia, MIT and Rockefeller. He was a wide-ranging theoretical physicist who worked on Brownian motion, early string theory, quantum tunneling, and the master equation. Yet he is most famous for the very first thing he did as a graduate student—the discovery of the quantum spin of the electron.\n\nElectron Spin\n\nG. E. Uhlenbeck, and S. Goudsmit, “Spinning electrons and the structure of spectra,” Nature 117, 264-265 (1926).\n\nGeorge Uhlenbeck (1900 – 1988) was born in the Dutch East Indies, the son of a family with a long history in the Dutch military [1]. After the father retired to The Hague, George was expected to follow the family tradition into the military, but he stumbled onto a copy of H. Lorentz’ introductory physics textbook and was hooked. Unfortunately, to attend university in the Netherlands at that time required knowledge of Greek and Latin, which he lacked, so he entered the Institute of Technology in Delft to study chemical engineering. He found the courses dreary.\n\nFortunately, he was only a few months into his first semester when the language requirement was dropped, and he immediately transferred to the University of Leiden to study physics. He tried to read Boltzmann, but found him opaque, but then read the famous encyclopedia article by the husband and wife team of Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest on statistical mechanics (see my Physics Today article [2]), which became his lifelong focus.\n\nAfter graduating, he continued into graduate school, taking classes from Ehrenfest, but lacking funds, he supported himself by teaching classes at a girls high school, until he heard of a job tutoring the son of the Dutch ambassador to Italy. He was off to Rome for three years, where he met Enrico Fermi and took classes from Tullio Bevi-Cevita and Vito Volterra.\n\nHowever, he nearly lost his way. Surrounded by the rich cultural treasures of Rome, he became deeply interested in art and was seriously considering giving up physics and pursuing a degree in art history. When Ehrenfest got wind of this change in heart, he recalled Uhlenbeck in 1925 to the Netherlands and shrewdly paired him up with another graduate student, Samuel Goudsmit, to work on a new idea proposed by Wolfgang Pauli a few months earlier on the exclusion principle.\n\nPauli had explained the filling of the energy levels of atoms by introducing a new quantum number that had two values. Once an energy level was filled by two electrons, each carrying one of the two quantum numbers, this energy level “excluded” any further filling by other electrons.\n\nTo Uhlenbeck, these two quantum numbers seemed as if they must arise from some internal degree of freedom, and in a flash of insight he imagined that it might be caused if the electron were spinning. Since spin was a form of angular momentum, the spin degree of freedom would combine with orbital angular momentum to produce a composite angular momentum for the quantum levels of atoms.\n\nThe idea of electron spin was not immediately embraced by the broader community, and Bohr and Heisenberg and Pauli had their reservations. Fortunately, they all were traveling together to attend the 50th anniversary of Lorentz’ doctoral examination and were met at the train station in Leiden by Ehrenfest and Einstein. As usual, Einstein had grasped the essence of the new physics and explained how the moving electron feels an induced magnetic field which would act on the magnetic moment of the electron to produce spin-orbit coupling. With that, Bohr was convinced.\n\nUhlenbeck and Goudsmit wrote up their theory in a short article in Nature, followed by a short note by Bohr. A few months later, L. H. Thomas, while visiting Bohr in Copenhagen, explained the factor of two that appears in (what later came to be called) Thomas precession of the electron, cementing the theory of electron spin in the new quantum mechanics.\n\n5-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics\n\nP. Ehrenfest, and G. E. Uhlenbeck, “Graphical illustration of De Broglie’s phase waves in the five-dimensional world of O Klein,” Zeitschrift Fur Physik 39, 495-498 (1926).\n\nAround this time, the Swedish physicist Oskar Klein visited Leiden after returning from three years at the University of Michigan where he had taken advantage of the isolation to develop a quantum theory of 5-dimensional spacetime. This was one of the first steps towards a grand unification of the forces of nature since there was initial hope that gravity and electromagnetism might both be expressed in terms of the five-dimensional space.\n\nAn unusual feature of Klein’s 5-dimensional relativity theory was the compactness of the fifth dimension, in which it was “rolled up” into a kind of high-dimensional string with a tiny radius. If the 4-dimensional theory of spacetime was sometimes hard to visualize, here was an even tougher problem.\n\nUhlenbeck and Ehrenfest met often with Klein during his stay in Leiden, discussing the geometry and consequences of the 5-dimensional theory. Ehrenfest was always trying to get at the essence of physical phenomena in the simplest terms. His famous refrain was “Was ist der Witz?” (What is the point?) [1]. These discussions led to a simple paper in Zeitschrift für Physik published later that year in 1926 by Ehrenfest and Uhlenbeck with the compelling title “Graphical Illustration of De Broglie’s Phase Waves in the Five-Dimensional World of O Klein”. The paper provided the first visualization of the 5-dimensional spacetime with the compact dimension. The string-like character of the spacetime was one of the first forays into modern day “string theory” whose dimensions have now expanded to 11 from 5.\n\nDuring his visit, Klein also told Uhlenbeck about the relativistic Schrödinger equation that he was working on, which would later become the Klein-Gordon equation. This was a near miss, because what the Klein-Gordon equation was missing was electron spin—which Uhlenbeck himself had introduced into quantum theory—but it would take a few more years before Dirac showed how to incorporate spin into the theory.\n\nBrownian Motion\n\nG. E. Uhlenbeck and L. S. Ornstein, “On the theory of the Brownian motion,” Physical Review 36, 0823-0841 (1930).\n\nAfter spending time with Bohr in Copenhagen while finishing his PhD, Uhlenbeck visited Max Born at Göttingen where he met J. Robert Oppenheimer who was also visiting Born at that time. When Uhlenbeck traveled to the United States in late summer of 1927 to take a position at the University of Michigan, he was met at the dock in New York by Oppenheimer.\n\nUhlenbeck was a professor of physics at Michigan for eight years from 1927 to 1935, and he instituted a series of Summer Schools [3] in theoretical physics that attracted international participants and introduced a new generation of American physicists to the rigors of theory that they previously had to go to Europe to find.\n\nIn this way, Uhlenbeck was part of a great shift that occurred in the teaching of graduate-level physics of the 1930’s that brought European expertise to the United States. Just a decade earlier, Oppenheimer had to go to Göttingen to find the kind of education that he needed for graduate studies in physics. Oppenheimer brought the new methods back with him to Berkeley, where he established a strong theory department to match the strong experimental activities of E. O. Lawrence. Now, European physicists too were coming to America, an exodus accelerated by the increasing anti-Semitism in Europe under the rise of fascism.\n\nDuring this time, one of Uhlenbeck’s collaborators was L. S. Ornstein, the director of the Physical Laboratory at the University of Utrecht and a founding member of the Dutch Physical Society. Uhlenbeck and Ornstein were both interested in the physics of Brownian motion, but wished to establish the phenomenon on a more sound physical basis. Einstein’s famous paper of 1905 on Brownian motion had made several Einstein-style simplifications that stripped the complicated theory to its bare essentials, but had lost some of the details in the process, such as the role of inertia at the microscale.\n\nUhlenbeck and Ornstein published a paper in 1930 that developed the stochastic theory of Brownian motion, including the effects of particle inertia. The stochastic differential equation (SDE) for velocity is\n\nwhere γ is viscosity, Γ is a fluctuation coefficient, and dw is a “Wiener process”. The Wiener differential dw has unusual properties such that\n\nUhlenbeck and Ornstein solived this SDE to yield an average velocity\n\nwhich decays to zero at long times, and a variance\n\nthat asymptotes to a finite value at long times. The fluctuation coefficient is thus given by\n\nfor a process with characteristic speed v0. An estimate for the fluctuation coefficient can be obtained by considering the force F on an object of size a\n\nFor instance, for intracellular transport [4], the fluctuation coefficient has a rough value of Γ = 2 Hz μm2/sec2.\n\nQuantum Tunneling\n\nD. M. Dennison and G. E. Uhlenbeck, “The two-minima problem and the ammonia molecule,” Physical Review 41, 313-321 (1932).\n\nBy the early 1930’s, quantum tunnelling of the electron through classically forbidden regions of potential energy was well established, but electrons did not have a monopoly on quantum effects. Entire atoms—electrons plus nucleus—also have quantum wave functions and can experience regions of classically forbidden potential.\n\nUhlenbeck, with David Dennison, a fellow physicist at Ann Arbor, Michigan, developed the first quantum theory of molecular tunneling for the molecular configuration of ammonia NH3 that can tunnel between the two equivalent configurations. Their use of the WKB approximation in the paper set the standard for subsequent WKB approaches that would play an important role in the calculation of nuclear decay rates.\n\nMaster Equation\n\nA. Nordsieck, W. E. Lamb, and G. E. Uhlenbeck, “On the theory of cosmic-ray showers I. The furry model and the fluctuation problem,” Physica 7, 344-360 (1940)\n\nIn 1935, Uhlenbeck left Michigan to take up the physics chair recently vacated by Kramers at Utrecht. However, watching the rising Nazism in Europe, he decided to return to the United States, beginning as a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York in 1940. During his visit, he worked with W. E. Lamb and A. Nordsieck on the problem of cosmic ray showers.\n\nTheir publication on the topic included a rate equation that is encountered in a wide range of physical phenomena. They called it the “Master Equation” for ease of reference in later parts of the paper, but this phrase stuck, and the “Master Equation” is now a standard tool used by physicists when considering the balances among multiples transitions.\n\nUhlenbeck never returned to Europe, moving among Michigan, MIT, Princeton and finally settling at Rockefeller University in New York from where he retired in 1971.\n\nBy David D.

Weather events, natural disasters, economic volatility, empire building—all these contribute to the complexities that buffet our lives. It is no wonder that ancient man attributed the chaos to the gods or to the fates, infinitely far from anything we can comprehend as cause and effect. Yet there is a balm to soothe our wounds from the slings of life—Chaos Theory—if not to solve our problems, then at least to understand them.\n\n(Sections of this Blog have been excerpted\n\nfrom the book Galileo Unbound, published by Oxford University Press)\n\nChaos Theory is the theory of complex systems governed by multiple factors that produce complicated outputs. The power of the theory is its ability recognize when the complicated outputs are not “random”, no matter how complicated they are, but are in fact determined by the inputs. Furthermore, chaos theory finds structures and patterns within the output—like the fractal structures known as “strange attractors”. These patterns not only are not random, but they tell us about the internal mechanics of the system, and they tell us where to look “on average” for the system behavior.\n\nIn other words, chaos theory tames the chaos, and we no longer need to blame gods or the fates.\n\nHenri Poincare (1889)\n\nThe first glimpse of the inner workings of chaos was made by accident when Henri Poincaré responded to a mathematics competition held in honor of the King of Sweden. The challenge was to prove whether the solar system was absolutely stable, or whether there was a danger that one day the Earth would be flung from its orbit. Poincaré had already been thinking about the stability of dynamical systems so he wrote up his solution to the challenge and sent it in, believing that he had indeed proven that the solar system was stable.\n\nHis entry to the competition was the most convincing, so he was awarded the prize and instructed to submit the manuscript for publication. The paper was already at the printers and coming off the presses when Poincaré was asked by the competition organizer to check one last part of the proof which one of the reviewer’s had questioned relating to homoclinic orbits.\n\nTo Poincaré’s horror, as he checked his results against the reviewer’s comments, he found that he had made a fundamental error, and in fact the solar system would never be stable. The problem that he had overlooked had to do with the way that orbits can cross above or below each other on successive passes, leading to a tangle of orbital trajectories that crisscrossed each other in a fine mesh. This is known as the “homoclinic tangle”: it was the first glimpse that deterministic systems could lead to unpredictable results. Most importantly, he had developed the first mathematical tools that would be needed to analyze chaotic systems—such as the Poincaré section—but nearly half a century would pass before these tools would be picked up again.\n\nPoincaré paid out of his own pocket for the first printing to be destroyed and for the corrected version of his manuscript to be printed in its place [1]. No-one but the competition organizers and reviewers ever saw his first version. Yet it was when he was correcting his mistake that he stumbled on chaos for the first time, which is what posterity remembers him for. This little episode in the history of physics went undiscovered for a century before being brought to light by Barrow-Green in her 1997 book Poincaré and the Three Body Problem [2].\n\nCartwight and Littlewood (1945)\n\nDuring World War II, self-oscillations and nonlinear dynamics became strategic topics for the war effort in England. High-power magnetrons were driving long-range radar, keeping Britain alert to Luftwaffe bombing raids, and the tricky dynamics of these oscillators could be represented as a driven van der Pol oscillator. These oscillators had been studied in the 1920’s by the Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol (1889–1959) when he was completing his PhD thesis at the University of Utrecht on the topic of radio transmission through ionized gases. van der Pol had built a short-wave triode oscillator to perform experiments on radio diffraction to compare with his theoretical calculations of radio transmission. Van der Pol’s triode oscillator was an engineering feat that produced the shortest wavelengths of the day, making van der Pol intimately familiar with the operation of the oscillator, and he proposed a general form of differential equation for the triode oscillator.\n\nResearch on the radar magnetron led to theoretical work on driven nonlinear oscillators, including the discovery that a driven van der Pol oscillator could break up into wild and intermittent patterns. This “bad” behavior of the oscillator circuit (bad for radar applications) was the first discovery of chaotic behavior in man-made circuits.\n\nThese irregular properties of the driven van der Pol equation were studied by Mary- Lucy Cartwright (1990–1998) (the first woman to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society) and John Littlewood (1885–1977) at Cambridge who showed that the coexistence of two periodic solutions implied that discontinuously recurrent motion—in today’s parlance, chaos— could result, which was clearly undesirable for radar applications. The work of Cartwright and Littlewood [3] later inspired the work by Levinson and Smale as they introduced the field of nonlinear dynamics.\n\nAndrey Kolmogorov (1954)\n\nThe passing of the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin provided a long-needed opening for Soviet scientists to travel again to international conferences where they could meet with their western colleagues to exchange ideas. Four Russian mathematicians were allowed to attend the 1954 International Congress of Mathematics (ICM) held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One of those was Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903 – 1987) who was asked to give the closing plenary speech. Despite the isolation of Russia during the Soviet years before World War II and later during the Cold War, Kolmogorov was internationally renowned as one of the greatest mathematicians of his day.\n\nBy 1954, Kolmogorov’s interests had spread into topics in topology, turbulence and logic, but no one was prepared for the topic of his plenary lecture at the ICM in Amsterdam. Kolmogorov spoke on the dusty old topic of Hamiltonian mechanics. He even apologized at the start for speaking on such an old topic when everyone had expected him to speak on probability theory. Yet, in the length of only half an hour he laid out a bold and brilliant outline to a proof that the three-body problem had an infinity of stable orbits. Furthermore, these stable orbits provided impenetrable barriers to the diffusion of chaotic motion across the full phase space of the mechanical system. The crucial consequences of this short talk were lost on almost everyone who attended as they walked away after the lecture, but Kolmogorov had discovered a deep lattice structure that constrained the chaotic dynamics of the solar system.\n\nKolmogorov’s approach used a result from number theory that provides a measure of how close an irrational number is to a rational one. This is an important question for orbital dynamics, because whenever the ratio of two orbital periods is a ratio of integers, especially when the integers are small, then the two bodies will be in a state of resonance, which was the fundamental source of chaos in Poincaré’s stability analysis of the three-body problem. After Komogorov had boldly presented his results at the ICM of 1954 [4], what remained was the necessary mathematical proof of Kolmogorov’s daring conjecture. This would be provided by one of his students, V. I. Arnold, a decade later. But before the mathematicians could settle the issue, an atmospheric scientist, using one of the first electronic computers, rediscovered Poincaré’s tangle, this time in a simplified model of the atmosphere.\n\nEdward Lorenz (1963)\n\nIn 1960, with the help of a friend at MIT, the atmospheric scientist Edward Lorenz purchased a Royal McBee LGP-30 tabletop computer to make calculation of a simplified model he had derived for the weather. The McBee used 113 of the latest miniature vacuum tubes and also had 1450 of the new solid-state diodes made of semiconductors rather than tubes, which helped reduce the size further, as well as reducing heat generation. The McBee had a clock rate of 120 kHz and operated on 31-bit numbers with a 15 kB memory. Under full load it used 1500 Watts of power to run. But even with a computer in hand, the atmospheric equations needed to be simplified to make the calculations tractable. Lorenz simplified the number of atmospheric equations down to twelve, and he began programming his Royal McBee.\n\nProgress was good, and by 1961, he had completed a large initial numerical study. One day, as he was testing his results, he decided to save time by starting the computations midway by using mid-point results from a previous run as initial conditions. He typed in the three-digit numbers from a paper printout and went down the hall for a cup of coffee. When he returned, he looked at the printout of the twelve variables and was disappointed to find that they were not related to the previous full-time run. He immediately suspected a faulty vacuum tube, as often happened. But as he looked closer at the numbers, he realized that, at first, they tracked very well with the original run, but then began to diverge more and more rapidly until they lost all connection with the first-run numbers. The internal numbers of the McBee had a precision of 6 decimal points, but the printer only printed three to save time and paper. His initial conditions were correct to a part in a thousand, but this small error was magnified exponentially as the solution progressed. When he printed out the full six digits (the resolution limit for the machine), and used these as initial conditions, the original trajectory returned. There was no mistake. The McBee was working perfectly.\n\nAt this point, Lorenz recalled that he “became rather excited”. He was looking at a complete breakdown of predictability in atmospheric science. If radically different behavior arose from the smallest errors, then no measurements would ever be accurate enough to be useful for long-range forecasting. At a more fundamental level, this was a break with a long-standing tradition in science and engineering that clung to the belief that small differences produced small effects. What Lorenz had discovered, instead, was that the deterministic solution to his 12 equations was exponentially sensitive to initial conditions (known today as SIC).\n\nThe more Lorenz became familiar with the behavior of his equations, the more he felt that the 12-dimensional trajectories had a repeatable shape. He tried to visualize this shape, to get a sense of its character, but it is difficult to visualize things in twelve dimensions, and progress was slow, so he simplified his equations even further to three variables that could be represented in a three-dimensional graph [5].\n\nV. I. Arnold (1964)\n\nMeanwhile, back in Moscow, an energetic and creative young mathematics student knocked on Kolmogorov’s door looking for an advisor for his undergraduate thesis. The youth was Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (1937 – 2010), who showed promise, so Kolmogorov took him on as his advisee. They worked on the surprisingly complex properties of the mapping of a circle onto itself, which Arnold filed as his dissertation in 1959. The circle map holds close similarities with the periodic orbits of the planets, and this problem led Arnold down a path that drew tantalizingly close to Kolmogorov’s conjecture on Hamiltonian stability. Arnold continued in his PhD with Kolmogorov, solving Hilbert’s 13th problem by showing that every function of n variables can be represented by continuous functions of a single variable. Arnold was appointed as an assistant in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University.\n\nArnold’s habilitation topic was Kolmogorov’s conjecture, and his approach used the same circle map that had played an important role in solving Hilbert’s 13th problem. Kolmogorov neither encouraged nor discouraged Arnold to tackle his conjecture. Arnold was led to it independently by the similarity of the stability problem with the problem of continuous functions. In reference to his shift to this new topic for his habilitation, Arnold stated “The mysterious interrelations between different branches of mathematics with seemingly no connections are still an enigma for me.” [6]\n\nArnold began with the problem of attracting and repelling fixed points in the circle map and made a fundamental connection to the theory of invariant properties of action-angle variables . These provided a key element in the proof of Kolmogorov’s conjecture. In late 1961, Arnold submitted his results to the leading Soviet physics journal—which promptly rejected it because he used forbidden terms for the journal, such as “theorem” and “proof”, and he had used obscure terminology that would confuse their usual physicist readership, terminology such as “Lesbesgue measure”, “invariant tori” and “Diophantine conditions”. Arnold withdrew the paper.\n\nArnold later incorporated an approach pioneered by Jurgen Moser [7] and published a definitive article on the problem of small divisors in 1963 [8]. The combined work of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser had finally established the stability of irrational orbits in the three-body problem, the most irrational and hence most stable orbit having the frequency of the golden mean. The term “KAM theory”, using the first initials of the three theorists, was coined in 1968 by B. V. Chirikov, who also introduced in 1969 what has become known as the Chirikov map (also known as the Standard map ) that reduced the abstract circle maps of Arnold and Moser to simple iterated functions that any student can program easily on a computer to explore KAM invariant tori and the onset of Hamiltonian chaos, as in Fig. 1 [9].\n\nSephen Smale (1967)\n\nStephen Smale was at the end of a post-graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation when he went to Rio to work with Mauricio Peixoto. Smale and Peixoto had met in Princeton in 1960 where Peixoto was working with Solomon Lefschetz (1884 – 1972) who had an interest in oscillators that sustained their oscillations in the absence of a periodic force. For instance, a pendulum clock driven by the steady force of a hanging weight is a self-sustained oscillator. Lefschetz was building on work by the Russian Aleksandr A. Andronov (1901 – 1952) who worked in the secret science city of Gorky in the 1930’s on nonlinear self-oscillations using Poincaré’s first return map. The map converted the continuous trajectories of dynamical systems into discrete numbers, simplifying problems of feedback and control.\n\nThe central question of mechanical control systems, even self-oscillating systems, was how to attain stability. By combining approaches of Poincaré and Lyapunov, as well as developing their own techniques, the Gorky school became world leaders in the theory and applications of nonlinear oscillations. Andronov published a seminal textbook in 1937 The Theory of Oscillations with his colleagues Vitt and Khaykin, and Lefschetz had obtained and translated the book into English in 1947, introducing it to the West. When Peixoto returned to Rio, his interest in nonlinear oscillations captured the imagination of Smale even though his main mathematical focus was on problems of topology. On the beach in Rio, Smale had an idea that topology could help prove whether systems had a finite number of periodic points. Peixoto had already proven this for two dimensions, but Smale wanted to find a more general proof for any number of dimensions.\n\nNorman Levinson (1912 – 1975) at MIT became aware of Smale’s interests and sent off a letter to Rio in which he suggested that Smale should look at Levinson’s work on the triode self-oscillator (a van der Pol oscillator), as well as the work of Cartwright and Littlewood who had discovered quasi-periodic behavior hidden within the equations. Smale was puzzled but intrigued by Levinson’s paper that had no drawings or visualization aids, so he started scribbling curves on paper that bent back upon themselves in ways suggested by the van der Pol dynamics. During a visit to Berkeley later that year, he presented his preliminary work, and a colleague suggested that the curves looked like strips that were being stretched and bent into a horseshoe.\n\nSmale latched onto this idea, realizing that the strips were being successively stretched and folded under the repeated transformation of the dynamical equations. Furthermore, because dynamics can move forward in time as well as backwards, there was a sister set of horseshoes that were crossing the original set at right angles. As the dynamics proceeded, these two sets of horseshoes were repeatedly stretched and folded across each other, creating an infinite latticework of intersections that had the properties of the Cantor set. Here was solid proof that Smale’s original conjecture was wrong—the dynamics had an infinite number of periodicities, and they were nested in self-similar patterns in a latticework of points that map out a Cantor-like set of points. In the two-dimensional case, shown in the figure, the fractal dimension of this lattice is D = ln4/ln3 = 1.26, somewhere in dimensionality between a line and a plane. Smale’s infinitely nested set of periodic points was the same tangle of points that Poincaré had noticed while he was correcting his King Otto Prize manuscript. Smale, using modern principles of topology, was finally able to put rigorous mathematical structure to Poincaré’s homoclinic tangle. Coincidentally, Poincaré had launched the modern field of topology, so in a sense he sowed the seeds to the solution to his own problem.\n\nRuelle and Takens (1971)\n\nThe onset of turbulence was an iconic problem in nonlinear physics with a long history and a long list of famous researchers studying it. As far back as the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci had made detailed studies of water cascades, sketching whorls upon whorls in charcoal in his famous notebooks. Heisenberg, oddly, wrote his PhD dissertation on the topic of turbulence even while he was inventing quantum mechanics on the side. Kolmogorov in the 1940’s applied his probabilistic theories to turbulence, and this statistical approach dominated most studies up to the time when David Ruelle and Floris Takens published a paper in 1971 that took a nonlinear dynamics approach to the problem rather than statistical, identifying strange attractors in the nonlinear dynamical Navier-Stokes equations [10]. This paper coined the phrase “strange attractor”. One of the distinct characteristics of their approach was the identification of a bifurcation cascade. A single bifurcation means a sudden splitting of an orbit when a parameter is changed slightly. In contrast, a bifurcation cascade was not just a single Hopf bifurcation, as seen in earlier nonlinear models, but was a succession of Hopf bifurcations that doubled the period each time, so that period-two attractors became period-four attractors, then period-eight and so on, coming fast and faster, until full chaos emerged. A few years later Gollub and Swinney experimentally verified the cascade route to turbulence , publishing their results in 1975 [11].\n\nFeigenbaum (1978)\n\nIn 1976, computers were not common research tools, although hand-held calculators now were. One of the most famous of this era was the Hewlett-Packard HP-65, and Feigenbaum pushed it to its limits. He was particularly interested in the bifurcation cascade of the logistic map [12]—the way that bifurcations piled on top of bifurcations in a forking structure that showed increasing detail at increasingly fine scales. Feigenbaum was, after all, a high-energy theorist and had overlapped at Cornell with Kenneth Wilson when he was completing his seminal work on the renormalization group approach to scaling phenomena. Feigenbaum recognized a strong similarity between the bifurcation cascade and the ideas of real-space renormalization where smaller and smaller boxes were used to divide up space.\n\nOne of the key steps in the renormalization procedure was the need to identify a ratio of the sizes of smaller structures to larger structures. Feigenbaum began by studying how the bifurcations depended on the increasing growth rate. He calculated the threshold values rm for each of the bifurcations, and then took the ratios of the intervals, comparing the previous interval (rm-1 – rm-2) to the next interval (rm – rm-1). This procedure is like the well-known method to calculate the golden ratio = 1.61803 from the Fibonacci series, and Feigenbaum might have expected the golden ratio to emerge from his analysis of the logistic map. After all, the golden ratio has a scary habit of showing up in physics, just like in the KAM theory. However, as the bifurcation index m increased in Feigenbaum’s study, this ratio settled down to a limiting value of 4.66920. Then he did what anyone would do with an unfamiliar number that emerges from a physical calculation—he tried to see if it was a combination of other fundamental numbers, like pi and Euler’s constant e, and even the golden ratio. But none of these worked. He had found a new number that had universal application to chaos theory [13].\n\nGleick (1987)\n\nBy the mid-1980’s, chaos theory was seeping in to a broadening range of research topics that seemed to span the full breadth of science, from biology to astrophysics, from mechanics to chemistry. A particularly active group of chaos practitioners were J. Doyn Farmer, James Crutchfield, Norman Packard and Robert Shaw who founded the Dynamical Systems Collective at the University of California, Santa Cruz. One of the important outcomes of their work was a method to reconstruct the state space of a complex system using only its representative time series [14]. Their work helped proliferate the techniques of chaos theory into the mainstream. Many who started using these techniques were only vaguely aware of its long history until the science writer James Gleick wrote a best-selling history of the subject that brought chaos theory to the forefront of popular science [15]. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBy David D. Nolte, April 3, 2024\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Poincaré, H. and D. L. Goroff (1993). New methods of celestial mechanics.

For small perturbation ε, two fixed points appear along the line J = 0 corresponding to p/q = 1: one is an elliptical point (with surrounding small orbits) and the other is a hyperbolic point where chaotic behavior is first observed. With increasing perturbation, q elliptical points and q hyperbolic points emerge for orbits with winding numbers p/q with small denominators (1/2, 1/3, 2/3 etc.). Other orbits with larger q are warped by the increasing perturbation but are not chaotic. These orbits reside on invariant tori, known as the KAM tori, that do not disintegrate into chaos at small perturbation. The set of KAM tori is a Cantor-like set with non- zero measure, ensuring that stable behavior can survive in the presence of perturbations, such as perturbation of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun by Jupiter. However, with increasing perturbation, orbits with successively larger values of q disintegrate into chaos. The last orbits to survive in the Standard Map are the golden mean orbits with p/q = φ–1 and p/q = 2–φ. The critical value of the perturbation required for the golden mean orbits to disintegrate into chaos is surprisingly large at εc = 0.97.\n\n[10] Ruelle,D. and F.Takens (1971).“OntheNatureofTurbulence.”Communications in Mathematical Physics 20(3): 167–92.\n\n[11] Gollub, J.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1907 for the invention of his eponymous interferometer and for its development as a precision tool for metrology. On board ship traveling to Sweden from London to receive his medal, he was insulted by the British author Rudyard Kipling (that year’s Nobel Laureate in literature) who quipped that America was filled with ignorant masses who wouldn’t amount to anything.\n\nNotwithstanding Kipling’s prediction, across the following century, Americans were awarded 96 Nobel prizes in physics. The next closest nationalities were Germany with 28, the United Kingdom with 25 and France with 18. These are ratios of 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1. Why was the United States so dominant, and why was Rudyard Kipling so wrong?\n\nAt the same time that American scientists were garnering the lion’s share of Nobel prizes in physics in the 20th century, the American real (inflation-adjusted) gross-domestic-product (GDP) grew from 60 billion dollars to 20 trillion dollars, making up about a third of the world-wide GDP, even though it has only about 5% of the world population. So once again, why was the United States so dominant across the last century? What factors contributed to this success?\n\nThe answers are complicated, with many contributing factors and lots of shades of gray. But two factors stand out that grew hand-in-hand over the century; these are:\n\n1) The striking rise of American elite universities, and\n\n2) The significant gain in the US brain trust through immigration\n\nAlbert Michelson is a case in point.\n\nThe Firestorms of Albert Michelson\n\nAlbert Abraham Michelson was, to some, an undesirable immigrant, born poor in Poland to a Jewish family who made the arduous journey through the Panama Canal in the second wave of 49ers swarming over the California gold country. Michelson grew up in the Wild West, first in the rough town of Murphy’s Camp in California, in foothills of the Sierras. After his father’s supply store went up in flames, they moved to Virginia City, Nevada. His younger brother Charlie lived by the gun (after Michelson had left home), providing meat and protection for supply trains during the Apache wars in the Southwest. This was America in the raw.\n\nYet Michelson was a prodigy. He outgrew the meager educational possibilities in the mining towns, so his family scraped together enough money to send him to a school in San Francisco, where he excelled. Later, in Virginia City, an academic competition was held for a special appointment to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and Michelson tied for first place, but the appointment went to the other student who was the son of a Civil War Vet.\n\nWith the support of the local Jewish community, Michelson took a train to Washington DC (traveling on the newly-completed Transcontinental Railway, passing over the spot where a golden spike had been driven one month prior into a railroad tie made of Californian laurel) to make his case directly. He met with President Grant at the White House, but all the slots at Annapolis had been filled. Undaunted, Michelson camped out for three days in the waiting room of the office of an Annapolis Admiral, who finally relented and allowed Michelson to take the entrance exam. Still, there was no place for him at the Academy.\n\nDiscouraged, Michelson bought a ticket and boarded the train for home. One can only imagine his shock when he heard his name called out by a someone walking down the car aisle."
