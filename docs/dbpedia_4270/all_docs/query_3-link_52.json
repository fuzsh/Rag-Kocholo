        "text": "We prove that smooth enough invariant curves of monotone twist maps of an annulus with fixed diophantine rotation number depend on the map in a differentiable way. Partial results hold for Aubry-Mather sets.Then we show that invariant curves of the same map with different rotation numbers ω and ω′ cannot approach each other at a distance less than cst. |ω−ω′|. By K.A.M. theory, this implies that, under suitable assumptions, the union of invariant curves has positive measure.Analogous results are due to Zehnder and Herman (for the first part), and to Lazutkin and Pöschel (for the second one), in the case of Hamiltonian systems and area preserving maps."
