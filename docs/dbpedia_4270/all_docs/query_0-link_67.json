This study offers an alternative presentation regarding\nhow diurnal precipitation is modulated by convective events that developed\nover the central Amazon during the preceding nighttime period. We use data\ncollected during the Observations and Modelling of the Green Ocean Amazon\n(GoAmazonÂ 2014/2015) field campaign that took place from 1Â JanuaryÂ 2014\nto 30Â NovemberÂ 2015 in the central Amazon. Local surface-based\nobservations of cloud occurrence, soil temperature, surface fluxes, and\nplanetary boundary layer characteristics are coupled with satellite data to\nidentify the physical mechanisms that control the diurnal rainfall in\ncentral Amazon during the wet and dry seasons. This is accomplished through\nevaluation of the atmospheric properties during the nocturnal periods\npreceding raining and non-raining events. Comparisons between these\nnon-raining and raining transitions are presented for the wet (January to\nApril) and dry (June to September) seasons. The results suggest that\nwet-season diurnal precipitation is modulated by nighttime cloud coverage and\nlocal influences such as heating induced turbulence, whereas the dry-season\nrain events are controlled by large-scale circulations.",

Weather radar echoes from the DCCs are tracked to evaluate their lifecycle. The DCC size and intensity increase, reach a peak, and then decrease over the DCC lifetime. Vertical profiles of air motion and mass transport from different seasons are examined to understand the transport of energy and momentum within DCC cores and to address the deficiencies in simulating DCCs using weather and climate models.\n\nThermal-Driven Graupel Generation Process to Explain Dry-Season Convective Vigor over the Amazon\n\nToshi Matsui, Daniel Hernandez-Deckers, Scott Giangrande, Thiago Biscaro, Ann Fridlind, and Scott Braun\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing computer simulations and real measurements, we discovered that during the dry periods, storms were narrower but more intense, producing heavier rain and more ice particles in the clouds. Our research showed that cumulus bubbles played a key role in creating these intense storms. This study can improve how continental and ocean environments affect tropical regions' rainfall patterns.\n\nSeasonal controls on isolated convective storm drafts, precipitation intensity, and life cycle as observed during GoAmazon2014/5\n\nScott E.

We couple this precipitation tracking with opportunistic overpasses of a wind profiler and other ground observations to add unique insights into the upwards and downwards air motions within these clouds at various stages in the storm life cycle. The results of a simple updraft model are provided to give physical explanations for observed seasonal differences.\n\nX-band dual-polarization radar-based hydrometeor classification for Brazilian tropical precipitation systems\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois Ribaud, Luiz Augusto Toledo Machado, and Thiago Biscaro\n\nAtmos.

Overall the stratiform regions are composed of five hydrometeor classes: drizzle, rain, wet snow, aggregates, and ice crystals, whereas convective echoes are generally associated with light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, graupel, aggregates and ice crystals.\n\nCausal Analysis of Aerosol Impacts on Isolated Deep Convection: Findings from TRACER\n\nDiÃ© Wang, Roni Kobrosly, Tao Zhang, Tamanna Subba, Susan van den Heever, Siddhant Gupta, and Michael Jensen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2436,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2436, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new method to understand how tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, affect rain clouds in the Houston-Galveston area. Aerosols generally do not make these clouds grow much taller, with an average height increase of about 1 km under certain conditions. However, their effects on rainfall strength and cloud expansion are less certain. Clouds influenced by sea breezes show a stronger aerosol impact, possibly due to unaccounted factors like vertical winds in near-surface layers.\n\nHow rainfall events modify trace gas mixing ratios in central Amazonia\n\nLuiz A.

The analysis helps us to understand the sources and sinks of trace gases within a forest ecosystem. It elucidates processes that are not discernible under undisturbed conditions and contributes to a deeper understanding of the trace gas life cycle and its intricate interactions with cloud dynamics in the Amazon.\n\nLifecycle of updrafts and mass flux in isolated deep convection over the Amazon rainforest: insights from cell tracking\n\nSiddhant Gupta, DiÃ© Wang, Scott E.

The results showed characteristic arrangements regarding seasonal and diurnal cycles, as well as when interacting with precipitation. The use of this 3D space appears to be a promising tool for aerosol population analysis and for model validation and parameterization.\n\nThermal-Driven Graupel Generation Process to Explain Dry-Season Convective Vigor over the Amazon\n\nToshi Matsui, Daniel Hernandez-Deckers, Scott Giangrande, Thiago Biscaro, Ann Fridlind, and Scott Braun\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing computer simulations and real measurements, we discovered that during the dry periods, storms were narrower but more intense, producing heavier rain and more ice particles in the clouds.

We examined the processes that drive the aerosol population and distribution in the lower troposphere over the SGP. This study helps improve our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and the model representation of aerosol processes.\n\nSeasonal controls on isolated convective storm drafts, precipitation intensity, and life cycle as observed during GoAmazon2014/5\n\nScott E.

Williams, Joshua Barrio, Paul E. Johnston, Paytsar Muradyan, and Scott E. Giangrande\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 2381–2398, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2381-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2381-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses surface disdrometer observations to calibrate 8 years of 915 MHz radar wind profiler deployed in the central United States in northern Oklahoma. This study had two key findings. First, the radar wind profiler sensitivity decreased approximately 3 to 4 dB/year as the hardware aged. Second, this drift was slow enough that calibration can be performed using 3-month intervals. Calibrated radar wind profiler observations and Python processing code are available on public repositories.\n\nOccurrence and growth of sub-50 nm aerosol particles in the Amazonian boundary layer\n\nMarco A.

Instead, there is the appearance of sub-50 nm aerosols with diameters larger than about 20 nm that eventually grow to cloud condensation nuclei size range. Here, 254 growth events were characterized which have higher predominance in the wet season. About 70 % of them showed direct relation to convective downdrafts, while 30 % occurred partly under clear-sky conditions, evidencing still unknown particle sources.\n\nHow weather events modify aerosol particle size distributions in the Amazon boundary layer\n\nLuiz A.

This study evaluates the effect of weather events on the particle size distribution at the ATTO, combining remote sensing and in situ data. Ultrafine, Aitken and accumulation particles modes have different behaviors for the diurnal cycle and for rainfall events. This study opens up new scientific questions that need to be pursued in detail in new field campaigns.\n\nCloud droplet formation at the base of tropical convective clouds: closure between modeling and measurement results of ACRIDICONâCHUVA\n\nRamon Campos Braga, Barbara Ervens, Daniel Rosenfeld, Meinrat O.

Properties of aerosol particles control their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Using aerosol measurements in the Amazon, we performed model studies to compare predicted and measured cloud droplet number concentrations at cloud bases. Our results confirm previous estimates of particle hygroscopicity in this region.\n\nContrasting characteristics of open- and closed-cellular stratocumulus cloud in the eastern North Atlantic\n\nMichael P. Jensen, Virendra P. Ghate, DiÃ© Wang, Diana K. Apoznanski, Mary J. Bartholomew, Scott E. Giangrande, Karen L. Johnson, and Mandana M. Thieman\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14557–14571, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14557-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14557-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work compares the large-scale meteorology, cloud, aerosol, precipitation, and thermodynamics of closed- and open-cell cloud organizations using long-term observations from the astern North Atlantic. Open-cell cases are associated with cold-air outbreaks and occur in deeper boundary layers, with stronger winds and higher rain rates compared to closed-cell cases. These results offer important benchmarks for model representation of boundary layer clouds in this climatically important region.\n\nMorning boundary layer conditions for shallow to deep convective cloud evolution during the dry season in the central Amazon\n\nAlice Henkes, Gilberto Fisch, Luiz A. T. Machado, and Jean-Pierre Chaboureau\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13207–13225, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13207-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13207-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Amazonian boundary layer is investigated during the dry season in order to better understand the processes that occur between night and day until the stage where shallow cumulus clouds become deep. Observations show that shallow to deep clouds are characterized by a shorter morning transition stage (e.g., the time needed to eliminate the stable boundary layer inversion), while higher humidity above the boundary layer favors the evolution from shallow to deep cumulus clouds.\n\nVertical profiles of trace gas and aerosol properties over the eastern North Atlantic: variations with season and synoptic condition\n\nYang Wang, Guangjie Zheng, Michael P.

We examined the key processes that drive the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) population and how it varies with season and synoptic conditions. This study helps improve the model representation of the aerosol processes in the remote MBL, reducing the simulated aerosol indirect effects.\n\nIdentifying insects, clouds, and precipitation using vertically pointing polarimetric radar Doppler velocity spectra\n\nChristopher R. Williams, Karen L. Johnson, Scott E. Giangrande, Joseph C. Hardin, RuÅen Ãktem, and David M. Romps\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4425–4444, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4425-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4425-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn addition to detecting clouds, vertically pointing cloud radars detect individual insects passing over head. If these insects are not identified and removed from raw observations, then radar-derived cloud properties will be contaminated. This work identifies clouds in radar observations due to their continuous and smooth structure in time, height, and velocity. Cloud masks are produced that identify cloud vertical structure that are free of insect contamination.\n\nThe development of rainfall retrievals from radar at Darwin\n\nRobert Jackson, Scott Collis, Valentin Louf, Alain Protat, Die Wang, Scott Giangrande, Elizabeth J. Thompson, Brenda Dolan, and Scott W. Powell\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 53–69, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-53-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-53-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbout 4 years of 2D video disdrometer data in Darwin are used to develop and validate rainfall retrievals for tropical convection in C- and X-band radars in Darwin. Using blended techniques previously used for Colorado and Manus and Gan islands, with modified coefficients in each estimator, provided the most optimal results. Using multiple radar observables to develop a rainfall retrieval provided a greater advantage than using a single observable, including using specific attenuation.\n\nRadiative heating rate profiles over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during the 2016 and 2017 biomass burning seasons\n\nAllison B. Marquardt Collow, Mark A. Miller, Lynne C. Trabachino, Michael P. Jensen, and Meng Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 10073–10090, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10073-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10073-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUncertainties in marine boundary layer clouds arise in the presence of biomass burning aerosol, as is the case over the southeast Atlantic Ocean. Heating due to this aerosol has the potential to alter the thermodynamic profile as the aerosol is transported across the Atlantic Ocean. Radiation transfer experiments indicate local shortwave aerosol heating is ~2–8 K d−1; however uncertainties in this quantity exist due to the single-scattering albedo and back trajectories of the aerosol plume.\n\nCloud regimes over the Amazon Basin: perspectives from the GoAmazon2014/5 campaign\n\nScott E. Giangrande, DiÃ© Wang, and David B. Mechem\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7489–7507, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7489-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7489-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Amazon basin experiences prolific and diverse cloud conditions that are strongly influenced by (and influence via feedbacks) seasonal shifts in the local conditions and larger-scale atmospheric circulations. The primary atmospheric regimes observed during a heavily instrumented 2-year Amazon deployment are classified. We assess the potential atmospheric controls on convective clouds, precipitation, and the propensity for these regimes to promote extremes in precipitation.\n\nInflux of African biomass burning aerosol during the Amazonian dry season through layered transatlantic transport of black carbon-rich smoke\n\nBruna A.

The combination of in situ aircraft and ground-based measurements aided by satellite observations showed that these layers are transported into the Amazon Basin during the early dry season. The influx of aged smoke, enriched in black carbon and cloud condensation nuclei, has important implications for the Amazonian aerosol and cloud cycling.\n\nComparison of aircraft measurements during GoAmazon2014/5 and ACRIDICON-CHUVA\n\nFan Mei, Jian Wang, Jennifer M.

This paper describes how to meaningfully compare similar measurements from two research aircraft and identify the potential measurement issue. We also discuss the uncertainty range for each measurement for further usage in model evaluation and satellite data validation.\n\nQuantifying the aerosol effect on droplet size distribution at cloud top\n\nLianet HernÃ¡ndez Pardo, Luiz Augusto Toledo Machado, Micael Amore Cecchini, and Madeleine SÃ¡nchez GÃ¡cita\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 7839–7857, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-7839-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-7839-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work analyzes the effects of changes in the environmental aerosol population on Amazonian clouds. The results confirm that the clouds can be very sensitive to changes in the aerosol properties, but the relative importance of each property is variable and depends on the values of the other aerosol characteristics, especially aerosol size. This is controlled by the degree to which the cloud mixes with the surrounding air and by the efficiency with which aerosols are consumed by droplets.\n\nUse of polarimetric radar measurements to constrain simulated convective cell evolution: a pilot study with Lagrangian tracking\n\nAnn M. Fridlind, Marcus van Lier-Walqui, Scott Collis, Scott E. Giangrande, Robert C. Jackson, Xiaowen Li, Toshihisa Matsui, Richard Orville, Mark H. Picel, Daniel Rosenfeld, Alexander Ryzhkov, Richard Weitz, and Pengfei Zhang\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 2979–3000, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2979-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2979-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWeather radars are offering improved capabilities to investigate storm physics, which remain poorly understood. We investigate enhanced use of such data near Houston, Texas, where pollution sources often provide a convenient contrast between polluted and clean air. We conclude that Houston is a favorable location to conduct a future field campaign during June through September because isolated storms are common and tend to last an hour, allowing frequent observations of a full life cycle.\n\nX-band dual-polarization radar-based hydrometeor classification for Brazilian tropical precipitation systems\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois Ribaud, Luiz Augusto Toledo Machado, and Thiago Biscaro\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 811–837, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-811-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-811-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe dominant hydrometeor types associated with Brazilian tropical precipitation systems are identified for the Amazon region during both the wet and dry seasons. Overall the stratiform regions are composed of five hydrometeor classes: drizzle, rain, wet snow, aggregates, and ice crystals, whereas convective echoes are generally associated with light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, graupel, aggregates and ice crystals.\n\nMarine boundary layer aerosol in the eastern North Atlantic: seasonal variations and key controlling processes\n\nGuangjie Zheng, Yang Wang, Allison C. Aiken, Francesca Gallo, Michael P. Jensen, Pavlos Kollias, Chongai Kuang, Edward Luke, Stephen Springston, Janek Uin, Robert Wood, and Jian Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17615–17635, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17615-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17615-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we elucidate the key processes that drive marine boundary layer (MBL) aerosol size distribution in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) using long-term measurements. The governing equations of particle concentration are established for different modes. Particles entrained from the free troposphere represent the major source of MBL cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), contributing both directly to CCN population and indirectly by supplying Aitken-mode particles that grow to CCN in the MBL.\n\nAircraft observations of the chemical composition and aging of aerosol in the Manaus urban plume during GoAmazon 2014/5\n\nJohn E.

We observe dynamic changes in the organic aerosol. The mean carbon oxidation state of the OA increases from −0.6 to −0.45. Hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) mass is lost and is balanced out by formation of oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). Because HOA loss is balanced by OOA formation, we observe little change in the net Δorg / ΔCO values with aging.\n\nAfrican volcanic emissions influencing atmospheric aerosols over the Amazon rain forest\n\nJorge Saturno, Florian Ditas, Marloes Penning de Vries, Bruna A.

Aircraft and ground-based observations are used to characterize the influence of volcanogenic aerosol on the chemical and microphysical properties of Amazonian aerosols. Further, this work is an illustrative example of the conditions and dynamics driving the transatlantic transport of African emissions to South America.\n\nObservations of sesquiterpenes and their oxidation products in central Amazonia during the wet and dry seasons\n\nLindsay D.

We collected filter samples and deployed a semi-volatile thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph in the central Amazon. We measured 30 sesquiterpenes and 4 diterpenes and find them to be important for reactive ozone loss. We estimate that sesquiterpene oxidation contributes at least 0.4–5 % (median 1 %) of observed submicron organic aerosol mass.\n\nThe Green Ocean: precipitation insights from the GoAmazon2014/5 experiment\n\nDie Wang, Scott E.

For the cirrus, retrieved particle effective radius are validated with corresponding in situ data using a vertical weighting method. This approach allows to assess the measurements, retrieval algorithms, and derived cloud products.\n\nCloud-top microphysics evolution in the Gamma phase space from a modeling perspective\n\nLianet HernÃ¡ndez Pardo, Luiz Augusto Toledo Machado, and Micael Amore Cecchini\n\nAtmos.

We found extremely high concentrations of very small particles in the region between 8 and 14 km altitude all across the basin, which had been recently formed by gas-to-particle conversion at these altitudes. This makes the upper troposphere a very important source region of atmospheric particles with significant implications for the Earth's climate system.\n\nIllustration of microphysical processes in Amazonian deep convective clouds in the gamma phase space: introduction and potential applications\n\nMicael A.

This space is able to represent all possible variations in the cloud droplet size distributions (DSDs). The methodology was applied to recent in situ aircraft measurements over the Amazon. It is shown that the phase space is able to represent several processes occurring in the clouds in a simple manner. The consequences for cloud studies, modeling, and the representation of the transition from warm to mixed phase are discussed.\n\nCloud characteristics, thermodynamic controls and radiative impacts during the Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5) experiment\n\nScott E.

We expand the sensitivity analysis usually found in the literature by concomitantly considering cloud evolution and the effects on droplet size distribution (DSD) shape. The quantitative results show that particle concentration is the primary driver for the vertical profiles of effective diameter and droplet concentration in the warm phase of Amazonian convective clouds.\n\nVertical air motion retrievals in deep convective clouds using the ARM scanning radar network in Oklahoma during MC3E\n\nKirk W.

A typical jump in the GPS-PWV values before the occurrence of more intense rainfalls has been found, it is probably related to humid convergence occurring before intense rainfall events.

The morning propagating convective systems are active during the wet season but rare during the dry season. The afternoon convections are active in both seasons, with heating and moistening in the lower level corresponding to the vertical convergence of eddy fluxes.

Tech., 9, 3115–3129, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-3115-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-3115-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn intercomparison of Vaisala's latest-generation radiosonde RS41 and the widely used RS92 was performed in north-central Oklahoma, USA, during June 2014. The results indicate that for the conditions observed during the intercomparison the measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, and winds agree to within the manufacturer-specified combined uncertainties. Some important exceptions were noted when exiting liquid cloud layers where evaporative cooling has less impact for RS41 measurements.\n\nImpacts of the Manaus pollution plume on the microphysical properties of Amazonian warm-phase clouds in the wet season\n\nMicael A. Cecchini, Luiz A. T. Machado, Jennifer M. Comstock, Fan Mei, Jian Wang, Jiwen Fan, Jason M. Tomlinson, Beat Schmid, Rachel Albrecht, Scot T. Martin, and Paulo Artaxo\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 7029–7041, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7029-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7029-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work focuses on the analysis of anthropogenic impacts on Amazonian clouds. The experiment was conducted around Manaus (Brazil), which is a city with 2 million inhabitants and is surrounded by the Amazon forest in every direction. The clouds that form over the pristine atmosphere of the forest are understood as the background clouds and the ones that form over the city pollution are the anthropogenically impacted ones. The paper analyses microphysical characteristics of both types of clouds.\n\nIntroduction: Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5)\n\nS. T. Martin, P. Artaxo, L. A. T.

The experiment focused on the complex links among vegetation, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol production on the one hand and their connections to aerosols, clouds, and precipitation on the other, especially when altered by urban pollution. This article serves as an introduction to the special issue of publications presenting findings of this experiment.\n\nInfluence of biomass aerosol on precipitation over the Central Amazon: an observational study\n\nW.

This manuscript describes the details of the MC3E radiosonde operations including the instrumentation, data processing and analysis of the impacts of bias correction and algorithm assumptions on the determination of forcing data sets.\n\nRelated subject area\n\nSubject: Clouds and Precipitation | Research Activity: Field Measurements | Altitude Range: Troposphere | Science Focus: Physics (physical properties and processes)\n\nObservability of moisture transport divergence in Arctic atmospheric rivers by dropsondes\n\nHenning Dorff, Heike Konow, Vera Schemann, and Felix Ament\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8771–8795, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8771-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8771-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing synthetic dropsondes, we assess how discrete spatial sampling and temporal evolution during flight affect the accuracy of real sonde-based moisture transport divergence in Arctic atmospheric rivers (ARs). Non-instantaneous sampling during temporal AR evolution deteriorates the divergence values more than spatial undersampling. Moisture advection is the dominating factor but most sensitive to the sampling method. We suggest a minimum of seven sondes to resolve the AR divergence components.\n\nElucidating the boundary layer turbulence dissipation rate using high-resolution measurements from a radar wind profiler network over the Tibetan Plateau\n\nDeli Meng, Jianping Guo, Xiaoran Guo, Yinjun Wang, Ning Li, Yuping Sun, Zhen Zhang, Na Tang, Haoran Li, Fan Zhang, Bing Tong, Hui Xu, and Tianmeng Chen\n\nAtmos.

Here we elucidate the vertical profile of and temporal variation in the turbulence dissipation rate in the PBL over the TP based on a radar wind profiler (RWP) network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the turbulence profile over the whole TP has been revealed. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of clouds acting on the PBL turbulence structure are investigated.\n\nEnvironmental controls on isolated convection during the Amazonian wet season\n\nLeandro Alex Moreira Viscardi, Giuseppe Torri, David K. Adams, and Henrique de Melo Jorge Barbosa\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Days with rain clouds begin with more moisture in the air and have strong convergence in the afternoon, while precipitation intensity increases with large-scale vertical velocity, moisture, and low-level wind. These results contribute to understanding how clouds form over the rainforest.\n\nIsotopic composition of convective rainfall in the inland tropics of Brazil\n\nVinicius dos Santos, Didier Gastmans, Ana MarÃ­a DurÃ¡n-Quesada, Ricardo SÃ¡nchez-Murillo, Kazimierz Rozanski, Oliver Kracht, and Demilson de Assis QuintÃ£o\n\nAtmos.

We found the tallest clouds in the afternoon and much smaller clouds at night, resulting in differences in day–night ratios in water stable isotopes. We sampled rain and meteorological variables every 5–10 min, allowing us to evaluate the development of convective rainfall, contributing to knowledge of rainfall related to extreme events.\n\nMeasurement report: Cloud and environmental properties associated with aggregated shallow marine cumulus and cumulus congestus\n\nEwan Crosbie, Luke D.

While clustering is also a feature of deep storm clouds, we focus on smaller cloud systems associated with fair weather and brief localized showers. Two aircraft sampled the region around these shallow systems: one incorporated measurements taken within, adjacent to, and below the clouds, while the other provided a survey from above using remote sensing techniques.\n\nLifecycle of updrafts and mass flux in isolated deep convection over the Amazon rainforest: insights from cell tracking\n\nSiddhant Gupta, DiÃ© Wang, Scott E. Giangrande, Thiago S. Biscaro, and Michael P. Jensen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Weather radar echoes from the DCCs are tracked to evaluate their lifecycle. The DCC size and intensity increase, reach a peak, and then decrease over the DCC lifetime. Vertical profiles of air motion and mass transport from different seasons are examined to understand the transport of energy and momentum within DCC cores and to address the deficiencies in simulating DCCs using weather and climate models.\n\nThermodynamic and cloud evolution in a cold-air outbreak during HALO-(AC)3: quasi-Lagrangian observations compared to the ERA5 and CARRA reanalyses\n\nBenjamin Kirbus, Imke Schirmacher, Marcus Klingebiel, Michael SchÃ¤fer, AndrÃ© Ehrlich, Nils SlÃ¤ttberg, Johannes Lucke, Manuel Moser, Hanno MÃ¼ller, and Manfred Wendisch\n\nAtmos.

The measurements are compared to two reanalysis models named ERA5 and CARRA. The biggest differences are found for air temperature over the sea ice and moisture over the ocean. CARRA data are more accurate than ERA5 because they better simulate the sea ice, the transition from sea ice to open ocean, and the forming clouds.\n\nPowering aircraft with 100 % sustainable aviation fuel reduces ice crystals in contrails\n\nRaphael Satoru MÃ¤rkl, Christiane Voigt, Daniel Sauer, Rebecca Katharina Dischl, Stefan Kaufmann, Theresa HarlaÃ, Valerian Hahn, Anke Roiger, Cornelius WeiÃ-Rehm, Ulrike Burkhardt, Ulrich Schumann, Andreas Marsing, Monika Scheibe, Andreas DÃ¶rnbrack, Charles Renard, Maxime Gauthier, Peter Swann, Paul Madden, Darren Luff, Reetu Sallinen, Tobias Schripp, and Patrick Le Clercq\n\nAtmos.

Results from a climate model initialized with the observations suggest a significant decrease in radiative forcing from contrails. Our study confirms that future increased use of low aromatic SAF can reduce the climate impact from aviation.\n\nDrivers of Droplet Formation in East Mediterranean Orographic Clouds\n\nRomanos Foskinis, Ghislain Motos, Maria I.

We should that this cloud responses to aerosol is robust, as predicted supersaturation and cloud droplet number levels agree with those determined from in-cloud measurements. The ability to determine if clouds are velocity- or aerosol-limited allow for novel model constraints and remote sensing products.\n\nSupercooled liquid water clouds observed over Dome C, Antarctica: temperature sensitivity and cloud radiative forcing\n\nPhilippe Ricaud, Massimo Del Guasta, Angelo Lupi, Romain Roehrig, Eric Bazile, Pierre Durand, Jean-Luc AttiÃ©, Alessia Nicosia, and Paolo Grigioni\n\nAtmos. Chem.

From observations at Concordia (Antarctica), we show that in supercooled liquid water (liquid water for temperatures below 0°C) clouds (SLWCs), temperature and SLWC radiative forcing increase with liquid water (up to 70 W m−2). We extrapolated that the maximum SLWC radiative forcing can reach 40 W m−2 over the Antarctic Peninsula, highlighting the importance of SLWCs for global climate prediction.\n\nRole of thermodynamic and turbulence processes on the fog life cycle during SOFOG3D experiment\n\nCheikh Dione, Martial Haeffelin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Burnet, Christine Lac, Guylaine Canut, Julien DelanoÃ«, Jean-Charles Dupont, Susana Jorquera, Pauline Martinet, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ribaud, and Felipe Toledo\n\nAtmos.

It is based on a unique dataset collected during the SOFOG3D field campaign in autumn and winter 2019–2020. The paper gives a threshold for turbulence driving the different phases of the fog life cycle and the role of advection in the night-time dissipation of fog. The results can be operationalised to nowcast fog and improve short-range forecasts in numerical weather prediction models.\n\nCharacterizing the near-global cloud vertical structures over land using high-resolution radiosonde measurements\n\nHui Xu, Jianping Guo, Bing Tong, Jinqiang Zhang, Tianmeng Chen, Xiaoran Guo, Jian Zhang, and Wenqing Chen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15011–15038, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15011-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15011-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative effect of cloud remains one of the largest uncertain factors in climate change, largely due to the lack of cloud vertical structure (CVS) observations. The study presents the first near-global CVS climatology using high-vertical-resolution soundings. Single-layer cloud mainly occurs over arid regions. As the number of cloud layers increases, clouds tend to have lower bases and thinner layer thicknesses. The occurrence frequency of cloud exhibits a pronounced seasonal diurnal cycle.\n\nInvestigating the role of typhoon-induced gravity waves and stratospheric hydration in the formation of tropopause cirrus clouds observed during the 2017 Asian monsoon\n\nAmit Kumar Pandit, Jean-Paul Vernier, Thomas Duncan Fairlie, Kristopher M.

Wienhold, Holger VÃ¶mel, Hongyu Liu, Bo Zhang, Buduru Suneel Kumar, Tra Dinh, and Achuthan Jayaraman\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2236,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2236, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the formation mechanism of a tropopause cirrus cloud layer observed at extremely cold temperatures over Hyderabad in India during the 2017 Asian summer monsoon using balloon-borne sensors. Ice crystals smaller than 50 microns were found in this optically thin cirrus cloud layer. Combined analysis of back-trajectories, satellite, and model data revealed that the formation of this layer was influenced by gravity waves and stratospheric hydration induced by typhoon Hato.\n\nDistinctive aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in marine boundary layer clouds from the ACE-ENA and SOCRATES aircraft field campaigns\n\nXiaojian Zheng, Xiquan Dong, Baike Xi, Timothy Logan, and Yuan Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2608,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2608, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe marine boundary layer aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) are examined using in-situ measurements from two aircraft campaigns over the eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) and Southern Ocean (SOCRATES). The SOCRATES clouds have more and smaller cloud droplets. The ACE-ENA clouds exhibit pronounced drizzle formation and growth. Results found distinctive aerosol-cloud interactions for two campaigns. The drizzle processes significantly alter sub-cloud aerosol budgets, and impact the ACI assessments.\n\nDifferences in microphysical properties of cirrus at high and mid-latitudes\n\nElena De La Torre Castro, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Armin Afchine, Volker Grewe, Valerian Hahn, Simon Kirschler, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Johannes Lucke, Nicole Spelten, Heini Wernli, Martin ZÃ¶ger, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos.

The in situ measurements are combined with backward trajectories to investigate the influence of the region on cloud formation. We show that HL cirrus are characterized by a lower concentration of larger ice crystals when compared to ML cirrus.\n\nSub-cloud rain evaporation in the North Atlantic winter trade winds derived by pairing isotopic data with a bin-resolved microphysical model\n\nMampi Sarkar, Adriana Bailey, Peter Blossey, Simon P. de Szoeke, David Noone, EstefanÃ­a QuiÃ±ones MelÃ©ndez, Mason D. Leandro, and Patrick Y. Chuang\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The modeled fraction of rain mass that evaporates below the cloud strongly depends on the raindrop size and distribution width. Moreover, the higher the rain mass fraction evaporated, the greater the change in deuterium excess. In this way, rain evaporation could be studied independently using only isotope and microphysical observations.\n\nOverview and statistical analysis of boundary layer clouds and precipitation over the western North Atlantic Ocean\n\nSimon Kirschler, Christiane Voigt, Bruce E.

We compare microphysical properties of pure liquid clouds to mixed-phase clouds and show that the initiation of the ice phase in mixed-phase clouds promotes precipitation. The observational data presented in this study are well suited for investigating the processes that give rise to liquid and mixed-phase clouds, ice, and precipitation.\n\nA set of methods to evaluate the below-cloud evaporation effect on local precipitation isotopic composition: a case study for Xi'an, China\n\nMeng Xing, Weiguo Liu, Jing Hu, and Zheng Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9123–9136, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9123-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9123-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe below-cloud evaporation effect (BCE) on precipitation largely impacts the final isotopic composition. However, determining the BCE effect remains poorly constrained. Our work used a ÎdÎÎ´ diagram to differentiate the below-cloud processes. Moreover, by comparing two different computing methods, we considered that both methods are suitable for evaluation the BCE, except for snowfall events. Overall, our work compiled a set of effective methods to evaluate the BCE effect.\n\nEarth-system-model evaluation of cloud and precipitation occurrence for supercooled and warm clouds over the Southern Ocean's Macquarie Island\n\nMcKenna W. Stanford, Ann M. Fridlind, Israel Silber, Andrew S. Ackerman, Greg Cesana, Johannes MÃ¼lmenstÃ¤dt, Alain Protat, Simon Alexander, and Adrian McDonald\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This study demonstrates an approach to robustly evaluate surface-based observations against a large-scale model. We find that the large-scale model precipitates too infrequently relative to observations, contrary to literature documentation suggesting otherwise based on satellite measurements.\n\nPollution slightly enhances atmospheric cooling by low-level clouds in tropical West Africa\n\nValerian Hahn, Ralf MeerkÃ¶tter, Christiane Voigt, Sonja Gisinger, Daniel Sauer, ValÃ©ry Catoire, Volker Dreiling, Hugh Coe, Cyrille Flamant, Stefan Kaufmann, Jonas Kleine, Peter Knippertz, Manuel Moser, Philip Rosenberg, Hans Schlager, Alfons Schwarzenboeck, and Jonathan Taylor\n\nAtmos.

Radiative transfer simulations, based on the measured cloud properties, reveal that these low-level polluted clouds radiate only 2.6 % more energy back to space, compared with a less polluted cloud. The corresponding additional decrease in temperature is rather small.\n\nInvestigating an indirect aviation effect on mid-latitude cirrus clouds â linking lidar-derived optical properties to in situ measurements\n\nSilke GroÃ, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Qiang Li, Martin Wirth, Benedikt Urbanek, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Ralf Weigel, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8369–8381, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAviation-emitted aerosol can have an impact on cirrus clouds. We present optical and microphysical properties of mid-latitude cirrus clouds which were formed under the influence of aviation-emitted aerosol or which were formed under rather pristine conditions. We find that cirrus clouds affected by aviation-emitted aerosol show larger values of the particle linear depolarization ratio, larger mean effective ice particle diameters and decreased ice particle number concentrations.\n\nInvestigating the vertical extent and short-wave radiative effects of the ice phase in Arctic summertime low-level clouds\n\nEmma JÃ¤rvinen, Franziska Nehlert, Guanglang Xu, Fritz Waitz, Guillaume Mioche, Regis Dupuy, Olivier Jourdan, and Martin Schnaiter\n\nAtmos.

Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds, where ice crystals and liquid droplets co-exist, are thought to have an important role in Arctic warming. Here we show airborne measurements of vertical distribution of liquid and ice particles and their relative abundance. Ice particles are found in relative warm clouds, which can be explained by multiplication of existing ice crystals. However, the role of ice particles in redistributing sun light is minimal.\n\nMicrophysical and thermodynamic phase analyses of Arctic low-level clouds measured above the sea ice and the open ocean in spring and summer\n\nManuel Moser, Christiane Voigt, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Valerian Hahn, Guillaume Mioche, Olivier Jourdan, RÃ©gis Dupuy, Christophe Gourbeyre, Alfons Schwarzenboeck, Johannes Lucke, Yvonne Boose, Mario Mech, Stephan Borrmann, AndrÃ© Ehrlich, Andreas Herber, Christof LÃ¼pkes, and Manfred Wendisch\n\nAtmos.

Using airborne in situ cloud data, we show that the properties of Arctic low-level clouds vary significantly with seasonal meteorological situations and surface conditions. The observations presented in this study can help one to assess the role of clouds in the Arctic climate system.\n\nAircraft observations of gravity wave activity and turbulence in the tropical tropopause layer: prevalence, influence on cirrus clouds, and comparison with global storm-resolving models\n\nRachel Atlas and Christopher S. Bretherton\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4009–4030, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4009-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4009-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe tropical tropopause layer exists between the troposphere and the stratosphere in the tropics. Very thin cirrus clouds cool Earth's surface by scrubbing water vapor (a greenhouse gas) out of air parcels as they ascend through the tropical tropopause layer on their way to the stratosphere. We show observational evidence from aircraft that small-scale (< 100 km) gravity waves and turbulence increase the amount of ice in these clouds and may allow them to remove more water vapor from the air.\n\nInfluence of air mass origin on microphysical properties of low-level clouds in a subarctic environment\n\nKonstantinos Matthaios Doulgeris, Ville Vakkari, Ewan J.

Phys., 23, 2483–2498, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2483-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2483-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how different long-range-transported air masses can affect the microphysical properties of low-level clouds in a clean subarctic environment. A connection was revealed. Higher values of cloud droplet number concentrations were related to continental air masses, whereas the lowest values of number concentrations were related to marine air masses. These were characterized by larger cloud droplets. Clouds in all regions were sensitive to increases in cloud number concentration.\n\nSensitivity of convectively driven tropical tropopauseÂ cirrus properties to ice habits in high-resolution simulations\n\nFayÃ§al Lamraoui, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Armin Afchine, Adam B. Sokol, Sergey Khaykin, Apoorva Pandey, and Zhiming Kuang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2393–2419, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2393-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2393-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCirrus in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) can play a key role in vertical transport. We investigate the role of different cloud regimes and the associated ice habits in regulating the properties of the TTL. We use high-resolution numerical experiments at the scales of large-eddy simulations (LESs) and aircraft measurements. We found that LES-scale parameterizations that predict ice shape are crucial for an accurate representation of TTL cirrus and thus the associated (de)hydration process.\n\nUpper-tropospheric slightly ice-subsaturated regions: frequency of occurrence and statistical evidence for the appearance of contrail cirrus\n\nYun Li, Christoph Mahnke, Susanne Rohs, Ulrich Bundke, Nicole Spelten, Georgios Dekoutsidis, Silke GroÃ, Christiane Voigt, Ulrich Schumann, Andreas Petzold, and Martina KrÃ¤mer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2251–2271, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2251-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2251-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative effect of aviation-induced cirrus is closely related to ambient conditions and its microphysical properties. Our study investigated the occurrence of contrail and natural cirrus measured above central Europe in spring 2014. It finds that contrail cirrus appears frequently in the pressure range 200 to 245 hPa and occurs more often in slightly ice-subsaturated environments than expected. Avoiding slightly ice-subsaturated regions by aviation might help mitigate contrail cirrus.\n\nExamination of aerosol indirect effects during cirrus cloud evolution\n\nFlor Vanessa Maciel, Minghui Diao, and Ryan Patnaude\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1103–1129, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1103-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1103-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol indirect effects on cirrus clouds are investigated during cirrus evolution, using global-scale in situ observations and climate model simulations. As cirrus evolves, the mechanisms to form ice crystals also change with time. Both small and large aerosols are found to affect cirrus properties. Southern Hemisphere cirrus appears to be more sensitive to additional aerosols. The climate model underestimates ice crystal mass, likely due to biases of relative humidity and vertical velocity.\n\nIn situ microphysics observations of intense pyroconvection from a large wildfire\n\nDavid E. Kingsmill, Jeffrey R. French, and Neil P. Lareau\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1–21, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses in situ aircraft measurements to characterize the size and shape distributions of 10 Âµm to 6 mm diameter particles observed during six penetrations of wildfire-induced pyroconvection. Particles sampled in one penetration of a smoke plume are most likely pyrometeors composed of ash. The other penetrations are through pyrocumulus clouds where particle composition is most likely a combination of hydrometeors (ice particles) and pyrometeors (ash).\n\nConditions favorable for secondary ice production in Arctic mixed-phase clouds\n\nJulie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Pasquier, Jan Henneberger, Fabiola Ramelli, Annika Lauber, Robert Oscar David, JÃ¶rg Wieder, Tim Carlsen, Rosa Gierens, Marion Maturilli, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15579–15601, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15579-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15579-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is important to understand how ice crystals and cloud droplets form in clouds, as their concentrations and sizes determine the exact radiative properties of the clouds. Normally, ice crystals form from aerosols, but we found evidence for the formation of additional ice crystals from the original ones over a large temperature range within Arctic clouds. In particular, additional ice crystals were formed during collisions of several ice crystals or during the freezing of large cloud droplets.\n\nInteraction between cloudâradiation, atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics based on observational data from GoAmazon 2014/15 and a cloud-resolving model\n\nLayrson J. M. GonÃ§alves, Simone M. S. C. Coelho, Paulo Y. Kubota, and Dayana C. Souza\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15509–15526, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15509-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15509-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research aims to study the environmental conditions that are favorable and not favorable to cloud formation, in this case specifically for the Amazon region. The results found in this research will be used to improve the representation of clouds in numerical models that are used in weather and climate prediction. In general, it is expected that with better knowledge regarding the cloud–radiation interaction, it is possible to make a better forecast of weather and climate.\n\nSnowfall in Northern Finland derives mostly from ice clouds\n\nClaudia Mignani, Lukas Zimmermann, Rigel Kivi, Alexis Berne, and Franz Conen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13551–13568, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13551-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13551-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determined over the course of 8 winter months the phase of clouds associated with snowfall in Northern Finland using radiosondes and observations of ice particle habits at ground level. We found that precipitating clouds were extending from near ground to at least 2.7 km altitude and approximately three-quarters of them were likely glaciated. Possible moisture sources and ice formation processes are discussed.\n\nObservation of secondary ice production in clouds at low temperatures\n\nAlexei Korolev, Paul J. DeMott, Ivan Heckman, Mengistu Wolde, Earle Williams, David J. Smalley, and Michael F. Donovan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13103–13113, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13103-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13103-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study provides the first explicit in situ observation of secondary ice production at temperatures as low as −27 °C, which is well outside the range of the Hallett–Mossop process (−3 to −8 °C). This observation expands our knowledge of the temperature range of initiation of secondary ice in clouds. The obtained results are intended to stimulate laboratory and theoretical studies to develop physically based parameterizations for weather prediction and climate models.\n\nIn situ and satellite-based estimates of cloud properties and aerosolâcloud interactions over the southeast Atlantic Ocean\n\nSiddhant Gupta, Greg M. McFarquhar, Joseph R. O'Brien, Michael R. Poellot, David J. Delene, Ian Chang, Lan Gao, Feng Xu, and Jens Redemann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12923–12943, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12923-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12923-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ability of NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites to retrieve cloud properties and estimate the changes in cloud properties due to aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) was examined. There was good agreement between satellite retrievals and in situ measurements over the southeast Atlantic Ocean. This suggests that, combined with information on aerosol properties, satellite retrievals of cloud properties can be used to study ACI over larger domains and longer timescales in the absence of in situ data.\n\nIce fog observed at cirrus temperatures at DomeÂ C, Antarctic Plateau\n\nÃtienne Vignon, Lea Raillard, Christophe Genthon, Massimo Del Guasta, Andrew J. Heymsfield, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, and Alexis Berne\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12857–12872, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12857-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12857-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe near-surface atmosphere over the Antarctic Plateau is cold and pristine and resembles to a certain extent the high troposphere where cirrus clouds form. In this study, we use innovative humidity measurements at Concordia Station to study the formation of ice fogs at temperatures <−40°C. We provide observational evidence that ice fogs can form through the homogeneous freezing of solution aerosols, a common nucleation pathway for cirrus clouds.\n\nLife cycle of stratocumulus clouds over 1 year at the coast of the Atacama Desert\n\nJan H. Schween, Camilo del Rio, Juan-Luis GarcÃ­a, Pablo Osses, Sarah Westbrook, and Ulrich LÃ¶hnert\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12241–12267, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12241-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12241-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine stratocumulus clouds of the eastern Pacific play an essential role in the Earth's climate. These clouds form the major source of water to parts of the extreme dry Atacama Desert at the northern coast of Chile. For the first time these clouds are observed over a whole year with three remote sensing instruments. It is shown how these clouds are influenced by the land–sea wind system and the distribution of ocean temperatures.\n\nExperimental study on the evolution of droplet size distribution during the fog life cycle\n\nMarie Mazoyer, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Burnet, and Cyrielle Denjean\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 11305–11321, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-11305-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-11305-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evolution of the droplet size distribution during the fog life cycle remains poorly understood and progress is required to reduce the uncertainty of fog forecasts. To gain insights into the physical processes driving the microphysics, intensive field campaigns were conducted during three winters at the SIRTA site in the south of Paris. This study analyzed the variations in fog microphysical properties and their potential interactions at the different evolutionary stages of the fog events.\n\nSignificant continental source of ice-nucleating particles at the tip of Chile's southernmost Patagonia region\n\nXianda Gong, Martin Radenz, Heike Wex, Patric Seifert, Farnoush Ataei, Silvia Henning, Holger Baars, Boris Barja, Albert Ansmann, and Frank Stratmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 10505–10525, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are poorly understood in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). We studied INPs in the boundary layer in the southern Patagonia region. No seasonal cycle of INP concentrations was observed. The majority of INPs are biogenic particles, likely from local continental sources. The INP concentrations are higher when strong precipitation occurs. While previous studies focused on marine INP sources in SH, we point out the importance of continental sources of INPs.\n\nRetrieving ice-nucleating particle concentration and ice multiplication factors using active remote sensing validated by in situ observations\n\nJÃ¶rg Wieder, Nikola Ihn, Claudia Mignani, Moritz Haarig, Johannes BÃ¼hl, Patric Seifert, Ronny Engelmann, Fabiola Ramelli, Zamin A. Kanji, Ulrike Lohmann, and Jan Henneberger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9767–9797, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9767-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9767-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce formation and its evolution in mixed-phase clouds are still uncertain. We evaluate the lidar retrieval of ice-nucleating particle concentration in dust-dominated and continental air masses over the Swiss Alps with in situ observations. A calibration factor to improve the retrieval from continental air masses is proposed. Ice multiplication factors are obtained with a new method utilizing remote sensing. Our results indicate that secondary ice production occurs at temperatures down to −30 °C.\n\nTemporal and vertical distributions of the occurrence of cirrus clouds over a coastal station in the Indian monsoon region\n\nSaleem Ali, Sanjay Kumar Mehta, Aravindhavel Ananthavel, and Tondapu Venkata Ramesh Reddy\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8321–8342, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8321-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8321-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMultiple cirrus clouds frequently occur over regions of deep convection in the tropics. Tropical convection has a strong diurnal pattern, with peaks in the afternoon to early evening, over the continents. Continuous micropulse lidar observations over a coastal station in the Indian monsoon region enable us, for the first time, to demonstrate a robust diurnal pattern of single and multiple cirrus occurrences, with peaks during the late afternoon and early morning hours, respectively.\n\nContinental thunderstorm ground enhancement observed at an exceptionally low altitude\n\nIvana KolmaÅ¡ovÃ¡, OndÅej SantolÃ­k, Jakub Å legl, Jana PopovÃ¡, ZbynÄk Sokol, Petr Zacharov, OndÅej Ploc, Gerhard Diendorfer, Ronald Langer, Radek LÃ¡n, and Igor StrhÃ¡rskÃ½\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7959–7973, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7959-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7959-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGamma ray radiation related to thunderstorms was previously observed at the high-altitude mountain observatories or on the western coast of Japan, usually being terminated by lightning discharges. We show unusual observations of gamma rays at an altitude below 1000 m, coinciding with peculiar rapid variations in the vertical electric field, which are linked to inverted intracloud lightning discharges. This indicates that a strong, lower positive-charge region was present inside the thundercloud.\n\nIce-nucleating particles from multiple aerosol sources in the urban environment of Beijing under mixed-phase cloud conditions\n\nCuiqi Zhang, Zhijun Wu, Jingchuan Chen, Jie Chen, Lizi Tang, Wenfei Zhu, Xiangyu Pei, Shiyi Chen, Ping Tian, Song Guo, Limin Zeng, Min Hu, and Zamin A. Kanji\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7539–7556, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7539-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7539-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe immersion ice nucleation effectiveness of aerosols from multiple sources in the urban environment remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the immersion ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentration increased dramatically during a dust event in an urban atmosphere. Pollutant aerosols, including inorganic salts formed through secondary transformation (SIA) and black carbon (BC), might not act as effective INPs under mixed-phase cloud conditions.\n\nIn situ observation of riming in mixed-phase clouds using the PHIPS probe\n\nFritz Waitz, Martin Schnaiter, Thomas Leisner, and Emma JÃ¤rvinen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7087–7103, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7087-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7087-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiming, i.e., the accretion of small droplets on the surface of ice particles via collision, is one of the major uncertainties in model prediction of mixed-phase clouds. We discuss the occurrence (up to 50% of particles) and aging of rimed ice particles and show correlations of the occurrence and the degree of riming with ambient meteorological parameters using data gathered by the Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering (PHIPS) probe during three airborne in situ field campaigns.\n\nMeasurement report: Introduction to the HyICE-2018 campaign for measurements of ice-nucleating particles and instrument inter-comparison in the HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤ boreal forest\n\nZoÃ© Brasseur, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Erik S.

We provide an overview of the campaign settings, and we describe the measurement infrastructure and operating procedures used. In addition, we use results from ice nucleation instrument inter-comparison to show that the suite of these instruments deployed during the campaign reports consistent results.\n\nNorth Atlantic Ocean SST-gradient-driven variations in aerosol and cloud evolution along Lagrangian cold-air outbreak trajectories\n\nKevin J.

Measurements of particles over the ocean are rare and expensive to collect, so models are necessary to fill in the gaps by simulating both particle and clouds. However, some measurements are needed to test the accuracy of the models. Here, we measure changes in particles in different weather conditions, which are ideal for comparison with models.\n\nFactors affecting precipitation formation and precipitation susceptibility of marine stratocumulus with variable above- and below-cloud aerosol concentrations over the Southeast Atlantic\n\nSiddhant Gupta, Greg M. McFarquhar, Joseph R. O'Brien, Michael R. Poellot, David J. Delene, Rose M. Miller, and Jennifer D. Small Griswold\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Instances of contact and separation between aerosol and cloud layers show polluted clouds have a lower precipitation rate and a lower precipitation susceptibility. This information will help improve cloud representation in Earth system models.\n\nAn assessment of macrophysical and microphysical cloud properties driving radiative forcing of shallow trade-wind clouds\n\nAnna E. Luebke, AndrÃ© Ehrlich, Michael SchÃ¤fer, Kevin Wolf, and Manfred Wendisch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2727–2744, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2727-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2727-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA combination of aircraft and satellite observations is used to show how the characteristics of tropical shallow clouds interact with incoming and outgoing energy. A complete depiction of these clouds is challenging to obtain, but such data are useful for understanding how models can correctly represent them. The amount of cloud is found to be the most important factor, while other cloud characteristics become increasingly impactful when more cloud is present.\n\nHigh concentrations of ice crystals in upper-tropospheric tropical clouds: is there a link to biomass and fossil fuel combustion?\n\nGraciela B. Raga, Darrel Baumgardner, Blanca Rios, Yanet DÃ­az-Esteban, Alejandro Jaramillo, Martin Gallagher, Bastien Sauvage, Pawel Wolff, and Gary Lloyd\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2269–2292, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) is a small fleet of commercial aircraft that carry a suite of meteorological, gas, aerosol, and cloud sensors and have been measuring worldwide for almost 9 years, since late 2011. Extreme ice events (EIEs) have been identified from the IAGOS cloud measurements and linked to surface emissions for biomass and fossil fuel consumption. The results reported here are highly relevant for climate change and flight operations forecasting.\n\nAtmospheric rivers and associated precipitation patterns during the ACLOUD and PASCAL campaigns near Svalbard (MayâJune 2017): case studies using observations, reanalyses, and a regional climate model\n\nCarolina Viceto, Irina V. Gorodetskaya, Annette Rinke, Marion Maturilli, Alfredo Rocha, and Susanne Crewell\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 441–463, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-441-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-441-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe focus on anomalous moisture transport events known as atmospheric rivers (ARs). During ACLOUD and PASCAL, three AR events were identified: 30 May, 6 June, and 9 June 2017. We explore their spatio-temporal evolution and precipitation patterns using measurements, reanalyses, and a model. We show the importance of the following: Atlantic and Siberian pathways during spring–summer in the Arctic, AR-associated heat/moisture increase, precipitation phase transition, and high-resolution datasets.\n\nMass of different snow crystal shapes derived from fall speed measurements\n\nSandra VÃ¡zquez-MartÃ­n, Thomas Kuhn, and Salomon Eliasson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18669–18688, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18669-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18669-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh-resolution top- and side-view images of snow ice particles taken by the D-ICI instrument are used to determine the shape; size; cross-sectional area; fall speed; and, based upon these properties, the mass of the individual snow particles. The study analyses the relationships between these fundamental properties as a function of particle shape and highlights that the choice of size parameter, maximum dimension or another characteristic length, is crucial when relating fall speed to mass.\n\nCited articles"
