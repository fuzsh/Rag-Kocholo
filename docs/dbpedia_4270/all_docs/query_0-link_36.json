TelesiÅski, and Marek ZajÄ czkowski\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-52,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-52, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur findings document four sediment-laden meltwater pulses between 14.7 and 8.2 kyr BP. These pulses, primarily driven by deglacial processes and supplemented by paleo-lake outbursts or paleo-tsunami currents, are marked by drops in sea surface temperatures, increased sea ice content, high terrigenous supply, and a limited influence of AW. One of the key highlights of our study is the evidence of the Storegga tsunami impact around 8.2 kyr BP, likely redistributed sediments in the NW Barents Sea.\n\nA novel explainable deep learning framework for reconstructing South Asian palaeomonsoons\n\nKieran M. R. Hunt and Sandy P. Harrison\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2128,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2128, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we train machine learning models on tree rings, speleothems, and instrumental rainfall to estimate seasonal monsoon rainfall over India over the last 500 years. Our models highlight multidecadal droughts in the mid-seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and we link these to historical famines. Using techniques from explainable AI, we show our models use known relationships between local hydroclimate and the monsoon circulation.\n\nDeglaciation and abrupt events in a coupled comprehensive atmosphere–ocean–ice sheet–solid earth model\n\nUwe Mikolajewicz, Marie-Luise Kapsch, Clemens Schannwell, Katharina D.

The model simulations are compared to proxy data. During the glacial and deglaciation the model simulates several abrupt changes in North Atlantic climate. The underlying meachanisms are analysed and described.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere ice sheets and ocean interactions during the last glacial period in a coupled ice sheet-climate model\n\nLouise Abot, AurÃ©lien Quiquet, and Claire Waelbroeck\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-51,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-51, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis modeling study examines how Northern Hemisphere ice sheets interacted with oceans during the last glacial period. Warmer ocean subsurface temperatures increase freshwater release, cooling the Northern Hemisphere and slowing the ocean circulation. Cold freshwater release slows ice discharges, revealing complex feedback at this interface. The study emphasizes the importance of additional modeling studies and observational comparisons to enhance understanding of past climate variability.\n\nExploring the mechanisms of Devonian oceanic anoxia: impact of ocean dynamics, palaeogeography and orbital forcing\n\nJustin GÃ©rard, LoÃ¯c Sablon, Jarno J. C. Huygh, Anne-Christine Da Silva, Alexandre Pohl, Christian VÃ©rard, and Michel Crucifix\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1983,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1983, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used cGENIE, a climate model, to explore how changes in continental configuration, CO2 levels, and orbital configuration affect ocean oxygen levels during the Devonian period (419–359 million years ago). Key factors contributing to ocean anoxia were identified, highlighting the influence of continental configurations, atmospheric conditions, and orbital changes. Our findings offer new insights into the causes and prolonged durations of Devonian ocean anoxic events.\n\nMore is not always better: downscaling climate model outputs from 30 to 5-minute resolution has minimal impact on coherence with Late Quaternary proxies\n\nLucy Timbrell, James Blinkhorn, Margherita Colucci, Michela Leonardi, Manuel Chevalier, Matt Grove, Eleanor Scerri, and Andrea Manica\n\nClim.

The model consists of simplified equations inspired by ocean-current dynamics. We fine-tune this model to capture the Dansgaard-Oeschger events with unprecedented accuracy, providing deeper insights into past climate patterns. This helps us understand and predict complex climate changes, aiding future climate-change resilience efforts.\n\nClimatic and tectonic controls on shallow marine and freshwater diatomite deposition through the Palaeogene\n\nCÃ©cile Figus, Or M. Bialik, Andrey Yu. Gladenkov, Tatyana V. Oreshkina, Johan Renaudie, Pavel Smirnov, and Jakub Witkowski\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2229,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2229, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal scale compilation of Palaeogene diatomite occurrences reveals the impact of palaeogeographic and palaeoceanographic changes on diatom accumulation, particularly in the middle Eocene: diatomite deposition dropped in epicontinental seas between ~46 and ~43 Ma, while diatoms began to accumulate from ~43.5 Ma in open ocean settings. The compilation also shows the indirect correlation between Palaeogene climate fluctuations & diatomite deposition in shallow marine and freshwater environments.\n\nInvestigating the surface mass balance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation\n\nKirstin Koepnick, Minmin Fu, and Eli Tziperman\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1998,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1998, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe exact impact of climate feedbacks on glacial cycles still remains unclear. In this study, we calculate the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from 21,000 to about 12,000 years ago using a climate model experiment. We found that the model overestimates ice loss compared to existing data. The melt rate is influenced by small changes in albedo and radiation, suggesting that climate models struggle to accurately calculate SMB, hindering our understanding of ice ages.\n\nSubaqueous speleothems as archives of groundwater recharge on Australia’s southern arid margin\n\nCalla N. Gould-Whaley, Russell N. Drysdale, Pauline C. Treble, Jan-Hendrik May, Stacey C. Priestley, John C. Hellstrom, and Clare Buswell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1959,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1959, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is causing enhanced aridity across many regions of the globe, leading to increased reliance on groundwater resources. We need to understand how groundwater recharge behaves in arid regions over long timescales, unfortunately, arid landscapes tend to preserve very little evidence of their climatic past. We present evidence to suggest that carbonate formations that grow in groundwater can be used as archives of past groundwater recharge in Australia's arid zone.\n\nPossible provenance of IRD by tracing late Eocene Antarctic iceberg melting using a high-resolution ocean model\n\nMark Vinz Elbertsen, Erik van Sebille, and Peter Kristian Bijl\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1596,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1596, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work verifies the remarkable finds of late Eocene Antarctic-sourced iceberg-rafted debris found on South Orkney. We find that these icebergs must have been on the larger end of the size scale compared to today’s icebergs due to faster melting in the warmer Eocene climate. The study was performed using a high-resolution model in which individual icebergs were followed through time.\n\nNew evidence for millennial-scale interactions between Hg cycling and hydroclimate from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana\n\nAlice Paine, Joost Frieling, Timothy Shanahan, Tamsin Mather, Nicholas McKay, Stuart Robinson, David Pyle, Isabel Fendley, Ruth Kiely, and William Gosling\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2123,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2123, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFew tropical Hg records extend beyond ~12 ka, meaning our current understanding of Hg behaviour may not fully account for the impact of long-term hydroclimate changes on the Hg cycle in these environments. Here, we present a ~96,000-year Hg record from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. A coupled response is observed between Hg flux and shifts in sediment composition reflective of changes in lake level, and suggesting that hydroclimate may be a key driver of tropical Hg cycling over millennial-timescales.\n\nCharacterization of the 1966 Camp Century Sub-Glacial Core: A Multiscale Analysis\n\nCatherine M. Collins, Nicolas Perdrial, Pierre-Henri Blard, Nynke Keulen, William C. Mahaney, Halley Mastro, Juliana Souza, Donna M. Rizzo, Yves Marrocchi, Paul C. Knutz, and Paul R.

In this study, we investigated the core archive making large scale observations using CT scans and micron scale observation observing physical and chemical characteristics of individual grains. We find evidence of past ice-free conditions, weathering processes during warmer periods, and past glaciations.\n\nMiddle Miocene climate evolution in the Northern Mediterranean region (Digne-Valensole basin, SE France)\n\nArmelle Ballian, Maud J. M. Meijers, Isabelle Cojan, Damien Huyghe, Miguel Bernecker, Katharina Methner, Mattia Tagliavento, Jens Fiebig, and Andreas Mulch\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2093,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2093, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the Middle Miocene, the Earth transitioned from a warm period to a colder one, significantly impacting global ecosystems and climate patterns. We present a climate record (23–13 Ma) from northern Mediterranean soil carbonates in France, revealing dynamic temperature changes and suggesting early Mediterranean-like climate periods. Our climate record aligns well with terrestrial European and global marine records, enhancing our understanding of Miocene climate dynamics around the Alps.\n\nPollen-based climatic reconstructions for the interglacial analogues of MIS 1 (MIS 19, 11 and 5) in the Southwestern Mediterranean: insights from ODP Site 976\n\nDael Sassoon, Nathalie Combourieu-Nebout, Odile Peyron, Adele Bertini, Francesco Toti, Vincent Lebreton, and Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Moncel\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1771,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1771, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComparisons of climatic reconstructions of past interglacials MIS 19, 11, 5 with the current interglacial (MIS 1) based on pollen data from a marine core (Alboran Sea) show that, compared with MIS 1, MIS 19 was colder and highly variable, MIS 11 was longer and more stable, and MIS 5 was warmer. While there is no real equivalent to the current interglacial, past interglacials give insights into the sensitivity of the SW Mediterranean to global climatic changes during conditions similar to MIS 1.\n\nStretched polar vortex increases mid-latitude climate variability during the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nYurui Zhang, Hans Renssen, Heikki SeppÃ¤, Zhen Li, and Xingrui Li\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-46,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-46, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe upper and lower atmosphere are interacted. The polar regions, with a high-speed and cyclonically rotating winds, provide a window that the upper air flow affects the mid-latitudes' weather which results in intra-seasonal climate variability. To explore their impacts on glacial-interglacial cycles, we analysed climate model results, and found that the stretched upper air flow increases glacial climate variability via more cold air outbreaks, highlighting their connections on multi-timescales.\n\nPrecise dating of deglacial Laptev Sea sediments via 14C and authigenic 10Be/9Be – assessing local 14C reservoir ages\n\nArnaud Nicolas, Gesine Mollenhauer, Johannes Lachner, Konstanze StÃ¼bner, Maylin Malter, Jutta Wollenburg, Hendrik Grotheer, and Florian Adolphi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1992,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1992, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the authigenic 10Be/9Be record of a Laptev Sea sediment core for the period 8–14 kyr BP and synchronize it with the 10Be records from absolutely dated ice cores. We employed a likelihood function to calculate the ΔR values. A benthic ΔR value of +345±60 14C years was estimated, which corresponds to a marine reservoir age of 848±90 14C years. This new ΔR value was used to refine the age-depth model for core PS2458-4, establishing it as a potential reference chronology for the Laptev Sea.\n\nGlacial-interglacial contrasts in the marine inorganic carbon chemistry of the Benguela Upwelling System\n\nSzabina Karancz, Lennart J. de Nooijer, Bas van der Wagt, Marcel T. J. van der Meer, Sambuddha Misra, Rick Hennekam, Zeynep Erdem, Julie Lattaud, Negar Haghipour, Stefan Schouten, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1915,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1915, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in upwelling intensity of the Benguela upwelling region during the last glacial motivated us to investigate the local CO2-history during the last glacial to interglacial transition. Using various geochemical tracers on archives from both intermediate and surface waters reveal enhanced storage of carbon at depth during the last glacial maximum. An efficient biological pump likely prevented outgassing of CO2 from intermediate depth to the atmosphere.\n\nStrong volcanic-induced climatic shocks on historical Moselle wine production\n\nFredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, Bo Christiansen, Lea Schneider, and Peter Thejll\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-41,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-41, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the climatic signal, with focus on volcanic-induced shocks, in two long annual records of wine production quantity (spanning 1444–1786) from present-day Luxembourg, close to the northern limit of viticulture in Europe. Highly significant wine production declines are found during years following major volcanic events. Furthermore, warmer and drier climate conditions favoured wine production, with spring and summer conditions being the most important ones.\n\nSpatio-temporal dynamics of speleothem growth and glaciation in the British Isles\n\nSina Panitz, Michael Rogerson, Jack Longman, Nick Scroxton, Tim J.

Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-48,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-48, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReconstructions of past glaciations tell us about how ice sheets grow and retreat. In this study, we use speleothems (cave deposits, e.g., stalagmites) in the British Isles to help constrain the extent of past glaciations both in time and space. Speleothems require liquid water to grow, and therefore, their presence indicates the absence of ice above the cave. By dating these speleothems we can improve existing reconstructions of past ice sheets.\n\nGlobal biome changes over the last 21,000 years inferred from model-data comparisons\n\nChenzhi Li, Anne Dallmeyer, Jian Ni, Manuel Chevalier, Matteo Willeit, Andrei A. Andreev, Xianyong Cao, Laura Schild, Birgit Heim, and Ulrike Herzschuh\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1862,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1862, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a global megabiome dynamics and distributions derived from pollen-based reconstructions over the last 21,000 years, which are suitable for the evaluation of Earth System Model-based paleo-megabiome simulations. We identified strong deviations between pollen- and model-derived megabiome distributions in the circum-Arctic areas and Tibetan Plateau during the Last Glacial Maximum and early deglaciation, as well as in North Africa and the Mediterranean regions during the Holocene.\n\nSediment fluxes dominate glacial-interglacial changes in ocean carbon inventory: results from factorial simulations over the past 780,000 years\n\nMarkus Adloff, Aurich Jeltsch-ThÃ¶mmes, Frerk PÃ¶ppelmeier, Thomas F. Stocker, and Fortunat Joos\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1754,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1754, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used an Earth system model to simulate how different processes changed the amount of carbon in the ocean and atmosphere over the last eight glacial cycles. We found that the effects of interactive marine sediments enlarge the carbon fluxes that result from these processes, especially in the ocean. Comparison with proxy data showed that no single process explains the global carbon cycle changes over glacial cycles, but individual processes can dominate regional and proxy-specific changes.\n\nSea Surface Temperature over the Bay of Bengal: A key driver for South Asian Summer Monsoon rainfall during past 31 kiloyears\n\nThamizharasan Sakthivel, Prosenjit Ghosh, Ravi Bhushan, Harsh Raj, Ankur J. Dabhi, Ajay Shivam, and Senthilnathan D\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1566,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1566, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) gets most of its moisture from the Bay of Bengal due to its proximity and high sea surface temperature (SST). While the mechanical relationship between Bay of Bengal SST and SASM rainfall is understood, short-term climate events like ENSO obscure this in modern records. This study shows the connection between Bay of Bengal SST and SASM rainfall during Interglacial and Last Glacial periods using millennial-scale data that excludes these short-term influences.\n\nOrbital-scale climate dynamics impacts on Gzhelian peatland wildfire activity in the Ordos Basin\n\nWenxu Du, Dawei Lv, Zhihui Zhang, Munira Raji, Cuiyu Song, Luojing Wang, Zekuan Li, Kai Cao, Ruoxiang Yuan, and Yuzhuang Sun\n\nClim.

The frequency of wildfires during this period may be related to the forcing of long eccentricity orbital cycles. A review of the Gzhelian global wildfire record suggests that the distribution of wildfires may have been limited by the climate and available fuels of the time.\n\nSpeleothem evidence for late Miocene extreme Arctic amplification – an analogue for near future anthropogenic climate change?\n\nStuart Umbo, Franziska Lechleitner, Thomas Opel, Sevasti Modestou, Tobias Braun, Anton Vaks, Gideon Henderson, Pete Scott, Alexander Osintzev, Alexandr Kononov, Irina Adrian, Yuri Dublyansky, Alena Giesche, and Sebastian Breitenbach\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1691,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1691, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use cave rocks to reconstruct northern Siberian climate 8.68 ± 0.09 million years ago. We show that when global average temperature was about 4.5 °C warmer than today (similar to what’s expected in the coming decades should carbon emissions continue unabated), Arctic temperature increased by more than 18 °C. Similar levels of Arctic warming in the future would see huge areas of permafrost (permanently frozen ground) thaw and release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Pollen Database – a Neotoma constituent database\n\nAnnika V.

This is a valuable collection that can be used to analyse vegetation dynamics going back thousands of years. It is now being fully shared via Neotoma for the first time, opening up many exciting new avenues of research. This paper presents key aspects of this database, including geographical distribution, age control and sedimentation rates.\n\nRapid topographic growth of the Diancang Shan, southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau since 5.0–3.5 Ma\n\nChunxia Zhang, Haibin Wu, Xiuli Zhao, Yunkai Deng, Yunxia Jia, Wenchao Zhang, Shihu Li, and Chenglong Deng\n\nClim.

Our results show low elevations of the DCS between ~7.6 Ma and ~5.0 Ma, followed by significant uplift of 1000–2000 meters between ~5.0 Ma and ~3.5 Ma. It provides a novel method for reconstructing the paleoelevation of mountains like the DCS in orogenic belts.\n\nQuantitative reconstruction of past monsoon precipitation based on tetraether membrane lipids in Chinese loess\n\nJingjing Guo, Martin Ziegler, Louise Fuchs, Youbin Sun, and Francien Peterse\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1648,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1648, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use the distribution of soil bacterial membrane lipids stored on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to quantitatively reconstruct variations in precipitation amount over the past 130 kyr. The precipitation record shows orbital- and millennial-scale variations and varies at precession and obliquity scale.

We show that wildfires were greater during the LIG than the Holocene and were supported by fire prone-species, low soil respiration, and a greater difference between summer and winter temperature. We show that vegetation type and summer/winter temperature contrast are strong drivers of Siberian wildfires.\n\nEvaluating the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Version 3 with synoptic typing and East Antarctic ice core accumulation\n\nMax T.

New monthly, global climate reconstructions together with daily weather reconstructions allow a detailed view of this climatic event. Following several severe cold spells in January and February, a persistent circulation pattern with blocking over the British Isles caused northerly flow towards Western Europe during a large part of the year. It was one of the strongest, arguably unforced excursions in European temperature.\n\nTesting the reliability of global surface temperature reconstructions of the last glacial cycle\n\nJean-Philippe Baudouin, Nils Weitzel, Maximilian May, Lukas Jonkers, Andrew M.

We devise a method to test temperature reconstruction using climate simulations. Uncertainties, mainly from past temperature measurement methods and age determination, impact reconstructions over time. While more data enhances accuracy for long-term trends, high quality data are more important for short-term precision. Our study lays the groundwork for better reconstructions and suggests avenues for improvement.\n\nLast Millennium Volcanic Forcing and Climate Response using SO2 Emissions\n\nLauren R.

Our results show that the way in which eruptions are simulated in models matters for the comparison to tree-rings, particularly regarding the spatial spread of volcanic aerosol.\n\nMillennial scale sea surface temperatures of the western Arabian Sea between 37–67 ka BP\n\nJennifer Scott, Douglas Coenen, and Simon Jung\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-865,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-865, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study is aimed at understanding the processes driving seasonal monsoonal change in the Arabian Sea in relation to the well-known millennial scale climate change dominating during glacial periods. Our results suggest that sediments from the Arabian Sea have chronicled influence from both, the northern and the southern hemisphere. This suggests that the Arabian Sea potentially is a “melting pot” with periodically alternating hemispheric influence affecting monsoon circulation in the region.\n\nPatterns of changing surface climate variability from the Last Glacial Maximum to present in transient model simulations\n\nElisa Ziegler, Nils Weitzel, Jean-Philippe Baudouin, Marie-Luise Kapsch, Uwe Mikolajewicz, Lauren Gregoire, Ruza Ivanovic, Paul J.

We show that changes of year-to-year up to century-to-century fluctuations of temperature and precipitation during the Deglaciation were mostly larger than during either the preceding or succeeding more stable periods in fifteen climate model simulations. The analysis demonstrates how ice sheets, meltwater and volcanism influence simulated variability to inform future simulation protocols.\n\nVariations in the Biological Pump through the Miocene: Evidence from organic carbon burial in Pacific Ocean sediments\n\nMitchell Lyle and Annette Olivarez Lyle\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-34,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-34, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStudies of past warm intervals show that greenhouse gases are a key factor to warm the earth. However, feedbacks are needed to maintain warm periods. We investigate whether changes in the ocean degradation depth for plankton-produced organic matter might change ocean carbon storage. Low Corg burial in sediments of the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) warm interval relative to more recent periods fits with less efficient Corg transfer to the abyss, maintaining a higher level of MCO atmospheric CO2.\n\nShifts in Greenland interannual climate variability lead Dansgaard-Oeschger abrupt warming by hundreds of years\n\nChloe A.

Importantly, we find that variability consistently decreases hundreds of years prior to Dansgaard-Oeschger warming events. Model simulations suggest a change in North Atlantic sea ice behavior contributed to this pattern, thus providing new information on the conditions which proceeded abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial Period.\n\nResponse of Late-Eocene warmth to incipient glaciation on Antarctica\n\nDennis H.A. Vermeulen, Michiel L. J. Baatsen, and Anna S. von der Heydt\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-30,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-30, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: final response, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLate-Eocene summers, 34 million years ago, were hot on Antarctica, with temperatures up to 30 °C. We also know that during that period the first Antarctic Ice Sheet formed. Since climate models don’t show this transition from warm climate to ice sheet formation accurately, we imposed regional ice sheets onto the continent in a realistic climate, and show that these ice sheets don't melt away. This suggests that the initiation of ice sheet growth might indeed have happened during warmer periods.\n\nPerspective on ice age Terminations from absolute chronologies provided by global speleothem records\n\nNikita Kaushal, Carlos Perez-Mejias, and Heather M.

They provide key examples of climatic teleconnections and dynamics. In this study, we use the SISAL global speleothem database and find that there are sufficient climatic records from key locations to make speleothems a valuable archive for studying Terminations and provide instances for more targeted work on speleothem research.\n\nSouthern Ocean control on atmospheric CO2 changes across late-Pliocene Marine Isotope Stage M2\n\nSuning Hou, Leonie Toebrock, Mart van der Linden, Fleur Rothstegge, Martin Ziegler, Lucas J.

This oceanographic change aligns well with the trends in pCO2. We propose that iceberg discharge from the M2 deglaciation freshened the subtropical front, which together with the other oceanographic changes, affected atmosphere-ocean CO2 exchange in the Southern Ocean.\n\nImpact of the Late Miocene Cooling on the loss of coral reefs in the Central Indo-Pacific\n\nBenjamin Fredericks Petrick, Lars Reuning, Miriam Pfeiffer, Gerald Auer, and Lorenz Schwark\n\nClim.

The cause of this is unknown. This study uses a new SST record biased on biomarkers from the Coral Sea between 11–2 Ma to demonstrate a 2-degree cooling in the Central Indo-Pacific as part of the Late Miocene Cooling. When combined with other impacts associated with this event, this might explain the collapse of coral reefs. The new data shows the importance of SST changes in Coral Reef loss.\n\nAssessment of the southern polar and subpolar warming in the PMIP4 Last Interglacial simulations using paleoclimate data syntheses\n\nQinggang Gao, Emilie Capron, Louise C.

However, when only forced by orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentrations during that period, state-of-the-art climate models do not reproduce the magnitude of warming. Here we show that much of the warming at southern mid-to-high latitudes can be reproduced by a UK climate model HadCM3 with a 3000-year freshwater forcing over the North Atlantic.\n\nWestern Indian Ocean bottom water temperature calibration – are benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios a reliable palaeothermometry proxy?\n\nViktoria Larsson and Simon Jung\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-979,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-979, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe deep ocean is an important part of the global climate system. Accurate estimates of temperature changes at depth, are crucial to understand the role of the intermediate to deep ocean in climate change. We have used samples from the Indian Ocean to establish Mg/Ca based temperature calibrations based on benthic foraminifera. Our data suggest that generating optimal Mg/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera may require species and region specific cleaning procedures.\n\nSpatial and temporal variability of sea surface temperatures and monsoon dynamics in the northwestern Arabian Sea during the last 43 kyr\n\nJan Maier, Nicole Burdanowitz, Gerhard Schmiedl, and Birgit Gaye\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1072,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1072, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the past 43 ka in the Gulf of Oman. We find SST variations of up to seven degree with lower SSTs during Heinrich Events (HE), especially HE4, and higher SSTs during Dansgaard-Oeschger Events. Our record shows no profound cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum but abrupt variations during the Holocene. We surmise that SSTs variations are influenced by the southwest (northeast) Monsoon during warmer (colder) periods.\n\nHigh-resolution Holocene record from Torfdalsvatn, north Iceland, reveals natural and anthropogenic impacts on terrestrial and aquatic environments\n\nDavid J.

An enhanced seasonal cycle suggests that the tropical rainfall belt shifted northwards between 1855–1917. We explain this with greater warming in the NE Indian Ocean relative to the SE, which strengthens surface winds and coastal upwelling, leading to greater cooling in the eastern Indian Ocean south of the Equator.\n\nDroughts of the Early 19th Century (1790–1830) in Northeast Iberian Peninsula: Integration of historical and instrumental data for high-resolution reconstructions of extreme events\n\nJosep Barriendos, MarÃ­a HernÃ¡ndez, Salvador Gil-Guirado, Jorge Olcina Cantos, and Mariano Barriendos\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-832,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-832, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for CP (discussion: final response, 6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrent uncertainty caused by climate change justifies the analysis of the most severe and less frequent droughts.

The study of these episodes using historical documentary sources and early instrumental records allows to identify episodes resembling the current ones. This knowledge allows better management of water resources in similar situations that may occur in future scenarios.\n\nA global Data Assimilation of Moisture Patterns from 21,000–0 BP (DAMP-21ka) using lake level proxy records\n\nChristopher L.

Instead, an absence of moraines from the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene suggests the ice sheet was less extensive than present at that time.\n\nLate Quaternary glacial maxima in Southern Patagonia: insights from the Lago Argentino glacier lobe\n\nMatias Romero, Shanti B.

Using a global climate model, we investigate climate conditions near the AIS during the Last Interglacial (129 to 116 kyr ago), a period with warmer global temperatures and higher sea level than today. We identify the orbital and freshwater forcings that could cause ice loss and probe the mechanisms that lead to warmer climate conditions.\n\nA global analysis of reconstructed land climate changes during Dansgaard-Oeschger events\n\nMengmeng Liu, Iain Colin Prentice, and Sandy P.

We show that changes in the northern extratropics and the southern extratropics were anti-phased, with warming over most of the north and cooling in the south. The reconstructions do not provide evidence for a change in seasonality in temperature. However, they do indicate that warming was generally accompanied by wetter conditions and cooling by drier conditions.\n\nNorth American Pleistocene Glacial Erosion and Thin Pliocene Regolith Thickness Inferred from Data-Constrained Fully Coupled Ice-Climate-Sediment modelling\n\nMatthew Drew and Lev Tarasov\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-620,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-620, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for CP (discussion: open, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe model the sediment-ice-climate system over North America for the last 2.58 Myr showing that ice sheets are capable of excavating features the size of the Hudson bay.

However, the driving mechanism of this pulsed discharge remains unclear. We compare three previously proposed hypotheses and examine the role of relevant system processes. We find ice stream surge cycling is the most likely mechanism, but its character is sensitive to both the geothermal heat flux and the form of the basal drag law.\n\nTwo severe famines (1809–1810, 1814–1814) in Korea during the last stage of the little ice age (1809–1819)\n\nSung Woo Kim\n\nClim.

The amount of air occluded (total air content) mainly reflects air pressure when the air is occluded and is therefore a proxy for elevation. However, there are several complications, such as melt, changes in firn structure and air pressure variability. We measured total air content in the RECAP ice core on the Renland Icecap in East Greenland. The core covers the period back to 121 thousand years before present.\n\nContrasting the Penultimate and Last Glacial Maxima (140 and 21 ka BP) using coupled climate-ice sheet modelling\n\nViolet L.

When direct observations are not available, one can use indirect observations such as tide gauges, which measure the sea-level in portal cities. The sea level rises when local air pressure decreases, and when wind pushes water towards the coast. Several centuries-long tide gauge records are available. We show that these can be complementary to direct pressure observations for studying storms and anticyclones in the 19th century.\n\nClimatic impacts on mortality in pre-industrial Sweden\n\nTzu Tung Chen, Rodney Edvinsson, Karin Modig, Hans W.

This disconnect between isotopes and temperature is largely driven by changes in Antarctic sea ice.

Comprehensive analysis of indicators shows that a climate transition in 1920 AD, from cold and wet in the early period (1816–1920 AD) to relatively warm and dry in the late period (1920–2019 AD). Solar radiation drives this climate transition, with greenhouse gases acting as a positive feedback.\n\nSouth Asian summer monsoon enhanced by the uplift of Iranian Plateau in Middle Miocene\n\nMeng Zuo, Yong Sun, Yan Zhao, Gilles Ramstein, Lin Ding, and Tianjun Zhou\n\nClim.

The elevated IP insulates the warm and moist airs in the south of the IP and produces a low-level cyclonic circulation, which leads to the convergence of the warm and moist air in the northwestern India and enhancing the monsoonal precipitation.\n\nAbrupt climate change and millennial-scale cycles: an astronomical mechanism\n\nAlison Kelsey\n\nClim.

This paper provides statistically-significant results, highlighting the previously, unknown major role played by the Moon in forcing concurrent, millennial-scale, cyclical fluctuation of total solar irradiance, insolation, and gravitation due its influence on Earth-Sun distance that is strongest when Earth is at perihelion.\n\nResponse of terrigenous weathering to the African monsoon during the penultimate deglaciation and the last interglacial period\n\nChristopher John Lepre, Clara Chang, and Owen Yazzie\n\nClim.

We use such a record to demonstrate that, depending on latitude, the monsoon responds differently to climate perturbations. This has implications not only for future environmental change but also for interpreting archaeological patterns of Middle Stone Age human groups.\n\nPaleoclimatic value of sediment pixel intensity time series from Lago Argentino, Patagonia\n\nMaximillian Van Wyk de Vries, Emi Ito, Mark Shapley, Matias Romero, and Guido Brignone\n\nClim.

We show that sediment color and climate are linked at Lago Argentino, the world's largest ice-contact lake, but that this relationship is too complex to be used for reconstructing past climate. We instead use this sediment color-climate relationship to show that temperature and wind speed affect sediment deposition in the summer, but not in the winter.\n\nAn Early-Mid Holocene process of regional desertification recorded in aeolian sediments from the northern slope of the middle Himalayan Mountains\n\nYang Gao, Keqi Zhang, Zhonghai Wu, Tingting Tian, Hailong Gai, Jiameng Zuo, and Bin Li\n\nClim.

However, the accurate timing and global correlation of short-term glacial-to-deglacial changes of MOC in various ocean basins still present a major challenge now met by the fine structure of jumps and plateaus in atmospheric and planktic radiocarbon (14C) concentration that reflect authentic changes in atmospheric 14C production.\n\nMid-Holocene rainfall changes in the southwestern Pacific\n\nCinthya Esther Nava Fernandez, Tobias Braun, Bethany Fox, Adam Hartland, Ola Kwiecien, Chelsea Pederson, Sebastian Hoepker, Stefano Bernasconi, Madalina Jaggi, John Hellstrom, Fernando GÃ¡zquez, Amanda French, Norbert Marwan, Adrian Immenhauser, and Sebastian Franz Martin Breitenbach\n\nClim.

Paleoenvironmental proxies often show inconsistencies and age estimations can vary depending on the method used. We show the potential of paleoclimate simulations to address those discrepancies, illustrating the strong potential of our cross-disciplinary approach to refine the context of archaeo/paleontological sites.\n\nPalaeobiological evidence for Southern Hemisphere Younger Dryas and volcanogenic cold periods\n\nRichard N.

The sequence in the north-western South Island revealed a return to glacial climate during the time of the Northern Hemisphere Younger Dryas cold period, and not the Antarctic Cold Reversal as predicted. Ages on moa fossils provide detailed on site records of vegetation. The moa-defined cold period corresponded exactly to the Younger Dryas as recorded in the GISP2 Greenland ice core.\n\nMilankovic Pseudo-cycles Recorded in Sediments and Ice Cores Extracted by Singular Spectrum Analysis\n\nFernando Lopes, Pierpaolo Zuddas, Vincent Courtillot, Jean-Louis Le MouÃ«l, Jean-Baptiste BoulÃ©, Alexis Maineult, and Marc GÃ¨ze\n\nClim.

SSA of the stack contains not only the main expected Milankovic periods but also a rich collection of “secondary” periods. This validates at the same time our iterative SSA method, the orbital model and the remarkable benthic stack, with more than 15 “ Milankovic periods”.\n\nWas there a glacial outburst flood in the Torngat Mountains during Marine Isotope Stage 3?\n\nTamara Pico, Jane Willenbring, April S.

We dated the lake to ~56 ± 3 ka and estimated the freshwater volume that may have been released during an outburst flood. The location of this glacial lake is surprising because the Torngat Mountains are considered a site of glacial inception, and this shoreline suggests the region was not ice-covered throughout the North American ice sheet growth phase.\n\nUncertainties in the atmospheric loading to ice-sheet deposition for volcanic aerosols and implications for forcing reconstruction\n\nYa Gao and Chaochao Gao\n\nClim.

We use multiple proxies including clay mineral analysis on low latitude sediments in China to unveil past climates and correlate cool and humid climates with glacials and warm and humid climates to interglacials. Our results track high latitude glacial rhythms and show glacial cycles drove plant evolution and terrestrial environment change in low latitudes.\n\nClimate history of the principality of Transylvania during the Maunder Minimum (MM) years (1645–1715 CE)\n\nMartin Stangl and Ulrich Foelsche\n\nClim.

For a larger period (1500–1950), we examined on a decadal basis the extent to which an influence on the climate through long-term fluctuations in solar activity, as was inferred from isotope reconstructions from ice cores, can be seen.\n\nA theory of glacial cycles: resolving Pleistocene puzzles\n\nHsien-Wang Ou\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2021-94,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2021-94, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review (discussion: closed, 5 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a theory of the glacial cycles for which the ocean constitutes the intermediary of the orbital forcing of the ice volume. We show that the ocean is bistable, so is the ice sheet, which thus allows large ice-volume signal when modulated forcing exceeds certain thresholds. Such thresholds are set by the global-mean convective flux, which is lowered during the Pleistocene cooling, so the model can explain the mid-Pleistocene transition and resolve many longstanding glacial puzzles.\n\nSynchronous Northern and Southern Hemisphere response of the westerly wind belt to solar forcing\n\nNathalie Van der Putten, Florian Adolphi, Anette MellstrÃ¶m, Jesper Sjolte, Cyriel Verbruggen, Jan-Berend Stuut, Tobias Erhardt, Yves Frenot, and Raimund Muscheler\n\nClim.

We present a terrestrial SHW proxy-record and find stronger SHW influence at Crozet, shortly after 2.8 ka BP, synchronous with a climate shift in the Northern Hemisphere, attributed to a major decline in solar activity. The bipolar response to solar forcing is supported by a climate model forced by solar irradiance only.\n\nRevised alkenone δ13C based CO2 estimates during the Plio-Pleistocene\n\nOsamu Seki and James Bendle\n\nClim.

However, estimates of CO2 level markedly differ among the data. We revised reported alkenone δ13C based CO2 records from the Pliocene to Pleistocene based on a refined approach. Our approach significantly reduced the large offsets between reported alkenone δ13C CO2 records, confirming that better constraints on environmental variables are key aspects for improving alkenone δ13C based CO2 estimates.\n\nThe 4.2 ka event in East Asian monsoon region, precisely reconstructed by multi-proxies of stalagmite\n\nChao-Jun Chen, Dao-Xian Yuan, Jun-Yun Li, Xian-Feng Wang, Hai Cheng, You-Feng Ning, R.
