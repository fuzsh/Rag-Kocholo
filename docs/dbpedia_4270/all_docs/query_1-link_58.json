        "text": "After completing my PhD and postdoctoral work in the area of Human Statistical Genetics, I joined Genentech in 2009 due to its unique environment of extraordinary basic science research coupled with outstanding translational expertise. Here I use my technical background to analyze the wealth of in-house and external genetic datasets to discover new targets and biomarkers for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\n\nMy main focus is on leveraging Human Genetics for target and biomarker discovery in Neuroscience. To this end we analyze data from our clinical trials, in-house experiments, Genomewide association studies, and large biobanks (e.g. UK Biobank). We work closely with the experimental scientists for functional follow-up of new discoveries from genetic studies and evaluation/development of targets.\n\nMy group also works on developing the analysis infrastructure used by Human Genetics Department where we implement the latest technics for analysis of large-scale sequencing data, genetic association analysis, and integration of results with other types of data e.g. eQTL, functional genomics experiments, gene networks."
