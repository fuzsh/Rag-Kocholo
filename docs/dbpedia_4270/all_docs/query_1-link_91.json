        "text": "Women who Worked with Marie Curie.\n\nPubMed\n\nPigeard-Micault, Natalie\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMarie Curie directed a research laboratory for 28 years. Between 1906 and 1934, forty five women worked under her guidance. Some were, and are, well-known in their own countries as their first woman full professor such as Ellen Gleditsch or Margaret von Wrangel, but for twenty eight of them, who were often French, nothing has ever been written. The strong presence of women in Marie Curie's laboratory has often been highlighted and has been considered as an exception, and the result of deliberate choice. Of course, these women did not choose this workplace by accident. They knew its director was a woman, a laureate of one, and after 1911, two Nobel Prizes, who was leading a well-equipped laboratory with an important radioactive source. But how did Marie Curie selected her collaborators among the many applications she received? Was her choice influenced by gender? A prosopographical research based on genealogical researches and new sources explains this presence contextually and sheds light on several questions : where did these women come from, what were their social and geographic origins, did they occupy any specific cultural or technical area inside Curie's lab, what future did they have after the laboratory? Through their lives, we can question the existence, or not, of a one profile of the female researcher in scientific areas in France.\n\nMarie Curie: Physicist and Woman\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHowes, Ruth\n\nMarie Sklodowska was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867. Girls were not allowed to attend college in Poland, so Marie found a well-paying post as a governess in rural village which she held for three years while helping her older sister complete medical school in Paris. Then Marie moved to Paris and graduated first in her class at the Sorbonne with a master's degree in physics in 1893. In 1895, she married the talented young physicist, Pierre Curie. Marie decided to investigate the radioactive components of the mineral pitchblende for her dissertation. The work involved chemical analysis of a ton of material in an unheated shed. Pierre joined her and at the end of 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of radium and polonium. Through 1899, Marie labored to measure the atomic weight of radium. In 1903, Marie earned her doctorate, the first for a woman in France, and the Curies split the Nobel Prize in Physics with Henri Becquerel. They became widely known, besieged by the press and frequently invited to make presentations and be awarded honors. They hated fame and both suffered bad health. In April, 1906, Pierre Curie was struck by a wagon and killed instantly. Marie was left as a single mother with two young daughters. Fortunately, the Sorbonne hired her to fill Pierre's position. In 1911, she was rejected for membership in the French Academy of Science because she was a woman. Also in 1911, she was accused of having an affair with a married French physicist Paul Langevin. The resulting scandal hit the press and brought angry mobs to her home. In the middle of this hullaballoo, she was informed that she had won a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry. When World War I broke out, Marie mounted x-ray units on cars and became a heroine. She visited the United States in 1921 where President Harding presented her with a gram of radium. She continued her scientific studies in spite of declining health until her death in 1934. Professor Emerita.\n\nThe research school of Marie Curie in the Paris faculty, 1907-14.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, J L\n\n1995-07-01\n\nAs the most famous woman scientist of the twentieth century, there has been no shortage of books and articles on the life and career of Marie Curie (1867-1934). Her role as director of a laboratory-based research school in the new scientific field of radioactivity, a field which embraced both chemistry and physics, however, has never been examined. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the question of research schools, and Morrell, Ravetz, Geison, and Klosterman, amongst others, have written on this subject. Using, in part, the methodology of Morrell, this paper investigates the role of Marie Curie as a school director in the Paris Faculty in the years 1907-14, examining the work and characteristics of her school and assessing her effectiveness as a director.\n\nMarie Curie's Doctoral Thesis: Prelude to a Nobel Prize.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWolke, Robert L.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nTraces the life and research techniques of Marie Curie's doctoral dissertation leading to the discovery and purification of radium from ore.

(ML)\n\nThe Pasteurization of Marie Curie: A (meta)biographical experiment.\n\nPubMed\n\nWirtÃ©n, Eva Hemmungs\n\n2015-08-01\n\nBiographies of scientists occupy a liminal space, highly popular with general readers but questioned in academia. Nonetheless, in recent years, historians of science have not only embraced the genre with more enthusiasm and less guilt, they have also turned to the metabiography in order to renew the study and story of scientists' roles. This essay focuses on Marie Curie, the world's most famous female scientist, in order to unpack some of the theoretical and methodological claims of the science biography, and especially to address the sexing mechanisms at play in the construction of the biographical subject. Pierre Curie (1923), Marie's biography of her husband Pierre, paid tribute to her dead husband and collaborator, but also allowed Curie a legitimate outlet to construct her own persona and legacy. Categories such as personhood, person, and persona are not only central to the biography genre but also are essential to the sense of self and self-fashioning of scientists. Looking at how Marie Curie negotiated these categories in Pierre Curie not only gives new insight into Curie's self-fashioning strategies but may also shed some light on the more general analytical lacunae of the science biography.\n\nMarie Curie: the Curie Institute in Senegal to Nuclear Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGueye, Paul\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is not a place where one will look first when radioactivity or nuclear physics is mentioned. Conducting forefront research at the international stage at US national facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia or the National Superconducting Cyclotron Facility/Facility for Rare Isotope Beams in Michigan does not point to Historically Black Colleges either. The two are actually intrinsically connected as my personal journey from my early exposure to radiation at the Curie Institute at the LeDantec Hospital in Senegal lead me to Hampton University. The former, through one of my uncles, catapulted me into a nuclear physics PhD while the latter houses the only nuclear physics program at an HBCU to date that has established itself as one of the premier programs in the nation. This talk will review the impact of Marie Curie in my life as a nuclear physicist.\n\nMarie Curie's contribution to Medical Physics.\n\nPubMed\n\nJean-Claude, Rosenwald; NÃ¼sslin, Fridtjof\n\n2013-09-01\n\nOn occasion of its 50th anniversary, the International Organization for Medical Physics (IOMP) from now on is going to celebrate annually an International Day of Medical Physics for which the 7th November, the birthday of Marie Sklodowska Curie, a most exceptional character in science at all and a pioneer of medical physics, has been chosen. This article briefly outlines her outstanding personality, sketches her fundamental discovery of radioactivity and emphasizes the impact of her various achievements on the development of medical physics at large.

A hundred and ten years after the discovery of radium.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiamantis, Aristidis; Magiorkinis, Emmanouil; Papadimitriou, Athanasios; Androutsos, Georgios\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis review aims to commemorate the life, and the accomplishments of Pierre and Marie Curie in Physics and in Medicine. Although they are primarily known for their discoveries of the elements of radium and polonium, which took place two years after the discovery of radioactivity by Henry Becquerel, Pierre's discovery of the piezo-electric phenomenon, his research on crystal symmetry, magnetism and paramagnetic substances, are equally important. With the discovery of the two radioactive elements, Pierre and Marie Curie established the new field of Nuclear Physics. It is not an over-statement to say that their discovery contributed much to our modern way of life. Marie received the Nobel Prize twice and later she became the first woman to become member of the French Academy of Sciences. Today, both Pierre and Marie Curie rest in PanthÃ©on, in Paris.\n\nIntroduction to the ECâs Marie Curie Initial Training Network Project: The European Training Network in Digital Medical Imaging for Radiotherapy (ENTERVISION)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDosanjh, Manjit; Cirilli, Manuela; Navin, Sparsh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, the ENTERVISION Marie Curie Initial Training Network has been training 15 young researchers from a variety of backgrounds on topics ranging from in-beam Positron Emission Tomography or Single Particle Tomography techniques, to adaptive treatment planning, optical imaging, Monte Carlo simulations and biological phantom design. This article covers the main research activities, as well as the training scheme implemented by the participating institutes, which included academia, research, and industry. PMID:26697403\n\nThe discovery of radium in 1898 by Maria Sklodowska-Curie (1867-1934) and Pierre Curie (1859-1906) with commentary on their life and times.\n\nPubMed\n\nMould, R F\n\n1998-12-01\n\nThis review celebrates the events of 100 years ago to the month of publication of this December 1998 issue of the British Journal of Radiology, when radium was discovered by the Curies. This followed the earlier discovery in November 1895 of X-rays by RÃ¶ntgen, which has already been reviewed in the British Journal of Radiology [1] and the discovery in March 1896, by Becquerel, of the phenomenon of radioactivity, which introduces this review. This is particularly relevant as Marie Curie was in 1897 a research student in Becquerel's laboratory. Marie Curie's life in Poland prior to her 1891 departure for Paris is included in this review as are other aspects of her life and work such as her work in World War I with radiological ambulances (known as \"Little Curies\") on the battlefields of France and Belgium, early experiments with radium and the founding of the Institut du Radium in Paris and of the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Wherever possible I have included appropriate quotations in Marie Curie's own words [2-4] and each section is related in some way to the life and work of Maria or Pierre. This review is completed with details of the re-interment of the bodies of Pierre and Marie on 20 April 1995 in The PanthÃ©on, Paris.\n\nMarie\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2003-02-03\n\nMarie Curie rover drives down the rear ramp during Operational Readiness Test ORT 4.

The meeting was hosted by the participating center University of Skopje (SKO) - Goce Spasovski and MASA - Momir Polenakovic (R. Macedonia). The representative from MASA proteomic research center - Katerina Davalieva (R. Macedonia) had presentation on proteomic research in prostate cancer (PCa). 40 researchers from 13 different countries participated at the meeting. The Workshop was devoted on \"Chronic Kidney Disease: Clinical Management issues\", and consisted of 15 oral presentations given by nephrologists and experts in the field of CKD. Raymond Vanholder (Belgium) - past president of ERA-EDTA had a keynote lecture on \"CKD: Questions that need to be answered and are not (or at least not entirely)\". The workshop continued in four sessions with lectures from Alberto Ortiz (Spain), Olivera Stojceva-Taneva (R. Macedonia), Dimitrios Goumenos (Greece), Joachim Beige (Germany), Marian Klinger (Poland), Goce Spasovski (R. Macedonia), Joachim Jankowski (Germany), Adalbert Schiller (Romania), Robert Johnson (USA), Franco Ferrario (Italy), Ivan Rychlik (Czech Republic), Fulvio Magni (Italy) and Giovambattista Capasso (Italy), all covering a training theme. Within the meeting there were two lectures on complimentary skills for ethics in science and career advancement from two principal investigators - Goce Spasovski (R. Macedonia) and Joost Schanstra (France). During the Regular Meeting, 13 PhD students i.e. Early Stage Researchers and one Experienced Researcher from both Programs presented their work and progress within iMODE-CKD and BCMolMed projects.

The project is coordinated at the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and will run until February 2018. In the last 15 years advances in novel mass-spectrometric methods have opened opportunities to identify \"isotopic fingerprints\" of virtually all metals and to make use of the complete information contained in these fingerprints. The understanding developed with these new tools will ultimately guide the exploitation of Earth surface environments. However, progress in bringing these methods to end-users depends on a multi transfer of knowledge between (1) isotope Geochemistry and Microbiology, Environmental Sciences (2), Economic Geology and (3) instrument developers and users in the development of user-friendly and new mass spectrometric methods. IsoNose will focus on three major Earth surface resources: soil, water and metals. These resources are currently being exploited to an unprecedented extent and their efficient management is essential for future sustainable development. Novel stable isotope techniques will disclose the processes generating (e.g. weathering, mineral ore formation) and destroying (e.g. erosion, pollution) these resources. Within this field the following questions will be addressed and answered: - How do novel stable isotope signatures characterize weathering processes? - How do novel stable isotope signatures trace water transport? - How to use novel stable isotope as environmental tracers? - How to use novel stable isotope for detecting and exploring metal ores? - How to improve analytical capabilities and develop robust routine applications for novel stable isotopes? Starting from the central questions mentioned above the IsoNose activities are organized in five scientific work packages: 1\n\nDeveloping translational medicine professionals: the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie action model.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetrelli, Alessandra; Prakken, Berent J; Rosenblum, Norman D\n\n2016-11-29\n\nEnd goal of translational medicine is to combine disciplines and expertise to eventually promote improvement of the global healthcare system by delivering effective therapies to individuals and society. Well-trained experts of the translational medicine process endowed with profound knowledge of biomedical technology, ethical and clinical issues, as well as leadership and teamwork abilities are essential for the effective development of tangible therapeutic products for patients. In this article we focus on education and, in particular, we discuss how programs providing training on the broad spectrum of the translational medicine continuum have still a limited degree of diffusion and do not provide professional support and mentorship in the long-term, resulting in the lack of well established professionals of translational medicine (TMPs) in the scientific community. Here, we describe the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Actions program ITN-EUtrain (EUropean Translational tRaining for Autoimmunity & Immune manipulation Network) where training on the Translational Medicine machinery was integrated with education on professional and personal skills, mentoring, and a long-lasting network of TMPs.\n\nDevelopments in damage assessment by Marie SkÅodowska-Curie TRUSS ITN project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzÃ¡lez, A.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe growth of cities, the impacts of climate change and the massive cost of providing new infrastructure provide the impetus for TRUSS (Training in Reducing Uncertainty in Structural Safety), a â¬3.7 million Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Action Innovative Training Network project funded by EUâs Horizon 2020 programme, which aims to maximize the potential of infrastructure that already exists (http://trussitn.eu). For that purpose, TRUSS brings together an international, inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration between five academic and eleven industry institutions from five European countries. The project covers rail and road infrastructure, buildings and energy and marine infrastructure. This paper reports progress in fields such as advanced sensor-based structural health monitoring solutions - unmanned aerial vehicles, optical backscatter reflectometry, monitoring sensors mounted on vehicles, â¦ - and innovative algorithms for structural designs and short- and long-term assessments of buildings, bridges, pavements, ships, ship unloaders, nuclear components and wind turbine towers that will support infrastructure operators and owners in managing their assets.\n\nRedefining the Poet as Healer: Valerie Gillies's Collaborative Role in the Edinburgh Marie Curie Hospice Quiet Room Project.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeverin, Laura\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article examines the poetic contribution of Valerie Gillies, Edinburgh Makar (or poet of the city) from 2005-2008, to the Edinburgh Marie Curie Hospice Quiet Room, a new contemplation space for patients, families, and staff. In collaboration with others, Gillies created a transitional space for the Quiet Room, centered on the display of her sonnet, \"A Place Apart.\" This space functions to comfort visitors to the Quiet Room by relocating them in their surroundings and offering the solace provided by nature and history. With this project, her first as Edinburgh Makar, Gillies redefines the role of the poet as healer and advocates for newer forms of palliative care that focus on patients' spiritual and emotional, as well as physical, wellbeing.\n\nIntroduction to the EC's Marie Curie Initial Training Network (MC-ITN) project: Particle Training Network for European Radiotherapy (PARTNER).\n\nPubMed\n\nDosanjh, Manjit; Magrin, Giulio\n\n2013-07-01\n\nPARTNER (Particle Training Network for European Radiotherapy) is a project funded by the European Commission's Marie Curie-ITN funding scheme through the ENLIGHT Platform for 5.6 million Euro. PARTNER has brought together academic institutes, research centres and leading European companies, focusing in particular on a specialized radiotherapy (RT) called hadron therapy (HT), interchangeably referred to as particle therapy (PT). The ultimate goal of HT is to deliver more effective treatment to cancer patients leading to major improvement in the health of citizens. In Europe, several hundred million Euro have been invested, since the beginning of this century, in PT. In this decade, the use of HT is rapidly growing across Europe, and there is an urgent need for qualified researchers from a range of disciplines to work on its translational research. In response to this need, the European community of HT, and in particular 10 leading academic institutes, research centres, companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, joined together to form the PARTNER consortium. All partners have international reputations in the diverse but complementary fields associated with PT: clinical, radiobiological and technological. Thus the network incorporates a unique set of competencies, expertise, infrastructures and training possibilities. This paper describes the status and needs of PT research in Europe, the importance of and challenges associated with the creation of a training network, the objectives, the initial results, and the expected long-term benefits of the PARTNER initiative.\n\nPioneers of nuclear medicine, Madame Curie.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrammaticos, Philip C\n\n2004-01-01\n\n, she is not known neither by that full name nor as Maria Sklodowska but as Marie Curie. Madame Curie was the second of five children. At the age of 24 she went to Sorbonne-Paris after being invited by her sister Bronja to study for about 2-3 years; instead she stayed in Paris for her whole life. Her doctorate was on the subject: \"Research on radioactive substances\" which she completed in six years under the supervision of H. Becquerel. Pierre Curie was Director of the Physics Laboratory of the Ecole Municipale of Physics and Industrial Chemistry when he married M. Curie in 1895. Pierre Curie left his other research projects and worked full time with his wife. In this laboratory M. Curie and her husband Pierre discovered radium and polonium. In 1901 Pierre Curie induced a radiation burn on his forearm by applying on his skin radiferous barium chloride for 10 hours. During World War I, M.Curie organized for the Red Cross a fleet of radiological ambulances each with X-ray apparates which were called \"Little Curies\". The X-ray tubes of these apparates were unshielded and so M.Curie was exposed to high doses of radiation. Once an ambulance fell into a ditch and M.Curie who was inside the ambulance was badly bruised and stayed at home for 3 days. M. Curie with her daughters, Irene and Eve, was invited and visited America in 1921. She led a successful campaign to collect radium for her experiments. Before leaving America, President Harding donated through her to the Radium Institute of Paris 1 g of radium for research purposes. At that time the process to obtain 0.5 g of pure radium bromide required 1 ton of ore and 5 tons of chemicals. No measures of radiation protection were taken back then. In 1929 Madame Curie visited the United States for a second time. She met with President Hoover and with the help of the Polish women's association in America collected funds for another gram of radium. Madame Curie died of leukemia on July 4, 1934. Sixty years after her death her\n\nGoing to School with Madame Curie and Mr. Einstein: Gender Roles in Children's Science Biographies\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOwens, Trevor\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOne of the first places children encounter science and scientists is children's literature.

C.; Pulupa, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe CUbesat Radio Interferometry Experiment (CURIE) is a proposed two-element radio interferometer, based on proven and developed digital radio receivers and designed to fit within a Cubesat platform. CURIE will launch as a 6U Cubesat and then separate into two 3U Cubesats once in orbit. CURIE measures radio waves from 0.1-19MHz, which must be measured from space, as those frequencies fall below the cutoff imposed by Earth's ionosphere. The principal science objective for CURIE is to use radio interferometry to study radio burst emissions from solar eruptive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere, providing observations important for our understanding of the heliospheric space weather environment. The influence of space weather can be felt at Earth and other planets, as radiation levels increase and lead to auroral activity and geomagnetic effects. CURIE will be able to determine the location and size of radio burst source regions and then to track their movement outward from the Sun. In addition to the primary objective CURIE will measure the gradients of the local ionospheric density and electron temperature on the spatial scale of a few kilometers, as well as create an improved map of the radio sky at these unexplored frequencies. A space based radio interferometry observatory has long been envisioned, in orbit around the Earth or the Moon, or on the far side of the Moon. Beyond its important science objectives, CURIE will prove that the concept of a dedicated space-based interferometer can be realized by using relatively cheap Cubesats. CURIE will therefore not only provide new important science results but also serve as a pathfinder in the development of new space-based radio observation techniques for helio- and astro-physics.\n\n[Maria SkÅodowska-Curie and Piotr Curie an epoch-makingin year 1898].\n\nPubMed\n\nWielogÃ³rski, Zbigniew\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFor many reasons the year 1898 was unusual for Maria SkÅodowska-Curie and her husband. After defining the subject of the doctoral thesis and choosing Henri Becqerel as thesis supervisor, Maria started intensive experimental work. In the allotted room called storeroom, in conditions that were far too inadequate, they managed to put up a unique measuring equipment composed of instruments whose originator was Pierre Curie. In the ionization chamber and in the piezoelectric quartz charges formed, whose mutual neutralization was shown by the quadrant electrometer. Ionization current, which was measured quantitatively, was proportional to the radiation of the sample. Studying many elements, their compounds and minerals enabled Maria to state that uranium is not the only element endowed with the power of radiation; the second one turned out to be thorium. Anomaly detected in the radiation of uranium minerals made it possible for Maria to draw an extremely important conclusion: radioactive uranium and thorium are not the only elements endowed with such an attribute. Pitchblende, which was studied by the Curie couple, had to contain also other radioactive substances. Gustave BÃ©mont also participated in the chemical analysis of the uranium ore and it is worth reminding that he was involved in the discovery of polonium and uranium. The phenomenon of radioactivity couldn't have been explained if it was not for the sources of strong radioactivity. Those sources undoubtedly could have been the discovered elements but their scanty content in the uranium ore made their isolation very difficult and laborious. Access to industrial remains after procession of pitchblende from Jachymov (Sankt Joachimstahl), obtained owing to the mediation of Eduard Suess, provided the source of this raw material. From it, in a shack also called le hangar, the Curie couple isolated the first samples of the radium salt.

The Borborema Province is part of the neoproterozoic collision of an orogenic system situated between the SÃ£o Francisco-Congo and SÃ£o LuÃ­s-West Africa cratons, which formed the Gondwana Supercontinent. The Curie surface of Borborema Province varies from 18 to 59 km, which reveals the complexity in the crustal composition of the study area. The thermal structure shows different crustal blocks separated by the main shear zones, which corroborates the evolution model of allochthonous terranes. The Curie surface signature for the west portion of Pernambuco Shear Zone may indicate processes of mantle serpentinization, once the Curie isotherm is deeper than Mohorovic discontinuity. In this region, the amplitude of Bouguer anomaly decreases, which corroborates long wavelength anomaly observed in the magnetic anomaly. We interpreted this pattern as evidence of the Brasiliano-Pan-Africano's subduction/collision event. Earthquakes in the region are concentrated mainly in shallow Curie surface regions (less resistant crust) and in transition zones between warm and cold blocks. We calculated the horizontal gradient of the Curie depth to emphasize the signature of contact between the thermal blocks. These regions mark possible crustal discontinuities, and have high correlation with orogenic gold occurrence in the study area.\n\nWomen in landscape architecture and heritage conservation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBostenaru-Dan, Maria; Theodoridou, Magda; Hayashi, Mikiko; Anghelache, Mirela Adriana\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis contribution present research done by Marie Curie fellows in Italy. The first author investigated early landscape architecture in Italy, by Italian and by mobile Romanian landscape planers. The very first one was princess Jeanne Ghyca, who did the parterre d'eau at villa Gamberaia by Florence. This villa influenced the landscape architecture of Italy such as Piero Porcinai or Marie Teresa Parpagliolo. Maria Teresa Parpagliolo is the next name to deal as, since she designed the landscape of the EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma), in a time when Mussolini denied the contribution of women. Water characterises also this planning, with an aquarium being built currently under the lake. Maria Teresa Parpagliolo also worked with Elena Luzzatto, the first women architect in Italy, at the design of the military cemetery in Rome. This work will also be presented. Elena Luzzatto contributed to other Roman cemeteries as well, designing funerary stones for Verano and the cemetery at Prima Porta which will be presented. The work on cemeteries will be put in context of Rome (acatholic cemetery for example) and Italy (Carlo Scarpa, Aldo Rossi contributions). The investigation on the role of women will be compared to other programmes dealing with, for example the COST network genderSTE dealing with cities and climate change which are relevant for landscape, and MOMOWO, a European culture project on early woman planers. The next two authors did research on conservation issues, through the network EPISCON, and this is resulting in role models for the GEMS booklet and the Romanian role models booklet. The fourth author also was a Marie Curie fellow in Italy, at the ROSE school in Pavia, doing research on earthquake mitigation along with the first author's Marie Curie stay. The story will also be promoted in the Marie Curie Alumni chapter Romania.\n\nReviews Book: Marie Curie: A Biography Book: Fast Car Physics Book: Beautiful Invisible Equipment: Fun Fly Stick Science Kit Book: Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You Book: Chaos: The Science of Predictable Random Motion Book: Seven Wonders of the Universe Book: Special Relativity Equipment: LabVIEWTM 2009 Education Edition Places to Visit: Edison and Ford Winter Estates Places to Visit: The Computer History Museum Web Watch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWE RECOMMEND Fun Fly Stick Science Kit Fun fly stick introduces electrostatics to youngsters Special Relativity Text makes a useful addition to the study of relativity as an undergraduate LabVIEWTM 2009 Education Edition LabVIEW sets industry standard for gathering and analysing data, signal processing, instrumentation design and control, and automation and robotics Edison and Ford Winter Estates Thomas Edison's home is open to the public The Computer History Museum Take a walk through technology history at this computer museum WORTH A LOOK Fast Car Physics Book races through physics Beautiful Invisible The main subject of this book is theoretical physics Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You A guide to physics on the large and small scale Chaos: The Science of Predictable Random Motion Book explores the mathematics behind chaotic behaviour Seven Wonders of the Universe A textual trip through the wonderful universe HANDLE WITH CARE Marie Curie: A Biography Book fails to capture Curie's science WEB WATCH Web clips to liven up science lessons\n\nCurie-Montgolfiere Planetary Explorers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaylor, Chris Y.; Hansen, Jeremiah\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHot-air balloons, also known as Montgolfiere balloons, powered by heat from radioisotope decay are a potentially useful tool for exploring planetary atmospheres and augmenting the capabilities of other exploration technologies. This paper describes the physical equations and identifies the key engineering parameters that drive radioisotope-powered balloon performance. These parameters include envelope strength-to-weight, envelope thermal conductivity, heater power-to-weight, heater temperature, and balloon shape. The design space for these parameters are shown for varying atmospheric compositions to illustrate the performance needed to build functioning ``Curie-Montgolfiere'' balloons for various planetary atmospheres.

Since SSC was originally proposed, there have been considerable efforts regarding the understanding of the physics that rules the thermal instabilities of the SSC (e.g. Dumoulin et al, 1999; Solomatov and Moresi, 2000). Over the last several years, it is understood that the interaction between the plate movement and the SSC tends to form longitudinal (LRs or also called 'Richter rolls') and transverse rolls (TRs), of which the axis is parallel and perpendicular to the plate motion, respectively. The geometry of these rolls have been been recently inferred by Li et al (2013) using Curie depths from the North Atlantic as proxies for plates temperatures. They showed that Curie depths have a large oscillating and heterogeneous patterns that could be related to SSC. In the North Atlantic transverse rolls seem predominant. In this work we analyze, by means of 3D dynamical numerical simulations, the influence of SSC on the Curie depths patterns observed in the North Atlantic and Pacific plates. We investigate the behaviour of the Curie isotherms trying to determine if SSC is able to reproduce the observed data, and the influence of several poorly constrained rheological parameters. Our numerical simulations show that: a) using realistic laboratory-constrained rheologies and temperature it is possible to modify temperatures as low as those at Curie depths; b) transverse rolls are generated as well as longitudinal rolls on those isotherms; c) the spreading rate is a first order control on the developing of transverse rolls.

J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA systematic study was carried out to decipher the mechanism of Curie transition of piezoelectric crystals of poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE). The unique polarity of P(VDF-TrFE) crystalline phase below curie transition temperature is attributed to the lattice packing of all-trans molecular chains, which allocates all the substituted fluorine atoms on one side of molecular chains and hydrogen atoms on the other side. Therefore, a net dipole moment is created across the lateral packing of molecular chains. Nevertheless, due to the mutual repulsion among fluorene atoms, this all-trans conformation is not stable, and ready to change above Curie temperature, where thermal kinetic energy is sufficient to cause segmental rotation. As being illustrated by in-situ recorded X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis, the concerned curie transition is deciphered as a one-step process which is involved two process and this is different from conventional one-step solid-solid transitions. Accompanied with this one-step process during heating, the occurrence of lamellar bending is inferred for elucidating the decline of stacking regularity of crystalline lamellae, which reversibly recover during subsequent cooling. However, as the crystalline lamellae of P(VDF-TrFE) are confined in between the stacking of crystalline lamellae of PVDF, lamellar bending is restricted accordingly. As a result, a certain fraction of the piezoelectric crystalline lamellae was found to survive through the Curie transition. Thus, in addition to the suggestion of a one-step process as a new concept for understanding the Curie transition, the relationship between the lamellar stacking and transition of molecular packing is unveiled as well in this research.\n\n\"LOVE TO HATE\" pesticides: felicity or curse for the soil microbial community?

On the Yin Side of the interaction, pesticides could exert toxicity on soil microorganisms, while on the Yang side of interaction, pesticides could be used as energy source by a fraction of the soil microbial community. The LOVE TO HATE project is an IAPP Marie Curie project which aims to study these complex interactions of pesticides with soil microorganisms and provide novel tools which will be useful both for pesticide regulatory purposes and agricultural use. On the Yin side of the interactions, a new regulatory scheme for assessing the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides will be proposed based on the use of advanced standardized tools and a well-defined experimental tiered scheme. On the Yang side of the interactions, advanced molecular tools like amplicon sequencing and functional metagenomics will be applied to define microbes that are involved in the rapid transformation of pesticides in soils and isolate novel pesticide biocatalysts. In addition, a functional microarray has been designed to estimate the biodegradation genetic potential of the microbial community of agricultural soils for a range of pesticide groups.\n\nModObs: Atmospheric modelling for wind energy, climate and environment applications: exploring added value from new observation technique.

The overall goal is to bring young scientists to work ogether with experienced researchers in developing a better interaction amongst scientific communities of modelers and experimentalists, using a comprehensive approach to \"Climate Changeâ, \"Clean Energy assessmentâ and \"Environmental Policiesâ, issues. This poster describes the work in progress of ten students, funded by the network, under the supervision of a team of scientists within atmospheric physics, engineering and satellite remote sensing and end-users such as companies in the private sector, all with the appropriate expertise to integrate the most advanced research methods and techniques in the following topics. MODELING: GLOBAL-TO-MESO SCALE: Analytical and process oriented numerical models will be used to study the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean on a regional scale. Initial results indicate an interaction between the intensity of polar lows and the subsurface warm core often present in the Nordic Seas (11). The presence of waves, mainly swell, influence the MABL fluxes and turbulence structure. The regional and global wave effect on the atmosphere will be also studied and quantified (7) MESO-SCALE: Applicability of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parametrizations in the meso-scale WRF model to marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) over the North Sea is investigated. The most suitable existing PBL parametrization will be additionally improved and used for downscaling North Sea past and future climates (2).

M.; Zimbelman, J. R.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThermal inertia characteristics have been determined for the martian crater Curie from high resolution groundtracks of Viking Thermal Infrared Mapper (IRTM) data. Flow features near the southeastern edge of the ejecta indicate that at least part of the Curie ejecta was emplaced in a manner similar to the ejecta of rampart craters. Within the study region there appears to be a general southeastern trend towards lower thermal inertia values. This trend may be related to the proximity of the Arabia region, which is mainly to the south and east of Curie. Curie is in a region where the overall thermal inertias change over relatively short distances radial to Arabia. Therefore, the observed general decrease in thermal inertia may represent increasing regional dust accumulation in the direction of Arabia.\n\n75 FR 23589 - Safety Zones; Blasting Operations and Movement of Explosives, St. Marys River, Sault Sainte Marie...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-05-04\n\n...

Without chaos synchronization circumstance, it has performance improvement in bandwidth efficiency, transmission efficiency and anti-white-noise performance compared with traditional communication method. In this paper, the channel noise influence on chaotic modulation signals and the construction problem of anti-color-noise chaotic M-ary communication system are studied. The formula of zone partition demodulatorâs boundary in additive white Gaussian noise is derived, besides, the problem about how to determine the boundary of zone partition demodulator in additive color noise is deeply studied; Then an approach on constructingmoreÂ Â» anti-color-noise chaos M-ary communication system is proposed, in which a pre-distortion filter is added after the chaos baseband modulator in the transmitter and whitening filter is added before zone partition demodulator in the receiver. Finally, the chaos M-ary communication system based on Hamilton oscillator is constructed and simulated in different channel noise. The result shows that the proposed method in this paper can improve the anti-color-noise performance of the whole communication system compared with the former system, and it has better anti-fading and resisting disturbance performance than Quadrature Phase Shift Keying system.Â«Â less\n\nFrom Mary Virginia Gaver to the CLASS Research Summit: A Journey toward Causality and Student Success\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSoulen, Rita R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMary Virginia Gaver conducted the first correlational research in the field of school libraries.

Our first issue of Vistas focused on our current national user facilities (the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center [LANSCE], the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory-Pulsed Field Facility, and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies) and the vitality they bring to our Laboratory. These facilities are a magnet for students, postdoctoral researchers, and staff members from all over the world. This, in turn, allows us to continue to develop and maintain our strong staff across the relevant disciplines and conduct world-class discovery science. The second issue of Vistas was devoted entirely to the Laboratory's materials strategy - one of the three strategic science thrusts for the Laboratory. This strategy has helped focus our thinking for MaRIE. We believe there is a bright future in cutting-edge experimental materials research, and that a 21st-century facility with unique capability is necessary to fulfill this goal. The Laboratory has spent the last several years defining MaRIE, and this issue of Vistas presents our current vision of that facility. MaRIE will leverage LANSCE and our other user facilities, as well as our internal and external materials community for decades to come, giving Los Alamos a unique competitive advantage, advancing materials science for the Laboratory's missions and attracting and recruiting scientists of international stature. MaRIE will give the international materials research community a suite of tools capable of meeting a broad range of outstanding grand challenges.Â«Â less\n\nPREFACE: International Conference on Many Particle Spectroscopy of Atoms, Molecules, Clusters and Surfaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDowek, Danielle; Bennani, Azzedine; Lablanquie, Pascal; Maquet, Alfred\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe 2008 edition of the International Conference on Many Particle Spectroscopy of Atoms, Molecules, Clusters and Surfaces was held in Paris from 30 June to 2 July 2008. This biennial conference alternates with the International Symposium on (e,2e), Double Photoionization and Related Topics which is a satellite of the International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC) conference. Over 110 participants from 20 countries gathered to examine the latest developments in the field of radiation interactions with matter. These include electron-electron correlation effects in excitation and in single and multiple ionization of atoms, molecules, clusters and surfaces with various projectiles: electrons, photons and ions. The present proceedings gathers the contributions of invited speakers and is intended to provide a detailed state-of-the-art account of the various facets of the field. Special thanks are due to UniversitÃ© Paris Sud XI, CNRS, and the laboratories LCAM, LIXAM and LCPMR which provided financial support for the organization of the conference. We are also grateful to the contribution of the companies Varian and RoentDek Handels GmbH.

In our previous study the pressure coefficient of the Curie temperature and that of the superconducting transition temperature were shown based on the Hamiltonian derived by Linder et al. within the mean field approximation about the electron-electron interaction analytically. There have been no numerical results of the pressure coefficient of the Curie temperature derived from the microscopic model. In this study the numerical results are reported. These results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental data in UGe2.\n\nUsing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" as a Feminist Teaching Tool\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJule, Allyson\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper explores the use of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" as a teaching tool used with a group of final-year undergraduate students who gathered together last academic year (2007-8) to explore Women in Leadership, as part of a Communications course.

It has been known that the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet depends on spin wave excitation energies, and they are affected by DMI. Therefore, the ferromagnetic transition temperature of the ultrathin ferromagnetic layer must be sensitive on the DMI. We find that the Curie temperature depends on the DMI by using the double time Green's function method. Since the DMI is arisen by the inversion symmetry breaking structure, the DMI is always important in the inversion symmetry breaking ultrathin ferromagnetic layers.\n\nCalculation of the Curie temperature of Ni using first principles based Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEisenbach, Markus; Yin, Junqi; Li, Ying Wai; Nicholson, Don\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe combine constrained first principles density functional with a Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the Curie temperature of Ni. Mapping the magnetic interactions in Ni onto a Heisenberg like model to underestimates the Curie temperature. Using a model we show that the addition of the magnitude of the local magnetic moments can account for the difference in the calculated Curie temperature. For ab initio calculations, we have extended our Locally Selfconsistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS) code to constrain the magnitude of the local moments in addition to their direction and apply the Replica Exchange Wang-Landau method to sample the larger phase space efficiently to investigate Ni where the fluctuation in the magnitude of the local magnetic moments is of importance equal to their directional fluctuations. We will present our results for Ni where we compare calculations that consider only the moment directions and those including fluctuations of the magnetic moment magnitude on the Curie temperature.

We used Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility resources at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, supported by US DOE under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725.\n\nMary and femininity: A psychological critique.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarrington, P A\n\n1984-09-01\n\nThis essay uses Freud to interpret the symbolism and theology of Mary in modern Catholicism. In her role as the mother of believers, Mary functions to place the Christian in the position of a child who receives illusory gratification from the mother. In her role as model for Christians to emulate, Mary functions to place the Christian in the position of receptivity and dependence which Freud associated with femininity. Reinterpreting Freud from a feminist perspective, I suggest that the kind of femininity Mary represents serves to perpetuate patriachal social structures and to inhibit full psychological maturity.\n\n33 CFR 165.T09-0290 - Safety Zones; Blasting Operations and Movement of Explosives, St. Marys River, Sault Sainte Marie...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 33 Navigation and Navigable Waters 2 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Safety Zones; Blasting Operations and Movement of Explosives, St. Marys River, Sault Sainte Marie, MI. 165.T09-0290 Section 165.T09-0290...

The key motivation for MaRIE is to develop new experimental capabilities needed to fill the existing gaps in our fundamental understanding of materials important for key National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) goals. MaRIE will bring two major new capabilities: (a) the ability to characterize the meso- and microstructure of materials in bulk as well as local dynamic response characteristics, and (b) the ability to characterize how this microstructure evolves under NNSA-relevant conditions and impacts the materialâs performance in this regime.\n\nAntoni Quintana-Mari (1907-1998): A Pioneer of the Use of History of Science in Science Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRoca-Rosell, Antoni; Grapi-Vilumara, Pere\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn the early 1930s, the young Antoni Quintana-Mari undertook some research on Antoni de Marti i Franques, one of the most prominent Catalan scientists of the Enlightenment.

J. (Principal Investigator)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAn approach to estimating the Curie point isotherm uses the classical Gauss method inverting a system of nonlinear equations. The method, slightly modified by a differential correction technique, directly inverts filtered Magsat data to calculate the crustal structure above the Curie depth, which is modeled as a magnetized layer of varying thickness and susceptibility. Since the depth below the layer is assumed to be nonmagnetic, the bottom of the layer is interpreted as the Curie depth. The method, once fully developed, tested, and compared with previous work by others, is to be applied to a portion of the eastern U.S. when sufficient Magsat data are accumulated for the region.\n\n\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\": An Analysis of Satire as a Violation of Soap Opera Stereotypes.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGaulard, Joan M.\n\nThe soap opera \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" presents an interesting new genre in television, as it defies the conventional standards and stereotypes associated with daytime drama.

F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nArctic Ocean remains at the forefront of geological exploration. Here we investigate its deep geological structures and geodynamics on the basis of gravity, magnetic and bathymetric data. We estimate Curie-point depth and lithospheric effective elastic thickness to understand deep geothermal structures and Arctic lithospheric evolution. A fractal exponent of 3.0 for the 3D magnetization model is used in the Curie-point depth inversion. The result shows that Curie-point depths are between 5 and 50 km. Curie depths are mostly small near the active mid-ocean ridges, corresponding well to high heat flow and active shallow volcanism. Large curie depths are distributed mainly at continental marginal seas around the Arctic Ocean. We present a map of effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithosphere using a multitaper coherence technique, and Te are between 5 and 110 km. Te primarily depends on geothermal gradient and composition, as well as structures in the lithosphere. We find that Te and Curie-point depths are often correlated. Large Te are distributed mainly at continental region and small Te are distributed at oceanic region. The Alpha-Mendeleyev Ridge (AMR) and The Svalbard Archipelago (SA) are symmetrical with the mid-ocean ridge. AMR and SA were formed before an early stage of Eurasian basin spreading, and they are considered as conjugate large igneous provinces, which show small Te and Curie-point depths. Novaya Zemlya region has large Curie-point depths and small Te. We consider that fault and fracture near the Novaya Zemlya orogenic belt cause small Te. A series of transform faults connect Arctic mid-ocean ridge with North Atlantic mid-ocean ridge. We can see large Te near transform faults, but small Curie-point depths. We consider that although temperature near transform faults is high, but mechanically the lithosphere near transform faults are strengthened.\n\nWomen and the Elements: The Role of Women in Element and Fission Discoveries.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSpradley, Joseph L.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nDescribes the scientific work of several women, including Marie Curie, Lise Meitner, Ida Noddack, Irene Curie, Marguerite Perey, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Maria Mayer.

ERNs mobilise scientific, academic and research organisations with the aim of giving the public the opportunity to meet researchers in an informal setting. The overall objective of ERNs is to achieve better awareness among the general public concerning the importance of science in everyday life and to combat stereotypes about researchers. The longer-term strategic objective of ERNs is to encourage young people to embark on a scientific career. Volcanoes' Night I-II-III has been an ERN project series funded by the EC FP7 and H2020 programmes between 2012-2015 (EC contract No. 316558, 610050, 633310, www.nochedevolcanes.es). The concept of Volcanoes' Night was created by researchers from the Canary Islands, Spain, where both the researchers and the public live in the close vicinity of volcanoes. The objective of the project was to use volcanoes as a background against which the role of geoscientists could be explained to the public. The scope of Volcanoes' Night was exclusively dedicated to geoscience, and in this respect it stands out among all other ERN projects, which are always more general in scope. During its four years of EC funding, the geographical coverage of Volcanoes' Night expanded substantially from a single location in 2012 (Fuencaliente de La Palma, Spain) to a dozen locations in 2015, mobilising multiple scientific organisations, researchers, and public authorities for engagement with the public. The last EC-funded project, Volcanoes' Night III, which was organised in 2014 and 2015, engaged approximately 21,000 visitors through its outreach activities, which included experiments, science cafÃ©s, volcano movies, My Day presentations, excursions, science workshops and more. The impact of the project was carefully assessed via surveys and social studies during its lifetime, and an Impact\n\nRoadmap to MaRIE March 2015\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarnes, Cris William\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratoryâs proposed MaRIE facility is slated to introduce the worldâs highest energy hard x-ray free electron laser (XFEL). As the light source for the Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes experimental facility (MaRIE), the 42-keV XFEL, with bursts of x-ray pulses at gigahertz repetition for studying fast dynamical processes, will help accelerate discovery and design of the advanced materials needed to meet 21st-century national security and energy security challenges. Yet the science of free-electron lasers has a long and distinguished history at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where for nearly four decades Los Alamos scientists have been performing research,moreÂ Â» design, development, and collaboration work in FEL science. The work at Los Alamos has evolved from low-gain amplifier and oscillator FEL development to highbrightness photoinjector development, and later, self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) and high-gain amplifier FEL development.Â«Â less\n\nCalculation of exchange integrals and Curie temperature for La-substituted barium hexaferrites.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Chuanjian; Yu, Zhong; Sun, Ke; Nie, Jinlan; Guo, Rongdi; Liu, Hai; Jiang, Xiaona; Lan, Zhongwen\n\n2016-10-31\n\nAs the macro behavior of the strength of exchange interaction, state of the art of Curie temperature T c , which is directly proportional to the exchange integrals, makes sense to the high-frequency and high-reliability microwave devices. Challenge remains as finding a quantitative way to reveal the relationship between the Curie temperature and the exchange integrals for doped barium hexaferrites. Here in this report, for La-substituted barium hexaferrites, the electronic structure has been determined by the density functional theory (DFT) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). By means of the comparison between the ground and relative state, thirteen exchange integrals have been calculated as a function of the effective value U eff . Furthermore, based on the Heisenberg model, the molecular field approximation (MFA) and random phase approximation (RPA), which provide an upper and lower bound of the Curie temperature T c , have been adopted to deduce the Curie temperature T c . In addition, the Curie temperature T c derived from the MFA are coincided well with the experimental data. Finally, the strength of superexchange interaction mainly depends on 2b-4f 1 , 4f 2 -12k, 2a-4f 1 , and 4f 1 -12k interactions.\n\nCOMMENTS ON THE DEFINITION OF THE CURIE, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO NATURAL RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJaeger, R.G.; Houtermans, H.\n\n1962-06-01\n\nAn analysis of maximum permissible levels of radionuclides showed that the definition of the curie, when applied to natural radioactive materials, is ambiguous. The history of the definition of the curie is reviewed. In the past, no clear distinction was raade between the curie as a unit of the quantity of a radioactive substance, and the curie as a unit of radioactivity. This has caused different interpretation of the curic as applied to natural radioactive materials, e.g., natural uranium and natural thorium. A redefinition of the curie as a pure unit of radioactivity is suggested, and maximum permissible levels ormoreÂ Â» concentrations of natural radioactive materials, such as uranium or thorium, should be stated in mass per unit mass or volume of air, water, food, etc. It is recommended that, in legislation listing the amounts of naturally occurring radioactive substances, these amounts be stated in milligrams or Kilograms.

MaRIE's theory, modeling, and computation (TMC) roadmap efforts have paralleled 'MaRIE First Experiments' science activities in the areas of materials dynamics, irradiated materials and complex functional materials in extreme conditions. The documents that follow this executive summary describe in detail for each of these areas the current state of the art, the gaps that exist and the road mapmoreÂ Â» to MaRIE and beyond. Here we integrate the various elements to articulate an overarching theme related to the role and consequences of heterogeneities which manifest as competing states in a complex energy landscape. MaRIE experiments will locate, measure and follow the dynamical evolution of these heterogeneities. Our TMC vision spans the various pillar science and highlights the key theoretical and experimental challenges. We also present a theory, modeling and computation roadmap of the path to and beyond MaRIE in each of the science areas.Â«Â less\n\nMaRIE Undulator & XFEL Systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNguyen, Dinh Cong; Marksteiner, Quinn R.; Anisimov, Petr Mikhaylovich\n\nThe 22 slides in this presentation treat the subject under the following headings: MaRIE XFEL Performance Parameters, Input Electron Beam Parameters, Undulator Design, Genesis Simulations, Risks, and Summary It is concluded that time-dependent Genesis simulations show the MaRIE XFEL can deliver the number of photons within the required bandwidth, provided a number of assumptions are met; the highest risks are associated with the electron beam driving the XFEL undulator; and risks associated with the undulator and/or distributed seeding technique may be evaluated or retired by performing early validation experiments.\n\nRelationship between Curie isotherm surface and Moho discontinuity in the Arabian shield, Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAboud, Essam; Alotaibi, Abdulrahman M.; Saud, Ramzi\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe Arabian shield is a Precambrian complex of igneous and metamorphic rocks located approximately one-third of the way across the western Arabian Peninsula, with uncommon exposures along the Red Sea coast. We used aeromagnetic data acquired by others over the past several decades to estimate the depth to the Curie temperature isotherm throughout this region. Our goal was to further understand the lithospheric structure, thermal activity, and seismicity to assist in geothermal exploration. We also compared the Curie temperature isotherm with the crustal thickness to investigate the possibility that mantle rocks are magnetic in some parts of the Arabian shield. Depths to the Curie isotherm were estimated by dividing the regional aeromagnetic grid into 26 overlapping windows. Each window was then used to estimate the shape of the power spectrum. The windows had dimensions of 250 Ã 250 km to allow investigation of depths as deep as 50 km. The results show the presence of a Curie isotherm at a depth of 10-20 km near the Red Sea, increasing to 35-45 km in the interior of the Arabian shield. The Curie isotherm generally lies above the Moho in this region but deepens into the mantle in some locations, notably beneath the Asir Terrane.\n\nTheresa Marie Schiavo's Long Road to Peace\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCerminara, Kathy L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe death of Theresa Marie Schiavo came about only after almost 7 years of argument among her family members.

More recently, its magnetic properties and also nuclear magnetic relaxation rates have been studied computationally. We have calculated electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR parameters using quantum-mechanical (QM) computation of molecular dynamics snapshots, obtained using a polarizable empirical force field. Statistical averages of hyperfine coupling, g- and zero-field splitting tensors, as well as the pNMR shielding terms, are compared to the available experimental and computational data. In accordance with our previous work, the isotropic hyperfine coupling as well as nuclear shielding values agree well with experimental measurements for the (17)O nuclei of water molecules in the first solvation shell of the nickel ion, whereas larger deviations are found for (1)H centers. We report, for the first time, the Curie-type contribution to the pNMR relaxation rate using QM calculations together with Redfield relaxation theory. The Curie relaxation mechanism is analogous to chemical shift anisotropy relaxation, well-known in diamagnetic NMR. Due to the predominance of other types of paramagnetic relaxation mechanisms for this system, it is possible to extract the Curie term only computationally. The Curie mechanism alone would result in around 16 and 20 s(-1) of relaxation rates (R1 and R2 respectively) for the (1)H nuclei of water molecules bonded to the Ni(2+) center, in a magnetic field of 11.7 T. The corresponding (17)O relaxation rates are around 33 and 38 s(-1).

Davenport and William B. Jensen, high school and college teachers of introductory chemistry requested a source of pictorial material about famous chemical scientists suitable as a classroom aid. CHF responded by publishing this attractive, inexpensive paperback volume, which reflects the considerable research effort needed to locate appropriate images and to write the biographical essays. Printed on heavy, glossy paper and spiral bound to facilitate conversion to overhead transparencies, it contains 157 images from pictorial collections at CHF and many other institutions on two types of achievers: the historical \"greats\" most often referred to in introductory courses, and scientists who made contributions in areas of the chemical sciences that are of special relevance to modern life and the career choices students will make. The pictures are intended to provide the \"human face\" of the book's subtitle- \"to point to the human beings who had the insights and made the major advances that [teachers] ask students to master.\" Thus, for example, Boyle's law becomes less cold and abstract if the student can connect it with the two portraits of the Irish scientist even if his face is topped with a wig. Marie Curie can be seen in the role of wife and mother as well as genius scientist in the photographs of her with her two daughters, one of whom also became a Nobel laureate. And students are reminded of the ubiquity of the contribution of the chemical scientists to all aspects of our everyday life by the stories and pictures of Wallace Hume Carothers' path to nylon, Percy Lavon Julian's work on hormones, and Charles F.

Therefore, double-layer materials were made with a conventional 2-micron bubble storage layer capped by an ion-implantable drive layer of high Curie temperature, high magnetostriction material. Contiguous disk test patterns were implanted with varying doses of a typical triple implant. Quality of propagation was judged by quasistatic tests on 8-micron period major and minor loops. Variations of magnetization, uniaxial anisotropy, implant dose, and magnetostriction were investigated to ensure optimum flux matching, good charged wall coupling, and wide operating margins. The most successful drive layer compositions were in the systems (SmDyLuCa)3(FeSi)5O12 and (BiGdTmCa)3(FeSi)5O12 and had Curie temperatures 25-44 C higher than the storage layers.\n\nQuality of life in children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurns, Joshua; Ryan, Monique M; Ouvrier, Robert A\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe authors studied the health-related quality of life of children aged 5 to 18 years with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease of varying types and severity and compared it with the general pediatric population. To capture and compare the quality-of-life data across a broad range of ages, the Child Health Questionnaire was completed by parents of 127 children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Affected children exhibited lower physical, psychological, and social well-being than the general pediatric population, with subsequent worsening of many domains with age. The type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease influenced some physical and behavioral quality-of-life domains, while gender, body size, and ethnicity did not. Parent characteristics had generally little impact on the reporting of their child's quality of life, although parents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease reported higher bodily pain in their children than those without. Overall, quality of life is negatively affected by the presence and severity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in childhood.\n\n[Integrated approach to the promotion of young academics in vision research at a European level].\n\nPubMed\n\nWheeler-Schilling, T H; Zrenner, E; Schiefer, U\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe European Commission predicts a dramatic dearth of researchers and doctors in the near future. At the same time, highly qualified and motivated human resources form the only guarantee for further development of scientific knowledge for research and clinical application. This situation calls for an integrated approach to the promotion of young academics in vision research at a European level. The Marie Curie Program of the European Union is an ideal tool, which can be used particularly eff"
