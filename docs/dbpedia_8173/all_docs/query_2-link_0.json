        "text": "THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A WAITING SPACE. JUNE 2022.\n\nThere are times when I think I will never write again. Or read again. Or be able to focus again. These times can last for months... even if I have to write or read or focus in those times. I try to write, and the words are flat and empty and fall out sloppily on a computer screen. I try to read, and after five minutes in, I cannot recall a word I've read. I try to focus, and I have five narratives in my head all at once. I've lost the inspiration, the precision, the what's the word? So, I sit and wait... and work and wait... and plan and wait... and live and wait for that moment when I want to write something and the keys fly like a heartbeat- working without thinking... for that moment when I can absorb books in a matter of hours and remember the poignant details of syntactic glory or semantic depth... for that moment when my mind is clear and my thoughts are crisp like fall mornings and I can focus without even noticing the singularity of the moment.\n\nI wait a lot.\n\nBut, I learn the spaces like I learn the winding backroads of Southern Indiana. I know a space like I know that 200-year-old tree at mile marker 39.5 or that river house that you can only see in the winter or that yard that has perfectly cut grass. I think that if you would want to know a lot about a person- you would want to ask about the space where they work- the desk, the bookshelf, the space. Because, those amalgams of interests are stored in such space. So, I cropped up the archived photographs of spaces gone by. From my college desks to my teacher desks to my home office spaces- and a few of my sister's photographs. Each one tells a story of a person from that moment. The space of waiting. The collage of a space.\n\n​\n\nMy first dorm desk just captured pieces of home- The Oxford Book of American Poetry, The NIV Bible, a framed picture of a Japanese anemone, photo boxes, journals, a bonsai tree, a jewelry book without any jewelry, the Target owl that I bought with one of my early paychecks, the jar of Black Warrior pencils, a Dasani water bottle, Beatles prints, my favorite lamp, and the alarm clock that played the radio in place of an alarm... the kind of alarm clock we used before cell phones. My second dorm desk reflects the trenches of schoolwork- an article titled 'Culture in Common' and a textbook about legal precedents in public education. There's a lamp that my dad had when he was in the dorms at IU. There's a scarf that I wore to shreds and a ZIG writer (the year I switched to only writing in pen). My last semester desk was a bit more evolved.\n\nThe first teacher desk had the book purgatory and the black cat poster. The next year, my bookshelves started to grow and evolve along with a revolving display of flowers. In London, I made an origami crane each time that I was homesick.\n\nMusic filled my first apartment space whenever I was working. It was a space of every craft that I could think of- painting, sketching, charcoal drawings, silicone pours, double exposure photographs, macrame, crochet, scrapbooks, letter writing, collages, etc. My second teacher desk was a space of makeshift glory. I had that sorority girl tapestry, the dream catcher, the collages and every office supply you can think up.\n\nThese were my spaces- the waiting rooms. Yet, each placeholder tells a little story- like poetry collections, personal libraries, and the flowers that you pick.\n\nSome questions:\n\n(1) Do you keep a case on your phone?\n\n(2) Which record do you play on repeat?\n\n(3) Which ten books will you keep forever?\n\n(4) Which is more important to you- the creator or the creation?\n\n(5) What's your favorite writing utensil?\n\n(6) How often do you write?\n\n(7) Which verses do you know from memory?\n\n(8) Name three things that make you think of home.\n\n(9) What's your favorite type of tree?\n\n(10) What's wrong with waiting?\n\nSUCH A LAUGH. MARCH 2022.\n\nMy family bonds through making fun of one another. You get us together in one room and three things are going to happen: (1) there will be spontaneous intervals of singing and dancing, (2) there will be accents, and (3) there will be inside jokes thrown around like a ping-pong match. Family bonding is a storytelling roast- one in which we re-live the past and make fun of each other throughout the entire narration.\n\nI remember being home from college one summer and my sister brought home one of her high school boyfriends for the first time. I was enrolled in two psychology courses that summer- behavioral neuroscience and cognitive psychology. So, I decided to have a little fun of my own- a little social experiment. When he came over and introduced himself to the family, I told him that we were a \"musical family\" and shot Sarah a glance like 'I'm about to see if he'll pass the test.' He was a tall, lanky, introverted kid, clearly uncomfortable and afraid of making the wrong first impression. So, I went over to the desk in the great room and turned on \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\" so that it poured out of the speakers into the great room. And, I started singing, because I knew my parents would join in if I got it started. They joined in, and then, I turned to the new kid and without skipping a beat, he joined in on the song. He passed the test. That's how we test people- how far are you willing to make a fool of yourself and then laugh at yourself.\n\nSarah and I have the same sense of humor. It's the thing that ties us together despite our differences. But, Sarah developed the nuances of stand up early on. She started studying jokes as a kid. She loved The Three Stooges when she was five and six years old. Then, my grandfather bought her a joke book. She would read her favorite jokes to him any time he called or came to visit. Then, every year on April Fool's Day, Sarah tried her best to pull practical jokes on my dad. In late elementary school, she decided she wanted to be a magician and would make the family sit through her magic shows. In middle school, she used acting as a medium for executing a joke. In high school, we had a DVD set of F-R-I-E-N-D-S that we watched on repeat. That really shaped our humor. We also grew up liking the classics- The Princess Bride, Second Hand Lions, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and other cameos of humor. Sarah was always studying how to exact a laugh. If you scroll through her FB, it is just an archived collection of jokes. In 2017, she told me that I needed to watch a stand up routine by Nate Bargatze. I liked some comedy routines- I liked Demetri Martin, Anjelah Johnson, Bill Cosby (I know, I know- but I did like his comedy), Dean Martin & Foster Brooks, and a little Kevin Hart (mainly just the ostrich bit). However, I hated anything political, anything with excessive and explicit language, and anything crude. So, in the world of stand up, that eliminates a lot. But, Sarah explained that I would like this guy because he did clean comedy. And, he immediately became my favorite comedian. In an interview Nate's dad explained, \"He's not a joke teller, he's a storyteller.\" I think that's why I love his work. His routines feel like I am sitting at a family gathering listening to someone tell stories and making everyone laugh--- his comedy feels like home.\n\nWhenever I'm having a particularly bad day, I always listen to Yelled at by a Clown. On our sister road trips, we always listen to Nate. Sarah and I went to Tennessee to see him perform in 2019- which was awful bc I was recovering from bronchitis and every time I laughed, I had to suppress a coughing attack, but also great because it was Nate. We decided that if we ever had a brother, it would be him. I think good comedy is the kind that feels like home. And, I think the art of being able to laugh at yourself is far too often undervalued.\n\nDARLING, BE HUMAN. NOVEMBER 2021.\n\nThis is not responsible journalism. It is personal and complex and contemporary. It's biased. I’ll start with an anecdote as a pathetic appeal. Because, if I utilize conjunctions at the start of the sentence and maybe even break the fourth wall, I might seem approachable. In the twenty-first century classroom, the first rule is ‘darling, be human.’ Chemistry is culture. Character compliments content.\n\nI’m in my late twenties, but I will ardently say that I am seventeen when a student tries to ask me my age. And, they will ask, because I am wearing clothes that dance along the lines of millennial and Gen Z fashion... and I'm five foot nothing... and I just don't care enough to wear make-up to make myself look older. I’ve learned to wear what makes me comfortable… because pencil skirts and heels were rather dreadful… and unfortunately, sweat pants, as professional wear, have not hit the mainstream. I can’t help but think that one day, my future students will laugh at the fact that shoulders with bra straps in 2021 were seen as sexually suggestive, much in the same way that they sarcastically discuss how ankles were once entirely scandalous.\n\nI’m not a first-year teacher anymore… or a third year teacher… or a fifth year teacher. I am more confident in my ability to turn off my alarm three times (pushing it to the last minute that I HAVE to wake up) and still pull off an immaculate lesson plan that I whip up twenty minutes before first period. Yes, experience does have perks.\n\nMy classroom management style is more relaxed than it was in my first few years of teaching. I still won’t hesitate to write up a student… but, there is less tension when I write up students these days. It isn’t so much a power flex as it is a reminder that ‘hey, man, you crossed a line… let us re-establish it and move forward.’ I’ve learned to speak sophomore, which is a complex language system of snark, sarcasm, TikTok slang, and depression (both in tone and in content). Wit is pertinent.\n\nI am honest. And, darling, I'm SO human (despite the vampire theories circulating these days). I will tell students that I don’t always love my job. There are days when I don’t have my life together. There are days when I am human, and I say things I shouldn’t say. And, I apologize. But, I will also tell my students that I love teaching. There are days when I have all my ducks in a neat, little row. There are days when I am human, and I say exactly what someone needs to hear at exactly the right time that they need to hear it. And, I am grateful.\n\nI think most people, maybe even especially in the small towns of the U.S.A., notice this discrepancy between youth culture and ‘everybody else’ culture. However, here is the not-so-secret secret: most people learn to accept life as it comes to them and shift ambitions accordingly… It is all the same culture. We are all at the mercy of navigating through a personal narrative that is independent from the collective narrative but graded using common core standards. The other not-so-secret secret: you’re not going to remember or even care about the grade in the end. You’ll remember what you learned while you wrote it… and while you lived it. Confidence comes and goes. Creation is catharsis.\n\n​\n\nI love my content. I will spend hours working on lesson plans. Curriculum mapping is one of my favorite pass-times. If you ask me about culturally responsive pedagogy, I will straight up talk your ear off.... AND, I’ve sworn off coffee for the last seven years, because I didn’t want to get hooked on it. But, alas, the mocha coffee blend protein smoothies will be the death of my caffeine abstinence.\n\n​I feel I will be forever humbled by the realization that I am never enough. This is not self-doubt in the traditional sense. I’d like to say, generally, that confidence grows with age… that one cares less about what others think with age… that one develops a strong sense of self with age… But, much more realistically, confidence is a side effect of the moment. And, the moment is a rhetorical situation, bustling with an amalgam of factors, some beyond my immediate control.\n\n​\n\nI am always quite terrified by the aspect of writing for others. Perhaps this is because writing is the closest mirror to who I am behind the facades that I’ve learned to carefully build and construct in society, in my acquaintanceships, and in my profession. This is not lying. It is architecture. These walls are survivalist. In a world, where I might always offend someone, I’ve learned to be a chameleon. So, it is always a bit of a shock, when after a day of the normalized walking on eggshells, someone asks me to voice an opinion… and not just any opinion- my opinion... and for today (as with most days), my opinion is that darling, we're all human. Don't overthink it.\n\nSTARDUST. NOVEMBER 2021.\n\n“Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” -Mary Oliver\n\nCollege is for those late night conversations… for those nights when you drag everyone outside to lay down on the empty basketball court by the dorm and watch shooting stars… for late night runs to the grocery store for raw cookie dough… for sharing stories and making friends and staying up until four in the morning. Marta Kauffman explained that F-R-I-E-N-D-S was born from the idea of creating a show that chronicled “that point in your life when friends become your family.” For me, it wasn’t New York City. It was Bloomington. It wasn’t a big city. It was a college town. Each memory made a star. Each basketball game made a constellation. Each grocery store run make a galaxy. Each conversation made its own universe. And, as quickly as it came, it was over like some cosmic blink of an eye. But, that’s the way of it, isn’t it? The meteor shower only lasts a night or two. The basketball season comes to an end. It’s closing time at the grocery store. And, at some point, when your phone shows you it’s four AM, you have to call it a night. It’s the temporality of the alternate universe that makes college memorable. It’s the finite nature of the golden years that makes up the weight of that one wild and precious life. It’s only the memory keepers that project the night sky and share the stories of all those constellations.\n\nThe Empty Basketball Court in Early December.\n\nThe Geminid Meteor Shower.\n\nI remember the first night of stars more because that was the first time that I felt the temporality of college. I put on two pairs of pants- leggings and sweatpants. I put on two pairs of socks. I was wearing at least four layers of shirts under my winter coat. I pulled on my gloves. I pulled on the Target-brand, knock-off Ugg boots. I was ready for star-gazing. I shuffled with the three others to the basketball court. It was dark. The lights were turned off. I could feel the court beneath me- cold and gritty- as I looked up into the night sky and watched for shooting stars. And, in my mind, all I heard was the recording of Professor Frank Close on the Alan Parsons song, “Temporalia.” “When we are looking across space, we are looking back in time.” In that moment, I felt my greatness and my fallibility in the same moment. I felt that I was going to accomplish great things- that we all were… but somewhere in the lapse of time, it would all be over… and who then would tell our stories? I didn’t find the answer in the twins of St. Elmo’s Fire. So, I watched my breath hit the air like smoke and vanish into the crisp, cold night.\n\nThe C-Store for Raw Cookie Dough. Then, Back to the Dorm.\n\nAny Given Weeknight.\n\nI never cared about the freshmen fifteen. Hand over the cookie dough. The two that we were all trying to couple up were playing a board game. I’ve never liked board games. So, I sat on the outer circle and watched everyone else play. I asked a lot of questions and in-between the laughter and the strategies and the smell of the old carpet and popcorn, someone told me their story. And, I listened to the pain in words… not knowing what words to return. But, then, there was an understanding- an unspoken thing that existed without words. I didn’t find answers in the board game. So, I watched the glow of people under old, candescent linear lightbulbs. Twin flames reflected in the window as Bloomington stayed awake into the early morning.\n\nThe Grocery Store Runs.\n\nThe Second & Last Year.\n\nWhen we look at the night sky, why do we only point out the constellations? What about the millions of other stars that exist there, in the background? I want to take those stars and store them in glass jars like lightning bugs to remind me of the little bits of summer nights that keep me warm in the heart of winter. Let’s drive to the grocery store with all the windows down and the bass threatening to blow out the speakers. Let’s go walk down the aisles and fill up the cart with food that we’ll make together. Then, let’s go back to some small, college rental apartment with the 90s fixtures and kitchens with dishes in the sinks. Someone play some music that I haven’t heard before. We’ll dance in the kitchen and make cheap food and pretend that the greatest years of our lives are in the future as we watch TV and talk about string theory and tell our stories. Because in those star moments, we don’t realize that we are living the story that we’ll tell later. Kindred spirits brought together for just a brief moment in time. It’s a beautiful idea. String theory.\n\nMemory keepers store up stardust in the cellars of our past. We keep that dust from the stars that mapped the constellations that built the galaxies that made the universe. Blink. Cosmic. And, yes, sometimes in those dark drives to work in the mornings, I will imagine the night that I went star-gazing. Sometimes for a brief moment when someone tells me about their loss, I will think back to the board game. Sometimes when I am driving with all the windows down, I will hear a song that brings back a drive to the grocery store. Yes, these are memories that I will project onto the ceiling. These early stardust memories that no one else shares except for us.\n\nST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL & MRS. A. SEPTEMBER 2021.\n\nI am one of those storytellers. You know the type- the one that tells you fifteen different back stories so that you can understand the current story... and, well, sometimes, the current story gets lost in the cat's cradle of back stories. But, that's not the point. It's just that everything seems so overwhelmingly connected that I cannot avoid showing you how each puzzle piece comes together for the narrative.\n\nBackstory: In high school, I was not a big reader. I need to preface with that because you need to understand that despite becoming an English teacher, I didn't \"love\" libraries and I was NOT a voracious reader at that point. But, during my junior year, my best friend (who skipped lunch every day because she thought she was fat) and I (who skipped lunch because the thought of having to spend an additional 30 minutes with tons of my loquacious peers seemed way worse than skipping a meal) would sit in the library. Sometimes we'd talk. Sometimes we worked on homework. Sometimes we studied using the flashcards that I made for every. single. test. Sometimes she would be absorbed in the world of her phone, and I would sit absorbed in a book of poems or theories in my textbook for astronomy. My best friend knew the librarian well. Her grandmother and the librarian were pretty good friends. So, I kind of knew the librarian, because I stood there (probably awkwardly) when my best friend would chat it up with Mrs. A (the librarian).\n\nBackstory: When we graduated from high school, Mrs. A took us out for lunch the summer before we went away for college. We talked all about our college game plans. My best friend was going to university out of state, and I was going to IU. We had both grown up in the same small town and we were both about to start our own stories. Mrs. A paid for lunch and wished us the very best.\n\nBackstory: Three years later, after I finished my undergrad degree, and had secured my first official teaching job, I was in a staff meeting - still so full of life and still so nervous- as most first-year teachers are. I was scanning the room- looking at all the people. It was a big school. In the English department, there were twenty of us.... so the entire staff was like the size of Hauser. Across the room, I saw Mrs. A. I knew at least one person. I was saved from having to be that awkward wallflower in a sea of people that I didn't know. I quickly went over and re-introduced myself. From that day on, Mrs. A became one of my people. The first and second year of teaching can be brutal and overwhelming. However, during my prep period, I would retreat to the library and sit there with Mrs. A, while she listened to me vent about everything. In turn, she told me about her teaching years- about how she started teaching before schools integrated and about the climate of schools during integration and about the race riots. She told me about all of her travels- about Paris, Prague, and so many other places. She helped me lesson plan and teach research. She helped me structure independent reading. She was one of my strongest supporters through some of the most trying times in my teaching career.\n\nBackstory: After two years of teaching, I really thought I was not meant to be a teacher. So, I applied to a few graduate programs to further study literature. I didn't think I would get into any programs, but I applied anyway. I was accepted into two programs- a local one and an overseas one. I went to Mrs. A for advice. I didn't know what to do. I loved the idea of studying abroad, but I was afraid of the financial burdens that would follow an experience like that. Mrs. A told me that I needed to go- that there isn't a price tag that you can put on the experience that comes from living in Europe during your twenties- that there isn't a way to fully understand other cultures without experiencing them. My M.A. program was in London. She told me all about her London travels. She told me about how she climbed all the way up the 528 steps in St. Paul's Cathedral to look over London.\n\nBackstory: So, near the end of my year in London, I spontaneously decided to do it. I was going to climb up the 528 stair steps in SPC to overlook the city... Only problem: I was wearing a maxi skirt and sandals without backs. I did it anyway. And, when I was looking across London, I thought about how amazing it was that in my junior year of high school, I met an amazing person, who would one day led me right to that place, who would make me a better educator, who would inspire me to take great leaps of faith, who would teach me how to help students fall in love with books, research, and understanding the value of experience.\n\nCurrent story: When I heard someone mention her name the other day, I knew I needed to write her a thank you. While words may never suffice, I am eternally grateful for her example. And, whenever I hear anything about St. Paul's Cathedral, I think about Mrs. A.\n\nTHE COMPROMISE AESTHETIC. AUGUST 2021.\n\nI hate being sick. But, the plus side (of being sick) is that it gives a socially reasonable excuse to slow down, to pause. And, it is a real pain when you hit the unpause button and get slammed with everything that you put off for a couple of days. Nevertheless, the ability to switch work mode on and off is a skill set that I've wanted to master for years. So, here's to practice. Cheers.\n\nThe last time that I spent four years in one educational establishment was high school (and before high school, it was like playing hot potato between schools- Lutheran school, Catholic school, public school one, public school two). So, entering my fourth year at Hauser is somewhat strange... comforting in its familiarity and unsettling because of its familiarity at the same exact time. Post-college, my twenties have been a rap sheet of rolling stone experiences. This is the longest I've stayed in one place. The further I trek into secondary teaching, the more and more I feel like an outlier. I think this is because I fell into the trap of specialization. I was thinking the other day... as I do many days... about the design flaws of twenty-first century educational paradigms. I was thinking about bureaucratic models, policy shifts since \"A Nation at Risk,\" and the extreme differences between primary education, middle school education, and high school education... as one does. I remember thinking (when I was finishing my first degree) that I would have enough experience to understand secondary teaching after two years in the field... Seven years later, I think education systems change far too quickly for anyone to ever be completely confident in one's ability to fully understand the intricacies of secondary teaching. I think experience is the best teacher--- and that takes time.\n\nI was reading a literary piece (by Rachel Greenwald Smith) on the compromise aesthetic in DFW's Infinite Jest. Since my educational training rests in contemporary literature and educational policy, the common ground and trending buzzword is always 'neoliberalism.' In the piece, Smith explores the chronological development of contemporary (code: post-45) literature. She remarks, \"The experimentalists of the 1960s and 70s: [were] Language poets and postmodernists. These writers saw aesthetic difficulty and novelty as the hallmark of literary excellence and, in the case of Language poets, as modes of political refusal\" (Smith 2021). Therefore, within the Western cultural revolution culture of the 60s and 70s, literature produced two standards: (1) aesthetic difficulty and (2) novelty. I would argue that the former confirmed the latter. The inclusion of some level of aesthetic difficulty (by dissent or divergence from the status quo) hallmarked novelty. However, Smith recognizes that, \"On the other hand, there were the traditionalists, the conservative New Formalists, the Garrison Keillor populists, and the proponents of MFA programs, which were perceived to be grooming grounds for traditional, anti-experimental, marketable products\" (2021). This divide between the \"MFA programs\" (cue: institutionalized education) with their \"marketable products\" (cue: neoliberal policy influence) created a direct contrast to what was happening in the literary world. This literary (and educational) rift set the foundation for the changes that followed in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. As Stephanie Burt asserts, by the 90s, \"Writers 'sought something new: something more open to personal emotion, to story and feeling, than Language poetry, but more complicated intellectually than most of the creative-writing programs' poets allowed... Compromise was born as a solution to polarization\" (qtd. in Smith 2021). So, the resulting space was an ecotone of aesthetic difficulty, novelty, storytelling, personalization, traditionalism, and New Formalism all channeled to make literary productions that were marketable in a free market economy.\n\nWHY IS THIS RELEVANT? Because, that discussion is the parallel discussion to the evolution of secondary education practices and pedagogy. Why do I feel like an outlier in secondary education? Because I specialized in contemporary literature AND in education (which is a marriage of aesthetic compromise). On the literary side, I want to teach and study the nuances of aesthetic difficulty, the conceptualizations of \"novel\" approaches to writing, and the works of contemporary tales fused with intellectual musings, emotion-gripping rhetoric, and the by-products of Language poets from the 60s, postmodernists from the 70s and 80s, and contemporary writers from the 90s to present day. BUT, on the educational side, the academic state standards are the direct product of the New Formalism/New Criticism school of thought (which, if it doesn't erase, blurs the contextual knowledge surrounding a piece of literature)... which, in turn, manifests in standardized tests. The assessments that I have to utilize to \"measure\" the \"products\" of my \"workers\"... sorry, \"students,\" is the structural basis of the \"grooming grounds\" for \"traditional, anti-experimental, marketable products\" a.k.a. standardized test scores, school letter grades, school ranking, teacher evaluations, funding, and salaries. And, I understand that the establishment of school accountability measures commenced with intentions to close the academic gap, to better educational systems, and to \"rise up.\" I know that schools are inherently ecotones themselves of content areas and policies... of social justice and of business management. This is why I may never be completely confident in my level of experience... because while 10,000 hours makes someone an expert, how can one be an expert if the aesthetic compromise is always in play- always changing- always structured between two conflicting realms that always make the person in the middle feel like an outlier?\n\nI'll post another entry about how I use both backgrounds to appeal to culturally responsive teaching that both explores alternative views of literary pedagogy but also meets that standards and precedents set by neoliberal policies. But, for now, I am going to snuggle up with a box of tissues and an umpteenth viewing of a Friends episode... and eventually finish marking those last few essays.\n\nOVID, LEO, & THE ASTRONOMY FESTIVAL. 13 JUNE 2021.\n\nThat moment when Ovid (slowly, without you realizing it) becomes your main literary man.\n\nSo this one is for Ovid, Edwin Hubble, my dad, and Mr. Jackson.\n\n​\n\nLet me explain: Every June, Bryce Canyon National Park puts on an Astronomy Festival (Astrofest). Covid precautions kind of threw a wrench in the plan last year. However, this year, the festival picked up where it left off. While waiting in line to reserve a spot in one of the constellation tours (because social distancing with the park is still a precaution), I heard the couple in front of me talking about their connection with the Astronomy Festival. After the solar eclipse in 2017, this guy developed a new-found interest in telescopes and viewing the night sky. He found other people, who were also into telescopes. So, for three years, all of these people (most likely brought together by FaceBook), would meet at Bryce and set up their telescopes for anyone and everyone who wanted to have a look at the night sky.\n\nBryce Canyon is home to astroscientists. Since the park works hard to control light pollution, it has one of the darkest night skies of the national parks. Last night, I looked out across the sky at millions of stars. You could see the moon hugging the horizon. You could see Mars just above the evergreen trees. Along the ecliptic, you could see Leo and Scorpio. You could see the Milky Way band. It was truly amazing.\n\nI first took astronomy as a junior in high school. I loved the course. ‘Arc to Arcturus’ and ‘Spike to Spica.’ I remember the little sayings to help remember the sky. Always start with the Big Dipper (in Ursa Major), interestingly enough- not an official constellation, just an asterism. I remember the summer triangle of stars- Vega, Deneb, and Altair. SO MANY THINGS came flooding back into my consciousness. I have Mr. Jackson to thank for that. I also have to thank my dad for my love for space. In college, I was obsessed with Frank Close (a professor at Oxford) and his research on “nothing” after hearing a soundbite embedded into one of Alan Parson’s songs, “Temporalia.” The ideas in quantum physics, multiple dimensions, string theory, spectroscopy, etc. have always fascinated me.\n\nLast night, as the park ranger told stories and facts about the constellations, he shared about his favorite constellation- Leo (the lion). THIS PART I DIDN’T KNOW. Anyone of my students could tell you that I don’t like Shakespeare as a person- like just from what I’ve read, not a fan. BUT, they would also tell you that I love A Midsummer Night’s Dream… and the framed narrative, “Pyramus and Thisbe” (because it is way better than Romeo and Juliet… because there is a lion). AND, THEN, I LEARNED THAT THE LION IN PYRAMUS AND THISBE IS LEO. So, rewind.\n\nIn about 8 C.E., Ovid, a Roman poet, wrote a compilation of folklore called The Metamorphoses. In this compilation is the story of Pyramus and Thisbe… which is the O.G. story of Romeo and Juliet (the story that most American high schools force students to read). BUT, in this case, I think P & T have a much cooler story. So, once upon a time, there were two families that did not like each other… but they lived in a townhouse. An earthquake left a crack in one of the conjoining walls. After a while, Pyramus (the guy) and Thisbe (the girl) started chatting it up and “fell in love.” So, they made a game plan to run away together and meet at this tree. Thisbe went first. They had to time it out just right so as to quell suspicions. On her way to the tree, a lioness was returning from hunting. Thisbe freaked out a little and dropped her cloak. The lion sniffed the cloak and moved on with her life. Pyramus, thinking the coast was clear, headed out. Then, he saw it (insert dramatic music). He saw Thisbe’s cloak covered in blood… and he thought the lioness killed her. So, being all impulsive and reactionary, he went to their meeting tree and stabbed himself. Thisbe, thinking it was safe to resume her journey, hobbled along to the meeting tree. There, she found the dead Pyramus. And, yeah, she killed herself too. I know this story well. I have to teach it so that my students know what the workmen are trying to present in their play for Duke Theseus and Hippolyta (in AMSND). However, what I didn’t know is that the constellation Leo is tied to this story- except somehow the lioness in Ovid’s tale became a lion in the Greek tale. So, Zeus threw Leo into the sky to remind people that lovers are crazy and impulsive.\n\nClassroom application: I’ve decided that next year, it would be cool to do a constellation story unit. I want to find a grant to set up a small planetarium for my students. Then, I want to assign different constellations to different students. Each student will have to research the story (or stories) behind each constellation. I think this will be a new twist in my Greek mythology unit.\n\nP.S. And why Hubble? Edwin Hubble worked at New Albany High School (the oldest public high school in Indiana) before going on to receive the honor of having the Hubble telescope named after him. So, gotta shout-out to my Indiana people.\n\n\"OVERHYPED PIECES OF AMERICANA.\" MAY 2021.\n\nPlease don’t mistake being vulnerable for being weak. Oftentimes it takes more strength to be vulnerable than it does to be guarded. Don’t ever apologize for being too deep- for letting people see who you really are- for letting yourself do that. Yes, you will probably get hurt doing this. Yes, you will probably learn how to build walls. But, it is also the only way to truly get comfortable with who you are. There is a reason why self-help books sell.\n\nI told someone that I always said my favorite holiday (when I was growing up) was Derby Day. It was the unofficial start of summer- the signal that it probably wasn’t going to snow anymore- the signal that I just had to make it through one more month of school. At the start of May, my family would gather together and bet money on horse races. The Kentucky Derby is a horse racing event characterized by obnoxious hats (a.k.a. art), bourbon mint juleps (a.k.a. chemistry), and betting money based on odds (a.k.a. math). Every year, I looked forward to picking my favorite horse, watching the races on the TV that sat on the back deck at my grandparents’ house, and eating Derby pie until my stomach hurt.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is one of three horse races in the Triple Crown (the others are the Preakness (Maryland) and the Belmont (New York)). The day before the Derby is the Oaks- for three-year old fillies. Therefore, most of the horses that run in the Derby are colts. When I attended Catholic school, the majority of the teachers would be gone for the Oaks- it was a tradition.\n\nIt wasn’t until I went away for college (a two-hour drive north) that I realized that people didn’t celebrate the Derby all across the state- that it was just a “me thing.” I always laugh about that- because growing up, I just assumed it was like St. Patty’s Day- “everyone” celebrates that. I remember telling this to a guy once and he was low-key condescending about it- like ‘bless your heart’ you naive girl from Southern Indiana. I had another guy tell me it was just “an overhyped piece of Americana.” Sometimes people are the worst. They think that I was confessing something, like an embarrassing memory, but really I was showing them a part of my culture and history- a deeper part of who I am and where I come from- a part that doesn’t need pity or judgment- a part that is just what it is- a glimpse into personality… which is absolutely a product of Americana (and in a good way). Of course, for both of these conversations, I just let it go- because they don’t get it. Maybe they never will. But, I learned from them. When some guy is telling me about how he first got into video games or about his favorite sport or the first car he worked on (stuff that I personally couldn’t care less about in my own life- I don’t tell them they are naive for endorsing an “overhyped piece of Americana”), I listen to their recollections- to the piece of information that they are giving me- to those glimpses of who they are as a person and what cultural practices shaped them into the person sitting before me. And, I don’t shame them for these interests- these beautiful pieces of Americana. Passion is vulnerability.\n\nIT'S A FOOL'S DAY. JANUARY 2021.\n\nIt's the New Year, but it just feels like another day. I looked at the date and immediately thought, ahhh, it's January Fool's Day. My eighth grade science teacher, Mr. Smith, was one of those amazing teachers that I failed to appreciate because I was too young to fully understand his inherent genius and his snappy sarcasm. In fact, he is one of the reasons that I tactfully avoided teaching middle school level students. I am sure it has its perks.... but nope. Mr. Smith retired the year that I left middle school for high school. And, many years later, I still wish that I could have apologized for not fully understanding how great of a teacher he was at the time.\n\nOn day one, Mr. Smith told us he would not be putting up with anything that year. He stood in front of us and said that anyone, who aspired to achieve As and Bs that year, should take a seat at the front lab tables. Those, who aspired to ride in the C range, should take a seat in the middle of the classroom. Those, who wished to perform below average or not put forth any effort, should sit in the back row of lab tables. This was the year in school when I decided to get my life together and become a nerd. I sat in the front row of lab tables.\n\nBefore each exam, Mr. Smith would place the exams face down on the lab tables- placing a stack in front of each person in the front row. If someone tried to pass them back before he was said it was okay to do so, he would stop the class and say, \"The last person who did that was called Stubby. Do you also want to be called Stubby?\" He would then proceed to give his pre-exam lecture. \"If you studied for forty hours, if you prayed to God that you might pass this exam for thirty hours, if you have a degree in biology or chemistry from Harvard or Yale, and if you personally thanked all the loving taxpayers of Floyd County for so generously providing you with a paper copy of this exam right here today, then you just might pass with a C. Good luck. You may begin.\" Papers were passed back and the race to finish the exam began. Later in the week, when we received our graded exams, Mr. Smith would call us up to his desk one by one- placing either a 'Brother' or a 'Sister' in front of our names. Then, he would proceed to announce the grade when we approached the desk. \"Sister Fougerousse, 98. You can do better.\" I was rather introverted that year, and Mr. Smith intimidated me. So, my response was always, \"Yes sir\" as my shaking hand grabbed the exam and my nervousness propelled me back to my seat. I managed to always get 98s that year... always an answer away from perfection. Yeah... I can be quite melodramatic.\n\nWhen Mr. Smith was upset/irritated/annoyed because students wouldn't listen (as was sometimes the case since the class followed lunch hour), he would stop the lecture, turn his back to us, and begin lecturing directly to the wall in front of him.... for the ENTIRE class period... announcing that the wall was a better listener than us. I once had to use the restroom. He gave me a minute and thirty seconds. The class timed me.... and I returned a minute and 40 seconds late- embarrassed and humiliated. But, I learned to never again ask to use the restroom during his class. On occasion, we received a lecture regarding the entitlement of my generation. He would start off, \"I remember when Highlander Point was nothing but a field. Those were the days when hard work meant something...\"\n\nOn the first of every month, Mr. Smith would say, \"Happy [Insert Month] Fool's Day.\" If someone forgot their homework and tried to make up an excuse, Mr. Smith would say, \"Oh, I see! ...said the blind man.\" Then, just stare at the student before strolling back up to the front of the classroom.\n\nAt the end of the school year, during course recommendations for high school, Mr. Smith called each of us up to his desk. \"Sister Fougerousse.\" I walked up to his desk. He had a sign behind him that read, \"I am not your mother. This is not your house. Pick up after yourself. This is a school.\" He told me that he was recommending me for Honors Biology in high school. He wanted to know what I thought. I told him that I didn't think I was smart enough to take Honors Biology. He said he disagreed, but respected my wishes and allowed me to enroll in the average level course.\n\nI believe that high school courses and my high school teachers had the strongest impact on my work ethic, my foundational knowledge, and my life. But, I would be remiss to forget the valuable lessons that I learned from an eighth grade science teacher. I was just too young to respect his jadedness, his ability to deal with entitled pre-teens, and his commitment to a world of education that probably seemed in shambles at that time. His legacy still echoes every time I see the first of a month. Happy January Fool's Day.\n\nSOMETIMES. SEPTEMBER 2020.\n\nSometimes I forget to hear the house breathe. I forget to listen to its voice in the early hours of the morning or the late hours of the night- when all around me the world pauses except for those nocturnal few that write all night long or work second shifts at the factory and drive home on empty roads.\n\nThe sun gives me hope and energy and vibrancy. But, the night gives me rest and depth and peace.\n\nI’m living in an apartment complex in an artsy Midwest town at this point in my life. It’s very nine to five and family oriented. It’s a place that I never thought I’d call my temporary home, but things and places and people have a way of changing your mind if you’re open to letting them change your mind.\n\nIt’s cold tonight for September. I fell asleep at five o’clock and woke up at midnight. I put the kettle on and listened until the water sang from inside. I made a batch of midnight pancakes. I started the fake fireplace with a flip of a switch and brought out the space heater. And, for the first time, in a long two months of covid-inspired anxiety, I felt a great sense of peace- the pervasive kind of contentment that comes with all the nostalgic feelings of home.\n\nThe streets are quiet tonight. The cars of all the engineers in this small town are parked in rows and the parking lot lights shine down on them with that Thomas Kincaid glow.\n\nSometimes I miss the city- London or Paris- just depends. Not usually though. Usually the big red sun that rises in the east as I drive through the alternating cornfields and soybean fields is exactly what my soul needs. Sometimes though, on crisp, but sunny mornings- when that fall breeze harkens the coming winter, I miss the diversions of crowded streets, of reading on a park bench- half engrossed in the ideas locked in prose and half people watching and wondering how magical and beyond comprehension it is that so many lives exist alongside each other and interweave even though we never fully understand that level of connection.\n\nSometimes, like people who say they can have triggers from LSD trips from the sixties, I will see something, and my mind will time travel through neuron paths to a memory that I forgot to remember for a while. I’ll miss those huge flocks of white birds that rose from freshly plowed fields of brown gold earth as the train cut through the northern French countryside and I listened to the cadence and brilliance of accents and languages fill the spaces around me. Sometimes I miss the feeling of being unnoticeably alone- of spending four hours in a café as if it were the way life was supposed to be lived- absorbed- noticed. Sometimes I miss the freedom of reading at two in the morning perched in window seat of a skyscraper building and watching people start to slowly trickle back from the pubs in the light drizzle of a late night shower… and the feeling of knowing that I didn’t have to be anywhere the next day and that there wasn’t an impossible list of expectations crushing my stamina.\n\nSometimes I miss a life I haven’t lived yet. What happens to latent energy if it’s never used? Is energy like the water cycle- does it cycle through again- never really leaving us-just transforming into different states of being?\n\nI wish I lived in a culture that took their waking slow- that started later in the day- that made time for breakfast. I want long breakfasts. I want time in my mornings to soak in the world and watch the sun rise high in the sky. I want the time to refresh instead of hitting the snooze button five times before a rushed 6AM morning routine and knowing that I won’t have the mental capacity to grade papers that day because of the cyclical impact of sleep deprivation and the mental stamina needed to fully engage with intellectual work and marking.\n\nBut, then, sometimes in the early, early morning or late, late night, I will look around at this space I call home and realize that without all the hard work and privileges of employment, I wouldn’t have the moments of revelation when I remember to listen to the house breathe and listen to the voice of this beautiful and reviving space.\n\nThey say that you don’t know what you’ve got until it's gone. Maybe that is true. But, sometimes you do know what you have even as the time slips like grains of sand in an hourglass. Sometimes you do miss something before it's over. Sometimes you do have the power to harness and bracket appreciation for its finite capacity. If that weren’t true, then gratitude wouldn’t be true either.\n\nThe lateral plane of streams of consciousness is a map of dotted sometimes and ‘if, then’ statements with all its streetlights, and remembered forgotten memories, and the personifications of living moments.\n\nABOUT IU & COLLEGE ADVICE. JULY 2020.\n\nI've only ever attended three universities (the local one while I was still in high school, IU, and King's College London). However, of the three, IU was by far my favorite place to be. I know it might be different in times of Covid, but I thought I would share some advice (it is mostly tied to IU, but some of it is universal to the college experience). (1) Walk everywhere. People are always talking about the freshman 15. Just walk everywhere. Bloomington is a beautiful place to be, especially in the fall and spring. (2) Soak in the limestone buildings, the Gothic architecture, and find your favorite place/building. (3) If you can't walk, know the bus routes. (3) Find your study space- whether it is in the Union or in the back room of Soma cafe off of Kirkwood Ave. (or the Pour House or the stacks in the Wells Library), make sure it is cozy, there's an outlet, and that it's a space where you can knock things out. Sidebar: there is/was a pretty cool record store attached to Soma last time I took students on a college visit. Always have good playlists. Always. (4) Find your guilty pleasure snack. Mine was pretzels and Nutella... and that carried me through long nights of drafting papers. (5) Find your favorite pizza place. Mother Bear's was about two minutes from my dorm freshman year... and they definitely had my name saved in their phone. The Munchie Madness deal was a staple in my diet. (6) Get cookies from Baked at midnight. (7) Find the gravestone that says, \"She was an optimist.\" It says this because she thought she would die in 2000 something- had that engraved on her tombstone... then ended up dying in 1999. (8) Keep your dorm space tidy. There are worse things than a messy roommate.... but still. (9) If you have to get a roommate, go with a random roommate. Yeah, you run the risk of getting a crazy one. BUT, you also meet your best college friends that way. (10) At some point, turn your dorm room into a blanket fort... yeah, it's childish, but it's also a way to switch things up when life comes crashing down and things start to become mundane. (11) Watch the light show on the side of the art museum at night. (12) Find a building to watch the stars from- upcoming meteor showers: Perseids (August 11-12) and Orionoids (October 20-21). (13) Go to the basketball games if you can... even if it's in the nose bleed section... if they have them this year. Tailgate whenever you get the chance during football season. \"Swim\" in the fountain after a big win. (14) Take interesting classes with interesting professors. Ask around to find out which classes you want to take. Don't be afraid to go to office hours. College is all about networking. Don't let that aspect of college life slip past you. (15) I suggest at least one music history class. (16) Load up on the course load the first year. If you adapt to max. credit hours from the start, it'll be a nice change of pace when you lighten your course load later into the game. (17) Explore. Ask questions. Find new places. Meet new people. Consider new perspectives. (18) Remember that the alternate reality of college life is a privilege- and never forget to be grateful for it and to make the most of it. You get four years to live it up. Take the opportunity and run with it.\n\nTHIS ONE MOMENT. JANUARY 2020.\n\n\"I want this one moment. It's what I want in a relationship, which might explain why I'm single now. Haha. It's kind of hard to... it's that thing when you're with someone and you love them and they know it, and they love you and you know it. But, it's a party! And, you're both talking to other people, and you're laughing and shining, and you look across the room, and catch each other's eyes. But, not because you're possessive or it's precisely sexual, but because that is your person in this life. And, it's this secret world that exists right there, in public, unnoticed, that no one else knows about. It's sort of like how they say that other dimensions exist all around us but we don't have the ability to perceive them?That's what I want out of a relationship. Or just life, I guess. Love...\" [excerpt from Frances Ha- writer Noah Baumbach]\n\n\"It's never too late, or in my case, too early, to be whoever you want to be. There is no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it; I hope you make the best of it. And, I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you've never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point-of-view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. And, if you find that you're not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.\" [excerpt from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button- writer Eric Roth]\n\n\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity\" [excerpt from The Alchemist- writer Paulo Coelho]\n\n\"Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away.. and this shows that the space around you is growing... be happy about your growth, in which, of course, you can't take anyone with you. And, be gentle to those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith and joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again. When you see them, love life in a form that is not your own. And, be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without ever having to step outside of it\" [excerpt from Letters to a Young Poet- writer Rainer Maria Rilke]\n\n\"You're five foot nothin', one hundred and nothin', not a speck of athletic ability, but you hung in there with the best college football players in the land for two years. And, you're gonna walk out of here with a degree from the University of Notre Dame. In this life time, you don't have to prove nothin' to nobody but yourself. And, after what you've gone through, if you haven't done that by now, it ain't never gonna happen\" and \"Son, in thirty-five years of religious study, I've come up with only two hard, incontrovertible facts: there is a God, and I'm not him\" [excerpts from Rudy- writer Angelo Pizzo]\n\n\"I was going to say something good. Something that would have solved all our problems and made everything better. But, you know what? I forgot what it was.\" and \"Tragedy is a foreign territory. We don't know how to talk to the natives\" [excerpts from The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby- writer Ned Benson]\n\nThere are those literary moments when writers capture the essence that so often escapes the capacity of language. These are some of my favorite moments. They encompass fear, love, loneliness, change, solitude, relationships, and life--- concepts that are so much bigger than written expression. Nevertheless, the above quotations stick with me through time- revisit me in times that seem relevant and remind me why I fostered a passion for the literary arts.\n\nMASTER NARRATIVES. NOVEMBER 2019.\n\nIt's the first Saturday that I've had off in a long time. When I say \"off,\" I mean \"free.\" \"Free\" from other commitments, from work, from catching up, from volunteering for something. What do I want to do? I want to sleep. Then, I want to put off grading those last forty essays and research new topics. I've realized that a lot of my knowledge (the knowledge that surfaces in my classroom) is tied to 2016. Weird, right? Except, not really. The last time I was teaching in a racially & ethnically diverse classroom was during the 2016-2017 school year. When I mean \"diverse,\" I mean there was racial and politically-driven tension between students, and it was a platform for discussion. Then, I took a sabbatical. Then, I was teaching at Hauser (not as \"diverse\" as my former placements.. or so I thought- until the impromptu and spontaneous \"political debate\" last week). I think remaining culturally responsive as an educator is extremely important as we venture further into this millennium. Which master narratives connect with my current students? Which master narratives do not connect with my students? Of the two categories, regardless of connection levels, which ones do I teach?\n\nI like teaching AP Language because it forces me to stay in the loop- to search for the master-narratives perpetuating through our contemporary society- both locally and globally. Because, I want my students to discuss the opioid crisis in Indiana as well as the Yellow Vest Movement in France. I want them to understand the Red for Ed movement as much as they understood the Standing Rock Movement (or did they even know about that?). I want to hear their political opinions, reasons why they like or dislike the current president. I want to hear their thoughts on climate change, on immigration, on feminist movements, on body image, on rape culture, on heteronormative culture, on bipartisan systems, on capitalism, on gender & sexuality, on socialism, on white privilege, on VSCO girls, on the psychology of lying, on modern dating, on vaping, on social media influence, on screen time, on the rise of podcasts, on texting, on current vernacular, on [insert whatever other topic] here. It's insightful. I learn so much from their conversations.\n\nOne of my students mentioned that she was talking about what we were learning in class- an argumentative assignment regarding one of Prince Ea's videos about climate change- at home. [Students were to listen to a spoken word piece and find three claims and three pieces of evidence used within the piece. Then, at the end of the unit, they could chose to agree or disagree with any of the claims.] She said that her family remarked that of course I was brainwashing students with that kind of stuff. This was insightful for me. Does exposure equate to brainwashing? Does offering a student the agency to critically analyze something equate to indoctrination? I mean, I guess, maybe? It's kind of a leap, but I can definitely see where they are coming from here. I am an authority figure. I am giving an assignment. I am asking for student opinion- backed with logic and critical thinking. But, see- the first two categories tend to overpower the last category. Why? Because banking educational paradigms still reign in the world of standardization and \"traditional\" teaching platforms. Because we still assume that there is always a \"right\" and a \"wrong\" answer- a binary model of thinking. Sometimes there is. Sometimes there isn't. We still (maybe even unknowingly) assume that the authority has the \"right\" answer. [And, before you get all critical about the problem with \"fence-sitters\" and murky realms of gray- I have my issues with that too. Don't worry.] So, I guess this is how you know that the issues discussed are controversial. But, what if I just stuck to the \"safe\" realms of discussion? Speaking of which, what are those \"safe\" realms? What would the fallbacks be there?\n\nHow do I teach history through literature? How do I catch everything? I don't. That's the simple answer: I don't. I am as much a solution to the problem of missed narratives as I am a contributor to the problem of missed narratives. As Rebecca Solnit, writer of the essay, \"Twenty Million Missing Storytellers,\" says, \"We live inside what, during postmodernism's heyday, we'd call master narratives- so there's always a question of who's telling the story, who is in charge of the narrative, and what happens if it changes.\" I guess, indirectly, I am the one telling these stories, because I find them, collect them, and integrate them into the curriculum. But, the writers are in charge of the narrative. And, my students are in charge of whether or not interpretations of the narratives change. So, as I search for new topics, I pay close attention to the TV shows that are trending. I watch out for the themes and plot lines and tropes inherent in Netflix originals or Amazon originals. I watch the Goodreads list of the best nonfiction books of 2019. I watch the trends, the conversations, the headlines- trying to catch a population sample for my students.\n\n2019 Collected List of Master Narratives:\n\nMurder Mysteries; Discerning America's Future; Empowering Women; Digital Millennialism; The Age of Trump; Working Class Narratives; Sexual Harassment Stories; School Shootings & Gun Violence; Obesity & Body Image Standards; Police Brutality; Political Platforms & Bipartisan Arguments; The Value of College Versus College Debt; Religious Cults; Tragic Childhood Memoirs; Epidemic of Stress & Anxiety; Crime & Punishment (Criminal Justice); Ruth Bader Ginsberg; Mental Illness & Mental Health; Drug Crises; Vape Nation; Elton John & Freddie Mercury (used to discuss sexuality); Transgender Movement & Pronouns; Out with the Hipster- Onto the VSCO Girl\n\nWhat can we learn from these contemporary narratives? Which trends do we notice? How will these trends develop or change through time? What will an AP Language course look like fifty years down the road?\n\nLOLOMI. OCTOBER 2019\n\n​\"For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake.\" -Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nAs I stepped onto the curb at the Louisville airport, my mom (who is always there when I need her), gave me a quick hug and told me to hold on to my stuff if I decided to sleep before my flight. It was 4:30AM. I smiled and said something to the effect that it wasn't my first rodeo. Sleeping in an airport was never something that I intentionally placed on my bucket list. Nevertheless, it had happened before. And, I venture to assume that it will happen some time in the future as well. I flew into Midway. Then, I flew to Portland. I only laugh because ten years ago, I was convinced that I would never travel.\n\nOne of my best friends was waiting at the airport when I arrived. She had just moved out there this past summer with her fiancee. There were three of us that used to run around in high school. We were all neighbors. We all went to the same middle school and the same high school; but, I was the youngest. C was three years ahead of me. K was two years ahead of me. Nevertheless, we all tended to get along despite our vastly different personality types and age differences (which aren't that big of a deal now- but they could have been at the time). C went to Purdue and became a chemical engineer. K became a mom to three beautiful children. And, I went to IU and became a teacher. We spent summers watching Friends re-runs, playing ultimate freesbie, and having neighborhood water balloon fights and spontaneous dance parties. We went shopping, went to the movies, went to the mall, and went to the water park. We were there for each other through the awkward fashion phases, through the break-ups, and through the other seemingly unavoidable happenings of high school existence. C tutored students that struggled with math. K didn't work in high school. I worked at the local ice cream place. We rode the bus together until Mom started driving us to school. Later, C drove; then, I drove. C was the sensible and laidback one. She was the epitome of 'chill' and so intelligent that we knew she was headed for greatness. She never studied and still aced every test that she took. She was a minimalist at heart. K knew she was going to be a mom before she became one. So, she sowed her wild oats pretty early on. She was outgoing and full of adventure and always ready to take a leap of faith. I was introverted and had to study for those As. But, I was also the person that kept our group together. We were always at my house. I always planned things. And, when I say I planned, I mean I PLANNED (all caps, boldface, underline, italics). Whether it was a girl's day out or something super long-term, I had a plan. I planned each of our weddings down to the wedding china. I bought a baby name's book so that everyone was ready when and if they decided to have a baby ten years down the road. I planned our Halloween plans, our Christmas plans, etc. I planned our proms, even though C refused to go. And, with time, we each drifted away from intended plans and found our own paths. C moved to an apartment in Cincy. K moved to an apartment in New Albany. I moved to an apartment in London. Then, C moved to Oregon. K moved home. I moved to Indiana. And, even though we'll never be as close as we were for those seven years of our lives, we still cross paths from time-to-time. Sometimes I will see K's kids visiting their grandma across the street in my hometown. And, sometimes, I fly for six hours to see C and her new life and all of the promise on the horizon. We went wedding dress shopping, took the dogs on a hike, found the best food places, listened to live music, found the best waterfalls, and drove down roads lined with beautiful fall color. We went to Powell's bookstore, discussed old memories, looked forward to new memories, and the like. And, you know it's a true friend when they have a space heater for you in the guest bedroom bc they know you are always cold. When I went to see the wedding venue, above the door read the word 'lolomi.' And, my mind was trying to place that word to its tribal nation. It is Hopi for 'perfect happiness be upon you.' The Navajo term would be 'hozho,' which means 'to walk in beauty.' It's fitting that these words stand out in my life. They are about roots, about those inseparable concepts that accompany life in all its grandeur and shortcomings. And, as I flew out of Portland and then out of Vegas, I wished that for C & K- I wish them lolomi and hozho in all the plans that are lived out and re-written and dreamed up.\n\nSPACES BETWEEN. JULY 2019\n\nImpressions are just that- impressions. Nothing more. Nothing less. They can be accurate or illusive. They can be whatever we make them.\n\nIt was June in Colorado. I had to ride with some other people because I didn't have a car and the truck wasn't big enough to fit everyone and the dog. I had just met those people the night before at a ska concert where we listened to The Alcapones and The Slackers- both bands that I had never heard of before. I felt like Bob Marley met a New Orleans street band. I liked it.\n\nThen, the next morning, we all decided to go on a hike about an hour outside of Denver. So, I sat in a car listening to R&B and rap, except not the R&B I like. I'm all about Marvin Gaye and even further back to the roots with Delta Blues and Muddy Waters. I still listen to Robert Johnson's \"All My Love's in Vain\" and listen to the resonance of recorded guitar strings and think about how much I like the sound of real instruments. I like songs with vocals too. I don't know much about the technical aspects of music or the language used to describe those aspects. Like, okay- four bars... and then I'm not sure. But, I like the singer-songwriters. I like listening to the spaces between the words and their relation to the words (literary training?). Miles Davis once said, \"It's the space in between the notes that's important, not the notes themselves.\" And, in retrospect, I wish in most moments of my life that I had mastered the ability to realize the bigger picture- to see things more clearly- more deeply in the moment. I wish I could be a little less judgmental and a little more analytical. In two hours of listening to a reel of explicit language filled with not-so-good connotations and horrifying declarations of human objectification and an endless drive toward monetary gain, I finally did something that I didn't think was possible- I stopped listening to the words, stopped hearing the meaning locked and exuded by the vocals, and stopped thinking like an English major. I stopped; and, what I noticed were the technical aspects of the songs- the way the music sounded- the beats and the rhythms and the structure of the music itself. Maybe it's the structure of rap that makes it so relatable. It's pace is fast- like our lifestyles. There are so many things hitting you at once- like the increasing frequency of expectations and competitions for our attention every day (the cell phone buzz, the in-person conversation that's happening, the TV or radio that is on in the background, the awareness of the conversation that is happening next to you (that doesn't necessarily involve you in any way), the acknowledgement of the weather or the traffic or the deer in the field on the side of the road, all. at. once.) It's the same thing in a rap song- you have beats and bars and words and rhymes and rhythm shifts and everything hitting you all. at. once. You have to make meaning of all of it. Just like anything else- personal focus is what comes into play. While I've always focused in on the lyrics and the meanings behind the words- just like I'll always focus in on the in-person conversation that I'm having. The thing is that everything else becomes peripheral and secondary. The text message or the the bars- or whatever else is left- become(s) less noticeable to me personally. This is all great and what not- like keen observation- blah. But, what is even more insightful, I think at least, is the reflection that springs from the Miles Davis comment. What about the space in between the notes?\n\nThey've become shorter in a rap song- the silences or the negative spaces have been pushed out. Or have they? Because when we are listening to music, we are listening for sound-not necessarily the spaces of overlap- the ending of the note- the space in-between the last note and the next note. Pharrell Williams talks about the Mona Lisa in a lecture at NYU's Clive Davis Institute. If you go to The Louvre, you will most likely find the crowd of people around this relatively small and supposedly mysterious painting. But, he says he sees the space around it- the negative space- the space that's overlooked. I didn't notice that when I went. I noticed the anxiety of the crowd and this little kid on his dad's shoulders trying to see over the masses to glimpse this famous painting. Can we apply this to our current versions and approaches to literary analysis? Can we see prose as a rap song- fast-paced, highly structured, and compressed? Is it weird to compare prose and rap (since we always pair up poetry and rap)? If it is weird, why? What role does structure have in writing and comprehension and the expression of experience? How does poetry change our notions of comprehension? How does poetry use space? And, are the words (or notes) not important then?\n\nIf you haven't ever listened to Robert Johnson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BkPm8JIJJQ\n\nPharrell Williams Visit at NYU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0u7lXy7pDg\n\nUnderstanding the Intersection of Poetry & Rap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU&t=3s\n\nSYCAMORE HALL. JUNE 2019.\n\nCreative Writing Prompt: Think of an interaction between two people. Then, describe the interaction from each person's perspective. I decided to go from a first to third to second person point-of-view. However, you can do as you feel. Be sure to play with the notion of unreliable narrators. [Inspiration: Life Itself by Dan Fogelman (film) and The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby by Ned Benson (film) and a recent drive through Bloomington]\n\nI liked Sycamore Hall the best. It’s medieval Gothic architecture- the big wooden doors, the window panes, the winding Jane Eyre stairs, the imposing limestone. The classroom was small. People piled in each day with their leggings and KOK t-shirts. I always sat closer to the back because I had to hurry from a former class. I walked with this tall kid who would push my five foot nothing self to get to class on time. We would loop past Jacob’s School of Music and down the little pass back to the building. It was a Chaucer class for English majors and English education majors (the less serious of the group). There were a lot of stigmas, but that’s not the point. We were discussing “The Wife of Bath’s Tale.” Alisoun (the wife of Bath) cites all the “authorities,” but then underlines with a question: who peyntede the leoun? Of course, this is an allusion to the Aesop fable. A lion points to a picture is of a man strangling a lion. The lion incites the idea that a man clearly painted the image; for, if it had been a lion that painted the picture, the lion would be mangling the man. Here it is, the greatest debate question of literary criticism: how do you identify an unreliable narrator (and does it matter)? Heroes and villains might be perspective if we invoke an ‘us-versus-them’ binary. Of course, we prefer binaries in our early stages of analysis- we save the dialectics for later. In the preface to E.P. Thompson’s The Making of the English Working Class, he writes, “The blind alleys, the lost causes, and the losers themselves are forgotten” (12). But, how do we know about the blind alleys? Who is there to remember the lost causes? Is every person forgotten? Is every loser a person? Every person a loser? To what extent does subjectivity define the blind, the lost, and the loser?\n\nWe have something called a phonological loop. It takes in every sound within our threshold and stores it for thirty (ish) seconds before releasing it into an unretainable abyss. That’s why, we often say ‘what?’ and then answer the ‘what’ promptly after posing the question. It is still there in our potential vault of memory. If we don’t add significance to it, it loops out… it’s lost- forgotten. Every thirty seconds. So, how much of what I remember is the ‘true’ story? So, let’s have some fun with an uncertain narrator. [Writing prompt: write the same story two different ways- emphasize different details- let the reader decide who the heroes and villains are.]\n\nShe disliked Sycamore Hall the most. It’s medieval Gothic architecture- the big wooden doors, the window panes, the winding Jane Eyre stairs, the imposing limestone. The classroom was oppressively small. Shallow people piled in with their leggings and KOK t-shirts. She sat closer to the back because they were always late. He had all of the same classes. There was no escape. She wasn’t sure if she felt sorry for him or if she just chose to accept the fate of having to deal with him. He was the first one to make a move after all. They had been in class. He swiveled around in his chair and asked if she had Chaucer after class. She had said yes. So, he decided that they would walk together. That’s how he was. He seemed nice, but his over-confidence was sometimes less leadership and more control. He was a suck-up too. During the first day, he drafted a new syllabus for the class while the professor raved over him. She wanted him to disappear right there. He was so sure of himself and so inconsiderate of how his own aura overpowered those around him. He was driven- sure. He was passionate too. But, in the crossfire between drive and passion, he seemed to forget to notice how his energy eviscerated the others. Though he seemed compassionate, there was something inherently contradictory in his compassion. There was something about his humility too that came off as insincere or unstable. He was this walking paradox that always lagged too far behind even when she tried to walk slowly. And, despite all his flaws, he had a certain charisma. He asked questions. A lot of questions. He wanted to know what she was like as a kid, what her parents were like, what her friends were like. She hadn’t met anyone like that- someone so invested in her life without an ulterior motive. She thought maybe he liked her. So, she tested the waters a bit. She would say things to lead him on and then cut him down if he reacted in any way that indicated that he might have feelings for her. She decided to use him. She would take on different personas from television shows and play them out in real time. She would tell her friends stories afterward. He became a running joke. Her friends were so excited to meet him because he was the unknowing subject of her psychological games. The best part was that he didn’t know any better. He actually thought they were friends. She felt momentarily bad about this, but it faded. He could be mean too. He knew enough about her that he could retaliate if he wanted to. The more she learned about him, the more she could call his bluff, the more she could see that his drive was fueled by fear of inadequacy and his passion was fueled by an unrelenting idealism and moral code. He was flawed, but so was she.\n\nHe liked Sycamore Hall the best. It’s medieval Gothic architecture- the big wooden doors, the window panes, the winding Jane Eyre stairs, the imposing limestone. The classroom was intimately small and nostalgic. Sleepy college people piled in wearing their leggings and KOK t-shirts. He always sat closer to the back because they were always late, and he knew it was his fault. He came from a sheltered background. So, his first dating experience was tragic in a cringy, G-rated kind of way, to say the least. He decided that he was going to be different in college. He was going to be confident and driven and passionate. And, most of all, he wasn’t going to get hurt. So, on the first day, he decided to begin. He decided to talk. He hadn’t said more than ten words in front of a group in high school; but, today- today was different. So, he drafted a new syllabus for the class, he talked to the girl sitting behind him, he grabbed life by the horns in one of those terrifying moments of lucidness where everything seems possible. The problem with those moments is that they slowly fade away and the original person remains. Adrenaline wears off. Regardless of whether he choose to fight or take flight, he would eventually have to rest. So, at the end of the day, he sat alone in a dorm room and replayed everything in his head, and he felt like vomiting. He felt like a fraud. So, in the weeks to come, he put on his confidence and kept up a façade only letting bits and pieces of his true self out. He asked questions. Lots of questions. He wanted to know people’s stories- why they were the way they were. He wanted to know her story. She was conceited and smart and lazy. She grew up in a middle-class family, always had friends, had this charisma about her- the kind that showed that whenever she decided to turn her act on, she could have anything that she put her mind to. She had a cruel side too. He knew it even if he didn’t want to know it. She played games- mind games- and he would try to navigate through without stepping on a landmine. He didn’t like her the way he thought she thought he liked her. He would never date someone like her- someone with the capacity to destroy him- to completely disintegrate his confidence. He knew what it was like to be the running joke. He didn’t want that again. Her friends were excited to meet him. He tried his best to be amicable. He thought maybe, maybe for the first time, he could find that deeper level of existence- the kind that was true. She was flawed, but so was he.\n\nYou hated Sycamore Hall the most.

JUNE 2019.\n\n\"With all due respect to Thomas Wolfe, going home again has more to do with renewal than nostalgia, especially in the Midwest\" - Tom Watson & Jim McGarrah (from Home Again: Essays and Memoirs from Indiana)\n\nIt needs to be said. I remember a conversation from high school.... which is rare, because I am pretty good at repressing high school memories... haha, the dark days and yet, I've come back. Nevertheless, I remember that I took an advanced Earth Space class. I did this because I had already taken astronomy and meteorology and I planned my senior year classes based on my favorite teachers. So, advanced Earth Space it was. I can't remember if it was the start of class or the end of class, but we had some time for unstructured chatting. We (fellow students and myself) were trying to label people as either more 'East Coast' or more 'West Coast.' It was one of those conversations that you have once you've pretty much discussed everything with the people around you, so you resort to trivial conversation starters, like an endless game of twenty questions. This is where I gathered my journal prompt ideas for students.\n\nIn high school, my family didn't travel outside of the Midwest. We went to Florida once (the summer before my senior year of high school) because that was Mom's favorite place and Dad saved up enough money so that he could give her that memory. So, my knowledge of the world, was well, south of South Bend, west of Cincinnati, east of Illinois, and north of outer Louisville. That was it. Make a rectangle. And, it was great- I had no big dreams of leaving like so many teenagers often do. I wanted to visit France at some point in my lifetime. But, the concepts of being more \"East Coast\" or more \"West Coast\" were all conjecture and all unknown... actually I've still never been to either coast. I thought maybe I was more 'West Coast' because I liked my idea of the 1960s and sunshine and that whole Berkeley vibe. But, they were all like: no, you are definitely, definitely 'East Coast'- politically independent, modest, drawn to academics, etc., etc. So, I was like: okay, I'm 'East Coast.' Then, my whole not-having-big-traveling dreams dissipated pretty quickly because Bloomington happened. Then, the American Southwest happened. Then, Western Europe happened. But, what I think is interesting about our 'East Coast' or 'West Coast' discussion is the null points- no 'Southern Coast,' no 'Northern Border,' no 'West,' no 'Midwest,' no 'Southwest.' Black or white. No grey. And, even though my rectangle has grown to be south of Canada, east of California, west of Germany, and north of the bottom of Alabama, I am not 'East Coast' or 'West Coast,' I'm 'Midwest.' This is where I want to be. I could live anywhere. But, I want to be here. I like that initial rectangle despite all its flaws. I like its people (for the most part). I like that I can talk about Foucault around a bonfire and deconstruct all the rules of class and the boundaries that academia tries to impose.\n\nFlash-forward past high school and backward to grad school (part one). It was a spring day in London, and I was headed to the Virginia Woolf building for a scheduled appointment with Dr. Paul Gilroy to discuss the Blues aesthetic in Hurston's work. Dr. Gilroy's office window looked out onto the rooftop of a building where birds rested. After discussing the paper, I asked if he had always lived in London. He said it was his first home, but he had taught at Yale for a greater part of his career. I said that I was going back home to teach. He said it was good that I had found out where my home was- many people don't ever find that sense of place. Then, he talked about a certain bird that visited the other side of his window-- and for the life of me, I can't remember the type of bird.\n\nSo, today, when students asked me why I would give up London for Indiana, I knew they probably wouldn't understand that this is home. It's where I choose to be. And, while I might not be done flying about and exploring forever, I am going to stay right here for a bit and soak up the familiarity, reconstruct hope, and enjoy this place, these people, and this Midwestern culture. That, my young scholars, is why I chose Hauser. That is why I choose Hope.\n\nA SUPPOSEDLY THANKLESS JOB. JUNE 2019\n\n\"You choose a thankless job. You can't be upset when nobody thanks you. Don't start chasing applause and acclaim. That way lies madness.\" -Ron Swanson Parks and Recreation\n\nMy sloppy journal entry thesis: Yeah, I teach. Yeah, I complain. But, in the end, in the whole big picture view and all that sappy jazz, I am glad to be a teacher.\n\nPlease read into the tone here and secure yourself for a rant: I just \"love\" when students try to \"threaten\" me or \"get at\" me by complaining about my teaching style and how they want me to get fired just because they are being the epitome of lazy. Just for the record, this isn't a common thing. There is usually that one kid (or you know- those four kids or whatever it is any given year of teaching) each year that struggles with English class, decides to manifest that feeling of the struggle into a direct attack toward me and my teaching, and employs all the defense mechanisms and excuses to avoid the realization that we all struggle with something and that's okay. And, it's \"cool,\" because four times out of five, I am going to get through to these kids. They might never stop complaining. They might never admit that they have accepted the situation of being stuck with me and learning stuff that doesn't come easily or naturally for them. BUT, by the end, there's a pretty good chance that they will learn something.\n\nWhenever people ask me why high school? I answer: because they can usually take what they dish out. And, I keep it straight. I don't sugar coat. I am a pessimistic idealist or an optimistic realist at best. So, open note to those students who decide that it's cool to directly attack me and my teaching: Got an attitude problem? Cool, I can be sassy too. Want to play that sarcasm card? Cool, I'll raise you one. If you are looking for a show, please reschedule, I don't have time to waste. I didn't go into the profession thinking I'd make a lot of money, have \"free summers,\" or get a ton of respect at first. When you try to \"threaten\" me with being fired, don't think I haven't ever considered getting a job that was just a job- getting a job that didn't require copious hours of unpaid overtime- getting a job that is respected- getting a job that doesn't involve emotionally draining situations- getting a job where I don't have to cut costs and budget all the time- getting a job so I can pay off the debts that I've incurred trying to be a bit better as a teacher---- don't think I haven't thought about it. Because I have- and most of the teachers out there have. But, I'm not going to step down just for you. I'm not going to fold and make it that easy for you to fold back into your own defense mechanisms. [Oh snap- look at that rhetorically-aware, point-of-view decision.]\n\nHere's why I'm NOT going to throw it all away, pack up shop, or take the easy road: for every one of those kids that puts up a fight, I have another twenty or more (usually more- like this year I had 98) young adults, scholars, people, that truly inspire me- that truly motivate me get out of bed everyday, try my very best, work overtime, provide feedback and quasi-cursive, quasi-print comments in the margins, peruse through thrift shops to make our classroom a place where they want to be, spend hours planning an hour-long lesson, and seek out ways to be better. They cause me to count my innumerable blessings, for those students make me laugh and make me realize that teaching is all about learning. My greatest teachers are my students. AND, yeah, I know that is so trite and that it sounds insincere and what I would call \"fluffy.\" BUT, those kids- those kids that have off days and are human and are teenagers and have attitude problems and have awesome sides too, those students that go above and beyond to show the people around them that they care and give a ton of effort regardless of the in-the-grand-scheme-of-things-fleeting grade--- that's why any time I think about getting a job that's \"just a job,\" I won't do it.\n\nSo, open note to the golden ones: when they say you are going to change the world, the phrasing is wrong. You already changed the world- you are already changing the world- and you are the reason why teachers continuously take A LOT from others. You make it worth putting up with the rest of it. And, I'm not going to say this to your face, because it would be all weird and sentimental. But, you know it now, and that's the important part. You are awesome. Keep being you, keep pushing yourself to face new challenges, and always look back to see where you've been (and use that to motivate your goings wherever they may be or however they will look as you move forward). And, if you were in my class this past year, I'm talking about you. Just in case I didn't make that clear.\n\nFOR HERSH. APRIL 2019.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my dad was a dog person, and my mom was a cat person... So, naturally, we had cats. Mom brought home our first cat six years before I was born. She was a pre-school teacher and a farmer near her school was getting rid of a kitten that was deaf. The farmer was afraid the cat wouldn't last on the farm. Mom took in the cat, and that was that. She was the best cat, and she didn't know she was a cat. She had a temper though. She was always more Mom's cat than anyone else's cat. When I was in elementary school, the neighbor's cat had kittens. Mom and Dad both said no. So, I casually started feeding one of the cats that would wander over. Every day, after school, I would run inside, grab some of 'the beast's' (Dad's nickname for our first cat) food, and go feed Cookie (someone else named her, but it stuck). Life lesson one: feed people/animals, and they will keep coming back. Slowly, as time went by, on bad weather days, I would bring her inside \"just for the day.\" Then, eventually, my parents said that I could take her in. Life lesson two: persistence sometimes pays off. The neighbors were just glad to get her off their hands. It was a cold day at the start of the year and we were all sipping hot chocolate in front of the fireplace. Dad was reading the paper and Mom was reading a book. Sarah and I were sitting on the floor with the cats. Cookie was all sprawled out, soaking up the heat from the fireplace. She was fattening up... I just thought I was feeding her too much. But, that wasn't it. We started seeing little paws push against her stomach. Dad was not too happy about this turn of events. She had kittens that spring. We were allowed to keep two- one kitten each. Of course, I picked the runt. It was a male calico, and those typically do not live very long. It is rare to have a male calico cat. So, after my kitten died, I couldn't pick between the last two... so, we kept three kittens. Life lesson three: plans do not always work out the way we think they will. I named one of them Hershie- we called her Hersh for short. She had a strong personality from the beginning. She was clearly the alpha cat, and lived up to that early reputation. She was smart and had a devious side. She tried to attack me once as a kitten, and I threw her across the room. After that, we had a mutual understanding and she became 'my cat.' She followed me around everywhere. My sister said that Hersh would bully her whenever I left the room. So, Sarah and Hersh had a strained relationship until I left for college many years later. Hersh has always been more like a dog in ways. She always greets me whenever I get home from whenever I'm living, and exemplifies loyalty. It's been seventeen years. So, when I was at the softball game this past Monday, and I looked down at my phone and saw that they had to put her down, it didn't feel real. I'm not one of those people who think their pets are their children. They are pets; and there is a difference. But, Hersh was there for the whole show of my childhood and early adulthood. Ugh, I thought writing all this out might conjure some semblance of closure, but it still doesn't feel real yet.\n\nLET'S BE BETTER THAN IGNORANT. FEBRUARY 2019.\n\nI am not a writer. I am a typist and at very best a drafter. I write. Read over the work. Maybe place the composition in an accessible location. Then, I move on. Writers don’t do that. They re-work the same sentence 150 times. They live by word count- by polishing- by perfecting-by doing the same things again and again. Is that why there is a connotative romance to writing? Maybe. Maybe, writing is the same as marriage- re-working, polishing, perfecting, and doing the same things again and again.\n\nI tend to think I am a relatively consistent person. My life plans change and evolve, but my core values, my core dreams are still the same dreams that I held at twelve years old. Maybe it is this self-view that hinders a comprehensive understanding of the vast changes that plot my existence. I listen to the radio on my way to work as a high school public teacher in the mornings. I seek through the stations because I haven’t changed my set stations from the ones I use in my hometown. My clock in the car still reads the old time, because I never change it when we “fall back.” I am always on the “spring forward” time. I’ve listened to the radio most of my driving life. I am not savvy enough to listen to podcasts or my “own” music. Subsequently, I catch bits and pieces of radio talk shows, NPR, traffic and weather forecasts, and the like. And, here is one example of how my experiences have changed me without my ever realizing it.\n\nThe talk show people on the radios in the morning- not sure which ones- but they sometimes sound ignorant. Did I never recognize that before or have times changed? I never deeply, on a day-to-day level, realized the intense ignorance of the American people (myself included). My students were complaining about why guys always have to “get girls stuff” for Valentine’s Day and how that is “unfair.” I said that in Japanese culture, the women offer gifts to the men. I’m not sure if this is true. I’ve never fact-checked it. I just remember learning that in college. So, I prompted my students (a group of athletic, sophomore boys) to analyze why there might be that fundamental difference between Eastern and Western culture. My students said that I must be stupid- because we aren’t part of “Western” culture- they clarified, with condescension- we are in the Midwest (saying it really slowly). They, without realizing it, probably never think in a global mindset. They think America is the world. They probably never think in terms of global hemispheres. They are also so blindly sure of their own insight that they dismiss anything that might make them feel ignorant. Sure, I probably do that too. But, it’s something that has become even easier to recognize and identify since my return to the States.\n\nApparently, the big news of the week on early morning radio talk shows regarded a fight between two elderly women at a Bingo night. And, as the talk show hosts had their laughs, I just felt ashamed of society. The media is typically praised for articulating news, challenging political opinions, and stirring the pot. Think about Meryl Streep’s address at the Golden Globe awards ceremony in 2017. However, what happens when media sources align with the politics of the nation, with the increased ignorance of American society? What happens when unbecoming behavior of our elderly generation becomes the joke of the week? What happens when disrespect toward others becomes an inherent “right?”\n\nAnd, I am proud to be American. I think we have a beautiful country, with a lot of potential, a lot of truly good people, a lot of positives going for us. But, when I saw that someone wrote, ‘Make America Smart Again,’ on a street wall in London’s east end, I had to agree. We are already a great nation, let’s be an informed nation- let’s be an intellectual nation- let’s be better than ignorant.\n\nP.S. I think there are intelligent talk show hosts, students, and moments in this nation. I would be ignorant to think all could fall into one category."
