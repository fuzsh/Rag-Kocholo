        "text": "Canada\n\nThe Iroquois Indians called it Kanata, meaning merely “a group of huts.” You, however, may know it as the land of the fur trapper and the Eskimo, the moose and the polar bear​—and, yes, the “Mounties,” the red-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police ‘who always get their man.’\n\nBut present-day Canada is much more than that. This vast country covering 3,851,809 square miles (9,976,139 square kilometers) is the second largest in the world. It spans North America from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific on the west. Southward lies the United States and to the north, the frigid waters of the Arctic.\n\nWithin the borders of Canada are the towering and majestic Rocky Mountains, thousands of sparkling lakes and rivers, and thundering waters of world-famous Niagara Falls. Also delighting the eye are extensive prairies with their seas of golden grain, and great forests of pine, spruce, maple, fir and birch.\n\nThis is “home” for 23,000,000 people. Because of a relatively liberal immigration policy, among Canada’s populace are found Austrians, Dutch, Germans, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Jews, Latin Americans, Poles, Portuguese, Russians, Scandinavians, Spaniards, Ukrainians, West Indians and Yugoslavians. From Eastern lands have come Arabs, Chinese, East Indians, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans and Pakistanis. Years ago, before the white man settled here, this land was the home of the Eskimo and of many colorful American Indian nations. Happily, a person can still meet some of these people, among them the Crees, Cayugas, Mohawks, Ojibways, Kutanais and Haidas.\n\nIn 1534 the French explorer Cartier came, and in 1604 the first permanent French colony was established in what is now eastern Canada. Late in the 1500’s, the British first came to Newfoundland and the adjacent coasts. Later, the English spread out over what is now Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario. In 1763, Canada became part of the British Empire, though retaining both French and English as official languages. Confederation came in 1867 and equality of status as part of the British Commonwealth in 1931. Presently, Canada consists of 10 provinces and two territories.\n\nThe population is concentrated mainly within a narrow ribbon all along the border shared with the United States, the number of persons per square mile dropping quickly as one moves northward. Most of the land remains unsettled and undeveloped, perhaps only 12 percent of it now being occupied by 90 percent of the population. In part, this is because of a severe winter climate in the northern regions, although summers there are pleasant and bright.\n\nAs you might imagine, with Canada’s many immigrants came their interesting customs and various religions. Here you will find evidences of Buddhism, Islamism, Judaism and Hinduism. But the larger religious groups are the so-called Christian bodies. Roman Catholicism is the largest single denomination, having nearly 10,000,000 members, most of them in the Province of Quebec. The United Church claims more than 3,000,000 adherents, and the Anglicans another 2,500,000. Smaller Protestant bodies, such as Presbyterians and Baptists, as well as Orthodox Catholics, make up a large part of the remaining populace, although many people profess no religion at all.\n\nA GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN THE EAST\n\nIt was in the year 1880, at the latest, that a glimmer of true spiritual light began shining in Canada. From earnest friends and relatives in the United States, some Canadians received literature and a heartening message about the restoration of all things by God’s kingdom in the hands of the glorified Jesus Christ. (Acts 3:19-21; Rev. 21:1-5) One of these thought-provoking publications​—Food for Thinking Christians, published in 1881—​found ready acceptance here. How its forceful exposure of the doctrinal errors taught in Christendom’s churches cleared away false religious cobwebs!\n\nThis “good news” was being proclaimed by Charles T. Russell and a small group of Bible Students with headquarters in Allegheny (now part of Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, U.S.A. What was the caliber of the Canadians responding favorably to the Kingdom message? Well, genuine gratitude for Bible truth is evident in this letter from a man in Ontario (published in the January/​February 1882 Watch Tower):\n\n“Will you kindly advise me in regard to severing my connection with the church of which I am a member? I feel as though I should not attend, because it would be consenting to their teaching, which I do not now believe. I have not really believed it for a long time, but I knew no better way. Now, thank God, it is different. I remain yours in the hope of eternal life.”\n\nOne of the earliest Canadian Bible Students was William Brookman, apparently a former clergyman. Under his direction, a class met regularly in Toronto.\n\nAnother Canadian to accept Bible truth at an early date was Thomas Baker, a sawmill operator of Elba, Ontario, a small community about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Toronto. A very religious man, Baker had been the superintendent of the Anglican Sunday school. But his buzzing sawmill became a place that also buzzed with the grand news of God’s kingdom. As his daughter Annie puts it: “Every customer who came in was given a tract or booklet or book. I don’t think he missed anyone!”\n\nSince Thomas Baker was so well known, his departure from the established church in the community raised plenty of questions. In fact, so many people asked about this that he published a booklet giving the reasons for his action. Baker died in 1906, and the funeral talk was delivered by a person to whom he himself had taught the truth of God’s Word.\n\nDuring the late 1880’s colporteurs (full-time Kingdom proclaimers) shared’ the “good news” with Caleb Crandell. He accepted Bible literature and entertained the visitors in his home at Crandell’s Corners (now within Port Perry), Ontario. No study group was formed there at the time, but we know that Caleb made at least one trip to hear C. T. Russell speak at Massey Hall in Toronto. Crandell was delighted with what he saw and heard. His oft-told story went like this: Several clergymen, invited to the platform to ask questions, became quite annoyed when they were unable to contradict Russell’s sound Biblical answers. Then they all tried to hurl queries at him at the same time. Russell quietly called them to order, asking that they conduct themselves as gentlemen and saying that he would gladly deal with every question. Crandell was impressed to see that the clerics could not refute Russell’s Scriptural arguments. In time, they merely left the platform and disappeared into the crowd without further ado.\n\nBIBLE TRUTH REACHES WESTERN CANADA\n\nThe light of truth was shining somewhat brightly in eastern Canada when a shaft of such light penetrated the spiritual darkness in western Canada. In 1889, William Flewwelling of Carberry, Manitoba, came into possession of “The Divine Plan of the Ages,” the first volume of C. T. Russell’s Millennial Dawn series (later called Studies in the Scriptures). Convinced that he had found the truth, Flewwelling shared it with others, especially after moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1890. One man who listened with appreciation was Robert Pollock. Soon Bible study classes were being held in the Pollock home. To our knowledge, this was the first of such groups on Canada’s west coast.\n\nIn later years, William Flewwelling helped to establish Bible study groups at Asquith (about 20 miles [32 kilometers] west of Saskatoon) and Wadena, Saskatchewan. Later in life (in 1934), he moved to Witchekan, Saskatchewan, and declared the “good news” throughout that part of the province. William died at Chitek Lake in 1945, but many of his relatives continue to carry on the Kingdom-preaching work he began in that area.\n\nOf course, Bible truth reached western Canada by other means, too. In 1889, the same year Flewwelling first learned the truth, a well-meaning man threw a magazine onto a Canadian’s bunk at a typically Western horse sales yard in Fargo, North Dakota. “Here, Mais,” said the man. “This is something that will interest you!” Leslie Mais was there to sell a herd of horses raised at his homestead in Fort Qu’Appelle, Northwest Territories (now Saskatchewan). A member of the Church of England, he was an avid Bible reader and talked to others about what he read in the Scriptures. No wonder the man tossed that magazine onto his bunk! Well, Mais read through that Watch Tower, promptly became a subscriber and continued reading that journal until his death in 1924.\n\nC. T. RUSSELL’S FIRST VISIT TO CANADA\n\nBy 1891, the number of Bible Students in the Toronto area was sufficient to hold the first one-day convention in that city. Then, for the first time, Pastor Russell visited fellow believers in this land. At the morning session on February 22, more than 400 persons listened as he spoke for over two hours. That afternoon about 700 were present for another two-hour talk by Brother Russell. In the evening, he addressed a congregation at the other end of Toronto, returning to the convention site before nine o’clock to participate in a question-and-answer session. It surely was a busy day!\n\nOPPOSITION AS THE PACE QUICKENS\n\nThe pace of spreading the “good news” was quickening in this land. Early in 1891, a colporteur wrote: “While I have been in Canada but a short time, it has been my privilege to see an excellent interest awakened and the harvest work well started here. . . . There are over 5,000 DAWNS [volumes of Millennial Dawn] out in Ontario now, and the work is only well begun.”\n\nBut this activity did not occur without clerical opposition. At least two of Christendom’s ministers in Ontario publicly burned copies of Millennial Dawn and denounced Brother Russell, as well as distributors of the books.\n\nDuring that period, the weekly Niagara Falls Review was carrying C. T. Russell’s sermons. The newspaper’s editor was Brother James E. Anger, who admitted: “I had [by 1892] succeeded in bringing upon myself a boycott from the hackmen, the Sabbath Desecrators, the hotel men, the R[oman] C[atholic] Church and the Protestant churches in town.” He finally had to sell the newspaper. But Brother Anger’s descendants are active witnesses of Jehovah to this day, and we can count some 20 spiritually prosperous Christian congregations in that part of the Niagara peninsula.\n\nDespite clerical and other opposition in the early 1890’s, some clergymen and former clerics were getting Scriptural matters straight in their minds. Moreover, they were seeing their responsibility to teach others the truth found in the Bible. One of these men, John L. Lawson, wrote to Brother Russell in 1892, saying:\n\n“The Lord has been preparing me for years for these Millennial truths. In 1874 I left [resigned from] the Primitive Methodist ministry in England, where I had been for nine years . . . Since then I have been led to the study of prophecy; and your volumes afford me a richness, a fullness, in this branch of study, beyond anything I have before seen. Reading them is indeed to me as sitting down to a banquet of ‘meat in due season’​—predicted truths on becoming due being just this to the household of faith. . . .\n\n“I wish I could be of help to the watchful, consecrated ones; but here in the [Canadian] bush am afraid I cannot do much. I would like to know what the arrangements of the [Society are] with colporteurs and whether they know of any field where there is urgent need of such.”\n\nAs more and more people learned God’s truth and saw the urgent need to declare it to others, the pace of Kingdom activity continued to accelerate. Bible Student classes were developing in one place after another. For instance, 1892 saw the start of Christian meetings held at Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nMatthew Nelson of Carberry, Manitoba, first heard and accepted the Kingdom message in that year. In 1893, Nelson moved to Grandview, Manitoba, and planted seeds of Bible truth there. It was not uncommon for him to drive a wagon 15 miles (24 kilometers) one way on unpaved roads just to reach someone who might be interested! That was not easy on muddy roads. In Nelson’s own family, his mother, his sisters and some relatives through marriage all favorably responded to his efforts. On November 22, 1914, the first congregation was established in Grandview, and Brother Nelson was privileged to have oversight. This very active “spark plug” (as Matthew Nelson was affectionately called by local Bible Students) was very encouraging to all his Christian associates until his death in 1945.\n\nGETTING STARTED IN THE MARITIMES\n\nAmong those learning the truth around 1892 were Arthur N. Marchant and W. T. Dowden of Halifax, Nova Scotia. They also learned that Christians do something. They live the “good news” and they talk about it. Determined Marchant promptly became a colporteur, absolutely convinced that no work was more important than declaring the “good news.” As early as 1895, he engaged in systematic witnessing and frequent coverage all the Maritime Provinces, including Prince Edward Island, thus laying a foundation for excellent future development there.\n\nArthur Marchant aided interested ones spiritually by establishing study groups and by training some to give a witness to others. He also baptized those desiring to take that important step.\n\nRemember that this work was not carried on with the comfort, convenience and ease of present-day travel. Often Brother Marchant walked many miles. At times he rode a bicycle, and in winter he might use an automobile, if one was available​—but that was before the advent of car heaters. Ella Dow recalls an occasion when Marchant was driving an open auto. He arrived at her place in the rurals “chilled to the bone,” she says, adding: “I had to rub liniment on his legs and stick them in the open oven to get some warmth back into them!”\n\nBrother Marchant never wavered with the passing of the years. Once, during the first world war, he was arrested in Halifax for distributing the book “The Finished Mystery.” His bail was set at $10,000! When the judge asked what his occupation was, he unhesitatingly replied, “A minister of the Most High God!” Arthur N. Marchant completed his course faithfully on May 23, 1940. But what a tremendous work he had done in nearly 50 years of disciple-making! Today in the 51,000-square-mile (132,000-square-kilometer) area that he covered so diligently there are more than 80 congregations and over 4,500 active witnesses of Jehovah.\n\n“LIKE A BURNING FIRE”\n\nMention of the Maritimes calls to mind a Canadian to whom God’s word eventually proved to be “like a burning fire.” (Jer. 20:9) He just had to talk about it. Born in Canada on July 2, 1877, he was reared by Presbyterian parents in a Catholic community in Nova Scotia. His name? Alexander Hugh Macmillan.\n\nOnly about 13 years old when his younger sister died of diphtheria, youthful Macmillan reasoned: “Life is short and uncertain. If what we do here has any bearing on what we will be hereafter, then we would be very foolish if we didn’t devote our time to serving the Lord now with the hope of having something better throughout eternity. As for me, I’m going to take my stand and do what I think will be pleasing to the Lord.”\n\nAt 16, Macmillan decided to become a preacher. Off he went to a school away from home, there to prepare for admittance to a theological seminary. But then, for some reason, he had a nervous breakdown. Nearly brokenhearted, Macmillan returned home. Considerately, his father provided funds and soon the young man was on his way to Boston, Massachusetts. There he obtained a copy of C. T. Russell’s book “The Plan of the Ages” (or “The Divine Plan of the Ages”). The truths it contained became “like a burning fire” within Macmillan. Unable to contain himself, he went out on the street and stopped people to tell them what he had learned.\n\nOne day, Macmillan approached a total stranger and asked: “Do you know about the great promise God made to Abraham, that through his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed?” Startled, the man replied: “What Abraham are you talking about?​—the Abraham that has that pawnshop down on Salem Street?”\n\nWell, at least Macmillan was reaching out for his youthful goal​—that of becoming a preacher. In September 1900, this earnest Canadian was baptized in symbol of his dedication to Jehovah God. During succeeding years he traveled far and wide declaring the “good news,” visiting congregations and upbuilding fellow believers spiritually. He finished his earthly course in faithfulness as a member of the Brooklyn Bethel family, succumbing at the age of 89 on August 26, 1966.\n\nUPBUILDING “PILGRIM” VISITS\n\nA. H. Macmillan had been a close associate of C. T. Russell, and both of them showed deep concern for fellow worshipers of Jehovah. Russell had been visiting numerous Canadian groups of Bible Students during one-day conventions, but new congregations, or classes, were being established in many places and no longer was it possible for him to visit all of them. Yet, such visits, the talks delivered and the good association did much to strengthen God’s people spiritually. Hence, the September 1, 1894, Watch Tower announced that a number of capable appointed brothers would be visiting the congregations. Later, this service, rendered by traveling representatives of the Watch Tower Society, was called the “Pilgrim” work. What was a typical day like during a pilgrim visit? Some idea can be gleaned from this letter to Brother Russell:\n\n“Brother [George] Draper has come and gone. . . . Our meetings were not large, but I feel safe in saying that there was an intense interest depicted on each countenance, and that all our little gathering and a few from outside were deeply impressed with all the meetings, which were held in our new hall [in Toronto].\n\n“On Sunday morning, at 10:30, about forty assembled at Balmy Beach . . . to witness the symbol of baptism in water. The morning was bright, cool, and very windy, causing quite a heavy rolling surf, which rather added to the interest of the occasion. Four sisters and five brothers were [baptized] . . . Our little party was indeed a happy, joyous little band as we returned home, to assemble again at our hall at 3 P.M., and listen to our dear Brother Draper pour forth more of the precious things from the Holy Word.\n\n“At 7 P.M. our last meeting commenced, there being 88 or 90 in the hall, quite a number of the friends and acquaintances of the dear brothers and sisters being present . . . and about 9:30 our feast of fat things came to an end for the time, and I think it would have been difficult to picture a more happy lot of faces than all wore; all were overjoyed at the precious things they had heard.”\n\nBy 1905, William Hersee of Hamilton, Ontario, was able to arrange his affairs to enter the pilgrim work. Although he was financially comfortable and could have remained in Hamilton, Hersee soon became a familiar figure to many as he traveled across North America, serving for many years as a pilgrim here and in the United States.\n\nBrother Hersee, who had been baptized in 1893 at London, Ontario, was short in physical stature, but impressive in bearing. Especially in later years did his white hair enhance a kindly disposition that was reflected, partly, in his paying special attention to children and other young persons. One who was a mere boy at that time recalls:\n\n“After he had finished his supper, Brother Hersee took my brother Joe and me out into the fields for an evening walk. We sat down for a while with our backs against a post looking out over the ploughed fields toward the setting prairie sun. Anyone having seen the sun going down on the prairie would appreciate the scene that was before us: the blue of the sky above with the horizon now a crimson red with streaks of orange glow stretching far into the sky as the sun, brilliant in all its color like a big ball of fire, slowly sank out of sight. Around us in the trees were the night sounds of birds settling down to rest, and off in the pasture to our right, horses snorted as they cropped away at the grass. What a beautiful setting in which to discuss God’s creations and his kingdom with this quiet, devoted man! It was an occasion that I will never forget.”\n\nIt is no wonder that till this day, as much as 50 years after Brother Hersee visited their homes, some still recall him with fondness and appreciation for his ministry. Especially in his prayers his depth of spirituality impressed young and old alike. One couple remarks: “He was a great source of encouragement to both of us. His prayers were indeed a stimulus, as he seemed to carry you right into the very courts of heaven itself.”\n\nWilliam Hersee served Jehovah​—and fellow worshipers of the true God—​faithfully for a half century. The end of his Christian course and service on earth came in 1943. It is easy to see how the humble, godly efforts of such pilgrims of the past would spiritually strengthen their brothers and sisters in the faith.\n\nMORE LIGHT IN MANITOBA\n\nThe grand message about ‘the restoration of all things’ first reached Rapid City, Manitoba, in 1898. (Acts 3:19-21) Colporteur Geoffrey Webb then appeared on the scene there and witnessed to businessmen gathered around the potbellied stove at the back of A. W. Leflar’s general store. For some time, staunch Anglican Bowen Smith, who ran the local lumberyard, contradicted Webb’s remarks. But Smith eventually became convinced, and, with Leflar and several others, organized the first class of Bible Students in that part of Canada.\n\nLeflar put his heart into the work of teaching others. Traveling by horse and buggy, enthusiastically he witnessed in much of the surrounding territory. When C. T. Russell visited and gave talks in that area, Leflar’s horse and buggy came in handy. Why, even now it takes but a little imagination to visualize the driver and his visitor riding in that horse-drawn carriage as they traveled from place to place over those vast prairies!\n\nAs the years passed, the Leflar homesite became the center of Christian activities in that part of Canada. It was the stopping place for many colporteurs and pilgrims. Small conventions were held there. When a congregation was formed, A. W. Leflar became the first overseer. However, none of his activities, or those of the area’s other Bible Students, took place without sacrifice and the enduring of opposition. People expressed contempt and hatred for “the Russellites,” as they called them, and this made the Christian course a hard one. Nevertheless, persecution was endured, and Brother Leflar served faithfully until his death in 1946.\n\nTHE TRUTH TAKES HOLD IN ALBERTA\n\nChristian determination and a similar spirit of self-sacrifice also resulted in Jehovah’s blessing at Calmar, Alberta. In 1895, Bible Student August Dahlquist arrived there from North Dakota. He was followed by a Scandinavian “flood” in 1899, as families with such names as Anderson, Engberg, Hammer, Melin and Peterson came to Calmar from the vicinity of De Lamere, North Dakota. These families already were active Bible Students when they left the United States.\n\nOne of these pioneering families was that of Knud Pederson Hammer. He had been an ordained Baptist minister in North Dakota when A. H. Macmillan placed a book with him back in 1890. According to one of Hammer’s descendants, that Baptist preacher “soon came to recognize that it contained the truth. As a result, in 1891 K. P. Hammer stood up in the church and informed the congregation that he, his wife and their babe in arms were walking out of ‘Babylon.’ They left with their infant daughter, Hannah, never to return to the realm of false religion.”\n\nIn 1892 Brother Hammer visited his hometown of Skien, Norway. Because of that visit, his mother and sister manifested interest in the Kingdom message.\n\nProviding some later details, a descendant of Brother Hammer reports: According to plan, in 1899 a group of 50 persons hired a railroad coach. They were planning to go to the Calmar area together. Here, then, was an organized group of Bible Students about to embark on a new life in a new country. At the time that the coach was about to leave, K. P. Hammer received an invitation from Charles Taze Russell to go to Norway as the Society’s representative and to form the first congregation there. After discussing the matter with the brothers, it was decided that Hammer should accept the invitation from Russell.”\n\nBrother Hammer’s family went on to Calmar in the care of other Bible Students, while he traveled to Norway. Although he met certain interested persons while there, no congregation was established. What situation did he find upon returning to his family? The previously cited report continues:\n\n“A pleasant surprise awaited K. P. Hammer upon his return. John Frederickson, a master log worker and builder, had, with the aid of the other brothers, erected a fine cabin on Hammer’s homestead. This was but one of the many acts of love and kindness that the brothers showed to each other in the early days.”​—John 13:35.\n\nSpiritual things came first among those Bible Students at Calmar, among whom was Andrew Melin. His son recalls: Every time we got our mail . . . we would spend the evening around the table with only a coal oil lamp for light, and we would listen to dad read our copy of the Watch Tower. It came in the English language to begin with, but later we got it in Swedish and then mother could understand it as well.”\n\nOn foot or by horseback, the Melins, John Frederickson and K. P. Hammer witnessed extensively, working with volumes of Millennial Dawn. There were not many places where these witnesses of Jehovah were not well known in the Calmar district. It was not that they had a lot of time on their hands. They were in homesteading country and had to work hard to clear the land (at least 20 acres [8 hectares] to obtain title), using horses, oxen and their bare hands. Most of their food had to be grown at the same time. Eventually, some of these Bible Student families included as many as 13 children. So, to earn money for necessary purchases, these brothers accepted any extra work that came along, even at 35 cents a day! Yes, they were self-sacrificing, loving, diligent, faithful​—and so Jehovah blessed them richly.\n\nAs those Christian families grew, and more newly interested persons associated with them, a log-cabin meeting place was built at Calmar. The good spiritual foundations laid in those days have resulted in many loyal witnesses of Jehovah, and the family names of those early Bible Students now are familiar all over western Canada. Also, there is still an active Christian congregation at Calmar.\n\nA NEW CENTURY DAWNS\n\nIt is not possible to mention the early developments in every place or to name all the individuals and families serving Jehovah at that time. Yet, it was evident that God was blessing his people. For instance, the report for observances of the Lord’s Evening Meal in 1899 showed that there were quite a few small but growing groups. That year in Ontario, attendances were as follows: Brantford 22, Dorchester 5, Goderich 4, Hamilton 10, London 7, Meaford 5, Niagara Falls 7 and Toronto 21. Memorial attendances in Manitoba were: Brandon 8, Clive 4 and Rapid City 10. Reports from other areas included Wharnock, British Columbia, 5; Regina, Northwest Territories (now Saskatchewan), 7; and Truro, Nova Scotia, 8. Other groups also met that year to commemorate Christ’s death.\n\nTruly, then, as a new century dawned, the work of announcing the restoration of all things by God’s kingdom was becoming established across Canada. To strengthen the growing groups of Bible Students, pilgrims continued visiting their fellow believers, and spiritually upbuilding conventions were held regularly in various places.\n\nSo it was that, here and there, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Baptists and others​—sometimes leading figures in those organizations—​courageously were abandoning false religion. (Rev. 18:1-4) Spontaneously, such individuals were making known to others the Bible truths they themselves were learning.\n\nGROWTH DESPITE OPPOSITION\n\nExpansion surely was under way. For instance, the growth of Bible Students’ classes in various places meant not just gathering for study in private homes, but renting halls for meetings on Sundays. Of course, such expansion brought opposition. Bent on counteracting the growth and influence of Jehovah’s people, some religious critics at times went too far. For instance, consider what happened at Nashwaak, New Brunswick, in 1904, as related by Cecil Scott.\n\nLumberman Hezekiah London, a religious person, had built a church on the corner of the family farm. His seven daughters all sang in the choir. By mail one day, London received some literature from a friend in Connecticut who was a Bible Student. After reading these publications, Hezekiah wrote to the “Bible House” in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and received more literature. Shortly after reading it, he was surprised one Sunday when the local clergyman spoke on “The International Bible Students and Pastor Russell.” Not only was the sermon derogatory; it was the farthest thing from the truth. About halfway through it, London stood up, took his wife by the hand, and told his daughters in the choir: “Come on, girls. We’re going home.” All nine walked out. Since Hezekiah London had donated the building and was the financial mainstay of the church, that congregation soon “fell apart.” The preacher left and the building was closed.\n\nShortly thereafter, Hezekiah London made arrangements for pilgrims to visit Nashwaak. For a few weeks prior to the arrival of a pilgrim (about twice a year), London would leave home by horse and buggy on a Monday morning and would not return until Saturday. During such an excursion, he would place tracts and booklets with the people for many miles around and would invite them to the talks to be given by the visiting pilgrim. And the meeting place? You are right! It was that former church building on the London farm at Nashwaak, New Brunswick. Today, as many as 30 of Hezekiah London’s relatives are Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nShortly after the turn of the century, congregations of God’s people were growing in various places. However, in some parts of Canada the situation was still as it had been in the larger communities a decade or more earlier. For example, there were areas in Manitoba where solitary individuals had accepted Bible truth but lacked close association with other Christians and rarely received pilgrim visits. Nevertheless, these persons stood firm, and Jehovah sustained them spiritually.\n\nMrs. John Sample, who lived near Souris, Manitoba, illustrates this point. She had been in possession of our literature since 1897 and had taken magazines from one John Kerslake, but had tried to stay with the church and teach in local Sunday schools. In 1903 the day came for a break to be made. She stood up in church and told all present why she had to separate from Christendom. Her nearest neighbor tried to get her back to church, and preachers were brought into action. But all of this was to no avail. She stood firm. Later, the neighbor, a Mrs. Nay, also accepted the truth. But so much had to be done alone. This is how Sister Sample’s son, John, described her situation in those early days: “No congregation servant [presiding overseer]. No study servant to lean on. No meetings. A contrite heart. A worn Bible. Long prayerful hours.”\n\nTHE “GOOD NEWS” CONTINUES ATTRACTING THE HONEST HEARTED\n\nPeople with honest hearts, a desire to please God, and a determination to serve him in the face of all odds continued to manifest themselves. Among such persons was a former army captain, William Meneray. In 1906, while cleaning out a telegraph office in Souris, Manitoba, just before returning to his home in Winnipeg, he found some Watch Tower magazines dating from 1893 and 1894. Although they were quite old, he took them along. Meneray’s wife read some of the journals and recommended them to her husband. The first article he read was a reprint of a Watch Tower Society booklet on hell. Well, that was a start. Meneray immediately wrote to the Society’s offices asking if there were any individuals in Winnipeg who shared these beliefs. He was given the names of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald Taylor and Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton. Prior to 1906, there had been some association of those who believed these things. In fact, pilgrim visits to Winnipeg were listed in the Watch Tower as early as 1901, and in 1905 it published a letter, likely from Frances Hamilton, telling about observance of the Memorial by her husband and herself. But it appears that the first organized congregation in Winnipeg began functioning in 1905 or 1906.\n\nNot content to witness only in his own district, Meneray established quite a mailing service. By that means, he reached isolated people with tracts and booklets. These had such catchy titles as Thieves in Paradise and What Is the Soul? Some of this literature was sent clear to the Yukon. George Naish reported that interest also was aroused among the Carments and Rainbows at Kamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWilliam Meneray once made a world tour with C. T. Russell and other Bible Students, a journey that made clear the tremendous need for worldwide witnessing. Brother Meneray’s faithful course was maintained to the last day of his life on earth, January 21, 1960.\n\nIn 1911 Charles Cutforth of Gilbert Plains, Manitoba, became active as a witness of Jehovah. His brother, H. W. Cutforth, also became interested. The H. W. Cutforth home became the local meeting place of the Bible Students. In time, Charles Cutforth became a colporteur and traveling representative of the Watch Tower Society. His son, John, became a pioneer (1941), served as a traveling overseer (1942) and became a member of the Society’s branch office staff at Toronto (1943). He attended the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead in 1946 and was sent to Australia. There John Cutforth served as a circuit and district overseer. Later, he was sent to Papua New Guinea, where he is still serving faithfully.\n\nJames Gibson of Haliburton, Ontario, was another honest-hearted man who recognized God’s truth in the writings of C. T. Russell. That was in 1907, when he received this literature from James and Alexander Brown, his wife’s relatives at New Liskeard, Ontario. However, his wife, Margaret, did not see those publications in the right light at the time. After Brother Gibson died in 1908, though, she went to visit the Browns for six weeks. When Margaret Gibson returned, “she had a firm hold on the truth and could think or talk of nothing else,” reports her granddaughter, who also says:\n\n“Until her death in 1929, my grandmother would hardly let a day go by without either writing or talking the truth to someone. In the early days in Haliburton, she would travel to her calls by horse and buggy. As she had been an early settler in the vicinity of Haliburton and a zealous worker in the church, she knew everyone in the surrounding area. The way she did her witnessing reminded one of the early Christians, for she would pack a bag with her books and the necessities, hitch up the horse and buggy and go to one of her friends or neighbors, announcing when she arrived that she had come to stay with them until they understood her message. If she could get a hearing ear, she would stay two or three days, and pore over the Scriptures with them, even by lamplight until late at night. By her carrying on the work in this manner, many families were quickly able to see the truth.\n\nBy 1911, the Toronto congregation was up to 110 persons present for the Memorial. Other classes, as they were often called, were growing, too. As many as 108 classes across Canada were visited by pilgrims in that year. The Vancouver group was having good success with Sunday evening lectures in Pender Hall. Samuel Withers (who died on March 9, 1971, at 96) was just then beginning to associate with Jehovah’s people. His heart certainly was touched by the truth. So impressed was he with the material in “The Divine Plan of the Ages” that he sat up three nights virtually “devouring” it. On the third night, his wife awoke and asked, “What have you got, to keep you saying ‘Praise the Lord’ so many times at three o’clock in the morning?” Obviously, he was grateful to have his many questions answered.\n\nDETERMINED TO DECLARE THE KINGDOM MESSAGE\n\nThose who gained knowledge of Bible truth were eager to share the good news of the Kingdom with others. As but one example, it was during the year 1912 that Julius W. Lundell made his decision to do something about his contacts with the message proclaimed by the Bible Students. His daughter, Olive Mais, fills in some details, saying:\n\n“Julius W. Lundell first heard of the truth in 1903. He was teaching Sunday school in a ‘Free Mission’ church in North Dakota when a fellow teacher told him he had heard a lecture proving from the Bible that there is no hell. Then in 1910 my father came to northern Saskatchewan as a pioneer settler to a homestead 20 miles [32 kilometers] north of the village of Maidstone. One day a neighbor loaned him a book on the subject of evolution. Tucked inside was a booklet on the subject What Say the Scriptures About Hell? Here was proof of what his friend had told him.\n\n“Two years later an advertisement appeared in the Winnipeg Free Press, inserted by Brother Meneray. It asked the question: ‘Do you know that the Gentile Times will end in the year 1914?’ [Luke 21:24, Authorized Version] My father sent for literature, and, when Studies in the Scriptures arrived in the mail, he read night and day for a week without letup. By kerosine lamp, he continued reading far into the night. At the end of the week, he knew he had found the truth. With his books and the Bible under his arm, he walked to his neighbors’ homes to tell them the good news. Their reaction was: ‘Lundell has gone mad!’”\n\nBut that was far from true, and it was only the beginning of Brother Lundell’s active service to Jehovah. His daughter’s account continues: ‘Completely convinced of the truth, my father ordered and placed cartons of literature in those years . . . Then, in 1917, Brother Andrew Melin from Calmar, Alberta, made a trip to various Swedish settlements to give Bible lectures. Thus he came to our community, Milleton, and was the first to give my father help in organizing his activity. Before long, my father’s picture was on advertising material and he was giving talks in all the nearby community schools and halls north and south of the Saskatchewan River.”\n\nYet, the giving of Bible talks was not all there was to declaring the Kingdom message. When traveling, Brother Lundell always carried a suitcase full of Bible literature. His daughter adds: “Whether at an auction sale or at the Lloydminster Fair, you could always count on finding Dad at the car, a group of men standing or sitting around and a big discussion going on. When it was time to go home, the suitcase was empty of the literature it had carried. Once, when we were stuck in a mudhole and a man with a pair of mules came along, his pay came out of the brown suitcase. At a Greek restaurant in North Battleford, a discussion that began with the owner soon involved everyone in the dining area and, at the end of it, again the suitcase was emptied.”\n\nCertainly, this kind of determination to make the Kingdom message known to others was commendable. Because of such an excellent spirit on the part of God’s people, fine work was being done in declaring the “good news.” Hence, the first decade of the 1900’s ended with a marked increase in the number of true worshipers in most parts of Canada. Growth then was evident in all the provinces, and in good numbers in some of them. And similar progress was being made during the second decade of the twentieth century. But it also proved to be a period that tested the faith of these sincere Bible Students.\n\nCLERICS LASH OUT!\n\nOne of the earliest congregations of Jehovah’s people to be established in Canada was the one at Hamilton, Ontario. That strong, very active congregation naturally had the disapproval of the clergy. Not having any Biblical defense against the forceful thrusts of the truth, the clerics resorted to personal invective. They lashed out in a seemingly desperate attempt to destroy one man​—C. T. Russell.\n\nA clergyman who used this approach at Hamilton was a bombastic Baptist preacher named J. J. Ross. In 1912, he wrote a scurrilous pamphlet in which he made many false accusations against Russell. Acting on the advice of his legal counselor, J. F. Rutherford, Brother Russell laid a criminal charge of defamatory libel against Ross. As the complainant, Russell attended the trial to give evidence, and he submitted to a long cross-examination of roughly five hours. After the trial, his Baptist opponent falsely charged that Russell had committed perjury when asked about his knowledge of Greek. This “perjury” charge was published in Ross’ second pamphlet attacking Russell. In it the cleric misquoted what had been said in court, giving the cross-examiner’s question and Russell’s reply as follows:\n\nQ. “Do you know the Greek?”\n\nA. “Oh, yes.”\n\nBy omitting the word “alphabet” from this question, Ross sought to establish an exact contradiction with a later question and answer:\n\nQ. “Are you familiar with the Greek language?”\n\nA. “No.”\n\nWhat really happened is clear from the official record (Police Court of the City of Hamilton, Ontario, March 17, 1913). It shows that C. T. Russell did not commit perjury. The cross-examination (by George Lynch-Staunton, K. C.) went as follows, according to the book Jehovah’s Witnesses in Canada, by M. James Penton:\n\n“Question: ‘You don’t profess, then, to be schooled in the Latin language?’\n\nAnswer: ‘No, Sir.’\n\nQuestion: ‘Or in Greek?’\n\nAnswer: ‘No, Sir.’”\n\nAfter this, Russell was asked if he knew individual Greek letters, and he said that he “might make a mistake of some of them.” According to the book just cited, shortly thereafter “Lynch-Staunton asked Russell the question: ‘Are you familiar with the Greek language?’ Russell’s reply was an emphatic ‘No.’”\n\nSo, there was no question about matters. C. T. Russell had not committed perjury as Ross falsely charged after the trial. The case itself later went before a grand jury, which declined to return a bill of indictment. So, the case never went on for trial before the Supreme Court of Ontario. Under legal practice in Ontario, only the crown attorney is allowed to speak before the grand jury. We do not know how the case was presented to it or what caused that body to reject it. No decision ever was rendered on the merits of the case. In his subsequent writings, Ross treated this inconclusive result as though he had won a great victory. He and others apparently chose to forget that Russell was not the man on trial.\n\nUNDISTURBED BY THE ANTICS OF OPPOSERS\n\nDespite the hatred of Christendom’s clergy, Jehovah’s people remained undisturbed. In 1923 they held a series of conventions, and these were very successful gatherings. For instance, about 1,000 persons attended the convention in Victoria, British Columbia, and some 4,500 were present for the one in Vancouver. This series of assemblies covered the larger centers of the West before moving on to the week-long gathering at Toronto. There the audience numbered around 1,200, with about half of the delegates coming from the United States.\n\nOver 200 delegates traveled with C. T. Russell from one convention to another. One press report announced the arrival of the special convention train in Edmonton, Alberta, and then said:\n\n“When asked about the charge that he is a ‘no hell’ preacher, Pastor Russell replied:\n\n“‘There is no minister in the world that preaches more hell than I do, but the hell that I preach is the hell of the Bible and not the hell of the fire, brimstone, pitchfork and sandpaper-slide variety. The hell of the Bible is a most reasonable interpretation of the original Greek and Hebrew terms​—Hades and Sheol—​which means the death state, the tomb.’”\n\nConcerning the later 1913 Toronto assembly, The Watch Tower said: “Some attended this convention largely because they perceived that an evil spirit of slander and misrepresentation was for some reason endeavoring to do injury to a religious work. Satan and his blinded and misguided servants overdo in their endeavors to injure the Lord’s cause. Sometimes the Lord overrules the wrath of man for his own praise and for the forwarding of the truth. As for instance, in the case of a man who, being told that Pastor Russell was Antichrist, went to see what Antichrist might look like. Hearing the joyful message of the Gospel, his heart was captured and now he rejoices.”\n\nAt the Toronto convention, some opposers went so far as to come on the grounds with a large banner on which there appeared, disparaging matter including the prominent wording ‘Russellism, Millennial Dawnism, Doctrine of Devils.” But the police made them move on. According to the Toronto News (of July 25, 1913), during that week “the activities of the Toronto anti-Russellites” had not been confined only to that city, for the newspaper said: “Anti-Russell literature has been sent all over the world to different secretaries of that movement, according to Mr. Philip Sidersky of Baltimore, a member of the National Federation of Gospel Missions.” But the News carried a headline indicating that the Bible Students were “not disturbed” by the antics of opposers.\n\nSPIRITUAL HUNGER SATISFIED\n\nOne person who attended the 1913 Toronto convention was Tassey Raycove. In Macedonia, he had been the chanter in the local Orthodox church. He also cleaned the church building, which gave him opportunity to read the Bible kept there, but which the priest never used. Reading the Scriptures created in Raycove a hunger for truth that kept gnawing at him after he moved to Canada. Here he had opportunity to investigate several religions. But, one after another, they failed to satisfy him. He was the head elder of a Bulgarian Baptist group in 1913 when Brother Russell attended the convention in Toronto that religious opposers had tried so hard to disrupt. Tassey Raycove’s son, Anthony, reports:\n\n“The news of this visit was greeted with anger and contempt by Toronto’s Babylonish religionists, who said, ‘That devil Russell is coming to town on Sunday.’ My father echoed the words, but under his breath said: ‘I am going to hear him just the same.’ And this was the turning point in his life because, for the first time, he now heard the soul-satisfying message that the sheep recognize as the voice of the Fine Shepherd.”\n\nAfter listening to Russell’s two-hour talk on the soul, Raycove obtained and avidly read a volume of Studies in the Scriptures. He then sent away for the other volumes and read them with the same avidity. “The search for truth was now, at last, ended,” his son states, adding: “Then came his dramatic break with Babylon the Great. The minister was giving one of his usual hellfire and brimstone sermons when he made the intentional, but ‘fatal,’ mistake of misquoting a text of Scripture. The head elder leaped to his feet, flatly contradicted the minister’s statement and severely censured him for misquoting the scripture.” There ensued a brief but hot debate that resulted in many members having their eyes opened.\n\nA HAPPY SLAVE OF JEHOVAH GETS HIS START\n\nIt was during the second decade of the twentieth century that Thomas James Sullivan began his faithful service as a joyful slave of Jehovah. While working in Brooklyn, New York, in 1911, Sullivan heard an associate say that Pastor Russell did not believe in hell. That statement made an impression because T. J. Sullivan never had been able to reconcile the doctrine of eternal torment with the God of love. (1 John 4:8) However, the young man heard nothing more about these beliefs until 1913.\n\nIn November of that year, Sullivan was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, helping to install an auditing system for a chain of hotels that were being built by the railways. The staff included a young lady who always had a Bible with her, and on display in her office were six volumes of Studies in the Scriptures by Pastor Russell. She was so well versed in the Bible that even the management referred many Scriptural questions to her. But why not let T. J. Sullivan continue the story? Some years ago, he wrote:\n\n“Sometimes it was necessary for us to work until midnight or later. Since transportation arteries closed down about midnight and she had a long walk home, I volunteered to escort her. These walks provided opportunity to discuss the Bible further, and the setting for this was indeed inspiring. To appreciate this, one must know the great open prairie lands of the Northwest. The temperature was generally between 20 and 40 degrees below zero at that time of night. Snow was piled up on each side of the walk three to five feet high. A cold, clear, blue sky overhead and the northern lights or aurora borealis sweeping across the heavens emphasized the grandeur and majesty of God’s creation. Talking about God’s purposes under those conditions was to me very impressive and sacred. It seemed to call on everything within me to reach out for the love and care of such a wonderful Creator.”\n\nT. J. Sullivan did reach out for that divine love and care. He began associating with the Bible Students in Winnipeg and was baptized as a dedicated servant of Jehovah prior to the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal in 1916. It might be added that in September 1918 Brother Sullivan married Sister Evelyn Finch, the first witness of Jehovah he had met on arrival in Canada and the young lady who had done so much to assist him in coming to a knowledge of God’s purposes.\n\nIn 1924, Brother and Sister Sullivan became members of the Brooklyn Bethel family. Both of them served there faithfully for the rest of their earthly lives. T. J. Sullivan was a happy and faithful slave of Jehovah at Bethel (eventually as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses) until his death on July 30, 1974, at the age of 86.\n\n“THE APPOINTED TIMES OF THE NATIONS” ARE FULFILLED!\n\nAnticipation ran high with the coming of the eagerly awaited year 1914! Some were expecting more than what C. T. Russell or The Watch Tower had forecast. There had been considerable speculation, and failure of some of these personal hopes to materialize could lead to disappointment, especially on the part of those not spiritually mature. But most of those who were mature could see that this very thing might happen. Late in 1913, one Canadian with good insight wrote to the Society:\n\n“Although our heavenly Father sees fit to try the faith of his people along various lines, yet it seems that during the coming year we may meet a more severe testing of our confidence in God and his Word.\n\n“I am aware, however, that the faith of the dear brethren and sisters is very strong, and believe they will continue to fight the good fight of faith successfully to the end.\n\n“Pastor Russell, as I have always understood him, never claimed his interpretation of the time prophecies to be infallible. His writings have always impressed me that way.\n\n“Should the year 1915 come and not witness all that many of the brethren expect, it will matter but little to me. We know still that ‘Thy Word is truth,’ and that not one jot or tittle will pass till all be fulfilled. We know further that, according to the signs of the times, the Day is not far distant.\n\n“When fiery trials assail us, let us remember the words of inspiration, ‘Cast not away, therefore, your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.’”\n\nIndeed, in the very issue of The Watch Tower carrying this letter, the leading article pointed out that not all that was expected to happen in the way of swift and radical changes might occur in one year. But it said, “the Year 1914 is the last one of what the Bible terms ‘Gentile Times.’” (Luke 21:24, Authorized Version) The article also stated: “It is beyond the power of our imagination to picture an accomplishment in one year of all that the Scriptures seem to imply should be expected before the reign of peace is ushered in.”\n\nSome congregations were quite large by 1914. Toronto had an attendance of 204 at the Memorial that year. Vancouver had 195 and Winnipeg, 105. But it would be seen just who were attached to a date, as it were, and who were serving Jehovah out of love.\n\nTHE PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION\n\nPersons who were busy making disciples and who were not just ‘watching the clock’ found those to be exciting times. Among the things that aided them to reach many with the “good news” was the audiovisual production that became ‘the talk of the town’ in its day. Called the “Photo-Drama of Creation,” it consisted of photographic slides and motion-picture film accompanied by phonograph recordings of talks and music. All its colored slides and films had to be hand painted. The Photo-Drama was eight hours long, and, four installments, took audiences from creation, through human history, and on to the climax of Jehovah’s purpose for the earth and mankind at the end the millennial reign of Jesus Christ.\n\nAn eight-hour spectacular with sound and color in 1914? Who produced it? One of Hollywood’s “greats”? No. The Photo-Drama was produced by the International Bible Students Association. All seats were free and never was a collection taken. Moreover, this color and sound production packed with Biblical, scientific and historical facts came on the scene years before commercial all-color, feature-length motion pictures and those with recorded dialogue and music were seen by audiences in general.\n\nThe quality of the Photo-Drama photography and sound was so good that some viewers thought C. T. Russell was present in person when he appeared on the screen in the opening scene to introduce the presentation. How vivid and touching the portrayal of the resurrection of the widow’s son, a miracle performed by God through the prophet Elijah! And what a delight to see the opening of a flower and the hatching of a chick! Yes, the use of time-lapse photography made possible these memorable features of the Photo-Drama.\n\nLocal congregations advertised the Photo-Drama and invited the public. Some signs placed on buildings were 11 by 14 feet (3.4 x 4.3 meters) in size. The response was amazing. Theaters were jammed week after week.\n\nIn Hamilton, the Photo-Drama was presented for three weeks in the Grand Opera House, and in Toronto at the Grand Theatre. As crowds were leaving one of the sessions, they heard, for the first time, the shocking news that war had been declared in Europe. This must have indelibly impressed on their minds some of the points just covered in the presentation they had seen and heard. At that time in Toronto the Photo-Drama was also shown at Central Prison (later moved to Kingston).\n\nAmong the approaches used to make sure that as many persons as possible saw the Photo-Drama was the inviting of schoolchildren to showings of it. For instance, in 1914 pupils were let out of school for this purpose in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The same thing was done in Victoria, British Columbia, several classes attending there. Charles W. Forbes, 14 years old at the time, saw the Photo-Drama in that way and eventually became a Bible Student. He never forgot what he saw, and tells us: “The theater being crowded, along with others I had to stand up. But the handiwork of the Great Creator, particularly as shown in the immense starry dome of the heavens, was well worth seeing and showed forth what an all-powerful God had produced.”\n\nEfforts were made to reach Canada’s Poles and Ukrainians with the Photo-Drama. There were showings in the large centers like Toronto and Winnipeg, as well as other places in the West. Translations of the script and of the recordings were made into Polish and Ukrainian.\n\nThe beauty and dignity of the Photo-Drama was so tremendous that today, more than 60 years later, there are those who can recall its scenes and message and even the locations of the showings. For some, this educational production holds special significance. For instance, Della Smart, a Christadelphian, was troubled by the course of world events and by some teachings of her religion. She sincerely prayed to God for help in finding his people, in order to get these matters straight in her mind. A few days later, she saw advertising material for the Photo-Drama in Toronto. She attended the first session and realized that her prayers had been answered. That was in 1916. Now in her nineties, Sister Smart continues to serve Jehovah to the best of her ability.\n\nBUT NOT ALL WERE PLEASED\n\nIn most places, there was fine cooperation from officials and others, some theaters even being offered free for Photo-Drama presentations. But in other cases, there was opposition. For instance, in Toronto clergymen preached sermons against the Photo-Drama and tried to get theater managers to cancel the engagements. However, this only served to advertise it.\n\nAbout 1917, the Photo-Drama was due to be shown in Guelph, Ontario. What happened there is typical of the efforts made to stop its presentation and indicates who worked behind the scenes. George Humphries, who died in 1974, was a well-known Bible Student who worked for the local newspaper, the Guelph Mercury. In later years, this is how he told the story as he well remembered it:\n\n“The first Sunday showing went off well. There was a good attendance. On the Monday evening at the Town Council meeting, the Council tried to word a resolution as follows: ‘Resolved that no moving pictures be allowed to be shown on Sundays.’ Of course, this was aimed at the Photo-Drama. Then one alderman remarked: ‘Gentlemen, we will have to be careful about this. Suppose such pictures are needed for war purposes.’ So the resolution was changed to read: ‘Resolved that no moving pictures be allowed to be shown on Sunday, except for war purposes.’\n\n“Of course, it was clear that we would need to have this matter cleared up. The projectionist and I arranged to meet the mayor in his office. In this connection, Jehovah gave us the victory. Two outstanding things were in my favor. The mayor and my employer, the manager of the Guelph Mercury, Mr. J. I. McIntosh, were at loggerheads. Mr. McIntosh said to me, ‘George, you get all the facts and we will print them.’ To say I was thrilled was putting it mildly. The manager of the theater, a Catholic, showed me the book of laws respecting the showing of moving pictures on Sunday. ‘When you see the mayor,’ said he, ‘you show him this page where the law says that since you have a Provincial license to show such pictures on Sunday, then anyone, municipal or otherwise, that would interfere with your showing moving pictures on Sunday will be liable to a fine of 700 dollars.’ With these two weapons we approached the mayor in his office. We were ushered in and, when seated, the mayor looked me in the eye and said: ‘I am against you and will use any means, lawful or otherwise, to stop you from showing these pictures.’ . . .\n\n“First, I showed him the book of laws. ‘Where did you get this?’ he asked. ‘From the theater manager,’ I replied. He then rang for the city manager. When this one appeared, the mayor informed him of what had taken place. He then said to the city manager, ‘What can we do to him for this?’ This worthy scratched his head and remarked, ‘We could raise his license fee.’ This didn’t seem to go over well with the mayor. Then he fastened his gaze on me and asked, ‘Do you work at the Mercury?’ With the most pleased expression on my face, I answered, ‘I do.’ He looked like a beaten man and remarked, ‘I have no authority to stop you and none to say go on.’ With that we left.\n\n“I went to the Mercury office and gave them all the details. That evening the paper appeared with all the details on the front page . . . It was almost a column long and the heading stated that the Photo-Drama could not be stopped. The next Sunday, there was a lineup waiting for the doors to open. The theater was packed out for the rest of the showing, including the public meeting at the end. The people could be heard to remark, ‘Why are the clergy against this?’”\n\nCLERICAL OPPOSITION MOUNTS\n\nClergymen were also opposing our work in any way possible. For example, consider what happened in the case of Bible Student Charles Matthews in 1914. He became quite active in the Canaan Station and Birch Mountain sections of New Brunswick in talking about war coming in 1914, and some people said he would be sent to an asylum for the insane. But when war came that year, they said: “I guess Charlie’s right. It’s here. We thought the world too civilized for that.”\n\nBut clerical reaction was different. Something had to be done to counter the influence that Matthews could now have among the people. Accordingly, clergyman R. M. Bynon arranged for a lecture to be given at the Indian Mountain Reformed Church at Berry Mills in Westmorland County, New Brunswick. Its purpose? To “expose Russellism.” The cleric had a missionary with him to support his views. Matthews got an invitation delivered right to his home. At the service, the clergyman and his associate talked against Russell and “his” doctrines. One of them challenged anyone to disprove what they had been saying. But when Matthews tried to talk, they would not allow him to speak. Finally, one of the ministers paused to say “Amen!” Immediately, a deacon responded: “Yes, amen! Now let Matthews talk!” Matthews did speak for about half an hour, using the Bible. Then he thanked the audience for listening. A minister tried to counter by jumping up and shouting: “this man isn’t converted. He’s a heathen!” With that, however, the crowd got up and walked out.\n\nSometimes there was downright dishonesty on the part of a clergyman. For instance, in Winnipeg James Kelly had read a volume of Studies in the Scriptures. This is what happened shortly thereafter, as reported by his daughter, Mrs. Frank Wainwright:\n\n“Sunday, father, mother and all six of us trooped off to attend Easter Sunday church service at the Fort Rouge Methodist Church. I have never forgotten that sermon, given by [a cleric named] Salton, because it sounded so wonderful. So it was puzzling to me that my father should be scowling and should keep nudging mother’s arm and saying: ‘Remember that point,’ or, ‘Don’t forget what he is saying,’ over and over again. Near the close of this interesting sermon, I wondered why Dr. Salton should spoil his talk by vehemently warning his congregation to have nothing whatever to do with those ‘Bible Students,’ especially their literature [and falsely charging] that their leader, Pastor Charles Taze Russell, was an adulterer and an idolater. . . .\n\n“On the long walk home, I overheard father tell mother that she was to forget about getting dinner ready and was to sit down and read at least one particular chapter in the book ‘The Battle of Armageddon.’ I wondered why mother got so upset as she read. Finally, she exclaimed: ‘Why, Jim! . . . Dr. Salton quoted word for word from that chapter​—and no doubt from other parts of this book.’ Then father made mother turn to the front page to learn the name of the author. It was Charles Taze Russell!”\n\nThe hypocrisy of clergymen in their attacks upon Russell only served to open the eyes of righteously disposed persons. Starting with the very next Sunday, the Kelly family went to the meetings of the Bible Students.\n\nWARTIME HYSTERIA\n\nWith the coming of war, the clergy found a new weapon for use against the Bible Students. The enmity of some envious religious leaders and their urge to impede the growth of these Christians could be expressed behind a front of patriotism. These opponents would take advantage of wartime hysteria to brand Christian neutrals falsely as security risks and a danger to the State. This would mean that the clerics themselves would have to become champions of war, even though this put them in opposition to their brother-clergymen in other nations. This contradiction and their denial of the “Prince of Peace” did not seem to trouble them. (Isa. 9:6, 7) Here is an example of the clerical viewpoint, as recalled from that era by Mrs. Frank Wainwright:\n\n“I remember that one of the more outspoken clergymen had it stated in the papers: ‘Any man dying in the front line trenches has a free passport to heaven, and God himself could not keep him out.’”\n\nThe responsibility of the clergy in having promoted war was evident to some. In 1924, the Toronto Telegram reported:\n\n“Two young undergraduates from University College, R. V. Ferguson and W. S. McKay, came before the Toronto General Ministerial Association to expound the views of the ‘No More War’ group at the University. Mr. Ferguson, who is said to have spent four and one-half years with the Scots Guards in the war, declared that he had yet to meet the man who went into the war for the principle of the thing.”\n\nFerguson was quoted as saying: “We would sing ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers,’ and then fill ourselves up with rum so that we could do the dirty work. Thousands of young men enlisted in a state of drunkenness; others enlisted to be seen in uniform; others were lured by propaganda. The pulpit became a recruiting station. The church became a part of the organized sin. The ministers were recruiting sergeants and the cathedrals were hung with banners.”\n\nIndeed, the wartime position of the clergy as regards armed conflict did not go unnoticed. But what about their stance with respect to the activities of true Christians?\n\nDoes it seem naïve or unfair to say that the aim of some clerics was to silence the Bible Students? Well, consider what Ray H. Abrams wrote after the first world war in his book Preachers Present Arms. In discussing the wartime role of the clergy, he stated: “It is significant that so many clergymen took an aggressive part in trying to get rid of the Russellites. Long-lived religious quarrels and hatreds, which did not receive any consideration in the courts in time of peace, now found their way into the courtroom under the spell of war-time hysteria.”\n\nBut before relating the further actions of our religious opponents, it seems fitting to point out that for Jehovah’s people the years 1914 to 1918 brought other notable tests.\n\nCHRISTIAN NEUTRALS DURING WORLD WAR I\n\nCanadian Christians who maintained neutrality and respectfully declined involvement in World War I had to endure various sufferings. (Isa. 2:2-4; John 17:16) Harmless though these individuals were, a number of them endured not only incarceration but inhuman treatment designed to break them down, to ruin them spiritually. For instance, consider what happened to Ralph Naish and Robert Clegg at Winnipeg. George Naish, who served Jehovah faithfully in Saskatoon until his death in 1978, reported:\n\n“One day [Robert Clegg] and my fleshly brother Ralph were taken to the washrooms and, upon refusing again to agree to become soldiers, were held under cold and hot showers alternately until, after fainting several times, they lost consciousness and could not be brought around. They lay on the cold flagstone floor for several hours until the Officer of the Night came across them in his inspection. . . . They were then removed to St. Boniface hospital where, for some weeks, they were very ill indeed. The Winnipeg newspapers gave this quite a little publicity in the following day’s papers, but were quickly ordered by the Public Information Board of the government at Ottawa to desist and were told that certain steps would be taken under the War Measures Act if this was publicized further.”\n\nAmong Canadians receiving harsh treatment as Christian neutrals, besides Robert Clegg and Ralph Naish, were Frank Wainwright, Claude Brown, Lloyd Stewart, David Cook, Edward Ryan and John Gillespie. In time, these men were sent to England, where they eventually found themselves in the infamous Wandsworth Prison.\n\nLife in that prison was strenuous, and the Christian neutrals incarcerated there endured many hardships and tests of faith. For instance, Frank Wainwright recalls: “On one occasion, due to our refusal to undergo military drill, a number of us were taken to a secluded part of the prison yard. Lined up there were a number of men in uniform with canes in their hands. One by one, we were ordered to run the length of the court. If the pace was too slow, we were seized and dragged the distance and subjected to lashes on the back and legs by the men with the canes. We were then taken back to our cells. Our prayers to Jehovah for strength to withstand the pressure of such beatings must have been heard, for such occurrences never again took place.”\n\nClaude Brown was the only black man in this group of Christians, and he “came in for particularly rough treatment from guards and soldiers,” reports Brother Wainwright, adding: “Once in Wandsworth when he was threatened with the reminder of the prison slogans ‘We make you or break you’ and ‘We tame lions,’ Brown replied: ‘But you see, sergeant, we’re not lions. We’re the Lord’s little sheep!’ . . . After [Brother Brown] was released he continued to serve faithfully. In 1923 he was asked by the Watch Tower Society to serve in West Africa to assist ‘Bible’ Brown and his wife there.”\n\nJEHOVAH’S AID AND BLESSING EVIDENT\n\nSurely, Jehovah upholds his people when they suffer for righteousness’ sake, and their faithfulness leads to rich blessings. (Matt. 5:10; Phil. 4:13) Sometimes even cruel persecutors ultimately have ‘a change of heart.’ And faithful witnessing often produces good results. In this regard, consider the experience of George Naish, who stated:\n\n“The next day [after being arrested] I was taken before the army official in command of the prison and, after a long effort to make me implicate others and especially the family I had been living with, he placed a watch on his desk and informed me that I had three minutes to answer about 20 questions or I would be ‘taken down to number six and shot out of hand.’ I was assured that this was what was done with ‘yellowbellied so-and-sos who would not fight for their king and country.’ The verbal skirmish yielding no results, he bellowed at the top of his lungs, ‘Sergeant of the Guards!’ On the run came the sergeant with two buck privates. At this, the officer, a major, screamed at the top of his voice: ‘Take this yellow-bellied swine down to number six and shoot him!’ Never having gone through the process of being shot before, I was, to say the least, disturbed. But I prayed to God for his help. I was pushed and prodded into the basement and, on coming to ‘Number 6,’ the door was flung open and I was propelled forward with a tremendous kick in the rear. I was not shot, although in the succeeding months sometimes I wished I had been. . . .\n\n“After a period in this prison, I was transferred to the army camp then under canvas on the Exhibition Grounds and I thus had a change both of scenery and of action. While I was standing in between the long rows of tents in front of the quartermaster sergeant’s supply quarters, a tall young officer attended by two privates came briskly down the row. I heard enough of their conversation to know that I was the subject of discussion. Standing in front of me, several times the officer ordered me to stand at attention and, when I did not do so, struck me a prize-fighter blow under the chin, throwing me into the guy ropes of the opposite row of tents. Since I was unable to extricate myself, he threw himself upon me and started to throttle me. After some moments of intense pain, I became unconscious. My most vivid recollection of the incident is the rapid change in the expression on the man’s face as his burning hatred changed him from human to beast.”\n\nDespite these and other hardships, however, Brother Naish said: “It was wonderful to learn from experiences day by day that Jehovah really never does leave us or forsake us. Many times in prayer I told my heavenly Father that I was sure I had reached the end of my own endurance. However, something always happened to revive my spirits and show me over again that it was his power that sustained me.”\n\nMoreover, during this trying period George Naish had many opportunities to tell others about Jehovah’s purposes, thus building up his own faith and sowing some seed. “Some of this did mature,” he said, “as, for instance, in the case of a sergeant who paraded us around the city streets [of Prince Albert] for exercise. Years afterward, when working a rural territory some miles from Saskatoon, I called at a home where I found that former sergeant, now Mr. Roger Barker. He warmly bade me enter. After a few calls, he and his wife began to associate with the Saskatoon Congregation and came into the truth.”\n\nDo you recall that major who referred to George Naish as a ‘yellow-bellied swine”? Well, Brother Naish met him years later at a funeral in Yorkton. “When I stepped to the front to begin the service,” reported Brother Naish, “both of us had the look of total surprise. Following the service he asked me to drive to the cemetery with him. He immediately began to apologize for the treatment he had given me years before. It was hard for him to believe that I held no resentment at all. We enjoyed a very warm discussion about the truth. These and other encounters made me realize that, even when we were not able to talk about the things closest to our hearts, our actions made firm impressions on many people during those years of trial.”\n\nConsider another experience showing that endurance of suffering may lead to rich blessings. While imprisoned at one location, George Naish had the opportunity to associate with Brother Charles Matthews and to teach the truth to a fellow inmate. Brother Naish wrote:\n\n“We were allowed short periods of conversation before going to the noon and evening meals. Naturally, the three of us quietly talked about spiritual things. Louis Ratz, the fellow inmate I speak of, used to watch Matthews and me with intense interest. Afterwards, he said that this was without understanding the bond of unity we shared. I worked at the table next to him and, as opportunity permitted, he would come over and insist on being told all over again why I was in prison. My constant statement ‘because I wouldn’t go to kill my fellowman’ finally got through to him, causing him to spend much time laughing out loud. I went over to ask him what was amusing him so. He replied: ‘Everything very funny. I kill man. I get life. You no kill man. You get life.’ . . .\n\n“His interest was tremendous. After my release, I finally secured his release from prison through the parole board at Ottawa. This man, who had served 16 years in the penitentiary, came into the truth and was loyal right up to the time of his death some years ago.”\n\nNo, it was not easy to maintain Christian neutrality during the World War I period. Nor was it a simple matter to endure harsh, even brutal, treatment for righteousness’ sake. Nevertheless, the enduring of these hardships brought fine results. A witness was given, even certain persecutors were impressed, and there were some who embraced true Christianity because they observed the faithfulness of neutral Kingdom proclaimers. (1 Pet. 3:13-15) Despite their sufferings, Jehovah’s people surely had his aid and blessing during those difficult war years.\n\nOPPOSITION REACHES A CLIMAX\n\nOf course, not all Canadian Christians of that time suffered in prisons. But they were all put to the test, and they certainly had enemies​—religious opposers who were bent on silencing the Bible Students. Yes, for true Christians, the period from 1914 to 1918 proved to be a time of suffering for the sake of conscience. This seemed to reach its climax as the war demanded more and more men, and especially upon the publication of “The Finished Mystery,” the seventh and final volume of Studies in the Scriptures. Apparently, some clergymen were stung by its expressions on war, perhaps due to their own awkward wartime posture. There was a most vicious, and it appears, organized campaign to “get” the Bible Students spreading across North America​—and it started in Canada.\n\nHave we overstated matters? Not at all. Note what was said in Preachers Present Arms. Dr. Abrams wrote: “An analysis of the whole case leads to the conclusion that the churches and the clergy were originally behind the movement to stamp out the Russellites. In Canada, in February, 1918, the ministers began a systematic campaign against them and their publications, particularly The Finished Mystery. According to the Winnipeg Tribune, the attention of the Attorney General had been called to the Russellites, and the suppression of their book was believed to have been directly brought about by the ‘representations of the clergy.’”\n\nIn January 1918, leading clergymen of Canada signed a petition asking the civil authorities to suppress the publications of the International Bible Students Association. That no small number of opposers was involved is seen in the fact that the petition had upward of 600 signers. Many of the publications cited had been in use for more than 30 years! Obviously, it was not true patriotism that moved these clergymen to act against the Bible Students.\n\nThat clerical pressure moved the government of Canada to ban “The Finished Mystery” is seen in these remarks later printed in the Winnipeg Tribune: “The banned publications are alleged to contain seditious and anti-war statements. Excerpts from one of the recent issues of ‘The Bible Students Monthly’ were denounced from the pulpit a few weeks ago by Rev. Charles G. Patterson, Pastor of St. Stephen’s Church. Afterward Attorney General Johnson sent to Rev. Patterson for a copy of the publication. The censor’s order is believed to be the direct result.”\n\nOfficial records of the Canadian government that have been opened for public inspection in recent years clearly reveal that the clergy did indeed trigger the 1918 action against true Christians in this country. When it was suggested that the clerics had done this, there was a denial. Yet, at that very time, Chief Censor Col. Ernest Chambers had in his file a letter from “Reverend” A. E. Cooke, minister of the First Congregational Church in Vancouver, British Columbia, who had written this to the censor:\n\n“I have been instructed by the General Ministerial Association of Vancouver to bring to your attention a matter which seems to us to be of considerable public importance at this time. As you are aware the followers of the late ‘Pastor’ Russell . . . call themselves ‘International Bible Students’ . . .\n\n“Would it not also be well to prohibit the propagandist literature of this body which is published in the United States and sent to Canada for distribution by these people?”\n\nThe chief censor, Col. Chambers, wrote back. In his letter, which was marked “Confidential,” he said to clergyman Cooke:\n\n“Reverend and dear Sir: . . . your communication conveying as it did the views of such an influential body as The General Ministerial Association of Vancouver, proved very useful in securing action in this very important matter. . . .\n\n“I consider that the bitter attacks in these publications upon the Churches of all denominations, without distinction, are noteworthy, even if the statements embodied in these attacks cannot be described as ‘militarily objectionable.’”\n\nThese confidential documents of the past, now open to public examination, do show that the clergy really did trigger the action of 1918 against Jehovah’s people. Yes, these faithful Christians were denied their freedoms because they dared, as did Jesus Christ, to speak God’s Word without fear, exposing the hypocrisy of the clergy.​—Matt. 23:1-39.\n\nIt is most interesting that the Canadian ban came on February 12, 1918, and that in the United States the official act against “The Finished Mystery” came on March 14 of the same year. The U.S. action also came after representations by the clergy.\n\nCARRYING ON IN FAITH\n\nThe ban was imposed upon the organization of the Bible Students, as well as upon “The Finished Mystery” and “The Bible Students Monthly.” Outstanding during this period were the faith and determination of Jehovah’s people, convinced as they were that they had done nothing wrong and that it was only due to clerical interference that they were under ban. Some were up at 6 a.m. or were out late at night distributing tracts.\n\nFaced with an unjust ban, Canadian Christians proved to be “cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.” (Matt. 10:16) To illustrate: Janet MacDonald noted the press announcement: “The possession of any prohibited books leaves the possessor open to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and five years in prison.” But would this intimidate God’s people? Not at all! Sister MacDonald wrote: “As soon as we heard this we carried our supply of the book to the chicken coop. We placed newspapers in between the walls to keep the books clean, and packed them in and nailed up the boards. The next day the town constable came and asked my father if there were any copies of this book in the house, to which he replied ‘No.’” Of course not! The supply was in the chicken coop.\n\nThe fight for pure worship was on in Canada. “We prepared our supplies of ‘The Finished Mystery’ for a quick and widespread distribution, anticipating opposition,” wrote T. J. Sullivan, adding: “When the ban became law, a petition was next circulated by the brothers in the United States and Canada for the government to remove the restrictions placed on the book, so that people might be permitted to obtain this Bible-study aid without interference and molestation.” While circulating the petition in Port Arthur, Ontario, Sullivan and another brother were well received by the people in general. But there were repercussions. Brother Sullivan wrote:\n\n“The police obtained a search warrant, searched our [hotel] room, and found our personal copies of ‘The Finished Mystery.’ We found ourselves in jail that night but were released the next day. In all likelihood the arrest and publicity did more to set the facts before the people than the circulation of the petition would have done. The newspaper blazened our arrest on the front page . . . The police confiscated the five or six hundred copies of ‘The Finished Mystery’ sent to the territory for distribution. But that night, while the publicity in the newspaper was at its height, the police of Port Arthur carried home copies of ‘The Finished Mystery’ for themselves and their friends, so that the entire stock was distributed for us!”\n\nMany private homes in various places were raided to locate and destroy Watch Tower literature, including that found in personal libraries. Even Bibles were taken away! For example, as soon as news of the arrest of T. J. Sullivan and his associate reached Winnipeg, this is what happened, as Sullivan reported some years later: “The military sent a truckload of soldiers, who raided the homes where we were now staying in search for banned literature. The military could arrest us and could raid our property and confiscate our goods, but they could not try us. We were still civilians and the civilian court insisted that they were the ones to try us. The civilian authorities, in Winnipeg at any rate, were disgusted with the high-handed manner in which the military were raiding the homes and destroying the property of Christians. When the military raided a home they really upset the house. They would take coal, flour, sugar and other things, mix them all up and leave them practically unusable. This disturbed the civil authorities greatly, and some showed their concern by being as kind as they could in dealing with our cases.”\n\nIn a surprising number of cases, friendly individuals saw the injustice of the ban and befriended God’s people. They knew that the Bible Students were harmless and were good citizens, though having different beliefs. In one place, a police chief once advised one of his men (who was a Bible Student) that it might be best to take the day off since the police were going to be busy that afternoon raiding the I.O.O.F. Hall where the Bible Students met. The objective would be to confiscate any literature found there. That gave the brothers time to relocate their literature. One of the items the raiders found was a list headed “Servants,” referring to those in responsible positions. Certain that he had made a great discovery, the policeman finding the list hastened to show it to the officer in charge of the raid. But, not being acquainted with Bible terminology, after uttering some profanity he told the finder: “We don’t want their servants. We want the head guys!”\n\nIn another instance, Roberta Davies says that during a home raid a police inspector asked a young woman: “Are those your books?” “Yes,” she truthfully replied. He ordered: “Put them away, my dear, before I see them.” He later quit the force and told a Bible Student he just could not do “that sort of dirty work.” He was not the only policeman who felt that way.\n\nIn their efforts to locate our literature, government men were known to have intercepted the private mail of humble Christians. Despite this and the raiding of many homes, however, the majority of the publications never were found by the authorities. The literature was stored safely in barns, in basements and elsewhere.\n\nIn one classic case in the West, the local police slit mattresses down the middle, tore up the staircase carpet, pulled apart an organ and even sifted the flour in the bin, looking for copies of “The Finished Mystery.” But they could not find a single one. Unknown to them, however, there was a copy of this book fastened by straps to the bottom of the very stool on which the officer in charge sat as he directed his men during the search!\n\nWhen the authorities found our literature, often the possessor was fined heavily or jailed. But consider what happened in the case of 10 Bible Students from the Vancouver area. In the prison library they saw the very books for possession of which they were serving three months as punishment!\n\nPROBLEMS FROM WITHIN\n\nBesides suffering as Christian neutrals and later enduring hardships under a ban, Canadian Bible Students had other pressures and troubles to bear during the World War I period. Problems developed within the organization. But to consider these developments, we must step back somewhat in time.\n\nC. T. Russell had been ailing physically prior to the fall of 1916. But he carried on with his work and kept his speaking engagements. For instance, his great spirit for serving his fellow believers brought Russell to Canada once more in March 1916. His itinerary was as follows: Toronto (March 11), Peterborough and Lindsay (March 12), Midland (March 13), North Bay (March 14), New Liskeard (March 15), Bracebridge and Barrie (March 16), Guelph (March 17), Brantford and Hamilton (March 19) and Niagara Falls (March 20). An exhausting schedule indeed!\n\nSuch a heavy routine was taking its toll. At the Toronto gathering, Russell had to sit down while delivering his talks. Thereafter his health declined rapidly. Death came on October 31, 1916.\n\nWith this event came sorrow, disappointment and uncertainty about the future. Was the work to go on? Russell certainly had the view that there was a great work ahead for true Christians. During a question session at Vancouver in 1915, he had said: “There is a great work to be done, and it will take thousands of brethren and millions in money to do it. Where these will come from I don’t know​—the Lord knows his own business.”\n\n“A great work to be done”! Thousands to do it! How thrilling​—to most. Some, however, started showing a spirit of opposition to direction from Brooklyn in carrying on the very work Russell had mentioned. A few individuals began to have ideas about ‘taking over’ from Joseph F. Rutherford, who had been duly elected to replace Russell. Not only was that spirit of rebellion seen in certain ones who had enjoyed fine privileges at the Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn, but there were those in Canada who got these ideas as well. This, and the arrest of Rutherford and his associates on false charges in 1918, seemed to be about all the sincere ones could bear. It looked as though things were falling apart. Times of testing were upon one and all!\n\nIn Toronto about 30 persons withdrew from the congregation and formed their own group. They tried letter writing and other methods to draw away followers. But this activity died out in about two years. Also, at Montreal there were those who went off to themselves. Dissension that continued into the early 1920’s greatly affected the Vancouver and Victoria areas. Former pilgrim Charles Heard originated a so-called “Standfast” movement that affected classes all over the Canadian West, many congregations being split ‘down the middle’ in numbers. Some dissidents formed their own local groups that openly attacked the Watch Tower Society, falsely charging that it had been abandoned by Jehovah.\n\nAll this internal pressure caused many to be disturbed. Eventually, however, it became clear that unworthy persons were being separated from faithful ones. (1 John 2:19) It would take men and women of true faith and courage to do the great preaching and teaching work that yet lay ahead.\n\nA BRANCH OFFICE FOR CANADA\n\nBut not all was ‘bad news’ during those years. There was much over which to rejoice. The advancement of the Kingdom-preaching work prompted the establishing of a branch office of the Watch Tower Society at Winnipeg on January 1, 1918. Walter F. Salter was appointed as the first branch manager, and four individuals were invited to be on the staff.\n\nIn 1920 the branch office was transferred to Toronto, where it operated first at fairly commodious quarters at 270 Dundas Street West. The building was shared with an auto-top repair shop. (Cars of the day did not have metal tops.) There was good office space at the front and room for shipping at the back. Later, two small printing presses were brought in to print handbills and a booklet on hell. In those days, there were no living quarters at the branch office. So, workers stayed with other Bible Students, or at rooming houses, and looked after their own meals. Those then on the staff were W. F. Salter, Frank Wainwright, Charles Cutforth, Julia Loeb, Winnifred McCombe and Edna VanAlstyne.\n\nBAN IS LIFTED!\n\nAdding to the happiness of this period was the lifting of the unjust ban on “The Finished Mystery,” “The Bible Students Monthly” and the International Bible Students Association. This came on January 1, 1920, quite some time after the end of the war that supposedly had justified the ban.\n\nInterestingly, the Canadian clergy raised objection to the restoration of freedom of press and religion after the war. They even put themselves on record with a resolution on the matter. Why would they not want wartime restrictions removed? Some idea of their thinking can be gleaned from the fact that they made efforts to have the International Bible Students Association listed in a Department of Labour pamphlet of August 1920 that warned of organizations that were supposed to be subversive. But Brother Rutherford protested to the Department of Labour, and the public was informed about the situation in a printed protest that was distributed.\n\nA REVITALIZING OCCURS\n\nWhat rejoicing there was when the end of the war made it possible for our conventions to be resumed! And how delighted God’s people were that the releasing of Brother Rutherford and his associates from prison enabled them to attend some of these assemblies! In 1919 conventions were held at Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver. Twelve such Canadian conventions took place during 1920.\n\nThe appearance of J. F. Rutherford and some of his associates at Canadian conventions in the years following their release from prison and their exoneration from the false charges against them drew great crowds of interested persons to these gatherings. This was so at the series of assemblies in western Canada in 1921. The first of these conventions was held from August 5 to 7 at Winnipeg. That was the very city in which there lived the clergyman and the politician who had instigated the banning of “The Finished Mystery,” which was followed by a wave of persecution, including the imprisonment of Rutherford and his associates. How did the general populace of Winnipeg react to Brother Rutherford’s visit? An estimated 6,000 people were present for the public meeting.\n\nThe postwar period was marked by a revitalizing of Jehovah’s people. Outstanding in that regard was the 1919 convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A. It revived the enthusiasm for the evangelizing work among the Bible Students in Canada, as elsewhere. Released there was the new magazine The Golden Age (now called Awake!), which gave impetus to the work at hand. Then came the year 1922 and another thrilling convention at Cedar Point. Those attending it returned home with a determination to witness even in areas beyond their immediate territory. Jehovah’s people surely had been revitalized. They were indeed going to advertise the King and Kingdom!\n\nBRANCHING OUT IN KINGDOM SERVICE\n\nThis spirit moved God’s servants to branch out in their work of declaring the Kingdom message. Yes, they had been very active before 1922. For instance, in just one year​—1920—​here in Canada placements of the book “The Finished Mystery” had exceeded 65,000 copies! But now, after that 1922 Cedar Point convention, it was ‘back to the field’ for Kingdom publicity agents! And they were determined to give a witness, not only in their home territories, but in far-flung areas of the Canadian field.\n\nFor example, Charles V. Johnson did colporteur work way up in the Peace River country of northern Alberta, following up the activities of those who had witnessed there earlier. In 1919 a Bible Student named Nielson had been along the railroad as far north as Lesser Slave Lake. That was about 450 miles (720 kilometers) from the U.S. border, quite a distance north in those days! John Hamilton pioneered the Spirit River district from 1923 to 1934.\n\nConcerning a system used by Kingdom proclaimers in Saskatoon, George Naish writes: “Often weekends would see two of the brothers loaded with literature entrain and head for some small town not too far away where house-to-house work would be done until the return of the train, either that day or the next, made it possible to return home. If our return could not be made until the next day, leaving us the evening or part of it after the town had been worked, we would walk in different directions to the farmhouses within walking distance, meaning two to four miles [3 to 6 kilometers] away. We would work in a half-circle back to the village or town, board the train, and arrive home tired but happy about the privileges we had been able to share.”\n\nJust how industrious were proclaimers of the “good news” in those days? Well, consider what happened once when a mistake was made in ordering literature, resulting in the arrival of over 2,000 volumes of Studies the Scriptures for a small group to distribute. The one who erred in placing the order recalls: “Great was my mystification one day on returning home . . . I was greeted by the janitor of the building, who asked, ‘What on earth have you boys been ordering?’ I explained, ‘Just some books.’ His reply was, ‘You must have ordered a public library.’ . . . What were we to do with 288 sets of books, a total of 2,016 bound books? My partner refused to go along with my suggestion that I write to the Watch Tower Society’s Toronto office about the matter. He insisted that the solution was more and still more field service to place the literature. Interestingly enough, in less than a year we were completely out of Studies in the Scriptures, speaking well for the hard work of the brothers in the congregation.”\n\nIn branching out in Kingdom service, we used all sorts of vehicles​—bicycles, buggies and “democrats” (four-wheeled wagons pulled by horses). Also, there were horse-drawn rigs made of old auto bodies. In the wintertime, these were closed in and were called “cabooses.” Although they were heated by small wood-burning stoves that kept a passenger warm, there was the danger of being burnt if the caboose turned over. For open buggies there was some warmth provided by fieldstones that had been heated all night and then placed in the buggy at one’s feet. Blankets and buffalo robes completed the equipment.\n\nSometimes Jehovah’s people would cover large areas by forming caravans of early-day autos. The outside running boards along the bottoms of the car doors in those days were just the place to prepare meals or sort out literature! Tenting equipment that was taken along served to provide the needed sleeping accommodations.\n\nLoretta Sawyer recalls her colporteur days with horse and buggy in Saskatchewan. She reports:\n\n“The territory allotted me ran, from home, northward about 35 miles [56 kilometers] to the Saskatchewan River, westward 35 miles and was bounded by the same river, southward to the main line of the railroad and then eastward back toward home. It covered about 900 square miles [2,300 square kilometers]. . . .\n\n“Never was I without lodging for the night for myself or my horse. Jehovah always provided. Occasionally there would be a slight charge, but never was anyone nasty or unable to put us up. Along with being bedded down for the night, my horse and I received our breakfast, and my foot-stone was heated for a warm start those chilly fall days on the open prairie.”\n\nIt was at this time, too, that a small class began to develop well in Wakaw, Saskatchewan. This has had a definite effect on the Kingdom-preaching work in this land. Wakaw became an assembly place for the Bible Students. They made headlines in the community, since as many as 400 sometimes came there from other areas. Emil Zarysky of Wakaw became very active among fellow Ukrainians in the province and did a tremendous work. He served as a colporteur and as a pilgrim for a time. By 1926 there were 104 persons at the Memorial observance in Wakaw and growth was rapid. We can count at least 44 pioneers and missionaries that have come out of that small congregation. As many as 15 are still in full-time service, among them Joseph Lubeck and Olga Campbell (both now serving at Brooklyn Bethel) and Victoria Siemens and Helen Held.\n\nREADY FOR EXPANSION\n\nThe years 1922 and 1923 found Kingdom-preaching activity on the rise in Canada. By 1922 Memorial attendance had reached 2,335. Surely the early 1920’s were years of Christian progress in this land. And Jehovah’s people were looking to the future optimistically, for the December 15, 1923, Watch Tower stated: “Our new quarters are well lighted, comfortable, roomy. We have 5,600 feet of floor space​—sufficient for our present needs with allowance for further expansion.”\n\n“New quarters”? Yes, a better place had been obtained for the Society’s branch office. Only later would the staff be housed at the premises. But this roomier location did allow for enlarged printing facilities. Now the advertising of the Kingdom could be carried on in Canada with greater force than ever before.\n\nADVERTISING THE KINGDOM IN QUEBEC\n\nIn 1923, Alexander Deachman and Peter Allan Robertson were sent to Quebec as special colporteurs. A report from the Quebec field during that year states:\n\n“Our average of books [placed] p"
