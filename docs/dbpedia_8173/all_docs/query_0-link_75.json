        "text": "With the first truly cold blast of the year upon us, let's take a dive into how extreme cold can affect us in North Dakota and how we can protect ourselves from it.\n\nFrostbite or hypothermia can result from cold exposure and can be fatal. The most vulnerable groups are infants and the elderly. Various regions of the nation have varied definitions of extreme cold. Near-freezing temperatures are regarded as quite chilly in the southern United States.\n\nComplications of frostbite\n\nIf some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply. This can make the affected body part very vulnerable to infection because your body relies on white blood cells to ward off infections.\n\nPeople with frostbite are at risk of bacterial wound infections, such as tetanus. More seriously, this infection can spread into the blood (sepsis), which requires treatment with antibiotics. Both conditions require hospital admission.\n\nHypothermia\n\nSevere frostbite is often associated with hypothermia, which is a dangerous drop in body temperature below 95F.\n\nInitial symptoms can include:\n\nconstant shivering\n\ntiredness\n\nlow energy\n\ncold or pale skin\n\nfast breathing (hyperventilation)\n\nSomeone with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and have shallow breathing and a weak pulse.\n\nThe rate at which low temperatures and wind combine to cause the human body to lose heat is referred to as wind chill. The speed at which heat is removed from the body by increasing breezes causes the skin's temperature to drop and ultimately the body's core temperature. Wind cold also affects cars, plants, and other objects, but not animals.\n\nTo determine wind chill depending on temperature and wind speed, use the wind chill chart below. The length of time it will take for exposed flesh to get frostbitten is indicated by the shaded areas. You can find the frostbite times based on temperature and wind speed on the bottom chart.\n\nWhat causes frostbite?\n\nThe body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down, so flow to the vital organs can be increased.\n\nAs the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.\n\nThe ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.\n\nWhen the body temperature falls to less than 95°F, hypothermia sets in. It is lethal. Renal, hepatic, and pancreatic issues are likely to persist in the survivors. Uncontrollably shaking, memory loss, confusion, incoherence, slurred speech, tiredness, and seeming fatigue are warning indicators.\n\nAssess the individual's temperature. If it's less than 95°F, get medical help right away!\n\nWhen Traveling:\n\nAlways prepare for the worst!"
