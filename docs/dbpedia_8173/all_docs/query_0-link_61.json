The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9 a.m. in room 406, Senate Dirksen Building, Hon. John H. Chafee (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senators Chafee, Reid, and Wyden. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN H. CHAFEE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Chafee. I want to bid a welcome to everyone here this morning. This is a meeting to receive testimony on proposed solutions to the flooding at Devils Lake in North Dakota. The overall Devils Lake Basin, which encompasses some 3,800 square miles in the northeastern part of the State, is a closed sub- basin of the Red River-Hudson Bay drainage system. As a result of the 5-year wet cycle in the region, Devils Lake has risen some 16 feet since 1993 to its present level of 1,438 feet above mean sea level. During this period, Devils Lake has doubled in size and tripled in volume. By tripled in volume, I mean by that the content of water within the lake. The situation in Devils Lake is most unusual. The lake is found in one of only two closed basins in North America, Utah's Great Salt Lake Basin being the other. Carved into the prairie by glaciers during the Ice Age, the low-lying land has no natural outlet for the water that floods into it from the north. Indeed, according to the 1995 report of the Devils Lake Basin Interagency Task Force, no water has left the Devils Lake Basin in recorded history since the 1830's. Indeed, the Basin's surface runoff flows southward through many small streams and lakes and is collected by Devils Lake and the smaller nearby Stump Lake. There it remains until it evaporates or enters the groundwater table. Geological evidence shows that the water level in Devils Lake has fluctuated dramatically from completely dry, about 1,400 feet, to overflowing into the Sheyenne River at about 1,457 feet. All of this over the last 10,000 years. Records from the first European settlement of the area indicate that the lake level in the 1830's was about 1,440 feet. That level dropped over time to reach a level of 1,402 feet in 1940, rose again to 1,429 feet in 1987, dropped back to 1,423 feet in 1991. As I stated a moment ago, the lake level now stands at 1,438 feet. As we will learn today, the people who settled this area have long struggled with the problems presented by the unpredictable changes in the level of Devils Lake. In the current cycle, rising lake waters have caused some $100 million in damage to development and crop lands that had existed on dry lands during decades of low water. To help stem the further flood damage and prevent the lake from overtopping, the U.S. Corps of Engineers has embarked upon a plan with State and local agencies that includes the construction of a lake outlet. The proposed outlet would periodically drain excess water from Devils Lake into the Sheyenne and Red Rivers. The Devils Lake outlet and associated Federal water projects will be our focus today. In March of this year, the President requested an authorization in funding for the Devils Lake outlet as part of the fiscal year 1997 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The estimated total cost for the outlet is $50 million, 65 percent of which, or $32.5 million, would be financed by the Federal Government. This request was denied by Congress. However, $5 million was included for Army Corps planning and design work. The same request for authorization and funding, construction authorization funding, was advanced by the Administration and the North Dakota Congressional delegation as part of the fiscal year 1998 Army Corps appropriations bill. Once again, the specific request was denied by Congress in the recently approved Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. However, under an agreement reached between myself, other members of the committee, the North Dakota delegation and the Appropriations Committee, Public Law 105-62 does include $5 million to initiate outlet construction if a handful of criteria are met. Briefly, the recently enacted provision requires the Secretary of the Army to make a determination that an emergency exists, as defined by the Stafford Act. And I understand that Dr. Zirschky has recently made such a determination. In addition, the Secretary must report to Congress the project is technically sound, economically justified and environmentally acceptable and in full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, so-called NEPA. The agreed-upon language also specifies the project will be carried out in a manner consistent with the terms of the Boundary Water Treaties of 1909. Finally, the Army Corps of Engineers feasibility study shall not examine lake stabilization or inlet controls. The reason for our including these requirements is simple and fair. Such determinations are required for all other water resource projects recommended by the Corps. While the serious situation at Devils Lake unquestionably requires swift action, it has not yet been demonstrated by the Corps that the proposed outlet is technically sound, economically justified and environmentally acceptable. The standard Army Corps feasibility study and report by the Chief of Engineers has not been completed in this case. To definitely respond to the water quality and water quantity concerns expressed by the Canadian government, certain local citizens, neighboring States, plans for the Devils Lake outlet must undergo appropriate scrutiny. Now, having said all that, I want to welcome our witnesses. We're joined by our colleagues from North Dakota, Senators Conrad and Dorgan, and Representative Earl Pomeroy. Later we'll hear from the Army Corps and FEMA representatives, as well as two representatives of residents of North Dakota. I want to note that we invited Governor Ed Schafer to appear today. He worked hard to shift pre-existing commitments, but was unable to be here. Testifying in his absence is the State Engineer from North Dakota, Mr. Sprynczynatyk. I met with Governor Schafer a few weeks ago and know how committed he is to the efforts of Devils Lake. Senator Reid. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HARRY REID, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Reid. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for calling this meeting. I have a statement I would ask be submitted into the record so we can have the witnesses testify. But I will say that in all the time I've been in Congress, I've never seen such advocacy as the representatives from North Dakota on an issue. This is something that, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, they have been working day and night for months. They've worked so hard, I should say with me, not only me, that I feel that I know a lot about Devils Lake. It's a serious problem. You've been very good advocates for a difficult problem. And I think those of us from around the country must reach out and do what we can to help other States that have these emergencies that develop. So I appreciate your advocacy. And it speaks well of each of you and the work you've done for North Dakota. Senator Chafee. All right, Senators, we welcome you both. Senator Conrad, if you want to proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. KENT CONRAD, A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Senator Conrad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Senator Reid. We appreciate very much, Mr. Chairman, your holding this hearing. We appreciate very much your sincere interest in helping us face the crisis that we confront in the Devils Lake Basin. Mr. Chairman and Senator Reid, we believe that the flooding in the Devils Lake Basin constitutes an emergency. The President has so declared it, we have witnessed it. We have people here today who have lived it. And with the Chairman's permission and the committee's indulgence, I would like Vern Thompson, who is a State Senator from North Dakota, and co-chairman of the Lake Emergency Committee, to show us a brief video. It's 3 minutes in length, Mr. Chairman. I think it will help put in perspective what we face. Senator Chafee. Go to it. Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Video shown.] Mr. Thompson. What you see here is 19 miles from the shores of the lake. There are thousands and thousands of acres of agricultural deeded property. This is an example of many homes that have been moved, up to 300 homes. In 1993, Devils Lake covered 40,000 acres, and today it covers about 105,000 acres. Another example of some homes that have been overtaken by the water. Damages now exceed $200 million and rising. This is a vital link, Highway 57, between Devils Lake, where there's a hospital and Fort Totten, the Spirit Lake Nation. It's estimated the lake will rise another two to three feet, coming this spring. A two foot increase in the water will result in another $30 million in damages. Senator Chafee. What is that we just saw? Mr. Thompson. Nearly 300 families have already lost their homes. Another 50 will likely lose theirs this coming spring. This is on the protective dike around Devils Lake that Mayor Bott has worked out. Dikes protecting the city have already been raised five feet at a cost of $7 million. Work has now started to raise dike levels another five feet at an extra cost of $45 million. That's not included with the $200 million in damages. The economic activity is down 15 to 20 percent across the Devils Lake region. To date, business expansion is non-existent because of the rising waters. [Video continues.] Mr. Thompson. Senators, he lost his home. He's moved and relocated. Sixty-two million dollars has been spent to keep the roads above the rising water. Millions more may be needed for emergency services to get from Point A to Point B next spring. My wife is in law enforcement. Domestic violence reports are up, while the population is decreasing. We respectfully ask for your help. Senator Chafee. Thank you. That was very powerful. Senator why don't you proceed. Senator Conrad. If it would be all right, I'd like to stand, if I could, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I think that video demonstrates in very short order what we face. This is a remarkable situation without parallel anywhere else in the United States. Mr. Chairman, I direct your attention and the attention of the staff and Senator Reid to this depiction, which shows how big the lake was back in 1993. The succeeding overlay will show where it is today. This is 1993, this is---- Senator Reid. It's more than one body of water? Senator Conrad. Yes. This lake, there are related lakes to the north, Senator Reid. This is Devils Lake proper. Off to the east it's Stump Lake. As you can see, this is a massive body of water. To put this in perspective, the size of this body of water today is three times the size of the District of Columbia. This is not some placid, small lake. This is a massive body of water. And it is growing, and it is growing inexorably. In fact, it has grown 20 feet in the last 4 years, doubling in size, tripling in volume as the chairman indicated. This shows what happens if the lake goes to 1,457 feet, at which time it will have an uncontrolled release into the Sheyenne River Valley. Mr. Chairman, for your perspective, this size would be about the size of the entire State of Rhode Island. Senator Chafee. Which one is that now, Senator? Senator Conrad. This is what happens if the lake goes to 1,457 feet, where we know it has gone several times before in history. If it goes to this level, it will then have uncontrolled releases, uncontrolled as to both quality and quantity. I think that's a critically important point. If it goes to this level, we will see releases that will be uncontrolled. Senator Reid. What do you mean, releases? Senator Conrad. There will be an escape of the water from the Devils Lake lakebed. And this water will then go over into the Sheyenne River Valley uncontrolled. Uncontrolled both as to quality and quantity. That would simply move the flood downstream. And in terms of water quality, that would mean people downstream get sick. They get sick because the dissolved solids are not something their systems can tolerate. And the water treatment facilities of the major cities downstream are not prepared to deal with the level of dissolved solids that they would experience. Senator Chafee. When you say downstream, down what stream? Senator Conrad. Very, very important point. Mr. Chairman, the first people downstream are the people of North Dakota. People in the city of Valley City, people in the city of Fargo, which is the largest city in our State. People in the city of Grand Forks. Because remember what happens here. If the lake goes to 1,457 feet, which we know has happened before in history, at that level it goes over into the Sheyenne River. Sheyenne River goes over into the Red River, and remember, the Red River goes north. Red River goes north. When we're talking downstream, initially, it's down in terms of, most people would think of down as south. It goes south into the Sheyenne. That goes down into Valley City. That goes over, loops over into the Red River. Then the Red River goes north, goes over into Fargo and Grand Forks. So when people say there are water quality concerns for our neighbors to the north in Canada, we need to remind them, the first people who will experience water quality problems are our people. And it is the majority of the people in our State who are resident in this part of North Dakota. If we could go to the next chart. Mr. Chairman and Senator Reid, this chart shows the historic water levels of Devils Lake. The chairman recounted in his opening statement what we have seen. You can see it, the lake has now, Mr. Chairman, gone up another five feet. In your opening statement, you indicated 1,438 feet. That was exactly right a year ago. It's gone up another five feet this year, again, unpredicted by all of the forecasting services. This lake has gone up another five feet to 1,443 feet. You can see that's the highest it has been in over 130 years. Mr. Chairman, this is an emergency. And it has required an emergency response from the Federal Government. This is the money that we have spent so far from the Federal Government, over $210 million, from the Federal Treasury already. The Office of Management and Budget and the Corps of Engineers tell us if this lake continues to rise, and if in fact it goes to the level of 1,457 feet, that the damages then will reach $450 million. So the question of cost effectiveness is an important one. Again, if this rise continues and goes to 1,457 feet, the estimates are the total cost to the Federal Government will then reach $450 million. We've already spent $210 million. The latest estimate of the cost of this outlet is $45 million. Mr. Chairman, there has been a great deal of confusion about how an outlet from Devils Lake may relate to the transfer of water from the Missouri River Basin over into the Red River Valley. I have prepared this chart to show this committee that in fact, an outlet has nothing whatever to do with the transfer of water from the Missouri River Basin. It has nothing to do with it. Mr. Chairman, this shows the Devils Lake Basin inside the larger basin of the Red River watershed. Devils Lake watershed, inside the Red River watershed. Here is the Missouri River. The Missouri River has nothing to do with an outlet from Devils Lake. Some are saying, and some will present to you today that this is all a scheme to further Garrison, the Diversion project. That is false. Let us be clear. That is simply false. There is no inlet that is provided for in this legislation. And in the Garrison Diversion amendments that we will be offering later this year, there will be no provision for an inlet, period. Senator Chafee. Let me just ask you, Senator, could you put that chart back up, please? In other words, what you're saying is there are two totally separate subjects? Senator Conrad. Two totally separate subjects. Senator Chafee. And I mean, since Senator Burdick left here, I've really lost track of the Garrison project, which he was deeply interested in. I thought, as best I recall, we had gotten that settled pretty well. But in any event, that's not involved here. The other thing I think is important for us to remember in the discussions today is there are two separate things we're talking about. One, we're talking about an outlet and on a separate direction, we're talking possibly an inlet. But that's a separate subject. You're talking outlet here. Senator Conrad. Mr. Chairman, I want to be crystal clear on this point. We are talking solely about an outlet. No. 1, any inlet consideration is precluded by the legislation. No. 2, in the Garrison amendments that we will be offering later this year or early next, there will be no provision for an inlet to Devils Lake. None. So those who seek to confuse this issue, those who seek to tie the two, are attempting to mislead this committee and attempting to mislead the Congress of the United States. There is no connection between an outlet from Devils Lake, which is contained completely in the Devils Lake watershed and the Red River watershed, with the question of the Missouri River. Senator Reid. How far is it from Devils Lake to the Missouri River in miles? Senator Conrad. It's about 150 miles. I would just close, Mr. Chairman, by showing, this is a road leading into the lake. This is what we have going on all throughout the Devils Lake Basin. And I would close, Mr. Chairman, with this picture, which I think is especially compelling. This is a house that didn't catch on fire, this is a house that is being burned down. It is being burned down because, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, it is being inundated by the flood waters and it could not be moved fast enough. This is a scene that is being repeated all across the Devils Lake Basin, as homes are being burned because they cannot be moved quickly enough. Mr. Chairman, this particular home happens to belong to a paraplegic. This man has had to burn his own home down because of health considerations for the rest of the community. It is time to act. This is an emergency situation. I don't know what could be more clear. I thank the chairman. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Senator Conrad has very ably described for you the circumstances of our being here this morning. And Mr. Chairman, when you indicated you haven't heard much about Garrison Diversion lately, that is because it is true, in the mid-1980's, we passed a reformulation act for Garrison Diversion. There will need to be a further adjustment in that, and I expect we will be involved, and your staff, in fact, has been involved in some initial discussions about that. But this does not have anything to do with Garrison Diversion. It has to do with the question of flooding that exists in a closed basin, one of only two closed basins in American for which there is no inlet and no outlet, and seemingly, no solution. So faced with that, the question for us and for the folks in the Devils Lake Basin is, what do we do? And the answer was, you do a lot of everything in order to try to resolve this issue. You do upper basin storage, you build dikes, you do a range of things, including you try to find a way to provide for a reasonably sized outlet to try to relieve some of the pressure from this lake. In addition to the charts that Senator Conrad has shown you, I'd like to show this chart. This is a woman standing at the bottom of a telephone pole, at the base of a telephone pole looking up. That was taken in 1965. And she was standing at the base of that telephone pole, looking up. And she was looking at where the waters of that lake had been previously. Now, if you go all the way to the top of that telephone pole, which was July 2, 1997, that's where the water is today. She's not going to stand at the base of that telephone pole today, because the water has risen to that level, and 1,444 is the highest projected level on that chart, and that's where it is now predicted to go. Mr. Chairman, I have heard some say, gee, this is not an emergency. I'd like to just pose this question. This is a proposition of time and dimension. Let me pose this question. What if, after the time that we retired for the evening last evening, all of us had a fitful sleep, and we awakened this morning to hear on the news that we had a huge body of water that had just flooded. It had done over $200 million worth of damage last night, 300 families were gone, and we had an Indian community that was now isolated. The Spirit Lake Tribe is isolated from medical help and so on. Would we not see that in banner headlines across the country? Of course we would. This is a slow motion disaster. It is clearly, by any standard of definition, an emergency. I want to describe it in other terms. But first I want to describe it in personal terms, if I might. The fellow that you saw in the video with the western hat, Mr. Chairman, his name is Dwayne Howard. My dad was a horseman. All the time I grew up, we went to rodeos and horse shows. Not just in North Dakota, we went to other parts of the country. When I was a kid, I watched Dwayne Howard ride bulls all across this country. Senator Reid. That's why he limps? Senator Dorgan. That's exactly the case. You saw him with a rather slow gait. He was one of the great bull riders in America, as a rodeo cowboy. You could have seen him ride in Boston Gardens, in the Cow Palace in San Francisco, the National Western in Denver. I can't tell you how many times I saw Dwayne Howard come out of a chute on a bull. And he was one of North Dakota's national champions as a bull rider. He retired to Minnewauken, North Dakota, to a farm and ranch. He's lost his land, he's lost his home, he's lost everything. He's lost the small inheritance he had. He's cashed in his insurance, cashed in his retirement and now has nothing left. I tell you that simply to say, this is a human problem of desperate proportions, to some wonderful people who are confronting this emergency, and they're asking for help. Now, what is the help? The help is a whole series of things to try to respond to what's happening to us in this basin. One of those is an outlet. And the outlet itself is not a magic solution. It is part of a series of things that must be done in coordination to do what we can do to take the pressure off this lake. And that's why we're here this morning. Mr. Chairman, you especially have been enormously helpful to us. We know that you have the capability of stopping the $5 million of construction funds that were included in the last appropriations bill. I understand that could have been stopped, and it was not because you and others felt that the community and the State had made its case. This hearing is further evidence of your interest and concern about this region of the country. We are a community of interest in this country and the folks who live in this basin, the Devils Lake Basin, have an abiding interest in asking you and this committee and the Congress to help address this problem. They are addressing it every day in every way. And they're asking for your help. Let me make just a couple of comments about the criticisms that you may have heard. The outlet will somehow cause angst to Canada or to downstream interests. Senator Conrad pointed out that the water will go into a river whose downstream interests first and foremost are North Dakotans. I would not be at this table asking to transfer water in a manner that would injure other North Dakotans. It's not in North Dakota's interest, it's not in the Congressional delegation's interest. This is not an outlet that will remove water from Devils Lake that in any way comes from another basin. So to the extent that Canada writes letters, as they have, and they've written to me and to you, suggesting that this is of great concern with the potential of removing water from the Missouri River Basin, it is not going to happen. That's not what this proposal is about. They're welcome to win a debate we're not having. But this is not about moving Missouri River water. This outlet will actually help with quality and quantity problems, because it will give us some control over both the quality and the quantity of water that's released. We will not have that control if we do nothing, and this lake moves naturally across its boundaries and dumps into the Sheyenne River, and then up the Red River. This outlet makes good economic sense and is strongly supported by the Administration, which included, as you know, in its own fiscal year 1997 disaster supplemental bill a proposal for the entire funding for the outlet. And the outlet has enormous economic value to the community and to the region, because it will preserve a regional trade center, it will reduce flooding and avoid expenditure of other Federal funds. This will be of great economic value to that region. Finally, this outlet is needed to protect the homes and livelihoods of all the folks in the Basin who are threatened, including and especially a tribal government and the Native Americans who live in the Spirit Lake Nation, who are among the most affected by high water and who are least able to cope with it. They have a very high unemployment rate, a very high rate of poverty. And we hold a trust responsibility for them as well, and they will benefit enormously by this approach. Finally, let me say that this outlet will be cost shared. It's a critical part of a comprehensive strategy. We are not moving around saying, this is the solution. We have worked very hard with the Governor, with State legislators, with Federal, State and local officials, to develop a comprehensive policy that has many different parts to it, all of which are now being implemented to address this flooding problem. One of those parts, just one, but a critical one, is the building of an outlet. And let me finally just show a map, because I think it's always good in terms of frame of reference, we mentioned Rhode Island. This will give you a notion of the size of the lake area, it's overlaid with the outline of Rhode Island. Our State, incidentally, Mr. Chairman, is ten times the size of the State of Massachusetts. The actual Devils Lake Basin, the Basin itself inside our State, is about the size of the State of Massachusetts. And you can see that if you overlay the State of Rhode Island, for example, on the specific lake area, about what kind of dimension we're talking about. So Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your patience and your help, and especially your courtesy in hearing in great detail the story of an emergency that causes us to ask once again for your help. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Senator Dorgan. I don't know what your situation is, you and Senator Conrad. Can you stay for a few minutes while Representative Pomeroy makes his statement? Then I have some questions. Or I could ask you questions now if you're anxious to go. Can you stay a few minutes? Senator Reid. Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to leave. I got a note to leave. I would ask consent from the Chair that I be able to submit some questions in writing for Secretary John Zirschky when he appears. Senator Chafee. Certainly. Senator Reid. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Now, the Honorable Earl Pomeroy, who is the U.S. Representative from the State of North Dakota, and I believe the only representative, right? Mr. Pomeroy. That's right. Senators come by the pair, but we only have one Congressman. [Laughter.] Senator Chafee. Well, we won't pursue that any further. Now, why don't you proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. EARL POMEROY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Mr. Pomeroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to briefly discuss three important points. First, there's virtual unanimous agreement among all those with actual responsibility for dealing with this problem that an outlet has to be part of the solution. Second, while this hearing focuses on the outlet, extensive efforts have been made at the other alternatives, the other things that must be done as part of the solution. And third, while this is an emergency and a quick response is required, full NEPA review of this outlet prior to its construction will take place. Think of the most significant water problem in your State, Mr. Chairman. Imagine the different perspectives that inevitably exist across the varying stakeholders to this problem, the many public officials with a hand in trying to find some solution. I would doubt that there would be virtual unanimity among all of those entities in terms of how to deal with it. But that is the case with the Devils Lake outlet. At the State level, the Governor, each member of the delegation, the State legislature, and the State water commission have all reached what I believe is the inevitable and inescapable conclusion that the outlet has to be part of the mix in terms of dealing with this problem. Now, I say that as someone who was born and raised literally on the banks of the Sheyenne River, downstream from Devils Lake. I used to represent Valley City, my hometown, the first city downstream from Devils Lake, in the State legislature. Now, more than half of the voters I represent live downstream of Devils Lake. Obviously, I reached the conclusion that the outlet is an important part of this answer only upon reaching a very thorough personal conclusion that this outlet can be done in a way that's compatible with downstream interests and that there is simply no other way to meaningfully deal with the ongoing, very, very severe flooding in the Devils Lake area. Now, I'm not saying downstream there aren't opposing views on the outlet. There are a few that think this is a bad idea. But any public policy problem presents different conclusions. Yet you don't see in the record, nor will you see to date one city council resolution, one county commission resolution opposing the outlet. Those that have some responsibility in terms of actually trying to deal with this terribly vexing public problem have all come to the conclusion an outlet is necessary. We don't have the luxury of viewing this in an academic light. Or perhaps from the dispassionate geological perspective covering thousands of years. People are being hurt today, farms and businesses are being destroyed. A town is threatened. A Native American reservation with a population of up to 4,000 is having their access to essential medical services threatened today. These are the needs here and now, and we have had to respond to them. I would also emphasize that across the Federal agencies that have spent so much time and invested such substantial resources, there is also virtual accord that an outlet has to be part of the answer. Now, when I emphasize part of the answer, Mr. Chairman, this isn't one of those pull the bathtub stopper and the water goes away. But it were that simple. There's not a silver bullet answer to Devils Lake, and we're not proposing that the outlet is. Two other lines of attack have been intensely pursued: upper basin storage as well as infrastructure investment, as my colleagues have noted. This upper basin storage is not a terribly easy thing to achieve, dramatically increasing the water impoundment upstream. Most of the land that might be available for that has been under cultivation in productive family farms for over a generation. You take acreage out of production, you literally take away the economic base of those individual family farm units. The only way we can expand upper basin storage dramatically is basically a strategy of maximizing impoundment on public lands and trying to put in place a series of financial incentives to enlist private landowners to impound water. The delegation at every conceivable opportunity has attempted through one program after another to enhance the incentives for upper basin water storage. And we've had some considerable successes. The most significant in terms of actual acreage would be the CRP program. We fought for and obtained a special designation for much of the acreage in North Dakota, including virtually all of the upstream acreage. That made it much more likely to be enrolled in the CRP program. Presently in the 6 area counties of the region, 436,000 acres signed up in CRP. There is, as you know, the second enrollment taking place right now for this 10-year lease program. And this area has been so inundated with the response, they've had to bring on extra help. So we have really done what we feel is the best job we possibly can at expanding the upper basin storage. And some thoughts of random county-wide condemnation or some other things to try and take away the productive acreage of family farmers and get that water on there is simply not viable in a realistic way. In addition, the infrastructure struggle, one that I have been particularly involved in, is getting homes moved before we have to burn them, as that terrible picture showed. We have learned in North Dakota that this house moving is a real art. If you would just hold up that, we've moved more than 200 homes, all shapes and sizes. The Federal Flood Insurance program has been an integral part of that program. It's cost us to date $17 million as insured homes are moved from harm's way just prior to inundation and total loss. In addition, as had been mentioned, we've worked at levies and we've worked at levies some more. Every time you further raise them, the costs seem to compound on you. We are now in the process of a $43 million dike-levee raise up to the 1,450 mark. The final thing I want to mention is that this outlet will have NEPA review. It is in an expedited form. The outlet under consideration, that enjoys the strong consensus I indicated earlier, will have NEPA review. Some suggest that even, that any expediting, any trying to get this NEPA review done more quickly than the usual, normal, staid, leisurely, up to 6 year process, is some kind of abrogation of the environmental safeguards. Not so. It's done, it's just done as quickly as possible, because we've got a full-fledged emergency on our hands. And people that really don't think this is an emergency I believe are being terribly cavalier with the plight of the individuals that we represent and that we have seen choked up as they try to tell us about their losing businesses and inundated homes. In conclusion, then, Mr. Chairman, I think North Dakota, aside from the moving Fargo adding a lot of fame to that city of the State, North Dakota has become known for almost a tale of two cities, Grand Forks and Devils Lake. There's a contrast between the two. Grand Forks is like having a friend hit by a truck. Everything's fine, and then everything's terrible. Devils Lake is like watching a friend waste away to cancer. That is, a cancer that is a plague on our State. It is a most serious problem, it is a cancer not in remission, it is a rapidly deteriorating situation. We desperately need your help. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Representative. I want to welcome Senator Wyden here. I understand you have no statement, Senator. As you know, the way we do these matters, where the Army Corps of Engineers is involved, there's what we call a feasibility study, which is really something quite swift that normally is done on these matters. We don't yet have the feasibility study. I'll be asking the Chief of Engineers about that. I just wanted to let the Senators and Representative know. And I don't know why. And from that, we also need a report from the Corps that the project is technically sound, economically justified, environmentally acceptable. We don't have any of that yet. I don't know why. Because although this is an emergency, it hasn't happened overnight. I think, Senators, you spoke to me about this some time ago, and it's been going on long before that. Let me ask you about a letter that was sent by your Governor, by the Governor on August 1 to Senator Lott. This letter was from the Governor and the majority leaders of the State legislature. And I quote: ``Abandoning for all time the possibility for an inlet,'' and I think all through this we want to keep people's focus on the difference between the inlet and the outlet, they are two separate matters, but they both affect this Devils Lake, or potentially could, the Senators and the Representative are here now discussing an outlet, and indicating that's what you seek. But the Governor and the legislative leaders wrote this: ``Abandoning for all time the possibility for an inlet runs contrary to the statewide water development plan, which envisions stabilization of Devils Lake. It represents a significant statewide policy shift, made suddenly at the Congressional level, with minimal input from North Dakota.'' What do you say about that, gentlemen? Senator Conrad. Mr. Chairman, I think it's very important that we make this very, very clear. That matter has been resolved. It has been resolved---- Senator Chafee. That matter being the inlet? Senator Conrad. That is correct. Mr. Chairman, as you know, in this legislation, an inlet is specifically excluded. No. 2, the State of North Dakota negotiating team that includes the three gentlemen that are signatories to that letter, have agreed on a submission of amendments to the Garrison project with respect to this issue. And the State of North Dakota---- Senator Chafee. This issue being? Senator Conrad. The issue of an inlet. And the State negotiating team that includes the three gentlemen that are signatories to that letter have agreed that there will be no provision for an inlet in the Garrison amendments. That has been decided. That is resolved. It's no longer an issue. Senator Chafee. In other words, even though this was dated August 1, which is a couple of months ago, you're saying that's now been resolved, and that what comes under the Garrison project is a separate subject, a future matter to be taken up, the Garrison project could well involve an inlet to Devils Lake, but that's a separate subject to be considered later? Senator Conrad. Mr. Chairman, could I make it even more clear than that. We have agreed, in fact, I have a letter from the Governor and the other two gentlemen who are signatories to the August 1 letter. And this letter relates to Garrison amendments that we are working on. In the document that addresses the question of an inlet or an outlet for Devils Lake with respect to the Garrison amendments, in that document, the working document, it says, do not include outlet or inlet in amendments to 1986 Act, referring to the Garrison project. Outlet is being considered on a separate emergency basis. And the document from the three gentlemen who are signatories to the letter dated August 1 say that their position is agreement, agreement with the principle that we will not include, will not include, in any Garrison amendments, any reference to an inlet or an outlet. That the outlet is being considered on a separate, emergency basis. So the August 1 letter has been overtaken by events. The Governor and the top legislative leaders have signalled their agreement that in any Garrison amendments, an inlet will not be included. Senator Chafee. Could you, Senator, submit that letter and whatever attached documents for the record, please? Senator Conrad. We'd be happy to submit the relevant parts for the consideration of the committee. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman? Senator Chafee. Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan. If I might just further respond to that. As you know, I'm a member of the Appropriations Committee. And this issue was addressed in the appropriations deliberation before, in fact, the last item of business before the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill left the U.S. Senate. The $5 million was provided for this outlet, as the last item of business. But the $5 million was combined with language required and requested by Senator Bond. That language dealt with the issue of the inlet. And we accepted that in exchange for getting funding for an outlet. The fact is, there was fairly substantial criticism in North Dakota for our accepting that. But nonetheless, that is done. That went to conference. There was an attempt, and I think the letter addresses that attempt, to soften that language. The conferees refused to do so. And we now have in law a provision that says there will not be an inlet, in attendance with this discussion of an outlet. So I was a part of the process, in the appropriations process, that accomplished the money for achieving the outlet. But I understand what happened was, language was included that is now law dealing with the question of prohibiting an inlet. Mr. Pomeroy. Mr. Chairman, I'd only add that this happens all the time. The State leaders wanting maximum flexibility, Congress not disinclined often to have some assurances that things go as they direct. In this case, the direction was imposed in the legislation, now enacted, in Federal law, relative to the inlet. So that has been disposed of, and irrespective of the wishes of State officials as expressed in the August 1 letter. Senator Chafee. Let me ask one final question, and then I want to go to Senator Wyden. We've got on the next panel the State engineer and so forth. But just briefly, from your point of view, is there a concern about the quality of the water, if you have this outlet? In other words, if you look at this thing here, without getting into tremendous detail, what you are proposing is reasonable, you build an outlet, it goes down to the Sheyenne River, flows over to the Red River, then it goes up and everything's fine. But I presume there are some hitches to it. One is the quality of the water. It's a saltish water, is there a concern about that? And I know I'm not looking to you as experts, because we've got other experts on the next panel, probably. But what do you say to that? Senator Conrad. Yes, sir, we are concerned. That's why we believe it is critically important to have an ability to release water on a controlled basis. Controlled as to both quality and quantity. The reason that is especially important, Mr. Chairman and Senator Wyden, is because the quality of the water in this lake is many times worse out at the east end, where an uncontrolled release would occur, than out at the west end, which is where the controlled release would occur. In other words, we are much better able to manage the quality of the water if we have it released out of the west end than on an uncontrolled basis out of the east end. If you look across that lake, the natural outlet is out of the east end. And the water quality is many times worse, many times worse out of the---- Senator Chafee. Dissolved solids? Senator Conrad. Yes, dissolved solids, salts, much worse out at the east end. If this lake goes over into Stump Lake, it will raise Stump Lake 40 feet. And the water quality, much worse. One of the reasons that those who have been working to devise a solution have chosen a controlled outlet out at the west end is because then you can have water quality in the Sheyenne that is roughly equivalent to what is in the Sheyenne now. And you can meter out the water in a way that does not present a water quality concern downstream. Again, I'd remind the chairman and the other members of the committee and the staff, that we're the first ones downstream. It is the majority of the population of the State of North Dakota who are in the first trench, if you will. And that is why we have got a special concern about water quality. We have no interest in moving this flood downstream. Because downstream is North Dakota. And we have no interest in imposing bad water quality downstream, because downstream is North Dakota in the first instance. Senator Dorgan. Let me also mention the Corps of Engineers report says, the operation of the outlet as proposed would meet applicable water quality standards. The operating plan proposed in a previous report was based on meeting the Sheyenne River's class 1A standards at the release point. And what Senator Conrad says is critically important. If you do nothing and this moves by its own motion, and goes over, what happens is the worst possible quality water goes into the Sheyenne. If measured releases from an outlet in a thoughtful way are able to reduce the pressure from that lake, you are able to provide releases from the better quality water in the lake. So there's no question that what we're doing represents the best interests with respect to water quality that would go down the Sheyenne. Senator Chafee. You're suggesting that if nothing happens, there's liable to be an overflow on the eastern end, where the worst water is, and it could flow right down there. So you'd have a situation that would put the worst water into the Red River. Senator Dorgan. And it's not just the worst, it's many times worse in terms of quality than other water in the lake. You're exactly correct. Senator Chafee. OK, thank you. Senator Wyden, I understand you have no questions. Thank you all, gentlemen, very much. We appreciate your coming here, and this is a very serious matter, and we'll do our very best. Thanks for your attention. Now we'll have the next panel. John Zirschky, Acting Secretary for Civil Works, Corps of Engineers; the Honorable Michael Armstrong, Associate Director for Mitigation, of FEMA; Dave Sprynczynatyk, North Dakota State Engineer, from Bismarck; Dr. Gary Pearson, Dakota Prairie Chapter, National Audubon Society; and Mr. Joe Belford, Lake Emergency Management Committee. If you'd all take your seats, and I want to say one thing. Gentlemen, if we'd move right along now, folks, there's going to be a vote at 11 o'clock. So that gives us a little bit over an hour, and we ought to able to have everybody have a fair chance here. But I would ask that you keep your statements to 5 minutes. You'll see the lights here, if somebody goes a little bit over, they're not going to be guillotined, but we want to keep that so we'll have a chance to ask questions and give thorough consideration to everything that's said. Mr. Zirschky, why don't you proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN H. ZIRSCHKY, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR CIVIL WORKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY Mr. Zirschky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I would ask that my written statement be placed into the record. Senator Chafee. Without objection. Mr. Zirschky. Mr. Chairman, I've been in my present position for about 4 years, which is something of a record for the job that I'm in. I can say in all honesty that Devils Lake is one of the toughest challenges that I've faced, and that finding the right solutions to this problem are going to be very, very difficult. Furthermore, the Corps of Engineers has been the Nation's problem solver since 1775. In fact, we're one of the few Federal agencies the founding fathers would recognize. Even with this long history, the situation at Devils Lake is unique. This is going to be a tough problem for us to solve. To highlight the problem, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask everyone in the room to sort of imagine a line on the wall about 12 feet from the floor. And that's how much higher the water is in Devils Lake than the adjacent town of Devils Lake. I think it's about where the joint is on the two wood panels. And I doubt that would be acceptable to most Members of Congress. Senator Chafee. Now, what are you saying, 12 feet is what? Mr. Zirschky. The water level in Devils Lake is about 12 feet higher than the adjacent town of Devils Lake. Our levee systems are basically acting as dams. We're essentially building an earthen dam between Devils Lake and the town of Devils Lake. And the water level right now is 12 feet higher than the town. Senator Chafee. They're dikes, rather than dams, aren't they? Mr. Zirschky. Pardon? Senator Chafee. It's a dike, isn't it? Mr. Zirschky. Well, what we're essentially building it as a dam, sir. Senator Chafee. OK. Mr. Zirschky. A very large, earthen dam. I doubt it would be acceptable to many Members of Congress to have their constituents for years living next to basically 12 feet of water. The first point I would like to make is that there is a flood at Devils Lake. It's not a hypothetical situation. There's a flood there right now. And one of my former professors used to tell me that you should put problems in three categories: real problems, potential problems and imaginary problems. Devils Lake is a real problem and one that the exact solution to is going to be very, very hard to find. We have to look at a lot of different options, upstream storage, an outlet. We're going to be doing that. We've been doing it for several years. I don't know what history is going to show will be the right way to address the flood, because I don't know how long the flood is going to last or how much worse it's going to get. I do know that it's going to get worse before it gets better, because the flood waters are still rising. That imaginary line on the wall is getting higher and higher off the floor each year. To help me make the right decision, I asked the Corps to enter into a contract with a leading research institution to develop a rational decision model for the situation. None of the normal assumptions on flood forecasting will work in a situation such as at Devils Lake. Normally, when you do probability modeling, you assume that what happens in 1 year is not related to what happens the next year. But because this is a closed lake, the water level that we have today has a very big bearing on what the water level is going to be next year. So we've got to do a different kind of probability analysis. There's been a lot of discussions of the conditions that were added to the appropriations act, and frankly, I don't think those conditions served us very well at all. At least in Washington, everyone seems focused on the conditions and not focused on the actual flooding. At least four times a week, I hear people come and talk to me about how I'm going to address the conditions, and they don't come and talk to me about how I'm going to address the flooding. I guess I'd like to keep everybody focused on how do we address the flooding, not how do we answer certain conditions. Because the real problem that we have to solve is the actual flood. The third point I'd like to make is that Devils Lake is going to overflow into Stump Lake, and that Stump Lake is going to overflow into the Sheyenne River, 100 percent certain that that is going to happen. What isn't certain is when. We know it's happened in the past. It could happen in the next few years, it could happen in 1,000 years. But we know it's going to happen. What we don't know is when. When that eventually happens, there's going to be an outlet from Devils Lake, and it's going to be an uncontrolled outlet, and we're going to lost the opportunity to minimize the environmental damage. There's not going to be an opportunity to mitigate downstream flooding. There's not going to be an opportunity to mitigate health effects on the people who are going to have to drink that water. When we have that ultimate situation, we're not going to be talking about an outlet any more, we're going to be talking about a spill lake. And I don't believe that anybody here wants that situation. I'm pretty sure the Canadians don't, and the Minnesotans don't, and the North Dakotans don't. I guess the standard I would like to use in addressing the flooding is the same one I've used for every other member of the committee and Congress, and that is, I'm going to try to do all that I reasonably can to protect the people of North Dakota, Minnesota and Canada. I have asked and I'm going to continue to ask the Corps to undertake all reasonable efforts to protect those people. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I'd like the Congress to remember three things over the next few months. First, there's a flood at Devils Lake right now. The second is the conditions that have been added I think increased our risks of getting the answer wrong, because we've got too many people focused on the conditions and not the flood. And third, that there is going to be an outlet from Devils Lake. There's been one in the past, and there's going to be one again. Mr. Chairman, you asked about the feasibility study. I'd be happy to answer any questions about that. I also have charts that I can explain the situation in more detail if you so desire. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Michael Armstrong, Associate Director for Mitigation for FEMA. STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. ARMSTRONG, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR MITIGATION, FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Mr. Armstrong. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Senator Wyden. This is my first appearance before you since this committee was kind enough to recommend my confirmation to the Senate earlier this year, and I'd like to just thank you again for this opportunity to serve in this capacity. Before I was confirmed by the Senate, I served as the regional director at FEMA in Region VIII, which includes North Dakota. In that capacity, I was asked to chair the interagency task force for the Devils Lake Basin. And my written testimony, which you have before you, talks about the work of this task force. I'd like to highlight several things, because I think it's important to know the context in which we are talking today, which is a different scenario than I encountered when I was first asked to chair a task force 2 years ago. At that time, the community had been studied repeatedly, but there was a sense that there was no coordination occurring between the various stakeholders, both at the governmental levels, at Federal, State and local, as well as people in the private sector and ordinary citizens in the Basin. Therefore, the mission of the task force was, and is, because we are continuing to meet and I am continuing to chair it, is to find and propose intermediate solutions to reduce the impacts of the high lake levels in the Basin, intermediate solutions to find as remedial actions that could be achieved within approximately 5 years after or along with disaster response efforts, but before the benefits from any long term engineered solution could be realized. From the very beginning, it was recognized that to achieve this mission, the task force effort would require the coordinated activity and commitment of numerous Federal, State and local government entities along with elected officials, private citizens, environmental groups, and representation from the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe. For this reason, the task force is operated with one key point in mind: that any solutions to be recommended could not involve a single agency response, but instead would require an approach that is multidisciplinary, multi-objective, multi-agency, bottom up and achieved through consensus building partnerships. Two years have passed since I was first appointed to serve as the chair of the task force. And since 1995, the members of the task force have pulled together to mitigate the flooding impacts in the Basin by leveraging Federal, State and local stakeholder resources. Some of the examples: all essential roads in the Basin have either been raised or are being raised above the rising lake level. Flood plain maps for the entire Basin were developed and all communities are now participating in the national flood insurance program. To date, 504 claims have been reported, helping those who were affected by the flooding to rebuild their lives. This has been an infusion of over $17 million to impacted residents. Waivers of the standard flood insurance policy have been issued by FEMA in order to allow homeowners and business owners who are threatened by imminent flooding to receive payments in advance of experiencing flood damage. These waivers have allowed 122 home and business owners to access the resources they needed to move out of harm's way and 344 additional claims are pending at this time. Twenty-one homes on the Spirit Lake Reservation have been relocated outside of the flood hazard area. The levees around the city of Devils Lake are being raised. Internal drainage systems are being put in place. Approximately 30,000 acre feet of upper basin storage has been created through various programs. A series of agricultural programs have been funded and put in place to assist farmers. Twenty lift stations in Ramsey County have been elevated. A sewage lagoon for the town of Minnewauken has been relocated. Lake water quality monitoring is ongoing. A long term lake stabilization study is funded and underway. And now we are considering the possibility of building an outlet. While the Federal Government has spent over $200 million to address issues, and I have listed some of the achievements that this task force has helped coordinate, nevertheless, it remains that we still have a crisis in Devils Lake. James Lee Witt, the director of our agency, has said that he has never seen anything like this situation. And as you know, Mr. Chairman, he has seen an extraordinary variety of disaster scenarios during his time as director of FEMA. The studies that have occurred number over 400 in this area. Our purpose is not to do another study, but to instead create a process whereby all stakeholders would come together to examine the problem from many angles, brainstorm alternatives and confront differences of opinion and reach consensus. Through this process, we have seen an incredible development of partnerships. The task force has succeeded in creating an understanding that no one solution or one level of government provides all the answers. But we believe by pursuing a combination of options, including removal and flood proofing of structures, alternative land usage and water storage, rehabilitation of infrastructure, local planning, the people of Devils Lake have sought permanent approaches to mitigation. And that's what makes today different from 2 years ago. We believe that there is a concerted effort to involve all levels of government, and that the levels of government have made a good faith effort to demonstrate that no one solution is being pursued. Given that, in this package of options, we believe that a construction of an outlet in a manner that is sensitive to environmental concerns and downstream impacts could complement the other efforts underway. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Sprynczynatyk? STATEMENT OF DAVE SPRYNCZYNATYK, NORTH DAKOTA STATE ENGINEER, BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA Mr. Sprynczynatyk. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Senator Wyden. Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. My name is Dave Sprynczynatyk. I'm the North Dakota State Engineer and the Secretary to the State Water Commission. The testimony I'm giving today is on behalf of Governor Ed Schafer. Governor Schafer asked me to extend his apologies to the committee for not being able to attend in person. Since 1993, Devils Lake has risen more than 20 feet, from an elevation of 1,422.6 to elevation 1,442.9. Today, it is the most serious, the most pressing flood problem facing North Dakota. Since 1993, the Federal, State, tribal and local governments, as well as the people of that area, have incurred more than $200 million in damages and flood fighting expenses. As the lake continues to rise, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forecasts that cumulative damages will grow to $370 million by the time the lake reaches elevation 1,450, less than 8 feet above its current level. This year alone, the lake rose five feet over last year's level. Most often, rivers will rise, flood adjacent areas and then recede. This is not the case with Devils Lake, which continues to rise relentlessly, engulfing land, homes, roads and everything else within its constantly growing borders. This is a progressive disaster that requires emergency action to gain control. The lake's natural outlet occurs when water rises another 15 feet and reaches elevation 1,457.5. It then overflows into the nearby Sheyenne River, which drains into the Red River, and ultimately into Lake Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay. Geologists have concluded that this natural spillage has occurred several times during the past 10,000 years. No one can predict what will happen with the lake next year. We have watched the lake rise well above the best scientific predictions for 5 years in a row. Just a few weeks ago, Mother Nature dumped another three to five inches of rain over the entire Devils Lake Basin. Every naturally occurring event, such as this, compounds our problems and reminds us of how little control we have over the situation. North Dakota's approach to managing the problem has been a comprehensive, three-part effort, including upper basin storage and management, protecting infrastructure and removing water from the lake. First, the Federal and State government have made significant efforts to hold water back within the upper areas of the basin. Upper basin water management, as we call it, has been ongoing for several years. But it alone is not the answer. Some people point the finger of blame to agriculture and suggest that closing wetland drains is the solution. Again, this is a grossly simplistic approach. Scientific evidence shows that the lake's level has ebbed and flowed for thousands of years, and overflowed naturally into the Sheyenne River long before man had any influence on the watershed. We firmly believe there is a limit to what we can accomplish through upper basin water management. Nevertheless, we continue to spend millions of dollars on upper basin management to restore holding areas and to create new ones. Second, we're protecting infrastructure around the lake. The greatest expenses have occurred as a result of relocating more than 200 homes, raising miles of roads, replacing several bridges and building levees and protecting utilities. This year alone, we had 17 highway elevation raising projects in the area, for a total cost of $30 million. More dirt and road work took place in the Devils Lake region this year than occurred in our State even during construction of the interstate highway system. Resources to continue these infrastructure efforts are limited. Yet we must continue pursuing these projects, not knowing if our efforts will ultimately be overtaken again by a lake that is rising uncontrolled. Our third effort is to remove water from the lake. This is where an outlet is necessary, because evaporation is the only current method of reducing the lake level. Even with a prolonged drought, it would take more than 10 years of normal evaporation for the lake to return to the pre-flood level of 1993. A managed outlet is technically feasible, and others have been completed successfully elsewhere in the country. Lake Pulaski in neighboring Minnesota is a good example, a managed lake outlet built in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Environmentally, the outlet can be constructed and operated to meet downstream State and Federal water quality standards, as well as international water quality objectives. The runoff to Devils Lake is the same as runoff from other agricultural areas in the State into the Sheyenne and Red River. Operating the outlet only during non-flood periods will eliminate additional downstream flooding in peak flood times. The entire basin would be managed like a reservoir, with water being stored when needed for downstream flood control, and released during non-flood periods. The benefit of the outlet has been questioned since it is limited in capacity. At the current lake level, any future rise will cost approximately $30 million per foot, much more than what was projected by studies completed by the Corps of Engineers several years ago, when the lake was nearly 25 feet lower, and the damages at that time per foot were much less than what we are experiencing now. A rise in 1998 similar to what we experienced this year could cause up to $150 million in additional damages. To the people who have lost nearly 60,000 acres of land, their homes and their livelihood to the lake since 1993, I can assure you that the situation is an emergency and that the outlet is very justified. Regarding the non-Federal cost share for the project, the 1997 State legislature unanimously passed a resolution of support for an outlet to Devils Lake, and provided sufficient funding for the cost share to the State Water Commission. During the hearings and the dozens of public meetings that have occurred across the State regarding Devils Lake, there has been considerable public debate. The State stands ready to provide funds as necessary. Finally, there seems to be some confusion regarding the relationship of Devils Lake to the Missouri River Basin. Devils Lake physically is not a part of the Missouri River Basin. It is part of the Hudson Bay-Red River drainage. An outlet from Devils Lake to its natural basin, the Red River, will in no way affect the Missouri River nor the Mississippi River. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your careful consideration of this outlet project that we believe will provide the relief necessary from this terrible unfolding disaster and emergency that plagues the Devils Lake region, the Spirit Lake Nation and the State of North Dakota. With my testimony I have also submitted a Devils Lake fact sheet that gives more detailed information. I have also provided to you a brochure entitled the Devils Lake Flood: Managing the Problem, which presents a comprehensive strategy that has been put forward and the document is signed by the co- chairs of the Lake Emergency Management Committee, Vern Thompson and Joe Belford, our Congressional delegation, Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, and Congressman Pomeroy and also by Governor Ed Schafer. Mr. Chairman, thank you again, and if you have any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer them. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Mr. Sprynczynatyk. Dr. Gary Pearson, Vice President, Dakota Prairie Chapter, National Audubon Society. We welcome you, Doctor. Why don't you proceed? STATEMENT OF GARY L. PEARSON, VICE PRESIDENT, DAKOTA PRAIRIE CHAPTER, NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY, JAMESTOWN, NORTH DAKOTA Mr. Pearson. Thank you very much, Chairman Chafee, Senator Wyden. It's going to be a little difficult to respond to an hour and a quarter of emotional statements on this project, but I will do what I can in the time allotted. The rising level of Devils Lake in recent years has caused millions of dollars of damage to roads and other developments and has created tremendous hardships for many people living near the lake. The problems are serious and they require solutions that are effective, are based on sound hydrologic and engineering analyses, and are economically justified and environmentally responsible. Unfortunately, the proposed emergency outlet from Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River fails, and it fails dismally, to meet any of these criteria. In considering the problems created by the high water levels at Devils Lake, it is necessary to recognize that we are dealing with a natural phenomenon, which has been transformed into a man-made emergency. As you have heard, Devils Lake has never been a stable lake. And over the last 4,000 years, it has been completely dry five times, it has overflowed to the Sheyenne River twice, and it has fluctuated between these extremes another eight times. As the level of the lake continued to decline in the first half of this century, roads, railroads and other developments encroached more and more on the dry lake bed. Simultaneously, agricultural development resulted in extensive wetland drainage throughout the watershed. It is now estimated that a minimum of 189,000 acres of wetlands with the capacity to store nearly a million acre-feet of water have been drained in the Devils Lake Basin. With evaporation and seepage, much of this storage was renewable. Instead, however, most of that water now finds its way directly into Devils Lake. We've been told that this project is economically feasible. We have seen no data to substantiate that. However, in 1994, the Corps of Engineers calculated an outlet would produce only 39 cents in benefits for each dollar of cost. Since then, nearly $200 million have been spent to move 300 homes. I point out those homes have been moved, there have only been about 20 structures that have actually been destroyed. People haven't actually lost their homes, they've moved them. And there have been $14 million in Federal national flood insurance payments made, and in comparison, there's been only $900,000 in premiums paid by those people receiving those benefits. The money has been spent to raise roads and dikes and implement other measures to minimize the damage that has resulted from the high water levels, thus reducing even further any benefits of an outlet. It is obvious, therefore, this proposed outlet is devoid of economic justification. I am also disappointed that no one of the previous witnesses told you that the outlet, had it been in operation when the lake began to rise in 1993, would have lowered the lake by only 13 inches by October 1995. The lake still would have risen more than five feet, and it would have risen another five feet since 1995. The fact is, the lake has been rising at five times the rate that an outlet would lower it. In other words, the proposed outlet simply wouldn't work to prevent flooding around the lake. Nor would it prevent the lake ultimately from overflowing into the Sheyenne River. And should that occur at 1,457 feet, it doesn't matter to those people downstream whether it be the water from the outlet or from the natural overflow. This project simply doesn't work to solve the problem. The Corps' preliminary emergency outlet plan notes specifically that environmental impacts of the proposed outlet have not been addressed. But they include destabilization, erosion and remodeling of the stream bed of the Sheyenne River, worsening of low water level situations at Devils Lake, increased mercury in downstream aquatic systems, persistent high sulfate levels in Lake Ashtabula during drought conditions, higher water treatment costs for cities using river water, an increased frequency, duration and magnitude of violations of State and international total dissolved solid standards. However, just last week, under pressure from our North Dakota Congressional delegation, President Clinton declared the Devils Lake outlet to be an emergency requirement. Senator Conrad now asserts that this somehow compels construction of the outlet without consideration of an effective and feasible alternative, and without addressing the environmental impacts until after they have occurred. In other words, without full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. We strongly disagree with this interpretation, because it is neither wise policy nor is it a legal requirement. Although the Corps' report was intended to be ``a common reference for discussions,'' despite widespread opposition, little factual information has been provided to the public and no forum has been established to permit meaningful public participation in decisions regarding the outlet. While the North Dakota Congressional delegation is telling Congress to abandon all thoughts of seeking authorization for an inlet, now it's interested only in an outlet from Devils Lake, politicians and proponents of the outlet are telling a very different story in North Dakota. And I would like to quote from attachment number 24 to my written submission. ``Dorgan and Conrad said Congress could change the legislation in question in later years.'' This was legislation regarding the outlet-inlet. Attachment number 27 to my statement, North Dakota Senators push for emergency inlet. ``An emergency inlet option is the only one opponents may buy, Conrad said.'' We were told this issue was resolved in an August letter from the Governor. Here is a story from the Fargo Forum September 26th, 1997. Senator Byron Dorgan and Senator Kent Conrad, both Democrats, said that the inlet had to be bargained away to win funding for the outlet. The inlet has been strongly opposed by Senator Christopher Bond, a Missouri Republican. ``Senator Bond refused to budget on the inlet, Conrad said, adding that securing money for the outlet was the most difficult fight in my Senate career.'' Dorgan said he will bring back the inlet debate in future sessions. But for now, he said, the outlet is what is needed. This is dated September 26th, 1997. By their own admissions, they are steadfastly pursuing a piecemeal strategy to construction of an inlet to Devils Lake. It is important to recognize that effective solutions are available and already are being implemented to deal with problems at Devils Lake. However, Governor Schafer said in July, ``State Water Commission Chairman voiced his misgivings that all the work and money being put into protecting infrastructure at Devils Lake and upper basin storage was taking pressure off the Corps to produce an outlet. I am concerned by putting all the Federal and State efforts into infrastructure, we are building ourselves into the position that efforts will be less intensive to secure an outlet. We are very intent on getting an outlet, and we don't want to reduce the pressure on getting an outlet by making an investment in the infrastructure.'' In other words, we don't want to look at other solutions to this problem. We just want our outlet. It is evident, really, that the real motivation behind North Dakota's pursuit of an ineffective and economically infeasible Devils Lake outlet has little to do with any emergency, but is simply another element of the State strategy for piecemealing together its plan for a $1.5 billion Garrison Diversion project. In fact, just this week, the U.S. Geological Survey released a reporting indicating that the odds are, Devils Lake will stabilize and then start to slowly fall over the next several years. I would like to submit a copy of that news story for the record. Senator Chafee. All right, fine. Mr. Pearson. Obviously, the most pressing emergency facing proponents of the Devils Lake outlet is getting it built before the lake starts to drop. In view of the many people downstream in North Dakota and other States and Canada who would be affected by the outlet, but who have been deprived of meaningful participation in decisions regarding the proposal, we strongly recommend that this committee reiterate to the President and the executive branch the requirements that Congress has specified in the fiscal year 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act must be met before construction may be initiated on the Devils Lake outlet. And these include that it be technically sound, economically justified and environmentally acceptable, and in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Doctor. Mr. Joe Belford, Lake Emergency Management Committee. STATEMENT OF JOE BELFORD, RAMSEY COUNTY COMMISSIONER, NORTH DAKOTA Mr. Belford. Senator Chafee, Senator Wyden, my name is Joe Belford. I am a Ramsey County Commissioner representing Ramsey and the Devils Lake Basin. Senator Chafee. That is, you are an elected official? Mr. Belford. That's correct, sir. I am also a co-chair of the Devils Lake Emergency Management Committee, which is made up of elected officials of the Devils Lake Basin. I also serve in another capacity, as vice chairman and the North Dakota representative of the Red River Basin Board, which includes members from North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and the province of Manitoba. And we organize for the purpose of managing water within the Red River Basin. I have with me Senator Vern Thompson and a co-chair of the Lake Emergency Management Committee, and the Mayor of Minnewauken, North Dakota; and Mayor Fred Bott, the Mayor of the city of Devils Lake. Before I start my presentation, which I have submitted to you, I would especially like to take issue with the comment that this is a man-made emergency. I would like that to be told to Mayor Thompson, whose community was eight miles from the lake in 1993. And now, he had to move his lagoon, because it was being inundated with water, and they're talking about building a levee for the city of Minnewauken. Or to our mayor, Fred Bott, who is overseeing a six mile levee being built at an additional cost of $43 million. I think you would have a hard time telling them that this is a man-made emergency. Also, Mr. Sprynczynatyk mentioned that for every foot, $30 million additionally would be spent in saving property and infrastructure around the lake. For the record, the lake is freezing up only two-tenths of an inch from its high this year. We had three inches of rain in our area again last weekend, which is bringing it up within two-tenths of an inch. So there's no question but it's going to continue to rise. I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify, and as has been indicated, we do have a very serious problem in Devils Lake. Being an elected official and being involved with this process every day, it is indeed a real devastating thing on the citizens of our communities throughout the Devils Lake Basin. And as indicated, it did start in 1993. Devils Lake has been a record lake for fishery and sports and other things going on within the Basin. So it's very beneficial to our community, but it's also very damaging. At the same time, our problems started at the same time that the Missouri and the Mississippi kicked off in 1993, and Senator Bond and I talked about that the last time we met, all the damages in his State, which were taken care of, as we had in the Red River Valley this year. And we continue to have heavy rain and snowfall throughout our area, as we had last winter. A Presidential disaster declaration has been signed for every year since 1993. The lake started out covering 40,000 acres, as was mentioned. And today, it's over 100,000 acres and continuing to rise. It took on more water this year than there was in the lake in 1993. Even though projects are going on in the upper basin for water retention, water management, there's a big CRP sign-up that has happened, there's a new one underway right now, wetlands restoration and other projects going on to continue to keep the water from coming into the lake. In fact, the Devils Lake Basin has their own water management plan and it's printed, and the committee is working to implement a lot of the plans and ideas to keep water from flowing into the lake. Nevertheless, it continues to rise. And I want to call your attention to that. It's a flood unlike a river flood. And the flooding at Devils Lake will continue to grow like a cancer, with no end. As indicated, over $200 million has been spent. The question we must ask is, do we want to manage water or let the water manage us? If we continue to let the water manage us, we are looking at another $260 million. And as a Republican, I don't want to come back here and ask you gentlemen for another $260 million again to help save our infrastructure and the problems that are facing our communities up there. So let's act and move along with our outlet. To illustrate how the lake has grown, Mr. Chairman, if I may just ask Senator Thompson for a couple of comments, and Mayor Bott, I would like to do that in the middle of my testimony. Senator Chafee. Well, that's all right, briefly. Because we've had a pretty thorough presentation of the situation. And I want to save some time. As I said, there's going to be a vote in half an hour. And if you want---- Mr. Belford. We'll be very brief, and we'll have you out of here in time, sir. Senator Chafee. It's not a question of us getting out of here at 11. It's a question of having an opportunity to thoroughly examine the witnesses. All right, if those gentlemen want to briefly say something. Mr. Thompson. Thank you again, Senator. Senator Chafee. First, Mayor, was the Doctor accurate? I think he indicated there have been 20 houses burned? Is that correct? Mr. Thompson. That's a fair statement. And there are a number that are being looked at, they have to file for permits to go ahead and have those burned. But if you look at your briefing book, on the cover there's a picture, if Mr. Sprynczynatyk would hold it up, there's an example of where the lake shore was. It moved eight miles. On the top of that picture is the community of Minnewauken. And the lake has moved eight miles. We didn't make that lake come. The lake encroached on us, and we've had to move and relocate our lagoon system for the town of 400 at a cost of over $800,000. We're basically broke, as political subdivisions. Our homes, our livelihoods, our futures are at risk. And this problem is not going away. There's other documents in there, and you can go ahead and look through them at your leisure, have your staff do it. But I think it's important that, as a State Senator, we had a public debate about this issue, with the portion of the emergency outlet in the legislature. We passed unanimously a resolution for the outlet. And we passed overwhelmingly the funding for the State portion to match the Federal commitment. Thank you. Mr. Belford. Now I'd like to call on Mayor Bott, who is the Mayor of Devils Lake, North Dakota. Mr. Bott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple other statements to talk about downstream from Devils Lake. I'm Mayor of Devils Lake. But I went to college and I have an aunt and uncle living in Valley City, the first city that would be impacted downstream from Devils Lake when the water flows. And I'm from Lisbon, North Dakota. My mother still lives there, that's the second city that would be impacted downstream when the water overflows Devils Lake, hopefully controlled, but uncontrolled, my relatives are living downstream. There is a picture in your briefing booklet, and there was a poster showing the lake level in 1965, and the lady standing there. If someone stood on the sign that showed the lake level last year compared to the lake level this year, if they were not at least five feet seven inches tall, they'd drown. The lake has gone up that much from last year. Two letters from my students. This is from a senior in one of my American Studies classes. It has to do with the inlet. If an inlet is not built, people will lose homes they've lived in for years. Devils Lake will no longer be a town that you can live in. There won't be any place for kids to go to school. They'll have to relocate all around the State. There won't be any high school games. You won't see the same faces in church that you've seen your whole life. And this is from a junior in my same class. Senator Chafee. That young lady that wrote that, I think she meant an outlet, didn't she? Mr. Bott. She meant an outlet, yes. And this one also. Senator Chafee. I'm not trying to----she said inlet---- Mr. Bott. She said outlet, I said inlet. Excuse me. [Laughter.] Mr. Bott. I always tell them not to make that same mistake. Obviously, I should take some of my own advice. This one also having to do with the outlet. Everyone watched as floods ravaged Grand Forks last summer. The Nation was shocked. Now Devils Lake is facing the same problem. If we don't act now, Devils Lake will be flooded over and we might not be so lucky. Lives could be lost. Beginning cost for an outlet is $5 million. Is that the value of lives of 8,000 people? You have families. What's the value of your mom's life? Your dad's? Your aunts, your uncles? Your daughters, your sons? Can you put a price on it? If we don't get the money, you just have. Thank you, Senator. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Mayor. Now, Mr. Belford, if you want to wind up. Mr. Belford. I'll continue on very briefly. Mr. Chairman, as a county commissioner, this is causing catastrophic impacts to our community and our local government. And just Tuesday night before I came down, and I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever been local elected officials or not, but we had 105 abatements to deal with of flooded land within the Devils Lake Basin. We had a room full of people asking for tax relief because of flooded properties and flooded lands. It's quite a process to go through and grant those abatements, which we had to, which affects schools and townships and our county government. And that's going on and on within our area. We've had hundreds of roads, as was indicated, and other concerns. Our Ramsey County rural sewage system has taken a real beating. We owe $950,000 worth of bonds on that. We're trying to figure out how to keep that process alive so that we can continue to get the revenue in. The Spirit Lake Indian Nation, which is our neighbor to the south, the road has been closed, creating an impact. Six thousand cars a day travel that road, have not been able to come to our community to do business, nor have they been able to come in for health and public safety and so forth. We are trying to come up with a comprehensive solution to our problem, as I have indicated. We have included a partnership of Federal, State and local governments working together for a holistic approach. The three-legged stool approach we talk about includes management of water in the upper basin, protection and moving of infrastructure, and an emergency outlet. And no one leg can stand on its own. That's the process that we are moving forward on. And I indicated, of the things that are going on in the upper basin, to hold water and manage water and try to keep the problem from becoming a real catastrophe. To protect infrastructure, we've moved dikes and homes and so forth, as was indicated. Over 5 million cubic yards of dirt have been moved to date to buildup our State road system. The emergency outlet is a management tool that will allow us to release the controlled quality and quantity of the water without harming our downstream neighbors. We believe it is an environmentally and economically smart project. A controlled emergency outlet can prevent a possible environmental and economic disaster down the road. The proposed west end outlet uses the best quality of water in Devils Lake. This water is very similar to what is in the Sheyenne presently. It would be released into the Sheyenne River during non-flooding or flood potential times. We are confident that the properly managed outlet will meet water quality standards of North Dakota, Minnesota and Manitoba. Senator Chafee. Mr. Belford, are you close to winding up here? Mr. Belford. I'll wind up here very quickly, sir. In closing, we as local elected officials need your help. We need to move as quickly as possible in this process. Our community is stressed out. We are financially impacted, and our community is gradually dying, unless we can resolve this issue. In fact, once again, I want you to look at that home. Our house is on fire, and we need your help. And I want to thank you for your time listening to me. And Senators, please, I beg you to move forward with this process as quickly as possible. We need help. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much, Mr. Belford. We appreciate your testimony here. Dr. Zirschky, I don't quite understand why you're not farther along with some just very standard matters. I noticed you objected to the conditions in the appropriations bill. But you've been in that department for a long time, and you know that the feasibility study isn't the most difficult thing in the world. It's pretty standard. We've set that up here. It is my understanding that hasn't even been completed so far. Is that correct? Mr. Zirschky. That's correct, Senator. And it's my fault for that. I don't say that necessarily as a bad thing. In 1995, we were faced with rising flood waters. And we were not going to have our feasibility study done in time. They should be very fast documents. In 1993, they were taking us over 5 years to get done. We've got that down now to less than 4 years to get done. But in 1995, we didn't have four more years to get this done. So General Genegan and I decided we would undergo a parallel process. We would continue trying to do the studies for the feasibility study, but make our priority the contingency plan efforts for how we deal with the rising flood waters. We're still using the same sort of philosophy in the feasibility study. We're going to make smart decisions. Every dollar that I've spent so far in North Dakota I've gotten a higher benefit than the cost I've incurred. The conditions, per se, those are things we would normally look at. I don't have a problem answering those questions. My only concern about those conditions, and everybody keeps talking about the conditions, and not the whole range of options that we're going to have to look at to solve this problem. I'd be delighted to have more wetlands and more upstream storage. That would be a big help. There is some range within which the outlet will be most effective. To make sure we make smart decisions in that regard, I've asked the Corps, we worked with the Department of Agriculture, to hire a research laboratory to help us develop a decision model that will then translate into sort of a simulation model. We can show you graphically, we build the outlet and we have this range of climate conditions, what's going to happen to the lake level. And I would be delighted to come back and brief the committee on those results. I'm not proposing anything rash. Senator Chafee. Well, as you know, this committee has to be guided by something. We can't just authorize funds without some kind of justification. So traditionally we've required that when an engineering project of this size is submitted or requested, that it be technically sound, economically justified, cost benefit ratio, you're familiar with all those, and environmentally acceptable. And none of those, it's my understanding, in none of them so far has the Corps demonstrated that these requirements are met. Mr. Zirschky. That one I don't know. Because the design is not done. I can demonstrate that every action we've taken so far meets those criteria. I guess what I consider unprecedented is to have that specifically spilled out for an emergency. I can't think of any case, unless I've been directed by Congress and it's been signed by the President, where I haven't followed those conditions in 4 years. It's not that those are bad conditions. It's that everybody is now talking about those conditions, and we're ignoring the upstream storage possibilities and other, dike, levee increases. I want us to get back to the flood, rather than the conditions. And I will make sure whatever we do is responsible. I promise you that. Senator Chafee. Now, Dr. Pearson says that, I can't remember the exact figures, but I think he said that if you constructed this outlet, and I don't know how big, what would be the diameter of one of the pipes for an outlet? Would it be a piped outlet, or would it be a canal of some type? Mr. Zirschky. I believe it would be a mixture. We would use some natural flow patterns and also some lift stations and pumping. And it would move about 200 million gallons per day, is the maximum of what we're designing. That's about two-thirds of what the city of Washington, DC uses. The constraint, however---- Senator Chafee. But I think Dr. Pearson said that it would, I think, what did you say, Doctor, lower it 12 inches? Mr. Pearson. I said if the outlet had been in operation when the lake began its accelerated rise in 1993, by October 1995, it would have lowered the lake by 13 inches. Senator Chafee. In other words, it would have met the increase, and indeed---- Mr. Pearson. No. No. It would have been only 13 inches lower than it would have been without the outlet. Senator Chafee. Oh, I see. What do you say to that, Mr. Zirschky? Mr. Zirschky. We might disagree with the amount of feet that it would be lower. We think there would be a much greater decrease. But the water level still would have risen. That's part of the rational decision model we're trying to put together, with an entity called the Energy and Environment Research Center, which is to do that simulation. I can pump millions of gallons of water out of Devils Lake, but I've got to find a place that can take that water. If I pump 200 million gallons of water into the Sheyenne River, I'm going to have a water quality problem, and I can probably, if the water conditions are correct, cause flooding downstream in the Sheyenne River. So I have to make sure that if we're going to build an outlet that the amount of water we send out, one, is going to make a difference. And there is some range of climate conditions that will make a big difference. But we also won't be transferring the problem from Devils Lake to some other town. Senator Chafee. Dr. Pearson says in his solutions that construction costs for the outlet are estimated at $34 million, with an annual cost of $1,500,000. The Corps estimates that an additional 63,000 acres would be flooded if the lake, and I'm going to ask you gentlemen this, Mr. Sprynczynatyk and Mr. Belford. Mr. Sprynczynatyk, I've butchered the pronunciation of your name, but I suspect I'm not the first. [Laughter.] Mr. Sprynczynatyk. Unfortunately, you're not the first, and Mr. Chairman, if you want to call me Spry, that's what everyone else does. Senator Chafee. Well, I think I will call you Spry. [Laughter.] Mr. Sprynczynatyk. Thank you. Senator Chafee. What happens, I'm curious, when I saw that, what happens when you're talking on a telephone and somebody says, would you please spell that for me? Mr. Sprynczynatyk. Interestingly, most often they say, can you spell it, and I say certainly. [Laughter.] Senator Chafee. Well, I'm going to ask you gentlemen, then, including Mr. Armstrong, to reply to what Dr. Pearson says, and then my time is up, and I want to give time for questions to Senator Wyden. I'll just repeat that briefly. An additional 63,000 acres would be flooded if the lake were to rise to 1,455 feet, which is I guess the maximum, or if there is a maximum. In any event, and then he goes into the value of the crop land. And whether his figure is accurate or not, I don't know, therefore if the full crop land price of $557 an acre were paid, you could buy up all that land for $35 million and have a wetland"
