The subcommittee met at 10 a.m., in West Fargo City Commission Chambers, Hon. Byron Dorgan (chairman) presiding. Present: Senator Dorgan. opening statement of senator byron l. dorgan Senator Dorgan. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to begin. I'm Senator Byron Dorgan chairman of the Energy and Water and Appropriations Subcommittee. This is a formal hearing of the subcommittee. We'll keep the record open for 2 weeks for anyone who wishes to submit formal comments for the hearing record. You can submit them to my office if you wish. The purpose of this hearing is to evaluate the change that is proposed by the North Dakota Department of Health to increase the allowable sulfate levels in the Sheyenne River. The State's Devils Lake outlet is scheduled to begin operating at a higher capacity sometime this summer, early summer, and I understand that that is the basis for the Department of Health's position to increase the sulfate levels. Let me say for the purposes of Devils Lake I support all the efforts that we can make to take water off of the lake as you know. I have funded proposals in the past to take water off for irrigation purposes. I have included, I think, the single largest appropriation that has ever been moved from our subcommittee, exclusive of the hurricane Katrina issues, to the Corps of Engineers some $90 plus million 1 year ago. I included that is now available and now being used to increase the levee at Devils Lake. That is the largest appropriation that I have ever made for one single project. So the question isn't does the delegation or do I support what is going on in Devils Lake. We have spent years and years raising roads, raising levees, and doing all the things to try to mitigate the flooding in Devils Lake. That includes supporting an outlet and it includes supporting the building of a State outlet. The question today is, with the proposal to increase the level of the outlet, which I believe will result in taking off somewhere around 3 to 4 inches from the lake a year if it's operated at what is expected to be the levels expected to operate. The question is, are there consequences to that? If so, what are the consequences? What should we understand about those consequences for others? It may be there are consequences, and we need to understand what they are in order to make judgments about them. So one of the reasons that I decided finally to hold a hearing is I had delivered to me a petition with some 700 names on it, residents of particularly Valley City but the surrounding region as well, indicating that not enough was known about this. They wanted to understand more. As I began to look into it, I agree. I don't understand all the consequences of it either. I think all of us need to understand what the risks are, if any. What are the consequences, if any, and that does not diminish our intent and interest in addressing the Devils Lake flooding issue. It is chronic flooding, and we've spent years of the State government and Federal Government working on this. We have spent a massive amount of money working on it, and yet the lake continues to rise. I have no interest nor would I expect other public officials to have an interest in transferring problems from one region of the State to another region of the State. If that were the case, that would be not be acceptable. I don't know that that's the case, but this hearing will provide us a basis of information with which to judge that. I want to thank all of you for being here. I know that you have prepared testimony that will be part of the permanent record as well. What I would like to do is call on the Governor and the health department first. I believe Mayor Walaker has to leave at some point during this hearing, and then we'll have statements from the witnesses. I will ask questions. Following which I will have an open microphone period, and we will ask if you have things you wish to say. Come and state your name and so that we have your name for the record. Again, I appreciate this opportunity, and I look forward to the testimony. Governor Hoeven. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HOEVEN, GOVERNOR, STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Governor Hoeven. Senator, thank you, and it is good to be with you and certainly our mayors and everyone here present. We just had a media avail with Mayor Walaker, Mayor Mattern, and Mayor Fred Bott. Mayor Mary Lee Nielson of Valley City is actually on her way to Washington, DC so she wasn't able to join us otherwise would have been present with us as well. I think it really reflects the great joint effort and cooperation between the communities and the State of North Dakota. Because when it comes to water management and flood protection in the Red River Basin, it's very important we're all working together and that's exactly what's going on. And so I also appreciate your help and your support in this effort as you mention your support for the Devils Lake outlet and its operation. It's much appreciated and so I thank you for that. Of course, today we're talking about increasing the flows out of the outlet and what I need to emphasize right up front that is very much about protecting the downstream communities on the Sheyenne. It is very much about protecting the downstream communities on the Sheyenne both in terms of water quality and to prevent flooding as much as it is to help with Devils Lake and flooding in the lake region basin. And so we're going to go through that a little bit. We've got Dave Glatt here who is chief of the Environmental Section from the North Dakota Department of Health. He's going to go through in detail this is another good opportunity to do just what he's been doing, which is holding hearings in and around the basin and Devils Lake and Valley City and other places, not only to provide information but to hear from people as well, so this is an ongoing process both the Federal entities such as yourself and others, the A--U.S. Fish and Wildlife, and there's a long list, which I've included in my comments, but also the State agencies water commission, department of health, to really get information out there so people understand that this is an effort to protect upstream and downstream, and it's a cooperative effort in terms of water quality and flood prevention throughout the Red River Basin. Of course, what's necessitating increasing the flows out of Devils Lake is the rise in the lake level. Since 1993--and I know you are well aware of much of this, but since 1993 Devils Lake has risen 27 feet, 27 feet. It's now at lake elevation of more than 1,450, and they're talking about another 3 feet this year, and we're only 8 feet from the point where we have an uncontrolled spill out of the east end where we truly have water quality issues and, of course, that would create flooding. So even building some type of control structure over there still leaves us with the water quality issues. And as I say, we're only 8 feet away with potentially 3 feet of that occurring in the rise this year. So the effort is through the west-end outlet to increase the flows so that we prevent flooding. We don't have water coming out during the spring as now we're very concerned about flooding obviously throughout the basin, so it's both for flood protection and prevention. But then also to make sure that we manage the water quality, for example, its use of sulfates which has been a discussion in something that the health department is working on very carefully. There is no plan to change the sulfate standard essentially below Valley City or Lake--Baldhill Dam all the way down and through and past Fargo. There's no intent to change that sulfate standard. It would still be the stream standard of 450 milligrams per liter, which is actually better than the Canadian drinking water standard, which is 500 parts--500 milligrams per liter, so even untreated it's better than their drinking water standard. Making sure we cover all State health department requirements and EPA requirements, but even in addition to that to make sure that everybody's on board and that any and all concerns are addressed where all the State through the water commission is working with the communities along the Sheyenne to make sure that whatever water treatment plans and preparations they have both now and for the future that we're a partner with them. To have it set the way they want. Example, Valley City is in process of upgrading their water treatment plant because they need more capacity. That's a good thing, Jon Cameron sitting interviews here. He will speak to it. We partnered with them to add reverse osmosis, which will take sulfates out, so they're--actually their water quality will be better than it is now. Fargo and West Fargo are working together on water treatment options for the Fargo/West Fargo metro area. That's fantastic. I want to commend them for that joint effort. They don't currently draw water from the Sheyenne as their primary source, but they use it as a back-up source, and so as they look at water treatment development, same thing. We're going work--we're going--the State's going work with them to make sure that we partner with them in whatever solution they want be that reverse osmosis or whatever they may want or need to make sure that they have their treatment set the way they want it. And so that's the approach we're taking, but it's the approach we must take. Same thing with any erosion issues, I know there's been some discussion that the West Fargo diversion if there's more water coming through, more days when the water's coming through could create some erosion issues. We'll work with them to help them rip rap the West Fargo diversion. So really it's a kin to the same kind of work that we're undertaking with permanent flood protection for the region. This has to be a comprehensive approach. It has to be a basin-wide approach. It has to be a local, State, Federal approach. It's very important. And so I think to the extent we could really again discuss that today and continue to work together as we are that this is useful, and so it's good to be here, and I'll wrap up there. prepared statement I know Dave's got some comments and also Mayor Walaker and then, of course, we do want to hear the update from the National Weather Service, which is coming out this morning as well on the flood. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John Hoeven Good morning Senator, good morning mayors, ladies and gentleman. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the operation of the Devils Lake Outlet and its importance--not just to the community of Devils Lake and the Devils Lake area, but also to downstream interests. We have worked hard to provide information to all concerned regarding the operation of the Devils Lake Outlet, and I thank you, Senator Dorgan, for your support of the outlet. Attached to my testimony are three of your letters in support of operating the Devils Lake Outlet. First and foremost, I want to make clear that the State of North Dakota is committed to protecting the interests of Valley City, Lisbon, west Fargo, Fargo and other communities along the Sheyenne and Red River, as well as Devils Lake. In fact, operating the Devils Lake Outlet is as important to protecting downstream communities' water quality and preventing downstream flooding, as it is to helping mitigate flooding in the Devils Lake region. Rather than transferring any problem from one region of our State to another region of our State, operating the Devils Lake Outlet at up to 250 cfs is designed to protect water quality for communities downstream of Devils Lake. Since 1993, Devils Lake has risen by 27 feet and it is forecasted to set another record high this year. At a lake elevation of 1,450 feet, it is now only about 8 feet from an overflow out of Stump Lake on the east end. Such an overflow would initiate a discharge of the poorest quality, highest-sulfate water overland to the Sheyenne River. Therefore, instead of lower sulfate water at manageable levels, downstream communities--including Valley City, Lisbon, west Fargo, and Fargo--would receive high sulfate water at more than 2,200 milligrams per liter. The State's objective with the west-end outlet is to minimize or avoid the effects of a discharge from Devils Lake into the Sheyenne that would create problems downstream from either a flooding or water quality standpoint. We are absolutely committed to working with the downstream communities in that effort, just as we are working to mitigate flooding in the Devils Lake Basin. Dave Glatt, chief of the State's Environmental Health Division, is here to provide more specifics. He and our health department have been working with other agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Canadian officials, and as you know, your office as well, Senator Dorgan, to properly manage operation of the Devils Lake Outlet. At the local level, officials from the North Dakota Department of Health, the State Water Commission, and the Department of Game and Fish have also provided information to city representatives from Devils Lake, Valley City, Fargo and other communities. These officials have conducted well-attended public hearings in Devils Lake, Valley City and Bismarck; and, in addition, participated in a local public health board meeting and open public forum in Valley City. Information on the Devils Lake outlet, moreover, is readily available in great detail on the Department of Health and State Water Commission Web pages. I also want to underscore that the Outlet is just one part of a three part plan to address Devils Lake flooding. That effort includes mitigation (diking and raising roads); water retention; and the outlet. In terms of water retention, Devils Lake has grown from less than 50,000 acres to more than 160,000 acres. Clearly there is a huge amount of water in essence stored in the Lake Region--more than 100,000 acres of water. Also, more than $500 million has been spent by local, State, and Federal entities to mitigate rising waters in the Devils Lake region, including raising roads and diking. An additional $150 million will be spent over the next 18 months. Certainly, the $90 million you secured recently will help raise dikes around the city of Devils Lake again, but it will not address the issue of an east-end overflow with its downstream impacts. That is why we must increase operation of the outlet in a controlled manner. To assist in the operation of the Devils Lake outlet, the North Dakota Legislature created a 10-member advisory committee, including State, county, and tribal members. Its management is not determined by any one individual, but rather to a group of concerned and involved citizens, each representing the interests and concerns of communities throughout the affected region. These committee members develop an annual operating plan, which considers factors such as spring runoff and flooding potential, as well as downstream impacts on water quality and stream bank erosion. We did not last year, and we will not, operate while downstream communities are facing flooding. In addition, the State also continues to conduct complete chemical analyses of Devils Lake and the Sheyenne and Red rivers on a regular schedule to ensure that they comply with all acceptable EPA and State standards. In regard to sulfates, the stream standard for the Sheyenne River below Baldhill Dam will remain 450 milligrams per liter, as it has always been. The State Water Commissions objective is to keep sulfates on the Sheyenne through downstream communities below that level. To put that in perspective, at 450 parts per million on the Sheyenne River, our stream sulfate standard at Valley City is in fact better than the Canadian drinking water standard, which is 500 parts per million. Although the scientific evidence indicates that we are well within acceptable levels, we want communities downstream to be assured of quality municipal water supplies and are doing what we can to help. To that end, the North Dakota Department of Health and the State Water Commission have been working closely with the community of Valley City, not just to mitigate the possibility of a major flood, but to improve Valley City's water supply system. To emphasize North Dakota's commitment to Valley City's interests, last summer the State awarded nearly $12 million in direct assistance for a new municipal water supply system. At present, the city's water is treated by a conventional lime- softening treatment process that does not remove sulfates and minerals. The new facility, however, will remove sulfates and other dissolved minerals, resulting in significantly higher water quality than the community's existing water treatment plant now provides. Moreover, the new facility meets not only the city's immediate needs, but also its future needs as a growing North Dakota community. Similarly, we are committed to operating the outlet in a manner that manages sulfate levels in west Fargo and Fargo at levels well within the acceptable limit established by the EPA and the State of North Dakota. To that end, we were pleased to learn that Fargo and west Fargo are working together on water treatment for their growing communities, and we will do what we can to help them reach their goals, just as we are doing in Valley City. If they should need technical or financial assistance with their project, including reverse osmosis technology, we are committed to working with the cities to help. Likewise, we will help if additional rip rap is needed for the west Fargo diversion. Again, I want to underscore our commitment to protect the interests not only of Devils Lake, but of Valley City, Lisbon, Fargo, west Fargo, and all of our communities along the Sheyenne and Red Rivers. Working together, there is much we can, and will, accomplish. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. Governor, thank you very much. I'm going to call on Mayor Walaker before Mr. Glatt. I believe the mayor has to leave in 10 to 15 minutes. So, Mayor Walaker, thank you for being here. STATEMENT OF DENNIS WALAKER, MAYOR, CITY OF FARGO Mayor Walaker. First of all, it's a privilege to be here, Senator Dorgan. The press conference in the--this coming from National Weather Service and we have to be there by 10:45. I'm Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker, and I'd like to thank Senator Dorgan and the city of West Fargo for hosting this subcommittee hearing regarding the Emergency Rule action on the Sheyenne River. First, I think some background information would be helpful to understand Fargo's position on this matter. The city of Fargo utilizes both the Red and Sheyenne for its municipal water supply. We think having two surface water sources is a good water supply planning and historically, we've utilized them both independently and in combination for a variety of reasons related to water quality. And the Fargo water system presently provides drinking water to the city of Fargo and a significant user, the Cass County Rural Water Users District, serving a total population of approximately 120,000 people. In addition, we have recently begun discussions with the city of West Fargo to explore the possibility of a regional water supply solution, and it's my understanding that's moving forward. There's a possibility that we could treat water and serve the city of West Fargo and have maybe a process where we could work together that would benefit both cities and that seems to be very important to us and very important to them because the cost of doing the other part of the process is extremely expensive and basically redundant. Our water treatment plant was constructed in 1997 with treatment technologies that were selected based on historic water quality in the Red and Sheyenne Rivers. As far back as 1975, the USGS historic water quality data on the Sheyenne River at West Fargo shows an average sulfate concentration around 200 milligrams per liter with an occasional peak of 300. The EPA secondary standard for sulfates in drinking water is 250 milligrams per liter, and the North Dakota Department of Health's recommended upper limit for sulfates in drinking water is also 250 milligrams per liter. So based on historic water quality, it wasn't necessary for our treatment plant to include technologies for sulfate removal. And since the plant began operating in 1997, we've been able to routinely meet the EPA secondary standard and the North Dakota Department of Health's recommended upper limit for sulfate concentration in our drinking water. The Sheyenne River is a critical part of Fargo's water supply and drought mitigation plans. As such, we have two perfected permits, one for natural flows in the Sheyenne and one for stored water in Lake Ashtabula. In addition, Fargo is an active participant in the Red River Valley Water Supply Project to bring Missouri water to eastern North Dakota during periods of water shortages or drought. The preferred option utilizes Lake Ashtabula and the Sheyenne River. Fargo's participation is, in part, predicated on the water quality that allows us to continue to meet the EPA secondary standard and North Dakota Department of Health upper recommended limit for sulfates in drinking water with our current treatment technologies. I want to emphasize this is extremely important, and we need to emphasize the next statement I'm going to make. We certainly--Fargo recognizes the threat of flooding to the city of Devils Lake and surrounding areas. We also recognize the potential downstream impacts of an uncontrolled overflow from Devils Lake. So it is our desire to work cooperatively toward a mutually beneficial solution to address the flooding threat in Devils Lake and address the potential downstream water quality impacts on water systems that utilize the Sheyenne River as a water supply. The Emergency Rule increased the allowable sulfate concentration in the Sheyenne River, measured at a .01 miles downstream of Baldhill Dam, to 750 milligrams per liter. Our review of historic USGS water quality data indicates that there is little or no change in Sheyenne River sulfate concentrations between Baldhill Dam and West Fargo. However, it's important to note that the Emergency Rule did not change the stream standard and correspondingly allowable sulfate concentration in the Sheyenne River at West Fargo remains at 450 milligrams per liter. To that end, we have estimated the modifications necessary to our water treatment system to reduce the sulfate concentration from 450 milligrams per liter in the Sheyenne River to 250 milligrams per liter in our drinking water would cost upwards of $45 million. We'd hope that an operational strategy can be developed for the Emergency Outlet that can control the maximum sulfate concentration in the Sheyenne River at West Fargo to the historic maximum level around 300 milligrams per liter. If that isn't possible, we would like to see a financial assistance program to be applied equivalently to all downstream water systems for the additional treatment upgrades necessary to reduce sulfate concentrations in drinking water to meet the EPA secondary standard and that the North Dakota Department of Health's upper recommended limit. Once again, we want to thank you for the opportunity to present our concerns. We would be happy to answer questions--or somebody will be here to answer questions, and we also have staff present to address the technical matters. And, in summary, until we get some more information on what you consider, you know, 300 is a figure that--is it arbitrary? Yes. Does it create problems? Right now we have a--what we consider an extremely good water system in the city of Fargo and, of course, there is some fear about it changing, but we also want to be able to communicate to the general public exactly what they can look forward to or what's going to happen and so forth. But the bottom line is very simple; we will work with our communities together to come up with a solution to this problem. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I understand you do have to leave, and I'm sorry about that, but I understand your reasons for it so I appreciate your testimony. Is there someone here who can answer questions on your behalf? Mayor Walaker. Yes, Bruce Grubb is here. Matter of fact, I can put his up--since mine's on the floor. No. We thank--we thank you, Senator Dorgan, for this opportunity. We also fish up in Devils Lake. We understand that, you know, the whole process. I mean, it's an extremely huge problem. I mean, nobody--I repeat nobody--knew then where this was going in 1993. They didn't have a clue and to go over that, and now it's probably got its own weather system right now as far as moisture is concerned. Senator Dorgan. Well, in 1991 they had a committee called the Lake Preservation Committee because there was too little water in Devils Lake and it's a big fishing industry. Mayor Walaker. Well, they're very appreciative of Jake. Governor Hoeven. Excuse me, Senator. Senator Dorgan. Yes. Governor Hoeven. I'll be going with Mayor Walaker to get the flood update, but you've got Dave Glatt here and others who can cover. Senator Dorgan. He will speak for you? Governor Hoeven. Yes. [The information follows:] North Dakota State Water Commission--North Dakota Department of Health The State of North Dakota wants to thank you for your long term support of the Devils Lake Outlet program. We hope this response answers any questions you may have about the present situation. As you know, Devils Lake has risen 27 feet since 1993. In terms of acreage, Devils Lake has increased from less than 50,000 acres to more than 160,000 acres during this time period. Available hydrologic outlooks suggest that water levels will continue to rise. That means more than 100,000 acres of land has been flooded. The National Weather Service Hydrology Outlook released on March 5, 2010 states that there is a 90 percent probability that Devils Lake will reach 1,452.1 feet by September 2010. The volume increase from the current elevation of 1,450.1 feet to 1,452.1 feet is 346,500 acre-feet. An additional area of approximately 19,500 acres will be inundated. If an additional 1.6 million acre-feet of water enters Devils Lake, water would overflow into Tolna Coulee. Coupling the prediction for this year with the fact that Devils Lake had an estimated inflow of 585,000 acre-feet in 2009, as well as inflows greater than 100,000 acre-feet in 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006, suggests that water levels will continue to rise at a rapid pace, threatening overflow if no action is taken. The current elevation of Devils Lake is 1,450 feet mean sea level, only about 8 feet away from an overflow out of Stump Lake. If the rise of water into Devils Lake continues, spillover could occur through the Tolna Coulee into the Sheyenne River. The water involved in this discharge would constitute the poorest quality, highest sulfate water in the Devils Lake system. If this occurred, downstream communities, including Valley City, Lisbon, West Fargo, and Fargo, could receive a large volume of high sulfate water beginning at more than 2,200 milligrams per liter. To prevent this potential outcome, we plan to use the Devils Outlet along with mitigation and water retention methods to reduce water levels in the Devils Lake Basin. Operation of the Devils Lake Outlet is the most manageable way for North Dakota to reduce the risk of the overflow of Devils Lake, and in doing so, protects downstream interests. If the Devils Lake Outlet were operated at 250 cubic feet per second for 210 days per year, 7.7 inches would be removed with a lake elevation of 1,450 feet mean sea level. The outlet can potentially remove 110,000 acre/feet of water annually. Per your request concerning how many inches of water the Devils Lake Outlet would remove if Devils Lake reached 1,455 feet mean sea level, 5.8 inches would be removed with continuous operation. Although operational constraints could limit these amounts, this demonstrates the ability of the outlet to greatly reduce water levels in the Devils Lake Basin over time. One of the methods you suggest to reduce runoff into the Devils Lake Basin is landowner participation in a State program designed to pay landowners to retain water on their land. There are already several State and Federal programs serving this purpose including the State Water Commission's Extended Storage Acreage Program (ESAP), which pays landowners to store water that would otherwise have contributed to flooding around Devils Lake. Over the past 10 years, the ESAP program has been storing about 800 acre-feet at a cost of about $12,000 per year. Last August, the State Water Commission approved a 10 year extension of the ESAP program, allocating $142,250 in funds, Unfortunately for the region's agribusiness sector, there is already a great deal of involuntary storage of water on land throughout the Devils Lake Basin. An important factor worth noting is that farmers are often reluctant to flood portions of their fields, fearing inability to access the balance of their acreage, reduced crop yield, delayed planting, and long term negative impacts to the soil. There are already a number of ways in which water is being retained in the Devils Lake Basin. Devils Lake itself has increased 110,000 acres since 1993, from 50,000 acres to 160,000 acres. Satellite imagery taken on November 4, 2009 showed that there are 112 square miles of surface water in the Devils Lake Basin not including Devils Lake and Stump Lake. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service has perpetual easements on 165,000 acres in five counties alone in the Devils Lake Basin. Prior to implementation of the Swampbuster program in 1986, farmers were allowed to use legal drains to drain wetland areas, often with Federal concurrence and cost-sharing, but since 1986 there has been little additional drainage of wetlands. The further retention of water on highly productive, valuable farmland would cause grave agricultural losses. In addition to potential economic, social, and legal barriers, many studies by third party experts have shown that use of even a massive water retention program would not have a substantial impact on reducing drainage into Devils Lake. As an example, a Devils Lake Upper Basin Storage Evaluation was conducted for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, by WEST Consultants, an independent organization from California. This study, conducted in 2001, found that if all the depressions that were identified by WEST as possibly drained were restored for wetland storage, there would be 127,835 acre/feet of storage space available. Use of this potential space would result in a reduction of 23,841 acre-feet of runoff into Devils Lake. At present, a reduction in input of 23,841 acre-feet would result in a less than 2 inch reduction in water levels. Wetland restoration is not a complete answer to this problem, and would be a costly step that would serve as only a small contributing factor to a larger solution. In response to your inquiry, we would not recommend that the State Legislature pursue measures that would force landowners within the Devils Lake Basin to retain more water on their productive farm land. We certainly appreciate further ideas from you concerning potential Federal participation to turn off the ``faucet'' of upper basin inflows. Weighing heavily in our decision to promote the greatest possible use of the State's Devils Lake outlet is the immediacy of potential overflow into the Tolna Coulee. The water level at which water from the Devils Lake basin could overflow into the Tolna Coulee is 1,458 feet. Using a United States Geological Service stochastic model which assumes that Devils Lake will reach 1,452 feet by June 30, there is a 10 percent chance that Devils Lake will reach an elevation of 1,458.1 feet by 2019 if the outlet is not used. These numbers demonstrate the fact that there is a relatively large possibility that Devils Lake could overflow into the Tolna Coulee, and ultimately into the Sheyenne River within 10 years if no preventative steps are taken. Under the same United States Geological Service stochastic model which assumes that Devils Lake will reach 1,452 feet by June 20, 2010, if the outlet operates at 250 cubic feet per second, constrained to meet the 450 milligram per liter sulfate level below Lake Ashtabula, there is a 5 percent chance of the lake reaching 1,458.4 feet mean sea level in 2019. Operation of the Devils Lake Outlet would reduce the risk of an overflow by approximately one-half, and would also reduce the volume and duration of a spill should one occur. Many factors have been considered with regards to implementation of the Devils Lake Outlet, one of the foremost being the maintenance of water quality standards. Ensuring appropriate sulfate levels is one of the most critical aspects to monitor during this process, and the State of North Dakota is working to take necessary steps to ensure that sulfate levels do not exceed maximum limits as a result of outlet operations. To ensure the 450 milligrams per liter limit below Lake Ashtabula, State agencies will conduct extensive monitoring and management of Devils Lake Outlet operations. Real time conductivity measurements will be recorded at the gage locations, and will be made continuously available to the public. These measurements will provide a real time estimate of the total dissolved solids and sulfate concentrations for operational decisions. During ice free conditions, water will be sampled for sulfates 4 days a week at the Devils Lake Outlet, and once a week along the Sheyenne River at locations near Warwick, Cooperstown, Lake Ashtabula, Valley City, Lisbon and Horace. The North Dakota State Water Commission, with review and input from the statutorily established Outlet Advisory Committee, will control the release of water to ensure that water quality standards are met. Moreover, the outlet will not be operated when the releases would contribute to flooding downstream in the Sheyenne or Red River. Since 2007, Valley City has been in the process of upgrading their 35-year-old water treatment plant as part of an effort to meet a 2014 EPA compliance deadline. Valley City officials approached the State of North Dakota with a request for assistance in meeting the EPA deadline, whereupon $12.5 million of loan and grant funds were provided for the project. The State of North Dakota has funded many cities with upgrades to satisfy EPA requirements and reduce the use of chemical additives during the treatment process. North Dakota is dedicated to providing its citizens with a high quality, of sufficient quantity water supply. The State will continue this effort with other cities, including West Fargo and Fargo, in dealing with water supply issues. In summary, there are no easy solutions for the flooding problem in the Devils Lake basin. Be assured, the State of North Dakota is taking all necessary and reasonable steps to implement the most effective and safe measures to reduce or eliminate this persistent, costly problem. Senator Dorgan. Let me ask you one question before you leave, however, if I might. It relates to the mayor's suggestion and the press thing that you referred to. If Fargo, for example, and others determine that they need for their own reasons to build a $45 million treatment plant, where would the money come from for that and is there a commitment from the State to fund that? Governor Hoeven. Really to be to add reverse osmosis to whatever they do and they've estimated roughly that could cost $45 million so we'd work with them to do that. Now, again, we're going to have to see what--we're not changing the stream standard, and Dave can talk to that, but we'll have to see what the sulfates are and if that's an issue, yes, then the State's going to work with them to do what they need to do whether it's reverse osmosis as an add to their treatment plant or whatever joint solution they're undertaking anyway then we'll partner with them. Senator Dorgan. I understand, but I think what the mayor was suggesting was if they feel as a result of the science and the understanding of the science that they need to do something here that he refers to as costing $45 million. One of the interests of this subcommittee, because we spend a lot of money on water issues around the country, is where will that funding come from? Governor Hoeven. Oh, we're going to work with them through the Water Commission, and we'd love some help from the Federal participation as well, but we're certainly going to stand with them because this is about making sure that we take a comprehensive approach to solving this issue not only for Devils Lake but all the communities, Fargo, West Fargo, Valley City as we were--have already done. So, yes, we're going to be there working with them, and we'd love to have you as a partner as well in that bonding effort depending on what it's going-- but if it's $45 million reverse osmosis, we're certainly going to work through the Water Commission help with that as we did in the past. Senator Dorgan. Well, I understand you have to leave and with your permission I'm going to send some written questions from the committee to you in those areas, but I appreciate very much your being here. Governor Hoeven. Yes. And, again, I appreciate your support in the Devils Lake outlet and this operation. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. Thank you. Mr. Glatt. STATEMENT OF L. DAVID GLATT, CHIEF, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SECTION, NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Mr. Glatt. Good morning, Senator. Thank you for having this opportunity to talk to the subcommittee. It's nice to sit sometimes on this side of the hearing table as we go through this, but my name's Dave Glatt. I'm chief of the Environmental Health Section for the North Dakota Department of Health. Our department is responsible for many of the environmental protection programs implemented in the State. A number of these programs are provided through primacy agreements with and oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I'm here today to provide a brief overview of the current process associated with the water quality standards being proposed and considered by the department. The issue before the department today relates to the proposed change in the sulfate standards from 450 milligrams per liter to 750 milligrams per liter for a portion of the Sheyenne River from its headwaters to .1 miles downstream of Baldhill Dam. It is important to note that the proposed Sheyenne River sulfate standard change is part of a larger, EPA-required, triennial water quality standard review. The triennial review includes changes to the existing standards that reflect the current science and status of water quality throughout North Dakota. The department is currently in the middle of a required public review and comment period set to end on March 1, 2010. Upon completion of the comment period and prior to making a final decision regarding the proposed water quality standards change, the department is required to provide a written response to all comments. After the department has made a final determination regarding the standards, it must seek review and approval from the following: The North Dakota Water Pollution Control Board, which is comprised of representatives that include private citizens, municipalities, State agencies, Federal agencies, agriculture and industry. We're also required to get approval from the North Dakota State Health Council. Members include the medical committee, private citizens, municipalities and industry--industry as well. We're also required to go through the North Dakota Office of the Attorney General. We're also required to go through--get approval from the Administrative Rules Committee where basic--where they are comprised of legislators on that committee. And, finally, after that then we are required to go to the U.S. Department of Protection Agency, which they review our response to comments, the science, and determine whether or not those--our determinations can be supported or needs to be changed. It's important to note that the water quality standards will be considered finally--final only after review and approval by all of the previously mentioned agencies and boards. In formulating any proposed decision, whether it is concerning a permit or rule, the department must follow prescriptive legal requirements and applicable science. In the issue being discussed today, the department has evaluated and continues to evaluate the following: Historical and current water quality data. For several decades we have either conducted activities as part of department duties or partnered with other State and Federal agencies in the collection of water quality data from locations in Devils Lake, the Sheyenne River and the Red River to the Canadian border. This continuing effort includes the collection of samples for laboratory analysis. The State Water Commission and the department also have partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey to install gauging stations at seven locations from the headwaters of the Sheyenne River to below the Baldhill Dam, providing web-accessible data on a 24/7 basis. Additional USGS water quality and quantity stations are located along the Sheyenne and Red Rivers to the Canadian border. I also state that all our data, water quality data, is available on the Web page and is accessible to the public or they can just ask us for it. We will get it to them. We've also conducted biota surveys. The department has completed biological assessments either on its own or in cooperation with other State and Federal agencies. Of particular note are the first ones that count--the biota survey conducted by the Council on Environmental Quality directed-- they directed that study, a biological survey of Devils Lake and also a survey of several locations in the upper Sheyenne River conducted by a private consultant hired by the State Water Commission. Also a biological diversity assessment conducted by the department. And, again, also a survey conducted by the International Red River Board Parasite and Pathogen survey directed by representatives of the Bureau of Reclamation and Canada. We've also looked at other water quality standards. In evaluating the proposed sulfate change, the department also reviewed EPA-approved water quality standards from other States to ensure consistency in the standards and science. It's important to note that Minnesota has a sulfate standard of 400 milligrams per liter in their drinking water primarily for infants and babies. South Dakota is looking at 500 not to be higher than 875, and they're also standards--because it's a secondary standard, is non-enforceable primarily because there isn't a concern relating to health, but it's more of an aesthetic issue. We have several communities in the State that drink considerably more than 250 and some above a thousand milligrams per liter with no observed health effects. Please note that the proposed change for the Sheyenne River applies only to the area previously identified and does not change any standard essentially downstream of Baldhill Dam or on the Red River. We are required as part of our annual review to commit and comply with all the existing water quality standards downstream, and in our proposed changes it does say that we will maintain compliance at 450 downstream and 250 in the Red River for sulfate. The department is also a strong advocate of the legislature authorized Outlet Advisory Committee to ensure that people impacted in the Devils Lake area and downstream of the outlet have a strong voice in the operation of the outlet. The department is keenly aware of its obligations to the citizens of the State and also to the EPA in the implementation of the Clean Water Act. We are bound by State and Federal law to thoroughly assess and evaluate each use and discharge into waters of the State for potential impacts on downstream designated uses. Potential impacts are evaluated for each specific discharge utilizing the best available science and applicable law. Discharges include those from point sources such as municipal/industrial wastewater systems and from agricultural operations. This concludes my testimony. I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Glatt, thank you very much. We appreciate you being here. I do have a series of questions. Next Mayor Bott, the mayor of Devils Lake. We welcome you. STATEMENT OF FRED BOTT, MAYOR, CITY OF DEVILS LAKE; PRESIDENT, DEVILS LAKE CITY COMMISSION Mayor Bott. Good morning, Senator. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today regarding the current challenges facing the city of Devils Lake and surrounding area and the potential implications related to rising water levels within the lake. My name is Fred Bott. I'm President of the Devils Lake City Commission. As you are aware, the city of Devils Lake has faced a multitude of challenges resulting from fluctuating lake levels. Last year the city reluctantly agreed to enter into a Project Cooperative Agreement with the Corps of Engineers to increase the protection level of the embankment protecting the city and surrounding area. The city was extremely concerned about entering into this agreement because we felt that continued flooding and increasing lake elevations will have dire economic impacts to the city. We understood that if the lake continued to rise it would flood an additional 100,000 acres or more of prime farmland, flood countless homes, and be devastating to our neighboring communities. Therefore, the city of Devils Lake fully supports efforts from the North Dakota Department of Health and the North Dakota State Water Commission to remove additional water from the lake to reduce flood damages. With the drastic rise in Devils Lake again this--again last year and the continuing precipitation we've been receiving, we feel it is imperative that emergency measures be taken to address our continued flooding. The city of Devils Lake does not want to pass our problems along downstream, but it appears obvious to us that if adjustments to downstream water quality and quantity requirements are not made to allow increased flows from the lake, a natural overflow could result in extreme water quality and flooding impacts downstream in the future. Even with the expansion of the embankment protecting our area, it will not be able to contain the lake should it continue to rise. Therefore, working together now to develop effective flood relief measures rather than waiting to see if Mother Nature will address the issue on her own future is the most logical approach to solve this issue. On February 11, 2009, I had the honor to testify before you, Senator Dorgan, in Washington, DC. One of my statements was as follows: As you will hear today from representatives of the National Weather Service it appears there is a significant chance the lake will experience a dramatic rise this spring. By the end of February 2009, we knew something was coming. It was a rise of 3 feet 7 inches and 36 of those 43 inches remain on the lake. As of the morning of February 19, 2010, it appears there is a significant chance the lake will experience a dramatic rise this spring. Devils Lake is rapidly building to an overflow. The city of Devils Lake fully supports the proposed water quality adjustments within the Sheyenne River and feels necessary adjustments need to be made to allow larger amounts of water to be removed from the lake to prevent its continued rise. PREPARED STATEMENT Again, Senator, thank you for the opportunity to speak today. We appreciate that you continue to understand the great challenges that lie ahead of us and hope we are able to work together to find effective solutions. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Fred Bott Senator Dorgan and subcommittee members, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today regarding the current challenges facing the city of Devils Lake and surrounding area and the potential implications related to rising water levels within the lake.

Mayor Bott, thank you very much. Jon Cameron is here on behalf of the mayor of Valley City. Mr. Cameron. STATEMENT OF JON CAMERON, CITY ADMINISTRATOR, VALLEY CITY Mr. Cameron. Good morning, Senator. Again, I'm Jon Cameron, City Administrator for Valley City, and I'm honored to be here today representing Mayor Mary Lee Nielson and the City Commission of Valley City. The stated purpose of the hearing today is to hear from multiple community officials about the impact of the increase in the allowable sulfate levels in the Sheyenne River that those will have on drinking water quality and those communities served by the Sheyenne River. A brief history of the Valley City water treatment plant will help clarify the overall understanding of this issue for our city. The plant in Valley City was constructed in 1972 and basically used a lime softener process for water treatment. There are currently two wild water sources utilized by the plant, surface water from the Sheyenne River and groundwater from the Valley City aquifer, which is under direct influence of the river. When the city is operating on 100 percent surface water, the plant produces approximately 3 million gallons per day. Due to operational limitations of the groundwater wells, the plant produces 2.2 million gallons per day running solely on the ground--groundwater. It is part of a plan plant upgrade program the city recently completed the chlorine chloramine contact basin project, which provides control of disinfection contact in order to meet Federal drinking water regulation. The next phase of our upgrade project was to create redundancy in the lime softener line feed system. Planning for this project was underway when proposed increase of the sulfate levels in Sheyenne River was announced last summer. We initiated contact immediately with officials of North Dakota Department of Health, State Water Commission, and the office of the Governor regarding potential impact of increased sulfates in the drinking water in Valley City. At the same time we had dialogue with Advanced Engineering and Environmental Services Incorporated to contract water engineering firms for Valley City. We determined at that time the best and most practical way to treat the surface water effectively was through the installation of reverse osmosis or membrane water treatment facility. The membrane facility would not only treat and filter the increased sulfates, but also be able to remove turbidity and soften the water. Through the efforts of our local elected officials funding assistance was obtained through the State Water Commission in the amount of $9.2 million. The new system is securing two $400,000 corporations for a total of $800,000. And finally $4.6 million in funds were secured through ARRA, which consisted of $2.6 million forgivable loan and $2 million loan payable---- Senator Dorgan. ARRA is the economic stimulus? Mr. Cameron. Yes, sir. That loan $2 million payable over 20 years at 1 percent. PREPARED STATEMENT Our design work is under way and construction should begin in late 2010 with a projected completion date of 2011. We in Valley City are appreciative of the divine efforts of you, Senator, and the State officials of North Dakota to help Valley City respond to the water treatment plant issues in a manner that will result in a treatment plant to meet all current and known future water treatment requirements while at the same time minimizing the long-term cost to our locals out there. Thank you again for the opportunity. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Jon Cameron Good morning.

Senator Dorgan. Mr. Cameron, thank you very much. Next, we'll hear from Dr. Wei Lin. Did I pronounce that correctly? Dr. Lin. Yes. Senator Dorgan. Dr. Lin is an associate professor of civil engineering at North Dakota State University. STATEMENT OF WEI LIN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY Dr. Lin. Good morning, Senator Dorgan. My name is Wei Lin. I'm an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at North Dakota State University. I'm an environmental engineer and my specialty areas are water quality management and water in the wastewater treatment. I'm also a member of the North Dakota State Water Pollution Control Board. I am pleased to provide the following information on potential impact of sulfate on various water uses in reference to the proposed increase of allowable sulfate levels in the Sheyenne River. Sulfate is a commonly occurring negatively charged ion in natural waters. At high concentrations, sulfate may cause some adverse health and environment impacts including taste in drinking water and the laxative effects; increase of soil salinity and reduction in productivity; corrosion of water distribution network; and chemical reactions that affect lake water quality. Sulfate in drinking water has a secondary maximum contamination level of 250 milligrams per liter. A salty taste may be experienced when sulfate concentration exceeds 250 milligrams per liter. Secondary drinking water standards are established for aesthetic considerations and are not enforceable by USEPA. However, taste and odors in drinking water are two of the top consumer complaints according to American Water Works Association, a professional organization of water industry. Taste in water may lead to consumers drinking less water and thus losing their appetite. Health concerns regarding sulfate in drinking water have been raised because laxative effect of sulfate on infant and transient populations. Diarrhea and dehydration conditions may be induced by sudden increase of sulfate level in drinking water. Infants receiving their first bottles containing tap water are more susceptible than adults to diarrheal water loss because of differences in gastrointestinal structure and function. As a precaution, Minnesota Department of Health recommends that water with a sulfate level exceeding 400 milligrams per liter should not be used in the preparation of infant formula. Older children and adults become accustomed to higher sulfate levels after few days. Evidence indicates that people acclimate to presence of sulfate in drinking water. An earlier informal survey conducted by the North Dakota Department of Health--actually about 60 years ago, which has been often referenced as being a scientific literature, suggested that water sulfate level greater than 750 milligrams per liter was considered a laxative by most consumers. No chronic adverse health impact from exposure to sulfate in water has been reported. An expert panel assembled by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a health advisory in places where drinking water has sulfate levels greater than 500 milligrams per liter. Animals are also found sensitive to high level of sulfate. In young animals, high level may be associated with severe diarrhea. High sulfate concentration in Devils Lake is associated with high salinity, which is often measured as electrical conductivity. Higher the sulfate concentration--or higher salt concentration, higher the electrical conductivity. Sulfate is a nutrient to plants at low concentrations. Present of sulfate as dissolved gypsum calcium sulfate may reduce sodium hazard by reducing sodium to calcium and magnesium ratio, called sodium adsorption ratio. However, high salinity is proven to have a negative impact on crop yield. A recent study conducted by NDSU researchers indicates potential accumulation of sulfate and increase of salinity in topsoil after irrigating a field with water containing relatively high sulfate and salinity. Now, I'd like to talk about the potential impact of sulfate on the aquatic ecosystem. We all know that under anaerobic conditions--that's conditions without oxygen--sulfate may be reduced to sulfide through microbial reactions. Hydrogen sulfide formed in these reactions gives a rotten egg smell of sewage. Sulfate reduction may also occur in organic rich sediments in lakes and slow moving rivers. In sediment, sulfate serves as an alternative of oxygen and stimulates the decomposition of organic matter. As organic matter is decomposed sulfate is reduced to sulfide at same time phosphate and ammonia is released from decomposed organic matter. Instead of forming hydrogen sulfide, sulfide ions in sediment have a tendency to bind with metals such as iron and aluminum and releasing phosphate that is originally associated with these metal ions. Scientists give this process a term internal eutrophication. Results from scientific studies show that an increase of sulfate concentration may cause more nitrogen and phosphorous release from sediments and therefore resulting in more algal growth in lakes. The importance of increased eutrophication on the aquatic ecosystem and--or the impact--I'm sorry. The impact of increased eutrophication on the aquatic system and the economy could be significant. Algal bloom will not only cause unpleasant conditions for recreational use of the lake, but blue-green algae may release toxins that make the water unsafe for human and animal consumption. Highly eutrophic lakes typically have low oxygen level near the bottom and experience strong daily oxygen variations in the top layer. Oxygen limitation will have adverse impact on the fish population. It will cause disappearance of game fish and encourage the growth of trash fish. Impact of the increased Sheyenne River sulfate level on Lake Ashtabula is not clear and it could be long term. Once a lake becomes eutrophic it is very difficult to reverse the process. I strongly support a comprehensive monitoring program on Lake Ashtabula to track the progression of sulfate level and the change in other water quality and ecological parameters. I would like to recommend establishment of a research program focusing on Lake Ashtabula water quality and its aquatic system. The research will include field sampling/ surveying, experimental studies, and model simulations to understand the impact of sulfate and other environmental stressors on lake chemistry and biological processes to predict short-and long-term effects on water quality and ecosystem, and to study potential socio-economical impact to the region. Sulfates are important in both public and industrial water supplies because of the tendency of water containing high amounts of sulfates to form hard scales in boilers and heat exchangers. Sulfate cannot be removed by conventional water treatment process as earlier speakers already mentioned. Therefore, high sulfate level in source water will result in high sulfate concentration in drinking water unless advanced treatment methods are employed in the water treatment plan. Effective advanced water treatment methods for sulfate removal include reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and distillation. PREPARED STATEMENT This ends my testimony. Thank you for your attention and opportunity. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Wei Lin My name is Wei Lin. I am an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at North Dakota State University (NDSU). I am an environmental engineer and my specialty areas are water quality management, and water/wastewater treatment. I am also a member of the North Dakota State Water Pollution Control Board. I am pleased to provide the following information on potential impact of sulfate on various water uses in reference to proposed increase of allowable sulfate levels in the Sheyenne River. Sulfate (SO22-) is a commonly occurring negatively charged ion (anion) in natural waters. At high concentrations, sulfate may cause some adverse health and environmental impacts, including: taste in drinking water and laxative effects; increase of soil salinity and reduction in productivity; corrosion of water distribution network; and chemical reactions that affect lake water quality. Sulfate in drinking water has a secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) of 250 mg/L. A salty taste may be experienced when sulfate concentration exceeds 250 mg/L. Secondary drinking water standards are established for aesthetic considerations and are not enforced by USEPA. However, tastes and odors in drinking water are one of the top customer complaints according to American Water Works Association, a professional organization of the water industry. Taste in tap water may lead to consumers drinking less water and losing their appetite. Health concerns regarding sulfate in drinking water have been raised because laxative effects of sulfate on infants and transient populations (USEPA, 1999a). Diarrhea and dehydration conditions may be induced by a sudden increase of sulfate levels in drinking water. Infants receiving their first bottles containing tap water are more susceptible than adults to diarrheal water loss because of differences in gastrointestinal structure and function (USEPA, 2003). As a precaution, Minnesota Department of Health (2006) recommends that water with a sulfate level exceeding 400 mg/L should not be used in the preparation of infant formula. Older children and adults become accustomed to high sulfated levels after a few days. Evidence indicates that people acclimated to the presence of sulfate in drinking water. An informal survey conducted by the North Dakota Department of Health suggested that water sulfate levels greater than 750 mg/L was considered laxative by most consumers. No chronic adverse health impact from exposure to sulfate in water has been reported (USEPA, 1994). An expert panel assembled by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a health advisory in places where drinking water has sulfate levels greater than 500 mg/L (USEPA, 1999b). Animals are also found sensitive to high levels of sulfate. In young animals, high levels may be associated with severe diarrhea. High sulfate concentration in Devils Lake is associated with high salinity, which is often measured as electrical conductivity. Higher the salt concentration, higher the electrical conductivity. Sulfate is a nutrient to plants at low concentrations. Present of sulfate as dissolved gypsum (calcium sulfate) may reduce sodium hazard by reducing sodium to calcium and magnesium ratio, called sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). However, high salinity is proven to have a negative impact on crop yield. A recent study conducted by NDSU researchers indicates potential accumulation of sulfate in the topsoil after irrigating with water containing relatively high sulfate and salinity. Now, I'd like to talk about the potential impact of sulfate on the aquatic ecosystem. We all know that under anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions, sulfate may be reduced to sulfide through microbial reactions. Hydrogen sulfide formed in these reactions gives a ``rotten egg smell'' of sewage. Sulfate reduction may also occur in organic rich sediments in lakes and slow moving rivers. In sediment, sulfate serves as an alternative of oxygen and stimulates the decomposition of organic matter. As organic matter is decomposed sulfate is reduced to sulfide. Phosphate and ammonia are released from decomposed organic matter. Instead of forming hydrogen sulfide, sulfide ions in sediment have a tendency to bind with metals such as iron and aluminum and releasing phosphate that is originally associated with these metal ions (Smolders et al., 2006). Scientists give this process a term ``internal eutrophication''. Results from scientific studies, show that an increase of sulfate concentration may cause more N and P release from sediments and therefore result in more algal growth in lakes. The impact of increased eutrophication on the aquatic ecosystem and the economy could be significant. Algal bloom will not only cause unpleasant conditions for recreational use of a lake, but blue-green algae may release toxins that makes water unsafe for human and animal consumption. Highly eutrophic lakes typically have low oxygen level near the bottom and experience strong daily oxygen variations in the top layer. Oxygen limitation will have adverse impact on the fish population. It will cause disappearance of game fish and encourage the growth of trash fish. Impact of the increased Sheyenne River sulfate level on Lake Ashtabula is not clear and could be long term. Once a lake becomes eutrophic it is very difficult to reverse the process. I strongly support a comprehensive monitoring program on Lake Ashtabula to track the progression of sulfate level and changes in other water quality and ecological parameters. I would like to recommend establishment of a research program focusing on Lake Ashtabula water quality and its aquatic ecosystem. The research will be include field sampling/surveying, experimental studies, and model simulations to understand the impact of sulfate and other environmental stressors on lake chemistry and biological processes, to predict short and long-term effects on water quality and ecosystem, and to study potential socio- economical impacts to the region. Sulfates are important in both public and industrial water supplies because of the tendency of waters containing appreciable amounts to form hard scales in boilers and heat exchangers. Sulfate cannot be removed by conventional water treatment processes. Therefore, high sulfate level in source water will result in high sulfate concentration in drinking water unless advanced treatment methods are employed in the water treatment process. Effective advanced water treatment methods include: reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and distillation.

We appreciate you being here, and next Mr. Jim Stevens, who represents the organization People to Save the Sheyenne River. STATEMENT OF JIM STEVENS, PEOPLE TO SAVE THE SHEYENNE RIVER Mr. Stevens. Thank you, Senator. I feel honored to be here today. I did explain to Justin when he called me that I am a past president of that organization, but I would have to be speaking today as an individual who lives in rural North Dakota along the Sheyenne River. My family goes back over 130 years in that area, and my great-grandfather homesteaded parts of what we have right now and my grandchildren will be the sixth generation on this land. We are very concerned about the--any added Devils Lake water to our river. We've experienced many floods over the years and any additional water from Devils Lake can spill out onto the fields and up and down the valley, not just our land, but down the whole valley and sit on these fields for weeks on end, and with the added sulfate levels, could be detrimental to our soil. In past years the Sheyenne River has decreased to less than 50 cfs and the banks get a chance to re-vegetate and heal for the next flood, which seems to come more often each year. We in 1993 had a severe summer flood when we got 10 to 12 inches of rain in our area and within 24 hours we had a major flood. They can't shut down the Devils Lake outlet to help in a situation like that. That extra flow could be catastrophe for many local citizens and the towns of Fort Ransom, Lisbon, Enderlin, on down to the Red River Valley area. The State Water Commission and the State Health Department have claimed that these high sulfates will only reach a little bit below Baldhill Dam and Lake Ashtabula. I wonder if they have done enough studies. What is it going to do to Baldhill Dam? And it would be hard for me to believe that it will not gradually go further down over a number of years. They might be looking at the first year. What about 5, 10 years down the road? The city of Devils Lake has purchased land in the Tolna Coulee and already lowered it 1 foot. They would like to lower it another 5 feet. Any farmer cutting a drain would be in deep trouble if he tried that, but it seems like the Governor goes under him or above the law. I know an older gentleman from east of New Rockford who was at meetings decades ago when they were planning to increase draining in the upper basin to bring water to the salt plat of Devils Lake. A man of knowledge stood up and told them if you're planning this amount of draining, you better have a plan in place when you get too much water, and no one believed him. I do not believe that they have done a sufficient amount of controlling the water coming into Devils Lake. As long as they're ungated, manmade drains coming into that area, they are not doing what they should to prevent the flood. It has been stated by officials from Devils Lake that they do not want the lake to go below 1,446 because it's been very good for their economy. They want to turn this into a river and then have your Devils Lake outlet. But as was said earlier, the Devils Lake outlet would take up to 3 to 4 inches off the lake a year if it's increased to this level. Before when they set up the 4 inches, it took a fraction of an inch. That would never prevent a natural overflow anyway. You have to do other measures to prevent the natural overflow. If it's going to increase 3 feet with all that rain coming into Devils Lake, 4 inches is not going to help. PREPARED STATEMENT Thank you very much for your time, Senator, and I'm honored to be here. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Jim Stevens In his announcement of the February 19, 2010 hearing in west Fargo, North Dakota, to take testimony on the Devils Lake Outlet Project, Senator Byron Dorgan made it clear that he believed that ``transferring water problems from one region of North Dakota to another'' was not acceptable. People to Save the Sheyenne agree with Senator Dorgan's assessment and wish to add this information as part of the record objecting to the construction and operation of the Devils Lake Outlet as a method of dealing with excess water on Devils Lake, North Dakota. The Main Point of Contention.--What are the chief causes of the rise of Devils Lake over the past 25 years and what is the best method of dealing with that situation? Officials have not yet considered seriously the restoration of upper basin drained wetlands which would result in more acres of storage. Since over 350,000 acres of upper basin wetlands have been drained, it stands to reason that those drained acres contribute to higher levels on Devils Lake. Here's What Needs To Be Done First.--A complete and objective scientific study by outside experts of the hydrology of the entire Devils Lake Basin to determine the extent of the drainage and the amount of water that drainage has produced on Devils Lake. The North Dakota State Water Commission built its outlet from Devils Lake into the Sheyenne River in 2005. The original permit limited sulfate levels in the Sheyenne River to 300 milligrams per liter. The North Dakota Department of Health increased that limit in 2008 to 450 mg/L. On July 15, 2009, Governor John Hoeven, using Emergency Rules, voided the original permit and approved an increase in the sulfate limit in the upper Sheyenne River to 750 mg/L, a move that would allow almost unlimited pumping of Devils Lake water into the Sheyenne. The SWC is planning to increase the flow of water from Devils Lake into the river this year from 100 cubic feet per second to 250 cfs. Such an increase will result in serious degradation of the water quality in the river, turning it into a miniature Devils Lake ditch. No scientific, objective studies of the results of adding more Devils Lake water to the river have been done. Instead, both the North Dakota Department of Health and the SWC have stated that such an increase of Devils Lake water would not change the usefulness of Sheyenne River water. The Governor made his decision without scientific study and without consultation with those who will be affected by increased flows of Devils Lake water into the Sheyenne River. Who should have been involved in making the decision to void the original outlet permit? Well, besides Valley City and Barnes County, North Dakota, here are a few: --The U.S. Fish Hatchery.--Can 50 species of fish (and 9 species of mussels) hatch, survive and thrive in Devils Lake water at the Valley City National Fish Hatchery? If fish (and mussels) reproduce naturally in Devils Lake water, why is Devils Lake still being stocked? How many species live, reproduce and thrive in Devils Lake water? --The North Dakota Game and Fish Department.--What will 100,000 acre/ feet of Devils Lake water do to Lake Ashtabula? What is the North Dakota Game and Fish response to the change in water quality, to what those changes will do to recreation on the lake? What about cabin owners around the lake? --The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.--What changes will the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers make to its operational plan for Lake Ashtabula as a result of 250 cfs additional water for 7 months of the year? Will there be an earlier and deeper spring drawdown? Who has jurisdiction, the Corps or the North Dakota State Water Commission, when it comes to deciding when and how much water to release? What happens when the sulfate level in the lake rises above 450 mg/L? What happens when that water is released downstream into the river? --Landowners Along the Sheyenne River.--What will happen to the Sheyenne River between Devils Lake and Lake Ashtabula, once sulfate-and-other-contaminant-laden Devils Lake water becomes 80 or 90 percent of the total water in the river? The Sheyenne River between Devils Lake and Lake Ashtabula will contain almost 700 mg/L sulfate. What will that do to the ecology of the river? To livestock? --Cities Such as Fargo and West Fargo.--How will the Sheyenne Diversion around west Fargo be impacted by continuously higher flows? More erosion? That's what will occur in the entire Sheyenne River. What difference will higher flows of contaminated Devils Lake water do to Fargo water supply when it draws water from the Sheyenne? --Canada.--Have Canadian concerns about biota transfer been adequately addressed? The FEIS of the Corps' Outlet Project seem to indicate that they have not. And what about added levels of contaminated Devils Lake water in general? What about using the International Joint Commission to mediate? --The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.--Where are the studies showing the effects of Devils Lake water on the RRBWSP? Has the Red River Basin Water Supply Project taken Devils Lake water into consideration? If so, what are the ramifications of more Devils Lake water in the Sheyenne? Where are the studies showing the impacts? Is Devils Lake water part of the plan to get Missouri River water to Fargo? When the SWC pumps 250 cubic feet per second Devils Lake water into the river and the RRVWSP adds another 125 cfs, what will the effects be on erosion and flooding along the Sheyenne River? When the river flows at less than 50 cfs in the fall of the year, what will adding 600 percent more water do? All of these affected parties should have facts and scientific data--not just verbal assurances--to reveal the effects of adding 250 cfs Devils Lake water to the Sheyenne River. But when Governor Hoeven on July 15, 2009 signed the letter allowing the use of Emergency Rules to void the permit to drain and replace it with a plan that will allow degradation of the Sheyenne River, none of these constituents had any voice in the matter. An arbitrary and capricious act replaced science, common sense and community involvement. People to Save the Sheyenne requests U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development withhold Federal funding for Devils Lake projects, including money to be spent on infrastructure, until a complete, comprehensive hydrologic study of the entire Devils Lake Basin, including causes of the rise of Devils Lake and methods of dealing with the problems, has been authorized and initiated. ______ [From the Times-Record, February 15, 2010] State Officials Not Dealing Truthfully When it Comes to Devils Lake Outlet North Dakota Department of Health Administrator Dr. Terry Dwelle, Environmental Health Section Chief L. David Glatt and Assistant State Engineer Todd Sando's February 8 letter responding to the Times- Record's February 2 editorial on the Devils Lake outlet warrants a factual response. They claim State agencies have informed numerous Federal agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of State, the White House Council on Environmental Quality and Canadian officials about flooding at Devils Lake and operation of the outlet. What they fail to say is that much of the information they have provided to Federal agencies, Canadian officials and the public regarding the operation of the outlet has been incomplete, misleading and frequently deliberately false. For example, based on information provided by North Dakota agencies, Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy told U.S. Department of State officials on July 12, 2005 that it was imperative to disregard the concerns of Canadian officials and allow immediate operation of the outlet because: ``The longer we postpone the solution to this flooding crisis, the more danger North Dakota, Canada, and surrounding areas will face. The Devils Lake outlet project needs to be in full operation as soon as possible.'' By 2008, the $28 million outlet had removed the equivalent of one- tenth of an inch of water from the lake at an annual operating cost of over a quarter of a million dollars, and by 2009 the lake was 10 inches higher than it was before the outlet began operation. They neglect to mention that State Engineer Dale Frink made deliberately false statements regarding the operation and efficacy of the outlet in his August 30, 2002, application for a North Dakota Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit for the project, or that the Department of Health knew the statements were false but approved the permit anyway. The statement that, ``More than $800 million of State and Federal funds have been spent in recent years on storing more water in the upper basin, raising and protecting infrastructure, and building an outlet'' is seriously misleading. Most of the $800 million that have been spent dealing with the rising level of Devils Lake have been Federal taxpayer funds. From 1996 to 1999, while inflows to Devils Lake were averaging 317,000 acre-feet per year, the State spent $3.5 million annually to store an average of only 17,345 acre-feet of water per year. By 2009, when record inflows occurred to Devils Lake, the State's upper basin water storage program was down 769 acre-feet. Dwelle, Sando and Glatt also neglect to mention the $1.5 million U.S. taxpayer dollars that the State squandered on an experimental irrigation project to utilize water in the upper basin that anyone with a $4.95 calculator could see would be worthless in lowering the lake. They ignore the contribution of the drainage of 358,000 acres of wetlands in the Upper Devils Lake Basin--condoned and frequently promoted by the State engineer--to the rise of Devils Lake. Because wetlands in the Devils Lake Basin have the capacity to store an average of 1.7 feet of water and because the area had been in a drought for 4 years, 623,500 acre-feet of storage were no longer available as a result of wetland drainage when high levels of precipitation hit the area in 1993. The drainage of those 358,000 acres of wetlands has reduced the net loss of water in the Upper Basin through evaporation by another 239,000 acre-feet per year, indicating that as much as 75 percent of the inflows from 1993 to 1999--and 40 percent of the record inflows in 2009--were the result of the loss of evaporation capacity from drained wetlands. They say that Devils Lake is ``within just 8 feet of an uncontrolled release of the poorest quality, high-sulfate water from the east end,'' but they neglect to mention that it would take another 1.9 million acre-feet of water to raise Devils Lake to its natural overflow elevation of 1,459 feet, and by that time, evaporation would be removing over 700,000 acre-feet per year--seven times what the outlet operating at 250 cubic feet per second for 7 months would remove. They also do not mention that it would take 6 years for the outlet operating at 250 cfs just to remove last spring's inflows. They claim that their objective is to avoid a catastrophic uncontrolled overflow from Devils Lake, but by not taking action to prevent the city of Devils Lake from lowering the natural outlet to 1,458 feet, they have actually doubled the chance (from 3.2 to 6.1 percent) of a major uncontrolled overflow (where the discharge would exceed those of the State's 250 cfs outlet by another 50 cfs) to the Sheyenne River within 10 years. Lowering the outlet to 1,458 feet means that an additional 269,000 acre-feet of poor quality Devils Lake water would be discharged initially into the Sheyenne River as a result of lost storage if the lake should rise to its overflow elevation, and the discharge would be increased by 23,000 acre-feet every year as a result of lost evaporation from the lake because of its smaller surface area. They claim that the proposed increase of the sulfate limit in the Sheyenne River to 750 parts per million ``is protective of aquatic life, as well as recreational and agricultural uses,'' but they ignore the numerous serious adverse impacts to aquatic life and recreational and agricultural use of the Sheyenne River identified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for an outlet constrained by a much lower 300 ppm sulfate limit in the Sheyenne River. They neglect to mention that data from the State Water Commission show that the 450 ppm sulfate limit originally established by the Department of Health for the Sheyenne River was never reached in the area downstream from the outlet before operation of the outlet began. Nor do they mention that the department's own regulations require it to maintain water quality in streams when it is better than the established standards. They say that the awarding of $12 million to incorporate reverse osmosis in Valley City's new water treatment plant in order to remove sulfates and other minerals ``is a clear signal from the State that the interests of Valley City are important and will be protected.'' They do not mention that the reason a reverse osmosis system is necessary is to treat the increased levels of sulfates and other minerals from the Devils Lake outlet. Nor do they mention that the Corps of Engineers has determined that operation of an outlet constrained by a much lower 300 ppm sulfate limit in the Sheyenne River would increase downstream water treatment costs by $1.7 to $3.3 million annually. Governor John Hoeven appointed the administrator of the Health Department and, as chairman of the State Water Commission, he was instrumental in appointing the State engineer and is responsible for oversight of the State engineer and his staff. It is time for State officials to start dealing responsibly and truthfully with the problem of rising water levels at Devils Lake. Gary Pearson, Jamestown, North Dakota. ______ [From the Times-Record, February 2, 2010] ``Sign of Hope: Dorgan Speaks on Devils Lake'' For the first time since July, there's hope that the imminent increase of chemical-laden Devils Lake waters into the Sheyenne River might be stopped. In a conference call with news media last week, Senator Byron Dorgan said he wanted to examine effects of Devils Lake water on downstream communities, including Fargo and Valley City. Since July, when the North Dakota Department of Health allowed higher sulfate levels into the Sheyenne, it's the first time a State leader has talked publicly about concerns over the issue. This is big news. ``I am not interested in transferring the problems from one region of our State to another,'' Dorgan said, as reported in The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead. The sulfate level threatens the health of residents in Valley City, which gets its drinking water from the Sheyenne. Indeed, the sulfates put at risk all who rely on the river for farming, recreation or living. And at little gain. The State has been installing pumps at Devils Lake to increase the flow into the Sheyenne from 100 to 250 cubic feet per second. At the higher rate, only 6 inches of water will come off the lake a year, according to Dave Glatt of the Health Department. Unless something is done, the pumps will start up this summer. Glatt doesn't care that Valley City and other communities are at risk. Neither, appare"
