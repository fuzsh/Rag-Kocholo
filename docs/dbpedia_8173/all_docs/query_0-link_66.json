        "text": "Foraging Porcini Mushrooms – Beltrami State Forest -Roseau’s #1 Best Picking Spot\n\nMushroom Picking in the Beltrami Forest - A Foragers Paradise\n\nWhile in Roseau, spend a day mushroom picking under the tall pines in northern Minnesota’s Beltrami State Forest. This state-owned land offers nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts a serene escape. Among its avenue of pines and rich black soil, the forest harbors a hidden treasure for foragers: the elusive and highly prized Boletus edulis, commonly known as porcini mushrooms.\n\nPorcini Mushrooms offer a Deep Nutty Flavor\n\nPorcini mushrooms are renowned for their rich, earthy flavor and meaty texture, making them a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike. These mushrooms are a culinary delight, often described as having a nutty and slightly sweet taste, which enhances a wide variety of dishes.\n\nThe Best Time for Mushroom Picking in Roseau\n\nTiming is crucial when foraging for porcini mushrooms in Beltrami State Forest. The best time to harvest these mushrooms is typically from late summer to early fall, usually between August and September. This year, picking is exceptional due to the high rainfall in late spring and early summer. The mushroom picking season might be longer than normal this year. When harvesting specific timing can vary depending on weather conditions, particularly rainfall and temperature.\n\nAfter a few days of heavy rain followed by warm weather, porcini mushrooms tend to sprout prolifically. It’s best to go foraging in the morning, as this is when mushrooms are most fresh and less likely to be disturbed by insects.\n\nHarvesting Tips\n\nIdentification: Porcini mushrooms have a distinctive appearance. They typically have a large, brown cap that can range from light to dark brown, with a slightly sticky texture when fresh. The stem is thick and white, often with a slightly bulbous base. The underside of the cap is spongy, with tiny pores instead of gills.\n\nEnvironment: Look for porcini mushrooms under the tall pines of Beltrami Forest. They often grow near the roots of trees, forming symbiotic relationships with them. Check for clusters around the base of pine trees and in mossy areas.\n\nHarvesting: Use a knife to cut the mushroom at the base of the stem. Avoid pulling them out of the ground, as this can damage the mycelium, the fungal network that produces future mushrooms.\n\nSustainability: Only take what you need and leave some mushrooms behind to ensure the continued health of the mushroom population.\n\nPreparing and Cooking your Porcini's\n\nOnce you’ve successfully harvested your porcini mushrooms, the possibilities in the kitchen are endless. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nCleaning: Gently brush off any dirt with a soft brush. Avoid washing them with water, as they can absorb moisture and become soggy.\n\nSlicing and Drying: Porcini mushrooms can be sliced and dried for long-term storage. Simply slice them thinly and place them on a drying rack in a well-ventilated area. Once dried, store them in an airtight container. Rehydrate by soaking in warm water before use.\n\nSautéed Porcini: Slice the mushrooms and sauté them in olive oil or butter with garlic and a pinch of salt. This simple preparation allows their natural flavors to shine. Serve them as a side dish or atop grilled meats.\n\nCook a beautiful Porcini Risotto: Add sliced porcini mushrooms to a creamy risotto for an indulgent and comforting meal. Their earthy flavor pairs perfectly with the richness of the risotto.\n\nEat Fresh over a salad\n\nToss in a Porcini Pasta: Incorporate sautéed porcini mushrooms into a pasta dish with a light cream or garlic and olive oil sauce. Add a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs for a delightful and aromatic meal.\n\nAdd to Soups and Stews: Porcini mushrooms add depth and umami to soups and stews. Use them fresh or dried (reconstituted) to enhance broths and sauces.\n\nGetting to the Forest-Make it a day trip with Roseau as Homebase\n\nRoseau, Minnesota, serves as an ideal home base for exploring the rich natural attractions of the state’s northwest region. Just a short drive from town, you can embark on exciting day trips, such as mushroom picking in the lush Beltrami State Forest, where the prized boletus edulis (porcini) mushrooms await discovery. Lodging options in Roseau provide comfortable accommodations, making it easy to relax after a day of adventure. Whether you’re into hiking, kayaking, or foraging, Roseau offers convenient access to a variety of outdoor activities that highlight the beauty and bounty of northern Minnesota.\n\nThe Majestic Bald Eagle – Birdwatching in Roseau, MN\n\nRoseau is a Haven for Bird-Watchers\n\nRoseau is a haven for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts.

These impressive dimensions, with their striking white head and tail feathers contrasting against a dark brown body, make bald eagles a prominent and awe-inspiring sight in Minnesota’s skies. They can be seen in any season as they reside in the state year round.\n\nIdeal Spots to See a Bald Eagle in Roseau County\n\nWhile Bald Eagles can be seen throughout Roseau, there are several hotspots that are particularly popular among bird watchers:\n\nRoseau River Wildlife Management Area: This vast expanse of protected land is home to various bird species.

If you are looking to enjoy the simple things, considerheading to the forest for the best blueberry picking. It’s simply one of the most delightful experiences in late July- during the peak season. Let me take you on a journey through a perfect day in this beautiful forest, where the air is fresh, the skies are clear, and the blueberries are ripe for the picking.\n\nBlueberry Picking - Let the Adventure Begin\n\nAs the sun rises over the dense canopy of Beltrami State Forest, the morning light filters through the trees, casting a golden hue over the forest floor. The forest comes alive with the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves. Armed with baskets and an eager spirit, we set off on a trail leading us deep into the heart of the forest where blueberry bushes thrive. We took our Polaris four-wheelers on the trails, making the journey more accessible and fun. We headed straight to the pines, where we knew the berries were plentiful and prime for picking. Before we started harvesting, we took time for a picnic. The forest, with its tranquil beauty, provides a perfect backdrop for a picnic. My daughter started picking while I prepared lunch. Sitting on a blanket, surrounded by nature, we enjoyed cheese and crackers with fresh berries, savoring their natural sweetness. The snack was just enough to remind me that my rewards would be well worth the picking. Beltrami Forest is known for some of Roseau County’s best blueberry picking.\n\nThe Bounty of Berries\n\nBlueberries in Beltrami State Forest are small but packed with flavor. This year, we had record rainfall and cooler-than-normal temperatures, and the berries are small. But I tell you, these tiny, delicious berries burst with sweetness, making the effort of picking them all the more rewarding. The season for these wild blueberries typically stretches from mid-July to early August, offering a few weeks of prime picking. The berries would mount up faster if I didn’t eat every other handful. Our family goal for the day was to pick enough berries to make a fresh blueberry pie.\n\nPicking Tips\n\nLook for sunny spots: Blueberries thrive in sunny clearings with ample sunlight. Sandy, well-drained soil along a wooded area is a great spot to find them.\n\nGently pick the ripe ones: Ripe blueberries are deep blue and detach easily from the bush with a gentle tug.\n\nRespect nature: Be mindful of the environment. Only take what you need, leaving plenty for wildlife and other pickers. Watch your step so you do not trample a bush.\n\nDon’t forget the bug spray, beverages and your patience.\n\nOur Fresh Baked Blueberry Pie Recipe- Simple to Make and Delicious\n\nBack home, the bounty of blueberries transforms into a delicious homemade blueberry pie. Here’s a simple recipe to share the taste of our adventure.\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 cups fresh blueberries\n\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n\n1/4 cup cornstarch\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1 tablespoon butter\n\n1 package refrigerated pie crusts (for a 9-inch pie)\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\nPrepare the Filling: In a large bowl, mix the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and lemon juice until the berries are evenly coated.\n\nAssemble the Pie: Line a 9-inch pie dish with one of the pie crusts. Pour the blueberry mixture into the crust. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.\n\nTop Crust: Place the second pie crust over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n\nBake: Bake the pie for about 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with foil.\n\nCool: Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the filling to set.\n\nEnjoy the Little Things\n\nA day spent picking blueberries in Beltrami State Forest is more than just an outdoor activity; it’s a way to connect with nature, enjoy its bounty, and create lasting memories. Whether you’re a seasoned berry picker or a first-timer, the experience is enriching and the rewards, both the berries and the resulting delicious pie, are absolutely worth it. So grab your basket, head out to the forest, and indulge in the simple pleasures of blueberry picking.

While it offered snowbound communities unprecedented opportunities to travel in winter, it also created a totally new kind of winter recreation.\n\nGertie, with her industrious employees were instrumental in establishing a successful start to the growing company!\n\nThe transition from the small family home basement to a larger shop, later moving to a modern production plant was not just a physical move, but a significant milestone in the company’s journey.\n\nHere is a quick look back at the very early years of 1962-1969.\n\n1962 to 1965 ~Photos of the start of Northern Upholstery and the team of seamstresses who brought the company to the forefront!\n\nFor further information refer to:\n\nThe Amazing First Lady of Polaris Industries l Gertie Hetteen\n\nAn Amazing Trailblazer for Working Women and Polaris Industries l Gertie Hetteen Part 2 l\n\nPolaris Industries First Lady~ Gertie Hetteen, Vitality and Enthusiasm ~ Part 3!\n\nAs Northern Upholstery grew, so did the goals! Recognizing the need for expansion, Gertie and Allan made the strategic decision to relocate to a spacious, state-of-the-art production plant. This new facility, equipped with the latest technology and designed for efficiency, symbolized the company’s evolution and progress.\n\nNorthern Upholstery expands as the snowmobiling became a winter staple! Plans began in the fall of 1966.\n\n\"The snowmobile transformed northern winters with faster, easier travel and by making the experience so enjoyable that it became a form of recreation. In the case of many Arctic people, snowmobiling gave them even more mobility in winter than in the summer, enhancing communication among villagers and between villages and towns. With snowmobiles being able to reach the grounds and bring back the game, hunting and fishing takes increased. Further south, people got out and about, visiting friends and taverns, making \"snofaris\" into the winter landscape, racing, ice fishing at distant ponds, taking themselves and their machines where they had never before been in winter and where machines had never been at all. Sounds of civilization echoed throughout the forest.\"\n\nNorthern Upholstery's Production Increases Even More with the Introduction of the Polaris TX Series in 1968!\n\nIn 1968, Polaris Industries introduced the first of the famed TX series of snowmobiles, a series that was to run for twelve years. The TX was built and bought for performance, power, speed, and for racing. Due to the increased speed of the high-performance sleds, the engineers from Polaris wanted a more cushioned seat to help ride the rough winter terrain. Thus, Gertie and the Northern Upholstery crew produced a six-inch-high soft seat helping to cushion the bumps as riders flew through the air on some of the cross-country races!\n\nNorthern Upholstery at Full Production in 1968 and 1969!\n\nNorthern Upholstery led by Gertie soon expanded into other divisions. With assistance from her husband, Allan, in obtaining credit from financial institutions and with his advice, the business grew. (As reported in a previous article during the 1960’s and 1970’s banks denied women credit. They were not allowed to open a bank account in their own names. Technically, women won the right to open an account in a financial institution in the 1960s, but yet women had to have their husband’s sign for them to open the account. In 1974, the female gender in the U.S. was finally granted the right to open a bank account in their own name.)\n\nWhen were women allowed to run a business?\n\nPassed Senate amended (10/11/1988) Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 - Title I: Congressional Findings and Purposes - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes with respect to small businesses owned and controlled by women. H.R.5050 — 100th Congress (1987-1988)\n\nThe Women’s Business “Ownership Act provided seed funding for women’s business centers through an annual grant process by the Small Business Administration. The SBA provided technical assistance to women in order to form businesses, particularly those who were socially or economically disadvantaged.”\n\n~Wikipedia~\n\nGertie employed a number of high school students for the summer months and part-time during the school year. These four part-time students eventually became long-term employees of Polaris Industries in their adulthood.\n\nCLICK ON EACH PHOTO TO FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE.\n\nNorthern Upholstery Expanded Once Again! In 1970 Rosco, Inc., becomes a Tenant!\n\nOn June 1, 1970, Allan Hetteen retired from Polaris, a Textron Company. Textron Inc., an American industrial conglomerate located in Providence, Rhode Island, had purchased Polaris Industries in 1968. During Allan’s retirement negotiations with the Textron group it was the consensus he would continue to have ties with Polaris, thus the distributorship through mutual agreement was settled.\n\nFollowing Allan’s retirement from Polaris Industries, Allan became the owner and president of the Polaris distributorship, Rosco, Inc. in 1970.\n\nGertie and Allan determined Rosco, Inc. would become a tenant in the Northern Upholstery building.\n\nDue to the increase with all the new divisions added inventory, the need for an office plus a large warehouse for Rosco’s parts department, it became necessary for further expansion.\n\n\"Rosco, for lack of quarters of its own, became a tenant in the Northern Upholstery building and its demands for space plus the growth of Northern Upholstery have resulted in recent expansions.\"\n\n“Brick and mortor may make a building. It’s the employees that make the company!”\n\nNorthern Upholstery manufactured snowmobile seats for both Polaris Industries in Roseau and Beausejour, Manitoba.\n\nAt this time, Northern Upholstery began to expand by diversifying. The information of each acquisition is summarized below.\n\nThe Gallant Furniture and Drapery Division\n\nThe Gallant Furniture and Drapery Division manufactured furniture and draperies for Detroiter Mobile Homes located in Red Lake Falls, Minnesota. In addition, apartment sized furniture was produced and available for sale to the general public\n\nEverett Ridlon was the main designer for the furniture and drapes.\n\nThe Gallant furniture showroom featured a variety of designs and fabrics in the front lobby available for both the vendors and the public to view.\n\nThe Gallant Sportswear Collection Division\n\nThe Gallant Sportswear Division produced seasonal outerwear and was distributed by Rosco, Inc. The jackets featured a red, white, and blue stripe on the front side, a tribute to the colors of Polaris snowmobiles. The 1970-1971 Polaris Industries Factory Race Team and the Rosco Race Team wore suits designed by the Gallant Sportswear Collection Division. The photos below show the Polaris Team wearing windbreakers made for mild weather. The Rosco Race Team is wearing winter jackets.\n\nThe Trail Master Division\n\nThe Trail Master pickup toppers was another division brought in by Amco. The toppers were produced both in Red Lake Falls and Roseau. The product was sold throughout the United States.\n\nRosco, Inc., a Polaris Distributor\n\nRosco, Inc, as a distributor, was responsible for supplying snowmobiles to dealerships for retail sales. Rosco provided dealers with a range of snowmobile models. The company ensured dealers would have access to a selection of different models to meet consumer demand. The company staff also provided technical assistance, training and marketing assistance to help dealers promote and sell their snowmobile products effectively. The service area included upper northern Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nThe Rosco Race Team\n\nAllan was a proponent of utilizing a racing program to promoted the product. Allan formed the Rosco Race Team and directed the program from 1970 through the 1972 race season. At the start of the 1972-1973 race season, Allan offered an incentive program called “Racing for Gold” because the Rosco Race Team had dissolved. This program was available to dealers and independents drivers within the distributorship area ending in March 1973.\n\nThe Rosco Race Team Patch created by Gertie Hetteen.\n\nBecause the distributorship serviced a large demographic area, it became necessary for the race team to split up as three separate teams. There would usually be two drivers per team on some weekends. On other weekends, the entire team would travel and compete together. Participation at dealer sponsored races throughout the tri-state area included more than competing on the race track. The race team utilized their technical skills by demonstrating to the dealer or customer how to diagnose an unwelcomed issue, the use of the proper tools and equipment for repairs.\n\nAllan was an advocate of snowmobile safety. He believed his employees should practice safety measures and promote safety to the customers. The drivers knew the best representation of Rosco and the Polaris products were to set an example of good communication, teamwork, excellent customer service, problem-solving, plus performing 110% on the track!\n\nBack row, left to right: Gene Fichter-General Manager; Richard Sovde Support; Ed Mansuetto-Driver; Larry Grube-North Dakota Driver; Ron Grube-North Dakota Driver; Bob Przekwas-Driver; Roger Helgeson-Driver; Duane Opdahl-Driver; Tony Burkel-Driver; Wayne Burkel-Driver; Allan Hetteen-Owner and President of Rosco, Inc.; Lonnie Hagen-Support.\n\nFront row, left to right: Dale Amundson-Controller; Jim Wagner-Parts Manager; Steve Hetteen-Sales; Clayton Brandt-Sales; Jim Ploof-Sales Manager; Del Larson-Sales, Roger Powell-Sales.\n\nOver the course of the two years of the teams’ racing program, the drivers were successful in the winner’s circle, winning major races through the Midwest. Several of the team members qualified in high points for the USSA Central Division enabling them to compete at the World’s Series of Snowmobiling at Booneville, New York.\n\nThe racing program came to an end in March, 1972, due to the high cost of operating a race team along with the reduced snowmobile sales in the consumer market.\n\nRosco Surplus\n\nThe Rosco Surplus store was another outlet for the consumers operated by Rosco, Inc. The store was created to handle used snowmobiles and excess inventory from Polaris.\n\n1973 ~ The End of a Dynasty\n\n\"In the early 1970s, as the initial \"oil crisis\" raised its ugly head, snowmobile industry experts viewed the business with excitement. By 1973, snowmobile industry experts began backing off earlier predictions of one million sled sales by 1973-1974. Experts had predicted sales to continue to 700,000 by 1972; 900,00 by 1973, and upwards of one million by 1974. The reality started to hit when only 587,000 sleds were sold in 1971-1972. Response within the industry was mixed.\"\n\nThe 1973 Oil Embargo severely weakened a U.S. economy that had grown increasingly dependent on foreign oil. The 1973 energy crisis, also known as the Oil Shock of 1973–74, was a period of escalating energy prices and fuel shortages caused by an embargo by Arab oil-producing nations in response to U.S. support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War.\n\nPolaris sold a record 30,000 snowmobiles during the 1970–71 season, but business declined sharply after that. The 1973 OPEC oil embargo and the ensuing energy crisis transformed snowmobiling into a luxury activity that many Americans could not afford. Sales plummeted. More than a dozen snowmobile manufacturers got out of the business. Polaris survived by cutting production and reducing its workforce.\n\nNorthern Upholstery and Rosco, Inc., were affected negatively as well. On March 15, 1973, Rosco, Inc., a Polaris distributor shut down.\n\nNorthern Upholstery Production of Snowmobile Seat Cushions Ends in 1973.\n\nIn the summer of 1973, Northern Upholstery no longer produced seats cushions for Polaris Industries. The seat production would be done in-house at the Polaris factory.\n\nNavigating Tragedy\n\nOn November 12, 1966, Gertie and Allan lost their thirteen-year-old son Timmy in a tragic hunting accident.\n\nTimothy (Timmy) Jon Hetteen, age 13 years.\n\nHis grieving mother writes, \"Timmy loved guns and hunting. He had just completed his gun training so was able to go deer hunting with his dad and Steve at the hunting camp north of Salol. Ironically this is where he spent his last hours of life. He finished hunting for the day as the other hunters were also returning to the camp, except he wanted a snowmobile ride before dark. He worked on his machine for fifteen minutes before he got it going, still dressed in his red clothes, and as he rode just a short way he was tragically hit three times by another hunter who said he thought he was shooting at a deer!\"\n\nShe goes on to say, “We, of course, were devastated and had great difficulty resuming our lives in the days ahead. Tim was such a great part of our family and our only consolation was in knowing he was safe at home with his Lord. I can still see Timmy’s smile as he left for camp the night before hunting season opened. Thirteen short years we had all enjoyed him.”\n\nIt was a life and legacy that ended too soon!\n\n\"I Lost All Interest ...\"\n\nIn an interview with Joe McDonnell, writing for the Roseau Electric Volts and Views Newsletter, Gertie stated, “After Allan died, I lost all interest in running the business.”\n\nIn 1974, Gertie retired from the company.\n\nShe sold the company to Marlin Matheny of Red Lake Falls, Minnesota.\n\nThe Gallant Drapery Division was acquired by Lois and Adrian Larson, both long-term employees of Northern Upholstery.\n\nThe remaining inventory from Rosco and the surplus store was purchased by Gene Fichter.\n\nIn 1975, the business came to an end.\n\n1975 Brings a New Chapter to Gertie's Life\n\nLosing a loved one can be incredibly difficult, both emotionally and logistically. The experience often comes suddenly and is certain to cause a flood of overwhelming emotions. Gertie experienced immense loss within a six-year span. Losing a child and then her husband, both unexpected, was devastating enough. Imagine having to deal with the responsibilities of retiring from a business built from an idea which grew into a large corporation and most importantly, raising three beloved sons on her own. Gertie did!\n\nThose who knew Gertie will remember and respect her gutsy attitude, her ability to overcome the cultural issues as a woman running a manufacturing company and the challenges which go with day-to-day operations, the economic uncertainty, and most of all, the personal tragedies. Gertie faced closure of the businesses she and her husband built together with grace and dignity. Her faith in God, support from her family, friends, and former employees enabled her through this process. Dale Amundson, the controller from the company worked with her on the financial obstacles. Long-time friends and employees, Lois and Adrian Larson provided support on many levels. Bob Carter was the legal advisor and her brother-in-law, Edgar Hetteen, became a partner with Amco, Inc. following his younger brother’s death.\n\nWorking to resolve details on legal matters and issues which arose when closing down the corporation, Gertie and Bob became friends which eventually led to their marriage. Gertie and Bob were married on June 3, 1975. They converted a hunting cabin into a permanent home in Beaver Township, south of Wannaska, Minnesota.\n\nGertie was never one to sit still, she loved to garden and continued with her creativity.\n\nIn 1976 she started making dolls and bears as a hobby.\n\nHer hobby soon developed into a business called “Grandma Gertie’s Dolls and Bears.”\n\nAfter Bob Carter passed away at the age of 83 on September 6, 2000, Gertie continued living in their home south of Wannaska. She kept busy spending time with her family, friends and being active in her hobbies and numerous organizations.\n\nGertie, her friends/employees from the Northern Upholstery days enjoyed gathering at Gertie’s home. The two photos below show some of the ladies. The photo on the left was taken in 2001, the photo on the right in 1966.\n\nGertie..your life was a blessing, your memory a treasure.\n\nGertrude (Gertie) Hetteen Carter passed away at the age of 73 on January 23, 2004\n\nGertie lived her life with vitality and strength. God and her family were the most important in her life. She cared about her community and country. Through her efforts and support, Gertie made a difference in so many people’s lives with her motivation. Her commitment to building a business and initially hiring women had an impact on the northern Minnesota rural community.\n\nThe legacy and spirit live on through the second, third, and fourth generations of Allan and Gertie, all outdoor enthusiasts. Currently, several of the grandsons are involved with snowmobile racing. Alex and Devon, the sons of Donavon and Chris Hetteen, own and race for Hetteen Heritage Racing.\n\n“The more you dream the more you achieve.”\n\n~Michael Phelps~\n\nTo learn more about Polaris and its history, visit the Polaris Experience Center in Roseau, Minnesota.\n\nVisit the Polaris Experience Center Website\n\nResearched and written by: Carmen Przekwas\n\nDigital Creator: Sinnamon Krings, Roseau Promotions Director\n\nAll Rights Reserved: Carmen Przekwas\n\nReferences: Mike Hetteen, Donavon Hetteen, Hetteen/Carter Archives, Roseau County Historical Society, Roseau Times Region, Grand Forks Herald, Roseau Electric Cooperative Volts and Views, YouTube, Hetteen Heritage Racing, Karolyn Eastman, Robert Przekwas, Patricia Mann\n\nRoseau Marketplace- Best Practice Guidelines for Members\n\nRoseau Marketplace - Find out How to Sell at our Summer Marketplace\n\nWelcome to Roseau Marketplace\n\nWelcome to the Roseau Farmers Market, known as the Roseau Marketplace!

Gertie was a young wife, mother of four sons, encouraging her husband, one of the three co-founders of Polaris Industries. She also was a beguiling, enterprising, keen business woman sharing the same vision and philosophy as the co-founder of Polaris Industries.\n\nAllan was one of the three co-founders of Polaris Industries in 1954, along with his older brother Edgar, and Edgar’s brother-in-law David Johnson. At the age of thirty-one Allan became President of Polaris Industries in 1960. After a controversial promotional tour across Alaska, his brother Edgar left Polaris Industries, moving his family to Alaska. In 1961 he started Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls. Shortly after changing the name to Arctic Enterprises, the new company produced snowmobiles.\n\nUnder the leadership of Allan and David Johnson, Polaris Industries was on the road to success in the development and sales of the Sno-Traveler. The employees at Polaris Industries worked every day to improve the product. Polaris Industries would eventually become one of the largest snowmobile industries in the world!\n\nAs you will recall in Part 3, in 1961 Allan had approached his wife Gertie to design a seat cushion for a more enjoyable ride. Gertie did! As a result, she started a sewing business in their home’s basement called Northern Upholstery. Soon the small business outgrew the basement.\n\nThrough her efforts and support, Gertie made a difference in so many people’s lives with her motivation. Her commitment to building a business, creating, and designing quality products and initially hiring women had an impact in the northern Minnesota rural community economically. Plus overcoming some of the restrictions women in the 1960s and early 1970s faced in the financial world.\n\nThus we captioned Part 4: Polaris Co-Founder’s Wife, the Energetic Gertie Hetteen ! Stitching the Trail to Success 1965-1973!\n\nPolaris Co-Founder's Wife - Helps by Changing The Role of Women in the 1960's in Roseau County!\n\nAlthough in 1950 the number of women working was on the rise. Newspaper ads separated jobs by gender, banks denied women credit, women were still not allowed to open a bank account in their own names, and female employees often were paid less for the same work.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1960’s when women gained the right to open a bank account. Technically, women won the right to open a bank account in the 1960s, but many banks still refused to let women do so without a signature from their husbands. In 1974 women in the U.S. were finally granted the right to open a bank account on their own.\n\nGertie was ahead of her time! Yes, Allan was her partner on paper, and helped with financing because of the restrictions set forth for the female gender in the business world. We must recognize it was Gertie in charge of the management, budgeting, operations, and hiring employees. She gave many women in Roseau County the opportunity to work outside of the home, earning income of their own.\n\nPolaris Industries Introduces Two New Models in 1965 \"The Mustang\" and 1966 \"The Colt\"!\n\nSnowmobiles were becoming the attraction of winter. The idea of racing the sleds became a natural trend. In 1965 the Polaris Mustang was introduced, proving to be a major success. The Mustang was the first of a long line of leaf-spring front suspension machines which carried Polaris through the 1960’s, 1970’s, and even into the 1980’s.\n\nWith the success of the Mustang, Polaris Industries began to accelerate in growth. The snowmobile industry was taking off and other companies began entering the business. Snowmobiling was popular throughout the United States and Canada., In 1965 Polaris started a plant in Beausejour, Manitoba to lower costs in Canada.\n\nGertie Hetteen's Northern Upholstery Moves to a New Facility in 1965!\n\nAfter the introduction of the new Polaris model, the Mustang, request orders were coming in rapidly in 1965. Due to the growing demand for increased production of the Sno-Travelers and the addition of the Canadian manufacturing plant the production orders increased at Northern Upholstery as well.\n\nWhen the Colt was introduced in 1966 orders increased even more! Due to the rapid growth of the new snowmobile models, it became necessary for Northern Upholstery to move the sewing operation to a newly constructed building on the Hetteen’s home property, east of their house.\n\nThe new Northern Upholstery Shop in the winter of 1966 was in full production!\n\nThe new facilities provided a more convenient and efficient place to work.\n\nGertie Northern Upholstery Miracle Team of 8 - 1966\n\nGertie’s Gals, the Northern Upholstery Team of 8 ladies were creating hand-sewn snowmobile seats for the Polaris snowmobile enthusiasts. The on-going improved seats were providing the snowmobilers with a more comfortable ride. Polaris Industries was growing as the snowmobile became THE sport to do for the outdoor enthusiasts. This also meant Northern Upholstery was growing.\n\nThere were eight women producing 70 snowmobiles seats per day (all sewn by hand). They were able to produce the required number of snowmobile seats daily ordered by Polaris Industries. The snowmobile company was running both a day-shift and a night-shift, producing the Polaris Sno-Traveler Mustang, and the next year including the Polaris Colt.\n\nPolaris Industries' Success Means Growth for Gertie's Gals and Guys as well! 1968\n\nThere was no break room. The enterprising ladies would find a place to solve the dilemma in any season. Gertie would go to her kitchen and make coffee when breaktime was near. After all! A lady needs her coffee!\n\nSoon a new 30-cup Coffee maker was purchased!\n\nOnce again, Gertie was inspiring her employees by trying to make the situation better. The caption of our story: Gertie Hetteen’s Northern Upholstery, Creating Perfection for Polaris Industries’ Ride 1965 -1973 indicates her ability to inspire others. She treated everyone as her equal. For example taking time by serving the group of seamstresses coffee on a fall day with a pan of fresh chocolate cake on the side! What could be more perfect!?!?\n\nPerhaps a REAL breakroom?\n\nAs the sales for snowmobiles were increasing, the snowmobile seat orders increased as well! This meant more employees were added. Space was a minimum. High school students were hired to help after school with the plywood cutting and additional work.\n\nPolaris Industries Produces the TX Model - 1968!\n\nIn 1968 Polaris Industries introduced the first of the famed TX series of snowmobiles, a series that was to run for 12 years. The TX was manufactured for one purpose, Racing and Performance – synonymous for “high-performance”!\n\nFeatured in the photo are Gerry Reese, LeRoy Lindblad, Allan Hetteen, and a Fuji Engineering reviewing the engine design.\n\nWithin a three-year period, Polaris was using Fuji engines in all of the snowmobiles manufactured in Roseau, MN.\n\nProduction of snowmobile seats increased at the Northern Upholstery Company due to the popularity of the TX series, which increase sales at Polaris Industries!\n\nNorthern Upholstery, a Vendor for Polaris Industries was Growing!\n\nNorthern Upholstery was bustling with orders. Space was becoming limited. More employees were needed which meant a larger production area was required, better lightning, more work stations additional equipment, better bathroom facilities, and so much more.\n\nBesides, it was time for the Hetteen Family to have home that was a real home, not a business office, a purchasing office, nor a seat production assembly line.\n\nA building site was chosen on land that had been a pasture for a dairy farm, conveniently located close to a state highway, railroad tracks, and less than four miles from Polaris Industries.\n\nDue to the increased demand of snowmobiles, and expansion into other markets, the manufacturing facility was built large enough to hold several business entities. Soon there were approximately 75 employees working! The original eight employees of Northern Upholstery in the basement of the Hetteen house were delighted with the spacious new facilities. The administrative and office staff intermingled with the seamstresses, checking if there were enough supplies, answering questions, keeping an open line of communication. They all worked as a team to gain success. The hard work payed off, soon it was necessary to add more square footage to the production facility.\n\nPolaris Co-Founder Allan Hetteen Resigns from Polaris, A Textron Company in 1970!\n\nAllan Hetteen, one of the three men involved in the creation of the first United States snowmobile company retired from Polaris, A Textron Company. Textron had purchased Polaris Industries in 1968. Three and one-half years later Allan became the owner and President of the Polaris distributorship called Rosco, Inc. Allan had negotiated with the Textron group following his retirement from Polaris Industries he would become a Polaris Distributor because he wanted to continue to be involved in the snowmobile business.\n\nGertie and Allan decided Rosco would become a tenant in the Northern Upholstery building. Due to inventory, the addition of a Parts Department, the need for a warehouse for Rosco, Inc., and the growth of Northern Upholstery under President Gertie Hetteen’s leadership, it became necessary to expand the building even further.\n\nNorthern Upholstery Expands, Adding Several Divisions 1970\n\nNorthern Upholstrey soon expanded to several divisions due to the new products the company was creating and manufacturing. The company continued manufacturing Polaris snowmobile seats. The Polaris Co-Founders’ wife, Gertie Hetteen, was part of the company’s success, bringing a refined seat offering comfort and style to the machines.\n\nRead the “rest of the story” soon!\n\nPlease join us for the last chapter about the entrepreneur called Gertie Hetteen and her husband Allan!\n\nTo learn more about Polaris and its history, visit the Polaris Experience Center.\n\nResearched and written by: Carmen Przekwas\n\nDigital Creator: Sinnamon Krings, Roseau Promotions\n\nDirector: All Rights Reserved: Carmen Przekwas\n\nReferences: Mike Hetteen, Donavon Hetteen, The Hetteen/Carter Archives, Roseau Country Historical Society, Roseau Times Region, Grand Forks Herald, Polaris Inc., YouTube"
