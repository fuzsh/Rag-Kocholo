        "text": "AGA food tastes better simply because an AGA cooks better, using gentle, radiant heat to retainthe food’s natural goodness and flavor. The heat steadily radiates through the ovens andhotplates, creating dedicated cooking zones at pre-set temperatures for ease, convenience andstress-free use. Heat is transferred to the cast-iron ovens and released steadily from all theinner surfaces simultaneously. This radiant heat cooking is an altogether gentler process thanthe fierce hot air of conventional ranges and is thereason AGA cooking preserves more of the food’s moisture, flavor, texture and goodness.\n\nAGA cast iron ranges offers multiple ovens with multiple temperature settings–a major benefit to any home cook. Any one of its 3 cast iron ovens will fit a 28-pound turkey with ease all the while making available additional ovens so you may simultaneously bake, slow cook or roast other dishes.\n\nFinally, the high level of insulation within the outer casing and each hotplate lid ensures fuel isused wisely and economically. And, with our more recent electric models, you can choose tohave your AGA range on when you need it and off when you don’t.\n\nYes, you read that right... it does turn off. For many, the AGA Classic is synonymous with “being on all the time”. Thankfully, with the introduction of the next generation AGA eR7, this is nolonger the case. Built with the 21st century lifestyle in mind, the AGA Classic Cast Iron RangeCollections allow their owner to have much more control over energy consumption includingthe ability to turn it off, ...or not. It’s all up to you."
