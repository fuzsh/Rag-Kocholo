        "text": "True to its name, this species has a reddish head with a rounded steep forehead, a blue-gray bill and its sides and back are grayish. The hen has a brown head and body and also a gray bill. The wings appear light tan in flight.\n\nMeasurements\n\nLength: 16.5 to 21.3 in (42 to 54 cm)\n\nWingspan: 29.5 to 31 in (75 to 79 cm)\n\nRedheads aggregate in small flocks on water deep enough to produce submersed aquatic vegetation, which are an important food source during most of the year. During migration, they gather in large flocks on big bodies of water like lakes, reservoirs and bays, but they will also use small and shallow wetlands when available. In winter, redheads can spend considerable amounts of time in coastal marshes and off shore, returning occasionally to freshwater wetlands inland to drink. Redheads are less common in the southeast than many other species of dabbling ducks, and few national wildlife refuges target management for this species. However, they likely benefit from freshwater emergent wetland management for other species."
