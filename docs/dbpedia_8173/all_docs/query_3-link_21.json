        "text": "Why You Should Visit\n\nDavis Ranch is one of the largest prairie landscapes in the Missouri Coteau. It is a mosaic of high quality northern mixed-grass prairie studded with fresh, alkaline, ephemeral and permanent wetlands. The impact of human activities has been very light in this place, with even surrounding agricultural areas having a low human population density. More than any other Conservancy preserve in North Dakota, Davis Ranch retains the \"feel\" and scale of the native prairie.\n\nSize\n\nThe overall size of Davis Ranch including the portion that was once called the Sheridan Preserve is 7,017 acres. It is the largest Conservancy Preserve in North Dakota. It extends six miles in a north-south direction and averages about 1.5 miles in width.\n\nWhy TNC Selected This Site\n\nLarge, high quality examples of several community types led the Conservancy to this site. The conservation targets include pothole wetlands, silverberry shrubland, western wheatgrass grassland, and needlegrass grassland.\n\nWhat TNC Has Done/Is Doing\n\nThe Nature Conservancy acquired Davis Ranch in 1997 and since then has been developing a stewardship program at the preserve. Our management has been focused in three areas:\n\nWe have been developing a grazing system where domestic cattle are used to mimic the historic grazing patterns of bison.\n\nIn an effort to discourage woody plant encroachment and begin the reduction of smooth brome, we have initiated a prescribed burn plan.\n\nWe are continuing to develop an integrated weed management program focused on controlling leafy spurge. We are spraying known spurge patches twice a year, and have released specalized-feeding flea beetles as a means of biological control.\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nFor more information on visiting this and other North Dakota preserves, check out our Preserve Visitation Guidelines.\n\nWhat to See: Plants\n\nThe vegetation on Davis Ranch consists of high qualityu examples of northern mixed grass prairie. Shortgrass prairie species are found in the shallow soil areas on the tops of hills, midheight species on hillsides and flat uplands, and tallgrass species on deep soils of lowlands. Dominant shortgrasses include buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). The dominant midheight grasses include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and the introduced smooth brome (Bromus inermis). The tallgrass dominants include big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and cordgrass (Spartina pectinata).\n\nWhat to See: Animals\n\nDavis Ranch is part of the \"prairie pothole\" region, an area renowned for its production of waterfowl. In fact, the Davis Ranch area includes some of the best waterfowl breeding habitat in the prairie pothole region. Besides waterfowl, Davis Ranch also is home to a high diversity of other birds. Included are a number of uncommon prairie species including Sprague’s pipit, Baird’s sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, chestnut collared longspur, black tern, ferruginous hawk, Swainson’s hawk, upland plover, willet and marbled godwits.\n\nThere are no facilities at the preserve and it is located in an isolated location. Bring everything you will need including adequate water and other supplies. The nearest facilities and supplies are in McClusky or Goodrich, some 18 miles away.\n\nThe entire preserve is leased to local neighbors for cattle grazing. Please leave all gates as you find them and take care to avoid damaging fences.\n\nHunting and Fishing Activities\n\nThe preserve is open to public walk-in hunting during the Fall hunting season. Check out our Preserve Visitation Guidelines for more information the Conservancy's hunting and fishing policies on North Dakota preserves. Download rules and a map specific to Davis Ranch."
