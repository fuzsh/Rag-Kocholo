        "text": "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Diane Margaret Parkes (Berardinelli) who passed away this past Friday, March 22nd, 2024 after complications from cancer.\n\nDiane was born in Flushing, NY on February 27th, 1939 and was the daughter of Alfred and Rose Berardinelli. Diane is survived by her children Lynn (William) Cavell and Jill (Eric) Seyfert, her four grandchildren Brittany, Courtney, Kaitlin and Megan, older sister Rosemary Henson and dog Charlie.\n\nDiane grew up most of her life in Queens, NY where she graduated from Flushing Nursing School as an RN in 1958. Diane was a beautiful soul that took pleasure and enjoyment from helping others. Growing up she enjoyed playing field hockey, roller skating, and dancing. She was first married to Peter Cirino (predeceased) in April 1960 whom she had her two daughters, Lynn and Jill, and later married Edward Parkes (predeceased) in July of 1972 where they lived happily on Pidgeon Meadow Rd. for many years. In 1994 Diane moved to Florida so she could “be near the ocean and sip her coffee” and to be closer to family with her partner Ralph Grimaldi.\n\nDiane took joy in life being with her family, loving animals (especially her dogs), attending church at Advent Lutheran in Boca Raton, Florida, and dancing. She will be greatly missed by those in her life that knew and loved her.\n\nA viewing will be held on Sunday, March 24, 2024 at Glick Funeral Home, 3600 N Federal Highway Boca Raton, FL. 33431 from 1pm to 5pm. There will also be a Memorial Service in her honor and celebrating her life at Advent Church Boca, 300 East FL-794, Boca Raton, FL 33431 from 11:30am-2:30pm on Saturday, May 11th, 2024. Friends and family are welcome to come to both to honor and celebrate Diane’s life.\n\nIf you would like to donate in honor of Diane’s love for animals you can donate to the Humane Society in her name.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Diane Parkes, please visit our floral store."
