He leaves behind his loving wife of 49 years, Debbie Parker, three sons; Mike Parker (Sharon), Matthew Parker (Jamina), & Mark Parker (Amy), as well as 7 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. He also leaves behind two sisters; Shirley Ledford and Betty Ledford. He loved his family and set a great example of a godly family man.\n\nLarry worked for 29 years at Volunteer Electric but his best-known job by all who knew him would be his avid trading.\n\nHe ran antique auctions for close to 10 years, and he is also known for his trading in livestock and equipment.\n\nVisitation will be held from 4:00 PM-8:00 PM at Mt. Olive Ministries, Wednesday, June 23, 2021. A Celebration of Life will be held on Thursday, June 24, 2021, 10:00 AM at the church with Pastor Gary Sears and Carl R. Hobbs, officiating.
