The Federal south wing was built in 1858 by Edward’s maternal grandfather, John Dewint Smith (1806–1871), a farmer in Orangetown, and Martha Griffiths Smith (1817-1892), a daughter of Baptist pastor Joseph W. Griffiths. (John Smith was from the family who once owned the the DeWint House in Tappan, NJ, where George Washington headquartered during the Revolutionary War.) The lot was among the ‘handsome building sites’ advertised in 1856-57 for $250 to $300 each on a newly subdivided 37-acre tract of land along the road to Hook Mountain and a block from the water’s edge.\n\nEdward Hopper House in 1912\n\n​In the year Edward was born (1882), his widowed grandmother (Martha) added onto the house to accommodate her expanding family which now included her only child Elizabeth (1854-1935), “Lizzie”’s spouse, Garret Henry Hopper (1852-1913; married 1879) their two-year old daughter Marion (1880-1966), and infant son, Edward.\n\nThe Victorian north wing added a parlor and kitchen (completed by 1883/84) on the ground floor, and a second story (begun 1886?) with a bathroom, large bedroom, and smaller space likely for a housemaid. The addition’s façade updated the original Greek Revival house, with modest yet fashionable Queen Ann style details of a front gable, shingles, and bay windows.\n\n​The house’s location afforded “the would-be artist”—as Edward inscribed on his childhood pencil box—a vantage point to observe and sketch. Set at the T-junction of North Broadway and Second Avenue, the house’s porch and windows offered a direct view of the Hudson River with its bustling traffic. Inside the house, shafts of southern light throughout the day streamed in the windows enlivening the living room, parlor, and Edward’s bedroom.\n\nEdward's sister Marion lived in the family home throughout her lifetime; Edward and wife Josephine would often return to Nyack even though Edward resided after 1913 at 3 Washington Square North in New York City.\n\nMarion died in 1965, Edward in 1967, and Josephine passed away in 1968. They are buried in a family plot at Nyack's Oak Hill Cemetery. ​After Hopper’s death, the house fell into disrepair. In 1971, Edward Hopper’s birthplace and family home was saved from demolition and founded as a nonprofit organization by people in the community who were devoted to preserving Hopper’s home and legacy in Nyack.\n\nRestoration 1971\n\nVolunteers at Edward Hopper House, circa 1973\n\n5 Seven A.M.\n\n​- 318 N Broadway\n\nThis building was built 1884/1885. The Hopper’s family butcher once had a store here, and the building inspired Hopper’s oil painting Seven AM, painted in 1948 when Hopper was in his sixties. Responding to the painting’s mysterious quality, Jo quipped that the storefront may have been a “blind pig”- slang for a blue collar speakeasy.\n\nLocal historian Winston C. Perry, Jr, gives more detail about this location: \"My grandfather (Harry H. Perry) was storekeeper in this building in the 1890s. It also served as post office: just a set of cubby-holes on the counter. The merchandise was displayed on 2 floors - first and second floors. He went bankrupt after a few years. I guess maybe it was a little too ambitious a business for this little neighborhood.\" Courtesy \"A Walk with Win Perry,\" Nyack Library Local History Collection.​\n\nEdward Hopper, Seven A.M., 1948, Oil on canvas, 30 3/16 × 40 1/8in.

With artist materials in hand, Edward took regular walks and went on long bike rides along rural roads and trails that ringed Nyack and led to Hook Mountain, the rocky promontory that looks over the lower Hudson’s Tappan Zee.\n\nEarly Dutch sailors who found themselves either becalmed or experiencing sudden storms at the river bend called the area a \"tedious angle\" (verdrietege hoek), and “Hoek” was anglicized as Hook.\n\nDuring Hopper’s boyhood, Hook Mountain was the site of a large-scale trap rock mining quarry. Stone was dynamited from the mountain face, crushed, and shipped on large barges to help build New York City roads, buildings, and train tracks. The quarry can be clearly seen in Hopper’s watercolor as a light brown swath in the middle. Hopper has accurately included some of the quarry-operation's details: buildings that crushed the rock can be seen part way up the rock face. A loading dock stretches out into the river. To the left of the dock is the power station for the quarry. This building remains, it was made over into a bathhouse in the 1930s. The quarry was acquired and preserved by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in 1908 to become Hook Mountain and Nyack Beach State Parks.\n\nHook Mountain is now a National Natural Landmark with walking trails, hawk-watching, and stunning views.\n\nEdward Hopper, (Hook Mountain, Nyack), c. 1899, Watercolor and graphite pencil on paper, Sheet: 5 1/16 × 6 7/8in.

Please respect our neighbors' privacy.\n\n​The Hopper's house was one of many residences being built which created a new neighborhood within the village of Nyack. The homes on First Avenue were built around the same time as Hopper’s house. Some of Edward's friends lived nearby on First Avenue. Many of the houses along First to Third avenues appear the same as they did when Hopper was a youth.\n\nThe house at #16 First Avenue was built circa 1850 by William Dickey (see site 1: “Miss Dickey’s School”). #8 was built by the Burr family who owned a shoe factory, #12, an Italianate-style house, was built by Dr. Davison, and #16 was built in a carpenter gothic style by the Dickey family who later moved to Marion Street.\n\n#8, #12, and #16 appear much as they did when teenage Hopper visited friends at #16 and #24.\n\n(1907?-1915?) First Avenue, looking towards the Hudson River.\n\n11 G. H. Hopper'S Dry Goods Store\n\n​- 10 S Broadway\n\nAt the time of Hopper’s birth, Nyack’s economy was evolving from traditional local manufacturing and maritime businesses towards a new commercial economy tied more closely by the railroad to metropolitan New York and to seasonal tourism and recreation.\n\nEdward’s father, Garret Henry Hopper, owned a dry goods emporium located at 10 South Broadway in the “Commercial Building” from 1890-1906 (now Grace’s Thrift Shop; while the 4-story original Commercial Building is now gone, the adjoining 8 South Broadway \"Everett Hotel\" is still intact).\n\nGarret started his operation by buying out Morris & Minnerly in 1890, then William O. Blauvelt in 1892, and ran his retail operation until retirement in 1906.\n\nMr. Hopper's Dry Goods Establishment In Fine Condition. (Rockland County Journal, 9 March 1895)\n\n“Mr G.H. Hopper has just completed extensive alterations and improvements in his dry goods establishment, on Broadway, and the store is now more attractive than ever before. Painting and decorating have been done on a large scale, new fixtures have been added, and a number of notable changes made. The store is bright and cheerful looking in its new dress, and expressions of admiration are heard on every hand. New goods are being received daily, and Mr. Hopper is fully prepared for the Spring trade. Drop in and take a look at the popular establishment.”\n\nWhile Edward was a teenager attending high school in Nyack, Edward also worked at the store selling flannel, muslin, blankets, men’s shirts, ladies’ vests, corsets, and socks.\n\nCirca 1900, South Broadway from Burd Street, looking north.

By Edward’s birth, Nyack’s thriving economy brought with it the typical turn-of-the century low-rise brick buildings with storefronts on street level and walkup apartments. Hopper regularly walked and cycled the corridors of Broadway and Main streets. Here, he headed to school, attended church with family, shopped with his mother, helped at his father’s dry goods store, exercised at the Y.M.C.A., and caught the ferry or train for New York City.\n\nHopper investigated and rendered his surroundings. His early drawings make clear an emerging attraction to themes of storefronts, lone workers and figures, and interiors.\n\nNorth Broadway, c. 1905: The brick Voorhis Building (built 1878) on the corner of Main and North Broadway held several businesses, from a clothier to a gaslight and fuel company.

By 1900, states varied considerably in whether they had child labor standards and in their content and degree of enforcement(The University of Iowa Labor Center).* The public high school, now with athletics, music, and other extracurriculars, made Hopper’s peer group socially visible as a specific ‘generation’ in the community. During adolescence, Hopper was drawn to the leisure and social world of summertime.\n\n“Child Labor in U.S. History.” The University of Iowa Labor Center, 27 December 2022, https://laborcenter.uiowa.edu/special-projects/child-labor-public-education-project/about-child-labor/child-labor-us-history.\n\nCYCLING\n\nIn addition to long walks, Edward was an enthusiast of cycling - an activity in which females could now also fully engage. With artist materials in hand, Edward took regular treks along rural roads and trails that ringed Nyack and led to Hook Mountain, the rocky promontory that looks over the lower Hudson’s Tappan Zee.\n\nNyack still boasts a thriving cycling culture, as 9W remains a picturesque route through the lower Hudson Valley.\n\nRB: Rockland Bicycle Works was in a one-story building at 137 Main Street (where M&T Bank is now located).\n\n(1902?)

Together with his friends Harry MacArthur and Louis Blauvelt, they made up a “secret association” (1896-1898) called the “Three Commodores” which revolved around sailing and other boat related activities complete with official insignia flags, meetings, minutes and club rules.\n\nEdward Hopper as a child seated in a rowboat, New York (c. 1890-93), silver gelatin print.

The business headquarters were in the Commercial Building - the same building where Garret Hopper had his dry goods store. The ice pond was located at the top of the hill (which no doubt helped the ice wagons to distribute the ice to homes on their way down the hill).\n\nNyack Ice Company around the turn of century.

Grover Cleveland stayed there twice in 1889, between his two terms as US President. This renowned hotel was high above the village, on site of north campus of Nyack College. (It burned down on June 1, 1898.)\n\nNyack News and Views has a nice article, written by friend of Edward Hopper House and Board Member Mike Hays, about a couple erstwhile resort hotels in Nyack. ​\n\nThe front entrance of the four-story Prospect House (prior to 1898) with center tower and covered porch shines in the morning sunlight.
