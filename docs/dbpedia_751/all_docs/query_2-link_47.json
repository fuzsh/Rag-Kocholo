In 1888 he moved to the USA and settled in Pasadena, California where over the next decade he designed a number of residences. During the 1890s he was employed by the Los Angeles architect Lester Sherwood Moore (1872-1924).\n\nParkes died in Pasadena on 25 March 1900. In an obituary notice in the 'Pasadena Daily Evening Star of 26 March 1900, the author observed that Parkes \"was designer of some of the finest residences in this city\""
