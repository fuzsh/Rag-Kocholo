When true collaboration works, you can achieve anything. So what is is a true collaboration? True collaboration, simply put, is so much more than support. It brings knowledge, money, staff, engagement and resources to bear for the mutual benefit of a group of companies. This is what I was looking for, when I started my investment search. I wanted to find people that were totally like minded and that had ridiculous passion for wanting to do something extremely amazing and special. Not an easy thing to do, I can tell you. However, I did find exactly what I was looking for, and how excited are we.. The last couple of days I have been in Coventry and Leicester, at our sister company AT Management Ltd sites, it was absolutely brilliant, loved every moment. Infact skipped through one of the floors with Patricia Garcia, through just sheer joy 😉 so much fun.. Patricia is Director of Product & Solutions SA Comm UK, so thrilled to be working together, the vision, the solutions, the discussions we have already had, can't wait for our next meet on Friday. And today I am off to a The UK Contact Centre Forum event in London, with the wonderful Jo Regan-Iles, who leads people and culture, as you can imagine, me and Jo are so aligned on people experience. See you later Trevor Butterworth.. Now I have to say a word about AT Management Ltd - a little teaser at the moment, these are definitely a best kept secret, you should see what they do with Sales and Regeneration, utterly outstanding..... So here is to true collaboration, and here's to our group. The Verity Centre (15) Ltd, AT Management Ltd, SA Comm UK and SA Commercial. A group working together, stronger together, unbeatable together. Find out more, keep watching...... www.tvc15.co.uk #collaboration #partnership #business #marketing #contentmarketing #contactcentres #customerexperience #sales #regeneration #retention #financialservices #insurance #banking #medical #pharma #retail #energy #oilandgas #university\n\nNetworking and cooperation are critical components of the IT sector, as they promote innovation, problem solving, and professional development. In today's interconnected world, networking allows IT professionals to keep up with the latest trends, tools, and best practices. By attending industry events, seminars, and online forums, IT professionals may share ideas, insights, and learn from one another's experiences. Furthermore, networking extends beyond individual professions and includes organizations and communities. Collaboration among IT businesses, academic institutions, and government bodies encourages technological improvements and the creation of innovative solutions. Businesses can use partnerships and alliances to exploit each other's strengths, broaden their reach, and more effectively address complicated challenges. To prosper, IT departments must develop a culture of collaboration and teamwork inside their organizations. Cross-functional collaboration promotes the sharing of knowledge and skills, resulting in more inventive and robust solutions. IT teams may work together to streamline processes, optimize resources, and provide value to stakeholders more efficiently. #ITNetworking #ProfessionalGrowth #TechInnovation #CollaborationMatters #IndustryTrends #KnowledgeSharing #CrossFunctionalTeams #Thoughts"
