Meador, Jr.\n\n* CALS COLUMN *\n\nIn our recent record of the Hays family of Smith County, we reported that we did not have time or space for the report on the family for the year 1840, as given in the Smith County census or that year. It is as follows: Archibald Haise, one male from 30 to 40 years of age, himself, we are sure; and one female between 15 and 20. Near neighbors of this family in 1840 were: Rufus Hanes, J. C. Williams, Alexander Casada, William Franklin, Richard Parkes, Edward Draper and Elizabeth West. From the neighbors, we would judge that the family lived 155 years ago on the lower end of Defeated Creek.\n\nNancy Haise lived in Smith County in the year 1840. She appears to have been a widow. In her family were: Two males from five to 10, and two from 10 to 15. Females: One under five, one from 30 to 40 and one from 40 to 50, we would judge to have been Nancy. Near neighbors were: Turner Harris, D. C. McDowell, Edward Mitchell, David Smith, Mary McEntire, and Daniel Dillard. We are not positive as to where these live more than a hundred years ago, but believed they lived in the Chestnut Mound section of Smith County.\n\nFrancis Hase lived in Smith County in the census above referred to. He had: One male under five, and one from 20 to 30 years old, himself, we suppose. Females: One from 15 to 20, and one from 20 to 30. Near neighbors were: Ezekiel West, Stephen Hanes, William Dyer, John Reece, Josiah Reece and Chloman Mathas. We would judge that this Hays family lived on lower Defeated Creek, which was a few miles southeast of the boyhood home of the writer.\n\nRobert Hayes was another head of a family in Smith County 115 years ago. In his family were: One male 40 to 50, one female from 15 to 20 and one female 40 to 50 years of age, who appears to have been a pensioner, but we do not know from what war. Near neighbors were: P. Coggins, E. Warren, Robert S. Betty, Willis Coggins, William Exum and Joe Exum. We have but little way of knowing in what section of Smith County, this family resided.\n\nReuben Hase appears to have been an old man in Smith County in the year 1840 and is listed as being between 70 and 80 years of age. However, there was a male between 10 and 15, and another between 15 and 20. There were females: Two form 20 to 30 and one from 60 to 70, supposedly Mrs. Reuben Hase. Living next door to Reuben Hase was Reuben L. Hase, supposed to have been the son of the Reuben Hase, first named above. He had: One male under five and one from 20 to 30, supposedly Reuben L. Hase: and two females, one from 10 to 15, and one form 20 to 30, supposedly Mrs. Reuben L. Hase. Their neighbors were: James Barnett, Samuel H. Wilson, Martha Crawford, Wilis Gibbs, William Lechford (Litchford?), Henry Williams and John Enicks (Enoch?). The general location of these two families appears to have been to the southwest of the present Carthage, approximately between the present Rock City and New Middleton. This is the last member of the family of Hays, given as in its various spellings in the census of 1840 in Smith County, Tenn.\n\nThere is not one member of the family of Hays or Hayes or other spelling of the name listed in the Smith County census for 1870, which indicates that they had removed form the county some time between 1850 and 1870.\n\nWe have a lot of other information about the members of the Hayes family in its various spellings. We find that on Dec. 15, 1837, Joseph Con married Deliton Hay in Knox County, Tenn. In the same county on June 24, 1840, Benjamin Hay married Huldy Tidwell.\n\nJane Hayes was born March 22, 1772, in Virginia and married Henry Shannon.

He was 107 years of age.\n\nMr. Simons, until recently when he became ill, lived alone on his 94-acre farm near Siloam, in the west end of this county. He did his own housekeeping and cooking and farmed some, even in his last years.\n\nMr. Simons was the subject of a feature article in this newspaper in April of last year, and at that time was very active despite his advanced years. He talked very sensibly and his hearing was but little impaired.\n\nBorn December 8, 1847, in Madison, Indiana, of German immigrants, the little, gray-bearded man came to Tennessee at the age of four. He was first married at the age of 19, and shortly after that started work at Gallatin. Later he worked in Nashville before opening a small stor Jeear Siloam.\n\nOf sixteen children born to Mr. Simons, only a son and two granddaughters survive. They are: Mrs. Annie Suddarth, of Gallatin, Mrs. Julia Binkley, of Nashville, and Hubert Simons, of Westmoreland.
