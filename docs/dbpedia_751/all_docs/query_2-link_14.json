She died on September 17, 1880, on board Royal Mail Ship Don at Southampton.\n\nMarried Elizabeth Parkes (widow of George Parkes, Esq. Tyseley, Worchestershire) on August 29, 1885, in Kings Norton, Worcestershire, England\n\nI was looking over your newest entries for George Edward Parkes. I haven't done much updating myself because I'm trying to verify my findings. I thought I would pass on some family information in case that helps things.\n\nI do believe George Edward Parkes was born in 1832 (not 1830,) but they weren't too particular about these dates back then so perhaps it's close enough? I'm trying to find accuracy on that.\n\nG.E. Parkes was my great-great grandfather. He was born in Birmingham and was twice married. He was a Cunard Chief Officer and his main shipping line was from England to Jamaica. We have old family black and white photos of trips to Jamaica, Canada and England. George purchased a plantation in Jamaica and, while he had his main residence in England, he also lived parts of the year in Jamaica. While in Jamaica his wife (I think it was Sarah Ann, but I'm not confident of that,) was bitten by a spider and died. George married a second time, which may be Elizabeth, but I'm not sure. Our family oral history tells that George married someone from Jamaica, but I have no confirmation of that.\n\nI'm having trouble confirming information about George. I can confirm that his son, George Edward Parkes, was born in 1866 as this is my great-grandfather.\n\nI'm trying the Cunard connection first to flesh out information on George senior, but I'm tripping up on the double marriage. My father has confirmed that George worked for Cunard and that he was married twice. The first marriage produced his children.\n\nThanks for the information you added! I'll try to add and tidy up mine as I go.\n\nSource: Catherine Parkes (March 4, 2017)\n\nRecords\n\nEngland Births and Christening:\n\nName George Edward Parkes\n\nGender Male\n\nChristening Date 26 May 1830\n\nChristening Place SAINT PHILLIPS, BIRMINGHAM, WARWICK, ENGLAND\n\nBirth Date 28 Apr 1830\n\nFather's Name Samuel Parkes\n\nMother's Name Mary Wheeler\n\nUK and Ireland, Masters and Mates Certificate:\n\nName: George Edward Parkes\n\nEstimated Age: 31\n\nBirth Date: 1831\n\nBirth Place: Birmingham, Warwick\n\nIssue Date: 18 Aug 1862\n\nIssue Port: Southampton\n\nCertificate Number: 8654\n\nRecord of Marriage:\n\nName George Edward Parkes\n\nSpouse's Name Sarah Ann Parkes\n\nEvent Date 23 Mar 1858\n\nEvent Place Saint Swithin, Worcester, Worcestershire, England\n\nEngland and Wales Marriage Registration:\n\nName George Edward Parkes\n\nName Elizabeth Parkes\n\nEvent Type Marriage\n\nRegistration Quarter Jul-Aug-Sep\n\nRegistration Year 1885\n\nRegistration District Kings Norton\n\nCounty Worcestershire\n\nEvent Place Kings Norton, Worcestershire, England\n\nVolume 6C\n\nPage 573\n\nLine Number 113\n\nCensus\n\nEngland Census 1841 (living in High Street, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England):\n\nSamuel Parkes Male 38y 1803 (not born in Warwickshire) TOBACCONIST\n\nMary Parkes Female 39y 1802 (not born in Warwickshire)\n\nGeorge Parkes Male 11y 1830 Warwickshire, England\n\nMary A Parkes Female 4y 1837 Warwickshire, England\n\nThomas Sale Male 21y 1820 Warwickshire, England\n\nJane Ash Female 20y 1821 (not born in Warwickshire)\n\nJane Collins Female 19y 1822 Warwickshire, England\n\nEngland Census 1871 (living in Obelisk Road Pilton Villa, St Mary Extra, South Stoneham, Hampshire, England):\n\nGeorge E Parkes Head Male 39y 1832 Warwickshire, England CHIEF OFFICE S SHIP (M SERVICE)\n\nSarah A Parkes Wife Female 38y 1833 Worcestershire, England\n\nAnnie Gertrude Parkes Daughter Female 7y 1864 Worcestershire, England SCHOLAR\n\nGeorge E Parkes Son Male 5y 1866 Hampshire, England SCHOLAR\n\nWilliam E Parkes Son Male 4y 1867 Hampshire, England\n\nSusan White Servant Female 19y 1852 Hampshire, England\n\nEmma Sutton Servant Female 19y 1852 Hampshire, England\n\nEngland Census 1891 (living in Weimer, Durley Gardens, Bournemouth, Holdenhurst, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England):\n\nGeorge Parkes Lodger M Married 59y 1832 Warwickshire, England RETIRED MARINER\n\nElizabeth Parkes Lodger F Married 59y 1832 Worcestershire, England\n\nEngland Census 1901 (living in 1, St Marys Road, Leamington, Leamington Priors, Warwick, Warwickshire, England):\n\nGeorge E Parkes Head Married Male 70y 1831 Birmingham, Warwickshire, England CAPTAIN ROYAL MAIL SERVICE (RETIRED)\n\nElizabeth Parkes Wife Married Female 69y 1832 Strensham, Worcestershire, England\n\nAlice M Starkey Servant Single Female 30y 1871 Cook (Domestic) Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England\n\nAgnes S Burgess Servant Single Female 21y 1880 Housemaid (Domestic) Reading, Berkshire, England\n\nSources\n\n\"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NPVW-BX1 : 30 December 2014), George Edward Parkes, 26 May 1830;
