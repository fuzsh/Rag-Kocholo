The County Council was abandoned in 1986 when the individual boroughs that made it up took control over their own destinies.\n\nThe historic townships of the Borough were sub-divisions of the ecclesiastical and civil parishes. Most of them owe their origins to the settlements that took place in the early to mid Anglo-Saxon period and are therefore well over 1,000 years old. All the place-names are Early English (Anglo-Saxon). The Township included the whole area of the community, including: - the paddocks and closes which surrounded it and the arable open fields which surrounded them. Woodland, meadow and pasture land often occupied the outer limits of the township. They were in fact self sufficient units of farming communities. The settlements were the occupied or built up areas of the Townships. They included the village, hamlet or town.\n\nAll maps are representations of what the cartographer wishes to show in the landscape based on what he or she knows or can find out.

Summary\n\nThis section contains the main parts of the Parkes story: each of our direct ancestors (Richard, Josiah 1 & 2, and William Edmund) has his own section with more details. Likewise, the distaff side also has more on their details.\n\nOur Parkes family originated in the West Midlands and were the founders and major shareholders in Josiah Parkes & Sons , lock manufacturers of Willenhall, whose trademark \"Union\" became well known in the world building trade. At its peak, the company employed best part of 2000 people and had subsidiary factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Singapore.\n\nThe Parkes name, unusual in much of England, is very common in the Midlands. In a later section, I have examined a number of recognisable Parkes families in the area around Dudley, south west of Wolverhampton. They were mainly traders and early industrial workers: there was a big family of nailers making the hand made nails by the million. Another, somewhat more up market were farmers and businessmen around Dudley; a branch of this family moved to Warwick where they were mercers: the family of Hillaire Belloc, the writer was of this branch. There was, like many industrial families of the time, a strong non-conformist element. My Parkes grand parents were brought up as Methodists, although Arthur supported the Anglican church later.\n\nThey married into various local families, some of whom were migrants from the country areas, presumably in search of work. The rise of this family and the country immigrants to the industrial areas is an example of the way the population moved and built up during and after the English Industrial Revolution.\n\nProfessor Sir Alan Sterling Parkes FRS, son of ET Parkes, son of Josiah Parkes 2, was granted Arms in about 1982. His pedigree researched by the College of Arms, showed our earliest Parkes ancestor was Richard, the father of Josiah Parkes 1, who was a master baker from Dudley, born abt 1742, and married Jane Dunton in 1774 (our ancestor and third of his four wives); from the dates of his will and probate, he died spring 1808: this is confirmed by A3M. The college failed to find any convincing forebears of Richard: there was such a plethora of Parkess in the area then that it is very difficult to separate them. Whilst his will is held at Worcester (of which I have a copy), I have found no record of his burial, which the college may have done to establish a birth date of about 1742, although that may have been based on his first marriage.\n\nAn indenture of 1796 relating to the sale and title of a small piece of land in Dudley clearly shows the sons of Richard, a baker of Dudley, and mentions Jane Duntons father and mother. The land contained 3 tenements, built by the then occupier.\n\nOur Richard was of a non conformist (probably Presbyterian) family: the records of such churches and chapels were not always to be found. Those that exist in a published form such as the Quakers show that each congregation covered a relatively large area. His 4 children were baptised in the Old meeting House in Dudley, as were the family of his Dunton in-laws.\n\nJane Duntons father Isaac, and grandfather, Thomas were both Shoemakers/Cordwainers in Dudley and, like the Parkess, dissenters. Thomass marriage in 1657 in St Thomas Dudley implies a non conformist marriage: this was to a Judith Blakemore. The only woman of this name and time found was born well to the north of Wolverhampton; if they were Quakers, this is unlikely, but not impossible. It should be remembered that this was a time of great upheaval during the Civil War, and records were at times incomplete. The Duntons also intermarried with the Whitehouse and Fellows families, both common in the area.\n\nAn extensive study of Parkes wills of the area shows none that refer to a Richard Parkes of the right time. More recent research in Dudley revealed a little more about him, deeds show him selling some property in Dudley; as well as a baker, he was probably the mayor of Dudley in 1781 and a man of some substance: more detail is given under his own section. There was an earlier Dudley Parkes family, one of whom, William was also a baker and mayor of Dudley in the mid 18thC : they had property at Watsons Green just outside the town. it seems very unlikely that they were not related, but no connection has been found (yet, Sep 2017).\n\nA possible line might have been Richards father, William (generation 9 below) & his father Richard in Tipton, but this is in the realms of speculation.\n\nDudley, by Turner about 1832.[1]\n\nOur line continues from Josiah, the son of Richards third wife (of four), Jane Dunton, whose family goes back to the early 17thC in Dudley.\n\nJosiah, probably like many of his era, moved around the SW Staffordshire area: he first appears in a 1796 indenture where he is described as a Grocer & Chandler of Wolverhampton[2]. He then became a schoolmaster when his first 2 sons by Beatrice Turner were born in 1823, resident in Upper Gornal, between Wolverhampton and Bilston, Staffordshire. His son Richard was born in Bobbington Heath, a little to the west of Wolverhampton, in 1830, where Josiah was still a schoolteacher. The Bobbington Charity School is mentioned in the 1827 Enclosure Map: it was founded in 1792 by 2 Corbett sisters and Josiah must have been one of the earlier teachers there. By 1839, he had moved to Bilston and was a (silk) dyer and was living in Oxford St, Bilston by 1841 where he died n 1845. Beatrice, his widow later married Edward Whitehead, a grocer, also living in Oxford St. Josiahs age of 62 in the 1841 Census is not reliable: the figure on his death certificate agrees with the birth given above. He was also shown as a tallow chandler at some time later in life (son Georges marriage, 10 years after Josiahs death).\n\nJosiah was a widower when he married Beatrice Turner in 1821, but no reliable information has been found about his earlier wife/wives. Three possibilities are shown on the IGI. Some ideas on this are in Josiahs detailed section. The Turners came from an extensive, mainly agricultural, family in and around Bobbington, South West of Wolverhampton, probably explaining his time teaching in that village. A later section gives more detail of her family.\n\nJosiah and Beatrice had 5 sons who are recorded on the censuses. Not all have been found on the parish records, so there may have been other children who did not survive. They were very probably non conformists, and not all those records have survived, or been indexed. The 5 survivors left long lines of descendants: these are shown in detail under Josiah Parkes (1) section later.\n\nJosiah and his elder brother, William, were both born in Gornal, and were non conformists: Josiah 2's eldest son, William Edmund was a Methodist and brought his sons up in that branch of Christianity. The Methodist church was strong in the industrial areas in Victorian times, and encouraged the widespread use of biblical names for the children[3].\n\nBilston by Henry Warren mid 19thC\n\nJosiahs eldest 2 sons, William & Josiah 2, were the founders of the iron merchant business, which eventually became the lock manufacturer of Josiah Parkes & Sons (JP&S). Both had a number of sons.\n\nJosiah 2's wife, Catherine Cope, was from a Warwickshire yeoman farming family who migrated into the Midlands for work on the then newly built canals. They were a large family centred round Polesworth. Some stayed there and others, Catherines father included, were migrants (see later in this paper). The Copes can be traced back into the 17thC.\n\nJosiah & Catherine had 4 daughters and 5 sons, all of whom, except one daughter, had children and left many descendants: several of the sons were at one time or other in family lock business. A fuller description of this extensive family is in Josiah 2s detail section. They were good example of a successful Victorian manufacturing business family.\n\nJosiah 2 and his brother, William began their partnership in the 1840s as iron merchants, having premises at 28, 29 and 30 Doctor's Piece, Willenhall. Josiah Parkes had been apprenticed to Hickman's Iron Works in Bilston and was an iron roller, living with his parents in Oxford Street, between 1841 and 1847, when he was married, but in the evenings he helped his brothers in the ironmongery. His wife's family also lived in Bilston, where her father was a labourer. When he was 27, he and his wife, Catherine, moved to premises at 3, Union Street and Josiah began working full-time in the ironmongers. The Parkes brothers traded very successfully in iron and steel with the locksmiths and also traded in the smith's finished products. For a period, they were in partnership with Edwin James Tonks, trading as EJ Tonks; the partnership was dissolved in 1863 and Tonks went on as a padlock maker.\n\nIn these early days, the lock industry was fragmented: many men had specialised parts of the trade and would be shown as key makers or other components. Most small businesses at this time operated out of workshops at the back of their houses and this is what William and Josiah had been doing. As the industry became bigger, it became more integrated and a few big firms such as JP&S, Legge and others emerged producing a range of locking devices from one factory.\n\nIn 1861 the brothers moved to larger premises - William to 78 Union St with his wife, Elizabeth and four children, and Josiah to 77 Union St with his wife and five children. As the business grew the Parkes children came into the Company. William's three sons all joined as iron merchants clerks.\n\nJosiah Parkes had five sons, who were younger than their cousins. Friction developed between the two families about who was going to control the business. To resolve the problem, William and Josiah dissolved the partnership in 1874 and set up two separate businesses, Josiah Parkes and Sons and Parkes, Parkes and Co., both trading from the same address.\n\nLater, in 1880, Parkes, Parkes & Co were at 88 Union St, Rim lock makers. Parkes, Parkes & Co were at first Factors & Iron merchants with William & his sons Samuel & Josiah; in 1879, Samuel left the partnership and set up on his own as a hardware merchant, as Samuel Parkes & Co, although later he seemed to have become involved in the lock business. Samuels younger brother, another Josiah became a brass founder.\n\nDuring the 1870's and 1880's, the company expanded when Josiah's sons joined the company and Josiah set up a company with one of his sons - William Edmund - as iron merchants and hardware factors and they moved into 28 Doctor's Piece. By 1880 business was doing well enough for Josiah to employ three men and expand the premises to 18, 29 & 30 Doctor's Piece, and Josiah Parkes, jnr and John Parkes both joined the firm, which changed its name to Josiah Parkes and Sons. William Edmund concentrated on the hardware section and Josiah looked after the iron merchanting.\n\nIn 1887 Josiah Parkes Snr retired and in January 1888 a new partnership under the same name was established between William Edmund, John and James Harry Parkes. Josiah Parkes Jnr carried on the iron merchanting business by himself, whilst the other brothers decided to concentrate on the manufacture of locks[4].\n\nAs well as those of his sons who joined him in the business, two of his sons-in-law, Leonard Baxter (who married two of Josiah's daughters in turn, Beatrice and Elizabeth) and Richard Foster, married to Charlotte, were also involved[5].\n\nJosiah remained involved with the business as is shown by a photograph of the staff of JP&S with Josiah (and Catherine looking very severe and unamused Victorian) in the guise of the patriarch.\n\nThe family 1892\n\nBack Row: John, ET, Josiah jnr, Richard Foster\n\n2nd from back: L Baxter, Harry P, Mrs Harry, Mrs John (?), Mrs ET, Mrs Josiah Mrs WEP, WEP.\n\n2nd from Front: Mrs Baxter, Josiah snr, Mrs Josiah, Mrs R Foster, ??.\n\nFront Row: Miss L Foster, Miss F Parkes, CWP, EJ Foster.\n\nSome press reports (quoted under his detail section) show that Josiah snr was a liberal, and sometime vice president of the Willenhall Liberal Association. He was also involved with the National Schools of Willenhall, and spoke out in favour of a large proportion of a school board being dissenters: this was probably supporting his own religious convictions. On the other hand, 2 of his sons, Samuel & Josiah jnr were at a Conservative meeting in Willenhall in 1885.\n\nAfter Josiah 2s death in 1899, the lock business was continued into the 20thC by Josiah 2's eldest son, WEP and later by WEP's sons, Cyril and Arthur: several of Williams brothers and brothers in law were from time to time involved in the lock business.\n\nWilliam was appointed a magistrate in 1917, and was at one time chairman of the Willenhall council. His detailed section contains more on his life. Williams wife, Elizabeth Fryer, came from a family of painters and decorators from near Alcester in Warwickshire who had spread out into the West Midlands. Arthur Parkes was the grandfather of the author of this paper. This male Parkes line died out with Arthur and Cyril, both of whom had daughters only. The family remained involved in the business for one more generation, with Donald Maitland who married Arthur's elder daughter, Rosemary. Arthur & Cyrils cousin, Ted Fryer also joined the company and became chairman after Arthur.\n\nThe Parkes & Fryers lived at various times in Doctors Piece, Willenhall: somewhere that achieved a gruesome distinction of being one of the places of emergency burial in the Cholera outbreaks in 1832 & 1849.\n\nThere were Parkes in Willenhall in 1770 Trade Directory, but probably not our branch. They were Brass Knob Lock Makers of Little London. The trade directories of the time show how the manual trades of an industry such as lockmaking were divided, showing people with specific trades such as key maker. In later times, these specialities disappeared into the main businesses. An interesting effect of this early craft industry was that locks and door furniture were personal, valuable property. Many pre industrialisation doors show how the door furniture was changed frequently as owners moved on, taking their locks with them.\n\nPapers on industrialisation in Britain, with reference to Canals, and other items of interest is found here.\n\nOther Parkes round Dudley:\n\nA small book about the early iron making round Dudley mentions a Richard Parkes, but in the mid 17thC.[6] It is mainly concerned with Dud Dudleys attempts to patent his method of iron smelting using coal: important at the time to reduce the denuding of the native woodlands of England.\n\nThere were a lot of Parkess in the area around Dudley, many with similar names. There are a number of wills in Worcester and in Lichfield for the Staffordshire parishes. A study of them links some together, but there are a surprising number where there are no related parish birth, marriage & death records. Where the will names a wife (often my now wife), there is no certainty at all that she was the mother of all or any of the testators children.\n\nThey can, to a certain extent, be traced by land references in deeds and wills. However, by the mid 19thC, most of the agricultural holdings had disappeared under mines and industrial buildings.\n\nThere seem to have been several family groups:\n\nOne was an influential group in Sedgley, who died out in the mid 17thC, the manor of Sedgley passing from them to Lord Ward. They were the Parkes or Parkshouse family of Willingsworth, near Wednesbury, who married into the Lord Ward family, the only descendant appearing to have been Ann Parkes who married William Ward, of Birmingham.\n\nOther identifiable families were yeomen of Halesowen area, others as nailers.\n\nAn extensive group were the family of the William Parkes who was a baker and mayor of Dudley, but no obvious connection has been found. This family starts with William Parkes, a maltster, still alive in 1735, and his son, William the baker, who was married 1726 and died about 1769. Son Williams descendants move away from the area to Warwickshire. William II would have been almost a generation older than our Richard, but there is no obvious connection. William II and his son William IIIs wills make no mention of any Richard. They were probably of the family who were ancestors of the poet, Hillaire Belloc. They had land in Netherton, outside Dudley. This family became quite prosperous.\n\nHillaire Belloc\n\nMother: Bessie Parkes, whose father Joseph had been a Birmingham solicitor, but lived latterly in London. She married at the age of 38 about 1868 (thus born 1830). Her uncle was a Josiah Parkes who died between 1868 and 18/8/1872, HB's father's death, probably nearer 1869.\n\nRefer DNB for Josiah & Joseph Parkes.\n\nAnother family started with a lease of land at Totnall, leased from Lord Dudley and Ward. This holding appears for several generations.\n\n4. ********************* GENERATION 4 *********************\n\nCyril & Arthur Parkes were responsible for growing Josiah Parkes & Sons into a large international concern after their fathers death in 1920.\n\nJosiah Parkes Gower Street Offices about 1933, well remembered by Antony & Lindley Maitland.\n\nARTHUR JOSIAH PARKES\n\nAM04/03\n\nSee his own volume For his full story\n\nIssue of Arthur and Ethel (Lister) Parkes:\n\n1/1.

Williams Commercial & Mathematical Academy, Pipe Hall, Bilston. Two books of his \"penmanship\" from 1866 and 1868 have survived. The second finishes with a pencil drawing of a country dwelling dated Xmas 1868, and is well executed for a 13 year old. Maybe this is where his son, Arthur's painting skill came from[8].\n\nWE joined his father and brothers as a clerk in JP&S in 1870's, when Josiah set up a company with him as iron merchants and hardware factors and they moved into 28 Doctor's Piece. By 1880 business was doing well enough for Josiah to employ three men and expand the premises to 18, 29 & 30 Doctor's Piece, and Josiah Parkes, jnr and John Parkes both joined the firm, which changed its name to Josiah Parkes and Sons. William Edmund concentrated on the hardware section and Josiah looked after the iron merchanting[9].\n\nWilliam lived at Doctor's Piece in the 1880's, but was staying with the Fryer family in Birmingham in the day of the Census in 1881: this removed any doubt about the correct Fryer line! He then described himself as a hardware merchant.\n\nIn 1887 Josiah Parkes Snr retired and in January 1888 a new partnership under the same name was established between William Edmund, John and James Harry Parkes. Josiah Parkes Jnr carried on the iron merchanting business by himself, whilst the other brothers decided to concentrate on the manufacture of locks. William was Chairman from 1916 or earlier until his death in 1920[10].\n\nA photograph exits of William and his wife, Elizabeth, as a young couple in a formal pose. The photographers address was in Sunderland: perhaps the picture was taken on their honeymoon?\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth lived at Walsall Rd, Willenhall in 1890 when their younger son, AJ Parkes was born, and later (ref RJLP) the Manor Estate, Willenhall (inheriting his father's house, Fernside) and Paget Rd (WEP). He was a Justice of the Peace and on the newly formed Willenhall Urban District Council[11].\n\nWhen his father died in 1899, he was of Thompson St. By 1901, he and his brothers, Josiah and Harry, his mother and Samuel Lister lived in Bank Street, Willenhall.\n\nHe left the majority of his estate, after provision for Elizabeth, to his two sons, with the option of WCP gaining the controlling interest in the Company, which is what happened, something which annoyed the younger son, AJP, in later life[12].\n\nAn attempt was made by the trustees of his will to simplify the will and leave all equally between the sons. It appears to have failed.\n\nIn surviving photographs, he appears to be a humorous man, always with a nice smile on his face and neatly turned out, with a beard. Like most of his contemporary family, he seems to have been religious, probably Methodist, and maybe teetotal (on the slim evidence of staying at a temperance hotel in Liverpool in 1912!).\n\nELIZABETH FRYER\n\nAM05/06\n\nBC, MC, DC & Will held.\n\nBorn: 28/3/1853BC @ Lady Wood Grove, Edgbaston.\n\nParents: William, (Plumber & Glazier) & Caroline (Stait) Fryer.\n\nMarried: W.E. Parkes\n\nDied: 18/5/1927DC @ Draycott Cottage, Newbridge Rd, W'ton.\n\nElizabeth Fryer seems to have been born at her brother's house in Edgbaston. The family lived in Birmingham, but retained contact with her mother's family in Temple Grafton, Warwickshire, visiting in 1861. The presence of her fiancée in the 1881 census staying in her parental home confirms that this is the correct Elizabeth Fryer. It appears that her Fryer grandfather lived in Union Street, Willenhall, this being probably the connection (see William in the Fryer volume). We have a photograph album, put together by her for William Cyril, the annotations show her affection for her husband: there are a few pictures of her, in particular one of her as a pretty girl of about 11 years old. She only appears as an old lady in AJ Parkes' photograph album with his family on holidays in Wales. Her granddaughter, RJLP, had little memory of her.\n\nFrom photograph inscription, probably lived at Draycott Cottage, Newbridge Avenue, Sept 1922-May 1927.

This was the issue to be tried in the first instance. Josiah Parkes, one of the plaintiffs, was put in the witness box, and his evidence had not proceeded far when Mr. Plumptre called for the production of a memorandum of the letters of the 4th January last, which the plaintiffs had sent to the defendants on the subject of the sale of the property. Mr. Williams produced a memorandum of the date named, and said it was not in the terms mentioned by Mr. Plumptre. He added that he had inspected the plaintiffs press-copy letter book, and found that there was no copy there of the letter which his clients had received, but that there was a copy there of a letter which they had not received, and of which they knew nothing. His Honour said it would be a most ingenious and audacious fraud to send one letter and put another in the letter-book. Mr. Williams said he was not going to put it that way, but that the letter In the book had been inserted within a week, to fit the case to be presented that day, and he asked his Honour to look at the book, and see if the ink did not bear out that theory.Mr. Plumptre pointed out that the letter came in its proper place and order according to date, and that there were no signs of the book having been tampered with. Since the case had taken such an extraordinary and serious turn, he thought it ought to be heard before a jury. He promised that he would put his clients in the box and do his utmost to get at the truth of the affair, and he hoped his Honour would commit them for trial for perjury or forgery if there was any ground for the allegations on the other side. He also asked that the letter book, and a letter from Messrs. Hadley, might be impounded.His Honour ordered this to be done, and said he saw nothing suspicious in the colour of the ink.Eventually the case was adjourned.\n\n1883[24]: \"Josiah Parkes snr on Liberal assoc committee, Wolverhampton - WILLENHALL.\n\nTHE LIBERAL ASSOCIATION.The annual meeting of the Liberal Association was held at the Free Library Buildings, on Tuesday. Mr. N. N. Solly presided; and was supported by Messrs. Clement Tildesley, T. Kidson, J. Webb, J. Banks, R. Tildesley (hon, sec.), Geo: R. Thorne (hon. sec. of the Wolverhampton Liberal Association), and others.It was resolved that the representatives of the association for the ensuing year upon the Executive Committee of the Wolverhampton Association should be the following:Messrs. Geo; Baker, Josiah Parkes, sen., W. Trubshaw, J. Dagmore, H. Wolverson, Ed. Tonks, John Webb, Thos. Kidson, G. Reynolds, C. Tildesly, and J. M. Todd.The meeting next elected a General Committee to serve on the Wolverhampton Liberal Four Hundred. Of this Mr. Banka was appointed treasurer, Mr. R. Tildesley hon. secretary, and Mr. Dodd assistant secretary. Mr. Lampard, of Birmingham, then delivered on address eulogistic of the Ministry, entitled Topics of the Day. The following resolution, proposed by Mr. R. Tildesley, and seconded by Mr. Kidson, was passed : That this meeting expresses its continued confidence in her Majesty's Government, and pledges itself to support them in their efforts to carry into law the measures foreshadowed in the programme of the Liberal party.\n\n1885[25]: Last night Mr. Walter Bird, of London, the Conservative candidate for Wolverhampton East, addressed a crowded meeting of electors in the Public Hall, Willenhall. Mr. Josiah Tildesley (chairman of the divisional committee) presided : and he was supported by Messrs.... S. Parkes, Josiah Parkes, ... The Chairman said that it was the intention of Willenhall to return a business man as their representative.Mr. Bird, who on rising was received with cheering, said that the depression in trade had been aggravated and intensified by the late Government. If there was war prosperity could not be effected, as war meant practical ruin, The Royal Commission on Trade would, he believed, result in much good, Working men should be upon that Commission. He protested Against the action of Liberals who boycotted the scheme, and those Liberals called themselves the friends of the people. (They are.) He should be sorry if the two questions of free trade and fair trade should be alone Considered.

Wolfson College.\n\nAlan Parkes was one of the most influential figures in the field of reproductive biology in the twentieth century. He had a huge impact on its growth and development during that time, and the legacy of his work still remains. His research was highly innovative and original because of his imaginative and inquiring mind, which, coupled with an entrepreneurial bent, led him into several very different fields and into uncharted waters. He played a leading role in the spectacular rise of reproductive endocrinology in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s when the nature and activity of many of the reproductive processes in animals and humans and was an essential factor in the development of methods for their control. Even more pioneering was his research in low-temperature biology in the years after World War II. This was sparked off by the discovery that glycerol had a remarkable property of protecting spermatozoa against damage during freezing and storage at very low temperatures. Far-reaching applications arose from this discovery, especially in the preservation of bull semen, which led to a worldwide revolution in artificial insemination in cattle. Later, many other cells and tissues were also successfully frozen, including red blood cells, ovarian tissue and bone marrow, and a new branch of biological science, which became known as 'cryobiology', was born, Effects of deep hypothermia, including freezing, on whole animals were also investigated at that time. Having successfully launched a new area of science, it was characteristic of Alan Parkes to switch to new fields. First he became interested in the influence of pheromones on mammalian reproduction. Then, resuming a long-standing interest in comparative aspects of reproductive physiology in British wild mammals, he became involved in the work of the Nuffield Unit of Tropical Animal Ecology in Uganda, where similar studies were carried out on African animals. Even after retirement from the academic field, he was for some years a consultant to an enterprise in the conservation and captive breeding of green sea turtles in the Cayman Islands. In addition to his research, Alan Parkes was just as influential through the huge amount of work that he did for committees and other activities. Over the years he was on 35 different committees, study groups or advisory groups, and these were concerned with a wide variety of interests. He often served as chairman or secretary and had a great ability to take on a large amount of work and responsibility. He threw himself wholeheartedly into promoting the interests of reproductive biology and was a founding member of both the Society of Endocrinology and the Society for the Study of Fertility. He also played a leading role in the establishment and running of the Journal of Endocrinology and the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility. Getting these journals established often required a considerable amount of financial acumen. One of his special concerns was a long-standing interest in demographic and population issues, which led to his working closely with the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the Family Planning Association. He saw the 'population explosion' as a growing threat to the environment and to human welfare, and he was an outstanding proponent of measures to effect population control. Sometimes this led him into controversial areas. He spoke strongly in support of women's right to abortion and questioned the morality of expensive measures to overcome infertility. Throughout his life he was a prolific and lucid writer and his many publications remain a lasting monument to his contribution to science. He entitled the first volume of his autobiography Off-beat Biologist, which is perhaps a very apt description of this remarkable man.\n\nPMID: 18543475 [PubMed - in process]\n\nMarried Ruth Deanesley (born 1901, dau of Edward & Ida (Marston) Deansley), in 1933.\n\n3/1.

He married as his 2nd wife, Beatrice Turner, born 1800 of William Turner of Bilston.\n\n1796: Grocer & Chandler of Wolverhampton[34].\n\nJosiah Parkes was a schoolmaster when his first 2 sons by Beatrice Turner were born in 1823, resident in Upper Gornal, between Wolverhampton and Bilston, Staffordshire. His son Richard was born in Bobbington Heath in 1830, when Josiah was still a schoolteacher. The Bobbington Charity School is mentioned in the 1827 Enclosure Map. He became a dyer later and was living in Oxford St, Bilston by 1841. A tallow chandler at some time later in life (George marriage). His age of 62 in the 1841 Census is not reliable: the figure on his death certificate agrees with the birth given above.\n\nJosiah was a widower when he married Beatrice Turner in 1821, but no reliable information has been found about his earlier wife/wives. There were 2 children born to Josiah & Mary Parkes as non conformists in the early 19thC, Thomas Holt (Dudley, Old Meeting House, 25/5/1802PR), John Holt (W'ton Presbyterian, b 26/3/1803, ch 28/3/1803ACt). Based on the non-conformist connection, it seems likely that these were sons of our Josiah; the mother could have been a Mary Holt: there were a few Holt births in the Old Meeting House and the Dudley Quaker records. The Old Meeting House records only show a few marriages, so Josiahs first marriage might not have been recorded. There were several other marriages of Josiah, but they were more or less unlikely: geographically, the first, to Diana Thomson, in Halesowen is the most likely. The parish records throw no further light on this.\n\nA Jonathan Parkes, Dyer, was active in Oxford St, Bilston in 1845.\n\nA son by earlier marriage or a misspelling of Josiah.\n\nA Josiah Parkes and his brother John, were glove-makers in Worcester in 1821: unlikely to be the same ones.\n\nDETAILS OF JOSIAH PARKES (1778-1845):\n\n1796: Grocer & Chandler of Wolverhampton.\n\n1821 (marriage): West Bromwich.\n\n1822 (Josiah's ch.): Upper Gornal, a schoolmaster.\n\n1830 (Richard's ch.)

She is found in Oxford Street, Bilston, in 1851 & 61, married to Edward Whitehead, a grocer & fruiterer, who she married in 1848 when she was a dyer, carrying on from Josiah's business.\n\nHer third son being christened in Bobbington Heath (confirmed that this was the correct Parkes by Josiah being a schoolmaster in 1830 as he was in Upper Gornal 1823), and her death there point to her having family there. In 1841 and 1851, there were Turners living in the village. William and Sarah were 74 and 73 in 1851: they were her parents.

To resolve the problem, William and Josiah dissolved the partnership around 1873 and set up two separate businesses, Josiah Parkes and Sons and Parkes, Parkes and Co., but they both traded from the same address. Parkes, Parkes and Co. traded successfully for a while and then both Samuel and Josiah started other businesses.
