        "text": "The Chauncey M. Depew Papers are the later personal papers of Chauncey Mitchell Depew (1834-1928), United States Senator from New York and President and Chairman of the Board of the New York Central Railway System. Born in Peekskill, New York, on April 23, 1834, he was the son of Isaac and Martha Minot (Mitchell) Depew and connected through his mother with the New England families that produced Roger Sherman, Jonathan Edwards, Timothy Dwight, William Maxwell Evarts, the Hoars of Massachusetts, William Tecumseh Sherman, the Baldwins of New Haven, and John Sherman. He graduated from Yale College in 1856 and began a septuagenary career in law, politics, and railway affairs. He was distinguished as a politician, a businessman, an orator. In his later years, he became a popular after-dinner speaker, wit, and savant.\n\nThe papers consist mainly of correspondence and newspaper clippings. The great bulk of the correspondence falls in Depew's later years--the years when he was still active, but when his active career was largely over. The earliest letter is dated 1879, but the correspondence is sparse until the beginning of his first Senate term in 1899. From 1899, there is voluminous correspondence which reaches its peak during the 1920s.\n\nAlthough there is some correspondence dealing with the issues of the day, viz: the Panama Canal, the Canadian tariff controversy, the Interstate Commerce Commission, etc., the vast amount of the correspondence may be divided into two large categories--congratulatory and favor-seeking, the congratulatory correspondence consists of messages on his many birthdays, especially those in his late eighties and nineties; letters on the occasions of his election and re-election to the Senate; notes congratulating him on his volumes of speeches, reminiscences, and memoirs; and letters lauding his longevity, wit, and venerability. The favor-seeking correspondence is the usual type--people asking for work, for recommendations, for favorable words to the politically powerful and the patronage dispensers. There are also requests for commencement, postprandial, and other speeches; for his presence at various functions; for his support in business enterprises, etc.\n\nOn the public side, the correspondence is not so much active as reflective, not so much contemporaneous as anecdotal. Facts about Lincoln, Johnson, Arthur, Benjamin Harrison, and other figures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are present, but they are retrospective. Nothing emerges for these times during the time; such information is to be gained in this collection through Depew's reminiscences. On this plane, the collection is a rich one, for Depew, whose penchant for anecdotes was famous, made a practice of collecting stories, amusing or otherwise, about the great and near-great. The collection, even for the years when he was advanced in age, is replete with such material.\n\nThe correspondence is in chronological order, but the letters have been catalogued individually in the department's manuscript catalog, and there is a list of select correspondents following the folder listing."
