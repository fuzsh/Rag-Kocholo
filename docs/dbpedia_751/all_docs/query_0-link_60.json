        "text": "Transcription of obituary published in the Primitive Methodist Magazine\n\nIt is with sincere regret that we record the death of Edward MacFarlane, the only and beloved child of the Rev. Robt. H. and Mrs. MacFarlane. Born at Glenhouse, Greenock, at the residence of Alexander Murray Dunlop, M.P.—a relation on his father’s side—on May 5th, 1897, he finished his earthly pilgrimage at Bollington on March 1st, 1916, in his nineteenth year.\n\nHe received his education at Preston, and at the Macclesfield Grammar School. He was a born musician, and recently gained a certificate of the London College of Music. He had also gained a scholarship for painting and was connected with the Practical Correspondence College, London.\n\nDuring his illness he composed several poems and hymns. He was at home in Church life. He was organist at C.E., Sunday School and Band of Hope. His name appears among the local preachers on the Bollington plan, and many thought that God was calling him into the ministry of our Church, but it was not to be.\n\nFamily\n\nEdward was born on 5 May 1897 at Greenock, Renfrewshire, to parents Robert Henry Macfarlane, a PM minister, and Mary Tunstall.\n\nEdward died on 1 March 1916 at Bollington, Cheshire.\n\nPrimitive Methodist Magazine 1916/859\n\nCensus Returns and Births, Marriages & Deaths Registers"
