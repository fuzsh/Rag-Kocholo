        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History of Yehuda\n\nYehuda is a traditional masculine name with Hebrew roots. It is the modern Hebrew form of the Biblical Hebrew name Yehudah, which is the Hebrew form of the Biblical name Judah. Historians believe Judah originated from Yehudah, derived from the Hebrew word yadah, which means ‘praise’ or ‘thanksgiving.’\n\nThe name Judah appears in the Old Testament twice. First as the name of one of the twelve sons of Jacob and another as the ancestor of the Judah Tribe. In the New Testament, Judah makes an appearance with the spellings Jude and Judas. It is this biblical touch that makes it an appealing choice for parents of Christian faith.\n\nHistorically, a notable bearer of the name is Yehuda Alharizi who was also known by the name Judah ben Solomon Harizi. He was a mid-12th-century poet and rabbi who traveled extensively in Al-Andalus and translated many works from Arabic to Hebrew. Other personalities who have brought prominence to the name include Yehuda Amital, the dean of Yeshivat Har Etzion and former Israeli cabinet member, Yehudi Menuhin, an American-born British world-famous violinist, and Yehuda Kurtzer, the President of The Shalom Hartman Institute of North America.\n\nThe three-syllable name is commonly pronounced as yeh-HOO-dah. Ioudas in Biblical Greek, Iudas in Biblical Greek, and Yidel and Yudel in Yiddish are charming variants of the name. If you are looking for playful nicknames, Yuda, Huda, Yehu, Judah, and Yudi are options worth checking out.\n\nFor those seeking a fashionable baby name, consider exploring Yehuda, which has secured a position among the Top 900 names for newborns in 2021.
