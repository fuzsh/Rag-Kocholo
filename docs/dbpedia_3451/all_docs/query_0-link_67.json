        "text": "The inspiration for this post came from the Piamenta concert that we enjoyed this past Saturday night (see photos here) , not to mention the CD that we bought there.\n\nClick here to read the words of Psalm 121, Shir Lamaalot, Esa Einai el Heharim.\n\nClick on “I Lift My Eyes” here for a version in a style that I can’t quite describe (which is pretty typical of Aron Razel’s music :) ). I'd call it a somewhat unconventional folk version.\n\nClick on “Shir Lamaalos Esa” here for a straight-up folk version by Yosef Karduner.\n\nClick on number 10 here for a bluesy 50s-style slow-dance version by Yosi Piamenta (vocals by lead singer Naftali Kaffa, Shmuel Levi, and Avi Piamenta, who also plays flute on this song).\n\nIt’s amazing—and delightful—that three different musicians can write totally different music to the same words.\n\nYou might want to consider buying these albums so that you can enjoy these songs in their entirety, along with the other songs on each album. “Hashivenu” is one of my favorites on Yosef Karduner’s “Road Marks” CD (probably because I hear it in my head when I davven/pray the Amidah prayer); the wonderful country-western “Adon Olam” is one of my favorites on the Piamenta band’s “Yih’yu L’ratzon” CD, and I love everything on Aron Razel’s “Live in Jersusalem” CD.\n\nHere’s the original post “Shabbos Elevator Pitch,” by Rabbi Gil Student of Hirhurim. The following is an excerpt thereof:\n\n“In R. Yaakov horowitz's latest column (link), he quotes a woman who describes the beauty of Shabbos in that it is 1) a time to be with family, 2) a time to unwind and 3) grow closer to God. I believe that only two of these three reasons have support from medieval authorities.\n\nR. Sa'adia Ga'on (Emunos Ve-Dei'os 3:2) lists the following logical reasons for Shabbos and holidays, which he believes is generally about obedience to God but has secondary reasons as well:\n\n1. to rest from work\n\n2. to spend time acquiring wisdom\n\n3. for extended prayer\n\n4. to meet with others to study religion\n\nI find it noteworthy that he did not include in his list anything about family gatherings and spending time together.\n\n. . . .\n\n. . . a further question is whether we have the right to offer a reason that earlier authorities omitted.”\n\nAt last sighting, there were 72 comments to this post.\n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nHere’s a quote from DovBear’s post in response (42 comments, last I looked):\n\n\"And finally the kicker: \"Be that as it may, I prefer to stick to the reasons for the mitzvos found in the sources.\" Does this mean Gil will no longer allow himself to enjoy his family on shabbos? That he'll feel guilty about doing so because its not one of the benefits Saadya Gaon listed 1000 years ago?\n\nIs this post for real??\"\n\nHere’s a peek at Ezzie’s post in response (13 comments, thus far):\n\n“For many, rest from work is spending time with one's family. It is this family time which allows them to truly relax and enjoy the Shabbos. Moreover, as shown from R' Horowitz's piece, it is this family time which nowadays seems to have one of the strongest effects on people's strengthening of religion.”\n\nAnd finally (?—there may be other posts that I missed), MOChassid chimes in (7 comments at the moment):\n\n\"Talk about missing the forest for the trees.\n\nHonestly, I can't even fathom the point Gil is trying to make. To even raise it in the context of Rabbi Horowitz's article suggests a tin-ear of Biblical proportions.\n\nRabbi Horowitz's whole point is that in order to battle \"Walmart\" (Rabbi Horowitz's mashal for the internet) we need to make Shabbos warmer, more peaceful and more attractive to our children. With all due respect, having these kinds of intellectual discussions about reasons for Shabbos is the LAST thing we should be doing.\n\nMy advice? Let's gather 'round our table on Friday night and sing a few niggunim. You don't even have to bang the table.\"\n\nAmen to that! Less theory, more practice!\n\nLong-time readers with good memories will remember that I've discussed this before. Well, I'm discussing it again--but from a more realistic angle, unfortunately. Too many people have died in the interim.\n\nThere's an old tale told about a feuding couple that comes to see a rabbi. (This was in the days before mental-health professionals.) First, the husband tells his side of the story, and the rabbi says, \"You're right.\" Then, the wife tells her side of the story, and the rabbi says, \"You're right.\" The rebbitzen (rabbi's wife), who's been eavesdropping, calls her husband aside. \"They can't both be right,\" she says. The rabbi replies, \"You're right, too.\"\n\nThat's the way I feel about the West Bank.\n\nOn the one hand, here's what New York Jewish Week editor/publisher Gary Rosenblatt has to say about the West Bank: \"We were among the last to recognize that the growing population of Jews in the West Bank and Gaza was making the separation of Jews and Arabs more difficult and hastening the day when an Arab majority in the State of Israel could end Jewish sovereignty, not on the battlefield but through the ballot box.\"\n\nOn the other hand, see these photos of Tel Aviv taken from Peduel. (Keep scrolling--the pictures are nearly at the botton of the page.) As Elder of Ziyon says, \"Tel Aviv is a whopping 10 miles away from Peduel - easily within rocket range.\"\n\nOnce upon a time, before the Summer 2006 War, I was naive enough to believe that the size of the State of Israel didn't matter. After all, if Israel's enemies could target Tel Aviv all the way from Teheran, what difference did it make how much land was contained within Israel's borders?\n\nS'derot put the lie to that. You don't need a nuke to wreak havoc. All you need is a homemade rocket launcher close enough to the nearest Israeli town to kill a few kindergarteners in cold blood.\n\nOnce upon a time, before the Summer 2006 War, I was naive enough to believe that the hitnatkut, the withdrawal from Gush Katif and the Northern Shomron/Samaria, was tragic, but necessary for peace.\n\nI might have been at least partially right, had the Israeli government upheld its commitment to target the Gaza terrorists once the settlers were out of harm's way. But alas, 'twas not to be. So I was wrong on both counts: Not only is the Israeli government failing to take adequate measures to protect its own citizens, but, to boot, the withdrawal do not improve Israel's prospects of achieving peace with the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael withdrew first from the \"safety zone\" in southern Lebanon, then from Aza/Gaza, and the only thing it got in return was the dubious privilege of being shelled from those same locations. The only thing that territorial concessions seem to bring is a demand for more territorial concessions. Israel's enemies see compromise for the sake of peace as a sign of weakness, and target Israel accordingly. (See Daniel Gordis's January 2, 2008 article, \"Back to the Mishnah.\")\n\nStill, what about the demographic problem? Is it possible to keep Israel Jewish with so many Arabs within its borders?\n\nI'm e-mailing a link to this post to West Bank Mama as soon as I publish it--I think that, as a resident of Peduel, she should be among the first to see it.\n\nUpdate, from West Bank Mama:\n\nShira - please tell your readers who click on the Elder of Zion link, that although the picture was taken with a telephoto lens, the entire coastline, from Hadera down to south of Tel-Aviv is visible from Peduel with the naked eye.Anyone living on the coast should be grateful that I live in this yishuv - and not a terrorist with a rocket launcher.\n\nwestbankmama\n\nBoker Tov, Boulder wants to know, \"Where has all the money gone?\" (Hat-tip: This edition of Haveil Havalim, hosted by Soccer Dad.)\n\nAlmost 60 years have passed since the founding of the State of Israel. In that time, Israel has settled thousands of refugees from Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen, from the former Soviet Union, and from Ethiopia.\n\nYet, a third generation of Palestinian refugees is still living in camps. Why? Why have they not been resettled in Arab and/or Muslim countries? Why do the Palestinian so-called-refugee camps still exist? Do the Arab and/or Muslim nations of the Middle East consider these people humans, or are they mere pawns in a propaganda--and real--war, hostages of their own brethren, imprisoned and brainwashed to be used as cannon fodder?\n\nIt's high time that the Arab and/or Muslim nations of the Middle East, the United Nations, and the world at large gave the Palestinian \"refugees\" the opportunity to lead normal lives. (Hat-tip: This post by West Bank Mama). These people should be re-settled among their own, and the Palestinian so-called-refugee camps should be closed, once and for all!"
