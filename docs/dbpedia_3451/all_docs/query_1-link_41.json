        "text": "Yeshiva Celebrates Birthday of Beloved Maggid Shiur\n\nThis Friday, 14th of Cheshvan, marks the birthday of the highly esteemed, well respected and beloved maggid shiur in Yshivas Oholei Torah Zal of Crown Heights Brooklyn, Reb Avrohom Gerlitzky. There has been a tradition for many years that on his birthday, his talmidim make it a special day, a highlight in the Oholei Torah calendar. This year was no exception.\n\nClick Here for Photos.\n\nCrown Heights residents woke up Thursday morning to find signs on cars, poles and even some shops wishing Reb Avrohom a Happy Birthday.\n\nIn the afternoon Reb Avrohom walked into the decorated classroom to the sound of a loud happy birthday sung by his talmidim. This year, the talmidim decided, that to celebrate his tireless devotion to teaching in Oholei Torah for more than 30 years, they would throw him a party of which the likes were never seen before in the walls of the Yeshiva.\n\nFollowing the wonderful farbrengen, the talmidim ushered Rabbi Gerlitzky into the next room, where an entertaining acrobatic show was put on by the French twins.\n\nIn the past the talmidim have pooled together and got Reb Avrohom a gift. One year it was a chair, another it was the entire Otzar Hachochma; this year they got him a brand new desk for Zal with a plaque dedicating it to him.\n\nKristallnacht - 73 Years Ago\n\n\"Kristallnacht\" the pogrom against Jews throughout Nazi Germany and parts of Austria on November 9–10, 1938. Jewish homes were ransacked, as were shops, towns and villages, as SA stormtroopers and civilians destroyed buildings with sledgehammers. Around 1,668 Shuls were ransacked, and 267 set on fire. In Vienna alone 95 Shuls or Yeshivos were destroyed.\n\nArnold Goldschmidt was born in Fulda, Germany, in 1922. Arrested during Kristallnacht, he was deported to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was subjected to a brutal regime of forced labor and beatings. Arnold was eventually released and returned to his hometown of Fulda. He was later sent on a children's transport to Holland, where he lived in different children's homes. Immigrating to the United States, he later enlisted in the US Army. Arnold Goldschmidt immigrated to Israel in 1966.\n\nThis archival footage, depicting the events of Kristallnacht in Buehl, was discovered a few years ago in the attic of one of the residents in Buehl. The footage was taken by a firefighter who shot films for a hobby. He took the footage in order to capture his friends during their work. The firefighters were prepared to put out the flames to ensure that the fire would not spread to the neighboring homes next to the synagogue.\n\nMembers of the SS or SA appear in the film, apparently having come from a different town. This signifies that the riots did not break out spontaneously, as the Germans claimed, but were organized by the authorities, which sent people from other areas to oversee the events.\n\nAmong all the films that document the destruction of synagogues on Kristallnacht, the footage from Buehl is one of the few films not produced by the Propaganda Ministry of the Nazi regime.\n\nBuehl is a town in the state of Baden, Germany. In 1933 there were approximately 70 Jews in Buehl, who made up about 1% of the town's population. Persecution against the Jews began immediately after the Nazi rise to power. The town's residents gradually broke off all social and economic contacts with the Jews. In 1935 the Torah scrolls in the town were desecrated, and the Jews were gradually forced to liquidate their businesses.\n\nOn Kristallnacht, November 9-10, 1938, the town's synagogue went up in flames and Jewish stores were vandalized. By 1940 21 Jews had emigrated from the town and 13 others left for different cities in Germany. On October 22, 1940, 28 Jews were deported from Buehl to Gurs Concentration Camp in southwestern France, bringing an end to the Jewish community in Buehl. The majority of Buehl's deported Jews perished in the Holocaust, either in Gurs or after their deportation to the camps and ghettos in Eastern Europe.\n\nIgnorant Anti Semitic OWS Protester with Lubavitcher\n\nA video of an Occupy Wall Street protester arguing yesterday in New York City with a Lubavither young man, has surfaced.\n\nI don't think i can even call this guy \"dumb!\" That would give him too much credit. \"Total brainless dumbbell\" is more like it.\n\nJewish man: I work 65 hours a week.\n\nProtester: You probably live in the Hamptons ‘n’ some ****.\n\nJewish man: I live in the Hamptons? I live in Brooklyn. I work 62 hours a week. I pay $1400 a month rent. Do you work 62 hours?\n\nProtester: You know what’s funny? Your people own schools and *****n government buildings, but your wives are on welfare. I don’t understand that. I don’t understand that. I met a public assistance officer. And they were Jewish, but their husbands own *****n’ everything.\n\nThe protester then goes on to explain why he doesn't need to have a job. In his mind, everything is free.\n\nThis video has been edited as the original video was deemed inappropriate."
