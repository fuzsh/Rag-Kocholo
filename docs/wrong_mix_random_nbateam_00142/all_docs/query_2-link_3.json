        "text": "> Career Stats\n\nFew players have ever reached the NBA pinnacle as often as Derek Fisher.\n\nThe steady guard out of the University of Arkansas Little Rock spent the first eight seasons of his career in Los Angeles, where he played a vital role as the Kobe Bryant/Shaquille O’Neal-led Lakers completed a three-peat from 2000-02.\n\nDuring his first of two stints with Los Angeles, Fisher averaged 7.4 points, 3.0 assists and 1.0 steals in 23.7 minutes. Many fans will always remember Fisher for his clutch game-winner against San Antonio during Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference semifinals.\n\nAfter three seasons between Golden State and Utah, Fisher returned to Kobe and the Lakers for the 2007-08 season. Now with Pau Gasol manning the paint, L.A. returned to The Finals in 2008 before being eliminated by Boston in six games. That wasn’t enough to slow Fisher and the Lakers, though, as they returned with vengeance in ‘09 and ‘10 to win back-to-back championships.\n\nFisher stayed with Los Angeles until 2011, finishing his career with seasons in Oklahoma City and Dallas. The five-time champ retired in 2014 as the all-time leader in NBA playoff games played with 259.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014, Fisher was hired by his former coach, Phil Jackson, to become coach of the New York Knicks. Fisher posted a record of 40-96 in 136 games with New York before parting ways midseason. He joined the Turner family during 2016.\n\n* * *"
