        "text": "Phil Jackson says Derek Fisher will bring his “underdog” persona to the Knicks and instill that mentality into the players — something he likes best about his new coaching hire.\n\nIn an MSG Network special on the Jackson-Fisher dynamic set to air Friday night at 8 p.m., the Zen Master discusses his former Lakers pupil’s basketball background.\n\n“Fish’s career lasting until he’s almost 40 years of age is a remarkable feat,” Jackson said. “He talked about the fact that he never was the quickest, never could jump the highest, never was the tallest. He always was kind of in an underdog role, but he was so well prepared. He spent the offseason working on what he had to do, and he’s going to bring that mentality to our players.\n\n“And this is really important for this group particularly here with the Knicks. They have to embrace the fact that this profession requires a total dedication, it’s a total thing, and to do that it’s an immersion. It’s not just a basketball and basketball skills, it’s an immersion. And that immersion comes into the form of: How do we get to think as one and how do we get to act as one?”\n\nIn the interview, Jackson also delves deeper into Fisher’s state of mind.\n\n“I love Fish for the fact that he’s in the moment, as you can see,” Jackson said. “He was talking about being in the moment, not trying to out-think yourself or out plan yourself, but letting the spirit move you, and that’s where Fish really stands high in my regard. So that’s one of the reasons why I think he is going to be terrific at this because he’s not going to be out-thinking himself. He’s going to let what happens at that moment impact how he reacts to it, and I think that flexibility is terrific in a coach.”\n\nFisher was asked what he’ll say to the Knicks the first time they meet.\n\n“I want to make a good first impression, make sure the guys understand that you’re ready to handle this job and you really can be a great head coach and you’re looking forward to working with them,” Fisher said. “But maybe you’re over-prepared or you’re trying too hard and you’re not just being you. So I think even before assembling as a group and the first time I talk to all of them in the same room at the same time, it’s going to be extremely important to have started to forge relationships and communication prior to that moment. So that when we all show up here for training camp, we’ve already started to build a foundation for who we want to be and what we want to accomplish.”"
