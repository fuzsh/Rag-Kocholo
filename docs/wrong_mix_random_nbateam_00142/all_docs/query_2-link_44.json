        "text": "The allegations, according to NBPA vice president Maurice Evans in an interview with the Washington Times, range from misappropriation of funds to the way union decisions were handled during the lockout to Hunter being guilty of nepotism. While Hunter’s backers are quick to point out that nepotism exists throughout the NBA, his critics see it as excessive in his case. His daughter, Robyn, and daughter-in-law, Megan Inaba, are on the NBPA’s staff, while his son, Todd, of Prim Capital Corp in Cleveland, has been retained to run the NBPA’s Players Financial Awareness Program and his daughter, Alexis, was used as outside counsel during the lockout. And while Fisher and Hunter had a falling out during the lockout that almost stayed quiet until the end, Fisher insists this isn’t about them. Fisher has two more seasons left on his term as president, while Hunter — a former U.S. Counsel who started at the union in 1996 and reportedly earns $2.4 million annually — has a contract that runs through 2016.\n\nYet no one was as candid as Thunder center Kendrick Perkins, who made his feelings known that Fisher has the players’ best interests at heart. “My opinion is this: D-Fish’s job is to protect the players, and that’s what he’s doing,” Perkins said. “He just did something that they hadn’t seen before. Everybody is watching everybody else, but who’s looking out and making sure they’re doing their jobs. “He did what he’s supposed to do — protect the players. And if you’ve got nothing to hide, you shouldn’t want to push him out if he’s just doing his job. Whatever you’re hiding in the dark, it’s going to come to light.”\n\nRonny Turiaf has a unique ability to give back while looking forward. The Miami Heat recently concluded a grueling eight-game, 11-day stretch and the players finally had a day off earlier this week. Turiaf spent part of it talking about his latest project, joining teammate Dwyane Wade, NBA players Jeremy Lin and Chris Paul and others to help promote and raise funds for Prevent Child Abuse America’s 40th anniversary. “I want to be remembered for more than basketball,” said Turiaf, who started his Heart to Heart Foundation in 2009 to provide medical care and health services to children in need. “I just feel like everyone can play a role in a healthy child’s development and I’m happy to use basketball as a platform to help others.”\n\nMiami Heat player rep James Jones called it a “distraction’’ and didn’t want to offer an opinion on whether union president Derek Fisher should be removed. “It’s a distraction, and it’s something that should be handled internally,’’ Jones said. “Unfortunately, it’s out in public. So as much as possible you just try to shift the focus on this great product of the NBA that’s coming to a close (in the regular season).’’\n\nWith the association’s executive committee seeking to oust Fisher in his role as president, Lakers guards Kobe Bryant and Steve Blake both voiced support for their former teammate and his goals of hiring a law firm to conduct an independent audit to examine the union’s business practices. “What’s wrong with doing an audit?” Bryant asked. “I’m very curious about that. Extremely. We all should be.”"
