        "text": "I just want to thank all my friends and family out there who believed that one day, I would be worthy of a friendship with someone like Megan Fox (yes, I really did get this!) While it's funny to me, there are real dangers with these fake profiles: üé≠#Scammers often create fake profiles to con people. More than one in four people who reported losing money to fraud in 2021 said it started on #socialmedia with an ad, a post, or a message. More than 95,000 people reported about $770 million in losses to fraud initiated on social media platforms in 2021. üóû #Misinformation and Fake News: Fake profiles can be used to spread misinformation and fake news, which can have serious consequences. ‚ù§Ô∏è Romance Scams: More than a third of people who said they lost money to an online romance scam in 2021 said it began on #Facebook or #Instagram. These scams often start with a seemingly innocent friend request from a stranger, followed by sweet talk, and then, inevitably, a request for money. The sad part is that this fake profile already snagged a few friends. What can you do? üëìVerify Profile Authenticity: Check the profile's legitimacy by reviewing its history, the number of friends or followers, the type and quality of content posted, and the general engagement it receives. Be wary of newly created profiles or those with minimal activity, which can be #redflags. üìõLook for Verification Badges: On platforms like Facebook, and Instagram, legitimate public figures, brands, and organizations often have verified accounts. Trust accounts only when you see this verification, especially when dealing with customer service issues or promotions. ü§î Be #Skeptical of Unsolicited Requests: If you receive friend requests, messages, or follows from unknown profiles that seem out of context, proceed with caution. Scammers often send unsolicited requests to widen their scamming network. ‚Ñπ Guard Your Personal Information: Never share personal, financial, or security-related information, such as your Social Security number, bank account details, or passwords. Legitimate organizations will not ask for sensitive information through social media. üö®Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a suspicious profile or message, report it to the social media platform. Most platforms have mechanisms in place to handle reports of #fraudulent activity, helping to prevent further harm to others. üìñEducate Yourself About Current Scams: Stay informed about the latest scam #tactics. Scammers constantly evolve their methods, and knowing what to look out for can provide crucial protection. Besides, Megan Fox must be really down on her luck to be reaching out to me!\n\nWhat do you do when #ransomware is not the goal.... Recent analyses by SentinelLabs and Recorded Future reveal an alarming trend where Chinese-linked cyberespionage campaigns are now deploying ransomware as a tactic to obfuscate their operations. Traditionally avoided by state-backed groups, ransomware is being used to mask espionage activities under the guise of financial cybercrime, complicating attribution efforts and potentially misdirecting the focus of cybersecurity responses. In high-profile instances, such as the 2022 cyberattacks on Brazil's presidency and India's All India Institute of Medical Sciences, what initially seemed like ransomware attacks were linked to a Chinese cyberespionage group, ChamelGang or CamoFei. This strategic use of ransomware allows these groups to destroy evidence and maintain plausible deniability, thus blurring the lines between state-sponsored actions and cybercriminal activities. This approach not only complicates the cybersecurity landscape but also raises significant concerns about the true intent and extent of such attacks on global infrastructure. Does this really change the #threatmodel of a given system? Understanding the layered motives in these attacks might alter the defenses slightly, but to be honest, not many organizations (if any) are immune to a ransomware attack and we all need to be prepared, regardless of the motive of the attacker. Still....perhaps an interesting twist in the TTPs of some APTs. #Cybersecurity #Ransomware #Cyberespionage #InfoSec\n\nI've seen this story making the rounds, but TBH, pointing out that a major airline is running 30+ year old software as the \"backbone\" of their operations just flies in the face of what we know in cybersecurity. Granted, the truth may be somewhere in between when it comes to how they were able to avoid the Crowdstrike outage, but suffice to say they were able to continue to operate while other airlines were not. That says a lot about how deep their dependence goes. To be clear, running outdated software in critical systems poses significant risks, including security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, compatibility problems, lack of support, increased maintenance costs, and potential reputation damage. Outdated software often contains well-documented vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or operational disruption. Compatibility issues can hinder operations and reducing system efficiency. Ultimately, security breaches or compliance failures due to outdated software can severely damage an organization‚Äôs reputation, leading to lost business and diminished customer trust. While, again, the truth of SW's operational wizardry may be kept quiet for awhile, running outdated software on critical systems really isn't that funny."
