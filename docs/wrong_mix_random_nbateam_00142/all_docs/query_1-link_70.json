When he was almost a year old, his mother carried him a block down the street to visit her friend who had that day given birth to Edith Clark. Rex met her the day she was born, and would marry her 19 years later in 1944. They were married for 68 years. At the end of World War II, he served in the Army Air Corps as a radio operator on a B-29. He worked for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for over 20 years and as a police chief for Amtrak in Los Angeles, CA for five, before retiring in 1982 to Blackfoot.\n\nHe was an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Malcom's Brower-Wann Funeral Home of Lewiston is in charge of arrangements.\n\nOrin Leroy 'Lee' Squire, 75, Orofino\n\nOrin Leroy 'Lee' Squire was born in Billings, MT on Oct. 24, 1937, to Georgia Maxine Squire, and as a young child, he was adopted by Jack E. Squire, who was his \"dad\".\n\nLee passed away Sunday, Dec. 23, 2012 in Orofino.\n\nLee grew up in Euclid, OH, where he graduated from Euclid High School, and then joined the United States Marine Corps. After completing his term with the Marines, Lee then joined the US Navy, from which he retired after 22 years, as a Chief Warrant Officer 4.\n\nLee met Phyllis Coon in a high school math class, and in 1958 they were married. Together they had three beautiful daughters. Lee and Phyllis were a powerful force working together through the years, in their family and their many contributions to their community, no matter where the military or life sent them. They maintained decades-long relationships with many people, who remained dear to them throughout their lives together.\n\nWhile he was in the military, Lee pursued a college education between deployments, and in 1980, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Old Dominion University in Virginia. This degree opened the path to achieve his lifetime goal to be an attorney. After retirement from the Navy, Lee was off to law school and his next career.\n\nUtilizing one last move provided by the military, Lee, Phyllis, and their youngest daughter, Jackye, moved to Moscow where he was accepted to the University of Idaho College of Law. He and Jackye attended college together for two years, a truly rare and unique opportunity for a father and daughter.\n\nAfter obtaining his Juris Doctorate degree in 1985, Lee was given the opportunity to share office space with attorneys John Swayne and Steve Calhoun in Orofino where he and Phyllis put down deep roots. Lee was an active member of the local Kiwanis Club, as well as the Marine Corps League and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\nOver the course of his legal career, Lee was the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of Clearwater County, and served as the City Attorney for Orofino, Pierce, Weippe, and Kamiah. In 1999, he was selected to be the Magistrate for Clearwater County in the Second Judicial District of Idaho. This appointment was a great honor to him, and he took being a Judge very seriously.\n\nIn 2004, Lee retired due to the declining health of his beloved Phyllis. He cared for her through the years of her illness, until her death, after 50 years of marriage, in July, 2008. Lee was devastated by her death, but he knew they would be together again one day.\n\nIn 2010, Lee began corresponding with Shirley Van Kirk, with whom he had attended the same high school, she being a year behind him. After a brief courtship, they were married in July, 2012. While their time together was short, their love for one another was obvious and genuine.\n\nLee is survived by his loving wife, Shirley; and his three daughters, Laura Meier and her sons, Charles and Zachary; Tammy Gerberding, her husband Bob, and their children Daniel and Andrea; and Jackye Squire. He is also survived by Shirley's children, Richard Van Kirk, his wife Mary, and their children Jared, Sarah and Madelyn; Joaline Garvey, her husband Shad, and their children Courtney and Ashlyn; and Laurena Karrle, her husband Ben, and daughter, Shayna; and by Shirley's sisters, Donna Carron and Nanette Meyer, and her husband Bob. Lee was predeceased by his parents, and his brother, James Squire. Lee also leaves behind many, many long-time and much-beloved friends.\n\nServices will be held at the Best Western Lodge at Rivers Edge in Orofino on Saturday, Jan. 5, 2013, at 3 p.m. The family requests that, if possible, attendees whose calling has required the wearing of a uniform, active duty or retired, to please wear your uniform to the service.

'Dick' Moore, age 79, passed away December 19, 2012 of congestive heart failure at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, Lewiston.\n\nRichard (Dick) L. Moore was born April 11, 1933, in Iowa City, Iowa to Edward Louis and Dorothy Agnes Moore. He graduated from Iowa City High School in 1951, and entered the Air Force in 1953. He was accepted into the Aviation Cadet program and by 1954 had trained as a navigator, radar operator and bombardier, and received his commission as a second lieutenant. He and Mary Jo Reid were married on Oct. 2, 1954, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Galveston, TX. Their first station was Mountain Home AFB where they spent three different tours from 1954-1965. Dick rose steadily in training skills and rank, going from a navigator in the KC-97 to becoming a navigator in jets, (the B-47) then on to pilot training. He earned his pilot's wings in 1958, and became a co-pilot in the B-47. In 1965, while on alert in Alaska, he was asked if he would like an assignment to Vietnam as a pilot of the T-39, and he promptly accepted.\n\nDuring his year in Vietnam he was promoted to Major, and flew missions daily, carrying military commanders, visiting dignitaries, and reconnaissance films. Decorations awarded during his tour in Vietnam include the Bronze Star and first through third oak leaf clusters to the Air Medal. In 1967 Dick was given the assignment of becoming an instructor pilot in the T-37 at Reese AFB, in Lubbock, TX, where he would remain until his tour of 20 years ended He retired from the Air Force as a Lt. Colonel at the age of 39, and immediately returned to college, where he earned two degrees at Texas Tech University in Range and Wildlife Management. Upon receiving his Master's, he was called by the Corps of Engineers to report to the Dworshak Reservoir Project in Orofino where he would be in charge of elk mitigation.\n\nDick spent almost 18 years on the elk project, from 1981 to 1998, and witnessed the growth of the elk herd from 237 head in 1982, to a population of over 1,700 by 1995. He retired from the Corps following his 65th birthday, on May 1, 1998.\n\nIn 1999, his wife, Jo, retired from teaching and the two embarked on a retirement \"hobby\" which continues to this day, building and becoming innkeepers of the High Country Inn on the Old Ahsahka Grade.\n\nDuring the years Dick spent in Orofino, he continued his life's interests, one being a Boy Scout leader of Troop 566, where son Edward attained the rank of Eagle Scout (the other two sons, Richard and Scott had become Eagles in Lubbock.) Until recently, Dick served as a member of the Board of Review for potential Eagle Scouts in Orofino. Other long-time interests were membership in the Knights of Columbus, also the patriotic 4th Degree of the Knights. He was a life-long communicant of the Catholic Church, and was active in parish work.\n\nDuring the thirty-plus years that Dick and Jo have lived on the \"hill\" outside of Ahsahka, he enjoyed being \"captain\" on their pontoon boat on the reservoir, kokanee fishing, and a true accomplishment was the building of their earth shelter home, which took 10 years to complete, from 1982 -1992.. Most recently he especially enjoyed playing with and reading to great granddaughter, Jasey Rae. Whenever the inn had guests, he liked serving as bartender and meat carver. Dick will be sorely missed as a loving husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 58 years, Jo at the family home; and 5 children, their spouses, 17 grandchildren: Jude and Jack Vosika of Jackson Hole, WY (Josh, Zach, and Jacob,) Richard and Cathy Moore of Ahsahka (Justin, Nathan, Elizabeth, Jessica and Hank Peterson, Melissa, and Josh,) Sharon and Joe Cardona of Boise (Teresa and Michael Wilchester, Karin, Kristina, and Joseph,) Scott and Anne Moore of Dublin, OH (Alex and Patrick,) Edward and Traci Moore of Boise (Olivia and Dominic,) and three great grandchildren.\n\nCelebration of Dick's life will be held Saturday, Dec. 29, at 10:30 a.m., St. Theresa's Catholic Church, followed by a luncheon in the Little Flower Room.\n\nCremation has taken place and a memorial service will be held later at the Idaho Veterans Cemetery in Boise.\n\nMemorials may be given to St. Gertrude's Monastery, 465 Keuterville Rd., Cottonwood, ID 83522; Clearwater Valley Hospital (CVHC) Foundation, P.O.

He was the youngest of four children.\n\nHe spent his early years on Gilbert Ridge and attended Gilbert School. The family then moved to Peck where he lived until moving to Pierce in 1965.\n\nLouie enlisted in the military during World War II. He made it through basic training and was headed to his first posting when it was discovered that he had one glass eye (lost in a hunting accident at age 14). When asked how he passed the eye exam during his physical, he said, \"I memorized the eye chart.\" He was a true member of \"The Greatest Generation\".\n\nAfter returning home, he worked for numerous logging companies as a bucker. He also kept up the family home in Peck and cared for his mother.\n\nLouie was seriously injured in a logging accident which resulted in a knee replacement and early retirement.\n\nAfter retirement, he liked to sit on one of the many benches on Main St. and visit with whoever was passing by. He had several nicknames, but his favorite was probably 'Sidewalk Louie'. In his later years, Louie drew a moose tag (first time applying for it) and got one. After he was well into his 80s, he was doing \"parts\" run for some of the loggers and on his 90th birthday, Louie was given the \"key\" to the town of Pierce.\n\nOver the last years he had suffered several serious accidents and had his knee replaced again.

'Jean' Johnston, 70, formerly of Cardiff Spur\n\nJean passed from us to the arms of God Nov. 9, 2012, in Seattle, WA. We learned a lot about life from her in the years God blessed us with her.\n\nShe was born to Raymond and Gertrude Payton March 4, 1942, in Lewiston. Jean had three brothers and one sister. Growing up, she spent time in and around Lewiston, lived in Montana, then the family settled in Cardiff Spur, and she graduated from Pierce High School.\n\nJean married Garl L. Stephens in 1960, and together they had three children. He passed in a logging accident in 1969. Jean then married Neil C. Johnston, whom she was married to for 43 wonderful years. Together, they had three children.\n\nShe was preceded in death by two sons; BJ, who died in 1971, and Mike, who passed in 2007; as well as her parents and one brother.\n\nFamily was everything to her. She would do anything to make sure they were cared for. Some of her favorite times were when the family would gather at home for biscuits and gravy, enchiladas, ribs, or almond chicken (or whatever the cook's choice was). She never had to ask her family twice if they wanted to come to an enchilada feed. She loved spending time with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It really didn't matter if they were just sitting around talking, or engaged in a game (she schooled us frequently and remains the dice throwing champion), she just loved having her family around her.\n\nIn addition to spending time with her family, she enjoyed playing cards with friends, camping, cooking, going for drives in \"her\" pickup truck, and her dog, Angel. She spent springtime in Vermont, visiting family and friends and helping make syrup on the family maple farm. Every one of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren carry one of her crocheted afghans.\n\nShe was very devoted to God and her church. She never wanted to be in a leadership position, but she always led by being a very humble servant of God. On Sunday mornings she and Neil would cook breakfast for the children of the church so that they could learn about God's love with a full stomach.\n\nAfter raising her children she began work at Tri-State Convalescent, and Life Care in Lewiston as a cook.\n\nJean is survived by the love of her life, Neil; her four children, Val Wachtel, Steve Stephens, Brian Stephens, and Jim Johnston, and their spouses; 13 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren; all of the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley. She is also survived by two of her brothers, Jim Payton of Lewiston and Wayne Payton of Nampa; as well as her sister, Deanna Wise of Weippe.\n\nWe're so very thankful for the years that we had to learn everything you had to teach us. From how to cook and how to be a devoted parent that NEVER gives up on anybody. We truly are the most blessed family of all time for having you as our mom, grandma, wife, and friend.

They were the third and fourth children of Morris Eugene Jasper and Dolores Marie Lauer Jasper, who were both WWII veterans, she working as a nurse and housewife and mother to 12, and he mostly a truck driver and in later year's supervisor of a water/sewer district.\n\nJudy attended Catholic schools in Spokane, WA until moving to Orofino in the sixth grade where she became a budding artist, struggling flute player, Maniac Cheerleader and treasured by all who knew her. Because of her small size and poor eyesight (the effects of a preemie birth), she became shy and reserved but was well-liked and fun-loving. With so many mouths to feed at home, you can rest assured there were no luxuries or frivolities for anyone. All the kids worked, including Judy who had a paper route and spent countless hours babysitting. Her most favorite early childhood memories are of skating on the pond at Manitou Park near their home in Spokane. High school memories center around band and the love of her life, Dennis Fuller, who she married on Jan. 23, 1971.\n\nJudy found her calling by being a wonderful mother to two loving daughters and a willing helpmate to her husband. The girls were both born in Lewiston where Dennis attended Lewis-Clark State College graduating in 1976 when they moved to Seattle where he pursued an acting career. Judy started working when the girls both got in school and was a clerk at a small frozen pizza factory, a pizza supply house, a chicken hatchery and got into rolling dough at Izzy's Pizza, then Round Table Pizza in Eugene, OR where the family had moved in 1986. With the financial realities of raising a family, the acting career had fizzled out and Dennis was employed in the Field Underwriting and Audit sections of commercial and worker's comp insurance companies for many years, up to the present. In 1999 Judy had an industrial disability and settlement enough to pay some bills and buy new appliances. She never worked outside the home again.\n\nJude read books by the score and most of her free time, not involving the kids or Dennis, were spent over a mystery novel, a Pepsi and a cigarette. She quit the smokes in 1995 and quit the Pepsi a few years later, but never quit the book-collection. When the daughters moved out, Dennis' dad, Howard moved in and they all discovered Gold Wing motorcycles and long-distance touring and camping and the three spent many weeks a year riding the western USA. They also became active in the leadership at the local, state then regional level for the Gold Wing Road Riders Association where they made many acquaintances. Judy never really liked motorcycling, but wanted to go with Dennis, so swallowed her fear enough to semi-enjoy all the wonderful sights they found.\n\nAfter the sudden illness and death of her Dad, the Fuller's purchased the family home in Orofino and moved in to take care of her Mom and his Dad, who lived next door and who passed away a few years later. Judy and Rusty spent many years of congenial companionship and prayed The Rosary every day and kept the television very warm. With such a large family, the ladies spent untold hours visiting with relatives, children and grandchildren. After their grandkids started coming in 1999, Judy and Dennis started spending extended winter periods in Phoenix, AZ, where both daughters live. Dennis travelled a lot for work, and Judy was happy to use his \"air-miles\" at any time to visit the kids.\n\nJudy's happy life was tragically altered when she abruptly developed lung cancer which metastasized to many parts of her body and she quietly fought for her life until hearing the call of her Lord to Heaven. She was preceded by her twin sister, and both parents. She is survived by her husband; daughters, Stacy Lynn and Aaron Marie, and granddaughters Sierra, Maya and Jordan and grandson, Jacob. She will also be missed by all 10 of her brothers and sisters and her beloved in-laws, and her memory will be honored as well by over 100 nieces and nephews.\n\nJudy was the kindest, sweetest, most generous and loving woman known to many of us. Although she'd get spitting mad at Nancy Pelosi, you never heard her utter a mean or hateful word about anyone. She lived her life as a faithful friend and as a servant of the Lord.\n\nA Scriptural Rosary will be said starting at Noon, with a Funeral Mass sung at St. Teresa's Catholic Church in Orofino on Friday Nov. 9. Burial will be at the Riverside Cemetery in Orofino at a family service. There will be no viewing. Arrangements are by Pine Hills Funeral Home.\n\nPhoto: Judy Ann Jasper Fuller\n\nFrank Harold Avry, 95, Orofino\n\nFrank Harold Avry, 95, went to be with our Lord, Friday Oct. 26, 2012 at Royal Plaza Care Center, Lewiston.

She was the youngest of three girls in the family. Her oldest sister was Bonnie Spencer, who passed away last summer. Her next oldest sister was Eva Spencer, who is also deceased.\n\nAnnabell met and fell in love with Herman 'Sonny' Schilling when he came to Orofino from North Dakota with the CCC's in the 1930's.\n\nSonny and Annabell were married June 2, 1941 and had 71 wonderful years of marriage, celebrating with a big family gathering last year for their 70th anniversary.\n\nThey have five children: Robert 'Herm' and (Kathy) from Chimacum, WA, Sandi Cree (Bob deceased) from Mill City, OR, Gloria Goade (Greg) Boise, Les Schilling (Andrea) from Orofino and Vickie Buchert (Larry) from Spirit Lake.\n\nThey also have many grandchildren and great grandchildren, the newest of which (Gloria's grandson, Oscar) was born just two weeks before her death.\n\nAnnabell taught pre-school in her basement for 20 years or more--having many children of her former students. She ran a tight ship, but they all thought highly of her and her teaching methods.\n\nAnnabell had a great sense of humor--some of you saw that, maybe some didn't know that. But a story she shared with her kids was how she and her sisters when they were young took red fingernail polish and painted their sleeping father's nose. I think he chased them out of the house when he woke up, but I also think all of them had a good laugh over it--even him!\n\nSonny adored Annabell and she loved him with all her heart. Mom and dad had a special little saying to each other: He saying, \"I love you\" and her responding with, \" I love you the mostest.\" They continued that little love response even as she lay critically ill in her hospital bed.\n\nThey recently were moved to Brookside Landing for needed help--our mom did not want to give up her home (she and dad helped build it) and it was their home for 58 years. It was very hard for her, but it was a necessary move and she admitted it was a nice place, just not home. We children are so thankful for the care they have gotten at Brookside.\n\nMom and dad are charter members of the Ascension Lutheran Church and have been attending there for 50 years of more.\n\nTheir family wants to thank mom and dad's very dear friends, Lila and Roger Myers, who have been so caring and kind and such thoughtful friends to mom and dad.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Sonny, who resides at Brookside in Orofino.\n\nServices will be at Pine Hills Funeral Chapel in Orofino Friday, Oct. 26, at 1:30 p.m. with burial at Weisman Cemetery.

He joined the U.S. Navy in 1945 and served time in Virginia, New Orleans, Cuba and Florida. He was discharged from the Navy in San Diego, CA and moved to Orofino.\n\nOrvall bought the Jean's Bakery from Floyd Benson, which he owned and operated it until 1992. He met and married Janice Robison in 1983. In Clint's younger days he enjoyed hunting, camping with his friends and the many trips on his motorcycle to wherever his heart desired. He would tell his wife Jan that he loved to feel the wind on his face and feel all was well with his world. He never missed a chance to talk to a stranger and loved to pass out free cookies to kids that came to his Bakery. He loved all his family and enjoyed spending time with them. He loved his home, watching the flowers grow during spring time and the deer and the horses that roamed the fields. We can't forget to mention his girls-the kitties. He loved them, fed them and he worried about them. If they got sick he cried over them and off to the vet they went.\n\nThere is a whole lot I could say about this man, my Husband, but will leave it for another day. We will miss him but he will always be in our hearts. Time always goes forward, it never stands still.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jan, and his children: Stanley and significant other Lori Montgomery, Evelyn Henderson; Todd and Tracy Stuffing; Jodine Alm and significant other Danny Weiss; four step daughters: John and Rhonda Pederson; Jeff and Carrie Tenny; Richard and Shelly Kero; Renee Midstokke and significant other Jeff Gibbons.

She spent her childhood in Orofino and went to schools there.\n\nAs an adult she lived in several places around the U.S., including Charleston, S.C., and Denver, two places which she particularly enjoyed. Her grandfather, John P. (Jack) Harlan, was a well-noted historian and local authority on Lewis and Clark; she inherited her love of history from him. She also inherited her memory and recollections of family history from her mother and her well-noted temper from her father. She shared with her family many stories and fond childhood memories of the times she spent with her \"grandpa\" and her much loved \"Daddy.\" She loved interior design and always had a new home improvement project in mind.\n\nElaine is survived by her sister, Carolyn Mattson; two daughters, Jo Frederiksen, The Woodlands, TX, and Michele Rinehart (Tommy Nash), Fort Lee, NJ; three grandchildren, Clinton Garrett, Portsmouth, NH, Gavin and Chloe Nash, Fort Lee, NJ; and six nephews and two nieces.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Charlie and Stila; a sister, Harla Matson; and niece Susan (Sue) Mattson Brown.\n\nThe family suggests that memorial contributions be made to the Clearwater Humane Society, P.O.

She is also survived by one daughter, Elizabeth Ann Rippleman; one granddaughter, Veronica J Edgerly; and one grandson, John B. Rippleman; as well as many close relatives.\n\nIn the summer of 1937 she married the only love of her life, John A McKinney, in Nezperce. The couple lived in Weippe and in 1939 she gave birth to her only child, Elizabeth Ann.\n\nThen in 1941, just before World War II, John was hired by the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) in the city of Baltimore and relocated his new family there. After America was drawn into the war, Elizabeth served her country as a \"Rosie the Riveter\" and was quickly promoted to quality inspector of the B-17 and B-29 bomber planes. When John was drafted into the U.S. Navy in 1943 she returned, with her daughter, to Weippe, to await John's discharge from the Navy. Upon discharge, the family returned to Baltimore, where John's position was reinstated in the Social Security Administration.\n\nIn 1950, John was transferred to Lewiston as a claims reviewer with the SSA. Elizabeth then focused on homemaking and raising their daughter.\n\nThe tragic death of John in 1954 forced her into the job market, where she worked as a photography assistant with Fran Rader Studios, as well as a bookkeeper at Reintjes Beverage Distributors. She returned to her family mill and ranch in Weippe around 1970 and worked as bookkeeper until 2000, when a stroke ended her ability to work and she was brought back to live with her daughter in Lewiston. In 2003, she developed Alzheimer's symptoms and was no longer safe without 24-hour care. She then became a resident of Life Care in Lewiston until her death at 5:30 a.m. Oct. 13, 2012. She will be missed.\n\nThere will be a graveside service at 2 p.m. Wednesday in the Lewiston Orchards at the Garden of Communion section of Lewis Clark Cemetery near Mountain View Funeral Home.\n\nPhoto: Elizabeth McKinney\n\nRobert Michael Una, 64, Orofino\n\nRobert Michael Una passed away peacefully Oct. 7, 2012, from cancer with family at his side.\n\nHe was born to Bob and Martha Una on Nov. 4, 1947.

He was a man of strength and character and will be greatly missed by those who knew and loved him.\n\nKenneth was born to Clyde and Ethel (Brotnov) Lemmon on March 9, 1931 in Brawley, CA. He started school at the old Coeur d'Alene mille site on Upper Fords Creek Rd., and then attended Pierce Elementary School until midway through eighth grade. He graduated from the eighth grade at Vancouver, WA, after his father found work in the shipyards as a welder during World War II. The family then returned to Clarkston, WA his freshman year and he worked summers with his mother packing fruit in Wawawi. They moved back to Pierce his sophomore year and he graduated from Pierce High School in 1949.\n\nWhile still in school, Kenneth worked for Camas Prairie Railroad as a gandy dancer and later as a spiker for Potlatch Corporation, nailing down rails. After finishing high school, he went to work at Hailey Pole Company.\n\nHe joined the Army in January of 1951 serving with the 94th A.A.A. \"Hell on Wheels\", achieving the rank of sergeant. He was stationed in Germany during the Korean Conflict. He was discharged in January 1954 and upon his return, he again worked for Hailey Pole.\n\nKenneth and Geraldine Alice Roby were married on Oct. 15, 1955 at the Orofino Methodist Church and they made their home in Pierce. The family grew to include daughters, Katrina and Connie. At this time he was a pole truck driver and also drove chip truck. The family made their way to White Sulphur Springs, MT, where he found work driving logging truck and it was there that son, Kurt was born.\n\nIn 1962, he started driving concrete truck for Conco Ready Mix during construction on Jaype Mill near Pierce, eventually becoming batch plant operator and superintendent for Columbia Sand and Gravel and Central Pre-Mix. His portable plant took him many places including a pier on Swan Island, near Portland, OR, a missile house in Kent, WA, and assorted canals and bridges all over the west. He was involved in construction of Little Goose Dam in Washington, Milner Dam in southern Idaho, Southway Bridge in Lewiston/Clarkston and the concrete runway construction at Nellis Air Base in Las Vegas, NV and Malstrom Air Base in Montana.\n\nHis work was a very important part of his life and he provided a comfortable one for his family. He retired in 1993 and was able to spend time camping, gardening, RVing, working in his shop and reading. He provided loving care to his aging parents and to his wife as she recovered from multiple surgeries. It brought Kenneth great joy to be reunited with his \"49er\" Forester family and he enjoyed monthly gatherings with them.\n\nHe was a member of the Washington-Idaho Operating Engineers, a past Noble Grand of the International Order of Odd Fellows and a proud and loyal supporter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\nKenneth was preceded in death by his parents, Clyde and Ethel and his brother, Gayle Rand.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Geraldine, and his children, Kathy Steinbruecker and husband, Tim Norton, Connie Robison and husband, Mike, Kurt Lemmon and wife, Lani.

Millie and Charles were parents of Olive, Helen, Jim, Iris, Irene (infant baby girl who died at birth), and John Keeler. All have preceded Jim in death.\n\nJim lived on Cedar Creek Ridge until he was 18 months old, and then moved with his parents to Little Bear. He lived on Little Bear and attended Kendrick school through the sixth grade. He moved back to Cedar Creek Ridge and attended Gold Hill School at Linden, through the eighth grade. He attended the Gold Hill Church in Linden. After graduation from Gold Hill School he moved to Spokane and attended Lewis and Clark High School for one year. He returned to Kendrick to work as a trapper with his brother-in-law, York Martin. That venture didn't pan out so he returned to the family farm on Cedar Creek Ridge. Times were tough so Jim worked where he could, mostly in the woods at Headquarters, Pierce, Weippe, Dent, Elk River and Bovill.\n\nIn 1935 Jim married Dorothy Reed of Clarkston. They had two children, Ron and Judy. They were later divorced. From 1935 until 1941 Jim worked at the creamery in Kendrick.

Bus was raised in Weippe, with his sister, Verla, and as he always referred to him, the \"kid\" brother, Benny. He and Benny have remained close all these years, including having lunch on Thursdays, usually at Station 3, in Clarkston, WA. Bus and his wife, Mary Ellen, visited Verla and her husband, Paul Ennis, and their children in Boise and Sun Valley many times.\n\nBus told great stories about growing up in Weippe and Clearwater County in the 1920s and '30s, including taking a family car trip to the Chicago World's Fair in August and September of 1933. He attended Weippe schools through many of those years, although he moved to Lewiston for his senior year and graduated from Lewiston High School in 1940. He attended the University of Idaho, was in the ROTC program, and served in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. He was discharged from the 95th M.P. Battalion in August of 1946, having served primarily in France and Germany. Upon leaving the Army, Bus returned to the University of Idaho and graduated in 1947. His parents had established a general merchandise store in Weippe and one in Pierce. In the late '40s, Bus bought out his parents' store in Pierce, while Benny took over the store in Weippe.\n\nBus married Mary Ellen Ripley in 1949, and they continued to operate Durant's General Merchandise and Durant's Grocery for many years. Bus served on the City Council and as Mayor of Pierce including during the Centennial Celebration in 1960, which also was attended by Idaho Gov. Bob Smylie. The event was very successful and is still celebrated annually as Pierce 1860 Days. Bus also was a partner in a cabin located off the Laundry Creek Road, eight miles from the North Fork of the Clearwater River, where he allowed many friends and family members to stay while they hunted and fished. Bus liked to prospect for minerals in that area.\n\nBus and Mary Ellen sold Durant's General Merchandise in 1978, but Bus didn't retire.

He participated in many changes to improve the sport, which benefited trapshooters nationwide. He attended the Grand American Trapshoot, held annually in Vandalia, OH, every year from 1962 until 2006, a string of 44 consecutive years and a number he was very proud of.
