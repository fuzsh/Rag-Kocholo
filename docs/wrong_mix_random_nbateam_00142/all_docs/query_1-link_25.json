The numbers below provide a broad overview of the rich benefits St. Luke’s provides to local communities in these counties: Ada, Blaine, Canyon, Elmore, Jerome, Twin Falls and Valley. All numbers are current as of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nCommunity Needs Determination Process\n\nSt. Luke’s community health efforts are directed by community needs assessments, St. Luke’s community boards and Community Health and Engagement. In 2023, St. Luke’s and partners conducted the first joint Community Health Needs Assessment, which is designed to help us better understand the most significant health challenges facing the individuals and families in our service areas.\n\nCommunity Health and Engagement, in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, is responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining optimal community health initiatives designed to address our communities’ most significant health needs.\n\nGiving Thanks\n\nOur work assessing and addressing community needs would not be possible without a visionary board of directors and our community boards. We are grateful for their partnership and guidance.\n\nThe information provided in this report is required by Idaho Code 63-602D, which states that 501(c)(3) hospitals having 150 or more beds must file a community benefit report with the Board of Equalization by Dec. 31 of each year. According to the code, the report is to include a description of the process the hospital has used to determine general community needs that align with the hospital’s mission. In addition, the report shall include the hospital’s amount of:\n\nUnreimbursed services for the prior year (charity care, bad debt, and under-reimbursed care covered through government programs).\n\nDonated time, funds, subsidies and in-kind services.\n\nAdditions to capital such as physical plant and equipment."
