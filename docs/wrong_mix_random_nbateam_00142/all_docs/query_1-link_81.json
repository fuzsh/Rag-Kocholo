        "text": "Join the Committee\n\nIf you would like to get more involved in MBA, consider volunteering for this or one of MBA's other residential committees. Any employee of an MBA residential member company or a select or premier level associate member company may join one or more of these committees.\n\nGet Started: Login to see a full list of committees and councils that you are eligible to join, as well as groups you have already joined. Scroll through the list of your options and click \"Join\" next to this committee to be added to the roster.\n\nMore About Residential Committees\n\nWhat do the residential committees do? Actually, they perform a number of functions. In conference calls, emails and in-person meetings, they advance MBA's national/federal advocacy agenda by providing a forum for the analysis of legislative, regulatory or industry issues. They also serve as a means to inform Association staff of any emerging real estate finance issues. They are one of the primary means through which Association policy is developed. The committees are also communications tools for professionals within the industry. Lastly, the residential committees are also a method by which future MBA leaders are identified and developed."
