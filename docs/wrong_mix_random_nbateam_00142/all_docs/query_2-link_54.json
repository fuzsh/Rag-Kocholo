Check out Dubtown Beat’s exclusive interview, and look inside the mind of an up-and-coming DJ.\n\nHow long have you been DJing?\n\nAlmost two years now, except in the past few months I’ve been more active about it.\n\nHow did you get into DJing?\n\nI’ve always been into electronic music, and I knew I wanted to be a part of the scene. My dad knows a lot of people in the music industry, and they inspired me to start DJing. Also, after attending a lot of EDM concerts it looked like a lot of fun, and like something I would want to do.\n\nWhat kinds of music do you listen to? What kinds of music do you like to spin?\n\nAnything really. Being a DJ you kind of have to be a jack of all trades. Personally, I love anything electronic, but when you DJ a party, you have to appeal to the masses and give them a mixture of what they want to hear and what you want to play for them.\n\nWhat kind of turntables do you use?\n\nRight now I have the Traktor Kontrol S2. It’s definitely not the best in its class, but it allows me to do what I need to do, and I have fun with it. The software is really clean and easy to learn compared to other programs I have used in the past.\n\nHow did you get involved in the Aurora Festival?\n\nI have some extended family up in Maine who own a lot of land, and they throw a festival every year. They knew I started DJing and asked if I would perform for them, and I ended up being the final act of the night.\n\nWhat was your coolest experience behind the decks?\n\nDefinitely being the closing performance at Aurora was the coolest. There was a lot of energy in the crowd. Also the Halloween party that the seniors threw was a great experience too, although a different atmosphere. It was great being able to perform for all of my friends at the party.\n\nWhat do you have planned for the future?\n\nIn the near future, I am trying to coordinate an event with another DJ from Natick. Hopefully I’m going to be a part of some school based events such as any sort of dance or prom. Also, I plan on staying in Boston for college, so I can stay in the city where most of the nightlife is and expand my career from there.\n\nCheck out Derek’s set from the Aurora Festival on his SoundCloud page. It features many popular EDM hits.\n\nCheck back in a few for more great music!"
