        "text": "The Lakers got the young point guard in Ramon Sessions they’ve been searching for since the eve of training camp when the Chris Paul trade fell through. But before L.A. could say hello to Sessions, it had to say goodbye to Derek Fisher.\n\nThe Lakers first traded Jason Kapono, Luke Walton and their 2012 first-round pick to Cleveland in exchange for Sessions and forward Christian Eyenga on Thursday. In a subsequent deal, they sent Fisher and the first-round pick acquired from Dallas in the Lamar Odom trade to Houston for center Jordan Hill.\n\nWhile Sessions, 25, is much younger than the 37-year-old Fisher and undoubtedly in a better position to help the team moving forward, Kupchak admitted that trading away Fisher, the team’s co-captain who was drafted by the franchise in 1996 and went on to win five championships with the Lakers, left him with reservations.\n\n“I’m concerned, yes,” Kupchak said in a news conference Thursday afternoon. “I’m not sure that it will translate into a team that performs any less … but, you can’t underestimate Derek’s contribution from a chemistry point of view and on the court that he’s given to this organization. It can’t be underestimated, and you can’t say that this team is going to wake up tomorrow and play as if he was never here.”\n\nThe Lakers informed Fisher of the trade through his representatives, and Kupchak said he has not spoken to the 16-year veteran directly yet. He also said he did not give Fisher a “heads up” that the trade was coming, but thought Fisher may have “caught wind of the rumor” several days ago.\n\nFisher came into the league with Kobe Bryant back in 1996 and has as strong of a relationship with Fisher as any other teammate he’s had in his career. Bryant publicly lobbied for Lakers management to re-sign Fisher in the summer of 2010 after the Lakers’ championship over the Boston Celtics.\n\nBryant was not happy with Lakers’ brass after not being consulted prior to Mike Brown being hired to replace Phil Jackson this off-season. Sources in the organization said they wouldn’t be surprised if Bryant is upset with Fisher being shuttled out of town without Bryant being contacted first.\n\nFor more complete coverage of Thursday’s NBA trade deadline, check out the St. Louis American’s Trade Tracker.\n\nInformation from Espn.com and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
