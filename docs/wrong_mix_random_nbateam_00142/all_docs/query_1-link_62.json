        "text": "Client Notification\n\nFirst Interstate Bank is aware of issues with the software company, CrowdStrike, causing global system outages. Our Companyâ€™s internal systems are unaffected. However, files we receive from third-party vendors may be delayed, or access to systems hosted by third parties may be affected. We are working with our vendors to understand any potential impact the CrowdStrike event may have on the services provided by these vendors. CrowdStrike has stated that this event was not caused by a security incident or cyberattack, but rather a technical issue related to a program update.\n\nLoan Originator/NMLS Identifier List\n\nThe Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) is designed to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by setting minimum standards for mortgage loan originator licensing and registration. Registration in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) is required for applicable employees of First Interstate Bank.\n\nFirst Interstate Bank employees who are registered as mortgage loan originators are listed below. For more information about mortgage loan originators who are either registered or licensed, please visit www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org. Contact us or visit your local branch for additional information information about the SAFE Act or the NMLS employee registration requirements.\n\nContact Us Find a Branch"
