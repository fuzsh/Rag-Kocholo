Since then, the size and scope of our projects have grown - everything from front porches to new custom homes. Working in our own back yard to all over the northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin area - we're still growing, and happily so. Our one-on-one design approach caters to you; and to that end, every single project is a custom design. We work with you to design the best possible places for you and your family – often creating solutions you might not have considered. Big design ideas are great, but so are the little ones. How you and your family are going to use the space is vital to the overall design - more than just about the floors and walls. When you say that you desperately need more storage for the kids' toys, we understand. When you say that you can't stand your dining room for one more holiday get-together, we know what you mean. We can help.\n\nBernardo Wills\n\nSheila Gates-Ping '01\n\nArchitect\n\nEmail | Website | 509-838-4511\n\nFacebook | Instagram | LinkedIn\n\n153 S.

Before becoming an agent, Kelly worked for her father Jon Kimberling at his Moscow office while attending University of Idaho. In August of 2011, she graduated with a B.S. in Business Productions Operations Management and immediately moved to Rathdrum Idaho at the request of Farmers to take over the agency there. In November of 2015, she sold her agency in Rathdrum, returned home to Moscow to prepare to eventually purchase the business from Jon. That occurred in November of 2022 when Jon and Kelly switched rolls. Kelly now is the agent and Jon works for her. That makes Kelly the second generation of our family to own an agency in Moscow where she can continue to offer our customers the five star service the agency is known for. The Kimberling Family presence in Moscow dates back over 46 years ago when Jon came to work with the Newsome family. We are here for all your insurance needs.

Her affiliation with Warren Buffet Owned “Best of the Best” Real Estate Brand Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices paved her career to becoming a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Luxury CollectionSM Marketing Specialist to provide special expertise for the upscale market. She is also currently part of the Maryland cast of The American Dream, A National Show Cable show that focuses on empowering and engaging content on Real Estate and Lifestyles.\n\nChristy, who has nearly two decades of experience with Over 150 Million in Industry sales is a Maryland native and the daughter of 2 United States Naval Academy Graduates. Growing up between Water Surrounded Severna Park and Annapolis she headed west for the mountains at 18 years old and settled in Idaho. After graduating from the University with a B.S. in Business Marketing, Christy entered the financial service and Insurance Industry in Ski Resort Town Sun Valley, Idaho. Driven by a desire for greater career opportunity, in 1996 Christy moved back home and was offered the opportunity to market New Home Subdivisions. Her new passion was discovered and shortly thereafter the Builder named her Sales Manager and subsequently as their Director of Marketing and Sales she oversaw and sold all their subdivisions and well exceeded their expectations.\n\n“When you’re negotiating someone’s largest asset, there’s a lot of intrinsic value in the trust clients place on real estate professionals, and I take it very, very seriously. It’s hugely important to me to represent their best interests.”\n\nA recent client sent a special thank you of Gratitude “We would not have gotten the sale price for our home without your help. Thank you a million times!”\n\nIt is this part that Christy enjoys most. “I love working with people,” she says. “But I also treat my Clients money as if it was my own and that is what sets me apart from others. Being knowledgeable and full of expertise is important and great but it's also hugely emotional to buy and sell real estate. They say the three greatest stresses in life are death, divorce and moving. The fact that I get to be a part of someone’s life during the moving process and that they can trust me to represent them, alleviate their stress and make it the best experience possible is what I enjoy. It’s about the relationships but also the integrity and trust placed upon us.”\n\nVery Active locally in her industry, Christy has served on the Board of Directors for the Anne Arundel County Association of Realtors and continues to serve on several committees. She is the Head of the County Legislative Committee and the Political Action Committee to keep abreast of critical issues and legislation for Real Estate and waterfront property.
