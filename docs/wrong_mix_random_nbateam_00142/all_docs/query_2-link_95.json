        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks and the New York Knicks met for a game last week in Dallas. Safe to say Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Knicks Coach Derek Fisher didn't meet up for dinner while the Knicks were in town.\n\nAn ongoing tiff between Cuban and Fisher started two seasons ago, when Fisher played nine games for the Mavericks following his trade from the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFisher, a Little Rock native and former UALR player, cited at the time a desire to be closer to his family in Los Angeles and was released. He singed with he Oklahoma City Thunder later in that season and played for them for two seasons, helping them to the NBA Finals in 2013.\n\nCuban called for fans to boo Fisher in his return to Dallas as a player with Oklahoma City, and evidently, he's still a little upset.\n\nCuban was asked before last week's game about Fisher's commitment to the Knicks, who are 4-13 in his first season as coach.\n\n\"I'm more concerned with his health and welfare,\" Cuban told reporters sarcastically. \"I know how hard it is for him to fly and travel and be away.\"\n\nCuban clarified that he had more of a problem with how he handled the situation.\n\n\"It's not so much what he did, but how he did it,\" Cuban said.\n\nFull day\n\nThe Buffalo Bills beat the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, and by all accounts, center Eric Wood made ti through the game without throwing up.\n\nIf the sixth-year pro had, it wouldn't have been a surprise, considering what he put away during Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nWood posted to his Twitter account Thursday the results of a contest he had with friends and family. The goal: Decide who gained the most weight during dinner.\n\nOn a card Wood took a photo of shows that he weighed 302.2 pounds before dinner, and 309.6 pounds after, an increase of 78.4 pounds. On the same card was \"Dan\", who gained 6.6 pounds, meaning Wood gained bragging rights and a full stomach on Thanksgiving.\n\n\"New Thanksgiving tradition I suggest adapting: weigh in when you arrive and leave,\" he tweeted. \"Tough to see but I gained 7.4.\"\n\nGiving back\n\nEach Baltimore Orioles player was awarded $152,288.04 for reaching the American League Championship Series in October, a total of $7.44 million.\n\nNone of the Orioles will be taking a penny of it home, though.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported last week that the Orioles have voted as a team to use their shares as a memorial to former public relations director Monica Barlow, who died in February at 36 after a battle with lung cancer. The Sun reported that the players decided to donate a part of the shares to Barlow's estate, and another part to the LUNGevity Foundation, which raises money for lung cancer research.\n\n\"It was an opportunity to do some good,\" a source told the newspaper. \"And the guys seized it.\"\n\nSports quiz\n\nWhere does Derek Fisher rank on UALR's all-time scoring list?\n\nAnswer\n\nFisher's 1,393 points are third all-time at UALR. He is behind James Scott (1,731) and Malik Dixon (1,603).\n\nSports on 12/01/2014"
