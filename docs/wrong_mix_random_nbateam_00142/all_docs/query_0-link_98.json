Blanchard, AICP.\n\nApplied Research\n\nPlanning the Process: Updating Seattle's Neighborhood Plans\n\nSubmitted by: 2008 Masters of Urban Planning First Year Studio, University of Washington-Seattle, Department of Urban Design and Planning, College of Built Environments\n\nThe project, updating Seattle's 1990's neighborhood plan, called for respecting previous efforts while drafting plans that were relevant to the needs of a changing population, responded to new social issues, and reflected a different financial and political landscape. Through focus groups, the 30-student team not only identified new planning issues, but also assessed the current conditions of neighborhood plans citywide. The final report offered city staffers best practices gleaned from other parts of the country.\n\nPlanning the Process: Updating Seattle's Neighborhood Plans (pdf)\n\nContribution of Planning to a Contemporary Issue\n\nThe Eugene Bicycle and Pedestrian Strategic Plan\n\nSubmitted by: Community Planning Workshop, University of Oregon, Department of Public Policy, Planning & Management\n\nCity planners, students, and community organizers partnered on the project, using input from 600 residents. The plan addresses infrastructure, safety, education, and funding, with implementation actions assigned to both the city and community groups. The resulting plan, The Eugene Bicycle and Pedestrian Strategic Plan, was adopted by the city in 2008. In the year the plan has been in place, 20 of the plan's 82 action items have been initiated.\n\nEugene Pedestrian and Bicycle Strategic Plan (pdf)\n\nProject website: http://tinyurl.com/rb5ka3\n\nApplication of the Planning Process\n\nClimate Change: Impacts and Responses in the Delaware River Basin\n\nSubmitted by: Community Planning Workshop, University of Pennsylvania, School of Design, Department of City and Regional Planning\n\nThis report analyzed the potential impacts of climate change in the Delaware River Basin and uncovered alarming findings: By 2050, 1.4 million residents, 147,000 jobs, and residential property worth $20.4 billion could be in danger from sea level rise, flooding, and storm surges. Drafted by a team of 15 graduate students, it also offers policy recommendations and specific design interventions. The authors point out existing and planned development at risk of inundation, and suggest a regional dialogue on long-term planning.\n\nClimate Change: Impacts and Responses in the Delaware River Basin (pdf)\n\nIn recognition of outstanding papers or class projects by a student or group of students from accredited planning programs. The AICP Student Project Awards Jury of 2008 was chaired by Robert E. Blanchard, AICP.\n\nContemporary Issue\n\nPlanning for Detroit's Tax-Reverted Properties: Possibilities for the Wayne County Land Bank\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning\n\nFaculty Advisors: Margaret Dewar, Eric Dueweke\n\nStudents: Stephanie Bailey, Sophia Fisher, Cornelius Hoss, Meghna Khanna, Mark Ledford, Brian Lutenegger, and Kathleen Maurer.\n\nLong before the recent spate of foreclosures nationally, Detroit had an enormous inventory of vacant and abandoned properties. In the summer of 2006, Wayne County created a land bank to deal with some 3,000 tax-reverted properties in the county, 90 percent of them in Detroit.\n\nBy December of that year, a group of graduate students had created a plan aimed at integrating urban planning into the process. Their project, Planning for Detroit's Tax-Reverted Properties: Possibilities for the Wayne County Land Bank focused on managing the county's inventory, maintaining the properties, and moving the properties toward reuse — and made program and staffing recommendations.\n\nApplication of the Planning Process\n\nCreating a New Place: A Concept Plan for 15 Peabody Street\n\nTufts University, Department of Urban and Environmental Policy, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at Tufts University\n\nFaculty Advisor: Justin Hollander, AICP\n\nStudents: Alison Corwin, Abby Lindsay, Jessica Miller, and Soledad Gaztambide\n\nFour graduate students at Tufts University had a class goal to create a plan that kept the community's interests in mind. Now their vision is being implemented by the city of Salem, Massachusetts.\n\n\"Creating a New Place: A Concept Plan for 15 Peabody Street,\" formed the backbone of a plan for a new neighborhood park in Salem that would give residents better access to much-need open space. It also helped the city secure a $474,000 grant to make the park a reality in June 2009.\n\nApplied Research\n\nOregon Land-Use Stories Project\n\nPortland State University, Nohad A. Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, Portland, Oregon\n\nStudents: Matt Berkow and George Zaninovich\n\nAs Oregon's Measure 37 stirred up controversy, two master's degree candidates set out across the state in search of the bigger picture. After weeks of planning, Matthew Berkow and George Zaninovich traveled to 20 counties, interviewing 100 residents about the measure and blogging their findings.\n\n\"By framing a process in which people were encouraged to share their stories, we were able to get at the values that lay beneath the positions that often surface at public meetings,\" they wrote in \"The Spoke Report,\" a summary of their Oregon Land Use Stories Project.\n\nIn recognition of outstanding papers or class projects by a student or group of students from accredited planning programs.\n\nApplication of the Planning Process\n\nTwo Squares, One Place\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Urban Studies and Planning\n\nFaculty advisors: Karl Seidman, Susan Silberberg\n\nStudents: Abigail Emison, Jonathan Leit, Dina Mackin, Masatomo Miyazawa, Alison Novak, Gena Peditto, Ommeed Sathe\n\nHyde/Jackson Square Boston district lacked cohesion. \"Two Squares, One Place\" was the plan to unite the two squares into \"one place.\"\n\nCompleted by a team of graduate planning students, the project aims to unite the district's physical and cultural elements, develop it as a destination, and position the neighborhood organization to lead its revitalization.\n\nInformed by the team's three-month survey of the district's business owners, community leaders, and residents, the plan envisions a local economy as diverse as the area's ethnic makeup, complementing the district's \"mom and pop\" stores with a variety of new businesses, from open-air markets and pushcarts to major, mixed use redevelopments.\n\nProof of the plan's success was the adoption by a community development corporation of its recommendations for its redevelopment site.\n\nContemporary Issue\n\nGoing Public! Strategies for Meeting Public Restroom Need in Portland's Central City\n\nPortland (Oregon) State University, Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning\n\nFaculty Advisors: Sy Adler, Deborah Howe, Connie Ozawa, Summer Sharpe, FAICIP\n\nStudents: Josh Ahmann, Kevin Bond, Warren Greaser, Sarah Selden\n\nPortland State University graduate students ventured into an area most city planning departments have never explored with such detail. \"Going Public\" reports on Portland's Central City public restrooms including analysis of management, funding and policy alternatives.\n\nAs pioneers in this area, the seven members of the \"Relief Works\" team established their own criteria for restroom need in Portland's Central City.\n\nRepresentatives from over 20 stakeholder groups were interviewed and case studies were done to compare what other cities have done to address public restroom needs and to assess Portland's public restroom facilities for safety, ADA accessibility, building and maintenance.\n\nThe report was so compelling that the city of Portland has incorporated the plan into its strategy for addressing the needs of the homeless.\n\nApplied Research\n\nChanging of the Guard: A New Vision for Fort Monmouth\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Design, Department of City & Regional Planning\n\nFaculty Advisors: James N. Kise, AICP; Eugenie L. Birch, FAICP, Chair; Tom Daniels, Acting Chair, 2005-2006\n\nStudent Team: Peilin Chen, Yiun Lin Chong, Nicole M. Clare, Thomas Hastings, Geoffrey W. Long\n\nFort Monmouth in Monmouth County, New Jersey was one of the military bases slated for closure under the Base Realignment and Closure process announced in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\n\"Changing of the Guard: A New Vision for Fort Monmouth\" provides a plan for the Fort's redevelopment that revolutionizes the status quo.\n\nIt calls for the creation of three distinct town centers in an area where the local strip mall is considered \"downtown.\" It increases density while at the same time protecting the fragile coastal environment and surrounding wetlands. It creates a place that is fundamentally different than its surroundings.\n\nIn making recommendations, students looked at the region's social and economic factors; the needs of the host communities; and existing natural resources and critical environments.\n\nIn recognition of outstanding papers or class projects by a student or group of students from accredited planning programs. The AICP Student Project Awards Jury of 2005 was chaired by Frank Wein, FAICP.\n\nApplied Research\n\nConservation and Landscape Planning Heritage Trail, featuring Historic Places in Massachusetts\n\nAnn Chapman, University of Massachusetts\n\nThis master's thesis proposes a Massachusetts Conservation and Landscape Planning Heritage Trail. The inspiration for this trail comes from the life and work of visionary planner, Benton MacKaye, father of the Appalachian Trail.\n\nContemporary Issue\n\nFood for Growth: A Community Food System Plan for Buffalo's West Side\n\nState University of New York, University at Buffalo\n\nFaculty Advisor: Samina Raja, Ph.D.\n\nStudents: Tangerine Almeida, Mark Bostaph, Mikaela Engert, Samuel Gold, Jeanne Leccese, Jordana Maisel, Anjali Malhotra, Joanna Rogalski, Tatianna Vejar, Keigo Yokoyama, Lesley Zlatev\n\nThe Food for Growth project was a semester-long planning process undertaken by 11 students at the University at Buffalo in the fall of 2003. Under the guidance of Dr. Samina Raja, students in this studio prepared a food system plan for a neighborhood on Buffalo's West Side.\n\nApplication of the Planning Process\n\nSan Miguel 2025: Draft Community Plan\n\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo\n\nFaculty Advisor: Zeljka Pavlovich Howard\n\nStudents: Michael Conger, William Hellper, Cornelius Kempenaar, Brian Leveille, Eric Muzzy, Mandi Raike, Jason Rogers, Santiago Simon, David Stanfield, Fred Thacker\n\nThe two documents created by the students are a product of a six-month-long community study designed to emulate the process of preparing a community plan and expose students to state-of-the-art technology, methods, and techniques used in \"real-world\" planning situations. The project incorporated all aspects of planning including data collection and analysis, community participation and surveying, goal and objective creation, visioning, development of alternative concept plans, and policy creation.\n\nIn recognition of outstanding papers or class projects by a student or group of students from accredited planning programs. The AICP Student Project Awards Jury of 2004 was chaired by Frank Wein, FAICP.\n\nApplied Research\n\nSave Ammendorf!\n\nPratt Institute Graduate Center, New York, New York\n\nKate Zidar\n\nKate Zidar, a student at Pratt Institute Graduate Center, analyzed the Halle neighborhood of Ammendorf in the former East Germany to illustrate possible development scenarios for the area.\n\nAfter documenting recent economic and social changes since reunification, Zidar narrated her findings for a public meeting attended by local building owners and covered by both print and electronic media. She showed how the ongoing adaptive reuse of the former factories for housing and small workshops point to the high likelihood of their conversion to live-work housing.\n\nApplying the Planning Process\n\nTowards a Smart Growth Master Plan: Assessment and Recommendations for the Town of Porter, New York\n\nUniversity at Buffalo, the State University of New York, Buffalo, New York\n\nAdvisor: Ute Lehrer\n\nStudents: Fina Abdel Latif, Brian Gatewood, Fredy Rodriquez Gutierrez, Amy Kacala, Joel Kleinberg, Hui-En (Grace) Lee, Nnabuihe Maduakolam, Karen Palmer, Seokhoon Shim, Brian Slack, Mark Territo, Katherine Wager, Robert Wisener, Ji Zhang\n\nIn 2002, the town of Porter, New York, approached the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the State University of New York, Buffalo, for assistance in developing the first part of a comprehensive plan. Fourteen graduate students took the challenge by analyzing the various characteristics of the community and formulating progressive strategies.\n\nPorter (pop. 7,000) had two distinct population centers on opposite sides of the town. The eastern portion is largely agricultural, while the western portion is more industrial. Amidst this conflict, the town wished to retain its rural character and quality of life.\n\nThe students recommended methods to develop the local economy, in particular competitive ways of boosting agriculture and tourism. The also students suggested the further preservation of open space and farmlands for both the environmental and aesthetic values and economic vitality.\n\nContribution of Planning to Contemporary Issues\n\nIntegrating Transportation and Land Use Planning: Outreach to Planning Commissioners\n\nUniversity of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon\n\nAdvisor: Robert Parker, AICP\n\nStudents: Paul Bender, Carolyn Bonner, Jennifer Dill, Kathryn Frank, Bethany Johnson, Evan MacKenzie, John Mermin, Darren Muldoon, Tina Nunez, Michelle Pezley, Mike Rose, Paul Seilo, Rachel Warner\n\nRaising the awareness of planning commissioners in Oregon on smart growth issues was the primary focus of the project by students at the University of Oregon, Department of Planning, Public Policy and Management.\n\nThey aimed to develop a model for successful dialogue with local government partners in the implementation of statewide transportation and land use planning goals and create model partnership between universities and state agencies.\n\nTo achieve their goals, the students developed written and visual materials, conducted 24 outreach workshops for local planning commissioners and elected officials on smart growth, and conducted informal interviews with professional planners.\n\nIn recognition of outstanding papers or class projects by a student or group of students from accredited planning programs. Judges for the AICP Student Project Awards Jury were Dean Palos, AICP; Alfred N. Raby, AICP; Samuel J. Parker, Jr., AICP.\n\nApplied Research\n\nThe Growth Management Toolbox: A Better Way to Live\n\nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nStudents: Carrie Beach, Laura Everitt, Chris Galanty, Shannon Garvey, DJ Gerken, Brian Haluska, Porter Ingrum, Jim Lamey, Tianjin Luo, Rose-Anne McGrail, Jyothsna Ramesh, Jaymie Sheffield, Sean Suder, Melissa C.
