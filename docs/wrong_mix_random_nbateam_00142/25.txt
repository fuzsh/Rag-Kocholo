Throughout his NBA career, Derek Fisher has learned that his job and the platform it gives him isn’t always about that night’s game. Often it’s about something much deeper.

On Sunday night, after an exhibition game against the Utah Jazz in Oklahoma City, Derek and his Thunder teammates were reminded what a strong effect they have on others. It was then that the Thunder met Ne’Vaeh, a special eight-year-old boy from Washington D.C.

Ne’Vaeh is suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma and has a rare tumor located on his brain stem. Ne’Vaeh is considered Stage 4 and according to doctors the condition has a life expectancy of 9 to 12 months.

But Ne’Vaeh isn’t giving up and through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he was on hand to support the Thunder on Sunday night. His wish was to meet the team. But Ne’Vaeh did more than that. Just through meeting him, he provided Thunder players and staff with inspiration, as Dan Mahoney of Thunder.com wrote:

“This little guy roamed the baseline as he watched both teams warm up. He danced, smiled, cheered and handed out special ‘Walking By Faith with Ne’Vaeh’ wristbands.”

Several players came over to talk to Ne’Vaeh during warmups and after the game he met with some of his favorite players, including Kevin Durant and Derek, who was honored to shake the hand of such a remarkable young man. Ne’Vaeh’s parents told the Thunder that the visit was a dream come true and a blessing for their son.

“Anything that brings a smile to that face is beyond priceless to us,” said Ne’Vaeh’s mother, Mattie Littleton. “Days like this bring more life into him and make his dreams come true. These are priceless memories.”
