The Walking Dead star Jeffrey Dean Morgan once auditioned for a role in One Tree Hill, his wife Hilarie Burton Morgan has revealed.

In the latest instalment of her new podcast Drama Queens, which sees her look back on her time on the hit teen drama alongside co-hosts Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz, the actor recalled Jeffrey telling her about how he went up for the part of Keith Scott, uncle to Chad Michael Murray's Lucas Scott.

"When I met Jeff, he was like, 'Oh, I auditioned for that show.' And I'm like, 'Wait, what?'," Hilarie laughed. "My husband, Jeffrey, auditioned for [Craig] Sheffer's part, and he was like, 'I like the whole gritty, garage – you know, that edgy thing.'"

Sheffer appeared as Keith in the first three seasons of the popular WB outing, which started airing in the US back in 2003.

Jeffrey and Hilarie were introduced to one another six years later by Jensen Ackles – Jeffrey's on-screen son in horror-fantasy series Supernatural – and his wife Daneel, who starred opposite Hilarie as Rachel in One Tree Hill.

The couple welcomed their first child together, a son named Gus, in March 2010. Their second child, daughter George Virginia, was born in February 2018 and they tied the knot the following year.

"Had [Jeff] shown up in those tight jeans that Sheff was wearing, I would've definitely had kids earlier," Hilarie joked.

One Tree Hill is currently available to stream on All 4. The Walking Dead airs on AMC in the US. Meanwhile, UK viewers can catch up on the show via FOX and NOW – and from July 2, the show moves to .
