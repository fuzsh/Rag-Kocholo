Did you know that actors Paul Rudd, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jeffrey's his wife Hilaire Burton Morgan are co-owners of a candy store in Rhinebeck, New York? The place, located at 42 East Market Street, is called Samuel's Sweet Shop and every once and a while you just might spot one of them at the store.

This week not only did one of the three celebrities show up in Rhinebeck to meet a fan, by the end of the day the actor became the fan.

According to a post on Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Instagram, Morgan was in town to meet a young lady from Southern California named from Cadence as well as her her brother Devon, mom Amanda, and dad Andres.

This was not a paid "meet & greet" where the celebrity spends 1 minute with you and is gone. This meeting was a special request of Cadence to meet Jeffrey Dean Morgan which the Make A Wish Foundation made happen.

We had the best day together... and like I said, I got myself a new bestie. Cadence is an amazing gal... more than that... strongest, bravest, coolest, most thoughtful person that l've ever met. What she doesn't know, is that I was the lucky one here. I'm the one that came out of this introduction a better person. - Jeffrey Dean Morgan

It appears that Mr. Morgan and Cadence spent time at a number of shops in Rhinebeck. Megabrain Comics welcomes family and new friends as well.

Thank you so much for choosing me to have this adventure with! Trust me, I know how lucky I am. - Jeffrey Dean Morgan
