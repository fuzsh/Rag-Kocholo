        "text": "#20: Elton John & David Furnish\n\n15 Years\n\nIf we learn anything from Elton and David’s love story, it’s that if you’re single, you shouldn’t hesitate to accept an invitation to a dinner party because you might just meet the love of your life. That’s what happened to Furnish when he agreed to be a friend’s plus one to a dinner party at Elton John’s place in London in October of 1993. David and John hit it off immediately and obviously the 15 year age difference didn’t bother either of them, as David returned the next night for a one-on-one meal with the Rocket Man. The couple has basically been together ever since, creating a civil union in 2005 and getting married in 2014 a few months after same-sex marriage was legalized in Great Britain.\n\n#19: Hilarie Burton & Jeffrey Dean Morgan\n\n16 Years\n\nIn May of 2009 a soon-to-be 27-year-old Hilarie Burton and a just-turned 43-year-old Jeffrey Dean Morgan were introduced by their mutual friends Jensen Ackles and Danneel Harris. Danneel was Hilarie’s former co star on “One Tree Hill” and Jensen had worked with Jeffrey on “Supernatural.” Well, as it turns out, sometimes your friends do know what’s best for you. And these two didn’t waste any time consummating their relationship either, as Morgan hinted on Instagram in May of 2021: “Been with her ever since that night. In fact… two kids later… one 11 (do THAT math!)”. They were happy then and they still are now, so a 16 year difference clearly didn’t - and doesn’t - matter to them!\n\n#18: Heidi Klum & Tom Kaulitz\n\n16 Years\n\nLike with the two previous couples on the list, Klum and Kaulitz hit it off right away. They first met while Klum was in her home country of Germany hosting “Germany's Next Top Model.” Kaulitz, the guitarist for the German rock band Tokio Hotel is, well, also German and that connection turned out to be just one of many things these love birds had in common. As one source told US Weekly, “They fell into an easy rhythm really quickly.” One thing they don’t have in common is their age. When Kaulitz was born in September 1989, Klum had recently turned 16. But as Klum told InStyle, besides when people ask her about the age difference, “I don't really think about it that much otherwise.”\n\n#17: Leonardo DiCaprio & Camila Morrone\n\n22 Years\n\nWe could just tell you that DiCaprio is almost 23 years older than Morrone or we can point out the fact that she was only 6 months old when “Titanic” premiered in US theatres. When millions of people around the world were crying as Leonardo sank to the bottom of the ocean, Morrone was crying because she needed her diaper changed. Cut to 2010 and Al Pacino introduces 12-year-old Camila - whose mother he was in a relationship with at the time - to his friend Leonardo. And no, not in that way. But now cut to 2017 and DiCaprio reconnects with Morrone at the Cannes Film Festival, and about six months after that they’re dating. Insert your own “king of the world” joke here.\n\n#16: David Cross & Amber Tamblyn\n\n19 Years\n\nDid you hear the one about the young actress who hung out with the comedian 19 years older than her on a plane and fell in love? While you might think this was a setup to a David Cross comedy sketch, it’s actually how he met his beautiful wife, actress and writer Amber Tamblyn. Cross has said that despite having seen one another around LA, he was “slow to make any moves because of our age difference.” But you also can’t fight true love and Cross has also said that from the moment they met on that plane it was “so obvious” they would eventually be together. And they did eventually start dating, get married and have a child together… which we assume means that Tobias got over that never-nude thing.\n\n#15: Florence Pugh & Zach Braff\n\n21 Years\n\nToo many of us,Zach Braff will always be the young Dr. Dorian who walked into Sacred Heart Hospital as a wide-eyed intern. But, while his appearance might still be rather youthful, the man was born in April of 1975, which means he was 43 or 44 depending on when exactly in 2019 he started dating Pugh. As for Florence, she had just turned 23 in January of 2019 and the age gap hasn’t gone unnoticed. After Braff commented on one of Pugh’s IG posts in 2019, a user mentioned him, posting “You're 44 years old.” Pugh replied to the commenter herself, and the “Little Women” star later told Elle magazine that she felt she had to because “People need to realise that it's hurtful.”\n\n#14: Rupert Murdoch & Jerry Hall\n\n25 Years\n\nFormer model Jerry Hall seems to have a bit of a thing for older men. Or maybe it’s that older men have a thing for her. But, prior to her marriage to Media Mogul Rubert Murdoch, she had a two-decade long romance with the man who really does move like Jagger, Mick Jagger himself. But the 13 year age gap between Hall and Jagger is nothing compared to the 25 years the nonagenarian Murdoch has on her. The couple started dating in 2015 and were engaged within four months. They tied the knot in 2016.\n\n#13: Alec Baldwin & Hilaria Baldwin\n\n26 Years\n\nIt sounds like the IMDB summary of a romantic comedy: a soon-to-be 53-year-old man is having dinner with a friend when he sees a beautiful girl. Sure, she is 26 years younger than him, but that doesn’t stop him from walking up to her and telling her “I must know you.” He gives her his number and less than a year and a half later they’re married in New York City. Well, it isn’t a movie, but the man in the story is a movie star. The man was Alec Baldwin, the woman was the soon-to-be Hilaria Baldwin and as of 2021 the couple was still going strong and have added six kids to the mix as well.\n\n#12: Kris Jenner & Corey Gamble\n\n25 Years\n\nIt’s a tale as old as time. You’re in Ibiza, you’re having a good time at Kanye West’s party for fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday and you happen to notice the momager-mogul of the Jenner/Kardashian empire. She’s about 25 years your senior, but you get to chatting and a few months later you’re a couple. Come on, who can’t relate to that? Ok, so no one except Corey Gamble can, and while many in her family weren’t too sure about him and the relationship, Jenner was and has remained so. Which is all that matters right?\n\n#11: George Clooney & Amal Clooney\n\n17 Years\n\nGeorge Clooney was one of Hollywood’s great bachelors. That was true until July of 2013 in Lake Como, Italy when he met the brilliant and beautiful Amal Alamuddin. But while there was a pretty immediate attraction on Clooney’s end, the “Ocean’s Eleven” star was a little unsure about how Amal felt towards him, because of the age gap. As he told Howard Stern, [“I couldn’t tell if she liked me because I’m 17 years older than her. So she might have thought I was you know, grandpa.”] Obviously she didn’t, or she really likes grandpas, because in October they reportedly had their first date and in April of 2014, their engagement was confirmed. Well done, grandpa!\n\n#10: Sam Taylor-Johnson & Aaron Taylor-Johnson\n\n23 Years\n\nIn 2008, Aaron auditioned for the film “Nowhere Boy.” The film was Samantha’s directorial debut and when Aaron walked in she found the leading man in the film and in her life. And while a 23-year age gap might seem like a big deal to some, Aaron told The Telegraph UK that, “When I met Sam I'd already lived a life far beyond that of most of my contemporaries – I didn't relate to anyone my age.” Now, while the connection was intense, the actor and director kept things very professional during the making of the movie. They still hadn’t been on a date or kissed when the film wrapped, but the moment they were done Aaron told Sam he was going to marry her.\n\n#9: Jason Statham & Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\n\n20 Years\n\nWe’d love to tell you how these two met, but we don’t know. Some reports have them meeting at Coachella, while others put it on the set of “Transformers: Dark of the Moon.” We do know that it was 2010, and while the 20 year age gap did raise some eyebrows, Rosie has said that they “have a connection that has nothing to do with age.” For those curious about wedding bells, Rosie has said that she believes in marriage but, “being in a happy relationship is much more important to me.” And while they did get engaged in 2016, they have yet to officially tie the knot as of 2021. They do have one child, with another on the way as of August 2021.\n\n#8: Elliott Spencer & Stephen Fry\n\n30 Years\n\nComedia, actor and writer Stephen Fry has been a staple of the British comedy scene since the 1980s. And speaking of the 80s, his husband, Elliott Spencer was born in said decade, 1987 to be exact. Which was the same year tha Fry turned 30. But, even though Stephen had found lots of professional happiness, personal happiness wasn’t as evident until he met Elliott in 2012. As you may have expected, there were some shocked onlookers given the age gap between these two. But as you also probably expected, Spencer shot back at the haters saying, “I don’t care what people think. Stephen is the love of my life, the light of my life.”\n\n#7: Ben Kingsley & Daniela Lavender\n\n31 Years\n\nFrom “Gandhi” to a “Sexy Beast,” Ben Kingsley has played many roles over his long and illustrious professional career. And the same is true for his private life, in which he has played the role of husband four times, including his marriage to Daniela Lavender - which began in 2007 when he was 63 and she was 32. While the 31 year age difference is a lot, it isn’t new to Kingsley who, in the 90s dated Kate Townsend, an actress who was 30 years his junior. They dated, but no, she isn’t one of his three ex wives.\n\n#6: Warren Beatty & Annette Bening\n\n21 Years\n\nIf you thought George Clooney was one of the great bachelors, let us tell you that his bachelorhood doesn’t hold a candle to one of the all-time most iconic Hollywood bachelors, Warren Beatty. In fact, Carly Simon - who has said that the second verse of her famous song “You’re So Vain” is about Beatty - when talking about having dated the famous actor, followed it up with, “Hasn’t everybody?” And that was very true until he met Annette Bening for lunch to prepare for their co-starring roles in 1991's “Bugsy.” That was it: the 50 something year old Beatty had found his perfect someone in the 30-something year old Bening - and his bachelor days were over. They were married in 1992.\n\n#5: Harrison Ford & Calista Flockhart\n\n22 Years\n\nSure, the odds are really low that someone who has never seen the original “Star Wars” movies would end up married to the man who played Han Solo in those films…. But, you know how Han feels about odds! Yes, it's true, Calista Flockhart hadn’t seen the films when they first met and, as she told Jimmy Kimmel, she had no idea what a Millennium Falcon was for quite some time. But that and the 22-year-age difference were no match for the true love that started to bloom between these two when they first met at the 2002 Golden Globe awards. According to Calista, she even sometimes forgets how big the age gap between them is, telling Hello magazine, “It doesn't factor into our relationship at all.”\n\n#4: Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones\n\n25 Years\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones share a love for each other and a birthday. Yup, Michael and Catherine were born on the exact same day, September 25th - just 25 years apart. We don’t know if that amazing coincidence has anything to do with it, but the “Traffic” costars have remained one of the strongest couples in Hollywood since meeting all the way back in 1998. After seeing her in “The Mask of Zorro” Douglas, like pretty much everyone else in the world, wanted to meet Zeta-Jones. But, unlike the rest of us, what Michael Douglas wants he often gets and this was no exception. They ended up meeting thanks to being introduced by a fellow actor while they were both in Europe for a film festival. They were married in 2000.\n\n#3: Rod Stewart & Penny Lancaster\n\n26 Years\n\nOne of Stewart’s biggest hits, “Maggie May” was based on his experience of losing his virginity to an older woman. And while his first time was with an older woman, he has spent the years since 1999 with a woman 26 years his junior who he met when she accepted a dare from her mates to request an autograph from the singer. Penny was in her late 20s at the time and was studying photography. The next night, she found herself invited to a show to take pictures of Rod. Stewart got her phone number, but didn’t call for six months - allegedly because it was too soon after the breakup of his last marriage. Penny and Rod eventually tied the knot in 2007.\n\n#2: Sarah Paulson & Holland Taylor\n\n32 Years\n\nPaulson and Taylor started dating in 2015, 10 years after they first met. And no, this wasn’t one of them playing the long game or trying to get out of the friend zone. This was two people meeting at a party and being attracted to each other. As the Marcia Clark actress told the New York Times, Taylor was “probably the most exquisitely beautiful woman” she’d ever seen. But both women were in relationships at the time, so that was that. Cut to 10 years later, they meet again, they’re both single and they start following each other on Twitter. And anyone who thinks older people don’t understand Social Media should know that it was Taylor - then in her early 70s - who first slid into Paulson’s DMs.\n\n#1: David Foster & Katharine McPhee\n\n35 Years\n\nMcPhee might have been runner-up on “American Idol”’s season 5, but she’s the winner of David Foster’s heart. Although, it took a while for them to get there. In fact, the two first met during her run on the show when the 22-year-old performed Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing,” a song that Foster wrote. Even though there are over 35 years between them, this meeting led to a great friendship and Foster even played piano at McPhee’s wedding when she married Nick Cokas in 2008. McPhee filed for divorce in 2014 and she and David were spotted getting “cozy” in public in 2017 right around the time that his fourth divorce was being finalized. McPhee and Foster married in 2019 and had their first child together two years later."
