        "text": "Overview\n\nOverview\n\nDear Resident and Fellow Candidates:\n\nAs Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at Cleveland Clinic, I would like to thank you for taking a genuine interest in our programs. Our Department consists of over 90 professional staff members that provide over 65,000 outpatient visits and 10,000 inpatient admissions yearly. Patients come locally, nationally, and internationally to seek our care. We see some of the most complex patients in the country. We work as a team with physicians, psychologists, advanced practice providers, and therapists. Our superb faculty and teaching sites provide a robust outpatient, inpatient, and consultation liaison psychiatry experience that make our trainees uniquely qualified to tackle any patient scenario they may encounter. Our medical students, residents, and fellows are an integral part of Cleveland Clinic’s mission, which is “Caring for Life, Researching for Health, and Educating those who Serve.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of mental health for patients and caregivers alike. The Department is highly valued for the collegial, empathic, and expert clinical care we deliver. Leveraging telemedicine, collaborative, and value based care, our psychiatry residents and fellows are well positioned to navigate and adapt to the future of health care. Cleveland Clinic is at the forefront of medical innovations and health care delivery models, and behavioral health is a partner in these ventures. I hope you will join us in this journey!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLeo Pozuelo, MD, MBA, FACP, FACLP\n\nDepartment Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Adult Psychiatry Residency at Cleveland Clinic offers a unique training opportunity at one of the most renowned medical centers in the world. Cleveland Clinic is a trusted healthcare leader. We’re recognized in the U.S. and through the world for our expertise and care.\n\nCleveland Clinic has been internationally recognized as a leader in the development of innovative solutions to the changing face of healthcare. At the October 3, 2012 Presidential debate, President Barack Obama said of Cleveland Clinic: \"At the Cleveland Clinic, one of the best healthcare systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.\"\n\nThe Department of Psychiatry and Psychology operates within the framework of the Neurological Institute, a multidisciplinary group of more than 300 medical, surgical and research specialists dedicated to the treatment of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. The Neurological Institute offers a disease-specific, patient focused approach to care with close collaboration between Psychiatry, Psychology, Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neuroradiology.\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nExpert Faculty who consistently operate with an approachable, open-door policy.\n\nRigorous training in both Biological Psychiatry and Psychotherapy.\n\nSpecialty training in Neuropsychiatry (including epilepsy, movement disorders, multiple sclerosis).\n\nPsychodynamic Psychotherapy training led by the Cleveland Psychoanalytic Center.\n\nComprehensive didactic curriculum with protected time away from clinical duties.\n\nFlexible “Longitudinal” Schedule in PGY3 and PGY4 years – each is unique, designed by the resident.\n\nOpportunities for the development of resident-run specialty clinics (e.g. Bariatrics, Women’s Mental Health, LGBTQ+, Spanish-Speaking).\n\nOpportunities for institution-funded travel to national meetings to present scholarly work/research.\n\nDiversity of faculty, resident group, and patient population.\n\nNo mandatory call or weekend duties for 3rd and 4th year residents.\n\nFellowship Opportunities\n\nView Fellowship Opportunities at Cleveland Clinic's Neurological Institute.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Department of Psychiatry and Psychology is one of four departments within Cleveland Clinic's Neurological Institute, which includes Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neuroradiology. The department has its origins in the vision of Cleveland Clinic’s first chairman of Neurological Surgery, W. James Gardener, MD, who at a 1943 meeting of Cleveland Clinic’s Administrative Board, proposed adding a department of psychiatry to the growing Cleveland Clinic. Eventually, in 1946 the Department of Neuropsychiatry opened, and in 1960 split into separate departments with A. Dixon Weatherhead, MD, serving as Psychiatry’s first Chairman. In July, 1961 the Department welcomed its first resident trainee, and by 1976 the General Adult Psychiatry Residency Training Program had achieved full accreditation.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nDiscover the role diversity and inclusion plays at Cleveland Clinic and at its Graduate Medical Education program, as well as our diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\nLearn More\n\nLeadership\n\nLeadership\n\nProgram Directors\n\nKaren Jacobs, DO\n\nDirector\n\nHi! My name is Karen Jacobs and I have been the Program Director for the Adult Psychiatry Residency for the past TEN years. Hard to believe, as it has gone so fast! I have practiced as an outpatient psychiatrist for the past 31 years, the first fourteen in private practice prior to being recruited back to Cleveland Clinic. We have navigated some of the toughest times in history and yet have not only managed to persevere but rise above the obstacles that stood in our way. Program leadership is dedicated to providing the most rewarding experiences for our residents. We have a fluid curriculum, outstanding staff, and of course, I believe some of THE finest residents you will find anywhere.\n\nI feel so fortunate to be doing what I do! My passion is for residents, education, wellness, and advocacy. While working out of a world class enterprise, we have never lost our family like atmosphere. We like to support one another, celebrate each other’s accomplishments, be there in the tough times, and share many moments over food. We welcome residents from all over the globe and continue to welcome the expanding families of our residents as we will soon celebrate the third birth in the past year!\n\nWhen I am not at Cleveland Clinic, I love to travel, learn about various cultures, hike, read, listen to music, keep up with the local sports teams, enjoy a variety of edible creations, and spend as much time with my family and friends that I can.\n\nVrashali Jain, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nHello all! Thank you for your interest in our program. I have been an Associate Program Director since the beginning of 2020 - that is just before Covid-19 came slamming our doors. In this time, I have been amazed by the leadership, dedication, passion, generosity and team work at Cleveland Clinic. I could not have been prouder than to be a part of this dedicated team of psychiatrists, psychologists and residents who came together in an effort to put their patients first in time of national crisis.\n\nAt the Clinic our goal is to provide our residents with the tools and guidance they need to be successful in their chosen path by having a curriculum that provides the right amount of structure, flexibility and exposure to the breadth and depth of our chosen specialty.\n\nI am a home grown consult liaison psychiatrist with a passion for Neuro-Psychiatry, ethics in psychiatry, end of life care and education. When not working, I like to spend time with my family, discover new restaurants, read, watch movies and solve the mystery of work-life balance.\n\nGabriella Stamper, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nHello, and thank you for looking into Cleveland Clinic for your residency. My name is Gabriella Stamper and I began serving as Associate Program Director in 2023. I have been with the Cleveland Clinic since 2021 after completing my Adult Psychiatry Residency at the University of Washington. The decision to leave Washington was difficult, but the choice to join Cleveland Clinic was easy! If you are a lifelong learner, value comradery with your peers and want to live, work and play in a vibrant environment, Cleveland Clinic and the wider community cannot be beat.\n\nI primarily see patients in the outpatient setting, splitting my time between Cleveland Clinic's Main Campus and Stephanie Tubbs Jones Family Health Center. My particular interests lie within women's mental health and working to implement collaborative care. I have had the fortune of working with our trainees in multiple venues, both in their outpatient clinics and embedded within my own. Having the opportunity to teach and mentor residents has been a highlight of my job, and I continue to learn from them on a daily basis. Outside of work, I love to spend time with my family, watch movies, play outdoors and ride rollercoasters at Cedar Point.\n\nTravis Krew, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nWelcome! My name is Travis Krew, and I had the privilege of being appointed as one of the Associate Program Directors in 2023. I completed my residency training at the Cleveland Clinic in 2020, and part of my decision to continue as staff was the opportunity to educate and engage with trainees.\n\nI am an inpatient psychiatrist on one of the acute units at Lutheran Hospital. I will work closely with you while you learn about inpatient psychiatry during your first year, and my goal is to provide you with a firm foundation for your training. I am also passionate about electroconvulsive therapy, and I manage our robust service at Lutheran while offering guidance to other treating providers in the region. The growth of our interventional services, including electroconvulsive therapy, esketamine, and transmagnetic cranial stimulation, over the past few years has been exciting.\n\nI was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, and it's a great region to build a career and raise a family. World-class culture and outdoor recreation are easy to access, and the cost of living can't be beaten.\n\nChief Residents\n\nJared Harp, DO\n\nPGY-4\n\nAdministrative Chief\n\nKristin Kinsley, MD\n\nPGY-3\n\nAcademic Chief\n\nMorgan Torcasio, MD\n\nPGY-4\n\nOutpatient Chief\n\nHello! Congratulations on all of your hard work and making it to this exciting moment in your career. We are thrilled that you have chosen psychiatry and are interested in learning more about what we can offer at the Cleveland Clinic. Training at one of the largest healthcare systems in the United States will give you access to a diverse cultural and socioeconomic patient population. We see a large variety of patients on our many inpatient, outpatient and consult-liaison services, including patients that are neurologically and medically complex. Our on-call experience gives residents early autonomy to manage patients while also having easy access to supervision when necessary. Our graduates regularly report back on how well prepared they felt for independent practice!\n\nWhile residency can be busy, we also appreciate the work-life balance offered by our program. There is no mandatory call during PGY3-4, so you have the freedom to pursue what is most important to you! In your free time, you will find Cleveland to be a proud, historic, and affordable city with access to the outdoors, professional sports, arts, cultural events, and so much more.\n\nMost importantly, our greatest strength comes from the character of our residents, the moments we’ve shared, and the relationships that will last long after our training ends. We may be biased in thinking that our co-residents are the very best, but they are personable, passionate, brilliant and committed, among many other things.\n\nIn only a few months, you will make a difficult, life-changing decision on where to train for the next four years. We hope that you will consider spending that time here with us.\n\nWishing you all the best,\n\nJared, Kinsley and Morgan\n\nCurrent Residents\n\nCurrent Residents\n\nPGY-4\n\nDaniel El Dabh,

Each module lasts four weeks (28 days) resulting in 13 modules per year.\n\nThe PGY1 year includes six (6) modules of medicine and neurology and seven (7) modules of psychiatry. The inpatient internal medicine rotations are an opportunity to learn and practice \"bread and butter\" inpatient medicine at South Pointe Hospital. On-call at South Pointe is done on a rotating basis, with approximately one overnight call shift every seven days. The outpatient internal medicine rotation provides an opportunity to serve a historically underserved population at Stephanie Tubbs Jones Health Center. The emergency medicine rotation is completed at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus alongside rotators from a variety of specialties. Both the neurology consults and inpatient neurology rotations are completed at the Main Campus. On-call during the neurology inpatient rotation is done as one week of night float, in addition to two short call shifts per week.\n\nThe inpatient psychiatry rotations during PGY1 are performed at Lutheran Hospital, Cleveland Clinic's primary facility for inpatient psychiatry (100 inpatient psychiatry beds). Residents will spend one of their first two modules at Lutheran Hospital doing “onboarding” where residents are exposed to each unit and float system throughout the month with direct senior resident supervision. The five adult inpatient psychiatry modules during the intern year are spent primarily on Lutheran's high-acuity psychiatry units. During this time, the \"on-call\" experience is done as seven weeks of night-float (12-hour shifts, Sun- Thurs) and seven weeks of evening float (8-hour shifts Mon-Fri). Residents rotate at the Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center (ADRC) for inpatient chemical dependency (detoxification) during their onboarding month and see new patients on this unit throughout the year.In preparation for PGY2 night float at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, throughout the year each PGY1 resident will spend five weekend day shifts (8 am to 8 pm) with the PGY2 on-call resident. This allows the PGY1 resident to gain exposure to inpatient consults and emergency psychiatry and helps to prepare them for PGY2.\n\nPGY-2\n\nThe PGY2 year provides an opportunity to gain experience in psychosomatic medicine (CL psychiatry), child and adolescent psychiatry, and a variety of other psychiatric sub-specialties, including geriatrics, forensics, and emergency psychiatry. During this year the resident will once again rotate at the Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center (ADRC), now for two module long rotations Outpatient continuity clinics begin during the second year, where residents spend one 1⁄2 day per week seeing outpatients for medication management. Starting in the fall of the second year, residents are exposed to psychotherapy. Each resident is assigned one weekly psychotherapy patient in addition to weekly supervision with a dedicated psychotherapy supervisor.\n\nCall responsibilities during PGY2 involve responding to consult requests for patients in the ED and those admitted to the hospital at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus. The schedule was recently changed to a Night Float system where one resident covers the pager from 7pm until 8am Sun-Thu. Residents on the Consultation-Liaison psychiatry (CL) service will be responsible for “Short Call” from 4pm-8pm. Otherwise, weekend call is split evenly between the remaining residents in 12-hour shifts. There is no 24-hour call except for Holidays. In addition, the weekend on-call resident will have the opportunity to work with PGY1s doing “buddy calls\" to help prepare them better for PGY2 as well as Neurology residents rotating through CL.\n\nPGY-3\n\nThe PGY3 year marks a shift in focus to outpatient program requirements. With the majority of required rotations now complete, residents can focus on areas of interest within psychiatry. In the spring prior to the PGY3 year, the resident will meet with the Associate Program Director and the assigned academic advisor to design his/her schedule.\n\nElectives may be performed as 4-week modules or as longitudinal (2-12 months) experiences, depending on resident preferences and the nature of the elective. Popular electives often include:\n\nWomen's mental health\n\nPsycho-oncology\n\nTransplant\n\nNeuropsychiatry clinics (epilepsy, movement disorders, dementia, neuropsychology)\n\nSleep/CBT for insomnia\n\nLesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBTQ+) Clinic\n\nBioethics\n\nEating Disorders (The Emily Program)\n\nECT\n\nResearch\n\nPGY-4\n\nDuring the PGY4 year, residents are required to rotate on the inpatient psychiatry units at Lutheran hospital in a junior-attending role. Residents also spend two modules gaining exposure to neuropsychiatry, by rotating through various subspeciality clinics including epilepsy, movement disorders, neuropsychology, and dementia. The remainder of the year is free for elective rotations. There is also an opportunity for residents to create sub-specialty clinics to serve the unmet needs of special populations. With both faculty and departmental support, residents can create clinics or rotations that fit their interests. Resident-created clinics have included: women’s mental health clinic, LGBTQ+ clinic, bariatrics clinic, and Spanish-speaking clinic As in the PGY3 year, residents will meet with the Associate Program Director and academic chief resident to help design the year's schedule.\n\nElectives may be done as longitudinal experiences, modular experiences, or a combination of the two.\n\nAcademic Half Day\n\nThe majority of the didactic curriculum is presented within the framework of Academic Half Day. Each Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., all residents are excused from clinical duties to focus on academic objectives. Residents attend two 70-minute seminars designed specifically for the PGY training level, Grand Rounds, and a PGY class specific process group. Afterward, residents return to their clinical services.\n\nTraining Sites\n\nCleveland Clinic Lutheran Hospital\n\nLutheran Hospital, a 12-minute drive from the main campus on West 25th street, houses the primary Adult Inpatient Psychiatry units of the Cleveland Clinic Department of Psychiatry with 100 behavioral health beds distributed among general psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and a specialized mood disorders unit. Lutheran is also home to the Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center (ADRC), which provides inpatient detoxification, partial hospitalization, and an intensive outpatient rehabilitation program. Lutheran is just blocks away from the famous West Side Market and a burgeoning food scene.\n\nCleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital\n\nFairview Hospital is a 500-bed level II trauma center facility on the west side of Cleveland, and home to the 13-bed child and adolescent psychiatry unit where PGY2 residents rotate for two months.\n\nCleveland Clinic Hillcrest Hospital\n\nHillcrest Hospital is a 496-bed level II trauma center facility on the east side of Cleveland, which is home to the second year Consultation-Liaison (Psychosomatic Medicine) regional hospital rotation. This rotation allows residents to gain experience with consultation in a smaller, regional hospital setting.\n\nNorthcoast Behavioral Healthcare\n\nNorthcoast is one of six Ohio state psychiatric hospitals, located on the south side of Cleveland. This hospital is home to the second year Forensics rotation. PGY2 residents spend one month on a restoration to competency unit, as well as participate in forensic didactics with forensic psychiatry fellows.\n\nResident Life & Benefits\n\nResident Life & Benefits\n\nSalary and Benefits\n\nA comprehensive description of resident benefits can be found with Cleveland Clinic's Graduate Medical Education Department.\n\nHealth, Vision, Dental, Insurance, and Investment Plan Summary.\n\nSalary and financial highlights.\n\nGraduate Physicians Manual.\n\nTime Away\n\nVacation and Personal/Sick Days: 4 weeks (20 paid working days) + 1 wellness day.\n\nMaternity: 12 weeks paid leave.\n\nPaternity: 4 weeks paid leave.\n\nThe Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA): Entitles all employees up to 12 weeks off, unpaid, after one year of employment.

Lunch is also provided for weekend day calls. These funds may be used at most Cleveland Clinic dining facilities, including all hospital cafeterias, Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Aladdin's Eatery, and Subway.\n\nWellness & Preventive Medicine\n\nIn 2007, the Cleveland Clinic appointed the country's first Chief Wellness Officer, Michael F. Roizen, MD. Wellness & Preventive Medicine is responsible for implementing wide-­reaching programs that aggressively advocate for healthy living. Wellness initiatives implemented for all employees, including residents, include: free membership to Cleveland Clinic fitness centers, yoga classes, trans-­fats banned from all public and patient menus, sugared beverages removed from cafeterias and vending machines, smoke-­free campuses and workforce, weekly farmer’s market on-­campus and a dedicated wellness store. Learn more about Employee Wellness at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn addition, our residency program has also implemented wellness initiatives of our own. We take into consideration the individual wellness needs of each resident to best tailor each individual's experience. Specific initiatives include making sure residents have time to attend doctor's appointments, an additional \"wellness day\" that was implemented in 2019 in addition to current vacation policies, truly protected didactic time, a weekly class specific process group, and separate resident work/lounge spaces at both Main Campus and Lutheran Hospital.\n\nResident Social Activities\n\nOutside of the work setting, our residents are social and engage in various activities not only as individual classes, but also between classes. Activities enjoyed together by our current residents span a wide variety of interests, include physical activities such as hiking in the Cleveland MetroParks or Cuyahoga Valley National Park, rock-climbing, biking, and ultimate frisbee, as well as attending concerts at Blossom Music Center, local brewery trivia nights, trying new restaurants and bars in Cleveland, playing both board and video games, as well as knitting.\n\nWhile many of our institution focused resident activities have been placed on hold due to pandemic restrictions, we are looking forward to resuming activities as soon as it is safe to do so. Below is a list of previously scheduled department resident activities.\n\nAnnual Welcome Picnic\n\nThis family-friendly annual event serves to welcome our new interns and to show appreciation for the hard work of our faculty. This event is often held at the Program Director's home or a local Metropark.\n\nSpring Resident Retreat\n\nThe spring retreat is an opportunity for residents to get off campus for a day to focus on team-building, wellness and academic enrichment activities. Previous retreats were held at local campus where residents had the opportunity to participate in a high-ropes course, rock-climbing wall, and workshops about boundaries, fun neuroscience, team building, the Cleveland Botanical Gardens, and top golf.\n\nMovie Club\n\nHeld at least once per year, movie club is an opportunity for residents to get together outside of work to discuss issues of psychiatry in film.

Our residents agree. Cleveland offers the balance of a big city, historic suburbs and beautiful countryside, all within a 30-mile radius. Greater Cleveland is home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Severance Hall and the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Cleveland Botanical Garden – all within just minutes of the clinic. Cleveland also boasts a number of professional sports teams, including the Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Browns, and Cleveland Cavaliers. Cleveland is becoming quickly famous for the rapidly growing food and restaurant scene and is proud to claim Iron Chef Michael Symon as one of its own.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic is centrally located with easy access to downtown, the “Eastside” and the “Westside.” Most residents live in one of these three areas and find that the cost of living in Cleveland is affordable and traffic is quick and easy. The Cleveland metro area has a number of excellent public school systems as well as numerous private school alternatives.\n\nThe Greater Cleveland area has much to offer any outdoor enthusiast, from the shores of Lake Erie to the north, to the gradually rolling foothills of the Allegheny Mountain Range to the east. The snowy winters are ideal for skiing, snowshoeing, or just sipping hot cocoa in front of a fire. Our residents enjoy hiking in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, or in the over 22,000 acres of nature reserve at one of the eighteen Cleveland Metroparks; its bicycle paths for mountain or road bikes stretch for miles. Lake Erie boasts a number of beaches and water sports, as well as a flourishing wine industry with over 180 wineries in the state.\n\nCleveland is also a great place for kids and families. The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a hotspot for kids of all ages and frequently offers discounts to Cleveland Clinic employees.Patterson Fruit Farm, located in beautiful Geauga County, offers apple, peach, and strawberry picking, and an annual Family Fun Fest in the fall, at which the Cleveland Clinic House Staff Association link out holds a yearly free event. The Cleveland Botanical Garden is home of the Hershey Children’s Garden and the Glasshouse, which offers daily butterfly releases. The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad offers children’s programs including the famous Polar Express Train.\n\nCleveland Children’s Academy\n\nThe Cleveland Children’s Academy is a partner of the Cleveland Clinic and is a top choice of Cleveland Clinic residents for childcare. Located adjacent to the Main Campus, the Children’s Academy offers daycare from 6am to 7:30pm, M-F, for children aged 6 weeks to Interactive Kindergarten (5-6 y/o). As this is a popular choice for residents, spaces fill up quickly and there is usually a fairly long wait list.\n\nCleveland Children's Academy.\n\nCleveland Clinic House Staff Association\n\nHouse Staff Association\n\nThe House Staff Association (HSA) represents the resident body of Cleveland Clinic trainees and works to promote well-being, interests and education of Cleveland Clinic residents.

The Department of Psychiatry has a robust research program, which provides excellent opportunities for faculty, fellows, residents, and medical students. Research is conducted in various disorders, including substance dependence, child psychiatry, mood disorders, pain, bariatrics, consultation-liaison psychiatry, and community psychiatry. Areas of research include genetics, brain imaging, neuroinflammatory biomarkers, and other biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment effects. Several clinical trials are ongoing for a range of treatment modalities, including pharmacological agents, neurostimulation techniques, psychotherapies, and community interventions. Outcome research is also an area of particular interest. In addition, active collaboration opportunities are available with colleagues in other specialties, including neurology, neurosurgery, cardiology, primary care, and oncology.\n\nPGY2 residents are introduced to common elements of research early in the year as part of the Academic Half Day curriculum. Each resident is required to present at the Department of Psychiatry Grand Rounds in their final year and also complete a quality improvement project, typically with their class. Residents are encouraged to publish papers or present at regional and national meetings.\n\nTrainees have participated in projects on neuromodulation, delirium, suicide, ovarian cancer, women’s health, chronic pain, seizure disorders, sleep disorders, post-myocardial infarction depression, transplant psychiatry, and many more.\n\nResidents presenting at national meetings are eligible for registration and travel reimbursement by the neurological institute and GME. In the past, residents have presented at:\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\n\nAcademy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry\n\nAmerican Association of Directors of Psychiatry Residency Training\n\nCleveland Consultation-Liaison Society\n\nResidents may also present their work at Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute Research Day (NIRD), which is held annually at the Intercontinental Hotel and Conference Center on the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus. Generous cash awards are given to the most outstanding poster and platform presentations – our residents have consistently been recipients.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic Adult Psychiatry Residency Program offers numerous opportunities for residents interested in learning more about how to conduct research. We have both a one- month research elective in the third or fourth year of the program and a dedicated research track for highly qualified applicants who have had significant research experience prior to residency. Below is a partial list of staff in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology who have volunteered to serve or are currently serving as research mentors for residents.\n\nMurat Altinay, MD is an adult psychiatrist with interests in treatment resistant mood disorders (major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder), neuromodulation (transranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS)) and LGBT mental health.
