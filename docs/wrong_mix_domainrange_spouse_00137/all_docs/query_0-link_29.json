        "text": "Oscar winner Halle Berry took to social media — and took off her top — to give flowers to her 2004 movie Catwoman.\n\nThe DC Comics-based film was slammed when it debuted, but Berry leaned into it, famously accepting her Razzie Award for Worst Actress while holding her Oscar for Best Actress in the other hand.\n\nIn the years since, the movie that also starred Sharon Stone and Benjamin Bratt has become something of a cult classic, something she referenced in her sexy posts, for which she used a pair of kitties she adopted after finding them in her yard to protect her modesty.\n\n\"It’s been 20 years since I had the honor of bringing this iconic character to life,\" Halle began a post on social platform X.\n\n\"THANK YOU to the fans who have embraced Catwoman (even if it was a little delayed ). Patience Phillips [her character] is finally getting her due. Meow.\"\n\nTo a similar Insta post, Berry wrote, \"She will always be close to my heart and I will forever be Patience Phillips aka CATWOMAN!\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly recently published an oral history of the film, in which Berry talked about the backlash at the time.\n\n\"Being a Black woman, I'm used to carrying negativity on my back, fighting, being a fish swimming upstream by myself,\" she told the magazine.\n\n\"I'm used to defying stereotypes and making a way out of no way ... I went and collected that Razzie, laughed at myself, and kept it moving,\" she continued.\n\n\"A little bad publicity about a movie? I didn't love it, but it wasn't going to stop my world or derail me from doing what I love to do.\"\n\nShe insisted the Catwoman \"experience changed me,\" adding she went from being a dog person to a cat lover \"because of that experience and those relationships.\"\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.\n\nWe are finally getting our first real look at Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan.\n\nThe first trailer for the upcoming Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, directed by James Mangold, has just been released, and not only do we get to see Chalamet as Dylan, we get to hear him sing as Dylan as well.\n\nThe clip opens with Ed Norton as Pete Seeger talking about Dylan to an audience.\n\n“Let me tell you a little story, a few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in on us out of nowhere and he played us a song,” Norton shares. “In that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.”\n\nAs he’s talking, we see Dylan's back as he walks through the streets of New York, before it cuts to Dylan singing “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” to an audience. There are then more images of Dylan in New York, as well as clips of Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, and Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez.\n\nIt ends with Dylan looking up at Seeger, and saying, “that’s all I got so far,\" with a kid telling him, “good start,” before the opening chords of “Like a Rolling Stone” kick in.\n\n“Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s,” reads the film’s description, “A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.”\n\nSo far there’s no release date for A Complete Unknown, although the description says it will be in theaters this December.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

It marks a reunion with his Veil co-star Elisabeth Moss, who also stars in the series. Details on the upcoming season, as well as Charles' role, are being kept under wraps.

All rights reserved.\n\nFirst reactions to the highly anticipated Marvel movie Deadpool & Wolverine are out, and they're glowing. The film had its world premiere Monday in New York, and it's getting high praise — a lot of it having to do with the fact that even though Deadpool is now under the Disney umbrella, the jokes are just as cutting and raunchy, and the fight scenes are just as bloody as ever.\n\nDeadpool director Shawn Levy (LEE-vee) tells ABC Audio that no one at Disney ever told him no, and that surprised him.\n\n\"Every time we turned in a draft of our script or a cut of a scene I expected the pushback, and it never came,\" he says. \"As [Disney CEO] Bob Iger said after he screened the movie ... 'I knew what I was getting into — in for a penny, in for a pound.'\"\n\n\"Everyone at Disney and Marvel seemed to know that no one wants a sanitized Deadpool,\" he continues. \"They want a Deadpool that is as audacious as we all expect and love, and we were able to make a movie that way with their full support.\"\n\nAhead of the movie's release Friday, Levy shared that he's most excited for fans \"to see these two iconic antiheroes on screen costarring in a movie for the first time ever,\" along with some \"surprise characters that the internet has not entirely predicted. And the unexpected delight of seeing certain actors/characters appear that might not be anticipated.\"\n\nOf course, Levy isn't giving much away about the film, but he did tell ABC Audio his favorite rumor that the internet sleuths got wrong.\n\n\"I think it would be that King Charles is in the movie. I think that the sleuths got it wrong on that front,\" he reveals.\n\nDisney is the parent company of Marvel and ABC News.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Literally.\n\nKeanu was chatting with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert about the bad luck he had making Good Fortune, Aziz Ansari's forthcoming comedy.\n\n\"I was filming a scene with Aziz Ansari and Seth Rogen and we were in a cold plunge,\" Reeves began, adding he \"was loving it.\"\n\nAfter they finished the scene, he was doing the \"cold shuffle\" and his foot found a gap in a protective carpet. \"My foot got caught in the pocket in the shuffle, and then I went [down],\" he continued, miming the action. \"And then, in slow motion, I went falling ... and my patella, kneecap, cracked like a potato chip.\"\n\nKeanu joked, \"Comedy’s hard, man.\"\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Henson and her former Empire co-star Terrence Howard, and Don Cheadle, among others.\n\nBased on the 2021 Fight Night podcast, the series tells \"the infamous story of how an armed robbery during the night of Muhammad Ali’s historic 1970 comeback fight changed not only one man’s life, but an entire city's destiny.\"\n\nJackson plays notorious real-life gangster Frank \"The Black Godfather\" Moten, and Hart portrays a local hustler known as Chicken Man.\n\nSet to James Brown's \"The Payback,\" the stylish trailer sets the scene: Looking for a chance to make a name for himself, Chicken Man hosted an after-party following the Atlanta fight between Ali and Jerry Quarry.\n\nThe event drew hundreds of the city's most influential people — and a team of crooks who ripped them off.\n\nThe hourslong, audacious heist saw as many as 200 would-be partiers methodically robbed at gunpoint, with the victims including normally untouchable members of the so-called Black mafia, including Jackson's Moten.\n\n\"I don't think you boys got any godd*** idea who you stealing from,\" Hart tries to warn the robbers.\n\nAccording to the streamer, \"Suspected of masterminding the crime, Chicken Man is hellbent on clearing his name but must convince his old adversary, J.D. Hudson (Don Cheadle), one of the first Black detectives in the city’s desegregated police force, who is tasked with bringing those responsible to justice.\"\n\nOn his Instagram back in January, Hart enthused he's \"crazy excited about this series\" and teased of an \"epic\" cast team-up.

But now he's trying to find something a bit more solid in himself.\"\n\nIndeed, in the video Benedict teases, \"It feels now that the next thing may change me entirely.\"\n\nExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes adds, \"He's a charming man who's trying to find his way.

Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck/Joker is about to take center stage in the \"trial of the century\" for his crimes from Todd Phillips' Oscar-winning original.\n\n\"Two years ago, the name Arthur Fleck hit Gotham like a hurricane,\" a voice says at the beginning of the trailer. Another adds, \"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr. Well, he's not. He's a monster.\"\n\nWe then see a meet-cute between Fleck and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn, with the latter telling him, \"When I first saw Joker, when I saw you, for once in my life I didn't feel so alone anymore.\"\n\nToward the end of the trailer, we see the duo onstage at what looks to be a talk show studio set with \"Joker & Harley\" in bright lights.\n\n\"I got this sneaking suspicion that we're not giving the people what they want,\" Fleck says. Harley Quinn comforts him, saying, \"It's OK, baby. Let's give the people what they want.\"\n\nThe trailer also gives us hints as to what songs we'll hear in the film, including \"When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You),\" \"For Once in My Life\" and \"Get Happy.\" The latter is sung quietly between Harley and Joker, with Phoenix in chains as he's literally getting ready for the judgement day, as the song says.\n\nThe official synopsis reads: \"Joker: Folie À Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\"\n\nJoker: Folie À Deux opens in theaters Oct. 4.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
