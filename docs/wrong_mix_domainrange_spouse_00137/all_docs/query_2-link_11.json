        "text": "There is something about celebrity that gets people excited. When I heard that 3 celebs own a candy shop in Rhinebeck, NY I have to admit I thought that was pretty cool and wanted to know more. What brought actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, actress Hilarie Burton Morgan and actor Paul Rudd together to buy a small business in this tiny Hudson Valley town?\n\nOver the weekend I took the short ride from the Capital Region to explore Samuel's Sweet Shop. Here's what I found.\n\nIn 1994, a man named Ira Gutner opened Samuel's of Rhinebeck and operated the candy shop for 20 years before suddenly passing away in 2014. Gutner was a beloved member of the community and his passing touched many people, including the Morgan's and Rudd.\n\nWith Samuel's of Rhinebeck in danger of having to close, these three celebrities joined forces with others to purchase the store and keep Ira's dream alive. Today the store located at 42 East Market Street is known as Samuel's Sweet Shop and you never know who you will run into there.\n\nPeople Magazine's \"Sexiest Man Alive 2021\", Paul Rudd was home for the holidays.\n\nSamuel's Sweet Shop is more than just a celebrity owned business, it's one of the finest candy shops I have ever visited. Let's take a look inside.\n\nCelebrities You Might Run Into In Upstate New York...Because They Live Here"
