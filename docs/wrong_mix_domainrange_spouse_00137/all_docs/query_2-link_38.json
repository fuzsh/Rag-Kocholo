        "text": "Ingrid Andress is not the first country singer to struggle with the National Anthem. She's not even the first country singer to draw criticism after performing the National Anthem during MLB's All-Star festivities.\n\nA decade ago, one of country music's biggest stars of the 21st century was caught peeking at his hand for the lyrics to the familiar song. He survived online attacks and went on to become a multi-time Entertainer of the Year.\n\nAndress drew criticism after her uneven performance before the MLB's Home Run Derby on Monday (June 15).\n\nThe \"More Hearts Than Mine\" singer has not yet commented on the moment.\n\n\"Wishful Drinking\" — a duet with Sam Hunt — is another of her hit songs.\n\nRelated: Who Is Ingrid Andress + Why Was Her National Anthem So Unusual?\n\nTaste of Country has found the best, worst and most unusual country music National Anthems. The list does not include fine National Anthem performances from Reba McEntire and Eric Church because the NFL does not allow those videos to be streamed from websites other than YouTube. Each is certainly worthy, however.\n\nSuper Bowl National Anthem performances dominate, but the first video below is another from an MLB All-Star Game.\n\nThe Best Country Music National Anthems:\n\nLeAnn Rimes at the 1997 MLB All-Star Game:\n\nChris Stapleton at Super Bowl LVII\n\nFaith Hill at Super Bowl XXXIV:\n\nThe Worst Country Music National Anthems:\n\nLuke Bryan at the 2012 MLB All-Star Game:\n\nIngrid Andress at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby:\n\nAnd Finally, the Most Unusual National Anthem:\n\nJackson Dean's Pre-Fame High School National Anthem:"
