In lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to the family.\n\nDarrell O Hanner Sr, 84, Lecanto, Florida\n\nDarrell Oren Hanner, Sr., of Lecanto, passed away on Friday, April 26, 2024 at the HPH Citrus Hospice House. He was 84. Darrell was born in Detroit, MI to Oren P. and Mildred V. (Hawkins) Hanner, and was second in line of their 13 children. Upon graduating from Luxora High School in Luxora, Arkansas in 1959, Darrell enlisted in the United States Navy. He served six years there, then in 1968 he re-enlisted, which ended up being a career for him, and retiring as a Tech Sergeant from the United States Air Force. He met his wife Beverly A. Berry in Worcester, MA in September 1960, and on July 15, 1961 they married. They had four boys in their little family: Darrell, Jr. in 1963, Ronald in 1965, Randy in 1966, and last but not least, Robert in 1969. Darrell also loved working on cars, and a few years before he retired from the military in 1981, he opened a small car lot, called B&H Auto Sales, which he ended up giving to his brother-in-law. He then opened another one called Civic Auto Sales in Goldsboro, North Carolina, claiming it was his civic duty. In 1984, Darrell opened up a second Civic Auto Sales in Franklinville NY, and in 2005 he sold that to his manager Doug Nixon, in order to fully retire. Cars were just in his blood, as he claimed it was his father’s fault, so from then on he would buy a car then fix it up, sell it, and buy another, and so on. He and his wife Beverly bought a winter home in Homosassa, FL in 1986 and a few years later, moved to Ft. Pierce, FL. After a while, they moved to Lecanto and have remained here full time since. Darrell was preceded in death by both parents, and also by six brothers and a sister: Gerald, Dean, Doug, Wayne, Delano, and Gary Hanner, and Judy Johnson; and a son, Randy Alan Hanner. Those left to cherish his memory are his devoted wife of 63 years Beverly Ann Hanner of Lecanto; his sons Darrell O. Hanner, Jr., Ronald W. Hanner, and Robert P. Hanner, all of Lecanto; sisters Janice Cline, Carol Travis, Rita Hull, Connie Damon, Cathy McKinney, Bobbi Jo Hanner Whittley, and Tammy Hanner Beal; brother Oren Paul Hanner, Jr.; twelve grandchildren: Alan, Andrew, Joel, Jeramy, Jesse, Jon, Ryan, Aaron, Robert Jr., Yanni, Angelo and Stasie; ten great grandchildren: Faylin, Damien, Alec, Mason, Kya, Dominic, Shyanne, Christian, Seth, Emma Grace and one little girl ready to be born soon.

She was 65. Susan was the eldest child of Adeline and Bill Harrison, born on January 28, 1959 — a birthday she shared with two of her three siblings. A fifth generation Floridian, she grew up in Sarasota, where she delighted in going on boat rides through the bay with her family. The Harrisons also made frequent trips to the family ranch in Parrish and to Gainesville to cheer on the Florida Gators. A lifelong fan, she followed all Gator sports and took any losses to heart. Susan was a devout Christian. She was raised at First Baptist Church of Sarasota and made her profession of faith when she was 8 years old. Her entire life, she was active in church ministries, most recently as a deacon and member of the prayer committee at First Presbyterian Church of Inverness. One of her projects with the church involved collecting suitcases for foster children. Music was a defining part of Susan’s life. At age six, she began piano lessons. She honed her skills over the next six decades. Following the recitals of her youth, she played for countless church services, community concerts, weddings and funerals in Citrus County, where she lived for 36 years. Additionally, she played the organ and handbells, and had a beautiful voice. When she was not accompanying her church’s choir on the piano, she was likely singing in it. Susan was among the first students at Pine View, Sarasota’s public school for gifted children. She graduated second in her class at age 17 in 1976. She then studied at Sophie Newcomb College, part of Tulane University, in New Orleans, where she majored in music and sociology, graduating summa cum laude in 1980 and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society. A year earlier, on March 9, Susan’s life took a serendipitous turn. She had planned a weekend trip to Sarasota to attend a Vladimir Horowitz concert. When the renowned pianist canceled his performance, Susan’s mother suggested she remain at school. To cheer her up, Susan’s Phi Mu sorority sisters dragged her to a party, where she met a medical student, Tom Hendrick, who would be graduating and starting his residency in Ohio only a few months later. Susan and Tom dated weekly for the remaining eight weeks of Susan’s semester, then continued their relationship long distance before marrying on June 14, 1980. While Tom worked as a surgical resident with the United States Air Force at Wright State University, Susan attended the University of Dayton School of Law. She graduated third in her class, was the editor of Law Review, and later received the highest score of anyone taking the Florida Bar exam in 1983. Despite her acumen, Susan never practiced law. She had her daughter, Katie, in 1984, followed by her son, Charlie, in 1987. She devoted herself to their upbringing. Though she loathed driving, she spent countless hours chauffeuring her children across central Florida to gymnastics, golf and tennis practices and competitions. She chaperoned field trips, helped with homework, prepared meal after meal and counseled her children through the travails of growing up. The family also enjoyed frequent trips to Disney World, as well as annual vacations over the children’s spring and summer breaks from school. As empty nesters, Susan and Tom embraced traveling, visiting more than 70 countries and all seven continents. It was on a month-long cruise to New Zealand and Australia this winter that her illness became apparent. Susan’s greatest joy was spending time with her family and her dogs, which, over the years, included several English setters, poodles, yorkies, a Lhasa Apso and two Biewer terriers. In 2019, she became a grandmother, a role in which she thrived. She relished visits and FaceTime calls with her grandchildren and showered them with thoughtful gifts. She leaves behind Tom Hendrick, her husband of nearly 44 years; one sister, Nancy Taylor (Dobie); two brothers, Bill (Cathi) and Robert (Nancy) Harrison; her children, Katie Vincent (Bill) and Charlie Hendrick (Mia); four grandchildren, James and Andy Vincent and Ellery and Tanner Hendrick; and three dogs, Duke, Bailey and Tinsley.

She was 92 years old. Born in Spelter West Virginia to Earl and Phelma Ashcraft, Marian was one of three children. After graduating from high school, Marian moved to Washington, DC to work for the federal government. There she met the love of her life, Aubria Minyard. The two were married and raised a family in Falls Church, Virginia, where Marian taught Sunday School for many years. After retiring, Marian and Aubria moved, first to a home on the Chesapeake Bay and later to Floral City Florida. After Aubria passed away in 2008, Marian moved to Pennsylvania, where her daughter and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren live. Marian’s personal relationship with Jesus was the source of great joy and constant comfort for her through good times and bad. Her faith in God was surely one source of her unfailingly positive outlook on life. If ever there was someone who was truly confident in Jesus’s promises, “and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord,\" it was Marian (2 Corinthians 5:8). And in keeping with Jesus’s promises, we who loved Marian can take comfort that she has been reunited not only with Aubria, but also with her sister Norma, her great-granddaughter Angelina, and so many other loved ones who passed before her. Marian is survived by three children, her daughter Joyce Dawley of Bethlehem, PA; her son David Minyard of Vienna, VA; and her son Frederick Minyard of Bedford, VA; her brother David Ashcraft of Fernandina Beach, Florida, FL; her grandchildren Emily, Erich, Hannah, Michael, Monica, Nicholas, Noah, and Rebecca; and great grandchildren Austin, Jack, Jordan, and Madeline.
