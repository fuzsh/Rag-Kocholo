        "text": "Tag Archives: Jeffrey Dean Morgan\n\nCelebrating my favorite TV show…one more time! (Part Two)\n\nContinuing on with my weekend of fun!\n\nAfter Damon Runyan’s panel on Saturday, there was a nice break to enjoy some lunch. I not only got a lunch break, but I had the pleasure of seeing my dear friend Kathy, who lives very close to the Sheraton where the convention took place…and her new, little bundle of joy, Brayden! It was a fantastic way to break up the day and catch up with a friend!\n\nMisha Collins (“Castiel”) was the next guest to grace us with his presence on stage! This guy is hardly EVER serious on stage, so I knew we were in for many laughs.\n\nThe laughs started immediately when Misha very openly admitted to being the brunt of a prank on-set. “Jared fondled my balls.” (Keeping it classy, as always.)\n\nAs far as paybacks go, his exact words, “I am not allowed to fuck up Jared!”\n\nIf he could spend one day with any one actor from Supernatural, who would he spend it with and what would they do? It would be Amy Gumerick and they would “crochet.” Yes, he was suggesting otherwise!\n\nHe did tell one story that was somewhat serious. When they were shooting the first episode of season 7, Misha was REALLY ill with some sort of stomach virus. He was vomiting A LOT and Jensen came to his rescue and made production shut down when Misha could not do much more for the night. (What a good egg!)\n\nMisha noted that he wanted “Misha” in the meta episode “The French Mistake” to be ‘more of a douche bag,’ as a big joke about himself. He said, “I wanted to douche up my hair…like on The Vampire Diaries!” (Snort!!!!)\n\nOne of the last things he said during his panel was, “I sincerely hope Cas is revived at some point.” We sincerely do too, Misha.\n\nThe other big event for Saturday was the evening dessert party, which apparently was renamed the cocktail party because there were no desserts this time. This was indeed a massive bummer for a pregnant chick who a) can’t drink and b) was looking for at least a little treat that she didn’t have to feel guilty for eating (like she would if she was not preggers).\n\nAnyway, I of course did not take notes during this party, but I did take some pictures of the really creative centerpieces fans made. The highlight of this party was not only the bit of face time the celebs gave every table of attendees, but was also the judging of the centerpieces by the celebrities, including hilarious commentary from them!\n\nA few pictures…\n\nSunday morning arrived quickly and with much anticipation! Sunday is when we all got to see Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, the stars of the show!\n\nDespite being exhausted and on west coast time, they were in rare form. I didn’t take a ton of notes (Hey, I was smitten!) but here some highlights:\n\nJensen and Jared both would love to do a Supernatural movie! One major reason – it could be rated R, and they could do/say things that they cannot on TV!\n\nJared’s least favorite “Sam” hair is when it is, as he said, “coiffed.” He wanted to cut his hair so badly at one point, but Eric Kripke told him, “This isn’t Felicity!”\n\nJared tweeted about this recently, but he got into more detail about his, as he called it, “fan girl moment,” when meeting the guitar player for Pearl Jam, Mike McCready. He said he was so nervous that he was squeezing his wife’s hand and was acting so over the top that Jensen had to leave the backstage area because he was so embarrassed for Jared!\n\nJensen said the best directing advice he ever received was from Kim Manners and it was simply, “Homework, homework, homework.” 🙂\n\nAs for what happened at the end of the 3rd episode of Supernatural this season, both Jensen and Jared liked the plot. They said it was “kind of a mercy kill.”\n\nThe next event I attended was easily the highlight of the convention for me, a “Dean” girl. 19 other fans and I participated in a 30-minute Q&A session with Jensen Ackles. It was REALLY cool to interact with him that way. It was very formal, but awesome nonetheless.\n\nA fan asked about what, if any, props from any of his TV or movie projects was he able to take with him. He had to think about it for a moment, but recalled that he has a pick axe handle from My Bloody Valentine, books and other items from Bobby’s house on Supernatural…and he plead the 5th on wardrobe pieces! 😉\n\nNext, he talked about directing in Season 6 and Season 7 and how the two episodes’ experiences were different. Jensen said, “Weekend at Bobby’s was kind of a day in the life. I could set the cameras and let the actors play.” But “The Girl Next Door” was much more difficult because he acting in so much more of that episode. He added, “This episode technically was a little more difficult” as well, with the inclusion of the flashbacks.\n\nHe was bummed about a couple of big edits that took place in post production this season. One was a fun montage scene of Dean in the cabin, where he was drinking beer and sword fighting with one of his crutches. It was cut simply for time.\n\nAnother big shot that was cut was at the end of the latest episode. He told us that there actually WAS a shot of the “hot” cheese (which was actually just vanilla yogurt with food coloring in it) being poured on the victim! Can you imagine? We actually said we preferred the scene the way it was shot, with the image being created in our imaginations only!\n\nHe added that “Psychologically, directing AND acting was a nightmare” and “There is a sense of calm when I’m acting.”\n\nJensen explained that there were several times where he knew he’d require extra takes to fully get back into character. He did say that flipping back and forth between being a director and being an actor got easier as filming progressed. He’s so talented!\n\nAnother part of directing that he truly enjoyed was working with the kids in “The Girl Next Door” because the actors were really pliable and liked taking suggestions from him.\n\nA fan asked a really fun question for us, but proved to be a harder one for him! What are 5 things we don’t know about Jensen?\n\nHe hates being late. (I can relate – I’ve had nightmares about being late for everything from work to concerts! Ugh!)\n\nHe is thankful for his patience, as he often finds himself staring at the front door of his house waiting for his wife Danneel to finish getting ready.\n\nHe sometimes will tell a white lie to keep Danneel running on time for dinner reservations! LOL.\n\nHe sleeps on the right side of his bed in Vancouver and the left side in LA.\n\nHe has not used a straight razor since the beginning of Supernatural and Danneel actually prefers him with a beard. He does as well, since when he is shaved, he feels less like “Jensen” and more like “Dean.”\n\nBonus fact that we found out at the end of the Q&A – his wife has good taste! She bought him a gorgeous Panerei watch as his wedding gift. (I’m pretty sure my hubby has the same exact watch.)\n\nAs for Dean and Sam’s Season 7 arc, Jensen said, “Dean is trusting of Sam. He understands Sam is dealing with a very unique situation.\n\nAnd one minor spoiler – look away now spoilerphobes – there will be one episode with “Evil Dean” and “Evil Sam” in season 7. Sounds like fun to me!\n\nAnd the moment EVERY attendee was waiting for was next – J&J on stage together!\n\nThe first thing these nice boys said was to the first-time convention attendees: “Welcome to the Supernatural family!” So sweet.\n\nThey were asked about pet peeves and they mentioned rude people on planes. Jared grossed us all out with talk of a man who was coughing up “loogies” but not spitting them out. “Where did they GO?” he asked!\n\nThey both hope that Jeffrey Dean Morgan comes back for at least the series finale.\n\nJared gave both A Dog’s Life Rescue and Doctors Without Borders a shout out. He talked about he liked being able to use his celebrity status to do something good. (Love that boy.)\n\nJensen told us that he currently does not own a car. He joked about the only car he drives is the Impala!\n\nJared would love to have a Supernatural episode that is modeled after The Twilight Zone.\n\nAs for fears? Jared does not like bears and Jensen does not like snakes.\n\nA fan asked if they had ever read a script and asked themselves how they could mentally/physically shoot an episode. “All the time!” they exclaimed. The further explained that during “The French Mistake” they tried not to break from being “Sam” and “Dean,” even when they were “Jensen” and “Jared.”\n\nAnother fan asked about which scene in all 7 seasons of Supernatural was the hardest to shoot. Jared’s answer? The original Lucifer in a white suit scene. Jensen? “All of season 4!”\n\nWhen asked about one of their favorite moments over all the years of filming, Jared talked about a special moment at the end of season one that illustrates how close of friends these guys have been since the start of the show. He talked about how at the end of filming season one, they did not know if the show was being renewed. After they wrapped on the final day of filming, he fondly remembered just hanging out with Jensen and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the Impala with some beers. Jared described the final day of filming each season as ‘magical.’ Jensen agreed. He said the greatest moments are the ones off-camera, like pranks, etc. So awesome for two guys who work so damn hard.\n\nAnother sweet moment during their panel was when Jensen and Jared were asked how they were similar to the characters they play. Jared responded, “We both care a lot about our family.” 🙂\n\nAnd finally, congratulations to the guys on raising $3,500 for Once Upon A Cure by auctioning off a unique set piece!\n\nWait!! Hold on for the ride and don’t go anywhere! Just because I’ve covered Jensen and Jared’s appearances does not mean I’m done just yet! We have two panels left to cover!\n\nRichard Speight, Jr. was back for a solo panel on stage! He’s easily a fan favorite and deserved a little extra time with convention attendees.\n\nHe started out with, “Happy (Canadian) Thanksgiving! What a better way to bond with your family than to go to a Supernatural convention! (Hilarious right from the get go!)\n\nAnother memorable quote from Richard was: “Changing Channels” was probably my favorite episode of television I’ve ever filmed!” (Awesome.)\n\nI cannot leave out this memorable quote, “If there were ever a musical episode of Supernatural, Michael and Gabriel would do a karaoke duet!” (Can you imagine?!)\n\nWhen asked who he’d most like to be stuck in an elevator with, he stated that Katherine Boecher (“Lilith”) was his preference. “She seems crazy fun.” Then he changed his mind. “Jared – he could just take his hand and pop the thing open!”\n\nOne of his absolute favorite episodes of Supernatural (that he’s not in) is “Swan Song.” (Excellent choice.)\n\nCheck out his new movie called “Three Blind Saints.” It is coming out in November. He said it’s family-friendly / squeaky-clean, but he’s the lead!\n\nHis character’s name in the film? “Sam!”\n\nLastly, of course he’d love to see “The Trickster” come back!\n\nJulian Richings (“Death”) was the last, but not least, guest of the Supernatural convention.\n\nHe was yet another actor who was attending a convention for the very first time. He seemed genuinely excited and honored to be a part of the event.\n\nHe was born in England but lives in Toronto, where his wife is from.\n\nHe comes from a theatre background.\n\nJulian stated the hardest Supernatural scene to shoot was actually the first one he shot. It was the scene where Death was eating pizza with Dean. He quickly realized that he ate too much too fast, and with so many shots to get, he needed to slow down!\n\nHis favorite scene was the opening scene he was in – the introduction of “Death” to the song “Oh Death.” Julian stated, “Those creative choices make the series so much better than so many others. (Well-said, Julian. It’s SUCH a haunting scene and yes, this show is THE BEST!)\n\nSpeaking of junk food, a few of his favorites are Mars Bars, Poutine and Butter Tarts.\n\nHe complimented the Supernatural writers as well as Jensen. “He’s so generous as an actor.”\n\nCheck him out in “Wrong Turn.”\n\nHe does hope to be back on Supernatural.\n\nHe described “Death” as someone who is a bit misunderstood. He said, “I don’t think he’s just a scolding uncle. I think he’s drawn to the brothers. I think he cares for them.”\n\nOther cool news: Julian is shooting the new Superman movie!\n\nUK fans, you can catch him next at Asylum later this month.\n\nOK, that’s it for me folks. I hope you got through all this and has as much fun reading as I did writing! 🙂"
