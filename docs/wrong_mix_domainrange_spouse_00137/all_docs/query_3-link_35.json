The Maimonides Society provides a unique opportunity to form a collegial atmosphere and networking and integrates medical and Jewish concerns to demonstrate the contributions health professionals can make to support the Jewish community. Throughout the year, the Maimonides Society offers educational speaker panel events targeted specifically to healthcare providers.\n\nThe Maimonides Society is named in memory of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon -- Maimonides -- also known as Rambam. Maimonides was born in Spain in 1135 and died in Egypt in 1204. He was a renowned philosopher, Jewish community leader, and physician, that pressed the importance of a person’s sole duty to adhere to a healthy lifestyle to prevent disease.\n\nMaimonides' medical works included commentaries on the work of Hippocrates and Galen, \"The Medical Amorphisms”, treatises on asthma, impotence, poisons, and hemorrhoids.

Considering the high prevalence of obesity in Orange County and in the Middletown community, the promotion of healthy habits is very important.
