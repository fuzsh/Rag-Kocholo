        "text": "The Rural Diaries: Love, Livestock, and Big Life Lessons Down on Mischief Farm, by Hilarie Burton\n\nHilarie Burton Morgan has penned the perfect love letter that every woman needs, ‘The Rural Diaries.’ She says it is to a town, to a man, and to a farm but that would be selling it short. As a mother and woman, it is a heart-string just for us.\n\nYou may remember, Hilarie Burton, from One Tree Hill or lately Hallmark Christmas. She recently married Jeffrey Dean Morgan and they share two children and numerous livestock. Even still, you may wonder what a 37 year-old could possibly have to say. Well, it turns out quite a lot.\n\nHers is a story of more than an actress turned farmer. It is that of a woman finding her path and her strength. Hilarie shares her agrarian triumphs as well as her tragically relatable story of infertility and being a young woman during a time when women were taught to go along and just be one of the guys. It is about finding strength in the vulnerability of needing others – a partner, a family, a home. About thriving with fierce independence cocooned in the support of your community. A community that you curate and build, become a part of and invest in.\n\nSeveral things happened as I read, ‘The Rural Diaries.’ The first is that more than once I was brought to tears. By the halfway point my husband was more than a little concerned that I found so many affordable farms only an hour away. And, lastly, I developed a great appreciation for another woman and mom who is not just raising her kids, running a business and farm, not to mention donating time and money to people who need it, but being the kind of woman that other women need.\n\nWomen need to know that other women are having the same experiences. It builds our community. It makes us feel part of something and less that we are doing all these things alone. So, ‘The Rural Diaries’ is not just a book about an actress and a farm. It is a narrative about love, relationships, risk & reward, infertility, community, and that alpacas have the best poop for manure.\n\nVisit the Morgans’ Rhinebeck\n\nAs you read, you will no-doubt fall in love with Rhinebeck, NY as though it were a living character. From the charming old stores to the annual Sinterklaas Festival you will want to stroll the streets and see the high points. We have made that easy to do. Check out the places mentioned in Hilarie Burton Morgan’s, The Rural Diaries, below and use Google to take a tour.\n\nReady to Make a Little Mischief?\n\nOne of the best things about Houston is all the wide-open spaces. Within an hour you can be in the country. Even better? The country is pretty affordable. If Hilarie Burton Morgan has inspired you to make a change here are some pretty cool options available right now!\n\nHilarie and Jeffrey Morgan started out their life in Rhinebeck, NY in what they often called ‘The Cabin.’ It was on fewer acres and was a cozy home that needed a lot of work.\n\nIf you are looking for a baby step this house in Burton, TX is ringing the cabin bells! And, come on! It’s in Burton.\n\n‘The Cabin’\n\nYour Community: Brenham\n\n1 hour or less toâ€¦.Cypress, Katy, College Station,\n\nHow Much Mischief: A Lot â€“ this is your starter â€œCabinâ€, 15 acres, 4/3 log house, pond, workshop, horse barn\n\nCost: $475,000\n\n‘The Farm’\n\nYour Community: New Ulm, Bellville\n\n1 hour or less toâ€¦.Cypress, Katy, Energy Corridor,\n\nHow Much Mischief: A Lot â€“ this is about as close to Mischief Farm as you will find within an hour of The Greater Houston Area, 66 acres, large 8/5 farmhouse, raised garden beds, pond, trails, workshop, and horse barn\n\nCost: $1,075,000\n\nRunners Up"
