Prior to the creation of the Australian honours system members of Australian police forces were acknowledged by Imperial awards:

Queen’s Police Medal for Gallantry (awarded posthumously)

Queen’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service

Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal

In 1986 a distinctly Australian award, the Australian Police Medal, was created. The medal gives special recognition to members of Australian police forces for commendable service.

The Australian Police Medal was established on 3 March 1986 by Letters Patent.

The Governor-General awards the Australian Police Medal on the recommendation of the responsible Commonwealth, state and territory ministers.

Each Australian police force may award one Australian Police Medal for every 1000 members, or part of 1000 members, in each calendar year.

Only one award can be made to an individual. Recipients are entitled to the post-nominal APM.

The Australian Police Medal is announced on Australia Day (January 26) and the Queen’s Birthday (June) of each year
