Paul Stephenson, chief constable of Lancashire, was yesterday named new deputy commissioner of The Met by the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Authority.

He will leave the Lancashire force after more than two years as chief constable.

Mr Stephenson, 51, who began his police career at Lancashire Constabulary in 1975, has had a varied working life including a secondment as a sub-divisional commander in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and five years as assistant chief constable with Merseyside Police.

He is expected to take over the job from current post holder, Sir Ian Blair, in the next three months.

He said: "The Met is perhaps the most famous police service in the world and the job is one of the very few that could have tempted me away from what I am doing now."

Mr Stephenson was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in May 2000 and represents the Association of Chief Police Officers as head of their Crime Business sector.

During his post he has been responsible for more than 5,600 staff, across six divisions, handling a budget of Â£230million and providing a police service to 1.5million Lancashire residents. He said: "I will leave Lancashire with a heavy heart.

"When I was appointed as chief constable I said it was one of the proudest days of my life and that feeling remains.

"I am immensely proud of what Lancashire's officers and staff have achieved and I know they will continue to deliver quality services in the future." Mr Stephenson is expected to leave in April.
