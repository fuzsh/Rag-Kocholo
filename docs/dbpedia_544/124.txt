He stayed in the shadows as Sir Ian Blair limped from blunder to blunder at the helm of Scotland Yard.

Highly respected by officers and politicians alike, Sir Paul Stephenson has made a success of his job as Deputy Commissioner and his judgment has never been called into question.

Last night, however, even his most loyal supporters were questioning whether he could survive this storm, with the row over the Damian Green affair dwarfing even Sir Ian's worst cock-ups.

One said: 'It could be the end for Sir Paul. All his chances have virtually been wiped out.'

Sir Paul, who was brought up in the Lancashire town of Bacup, rapidly rose through the ranks during stints in Northern Ireland, Merseyside and Lancashire.

As with all senior officers he has tried his hand at a huge variety of policing areas from countering corruption to gun crime and terrorism.

He was awarded the Queen's Policing Medal in May 2000 and received a knighthood in the Birthday Honours List in June.

He is also renowned in the police service for his allyearround suntan, earning him the nickname 'Rusty'. The big question is whether he can stand the heat any longer.
