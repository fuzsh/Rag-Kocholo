        "text": "History\n\nThe Queen's Police Medal was established in 1954 alongside the Queen's Fire Service Medal to replace the King's Police and Fire Services Medal.\n\nIt is awarded to members of British and Commonwealth police forces in recognition of gallantry and distinguished service. Bar clasps may be awarded in recognition of additional acts of gallantry. Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters QPM.\n\nThere are two different versions of the medal that differ in reverse inscription, although the Silver Medal (for gallantry) has been effectively discontinued since 1977 when it became possible to award the George Medal posthumously. All medals are issued named.\n\nAn additional model of the King’s Police and Fire Services Medal was created specifically for South Africans on September 24, 1937. The Queen’s Police Medal continued to be awarded to South African police forces in this way until these versions were discontinued in 1969.\n\nThere may be additional versions that differ in size."
