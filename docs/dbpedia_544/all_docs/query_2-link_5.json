        "text": "Honours are just one of the awards that an individual can receive. Medals and awards are given for different types of service, depending on the contribution that the person or organisation has given.\n\nKing’s Award for Voluntary Service\n\nKing’s Award for Enterprise\n\nKing’s Medals\n\nKing’s Ambulance Service Medal\n\nKing’s Fire Service Medal\n\nKing’s Police Medal\n\nPoints of Light\n\nKing’s Award for Voluntary Service\n\nThe King’s Award for Voluntary Service is the highest award given to local volunteer groups across the UK to recognise outstanding work done in their own communities. It is a national Honour, equivalent to an MBE, and was created in 2002 to celebrate the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth’s coronation.\n\nAny volunteer group that provides a social, economic or environmental service to the local community can be nominated for the award. Each group is assessed on the leadership and drive shown by the volunteers, the benefit it brings to the local community and its standing within that community.\n\nKing’s Award for Enterprise\n\nThe King’s Awards for Enterprise awards are for outstanding achievement by UK businesses. There are four categories that businesses can be recognised for which includes innovation, international trade, sustainable development and promoting opportunity through social mobility.\n\nKing’s Medals\n\nThere are three medals which can be awarded to those public servants working in the UK’s fire and rescue, police and ambulance services. The medals for police officers and firefighters working in England are administered by the Home Office. The medals for members of the ambulance service working in England are processed by the Department for Health and Social Care.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office oversees the medals process in the UK’s Overseas Territories. The lists are published at the same time at the King’s Birthday and New Year Honours Lists.\n\nKing’s Ambulance Service Medal\n\nThe King’s Ambulance Service Medal was introduced in 2011. It is generally awarded to members of the ambulance service who have completed over 10 years good conduct and exemplary service. The recipients of the medal have given service, which is characterised by exceptional devotion to duty, including service marked by outstanding ability, merit and exemplary conduct.\n\nThe King’s Ambulance Service Medal for distinguished service is awarded to exemplary members of the ambulance service in all four nations and the Channel Islands twice a year. Find out more about eligibility and how to nominate. The medal is awarded by the Department for Health and Social Care on behalf of The King.\n\nKing’s Fire Service Medal\n\nThe King’s Fire Service Medal is awarded to members of the fire services across the United Kingdom. It was introduced in 1954 along with the King’s Police Medal. Recipients of the medal are awarded for distinguished service and the exhibition of conspicuous devotion to duty. This medal not only recognises the service of staff over a period of exemplary service but also recognises the efforts of those who have dealt with serious or widespread outbreaks of fire, along with other serious public catastrophes in more recent times.\n\nThe medal is awarded by the Home Office on behalf of The King to members of the fire service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service award the medal to members of the Scottish Fire Service via the Scottish Government on behalf of The King.\n\nKing’s Police Medal\n\nThe King’s Police Medal is awarded to members of the police service in all four nations of the United Kingdom for a specially distinguished record in police specific services of conspicuous merit, along with special services to Royalty, Heads of States and valuable political and secret services.\n\nThe medal is awarded by the Home Office on behalf of The King.\n\nPoints of Light"
