        "text": "PARIS — Winning back-to-back Olympic golds was almost overwhelming for Keegan Palmer, with legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk praising his work and Snoop Dogg in the bowl at the Paris Games watching.\n\n“Wild, crazy feeling dude!” Palmer said Wednesday after defending the park title he won in Tokyo three years ago. “To be able to say I’m a two-time Olympian, let alone two-time Olympic gold medalist, is a crazy, crazy feeling. I literally can’t believe it.”\n\nThe 21-year-old skateboarder from Australia's Gold Coast scored a 93.11 to secure his second gold medal.\n\nHis performance wowed a crowd that included Hawk, Snoop Dogg and U.S. basketball star Devin Booker. Palmer seemed almost as excited about Snoop Dogg being in the stadium as he did about the hardware draped around his neck.\n\n“I saw him after I landed my first run,\" he said, \"I pulled out my camera and had to start filming him.”\n\nPalmer led in the prelims Wednesday and then throughout the finals after posting the top score on the first of his three runs.\n\nHe'd already secured the victory before his final run and fell after also crashing on his second run. But his magnificent first run was all he needed to go home with another gold medal.\n\nAmerican Tom Schaar posted a 92.23 on his second run to win silver. He opened the finals with a 90.11 before completing more difficult tricks on his next go to secure second place.\n\nSchaar, who is good friends with Palmer, enjoyed the camaraderie of the final.\n\n“Loved just being able to skate with my friends,” Schaar said. “That’s what we do back home and that’s what skateboarding is supposed to be about.”\n\nBrazil’s Augusto Akio won bronze with a score of 91.85 on his final run. He entertained the crowd by juggling before the prelims and did another routine after the first round while holding his skateboard in his mouth.\n\nHe narrowly held off his teammate Pedro Barros, who scored 91.65 to finish fourth.\n\nHawk, one of the sport's greatest pioneers and the first to land the aerial 900-degree maneuver, raved about Palmer's skills.\n\n“He can do the hardest vertical moves on smaller transitions,” he said. “And what I like about him is that he is taking the most technical vert moves and doing them in this setting because I feel like vert is really missing from these Games as a discipline and Keegan brings the Vert. So does Tom.”\n\nPalmer beamed when told of that assessment.\n\n“We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Tony,” he said. “Some of my tricks on my run Tony invented. We wouldn’t have events in skateboarding like this if Tony never did that 900 back in the day and he just exploded skateboarding for us. We owe a lot to him.\"\n\nAmerican Tate Carew, who entered the competition at No. 1 in the World Skate rankings, finished fifth with a 91.17. It appeared as if he'd beat that score and get onto the podium on his third run, but he fell with 14 seconds left to end his day.\n\nItaly’s Alex Sorgente was sixth at 84.26, Brazil’s Luigi Cini got seventh with a 76.89 and Australia’s Keefer Wilson was eighth with a 58.36.\n\nAmerican Gavin Bottger, who won gold at last year’s World Skateboarding Championship, was eliminated after finishing 10th in the prelims with a score of 86.95.\n\nOthers who failed to make the finals were 51-year-old Andy Macdonald and 49-year-old South African Dallas Oberholzer.\n\nMacdonald made history as the oldest skateboarder to compete in the Olympics. He and Oberholzer are the older guys in a competition where the youngest entrant is 16-year-old Viktor Solmunde of Denmark.\n\nMacdonald finished 18th with a score of 77.66 and Oberholzer was last with a 33.83. He also finished last in Tokyo.\n\n“People are like: ‘Are you going for the gold?’ And I’m like: If they’re giving away gold medals for whoever has the most fun, I got it wrapped up,\" Macdonald said. \"I definitely won the gold medal for most fun.”\n\nPalmer's victory gave Australia its second skateboarding gold in as many days after 14-year-old Arisa Trew won the women’s park event, becoming the country's youngest ever Olympic champion.\n\n“We’re the king and queen of skateboarding park right now,” Palmer said. “And we both grew up in the same town, so Gold Coast is holding it down right now.”\n\n___"
