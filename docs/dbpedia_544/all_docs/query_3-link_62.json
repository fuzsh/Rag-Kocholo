        "text": "By JENNA FRYER\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nPARIS — Simone Biles wrapped up her final day of the Paris Olympic s with more hardware for the greatest gymnast of her generation.\n\nThe woman who didn’t think she’d even be here a couple years ago will leave Paris — and perhaps her final Olympics — with three golds and a silver, earned Monday when she placed second in the floor exercise.\n\nIt marked the first time in her career that Biles did not win the floor exercise at a major competition. She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers’ decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn’t ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nPole vault world record\n\nThe pole vaulter they call “Mondo” really can put on a show.\n\nWith the rest of the action at the Olympic track wrapped up for the evening and the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France still on their feet, Armand Duplantis rested the pole on his right shoulder and took a deep breath. Then, he lifted up that long piece of carbon fiber and took off down the runway and into the night sky.\n\nAnother Olympic gold medal already was his. When he came crashing down into the padding on the other side of that sky-high, pink-tinted bar, so was another world record.\n\nDuplantis, the Louisiana-born 24-year-old who competes for his mother’s native Sweden, cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to break the world record for the ninth time — but the first time on his sport’s grandest stage.\n\nHis next move was a sprint to the stands to hug his girlfriend and celebrate his record and second Olympic gold with all those friends and family wearing yellow and blue. The country’s king and queen were on hand, as well, to witness Sweden’s latest history-making leap into the pole vault pit.\n\n“It’s hard to understand, honestly,” he said. “If I don’t beat this moment in my career, then I’m pretty OK with that. I don’t think you can get much better than what just happened.”\n\nIt felt only right that the Duplantis drama came with Noah Lyles in the building.\n\nA night after the American sprint star electrified track with a .005-second victory in the men’s 100 meters, Lyles was on hand to receive his gold medal and watch Duplantis electrify field to the tune of 6.25 meters — about the height of a typical two-story building.\n\nThe drama played out over a half hour at the end of the night, long after a slow-and-strange women’s 5,000 meters had wrapped up and after Keely Hodgkinson had captured the first track medal for Britain at this meet in the 800, the evening’s last race.\n\nThat usually signals a time for folks to start heading for the exits.\n\nBut Mondo’s encore was worth staying for, and most everyone did.\n\n“Mondo is an extraordinary jumper because of four factors,” said American Sam Kendricks, who finished second. “One, he’s got a great coach for a long time. He’s had a lot of time to do it. He’s got great equipment and understanding of the event. He’s a fan of sport, and he’s got God’s hand on his back.”\n\nBy winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time — each time by one centimeter — Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.\n\nDuplantis is in the conversation with America’s Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist in shot put, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.\n\nAnd when it comes to delivering great theatre, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.\n\nAfter he sealed the victory over Kendricks, then captured the Olympic record by clearing 6.10 meters, Duplantis had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height.\n\nFollowing his first miss, he used a break while Lyles was receiving t he gold medal for his 100-meter victory, to study video on a tablet with his parents, who met decades ago while they were both on the LSU track and field team.\n\nAnother miss ensued, then another long break.\n\nThe fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song “Alleur de Feu” — “Light the Fire” — getting ready for Mondo’s leap into history.\n\nA home-grown talent, Duplantis learned this sport on a pole vault pit his parents dug in their back yard in Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\nDuring long afternoons of jumping in that pit, Duplantis often envisioned himself going for a world record on his last jump at the Olympics.\n\nMaybe not in the equation — the parties that world record and Olympic title would set off. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song “Dancing Queen” by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.\n\n“For it to actually happen the way that it did and for me to put the right jump together at the right time, it’s just, like, how do you explain it?” he said. “It’s bigger than words for me.”\n\nChebet of Kenya wins wild women’s 5,000 meters\n\nDuplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000 meters. One of the world’s best distance runners, Chebet’s Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, ended up with silver, but only after winning an appeal of her initial disqualification for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay.\n\nThe appeal left Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands with the bronze medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games.\n\nLyles returns to the track\n\nLyles returned to the track the day after his memorable win in the 100 meters to start the quest for his second gold, this one in the 200.\n\nHe won his opening heat in 20.19 seconds, then stuck around to receive his gold medal.\n\nHe said he did it all on only a little more than 4 hours of sleep.\n\n“I had to stop watching the race,” he said of his decision to call it a night at 2:45 a.m. after his win. “Throughout the day, it’s kind of just been meandering trying to get the body started, jump starting it.”\n\nBack to back for US discus thrower Val Allman\n\nVal Allman won her second straight Olympic gold with a throw of 69.50 meters to easily top China’s Feng Bin.\n\nThe medals from Allman and Kendricks gave the U.S. 11 so far in the meet, including three golds.\n\nHodgkinson brings first gold of Olympic track to Britain\n\nKeely Hodgkinson captured Britain’s first gold medal of the track meet, winning the 800 meters in 1:56.72.\n\nThis gold goes with the silver she took behind Athing Mu in 2021. Mu did not qualify for the Olympics after getting tripped up during the U.S. trials.\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women’s quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men’s.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was “definitely a little heartbroken.”\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women’s gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium’s Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes — of the more than 100 who competed in the men’s and women’s races last Wednesday — became sick in the following days, though it’s unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men’s soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco.\n\nSpain will face host France in the final on Friday. France advanced with a 3-1 victory over Egypt in the second semifinal.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament’s leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder’s fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez’s assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women’s team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women’s team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation’s first medal inside the Vélodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event’s debut in 2008."
