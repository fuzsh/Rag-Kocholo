        "text": "For those who are following the ongoing George Zimmerman trial, you might have noticed the female police officer on the stand who was wearing some DoD ribbons above her right beast pocket. It seems the Sanford, Florida, Police Department merely went out to a surplus store and bought DoD ribbons to use for their own award system. Well it was noticed by veterans watching the trial and the custom calls into question the practice by police departments in general. Here is a story on the matter in the Military Times.\n\nhttp://blogs.militarytimes.com/battle-r … ents-call/\n\nI don’t have a problem with them using DOD ribbons if they are from the follow categories.\n\n1.) Ribbons no longer being awarded such as pre WW 2 service/ campaign medals, Marine Brevet Medal, Certificate of Merit, Navy Reserve Special Commendation, Marine reserve ribbon, etc…, basically one were their is no living holders of the award.\n\n2.) Ribbons that because of the color arrangement that can only be wore correctly one way. These ribbons are Medal of Honor, Navy/Marine Corp & Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbons, Air Force Combat Action Medal, D.o.T. 9-11 Medal, Navy/ Marine Corp Presidental Unit Citiation, Civil War Medal, NC-4 Medal, The 3 WW2 Campaign Medals, Army of the Occupation Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, D.o.T. 9-11 Award Ribbon. If the ribbon was reversed and the color in a different order, it can be used for a different award.\n\n3.) changing the color set up.\n\nI disagree with that suggestion. Anyone who’s ever been in the service knows full well that there are always some guys (and gals) who manage to get their ribbons on upside down or backwards. I remember years ago telling someone their WWII campaign ribbon was on backwards, but when he looked down at the ribbon on his uniform, he said no, the red was on the right side. Of course it was, looking down at it, but it was backwards to anyone else looking at his ribbons standing in front of him\n\nNo one should use any military award for any purpose, whether an obsolete award or not. The award is still an authorized award and it’s always possible it could be reinstated one day…especially the way current US awards are being handed out.\n\nWhilst not as fractionated as the US system, UK law enforcement is at a regional level without an over-arching ‘national’ police force… and yet, probably due to regarding HM The Queen as the fount of all honours, we have ‘national’ police awards in the shape of the Queen’s Police Medal for Gallantry, Queen’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service, and the Police Long Service & Good Conduct Medal. UK police officers are also eligible for civilian gallantry awards – the George Cross and George Medal – and may be appointed to the Order of the British Empire for meritorious service (particularly in senior ranks).\n\nAll UK police officers with 5 years’ service on the qualifying date have received the Queen’s Golden and Diamond Jubilee Medals as well.\n\nMegan\n\nhttp://www.medals.org.uk/\n\nI am the head of our county fire service award system. We use medals and bars from http://www.nationalmedalofhonor.com\n\nWe have found them to be a great company to deal with. The only thing we off is that a couple of their ribbons on the medals are a different than the citation bar. We would also like to have miniatures but they do not carry them.\n\nWe have absolutely lost our collective mind on the subject of medals and ribbons. The government seems to be striving for one new medal every day, without regard to need or utility. Non-governmental agencies jump on the bandwagon to repurpose all the ribbons. And, individuals take it upon themselves to be the sole judge of who has earned the right to wear a piece of colored cloth.\n\nSooner or later, the government will award everyone who served a Medal of Honor. Lest their self-esteem suffer, those who never served also will be awarded Medals of Honor. In fact, eveyone who ever lived will be retroactively awarded a Medal of Honor. Then, since each of us will be the sole arbiter of who \"earned\" the Medal of Honor, there will be a billion blogs devoted solely to moaning about some putz wearing a piece of cloth that looks ominously like a piece of cloth I wear (of course mine was truly earned, while his came up with the rations).\n\nI’d suggest some simple steps: (1) the government (at every level) needs to step back from the blizzard of useless and meaningless awards. Take a year off and see if civilization as we know it survives. (2) Non-governmental agencies need to return to their basic missions and stop dressing up their employees like electrified Christmas trees. And (3), individuals who get wrapped around the axle on this silliness need to get a life, get a grip and get a clue."
