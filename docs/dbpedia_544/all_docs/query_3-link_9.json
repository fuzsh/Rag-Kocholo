        "text": "We custom make each and every Frame, Mounting, Medal Naming and Military Display Framing order specifically for you.\n\nCustom Made Frames to your specification take approx 28 days. Medal mounting currently has a turnaround of approx 6 weeks.\n\nIf you have any questions around timing please contact our helpful staff before you place your order. Non-customised stock items are generally dispatched within a few days - if an item is out of stock or requires some production work prior to dispatch, you will receive an email notification to that effect. You will receive a shipping confirmation once your order has been dispatched.\n\nAll replica medals, medal mounting, and military framing orders are shipped using either Royal Mail or DPD. You will receive a system-generated email once your order has been dispatched; this email will contain tracking information only if you have selected and paid for a Special Delivery service.\n\nDispatch emails are automatic and sent to the email address supplied when placing your order. If you have not received a shipping email, please be sure to check and 'junk' or 'spam' folders. Once your dispatch email has been received, your order should arrive within 2 working days.\n\n'Medal Mounting Options' refers to the ready to wear mounting service for all medals. By default, most medals are supplied on a loose piece of medal ribbon. If you would like your medal to be able to be pinned on to a garment for wearing, you will need to select the relevant option on each medal page. Our team of tailors work tirelessly to mount medals court or swing style to the exacting standards required by our British Armed Forces.\n\nOn a loose ribbon - medals will be supplied on a 6 inch length of loose ribbon.\n\nSwing Mounting - medals are sewn onto a brooch bar and swing freely from the bar ready to wear. This method of mounting is typically used for mounting World War 1 & World War 2 medals. Please not that mounting charges are PER MEDAL.\n\nCourt Mounting - medals are sewn to a back board of corresponding ribbons with a pin brooch across top and held rigid so not to swing and hit against each other. This is the method of mounted adopted by todays armed forces. Please not that mounting charges are PER MEDAL.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are purchasing medals to be added to an existing group of medals that you are planning to send to us, you will need to head over to the medal mounting page and include the mounting charge for the TOTAL number of medals that are being mounted. So, if you are buying one medal to be added to a group of three medals that you already have mounted, you will need to pay for a total of 4 medals to be mounted. We cannot simply add medals to a group.\n\nPlease contact us for any further information you require or visit our Medal Mounting collection here.\n\nMany items that we supply will offer engraving options. Here is some guidance regarding this service.\n\nMedal Engraving:\n\nMedal engraving (often referred to as 'Medal Naming') is the process of engraving personal details on the edge, back or bar of a medal. For military medals details are typically formatted as follows:\n\nFor civilian medals, typically the first name and surname would be engraved in full. It is important to note the some medals engraved on the reverse - this applied mainly to commemorative medals. This is not an option that you choose - this is determined by the issuer or protocol.\n\nPlaque Engraving:\n\nIf your order includes one of our plaques or a frame/case with a plaque, please complete the details that you would like engraving in full. If there is any limit or restriction on the number of characters you can have, this will be stated in the description of the product. For plaque engraving, text across two lines is (in our opinion) the most visually appealing.\n\nOther Product Engraving:\n\nThe engraving requirements for all of our products can be added to the individual product page when placing your order. If you are requiring a military emblem engraved, please state this clearly. If we run into any issues, we will contact you when you order reaches the production stage.\n\nIf you have a specific badge or logo to engrave, you can send it to info@empiremedals.com"
