Bushey, Jr. ’73\n\nChuck Bushey is a worldwide consultant for wildfires, recognized as a leader on how to fight them and how to prevent them in the first place.

He holds a master’s degree from Southern Illinois University and has authored more than 50 publications and reports.\n\nWildfires have grown to be an even larger issue than they were when Smokey the Bear ads ran regularly on TV, with more large fires, more extreme fire behavior and more acres burned annually on average. Helping us fight them and prevent them since he graduated from Monmouth College a half century ago has been Chuck Bushey.\n\nDo you know a proud Scot who deserves to be recognized?
