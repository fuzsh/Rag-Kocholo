        "text": "For thousands of race campaigners around the world, August 28, 1963 is marked down as one of the most important days in history.\n\nOn that day, Martin Luther King stood at the Lincoln Memorial before a crowd of 250,000 and delivered his now-famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech.\n\nBut that day also marked the day three Bristol men changed the course of history in the UK.\n\nPaul Stephenson, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey led the Bristol Bus Boycott throughout the summer of 1963. After four months of hard campaigning, the Bristol Omnibus Company caved in and agreed there would be no more discrimination in its crews.\n\nIt would become a landmark moment and set the stones turning for Britain’s first Race Relations Act in 1965, which made racial discrimination unlawful in public places.\n\nPaul Stephenson, the youth worker who came to Bristol and led the boycott, is set to be given a Lifetime Achievement award at this year’s Pride of Britain Awards, organised by the Mirror.\n\nOutside of Bristol, few know about how three men galvanised a city and sparked a revolution to rival Martin Luther King’s.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBristol in the early 1960s had thousands of residents of West Indian origin, who emigrated to Britain after the Second World War.\n\nBefore the act of law was passed, it was still legal in the UK to discriminate against someone because of the colour of their skin.\n\nThat was what happened when the Bristol Omnibus Company decided to run a colour bar, knowing they could not be prosecuted for doing so.\n\nBristol’s race bar stuck out like a sore thumb. In other places – Bath and London, for example – there were several non-white drivers and conductors.\n\nBut in Bristol, things came to a head when Guy tried to apply for a job as a bus driver, and was flatly refused to an interview because he was not white.\n\nThat proved a turning point. Together with several others, they formed the West Indian Development Council to lobby for rights.\n\nThey were galvanised by the arrival of a youth worker, called Paul Stephenson. Born to an African father and white British mother, he was a driving force behind the boycott to come.\n\nRecalling the year-long bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, he put the wheels in motion.\n\nThe colour bar was first questioned in the media by the Bristol Evening Post in 1961, in a series of articles in the paper.\n\nBack then, the general manager openly told the paper he would not hire any non-whites as drivers or conductors. He said it would downgrade the job, and drive existing staff away.\n\nThat was enough for Paul and the West Indian Development Council to take action. Holding a press conference on April 29, 1963, they gathered support from all around the country, including local MP Tony Benn and then Labour leader Harold Wilson.\n\nMr Wilson condemned the bus company, with several high-profile businessmen and sportsmen backing their action. They spoke out against the colour bar to reporters, and leaflets went out across the city.\n\nBristol grew into its protest. Supporters soon refused to use buses owned by the company. Marches were held across the city.\n\nStudents from Bristol University joined those protests, picketing the Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU) offices. Many blocked roads and sit-down protests in central Bristol were common sight. Everything was strictly non-violent.\n\nThe Evening Post and Western Daily Press ran a series of editorials, condemning the colour bar.\n\nBy the end of the summer, the TGWU had become isolated, and passengers were starting to voice their disapproval of the bus crews.\n\nOn August 27, a mass meeting of more than 500 bus workers was held. They fomally agreed to end the colour bar.\n\nThe next day, as Martin Luther King marched on Washington, the general manager of the Bristol Omnibus Company announced there would be no more discrimination.\n\nBy mid-September, Raghbir Singh became Bristol’s first non-white bus conductor. He would be joined by two Jamaican and two Pakistani men days later.\n\nToday, that story is barely heard outside Bristol. Ironically, their story is less well-known then that of slave trader Edward Colston.\n\nThe Race Relations Act in 1965 was brought in by Harold Wilson’s government, after he met with the three men several times.\n\nIt forbade discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins, and applied to both British residents and visitors to the UK in public places.\n\nThree years later, it expanded to include both employment and housing and in 1976, identified direct and indirect discrimination.\n\nIn 2009, Paul, Guy and Roy were finally recognised and given OBEs for their roles in changing the course of history."
