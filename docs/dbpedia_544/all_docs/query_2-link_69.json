        "text": "The King's Police Medal\n\nThe King's Police Medal was instituted on 7 July, 1909. It is made of silver.\n\nThe 36mm ribbon was originally deep blue with silver edges but in 1916, a central silver stripe was added. Gallantry awards have thin crimson stripes superimposed on the silver stripes.\n\nThe obverse of the medal has the monarch’s effigy. The reverse has a standing figure with a sword and shield inscribed to “GUARD MY PEOPLE”.\n\nThe first issue had a laurel spray on the exergue. In 1933, two separate reverses were introduced. The words “FOR GALLANTRY” or “FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE” were placed on the exergue.\n\nThe medal was originally instituted to reward “the courage and devotion to duty” in the police and fire services of the United Kingdom and Overseas Dominions. However, recognising the bravery of firemen during the Blitz, it was retitled the King's Police and Fire Service Medal in 1940 but no change was made to the medal itself.\n\nFrom 1950, the Gallantry medals were only awarded posthumously and all medals were discontinued in 1954 when separate awards were established for the two services.\n\n(The above is extracted from Medal Year Book, 2012, Token Publishing Ltd, Page 92.)\n\nPlease note that many of the images and biographical details in this section appear by kind permission of Ian Hall.\n\nTo see the section on the King's Police Medal for Gallantry, please click here.\n\nTo see the section on the King's Police Medal for Distinguished Conduct, please click here.\n\nTo see the City of Glasgow Police Museum website section for King's and Queen's Police Medals for Gallantry, please click here."
