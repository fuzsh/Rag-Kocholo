        "text": "We marked the 75th anniversary of the NHS by naming 800005 after Aneurin Bevan, the minister for health responsible for its launch.\n\nAneira Thomas – the first baby born on the NHS – unveiled the train during a special ceremony at Newport on 4 July 2023.\n\nWelsh Labour Party politician Aneurin Bevan was minister for health in Clement Attlee’s government and spearheaded the creation of the National Health Service.\n\nFollowing a train-naming ceremony in his honour, the Aneurin Bevan train operated a service from Newport to London Paddington, calling at Swindon to acknowledge the role the town’s railway industry played in the formation of the NHS.\n\nThe Great Western Railway Medical Fund Society (MFS) was formed in 1847 with money raised by direct deductions from the wages of colleagues at the GWR works in Swindon.\n\nOver the next 100 years the MFS developed a host of facilities – from washing baths to doctors and dental surgeries. Having visited the facilities in Swindon, it is reported that Bevan later remarked: “There it was, a complete health service. All we had to do was to expand it to embrace the whole country!”.\n\nAneira Thomas was born at one minute past midnight on 5 July 1948, making her the first NHS baby born and, to celebrate, her parents named her after the Welsh politician.\n\nAneira said: “This amazing train will forever be a reminder of the great man and the National Health Service that delivers with such skill, care and compassion. Happy 75th Birthday NHS, thank you GWR.”\n\nWorld War Two codebreaker Alan Turing was honoured during a ceremony at London Paddington on 26 May 2022.\n\nAlan’s nieces Janet Robinson and Inagh Payne officially named 800008 in his honour. The ceremony also saw the unveiling of GWR’s new ‘Trainbow’ livery celebrating the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nAlan Turing OBE\n\nAlan famously led a team in ‘Hut 8’ at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain’s codebreaking centre during the war.\n\nIn 1942 he and his team cracked the vitally important and most difficult German Naval Enigma. His work in the field of computer science was groundbreaking and paved the way for modern computing.\n\nAlan is also an admired role model within the LGBTQ+ community and his legacy has helped change social attitudes in Britain.\n\nAlthough laws during the 1950s made it illegal for him to be openly gay, Alan did not shy away from his sexuality. He was arrested for gross indecency which resulted in a sentence of chemical castration.\n\n2 years later Alan died of cyanide poisoning. Following the launch of an internet campaign in 2009, he was granted a posthumous royal pardon four years later. A subsequent legal amendment, known as ‘Turing’s Law’, pardoned 65,000 other convicted gay and bisexual men.\n\nInagh Payne, speaking on behalf of the family, said:\n\n“Alan was very special to us and we are so incredibly proud of everything he did. Despite not being fond of neither fuss nor social occasions, he would have been delighted to have a train named after him.\n\n“We have our own fond memories of him as a loving and caring uncle and it is wonderful to see this tribute to him, and that he is remembered, and his life celebrated by so many people.”\n\nTrainbow\n\n‘Trainbow’ was first unveiled in 2018 to support Pride events across the network and demonstrate GWR’s support for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIts livery has now been updated to include black, brown, light blue, light pink and white, bringing focus on inclusion for trans individuals, marginalised people of colour and those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nIntercity Express Train 800008 also pays a nod to the World War Two codebreakers and their mastery of palindromes. And, as you might expect with something related to Alan Turing, there is more to the design of the new livery than first meets the eye.\n\n800024 was named after HRH The Princess Royal in recognition of her support for more than 300 charities, organisations and military regiments in the UK and overseas.\n\nRepresentatives from a host of those organisations joined guests for a naming ceremony at London Paddington on 2 May 2024.\n\nHRH The Princess Royal\n\nHer Royal Highness was joined at Paddington by husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, a member of the GWR Advisory Board.\n\nAfter the unveiling, The Princess Royal was introduced to guests including the Secretary of State for Transport, Mark Harper MP, former Prime Minister Theresa May and Transport for London Commissioner Andrew Lord.\n\nMr Harper said: \"Her Royal Highness has made a significant contribution to so many important charities, events and public services so it gives me great pride to celebrate this through one of the greatest traditions on our railways.\"\n\nInspired by the heritage of GWR’s King George V locomotive, two sides of a coin appear on the side of our named Intercity Express Trains.\n\nWith the Coat of Arms of the GWR on one side of coin, the other includes an illustration of The Princess competing at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Seated on the Queen’s horse, Goodwill, Her Royal Highness was taking part in the equestrian three-day event – the first member of the Royal Family to feature in the Olympics.\n\n800025 pays tribute to Captain Sir Tom Moore and his remarkable fundraising achievements during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nIt was named in response to requests from both GWR colleagues and members of the public, re-entering service on Thursday 30 April 2020 – the date of Captain Sir Tom’s 100th birthday.\n\nPictured: Captain Sir Tom Moore completing laps in his garden\n\nCaptain Sir Tom captured the hearts of the nation during the Covid-19 crisis, raising more than £30 million for NHS Charities Together.\n\nThe Second World War veteran originally hoped to raise £1,000 before his 100th birthday, but his pledge to walk 100 laps of his garden went viral and more than one million people donated to his JustGiving page.\n\nCaptain Sir Tom’s fundraising feat was further boosted when his duet of You’ll Never Walk Alone, with musicals legend Michael Ball, reached No1.\n\nOriginally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, Captain Sir Tom joined the British Army in June 1940. His regiment – the 8th Battalion, the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment – trained in Wadebridge, Cornwall, tasked with coastal defence against a threatened German invasion. He later served on the frontline in Burma.\n\nCaptain Sir Tom completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop of his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, before his birthday on 30 April, leading to praise from the Royal Family, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other famous faces, as well as calls for him to be given a knighthood.\n\n800025 was updated to include ‘Sir’ following Captain Tom’s knighthood on 17 July 2020. He passed away on 2 February 2021, aged 100.\n\n800028 pays tribute to two Great Westerners who did so much for the North Cotswold railway route and the national rail system – Oliver Lovell and Sir Peter Parker.\n\nFamily, friends and former colleagues attended a ceremony at London Paddington on Thursday 30 November.\n\nOliver Lovell\n\nOliver was the founding chairman of the Cotswold Line Promotion Group, formed in March 1978 with the original purpose of opposing the possible closure of the line. He sat on the committee continuously until his sudden death in the summer of 2013. The new waiting room at Morton-in-Marsh was named in his honour in 2019.\n\nThe group has gone from strength to strength and helped with improvements along the line, including securing the reopening of Honeybourne station and financial contributions to Morton-in-Marsh and Hanborough station improvements.\n\nOliver’s sister, Diana Barr, said:\n\n\"It is an extremely proud moment for us and I know he would have been thrilled and honoured by this recognition.\"\n\nSir Peter Parker\n\nSir Peter was chairman of the British Railways Board from 1976 to 1983 and a powerful friend of the Cotswold Line, regularly using Charlbury station. He is remembered with deep affection for an effective management style which helped transform the reputation of Britain’s railways in the eyes of the public.\n\nLucy Parker, Sir Peter’s daughter, said:\n\n\"To have this train carrying his name as it travels along the tracks would have thrilled my father. He loved the people of the railway community and to be honoured in this way would have made him more proud than words can say.\"\n\nSomerset community heroes Christopher Dando and Evette Wakely travelled on 800029 after it was named in their honour at Taunton Station on 17 February 2022.\n\nCare home manager Christopher and fundraising postie Evette were named BBC Make a Difference Superstars for selflessly helping others at the height of the pandemic.\n\nPictured: Christopher Dando\n\nChristopher Dando\n\nChristopher, from Westbury-sub-Mendip, helped to ensure the safety of 23 residents at Court House Retirement Home in Cheddar by gathering a team of carers who voluntarily locked themselves into a safe bubble for the benefit of their residents.\n\nChristopher and eight colleagues moved into the home for 12 weeks, working round-the-clock to keep the pandemic at bay.\n\nChristopher, who went without seeing wife Alison and daughters Chloe and Edith, led by example, working in the kitchen, helping with personal care, emptying rubbish, cutting the grass and organising morale-boosting events for residents and staff.\n\nWells MP James Heappey said:\n\n“Many of us have lost loved ones and had to make sacrifices over these past couple of years, but it’s thanks to people like Christopher and his team who have managed to keep community spirits alive.”\n\nPictured: Evette Wakely\n\nEvette Wakely\n\nRoyal Mail worker Evette put a smile on residents’ faces by galvanizing a team of 12 fancy-dress colleagues to deliver the post and raise money for the Love Musgrove Covid-19 Response Fund, helping nurses and patients at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton. Within a month they had raised more than £5,000.\n\nShe also arranged for a convoy of Royal Mail vans to deliver a gift to a girl awaiting major heart surgery, as well as spearheading a fundraising month to raise £2,695 for the homeless and raising another £3,500 for St Margaret’s Hospice in Taunton.\n\nEvette also helped raise thousands of pounds for Elliot’s Touch, a charity in Watchet helping to fund research and find cures for Cardiomyopathy in Children and Mitochondrial Disease.\n\nTaunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow said:\n\n“It’s because of people like Evette that we’ve managed to get through these difficult couple of years, and it’s absolutely fitting that GWR and BBC Radio Somerset have honoured her in this way.”\n\nPictured: Evette Wakely with family\n\n802011 celebrates two of Plymouth’s most famous sons, explorer Capt Robert Falcon Scott and portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. It was named on 5 December 2018.\n\nCapt Scott’s name was later dedicated in a special ceremony at London Paddington on 22 April 2024, attended by Friends of the Scott Polar Research Institute, Scott’s grandchildren Falcon and Dafila, and legendary British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes.\n\nCapt Robert Falcon Scott\n\nBorn in Devonport, Plymouth, on June 6, 1868, Scott began a distinguished career in the Navy at 13 and a chance encounter with the president of the Royal Geographical Society led to him signing up for the British National Antarctic Expedition in 1901.\n\nImportant biological, geological and zoological findings led to it being hailed as one of the great polar expeditions and when the team returned home in 1904, Scott became a national and international hero. He was promoted to captain before King Edward VII bestowed on him the honour of Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.\n\nIn 1910, Scott set his sights on a return to the Antarctic on the now infamous Terra Nova Expedition, aiming to become the first to reach the South Pole.\n\nThwarted by misfortunes from the off, Scott and his team reached the Pole on January 7, 1912, only to discover that a Norwegian team had reached the same spot five weeks previously.\n\nDefeated, the team continued, but bad weather meant that, one-by-one, they succumbed to the elements. Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March, 1912.\n\nThe SPRI was founded in 1920 as a national memorial to Scott and his companions. It investigates issues relevant to the Arctic and Antarctic and is home to the Polar Museum in Cambridge. Prof Julian Dowdeswell, Emeritus Professor at the SPRI, said:\n\n“Captain Scott’s two expeditions laid many of the foundations for interdisciplinary science in Antarctica, a legacy that is particularly important in today’s rapidly changing climate. The Institute is delighted that Scott’s achievements continue to be recognised by the naming of a GWR train in his honour.”\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds\n\nSir Joshua was born at Plympton, Plymouth, on 16 July, 1723, the son of a headmaster and fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, providing him a more educated background than most painters of the time.\n\nThrough study of ancient and Italian Renaissance art, and that of Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dyck, Reynolds developed into one of the major European portrait painters of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1740 he was apprenticed to the fashionable London portraitist Thomas Hudson. He spent 1749-52 abroad, mainly in Italy, and set up practice in London shortly after his return.\n\nHe soon established himself as Britain’s leading portrait painter, though he was never popular with George III. When the Royal Academy of Arts was formed in 1768, Reynolds was elected its first President.\n\nAlthough believing that history painting was the noblest work of the painter, he had little opportunity to practise it, and his greatest works are his portraits.\n\nReynolds lost the sight of his left eye in 1789, forcing him into retirement. After a period of illness, he died on 23 February, 1792.\n\nA ceremony was held at Castle Cary station on 9 April 2019 to mark the naming of 802013 after Glastonbury Festival co-creator Michael Eavis.\n\nIt celebrates the special connection Great Western Railway enjoys with Glastonbury, taking thousands of music fans to Somerset for the festival year after year.\n\nEavis grew up at Worthy Farm and hosted the Pilton Pop Folk & Blues Festival in 1970 after being inspired by the performance of Led Zeppelin at the Bath Festival of Blues.\n\nThe following year a free festival, Glastonbury Fayre, again took place at Worthy Farm and this was to develop into the world-famous Glastonbury Festival.\n\nAfter welcoming 1,500 people in 1970, the festival now hosts 250,000 festival goers each year – a slender proportion of the more than three million people who register annually for tickets.\n\nIn 2010, the festival’s 40th year, Eavis appeared on the main stage with headline artist Stevie Wonder to sing the chorus of Happy Birthday. In 2016, at the age of 80, he accompanied Coldplay on stage in a rendition of My Way.\n\nEavis was awarded a CBE for services to music in 2007 and, in 2009, was nominated by Time magazine as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Glastonbury on 3 May, 2022.\n\nThe cast of her iconic murder mystery play, The Mousetrap, were at Paignton station to see 802110 named after best-selling author Dame Agatha Christie. Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, named the train during a special ceremony on 12 September 2023.\n\nWatch GWR stage train-naming ceremony for best-selling author Agatha Christie.\n\nBorn in Torquay, Christie was a writer during the ‘Golden Age of Detective Fiction’, amassing 66 novels and 14 short-story collections, leading her to be dubbed the ‘Queen of Crime’.\n\nAmong them was The Mousetrap, the world’s longest-running play, which celebrated its 70th year in 2023 with a national tour.\n\nThe cast of The Mousetrap broke off from rehearsals at Torquay’s Princess Theatre to join guests at Paignton station. Also in attendance was 103-year-old Joan Nott, a world-renowned expert on all things Agatha Christie.\n\nTorbay MP Kevin Foster said: “Agatha Christie’s legacy can be seen all over Torbay, with her stories still captivating audiences and readers worldwide. Given the role our railways played in her books and the special place Paignton was for her, it is apt Paignton station should be the location for this naming ceremony. Everywhere this train goes it will promote both her legacy and the English Riviera as a whole.”"
