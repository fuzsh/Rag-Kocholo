        "text": "2. Searching for official announcements\n\nAwards of medals were announced in the official government newspaper, the London Gazette, available on The Gazette website.\n\nCitations and recommendations are sometimes included in the Gazettes but are rarely found in the documents held at The National Archives.\n\nYou can use The Gazette’s own search tips for help with your searching.\n\n3. Searching for other records of medals and awards\n\nUse our catalogue to search for references to records of medals and awards. Very few of the records for civilian medals and awards are available online. To view most of these documents you will need to either visit The National Archives at Kew or pay for copies to be sent to you. Alternatively, you could pay for research.\n\nFor general tips on searching the catalogue, use the Discovery help page.\n\nThe records we hold of civilian medals and awards are incomplete, scattered and varied. The following search methods will cover most possibilities:\n\nTry a broad, speculative search across our whole catalogue using the medal name and/or the recipient’s name. For example, search for ’empire gallantry medal AND smith’ or ‘edward medal AND thomas brown’. You may need to use abbreviations for medals – so, for example, to search for the George Cross you may need to enter GC as your keyword. Try searching in both ways.\n\nTarget your search to a specific department or series within our catalogue. Consult sections 4 to 9 in this guide to find catalogue references to departments (such as HO for Home Office or BT for Board of Trade) or series (such as HO 144 or BT 261) that contain records of specific kinds of medals and awards, then either:\n\nUse the advanced search option in our catalogue to search within a department or series using the search criteria specified for each series in sections 4 to 9\n\nClick on any catalogue reference link in sections 4 to 9 and use the ‘series search’ box to search using a type of medal or a person’s name or other keywords\n\nBrowse through a series by clicking on the catalogue reference link and scrolling down to “Browse by Reference”\n\nSearch Home Office registered papers 1839-1979 in series HO 45. Use the advanced search in our catalogue, specifying HO 45 in the references box, or use the series search in the HO 45 series description, to search by name, though you may need to include either the word ‘award’ or ‘medal’.\n\n4. Civilian gallantry medals\n\n4.1 Types of medals\n\nThe main civilian gallantry medals in the 19th and early 20th centuries were:\n\nAlbert Medal – for merchant seamen, the Royal Navy and later firemen, miners, railwaymen, the army, and others\n\nEdward Medal – for miners, quarrymen and later dock workers and railwaymen\n\nSea Gallantry Medal – for merchant seamen\n\nEmpire Gallantry Medal – from 1922 for meritorious service – primarily for civilians but also for the military in certain circumstances\n\nBritish Empire Medal – from 1922 for meritorious service – primarily for civilians but also for the military in certain circumstances\n\nGeorge Cross – from 1940 for meritorious service, replacing the Empire Gallantry Medal and later the Edward Medal and Albert Medal – primarily for civilians but also for the military in certain circumstances\n\nGeorge Medal – from 1940 for meritorious service – primarily for civilians but also for the military in certain circumstances\n\nQueen’s Gallantry Medal – from 1974 for meritorious service\n\nIn addition, the following medals have been awarded specifically to police officers for gallantry:\n\nKing’s Police Medal (later the King’s Police and Fire Services Medal, and now the Queen’s Police Medal)\n\nConstabulary Medal (Ireland)\n\nAfrican Police Medal (later the Colonial Police Medal)\n\n4.2 Where to search for records\n\nThe table below refers to awards granted before the changes in the honours and awards system of 1993.

Honours Lists and other records of CBE, OBE and MBE\n\nSince the late 19th century the most significant announcements of gallantry awards have been the New Year and Birthday Honours Lists, sometimes known as the Half Yearly or Periodic Honours. Twice a year honours, including the CBE, OBE and MBE (Commander, Officer and Member of the Order of the British Empire), as well as knighthoods and damehoods, are bestowed upon individuals; New Year Honours are announced on 1 January and Birthday Honours on the monarch’s official birthday which, since 1908, has been the first, second or third Saturday in June.\n\nThe announcements are published in The London Gazette but do not normally include a citation, just the name of the recipient.\n\nRecords that provide the reasons why individuals were awarded honours (known as recommendations) are very scarce. Newspapers are generally a more reliable source. Search the British Newspaper Archive at the British Library.\n\nUse our catalogue to search for references to honours lists in one or more of the following ways:\n\nTry a broad, speculative search across our whole catalogue using combinations of ‘honours’, ‘award’ ‘birthday’ or ‘new year’ as your search terms\n\nClick on one of the two following record series and search using ‘honours’, ‘award’ ‘birthday’ or ‘new year’ as your search terms and enter a year or year range (even in these series recommendations or citations are rarely featured):\n\nPrime Minister’s Office Honours Lists and Papers 1915-1967 in series PREM 2\n\nSubmissions to the Prime Minister concerning Half Yearly Honours Lists 1936-1970 in series T 305, though these records are closed for 75 years from the date of their creation\n\nFor recent Honours Lists, from the last decade, go to the GOV.UK website.\n\n6.

Foreign awards and British awards to foreigners\n\nForeign awards and British awards to foreigners were handled by the Treaty Department of the Foreign Office but only a limited number of files survive.\n\nBefore 1906 – use the advanced search in our catalogue to search in FO 83, using ‘medals’ or ‘decorations’ as your search terms (you can also try searching with an individual’s name though many records are not searchable by name); alternatively, search using the search box in the FO 83 series description\n\nAfter 1906 – use the advanced search in our catalogue to search in FO 372, using ‘medals’, ‘awards’ or ‘honours’ as your search terms (you can also try searching with an individual’s name though many records are not searchable by name); alternatively, search using the search box in the FO 372 series description.\n\nFor 1906-1951, you may need to consult the Foreign Office indexes in FO 1111 (1906-1919) and FO 409 (1920-1959).
