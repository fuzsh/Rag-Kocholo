It is understood the four short-listed contenders were alerted by telephone that they would be called for interviews in January.\n\nThe post become vacant in October after the resignation of Sir Ian Blair who said he had decided to stand down due to political interference from the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The four will be interviewed by members of the Police Authority. Their recommendations will be made to the Home Office along with representations by Mr Johnson.\n\nHome Secretary Jacqui Smith will then interview one or two candidates before making a final recommendation to the Queen.\n\nSir Paul, who is married with no children, has overseen dramatic in-roads in the fight against crime with the number of offences the lowest for 18 years. He was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal in the 1997 New Year’s Honours List and was knighted in June 2007."
