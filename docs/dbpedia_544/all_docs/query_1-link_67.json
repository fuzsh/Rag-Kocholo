        "text": "On Friday 8 December 2017, some 60 members of UACES met at the British Academy to celebrate the association’s 50th birthday. Amongst those in attendance were Chairs past and present, Lifetime achievement award winners and previous Executive Directors. The evening was completed by a reading from Paul Stephenson who read several of his poems on the themes of education and Europe, plus an elegy written especially for the occasion: ‘An Ode to UACES’.\n\nAttendees were treated to music from City Strings Duo and speeches from UACES Honorary President Professor Dame Helen Wallace and Chair of the James Madison Charitable Trust, Terry Bishop. UACES is celebrating its 50th anniversary as the academic association for contemporary European Studies with events in London and in Brussels. Since 1967, UACES has supported its members in their careers, and promoted the study, research and teaching of contemporary Europe, through a range of activities, publications, events and funding initiatives. Its international and interdisciplinary community is made up of academics, students and practitioners interested in Europe and the EU (www.uaces.org)."
