        "text": "On April 29th 1963, Paul Stephenson led the Bristol Bus Boycott, the UK’s most successful black-led protest movement. On April 10th 1964, he infamously began his one-man-sit-in of the Bay Horse Pub. Both events paved the way for implementing the Race Relations Act 1965, the UK’s first-ever anti-racist law.\n\nAs we approach the 60th anniversary of these three pivotal UK civil rights moments, Curiosity UnLtd has proudly partnered with Diversity UK, Burges Salmon and Triodos Bank. Together, for the first time in its history, we proudly bring the prestigious and high-profile annual Paul Stephenson Lecture to Bristol, its ancestral home city.\n\nOn April 25th, we invite you to join us for the 9th Paul Stephenson Lecture to hear from Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees. Join us for this last opportunity to hear Europe’s first elected Mayor of Black descent share his final reflections on his eight years in office before he leaves office.\n\nThemed around ‘Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants’, this fireside chat will explore his thoughts on Martin Luther King, the legacy of the Bristol Bus Boycott, the toppling of Colston’s statue and his friendship with Alexei Navalny. Also, the future of the One City Plan, his approach to inclusive growth, tackling inequality, the housing crisis, the environmental emergency and more. As part of this event, you can expect a powerful poetry performance, a presentation of honour to the pioneers of the Bristol Bus Boycott, and a short film. There will also be a chance to do some networking over drinks and nibbles.\n\nPlease note that filming and photography will be taking place at this event. Also, by registering to attend, you agree that all tickets are non-transferable, and all attending guests agree to abide by the event code of conduct. These can be viewed here.\n\nDate and time: Thu, 25 Apr 2024 18:30 – 21:30 BST\n\nLocation: Burges Salmon, One Glass Wharf, 1 Glass Wharf Bristol BS2 0ZX\n\nBook Ticket Here\n\nAbout the Paul Stephson Lectures\n\nLaunched at the House of Commons in 2016, previous keynotes of the Paul Stephenson Lectures have included Lord Simon Wooley, Vernon Patrick OBE, Tom Ilube CBE, and Professor. Marcia Wilson.\n\nAbout Paul Stephenson OBE\n\nPaul Stephenson, OBE, is a community worker, activist and long-time campaigner for civil rights for the British African-Caribbean community in Bristol, England. As a young social worker, in April 1963, Stephenson led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. In August 1963, the day the Boycott defeated the ‘Colour Bar’, Martin Luther King gave his iconic ‘I Have A Dream’ speech. In 1964, Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial for failing to leave licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act in 1965. Paul Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009. In July 2014, Mr Stephenson was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Law) by the University of Bristol “for his dedication to fighting for equality and civil rights across Bristol and around the world for over 60 years”.\n\nAbout Marvin Rees OBE\n\nStanding on the shoulders of giants, Marvin Rees was first elected Mayor in May 2016. That day, Bristol became the first major European city to have elected a black mayor. He describes becoming Mayor as another expression of a more profound commitment to building a fairer, more inclusive world.\n\nHe is set to have overseen the building of over 14,500 new homes, announced the development of a mass transit system, and, through Bristol WORKS, provided some 30,000 quality experience of work activities for young people. Marvin worked with partners to secure £95 million to unlock 10,000 new homes and 22,000 new jobs in Temple Quarter, one of Europe’s largest regeneration schemes.\n\nWorking with partners, including through the award-winning One City Approach, he coordinated Bristol’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and planned its recovery – while also steering the city through the aftermath of the toppling of the Colston statue. The Mayor also led the successful bid to bring Channel 4 to Bristol and leads the city’s response to both the climate and ecological emergencies.\n\nMarvin secured the landmark Bristol City Leap partnership in 2022, which plans £771 million investment in clean energy by 2029, creating 1,000 jobs and cutting 150,000 tonnes of emissions. As a founding member of 3Ci and the Mayors Migration Council, Marvin has advocated for cities to be at the heart of tackling climate change, including in a Ted Talk viewed by more than 1.6 million people and as the UK’s representative to the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.\n\nAbout Curiosity UnLtd\n\nCuriosity UnLtd is an award-winning, Bristol-based think-and-do-tank.
