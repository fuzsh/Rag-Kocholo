        "text": "PORTSMOUTH — As the week of Halloween approaches Seacoast Rep has a lot going on with Ghost Tours, the return of Rocky Horror, and the official after party for The Halloween Parade. But Seacoast Rep’s Halloween antics keep adding up. The Rep presents a unique and heartwarming film from the acclaimed and internationally award winning director Michael Paul Stephenson (“Best Worst Movie”) called “The American Scream”.\n\n“The American Scream” is a documentary that follows three Massachusetts families who make it their yearlong work to produce the best and most elaborate Halloween displays their respective towns have ever seen. Each family works tirelessly to conjure up the spookiest yard and home on the block. The film explores the ups and downs between the families, as well as the creativity and craftsmanship inherent in this unique breed of fanaticism. Most of all it demonstrates how these communities come together once a year for a macabre and peculiar celebration- all in the spirit of Halloween. As tender as it is hilarious “The American Scream” is another hit out of the park by director Michael Stephenson, whose acclaimed doc “Best Worst Movie” won him accolades for its exploration of the B-Movie culture that he grew up a part of — on both sides of the camera. “The American Scream” is making its premiere throughout America this October, and the early response has been overwhelmingly positive. The Rep can’t wait to share this one-of-a-kind slice of Americana with you. (and Yes! This film is suitable for families!)\n\nThe Rep’s Red Light series team felt as though “The American Scream” is a pitch perfect fit for Portsmouth’s own Halloween celebrations. It hits close to home as the community gears up for the Portsmouth Halloween Parade. The Rep encourages all to come and see this fantastic documentary about a town that embraces Halloween with open arms and comes together to show off their creativity and love for the most macabre holiday of the year.\n\n“The American Scream” will be screened Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. Tickets are only $5. Tickets may be purchased online at www.seacoastrep.org, at 125 Bow St. or by calling 603-433-4472. This is a general admission event."
