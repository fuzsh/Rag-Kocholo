        "text": "Police officers, staff and volunteers from forces across the country have been recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List.\n\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has received a Knighthood while the chief constables of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, Gwent Police and North Yorkshire Police have all received the Queen’s Police Medal (QPM).\n\nThe deputy chief constables of Nottinghamshire Police and Hertfordshire Constabulary have also been awarded the QPM.\n\nChair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Martin Hewitt, said: “I congratulate all of those recognised for their service to policing in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List, and am pleased to see so many officers, staff and volunteers from across the country being awarded for their contributions to local communities and public safety.\n\n“The awards highlight the commitment and hard work of policing to protect and keep our communities safe all year round and everyone should be rightly proud to be recognised in this way.”\n\nAlongside the chief constable, three other members of Police Scotland received awards. Police Constable Stephen Tanner and recently retired Superintendent Irene Ralston were awarded the QPM while Health and Safety Manager James Bertram received a British Empire Medal for services to policing and to the community in Ayrshire.\n\nSir Iain said: “Our committed and professional officers and staff are the key to the success of Police Scotland and this important recognition is tribute to the effective public service they provide every day, right across the country.\n\n“I pay heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributes to protecting the people of Scotland and offer my warmest congratulations to those recognised today. I am personally, and on behalf of policing in Scotland, deeply honoured and extremely grateful.”\n\nChief Constable Sarah Crew of Avon and Somerset Constabulary said: “Receiving such recognition is truly humbling. The fact that it is Platinum Jubilee year makes it even more so.\n\n“In truth, this award is a mark of the dedicated work of many people over many years, fellow officers and staff as well as colleagues in other organisations, in the voluntary sector and in our communities. I am honoured to accept it on their behalf and because it gives me the opportunity to bring to wider attention their selfless efforts and achievements in the service of others.\n\n“I say thank you and pay tribute to the fantastic people with whom I have had the privilege to work on some truly transformational and life changing projects.”\n\nEight members of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) received awards. Acting Commissioner Sir Stephen House, said: “I am delighted that so many Metropolitan police officers and police staff have been recognised by Her Majesty The Queen in the Birthday Honours. They should be very proud of their dedicated service, wonderful achievements, and the positive impact they have had in so many different ways in keeping London and its communities safe.”\n\nSeven officers from the National Crime Agency were honoured – the highest number to have been recognised in a single set of the Queen’s Birthday Honours.\n\nDirector General Graeme Biggar said: “I congratulate them, and know that all in the NCA can be proud of their skill and determination.\n\n“Their achievements showcase the quality and breadth of the NCA’s response to serious and organised crime, and I hope they inspire others to consider a role with the agency.”\n\nThe full list:\n\nKnighthoods\n\nIain Thomas Livingstone QPM, Chief Constable, Police Service of Scotland.
