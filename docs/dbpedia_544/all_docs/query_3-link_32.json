        "text": "The Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan) is a circular medal 32 mm across, struck in copper and plated with nickel, and suspended from a ribbon using a new arrangement of the blue, red and white colours found on the other four medals issued during Her Majesty’s reign in 1953, 1977, 2002 and 2012. The blue represents Canada’s three seas, with the red and white being the national colours of Canada as taken from the National Flag and Royal Arms of Canada. The white is also a representation of platinum, and the medal commemorates the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe front (obverse) of the medal features the crowned effigy of Queen Elizabeth II with her Canadian Style and Title, also used for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal. The back (reverse) of the medal bears the Saskatchewan Shield of Arms with the Queen’s Royal Cypher and dates of the reign at the top, separated by a pair of western red lilies (the provincial flower), and the phrase VIVAT REGINA (“Long live The Queen”) at the base.\n\nRecipients also receive a certificate. The Lieutenant Governor or a designate will present the medal to recipients.\n\nMedal Criteria\n\nAs with all previous Canadian commemorative medals, the criteria for the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan) is broad. Recipients are of all ages, from all walks of life, provided that they have made a contribution to society.\n\nThree minimum criteria for the medal recipients are:\n\nThey are a resident of Saskatchewan or have a link to Saskatchewan (at the time of the grant of the medal);\n\nThey have made a contribution to Canada, Saskatchewan, or to a particular region or community; and\n\nThey were alive on February 6, 2022, the 70th anniversary of Her Majesty’s Accession to the Throne.\n\nNomination Process\n\nThe public nomination process has ended. The Government of Saskatchewan has partnered with several organizations to ensure a wide distribution of medals across the province. Members of the Legislative Assembly were given an allocation for their constituencies. Cities received an allocation directly. For smaller municipalities, Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA), Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) and New North – Saskatchewan Association of Northern Communities administered nominations.\n\nOther partner groups have been invited to participate in submitting nominations.\n\nQuestions concerning the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan) program can be sent to honours@gov.sk.ca.\n\nOrder in Council P.C. 2002-1192, signed by the Governor General of Canada on November 3, 2022, authorizes the wear of the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan). With the signing of the instrument, the medal is entered into the Canadian Honours System.\n\nThe medal is entered onto the order of precedence in the Canadian Honours System after all the medals under the heading Other Medals. The order of precedence can be found on the Governor General's website.\n\nFor practical purposes in Saskatchewan, this places the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan) after the Saskatchewan Centennial Medal, and before the Saskatchewan Protective Services Medal. The Order of Precedence for Saskatchewan’s Honours is:\n\nSaskatchewan Order of Merit\n\nSaskatchewan Volunteer Medal\n\nSaskatchewan Centennial Medal\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan)\n\nSaskatchewan Protective Services Medal\n\nBelow are some examples of how the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (Saskatchewan) should be mounted with other medals."
