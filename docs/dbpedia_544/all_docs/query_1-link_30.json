        "text": "Microbiology is the study of all living organisms that are too small to be visible with the naked eye. This includes bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, prions, protozoa and algae, collectively known as 'microbes'.\n\nThe Microbiology Society has a vision and mission around which we base our strategy. Our members have a unique depth and breadth of knowledge about the discipline. The Society’s role is to help unlock and harness the potential of that knowledge.\n\nAs a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee, the Microbiology Society's Council bears legal responsibilities. The Society also has a number of committees, including Division Committees.\n\nFind out about what the Early Career (EC) Forum is and why it was established.\n\nThe Microbiology Society is working with the scientific community to engage with policy-makers on the issue of Brexit. The Microbiology Society's Council's Statement on Brexit can also be found here.\n\nMicrobiology Society journals contain high-quality research papers and topical review articles. We are a not-for-profit publisher and we support and invest in the microbiology community, to the benefit of everyone.\n\nExplore our new collections of digital content which celebrate 'Why Microbiology Matters' and helps us demonstrate the impact of microbiologists past, present and future.\n\nThe Microbiology Society is leading the way with the Knocking Out AMR project, an ambitious, bold and extensive scheme of work aiming to promote feasible and effective solutions to AMR.\n\nMicrobiome research is a rapidly developing area of science and innovation, seeking to explore and exploit the complex communities of microbes associated with humans, animals, plants and other environments such as soils and oceans.\n\nDiscover everything you need to know about the role microbiology plays in climate change, browse our resources and access some of the latest research in our journal collections.\n\nThe Microbiology Society widens the impact of microbiology by drawing on the expertise of its membership and amplifying their voices in policy circles\n\nWe offer a range of membership options. View the categories available to find the one most suitable for you.\n\nFind out how to get the most out of your membership.\n\nBy remembering the Society in your Will you can help support the future of microbiology and the next generation of microbiologists.\n\nWhat to do after you graduate and how to get a job.\n\nSome of the roles outside of research where you could use your knowledge.\n\nThe links provided on this page contain a list of institutions that may be useful and able to provide further information.\n\nThe Microbiology Society provides funds to support microbiologists and develop microbiology, teaching and research in countries defined as low-income or lower-middle-income economies by the World Bank.\n\nThe Microbiology Society supports microbiology-related education and outreach activities and funds are available for members keen to run and participate in these events.\n\nThe Society's first fundraising initiative for members who may require support for a variety of reasons, in order to help them to progress and to reach their full career potential.\n\nAnnual Conference is the Society’s flagship event. The Conference brings together scientists who work in microbiology and provides a comprehensive overview of current microbiological research and discoveries. The event takes place over the course of a week each April at one of the UK or Ireland’s major convention centres and is designed to maximise opportunities for networking and the formation of new collaborations.\n\nAt the Society, we provide a number of high quality events and meetings throughout the year, including the Focused Meeting series.\n\nThe Microbiology Society provides financial support for events held by other organisations in the areas of microbiology and virology.\n\nThe Microbiology Society will highlight details of any event held by other organisations in the areas of microbiology. If you would like to list an event here, you can submit your details in through our online form.\n\nThe Scientific Seminar Series is designed to reach a priority microbiology community to support it in disseminating knowledge across its professional networks. The events are designed as a regularly repeated series of short (typically 1–2 hour) online meetings."
