        "text": "One of the UK's leading civil rights campaigners has had a train named in his honour.\n\nDr Paul Stephenson organised the 1960s Bristol bus boycott which overturned a ban on people from ethnic minorities working on buses in the city.\n\nGreat Western Railway, which said it wanted to recognise his dedication to civil rights, held a naming ceremony at Bristol Temple Meads station.\n\nDr Stephenson, 83, said it was \"a wonderful gesture\".\n\n\"I feel very proud to be considered by GWR as one of its Great Westerners,\" he added.\n\n\"History is very important for understanding who we are, what's happening to us today and where our vision is for tomorrow.\n\n\"It is vital to take ownership of our history and to revisit it from time to time to ensure we have a clearer picture of our time and understanding of our humanity.\"\n\nDr Stephenson, whose name will feature on GWR intercity express train 800036, has spent more than 60 years campaigning for the British African-Caribbean community."
