        "text": "Prior to the creation of the Australian honours system members of Australian police forces were acknowledged by Imperial awards:\n\nQueen’s Police Medal for Gallantry (awarded posthumously)\n\nQueen’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service\n\nPolice Long Service and Good Conduct Medal\n\nIn 1986 a distinctly Australian award, the Australian Police Medal, was created. The medal gives special recognition to members of Australian police forces for commendable service.\n\nThe Australian Police Medal was established on 3 March 1986 by Letters Patent.\n\nThe Governor-General awards the Australian Police Medal on the recommendation of the responsible Commonwealth, state and territory ministers.\n\nEach Australian police force may award one Australian Police Medal for every 1000 members, or part of 1000 members, in each calendar year.\n\nOnly one award can be made to an individual. Recipients are entitled to the post-nominal APM.\n\nThe Australian Police Medal is announced on Australia Day (January 26) and the Queen’s Birthday (June) of each year"
