        "text": "Best Worst Movie is Michael Paul Stephenson’s feature directing debut. His career in the entertainment industry started at the age of 8 when he was discovered by an agent while acting as the lead in his school’s rendition of Peter Pan. At 10 years old he was cast as the child star of the worst movie ever made: Troll 2. But, starring in the worst movie ever made didn’t ruin him or his desire to work in the industry.\n\nMichael spent most of his teenage years as a punk-kid making skateboarding videos with his pals and writing screenplays and short stories. He continued acting into his early twenties and has worked with outstanding directors such as Academy Award nominee Taika Waititi and Robert Redford.\n\nAs a cinematographer Michael has worked on numerous projects, most recently with Oscar nominee Mel Stuart. He has written, produced and edited various projects for clients such as GRB TV, Shape Magazine, GE, ABC and more.\n\nAs a writer, Michael was a recipient of the prestigious American Gem Screenplay Award for his screenplay, Orange. Michael is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and resides in Los Angeles with his producing-partner and wife, Lindsay Stephenson."
