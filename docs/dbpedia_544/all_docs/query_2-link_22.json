        "text": "The Governor-General awards the Australian Police Medal on the recommendation of the responsible Commonwealth, state and territory ministers.\n\nThe medal is awarded annually as follows:\n\nOne medal for every 1000, or part of 1000, members of the Australian police force of the Commonwealth, State or Territory, plus one additional award.\n\nAwards are announced in January and June each year.\n\nOnly one award can be made to an individual. Recipients are entitled to the post-nominal APM.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Australian honours system members of Australian police forces were acknowledged by Imperial awards:\n\nQueen’s Police Medal for Gallantry (awarded posthumously)\n\nQueen’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service\n\nPolice Long Service and Good Conduct Medal\n\nIn 1986 a distinctly Australian award, the Australian Police Medal, was created. The medal gives special recognition to members of Australian police forces for commendable service.\n\nThe Australian Police Medal was established on 3 March 1986 by Letters Patent.\n\nOn 23 December 2021, amendments to the Australian Police Medal Regulations were approved by Her Majesty the Queen enabling the recognition of COVID-19 related service above the annual quotas.\n\nThe Australian Police Medal is a circular, nickel-silver medal ensigned with the Crown of St Edward. The front of the medal displays the effigy of the Sovereign on a Federation Star, superimposed over a pattern of fluted rays.\n\nThe back of the medal is inscribed with the words ‘Australian Police Medal’ and ‘For Distinguished Service’. The inscriptions are encircled by a wreath of the national floral emblem, the golden wattle.\n\nMedal Ribbon\n\nThe 32 millimetre-wide ribbon features a central vertical stripe of dark blue flanked by two white stripes."
