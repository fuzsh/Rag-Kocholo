        "text": "When he was appointed Met Commissioner in January 2009, he had emerged virtually unscathed from three years of civil war among the top ranks at Scotland Yard during Sir Ian Blair's tenure.\n\nBehind the scenes, the straight-talking deputy commissioner had quietly been holding the Metropolitan police together.\n\nKnown for his no nonsense approach to policing, he genuinely fit the often overused tag of a “copper’s copper” and was well liked throughout the ranks.\n\nWhen a race row between Sir Ian and Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur played itself out in public, it was Sir Paul, 57, who gave a blunt statement calling for everyone to \"shut up'' and get on with their jobs.\n\nHe also effectively shamed Sir Ian into refusing a £25,000 performance bonus by waiving his own bonus in October 2007.\n\nFor those who know him, it will not have come as a surprise that a man who prided himself on his integrity took the decision to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nNicknamed \"Rusty\" by some because of his frequently tanned face, his resignation is a surprise for one who had been quietly building a reputation as a survivor.\n\nHe demonstrated steady ascent up the ranks of the police force, which he joined in 1975 following a career as a shoe salesman. By 1994 he had become Assistant Chief Constable Merseyside Police. His profile on the Metropolitan Police website says he took a leading role in gun crime, anti-corruption and combating terrorism.\n\nWhile in Merseyside he coordinated the police response to a major incident ahead of the 1997 Grand National, when a bomb warning, thought to be from the IRA, closed Aintree and forced a postponement of the race.\n\nAfter occupying the Deputy and Chief Constable posts with the Lancashire Constabulary, he was appointed Deputy Metropolitan Police commissioner in 2005 four months before the 7/7 attacks left 52 innocent people dead in the capital.\n\nBefore his resignation he had already come through two major crises during his reign – the fall out of the arrest of Tory MP Damian Green and the furore surrounding the student protests in London that turned to violence.\n\nWithin hours of becoming acting commissioner in December 2009, Sir Paul was caught up in the Damian Green affair, having sanctioned the arrest of the Tory MP.\n\nHe was in the firing line when the Met was criticised for what Conservatives said was a heavy-handed operation to combat Home Office leaks.\n\nAnd last December, his force’s preparations were called in to question when security breaches allowed protesters to attack a royal limousine carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister David Cameron said the attack on the prince’s car had been “not the fault of the police David Davis, the former Shadow Home Secretary, told the Daily Telegraph: “Sir Paul has some very serious questions to answer about this operation.”\n\nBut when claims that Met police officers were paid by the News of the World surfaced publicly, Sir Paul took a typically frank stance.\n\nHe referred the force's internal investigation to the Independent Police Complains Commission (IPCC) and vowed to \"root out\" and put in front of a criminal court any corrupt staff.\n\nBut since then his own judgement as Met Commissioner has been questioned and proved one criticism too far.\n\nHe came under intense criticism last week for his links with Neil Wallis, the former News of the World executive who was paid more than £1,000 a day to work two days a month as a consultant to Sir Paul.\n\nThe relationship had left the Home Secretary, Theresa May “concerned”.\n\nSir Paul was brought up in the Lancashire town of Bacup. When his older brother joined the local police, he decided to follow. He rose rapidly through the ranks during stints in Northern Ireland, Merseyside and Lancashire., rising to Chief Constable of the latter in 2002.\n\nSir Paul is said to have placed a desire to serve the public at the core of his beliefs, a lesson he learnt from a shop manager.\n\nIn July 2002, when he became chief constable in Lancashire, he visited the store and asked the manager what made it work. \"Keeping the queues down and the customers happy,'' he was told. Sir Paul has made that his mantra, serving the public."
