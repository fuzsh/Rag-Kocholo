        "text": "As a young person, a teenager, a young adult, and even into my adult years, I had to navigate these conditions without fully understanding them. It was not until I reached the age of 46, after experiencing some trauma, that I finally received a diagnosis. It was like a light switch had been turned on, providing me with a newfound understanding and explanation for my experiences. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.\n\nHowever, this onset brought forth an explosion of tics, making me feel ridiculed by the condition. I retreated and locked myself away for weeks on end, too embarrassed to face the outside world. Unfortunately, the severity of my motor tics led to numerous injuries, which have now become secondary disabilities. I struggled to find a way to manage the condition effectively.\n\nWhen you receive a diagnosis, the doctor often leaves you with the understanding that you have Tourette Syndrome and then sends you on your way to navigate life on your own. But I believe it would be more beneficial if they provided a comprehensive approach.\n\nThey should offer resources like pamphlets with contact information for Tourette’s associations, recommending reaching out for support from others who live with the condition. Additionally, they should encourage studying Tourette’s, understanding how it personally manifests and finding ways to work alongside it."
