Applicants must also have at least 30 hours of completed undergraduate credit by the time of the study abroad term’s start date and intend to study abroad in a program that is outside of the U.S. and be enrolling in a study abroad term (the days that you are actually enrolled in classes abroad) that is no shorter than 14 weeks. Summer applicants will not be considered unless their academic term abroad is longer than 14 weeks, in which case they should apply for the Spring semester scholarship. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 at their current institution, verifiable on their transcript is required. For more information or to apply, please visit the scholarship provider’s website.\n\nBenjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program\n\nAmount: $5000\n\nThe Gilman Scholarship Program is open to U.S. citizen undergraduate students who are receiving Federal Pell Grant funding at a two-year or four-year college or university to participate in study and intern abroad programs worldwide.

In exchange for funding, Boren Scholars commit to working in the federal government for at least one year after graduation. High school graduates, GED recipients and matriculated undergraduate students may apply for the scholarship.

Even if you can only go abroad for a brief time, the CLS Program is perfect as it funds U.S. undergraduate and graduate students for “overseas language and cultural immersion programs,” specifically during the summer months.
