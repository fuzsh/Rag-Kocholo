        "text": "The legendary Bristol civil rights campaigner Dr Paul Stephenson has been given a Pride of Britain award for paving the way for Britain’s first race laws.\n\nDr Stephenson, now 80, helped highlight the racism black people faced every day in this country and led the victorious Bristol Bus Boycott in 1963.\n\nHe and two other men, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey, campaigned against discrimination in the Bristol Omnibus Company and helped bring about the Race Relations Act three years later.\n\nWhile receiving his Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Lifetime Achievement Award, Dr Stephenson said: “Racism eats in our society, it holds sway over people, particularly people in society poverty. We have a duty to our children, our grandchildren to decide what kind of society we are going to live by.\n\n\"If you were a young black person living in Britain, you couldn’t be a policeman, an ambulanceman or fireman. You couldn’t go into pubs, hotels, swimming pools, and you couldn’t drive on the buses.\n\n\"I had been watching the amazing things that Martin Luther King had been achieving in America, and now I thought something had to be done here too.\"\n\nDr Stephenson arrived in Bristol as a community development officer in 1962 after growing up in east London.\n\nOne year later, he kick-started a 60-day boycott of the bus firm because they refused to employ black or Asian people.\n\nThe campaign was successful on 28 August 1963, on the very day that Martin Luther King delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech in Washington.\n\nPaul then went on to achieve nationwide fame for refusing to leave a public house until he was served - in the face of their 'no blacks' policy.\n\nHis resulting arrest and trial paved the way for the first Race Relations Act in 1965.\n\nDr Stephenson was helped to the stage by his wife Joyce on their 52nd wedding anniversary and his friend, and actor, Rudolph Walker OBE.\n\nHe was presented the award by comedian and actor Lenny Henry, who said: “It is a well-known saying that to achieve greatness you have to stand on the shoulders of giants. You really are a giant. So without you, there wouldn’t be any black or Asian politicians.\n\n“Paul is an inspiration to anyone who speaks the truth to power. He is someone who was to take a big risk to make a difference, he risked unemployment, he risked being attacked in the street. I wouldn’t have had the courage to take the stand I have on diversity if it wasn’t for Paul."
