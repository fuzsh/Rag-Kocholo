        "text": "\"If you were a young black person living in Britain, you couldn’t be a policeman, an ambulance man or fireman. You couldn’t go into pubs, hotels, swimming pools, and now you couldn’t drive on the buses. I had been watching the amazing things that Martin Luther King had been achieving in America, and now I thought something had to be done here too.\" said: Essex racial equality campaigner, Dr Stephenson\n\nAugust 28, 1963, is a date celebrated by millions of people around the world. On that day, Martin Luther King stood before a 250,000-strong crowd at the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his 'I Have a Dream' speech.\n\nOn the other side of the pond, meanwhile, a group of Bristol men were also busy bringing changes to society - including Essex's Dr Paul Stephenson. When it comes to race equality laws in the UK, there is arguably no one more important than the powerful trio of Paul Stephenson, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey.\n\nREAD: Third arrest made in Croydon in connection to missing Essex student nurse\n\nBorn to a British mother and West African father in Rochford in 1937, Dr Stephenson has established himself in history as a pioneer for racial equality across the UK. Aged just three, he was evacuated to a care home in Great Dunmow, where he stayed for seven years.\n\nHe went to school at Forest Gate Secondary School in London, where he was the only black child, before serving in the Royal Air Force. He moved to Bristol as a young adult to work for the City Council.\n\nFast forward to 1963 - when he was a community development officer in his 20s - and Paul and his friends were on the verge of changing the course of history in the UK.\n\nEarly 1960s Bristol had thousands of West Indian originating residents who had emigrated to post-WW2 Britain. A race bar, however, meant that people who were non-white could not be drivers or conductors. So when a Bristol bus firm refused to offer jobs to Black or Asian people, Dr Stephenson helped lead a 60-day boycott of the company.\n\nDr Stephenson acted as the spokesperson for the group and support for the boycott came from all corners of society. Local MP Tony Benn backed the campaign as did then-Labour leader Harold Wilson. Mr Wilson condemned the bus company, with several high-profile businessmen and sportsmen backing their action. They spoke out against the colour bar to reporters, and leaflets went out across the city.\n\nOn August 27, a mass meeting of more than 500 bus workers was held. They formally agreed to end the colour bar. By mid-September, Raghbir Sing became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor. He was later joined by two Jamaican and two Pakistani men days later.\n\nPaul was not finished there, though. He wanted to push for more change and continue highlighting the racism being suffered by so many.\n\nAround a year after his triumphant boycott, Paul walked into the Bay Horse pub in Bristol to order half a pint. He was served by the bartender, but when the pub's manager became aware, he demanded he left, saying: \"We don’t want you black people in here – you are a nuisance.\"\n\nAfter refusing to leave, his arrest and trial paved the way for the first Race Relations Act in 1965. It forbade discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins, and applied to both British residents and visitors to the UK in public places.\n\nREAD: New Nando's set to open its doors in Basildon's East Square cinema development\n\nFew doubt that without Paul’s efforts it would have been difficult for Harold Wilson’s Labour government to bring in Britain’s first anti-discrimination laws. Wilson even sent Paul a personal telegram to say he would change the law following his victorious case.\n\nIn 2009, Dr Stephenson was recognised alongside Guy and Roy for their roles with an OBE. He also received honourary degrees from the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol.\n\nEight years later he received a Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement. Actor and comedian Lenny Henry, presenting the award, said: “It is a well-known saying that to achieve greatness you have to stand on the shoulders of giants. You really are a giant. So without you, there wouldn’t be any black or Asian politicians.\n\n\"Paul is an inspiration to anyone who speaks the truth to power. He is someone who was to take a big risk to make a difference, he risked unemployment, he risked being attacked in the street. I wouldn’t have had the courage to take the stand I have on diversity if it wasn’t for Paul.\n\n\"This is our Martin Luther King right here, I was a little kid, I never saw people like you on television, it made me feel like we could do the same, to make a difference.\"\n\nThe judges added: \"Thanks to Paul’s courage, principles and determination, Britain is a more open and tolerant place today. He has changed the way we all live for the better, and his story reminds us that the battle for civil rights was not confined to America.\"\n\nDr Stephenson might now be in his 80s and suffering from Parkinson's disease, but he has a simple and clear message for us all: \"Every generation has a duty to fight against racism, otherwise it will find its way into our country and into our homes. Addressing this challenge is our duty if we wish to seek a happy and prosperous existence.\"\n\nREAD NEXT"
