He has responsibility for policing services delivered in all Lancashire’s territorial policing divisions and the control room at our police HQ in Hutton.\n\nTerry has worked in various locations across Lancashire and in numerous roles including Response, Road Policing & Motorway, Support Unit, Child Sexual Exploitation Teams, Neighbourhood Policing and Change Management.\n\nHe is an accredited Specialist Strategic Firearms, CBRN, Public Order and Multi Agency Commander and has commanded many large-scale operations over the years including taking command in the early stages of the wide and resolute partnership under the Lancashire Resilience Forum during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable, Terry Woods, leads nationally on Police Driver Training.\n\nHe said: “I am very humbled but delighted to receive this honour and I would like to thank my family and colleagues for all their support throughout my policing career so far”.\n\nLancashire Constabulary Chief Constable Chris Rowley said: “I am absolutely delighted for Terry. This is a great achievement and richly deserved recognition for a distinguished career. Terry is hugely respected both throughout the force and UK policing in general. It’s a great accolade for both him and the constabulary.”"
