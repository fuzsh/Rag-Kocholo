Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Paul Stephenson, who was born in Bacup, will travel to Buckingham Palace at the end of the year to receive the honour from the Queen.

Mr Stephenson, a former pupil of Fearns Community High School, Stacksteads, worked as a sergeant in Bacup in the early 1980s and was appointed deputy chief constable of Lancashire in 1999.

He has also worked in forces throughout the North West, as well as the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

In 2002, he became the county’s chief constable, and has been deputy commissioner in the Capital since 2005, taking over from Sir Ian Blair when he was appointed Metropolitan Police Commissioner – the top police job in the UK.

Mr Stephenson now works closely with Sir Ian, taking overall responsibility for strategy, modernisation and performance.

He was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal for his services to policing in May 2002.
