        "text": "Throwback Thursday – Royal Music Co. on State Street\n\nBowling Green has a rich musical heritage. From the Fathers of Ragtime and Newgrass to modern rockers, WNKY has shown you the history and live stories of the scene. This week we’re downtown on State Street visiting the old Royal Music Co. location.\n\nReid Hoskins and Norman Lewis founded Royal Music Co. in Bowling Green in 1947. It was the only music store in south central Kentucky and serviced all the orchestras and bands in this part of the state.\n\nThe location has moved around a couple of places over the past 80 years. But the store spent most of its time right here at 1023 State Street. Currently being used for storage, the space is no longer a storefront.\n\nRoyal Music Co. originally opened on 10th Street downtown. It moved to this State Street location 17 years later in 1964, which is where it remained until its Fairview location opened in 2011. The State Street building featured a beautiful mural of downtown Bowling Green, instruments and music for sale.\n\nCurrent owners Greg and Paula Lyons bought the store in 1991. Both are former Kentucky band directors and wanted to continue playing a role in southern Kentucky music and arts. The Lyons family believes in music education and Royal Music Co. now offers its largest selection of instruments, sheet music and programming than ever.\n\nRoyal Music Co. representatives now serve all of southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee, traveling an average of 1500 miles a week back and forth to schools, taking repairs and delivering special orders."
