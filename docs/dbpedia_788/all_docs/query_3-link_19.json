The team bowlers qualified for Division B based on their verified averages (bowl.com). The singles/doubles and all-events bowlers qualified for Division B based on their verified averages (bowl.com). After completion of the final squad, the standings reflected that this team placed first in Division B. The two bowlers who competed in singles, doubles, and all-events also placed in money positions in some or all of these events (in Division B Handicap).\n\nAfter the tournament, it was determined that all five bowlers from this entry were on the USBC tournament rerate list. An eMail was sent to USBC Rules to verify the application of Rule 319c (failure to report prior rerate), and we were advised that the rule absolutely applies to our tournament. The team captain was sent a formal USBC letter from the tournament director, disqualifying both the team event and the singles/doubles/all-events (handicap events only).\n\nAll five members appealed their disqualification to USBC pursuant to the rule. USBC determined that the disqualification stands and sent formal letters to all parties. The team captain and other members filed additional appeals, as allowed pursuant to USBC rules (final appeal to the USBC Legal Committee).\n\nCurrently, the final date to comment on this matter is August 23, 2017, so any FINAL ruling by the USBC Legal Committee will be made after that.\n\nChester V.

He received a championship plaque that commemorated his Mansfield (Ohio) Senior High School's team victory in the America High School Bowling Congress (AHSBC) National Telegraphic Championship on April 6, 1942. A victim of the ABC constitution's \"Caucasian Only\" membership clause, Woodbury was denied an all-expense-paid trip with his teammates to the 1942 ABC Tournament in Columbus, Ohio to compete in a series of exhibition matches. (ABC, which dropped its discriminatory policy in 1950, was the governing body of AHSBC. Woodbury's team spot in Columbus was taken by a white member of the school's second team.)\n\nWoodbury was elected to the NCAUSBCA Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nWoodbury Hall of Fame bio\n\nAMF Capital Plaza to host \"Ebonite League Night\"\n\nOctober 20, 2008  Area bowlers will have the opportunity to try the newest Ebonite ball before it hits the streets as part of an \"Ebonite League Night\" October 23 beginning at 4 p.m. at AMF Capital Plaza.

He was always interested in elevating the awareness of bowling in the media and publicizing the accomplishments of its participants. He began contributing articles to the Potomac News in 1990 and soon became the newspaper's bowling columnist, submitting a weekly column until his recent illness.\n\nHe was a member of the Bowling Writers Association of America and the Southern Bowling Writers. In 1997, the Metropolitan Bowling Writers Association of America presented him with the prestigious Joe Richards Memorial Award for distinguished service to bowling journalism.\n\nWhile a league secretary at then-Fair Lanes Dale City, his Community Charities Program each year raised funds and obtained merchandise for local charities. Without fanfare, he financially supported numerous youth bowling activities and was an annual patron to the NCAUSBCA Hall of Fame, into which he was inducted in 1999.\n\nGruszkowski, who continued to serve NCAUSBCA as a director until his death, will be buried October 16 at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nParsons honored at Bowl Expo\n\nJuly 1, 2008  Gary \"Guru\" Parsons of Suitland, Md., last week was named the 2008 recipient of \"The John Davis Award.\" The surprise presentation was made in Orlando, Fla., at International Bowl Expo 2008. Parsons, 60, joins an impressive list of previous honorees that includes Joyce Deitch, John Weber, Ted Hoffman Jr., Jim Dressel, Mark Gerberich, Carmen Salvino, and Linda Davis.\n\nParsons, who is approaching his 50th year in bowling, has been a scratch bowler since the 1960s, winning many scratch tournaments in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s before a knee injury sidelined him. He won two national collegiate championships at Harding College in 1970 and 1971, and he was the first Nation's Capital Area bowler to roll back-to-back 300 games.\n\nParsons started coaching in the early 1970s, taught at the first two \"Super Schools,\" and is consistently voted in as a \"Top 100\" coach in Bowlers Journal International's annual poll. He's a Level III Certified Ritger Instructor along with being a Silver Level USBC Bowling Coach. A two-time IBPSIA board member, he created an \"Advanced Certification Program\" for the organization. Parsons owns pro shops in Camp Springs and Hyattsville in Maryland, and he also is an accomplished bowling writer with over 100 published articles. Out of respect, he often is referred to by his friends and colleagues as \"Guru.\"\n\nIn 1996, John Davis called together a group of professional lanemen in an attempt to research the problems that were affecting the sport of bowling. Out of that week-long meeting, a \"Guild of Lanemen\" was established, and Davis promised that his group would be involved in as many major events in the world as possible and to exhibit all of the research for the whole world to see on the company's Web site. The following year, The Foundation was formed, and Parsons became actively involved at its very inception by becoming a Founding Member, and he has continually supported The Foundation in many ways as well as being a continuing contributor.\n\nDavis, the man who started The Kegel Company and \"founding father\" of The Foundation, has been totally involved in bowling for nearly his entire life. At an early age, John's dad taught all of his children how to bowl. That love affair with this great sport has been going on for over a half century. In his 50-plus years of involvement with bowling, some believe that no one has done more for the sport than John Davis. Even though The Kegel Company is a relatively small one, his personal investment in bowling has been unselfish and unmatched.\n\nDavis's innovations, inventions, contributions, etc., have all been well-documented. His worldwide leadership in both technology and humanities makes him one of the most sought-out figures in the game today. His behind-the-scenes committee work is also globally welcomed.\n\nBecause of his vast accomplishments and devotion to the sport, the award  aptly called \"The John Davis Award\"  was established by The Foundation in his name. This prestigious honor is presented annually to a deserving Foundation Member. A beautiful, \"one-of-a-kind\" perpetual plaque, with the words, For Outstanding Contributions and Extraordinary Efforts on Behalf of the Advancement of the Sport of Bowling, and bearing each recipient's name, is permanently displayed at the home of The Foundation in The Kegel Training Center in Lake Wales, Fla.\n\nWe \"R\" One Bowling Club introduces Three-Person Doubles Tournament\n\nApril 10, 2008  The We \"R\" One Bowling Club announced that it will hold its inaugural Three-Person Doubles Tournament at AMF Capital Plaza on May 3 and 4, 2008.

Area and Virginia State Womens Bowling Associations, died yesterday. She is widely recognized for her more than 60 years of service to womens bowling at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nIn the 1940s, Bennies involvement in bowling helped found the Washington, D.C. Area Women's Bowling Association (WDCAWBA). She is credited with helping to bring tenpin bowling to the Nations Capital Area. In those days, duckpin bowling prevailed locally. In 1947, Bennie and her husband, former American Bowling Congress president and Nation's Capital Area USBC Association Hall of Famer Matthew Bennie, purchased the areas first certified tenpin bowling center in Alexandria. Over the next few years, many of the areas duckpin bowling center owners began to see the popularity of tenpin bowling, and the area boomed with new bowling centers and sanctioned bowlers.\n\nBennie served bowling at every level, including as a league secretary. In 1953, she accepted a position as secretary of WDCAWBA. During her time as secretary, membership in her association skyrocketed from 278 members to more than 15,000 members in 1963. In 1957, she helped form the Virginia State WBA. Bennies work in bowling directly resulted in hundreds of thousands of women in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia becoming members of the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC).\n\nIn 1963, she accepted a position on the WIBC board of directors, which she fulfilled for more than 15 years. In 1979, Bennie was named a WIBC member emerita. At the national level, she also served as director of the American Junior Bowling Congress (later the Young American Bowling Alliance). Regionally, Bennie helped form what eventually became the Vir-Mar District YABA. Her local and state accomplishments include positions as a founder, director, and secretary/treasurer of WDCAWBA as well as a founder and vice president of the Virginia State WBA.\n\nUntil recently, Bennie, a member of the NCAUSBCA, Virginia State WBA, and USBC Halls of Fame, remained active with the local association. Her daughter, Sharon Weber, is a member of the NCAUSBCA board.\n\nVisitation is planned for Wednesday, November 14 from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. at George P. Kalas Funeral Home, 6160 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, Md.

(January 4, 2006)  After a thorough investigation, a 900 series bowled Nov. 5 by 17-year-old Robert Mushtare in Fort Drum, N.Y., has been administratively rejected by the United States Bowling Congress.\n\nThe series, which was submitted as having occurred during a pre-bowling session for the Pine Plains Junior/Senior League at Pine Plains Bowling Center, was denied because Mushtare did not have a valid USBC Youth membership and the league was not USBC certified on the date the score was rolled. Mushtare is appealing the decision.\n\nThe Watertown USBC Youth Bowling Association did not receive Mushtare's membership card and league certification applications until Nov. 18. USBC rules require such information be submitted within 30 days of the start of the league's schedule. Since Mushtare's league started on Sept. 17, the 30-day grace period ended Oct. 16. According to USBC rules, because the information was received after the end of the grace period, services such as award recognition began the date the information was received.\n\nSEE:\n\nBill Herald (HeraldTribune.com): Is 17-year-old Mushtare a bowling phenom or a phony?\n\nHall of Famer Mal Evans dies\n\nSeptember 27, 2005  NCABA tonight learned that Hall of Famer Malton V. \"Mal\" Evans died September 21 in Myrtle Beach, S.C., following a long and difficult battle with cancer.

Part of the article read: \"When Dick Weber came to my community to open and dedicate our new bowling center, the place was packed.

The 35-year-old computer engineer and World Cup rookie brought the title back to Finland after a one-year absence by overcoming No. 2 seed Petter Hansen of Norway, 2 games to 1 (258-208, 216-233, 258-242).\n\nIt was a successful comeback for Virtanen, who quit international bowling for five years but started training and competing again this past spring. I bowled with Team Finland in Singapore in the 1991 World Championships and won a bronze medal, so I have good feelings about being here, Virtanen said.\n\nHansen had a chance to win by getting either a strike or spare in the 10th frame of the final game, but he left a disastrous 2-8-10 split instead and failed to convert it. Virtanen admitted he was taken aback to win that way.\n\nI had hoped hed leave something on his first ball, to force him to shoot for a spare and make things a little harder for him. But I never hope for that kind of bad luck for anyone.\n\nHansen ousted hometown favorite and No. 6 seed Remy Ong of Singapore in the first semifinal match, 2 games to 1 (259-279, 248-214, 257-210), to advance to the title bout. His wish to bowl Virtanen for the title came true when the Finn defeated Rabin in the other semifinal match, 2 games to 1 (200-215, 214-194, 238-220).\n\nThe Finns are so good that if I beat one of them, then I will know I bowled very well indeed, Hansen had said. Kai and I had promised each other wed be in the title match together, and here we were.\n\nIn the womens division, No. 2 seed Pluhowsky became the third woman ever to win the title twice by dethroning defending champion Kerrie Ryan-Ciach of Canada, 2 games to 0 (236-200, 234-185).\n\nPluhowsky advanced to the championship round by dismissing No. 3 seed Liza Del Rosario of the Philippines in the first semifinal match of the day, also by a 2-0 score (259-226, 269-169). Ryan-Ciach, the No. 8 seed, earned her berth by outlasting No. 5 seed Yoselin Leon of Puerto Rico, 2 games to 1 (279-190, 193-257, 208-193).\n\nPluhowskys win avenged her loss to Ryan-Ciach in last years World Cup finals in Honduras. The 22-year-old U.S. national amateur champion admitted earlier in the week that the loss motivated her in Singapore. I learned a lot from my performance last year. In fact, I think I could have bowled better the entire season. My loss last year was a driving force for this season.\n\nRyan-Ciach, the 33-year-old Canadian national champion, could have become the second person in World Cup history to win back-to-back titles. I thought I had an edge going into the finals right after the semifinals, because I was loose and warmed up, she said. For whatever reason, I didnt have the same ball reaction today. I lost my pin carry in the second match with Shannon. I made good shots, but kept leaving 4-pins and 10-pins, and it s difficult to adjust for that kind of carry.\n\nRyan-Ciach achieved some satisfaction, however, as she and Jack Guay won the Bent Petersen Trophy for best combined country performance. Guay finished tied for fifth in the mens division.\n\nA record 95 nations competed in this years AMF World Cup (93 men, 73 women).

I had to see it on the replay to believe it.\n\nThe 300-247 victory over Belmonte in the first game was the forerunner of a 2 games to 0 victory over the tournaments top seed (300-247, 228-219). Insult added to injury for the Australian when he left the 4-6-7-10 split in the 10th frame of the second game while needing a spare or strike to win and force the match to a third game.\n\nI thought I threw it well, but it just kind of ran up on the pocket a little, Belmonte said. I didnt expect that split from that ball.\n\nVirtanens perfect game was the 27th 300 game in World Cup history but the first ever recorded in either the stepladder format or the current knockout format.\n\nVirtanen squares off against No. 5 seed Yahav Rabin of Israel in the semifinals. Rabin defeated No. 4 seed Chester King of the Philippines 2 games to 1 (179-257, 237-236, 257-235). The other semifinal match pairs hometown favorite and No. 6 seed Remy Ong with No. 2 seed Petter Hansen of Norway. Hansen made short work of Belgiums Yves Van Eyken, 2 games to 0, with a near-perfect effort (279-203, 257-240).\n\nOng thwarted Canadas Jack Guay, 2 games to 1 (206-193, 204-279, 223-218) to keep alive Singapores hopes for its first World Cup title. Ong had to regroup from an open frame in his final game and then double in the 10th to defeat Guay.\n\nAt this level, concentration is so important, said Ong. I think I will learn from my mistakes today. He (Jack) struck out to force me to strike. I would like to be in that position any day, finishing first and forcing the other person to strike.\n\nThis is a matter of self-achievement for me. I was so close in 2002. My dream has always been to win a world title. Hopefully, it will not be long until that happens.\n\nIn the womens division, Puerto Ricos Yoselin Leon, Liza Del Rosario of the Philippines, Shannon Pluhowsky of the U.S. and defending champion Kerrie Ryan-Ciach of Canada advanced to the semifinal round.\n\nRyan-Ciach, who grabbed the final seed from Singapores Valerie Teo by just three pins Friday, devastated No. 1 seed Shalin Zulkifli of Malaysia, 2 games to 0 (201-197, 235-225). Zulkifli has never won a head-to-head match in seven World Cup tries.\n\nThe match was as tough as I thought it would be, Ryan-Ciach said. Shalin never gave up and gave it everything she had; she just didnt get the pin carry.\n\nA spectator tried to console Zulkifli after the match, telling her she did her best, to which Zulkifli responded, My best just isnt good enough.\n\nRyan-Ciach will take on No. 5 seed Leon in Sundays semifinal round at SuperBowl SAFRA Mount Faber. Leon dispatched Australias Ann-Maree Putney, the No. 4 seed, 2 games to 1 (189-279, 238-160, 205-200) on Saturday. The other pairing pits No. 3 seed Del Rosario against No. 2 seed Pluhowsky, the 2002 World Cup champion.\n\nDel Rosario defeated No. 6 seed Helen Johnsson of Sweden, 2 games to 0 (278-203, 232-189), while Pluhowsky had little trouble with No. 7 seed Laura Rhoney of Scotland (223-204 and 231-163).\n\nThe semifinal round begins with Pluhowsky and Del Rosario locking horns in the opener at 9 a.m. Sunday.
