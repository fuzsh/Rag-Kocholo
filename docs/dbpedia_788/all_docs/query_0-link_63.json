        "text": "The Recruiting Class of 2001\n\n:osu: The Ohio State University Buckeyes' Recruiting Class of 2001 :osu:​\n\nOn January 18, 2001, Jim Tressel was hired to replace John Cooper as the head football coach of The Ohio State University. Coming onto the scene just two weeks before Signing Day, Coach Tressel did not have much time to engage in recruiting, but he was for the most part able to hold together the class started by John Cooper (especially securing shaky commitments from Rivals 100 prospects Dustin Fox and Angelo Chattams), and he did add a few very key recruits of his own, namely Chris Gamble, Mike Nugent, Lydell Ross, Maurice Hall, and Marcus Green.\n\nAlthough it was well-regarded on Signing Day (as are most Ohio State recruiting classes), in retrospect, the class of 2001 was largely forgettable, with many busts and underachievers. However, it did contain two of the all-time greatest Buckeyes, wide receiver/cornerback/return man Chris Gamble and place kicker Mike Nugent, each of whom played a crucial role in Ohio State's 2002 national championship run.\n\nQuarterback\n\nOhio State did not sign a quarterback in the recruiting class of 2001.\n\nRunning Back\n\nThe Buckeyes signed three top running back prospects in 2001, Maurice Hall (Columbus Brookhaven; Rivals 4*, #10 RB, #59 overall; Scout NR), Lydell Ross (Tampa Gaither; Rivals 4*, #26 RB; Scout NR), and JaJa Riley (San Diego Mission Bay; Rivals 3*, #68 RB; Scout NR), but none of them really panned out at Ohio State.\n\nLydell Ross committed to Notre Dame two weeks before Signing Day, but then at the last minute switched over to Ohio State. Ross exhibited promise early in his career, as he rushed for 419 yards and 6 touchdowns as a true freshman (including 124 yards against Indiana), and he seemed ready to take over for senior Jonathan Wells. But the arrival of Maurice Clarett in 2002 curtailed Lydell's development, and he was never able to re-establish himself even after Clarett's abrupt departure prior to the 2003 season. As he matured, Ross put on weight, which reduced his speed and agility (which weren't all that great to begin with), and rendered him strictly a between the tackles runner. For his career, Ross rushed for 2,339 yards (16th in Ohio State history) and 26 touchdowns on 596 carries (for a paltry 3.92 average).\n\nUnlike Lydell Ross, Maurice Hall was never given the opportunity to become a featured back, and he had most of his success as a kick returner (a Buckeye record 1,642 yards on 72 returns for a 22.8 average, but no touchdowns). As a running back, Hall had 974 yards and 6 touchdowns on 236 carries (for a similarly skimpy 4.13 average). Maurice will best be remembered as the player who scored the winning touchdowns against both Illinois (in overtime) and Michigan to preserve a perfect regular season in 2002 and send the Buckeyes to the national championship game against the Miami Hurricanes. For his Buckeye career, Hall had 2,681 all-purpose yards (25th best at Ohio State) and 6 total touchdowns.\n\nA team never needs to sign three running backs in one recruiting class, and the third guy will always be a prime candidate to transfer. In this class, JaJa Riley was the third guy, and he lasted just two years (redshirt in 2001, 12 carries for 44 yards in 2002) before heading out west to UNLV, where he didn't find any more success than he found in Columbus. Ironically, Riley probably would have seen plenty of action for the Buckeyes in 2003, as injuries and ineptitude forced the staff to play true freshman defensive back Ira Guilford at tailback.\n\nFullback Brandon Schnittker (Sandusky Perkins; Rivals NR; Scout NR) made only four starts in four years, and had only 23 carries for 60 yards and 2 touchdowns. He is best remembered as a lead blocker, and for his 15-yard reception during the game-winning drive against Michigan in 2002, a beautiful leaping one-handed grab of a pass intended for Michael Jenkins.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-3/4*); Lydell Ross (4*); Maurice Hall (4*); Brandon Schnittker (NR); JaJa Riley (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-1/4*); Lydell Ross (3*); Maurice Hall (3*); Brandon Schnittker (2-1/2*); JaJa Riley (0*)​\n\nReceiver\n\nWhen he signed with Ohio State, Chris Gamble (Fort Lauderdale Dillard; Rivals 2*, #89 WR; Scout NR) was a little known wide receiver prospect from south Florida. And at Ohio State, Gamble had marginal success at the wide receiver position, catching just 40 passes for 609 yards (15.2 average) and no touchdowns. His greater fame came on the defensive side of the ball, where he was a natural at cornerback - Chris first played the position in game four of the 2002 season (against Cincinnati), and he made an interception on his first play.\n\nAfter injuries decimated the Buckeyes' defensive backfield during the middle of the 2002 campaign, Gamble became the team's starting cornerback (replacing Richard McNutt - remember him?), and he also remained a starting wide receiver, thus becoming the first Buckeye two-way player in decades (and the best since Hopalong Cassady in the mid-1950's); to complete his Superman role, Chris also returned punts and kicks on special teams. Chris finished the 2002 season with 548 yards from scrimmage, 586 return yards, 24 tackles, and four interceptions, and he registered some of the biggest plays of the year: a 43-yard touchdown run against Indiana, a 57-yard pass reception against Miami in the Fiesta Bowl (the Buckeyes' longest pass play of the season), the game-winning 40-yard pick six against Penn State, and game-saving interceptions against Purdue, Cincinnati, and Wisconsin. For his titanic efforts, Gamble was honored as a first team All Big Ten player, a second team All American, and Buckeye co-MVP (along with quarterback Craig Krenzel).\n\nAs a junior in 2003, Chris played almost exclusively on defense, where he made 41 tackles and picked off three more passes, and generally shut down one half of the field. However, Gamble's most memorable play of the season was a negative one, when he bit on a double move and gave up a 79-yard touchdown to Lee Evans in a 17-10 loss to Wisconsin, which ended the Buckeyes' 19-game winning streak. Although Chris had a fine season overall in 2003 - he was once again selected as a first team All Big Ten player - he didn't provide any of the magical moments that seemed to be so routine during the 2002 national championship run.\n\nGamble is a very difficult player to rate, as he was a complete non-factor as a freshman (170 all-purpose yards), had a monumental sophomore season, fell back to mere greatness as a junior, and then skipped his senior season to turn pro. His career numbers are not all that spectacular - 65 tackles, 7 interceptions, 21 passes broken up, 1,568 all-purpose yards, and 2 touchdowns - but in the highly-specialized game of modern football, he was able to excel in all three aspects, offense, defense, and special teams. The verdict: Four-and-a-half stars for succeeding at a high level in a unique role.\n\nGamble declared early for the NFL, and he was a first round selection in the 2004 draft as a cornerback. Chris has been a starting cornerback for the Carolina Panthers for the past eight seasons, with career totals of 493 tackles, 27 interceptions, 51 passes broken up, and a pair of pick sixes.\n\nChris Vance (Fort Meyers, Florida; Fort Scott Community College; Rivals 4* JUCO; Scout NR) was a rare junior college signee for Ohio State. After catching 80 passes for 1,286 yards and 15 touchdowns in his two years at Fort Scott, Vance was one of the top JUCO players in the country. Chris had a very nice season his first year in Columbus, as he collected 34 passes for 605 yards (17.8 average) and 4 touchdowns; but he had a disappointing follow up in 2002, when he caught only 13 passes for 178 yards (13.7 average) and 3 touchdowns in his second and final season at Ohio State. Despite having relatively few chances, Vance was a big play receiver who had four touchdown receptions of over 30 yards, including a 61-yarder against Akron in 2001. His career numbers: 47 receptions for 783 yards (16.7 average) and 7 touchdowns.\n\nThe other wide receiver signed in 2001 was actually the most highly touted of the three prospects. Angelo Chattams (Dayton Chaminade Julienne; Rivals 4*, #9 WR, #67 overall; Scout NR) was generally considered one of the top high school players in the state of Ohio, and he was favorably compared to Joey Galloway. But Angelo got into some legal trouble (he was arrested for stealing a set of golf clubs in 2002), and then he suffered a career-ending spine injury the following year. He had only two pass receptions for 26 yards as a Buckeye; however, he did graduate from Ohio State in 2006.\n\nTight end Ryan Hamby (Cincinnati Moeller; Rivals 2*, #45 TE; Scout NR) is best known for dropping the potential game-winning pass against the Texas Longhorns in 2005, a miscue which many fans believe cost the Buckeyes a shot at a national championship that year. Ryan did, however, manage to catch 45 other passes for 482 yards (10.7 average) and 5 touchdowns for his Ohio State career. A marginal player who would be long-forgotten but for his infamous drop.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Chris Gamble (2*); Chris Vance (4*); Angelo Chattams (4*); Ryan Hamby (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3*); Chris Gamble (4-1/2*); Chris Vance (3*); Angelo Chattams (1*); Ryan Hamby (3*)​\n\nOffensive Line\n\nThis was clearly the weakest group for the class of 2001. Adam Olds (Dublin Coffman; Rivals 4*, #27 OL; Scout NR) was a promising prospect, but his career was cut short due to chronic injuries, most notably a congenital hip condition; he redshirted in 2001, sat out 2002 due to hip surgery, played limited minutes in 2003, and then underwent a second hip surgery after that season which prevented him from returning to the team. Adam was Academic All Big Ten in 2002 and 2003.\n\nRyan Cook (Martinsville, Indiana; Rivals 2*, #87 OL; Scout NR) was a reach, saw little if any action through two years, and transferred somewhere prior to the 2003 season (I have not been able to determine where he ended up).\n\nAndree Tyree (London; Rivals 2*, #58 TE; Scout NR) had little success on either side of the ball (offensive line, defensive line, linebacker) until the final game of his Ohio State career, the 2005 contest against Michigan, where as a blocking tight end he played like a turbocharged steam roller, flattening Wolverines on almost every snap (especially on Antonio Pittman's game-winning touchdown run, where he literally collapsed the entire right side of the Wolverine defensive line). That one game was good enough to earn him a letter and a place in the hearts of Buckeye fans everywhere.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (2-3/4*); Adam Olds (4*); Ryan Cook (2*); Andree Tyree (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1*); Adam Olds (1*); Ryan Cook (0*); Andree Tyree (2*)​\n\nDefensive Line\n\nThe Buckeyes signed four defensive lineman in the class of 2001, and two of them were solid contributors. Simon Fraser (Upper Arlington; Rivals 4*, #7 DE, #75 overall; Scout NR) started out slow as the back-up for All American defensive end Will Smith, but by his senior season (2004) he was a full-time starter and a team captain. For his career, Fraser had 62 tackles, 17 TFL's, 7 sacks, and 10 batted passes. Simon had a brief stint in the NFL as an undrafted free agent.\n\nMarcus Green (Louisville (KY) Male; Rivals 3*, #85 OL; Scout NR) was a big defensive tackle who became a two-year starter for the Buckeyes. Primarily a run stuffer, Green finished his career with 86 tackles, 7.5 TFL's, and 3 sacks. Like Fraser, Green was also an undrafted free agent in the NFL.\n\nThe third signee had the most interesting Buckeye career, albeit the least productive. Redgie Arden (Ironton; Rivals 5*, #7 LB, #54 overall; Scout NR) was originally signed as a linebacker prospect, but quickly outgrew the position. After a redshirt season, Arden saw spot action at defensive line (3 tackles) and tight end (4 receptions for 50 yards), but most of his exploits occurred off of the field - he was twice arrested for drunk driving and then got pummeled in a bar fight by some Marshall football players prior to the start of the 2004 season. That last incident effectively ended Arden's Buckeye career, and ensured that he would be one of the more colorful busts in Ohio State history.\n\nQuinton Thomas (Fort Lauderdale Dillard; Rivals 2*, #90 DE; Scout NR) signed a Letter of Intent with Ohio State, but failed to gain admission. Thomas spent a year at a junior college and then walked on to the Arkansas State football team. Quinton eventually earned a scholarship from the Red Wolves, and he recorded 53 tackles and 3 sacks in his final two seasons combined.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Simon Fraser (4*); Marcus Green (3*); Reggie Arden (5*); Quinton Thomas (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-3/4*); Simon Fraser (3-1/2*); Marcus Green (3*); Reggie Arden (0*); Quinton Thomas (0*)\n\n​\n\nLinebacker\n\nThe two linebacker recruits for the class of 2001 - Andree Tyree and Reggie Arden - ended up switching positions, and they are rated elsewhere (Tyree with the offensive line, Arden with the defensive line).\n\nDefensive Backs\n\nWide receiver Chris Gamble turned out to be the best defensive back recruit in this class (and one of the all-time great Buckeyes), but cornerback Dustin Fox (Canton Glen Oak; Rivals 4*, #5 S, #82 overall; Scout NR) was a solid performer during his four years in Columbus. Fox started 37 of 47 games, and recorded 217 tackles, 7 interceptions, and 30 PBU's during his Buckeye career. As a senior, Dustin was a team captain and earned second team All Big Ten honors. Fox played mostly at cornerback out of necessity, although he was probably better suited to play safety; by playing out of position, Fox certainly helped out his team, but he hurt his reputation amongst Buckeye fans, who routinely ripped him both for playing soft coverage and for getting beat deep. After he left Ohio State, Fox was selected in the third round of the 2005 NFL draft; he bounced around the NFL for four seasons, logging eight tackles in just twelve games. Currently, Dustin co-hosts a sports talk radio show on 92.3 The Fan in Cleveland.\n\nLeAndre Boone (Herndon, Virginia; Rivals NR; Scout NR) was literally a last minute addition to the Buckeyes' class of 2001, as he signed just days before the opening of fall camp. Boone did very little in two years at Ohio State, and then he transferred to Hampton University, where he was diagnosed with a career-ending heart condition after just one game.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4*); Dustin Fox (4*); LeAndre Boone (NR)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-3/4*); Dustin Fox (3-1/2*); LeAndre Boone (0*)\n\n​\n\nSpecialists\n\nJim Tressel always believed in expending scholarships on kicking specialists, and in his initial recruiting class he signed place kicker Mike Nugent (Centerville; Rivals 2*, #8 PK; Scout NR) . Although fans never like to \"waste\" a scholarship on a kicker, I think that every member of the Buckeye Nation would agree that Nugent was well worth the investment - during his Ohio State career, Mike connected on a school record 72 field goals in 88 attempts, for a success rate of .818, another Buckeye record. Nugent's accomplishment is even more remarkable when you consider that he made only six of his first thirteen field goal attempts, and then finished his career by connecting on 66 of 75 tries (.880 success rate). Mike was an All American in 2002 (25 of 28 FG's, for a .893 success rate, which is an Ohio State single season record), had an \"off\" season in 2003 (16 of 19 FG's, for a .842 success rate, which is fifth best in school history), and was again selected as an All American in 2004 (24 of 27 FG's, for a .889 success rate, which is second best in school history); he also won the Lou Groza Award as the nation's best college kicker in 2004. Not only was Nugent extremely accurate (a school record 24 consecutive field goals during the 2001 and 2002 seasons), but he also had a big leg, as he connected on a school record eight field goals of fifty yards or more in just nine attempts (an incredible .889 success rate); he had a pair of 55-yard field goals, which were the second longest in school history. Nugent left Ohio State (and still remains) the program's all-time leading scorer with 356 points (72 FG, 140 XP). Simply the greatest place kicker in Ohio State history, and no one else is even close.\n\nRivals rankings: Group 2*); Mike Nugent (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (5*); Mike Nugent (5*)​\n\nWalk-Ons and Transfers\n\nOffensive lineman Mike Kne (Cleveland St. Ignatius; Rivals NR; Scout NR) helped lead the Wildcats to a state championship in 1999, played at Division I-AA Fordham as a true freshman in 2000, and then transferred to Ohio State. Kne redshirted in 2001, but saw action in over thirty games throughout the remainder of his career (including several starts); Mike earned himself a scholarship prior to the 2003 season. One of the more important walk-ons during the Tressel regime, Mike was a three-star performer at Ohio State.\n\nCornerback Chris Conwell (Shaker Heights; Rivals NR; Scout NR) signed with Youngstown State in their class of 1999, and then followed Jim Tressel to Ohio State in 2001. After sitting out a year, Conwell walked-on to the Buckeye squad in 2002, and he promptly led the team to a national title. Well, not quite, but Chris did play in all fourteen games that year, spent some time in the two-deep, and made valuable contributions on special teams (eight tackles).\n\nDefensive back Rob Harley (Elmhurst (IL) York Community; Rivals NR; Scout NR) is best known as being the nephew of Buckeye legend Chic Harley. Rob walked on to the Ohio State squad in 2001, saw limited action during the 2002 national championship season, and then earned letters in each of his last three years (6 tackles combined). Harley currently works as an assistant coach for Ohio Dominican University.\n\nThe LJB Ratings for the Class of 2001 (18 signees, 2.11* average)\n\n5.0* Mike Nugent\n\n4.5* Chris Gamble\n\n4.0*\n\n3.5* Simon Fraser; Dustin Fox\n\n3.0* Lydell Ross; Maurice Hall; Chris Vance; Ryan Hamby; Marcus Green\n\n2.5* Brandon Schnittker\n\n2.0* Andree Tyree\n\n1.0* Angelo Chattams; Adam Olds\n\n0.0* JaJa Riley; Ryan Cook; Redgie Arden; Quinton Thomas; LeAndre Boone\n\nA small class of just eighteen signees that produced two superstars (Nugent and Gamble) and several solid contributors (Fox, Hall, Ross, Hamby, Fraser, Green, and Vance), all of whom played valuable roles in the 2002 national championship season. However, over a third of the class busted out, and with the exception of the two superstar performers, it often seemed that the rest of this class received playing time less for their own talent than for the lack of talent around them. This dearth of talent became evident in 2004, when this class was juniors and seniors - the Buckeyes plodded their way through a mediocre 8-4 season that was redeemed only by the late season heroics of quarterback Troy Smith (class of 2002) and Teddy Ginn (class of 2004); the emergence of running back Antonio Pittman (class of 2004) and wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez (class of 2003); and solid defensive performances from A.J. Hawk, Bobby Carpenter, Quinn Pitcock, Nate Salley, Donte Whitner, and Ashton Youboty (all from the classes of 2002 and 2003); all of which culminated in a dramatic upset of Michigan in the regular season finale and a victory in the Alamo Bowl. While the class of 2001 laid a few foundation stones, the Tressel dynasty was really built on the outstanding recruiting class that followed it - the much heralded class of 2002.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nAlthough Coach Tressel did a nice job of holding the class of 2001 together, he did lose a few commitments down the stretch. Massive defensive tackle Alphonso Townsend (Lima Senior; Fork Union Military School; Rivals ?; Scout NR) originally signed with Ohio State as part of the class of 2000, but he failed to meet admission requirements and, like several other Buckeyes before and since, he took a post-grad year at Fork Union. Even though Townsend had no obligation to re-sign with Ohio State in 2001, it was generally assumed that he would do so, and he even remained committed to the Buckeyes right up until Signing Day. But of course, Alphonso did not stick with Ohio State, and instead went to play for Michigan State. After a redshirt year in 2001, Townsend saw some action in 2002 (13 tackles and a sack), but then disappeared. Alphonso briefly re-emerged in 2005 as a transfer to Division II North Alabama, but he never actually made it down there, citing personal problems back home. Townsend was last seen as a member of the Lima Warriors semi-pro football team.\n\nAnother defensive tackle who originally committed to Ohio State but ended up at Michigan State was Brandon McKinney (Dayton Chaminade-Julienne; Rivals ?; Scout NR). Although McKinney was certainly no star player, he did at least have a serviceable career with the Spartans, as he logged 93 tackles and 2.5 sacks. Brandon has been a journeyman player in the NFL for the past seven seasons (60 tackles in 61 games played).\n\nDefensive back Jacob Stewart (Ypsilanti, Michigan; Rivals ?; Scout NR) was another Cooper commitment who ended up jumping ship after Ohio State hired Jim Tressel. Stewart ended up signing with Michigan, where he went on to have a typically illustrious career (27 tackles, 2 interceptions).\n\nThe Recruiting Class of 2002\n\n:osu: The Ohio State University Buckeyes' Recruiting Class of 2002 :osu:​\n\nJim Tressel's first full recruiting class at Ohio State was one of epic proportions. At the time, the young Buckeyes were ranked as a top-five class in the country (#5 by Rivals, #3 by Scout). The class consisted primarily of Ohioans (18 of the 25 signees were in-state), but two of the out-of-state prospects made a big impact at Ohio State (Santonio Holmes and Nate Salley, both Floridians). The class was well-balanced in terms of position, and most of the signees eventually provided some contribution to the team. No less than four of the recruits were named first team All Americans (Troy Smith, A.J. Hawk, Nick Mangold, Quinn Pitcock), four were NFL first round draft choices (Hawk, Mangold, Santonio Holmes, Bobby Carpenter), and eight others were drafted in lower rounds (Smith, Pitcock, Rob Sims, Roy Hall, Nate Salley, Maurice Clarett, Doug Datish, Jay Richardson). This class helped to win a national championship in 2002, had a 4-1 record in bowl games, and a 3-1 record in BCS bowls; on the down side, however, this class might best be remembered for its major role in the Debacle in the Desert, and three 2002 signees were at the center of NCAA investigations (Troy Smith, Maurice Clarett, Derek Morris).\n\nQuarterback\n\nWhen the Bucks signed Elite 11 quarterbacks Justin Zwick (Massillon Washington; Rivals 4*, #3 pro-style QB, #40 overall; Scout 4*, #14 QB) and Troy Smith (Cleveland Glenville; Rivals 4*, #12 dual-threat QB; Scout 4*, #15 QB) in 2002, it seemed that the team would be set at the helm for a title run in 2005 or 2006, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nIn rating the two quarterbacks, let's get the easy part over with first: Justin Zwick was a good back-up at Ohio State. In other words, he was a major disappointment, considering the fact that he was one of the true headliners for the class of 2002. Zwick compiled a record of 5-4 as a starting quarterback (including a victory in the 2004 Alamo Bowl), and for his career he completed 158 of 276 passes (.572 completion percentage) for 1,779 yards, with 7 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. Buckeye fans knew right from the start that one of the two Elite 11 quarterbacks would be reduced to a back-up role, we just didn't anticipate that Zwick would be that guy.\n\nNow, for the more complex analysis, namely Troy Smith. Years from now, will people remember Troy Smith, the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner, as the greatest quarterback in Ohio State history, or will they remember him as yet another talented Buckeye signal caller (Cornelius Greene, Art Schlichter, Bobby Hoying, Joe Germaine) who couldn't quite get the job done? In his final two seasons, Troy led the Buckeyes to a combined record of 22-3 (#4 finish in 2005, #2 finish in 2006), with the only losses coming to Texas (13-0, #1 in 2005), Penn State (11-1, #3 in 2005), and Florida (13-1, #1 in 2006). In other words, the three losses suffered by the 2005-06 Buckeyes came at the hands of teams whose combined record was 37-2 (a .949 winning percentage); and two of those three losses were to the eventual national champion. Add in three straight wins against Michigan (including a career-defining 386-yard performance in the 2004 Game, the fourth best in Buckeye history, the best against Michigan), a shared Big Ten title in 2005, an outright Big Ten title in 2006, and the aforementioned Heisman Trophy, plus numerous records, highlight reel plays, and hall of fame stats, and Troy Smith simply has to be considered the best Buckeye quarterback ever, right?\n\nOr does he? The Troy Smith Buckeyes were about as close to great as a team can get without being truly great. Championships are still the ultimate measure of greatness, and Troy did not lead Ohio State to the promised land, despite a phenomenal supporting cast (seven first-round picks in the 2006 and 2007 NFL drafts combined). Troy's off-the-field issues at the end of the 2004 season (a two-game suspension for taking cash from a booster) was one of the primary reasons that the Buckeyes got off to a slow start in 2005, with close losses to Texas and Penn State; and his apparent lack of preparation and poor conditioning were factors in the BCS title game fiasco in January of 2007 (4 of 14 passing for 35 yards and an interception; 20 rushes for -29 yards and a fumble lost; 34 total plays for 6 total yards and two turnovers; in a 41-14 drubbing at the hands of the Florida Gators).\n\nOf course, Troy's career numbers are impressive, especially considering that he started only 28 games, and barely played in 14 others (just 17 passes attempted in those games in those games in which he did not start): 420 completions (7th best at Ohio State) in 670 attempts for a .627 completion percentage (2nd best at Ohio State), 5,720 yards (6th best at Ohio State), 54 touchdowns (4th best at Ohio State), and just 13 interceptions (his 4.15 TD/INT ratio is the best in Ohio State history); plus 1,168 yards and 14 touchdowns rushing; for 6,888 total yards (4th best at Ohio State) and 68 total touchdowns (3rd best at Ohio State).\n\nOn the whole, Troy's positives far outweigh his negatives, but those negatives certainly impacted Ohio State at inopportune moments. The verdict? Five stars, with an asterisk.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4*); Troy Smith (4*); Justin Zwick (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Troy Smith (4*); Justin Zwick (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3-3/4*); Troy Smith (5*) (with an asterisk); Justin Zwick (2-1/2*)​\n\nRunning Back\n\nUpon signing superstar Maurice Clarett (Warren Harding; Rivals 5*, #1 FB, #37 overall; Scout 5*, #5 RB, #26 overall), the Bucks looked to be set at running back for at least three seasons. In fact, as a true freshman, MoC made an immediate impact for the Buckeyes. In the season opener against Texas Tech, Clarett rushed for 175 yards on just 21 carries and scored three touchdowns, including bursts of 59 yards and 45 yards. In week three against a top-ten Washington State squad, Maurice rushed for 230 yards (sixth best at Ohio State) and two more touchdowns. Clarett missed the week four game against Cincinnati due to injury, and then posted four straight 100-yard games before injuries once again took their toll - Clarett would miss two more games and see limited action in two others before finishing the regular season strong with a 119-yard effort against Michigan. In the subsequent national championship game against Miami, the Hurricanes focused their defensive efforts on stopping Clarett, and he was held to just 47 yards on 22 carries; however, he did score a pair of touchdowns, including the game winner in double overtime, and he made perhaps the biggest play of the contest when he stripped the ball from Miami defensive back Sean Taylor after an interception. For his rookie campaign, Clarett put up some great numbers - a Buckeye freshman record 1,237 yards rushing (the 15th best season in Ohio State history), 104 yards receiving, and 18 total touchdowns in just 11 games - and he was arguably the most an important component of Ohio State's 2002 national championship team.\n\nWhile Reecie seemed destined for Buckeye greatness, he left the program in infamy (and in the midst of a prolonged NCAA investigation) after just one tremendous season; his subsequent fall from grace and eventual redemption are well-documented on BuckeyePlanet and elsewhere, but his journey included a year-long suspension from Ohio State for taking extra benefits, a New York Times expose', a lawsuit against the National Football League, a 4.82 forty time at the 2005 NFL combine, a surprising third round selection by the Denver Broncos in the 2005 NFL draft, a not-so-surprising release from the Broncos during the 2005 preseason, a pair of arrests in 2006, a four-year stint in jail, and finally a return to football with the Omaha Nighthawks of the UFL, a re-enrollment as a student at Ohio State, and a reconciliation with Jim Tressel.\n\nAlthough it was bad enough that the Buckeyes lost Clarett immediately after he led them to a national championship, his premature departure was exacerbated by the fact that no one emerged to fill the void at running back in either 2003 or 2004. While Clarett himself averaged 112.5 yards per game, 5.60 yards per carry, and 1.45 touchdowns per game in 2002, the running back by committee in 2003 and 2004 (Lydell Ross, Maurice Hall, Branden Joe, Antonio Pittman, and Ira Guilford) averaged just 101.6 yards per game, 3.99 yards per carry, and .72 touchdowns per game. Of the cast of pretenders, Lydell Ross was the leading rusher, with 1,301 yards (59.1 yards per game) on 310 carries (4.20 yards per carry) and 14 touchdowns (.64 touchdowns per game) in those two seasons combined. The Buckeyes were not able to resurrect their running attack until the emergence of Antonio Pittman in 2005 (1,331 yards, 5.5 yards per carry, 7 touchdowns).\n\nMaurice Clarett was certainly one of the most talented Buckeyes ever (and that's saying a lot), and he led the team to a national championship as a true freshman ... but off-the-field issues curtailed a hall-of-fame career. Five stars as a freshman, zero stars thereafter, two-and-a-half stars overall.\n\nStan White, Jr. (Baltimore Gilman; Rivals 4*, # 18 OLB; Scout 4*, #9 TE) was a top linebacker prospect, but he played primarily fullback and H-back at Ohio State (11 receptions for 78 yards). He was a powerful run blocker, and his highlight Buckeye moment came on the game-winning touchdown in the 2005 Michigan game, when he trucked two Wolverine defenders with one block.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4-1/2*); Maurice Clarett (5*); Stan White, Jr. (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4-1/2*); Maurice Clarett (5*); Stan White, Jr. (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-1/2*); Maurice Clarett (2-1/2*); Stan White, Jr. (2-1/2*)​\n\nWide Receiver\n\nOne of the few perceived weaknesses of the recruiting class of 2002 was the wide receiver position, where the Bucks signed only two prospects, including the unheralded Santonio Holmes (Belle Glades (FL) Central; Rivals 3*, #38 WR; Scout 4*, #13 WR). After a red-shirt year, Holmes displayed questionable hands early in his freshman campaign, then suddenly blossomed into a star mid-way through the 2003 season (32 receptions, 549 yards, 17.2 average, 7 touchdowns). With the graduation of Michael Jenkins after the 2003 season, Santonio became Ohio State's \"go to\" receiver in 2004 (55 receptions, 769 yards, 14.0 average, 7 touchdowns) and 2005 (53 receptions, 977 yards, 18.4 average, 11 touchdowns). For his three-season Buckeye career, Holmes had 140 receptions (fifth all-time at Ohio State) and 2,295 yards (fifth all time) for a 16.4 average (eleventh all time) and 25 touchdowns (third all time), with 8 of those touchdowns being over 40 yards, including two of greater than 80 yards (85 yards against Notre Dame in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl, the second longest pass play in Ohio State history and a Fiesta Bowl record; 80 yards against Marshall in 2004, tied for fourth longest in team history). In a game against Marshall in 2004, Holmes had 224 yards receiving, one of the four 200-yard games in Buckeye history, and the second highest single game total. Holmes was also good return man, with 810 return yards (385 on punts, 425 on kicks) and a 63-yard punt return for a touchdown against Northwestern in 2004. Holmes amassed 3,123 all-purpose yards, which puts him in 15th place at Ohio State. Santonio was a great, nearly legendary, Buckeye performer who has continued his success in the NFL: In six seasons since being selected in the first round of the 2006 draft, he has 338 receptions for 5,235 yards (15.5 average) and 34 touchdowns, and he was named the MVP of Super Bowl XLIII.\n\nOn the other hand, junior Roy Hall (Lyndhurst Brush; Rivals 4*, #19 WR; Scout 4*, #24 WR) was an unqualified disappointment. Billed as the next David Boston, Hall was virtually invisible on the field, where his career stats were 52 receptions for 580 yards and 3 touchdowns, which really aren't very good numbers for a single season. Despite his lack of production, Hall showed enough size (6' 2\", 229 pounds) and raw athleticism (4.41 forty, 4.13 shuttle, 38\" vertical, 19 bench reps) in post-season work-outs that the Indianapolis Colts selected him in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL draft. As an athlete, Roy Hall will largely be remembered as the guy who body checked LeBron James to the floor in a high school basketball game, and who broke Ted Ginn's foot during an endzone celebration at the beginning of the 2006 BCS title game.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Santonio Holmes (3*); Roy Hall (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Santonio Holmes (4*); Roy Hall (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Santonio Holmes (4-1/2*); Roy Hall (2-1/2*)​\n\nOffensive Line\n\nWith five quality signees, four of whom turned out to be at least solid multi-year starters, the offensive line was the cornerstone of the class of 2002. Derek Morris (Rivals 5*, #2 OT, #24 overall; Scout 5*, #6 OL) was the rare Signing Day surprise in OSU's favor: not only was Derek a consensus high school All-American, but he also came from North Carolina, not exactly a pipeline of talent to Columbus. However, Morris was the subject of some recruiting irregularities (courtesy of offensive line coach Jim Bollman), and Ohio State released him from his Letter of Intent before he ever became a part of the football program. Derek eventually signed with North Carolina State in 2003, and he had a mediocre career for the Wolfpack.\n\nNick Mangold (Kettering Alter; Rivals 4*, #3 OC; Scout NR) was a three-year starter (33 starts in 45 games, all at center), and he became an All American as a senior and a first round selection in the 2006 NFL draft. Since being drafted by the New York Jets, Mangold has been selected to four Pro Bowls (2008-2011). At a school that has a long history of producing quality centers - Tom DeLeone, Steve Myers, Kirk Lowdermilk, Jeff Uhlenhake, LeCharles Bentley, Michael Brewster - Nick Mangold was arguably the best of the bunch.\n\nRob Sims (Northfield Nordonia; Rivals 4*, #20 OG; Scout 3*, #38 OL) was a four-year starter for the Buckeyes (40 starts in 47 games, at left tackle and left guard). Sims was a first team All Big Ten selection as a senior and a fourth round selection in the 2006 draft; Rob is still playing in the NFL, and he has started 66 games over the past six seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and the Detroit Lions.\n\nDoug Datish (Warren Howland; Rivals 4*, #6 OT; Scout 3*, #43 OL) was a versatile lineman who started for three years (35 starts in 41 games, at center, left guard, and left tackle). As a fifth-year senior in 2006, he was named All Big Ten first team as a center, and he became a sixth round selection in the 2007 NFL draft.\n\nT.J. Downing (Canton Glen Oak; Rivals 3*, #35 OG; Scout 2*, #121 OL) got off to a slow start, but he became a starter over his final two seasons (24 starts at right guard), and he was named to the All Big Ten first team as a senior in 2006; Downing entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2007.\n\nR.J. Coleman (Clarksburg (WV) Robert C. Byrd; Rivals 4*, #6 TE; Scout 4*, #7 TE) and Tim Schafer (Upper Arlington; Rivals 4*, #12 SDE; Scout #21 DE) were moved to the offensive line in order to provide some much-needed depth, although neither saw any significant action during their respective careers; Schafer managed to earn five starts at right tackles in 2004, but Coleman had his playing days cut short due to a chronic \"stinger\" condition.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4*); Nick Mangold (4*); Rob Sims (4*); Doug Datish (4*); T.J.

After a red-shirt year (forced on him due to off-the-field issues), Pitcock showed flashes of brilliance during his career, and he finally developed into an All American as a senior in 2006, recording 39 tackles, 12 TFL's, and 8 sacks. Despite the accolades, however, Quinn still had a rather spotty senior campaign - five of his eight sacks came in just two contests, and he didn't do much to control the line of scrimmage against either Michigan or Florida, games in which the Buckeye defense gave up 39 and 41 points, respectively. Pitcock's careers totals include 133 tackles, 27.5 TFL's, 14 sacks (tied for 15th all time at Ohio State), and 1 interception, and he was selected in the third round of the 2007 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts. After his rookie season in the NFL, Pitcock unexpectedly retired, citing depression and an addiction to video games. Quinn attempted to re-enter the NFL in 2010, but he has been unsuccessful to date. A four-star Buckeye career ... barely.\n\nDespite battling illness and injury throughout his time in Columbus, Mike Kudla (Medina Highland; Rivals 4*, #18 SDE; Scout 5*, #2 DE, #49 overall) had a solid if not spectacular Buckeye career: 19 starts, 90 tackles, 20 TFL's, 14.5 sacks (tied for 13th best at Ohio State), and a fumble recovery for a touchdown against Purdue in 2003. Mike finished strong, being named a first team All Big Ten performer for the 2005 season before lighting it up in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl victory over Notre Dame (7 tackles, Fiesta Bowl record 3 sacks). Kulda had a cup of coffee in the NFL as an undrafted free agent, graduated from Ohio State in 2008, and now is a State Farm agent in Twinsburg, Ohio.\n\nJay Richardson (Dublin Scioto; Rivals 3*, #32 SDE; Scout NR) accomplished very little on the gridiron until his redshirt senior season (he had issues with motor and motivation), but during his Buckeye finale he made 25 tackles, 8.5 TFL's, 4 sacks, and 7 pass deflections, upping his career totals to 52 tackles, 12.5 TFL's, 7 sacks, and 9 passed deflections. Based primarily on his breakout senior season, Jay was selected in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL draft; he spent four years in the NFL, earning 22 starts in 55 games (117 tackles, 7 sacks).\n\nJoel Penton (Van Wert; Rivals 3*, #41 SDE; Scout 3*, #37 DE) was a career back-up (46 tackles, 7 TFL's, 2 sacks, fumble recovery), but I give him an extra half star for winning the 2006 Wuerffel Trophy, which is awarded to the college football player who who best combines exemplary community service with athletic and academic achievement.\n\nAs mentioned above, Tim Schafer signed as a defensive lineman but was moved to the offensive line, and he is rated with that position group.\n\nOverall, this was the strongest defensive line class in the Tressel era, with an All American, an All Big Ten selection, a part-time starter, a valuable role player, and most importantly, no busts.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Quinn Pitcock (4*); Mike Kudla (4*); Jay Richardson (3*); Joel Penton (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Quinn Pitcock (4*); Mike Kudla (5*); Jay Richardson (NR); Joel Penton (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Quinn Pitcock (4*); Mike Kudla (3-1/2*); Jay Richardson (3*); Joel Penton (3*)\n\n​\n\nLinebacker\n\nThe Buckeyes signed the best linebacker class in the country in 2002, and that unit certainly met its high expectations. A.J. Hawk (Centerville; Rivals 3*, #30 OLB; Scout 3*, #32 LB) was the lowest-ranked member of the group, yet he was a two-time All-American and the winner of the 2005 Lombardi Award. For his Buckeye career, Hawk had 394 tackles (fifth all time at Ohio State), 41 TFL's (eighth all time at Ohio State), 15.5 sacks (twelfth all time at Ohio State), 7 interceptions, and 2 touchdowns (interception return, blocked punt). Hawk was the fifth player selected in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, and he has continued his success with Green Bay - A.J. he has been a regular member of the Packers' starting defense (91 starts in 94 games), averaging nearly 100 tackles per season.\n\nBobby Carpenter (Lancaster; Rivals 4*, #13 OLB; Scout 4*, #22 LB) was consistently solid and often spectacular over his Buckeye career, as he finished with 191 tackles, 23.5 TFL's, 14.5 sacks (tied for 13th best at Ohio State), 3 interceptions, and 7 deflected passes. Against Michigan State in 2005, Bobby tied the Buckeyes' single-game record with four sacks. Carpenter was selected in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys, but he has had a rough time in the NFL, with only ten starts in six seasons (165 tackles and a pick six to his credit).\n\nMike D'Andrea (Avon Lake; Rivals 5*, #2 ILB, #29 overall; Scout 5*, #2 LB, #12 overall) was arguably the biggest name of this huge recruiting class, but he turned out to be one of the few busts of the 2002 signees. Throughout his Buckeye career, D'Andrea was injury-prone and he never looked comfortable in his few opportunities at middle linebacker; he finished with just 44 tackles, 6.5 TFL's, and 1 sack in three years, and he lost his entire senior season due to injury.\n\nStan White, Jr. was a high school linebacker who moved around quite a bit before ending up as a fullback, and he is rated with the running backs.\n\nThis linebacking corps did end up with a five-star player (Hawk), but he was just a three-star recruit, while the five-star recruit (D'Andrea) simply didn't pan out.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4*); Mike D'Andrea (5*); Bobby Carpenter (4*); A.J. Hawk (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Mike D'Andrea (5*); Bobby Carpenter (4*); A.J. Hawk (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3-3/4*); Mike D'Andrea (2*); Bobby Carpenter (4*); A.J. Hawk (5*)\n\n​\n\nDefensive Back\n\nOhio State signed five defensive backs in the class of 2002. The headliner of the group was safety Nate Salley (Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas; Rivals 4*, #7 S; Scout 4*, #19 S), and he almost lived up to his lofty billing. Nate was a three-year starter at free safety, and he put up some fairly impressive numbers (181 tackles, 3 INT's, 15 PBU's, and a blocked kick), but he never seemed to be a game-changing performer. Nate was selected in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL draft, and he spent three nondescript seasons with the Carolina Panthers (11 tackles in 24 games).\n\nTyler Everett (Canton McKinley; Rivals 3*, #23 S; Scout 4*, #16 S) was part-time starter, most-time reserve who sometimes played cornerback, other times played safety; from that description alone you can get the idea that Everett never really found himself at Ohio State (101 tackles, 3 INT's, 11 PBU's, 1 blocked kick, pick six). After his senior season, Tyler entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent (three games, no stats).\n\nBrandon Mitchell (Atlanta Mays; Rivals 3*, #35 S; Scout 4*, #26 S) was a back-up until he earned a starting slot at safety as a fifth-year senior, and he made the most of his opportunity, racking up some decent numbers: 60 tackles (4th on team); 4 TFL's; 2 interceptions. However, Mitchell was inconsistent at times, and never really became a leader of the defensive unit. Brandon will be remembered more for being a good student in the classroom (three time Academic All Big Ten) and a good character in the locker room. His career totals were 106 tackles, 5 TFL's, 5 INT's, 9 PBU's, and 2 TD's on interception returns.\n\nE.J. Underwood (Hamilton; Rivals 4*, #19 CB; Scout 4*, #13 CB) had a nice start to his Buckeye career (21 tackles and 3 PBU's as a true freshman), took a step back as a sophomore due to an injury (just 4 tackles in 6 games), rebounded as a junior (29 tackles and 1 PBU), but then ran into academic problems, and finally transferred to NAIA Pikeville College prior to the 2005 season. During his time in Columbus, Underwood recorded 54 tackles and 4 PBU's, and stuck around just long enough to earn two stars for his efforts.\n\nSpeedy Mike Roberts (Toronto Central Teck; Rivals 3*, #49 CB; Scout NR), the rare Canadian recruit, did very little in Columbus for four years (two tackles, zero letters), and then transferred to Indiana State, a 1-AA school in football, prior to the 2006 season. In his one season as a Sycamore, Roberts logged 31 tackles and 4 PBU's.\n\nThe defensive backs were not bad overall, but relatively speaking, this position group was definitely the most disappointing in the excellent class of 2002.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Nate Salley (4*); Tyler Everett (3*); Brandon Mitchell (3*); E.J.

A key special teams performer for two years (8 tackles in 2004, 6 tackles and a fumble recovery in 2005), as a fifth-year senior in 2006, Smith earned both a scholarship and a starting cornerback position. He capitalized on his opportunity by tallying 71 tackles (tied for second on the team), 10 TFL's (third on the team), and 2 interceptions (one returned for a touchdown), while earning first team All Big Ten honors. Smith always played with heart and passion, and he was an unexpected bonus to the recruiting class of 2002. If rated with the 2002 signees, Yao would merit 3-1/2 stars.\n\nDrew Norman (Gnadenhutten Indian Valley; Rivals NR; Scout NR) walked-on in 2002 and became the team's starting long snapper for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. As a redshirt senior, Norman won the Ike Kelley Award as the Buckeyes' outstanding special teams performer. Drew graduated with a degree in civil engineering.\n\nThe LJB Ratings for the Class of 2002 (25 signees, 3.02* average)\n\n5.0* Troy Smith; A.J.

Coleman; Mike Roberts\n\n0.0* Derek Morris\n\nThe numbers don't lie - four first team All Americans, four first-round draft choices, a Heisman, a Lombardi, a Wuerffel, four wins over Michigan, three Big Ten championships, one national title, and a 55-9 overall record (an .859 winning percentage). But the disappointment of the Debacle in the Desert to end the 2006 title run lingers in the background, an unfortunate taint on the class of 2002. This class had many bona fide stars - Hawk, Smith, Carpenter, Holmes, Mangold, Pitcock, Sims - and an equal number of solid performers - Datish, Downing, Richardson, Kudla, Salley, Mitchell, Everett. Most of the rest became role players who provided some contributions to the team - Zwick, White, Penton, Hall, Schafer. As with every class, there were a few busts - Morris, Coleman, Underwood, Roberts, D'Andrea. And then there is the enduring enigma that is Maurice Clarett. All in all, a great class that achieved great things, but should have been just a little bit greater.\n\nAdditional Notes - One of the first commitments to the class of 2002 was running back/linebacker Drushaun Humphrey (Toledo Rogers; Rivals NR; Scout NR), who was generally considered to be one of the top prospects in the state of Ohio and an all-around freak athlete. On April 30, 2001, soon after announcing his intention to attend Ohio State, Drushaun collapsed while playing basketball, and within minutes he was dead from an apparent heart attack. Although Humphrey's young life was cut short before he could ever become a Buckeye, Coach Tressel posthumously awarded him with a 2002 national championship ring.\n\nAs mentioned above, Derek Morris signed a Letter of Intent to play football at The Ohio State University, but he was released by the school before he ever suited up for the Buckeyes. For that reason, he is not listed as an Ohio State signee by either Rivals or Scout for the recruiting class of 2002. I have included him here because he potentially took a scholarship away from another high school player who might have signed with the Buckeyes ... and in this particular case, that potential Buckeye was not just some theoretical generic recruit, but rather was linebacker Buster Davis (Daytona Beach (FL) Mainland; Rivals 4*, #5 MLB; Scout 4*, #8 LB, #55 overall). Even though he claimed to be a Buckeye lean late in the recruiting process, Davis did not receive a Letter of Intent from Ohio State, and he eventually signed with Florida State. In other words, Morris took Davis's scholarship, and neither ended up becoming Buckeyes in the long run. Davis had a solid career as a Seminole (265 tackles, 27.5 TFL's, 8 sacks, 3rd round draft choice), and he would have nicely filled the hole at middle linebacker between All Americans Matt Wilhelm (2002) and James Laurinaitis (2006).\n\nAnother reason why the Buckeyes had no room for Buster Davis was that wide receiver Richard Washington (Fort Myers, Florida; Rivals 4*, #6 WR, #54 overall; Scout 5*, #6 CB, #57 overall) pulled a Signing Day shocker and inked with North Carolina State despite having been an Ohio State verbal commitment. Washington, who proclaimed himself the Wolfpack's \"Rookie of the Year\" before ever setting foot on campus, was academically ineligible as a freshman, and thus did not play at all during his rookie campaign. When he finally did get the chance to see the field, Washington caught 73 passes for 848 yards and 8 touchdowns, which would be fairly impressive numbers over a single season, but Richard managed to accomplish that feat in only twice the amount of time. Ironically, Washington played against Ohio State in 2003, and he helped to lose the game for the Wolfpack when he lost a kickoff in the sun - the ball ricocheted off of his helmet, and the fumble was recovered at the N.C. State 3-yard line by the Buckeyes, who quickly punched the ball into the end zone. The two teams met again in 2004, and Washington played a small role in another loss (3 catches for 27 yards). After the 2004 season, Richard was kicked off of the Wolfpack team for smoking weed; he transferred to Ole Miss, sat out the 2005 season due to transfer rules, and then entered the 2006 NFL supplemental draft without ever having played a down for the Rebels. Washington was not selected in the supplemental draft, but he did play a couple of years of semi-pro ball, and at last check he is still looking for work. Karma....\n\nFun Facts - In the recruiting class of 2002, the Buckeyes signed an A.J., an E.J., an R.J., and a T.J. Coach Tressel would go on to sign only two more \"J's\" during his tenure at Ohio State - A.J. Trapasso in 2004 and C.J. Barnett in 2009.\n\nAfter losing Pierre Woods to Michigan in 2001, the Buckeyes got the \"Glenville pipeline\" rolling in the class of 2002 with the signing of quarterback Troy Smith. Coach Tressel would eventually sign seventeen Glenville Tarblooders, with at least one signee in every class from 2002 to 2011 (although the lone 2011 signee, Cardale Jones, took a post-grad year at Fork Union before re-signing with Ohio State as part of their class of 2012).\n\nThe Recruiting Class of 2003\n\n:osu: The Ohio State University Buckeyes' Recruiting Class of 2003 :osu:​\n\nThe class of 2003 was the absolute worst recruiting class in the history of Ohio State football. I know that my declaration sounds like hyperbole, but some class has to be the worst, so why not this one? The class of 2003 was hampered from the start by its small size (only 14 signees), and then it was decimated by career-ending injuries, dismissals, and transfers, so that only five players made it through the program. To make matters worse, Ohio State was coming off of a national championship season, and most experts felt that the Buckeyes would sign a top flight class in 2003, but instead their class was ranked #25 by Scout and #41 by Rivals - and that was before nine players busted out. The final indignity was the Signing Day massacre, when no less than eight major recruits spurned Ohio State for other schools - linebacker Shawn Crable (Michigan), defensive lineman Ray Edwards (Purdue), defensive lineman Stanley McClover (Auburn), running back Michael Bush (Louisville), offensive lineman Arron Sears (Tennessee), defensive lineman Turk McBride (Tennessee), tight end Jamesley Jean (North Carolina State), and wide receiver Devin Stearns (California). On the positive side, the five survivors from this class all turned out to be pretty good players - safety Donte Whitner, cornerback Ashton Youboty, wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez, defensive lineman David Patterson, and offensive lineman Kirk Barton.\n\nQuarterback\n\nTodd Boeckman was originally supposed to be part of the class of 2003, but he took a grey shirt and did not join the program until the following year; he will be rated with the class of 2004. With a fifth-year senior starter (Craig Krenzel), a fifth-year senior back-up (Scott McMullen), and two redshirt freshmen (Justin Zwick and Troy Smith), the quarterback situation was set for both the short and long term, and the staff wisely decided to pass on signing a quarterback in the class of 2003.\n\nRunning Back\n\nThe Buckeyes did not sign a running back in the class of 2003, primarily because they seemed set at the position with sophomore Maurice Clarett carrying the load, and with juniors Lydell Ross and Maurice Hall backing him up. After Clarett unexpectedly left the program prior to the 2003 season, and Ross and Hall proved unable to succeed as a featured back, the Buckeyes quickly became very thin at this critical position. In retrospect, the staffs' inability to sign a running back in this class was a major failure that impaired the Buckeyes' ground game for the next two seasons; it would not fully recover until the emergence of Antonio Pittman in 2005.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nAnthony Gonzalez (Cleveland St. Ignatius; Rivals 4*, #16 CB; Scout 4*, #8 CB) was signed as a cornerback, but quickly switched to wide receiver. After a redshirt season, Gonzalez slowly worked his way into the wide receiver rotation, with his breakout moment occurring in the 2004 version of The Game - a 68-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Troy Smith to open the Buckeyes' scoring in that contest. The same two players also hooked up for The Catch in the closing moments of the 2005 Game. Anthony became a prime target in 2006 (51 receptions, 734 yards, and 8 touchdowns, all good for second best on the team behind Ted Ginn), and his play was a major factor in the Buckeyes' perfect regular season. Gonzalez's career numbers were 87 receptions (21st all time at Ohio State) for 1,286 yards (14.8 average) and 13 touchdowns (tied for 13th all time).\n\nAnthony left the program after his red shirt junior season and he was a first round selection of the Indianapolis Colts in the 2007 NFL draft. After a promising start to his pro career (94 receptions for 1,240 yards and 7 touchdowns in his first two seasons), Gonzalez has seen little action the past three seasons due to injuries (5 receptions for 67 yards in 11 games).\n\nThe other wide receiver signed in this class was Devin Jordan (Massillon Washington; Rivals 3*, #29 WR; Scout 3*, #51 WR), who was a high school teammate of quarterback Justin Zwick (class of 2002). At Ohio State, Jordan had even less success than Zwick - he suffered two serious leg injuries and never played a down for the Buckeyes. Devin did remain with the program as a \"student assistant coach\", where he helped Coach Hazell tutor the Buckeye wide receivers. After graduation, Jordan has remained in coaching, with assistant positions at Wittenberg, Otterbein, and most recently Walsh University.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Anthony Gonzalez (4*); Devin Jordan (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Anthony Gonzalez (4*); Devin Jordan (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-1/4*); Anthony Gonzalez (3-1/2*); Devin Jordan (1*)​\n\nTight End\n\nOkay, here is where things start getting ugly. On paper, the most successful position group for the class of 2003 was tight end. Louis Irizarry (Youngstown Ursuline; Rivals 4*, #3 TE, #38 overall; Scout 4*, #4 TE) was one of the headliners for this class, and many thought that with his combination of size (6' 5\", 235 lbs) and speed (4.6 forty), he would revolutionize the tight end position at Ohio State. Well, let's just say that Louis had other ideas. In his brief time on the field (he played in eight games in 2003), Irizarry dropped passes. Then he was suspended for four games after a dorm room altercation. In the spring of 2004, he had a second brush with the law, this one much more serious - he beat up a fellow student and stole his wallet, thereby earning himself a three-year stretch at the gray bar hotel. After serving six months, Louis was granted an early release and he enrolled at Youngstown State, where he finished his football career without further incident. Ironically, as a Penguin, he played against the Buckeyes in the opening game of the 2007 season - he had four receptions for 19 yards.\n\nThe other tight end signee in 2003 was Marcel Frost (Lyndhurst Brush; Rivals 3* #31 TE; Scout 4*, #11 TE). Frost red shirted in 2003, was switched to defense, found himself in the dog house, switched back to offense, finally saw some playing time in 2005 (7 catches for 70 yards), received a season-long suspension in 2006, and then transferred to Jackson State. Of the seven dismissals in this class, Frost lasted the longest, not getting the boot until August of 2006.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Louis Irizarry (4*); Marcel Frost (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Louis Irizarry (4*); Marcel Frost (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (0*); Louis Irizarry (0*); Marcel Frost (0*)​\n\nOffensive Line\n\nThe Buckeyes signed only one offensive lineman in this class, Kirk Barton (Massillon Perry; Rivals 3*, #60 OT; Scout 3*, #101 OL). A high school tight end, Barton was considered a major reach by all the recruiting experts; one pundit even went so far as to state that Kirk wasn't even the best blocker on his own high school team. But Barton proved the so-called experts wrong, and he became a four-year starter at right tackle (42 starts in 51 games) and an All American as a fifth-year senior in 2007. Over his last two seasons, Kirk recorded 134 knockdown blocks and 16 touchdown-resulting blocks, and he allowed just three sacks in 670 pass plays. After his playing days in Columbus were over, Barton was a seventh round draft choice in the 2008 NFL draft. Kirk bounced around the NFL for a couple of years, and now works as an offensive quality control assistant for the Buckeyes.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Kirk Barton (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3*); Kirk Barton (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (4*); Kirk Barton (4*)​\n\nDefensive Line\n\nOne of the prospects who survived the class of 2003 was defensive tackle David Patterson (Warrensville Heights; Rivals 4*, #7 DT, #83 overall; Scout 4*, #4 DT). Although Patterson didn't quite live up to his four-star billing, he had a productive career at Ohio State, especially when compared to the majority of his classmates. Patterson was a two-year starter who amassed 72 tackles, 17 TFL's, and 8 sacks during his time in Columbus; after leaving Ohio State, he became an undrafted free agent in the NFL.\n\nThe other two defensive line signees were complete busts. Sian Cotton (Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary; Rivals 3*, #48 DT; Scout 3*, #24 DT), best known for being LeBron James's sidekick/teammate in high school, lasted a couple of years in Columbus (6 tackles, 1 sack) before transferring first to Youngstown State and then to Walsh University, an NAIA school located in Canton. Brandon Maupin (West Chester Lakota West; Rivals 3*, #21 SDE; Scout 4*, #10 DT) had an even quicker exit, heading to Division II Lane College after the 2004 season (1 tackle). Both Cotton and Maupin were academic casualties.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); David Patterson (4*); Sian Cotton (3*); Brandon Maupin (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/2*); David Patterson (4*); Sian Cotton (3*); Brandon Maupin (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1*); David Patterson (3*); Sian Cotton (0*); Brandon Maupin (0*)\n\n​\n\nLinebacker\n\nThe Buckeyes signed one linebacker prospect in 2003, but you probably don't remember him. Reggie Smith (East Cleveland Shaw; Rivals 3*, #27 OLB; Scout 3*, #23 LB) made it through his redshirt season before flunking out; he ended up at Walsh University in Canton, and is currently on the roster of the Western Pennsylvania Wildcatz, an indoor football developmental team.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Reggie Smith (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3*); Reggie Smith (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (0*); Reggie Smith (0*)\n\n​\n\nDefensive Back\n\nSix of the fourteen signees for the class of 2003 were defensive back prospects. As mentioned above, Anthony Gonzalez flipped to the other side of the ball and played wide receiver at Ohio State; he is rated with that position group. The rest of the crew had mixed success, with one All American, one All Big Ten performer, one career-ending injury, one dismissed for arrest, and one academic casualty.\n\nLet's start with the successful players. Donte Whitner (Cleveland Glenville; Rivals 4*, #3 CB, #27 overall; Scout 5*, #1 CB) became an enforcer in the Buckeyes' defensive backfield, earning All American honors at free safety in 2005 before turning pro a year early. For his Buckeye career, Whitner had 164 tackles, 13 TFL's, 5 sacks, 5 INT's, 9 PBU's, and 2 TD's (blocked punt, pick six). Donte was a first round selection in the 2006 NFL draft, and he has continued that success in the NFL, where he has played 84 games (81 starts) in six seasons, averaging 85 tackles per year, with seven career interceptions.\n\nAshton Youboty (Klein, Texas; Rivals 4*, #14 S; Scout 3*, #24 CB) was a two-year starter at cornerback and an All Big Ten selection in 2005 before turning pro after his third season in the program. For his Buckeye career, Youboty had 131 tackles, 9 TFL's, 2 sacks, 5 INT's, 23 PBU's, and a touchdown on a blocked field goal. Ashton was selected in the third round of the 2006 NFL draft, but he has been an NFL journeyman thus far, with just 48 games played in six seasons, and only 12 starts; he has 85 total tackles and a pair of interceptions.\n\nCurt Lukens (North Canton Hoover; Rivals 3*, #35 S; Scout 3*, #44 S) played in a handful of games in 2004 and 2005, mostly on special teams, logging just one tackle. Curt was forced to give up football in 2006, when chronic shoulder injuries ended his career. Like Devin Jordan, Lukens remained with the team as a \"student assistant coach\".\n\nIra Guilford (Hoboken, New Jersey; Rivals 4*, #8 S; Scout 3*, #19 CB) saw some action as a true freshman at running back. Although Ira didn't have much success at his new position (28 carries for 64 yards), it actually turned out to be the high point of his Buckeye career, and here's why: Guilford was hanging around with teammate Louis Irizarry (see above) at 3 o'clock one fine morning when Irizarry decided to pummel and rob a fellow student. Although Guilford cooperated with the police and was not involved in the actual robbery, he pled guilty to assault and served 45 days of house arrest. Even though it was a first offense, and a relatively minor one at that, the Buckeyes didn't really need a running back who averaged 2.3 yards per carry, so the staff jettisoned Guilford along with Irizarry. After being dismissed from Ohio State, Ira bounced around quite a bit, first to junior college, then to Troy, before finally ending up at William Patterson University (a Division III school in New Jersey).\n\nBelieve it or not, the fifth defensive back signee had even less success than Ira Guilford. Known as \"Superman\" in high school, Dareus Hiley (Cleveland Glenville; Rivals 4*, #14 CB; Scout 4*, #6 CB) was supposed to be the 2003 version of Teddy Ginn. But Hiley ran into academic problems at Ohio State, and within a year he had transferred out to Mesabi Range Junior College in Minnesota ... and he failed to remain eligible even at the JUCO level. He is now a landscaping in the Cleveland area.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-3/4*); Donte Whitner (4*); Ashton Youboty (4*); Curt Lukens (3*); Ira Guilford (4*); Dareus Hiley (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Donte Whitner (5*); Ashton Youboty (3*); Curt Lukens (3*); Ira Guilford (3*); Dareus Hiley (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-3/4*); Donte Whitner (4*); Ashton Youboty (3-1/2*); Curt Lukens (1*); Ira Guilford (0*); Dareus Hiley (0*)\n\n​\n\nSpecialists\n\nOhio State did not sign either a punter or a place kicker in the class of 2003.\n\nWalk Ons and Transfers\n\nLinebacker Anthony Schlegel originally signed with the Air Force Academy in the class of 2001. After two years of success in Colorado Springs (164 tackles, 14 TFL's, 3 sacks, 1 INT), Schlegel decided to transfer to Ohio State. After sitting out the 2003 season, Anthony became the Buckeyes' starting middle linebacker in 2004, and along with A.J. Hawk and Bobby Carpenter, he formed one of the most formidable linebacking corps in Ohio State history. Schlegel was a marginal athlete who compensated for his lack of speed and mobility with extra effort, drive, and attitude. In two years at Ohio State, Schlegel recorded 166 tackles, 17.5 TFL's, and 5.5 sacks, and he was selected in the third round of the 2006 NFL draft, where he had a short (17 games, 5 starts) and unproductive (34 tackles) career. Anthony is currently an assistant strength and conditioning coach for Ohio State. If Schlegel were to be rated with the 2001 signees, he would merit 3-1/2 stars.\n\nLinebacker John Kerr (Cleveland St. Ignatius; Rivals 2*, #64 MLB; Scout 3*, #94 LB) was a Buckeye fan growing up, but he did not receive a scholarship offer from Ohio State, so he signed with Indiana for their recruiting class of 2002. After an outstanding freshman campaign (114 tackles), Kerr left the Hoosier program and walked on at Ohio State. John sat out the 2003 season due to transfer rules, was ineligible for the entire 2004 season, saw the field as a reserve in 2005 (14 tackles) and as a part time starter in 2006 (26 tackles). For his Buckeye career, John had 40 tackles, 1.5 TFL's, and 1 PBU. A two-and-a-half star player.\n\nAlthough Ohio State did not sign any fullbacks in the class of 2003, the Buckeyes did accept two preferred walk-ons that year: Tyler \"Tank\" Whaley (Ironton; Rivals NR; Scout NR) and Trever Robinson (Richmond (VA) Huguenot; Rivals NR; Scout NR). Whaley entered the program as a center, took a red shirt season, and eventually switched over to fullback; during his senior campaign, Tank split time fairly evenly with starting fullback Dionte Johnson (class of 2004). Whaley was put on scholarship prior to the 2007 season. Robinson also red-shirted in 2003, and then became a four-year starter on special teams, playing in over forty games, and earning four letters and a scholarship (before the 2006 season) in the process. As a senior, Trever saw some action at fullback, making 3 catches for 10 yards and a touchdown; he also contributed five tackles on special teams. If I were to rate Whaley and Robinson with this class, each would receive 2-1/2 stars.\n\nDaniel Dye (Napoleon; Rivals NR; Scout NR) walked on in 2003 and earned a scholarship before the 2007 season; as a fifth-year senior, Dye saw playing time in seven games as a second-string guard. Although he didn't contribute much, he did last five years in the program without being suspended, arrested, or flunked out, so in relative terms that accomplishment has to be worth two stars.\n\nIn 2007, three of the aforementioned walk-ons won an Ohio State post-season award: Trever Robinson earned the Ike Kelley Award as the top special teams performer; Dan Dye received the John Galbreath Award as the senior with the best academic record; and Tyler Whaley won the Bo Rein Award as the team's most inspirational player.\n\nOhio State did not sign any specialists for the class of 2003. However, Dimitrios Makridis (Warren Harding; Rivals NR; Scout NR) walked on that year, and he earned a scholarship before the 2007 season as the team's starting long snapper. He would merit two-and-a-half stars if he were ranked with this class.\n\nThe LJB Ratings for the Class of 2003 (14 signees, 1.43* average)\n\n5.0*\n\n4.5*\n\n4.0* Kirk Barton; Donte Whitner\n\n3.5* Anthony Gonzalez; Ashton Youboty\n\n3.0* David Patterson\n\n2.5*\n\n2.0*\n\n1.0* Curt Lukens; Devin Jordan\n\n0.0* Marcel Frost; Louis Irizarry; Ira Guilford; Sian Cotton; Dareus Hiley; Reggie Smith; Brandon Maupin\n\nJust like I said with the class of 2002, the numbers don't lie - two star players, three solid contributors, and nine total busts. This class was redeemed somewhat by a couple of key transfers into the program (Anthony Schlegel, John Kerr) and by the contributions of four former walk-ons. Even if we add those six players into the mix, the star rating for this class is just 1.83, which is still nothing short of disastrous.\n\nAdditional Notes - Louis Holmes (Fort Lauderdale Dillard; Rivals 2*; Scout 2*) was a defensive end prospect out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who committed to the Buckeyes for the class of 2003. However, Louis did not have the academic requirements to pass the NCAA Clearinghouse, so he did not sign a Letter of Intent with Ohio State and instead spent a post-grad year at Bridgton Academy in Maine. But that tactic didn't work to improve his grades, and Holmes ended up at a junior college for the next two years. All throughout this process, Buckeye fans heard rumors that Louis had finally passed the Clearinghouse, that he was seen on campus with other members of the team, that he had actually enrolled for the upcoming quarter, that he already had his own locker in the WHAC, and so on and so forth. Due to all of the unverified reports, but no actual sightings, Louis became known as \"Bigfoot\" amongst Buckeye fans. When Holmes finally did become eligible in 2006, he signed with Arizona, where he collected 73 tackles, 10.5 TFL's, and 6 sacks in two seasons. Bigfoot was last seen in the Arena Football League, but I have no video confirmation to date.\n\nStanley McClover (Fort Lauderdale Dillard; Rivals 4*, #12 SDE; Scout 4*, #14 DE) was the second player in two years to pull a Signing Day switcheroo against the Buckeyes. Despite making a verbal commitment to Ohio State, Stanley ended up signing with Auburn. Years later, McClover admitted that he was paid to attend Auburn, and that cold hard cash was the only reason that he didn't end up at Ohio State. Stanley was academically ineligible in 2003, and he played just two seasons on The Plains (66 tackles, 15.5 sacks, 5 pass deflections, 5 forced fumbles) before going pro. After being selected in the seventh round of the 2006 draft, Stanley was an NFL bust, with just eight tackles and one sack in fourteen games over three seasons.\n\nDefensive tackle Evans Desir (Fort Lauderdale Dillard; West Hills Community College; Rivals NR; Scout NR) was yet another Fort Lauderdale Dillard prospect from the class of 2003 who almost played football for Ohio State. Unlike Louis Holmes and Stanley McClover, Desir never actually had an offer from Ohio State, but that didn't stop him from \"committing\" to the Buckeyes on Signing Day. Evans actually did enroll at Ohio State, and he attempted to walk on to the football team, without success. Desir was quoted in an April 2007 article about college students seeking counseling for anxiety and depression: \"You think you are going to come and play in the Michigan game, but it all didn't work out like that.\" Apparently, his counselor helped him concentrate on the future instead of dwelling the past; hence, Evans is no longer pursuing a career in football.\n\nThe Recruiting Class of 2004\n\n:osu: The Ohio State University Buckeyes' Recruiting Class of 2004 :osu:​\n\nUpon first impressions, the Buckeyes' 2004 recruiting class seemed to be similar to their epic class of 2002, as the 2004 haul was large (26 signees), talented (ranked 9th by Rivals, 11th by Scout), and had top end star power (consensus five-star prospect Teddy Ginn, ranked as the #2 overall prospect in the country by Rivals). However, this class did close on a sour note, as the Buckeye coaching staff suffered through Signing Day Massacre 2.0, with six recruits spurning the Buckeyes at the last minute: linebacker James Bryant (Miami), running back Andrew Johnson (Miami), defensive lineman Rhyan Anderson (Miami), defensive lineman Willie Young (North Carolina State), defensive lineman Javier Estopinan (Florida), and wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett (Southern Cal)\n\nEven though this group of recruits looked good on paper, time has not been kind to the class of 2004, and in retrospect that class seems more like a larger version of the roundly criticized class of 2003. Although the class of 2004 did produce a few genuine stars (Ted Ginn, Antonio Pittman, Vernon Gholston), it also generated far too many busts, several of whom left the program prior to exhausting their eligibility.\n\nUnlike 2003, the Buckeye staff did well both in the state of Ohio - the only significant loss was tight end Fred Davis to Southern Cal - and out of state. In fact, nine of the twenty-five signees were from outside of Ohio, including four from Pennsylvania (a state in which the Buckeyes had been completely shut out for nearly a decade prior to 2004), two from Florida, and one each from Michigan, Missouri, and Louisiana. The problem with the class of 2004 wasn't bringing the talent in, but rather developing that talent and keeping it healthy and in academic good standing.\n\nQuarterback\n\nTodd Boeckman (Rivals 3*, #19 Pro-style QB; Scout 3*, #28 QB) was originally supposed to be part of the class of 2003, but he took a grey shirt and did not join the program until 2004. After redshirting in 2004 and seeing mop-up action in 2005 and 2006 behind Troy Smith, Boeckman became the starting quarterback for Ohio State prior to the 2007 season. As a junior, Boeckman had a largely successful campaign, as he threw for 2,379 yards and 25 touchdowns in earning All Big Ten first team honors, and leading the Buckeyes to an 11-2 record and a berth in the BCS title game. After a career performance in a night game at Penn State in week nine (19/26, 253 yards, 3 TD's), a 37-17 victory that sent the Bucks to 9-0 on the season, there was some speculation that Boeckman might even be a dark horse Heisman candidate.\n\nBut Todd played poorly down the stretch, and his subpar performance against Illinois in week eleven (13/23, 156 yards, 3 interceptions) was the primary factor in the Buckeyes' first loss of the season. Boeckman did just enough to beat Michigan in the regular season finale (7/13, 50 yards, 1 interception, 39 hand-offs to Chris Wells), and was just mediocre in the 38-24 loss to LSU in the BCS title game (15/26, 208 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions).\n\nTodd entered the 2008 season as the clear starter at quarterback, but he never recovered from his late-season regression in 2007. Boeckman had a big day against Division I-AA patsy Youngstown State in the opener (14/19, 187 yards, 2 touchdowns), but fell back in week two against lowly Ohio (16/26, 110 yards). In the week three match-up against top-ranked Southern Cal, Boeckman completely fell apart (14/21, 84 yards, 2 interceptions, 5 sacks), and his ill-advised pick six at the end of the second quarter sealed the Buckeyes' fate in the 35-3 debacle, and his own fate as the team's signal caller. Super freshman Terrelle Pryor would start and take the majority of the snaps the rest of the way, and for the remainder of the season, Boeckman would complete just 13 of 27 passes for 239 yards and 3 touchdowns; ironically, the last touchdown pass of Boeckman's career was to Terrelle Pryor in the 2009 Fiesta Bowl.\n\nTodd Boeckman was a three-star prospect who did nothing for four years, had one great season as a junior, and then was beaten out by a much better player as a sixth-year senior. And in reality, that's pretty much what you'd expect to get from a three-star prospect. Boeckman was able to bridge the gap between the Troy Smith era and the Terrelle Pryor era, and he almost took the Buckeyes to the promised land along the way. And when, as a sixth-year senior, he was surpassed by a true freshman, Todd was a good soldier who didn't complain about the lack of playing time. For his Buckeye career, Boeckman completed 255 of 402 passes (.634 completion percentage, the best in Ohio State history) for 3,085 yards (11th best at Ohio State), 31 touchdowns (10th best at Ohio State), and 16 interceptions.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Todd Boeckman (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3*); Todd Boeckman (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3*); Todd Boeckman (3*)​\n\nRunning Back\n\nWith depth being a real issue after the early and unexpected departure of Maurice Clarett in 2003, the Buckeyes signed a trio of tailbacks as part of the class of 2004. Antonio Pittman (Akron Buchtel; Rivals 4*, #13 RB; Scout 3*, #31 RB) was the most highly-regarded of the three, and as things turned out he was the only one to have any success in the scarlet and grey. Pittman began to make a name for himself in his true freshman season, and he posted a 144-yard game against Indiana in week seven. Pittman would finish his rookie campaign with 381 yards on just 72 carries, for a fine 5.3 average, which was over a yard per carry better than senior tailbacks Lydell Ross (4.1), Maurice Hall (4.2), and Branden Joe (3.2). As the undisputed starter in 2005, Pittman had his best season, with 1,331 yards (11th best at Ohio State) on 243 carries (5.5 average) and 7 touchdowns. In 2006, Antonio split time with super freshman Beanie Wells, but he still led the team in rushing with 1,232 yards (16th best at Ohio State) on 242 carries (5.1 average) and 14 touchdowns. In his three seasons as a Buckeye, Pittman rushed for 2,945 yards (8th best in OSU history), for an average of 84.1 yards per game (5th best in OSU history), and 22 touchdowns. Antonio turned pro after his junior season, and he was a fourth-round selection in the 2007 NFL draft; in two years in the NFL, he gained 435 yards on 117 carries (3.7 average) and no touchdowns.\n\nErik Haw (Columbus Independence; Rivals 3*, #23 RB; Scout 3*, #58 RB) earned a surprising offer from the Buckeyes after posting several sub-4.4 forties at Ohio State's 2003 summer camp. Although Haw never lit up the competition (red-shirt in 2004; 14 carries for 61 yards and a touchdown in 2005), he did light up a joint, in public, on campus, and that was enough to earn him a quick ticket out of Columbus. Erik transferred to Jackson State, where he had some success (982 yards rushing and 16 TD's in two seasons) before declaring for the 2008 NFL draft.\n\nThe final member of the trio was Dennis Kennedy (Ft. Lauderdale Stranahan; Rivals 2*; Scout 2*, #62 CB), a \"sleeper\" prospect who received a late offer from the Buckeye staff. Although he signed a Letter of Intent with the Buckeyes, Kennedy never enrolled at Ohio State. Dennis experienced some personal tragedies as a high school senior, and as a result his grades suffered and he failed to pass through admissions. Dennis subsequently signed with Akron, where he had a decent career: 2,522 yards rushing, 745 yards receiving, 29 total touchdowns, and a two-point conversion.\n\nThe Buckeyes don't often go after fullback prospects, but they made an exception in 2004 when they signed Dionte Johnson (Columbus Eastmoor; Rivals 2*; Scout 2*), the son of Thomas \"Pepper\" Johnson, the former Buckeye All American linebacker. At the time, many fans thought that the younger Johnson received an offer merely because he was a legacy recruit - and in retrospect, they were probably right. Dionte did earn four letters during his Ohio State career, but he started only six games, seemed a bit overmatched against top competition, and was generally outplayed in 2007 by former walk-on Tyler \"Tank\" Whaley.\n\nBrandon Smith (Euclid; Rivals 2*; Scout 2*) signed as a linebacker, but quickly switched to tight end, where he was no better than a third-stringer. However, prior to his senior season, Brandon made another position switch - to fullback - where he made 8 cacthes for 79 yards and provided some valuable lead blocks for tailback Beanie Wells. For his Ohio State career, Smith had 16 receptions for 139 yards.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (2-1/2*); Antonio Pittman (4*); Erik Haw (3*); Dennis Kennedy (2*); Dionte Johnson (2*); Brandon Smith (2*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (2-1/4*); Antonio Pittman (3*); Erik Haw (3*); Dennis Kennedy (2*); Dionte Johnson (2*); Brandon Smith (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-3/4*); Antonio Pittman (4*); Erik Haw (0*); Dennis Kennedy (0*); Dionte Johnson (2-1/2*); Brandon Smith (2-1/2*)​\n\nWide Receiver\n\nTheodore Ginn, Jr. (Cleveland Glenville; Rivals 5*, #1 CB, #2 overall; Scout 5*, #1 CB) will go down in history as the most exciting player ever to wear the scarlet and grey (with all due respect to Chic Harley, Hopalong Cassady, Vic Janowicz, Archie Griffin, et al.) and one of the true legends of Buckeye football.\n\nDespite his immense potential, Ginn's career got off to a very slow start - through his first four games as a Buckeye, Teddy had just 3 receptions for 9 yards, and most fans thought that a return to cornerback was imminent. Over the next four weeks, however, Ginn began to exhibit some of his amazing talent, returning two punts for scores (65 yards vs. Wisconsin, 67 yards vs. Penn State), while also hitting pay dirt against Indiana on a 59-yard strike from newly-appointed starting quarterback Troy Smith, a high school teammate of Ginn. But Ginn really made a name for himself during the final third of his freshman campaign, as he scored three touchdowns against Michigan State in week nine (a 17-yard run, a 60-yard punt return, and a 58-yard reception to seal the victory); had 87 yards receiving and an 82-yard punt return for a touchdown in an upset win over Michigan; and racked up 118 yards of total offense and a touchdown against Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl, a game in which he was named the Most Valuable Player. Even though he was a non-factor for the first third of the season, Teddy was still second on the team with 896 all-purpose yards, he tied for the team lead with 8 touchdowns, and he set Buckeye single-season records with four punt returns for touchdowns (in just 15 returns) and 25.6 yards per punt return (smashing the previous mark of 18.7 yards per return). At then end of his freshman campaign, Ginn was named to several All American teams as a return specialist.\n\nGiven the high expectations after his rookie season, Ginn experienced somewhat of a \"sophomore slump\" in 2005. Although he led the team with 1,668 all-purpose yards and scored 7 touchdowns, opposing defenses were more focused on TGII and thus he had fewer big plays to his credit. That is, at least until the Fiesta Bowl, when Ginn scorched Notre Dame for 240 yards of total offense and scored on a 56-yard pass and a beautiful 68-yard run on a reverse.\n\nAs a junior, Teddy once again led the team with 1,504 all-purpose yards, and he scored 11 times (and also threw for a touchdown); but he became a more complete receiver, as evidenced by his team-high 59 receptions and 9 touchdown catches. The last play of Ginn's college career was the opening kickoff of the 2006 BCS championship game, which he returned 93-yards for a touchdown; he was sidelined for the rest of the contest with a broken foot suffered in the subsequent end zone celebration. Once again, Ted received some All American recognition after the 2006 season, and he was also named first team All Big Ten.\n\nFor his three-year Ohio State career, Ted Ginn caught 135 passes (seventh all time) for 1,943 yards (eighth all time) and 15 touchdowns (tied for tenth all time); in addition, he amassed 4,068 all-purpose yards (eighth all time), and he was responsible for 27 touchdowns (15 receiving, 3 rushing, 6 punt returns, 2 kick-off returns, and 1 passing), most of them being memorable (an incredible 16 of his touchdowns were 50 yards or longer). His six punt returns for touchdowns is a Big Ten record.\n\nAlthough he was a top-ten selection in the 2007 NFL draft, Ginn has been somewhat of a disappointment as a pro, as he has not been able to able to crack the starting line-up as a wide receiver. In five seasons, Teddy has 159 receptions for 2,047 yards (12.9 average) and 6 touchdowns; 26 rushes for 203 yards (7.8 average) and 2 touchdowns; together with 3 touchdowns on punt returns and 3 touchdowns on kick returns.\n\nThe other two receivers whom the Buckeyes signed in 2004 were ranked nearly as high as Ted Ginn coming out of high school, but both were essentially busts during their time at Ohio State. Albert Dukes (Belle Glades (FL) Central; Rivals 4*, #14 WR; Scout 4*, #24 WR), hailed form the same high school as Buckeye great Santonio Holmes, and according to the recruiting buzz, Dukes was an even more talented receiver than his accomplished predecessor. However, Albert got into some off-the-field trouble early in his career, and he never really seemed to find his niche in Columbus; in three seasons, Dukes had 4 receptions for 39 yards. Devon Lyons (Pittsburgh Woodland Hills; Rivals 4*, #5 safety; Scout 3*, #17 S) played as a true freshman in 2004, but chronic injuries (he missed the entire 2005 season with an ankle problem) and position switches (from wide receiver to safety and back again) killed his once-promising career, and he left Ohio State with just 2 receptions for 15 yards. Both Dukes and Lyons graduated from Ohio State with one year of eligibility remaining, and each transferred for his final season: Dukes to Valdosta State, Lyons to West Virginia.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (4-1/4*); Ted Ginn, Jr. (5*); Albert Dukes (4*); Devon Lyons (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (4*); Ted Ginn, Jr. (5*); Albert Dukes (4*); Devon Lyons (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-1/4*); Ted Ginn, Jr. (5*); Albert Dukes (1*); Devon Lyons (1*)​\n\nTight End\n\nThe Buckeyes signed the best tight end class in the country in 2004, landing two of the top four prospects at that position. After seeing significant playing time as a true freshman in 2004, Rory Nicol (Beaver, Pennsylvania; Rivals 4*, #4 TE; Scout 4*, #2 TE) missed the entire 2005 season with a foot injury. Nicol returned to action in 2006 as the Buckeyes' starting tight end, a job that he held for the remainder of his college career. Granted, the tight end was under-utilized in Tressel's offensive scheme, but Nicol's career numbers are still somewhat disappointing (38 receptions, 329 yards, 6 TD's), especially for a kid who wasn't known as a devasting blocker.\n\nThe other tight end signee from the class of 2004 was Chad Hoobler (Carrollton; Rivals 4*, #3 TE; Scout 4*, #4 TE). After two position switches - first to linebacker, then to defensive end - Chad abruptly left the program during 2006 fall practice and transferred to Ashland, where he suffered career-ending knee injuries. Hoobler then pursued a career as an MMA fighter. Chad finished with six tackles as a special teams performer.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/4*); Rory Nicol (4*); Chad Hoobler (4*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/4*); Rory Nicol (4*); Chad Hoobler (4*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-1/2*); Rory Nicol (3*); Chad Hoobler (0*)​\n\nOffensive Line\n\nThe Buckeyes' offensive line haul was supposed to be the cornerstone of the 2004 class, but that group was distinctly disappointing. The prize recruit from the quartet of signees was Kyle Mitchum (Erie (PA) McDowell; Rivals 4*, #6 OT, #56 overall; Scout 4*, #7 OL), but Mitchum was frequently injured and saw little playing time during his five years on campus.\n\nBen Person (Xenia; Rivals 4*, #10 OG; Scout 4*, #17 OL) was another highly-regarded prospect from the class of 2004. Although Person developed rather slowly, he earned the starting right guard slot for his final two seasons (2007 and 2008).\n\nWeighing in at well over 300 pounds as a high school senior, Steve Rehring (West Chester Lakota West; Rivals 3*, #29 OT; Scout 3*, #48 OL) was considered a \"project\" recruit. However, he was actually the first member of the 2004 OL class to see the field, and he even earned a letter as a true freshman. An illness sidelined Rehring for most of the 2005 season (he ended up taking a red-shirt that year), but he returned to earn a starting role in 2006 (left guard). Despite being a starter for most of his final three seasons, Rehring was an inconsistent performer, primarily due to weight and conditioning issues.\n\nThe Buckeye staff took a chance on Jon Skinner (Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania; Rivals 3*, #39 OG; Scout 3*, #94 OL), who suffered a major knee injury in high school. Skinner remained injury-prone at Ohio State, although he logged some quality time as a back-up in 2005, 2006, and 2007. But then Jon suffered yet another injury prior to the 2008 season and never played again.\n\nOn the whole, this group had two busts (Mitchum and Skinner) and two contributors (Person and Rehring) whose play could best be described as \"inconsistent\", as at times they looked great, and at others they looked slow, unathletic, out-of-shape, and even disinterested.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Kyle Mitchum (4*); Ben Person (4*); Steve Rehring (3*); Jon Skinner (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/2*); Kyle Mitchum (4*); Ben Person (4*); Steve Rehring (3*); Jon Skinner (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-1/2*); Kyle Mitchum (2*); Ben Person (3*); Steve Rehring (3*); Jon Skinner (2*)​\n\nDefensive Line\n\nAt six-foot-four, 264 pounds, defensive end Vernon Gholston (Detroit Cass Tech; Rivals 4*, #11 WDE; Scout 3*, #39 DE) might hold the distinction for being the must \"cut\" player ever to wear the scarlet and grey. However, Big Vern was no mere body builder in shoulder pads, as he was one of the most productive defensive ends in Ohio State history. After seeing limited action as a true freshman (no tackles in six games), Gholston lost most of the 2005 season due to a broken hand (one tackle in two games), and he took a medical redshirt that year. Fully recovered in 2006, Vernon started all 13 games for the Buckeyes, registering 49 tackles, 15 TFL's (15th best at Ohio State), and 8.5 sacks (13th best at Ohio State) en route to being named a second team All Big Ten performer by both the coaches and the media. Gholston continued his progress in 2007, as he was named a first team All American after racking up 37 tackles, 15.5 TFL's (14th best at Ohio State), a Buckeye single-season record 14 sacks, and a touchdown on a fumble recovery; against Wisconsin, he tied Ohio State's single-game record with four sacks. For his career, Gholston had 87 tackles, 30.5 TFL's, 22.5 sacks (fifth best at Ohio State), and a interception. Despite having one year of eligibility remaining, Gholston decided to enter the 2008 NFL draft, where he was a top-ten selection by the New York Jets; unfortunately, Big Vern has been a monumental bust as a pro, with just 42 tackles and no sacks in three seasons.\n\nWhen you sign one Vernon Gholston, you've already had a successful defensive line class, regardless of what your other signees end up doing. And in the case of the Buckeyes' class of 2004, the other two defensive line prospects didn't do much at all during their tenures in Columbus. Nader Abdallah (Metairie, Louisiana; Rivals 3*, #30 DT; Scout 3*, #44 DT) took a red shirt in 2004, then saw action in only eight games over the next two seasons, logging just a single tackle during that time. However, in his last two seasons, Nader played in every game and he was an integral member of the Buckeyes' defensive tackle rotation. As a senior, he made several big plays, was named honorable mention All Big Ten, and won the Jack Stephenson Award as the Buckeyes' outstanding defensive lineman. For his Ohio State career, Nader had 54 tackles, 9 TFL's, 2 sacks, and 4 deflected passes. Abdallah is a good example of a kid who slacked off for three years (overweight and poor work ethic), but ultimately put in the effort and finished strong, and for that I give him an extra half star.\n\nAlex Barrow (Dublin Coffman; Rivals 3*, #31 DT; Scout 3*, #59 DE) showed more early promise than Nader Abdallah, but he saw his playing time steadily decrease while the Buckeyes gradually improved their depth along the defensive line. As a red-shirt junior, Barrow earned most of his minutes on special teams. At the end of the 2007 season, Alex announced that he would not return to the team for his senior campaign, but would instead pursue a career in advertising or public relations after graduating with a degree in communications. For his Ohio State career, Barrow registered 16 tackles and 1 sack in 32 games played.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3-1/4*); Vernon Gholston (4*); Nader Abdallah (3*); Alex Barrow (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3*); Vernon Gholston (3*); Nader Abdallah (3*); Alex Barrow (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (3-1/4*); Vernon Gholston (4-1/2*); Nader Abdallah (3*); Alex Barrow (2*)\n\n​\n\nLinebacker\n\nOne of the stars of the recruiting class of 2004 was linebacker Marcus Freeman (Huber Heights Wayne; Rivals 4*, #4 MLB, #31 overall; Scout 4*, #11 LB). After seeing action in every game as a true freshman (4 tackles), Freeman missed the entire 2005 campaign with a knee injury. Marcus rebounded nicely in 2006, as he was second on the team with 71 tackles; he also had 2 interceptions and broke up 6 passes. But despite the solid numbers, many people questioned Freeman's toughness and his ability to stop the run. In 2007, Freeman once again finished in second place with 109 tackles (including 9.5 TFL's), and he also played well in pass coverage (5 pass break-ups). However, Freeman's season was somewhat inconsistent, as he had huge performances against Minnesota (11 tackles, 1 TFL), Penn State (14 tackles, 2 TFL's), Illinois (18 tackles, 1 TFL), Michigan (9 tackles), and LSU (14 tackles), but in other games he seemed to play \"soft\" and disappear at times. Marcus slipped somewhat during his senior campaign, as he logged only 84 tackles in 2008. For his career, Freeman had 268 tackles (20th all time at Ohio State), 21 TFL's, 6 sacks, 2 INT's, and 15 PBU's. Of all the 2004 signees, Marcus Freeman was perhaps the most disappointing because our expectations for him were so high. Although Freeman was certainly a solid performer during his Ohio State career, he never had that one break-out year - while the fans expected him to be an All American, he never even made All Big Ten. After leaving Ohio State, Marcus was selected in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL draft. Freeman spent one year on a practice squad, and then was forced to quit football due to an enlarged heart. Marcus is currently the linebackers coach for Kent State.\n\nThe other linebacker who signed with Ohio State in 2004 was Curtis Terry (Cleveland Glenville; Rivals 2*; Scout 2*). Although Curtis was a late addition to the class, he quickly made a name for himself on special teams, and he earned letters in both 2004 and 2005 for his participation on the punt, punt return, kick-off, and kick-off return squads. In 2006, Terry worked his way into linebacker rotation, where he recorded 17 tackles and 3.5 TFL's primarily in a back-up role. Curtis seemed poised to have a break-out year in 2007, but an ankle injury kept him on the sidelines for the entire season. As a senior, Curtis saw limited action in 9 games, finishing with 6 tackles and 2 TFL's before succumbing to another season-ending injury. For his career, Terry had 25 tackles and 5.5 tackles for loss.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Marcus Freeman (4*); Curtis Terry (2*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3*); Marcus Freemen (4*); Curtis Terry (2*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (2-3/4*); Marcus Freeman (3-1/2*); Curtis Terry (2*)​\n\nDefensive Back\n\nThe Buckeyes signed six defensive backs in 2004, but two of them - Ted Ginn and Devon Lyons - were quickly moved to wide receiver. The other four struggled to find a role with the Buckeyes, and none of them saw consistent minutes on defense.\n\nLike fullback Dionte Johnson, Shaun Lane (Hubbard; Rivals 3*, #14 CB; Scout 3*, #32 CB) was another legacy recruit in the class of 2004, his father being former Buckeye great Garcia Lane (cornerback, 1980-1983). Shaun red-shirted in 2004, and saw limited action since then, mostly on special teams. For his career, Lane had 50 tackles, 4 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries, and 1 pass broken up.\n\nThe Buckeye career of Nick Patterson (St. Louis Hazelwood Central; Rivals 3*, #30 ATH; Scout 3*, #41 S) was similar to that of Shaun Lane: redshirt in 2004, then sporadic playing time over the next four seasons (although Nick did start the 2006 season opener at free safety); he finished with just 18 tackles and an interception.\n\nAs a true freshman, Sirjo Welch (Columbus Beechcroft; Rivals 3*, #17 safety; Scout 4*, #7 S) earned the reputation as a special teams demon - he recorded 15 tackles and earned a letter for his efforts. Sirjo's production tailed off in 2005, and he logged only 5 tackles in 9 games while spending some time in the coaches' doghouse due to poor academics. Apparently Welch's grades went from bad to worse, as he became academically ineligible after the 2005 season, dropped out of Ohio State, and enrolled at Cincinnati ... where he failed to qualify; Sirjo eventually ended up at Kentucky State, where he finished his career in 2009.\n\nAnother academic casualty for the class of 2004 was cornerback Brandon Underwood (Hamilton; Rivals 3*, #16 CB; Scout 3*, #14 CB), who left the program after the 2006 season with just 3 tackles to his credit. Underwood also transferred to Cincinnati.\n\nRivals rankings: Group (3*); Shaun Lane (3*); Nick Patterson (3*); Sirjo Welch (3*); Brandon Underwood (3*)\n\nScout rankings: Group (3-1/4*); Shaun Lane (3*); Nick Patterson (3*); Sirjo Welch (4*); Brandon Underwood (3*)\n\nLJB rankings: Group (1-1/2*); Sha"
