        "text": "Players who can bat and bowl well provide their captain with a wide range of alternatives. In the midfield, any multifaceted player allows his captain to make more aggressive decisions.\n\nCaptains gradually realised that to win any T20 match or competition, they needed quality all-rounders in their line-up as soon as T20 cricket became popular. In T20 cricket, players who can bowl some overs and score run as well rapidly are almost indispensable.\n\nThroughout 14 seasons, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has seen some remarkable all-rounders. As the 15th season is underway, let's look at who has been successful with both the ball and the bat for their teams in the cash-rich competition.\n\nBatting All-rounders:\n\nLiam Livingstone\n\nLiam Livingstone was one of the most expensive purchases of Punjab Kings in mega auctions. The batting all-rounder has amassed 315 runs at an average of 31.5 and strike rate of 184.2 in this IPL, justifying his price tag for the team. Livingstone's season is distinguished by his high strike rate and high run total. In this IPL, no batter has scored more than 300 runs with a higher strike rate. David Warner has the next best strike rate in that run bracket with 156.82. He is being beneficial with the ball, too, as he's giving Punjab Kings an extra option to choose from.\n\nHardik Pandya\n\nHardik Pandya's development as a cricketer exemplifies how the IPL aids in the development and moulding of a young cricketer's career. The Mumbai Indians took notice of the Baroda all-rounder and signed him for the 2015 season. Pandya has steadily grown as a cricketer since his debut season. He was their crucial member in four of the Mumbai Indians' trophies (5 out of which they won, four were after he joined).\n\nThis season he's donning a new team Gujarat Titans and is back in form at the greatest cricket league. He has had an outstanding season till now as the Indian all-rounder already has 333 runs in 10 matches, which he has been part of with an impressive strike rate of 134.27.\n\nHardik has been effective with the ball, too, as he has an economy of 7.57 and bagged four wickets which are reasonable considering the number of overs he bowls for the franchise.\n\nBowling All-rounders:\n\nWanindu Hasaranga\n\nAt the IPL 2022 Mega Auction, Sri Lankan leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga joined Royal Challengers Bangalore for INR 10.75 crore. The spin grandmaster succeeded in getting a hat trick in the 2021 T20 World Cup, and RCB went all out to support him. When India travelled to Sri Lanka for a T20 series in July 2021, the 24-year-old all-rounder impressed, particularly with the ball.\n\nThe bowling all-rounder is beneficial for the Bangalore-based franchise as he has 21 wickets in 12 matches this season, which is quite impressive. Also, he carries an economy of just 7.85, showing that he's a complete match-winner for the franchise. Apart from that, he comes in handy with the bat and doesn't shy away from hitting whenever needed.\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRashid Khan is having an average IPL season with the ball in terms of wickets, but the Gujarat Titans spinner is unconcerned with the numbers as long as he can cost-effectively bowl for his club. Rashid has taken 11 wickets in as many games at an economy rate of 6.84, stats that will irritate him greatly. Even after this, the Afghan Bowling all-rounder has been in the headlines as he performs both with bat and ball.\n\nHe had chased crucial targets for Gujarat when there was little to no hope of them winning the game. In 7 innings, he had a strike rate of 189.47. This season, he has 72 runs, which seems minor, but those 72 runs are responsible for two wins for the new franchise."
