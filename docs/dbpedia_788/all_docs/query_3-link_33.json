        "text": "Thursday\n\nSeptember 5, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3665\n\nopening night.......ruined?\n\nThat's a pretty nifty trick the O's played on the Ravens last night.\n\nRuining the opening night of the NFL season and all by losing to the White Sox, 8-1.\n\nAs the Birds prepared to fall to the worst team in the history of baseball on Wednesday evening, I remarked that losing to the White Sox was akin to having Charlie Brown hit both the game tying and game winning field goals against you when they came into the game 0-9 and you were sporting an 8-1 record.\n\nI'm just gonna file that one under \"the other team tries, too\" and try not to think about it too much. Losing to the White Sox. Sheeeeeesh.\n\nTonight in Kansas City, the Ravens look for a morsel of revenge from last January's heartbreaker in Baltimore, where Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce danced at midfield after the Chiefs beat John Harbaugh's team in the AFC Championship Game, 17-10.\n\nA win tonight won't do anything to change that result, obviously. But it would sting the Chiefs to lose their banner-raising home opener for the second straight year, I'm guessing. And it all happens in front of a national TV audience, too, if that matters in the least.\n\nThe best way to look at this game is simply through the lens of a 17-game season.\n\nIt's one game.\n\nThe Chiefs are favored.\n\nUnder almost any circumstance, barring an injury to Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs are favored against most every team.\n\nSo beating them gives you a win in a game you were \"projected\" to lose, if you will.\n\nThat tonight's contest happens to be the season opener is neither here nor there, I'm guessing. The positive? The Ravens are (relatively) healthy with no major pre-season injuries. The negative? The other team is (mostly) in the same condition. The Chiefs are missing erstwhile Ravens wide receiver Hollywood Brown but I'm not sure anyone's going to notice.\n\nPlaying the Chiefs in the season opener is infinitely better -- in my opinion -- than playing them in late October or early December.\n\nI love the Ravens chances tonight.\n\nWe also love several individual player prop bets this evening as well. I mean, if you're going to spend your valuable Thursday evening watching football, you might as well make some Christmas spending money along the way, right?\n\nBut before we get to the important football stuff, let's tackle a few important questions from the vault that have been piling up.\n\nAnthony asks -- I realize this is not a political site but you do occasionally post non-sports stuff that centers on religion, music and your high school golf team. I'm curious why you don't endorse one of the Presidential candidates here and on your social media channels? Isn't the whole idea behind web sites like this and social media accounts to influence the people who follow you? I hope this question isn't too touchy for you to answer. Thanks for your time.\"\n\nDF says -- \"It's not too touchy at all. I have no problem discussing anything here or on X (Twitter). The reason I don't do it is simple. I don't like the backlash that comes with it. I personally couldn't care less who anyone votes for. It's none of my business, for starters, and I just don't care which of the two you like. I have lots of friends who are voting for Harris and I have lots of friends voting for Trump.\n\nI like my friends no matter who they vote for.\n\nHere, though, it's different. People get their feathers ruffled at the dumbest stuff. And as I've said here numerous times this year, the biggest problem in our country today -- as a society -- isn't the political divide that the people at CNN try to convince you of. In fact, they're one of the reasons why we're divided.\n\nThe biggest problem in our nation is that we forgot how to disagree on things and still be civil, reasonable, righteous human beings.\n\nI have no idea how that happened or when it officially happened or any of the historical stuff but it happened. When we disagree on something now, as a society, we lose our ability to think clearly. It's sad.\n\nSo, no political endorsements from me. All that would do is lead people to being ugly. Good question, though. There's definitely an \"influencer\" element to our world these days that is front and center with things like the 2024 election.\"\n\nKris asks -- \"Do you think Scottie Scheffler should get credit for a career win with the PGA Tour Championship? He didn't start with the same score as the other players in the field after all. Just curious about your thoughts on this as I respect your golf acumen and I know my foursome at Pine Ridge will talk about it this Saturday. Thanks and Go Hall!\"\n\nDF says -- \"Fair question for sure. First of all, Collin Morikawa got credit for a win in the Official World Golf Rankings because he posted the best 72 hole score. I definitely think that's the right and fair thing to do, even if he didn't get credit for an actual win on his TOUR record.\n\nI hate to ride the fence on this one. I see both sides of it. Scheffler earned his advantage, after all, and was merely playing by the rules. And let's say Xander Schauffele would have won instead of Scottie. Well, \"X\" started the event ahead of everyone in the field as well, except for Scheffler obviously. Does \"X\" get credit for a win?\n\nThis is my way of basically saying, \"It is what it is and I'm OK with it.\" I see the logic behind NOT giving him credit for a win given that he didn't start at zero like everyone else, but I also think he earned that advantage over the previous 8 months.\"\n\nRick C. asks -- \"One month or so after they arrive what do you think about the Orioles keeping Slater and Jimenez next season?\"\n\nDF says -- My quick research shows Slater is a free agent and Jimenez has a $16.5 million club option in 2025. I think both of them have added something to the team in their month or so in Baltimore, but I can't imagine the O's will pursue either of them for next season and beyond.\n\nEvery team has an Austin Slater or two already on their roster. He's like a coffee shop in Los Angeles. There's one on every corner.\n\nJimenez has seen his stock drop significantly over the last couple of seasons and not just because of his mercurial personality and the fact he doesn't own a glove. He's just never fulfilled the promise that accompanied him to the majors six years ago. Maybe I'm wrong on this one, but I'm guessing the O's cut him loose and he has a tough time signing any kind of long term deal in the winter.\n\nSomeone will give him a two or three year contract (he's only 27) and he might get $8-$10 million a year, but no one's paying him $15 million or $20 million a season.\"\n\nCarl in Owings Mills asks -- \"Did you agree with the two shot penalty on Sahith Theegala in the Tour Championship event?\"\n\nDF says -- \"I'm not sure it's up to me to \"agree\" or \"disagree\" with it. The player himself called the penalty after feeling like he brushed the sand on his backswing. If your question is \"Was that a fair penalty given that we hardly saw sand move?\" then we'll discuss it. It sure didn't look like he improved his lie or path to the ball.\n\nBut absent a rules official, umpire or referee, golf has to continue to be a sport where the players police themselves. It's the only way to do it. Plus, as we've seen with these #clownshoes baseball umpires all summer, the more people you get involved in the application of the rules, the worse it tends to get.\n\nI'd rather have Sahith Theegala call a (meaningless?) penalty on himself and know he's trying to uphold the integrity of the competition than have Patrick Reed openly cheat in a tournament like he did at Torrey Pines five years ago.\"\n\nSteve Bartram asks -- \"Would Harbaugh's tenure in Baltimore end if they somehow don't make the playoffs in 2024? One can only hope.\"\n\nDF says -- Maybe. I think that would depend on how it happened. If they're 6-2 and Lamar gets hurt in the 9th game and they eventually go 8-9 or 9-8 and miss the post-season, I can't see John losing his job.\n\nBut if somehow they simply sputter along all season and wind up 8-9 or 9-8 and don't make it, I guess I could see Steve Bisciotti coming in and saying, \"It's been great, but......\"\n\nIn general, my answer here is \"no\". John's tenure isn't ending in 2024 unless he wants it to end to in 2024. But, sure, if the Ravens totally flatlined this season and was a 7-10 or 8-9 team, then maybe they make a change.\"\n\nAnd so, speaking of the Ravens. Here's what I see happening tonight in Kansas City.\n\nThe Ravens new look (and concerning) offensive line has a solid night.\n\nDerrick Henry makes an impact.\n\nLamar is...well...Lamar.\n\nAnd for the second straight year, the Chiefs fall in their Thursday night home opener.\n\nI like the Ravens in this one 23-20.\n\nIf you have $10 to throw on a 4-way prop bet, here's one I'm considering playing:\n\n* Derrick Henry anytime touchdown\n\n* Patrick Mahomes OVER 20.5 rushing yards\n\n* Travis Kelce UNDER 57.5 passing yards\n\n* Travis Kelce anytime touchdown\n\nAre you ready for some football????? Let's go Ravens!!\n\nWednesday\n\nSeptember 4, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3664\n\nsox down...fins up...furyk weird\n\nI'm definitely not trying to pile on or state the obvious with this one, but we're seeing baseball HISTORY in Baltimore this week.\n\nWe're not seeing a bad team who might threaten a record or two for season-long futility.\n\nWe're seeing the worst baseball team in all of our lives this week. Like, ever. We had some 50-win teams in Baltimore that were NOWHERE close to as bad as this White Sox team we're seeing in Baltimore this week.\n\n13-3 on Monday.\n\n9-0 last night.\n\nProbably something like 11-3 tonight.\n\nAnd that's ONLY if Chicago can score three.\n\nWatching them for the better part of two nights has me thinking the obvious question: How on earth have they managed to win 31 games?\n\nLast night was so bad, the JV coach called Grady Sizemore afterwards and gave him some suggestions.\n\nChicago's starting pitcher on Tuesday evening made Nuke LaLoosh look like Greg Maddux. Wild pitches everywhere, walks, doubles, balls flying all over the ballpark. He even walked in a run in the 2nd inning. Nick Nastrini couldn't throw a strike to save his life. And if/when he did, the O's pounded it.\n\nThe White Sox managed to somehow produce a base runner in the 2nd inning. He was promptly picked off but -- here's what's hilarious -- he wasn't even trying to steal a base.\n\nAnd then their left fielder and shortstop collided on a fly ball that allowed 3 runs to score.\n\nGrady Sizemore got thrown out for arguing with the #clownshoes umpire who missed a call at least once per inning throughout the game until the White Sox skipper finally called him out on it. Why Sizemore waited until the 6th inning to get thrown out was the question of the night.\n\nLater on, the White Sox comically allowed yet another fly ball to drop in between three players in the outfield, almost in the exact same spot as the faux pas from earlier in the game.\n\nI could be wrong on this because I really wasn't paying attention by the time the third inning rolled around, but I'm not sure Chicago ever got a guy to third base.\n\nThe game was so bad that the broadcast team on MASN spent almost the whole night interviewing some nerd about the way the baseball spins out of a pitcher's hand and vertical drop rate, whatever that is, and a bunch of other garbage no one cares about when they're trying to watch a game.\n\nAlas, in mild defense of MASN, it was 9-0 and the game was over in the 3rd inning. You could either have Kevin Brown talk about Oasis (again) or have someone talk about spin rates on sliders.\n\nIt was dreadful.\n\nThe whole night...dreadful. The game was a nothing-burger and the White Sox are the worst team in baseball history.\n\nAnything else I say would be piling on.\n\nLet's just move on to football and my Ravens preview and the predicted Super Bowl champion for the 2024 campaign.\n\nAs you saw yesterday, I have the Ravens going 11-6 in the regular season and winning the AFC North title by virtue of a 4-2 division record vs. Cincinnati's 3-3 division record.\n\nWhat games do I have the Ravens losing? At Dallas, at Cincinnati, At Los Angeles (Chargers), at Houston, home vs. Cleveland, home vs. Philadelphia.\n\nHere's the thing: I think the Ravens have a much better chance of going 13-4 than they do going 10-7. I just don't see many dangerous games for John Harbaugh's team. And if they can, for example, pinch a road win at Dallas, Houston and/or Los Angeles, or avoid losing more than one home game, 13-4 is VERY much within reach for the Ravens.\n\nBut, as I noted here yesterday, I think their offensive line and run game are potentially problematic. It is certainly promising to note that Ronnie Stanley breezed through training camp without any issues. But we all know nothing gets solved or resolved in August. It's what Stanley does in the season that counts.\n\nA lot of the Ravens offense in 2024 depends on Derrick Henry. If he's 80% of the old Derrick Henry, the Ravens should be fine. But if he winds up being 50% (or less) of the old Derrick Henry the running game could be their achilles heel.\n\nThat said, they have Lamar Jackson. He's not really a running back, but you might have heard he's pretty good at running with the football.\n\nBaltimore's defense will lead the way in 2024.\n\nI feel confident saying that.\n\nThe Ravens offense will be \"good\". Their defense will be \"great\".\n\nJust like the old days.\n\nThe discussion in these parts throughout the season will be the same old song and dance. \"Who cares about the regular season? The playoffs are all that matters.\"\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nLamar Jackson's level of prestige in the league is directly tied to his ability to finally play in a Super Bowl next February.\n\nHe can win all the MVP awards in the world, but it's definitely Super Bowl or bust for #8.\n\nSo we already know the blueprint for the '24 campaign. Jackson will get judged on how the Ravens fare against the teams with the best QB's. Mahomes, Prescott, Allen, Burrow, Herbert. Those games will be billed as \"X vs. Lamar\". It's just the way it is.\n\nAnd no matter what the Ravens do in the regular season, they're going to be evaluated by what they do in January and January only. If they go 13-4 or 14-3 but don't make it to the Super Bowl, the season's a failure. That's the story. Better get ready for it.\n\nHere's where I'll sadly tell you......the Ravens aren't going to the Super Bowl.\n\nI wish I had better news for you.\n\nBut I don't.\n\nIn the NFC, the Rams will beat the Lions in the Championship Game, 30-23.\n\nIn the AFC, the Dolphins will beat the Texans in the Championship Game, 26-21.\n\nAnd in the Super Bowl.......\n\nIt's Miami over the L.A. Rams, 27-23.\n\nFins up.\n\nU.S. Presidents Cup captain Jim Furyk made his picks on Tuesday for the event that takes place later this month in Canada.\n\nFuryk simply went right down the points list and went with players ranked 7 through 12.\n\nWe'll give him a \"C\" for effort and a \"D\" for logic.\n\nI expected more from a varsity letterman.\n\nFuryk added the following players as his captain's picks: Sam Burns, Tony Finau, Russell Henley, Keegan Bradley, Brian Harman and Max Homa.\n\nI've said here and elsewhere on numerous prior occasions that the Presidents Cup should be treated as a mini-Ryder-Cup-tune-up when it comes to selecting the additional picks. Give guys a chance with no Ryder Cup experience who might someday make a Ryder Cup team. They'll be better served for it with some Presidents Cup experience, I believe.\n\nNo matter what the PGA Tour thinks, their event is not comparable in any way to the Ryder Cup. It's just not.\n\nQuick, name your top 5 Presidents Cup moments.\n\nSeriously. Name them.\n\nOK, name your top 3.\n\nYour top 1?\n\nOver the last 50 years, the top Ryder Cup moments are too vast to even list here.\n\nJack's conceded putt to Tony Jacklin.\n\nEurope finally winning at Muirfield Village in '87 and their whole team dancing around like Kevin Bacon in Footloose.\n\nChristy O'Connor's 3 iron and winning hole at The Belfry in 1989.\n\nThe \"War by the Shore\" at Kiawah which included more memorable moments in three days than the Presidents Cup has ever produced: Ballesteros getting into it with Azinger after a wrong ball was played; Calcavecchia collapsing over the final four holes and shanking his tee shot on the 17th hole; Langer's miss from 6 feet that gave the U.S. the win.\n\nThe U.S. failing to make a par at #18 at Oak Hill in each of the last three groups in Sunday singles to give Europe the win in '95.\n\nYou get the picture, I'm guessing.\n\nThe Ryder Cup is the biggest event in golf and nearly every other year when they play it, some sort of golf history gets made along the way.\n\nRory vs. Reed at Hazeltine.\n\nMahan's career basically ending with his flubbed chip in Ireland.\n\nThe U.S. in those hideous shirts, winning at Brookline in '99 after trailing 10-6 going into the last day.\n\nThe Ryder Cup produces spectacular history.\n\nThe Presidents Cup is pre-season football in comparison.\n\nAnd people like Furyk, who has been part of numerous failed U.S. Ryder Cup ventures, should know as well as anyone about getting younger players experience in team golf formats before unveiling the Ryder Cup to them.\n\nThat's why his picks on Tuesday were (mostly) lame.\n\nGuys like Finau don't need to play in a Presidents Cup to get experience. Sure, maybe he gets an extra $250,000 from his sponsors for making the team, but $250,000 to Finau is like $25 to you and I. He loses that much money in the washing machine every year.\n\nMax Homa labored through a pretty lousy year. He made the team mostly based off of a really good 2023. Why take him?\n\nThe same with Brian Harman. Great 2023. Good 2024.\n\nI sorta-kinda understand the Keegan Bradley pick. He's the next Ryder Cup captain so getting him in that Presidents Cup room to learn more about the other 11 guys is important. But even Bradley was a weird add in that he didn't really do anything special in '24 but then squeezed his way into the FedEx Cup playoffs and won the BMW out of nowhere.\n\nWhy not give younger players with no previous Cup experience (Presidents or Ryder) a chance to see what it's all about in the event they're part of the team at Bethpage in '25 or Ireland in '27? Bhatia, McCarthy, Thompson (two of those guys won this year and McCarthy lost in a playoff and had his best season ever) would have been perfect additions in place of Finau, Homa and Harman and I'm pretty sure the golf drop-off wouldn't have been detectable.\n\nIt just doesn't make sense.\n\nThen again, the U.S. Ryder Cup has bottomed out over the last 20 years or so in part because of peculiar picks by the captains, including the '23 edition that saw Zach Johnson embarrass himself by \"friending\" three picks to J.T., Rickie and Spieth.\n\nOnce the PGA Tour realizes the real value of the Presidents Cup is to make the U.S. Ryder Cup better, perhaps the event will finally have a level of importance that makes it worth following.\n\nTuesday\n\nSeptember 3, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3663\n\nare you ready for some football?\n\nYes, it's football season.\n\nIn these parts, at least, it's also still baseball season and will be for at least another five weeks or so.\n\nBut starting on Thursday night when the Ravens travel to Kansas City, the NFL is back to dominate the country's sports landscape through the middle of February.\n\nAnd we're here to get things kicked off today with our annual NFL predictions effort, where we tell you who is going to be good, who is going to be bad and which two teams will play for the Lombardi Trophy in five-plus months.\n\nAs you'll see below, we're very bullish on the Ravens in 2024. Sure, they have some warts. But the pieces are once again in place to have John Harbaugh's team battling for the AFC title. We're excited. I'm sure you are as well.\n\nI heard a funny joke about the Steelers on Saturday. Actually, to be exact, I read a funny joke about the Steelers. But I don't want to ruffle any feathers here. I sense people's nerves are getting frayed for whatever reason. So, I'll save it for sometime down the road.\n\nEditor's note: It's a really funny joke. Maybe later...\n\nOK, so here we go with the NFC.\n\nNFC East:\n\n1. Dallas, 11-6\n\n2. Philadelphia, 9-8\n\n3. Washington, 7-10\n\n4. NY Giants, 5-12\n\nThe NFC East hasn't produced back-to-back division champions since the Eagles won it three times in a row from 2003 through 2005. Talk about a wild division, huh? That streak ends this year when the Cowboys repeat as East titleists with an 11-6 mark. Division Hot Take: The Giants might not win 5 games. They could be really bad.\n\nNFC South:\n\n1. Atlanta, 10-7\n\n2. New Orleans, 7-10\n\n3. Tampa Bay, 7-10\n\n4. Carolina, 5-12\n\nAtlanta figures to be better with Kirk Cousins at the helm, but they're VERY fortunate to be playing in perhaps the worst division in all of football. Division Hot Take: The entire South could finish under .500. Seriously. Atlanta could win the division at 8-9.\n\nNFC North:\n\n1. Detroit, 12-5\n\n2. Green Bay, 10-7\n\n3. Chicago, 7-10\n\n4. Minnesota, 4-13\n\nIt feels weird to label the Lions as \"can't miss\", but as long as they stay healthy, they're as \"can't miss\" as any projected division winner in either conference. That said, they're still the Lions. You just never know. Division Hot Take: Green Bay is on the upswing in a big way. Don't be shocked if they're in the hunt for the North title with two weeks left.\n\nNFC West:\n\n1. LA Rams, 12-5\n\n2. San Francisco, 11-6\n\n3. Seattle, 6-11\n\n4. Arizona, 6-11\n\nIf Stafford, Nacua and Kupp are all healthy for 17 weeks, there's no telling how many passing records the Rams might set in 2024. Their defense might not be great, but a 38-30 win is just like a 21-17 win. And they're going to have a lot of 38-30 wins. Division Hot Take: The Rams or 49'ers could have one of those special seasons where they go 14-3. Both of them are going to be tough to beat.\n\nNFC Playoffs:\n\n#1 seed, LA Rams\n\n#2 seed, Detroit Lions\n\n#3 seed, Dallas Cowboys\n\n#4 seed, Atlanta Falcons\n\n#5 seed, San Francisco 49'ers\n\n#6 seed, Green Bay Packers\n\n#7 seed, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nAnd now, on to the AFC:\n\nAFC East:\n\n1. Miami, 12-5\n\n2. NY Jets, 11-6\n\n3. Buffalo, 9-8\n\n4. New England, 3-14\n\nThe times are definitely changing in the AFC East. Buffalo's reign is ending, New England is a league patsy and the Jets are riding on the back of Aaron Rodgers for at least one season. But it's the Dolphins who enter the season as the definite team to beat. Division Hot Take: New England could go 0-17. Who are they gonna beat?\n\nAFC South:\n\n1. Houston, 11-6\n\n2. Jacksonville, 10-7\n\n3. Indianapolis, 9-8\n\n4. Tennessee, 7-10\n\nMaybe this is the year Jacksonville puts it together after a couple of seasons of high promise in '22 and '23. The Texans look legit, though, with a plethora of wide receivers, including newcomer Stefon Diggs. Division Hot Take: The division winner could end up at 9-8 and the other three teams could finish 8-9 each.\n\nAFC West:\n\n1. Kansas City, 12-5\n\n2. LA Chargers, 11-6\n\n3. Denver, 6-10\n\n3. Las Vegas, 6-10\n\nYes, I'm buying stock in the Chargers. No, I have no idea why I'm doing that. K.C. and the Chargers will battle it out and both make the playoffs while Denver and Vegas will be out of the playoff race by Thanksgiving. Division Hot Take: Herbert could outplay Mahomes in 2024 and it could be LA winning the division and the Chiefs serving as the division's wild card entry.\n\nAFC North:\n\n1. Baltimore, 11-6\n\n1. Cincinnati, 11-6\n\n3. Cleveland, 8-9\n\n4. Pittsburgh, 7-10\n\nI think the Ravens offensive line and lack of a running game will be their biggest 2024 flaws. They should be very good defensively. But can they get by without being able to chew up yards on the ground? The key, of course, is Derrick Henry. If he rebounds to become \"Derrick Henry\" again, then 13-4 is a real possibility. But we're going to settle on 11-6 for now and see how things play out. The Bengals will be able to score points, but can they stop anyone? Cleveland will win 8 but no more than that. And the Steelers? Yes, indeed, it's time for a trip to the basement up there in the Steel City. Division Hot Take: The Bengals could be so bad defensively that they lose 31-27 all the time. Any chance the Ravens are the only team above .500 in the North? Definitely.\n\nAFC Playoffs:\n\n#1 seed, Miami\n\n#2 seed, Kansas City\n\n#3 seed, Baltimore\n\n#4 seed, Houston\n\n#5 seed, Cincinnati\n\n#6 seed, LA Chargers\n\n#7 seed, NY Jets\n\nAnd we'll be back here tomorrow to tell you how the playoffs shake out and who we'll be watching in the Super Bowl next February.\n\nOK, what the heck. At the risk of people getting their feelings hurt...here's the joke.\n\nA first grade teacher in Philadelphia explains to her class that she is a Philadelphia Flyers hockey fan.\n\nShe asks her students to raise their hands if they were Flyers fans, too. Not really knowing what a Flyers fan was, but wanting to be like their teacher, hands explode into the air.\n\nThere is, however, one exception. A girl named Mary has not gone along with the crowd.\n\nThe teacher asks her why she has decided to be different. \"Because I'm not a Flyers fan.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asks the teacher, \"what are you?\"\n\n\"Why I'm proud to be a Detroit Red Wings fan,\" boasts the little girl.\n\nThe teacher is a little perturbed now, her face slightly red. She asks Mary why she is a Red Wings fan.\n\n\"Well, My Dad and Mom are Red Wings fans, and I'm a Red Wings fan, too!\"\n\nThe teacher is now angry. \"That's no reason,\" she says loudly. \"What if your mom was a moron, and your dad was a moron? What would you be then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" says Mary, \"I'd be a Flyers fan.\"\n\nEditor's note: A) Now that's a funny joke. B) It was originally published as a joke about the Steelers, but I substituted the Flyers in there because I didn't want to offend any Steelers fans we might have checking in here today.\n\n\"Randy On The O's\"\n\nRandy Morgan takes #DMD readers through the recent week in Orioles baseball as the Birds try to win a second straight A.L. East title.\n\norioles week in review\n\nWeek Record: 3-3\n\nSeason Record: 80-59\n\nAL East Standing: 2nd (0.5 GB NYY)\n\nPlayer of the Week: Ramon Urias\n\nIt’s beginning to sound like a broken record here, but it was another mediocre week for the Orioles. The O’s again barely managed to tread water, with a 3-3 week against the Dodgers and Rockies. Zach Eflin returned on Sunday to salvage a .500 week.\n\nOnce again, the good news is that the Yankees were even worse this week, dropping four of six games against the non-contending Nationals and Cardinals. That leaves the O’s just a half game behind the Yanks for the division with the historically bad White Sox coming to Camden Yards for three games.\n\nThe week started off well when Cole Irvin delivered another decent spot start on Tuesday, limiting the NL leading Dodgers to two runs in just over four innings.\n\nThe O’s then got 4.2 shutout innings from Bowman, Perez, Cano and Dominguez out of the bullpen. A Ryan O’Hearn homer put them up early before Ramon Urias hit a two-run shot to put the O’s ahead for good in a 3-2 win.\n\nOn Wednesday the string of bad starts continued for Corbin Burnes. Though the defense was partially to blame with five unearned runs, Burnes continued to get hit by opposing bats, allowing six runs on five hits in five innings.\n\nWe’ll have more on Burnes' struggles in the Question of the Week, but this start put the O’s in a big hole. Three more shutout innings from the bullpen and another strong night from Urias helped keep the game close but the Birds couldn’t touch the Dodgers bullpen, falling 6-4.\n\nIn the rubber match on Thursday Los Angeles jumped out to a 5-0 lead by the 4th inning on another tough night for Cade Povich (or “Slim” if you prefer). The alter ego did not help the rookie at all on this night as he only lasted 3.1 innings, allowing five runs on ten hits.\n\nWith Eflin returning to the rotation it seems Povich’s time may be short in the majors. Colton Cowser hit a three-run bomb in the 5th to give the O’s some hope but that was as close as they would get in a 6-3 loss.\n\nThe Orioles left LA and traveled to Denver, looking to turn things around against the struggling Rockies. On Friday night they had the right man on the mound to facilitate that, as Albert Suarez once again threw a gem.\n\nSuarez came up with his longest outing of the season, throwing seven innings and limiting Colorado to just two runs. The newly acquired Emmanuel Rivera had the hot bat on Friday, driving in a run in the 2nd to put the O’s up 1-0 then blasting a two-run homer in the 4th that gave them a 3-2 lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\nA Jackson Holliday triple in the stadium his father played extended the lead and Seranthony Dominguez notched another save for 5-3 win.\n\nThat was followed by a letdown on Saturday. The Rockies, in their well executed City Connect jerseys (as opposed to the local team), got to Dean Kremer early, pushing across three runs in the 2nd inning.\n\nKremer settled down but was unfortunately forced out of the game in the 4th after taking a line drive off his forearm. The Birds battled back with homers from Anthony Santander and Eloy Jimenez, then a two-run single from O’Hearn in the 5th. However, that only set up another meltdown from maligned former-closer Craig Kimbrel, who came on in the 8th and promptly allowed two runs, dooming the O’s to a 7-5 loss.\n\nLuckily, Zach Eflin came off the IL on Sunday and picked up right where he left off. Eflin delivered a masterful seven innings, limiting the Rockies to one run on four hits with one walk and nine strikeouts.\n\nHe has been everything the O’s could have wished for in a deadline acquisition and more. At this point it would not be surprising if he is starting game one of a playoff series.\n\nNo player really jumped off the page for this edition of the Player of the Week. Albert Suarez and Zach Eflin certainly deserve consideration for their impeccable starts. Anthony Santander had a strong week at the plate with a crucial home run while batting .300 on the week.\n\nBut this week we give the award to Ramon Urias, who, despite missing Sunday after going to the IL with a sprained ankle, put up a .411 on-base percentage with a clutch homer and four RBI.\n\nUrias has been absolutely crucial for the Orioles over the past few weeks, regaining his starting role when Coby Mayo was sent back to the minors and taking full advantage of his renewed status.\n\nDown on the Farm –\n\nThere weren’t many standouts on the farm this week. The most notable development was the promotion of top catching prospect Samuel Basallo to AAA Norfolk. Basallo was adjusting to the new level this week, posting just a .512 OPS, but he did manage his first AAA homer in just his third game at Norfolk.\n\nCoby Mayo did not have a banner week either, going just 2-15 but hitting his team-leading 22nd homer before being called back up to the Orioles with the September roster expansion.\n\nAt AA Bowie, 2023 1st round pick Enrique Bradfield Jr. cooled off after a hot start, going just 2-16 on the week. The big name at Bowie this week was 21 year old catching prospect Creed Willems, who went deep twice in just his second game in AA.\n\nQuestion of the Week –\n\nWhat is wrong with Corbin Burnes?\n\nThe ace the Orioles brought in over the winter had exceeded expectations through the end of July. Burnes finished that month with a 2.47 ERA and was among the favorites for the AL Cy Young award. Then what seemed like a couple of rough outings to start August spiraled into one of the worst stretches of his career.\n\nAfter another poor outing this week (albeit with only one earned run), Burnes has allowed the following in his five August starts:\n\n* 5.2 IP 3R\n\n* 3.2IP 7R\n\n* 6IP 5R\n\n* 5.2IP 5R\n\nThat resulted in a 7.36 ERA for the month, and that is helped by the last start in which five of the runs were unearned.\n\nThis is easily the worst stretch of his career since the start of 2019, when he had a 10.70 ERA through his first five starts of the season and was demoted to the bullpen for the remainder of the year. Since then his worst month was August 2022, when he posted a 4.81 ERA.\n\nBurnes was the picture of consistency through his first 22 starts of the season, where he delivered a quality start in all but three. So what changed for Burnes in August to cause this sharp drop off? Has he begun to get fatigued and lost velocity? Has he lost his control of the strike zone or command of his breaking pitches? Or has he just had a run of bad luck?\n\nAs stated above the numbers for August are pretty ugly. The 7.36 ERA along with a 1.60 WHIP. Looking at more advanced metrics, his Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) was 4.81, which suggests he deserved somewhat better than the 7+ ERA, but still not his usual self.\n\nPerhaps the most worrying part of the FIP number is that it has gone up in each month this season, from 2.56 in May to 3.79 in June, to 4.02 in July. Opposing hitters have a .304 batting average against Burnes in August, which is significantly worse than the .231 in his next-worst month.\n\nDiving deeper into the numbers, his strikeouts are down, with his 22 in August the lowest of any month and his 18.5% strikeout percentage his lowest by a good amount. While the strikeouts are down, his walk rate has been consistent, so it doesn’t seem that his overall control has fallen off.\n\nIn August, batters hit line drives 23.6% of the time, well higher than the rest of the season, where the previous worst month was May with 17.8%. Burnes has also allowed an elevated HR rate in August at 15.6% and his highest hard hit rate at 38.9%, though that number was only slightly more than in June.\n\nThe exit velocities off his changeup, sinker, slider and cutter have all jumped in August with his sinker showing the biggest drop in effectiveness.\n\nOne number that really stands out for the last month is a highly elevated BABIP (Batting Average on Balls in Play). Burnes has allowed a .277 BABIP in his career and prior to August his worst month this season was May, with a .294 BABIP.\n\nIn August that jumped to .341. Burnes has also struggled massively with runners on base in August, stranding only 38.2% of runners as opposed to over 76% every other month.\n\nThese stats may be partially explained by the increase in line drives and home runs hit off him, but given that the hard hit and exit velocities were only slightly higher, it may suggest Burnes has had some significant bad luck as well.\n\nSo it seems that Burnes has been both more hittable and more unlucky in the past month. That leads one to ask what might have changed about his pitches or approach that have enabled hitters to have more success.\n\nLooking at this pitch data on Baseball Savant provides some insight. While Burnes had the lowest velocity of the year in his most recent start, the previous four were all in line with his average for the year. In addition, the velocity on all of his pitches has remained consistent throughout this season. So if this is fatigue, it doesn’t appear to be affecting his velocity to a large degree.\n\nMaybe it could be related to the mix of pitches he’s throwing at hitters? Burnes has gradually thrown his cutter less over the course of the season, but it is still by far his most frequent pitch at 41.7% in August, compared to 46% in May.\n\nIn August Burnes has used slightly more of his changeup and sinker compared to his other offspeed and breaking pitches, but there’s nothing in the pitch mix that suggests the sharp drop off in effectiveness.\n\nIf his velocity hasn’t declined and his pitch mix doesn’t appear to be a major factor, perhaps the pitches he’s throwing are just less effective? This appears to be where we may find a clue to why Burnes has been struggling in August.\n\nWhile the spin rates on all his pitches have remained consistent throughout the season, some of the other numbers have dropped. Both the Swing and Miss and Chase and Miss percentages have declined for his slider, curveball, cutter and changeup in August.\n\nAdditionally, the Whiff percentage and Put Away percentage are down for both his cutter and breaking pitches.\n\nAfter delving into the advanced numbers for Burnes in August, it’s hard to draw any distinct conclusions. It’s clear hitters are having more success against him, but there isn’t a clear drop in his velocity or spin rates on his pitches.\n\nHe’s not walking more batters and he appears to have consistent location statistics with the rest of the season. Despite that, he has been missing fewer bats and getting less hitters to chase his breaking pitches. His slider in particular seems less effective.\n\nUltimately there isn’t anything in the numbers that suggests Burnes can’t turn this around. It would be especially concerning if we were seeing decreasing velocity or loss of control. Neither of these have caused the decline.\n\nIf there is any fatigue it isn’t showing up in obvious ways. Perhaps some arm fatigue is contributing to the reduction in swing and miss on his breaking pitches.\n\nThe Orioles have seemed reluctant to push Burnes up in the rotation to pitch on normal rest when off days have allowed, so they may be protecting his arm. However, any fatigue he has appears to be more mental than physical.\n\nThe issue may just be missing his spots in key moments and not locating his pitches as precisely as he needs to in high leverage situations. There also appears to be some bad luck baked in with where the ball is landing when hitters make contact, and that should regress to the mean sooner or later.\n\nIn the end there appears to be little reason for concern. The Orioles need Burnes to right the ship ASAP and there’s no reason to believe he can’t do that. From a velocity and stuff standpoint, Burnes looks to be the same pitcher he’s been all season.\n\nThat should give confidence he will get back to his winning ways in time to resume his ace role in the playoffs.\n\nMonday\n\nSeptember 2, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3662\n\nworried? don't be\n\nHappy Labor Day to all.\n\nAs is our annual custom here, we'll be offering a truncated version of #DMD today in honor of the holiday.\n\nI know what Flyers and Beatles fans are thinking.\n\nTruncated means shortened or curtailed.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nThese are anxious days in The Land of Pleasant Living as the baseball schedule moves into September and the A.L. East steamrolls in the direction of a fantastic finish later this month.\n\nThe Birds are now a half-game out of first after Sunday's 6-1 win at Colorado coupled with the Yankees' 14-7 home loss to the Cardinals.\n\nAt stake over the final month? A division title and a (likely) first-round bye as long as the A.L. East winner finishes with the first or second best record in the league.\n\nSome folks think the division crown is overrated. There are those who think a wild card berth isn't all that bad, particularly since it means you just keep on playing after the regular season concludes instead of waiting around the better part of a full week to resume your 2024 post-season.\n\nWhat do we think here at #DMD?\n\nWe'll take the division title if we can, in fact, win it.\n\nNot playing in the A.L. Wild Card series means you're one step closer to the World Series. You can't lose in the A.L. Wild Card series if you don't play in it.\n\nSo, our preference here is to see the O's win the division title.\n\nBut if it works out that Baltimore finishes second, then a wild card series it is.\n\nAnd what do we think is going to happen? Well, we're glad you asked.\n\nSee below...\n\nYankees (79-58) remaining schedule and predicted wins/losses:\n\nat Texas, 3 (W, L, L)\n\nat Cubs, 3 (L, W, L)\n\nvs. Kansas City, 3 (W, L, W)\n\nvs. Boston, 4 (W, L, L, W)\n\nat Seattle, 3 (W, W, L)\n\nat Oakland, 3 (W, W, L)\n\nvs. Baltimore, 3 (L, L, W)\n\nvs. Pittsburgh, 3 (W, L, W)\n\nFinal record: 92-70\n\nOrioles (79-59) remaining schedule and predicted wins/losses:\n\nvs. White Sox, 3 (W, W, W)\n\nvs. Tampa Bay, 3 (L, W, W)\n\nat Boston, 4 (W, L, W, L)\n\nat Detroit, 3 (W, L, L)\n\nvs. San Francisco, 3 (W, W, L)\n\nvs. Detroit, 3 (W, W, W)\n\nat Yankees, 3 (W, W, L)\n\nat Minnesota, 3 (L, W, W)\n\nFinal rercord: 96-66\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nRest easy O's fans.\n\nThis one's in the books.\n\nA second straight A.L. East title, which will actually be clinched in New York in the penultimate series of the campaign in late September.\n\nWon't that be something?\n\nCelebrating with tee shirts and champagne in the Bronx.\n\nAin't the beer cold?\n\nEnjoy your holiday and come back around tomorrow for Randy Morgan's weekly in-depth O's recap and our 2024 NFL predictions column where we tell you just how far the Ravens will go in this season's playoffs.\n\nSunday\n\nSeptember 1, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3661\n\nthree things i believe in\n\nThat was amateur hour last night in Colorado.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't the lowly Rockies who were the \"amateur\" part of that statement.\n\nIt was our Orioles who spit the bit.\n\nColorado won the game, 7-5, after Craig Kimbrel -- I know you're shocked -- came in to pitch the 8th inning with the game tied at 5-5 and promptly gave up two runs.\n\nKimbrel stinks. We all know that. Brandon Hyde knows it. But his options last night were limited because Dean Kremer left the game in the 4th inning after being hit by a line drive and the O's bullpen had to work overtime.\n\nSo, as much as it's easy to pin the defeat on Kimbrel, there were so many other moments-of-fault that I don't know where to start.\n\nThere were passed balls (Rutschman).\n\nFailure to cut the ball off and allowing runners to advance (O'Hearn).\n\nLaziness from/in the outfield that allowed Rockies runners to take an extra base (Cowser, Mullins).\n\nFailure to drive in runners in scoring position (Rutschman, Jimenez, Holliday, Henderson (again), Cowser).\n\nStolen bases off of Kimbrel and Cano.\n\nIncredibly inefficient trips at the plate (Cowser).\n\nIt all added up to a bad loss against a really bad team.\n\nKimbrel got most of the heat on social media after the game but he's low hanging fruit at this point. If he's pressed into duty, it's very likely he's going to give up runs and/or have a direct impact on the game.\n\nAll the other stuff, though, needs to be cleaned up so Kimbrel isn't in the game in the first place.\n\nThis, unfortunately, has been going on for a while now. Saturday night wasn't an outlier. The fundamentals and the approach at the plate have been \"off\" for the better part of a month.\n\nEveryone scuffles at some point in a 162-game season. It's inevitable. Some folks scuffle for a series and some scuffle for a month.\n\nRutschman, Henderson and Cowser have tailed off over the last 30 games, even if their \"slash line\" doesn't totally reflect that.\n\nAll three are a strike out waiting to happen at the plate. And their defensive capabilities have also taken a hit of late.\n\nThere was a joke floating around on Twitter this week that depicted Rutschman as Matt Wieters 2.0.\n\nA day later, someone chimed in: \"You're being disrespectful to Matt Wieters with that comparison.\"\n\nThere is good news, though.\n\nThe schedule turns in the O's favor with three straight wins vs. the White Sox coming up this week in Baltimore, followed by a weekend visit from a Tampa Bay team that is pretty much done.\n\nThere's still one more game in Denver today. Let's hope the O's look more like a major league team in the series finale vs. the Rockies than they looked in last night's 7-5 loss.\n\nAmateur hour.\n\nYour mileage may vary on these three.\n\nYou can use the Comments section below to agree with my three. Or disagree with them. And you can also simply add three of your own and then everyone else can chop away at your three.\n\nThis all sorta-kinda started on Friday night when I told a couple of friends that I have this weird feeling Eloy Jimenez is going to have a big hit for the Orioles, either late in the regular season or in the playoffs.\n\n\"He's this team's Delmon Young from 2014,\" I told the two of them.\n\n\"He's a bum,\" my friend Mark countered.\n\nLook, I understand why most O's fans aren't all that hot and bothered by Jimenez. Sure, he's hitting .300 for the O's in his one month with the team, but it's hard to feel all warm and fuzzy about the former White Sox slugger when you see him hit a grounder to shortstop and lollygag his way down the first base line before being thrown out by six steps.\n\nHe just has the look of a dude who only tries when he wants to try.\n\nThat said, I mentioned when he was acquired from Chicago that you can't ever under-estimate the value of a fresh start, particularly for someone like Jimenez who was rumored to be a clubhouse downer in the Windy City.\n\nAnd one of the things I believe is Jimenez is going to have a big hit for the Orioles in September or October.\n\nAnd by \"big hit\", I mean a hit that helps give the Birds a playoff spot or the A.L. East title or, like Young did in 2014, a Jimenez hit in the post-season carries the Orioles to a magical win.\n\nLet's hope I'm right. Right?\n\nI've thought long and hard about this one over the last few days. In my lifetime, I can think of only three athletes who immediately fulfilled their promise and, at the same time, changed their sport.\n\nNot Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. Neither of them did it immediately.\n\nNot Michael Jordan, either. It took him a little while, as well.\n\nTiger Woods was the first one.\n\nHe won three straight U.S. Junior Amateur titles and followed that up with three straight U.S. Amateur trophies. No one ever did that before Woods, no one has done it since, and no one will ever do it again.\n\nTiger was going to turn professional and turn the world of professional golf on its ears.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened.\n\nWe've never really seen anyone like him. Showed up, beat everyone like a drum for the better part of two decades, and became the biggest needle-mover in the history of golf.\n\nAnd the thing is, he was supposed to be that great. And he delivered.\n\nThe same goes for LeBron James.\n\nHe might not have revolutionized basketball the way Tiger changed golf, but James did revolutionize the position he played when he joined the NBA straight out of high school.\n\n\"The Chosen One\" was the headline Sports Illustrated decided on when they profiled LeBron in his junior year of high school.\n\nImagine being a high school junior and the (then) top sports publication in America writes a story predicting you're going to take the NBA by storm. You're 16 years old and you're the \"chosen one\".\n\nAnd then you go on to take the NBA by storm, just like they said you would.\n\nTwo decades later, you're one of the greatest players to ever play the game. Multiple championships. First ballot Hall of Fame inductee someday down the road.\n\nIt's rare someone comes along and delivers on all the promise, but James did it.\n\nOne of the things I believe is Caitlin Clark is going to have the same impact in the WNBA that James had in the NBA. But unlike James, who came into an established league and dominated, Clark is one-upping him.\n\nCaitlin Clark has put the WNBA on the map.\n\nOh, sure, the WNBA has been around for 27 years. But no one cared about the WNBA for, oh, about 26 of those 27 years.\n\nBut people are starting to care now. And Caitlin Clark is the reason.\n\nIs she the best player in the league? I have no idea. Like 95% of everyone else in America, I couldn't name 10 players in the league, let alone argue with you about who is the best player.\n\nI know Caitlin Clark, though.\n\nAnd I know she's great at basketball.\n\nAnd I also know that prior to her showing up in the WNBA, the league was just a bunch of women playing basketball and no one knew who was winning the games, who was winning the MVP or who was winning the league title.\n\nBut everyone knows her. And they know she's a rock star.\n\nEven the players in the league know it. They're envious of her, but, yes, they also know she's the straw that stirs the drink.\n\nShe was a world-beater at the University of Iowa, but there were a few people who scoffed at her talents and said, \"Let's see how it translates to the pro game.\"\n\nWell, here we are.\n\nShe's clobbering fools in the WNBA on a nightly basis.\n\nAnd she's doing it -- most importantly -- in front of sold out arenas all over the country. She's appointment viewing, either in person or are on TV.\n\nCaitlin Clark has changed women's basketball in this country.\n\nThe O's downturn over the last two months has been talked about here ad nauseum and has been dissected over and over (and over) on social media.\n\nInjuries have hurt the club. No two ways about it.\n\nThe offense hasn't been very good since mid-June.\n\nThe team was struggling in July and people said, \"That's what the trade deadline is for...\"\n\nThen the trade deadline came and went and the Birds made one really nice move (Eflin), a move that has paid \"some\" dividends (Dominguez) and a move that could turn into something down the road (Jimenez).\n\nBut there was also a trade for Trevor Rogers that backfired. And not just because Connor Norby has been tearing it up in Miami.\n\nFor all of those moments, though, one of the things I believe is the club's ultimate mistake in 2024 is/was keeping Craig Kimbrel around.\n\nIt's not the worst part of their season. The team's failure to drive in runners in scoring position trumps the Kimbrel decision.\n\nBut they \"control\" the Kimbrel decision.\n\nI understand dealing Austin Hays for Seranthony Dominguez, although it's probably fair to remind you there wouldn't have been an urgent need for him had Kimbrel been effective in 2024.\n\nAustin Hays was no world beater, obviously, but he was almost a regular, every day kind of player that you swapped for a relief pitcher with a spotty track record in Philadelphia.\n\nI understand adding Zach Eflin, particularly pretty-much-knowing you're not going to be able to keep Corbin Burnes.\n\nI even see the logic in adding the mercurial Eloy Jimenez. You didn't give up anything to get him. So why not? Sure, he could wind up being a clubhouse problem like he was in Chicago, but if that part of Jimenez shows up in Baltimore, you DFA him after a few weeks and no-fuss-no-muss.\n\nAnd I know Rogers was terrible most of the year in Miami and in his limited time in Baltimore, but the Birds needed a lefty starter and they didn't want to give up a garage full of high-level prospects for Crochet or Skubal.\n\nYes, Kikuchi was available in Toronto, but the Astros gave up a treasure chest for him, don't forget.\n\nAll that said...\n\nElias should have cut Kimbrel loose a month ago.\n\nFrankly, he probably should have DFA'd Kimbrel in mid-July when the GM still had time to find someone else.\n\nI get it, he makes $13 million and no one likes paying a player while he sits at home.\n\nBut Kimbrel has been a massive liability.\n\nI'm not trying to pile on the guy, by the way. He's had a very good career, has Kimbrel.\n\nBut the sun has set on his time in the big leagues.\n\nFather Time always wins.\n\nSaturday\n\nAugust 31, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3660\n\nyou're making it worse\n\nI shared a late summer refreshment with two friends yesterday. We met up at a nice watering hole in the Towson area to chat about life, the O's, golf and anything else that came to mind.\n\nAs it happens these days, a couple of young adults came in and their appearance was, let's just say, \"different\".\n\nAnd I don't mean \"odd\" different. I just mean they were dressed and looked different than the other 30 or so people who were in the place at the time.\n\nThey were male and female. The male had, by rough estimation, 90% of his visible body covered with tattoos. And he had at least a dozen piercings of some kind on his face, head, ears, etc.\n\nThe female was similar in nature.\n\nI think, by today's standards, they're considering \"alternative\". Which is fine by me. I generally don't get worked up about tattoos and piercings and such.\n\nIn 1980 in Glen Burnie, if you were a guy with a piercing you were definitely considered weird.\n\nIn 2024, you're probably weird if you don't have a piercing or a tattoo.\n\nAnyway...\n\nMark gestures in their direction and says, \"What do you think happened to them?\"\n\nMy other friend said, \"Maybe they both got the score run up on them in a soccer game when they were 15 years old and never recovered.\"\n\nWe laughed.\n\nMinutes before, we were talking about the incident from the night before when the Howard University coach took exception to a late touchdown from a Rutgers running back.\n\nThat's why Dan chimed in with his remark about the soccer game and the score being run up and how that might have impacted the two new visitors in the bar.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that it's highly unlikely a sports result of any kind \"changed\" those two. I have no idea why they dress and look the way they do but I suspect it's more personal preference and style than anything else.\n\nThis entry today isn't about two young adults and the ever-changing world we live in.\n\nI brought that story up to highlight the Howard University/Rutgers incident from Thursday night.\n\nI can't imagine one kid from Howard University is going to be scarred for life because a Rutgers running back bolted into the end zone with no time left to turn a 37-7 loss into a 44-7 loss in August of 2024.\n\nI just don't think, five years from now, two young males will wander into a Washington D.C. bar with tattoos and piercings (or anything else that distinctively makes them look \"different\") and two guests will whisper, \"Look, it's those two guys who were on the Howard football team the year Rutgers ran up the score on them. That game sure did change them.\"\n\nThis topic of \"running up the score\" in sports has been gaining steam for a long time in our country.\n\nIt's useless going into a wide ranging discussion about it here because ultimately the direction of the discourse changes from sports to the way children are being raised in this generation and then people's feelings get hurt and everything gets mucked up in the end.\n\nMark, Dan and I eventually did shift our get together to sports, like we always do, and I was adamant with them about one thing: Sportsmanship, for the most part, is a dying theme.\n\nEvery tackle or touchdown in football now includes a dance or some other 5-second \"act\" that is largely done to show up the opposing player or team. Every dunk includes theatrics and taunting. Every home run now includes a bat flip, which may or may not earn you a ball in the ribs depending on how \"unsportsmanlike\" the opposing team believes that stunt to be.\n\nI say this all the time. Taunting is as much a part of the NFL and college football as are commercials about sports gambling. It's just the way athletes are conditioned these days.\n\n\"Look what I did to you...\"\n\nIt's not a new trend, mind you. But it's never reverting back to what it once was. Isn't there a saying about not being able to put the toothpaste back in the tube or something like that?\n\nAnd I'm not saying what happened on Thursday night was, in any way, unsportsmanlike. I'm actually saying the opposite.\n\nIt's a football game. People are trying to impress the coaches. They're athletes. They're conditioned by the coaches to pursue excellence.\n\nWhat happened was Howard's defense couldn't stop the Rutgers offense on the game's final play.\n\nThat's actually what happened.\n\nWhether Rutgers should have been \"trying\" to score at the end is the actual root of the discussion and that's where \"sportsmanship\" comes into the discussion. And you (and I) might have been raised to sit on the ball there and not score. I get that. But that was then and this is now.\n\nI almost look at it like this: 50 years ago, men were conditioned to hold the door open for women because it was the \"gentlemanly\" thing to do. Heck, I'm old. I still do it if the opportunity presents itself.\n\nBut what we've discovered over the last, say, 20 years, is that we should simply be holding the door open for one another, no matter your gender. Or your race. Or the way you look or dress. Just hold the door open because it's the right thing to do, period.\n\nI've never liked seeing blowouts in sports. I do understand how it looks when a football score is 55-0 or a basketball score is 98-34 or a baseball score is 18-3.\n\nAnd, yes, I also understand that younger athletes -- in their teens, say -- are far more prone to emotional distress over a loss than an adult might be. But part of that is because of social media, instant reaction, pictures up everywhere, etc.\n\n50 years ago if Glen Burnie soccer lost 10-0 to someone, it could be days before I was confronted with it once the story ran in the Maryland Gazette.\n\nToday, you're on the bus riding home from the game and the score is posted about five minutes after the final whistle and your friends are hammering at you with laughing emojis because you lost 10-0.\n\nTimes are different.\n\nBut what's really happening is we're failing to coach these young boys and girls about the realities of life.\n\nIf you open a business at age 25, your competitors are going to want you to fail. They are going to try to stomp you into the ground.\n\nIf your business starts to flourish, rival companies will try to steal your best employees.\n\nCompetition is everywhere in life and you are going to lose and sometimes you're going to lose by a little and sometimes you're going to get completely squashed. And your job is to accept it and try to improve upon it.\n\nThe Howard University coach using his platform to whine about that final touchdown was useless.\n\nSure, he was trying to protect his players and all. I get that. But they're men. Young men, perhaps, but they're men. They get it. They're still getting their NIL money and their off campus apartment whether that kid from Rutgers scores to make it 44-7 or takes a knee on the one yard line to keep the score at 37-7.\n\nAnd if the Howard players were that upset about the \"extra touchdown\", here's a novel idea: Someone tackle the dude before he gets into the end zone.\n\nBlaming the other team's coach because their football team was better than your football team is #clownshoes stuff.\n\nMy very first MIAA match, back in 2011 when I was coaching for John Carroll, came against Mount Saint Joseph, who at the time were one of the league's golfing powerhouses.\n\nThey beat us 21-0 and my six players won a total of 3 holes on the day. Three holes. It was a blowout of epic proportions.\n\nWhen we finished the match and I gathered my team together, I said to them: \"That team we played today...is exactly the kind of team and program I want to build here at John Carroll. We have a lot of work ahead of us to get there. I'll see you guys tomorrow at practice and we'll start working towards that.\"\n\nWhat was I going to do? Beat up their kids and coaching staff for not \"letting\" us win at least one point? Scream about how unfair it was for one of their guys to make a 20-foot putt on the 12th green to make the final 21-0 instead of 20-1?\n\n\"We need to get better...\"\n\nThat's the only message those kids from Howard needed to hear on Thursday night.\n\nTaking a minute of your time in the press conference to cry about a meaningless touchdown was a minute you could have used to speak glowingly about the performance of a player or two on your team who were excellent despite the loss.\n\nI don't know, man. I just don't understand what these coaches are thinking about when they complain about late baskets, late home runs or late touchdowns.\n\nYou spend 60 hours a week telling your players to never quit, never back down and never take the opponent lightly.\n\nAnd then, when the other team does that exact same thing to you -- because their coach was telling them to do it -- it's somehow wrong and unsportsmanlike?\n\nJust go get better and stop being so soft.\n\nFriday\n\nAugust 30, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3659\n\ni'm not dodging the questions\n\nThey've been piling up and I'm here to answer them.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to briefly mention the game last night in Los Angeles.\n\nThe O's collected a grand total of 4 hits in the game, sports fans.\n\nColton Cowser provided the only big moment of the night with a 3-run homer to cut a 5-0 lead to 5-3, but Brandon Hyde fell asleep in the 8th inning and left Matt Bowman in the game to load the bases and the Dodgers tacked on a final run in a 6-3 victory.\n\nCade Povich wasn't very good. That is, unless you think allowing 11 base runners in 3.1 innings is \"good\".\n\nBut the bullpen was actually very efficient until Bowman -- pitching for the 3rd time in 4 games -- completely ran out of gas in his second inning of work. Keegan Akin came in and promptly gave up a first pitch, run scoring, sacrifice fly, but those who followed Povich on Thursday night were in no way responsible for the 6-3 defeat.\n\nThis one -- stop me if you heard it before -- was on the bats. Period.\n\n4 lousy hits. We call that a \"Depeche Mode\" around here.\n\nGunnar Henderson came up with the bases loaded and 2 outs in the 7th inning and struck out to end the inning. He doesn't get all the blame, of course. But that was a big moment in a (fairly) big game and he totally whiffed...no pun intended.\n\nThere were also a couple of defensive miscues, including Adley Rutschman inexplicably picking up a ball that was CLEARLY going to roll foul in the first inning (fortunately no runs scored as a result) and Colton Cowser fiddling around with the ball in the 4th inning and allowing a base runner to go from first to second (and he eventually did score).\n\nThere was a comical botched run down later on in the game where Jackson Holliday couldn't make a 15-foot throw to Ryan O'Hearn at first base.\n\nShaky starting pitching.\n\n4 hits.\n\nIndifferent defense (and that's being kind).\n\nFailure to drive in runners in scoring position.\n\nIt all added up to another loss.\n\nEditor's note: I think Depeche Mode had a lot more than four really good songs. I love their Greatest Hits CD. But I think they pretty much had 4 hits; Enjoy The Silence, Personal Jesus, Strangelove and Policy of Truth. Further, \"Violator\" is one of the best 25 albums of my life. Maybe even top 15 if I really tried to put the list together.\n\nOn to Colorado the Birds go. They're playing a bad team in a stadium where the ball travels. There better be a double-digit offensive eruption in one of these upcoming three games.\n\nFor the Orioles, that is.\n\nAnd now...we tackle your questions.\n\nMark asks -- \"I know you wrote earlier this week that Dodgers Stadium is the best baseball ballpark you've ever been in but what's the best football stadium you've ever been in?\"\n\nDF says -- \"I've been in fewer football stadiums, for starters. I think I've been to 22 or 23 baseball stadiums. Here's the NFL football stadiums I've seen games in:\n\nBaltimore, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Meadowlands, Philadelphia, New England, Buffalo, Charlotte, Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Kansas City, Arizona, Indianapolis and Nashville.\n\nI tend to rate stadiums based on the \"experience\". I'm generally not big on the \"cosmetics\" of stadiums. For instance, I think the baseball stadium in Pittsburgh is the best \"facility\" I've been in. I'm not talking about the view of downtown and that kind of stuff. I'm talking about just sitting in the ballpark and looking at the way it was built. I think Pittsburgh's awesome.\n\nTo me, football stadiums are just big circular buildings with seats in them where people convene to watch football. There's not really much to them.\n\nI'm working hard to answer this question. I think the best stadium I've been in -- for football -- is Atlanta. And I'm not a huge indoor stadium guy, either, but that one has the retractable roof that makes it at least \"feel\" outdoorsy when it's open.\"\n\nTim in Hunt Valley asks -- \"I haven't seen your Presidents Cup captain's picks. Who do you think the U.S. should add to the team?\"\n\nDF says -- \"I'll be honest. I'm pretty removed from the Presidents Cup. It's not appointment viewing like the Ryder Cup is, at least not to me. I just pulled up the names of the six automatic guys, so here's who I would add.\n\nBut first, let me also say this, and then I'll tell you who the other six should be. I believe the Presidents Cup should attempt to serve as a bit of a feeder system for the Ryder Cup. I realize the PGA Tour runs the Presidents Cup and the PGA of America runs the Ryder Cup and the two events are really in no way connected at all.\n\nThat said, I think it would help our Ryder Cup chances if we gave some younger players (without Ryder Cup experience\") a chance to get their feet wet in the Presidents Cup. A great example of this would have been someone like Sahith Theegala had he not made the team automatically on points.\n\nAnyway, with all that on the table, here's the six I would add if they gave me the keys: Keegan Bradley, Russell Henley, Akshay Bhatia, Sam Burns, Davis Thompson and Billy Horschel.\n\nThompson would be the most controversial of those picks because he's in 22nd place in the standings with 2800 points, but he's somewhere around 10th or 11th in 2024 points. He didn't really register any points a year ago. He's a very nice young player who played well in the U.S. Open in June and also won his first TOUR event a few weeks later.\"\n\nDan Fink asks -- \"You can't pick Mahomes or Lamar. Who is going to be the NFL MVP in 2024?\"\n\nDF says -- \"Can I say \"no one\"? If not Mahomes or Lamar, then who? Wow. It can't be Josh Allen. It can't be Justin Herbert. (I'm just thinking about QB's at this point, obviously). It could be someone like Cooper Kupp or Tyreek Hill, I guess.\n\nAnd I'll give you a crazy pick that might not be that crazy because, A) He's probably still pretty good and, B) If it's not Mahomes or Lamar, he's the one QB who could lead his team to 13 wins.\n\nYes, I'm talking about Aaron Rodgers.\n\nLook, he could be washed up for all we know. Would it shock me if he's incredibly mediocre in 2024? Not at all. But he's been off for a year, lots of time to recover, and the Jets will certainly throw the ball a lot.\n\nBut if you're pressing me for one guy other than Lamar and Mahomes, I'll go with Tyreek Hill. If he stays healthy, he's virtually unstoppable (assuming his #1 QB also stays healthy).\"\n\nRick asks -- \"What is the 2025 fate of these Orioles? McCann, Burnes and Santander. Thanks, Drew, Go Hall!\"\n\nDF says -- \"Keep, gone and gone. And don't forget, they have to do something with Ryan O'Hearn as well. They have a club option on him for $7.5 million. I assume they're keeping O'Hearn, especially at $7.5 million.\n\nI think they like what McCann gives them. He's a solid stop-gap until Samuel Basallo is ready. Personally, it feels like he plays a little too much given his general lack of offensive production, but maybe they're trying to ease the burden on Rutschman.\n\nAnyway, McCann's a keeper, for now, until the aforementioned Basallo is ready to make the move to the big leagues. He'll be up soon, but it feels like next April might be a tad too soon. And they can give McCann a one-year deal worth $5M or $6M and he'll be pleased as punch. Every year in the majors is a golden parachute for him at this point.\n\nBurnes will most certainly sign somewhere else. The usual suspects will be in play; Dodgers, Yankees, Rangers, Astros, Mets, etc. My wild card would be the Giants.\n\nSantander will also sign elsewhere. He just feels like a perfect L.A. Angels signing, doesn't he? 4 years, $100 million or something along those lines. Way overpaid. Just a typical Angels free agent signing. I could also see the Red Sox sniffing around Santander. Switch hitter and all. Might be a good fit at Fenway.\"\n\nKevin Jerns asks -- \"I'm a 15 handicap golfer who just picked up the game 2 summers ago, but I spend a lot of time watching You Tube and videos of the PGA Tour stars. How does Scottie Scheffler play the way he plays with his right foot moving in the down swing like it does?\"\n\nDF says -- \"Interesting question. Quick answer is this: It's not really moving in the downswing. It moves at impact or just a millisecond before. It probably looks like it's moving in the downswing, but it isn't. He's using the movement of his right foot at impact to get all of his weight moving forward and left.\n\nThe other interesting thing Scheffler does in his swing (and this does happen in his downswing) is he's one of the only players on the TOUR who actually moves his head back as the club approaches the ball. It's very hard to see at regular speed, but if you get a good down the line view of his swing in slow motion, you'll see that his head moves back as he swings down to the ball.\"\n\nT.J. -- \"Hey DF, I assume you'll be doing NFL predictions for the season before the Ravens/Chiefs so maybe you'll answer this then but do you have two teams that will be surprises in a good way and two teams who are going to be surprises in a bad way for the upcoming football season?\"\n\nDF says -- \"Sure. Buffalo will be down. Won't make the playoffs. The Browns will also decline. They won't make it, either.\n\nOn the good side, I think Houston is going to be very good (I know they made it last year, but that was because no one else in the division was all that good) and I suspect the Chargers are also going to be surprisingly good, despite their maniacal head coach.\"\n\nOh, and, yes, I'll have my season predictions early next week here at #DMD.\"\n\nG.M. asks -- \"I know the O's are loaded with minor league prospects itching for a chance to come up and play regularly but do you see any free agents worth pursuing this winter if you're Mike Elias?\"\n\nDF says -- \"I sure do. I have no idea what Max Fried (Atlanta) will want money/years wise, but I'd love to see him in Baltimore next season. We need a real lefty starter after the Trevor Rogers debacle. I'm not writing off Cade Povich just yet, but I don't see him being someone to make 32 starts in 2025.\n\nFried would be a nice addition in Baltimore and would help ease the pain of losing Burnes.\n\nThat said, he's not signing with the Orioles. He'll be in Boston or Chicago (Cubs) or Philadelphia, probably.\"\n\nfaith in sports\n\nWe don't post many 18 minute videos for you here, but this one day is WELL worth your nearly 20 minutes of time.\n\nC.J. Stroud is an extraordinary young man.\n\nThe Texans quarterback talks at length in the video below about his faith, his identity as a NFL player and how he has changed for the better since his days in the spotlight at Ohio State and now with the Houston Texans.\n\nIt's 18 minutes, but it's a GREAT 18 minutes. You'll be very impressed with Stroud, trust me.\n\nThanks, as always, to our friends at Freestate Electrical for their continued support of #DMD and our \"Faith in Sports\" segment here every Friday.\n\nThursday\n\nAugust 29, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3658\n\nslump or market correction?\n\nOK, so do you want the bad news? Or the bad news?\n\nThe O's lost to the Dodgers last night, 6-4. That's the bad news.\n\nHey, it happens. The O's are 77-57. You can't win 'em all.\n\nYou want the bad news? Corbin Burnes was pretty much lousy again.\n\nThe O's defense wasn't great behind him, but the Dodgers teed off regularly on the first year O's right hander. Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernandez both homered off of him, with the Hernandez shot landing somewhere near Anaheim.\n\nBurnes took umbrage with errors by both Urias and Henderson, but he was also the guy the Dodgers stole bases on left and right and it was his 58-foot pitch into the ground that allowed Ohtani to scoot from first to third in the 5th inning that eventually helped L.A. to increase their lead to 6-4.\n\nThere were some good moments, for sure. He threw a total of 94 pitches in six innings and 63 of them were strikes. But overall it was another concerning start for Burnes, who has suffered through five straight ineffective outings.\n\nEveryone struggles at some point. No athlete is immune to a period of time when things just don't click for whatever reason.\n\nHeck, the O's broadcast team even had themselves a blinder on Wednesday night, stumbling through several innings of bad broadcasting, including a dreadful in-game interview with super-boring Eloy Jimenez and an entire half-inning gushing over and discussing the Shohei Ohtani bobblehead that was distributed before the game in L.A.\n\nIf you thought Jimenez wasn't interested in running out ground balls, he's even less interested in putting on a headset and talking to broadcasters during the game itself. And it didn't help that his middle-school teammates were throwing sunflower seeds at him during that time as well. Anyway...\n\nBack to Burnes and baseball and the 6-4 loss.\n\nWould you rather lose to the Dodgers, 2-1, but Burnes throws a 7-inning gem, allowing 3 hits, 0 runs and striking out 8?\n\nOr win the game but have Burnes stink it up?\n\nIt's a fair question.\n\nHere's another fair question.\n\nIs Burnes simply in a slump?\n\nOr is this what he is?\n\nAre we seeing a pitcher who might be tipping his pitches somehow? Or struggling through a mechanical flaw he hasn't yet discovered?\n\nOr is this the market correction that comes with a pitcher who was so good earlier in the campaign that there was simply no way he could continue that level of quality for five more months?\n\nIt's definitely a \"decline\" of some kind.\n\nBurnes is simply not the pitcher he was eight or twelve weeks ago.\n\nBut why?\n\nI assume he's wondering that very thing himself.\n\nI'm guessing the Birds are, too. This is their ace. Their stopper. Burnes is the guy they brought to Baltimore to anchor a post-season pitching staff.\n\nRight now, he's an anchor alright. But not the kind the O's want.\n\nI'm no pitching guru. Far from it. That said, I'm of the mindset there's something going on with Burnes that we can't see with the naked eye.\n\nHe's either hurting, tipping his pitches or something has changed in his delivery that is contributing to his recent downfall.\n\nI don't buy the \"market correction\" angle. Burnes is a very good pitcher. Sure, a bad game or two along the way is part of every pitcher's campaign, but guys like Burnes don't have months like he's having in August.\n\nSomething else is going on.\n\nA couple of O's followers on Twitter have been leaning on the \"new father\" story. Burnes and his wife had twins recently, which definitely changes everyone's life at home. Fatherhood has a way of making you see things differently, but I doubt his recent struggles on the mound are connected to the twins.\n\nI'll stick with my theory; injured, tipping or mechanical flaw.\n\nIt needs to get turned around, whatever it is.\n\nSooner rather than later.\n\nHe'll get an automatic win next week against the White Sox in Baltimore, so hopefully that starts the turn around for Burnes.\n\nBut September is going to be a pivotal month for the Birds and it's unlikely they can win the division if we continue to see their number one starter scuffle like he has this month.\n\nOne other part of his recent downturn can be filed under the nature-of-unintended-consequences. The performance he's authored in August has probably been the last piece of information Mike Elias needed to make a decision on attempting to get in the mix to resign Burnes this off-season.\n\nSure, you never say never. If Burnes returns to form in September and is outrageously good in the post-season and the Birds fly into the World Series, you might at least have to consider joining the fray and throwing big bucks at him in free agency.\n\nBut that's not really the O's business model, as we all know. And his performance in August has made it easy for Elias to say \"no thanks\" at the thought of throwing $200M or $250M -- or more, perhaps -- at Burnes in December.\n\nBy the way, Burnes is far from the only Oriole who is going through a rough patch.\n\nBoth Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman are struggling.\n\nHenderson has looked \"off\" at the plate since mid-July and his defense has slipped big time in that span as well.\n\nRutschman still has time to shed the Matt Wieters 2.0 label that many baseball followers are sticking him with, but, if the shoe fits and all.\n\nIf Santander doesn't homer, he doesn't do much else. The good news is he homers a lot. The bad news is the O's need more out of him than they're getting.\n\nThose three have to start clicking on all cylinders again, preferably all at the same time.\n\nBut first, let's get Burnes fixed.\n\nWednesday\n\nAugust 28, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3657\n\nhey now!\n\nWhat a Tuesday that was!\n\nThe Orioles beat the Dodgers in last night's series opener in L.A., 3-2, getting home runs from Ryan O'Hearn and Ramon Urias and nearly flawless bullpen work to support a productive start from Cole Irvin.\n\nAnd, with all due respect to the likes of The Smiths, Simply Red and New Order, the best rock-n-roll band to ever hail from Manchester, England announced on Tuesday they are reconvening for a summer of '25 European tour.\n\nHeck, I'd go as far as saying they might be the best band to ever hail from England, period, except Led Zeppelin might not stand by me on that one.\n\nYes, that was a big Tuesday indeed.\n\nSome might say the O's played in Major League baseball's best stadium last night. I've been blessed to attend two games in Chavez Ravine. I realize you probably don't want me to reminisce about that right here in these parts, but I'm telling you it's one incredible place to watch a baseball game.\n\nMy big mouth might get me in hot water over this but I'll put it out there anyway: Dodger Stadium is the best place in America to watch a game. Yes, it's a better \"baseball experience\" than what we have in Baltimore. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nAnyway...\n\nThe O's offense, again last night, wasn't anything great. They managed just 7 hits on the evening in total -- matched by the Dodgers, who were mostly going nowhere as well -- but got the aforementioned dingers from O'Hearn and Urias, who has quietly been one of the team's unsung heroes during the five weeks they've spent without Jordan Westburg.\n\n\"I'm seeing the ball better than maybe anytime ever in the majors,\" Urias said afterwards. \"I have a lot of confidence, which is always good.\"\n\nSeeing the ball well.\n\nConfidence.\n\nWhatever it is, Urias is probably doing enough these days to secure his spot on the roster when Westburg returns later in September. There will be tough decisions to be made, for sure, but Urias will likely not be one of them.\n\nYou couldn't have blamed southpaw starter Cole Irvin for walking around looking like a guy who was asking, \"Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?\" He was, after all, cut from the team last month, but passed through waivers and was reassigned to Norfolk from there.\n\nAnd then, after the recent Trevor Rogers debacle, Irvin found himself once again collecting that nifty $108 a day of major league per-diem and there he was last night, starting one of the team's more important games of the last six weeks of the regular season. And it was, for the most part, a blessing of a start, as he helped keep the dream alive of a second straight A.L. East title with a solid 4.1 innings of work.\n\nI'm not here saying Irvin is a better man than Rogers. But as pitchers go, he seems to have a certain level of grit that Rogers doesn't. Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'll take the guy who fights over the guy with style. Irvin's a fighter. You might not get his best stuff every time out, but you're always going to get his best effort.\n\nThe rest of the bullpen were the real heroes last night.\n\nSomeone named Matt Bowman pitched 1.2 innings of shutout ball to pick up his first win of the season. His funky delivery and drop-off-the-table breaking ball were tough to hit last night. I'll take more of that magic pie tonight if he happens to get in the game.\n\nCionel Perez (1.1 innings), Yennier Cano (1) and Seranthony Dominguez (1) combined to allow just 2 hits and, little by little, the Dodgers' chances dimmed as the night went on. Dominguez did put runners on first and second in the 9th and Shohei Ohtani lurked in the on-deck circle when Chris Taylor approached the plate with 2 outs in the last frame.\n\nBut Taylor drilled a fly ball into deep left field right into the glove of Colton Cowser and the tension was gone. All part of the masterplan, I guess.\n\nSpeaking of Cowser, it wasn't all wine and roses for him on Tuesday evening, as he botched a ball hit into the corner and turned a double into a triple that helped the Dodgers put a run on the board on a sacrifice fly. Right on cue, of course, the official scorekeeper eschewed the reasonable wisdom of scoring it a double and an error and instead labeled it a triple. It's a crime that these scorekeepers across MLB won't give errors to professional players who make routine mistakes.\n\nMaybe it's just my generation. If so, I'll own it. But when a major leaguer misplays a ball he should and would normally come up with, it's an error. I guess the answer is either learn to accept that scorekeepers have turned soft over the years or, simply, stay young.\n\nSo the O's snagged game one of the three-game series last night and the Yankees fell in D.C. to the Nationals. The Birds are going to need to keep on winning, apparently, because it seems like the Bronx Bombers aren't going to be falling down anytime soon. And there is that September series in New York to circle on your calendar as well, don't forget.\n\nOh, and Corbin Burnes goes for the Orioles tonight.\n\nI know he hasn't been good for the last three weeks or so, but you'll get no sad song out of me on this one. If you want anyone on the mound in a big game situation for the O's these days, it's still Burnes.\n\nNow, if we can just get those Baltimore bats to perk up, right?\n\nI hope, I think, I know, even, that if the O's can get going offensively again, September and October could be really fun here in The Land of Pleasant Living.\n\nTuesday\n\nAugust 27, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3656\n\nplayoffs? playoffs?\n\nIf you're like me, any time you read the word \"playoffs\", don't you always say it in your head in Jim Mora's voice?\n\nI know I do.\n\n#DMD reader Gary reached out to me yesterday with an e-mail about Orioles playoff tickets. In case you haven't heard, information has been released about the 2024 post-season and how playoff tickets can be obtained in Baltimore.\n\nGary called it \"confusing\" in his e-mail.\n\nI wouldn't call it confusing at all. I'd call it elaborate, sure, but far from confusing.\n\nHere's the quick, easy summary: If you're not a 2024 Birdland member (code word for: season ticket or mini-plan owner), you simply have to sign up to be a 2025 Birdland member and place a deposit on your '25 seats. If you fit into one of those two categories (2024 or 2025), you'll have access to Orioles post-season tickets before anyone else.\n\n\"The prices are outrageous!\" Gary wrote.\n\nOf course they're outrageous. It's the playoffs. Major League Baseball is looking to make as much money as they can on the post-season, no matter the city.\n\nThere are lots of things to get agitated about with regard to the Orioles.\n\nPlayoff ticket availability/distribution and pricing, though, are not two of those things.\n\nNow, the process has probably changed a bit last September when I was easily able to score individual game tickets for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 6 and 7 of the ALCS. I was able to go online, sit in the \"room\" for 10 minutes, and then get seats to all three of those games. Alas, they never happened. But I was able to secure the seats without being a plan holder of any kind.\n\nI assume the Birds and Major League Baseball have come up with a mechanism to reduce the number of available \"public\" tickets this year, but who knows?\n\nBut I'll take my chances once all the ticket-plan folks have had their opportunity to cough up big bucks to \"secure the privilege\" of buying tickets to O's post-season 2024.\n\nThere was a time, honestly, when one of the only reasons I even entertained the thought of buying a 13-game or 29-game plan mini plan was because I knew it guaranteed me post-season access. I had a mini-plan for five straight years starting in 2013 and it was almost all about playoff tickets.\n\nBut even that benefit has gone by the way of the 8-track. You have to be a \"Diamond\" level plan holder to get tickets to all 14 possible home games and a \"Black\" level member to get 8 of the 14 games.\n\nThat's why I called the whole thing \"elaborate\" instead of \"confusing\".\n\nThere are lots of moving parts to securing your playoff tickets, but it isn't all that hard to understand. If you're a mini-plan holder, you'll get \"some\" of the games. If you're a full plan holder, you'll get either \"most\" or \"all\" of the games.\n\n\"But what about the great unwashed?\" Is that what you're wondering?\n\nLook, you have to understand how priority works. You don't have to like it. But you do have to understand it.\n\nPeople who fork over their money in January deserve more benefits than someone (like me, and maybe you) who doesn't fork over any money. It's just the way it works.\n\nBut I'm still here to tell you not worry. There will be tickets to be had in mid-September once all the ticket plan holders have paid for their playoff seats.\n\nAt least that's what I think and hope.\n\nNews flash: An O's associate tells me they expect roughly 80% of the ticket holders to renew for the playoffs. Lots of people apparently can't obligate themselves to games at the increased prices with the \"pay up front, all at once\" payment scheme the Orioles and Major League Baseball utilize for the post-season.\n\nIn other words, as I've said, there will be tickets available to \"normal people\" who just want to go see a game or two in October.\n\nThere might not be a lot of them available, mind you, but you'll be able to score a couple of tickets.\n\nOf course, the Birds still have to make the playoffs for all of this to matter.\n\nI get a little antsy even authoring a column like this given the team's level of play over the last two months. I mean, I think they're going to make the post-season, but they still need to win 17 more games, at least, to make it.\n\nIn mid-June when the Birds were healthy and clobbering teams left and right, the post-season looked like a done deal. 12 injuries and a mostly ineffective trade deadline later, it's now a dogfight to reach October.\n\nThat said, if they make it and you want to see a game or two in Baltimore, I have a feeling you're going to be able to do that.\n\nAs long as you can afford it, that is.\n\nThe tickets aren't for the meek of heart, price wise.\n\nBut it's the post-season. And as we know, there's zero guarantee you're going to get there again next October. So, enjoy it while you can.\n\nTake out a loan and...Go O's!\n\nThe Scottie Scheffler Invitational Tournament disguised as the TOUR Championship has hit a snag. Golf showed up and decided not to let Scheffler run away with it, in other words.\n\nBecause of his dominant regular season play, Scheffler starts this week's final playoff event in first place in the staggered scoring format they use to determine the season-long champion. He'll begin Thursday's first round at 10-under par. Some of the players near the back of the pack will start at even par.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Scheffler bristled at the idea that he could actually wind up not being the 2024 \"champion\" despite winning more events (6) than anyone else and easily outdistancing his fellow TOUR brethren in the points race.\n\nIn one way, he's right. Scheffler had the best PGA Tour season of anyone. It wasn't even close. But, just like every other sport rewards their playoff champion, the PGA Tour has developed a creative way to stage their post-season so it's not a foregone conclusion of who will ultimately win their season long championship.\n\nIn another way, the TOUR is doing the right thing by keeping all 30 players in the final tournament still mathematically alive for the championship.\n\nThere was a time when the TOUR went by points and points alone and, for instance, Justin Rose won the FedEx Cup without having to win the final event, instead finishing T4 to claim the title.\n\nThat wasn't the best way to do it, the TOUR figured. So they came up with the staggered scoring format where the points leader starts out ahead of everyone else, the 2nd place guy begins the final event two shots behind, and so forth.\n\nThe guess here is that at some point soon, the TOUR is going once again tweak the scoring system somehow to reward a guy like Scheffler who builds such a commanding lead. Now, Xander Schauffle (2nd place currently), has enjoyed a remarkable year himself, but both of his wins were majors. Nothing against that, obviously, but his regular season wasn't anywhere close to as strong as Scheffler's 2024 campaign.\n\nNo one asked me, but here's what I would do if they gave me the keys to the FedEx Cup.\n\nI'll start by saying that American professional golf could use more match play events. As we've seen with the Ryder Cup over the last 25 years, the European side has our number when it comes to match play.\n\nSo, if they gave me the task of fixing the TOUR Championship and the FedEx Cup, I'd integrate a match play competition into the final week of golf.\n\nThe top 30 players -- just like now -- would qualify for the final event and would receive all the bells and whistles they're getting now (2-year exemption, invites to the majors, a million bucks, etc.).\n\nThe players ranked 3 to 30 would play a 36 hole stroke play qualifier, with the best 14 scores from there advancing to a match play format to determine the FedEx Cup champion.\n\nTo keep the integrity of the regular season intact and force players to covet the top 2 spots in the standings, I'd give the #1 and #2 ranked players (as of the final playoff event) a bye into the match play. There's their bonus for playing well.\n\nFrom there, the bracket is set and off we go. #16 plays #1, #15 plays #2, and so on.\n\nWinners move on, losers go home.\n\nIt's true that Scheffler's season could end with one \"off\" round, where he loses in match play, but the same can be said for this week's TOUR Championship at East Lake. If he shoots 76 on day one and Schauffele, for example, shoots 68, Scottie's quest for the title is probably cooked.\n\nBut the other good thing about match play is actually the opposite. Scheffler could have an \"off\" day and still win, keeping his season alive.\n\nI'm not as critical of the current format as are some golf analysts. I think the staggered scoring system is a solid and unique way to reward the leader from the regular season. If I could tweak it just a little, I might give Scheffler an even bigger lead to start round one based on how far ahead he is in the points race.\n\nA two shot lead is nothing.\n\nHe probably deserves a four shot lead over Schauffele, if we're trying to showcase just how good his regular season was.\n\nMatch play is a riveting form of championship golf. The PGA Tour had a match play championship for two decades until discontinuing it recently due to the loss of the title sponsor of the event.\n\nBringing it back to cap off their season long points race would be a great way to end things.\n\nMonday\n\nAugust 26, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3655\n\ntwo lousy, stinkin' hits\n\nOK, so if last night's game where the O's mustered just two hits was a \"Gary Wright\", what are we going to call it this week when the Birds only manage one hit in a 4-0 loss to the Dodgers in Los Angeles?\n\nAnd no, smart guy, we can't call that a \"Beatles\". You're funny.\n\nAnyway, two hits it was last night in the 6-3 loss to Houston, and they actually both came in the same inning (5th) when Eloy Jimenez (single) and Ramon Urias (home run) became the only Orioles to put up a (1) in the \"H\" column.\n\nEditor's note: For the uninitiated, or those of you reading this who were born after 1980, let's say, Gary Wright had two huge hits in his career; Dream Weaver and Love Is Alive. They were both awesome songs. But that was about all we heard from the New Jersey native.\n\nSo, the Birds fell once again in front of a national TV audience on Sunday night, with the Astros earning a split of the four-game series in Charm City.\n\nIf we're being honest about those four games, the Orioles were very lucky to win any of them, let alone two. They got a grand slam from Anthony Santander on Friday night after a weird set of circumstances loaded the bases and then Jackson Holliday rescued the hosts with a pinch-hit bases clearing double on Saturday in the 3-2 victory.\n\nSure, a win's a win and all. They count, no matter how you post 'em. But the O's were *this close* to losing all four games to Houston.\n\nThe Astros are not chopped liver, by the way. If you gave me $100 of your money to wager, I'd plunk it down on them to go to the World Series, particularly if Kyle Tucker returns to the lineup and is healthy for the post-season.\n\nSpeaking of health and the post-season, it's certainly worth keeping in mind that the Birds are -- fingers crossed here -- going to be getting four fairly important pieces back before the end of September: Zach Eflin (perhaps as early as next weekend?), Danny Coulombe (mid-September?), Grayson Rodriguez (mid-September?) and Jordan Westburg (late September?).\n\nGetting those four back on the roster will be huge.\n\nI realize there's three weeks of baseball -- or more, perhaps -- before those four all return to action. And those games over the next 21 days will play a huge role in where the Birds finish up, playoff wise.\n\nBut at this point, the only real goal for the team is to make it to October. That's it. Winning the division would be nice, sure. The playoffs, though, are priority number one. Get in and take it from there.\n\nSomething has to give with the offense, though, no matter how many of those four get back or when they return.\n\nRutschman has one home run in his last 29 games.\n\nHenderson perked up last week with a couple of home runs but he's definitely been \"off\" since the All Star break.\n\nHolliday had the big hit on Saturday night and was really good when he got promoted from the minors earlier this month, but he's still trying to figure things out at the plate.\n\nAnd let's be really honest about Anthony Santander. He's having a great year in the home run department. But that's about it. He's hitting .235 and his on-base-percentage is .305. Aaron Judge he ain't.\n\nThe reality is no one in Baltimore is tearing it up offensively, with perhaps the exception of Henderson (.282/.369/.545, 33 HR), who was a legitimate league MVP candidate through the first three months of the regular season.\n\nThere's some power in the lineup, that's for sure.\n\nBut with runners in scoring position, the Orioles are as useless as a Flyers fan making room on top of his fireplace for a replica Stanley Cup trophy.\n\nBaltimore's offense is.....mostly......offensive.\n\nAnd the defense hasn't been all-world recently, either. Austin Slater took a weird route to a ball in the 4th inning last night that sailed over his head and helped Houston jump out to a 3-0 lead. A lot of folks on Twitter barked something akin to: Austin Hays would have caught that. And it was hard to disagree with that claim.\n\nRamon Urias threw a ball away in the 8th inning that contributed to the Astros' 6th and final run of the night.\n\n\"Stuff happens\", I get it, but both of those blunders were key moments in a game the Birds didn't really deserve to win, but nonetheless could have won with more tidy defensive work and better efficiency with the bats.\n\nYou might have noticed something. I haven't brought up the bullpen.\n\nWhy haven't I?\n\nI want you to enjoy your morning coffee, that's why.\n\nThe bullpen is just not that good.\n\nNow, no one's perfect. I get that. But we had the Seranthony Dominguez flops in New York last week and then last night, again, the Birds wasted a nice outing from Dean Kremer when Burch Smith gave up two quick home runs in the 7th inning.\n\nCionel Perez came on in the 8th and was betrayed by his own wildness and the aforementioned Urias error, as he surrendered Houston's final run of the night.\n\nPerez is great at catching home runs with his hat. If he were a tick better at getting people out, the O's might have something special there.\n\nHey, they do have Craig Kimbrel. Let's not forget that.\n\nOK, well maybe now you're no longer enjoying your coffee all that much after I mentioned the embattled veteran reliever. My bad.\n\nOh, and speaking of pitchers, Trevor Rogers made his first start down in Norfolk yesterday. I won't publish the results here. Just trust me on this: It was really ugly.\n\nThe Birds now head off to Los Angeles (Irvin, Burnes, Povich) and Colorado for six games before returning home for three automatic wins vs. the White Sox and a weekend series in Baltimore vs. depleted Tampa Bay. Yes, I'm being overly optimistic here, but I'm thinking there's a chance the O's can go 8-4 in those 12 games.\n\nKey words in that last sentence above: Overly optimistic.\n\nSo, you're looking for some good news?\n\nHere it is: The Red Sox lost three straight at home to Arizona and they're now officially starting to wobble at 69-62. By the time Brandon Hyde's team gets to Fenway for a series on September 9-10-11, I assume Boston will be mailing it in.\n\nYou want more good news?\n\nAs the Birds embark on this 6-game road trip out west, it's fair to point out they're better away from home (37-26) than at home (39-30). So they have going for them...which is nice.\n\nBut no matter where or who they play, one thing is for certain. The Orioles need to start hitting. Their offense looks like Cam Cameron is calling the shots. It's very concerning.\n\nThe Ravens are closing in on the start of the 2024 regular season, with a Thursday night season opening encounter with Kansas City all set for Thursday, September 5.\n\nWe'll start getting amped up for football season early next week, with our annual predictions issue almost assuredly giving you an excellent idea of which teams to fade during the upcoming campaign.\n\nQuick hint: We have a shocker playing in the Super Bowl.\n\nThat's all I'm telling you for now.\n\nAs for the Ravens, the pre-season definitely gave some insight into potential problem areas for the club. The offensive line is potentially a trouble spot. So, too, is the wide receiver position. I realize the Ravens have talented tight ends who can catch the football, but in terms of actual field-stretching wide outs who can come up with big plays, the Ravens are fairly limited.\n\nI sure hope Derrick Henry is still a capable running back. If he is, the Ravens should be fine in that department. But if Henry is somehow in the December of his career, running the football could be a problem for Todd Monken's offense.\n\nI won't render a verdict on pass rushers like Ojabo and Oweh until we see a medium-size body of work from them in the regular season. If we're six or eight games in and they're getting to the quarterback and disrupting opposing offenses, I'll rest a little more easy. I don't put any stock in the pre-season, as most of you don't, I assume.\n\nThis might be one of those seasons where the Ravens mosey through a regular season at 11-6 or 10-7, get in the playoffs with a week to spare, then pull a Counting Crows and catch lightning in a bottle in January. We saw firsthand last season that securing home ice for the playoffs is nice and all, but it doesn't guarantee you anything except home games and (potential) heartache.\n\nIf the Ravens go 10-7 in the regular season but win the Super Bowl, who cares about those 7 losses? Exactly no one.\n\n\"Randy On The O's\"\n\nRandy Morgan takes #DMD readers through the recent week in Orioles baseball as the Birds try to win a second straight A.L.
