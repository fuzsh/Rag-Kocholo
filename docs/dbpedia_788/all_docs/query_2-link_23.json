        "text": "Tim Collins@ @TimDCollinsFeatured Columnist\n\nRanking the Top 50 Bowlers in ODI Cricket by Strike Rate\n\n0 of 50\n\nHamish Blair/Getty Images\n\nOne-day international cricket has always been about pace. With both the bat and the ball, the rate at which one performs their work is often more important than the total sum.\n\nThus, a player's strike rate with the white ball stands as the best indicator of their potency in the 50-over game.\n\nSo which international bowlers have collected their wickets most rapidly? Who has thrived in the time constraints of the one-day game?\n\nAcross the following slides, we count down the top 50 ODI bowlers by strike rate with at least 50 career wickets.\n\n50. Carl Rackemann\n\n1 of 50\n\nGetty Images/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 52\n\nWickets: 82\n\nStrike Rate: 34.0\n\nA player associated with one-day international cricket of a very different era, Carl Rackemann proved to be a very effective 50-over bowler for Australia despite a very limited Test career.\n\nStarting in a blaze of glory with 34 wickets in his first 17 matches in 1983-84, the right-armer quickly entrenched himself in an attack that also contained Geoff Lawson, Jeff Thomson and Terry Alderman.\n\nStrongly built with surprising pace, Rackemann's strike rate of only 34.0 is remarkable, given the vastly more sedate pace of one-day cricket three decades ago.\n\n49. Kyle Mills\n\n2 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: New Zealand\n\nMatches: 165\n\nWickets: 235\n\nStrike Rate: 33.9\n\nOn first glance, there's very little that grabs the eye when watching New Zealand's Kyle Mills.\n\nIndeed, with a controlled approach and possessing only moderate speed, the right-armer has always seemed something more of a first-class journeyman than an elite international performer.\n\nPerhaps that initial impression has contributed to his success, allowing him to claim his wickets with a subtlety not found in many of his contemporaries.\n\nThat he's only one of four New Zealanders on this list underlines how effective Mills has been for his nation.\n\n48. Patrick Patterson\n\n3 of 50\n\nAdrian Murrell/Getty Images\n\nCountry: West Indies\n\nMatches: 59\n\nWickets: 90\n\nStrike Rate: 33.8\n\nRhythm and grace weren't strong points for Patrick Patterson. But unbridled aggression and raw pace were.\n\nWhen he burst onto the scene for the West Indies in 1986 to join the likes of Joel Garner, Courtney Walsh and Malcolm Marshall, Patterson was as ferocious as any.\n\nWith brute strength, the right-armer could intimidate anyone, instantly becoming a force in the great West Indian attack.\n\nBut Patterson's action fell apart at the same time Curtly Ambrose rose to prominence, cutting his career short.\n\n47. Irfan Pathan\n\n4 of 50\n\nQuinn Rooney/Getty Images\n\nCountry: India\n\nMatches: 120\n\nWickets: 173\n\nStrike Rate: 33.8\n\nLike many other fast-bowling talents to emerge from India, Irfan Pathan was once hyped as the most promising Indian seamer in years when be broke through in Australia in 2003-04.\n\nPossessing sharp pace and an ability to conjure extremely late swing, the left-armer quickly made an impression against the great Australian side of a decade ago.\n\nWickets quickly came, followed by runs as well, leaving many to conclude that Pathan could become a truly brilliant all-rounder for his nation.\n\nBut Pathan's career stuttered after his initial success, seeing him in and out of the side after his bowling fell away in 2006.\n\nStill only 29, the left-armer hasn't represented India in any format for two years.\n\n46. Thilan Thushara\n\n5 of 50\n\nGurinder Osan/Associated Press\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 38\n\nWickets: 50\n\nStrike Rate: 33.5\n\nThilan Thushara's brief success in one-day cricket stemmed from his quick arm action that came as something of a surprise after a measured run up.\n\nIt's a formula that has proved effective for many in the limited-overs formats, given the inherent unpredictability in such bowlers in an arena that doesn't afford batsmen time to adjust.\n\nBut after enjoying a strong start to his international career—the highlight being a haul of 5/47 against India in 2008—the left-armer became expensive for Sri Lanka, which saw him dropped just two years later in 2010.\n\n45. Jerome Taylor\n\n6 of 50\n\nTom Shaw/Getty Images\n\nCountry: West Indies\n\nMatches: 66\n\nWickets: 98\n\nStrike Rate: 33.4\n\nPlucked from relative obscurity in 2003 to represent the West Indies, Jerome Taylor looked set to be yet another fast-bowling prodigy to emerge from the Caribbean.\n\nWhile shorter than predecessors such as Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose, Taylor's brisk pace and skiddy action made him a potent limited-overs operator, particularly when combined with his surprising bounce.\n\nBut injuries have severely hampered the right-armer's career, seeing him forced away from the international stage for more than four years.\n\nPleasingly, Taylor has returned to the West Indian Test side in 2014, performing strongly against New Zealand and Bangladesh.\n\n44. Umar Gul\n\n7 of 50\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 124\n\nWickets: 173\n\nStrike Rate: 33.4\n\nSteady, accurate and in complete command of the moving ball, Umar Gul has been one of those to excel with substance rather than style.\n\nWhat the right-armer has lacked in blistering pace he has compensated for with guile—he's the sort of bowler who works a batsman out rather than blasting him away.\n\nLike many others, however, injuries have worn down the Pakistani, the first of which was a series of stress fractures in his back at the beginning of his career, while this year a knee problem has kept Gul sidelined since April.\n\n43. Farveez Maharoof\n\n8 of 50\n\nRobert Prezioso/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 104\n\nWickets: 133\n\nStrike Rate: 33.3\n\nFew bowlers in the game's history have ever owned such an enormous imbalance between their Test and one-day international records.\n\nWith the red ball, Farveez Maharoof averaged 65.24. With the white ball, that number plummeted to 26.80.\n\nIn seam-friendly conditions, the Sri Lankan all-rounder was a handful with his tall action, but couldn't prove incisive when there was little assistance to be found in the wicket.\n\nThus, the greater movement often seen with the white ball better suited Maharoof, who had a knack for picking up wickets in bunches when presented with favourable conditions.\n\n42. Andrew Flintoff\n\n9 of 50\n\nJulian Herbert/Getty Images\n\nCountry: England\n\nMatches: 141\n\nWickets: 169\n\nStrike Rate: 33.2\n\nLike many Englishmen, Andrew Flintoff never played as much one-day international cricket as he should have, given that he was the prototypical bowling all-rounder in world cricket a decade ago.\n\nStrong, quick, aggressive and capable of prodigious reverse swing, England's showman was a truly lethal fast bowler at his peak—a period that was made unfortunately short by injury.\n\nOf course, Flintoff will always be remembered for his exploits in the Test arena—most notably the 2005 Ashes series—but his one-day record will the ball is still something to be admired—particularly when you consider that he finished with an average of just 24.38.\n\n41. Michael Kasprowicz\n\n10 of 50\n\nHamish Blair/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 43\n\nWickets: 67\n\nStrike Rate: 33.2\n\nMichael Kasprowicz is one of many fine Australian cricketers who would have enjoyed a lengthy international career if not for being born among the finest generation of players in the nation's history.\n\nA superb right-armer, the Queenslander was always forced to compete for the third-seamer place in Australia's lineup behind Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie.\n\nRelentless in his work ethic and brilliant with his subtle variations, Kasprowicz was an extremely reliable option for Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting, but saw injuries and the rise Brett Lee bring an end to his international career.\n\n40. Nathan Bracken\n\n11 of 50\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 116\n\nWickets: 174\n\nStrike Rate: 33.0\n\nNathan Bracken was not your typical Australian seamer. In fact, the left-armer's style was more subcontinental than it was Australian.\n\nPossessing an armoury of cutters, slower balls, dipping yorkers and conventional out swingers, Bracken became an integral component of his nation's one-day international side, providing his captains with a wildly contrasting alternative to the likes of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nOf course, such an approach proved ineffective in the Test arena on the flat Australian wickets, but Bracken was superb at disturbing a batsman's rhythm amid the time constraints of the 50-over arena.\n\n39. S Sreesanth\n\n12 of 50\n\nHamish Blair/Getty Images\n\nCountry: India\n\nMatches: 53\n\nWickets: 75\n\nStrike Rate: 33.0\n\nForgotten amid the spot-fixing controversy of 2013 that has not only tarnished his international reputation, but also banned him from the game for life, is that Sreesanth was once a potent limited-overs seamer for India.\n\nAggressive and antagonistic like few others in world cricket, the right-armer had a knack for producing regular wicket-taking deliveries in the middle of otherwise loose spells.\n\nIndeed, while Sreesanth was expensive with the ball in the 50-over format, his capture of 75 wickets in 53 games is indicative of the threat he concurrently posed—epitomised by his haul of 6/55 against England in 2006.\n\n38. Ishant Sharma\n\n13 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: India\n\nMatches: 72\n\nWickets: 102\n\nStrike Rate: 32.9\n\nIt's quite possible that no player has ever been the subject of more ridicule than India's Ishant Sharma.\n\nLike countless others on this list, Ishant made a stunning beginning to his international career, arriving with a sumptuous combination of sharp pace, surprising lift and late swing that instantly saw him shoulder a heavy burden of expectation.\n\nBut the long-haired right-armer has never touched the levels expected of him since, seeing him become a maligned figure in India and across the world.\n\nIn spite of that, Ishant has only gone wicketless in 15 of his 72 one-day internationals, capturing his victims at less than 33 balls apiece.\n\n37. Ajit Agarkar\n\n14 of 50\n\nLaurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nCountry: India\n\nMatches: 191\n\nWickets: 288\n\nStrike Rate: 32.9\n\nAccording to ESPN Cricinfo, Ajit Agarkar was the fastest man ever to reach 50 one-day international wickets when he claimed his 50th scalp against Zimbabwe in 1998 during his 23rd appearance.\n\nWhile that record has since been broken, the Indian enjoyed a fine 50-over career for his nation, using his unerring control of swing to trouble the world's best batsmen.\n\nSome may argue that Agarkar never fulfilled his potential as a genuine all-rounder, both those who watched his destructive spells against England in Chennai in 2002 or against Australia in Melbourne in 2004 will remember the seamer as one of the world's finest exponents of conventional swing bowling in the modern era.\n\n36. Wahab Riaz\n\n15 of 50\n\nChristopher Lee/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 42\n\nWickets: 56\n\nStrike Rate: 32.9\n\nWahab Riaz recently earned a recall to the Pakistan one-day international side after a one-year spell on the sidelines brought about by difficult series against the West Indies and South Africa in 2013.\n\nAnother bowler to owe his fine 50-over strike rate to his sharp pace, the left-armer has touched the 150 kph mark during his career, attempting to follow the great Pakistani quicks such as Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar who have preceded him.\n\nOf course, his most notable performance came in the 2011 World Cup semi-final against India when he claimed figures of 5/46, but a lack of consistency and an expensive economy rate have hampered Wahab's effectiveness.\n\n35. Kemar Roach\n\n16 of 50\n\nRichard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nCountry: West Indies\n\nMatches: 64\n\nWickets: 98\n\nStrike Rate: 32.8\n\nYet another seamer with genuine pace—there's a recurring theme here, isn't there?\n\nSimilar to a number of others with impressive strike rates, West Indies' Kemar Roach has enjoyed a superb limited-overs career with his higher-than-average speed.\n\nWhile considerably shorter than many fast men, Roach's ability to touch 150 kph from his moderate height has made the 26-year-old an uncomfortable proposition for batsmen, hurrying opponents with deliveries that rapidly skid on.\n\nAnd while it has been his Test performances that have stood out in recent months against New Zealand and Bangladesh, his destruction of Pakistan in last summer's Champions Trophy is an example of the threat he possesses with the white ball.\n\n34. Wayne Parnell\n\n17 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 40\n\nWickets: 56\n\nStrike Rate: 32.6\n\nWithin his first eight one-day internationals, South Africa's Wayne Parnell claimed two hauls of five wickets and another haul of four.\n\nRarely has a bowler been so successful, so quickly.\n\nPleasingly, the left-armer has managed to maintain his impressive form in coloured clothing, entrenching himself as his nation's third seamer behind Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel.\n\nThe latest in a long line of South Africa speedsters, Parnell will look to build on his impressive performance in the Zimbabwe Triangular Series final against Australia as next year's World Cup approaches.\n\n33. Makhaya Ntini\n\n18 of 50\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 173\n\nWickets: 266\n\nStrike Rate: 32.6\n\nMakhaya Ntini is an extremely important figure in international cricket.\n\nThough he may be the owner of 662 wickets in all formats, the fast bowler's importance goes well beyond that, as Ntini was the first black African to represent the Rainbow Nation when he made his debut in 1998.\n\nNot blessed with the characteristic attributes of most successful seamers, the right-armer forged an excellent career through his unrelenting work ethic, claiming 266 wickets in the 50-over game with an energy and exuberance that has rarely been matched.\n\nUnquestionably his most memorable performance came against Australia in Cape Town in 2006, when Ntini ripped through the visitors with 6/22 to see Australia bundled out for just 93.\n\n32. Dwayne Bravo\n\n19 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: West Indies\n\nMatches: 161\n\nWickets: 196\n\nStrike Rate: 32.6\n\nPerhaps more than any, Dwayne Bravo is a prototypical modern West Indian cricketer.\n\nBlessed with power, a sharp eye and brilliant skill in both of the game's major disciplines, the 30-year-old has enjoyed a fine limited-overs career for the West Indies since making his debut in 2004.\n\nWith the ball in hand, Bravo has utilised changes in pace and underestimated swing to unsettle batsmen, simultaneously inspiring his teammates with a bubbling confidence that refuses to be suppressed.\n\nAnd when Bravo fires with the ball, the West Indies rarely falter, made evident in games against India in 2007, Sri Lanka in 2008 and England in 2009.\n\n31. Stuart Broad\n\n20 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: England\n\nMatches: 108\n\nWickets: 168\n\nStrike Rate: 32.5\n\nIt's no surprise to see England's Stuart Broad on this list, given how potent the 28-year-old can be when he gets in the mood.\n\nIndeed, on his day, there are few more lethal fast bowlers in the world than Broad, who seems to gather momentum more rapidly than any of his contemporaries.\n\nOf course, knee troubles have bothered the Englishman recently, reducing his involvement to the Test arena. But if you examine his sublime stretch in the one-day international game in 2009-10, it's easy to see why Broad features in these rankings.\n\n30. James Tredwell\n\n21 of 50\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nCountry: England\n\nMatches: 39\n\nWickets: 55\n\nStrike Rate: 32.4\n\nBeing a spinner in England has typically been hard work. That James Tredwell is the first spinner on this list tells its own story.\n\nVastly unspectacular but extremely effective, the off-spinner has become a critical member of England's one-day international side in the last two years, bringing experience and nous to an outfit that has tended to lack both in the 50-over game.\n\nOf course, the 32-year-old is hardly the deceptive magician that many subcontinental spinners are, but his miserly economy rate has ensured that wickets tend tumble when he bowls, given the pressure he exerts on opposing batsmen.\n\n29. Mitchell Johnson\n\n22 of 50\n\nWill Russell/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 140\n\nWickets: 212\n\nStrike Rate: 32.3\n\nIt feels as though Mitchell Johnson's career is currently divided into three very distinct parts: An initial burst, a subsequent decline and a breathtaking renaissance.\n\nInterestingly, however, that perception is limited to his existence in the Test arena. In coloured clothing, Johnson has been a force since he entered the game in late 2005.\n\nThe owner of extreme pace, late swing and dangerous unpredictability, the left-armer has thrived in the 50-over format, blasting opposing lineups away to be among his nation's finest ever speedsters.\n\n28. Tawanda Mupariwa\n\n23 of 50\n\nCHRIS BRANDIS/Associated Press\n\nCountry: Zimbabwe\n\nMatches: 35\n\nWickets: 55\n\nStrike Rate: 32.2\n\nThe immediate conclusion one comes to when examining a Zimbabwean's record is that it has been compiled against sub-standard opposition.\n\nFor Tawanda Mupariwa, however, that's not the case.\n\nOf his 35 one-day internationals, 24 were against sides among the world's top eight, recording an average of 27.59 in those matches—only fractionally higher than his career mark of 26.29.\n\nWhile he never broke through in the Test arena, Mupariwa was extremely well suited to the limited-overs formats, utilising his variations and accuracy to great effect.\n\n27. Chris Pringle\n\n24 of 50\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nCountry: New Zealand\n\nMatches: 64\n\nWickets: 103\n\nStrike Rate: 32.1\n\nNew Zealand has produced a succession of effective medium-pacers, with Chris Pringle being one of those in the early 1990s.\n\nLacking the genuine speed and hostility associated with many others on this list, Pringle thrived in the 50-over game with his control and accuracy at a time when the format was still separating itself from Test cricket.\n\nAmong his finest performances was his haul of 4/40 against Australia in Sydney in 1994 that secured a 13-run victory for New Zealand, even after the visitors had set the home side a very modest target of 199.\n\n26. Saeed Ajmal\n\n25 of 50\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 111\n\nWickets: 183\n\nStrike Rate: 32.1\n\nSince his entry into international cricket in 2008, few bowlers have been as prolific as Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal.\n\nA modern finger spinner with an array of deceptive variations, Ajmal has rapidly ascended into the upper echelon of limited-overs spin bowling alongside Sunil Narine and Ajantha Mendis.\n\nSpells of 5/24 against India and 5/43 have undoubtedly been his finest, but the late bloomer has found himself suspended until further testing after the ICC deemed his action to be illegal earlier this month.\n\n25. Vasbert Drakes\n\n26 of 50\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nCountry: West Indies\n\nMatches: 34\n\nWickets: 51\n\nStrike Rate: 32.1\n\nWhen he debuted against Australia in 1995, Vasbert Drakes took his place in the West Indies' attack alongside established greats such as Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose.\n\nImmediately, it was expected that the right-armer would blossom to become the team's next fast-bowling star, but his decision to play domestic cricket year-round in England and South Africa wiped him from the West Indies' radar for seven years between 1995 and 2002, per ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nAfter a seven-year absence, Drakes enjoyed success upon his return to this side, destroying Bangladesh before embarking on a successful World Cup campaign in South Africa in 2003.\n\n24. Dale Steyn\n\n27 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 87\n\nWickets: 135\n\nStrike Rate: 31.8\n\nEasily one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, it comes as no surprise that Dale Steyn features high up on this list.\n\nPerhaps the finest exponent of the fast out-swinger in the modern era, the South African has flattened batting lineups around the world since his international debut in 2004, causing havoc with his unique cocktail of intimidation and precision.\n\nAlready compared among the game's true greats, Steyn will undoubtedly find himself a place in cricket's pantheon by the end of his career.\n\n23. Lonwabo Tsotsobe\n\n28 of 50\n\nRichard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 61\n\nWickets: 94\n\nStrike Rate: 31.5\n\nLonwabo Tsotsobe has been sidelined with injury since this year's ICC World Twenty20, allowing Wayne Parnell to establish himself in South Africa's limited-overs lineups.\n\nPrior to his injury difficulties, however, the left-armer was among the world's most potent bowlers in the 50-over format, rising to the No. 1 ranking among bowlers in one-day international cricket in early 2012.\n\nExtremely accurate and unrelenting in his consistency, the left-armer has overcome his lack of pace to entrench himself as one of the world's finest performers with the ball in coloured clothing.\n\n22. Naved-Ul-Hasan\n\n29 of 50\n\nPaul Kane/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 74\n\nWickets: 110\n\nStrike Rate: 31.5\n\nOnce a very threatening fast bowler for Pakistan in 50-over cricket, Naved-ul-Hasan's career fell away in 2006-07 amid injury concerns and an alarming loss of form.\n\nAfter rising to prominence possessing good pace and a supreme control over late swing, the right-armer enjoyed a sparkling period with the ball in 2005, capturing 45 wickets at 21.53 for the calendar year.\n\nBut a disastrous tour of South Africa and an equally disappointing World Cup campaign in 2007 saw the Pakistani lose his place in his nation's side, failing to recapture his previous excellence thereafter.\n\n21. Allan Donald\n\n30 of 50\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 164\n\nWickets: 272\n\nStrike Rate: 31.4\n\nAt his peak, Allan Donald was undoubtedly the most feared fast bowler on the planet, emerging during the decline of the great West Indian attacks to be the world's most lethal speedster.\n\nWith a classical action that was the envy of seamers everywhere, the South African tore through opposing lineups with frightening pace and almost unrivalled accuracy.\n\nLike so many other fast men, injuries halted Donald's blistering capture of wickets, eventually forcing him to retire in 2003.\n\n20. Shoaib Akhtar\n\n31 of 50\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 163\n\nWickets: 247\n\nStrike Rate: 31.4\n\nThere have been a plethora of fast-bowling prodigies to emerge from Pakistan, but none have been quite as captivating to watch as Shoaib Akhtar.\n\nBlessed with insane speed, the Pakistani was a truly breathtaking sight at his best, terrorising the world's finest batsmen while touching 160 kph.\n\nBut Shoaib is one of cricket's great unfulfilled talents; his career was dogged by moments of controversy, form slumps and countless indiscretions, curtailing what could have been one of the game's finest careers.\n\n19. Doug Bollinger\n\n32 of 50\n\nScott Barbour/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 39\n\nWickets: 62\n\nStrike Rate: 31.3\n\nPerhaps more famous for his hair than his bowling, Doug Bollinger can consider himself unlucky not to have enjoyed a more prolific career than the one he has followed.\n\nAggressive and unrelenting, the left-armer captured 50 wickets in just 12 Tests and 62 wickets in 39 one-day internationals, but hasn't represented Australia in either format for three years.\n\nWhile considerably less spectacular than fellow left-armer Mitchell Johnson, Bollinger's reliability and longevity have proven to be his strengths, seeing him still in consideration for national selection at age 33.\n\n18. Lasith Malinga\n\n33 of 50\n\nJan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 177\n\nWickets: 271\n\nStrike Rate: 31.2\n\nIt must be a nightmare for opposing batsmen to line up against Lasith Malinga, given the way his unique, slinging action hides the ball from sight for so long.\n\nIn an era dominated by power hitting, that has proven to be a decisive advantage for the Sri Lankan, who has grown to become one of the world's greatest 50-over performers.\n\nAlso aiding Malinga is his extraordinary ability to deliver unplayable yorkers in the dying overs, giving his team a potent weapon to turn to at the end of an innings.\n\n17. Sajeewa De Silva\n\n34 of 50\n\nGEMUNU AMARASINGHE/Associated Press\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 38\n\nWickets: 52\n\nStrike Rate: 31.1\n\nWith a typical subcontinental style, Sajeewa de Silva enjoyed a brief career as a seamer for Sri Lanka in the late 1990s.\n\nOnly a bowler of medium pace, De Silva earned his wickets with strong control and clever swing, also assisted by the angle created by his position as a left-armer.\n\nComing into the team after Sri Lanka's triumphant World Cup campaign in 1996, De Silva enjoyed great success against Pakistan, New Zealand and India in his first two years on the international stage, but only remained a part of the side until 2000.\n\n16. Clint McKay\n\n35 of 50\n\nMatt Roberts/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 59\n\nWickets: 97\n\nStrike Rate: 30.5\n\nClint McKay has been a perfect example of Australia's contrasting needs and priorities in the Test and one-day international arenas.\n\nWhile not armed with the pace or incisiveness to demand inclusion in the five-day game, McKay's control and array of variations have made him an important member of the nation's 50-over side since 2009, complementing the likes of Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc or Nathan Coulter-Nile in the team's new-ball partnership.\n\nAnd while the Victorian didn't take part in the recent triangular series in Zimbabwe, he'll certainly be a prominent member in Australia's World Cup campaign on home soil next year.\n\n15. Waqar Younis\n\n36 of 50\n\nHamish Blair/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 262\n\nWickets: 416\n\nStrike Rate: 30.5\n\nNo bowler in world cricket has ever been more revered for an ability to produce a reverse-swinging yorker quite like Pakistan's Waqar Younis.\n\nIn tandem with the great Wasim Akram, the right-armer was perhaps the most lethal 50-over bowler of his generation, knocking over stumps with frightening regularity.\n\nWith so many players now attempting to mimic his dynamic reverse swing, Waqar can be credited with bringing the art to the fore.\n\n14. Saqlain Mushtaq\n\n37 of 50\n\nBen Radford/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 169\n\nWickets: 288\n\nStrike Rate: 30.4\n\nFor a bowler of his immense skill, Saqlain Mushtaq's ride at the pinnacle of international cricket was rather short.\n\nRecognised as the first off-spinner to deliver the doosra with success, the Pakistani quickly became a prolific wicket-taker at a time when batsmen were rarely faced with such variations.\n\nAnd along with a superb strike rate, Saqlain's average of 21.78 is among the finest marks in the 50-over game.\n\nHowever, the off-spinner's effectiveness declined quickly as batsmen became more accustomed to the varieties of limited-overs finger spin, seeing him discarded from the Pakistan team in 2003.\n\n13. Junaid Khan\n\n38 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nMatches: 48\n\nWickets: 75\n\nStrike Rate: 30.2\n\nIn recent times, Junaid Khan had added an iconic hop in the middle of the run up, making his approach one of the more entertaining aspects of his play.\n\nBut despite his unusual style, the Pakistani has been one of the latest in a long line of impressive seamers from his nation, entrenching himself in the national side since his debut in 2011.\n\nWhat has made the left-armer effective has been his ability to swing the ball around, both with the new and the old ball.\n\nOf course, Junaid can be expensive, but the pace at which he collects wickets has helped to offset that.\n\n12. Alex Cusack\n\n39 of 50\n\n11. Morne Morkel\n\n40 of 50\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 80\n\nWickets: 135\n\nStrike Rate: 29.8\n\nIncredibly, Morne Morkel sits above both Dale Steyn and Allan Donald on this list, owning a strike rate below 30 in a 50-over career that is now in its eighth year.\n\nThanks to his immense height, the South African can extract bounce that others are incapable of, pushing opponents back and causing discomfort for batsmen more accustomed to playing the ball around waist height in the limited-overs formats.\n\nAnd when Morkel is at his fastest, there are few in the game who can handle him.\n\n10. Ryan McLaren\n\n41 of 50\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nCountry: South Africa\n\nMatches: 49\n\nWickets: 74\n\nStrike Rate: 29.7\n\nFor a long time, Ryan McLaren lurked around the fringes of the South African team, struggling to earn selection as an all-rounder.\n\nSince the beginning of 2013, however, McLaren has seized upon his opportunities, becoming a regular in the country's limited-overs lineups.\n\nParticularly with the ball, the right-armer has been prolific, capturing 65 wickets at 21.96 since the start of last year to be South Africa's leading one-day bowler in that time.\n\n9. Len Pascoe\n\n42 of 50\n\nGetty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 29\n\nWickets: 53\n\nStrike Rate: 29.5\n\nAlongside the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, Len Pascoe made a stunning impact in his short spell in the Australia team, capturing wickets at a rate rarely seen previously.\n\nGenuinely fast and possessing that combative edge one associates with Australian cricketers, Pascoe quickly impressed with 4/29 against the West Indies in 1979.\n\nInjury unfortunately cut his career short in the early 1980s, just as one-day international cricket was blossoming in the wake of World Series Cricket.\n\n8. Brett Lee\n\n43 of 50\n\nMatt Roberts/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 221\n\nWickets: 380\n\nStrike Rate: 29.4\n\nBrett Lee had it all as a fast bowler: The raw speed, the dynamic out-swing, the rhythmic action and the movie-star looks.\n\nWhen he burst onto the scene at the turn of the century, Lee gave Australia's attack another dimension, complementing the precision of Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie with the sort of pace not seen Down Under since the days of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson.\n\nOf course, periods of injury and lapses in form were interspersed throughout Lee's career, but he quickly added guile and nous to his speed to become a lethal component of Australia's 50-over side.\n\n7. Geoff Allott\n\n44 of 50\n\nMike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nCountry: New Zealand\n\nMatches: 31\n\nWickets: 52\n\nStrike Rate: 29.3\n\nGeoff Allott's time on the international stage was incredibly short lived. Ruined by injury, the left-armer's career with New Zealand spanned just four years in the late 1990s.\n\nIn that time, though, Allott made a huge impression, starring in the 1999 World Cup in England, capturing hauls of 3/30, 4/37, 4/64, 3/15 and 3/24 to be the tournament's leading bowler.\n\nSadly, the Kiwi's career ended little more than a year later as a long-running back problem forced him into retirement.\n\n6. Shane Bond\n\n45 of 50\n\nClive Mason/Getty Images\n\nCountry: New Zealand\n\nMatches: 82\n\nWickets: 147\n\nStrike Rate: 29.2\n\nNot long after Geoff Allott retired, New Zealand found itself with another potent force in the form of Shane Bond.\n\nBut unlike so many other of the nation's seamers who had relied upon seam movement and control, Bond was explosive, a man who delivered the ball at extreme pace with late swing.\n\nSeveral destructions of Australia in 2002 immediately put the spotlight on the right-armer, and he carried that blistering form into the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nBut Bond's career will always be a case of \"what if,\" given the persistent struggles with injury that dogged his time in the game.\n\n5. Mohammed Shami\n\n46 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: India\n\nMatches: 33\n\nWickets: 58\n\nStrike Rate: 29.0\n\nMohammed Shami's international career is still less than two years old, but already the Indian speedster has made quite an impact.\n\nWith a touch more pace than many of his counterparts, the right-armer has used his threatening late swing to race to 58 one-day international wickets in rapid time.\n\nAfter enduring a tough Test series in England this summer, Shami also bounced back strongly in the subsequent 50-over clashes, perhaps suggesting his skills are far more suited to the limited-overs formats.\n\n4. Thisara Perera\n\n47 of 50\n\nTom Shaw/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 79\n\nWickets: 103\n\nStrike Rate: 29.0\n\nIt never really worked out for Thisara Perera in the Test arena, but the all-rounder is enjoying a fine career in the limited-overs formats for Sri Lanka.\n\nAn extremely useful seamer as well as a strong hitter with the bat, the 25-year-old has cemented his place in Angelo Mathews' surging team following a brilliant series against Pakistan in August.\n\nNot at all express in pace, the right-armer has excelled with subtle variations and a skiddy style that can hurry batsmen.\n\n3. Ryan Ten Doeschate\n\n48 of 50\n\nDaniel Berehulak/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nMatches: 33\n\nWickets: 55\n\nStrike Rate: 28.7\n\nRyan ten Doeschate hasn't played for the Netherlands since the 2011 World Cup, opting to make a living by travelling to the world's various domestic Twenty20 competitions such as the Indian Premier League.\n\nBut during his short spell for the Dutch, the all-rounder was a standpoint performer, smashing hundreds and claiming wickets in a rapid fashion.\n\nAnd while his best performances with the ball came against other Associates, his strong presence in the IPL and subsequent Champions League Twenty20 is an indication of his talent.\n\n2. Shaun Tait\n\n49 of 50\n\nGraham Crouch/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nMatches: 35\n\nWickets: 62\n\nStrike Rate: 27.2\n\nIt didn't take long for Australia's Shaun Tait to adopt the nickname \"The Wild Thing.\"\n\nFerociously fast, the South Australian quickly became an iconic figure in his nation's limited-overs sides from 2007 onwards, utilising an unusual action that produced extraordinary speed to bewilder the world's batsmen.\n\nBut Tait's stamina was often as issue, as his pace tended to decline rapidly after a handful of overs. The grind eventually took a toll on the speedster's body, relegating him to the role of a Twenty20 specialist.\n\n1. Ajantha Mendis\n\n50 of 50\n\nGareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nMatches: 76\n\nWickets: 135\n\nStrike Rate: 27.2\n\nAjantha Mendis certainly isn't the extreme force he once was when he entered international cricket in blistering fashion in 2008.\n\nArmed with a dazzling array of variations that defied the textbooks, the Sri Lankan proved too deceptive for the world's batsmen, enjoying extraordinary success in his initial spell in the game.\n\nBut Mendis' effectiveness has sharply declined; batsmen have deciphered his riddle, exposing the weaknesses of his fundamentals.\n\nNow 29, Mendis is in and out of the Sri Lankan side, unable to secure his position amid the ongoing brilliance from Rangana Herath.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nX"
