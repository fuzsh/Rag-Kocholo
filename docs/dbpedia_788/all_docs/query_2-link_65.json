        "text": "A \\(7.00-\\mathrm{kg}\\) bowling ball moves at \\(3.00 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\). How fast must a \\(2.45\\) -g Ping-Pong ball move so that the two balls have the same kinetic energy?\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nThe Ping-Pong ball needs to move at approximately 400 m/s to have the same kinetic energy as the bowling ball.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nCalculate the Kinetic Energy of the Bowling Ball\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is \\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Plug in given values, where \\(m = 7.00 \\,kg\\) is the mass and \\(v = 3.00 \\,m/s\\) is the velocity for the bowling ball. The energy comes out as \\[KE = \\frac{1}{2} * 7.00 \\,kg * (3.00 \\,m/s)^2 = 31.5 \\,J\\].\n\n02\n\nSolve for the Ping-Pong Ball's Velocity\n\nThe kinetic energy of the ping-pong ball should be equal to the kinetic energy of the bowling ball, i.e., \\(31.5 \\,J\\). The equation becomes \\(31.5 \\,J = \\frac{1}{2}m_{pp}v_{pp}^2\\). Where \\(m_{pp} = 2.45 \\,g = 0.00245 \\,kg\\), after converting grams to kilograms. Now solve for \\(v_{pp}\\) (velocity of ping-pong ball). This provides the solution \\(v_{pp} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2*31.5 \\,J}{0.00245 \\,kg}} \\approx 400 \\,m/s\\).\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nUnderstanding Physics Problems\n\nWhen working on physics problems, a clear understanding of the given parameters and what you are solving for is vital. In this particular problem, we are dealing with kinetic energy and comparing two different objects with distinct masses and velocities. The effective approach is to first isolate the key concept – kinetic energy – and apply its formula:\n\nKinetic energy (KE) is defined by the equation\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere 'm' represents mass and 'v' represents velocity. Physics problems often require a step-by-step analysis, which in this case starts with calculating the bowling ball's kinetic energy. This initial step frames the problem and provides a target value to work towards when finding the velocity of the second object, the Ping-Pong ball.\n\nEnergy Conservation\n\nEnergy conservation is a principle stating that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This is a cornerstone of mechanics and is incredibly useful in solving physics problems like the one we're addressing.\n\nWith the conservation principle, we assert that the kinetic energy of the bowling ball should be equal to that of the Ping-Pong ball for them to share the same energy. It is important to remember that energy's conservation allows us to set their kinetic energies equal. This gives factual support to proceed with the calculations and solve for the unknown – the velocity of the Ping-Pong ball.\n\nMechanics\n\nMechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces that affect them. In this scenario, we focus on a particular aspect of mechanics: finding the velocity necessary for two objects with different masses to have equivalent kinetic energies.\n\nMechanics involves understanding different types of energies and forces. The problem we solved uses concepts of linear kinetic energy, which is kinetic energy associated with the linear, or straight-line, motion of an object. Through the formula provided and considering the mass of each object, we can deduce how fast or slow an object should be moving to have a certain amount of kinetic energy—a fundamental concept in the field of mechanics."
