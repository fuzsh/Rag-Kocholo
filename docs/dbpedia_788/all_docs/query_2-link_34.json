Ohio led 12-7 with 3:24 left in the first, but a small scoring drought allowed Bowling Green to catch up with the Bobcats. At the end of the quarter, Ohio and Bowling Green were tied at 20-20.\n\nThe baskets did not fall in Ohio's favor during the second quarter.

The Bobcats shortened Bowling Green's lead to 52-40 heading into the final quarter of the game.\n\nBowling Green went on to win the game over Ohio, 69-52.\n\nTHE JAYA MCCLURE SHOW: SEASON 2\n\nAfter missing the first game of the season due to injury, McClure has returned to the court with a commanding presence and has acted as a major playmaker for the Bobcats. She has played started in nine of 13 games, amassing 157 points.\n\nMcClure ranks second on the team with 40 assists and has recorded seven double figure point games. She matched her season-best in points for the third time this season with 21 at Bellarmine (12/30).
