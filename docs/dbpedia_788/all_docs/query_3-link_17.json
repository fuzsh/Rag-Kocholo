        "text": "As far as I can see, no country has fielded an identical ODI XI more than two years apart. Sri Lanka had identical teams in these two ODIs, 682 days apart...\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/74/74463.html\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/79/79166.html\n\nSri Lanka used the same XI ten times in 1996, which was the team that won the World Cup.\n\nIn Tests, West Indies fielded identical XIs in two Tests 1059 days apart, from 1988 to 1991. The same XI played in nine other Tests in between, giving the most appearances by an identical XI. Of course, West Indies used other combinations in this period as well.\n\n********\n\nBatsmen making Test centuries after being dropped on 0 (since 2001): AB de Villiers AJ Stewart AN Cook DR Martyn DS Lehmann Habibul Bashar Inzamam-ul-Haq KC Sangakkara KP Pietersen MEK Hussey ML Hayden SR Tendulkar RT Ponting.\n\nHayden and Inzamam appear twice. The highest score made by someone dropped on 0 is 270 by Sangakkara at Bulawayo 2004. Tendulkar was dropped on 0 when he made his highest Test score (248*). Hussey (195) was dropped first ball (debatable). de Villiers (164) was also dropped first ball.\n\n[As always, some dropped catches are debatable, and others might not have been recorded.]\n\n********\n\nMost expensive maiden overs: at Wellington in 1977/78, the first over of the match, bowled by Bob Willis, was a maiden costing ten runs: eight byes and two no balls.\n\nIn an ODI at Cuttack in 2008, Irfan Pathan bowled a maiden over with eight leg byes.\n\n********\n\nI did do a calculation recently that in since 2013 teams batting first, for the full 50 overs, reached the halfway score point early in the 32nd over, on average. This is a slight shift from earlier times, where the halfway was indeed about 30 overs.\n\n********\n\nVictor Trumper once scored 50 runs off nine balls bowled by one bowler. It was in a first grade match in October 1907 (not first-class, but quite a high level) during an innings of 89 in 35 minutes for Paddington v Waverley. The bower was Rose, and the hits were 4,4,6,6,6,6 (in one over) then 6,6,6.\n\nThe account is unclear but it seems very likely that Trumper faced ball(s) in between the two overs. Other sources say that Trumper faced ten balls from Rose, with a dot ball in the second over, but the Sydney Mail of 30 October 1907 says explicitly\n\nIn Rose's following over, Trumper was brought face to face with him at the fourth ball, and he hit three more sixers off the three remaining balls, which gave a total of a half century off nine balls received in succession from Rose.\"\n\n17 March 2015\n\nBland\n\nI have been trying to blog something about the World Cup. Of course, there are many possibilities but I struggle for inspiration, Im afraid. Cricket is becoming disengaged from its traditions, and it gets harder to compare the players with their predecessors, particularly in the one-day game.\n\n********\n\nSome rough notes on deaths and serious injuries in cricket\n\nIn first-class cricket, fatal incidents like Philip Hughes are extremely rare. In Australian first-class cricket, Hughes is the only batsman to be struck by a fast ball and die as a result. Overseas, there are a couple of others: George Summers in England in 1870, and Abdul Aziz in Pakistan in 1959. (Aziz was struck in the chest by a slow bowler, and may have had a heart condition. Legend has it that the scorebook listed Aziz in the second innings as Absent dead). Very few if any others.\n\nThere have been a few incidents that looked similar to Hughes. Justin Langer was struck in the same area in 2006, first ball, and spent a little time in hospital. Only a few weeks before Hughes, Ahmed Shahzad was struck in the same area, in a Test match, and suffered a fractured skull. He did not retire hurt because he fell on his stumps and was out hit wicket.\n\nFielders have also died, on rare occasions, after being struck. Raman Lamba, who played for India, died after being struck (without a helmet) while fielding at short leg in a first-class match in Dhaka in 1998.\n\nThere have been near-fatal injuries to Test batsmen. In 1929, Jock Cameron, captain of South Africa, was unconscious for several days after being struck by Harold Larwood. In 1974, tailender Ewan Chatfield was struck in the temple by Peter Lever, collapsed and stopped breathing. He was revived by a quick-thinking physiotherapist who rushed onto the field. Chatfield went on to have a successful Test career. In 1979, Rick Darling was struck in the chest by Bob Willis, couldnt breathe, and had to be revived.\n\nThere would be more incidents in minor cricket, but I havent seen a list of such cases in Australia.\n\nDeaths from other causes have occurred in first-class cricket, and some senior cricketers have died while playing minor matches, including Ian Folley of Lancashire who was struck in the eye. In that case, the injury required surgery but was not itself life-threatening; Folleys death during surgery was due to medical negligence. Wilf Slack was a Test cricketer who died on the field (heart attack in a minor match in Africa), also Wasim Raja of Pakistan (at age 56 in a minor match). Andy Ducat, who had played one Test, dropped dead during a minor match in 1942. Maurice Nichol, age 29, of Worcestershire died (during the night) of a heart attack during a 3-day first-class match in 1934. The match continued without him! There have been deaths in car accidents during matches including Charles Bull in 1939.\n\nPerhaps the strangest was the death of Frederick Prince of Wales in 1751. Frederick was the heir to the British throne and a keen cricketer. His death from a lung abscess supposedly resulted from being hit by a cricket ball, although this is unproven.\n\nThere have also been deaths of umpires during matches, including Syd Buller (in 1970) who had been a survivor of the Charles Bull car crash. An umpire in Israel was killed by a cricket ball just a few weeks after Hughes death.\n\nOn debut in 1975/76, the first two balls bowled to Graham Yallop were bouncers; the first one knocked his cap off. In 1978, Yallop became the first batsman in Tests to wear a helmet, although they had been used earlier in Packers World Series Cricket (firstly by Dennis Amiss). A serious injury to David Hookes, trying to hook an Andy Roberts bouncer in the early days of World Series Cricket, stimulated the adoption of helmets. Cricket helmets had been made in the 1960s (for Australia in the West Indies in 1965) but were never used.\n\nIn club cricket in the 1980s, helmets were little used.\n\nFor some years in the 70s and 80s there was a prohibition on intimidatory bowling in the Laws of Cricket. However, the definition of that was left up to the umpires, and one or two bouncers (or even more) per over generally did not initiate a warning. From about 1986, there was a specific limit of one bouncer per over in One-Day Internationals. This was extended to Test cricket in 1991 (after a heavy bouncer onslaught by West Indies against England in April 1991), but was relaxed to two bouncers per over in 1994.\n\nI have a few scoresheets from the 70s and 80s that mark when bouncers were bowled. I have only taken a quick look, but for the West Indian pace attack, one per over was not uncommon but two was a little unusual. More than that was very unusual. One problem with such stats is in the definition of a bouncer: a ball that rises fast towards the chest may be more dangerous that a very short ball at the batsmans head, but may not count as a bouncer.\n\nSome statistics follow on the historical incidence of batsmen retiring hurt in Tests. This is not a direct measure of bouncers but gives a general idea. Note that many batsmen who are hit do not retire hurt, and others retire hurt for other reasons (Michael Clarke notably). However you can see how the frequency of retired hurt increased substantially with the increase in the number of fast bowlers (and their aggressiveness) in the 1970s and 1980s. The numbers began to decline again in the late 1980s as the use of helmets and other protection became more widespread. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the incidence of retired hurt was higher against the West Indies bowlers than other countries.\n\nIn the last five years, retired hurt rates continued to fall. I am not sure why this is. The rate is now so low that bowlers are now more likely to retire hurt than batsmen.\n\nHistorical Rate of Batsmen Retiring Hurt in Tests (numbers Retiring Hurt per 10 Tests)\n\nRH per 10 Tests\n\nRH\n\nTests\n\n1877-1914\n\n0.60\n\n8\n\n134\n\n1920-1939\n\n0.79\n\n11\n\n140\n\n1945-1959\n\n1.80\n\n39\n\n217\n\n1960s\n\n1.37\n\n25\n\n182\n\n1970-74\n\n2.44\n\n21\n\n86\n\n1975-79\n\n2.67\n\n32\n\n120\n\n1980-84\n\n2.63\n\n36\n\n137\n\n1985-89\n\n1.64\n\n21\n\n128\n\n1990-94\n\n1.18\n\n18\n\n153\n\n1995-99\n\n1.48\n\n29\n\n196\n\n2000-04\n\n1.05\n\n27\n\n257\n\n2005-09\n\n1.30\n\n27\n\n207\n\n2010-14\n\n0.60\n\n12\n\n199\n\n********\n\nI can find only one case of a bowler taking a wicket, and then losing his own wicket, off consecutive balls in a Test match. At the MCG in 1937, Bill OReilly dismissed Hedley Verity to finish off England for 76 on a sticky wicket. He was sent in to bat immediately as a nightwatchman, but fell to the first ball of the innings, c&b Voce. Too bad Voce wasnt the man that OReilly had dismissed: that would have been a neat symmetry.\n\nThere are various cases of the converse, that is a batsman being out, then taking a wicket with the next ball of the match (first ball of the next innings). That is more common because opening bowlers are often tailenders and so frequently are last man out.\n\n********\n\nLongest Career without a Man of the Match Award (since 1985)\n\nTest\n\nMoin Khan\n\n69\n\nPD Collingwood\n\n68\n\nD Ramdin\n\n64\n\nADR Campbell\n\n60\n\nHAPW Jayawardene\n\n58\n\nFH Edwards\n\n55\n\nHabibul Bashar\n\n50\n\nODI\n\nNR Mongia\n\n140\n\nKhaled Mashud\n\n126\n\nDJ Richardson\n\n122\n\nSaeed Ajmal\n\n111\n\nIDS Smith\n\n98\n\nKS More\n\n94\n\n12 February 2015\n\nNever So Many\n\nI have a posted a graph of the crowd trends in Australia over the last 50-odd years (sorry I cant seem to embed it on this page). The figures are for daily average attendance, and so are not so much affected by fluctuations in the numbers of matches from year to year. The average uses smoothed data for 4-year intervals, to smooth out the bumps caused by Ashes years.\n\nTo better reveal underlying trends, World Cups are not included in the graph. Offseason matches were also excluded.\n\nIn spite of much doomsaying, Test match attendances have been rising more or less continuously in Australia for more than a quarter of a century. Attendances have basically doubled since 1980. Certainly there were times before 1980 when crowds were bigger, but back then there were fewer Tests, and fewer of them were played in smaller venues like Hobart and Perth.\n\nAnother striking feature is that attendances at Test matches are now exceeding limited overs internationals (ODI + T20i), even on a daily basis. For a full 4-year period, this has occurred the first time since ODIs became fully established in the calendar in 1979. This is partly due to a softening of support for ODIs during this century, but is something that would have been almost unimaginable 30 years ago, before Twenty20, when the doomsayers thought that ODIs would destroy Test cricket.\n\nMore than balancing the drop in ODIs has been a surge in interest in the franchise-based game, in the form of Twenty20 (Big Bash and so forth). As hard as I find it to get personally interested in this aspect, its success is always very welcome as long as it is not at the expense of the Test game.\n\nThe Big Bash attracted 823,000 people to the game this summer (might I recommend an excellent new website Australian Sporting Attendances that make this data easy to access), and it might have been even more if they had not scheduled the Final in Canberra. Once the World Cup is over, cricket will have had its biggest season ever in Australia. This is heartening at a local level, since A-League soccer has been moving in on crickets turf, so to speak. Good to see both thriving.\n\nAnd now they are predicting a TV audience of a billion people for the upcoming India/Pakistan game in Adelaide in the World Cup, rivalling the Soccer World Cup final.\n\nAnd yes, Test cricket is under threat and strain in other places, but that is a story for another day.\n\n********\n\nReadjusting a Record\n\nFor some time I have listed Manchester 1936, the second session if the second day, as the highest-scoring 2-hour session in Test cricket, with 240 runs. This was based on a newspaper report that India was 69/0 at tea, after England (400/6 at lunch) declared at 571/8. Looking at a wider range of newspapers now online, this now seems unlikely. [Side note: the slow but sure extension of old newspapers available online is revolutionising this sort of research. In the past, I have actually made multiple trips to the British Library, 20,000 km round trip, to do such research, but even then I missed some of the reports I can now get online. The British Library was also not an easy place to do research for those with time constraints.]\n\nThe reports are not fully consistent. However, it appears that England declared at 3:50 and the Indian innings started at 4:04. India batted about 145 minutes before stumps at 6:30, Mushtaq Ali reaching 100 in 139 minutes and 105 out of 190 overnight. There was therefore no time for a tea break in this innings: it must have been taken between innings; unusually early, but it seems to be the case. This leaves us with 171 runs before tea and 190 after. The day remains the most productive in Test history with 588 runs. Unfortunately, none of the myriad sources gives the number of overs bowled during that day.\n\nPerhaps the reported tea at 69/0 was a drinks break after an hour, or at 5pm. At that ime, tea breaks were generally taken on the field in England and would have looked a lot like extended drinks breaks.\n\nMushtaq Alis innings needs to be added to the list of centuries in a session, even if the session was an extended one.\n\nThis re-establishes Australias 236/2 at Johannesburg in 1921 as the most productive 2-hour session in Tests.\n\n********\n\nWhile I have them on hand here are some stats on the decline in caught and bowled dismissals. After reading about how the power in superbats can represent a hazard to infielders and umpires, I took a look at the proportion of catches in ODIs that are taken by the bowler. If balls are getting hit harder, you might expect fewer to be caught by the bowler. Indeed, there is a clear historical trend.\n\n% catches in ODIs taken by the Bowler\n\n1986-1990 7.8%\n\n1991-1995 7.9%\n\n1996-2000 7.9%\n\n2001-2005 6.1%\n\n2006-2010 5.7%\n\n2011-2015 5.1%\n\nC&B figures were very steady up to 2000 and then suddenly dropped (coinciding with the first Superbats) and continued to drop. For 2014-15, the figures have been even lower, at an all-time low of 4.2%. This is evidence that C&Bs in ODIs are getting harder to take.\n\nIn Tests there is a somewhat similar pattern, although less pronounced. C&B in Tests is somewhat lower, perhaps because far more catches go to the slips. The figure for 2011-15 of 3.4% is an all-time low. In three Tests so far 2015, there has been only one C&B in 61 catches.\n\n18 January 2015\n\nThe Official Ratings for Test Batsmen\n\nFor quite a few years now, perhaps a quarter of a century, a quasi-official player ratings system has been in place. It changes name regularly, along with sponsors, and is currently known as the Reliance ICC Player Ranking. If memory serves, its first manifestation, in the late 1980s, was the Deloitte Rankings.\n\nThe website with the current rankings embraces a mountain of data, with complete rankings, on a daily basis, available going back to the beginning, for various types of Mens and Womens international cricket. What is lacking there is any sort of deeper analysis. So I did a bit of downloading. Daunted by the volume of daily data, I downloaded month-by-month data for Test batsmen, going back to 1958. I could (and perhaps should) go back further, but I feel that the methodology works less well when matches are more infrequent, and there is a lack of genuinely competitive teams as one goes back further.\n\nI leave it to others to argue the utility of the ratings. I would say, though, that the principle of weighting performances in favour of recent results is consistent with ratings methods in other sports, and does maintain an up-to-date feel.\n\nAnyhow, some stats.

He did not reach #1 until 1960.)\n\nSobers domination reflects the superiority of his performances in a time when scoring was generally not very high, and the great length of his career. Remarkably, his peak rating of 938 in January 1967 came at a time when he was also winning Bowler of the Match awards. He last held top ranking in March 1974, exactly 20 years after his debut and 14 years after his first #1 in 1960 (it is interesting that scoring 1115 runs in ten innings at an average near 200 in 1958 did not get him to #1). As for Richards, at his best I remember him as the most dominating batsman of his time, and unmatched since.\n\nAnother way of filtering the data, that might allow better comparison, would be to eliminate months where the player was #1 but did not play. This gives us months where a player actively held onto the top ranking.\n\n#1 and played (retain)\n\nGS Sobers\n\n28\n\nIVA Richards\n\n27\n\nSR Tendulkar\n\n16\n\nKC Sangakkara\n\n15\n\nBC Lara\n\n14\n\nGA Gooch\n\n12\n\nSM Gavaskar\n\n12\n\nSR Waugh\n\n12\n\nThe next table shows players who actively regained #1 position most times.\n\nRegain/lose\n\nSR Tendulkar\n\n11\n\nBC Lara\n\n9\n\nIVA Richards\n\n8\n\nKC Sangakkara\n\n8\n\nAR Border\n\n7\n\nGS Sobers\n\n7\n\nJH Kallis\n\n7\n\nThis data reflects battles royal for top position between Tendulkar and Lara, sustained over a number of years, and also between Richards and Border.\n\nMore stats:\n\n·The highest rating since 1958 is 942 by Ricky Ponting in 2006.\n\n·The highest rating for a player who was not #1 is also Ponting, 936 for #2 spot in December 2007, behind Sangakkara on 938.\n\n·Most players with simultaneous ratings in the 900s: four in November 2007. Sangakkara ranked #4 with a rating of 900.\n\n·The lowest rating for a #1 player is 736 by Ian Chappell in August 1973. Chappell, who had just one month as #1, reached a rating of 811 two years later, but never regained #1.\n\n·Biggest lead for a #1 player is 140 by Sobers in Dec 1968. The only other players with 100 leads were Richards (peaking at 110), Gooch (100) and Steve Waugh (121 in Jan 1997).\n\n·Most appearances at #2: 49 by Rohan Kanhai. For the reason why, see Sobers (above).\n\nFinally some stats on Top 10 appearances, as a percentage of career. Interesting to see Kanhai besting Sobers on this measure.\n\nFinally finally, a word on Tendulkar. It is surprising that his rating never reached 900, peaking at 898 in 2002. More than 20 batsmen since the 1950s have reached higher ratings than this. Tendulkar spent a 53-month period outside the Top 10, from 2005 to 2009. Even so, he made 170 appearances in the Top 10. Perhaps his signal achievement was regaining #1, briefly in 2010, and then again in 2011 (tied with Kallis), more than 20 years after his debut. His appearances at # 1 spanned more than 16 years, surpassing even Sobers.\n\nOn reports that Richie Benaud is struggling with skin cancer:\n\nI do recall about 10 years ago going to a function where there were quite a number of old-time Australian Test cricketers from the 50s, 60s and 70s. Seeing them in the flesh, I was struck by the observation that they all had one thing in common: weather-beaten skin. All of them had spent much too much time in the summer sun without the skin protection that is essential for us pale people.\n\nThere was an obsession with a 'healthy tan' back then. Australians from those times now have the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.\n\n********\n\nNo bowler has taken wickets with both the first ball and the last ball of a completed Test match, but Imran Khan (the original) came close. At Kandy in 1986, Imran dismissed Sidath Wettimuny with the second ball of the match, and later finished the match off by dismissing Jayananda Warnaweera, Pakistan winning the match by an innings.\n\nThere are 50 cases of a bowler taking both the first and last wickets of a completed Test. Brett Lee, Imran Khan and Waqar Younis all did so three times.\n\n********\n\nAt this point in time, there have now been 115 Test matches (including draws) since a player from a losing side won a Player of the Match (PoM) award.\n\nThere have been seven Tests in that time where a player from the losing side either scored more runs than the PoM (if the award went to a batsman), or took more wickets (if the award went to a bowler); awards for all-round performances were excluded from this part of the analysis.\n\n********\n\nI figure that Wasim Akram bowled 20 hat-trick balls in Tests. 18 of them were unsuccessful. On other occasions Wasim took wickets with consecutive balls, but they were his last balls in the match, so there was no hat-trick ball. It's hard to check everyone, but there are no other contenders apart from Murali with 17 unsuccessful hat-trick balls.\n\n********\n\nIn India, bowlers seem to be in for nothing but toil and trouble in ODIs, especially at the hands of the Indian batsmen. Some stats: since 2011, teams batting first in India average 282, in other Test-playing countries it is 243. India averages 246 away and 299.7 (!) at home. Other teams that have played in India average 270 in India and 241 elsewhere.\n\n(Uninterrupted games)\n\n********\n\nHitting the Winning Run in ODIs: since 1999, although data is not quite complete, there is no doubt about the leader. I found 24 cases for MS Dhoni, with no one else more than 12. Does not include matches that ended with extras.\n\nDhoni has been not out at the end of an ODI 38 times. (Of course, sometimes his batting partner hits the winning runs.) India lost only one of those games; on that occasion, against Pakistan, India was all out, so Dhoni has never been left not out at the end of 50 overs in a losing cause, at least when batting second.\n\n********\n\n1 December 2014\n\nThe Least Desired Record\n\nShortest interval between last international appearance and date of death.\n\nDays\n\nDied\n\nGF Grace\n\n14\n\n1880\n\nPJ Hughes\n\n46\n\n*\n\n2014\n\nBC Hollioake\n\n53\n\n*\n\n2002\n\nHB Cameron\n\n74\n\n1935\n\nWW Whysall\n\n81\n\n1930\n\nDJ Pringle\n\n112\n\n*\n\n1975\n\nOG Smith\n\n162\n\n1959\n\nKJ Wadsworth\n\n179\n\n*\n\n1976\n\nDLS de Silva\n\n301\n\n*\n\n1980\n\nManjural Islam Rana\n\n356\n\n*\n\n2007\n\nFW Milligan\n\n360\n\n1900\n\nNBF Mann\n\n366\n\n1952\n\n* indicates ODI appearance\n\n********\n\nThe Hot 100 for 2014\n\nI have updated the lists for fastest and slowest scoring Test batsmen. As in past years, these lists change only slowly, but there is one new important entry, with David Warner qualifying for the first time, and making a spectacular entrance at #6 with a rate of 73.4 runs per 100 balls. We now have what appears a final rate for Virender Sehwag, who has held #2 spot just ahead of Adam Gilchrist.\n\nMoving up the charts is Stuart Broad, who has scored at a Jessopian 113 r/100b in 2014, and gains 5 places, after losing some ground in 2013 thanks partly to an innings of 6 off 77 balls in an attempted match-save. Broad, however, has scored only one half-century in his last 48 Test innings. In better form was Brad Haddin, whose high and fast scoring since the last instalment sees him move from #53 to #42.\n\nLists for slowest scorers and most tenacious batsmen (longest average innings) dont change much, but Faf du Plessis now qualifies for the latter list and is the highest-ranked present-day batsmen, for now at least. The evergreen Chanderpaul has moved up the list, averaging 148 balls per dismissal since the last assessment in 2013 and is now ranked #29.\n\n********\n\nA regular feature of cricket commentary is the knell of articles proclaiming the decline and end of Test cricket. Maybe one day they will be right, but I am more than old enough to remember how in the 1980s One-Day cricket was swamping and destroying Test cricket in Australia. Some destruction: last December saw the all-time record cricket crowd, at the MCG, and it was in a Test. Earlier than that, Ashes Test in England in the 1970s were often played before half-empty stands.\n\nIn any case, the present situation in India, which has a monkey grip on the games finances, remains troubling. Test crowds there are poor to indifferent. Yet there is other evidence that Test cricket retains its fascination. You would think that Cricinfo, for example, would go wherever the interest goes, but Test cricket is not losing its place at Cricinfo, in my estimation.\n\nAnyway, some stats. On Cricinfo, a recent Test in Dubai, before mostly empty stands, received 30 articles that attracted over 1150 comments from readers. (This is even though it involves Pakistan, a nation with intractable problems that cannot even host international cricket anymore.) I compared that to the final of the Champions League Trophy, a major match in the Indian T20 sledgehammer that is supposedly destroying Test cricket. The match got nine articles in Cricinfo that attracted a total of 179 comments.\n\nThere are still a lot of genuine Test cricket fans out there. It would certainly be interesting to see which matches get the most page visits at Cricinfo.\n\n********\n\nSome more notes on tea intervals in early Tests.\n\nPrior to 1914, 15-20 minute tea breaks in Australia were normal, but very variable in timing. There was usually no formal tea break if a change of innings occurred after lunch, and sessions as a result could last 2.5 hours or more, in a five-hour day. When Victor Trumper scored a 133 in a 'session' after tea in 1910/11, he batted 154 minutes and 47 overs.\n\nSome reports of early Tests in Australia mention tea breaks taken on the field. Tea breaks occurred in Australia from the very early in the piece. I have noted a tea break on the first day of the 1878/79 Test when Australia was 40/3 after England was out for 113. The 1877 Tests prior to that had rather truncated hours and late lunch breaks.\n\nBrodribb and others describe tea breaks being employed in England in the 1890s. However, I have never noted any references to mid-innings tea breaks in Test match reports from England prior to 1902. Tea breaks of a sort seem to have been taken if there was a change of innings during the afternoon. 15-minute tea breaks are evident in the scorebook of the 1905 series and thereafter.\n\nHours in the 1905 series appear to be : 11:30 (day 1) or 11:00 (other days) to 1:30; 2:15 to 4:30; 4:45 to 6:30.\n\nBetween the wars in England, more often than not, morning sessions were 2.5 hours, 45 minutes lunch, then 2 hour sessions with 15 minutes for tea. The first day was half an hour shorter than this. There were variations on this theme.\n\n********\n\n31 October 2014\n\nThe Slowest Days: A Surprising Analysis\n\nThere are record lists for the fewest runs in a full days play: Cricinfo has one here. It is distorted by the changing norms for over rates and length of daily play, varying over history and between countries. I was surprised to find that the record-holder, 95 runs in about 290 minutes play at Karachi in 1956, was a day with only 67.5 overs, vastly atypical for its time, and way below the standards for a complete day even now. The next on the list, 104 runs in the equivalent Test in 1959/60, contained a mere 65 overs (that one was not strictly a complete day, as proceedings were interrupted by a visit and presentation to US President Eisenhower).\n\n[The over counts are from my database: they are not available anywhere else.]\n\nI thought it might be more useful to present the slowest days in term of runs per 100 balls. I simply set the bar at 67 overs or more, and didnt worry too much about whether the days were absolutely complete or interrupted. Remarkably, the record-setting day in 1956 only scrapes into the list at about number 40, and the 1959 Test, even if it had qualified (too few overs), would not be in the top 100. Anyway, here is list of slowest days play. Some days were decidedly incomplete, but all had more than 67 overs. I have appended notes that help show whether a day was complete or not.\n\nSlowest Test Days, Minimum 67 Overs\n\nDay\n\nDay Runs\n\nDay Wkts\n\nDay Overs\n\nR/ 100B\n\nWI v Ind, Bridgetown, Barbados 1962\n\n5\n\n83\n\n8\n\n91.3\n\n15.2\n\nmatch ended before stumps\n\nWI v Eng, Bridgetown, Barbados 1954\n\n3\n\n128\n\n7\n\n114\n\n18.7\n\n5-hour day\n\nAus v Eng, Brisbane ('Gabba') 1958/59 (8-ball ov.)\n\n4\n\n106\n\n8\n\n69\n\n19.2\n\n5-hour day\n\nEng v NZ, Leeds (Headingley) 1958\n\n3\n\n81\n\n11\n\n70.1\n\n19.3\n\nrain interruptions\n\nAus v Eng, Sydney (SCG) 1881/82 (4-ball ov.)\n\n2\n\n119\n\n9\n\n153.2\n\n19.4\n\n5-hour day\n\nSaf v Aus, Johannesburg (Wanderers) 1957/58 (8-ball ov.)\n\n4\n\n119\n\n2\n\n75.2\n\n19.8\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nWI v Ind, Bridgetown, Barbados 1962\n\n4\n\n152\n\n4\n\n127.3\n\n19.9\n\n5-hour day\n\nPak v Ind, Peshawar (Club) 1954/55\n\n1\n\n129\n\n6\n\n106\n\n20.3\n\n5.5-hour day?\n\nNZ v Pak, Auckland 1964/65\n\n1\n\n161\n\n8\n\n131\n\n20.5\n\n6-hour day\n\nInd v Eng, Kanpur 1963/64\n\n3\n\n136\n\n3\n\n109\n\n20.8\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nAus v Eng, Melbourne (MCG) 1891/92\n\n4\n\n188\n\n12\n\n149.5\n\n21.0\n\n4.5 hour day\n\nEng v Aus, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1956\n\n5\n\n121\n\n8\n\n96.2\n\n21.0\n\nmatch ended before stumps\n\nAus v Eng, Brisbane ('Gabba') 1958/59 (8-ball ov.)\n\n3\n\n122\n\n6\n\n72.1\n\n21.2\n\n5-hour day\n\nSaf v Eng, Port Elizabeth 1956/57 (8-ball ov.)\n\n3\n\n122\n\n8\n\n72\n\n21.2\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nNZ v WI, Auckland 1951/52\n\n3\n\n101\n\n7\n\n79.4\n\n21.2\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nSaf v NZ, Durban (Kingsmead) 1953/54 (8-ball ov.)\n\n4\n\n127\n\n8\n\n74.1\n\n21.4\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nSL v SAf, Colombo2 (SSC) 2014\n\n5\n\n121\n\n7\n\n94\n\n21.5\n\n5.2 hours\n\nInd v Pak, Ahmedabad (Gujarat) 1986/87\n\n5\n\n110\n\n2\n\n85\n\n21.6\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nPak v Eng, Hyderabad (Pak) 1977/78 (8-ball ov.)\n\n3\n\n123\n\n9\n\n70.6\n\n21.8\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nEng v NZ, Leeds (Headingley) 1958\n\n5\n\n97\n\n7\n\n74.2\n\n21.8\n\nRain\n\nInd v NZ, Bangalore 1988/89\n\n3\n\n136\n\n6\n\n104\n\n21.8\n\n6-hour day\n\nNZ v Saf, Wellington 1952/53\n\n3\n\n150\n\n11\n\n114.4\n\n21.9\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nPak v Eng, Dhaka 1961/62\n\n4\n\n134\n\n9\n\n102\n\n21.8\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nInd v Aus, Chennai (Nehru) 1959/60\n\n4\n\n112\n\n8\n\n85\n\n22.0\n\nmatch ended before stumps\n\nPak v NZ, Karachi (National) 1955/56\n\n1\n\n145\n\n8\n\n110\n\n22.0\n\n5-hour day\n\nPak v Aus, Karachi (National) 1988/89\n\n4\n\n115\n\n8\n\n87\n\n22.0\n\n5.5-hours play\n\nAus v Eng, Sydney (SCG) 1884/85 (4-ball ov.)\n\n1\n\n97\n\n8\n\n110\n\n22.0\n\n5-hour day, rain\n\nAus v Saf, Adelaide Oval 1993/94\n\n5\n\n111\n\n7\n\n83.5\n\n22.2\n\nmatch ended before stumps\n\nSaf v NZ, Johannesburg (Ellis) 1953/54 (8-ball ov.)\n\n2\n\n130\n\n14\n\n73.3\n\n22.2\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nSaf v Eng, Port Elizabeth 1956/57 (8-ball ov.)\n\n2\n\n136\n\n14\n\n76.1\n\n22.3\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nPak v NZ, Dhaka 1955/56\n\n5\n\n151\n\n7\n\n112\n\n22.5\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nAus v Eng, Melbourne (MCG) 1978/79 (8-ball ov.)\n\n2\n\n122\n\n14\n\n67.1\n\n22.7\n\n6-hour day\n\nPak v Ind, Dhaka 1954/55\n\n2\n\n165\n\n10\n\n120.2\n\n22.9\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nNZ v Saf, Wellington 1952/53\n\n4\n\n114\n\n8\n\n82.5\n\n23.0\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nEng v Saf, Nottingham (Trent Bridge) 1955\n\n3\n\n144\n\n5\n\n104\n\n23.1\n\n15' lost\n\nPak v Aus, Karachi (National) 1956/57\n\n1\n\n95\n\n12\n\n67.5\n\n23.5\n\n5-hour day\n\nInd v Aus, Kolkata 1964/65\n\n2\n\n137\n\n9\n\n96.5\n\n23.7\n\n5.5 hour day\n\nSaf v Ind, Cape Town 1992/93\n\n5\n\n111\n\n5\n\n78\n\n23.7\n\nmatch ended before stumps\n\nThis is certainly a record that is largely frozen in time, but it is interesting to see South Africa making an addition to the list earlier this year, on a day when Sri Lanka proved it was still possible to bowl at reasonable over rates if a team was motivated enough.\n\nThe leader here, when Gibbs took his spell of 8/6, was a day that actually ended before tea, but still contained 91 overs.\n\nSome of the days on the fewest runs list are absent here, and would struggle to make the Top 100 in a fewest runs per over list.\n\n********\n\nMost consecutive balls without a boundary by Australian teams.\n\n279 SCG 1886/87\n\n275 The Oval 1882\n\n273 Dubai 2014\n\nOne more over by Smith and Johnson would have taken this one.

There might be others in the missing Tests. However, the missing Tests tend to be in the subcontinent and West Indies, where boundary hitting has historically been easier and such records are unlikely to be set.\n\n********\n\nThere are 220 cases of two bowlers sharing a combined 10 wickets in a Test innings. Murali and Vaas shared the wickets five times (Murali eight times in all). Oddly, McGrath and Warne never did. (Warne twice with Brett Lee). Jack Saunders did it six times in his career of only 14 Tests, with different bowlers.\n\n********\n\nSix runs with helmet penalties\n\nAustralia got 6 byes including helmet penalty at Karachi in 1994/95\n\nHenry Olonga got a seven from a defensive prod including helmet penalty at Bloemfontein 1999/00. The other runs were overthrows run after the ball hit the helmet.\n\nDaniel Vettori got a single plus helmet penalty, The Oval 1999.\n\nShane Watson similar at Brisbane in 2010, but the penalty went to extras.\n\nAlso,\n\nA single to Hashim Amla plus 5 penalties when Sehwag kicked a ball over the boundary, Kolkata 2010.\n\nsix wides by Shakib al Hasan Chittagong 2014\n\n********\n\nAustralia scored only 9 runs in a batting powerplay in the recent series against Pakistan. It is close to the record, for a powerplay starting after over 20, for a side batting first. I found one case of 7 runs by Bangladesh against New Zealand in 2007. Overs 30 to 34.\n\nhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/nzvbdesh/engine/match/300426.html?innings=1;view=commentary\n\nThis appears to be one of the first games to include a 'batting' powerplay. In earlier games, selected powerplays were selected by the fielding side and were almost always used in the first 25 overs.\n\nFor a side batting second there were just 6 runs by South Africa against Sri Lanka last year\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/549/549721.html\n\nOne difficulty in comparison is that powerplay rules have changed arbitrarily, from year to year. The current requirement for powerplay before over 40 reduces the scoring compared to the days when one was almost always taken in the last few overs. Overall, powerplays are less important than most commentators assume.\n\n3 October 2014\n\nThe Extreme Overs\n\nI have been collating all examples of 20 or more runs in an over (Tests) that I can find. The cases found in my database are augmented by some others listed in Test Cricket Lists (Dawson and Wat). This source has a few from Tests not covered by my database. There are probably other unidentified cases (TCL itself misses about 30 cases that I found within the database) but I suspect that well over 90% of actual cases are by now listed.\n\nThere are now more than 150 known cases (if sundries are included), 26 of them from eight-ball overs. About half the cases are from this century; not surprisingly, it has become more common in the modern era of smaller grounds and superbats, assisted also by the change in law that added extras runs for hits off no balls. Of the 152, 104 involve one batsman scoring 20 runs or more; in the others, runs were more evenly shared between the batting partners. There are no cases of two different batsmen both scoring ten or more runs in an over.\n\nThere is opportunity for a few stats. The leading batsman in the list is Adam Gilchrist with eight cases. In six of those, Gilchrist personally contributed 20 or more. This places him well above others. Botham and Lara each have five cases; Lara personally contributed 20 three times, Botham two. Shahid Afridi has three four and Nathan Astle three such overs. In Astles case, all three came in the same famous innings of 222 in 2002 (in one of the three overs Astle was assisted by Chris Cairns).\n\nFor bowlers, Matthew Hoggard suffered four times. Jeff Thomson also conceded 20 or more in an over four times, but note that two of these were eight-ball overs.\n\n********\n\nI have posted an article I wrote for the new Australian cricket journal Between Wickets here. It is entitled The Statistician as Collector and describes some of the efforts I have undertaken to amass my database, and some of the more interesting oddities I found. The article has been added to my Longer Articles register.\n\nLets hope this journal gets going. There are far too few published outlets for good cricket writing any more.\n\n********\n\nI mentioned a while back that my father (more than 40 years ago) was an umpire for the M.C.C.C., that is the Mexico City Cricket Club, formed mostly of expat Brits. Here is a photo from 1969 of the scene during a match, from Dads collection. Rather idyllic I would say, rather as cricket is supposed to be. My mother and younger sister are in the photo, showing their customary level of interest in the game. The location would be hard to guess, to put it mildly. There are Australian gum trees in the background, which are common in that part of Mexico.\n\n********\n\nA question was asked about most consecutive fours in ODIs and T20i.\n\nSehwag hit seven 4s in a row, spread across 4 overs (overs 8-11), against New Zealand in 2001, in Colombo.\n\nGilchrist hit six 4s in a row against England in 2003. One of them appears to be all run.\n\nAfridi once hit 4,4,6,4,4,4,wide,4,4 against Bangladesh in 2010.\n\nIn T20i I can only find one, and it would be impossible to guess. SO Tikolo hit six 4s off consecutive (legal) balls against Canada in a WT20 qualifier in 2013. However, there were two wides in the sequence.\n\n4 September 2014\n\nThe Elusive First Wicket Record\n\nSome interesting correspondence from Shahzad has identified some subtle errors in an official score that has some bearing on a record recently in the news.\n\nThe record is most runs conceded before first Test wicket. Pankaj Singh of India recently made a strong if undesired run at this record, a run that ended when he dismissed Joe Root at Old Trafford. Singh had conceded 274 up to that point, a total exceeded only by RGCE Wijesuriya.\n\nThe exact number conceded by Wijesuriya in 1985 has been hard to pin down. I had made an estimate of 283 or 284 before Shahzad eventually came up with an exact number of 285, one that didnt quite fit in with my estimate or the official score. However, Shahzad informed me that Wijesuriyas dismissal of Abdul Qadir was the ninth wicket of the innings, not the eighth, and occurred on a score of 290 not 288. The official version needs to be modified. My estimate had been based on that official version and newspaper reports that showed that the last five runs of the innings were all scored off Ratnayake by Wasim Akram.\n\nShahzad also tells me that Wijesuriya also bowled 3.1 not 3.4 overs in the second innings, which was completed in 16.1 not 16.4 overs.\n\nSo an improved list can now be produced .\n\nMost Runs before First wicket in Tests\n\nRuns\n\nBalls\n\nRGCE Wijesuriya\n\n285\n\n561\n\nPankaj Singh\n\n274\n\n418\n\nJC Alabaster\n\n273\n\n513\n\nJJ Warr\n\n265\n\n551\n\nDB Pithey\n\n252-257\n\n~490\n\nAG Kripal Singh\n\n235\n\n651\n\nDR Tuffey\n\n232\n\n303\n\nAnwar Hossain Monir conceded 307 runs in Tests without taking a wicket (348 balls).\n\nUnknown: Rusi Surti conceded perhaps 250-260 runs before his first wicket. Conceivably, up to 275 runs (very unlikely). Probably >400 balls.\n\n********\n\nA New Head-to-Head scoring record: Namitha and others have alerted me to a new leader in the Player v Player scoring stakes. Kumar Sangakkara has now scored 531 runs (by my count) off the bowling of Saeed Ajmal, taking over from Gooch v Kapil (517) and Sutcliffe v Grimmett (515±). The revised list is here. Ajmal has dismissed Sanga only four times, for an average of 132.8. It is a characteristic of the very best modern batsmen that they score freely off spin bowlers. Sanga averages 70 off spin bowling and 52 off pace. Even so, his scoring off Ajmal is extraordinary given that Ajmal is the best spinner going around today. Sangakkaras record appears to be worse off part-time spinners than major spinners, although Shane Warne also kept him in check (av 31.8).\n\n********\n\nMOST Fives in Tests: Strictly speaking, in Tests it is ten by 19th-century Australian George Bonnor, but they were all \"six-hits\" that only counted five in those days. Otherwise, the highest is nine by Geoff Boycott and Steve Waugh. While there are gaps in the data, it is complete for these two, and there are no other likely candidates to exceed them.\n\nThe only known case of three 5s in a match is by Bruce Laird at Adelaide in 1980. All were 1+4 overthrows.\n\nVirender Sehwag (8586 runs) never hit a five in a Test match.\n\n********\n\nProgressive career wickets records\n\n1877\n\nA Shaw\n\n8\n\n1877\n\nTK Kendall\n\n14\n\n1879\n\nFR Spofforth\n\n17\n\n1882\n\nGE Palmer\n\n28\n\n1882\n\nFR Spofforth\n\n32\n\n1883\n\nGE Palmer\n\n43\n\n1884\n\nFR Spofforth\n\n56\n\n1884\n\nGE Palmer\n\n69\n\n1887\n\nFR Spofforth\n\n94\n\n1895\n\nJ Briggs\n\n96\n\n1895\n\nCTB Turner\n\n101\n\n1895\n\nJ Briggs\n\n103\n\n1896\n\nGA Lohmann\n\n112\n\n1899\n\nJ Briggs\n\n118\n\n1904\n\nH Trumble\n\n141\n\n1914\n\nSF Barnes\n\n189\n\n1936\n\nCV Grimmett\n\n216\n\n1955\n\nAV Bedser\n\n236\n\n1963\n\nJB Statham\n\n242\n\n1965\n\nFS Trueman\n\n307\n\n1976\n\nLR Gibbs\n\n309\n\n1984\n\nDK Lillee\n\n355\n\n1987\n\nIT Botham\n\n373\n\n1990\n\nRJ Hadlee\n\n431\n\n1994\n\nN Kapil Dev\n\n434\n\n2001\n\nCA Walsh\n\n519\n\n2004\n\nM Muralitharan\n\n532\n\n2007\n\nSK Warne\n\n708\n\n2010\n\nM Muralitharan\n\n800\n\n14 July 2014\n\nBusy Days\n\nApologies for being off-air for a while. My father passed away in Sydney and so it has been a busy time for our family. Anyway, here are a few comments about Dad that touch on cricket statistics\n\nMy father Alan, who was a first-grade umpire in Sydney from 1961 to 1977, took me to a Test match on a visit to Melbourne when I was four year old. It was the day that there were over 90,800 people there (West Indies, 1961). So I contributed to a Test match world record. Sadly, I cannot actually remember the event, but it must have had a lasting impact on me. Unfortunately I was not there when the record was broken last Boxing Day, although I did go the next day. I wonder how many people went to both. I still consider these to be the records for crowds at cricket match, and I do not regard the rough estimates for certain matches in Calcutta, which supposedly exceed these, to be reliable.\n\nDad was well-known enough as an umpire to be on a first-name basis with Bob Simpson, who gave us a lift home one day from an (away) match. I was very impressed but tongue-tied. Simpson was captain of Western Suburbs club  Pratten Park was walking distance from our home  and had retired, far too early, from the Australian captaincy just a short time before. He was arguably still the best batsman in Australia, and he spent a number of years terrorising club-level bowlers before being recalled to the Australian captaincy at the age of 40 (with great success).\n\nOur family later lived in Mexico for a while, where Dad was official umpire for the M.C.C.C., that is the Mexico City Cricket Club, formed mostly of expat Brits. Highlight of that time, for me, was the visit of the 1970 England World Cup football team, having a day off. They played a one-day match against the MCCC, and absolutely thrashed them, as you might expect from a group exceptional athletes. I managed to procure the autographs of most of them on a postcard, which I now have framed (famous names: the Charlton brothers, Bobby Moore, Gordon Banks, etc etc, even Alf Ramsay)\n\nDad worked for Qantas, and later took part (as umpire) in tours of club teams to India and elsewhere. Many years ago he told us he was umpiring a match in Malaysia, of all places, when Garry Sobers was out first ball, but later took five wickets in five balls (it was a minor game). I recall Dad producing a press clipping, from Malaysia, of the match.\n\nThis last recollection has puzzled me, but to my amazement Cricket Archive actually has the match online here. It confirms everything Dad told me. There is also a match report here. The puzzle is the date: 1964 was before I thought Dad was touring as an umpire, so that is a surprise.\n\nPerhaps his strangest umpiring experience was in Sydney when both teams refused to play during a significant partial solar eclipse in 1976, hiding in the dressing room and refusing to come out for fear of the 'radiation'. Dad and the other umpire just waited at the wicket for them to come out again. Simpson was involved again. The teams were fined and the match deleted from career records, including a century from Simpson himself. It was the only match where the teams behaved like this: I myself was playing nearby, in a very minor league, and it never occurred to us to stop playing during the eclipse. I have an odd memory of my shadow splitting into two.\n\nUPDATE: many thanks to those who sent messages of condolence. It is actually very touching to receive such messages from people I have never met.\n\n********\n\nSpeaking of busy days, I have made a list of the most balls faced by an individual batsman in a day of Test cricket. It is one of those records that is pretty much frozen, because the decline in over rates makes the facing of more than 375 balls in a day near impossible now.\n\nMost Balls Faced in a Days Play, where known.\n\nBalls faced\n\nBatsman\n\nDay\n\nRuns\n\nFinal Score\n\n423\n\nAC Bannerman\n\n3\n\nAus v Eng, Sydney (SCG) 1891/92\n\n67\n\n91\n\n421\n\nDG Bradman\n\n2\n\nAus v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1934\n\n271\n\n304\n\n420\n\nDG Bradman\n\n1\n\nAus v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1930\n\n309\n\n334\n\n417\n\nC Washbrook\n\n4\n\nEng v WI, Lord's 1950\n\n114\n\n114\n\n414\n\nB Mitchell\n\n4\n\nSAf v Eng, The Oval 1947\n\n188\n\n189\n\n410\n\nEAB Rowan\n\n1\n\nSAf v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1951\n\n160\n\n236\n\n405\n\nMC Cowdrey\n\n4\n\nEng v WI, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1957\n\n78\n\n154\n\n401\n\nH Sutcliffe\n\n3\n\nEng v Aus, The Oval 1926\n\n141\n\n161\n\n396\n\nL Hutton\n\n1\n\nEng v Aus, The Oval 1938\n\n160\n\n364\n\n395\n\nW Bardsley\n\n1\n\nAus v Eng, Lord's 1926\n\n173\n\n193\n\n395\n\nWM Woodfull\n\n2\n\nAus v Eng, Lord's 1930\n\n155\n\n155\n\n390\n\nCP Mead\n\n1\n\nEng v SAf, Durban (Kingsmead) 1922/23\n\n128\n\n181\n\n390\n\nPBH May\n\n4\n\nEng v WI, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1957\n\n172\n\n285*\n\n385\n\nWR Hammond\n\n3\n\nEng v Aus, Sydney (SCG) 1928/29\n\n168\n\n251\n\n381\n\nRB Simpson\n\n2\n\nAus v Eng, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1964\n\n156\n\n311\n\n376\n\nWH Ponsford\n\n2\n\nAus v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1934\n\n159\n\n181\n\nWoodfulls is the only innings to be completely contained in the days play. Nazar Mohammad batted through a day of 750 balls in 1952, scoring just 66 runs, but his share of the strike is unknown. Although the list above may not be complete, there are not many other candidates from the missing matches.\n\n********\n\nA few more notes on the position of 12th man: There is no official position of 12th man; there are many hundreds of cases of teams not having a recognised 12th man. Touring teams in particular often never name one, simply using squad members as substitutes when required. There are also many cases of a 12th man being identified but not being present at the match; he is released to play elsewhere and substitute duties given to local club cricketers.\n\nIn most recent Tests it is not possible to identify the 12th men. One team that still names its 12th men is Australia.\n\nNathan Hauritz and Ken Archer both made six appearances as 12th man before their respective Test debuts.\n\nI have identified about 1150 different cricketers who have been named as 12th man in Tests up to 2011. Of these, about 300 were 12th man before later going on to play Test cricket. Another 150 approx never played Tests in a first XI.\n\nExact numbers would depend on the definition of 12th man. Simply acting as substitute fieldsman should not count. If a team names a squad of 12 before a match, I regard the one missing out as 12th man even if he plays no part in proceedings.\n\n********\n\nAdding 100 runs after retiring hurt\n\nRuns added\n\nRH score\n\nFinal\n\nDCS Compton\n\n141\n\n4\n\n145*\n\nEng v Aus, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1948\n\nPLJ Dujon\n\n104\n\n35\n\n139\n\nWI v Aus, Perth (WACA) 1984/85\n\nSM Gavaskar\n\n127\n\n39\n\n166*\n\nInd v Aus, Adelaide Oval 1985/86\n\nM Azharuddin\n\n103\n\n6\n\n109\n\nInd v Saf, Kolkata 1996/97\n\n********\n\nI have upgraded the Unusual Records section to allow fast linking to a record directly from the Table of Contents. Try it.\n\n29 May 2014\n\nDropped Catches: 2014 Report\n\nIn August last year I described how there had been a quantum jump (or should I say quantum fall) in the rate of dropped catches in 2012 compared to earlier years. Over the previous decade, the rate of dropped chances had hovered in the range 25-27%, but dropped suddenly to 23.5% for calendar year 2012.\n\nI have now updated the survey for 2013 and up to the present, and the rate, while still remaining low, has bounced back a little to 25.0%. The increase is partly down to Bangladesh returning to larger numbers of Tests  they played very few in 2012  and more Tests played by Bangladesh drives up the overall rate. Though Bangladesh has improved, recording a drop rate of 36% in the past 15 months, as against a disastrous 45% back in 2011, they are still dead last.\n\nEven so, there is still an underlying improvement going on. Australia recorded a drop rate of 18.7%, the lowest annual figure by one team seen since the surveys started in 2001. New Zealand also came in under 20%, a rare achievement. Both teams could have been beaten by South Africa: however, South Africa have had a poor 2014, as reflected in their results in the series against Australia, where South Africa dropped 13 catches and took only 26, whereas Australia dropped 6 and took 35. This drove South Africas 2013/14 rate up to 21%.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Australias missed chances were described as difficult or tough in the available texts, as opposed to one-third of Bangladeshs chances.\n\nThe team with the biggest improvement is West Indies. From 2001 to 2009, West Indies drop rate was consistently above 30%. This fell to 27% in 2010-2011, and now is at a world-class 22%. Sri Lanka has gone in the other direction: percentage drop rates in the mid 20s about 10 years ago have ballooned out to 35% in the past couple of years. India, too, has had its worst year since the surveys began: 32.8%.\n\nI noticed in the stats that Chris Rogers has yet to drop a catch in Test cricket, while his partner David Warner has taken the last 20 chances that have come to him, and has dropped only two chances (one of them debatable) out of 26 in his career so far.\n\nThere is a new leader in the all-time individual list  all-time meaning since 2001. MS Dhoni has now missed 61 chances (dropped or missed stumpings), passing Adam Gilchrist and Rahul Dravid, who recorded 55 each since I have been doing surveys. In Dhonis defence, he does have to do a lot of keeping to spinners; keeping to spinners is the true Test of a wicket-keeper. There is nevertheless a gap between Dhoni (19% missed chances) and Gilchrist (14%). Most keepers are between these two figures, although Mark Boucher, at 10%, represents a gold standard.\n\nHere are the rates for 2013+2014 for each country.\n\n% Missed Chances by Country 2013 and 2014  Test Matches\n\nAustralia\n\n18.7%\n\nNew Zealand\n\n19.8%\n\nSouth Africa\n\n21.1%\n\nWest Indies\n\n22.1%\n\nEngland\n\n24.9%\n\nZimbabwe\n\n25.4%\n\nPakistan\n\n28.1%\n\nIndia\n\n32.8%\n\nSri Lanka\n\n35.6%\n\nBangladesh\n\n36.0%\n\nThe usual caveats regarding dropped chance statistics should be recognised. Some chances will always be a matter of opinion as to whether they should be included, and text searches for cases are bound to miss some (probably not many now). I tend to take a harsh view of chances for inclusion; incidents described as half-chances or technical chances are included, as are incident where chance pass between keeper and slips or between fielders who react poorly. Even so, I am of the opinion that most chances are clear-cut, and the statistics provide useful comparisons.\n\n********\n\nAs an addendum to the recent list of bowlers head-tohead hat-tricks, here is a list of bowlers who have dismissed a batsman twice in a Test, with the only balls he bowled to that batsman.\n\nBowlers Dismissing a Batsman Twice in a Match with only Two Balls\n\nBat\n\nBowl\n\nWH Ashley\n\nJ Briggs\n\nSA v Eng , Cape Town 1889\n\nJT Willoughby*\n\nGA Lohmann\n\nSA v Eng, Port Elizabeth 1895/96\n\nTA Ward*\n\nTJ Matthews\n\nSA v Aus, Manchester 1912\n\nEG Hayes*\n\nJH Sinclair\n\nSA v Eng, Cape Town 1905/06\n\nC Wesley*\n\nJB Statham\n\nEng v SA, Nottingham 1960\n\nJA Snow\n\nKD Boyce\n\nWI v Eng, The Oval 1973\n\nCM Old\n\nDK Lillee\n\nEng v Aus, Melbourne (MCG) 1976/77\n\nGB Troup*\n\nRJ Shastri\n\nNZ v INd, wellington 1980/81\n\nMS Atapattu\n\nGRJ Matthews\n\nAus v SL, Colombo2 (SSC) 1992\n\nAta-ur-Rehman\n\nDH Brain\n\nZim v Pak, Rawalpindi (Cricket Stadium) 1993/94\n\nMohammad Wasim\n\nDW Fleming\n\nAus v Pak, Rawalpindi (Cricket Stadium) 1998/99\n\nBKV Prasad\n\nShoaib Akhtar\n\nPak v Ind, Kolkata 1998/99\n\nDPMD Jayawardene\n\nWasim Akram\n\nSL v Pak, Dhaka 1998/99\n\nBC Lara\n\nSE Bond\n\nWI v NZ, Auckland 2005/06\n\nJaved Omar*\n\nZ Khan\n\nInd v Ban, Dhaka (Mirpur) 2007\n\nThese are the only balls the bowler bowled to that batsman in the matches in question.\n\nMatthews bowled Atapattu with the only two balls he bowled to him in Test cricket.\n\n*King Pair.\n\n********\n\nRun Out for 99 going for a second or third run.\n\nMike Atherton was run out for 99 going for a third run at Lord's in 1993.

Sinclair batted on to make 214 on debut.\n\n********\n\n22 May 2014\n\nA New Cricket Stat: The Head-to-Head Hat-trick\n\nHeres one that can only be divined from ball-by-ball records: cases of a bowler dismissing the same batsman with three consecutive balls that he bowled to him, a head-to-head hat-trick. Of necessity, this has to span multiple matches, and in some cases, multiple years. Both batsman and bowler could have been (and probably were) involved in other dismissals, involving different opponents, in the meantime. It is also possible for other matches involving both players to interpose, if the bowler did not bowl to that batsman in those matches. For example, Chris Old and Bishen Bedi both played at Edgbaston in 1974, after the Lords Test; both batted and bowled, but Old did not bowl to Bedi in that match.\n\nThere are likely to be other cases, not covered by the bbb database. Such cases would be near-impossible to ferret out and confirm. I was surprised to find no pre-War cases.\n\nBowlers Dismissing the same batsman with three consecutive balls in Tests\n\nNote: this means that the bowler did not bowl a single ball to that batsman in between the dismissals.\n\nBowler\n\nBatsman\n\nRR Lindwall\n\nAV Bedser (11)\n\nAus v Eng, Melbourne (MCG) 1950/51\n\nRR Lindwall\n\nAV Bedser (2)\n\nEng v Aus, Nottingham (Trent Bridge) 1953\n\nRR Lindwall\n\nAV Bedser (1)\n\nEng v Aus, Lord's 1953\n\nCM Old\n\nBS Bedi (0)\n\nEng v Ind, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1974\n\nCM Old\n\nBS Bedi (0)\n\nEng v Ind, Lord's 1974\n\nCM Old\n\nBS Bedi (0)\n\nInd v Eng, Delhi (FSK) 1976/77\n\nVA Holder*\n\nJR Thomson (6)\n\nAus v WI, Adelaide Oval 1975/76\n\nVA Holder*\n\nJR Thomson (0)\n\nAus v WI, Melbourne (MCG) 1975/76\n\nVA Holder*\n\nJR Thomson (0)\n\nWI v Aus, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad 1978\n\nDK Lillee*\n\nJ Garner (7)\n\nAus v WI, Melbourne (MCG) 1981/82\n\nDK Lillee*\n\nJ Garner (0)\n\nAus v WI, Melbourne (MCG) 1981/82\n\nDK Lillee*\n\nJ Garner (1)\n\nAus v WI, Sydney (SCG) 1981/82\n\nJ Garner*\n\nKJ Hughes (4)\n\nAus v WI, Brisbane ('Gabba') 1984/85\n\nJ Garner*\n\nKJ Hughes (0)\n\nAus v WI, Adelaide Oval 1984/85\n\nJ Garner*\n\nKJ Hughes (0)\n\nAus v WI, Melbourne (MCG) 1984/85\n\nWaqar Younis\n\nHH Streak (14)\n\nPak v Zim, Rawalpindi (Cricket Stadium) 1993/94\n\nWaqar Younis\n\nHH Streak (1)\n\nPak v Zim, Rawalpindi (Cricket Stadium) 1993/94\n\nWaqar Younis\n\nHH Streak (1)\n\nPak v Zim, Lahore (Gaddafi) 1993/94\n\nPAJ DeFreitas\n\nKR Rutherford (37)\n\nEng v NZ, Lord's 1994\n\nPAJ DeFreitas\n\nKR Rutherford (0)\n\nEng v NZ, Lord's 1994\n\nPAJ DeFreitas\n\nKR Rutherford (7)\n\nEng v NZ, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1994\n\nJ Srinath\n\nPR Adams (1)\n\nInd v Saf, Ahmedabad (Gujarat) 1996/97\n\nJ Srinath\n\nPR Adams (0)\n\nInd v Saf, Ahmedabad (Gujarat) 1996/97\n\nJ Srinath\n\nPR Adams (1)\n\nInd v Saf, Kanpur 1996/97\n\nSM Pollock\n\nSK Warne (1)\n\nAus v Saf, Melbourne (MCG) 1997/98\n\nSM Pollock\n\nSK Warne (12)\n\nAus v Saf, Sydney (SCG) 1997/98\n\nSM Pollock\n\nSK Warne (0)\n\nAus v Saf, Adelaide Oval 1997/98\n\nWasim Akram\n\nM Jayawardene (50)\n\nPak v SL, Lahore (Gaddafi) 1998/99\n\nWasim Akram\n\nM Jayawardene (0)\n\nPak v SL, Dhaka 1998/99\n\nWasim Akram\n\nM Jayawardene (1)\n\nPak v SL, Dhaka 1998/99\n\nAR Caddick\n\nCEL Ambrose (3)\n\nEng v WI, Manchester (Old Trafford) 2000\n\nAR Caddick\n\nCEL Ambrose (0)\n\nEng v WI, Leeds (Headingley) 2000\n\nAR Caddick\n\nCEL Ambrose (0)\n\nEng v WI, The Oval 2000\n\nSJ Harmison*\n\nMashrafe Mortaza (0)\n\nEng v Ban, Lord's 2005\n\nSJ Harmison*\n\nMashrafe Mortaza (0)\n\nEng v Ban, Lord's 2005\n\nSJ Harmison*\n\nMashrafe Mortaza (1)\n\nEng v Ban, Chester-le-Street 2005\n\n*last three balls bowled by the bowler to that batsman in Tests\n\nSrinath/Adams came from the 3rd, 4th and 5th balls Srinath bowled to Adams in Test matches; Pollock/Warne came from the 5th, 6th and 7th balls Pollock bowled to Warne.

Perhaps the closest was Herschelle Gibbs who scored 211* (rain-affected) at Christchurch in 1999 and was not out at the end of the day on the first four days. He would have batted on day 5 had not Cronje declared overnight.\n\nHere is a list of individual innings that spanned four playing days of a Test match: 13 cases.

Steve Smith dismissed Tendulkar with the only ball he ever bowled to him in international cricket. Equally extraordinary is Pedro Collins, who dismissed Tendulkar with the first TWO balls he bowled to him in Tests, in two different matches.\n\nPeter Taylor and Peter McIntyre got Tendulkar out without ever conceding a run to him.\n\n8 May 2014\n\nNew Light on the Slowest Hundreds\n\nIn 2012 (17 October) I posted a list of the longest Test innings based on the number of overs batted. This, I think, is an excellent way to compare innings in the absence of complete balls faced figures, since it is easier to reliably calculate or estimate elapsed overs than balls faced by individuals. In that spirit, I have put together a list of the slowest centuries, in overs elapsed for the first 100 runs.\n\nSlowest to reach 100, in overs batted\n\nOvers batted\n\nBalls faced\n\n174\n\nNazar Mohammad\n\nPak v Ind, Lucknow (University) 1952/53\n\n520(est)\n\n166\n\nMC Cowdrey\n\nEng v WI, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1957\n\n535\n\n157\n\nDJ McGlew\n\nSaf v Aus, Durban (Kingsmead) 1957/58\n\n485\n\n152\n\nAJ Watkins\n\nEng v Ind, Delhi (FSK) 1951/52\n\n480\n\n151\n\nHanif Mohammad\n\nPak v Eng, Dhaka 1961/62\n\n448\n\n150(est)\n\nJW Guy\n\nNZ v Ind, Hyderabad (Ind - LBSS) 1955/56\n\n448(est)\n\n143(est)\n\nHanif Mohammad\n\nPak v Ind, Bahwalpur 1954/55\n\n427(est)\n\n143\n\nPE Richardson\n\nEng v SAf, Johannesburg (New Wanderers) 1956/57\n\n440\n\n139\n\nMudassar Nazar\n\nPak v Eng, Lahore (Gaddafi) 1977/78\n\n419\n\nEight-ball overs converted\n\nThis establishes Nazars innings as the slowest Test century, in terms of the amount of cricket that had to be played for him to reach 100. Cowdrey probably faced more balls, but he faced an unusually high amount of the strike, and so comes in at a lower over count than Nazar. The innings by Nazars son, Mudassar, only ranks ninth in this list, but is still given as the slowest Test century in some other lists (which can only be described as seriously incomplete).\n\n********\n\nMost runs in the first over of a Test innings. These figures are from the database, which covers only about 80% of Tests, so there could be others. The innings number is at the end of each line. The Gough and Sohag overs contained extras.

When Aubrey Faulkner made 122* against Australia at Old Trafford in 1912, he was told to keep the pads on to open when South Africa followed on, only to make a second-innings duck. That was on the same day that TJ Matthews took his two famous hat-tricks.\n\n********\n\nA note on the covering of wickets in Australia.\n\nRS Whitington wrote that Tests in Australia used fully covered wickets from 1947/48 (v India) onwards. I dont think this is correct. Photos and articles in newspapers from that season suggest that only the ends of the pitches were covered, to protect bowlers run ups once play had commenced. The outcomes of Tests in that season, and for a few years thereafter, also suggest that sticky wickets remained a problem up to 1951/52, and the playing surface would have to be uncovered for this to happen regularly. Pitches were fully covered in 1952/53 (v South Africa), and I believe that this was the first such season.* In England, where wet wickets did not often turn sticky, full covering of wickets was not introduced until 1979.\n\nWhitington also said that new balls were available after 40 (eight-ball) overs in 1947/48. However, the earliest new balls recorded in the scores from that season were after the 41st over (several times). 41 overs is closer to the English standard of the time of 55 six-ball overs. The option of 200 runs may also have applied. In the previous season of the Ashes series of 1946/47, the old new ball rule of 200 runs seems to have still applied.\n\n*UPDATE: Alastair Lynch pointed me to references that show covered pitches being used throughout the 1951/52 series v West Indies. I think I had heard that before, and the references confirm it to be true, but I had trouble understanding the Adelaide Test of that season, where 22 wickets fell on the first day on a wet, sometimes unplayable pitch, with one end worse than the other. How could that happen with a covered pitch? There was also the fall of 19 wickets on the first day of the final Sydney Test. Perhaps the techniques of covering pitches in these early days were poorly developed, and mistakes occurred. In the Adelaide case, the pitch covering was said to have exacerbated the problems by preventing drying before play started.\n\nPeter Lyons subsequently emailed to say that Ray Robinson, in the Cricketer Spring Annual of 1952, wrote that the wicket covering in 1951/52 was inadequate and that the agreement to cover wickets was regretted by the West Indians. Evidently, the standards of the covers improved in 1952/53.\n\nThe Adelaide Test, incidentally, was the Test where Australian captain Lindsay Hassett pulled out through injury, only to be made 12th man, Sid Barnes was selected and then unselected for reasons other than cricket, leading to a law suit, and Phil Ridings was selected but then somehow ended up not playing. Ridings never did play Test cricket, although he was elevated to (long-serving) Australian selector only 12 months later.\n\n*********\n\nUndertaking the funeral of a team mate. The funeral of Victor Trumper in 1915 was undertaken by the W. Carter company. Ray Webster tells me that Hanson 'Sammy' Carter (Australian wicketkeeper at the time) indeed did work as an undertaker in the family business, founded by his father Walter. Walter had been a carpenter who was injured at work and was unable to continue his career, and started another business.\n\nHanson was therefore involved in undertaking the funeral of a Test match team mate, presumably a unique situation for an active Test cricketer.\n\n********\n\nAt Multan in 1980/81, West Indies lost 3 wickets for one run in a single session of play. Only 10 minutes play was possible after tea on the third day, the West Indies going from 84/2 to 85/5. Rain intervened, and limited play to 10 more overs on the final two days.\n\n15 April 2014\n\nA Scoring Pioneer\n\nSreeram and others have been piecing together information on early forms of advanced scoring techniques. This was brought on by the puzzle mentioned last year (14 May) of occasional reports of balls faced in Australian cricket prior to 1907, including Alec Bannermans epic 91 off 612 balls in 1892 (reported in The Argus and some other papers). All the instances before 1907 were at the SCG. It now appears that the scorer responsible in all cases was one J.G. Jackscohn.\n\nJackscohn (note spelling) was a scorer at the SCG from 1887 to 1895, and then again from 1905 (he lived in northern NSW in between). Ray Webster (in Story of a Cricket Country) notes that he even received a medal from Lord Sheffield for his scoring in 1891/92(!) His name is spelled Jackson in some early references.\n\nMy interpretation of the reports is that Jackscohn kept a separate tabular sheet when scoring, recording balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler in separate boxes. These appear to be tables (mentioned in a 1906 article) rather than linear sheets. This would explain how Wisden got that isolated reference to the balls faced by Bannerman specifically off Attewell in his 91, but did not mention balls faced for the whole innings. While it is possible to determine how many balls were faced off each bowler from linear sheets, it is not especially easy; counting them up would have to be done carefully. A tabular format would make it simple.\n\nJackscohn died in 1931 aged 84. There is an obituary in The Referee that I presume Ray used in his account.\n\nSreeram has uncovered a number of references to Jackscohns work in the Trove database, including one that says he was sole scorer for that Sydney Test in 1891/92. Another is that 1906 note on Jackscohns methods. It would be a wonderful thing if some of these old Tables could be found.\n\nBill Fergie Ferguson, the instigator of systematic linear scoring, would almost certainly have encountered Jackscohn and his methods at some stage. I dont think their methods were the same, but Fergie may well have been inspired to develop his system by Jackscohns work.\n\nThe mystery remains of the source for a few balls faced figures (and pioneering wagon wheels) in a Melbourne Test of 1907/08. See 27 Dec 2012.\n\nMost runs off the same ball:\n\nAt Hamilton in 1998/99, Saurav Ganguly made five attempts to bowl the third ball of his fifth over, the first four being no balls. Craig McMillan hit the first two for four, and also hit a single off the fifth delivery. In all, 13 runs accrued off this ball, McMillan scoring nine. The over went 0,4n,4n,n,n,1,1,0,4. This took place shortly after the one-run penalty for a no ball was extended to include no balls that were scored from.\n\nUnder this system, Joel Garner would have conceded 14 runs from one ball at the MCG in 1984/85. (2n,n,n,n,n,3n,3: see entry for 12 Dec 2011)\n\nIn the run torrent that was the ODI at Joburg in 2005 (872 runs in 100 overs), Roger Telemachus conceded 20 runs while trying to bowl the first ball of the 48th over. The sequence of five deliveries was 4n, 1n, 4n, 6n, 2 (faced by Ponting and Symonds). The whole over cost 28.\n\nThe most on record for T20 internationals is 15 runs (6n, 1n, 6) bowled by Izatullah Dawlatzai of Afghanistan against England in the World T20 in 2012. The over cost 32 runs even though it included a wicket.\n\n********\n\nI wonder if anyone with an identical twin played Test cricket before Lisle Nagel, who played one Test in the 1930s. His brother Vernon played for Victoria. They supposedly once swapped places undetected during a club match.\n\nI understand that Rose and Liz Signal are identical twins (not sure); they played together for New Zealand Women in a couple of Women's Tests in 1984.\n\nIsobel and Cecelia Joyce play ODIs for Ireland Women's team, although they have only been doing this since 2011.\n\n******\n\nSpeaking of twins, Andrew Symonds once ran out Hamish and James Marshall in the same ODI, at Auckland in 2005. It turns out there was a precedent: Saqlain Mushtaq and the Waugh twins, SCG in 2000.\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/.../Scorecards/69/69222.html\n\nI can find only one case of brothers being run out in the same Test match, GB Studd and CT Studd in 1883 (SCG). Different fielders were involved.\n\nIan and Greg Chappell were both run out by Viv Richards in the first World Cup Final in 1975.\n\nMark was run out when running for injured #11 Craig McDermott, with Steve left on 99 not out at Perth 1994/95.\n\n21 March 2014\n\nWhats a Duckworth Lewis?\n\nHeres a short analysis of historical Duckworth/Lewis results in ODIs. I havent said much on this subject in the past, but Arnold DSouza reminded me that there is a brief entry in my blog from 23 Jan 2005, and again in 2006. I think that the conclusion from my early reading was that the system made a lot of sense, but it needed accuracy in the detail if it was to be fair. A lot of that detail is not publicly available, although I did once get hold of an early list of ODI tables as they stood about 10 years ago. The system has been modified multiple times since then. If readers know of accessible sources for specifics of modern ODI D/L tables, I would be interested.\n\nAnyway, here is an historical summary of D/L results, according to whether the winner batted first or second. The system came in to full use in ODIs only in 2000. For whatever reason, it was applied to only a few matches in that year.\n\nBat 1st Win\n\nBat 2nd Win\n\nto 1999\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2000-02\n\n14\n\n4\n\n2003-04\n\n11\n\n5\n\n2005-06\n\n0\n\n13\n\n2007-08\n\n12\n\n20\n\n2009-10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n2011-12\n\n5\n\n21\n\n2013-14\n\n8\n\n7\n\nAs I noted in my posts years ago, there was quite a severe imbalance in favour of teams batting first for the first few years after the widespread adoption of D/L. Between 2000 and 2004, D/L awarded the match to the team batting first 25 times to 9 times for the team batting second. Based on binomial theorem and a theoretical even probability, the chance of such a skewed distribution in 34 trials is well under 1 per cent.\n\n[Going on memory here, I did find some oddities with the tables. For example, the tables seemed to imply an average last wicket partnership of 14, when the real average is 9.]\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, D/L changed the system in 2004 and incorporated more sophisticated computer input. Was this behind the extraordinary reversal in 2005-2006? (At one point, fourteen consecutive D/L matches went to the team batting second, and 26 out of 32. Try doing that tossing a coin: we are in thousand-to-one territory here). The fluctuations in fortunes since then also look strange. The system still does favour teams batting second, although less strongly than in 2005-07. It remains possible that teams batting second can anticipate impending D/L intervention, and adjust tactics before D/L begins to be applied, so gaining an advantage. If rain is possible, teams batting second may keep an eye on the par score, and try to keep ahead of it.\n\n********\n\nWhen six was the new five\n\nGoing through some old reports I noticed something about the awarding of sixers. I had thought that the awarding of six runs for all hits over the boundary was finally instituted in 1910; prior to that it could be four, five or six runs, rather depending on umpire's whim.\n\nHowever, I have found that in all Tests in Australia and South Africa from 1905 onwards (15 Tests up to 1910), all known hits over the boundary scored six runs. Only in England did this not apply; the few known hits in 1907 apparently scored four runs, as had most in 1905, but things seemed to be changing. In 1909, all known hits scored six, bar one by Trumper at the Oval that scored five, and a four to Tibby Cotter.\n\nThe 1910 change in the Laws seems to be largely recognition of a fait accompli.\n\nIncidentally, I found that Warwick Armstrong, in his 133 at the MCG in 1907/08, hit two consecutive balls over the boundary for six, off Braund. I believe that this is the first such instance in Tests, even if you include earlier Tests where they scored four and five. In all Tests, the next clear-cut case is by CL Vincent off AP Freeman at Headingley in 1929. It's probably still rare in Tests at the MCG, if you limit it to proper hits over the fence, rather than the rope. Mike Hussey was the last to do it there, off Andre Nel, in 2005/06.\n\n********\n\nFollowing a question on Ask Steven, I looked for cases of two bowlers taking wickets in the same over (one bowler retiring hurt). [I wrote something about replacement bowlers taking wickets on my blog last year. Scroll down to 20 June 2013, or search for \"Wickets by Substitute Bowlers\". There is a case of a replacement bowler Craig McMillan, taking two wickets in what was left of the over, at Harare in 2000/01.]\n\nI couldnt find any cases of wickets falling to two different bowlers. The nearest thing was at Port-of-Spain in 2008Mumbai in 2002: Rahul Dravid retired hurt on the same ball as the bowler Dillon went off injured. Harbhajan was out first ball to Cuffy when the over continued.\n\nOnly a couple of bowlers have taken a wicket and gone off injured in the same over. One odd one was Murali at Harare in 2004. He took a wicket with the last ball of one over and another with the first ball of his next. He was on a hat-trick, but could not continue. The replacement did not take a wicket. Murali came back later but did not manage a (very unusual) hat-trick. Another bowler who took a wicket and went off injured in the same over was CK Langeveldt at Cape Town in 2005.\n\nUsing replacement bowlers to complete an over only dates from the 1980s.\n\n********\n\nThe longest Test career of a player whose debut innings remained his highest score was Darren Gough (58 Tests, highest score 65). Gough never exceeded his previous highest score: the player who surpassed his previous best score most times was Dilip Vengsarkar, on eleven occasions.\n\nAlec Stewart made his highest Test score of 190 at Edgbaston in 1992. He played 115 subsequent Tests (202 innings) without improving on that score.\n\n********\n\nUltimate Strike: Most Consecutive balls faced by one batsman in a Test innings (where known)\n\n33\n\nSaqlain Mushtaq\n\nPak v Eng, Faisalabad 2000/01\n\nBatting with Danish Kaneria\n\n30\n\nGAR Lock\n\nEng v WI, Georgetown, Guyana 1968\n\nBatting with PI Pocock\n\n29\n\nR Benaud\n\nAus v Eng, Melbourne (MCG) 1958/59\n\n29\n\nJH Kallis\n\nSAf v WI, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad 2010\n\n17 February 2014\n\nFollowing the Follow-On\n\nWhen New Zealand declined to enforce the follow-on when leading by 301 runs in the recent Auckland Test, it created a mild flurry of debate. Some hold that enforcing the follow-on is an essential tactic. The stats, surprisingly perhaps, suggest otherwise.\n\nI looked at follow-on situations in Tests over the past 20 years, and excluded Bangladesh and Zimbabwe matches. There were 108 follow-on opportunities; 69 were enforced, and 39 not enforced. Average runs (rounded) for the teams involved were\n\nAll\n\nF.O. Enforced\n\nNot Enforced\n\nTeam 1 runs\n\n509\n\n528\n\n462\n\nTeam 2 runs\n\n217\n\n217\n\n216\n\nLead\n\n291\n\n310\n\n246\n\nA key thing to remember is that any team leading by 200 runs is in a dominant position, and will very likely win, whether or not the follow-on is chosen. There is not much point citing specific matches anecdotally to try to prove a point.\n\nGiven that the enforced category teams were more dominant, you might expect them to win more matches. However, the opposite is the case. Teams enforcing the follow-on won 72.5% of the matches, while teams not enforcing it won 82%. The rest of the matches were draws, except for one (famous) case where Australia enforced the follow-on at Kolkata in 2001 and lost. So even though teams enforcing the follow-on tend to have bigger leads (310 to 246), they are less likely to win.\n\nOne possible factor is that high-scoring matches on really easy pitches tend to be drawn, and the follow-on is more likely to be enforced in such cases. Naturally, higher scoring matches are more likely to be drawn. However, even when we compare like with like, the advantage of not enforcing remains. If we filter out the higher-scoring matches, by including only matches where the combined first innings is less than 800, and the lead less than 300, not enforcing still has a significant lead, with 92% wins vs 79% for the enforced cases.\n\nThere may be other factors in play  perhaps the enforced cases were more rain-affected (I dont know)  but the bottom line is that enforcing the follow-on is not statistically supportable in terms of outcomes.\n\nThis was all a bit of a surprise to me, since the modern tendency is for teams batting fourth to win more matches than they lose. Teams not enforcing also often face the problem of the declaration: most captains like to create a safe buffer, which takes time, and one would think would increase the chances of a draw. When the subordinate teams bat again, they do better second time around when they follow-on than when they do not (296 runs to 277); however, the difference is not huge.\n\nThe figures do support a contention I made years ago: if you want to maximise your chances of winning, declare before a score of 500. A risk arises of losing (Freddie Flintoff must have had nightmares over Adelaide 2006/07), but the probability of a draw falls even more.\n\nOf course, New Zealand did eventually win that Auckland Test. One wonders if the follow-on had been enforced: with India at 240/3, would New Zealands tiring bowlers have been able to power on and finish the job? Maybe yes, but India may have finished with more than 366, in a match they only lost by 40 runs.\n\nFor Australia, it hardly matters. Basically, when they lead by 200, they win, follow-on or no follow-on. Australia has won 27 out if the last 29 when it had a follow-on option; the only exceptions were a drawn match with almost 3 days of rain, and the freak turnaround of Kolkata 2001.\n\nThe last team to trail Australia by more than 200 and genuinely force a draw was Pakistan in 1994/95 when everyone's favourite player Salim Malik made 237. Since the 200-run follow-on margin was introduced in the 60s, Australia has won every time it has not enforced the follow-on (17 matches).\n\nThe main worry for captains contemplating the follow-on is the prospect of over-extending the bowlers; burnout can affect both the match at hand and matches to come.\n\n********\n\nFastest Maiden Test centuries, balls faced to 100:\n\nGL Jessop 76\n\nPW Sherwell ~100\n\nD Denton ~100\n\nRR Lindwall 88\n\nR Benaud ~75\n\nRJ Hadlee 88\n\nK Srikkanth 97\n\nJR Murray 88\n\nCL Cairns 86\n\nL Klusener 100\n\nSM Pollock 95\n\nDR Smith 93\n\nMS Dhoni 93\n\nJE Taylor 97\n\nMG Johnson 86\n\nS Dhawan 85\n\nMominul Haque 98\n\nKapil Dev reached 102 off 101 balls with a boundary.\n\n********\n\nNew Zealand wicket-keeper/captain Lee Germon did not concede a bye for the first 1242 runs of his Test career. Other clean starters include TE Blain 1062, RG de Alwis 955 runs. (AP Binns up to 1000 runs, exact number uncertain). Germon had a remarkable Test debut: not only did he concede no byes, he captained his team on debut (no one has done this since, except in the first Test for Bangladesh) and he top scored in both innings.\n\nFor records at any stage of career, the probable maximum without byes, in terms of runs or balls, is 2431 runs (5426 balls) by Mark Boucher spanning 7 Tests in 1999/99. He finally conceded a bye, off Paul Adams, at Auckland in 1999 after New Zealand had been batting for 190 overs (including follow-on). Strangely, he conceded four byes off the very next ball. Adam Parore went bye-free for a long period in 1994/95. Unfortunately one of the necessary scorebooks is missing: the number of runs is in the range 2274-2373 (around 4100 balls). There is an oddity about this case as well; just a few Tests later, Parore was replaced as keeper but remained in the team as a batsman. He was replaced behind the stumps by the aforesaid Lee Germon.\n\nIncidentally, number of balls without byes is probably more appropriate than number of runs. The longest single Test innings without byes is 268 overs: New Zealand 543/3 at Georgetown 1972, TM Findlay keeper.\n\n********\n\nThere was an extraordinary innings by Victoria against New South Wales in a recent Shield match. Victoria lost its first 6 wickets for 9 runs, with the first four batsmen making ducks. The latter is unprecedented in Australian first-class cricket, the former has not been seen since 1881. [Once again, the folly of using nightwatchmen (two in this case) is demonstrated.] The sensations did not end there, with Glenn Maxwell coming in and scoring 127 off 102 balls. A century by a #8 when the first seven did not get to double figures has happened before (not in Australia), but never when so few runs were scored by the first seven batsmen (10 runs in Maxwells case). For precedents, or near-precedents, here is an interesting one.\n\n********\n\nConsecutive first-class innings without a duck\n\nInns\n\nEnding\n\nMC Cowdrey\n\n148\n\n1965\n\nG Boycott\n\n142\n\n1975\n\nCS Baker\n\n135\n\n1914\n\nGL Berry\n\n135\n\n1937\n\nLB Fishlock\n\n135\n\n1951\n\nDI Gower\n\n135\n\n1986\n\nWRD Payton\n\n133\n\n1927\n\nMTG Elliott\n\n128\n\n2004\n\nL Hutton\n\n127\n\n1952\n\nFA Lowson\n\n126\n\n1954\n\nBJ Hodge\n\n126\n\n2006\n\nFE Woolley\n\n124\n\n1933\n\nEH Hendren\n\n122\n\n1934\n\nSJ Cray\n\n121\n\n1950\n\nGT Dowling\n\n121\n\n1972\n\nMJ Smith\n\n120\n\n1978\n\nUp to mid 2013.\n\n********\n\nRajan Chawla on Ask Steven asked about streaks of singles in Test matches.

There is mention of Mushtaq Mohammad, or going back further, Percy Fender or Plum Warner. Generally, the claims do not have a lot of hard evidence. However, Sreeram has uncovered an incontrovertible example from a Test in 1921. In the Manchester Test, Fender employed the shot, as described in The Times\n\nMr. Armstrong kept the runs down at one end by bowling a couple of feet outside the leg stump. Mr. Fender was the more resourceful of the two batsmen, for, in dealing with Mr. Armstrong, he contrived at times to get away and place the ball on the deserted off side. He once shifted hands on the handle of the bat and pulled him back-handed across the wicket to the place where cover-point generally stands.\n\nFenders shot was also described in some detail by Charlie Macartney in an article 16 years later, so it must have made an impression.\n\nThe shot was made in the midst of some controversy. England had attempted to declare their innings closed in what was a rain-shortened match, only to be stymied when Armstrong pointed out that this was against the rules of the time. When England was forced to resume, Armstrong, who had bowled the last over before the interruption, bowled again. Apparently, calls from the crowd that this was about to happen were ignored by the umpires. Fenders switch-hit occurred shortly thereafter, apparently gathering 2 runs, but the exact ball is uncertain.\n\nAs I said in an earlier post, Im sure I read of such a shot in the 1909/10 MCC series in South Africa, (although I cant find it now). Viv Richards definitely played the shot at Mumbai in 1975. Many inventions are made independently by different people, and I daresay the reverse sweep is one such.\n\nUPDATE: Steve Pittard has emailed with a case from 1870. It is not completely clear that this batsman changed his stance as the ball was being bowled, or during the run up.\n\nKent were shot out for 20 at the Oval in 1870, with their latecomer William Yardley - had not arrived 0 - trying to make amends in the 2nd innings by way of a cunning plan. Opening the batting, as fast bowler Walter Anstead came in to bowl, the ambidextrous Yardley - able to throw 75 yards left handed  reversed his normal right handed stance and leathered the ball, only narrowly missing the nearby fielder Southerton at point, who now was an aunt sally at effectively silly mid on . In fairness Yardley had enigmatically warned Southerton that should he see him suddenly change stance to make himself scarce but he had merely laughed. The next ball Yardley successfully repeated the trick with Southerton this time dropping spread eagled to the ground. This greatly amused Yardley though the Surrey supporters were incensed; shouting Not cricket! Not cricket. Yardley, a thespian and later notable playwright, had turned the proceedings into a farce and when Anstead was withdrawn from the attack the crowd hissed and hooted him like a pantomime villain. Anstead later returned to clean bowl Yardley for 14 and with his innovation ultimately proving to no avail - Kent lost by an innings - one imagines the incident was dismissed as a bit of nonsense\n\n********\n\nBeing There\n\nAlastair Cook was around for 59.5% of England's runs in the 2010/11 Ashes series, which appears to be the most for a 5-Test series. Shoaib Mohammad batted during 82.3% of Pakistan's runs in a 3-Test 1990 series against New Zealand. Brad Haddin's efforts in the 2013/14 series are surely exceptional for someone batting down the order.\n\nDSBP Kuruppu batted in 100% of Sri Lanka's runs in a one-off Test against New Zealand in 1986/87.\n\n******\n\nHeres two bowlers who had catches missed off their first ball in Test cricket: David Warner (Brisbane 2012, Brownlie dropped by Pattinson) and RP Singh (Shoaib Malik dropped by Kumble) in Faisalabad 2006. My database doesn't have much on this category before 2002.\n\n********\n\nThey took their first Test wicket with their last ball in Test cricket\n\nIJ Siedle\n\nDW Hookes\n\nM Venkataramana\n\nMV Boucher\n\nRM Poore\n\nS Amarnath\n\nSV Nayak\n\nW Barber\n\nWB Rankin (to date)\n\nWHB Frank\n\nMohammad Talha\n\nWilf Barber (2 balls in 1935) came closest to taking a wicket with his only ball in Test cricket.\n\n********\n\nMost runs by a batsman while partner(s) scored 0\n\n67\n\nMohammad Yousuf\n\nInd v Pak, Multan 2003/04\n\n66\n\nSJ McCabe\n\nAus v Eng, Nottingham (Trent Bridge) 1938\n\n65\n\nAC Gilchrist\n\nAus v SAf, Cape Town 2001/02\n\n64\n\nKC Sangakkara\n\nSL v NZ, Christchurch 2006/07\n\n64\n\nBB McCullum\n\nNZ v Aus, Adelaide Oval 2008/09\n\n63\n\nWG Grace\n\nAus v Eng, The Oval 1886\n\n59\n\nGAR Lock\n\nEng v WI, Georgetown, Guyana 1968\n\nThe last 66 runs of the innings, in a partnership of 77 with LO Fleetwood-Smith (5).

Among top batsmen, Graham Gooch never did so in his whole career of 118 Tests. Kumar Sangakkara hit the winning run for the first time in his 119th Test, so in effect he ties Gooch.\n\n********\n\nIn the 2013/14 Ashes, Kevin Pietersen averaged 29.4, and still topped Englands averages among those who played all five Tests. This is the first time that a team in a full-length Ashes series has had no batsman averaging over 30 in the full series. (Ben Stokes averaged 34.8, but played in only four Tests.) Here is a list of such Worst Best averages historically.\n\nWorst Best Ashes Batting Average\n\nBest Avge\n\nEngland\n\n2013/14\n\n29.4\n\nKP Pietersen\n\nAustralia\n\n1956\n\n30.1\n\nJW Burke\n\nAustralia\n\n1911/12\n\n32.4\n\nWW Armstrong\n\nAustralia\n\n1978/79\n\n32.6\n\nGN Yallop\n\nEngland\n\n1930\n\n34.0\n\nWR Hammond\n\nQualification: players who played all Tests in a series. 5- or 6-Test series only. In 1930, H Sutcliffe averaged 87.2 but played in only 4 Tests.\n\nTendulkar Head to Head\n\nAfter a couple of requests, I am posting a complete set of Sachin Tendulkars player-v-player stats in Tests at the link below. There was an earlier version of this in 2012, but that had a few problems, which I have painstakingly ironed out, I hope.\n\nSuch data requires ball-by-ball records, and unfortunately this is not available for some of Tendulkars Tests in the 1990s. In such cases, I have substituted estimates based on the runs scored by Tendulkar and the runs conceded by the bowlers in the innings in question. Where this happens, the data is labelled Est. For some bowlers such as Muralitharan, there is a combination of such data with real ball-by-ball data. For those who demand exactitude, sorry, but it is the best I can do.\n\nFor Tendulkar, bbb data is complete for all Australia, England and South Africa bowlers.\n\nhttp://www.sportstats.com.au/tendulkarheadtohead.html\n\nA few statistical morsels\n\nMost consecutive 5WI in first-class cricket: ten by AP Freeman in 1930.\n\nMost consecutive 10WM: eight (believe it or not) by Tom Richardson in 1895. WG Grace once got seven in a row, in 1874.\n\n*****\n\nI once looked for the maximum number of consecutive balls scored from in Tests. The answer wasn't very interesting, only 16 in a row (23 runs) by Rashid Latif during an otherwise unremarkable innings of 47 off 42 balls at Sharjah in 2001/02.\n\n*****\n\nThere are more than a dozen players in first-class cricket who have taken a wicket in their only over. At least two of them took a wicket with their only ball, BN Khanna and MM Agasti.\n\n*****\n\nMitchell Johnson was twice on a hat-trick in the same innings in the Adelaide Test. This got me looking at the database...\n\nLast bowler to be on a hat-trick twice within the same innings in Ashes Tests: KR Miller Brisbane 1946/47.\n\nLast Australian bowler in all Tests: GD McGrath v West Indies Brisbane 2000/01.\n\nLast bowler in all Tests: Chaminda Vaas v NZ Wellington 2004/05.\n\nOnly bowler to take wickets with consecutive balls three times in an innings (where known) J Srinath v South Africa at Ahmedabad 1996/97.\n\n*****\n\nThere are over 40 triple-wicket maidens in complete overs in the database, (covering 80% of Tests). Last one found: Ben Hilfenhaus v India at Perth 2012. No one has more than 2 (Caddick, Vettori, McGrath, DJ Brown).\n\nThere are other cases of 3 in an over where the over was incomplete.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Kallis once took 3 wickets in an over while conceding 10 runs (6 0 W 4 W W).\n\n*****\n\nSunday Play in Australia\n\nIn first-class cricket, regular Sunday play commenced in 1967/68, same year as in Tests. Brian Booth, a devout Christian, played only one match in 1968/69 and then retired because he did not wish to play on Sundays. Adelaide was the last center to introduce Sunday play.\n\nPrior to 1967, there was Sunday play in some Shield matches in Brisbane and Perth. The first was QLD v WA at the Gabba in 1964/65. It was introduced as \"the answer to declining attendances\". If only.\n\n*****\n\nMost runs in international cricket in any 31-day period. Sanath Jayasuriya hit 881 runs for 22 July to 20 August 1997. Aravinda de Silvas best was 842. Graham Smith has 822 for 3 July to 2 August 2003. I believe that these are the only ones above 800 in a 31-day period. Next is Zaheer Abbas on 792.\n\n******\n\nChris Gayle, at Edgbaston in 2004, took 5 wickets and scored 82 runs on the same day (the fourth). I can find (if I programmed by search correctly) only two other cases of 50 runs and five wickets on the same day. Jimmy Sinclair took 6/26 and made 59* on the first day at Cape Town in 1898/99, and Wes Hall scored 50* and took 5/20 on the second day against India at Port of Spain 1962.\n\nPerhaps the most notable other is Shakib al Hasan of Bangladesh who took 4/40 and scored 97 on the fourth day at Khulna against West Indies in 2012. The wickets, however, were tailenders in a score of 648.\n\nBill Edrich (Manchester 1947) and Garry Sobers (Sydney 1969) scored over 100 runs and took 3 wickets on the same day.\n\n*****\n\nGraham Swanns abrupt retirement means that he conceded 22 runs off his last over in Test cricket. This is not quite a record. Derek Stirling conceded 24 runs in the last over of his Test career, at the Oval in 1986. 4, 6, 4, 6, 0, 4 courtesy Ian Botham.\n\nMark Gillespie's last over in Tests conceded 20 runs in 2012, but he may play again.\n\nOf course, there is no law that says that Swann cannot play Tests again. Others have 'retired' in the heat of the moment and regretted it afterwards. Whether Swann would be welcomed back I don't know.\n\n28 November 2013\n\nMore Simple Stats that are Hard to Find\n\nI have been extracting some more statistical information from the Cricinfo texts  yes, it is painstaking  to get some baseline stats on catches and other dismissals. Here is a summary list of the location of catches, based on nearly all Tests from 2002 to 2013.\n\nkeeper\n\n31.4%\n\n1slip\n\n8.7%\n\n2slip\n\n6.1%\n\n3slip\n\n2.2%\n\n4slip\n\n0.2%\n\nSlip*\n\n8.0%\n\ngully\n\n5.2%\n\n3man\n\n0.5%\n\npoint\n\n5.2%\n\ncover\n\n4.1%\n\nmid-off\n\n3.9%\n\nbowler\n\n3.9%\n\nmid-on\n\n4.5%\n\nmidwicket\n\n5.0%\n\nshort leg\n\n5.2%\n\nsquare leg\n\n3.8%\n\nfine leg\n\n2.2%\n\n* Slip in this context generally refers to slip fieldsman for spin bowlers.\n\nThe locations are based on descriptive names of locations given in the texts, so there are no hard and fast rules, and different commentators may have different definitions. But mostly, this should be a useful baseline for comparison of dismissal locations between from country to country and team to team, and even individual players.\n\nThere is also potential for historical comparison (but not now), especially using Bill Frindalls old England scores, which describe locations. [A slight complication is that Frindall sometimes used categories of locations that did not directly compare to standard definitions when categorising run-scoring. In Frindalls runs-scoring records, there is no point or square leg area. The boundary between categories is perpendicular to the pitch and goes right through the middle of what others would regard as point and square leg. This problem is also seen in Cricinfos batting charts.]\n\nI have also looked at bowled dismissals in little more detail. About 17% of batsmen were out bowled since 2002, a figure that has remained reasonably steady since about 1990, but well down on earlier times. About 26% of batsmen out bowled edged or hit the ball onto the stumps (at least to the extent that it was noticed), and a further 4% were bowled off the pads (less than I would have thought), so only 70% of batsmen out bowled are clean bowled. It would be interesting to know how many of those who played on did so to a ball that would not have hit the stumps. This is hard to say: I would estimate roughly about half, or a bit more, based on read"
