        "text": "What tells you that you have the #potential to produce great things in your life? This year Justin-Henry Malloy moved from AAA to the majors for the Detroit Tigers. His first game he hit his first major-league home run. His average started strong but then tailed off. Sunday he came to bat with a .210 average. Other players were being sent to the minors to work on hitting with that average. He could have thought ‚Äúwho am I, ‚Äúcan I do this,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat evidence do I have?‚Äù There just happened to be 3 baserunners, so bases were loaded. And the Tigers were down 3-0. Pressure was on. The day prior Jake Rogers came to bat with the same average and bases loaded, in a tight 1-0 game, and he hit a grand slam. What are the odds of it happening two days in a row? In the same inning? Guess what - it did!!! Malloy got his first major league grand slam home run. Well done. The Tigers are working on their mindset. The confidence to know they belong, they can do this. It has paid off with 9 wins the past 12 games. How are you developing the #confidence and #positivemindset in your life. #PersonalGrowth #ProfessionalSuccess\n\nFootball season is here! I know I‚Äôm a baseball guy, but, I love me some college football‚Ä¶especially my Iowa Hawkeyes and LSU Tigers! Everything seems to turn into a competition this time of year‚Ä¶fantasy football, people arguing about whose team is better, my kids flexing about how big their fish is! ü§£ But here‚Äôs the big reminder I get everytime football or baseball season starts: your competition isn‚Äôt other people. It‚Äôs YOU. My competition is my procrastination‚Ä¶my ego‚Ä¶my neglect‚Ä¶my negativity. I can‚Äôt compete at the highest level in ANYTHING until I‚Äôve conquered the things distracting me. What gets your competitive juices flowing?

Here is the five question quiz that I gave my students today. How many of these can you answer correctly (without using technology)? Theme: Mostly Obscure Sports Trivia. Answers provided in the comments below. 1. Which bowler currently holds the record for most PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) Major Titles won? 2. Which competitive eater currently holds the record for most hot dogs (and buns) eaten in 10 minutes? 3. Which former professional wrestler (now deceased) served as the spokesperson for Slim Jim meat sticks? 4. What jersey number did Michael Jordan wear after returning to the NBA in 1995 (after taking a year and a half off from basketball to play baseball)? 5. Which actor plays Ricky ‚ÄúWild Thing‚Äù Vaughn in the 1989 film Major League? Hint: He‚Äôs been rumored to have tiger blood.\n\nWhen preseason starts the first game of the regular season feels a million miles away ! Today we prepare to take on Charlotte FC in our 4th preseason game exactly 2 weeks until the Major League Soccer season starts! As a support team it‚Äôs important to take the time to reflect on current plans/ protocols. I like to evaluate current player/ team status, take the hard conversations early, be clear and transparent to define clear objectives, and make sure departmental goals! The next 2 weeks are all about building intensity through match play and will very vital to getting off to a good start, It‚Äôs therefore vital to use the time wisely and make sure departmental goals and objectives are aligned to the on field philosophy! #intensity #soccertraining #preseason #goals\n\nDelaying the front side (97 mph mechanics)‚Å† ‚Å† If you're struggling with early torso rotation, the fix tends not to come from trying to hold the glove arm or torso closed, but by holding the PELVIS closed.üí°‚Å† ‚Å† When the pelvis stays sideways, the trunk follows.‚Å† ‚Å† @karl_blum‚Å† -‚Å† Looking for guidance in your baseball career?‚Å† -‚Å† We‚Äôve had over 150 draft picks and Free Agent signs, 750+ College commitments, and over a dozen MLB Debuts since 2017. You provide the work ethic, we‚Äôll construct the plan with a coach to guide you step by step through the process.‚Å† -‚Å† Click the link in our bio to learn more!\n\nIt‚Äôs Saturday. Let‚Äôs take a break from labor markets and talk about the NBA. With 30% of the season underway, here are a few thoughts: 1. Wemby. I‚Äôm not sure how great he will be overall, but I‚Äôll be surprised if he wouldn‚Äôt be considered the greatest defensive player ever. He‚Äôs a much taller and longer Olajuwon. 2. Oklahoma city. They will win multiple championships. They are already a top 7 team in the league. With Shai Gilgeous-Alexander they have a top 5 player for the next 6-7 years. Chet Holmgren will be a top 10 player in 2-3 years. With what they have now and all their future draft picks, they‚Äôll surround them with 5-6 well above average players. 3. Golden state. They are done. They should start rebuilding immediately while their veterans still have high market value. Thoughts? #nba #offtopic"
