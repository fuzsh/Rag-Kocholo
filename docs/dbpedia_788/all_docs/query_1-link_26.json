        "text": "Dan O’Brien, 65, of Mattapoisett, had an ordinary practice session last Dec. 7 in the Twilight League at Wonder Bowl.\n\n“There was nothing unusual about it,” he said. “I used my go-to ball, a Storm Sure Lock, and I had no great expectations for the night.”\n\nEven after a handful of strikes, he still wasn’t thinking about the possibility of his first 300 game. That came a few strikes later.\n\n“After I got the ninth strike,” said O’Brien, “I didn’t get nervous. I kept telling myself to keep throwing the same shot.”\n\nHe did just that.\n\nAs he got to the 12th shot, he knew there would be a crowd congregating behind his lanes.\n\n“I kept my head down,” he said, “watched the pins and took a deep breath. I wanted another good shot and I got it.”\n\nThe right-handed bowler’s previous high game was a 289 bowled a long, long time ago, he said.\n\nHis night wasn’t over, though. He still had two games to go.\n\nO’Brien bowled a 257 in the next game, did some math and knew what he needed to bowl in the last game for his first 800 series.\n\n“I bowled a 789 series last year,” he said. “I was hoping I would bowl an 800 series.”\n\nHe came up six pins short when a 10-pin stopped him in the 10th frame.\n\n“It came down to the 10th box,” he said. “I left the 10-pin and I hadn’t missed one all night. This time, however, I pulled the ball when I delivered it and missed the pin.”\n\nThe Twilight League is the only league O’Brien bowls and he has a 210 average.\n\nHe started bowling in the early 1960’s when Bowlers Country Club, then known as Atlantic Ten Pin, opened in Fairhaven.\n\n“Wonder Bowl wasn’t even open yet,” he said.\n\nHe bowled in the Junior League in Fairhaven, then, in 1972, he jumped to adults and joined the Twilight League when it was in Fairhaven. When BCC closed in 1998, he followed the league as it moved west to Wonder Bowl.\n\nHe never took any time off from bowling during his whole career, and when he married Kathy and had two children (Joey and Meghan), the couple signed them up for junior bowling when they became old enough.\n\nMeghan only bowls in the summer now and Joey bowls on dad’s team B.U.I. when he doesn’t have to work or take care of his own children.\n\nThrough the years, his team has won three or four championships and won one the first year Joey was on the team.\n\nO'Brien's only goal when he goes to the lanes on Friday nights is help the team win and have a good time doing it.\n\nHe waited this long to bowl a perfect game. He’ll be patient and will wait a little while longer for the 800 series.\n\nUpcoming events\n\nThe Southeastern Massachusetts USBC annual Open Championship Tournament is March 16-17 and 23-24 at AMF Somerset Lanes.
