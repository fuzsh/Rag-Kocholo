        "text": "TEN-PIN BOWLING\n\nThe Bowling we all know is Ten-Pin Bowling. Ten-pin bowling is a competitive sport in which a player (the \"bowler\") rolls a bowling ball down a wooden or \"synthetic\" (polyurethane) \"lane\" with the objective of scoring points by knocking down as many pins as possible.\n\nThe 41.5-inch (105 cm) wide, 60-foot (18 m) lane is bordered along its length by \"gutters\" - semicircular channels designed to collect errant balls which also pose an obstacle to advanced bowlers, because a straight ball cannot be rolled on a regulation lane at the angle required to consistently \"carry\" (knock down) all ten pins for a strike. Most skillful bowlers will roll a more difficult-to-control \"hook\" ball to overcome this. There is a \"foul line\" at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler: if any part of a bowler's body touches the lane side of this line after the ball is \"delivered\" (rolled), it is called a \"foul\" and no pins knocked over by that delivery are scored (The bowler is allowed a shot at a new \"rack\" of ten pins if he fouled on the first roll of a frame). Behind the foul line is an \"approach\" approximately 15 feet (5 m) long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it. 60 feet (18 m) from the foul line, where the lane terminates, it is joined to a roughly 24-inch (61 cm), 41.5-inch (105 cm) wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the \"pin deck\" where each rack of pins is set.\n\nThe bowler is allowed ten frames in which to knock down pins, with each frame being composed of up to two rolls. The tenth frame may be composed of up to three rolls: the bonus roll(s) following a strike or spare in the tenth (sometimes referred to as the \"eleventh\" and \"twelfth\" frames) are \"fill balls\" used only to calculate the score of the mark rolled in the tenth. Bowling has a unique scoring system (see below) that is notoriously confusing to newcomers who attempt to score a game with multiple \"marks\" (strikes and spares). Bowling scores tend to be unintuitive: if a bowler was to knock down 9 pins with his first shot but miss his spare every frame, he would have a score of 90; if the same bowler were to make all of his spares and knock down 9 with the bonus ball, he would have a score of 190. If he were to carry all ten pins with each shot and strike with each of his bonus balls in the tenth frame, he would have shot a \"perfect game\" of 300.\n\nSince being brought to the United States from Europe, ten-pin bowling (thought to be descended from the game of skittles) has risen in popularity as its technology has improved. The sport is most popular in the United Kingdom and the United States. Both nations maintain national regulatory organizations that govern the sport's rules and conduct and many of those countries' best players participate in tournaments on both the national and international stage. Because of the rise in popularity, many companies are now making bowling balls and apparel for professionals as well as for recreational bowlers. Bowling has also become more prevalent in the media in recent years, with the continued popularity of bowling publications and the appearance of films centred around the culture of the sport. However, the sport continues to face challenges in garnering mainstream coverage of the athletic aspects of the game.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nIn 1930, British anthropologist Sir Flinders Petrie along with a team of archaeologists, discovered various primitive bowling balls, bowling pins and other materials in the grave of an Egyptian boy dating to 5200 BC. Their discovery represents the earliest known historical trace of bowling. However, some dismiss these findings[citation needed], arguing that bowling originated in Germany in AD 300. The first written reference to bowling dates to 1366, when King Edward III of England banned his troops from playing the game so that they would not be distracted from their archery practice. It is believed that King Henry VIII bowled using cannon balls. In Germany the game of Kegal (Kegelspiel) expanded. The Kegal game grew in Germany and around other parts of Europe with Keglars rolling balls at nine pins, or \"skittles\".\n\nNinepin bowling was introduced to America from Europe during the colonial era, similar to the game of skittles. It became very popular and was called \"Bowl on the Green\". The Dutch, English, and Germans all brought their own versions of the game to the new world, where it enjoyed continued popularity, although not without some controversy. In 1841 a law in Connecticut banned ninepin bowling lanes due to associated gambling and crime, and people were said to circumvent the letter of the prohibition by adding an extra pin, resulting in the game of ten-pin bowling.\n\nModern American ten-pin bowling is most closely related to the German nine pin game Kegelspiel. Germans were instrumental in fostering the game's popularity as they formed their own bowling clubs both before and after the American Civil War. The first indoor bowling alley was Knickerbockers of New York City, built in 1840. The Brunswick Corporation's addition of bowling equipment to their product line also served to increase the sport's popularity. In 1914 Brunswick replaced their line of wooden bowling balls with hard rubber Mineralite bowling ball. The change was met with great approval.\n\nOrganization and increased popularity\n\nInside a typical ten-pin bowling alley, Shropshire, UK\n\nInside a typical ten-pin bowling alley, Shropshire, UK\n\nBowling has long been seen as a sport of the working classes. Accordingly, most bowling alleys at the turn of the century were small, private establishments, mainly frequented by men. This began to change as the sport became increasingly regulated and generally gained in prestige. Although it has not shed its working class image entirely, today bowling is no longer only a unisex sport, and is enjoyed by people the world over. In 1895 the American Bowling Congress was started in New York City. This was soon joined by similar organizations geared toward female bowlers. These groups began creating the standard rules for bowling that have survived to the modern day. At the same time, the sport's image among the upper classes was enhanced by the opening of more luxurious and elegant lanes like The White Elephant in New York City, opened by restaurateur Joe Thum, whom many consider to be the father of bowling, along with Dick Weber. Thum created the first bowling organization in the United States on September 9, 1895, when he pulled together representatives of various regional bowling clubs into an overarching organization, the American Bowling Congress (ABC). This spurred greater interest in the game, with the number of officially sanctioned lanes rising from 450 in 1920 to 2,000 in 1929.\n\n1940 to 1960\n\nThe period from 1940 to 1960 is known as the golden age of bowling due to the sport's great popularity and advances in its play. Indeed, by 1945, bowling was a billion-dollar industry in the United States. Promotion by the U.S. Armed Forces and its image as a sport for the common man made bowling an enticing choice of activity for Americans. For this reason, racial integration was perhaps inevitable. The American Bowling Congress had been a whites-only organization throughout its existence, but lobbying by numerous labor organizations and individuals after the war quickly led to a reversal of this policy.\n\nThis era also saw a great increase in bowling technology. Pins had previously been set by human pinsetters or \"pin boys\", but with the invention of the semi-automatic pinsetter in 1936, the process became much easier. In 1946 AMF Bowling launched the first commercial fully automatic pinspotter to replace the earlier Brunswick semi-automatic and fully manual bowling establishments. Brunswick itself introduced its own automatic pinspotter design to bowling centers in 1955. The television age of the 1950s also helped to increase the popularity of ten-pin bowling, as images of the sport began to enter the homes of millions across the United States. Eddie Elias founded the Professional Bowlers Association in 1958, and its Pro Bowlers Tour became a permanent part of ABC's sports lineup.[3]\n\n1960 to the present\n\nTen-pin bowling was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1960. This was driven by the opening of the Stamford Hill and Golders Green bowling alleys in London. Ten-pin bowling took the UK by storm, with alleys opening up one after the other. At its peak there were over 160 bowling alleys in the UK, but a lack of re-investment and waning interest left the fad in a sorry state. This led to a general deterioration of bowling alleys, with a commensurate decline in their image. In the 1970s a major chain operator pulled out of bowling and converted many of the more luxurious alleys into Bingo halls. The industry nearly collapsed, with two thirds of the existing alleys closing over the next few years.\n\nUntil the mid 1980s there was little, if any, new investment in the sport with the decline in interest being attributed to the complex scoring system, especially as it was a manual process then. However, this all changed with the introduction of computers and automated electronic scoring systems. This meant that the general public only had to enter their names into the computers and everything else was done automatically. This changed the face of bowling and was largely responsible for the newfound interest in the sport.\n\nAMF carried this revitalization of the sport by embarking on a major refurbishment programme. This re-investment led to the construction of many bright, modern and attractive sites and began the second golden age of bowling. During the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of ten-pin bowling alleys across the country rose to over two hundred. This was higher than it had ever been in the sixties, then the peak of the sport's popularity.\n\nToday, over 100 million bowlers play in over 90 different countries. More men and women worldwide play bowling than any other sport, with the possible exception of football (soccer in the USA). Bowling has far more registered dues-paying participants than any other sport. The bowling industry spends significantly more money each year than any other sport on airlines, restaurants, hotels and rental cars.[8] There is an active movement to make bowling an Olympic sport, especially by the Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs, the world governing organization for nine and ten-pin bowling. The most elite players regularly play in televised tournaments, and new bowlers continue to delight in learning the game. In addition, modern bowling alleys have changed greatly. As people have become exposed to a wider range of entertainment options, the trend has shifted to building large entertainment centers that allow people to enjoy many different activities. These developments often include multi-screen cinemas, restaurants and night clubs. This has had a great impact on the image of the sport among families.\n\nPlay\n\nA game of ten-pin bowling is divided into ten rounds (called \"frames\"). In a frame, each player is given two opportunities to knock down the skittle targets (called \"pins\"). He or she rolls the first ball at the pins. If the first ball knocks down all ten pins, it is called a \"strike\" and the frame is completed. When pins are left standing after the first ball, those that are knocked down are counted and then removed. Then the player rolls a second ball and if all the remaining pins are knocked down, it is called a \"spare\". There are bonuses for removing all the pins. If there is more than one player scheduled on a lane, play passes to the next player until all players have completed the frame. Then play continues with the next frame. The final or tenth frame of a game may involve three balls. See Scoring below.\n\nThe ten pins are usually automatically set by machine into four rows which form an equilateral triangle where there are four pins on a side (Pythagorean Tetractys). There are four pins in the back row, then three, then two, and finally one in the front at the center of the lane. The pins are numbered one through ten, starting with one in front, and ending with ten in the back to the right. This serves to ease communication; one could say that the 4 and 7 pins were left standing. Neighboring pins are set up 12 inches (30 cm) apart, measured from center to center. Due to the spacing of the pins and the size of the ball (about 8.6 inches (22 cm) in diameter), it is impossible for the ball to contact every pin. Therefore, a tactical shot is required, which would result in a chain reaction of pin hitting pin. In an ideal shot, for a right-hander, the ball will contact only the 1, 3, 5 and 9 pins. (For a left-hander, the 1, 2, 5 and 8 pins).\n\nIn order to count, a pin must be knocked over entirely. Even if a pin wobbles, unless it is knocked over completely, it is not scored. If the pin is wobbling as the automatic pin machine picks it up, it is still considered standing, and is not scored. Also, if a pin is moved, it does not change its designation. For example, if the 10 pin was still standing and the 7 pin slid into the 8 pin position, converting this spare would still be considered and given a 7-10 split award (if performed in sanctioned play).\n\nThere are generally two primary styles of rolling the ball down the lane. Most newer players play by rolling the ball straight, hopefully into the 1-3 pocket for right-handed bowlers or the 1-2 pocket for left-handed bowlers. More experienced bowlers usually roll a hook, which means that they make the ball start out straight and then curve towards the pocket. To produce a hook the player needs to let go of the ball with his thumb first, then the middle and ring finger release almost simultaneously. This gives the bowling ball its spin needed for the hook. If the player is right-handed, an ideal position of the thumb after letting go of the ball is \"10 o'clock\", meaning that the thumb has gone from 12 to 10, as looking at a clock. The corresponding position for left-handed players is 2 o'clock. Of course there are innumerable variations in style and technique and the position of the thumb can vary from person to person. Lab research has shown that the ideal shot will enter the pocket at an angle of 6 degrees with respect to the lane boards, which means that a straight ball should be thrown from the side of the lane, near the gutter.\n\nThe conventional bowling styles use either a four or five step approach beginning 8 to 16 feet (2.4 to 4.8 metres) behind the foul line. Some extremely young or physically challenged players may use both hands to swing the ball forward from in between their legs. This kind of style has the bowler start close to the foul line, and is called \"Granny style\". Another method for novice bowlers is the \"bounce pass\" technique which is performed by thrusting the ball from your chest with two hands towards the pins. This technique is easily picked up by weaker players but is seldom used because it is frowned upon by the bowling community due to the potential to damage the lanes and/or ball.\n\nThere are systematic ways of using the lane arrow marks and approach dots to make it easier to hit the pocket to get strikes, and for making spares. Focusing on these targeting guides helps eliminate fear of the gutters.\n\nRules and regulations\n\nPlaying area\n\nThe sport of ten-pin bowling is performed on a straight, narrow surface known as a lane. This bowling lane is 60 feet (18.29 m) from the foul line to the head pin (1-pin). About 15 feet (4.57 m) from the foul line are a set of guide arrows. The lane is 41.5 inches (1.05 m) wide and normally consists of 39 wooden boards or a synthetic material. The bowling lane has two sets of approach dots; from the foul line back to the first set of approach dots is about 12 feet (3.66 m) and to the second set of approach dots is about 15 feet (4.57 m) (an additional 3 feet (1 m)). Although this figure varies, the lane is protected by about 18 ml of oil. The PBA events use about 30 ml of oil, and the PWBA events use 25 ml.\n\n.\n\nUSBC rules specify that a pin must be 15 inches (38 cm) tall and about 4.7 inches (12 cm) wide at the \"cock\" of the pin, where a rolling ball would make contact. There are additional measurements which delineate the shape. The weight of a single pin must be at least 3 pounds, 6 ounces (1.47 kg) and no more than 3 pounds, 10 ounces (1.64 kg). Within a set of ten pins, the individual weights may vary by no more than 4 ounces (113.4 g), if made from wood or plastic coated, or just 2 ounces (56.7 g) if synthetic. The top of the pin shall have a uniform arc with a radius of 1.273 inches, ± 1/32 inch (31.5 – 33 mm).\n\nThe USBC also has regulations governing the weight distribution of the pin from top-to-bottom. Pins are allowed one or two \"voids\" (holes) in the belly area (which can be viewed if the pin is cut in half from top-to-bottom). The voids are needed to balance the narrower top half of the pin with the wider bottom half. Without them, the pins would be too bottom-heavy to fall properly when struck.\n\nThe pins must show the name and mark of the maker, either \"USBC Approved\", \"WIBC Approved\", or \"BTBA Approved\" and appear uniform.\n\nThe head pin or 1 pin stands on board 20 of the lane. There are a total of 39 boards.\n\nBowling ball\n\nThe circumference of the ball must not be more than 2.25 feet (0.69 m), and the ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds (7.26 kg). The ball must have a smooth surface over its entire circumference except for holes or indentations used for gripping the ball, holes or indentations made to bring the ball back into compliance with weight-distribution regulations, identification letters and numbers, and general wear from normal use.\n\nFor much of the history of bowling, bowling balls were made using a three piece construction method. Starting in the mid 1990s, however, most manufacturers switched to a two-piece method. In response to these innovative ball designs, the American Bowling Congress placed further restrictions on the technical characteristics of the ball such as the radius of gyration and hooking potential.\n\nRules of play\n\nA game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock down as many pins as possible with their bowling ball. In games with more than one bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able to knock down all ten pins with their first ball, he or she is awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus points are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or 1 ball (for a spare). If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins in the tenth frame, the bowler is allowed to throw 3 balls for that frame. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 points, a perfect game.\n\nScoring\n\nIn general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So if a player bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down 9 pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame.\n\nIn the event that all ten pins are knocked over by a player in a single frame, bonuses are awarded.\n\nA ten-pin bowling scoresheet showing how a strike is scored\n\nA ten-pin bowling scoresheet showing how a strike is scored\n\nstrike: When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an \"X\" on a scoresheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.\n\nFrame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)\n\nFrame 2, ball 1: 3 pins\n\nFrame 2, ball 2: 6 pins\n\nThe total score from these throws is:\n\nFrame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19\n\nFrame two: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nTOTAL = 28\n\nTwo consecutive strikes are referred to as a \"double.\" Three strikes bowled consecutively are known as a \"turkey\" or \"triple.\" Any longer string of strikes is referred to by a number attached to the word \"bagger,\" as in \"four-bagger\" or \"five-bagger\" for four or five consecutive strikes. Recently, the event of bowling four consecutive strikes has also been called a \"ham bone.\" This terminology is used most often when a bowler is \"off the strikes.\" (i.e. has previously bowled a string of several strikes but failed to strike on his most recent ball.) When a player is \"on the strikes,\" a string is often referenced by affixing \"in a row\" to the number of strikes bowled consecutively. Six strikes in a row are sometimes referred to as a \"six pack.\"[12][13]6 strikes and 9 strikes in a row can also be referred to \"Wild Turkeys\" and \"Golden Turkeys\" respectively. Any string of strikes starting in the first frame or ending \"off the sheet\" (where all of a bowler's shots from a certain frame to the end of the game strike) are often referred to as the \"front\" or \"back\" strikes, respectively (e.g. the 'front nine' for strikes in frames 1-9, or the 'back six' for strikes in frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). A \"Perfect Game\" or 12 strikes in a row is also colloquially referred to as the \"Thanksgiving Turkey.\"\n\nA player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so:\n\nFrame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)\n\nFrame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)\n\nFrame 3, ball 1: 4 pins\n\nFrame 3, ball 2: 2 pins\n\nThe score from these throws is:\n\nFrame one: 10 + (10 + 4) = 24\n\nFrame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16\n\nFrame three: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nTOTAL = 46\n\nThe most points that can be scored in a single frame is 30 points (10 for the original strike, plus strikes in the two subsequent frames).\n\nA player who bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls so as to allow the awarding of bonus points. If both these balls also result in strikes, a total of 30 points (10 + 10 + 10) is awarded for the frame. These bonus points do not count on their own, however. They only count as the bonus for the strike.\n\nspare: A \"spare\" is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted). It is typically rendered as a slash on scoresheets in place of the second pin count for a frame.\n\nExample:\n\nFrame 1, ball 1: 7 pins\n\nFrame 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare)\n\nFrame 2, ball 1: 4 pins\n\nFrame 2, ball 2: 2 pins\n\nThe total score from these throws is: 7 + 3 + 4 (bonus) + 4 + 2 = 20\n\nA player who bowls a spare in the tenth (final) frame is awarded one extra ball to allow for the bonus points.\n\nCorrectly calculating bonus points can be difficult, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive frames. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems, linked to the machines that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not fool-proof, as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing.\n\nThe maximum score in a game of ten-pin is 300. On Feb. 2, 1997, University of Nebraska sophomore Jeremy Sonnenfeld became the first person ever to roll three perfect games of 300 in a three-game series (as approved by the American Bowling Congress). This has only been achieved a handful of times since. The odds of bowling a perfect game or series depend on the condition of the lanes and the skill of the bowler. It is not something that is easily accomplished.\n\nIn Britain, the youngest bowler ever to achieve a perfect single game score of 300 (12 consecutive strikes), in a sanctioned competition was 12 years, 2 months and 10 days old Elliot John Crosby, at AMF Purley in South London, England in the Surrey Country trials on January 7 2006.[14] Crosby beat the previous British 300 shooter record holder Rhys Parfitt by more than a year. Parfitt was 13 years, 4 months when he achieved a 300 point game at the London international tenpin bowling tournament in 1994. In the United States, the youngest ever bowler to achieve this in a sanctioned competition is two-handed bowler Chaz Dennis of Columbus, Ohio. He achieved this competing in the Hillcrest Preps-Juniors league at Hillcrest Lanes in Columbus, Ohio on December 16, 2006 at 10 years, 2 months, 27 days old. Dennis was 20 days younger than the previous record-holder, Michael Tang of San Francisco, California, who set his record when he was 10 years, 3 months, 16 days old competing in the Daly City All Stars Scratch Trios League at the Sea Bowl in Pacifica, California.\n\nWorld tournaments\n\nMajor world tournaments\n\nThe \"Weber Cup\" is the ten-pin bowling equivalent of golf's Ryder Cup. It is the world famous major world tournament of Team Europe vs. Team USA bowling championships that happens annually. Other major world-famous bowling tournaments include the World Tenpin Masters and the Qubica/AMF World Cup.\n\nAll of the three world major bowling tours above are televised on Sky Sports by Matchroom Sport who have established a tried and tested formula to highlight televised bowling at its best. All three events are also presented by broadcaster and journalists, Nick Halling and Cass Edwards.\n\nThere is also the influential European Tenpin Bowling Federation, which has the prestigious European Bowling Tour - and under that the PTBC Storm English Open.\n\nAmong the leading world tournaments is the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. The PBA Tour takes place in North America, except for one stop in Japan (Dydo Japan Cup) that is considered a PBA event. This tour has 20 or more events per year (running from October to April), and includes four major championship events: the PBA U.S. Open, USBC Masters (known as the ABC Masters prior to 2005), the H&R Block Tournament of Champions and the Denny's World Championship. Although PBA headquarters are based in the USA, the PBA has members from all over the world whom also compete in all of its events. The PBA tour is televised in America and certain parts of the world by ESPN and ABC.\n\nAlong with increased coverage in recent years, these tours have become more profitable for bowlers. Earl Anthony, who bowled left-handed, became the first bowler to earn more than $100,000 (U.S.) in a single season when he finished the 1975 PBA Tour schedule with $107,585. He broke the $1 million mark in career earnings in 1982. The PBA now has some single tournaments that pay $100,000 to the winner. Norm Duke is the youngest person to win a PBA Tour tournament. He won the 1983 Cleveland Open at age 18 years, 345 days. The youngest person to bowl a PBA event is 15-year-old Jack Perry of Ontario, Canada, who rolled in the 2004 PBA World Championship. The oldest player to win a regular PBA Tour title is John Handegard, who won the 1995 Northwest Classic at age 57 years, 139 days. Walter Ray Williams Jr. is the all-time leader in PBA titles with 44.\n\nThe USBC (United States Bowling Congress) has two major championship events: the USBC Open Championships and the Women's Championships and the USBC Masters (known as the ABC Masters prior to 2005).\n\nThere is also the Commonwealth Tenpin Bowling Championships.\n\nWorld Ranking Masters\n\nTen-pin bowling has an international ranking system, as with professional tennis. This ten-pin equivalent is known as the World Ranking Masters and is made of three vast tours: the European, Americas and Asian bowling tours.\n\nMinor world tournaments\n\nOther minor tournaments, although major in their respective countries, include Britain's prestigious BTBA Nationals (BTBA National Championships), the Brunswick Ballmaster Open, Brunswick Euro Challenge in Greece, ETBF European Youth Championships and the European Gold Cup. The world's premier amateur event is the FIQ World Championships (Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs) which is held once every two years.\n\nLeague play\n\nTraditionally, a major form of organized bowling has been through league competition. Leagues are typically groups of teams that compete with one another over the course of a 28 to 36 week season. The league season traditionally begins at the end of the summer and ends in the spring. Summer leagues are often offered with a much shorter schedule.\n\nIn most leagues, teams of individuals bowl three games (called a \"series\") each. A typical league will schedule two teams to compete against one another each week. Usually the winner of each game is decided by adding up the scores of all teammates. Leagues typically decide standings by awarding a certain number of points for each team game win. Additionally, points are usually awarded for total pincount for each team over the course of all three games (commonly referred to as \"total wood\"). Throughout the course of a season, each team will usually face all of the other teams in competition.\n\nLeagues can have various formats. While most leagues are mixed leagues, containing both men and women, men's and women's leagues are still common, along with junior leagues for young bowlers. There are also different types of competition. Scratch leagues are those in which the actual pin count determines the winner. Most leagues are not scratch, but handicap leagues. In handicap leagues, the scores are a combination of the actual pins knocked down, plus addition of a handicap value, to give teams with lower averages a chance to compete against teams that have higher averaged bowlers. The handicap system provides a means to compare scores across the whole league. The best leagues set up their rules, so that every team has benefit of handicap for every game bowled, every league session, for their whole schedule. Every league determines their own basis for the handicap. They can select a team average basis or an individual average basis. The basis is set at a percentage, nominally in the 80-100% range, of a value higher than the highest average in the league, including an allowance for average improvement over the league's schedule. (Note: Some leagues use an inferior handicap system, that only allows comparison of scores between two teams that are scheduled to compete against each other, on one particular date. Instead of using the same basis value for every team, that system uses the average difference between just those two teams. The resultant handicap is given to the lower average team, while the higher average team opponent receives no handicap. The inferior system only covers points won for game or series. As there is no common basis, it does not allow comparison of scores across the whole league and therefore is counter-productive for all teams in the league.) The ability to compete for \"league high score honors\" would normally help to keep all teams involved in all of the competition aspects, points won and league high scores. A properly organized league can provide many opportunities for recognition of both personal and team accomplishments.\n\nCurrently, over three million people compete in bowling leagues. At its peak in the late 1970s, over nine million men and women competed in leagues throughout the United States.\n\nTechnology changes and controversy\n\nHistory of technological changes\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, nearly all bowling balls had a hard rubber surface. As the coatings applied to wood lanes changed from softer lacquer to a harder urethane in the early 1970s, the first plastic balls became widely available. Subsequent changes -- particularly urethane and later \"reactive\" resin or composite (\"particle\") bowling balls -- have been altering the physics of how the ball rolls and strikes the pins. Coupled with synthetic lane surfaces and advanced oiling machines presenting the opportunity to lay out lane oil patterns that make targeting easier, there have been numerous concerns. Honor scores (for 300 games, 800 series, etc.) have increased by several thousand percent on a per-member basis in the time period from 1980 to the present. To many, this has cheapened the intrinsic value of honor scores and created other workarounds.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, the ABC/WIBC honor awards were genuine treasures because they were so rarely won. In response to the view that advanced equipment is spoiling the integrity of the sport, the USBC introduced in 2000 the \"Sport Bowling\" program which offers a different optional league certification and the USBC provides a separate set of honor awards. In Sport Bowling, lane conditions are more highly regulated and controlled than in traditional leagues, and the oiling patterns used are generally more even with regards to volume and ratios of oil across the surface of the lane. Sport Bowling conditions are similar to those used at some major championships of professional bowling, particularly the U.S. Open. In more recent years, \"PBA Experience\" leagues have been introduced that allow bowlers to compete on the five main lane conditions currently used on the PBA Tour.\n\nNot everyone has embraced the Sport Bowling concept. PBA Hall of Famer Johnny Petraglia argues that Sport Bowling combats changes in bowling balls simply by making it tougher to roll a shot into the \"pocket\" (the 1-3 pins for a right-hander, 1-2 pins for a left-hander). According to Petraglia, Sport Bowling is merely an attempt to \"create the scores that were shot 30 years ago. The problem is, 30 years ago the game wasn't tougher. You could hit the pocket as easily as you do now, but you couldn't knock over the same amount of pins with a rubber bowling ball. Sport bowling is, for the first time, intentionally trying to make the lanes tough.\"[20] Petraglia's suggestion to combat high-tech bowling balls is to use heavier pins that are single-voided on the bottom (versus double-voided), making them less top-heavy.\n\nBowling alley proprietors and lane maintenance personnel have also argued that changes in ball technology have made it more difficult to lay out fair and credible conditions for participants. This is because advanced players using high-tech balls need more oil to score high, and might complain about the radical behavior of their balls on \"dry\" lanes. At the same time, less aggressive players with older equipment might complain when they can't get their balls to hook on ever-increasing amounts of oil. Such complaints about lane conditions have actually been part of the game throughout bowling history, and will likely continue.\n\nUSBC technology study\n\nAmong advanced players, there is little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring: they have. Yet there are those who have seen their scores decline, often due to not changing their technique or bowling balls appropriately. Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.\n\nAt the end of 2007, the USBC completed a two-year study on bowling ball motion and how advanced, high-tech equipment may influence lane conditions and scoring. Establishing a Bowling Ball Specifications Task Force -- comprised of research engineers and volunteers from ball manufacturing companies -- the USBC sought to better understand the motion of bowling balls using scientific research and data analysis. Test equipment included, but was not limited to, a robotic ball-thrower, a Computer Aided Tracking System (\"Super C.A.T.S.\"), 59 reactive resin and particle bowling balls from various manufacturers, and eight lanes in a climate-controlled facility.\n\nThe driving force behind the study was summed up by USBC Technical Director Neil Stremmel: \"USBC is concerned that technology has overtaken player skill [as the primary factor] in determining success in the sport of bowling.\"[21]\n\nThe USBC expects to complete data analysis and release study results to the public in the spring of 2008.\n\nBrands\n\nToday there are an exceptional number of major sports-related and non sports-related companies that focus specifically on designing, producing and or supporting the production of many items specifically designed for ten-pin bowling equipment. Such items include balls, bags, cleaning products, wrist supports, shirts, shoes, trousers, shorts and gloves, etc. Some of the major world famous equipment producers and supporters include AMF, Brunswick, Dacos, Ebonite, and Storm.\n\nOther manufacturers and suppliers include Lane#1, Track, Roto-Grip, Hammer, Circle Athletic, Columbia 300, Dyno-Thane, Fun Balls, Legends, MoRich, Robby, and Via Bowling. Specially designed shoe design and manufacture is also a significant enterprise that many companies have gotten involved in next to ball production. Some of the major shoe designers are Circle, Dexter, Etonic, and Linds.\n\nIndividual stores that sell the merchandise made by these companies specifically for ten-pin bowlers are called Pro Bowl stores or Pro Shops.\n\nIn the USA, Bowling equipment sales totaled 215 million US dollars in 1997 which is around the same figure as in 1996 when the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) released their reports.[22] In Britain 'Mintel International Group Ltd' produced a 'Market Research Report' in July of 2004 which gave the UK's Tenpin bowling sales and market by sector from 1999-2003 and also the type of customer"
