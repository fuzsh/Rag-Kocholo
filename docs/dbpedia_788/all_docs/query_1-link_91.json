        "text": ">> Introducing Matt Campbell\n\nMatt Campbell, the Big 12's second-longest tenured active coach and just the second in school history to coach 100 games, has changed the culture and invigorated the Iowa State football program since taking over as head coach prior to the 2016 season.\n\nCampbell, who owns the second-best winning percentage in school history (52.5 pct.), enters the 2024 season just four wins shy of breaking Dan McCarney’s school record of 56 victories.\n\nHe initiated his rebuilding plan and laid the foundation by imploring his team to “Trust The Process.” His team listened, sparking Iowa State to its most fruitful periods in the program’s history.\n\nNational rankings and bowl berths have become the norm thanks to Campbell’s leadership. The three-time Big 12 Coach of the Year (2017, 2018, 2020) has led the Cyclones to winning records and bowl games in six of the last seven seasons, including a school record five straight from 2017-21, and regular appearances in the national rankings.\n\nIn 2020, Campbell led the Cyclones to a first-place finish in the final Big 12 regular-season standings, a spot in the Big 12 Championship game and a New Year’s Six bowl game, all program firsts.\n\nThe 2020 Cyclone squad was one of the best in school history. With a 34-17 win over No. 25 Oregon in the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl, the Cyclones claimed their first victory in a New Year’s Six bowl. ISU broke the school record for conference wins (8) and tied the school mark for overall victories (9).\n\nCampbell’s run at ISU has caught the nation’s attention with its drastic improvement, placing Iowa State football into the national rankings and the college football spotlight. Iowa State has appeared in the AP Top 25 poll in five of the last seven seasons.\n\nCampbell, who has fostered a player-driven atmosphere with his contagious personality, owns 39.3 percent of Iowa State’s all-time victories over ranked teams, defeating 11 opponents ranked in the nation’s Top 25 since 2017.\n\nIn 2021, Campbell notched his fourth victory over a Top 10 opponent (Oklahoma State). ISU owned just eight victories all-time over Top 10 teams prior to his arrival.\n\nRecords have been shattered in the Campbell era on offense and defense, including total offense (444.3 in 2019) and sacks (33 in 2018, 2021). His teams play with precision on both sides of the ball, boasting a defense ranked among the Big 12's top three in scoring defense in each of the last seven seasons and producing three of the top four scoring offenses in school history. Campbell’s 2022 squad became just the third team in league history to lead in scoring defense, rushing defense, passing defense and total defense.\n\nCampbell is the only coach in Iowa State history to defeat every team he’s faced in the league at least once at home and on the road during his Cyclone tenure and produced six of Iowa State’s seven winning seasons in Big 12 Conference history (1996-present).\n\nThe Cyclones have played as a ranked team a school-record 25 times since 2017 and Campbell has 38 victories vs. Big 12 competition, the most by a head coach vs. league teams in program history. Campbell owns 46.3 percent of the school’s all-time wins vs. Big 12 teams (1996-present).\n\nSince 2017, Iowa State has recorded 36 Big 12 wins, ranking among the top half of the league during that time.\n\nThrough recruiting, retention and development, Iowa State football players have received numerous national awards and All-America honors in Campbell’s tenure. Running back Breece Hall was ISU’s first unanimous All-American in school history in 2020 and was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year in both 2020 and 2021. Tight end Charlie Kolar became the first three-time All-American in school history and was the recipient of the 2021 William V. Campbell Trophy, given annually to the nation’s best scholar-athlete.\n\nMost recently, T.J. Tampa earned All-America honors after a standout senior season at cornerback. Tampa is just the third defensive back in school history and second under Campbell to earn All-America accolades.\n\n2023\n\nIowa State rebounded from a down season as Campbell and his coaching staff did, perhaps, their best coaching job based on the circumstances surrounding the team. With a decimated roster that was ultimately one of the nation’s youngest, the Cyclones bounced back from a 1-2 start to finish the season 7-6 overall and 6-3 in Big 12 play. Iowa State advanced to play in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, tying it for the third-most bowl appearances (six) in the Big 12 Conference since 2017.\n\nThe roster included just 10 scholarship seniors as more than 20 redshirt sophomores or younger appeared in all 13 games.\n\nAfter the slow non-conference start and splitting their first two league games, the Cyclones found their stride and went 3-0 in October. ISU won four-straight conference road games in the same season for the first time in school history, including a thrilling 42-35 snow game victory at No. 19 Kansas State in the regular season finale. The win featured five Cyclone scoring plays of 50+ yards and gave ISU back-to-back wins in Manhattan for the first time since the 1920s.\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Rocco Becht burst onto the scene and broke all of the ISU freshman passing records on his way to being named Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year. The Cyclone defense finished the season with 16 interceptions, including five by sophomore Jeremiah Cooper and two by Tampa. The pair both earned a spot on the All-Big 12 First Team, while Tampa earned the 17th All-America honor by a Campbell-coached Cyclone.\n\nWide receiver Jaylin Noel had the best season of his career, pulling in 66 receptions and seven touchdowns as one of the nation’s most versatile players, to earn All-Big 12 Second-Team honors along with tight end Stevo Klotz.\n\nSafety Beau Freyler became the first Cyclone since 2017 to notch 100 tackles in a season on his way to earning All-Big 12 Second-Team honors from the Associated Press.\n\n2022\n\nISU’s defense continued to shine as one of the nation’s best units. The Cyclones led the Big 12 in total defense (285.6 yards per game), rushing defense (107.3), passing defense (178.2) and scoring defense (20.2 points), becoming just the third team in league history to lead in all four categories. Iowa State held every opponent to fewer than 400 yards of total offense, running its streak to 15-straight games. The streak eventually reached 18 games before being snapped in 2023.\n\nThe Cyclones strolled into Kinnick Stadium and beat Iowa in a defensive slugfest, 10-7, as they started 3-0 for the first time since the 2012 season.\n\nIowa State had a record-setting performer on both sides of the ball. Wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson was a Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned All-America honors after shattering his own school record and leading the Big 12 Conference with 107 receptions. He led the nation in receptions per game (8.9) and was also among the Top 10 in receiving yards (1,171) and receiving yards per game (97.6).\n\nOn defense, Will McDonald had 5.0 sacks and tied the Big 12 record with 34.0 in his career. McDonald, who joined Hutchinson as three-time first-team All-Big 12 honorees, became ISU's first, first-round NFL Draft selection since 1973 when the New York Jets selected him with the 15th overall pick.\n\n2021\n\nIowa State qualified for a school-record fifth-straight bowl (Cheez-It Bowl) and registered a program-best fifth-straight winning season, tying for fourth in the Big 12 at 7-6 overall and 5-4 in league play.\n\nA victory at Kansas State, ISU’s first in Manhattan since 2004, and a triumph over No. 8 Oklahoma State, Campbell’s 10th victory vs. a Top 25 team in his Cyclone tenure, gave him wins over every league team on the road and at home in his Cyclone career. He is the only coach in school history to accomplish that feat.\n\nThe Cyclone defense was outstanding. ISU only allowed two teams to reach 350 yards of total offense, ranking ninth nationally in total defense at 310.5. ISU also tied a school record with 33 sacks, as first-team All-American McDonald IV led the league in sacks for the second-straight year with a school-record 11.5.\n\nBehind consensus All-American Hall and four-time All-Big 12 QB Brock Purdy, who graduated with 32 school records, the Cyclones produced the fourth-best scoring average (31.3) in school history. ISU was second nationally in red zone offense (95.9%), converting on 47-of-49 trips.\n\nHall was second nationally in scoring (138) and broke the all-time NCAA FBS record by rushing for a touchdown in 24 consecutive games.\n\nCyclone tight end Kolar was the recipient of the prestigious William V. Campbell Trophy, which is awarded annually to the nation’s best scholar-athlete football player and considered the Academic Heisman.\n\n2020\n\nThe 2020 campaign will go down as one of the greatest in Iowa State football history. The Cyclones surged as the frontrunner for the Big 12 title with a 37-30 win over No. 18 Oklahoma in October, their first win over the Sooners in Ames in 60 years, and never let up.\n\nBy season’s end, Iowa State was in sole possession of first place in the final regular-season conference standings (8-1) for the first time in school history, earning a rematch against Oklahoma in its first-ever Big 12 Championship game.\n\nThe historic regular season earned the Cyclones their first New Year’s Six bowl berth, defeating No. 25 Oregon, 34-17, in the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe victory over the Ducks, Campbell’s second bowl win at ISU, gave the Cyclones their ninth victory on the year, tying the school record for single-season wins (1906, 2000).\n\nCampbell was honored as the Big 12 Coach of the Year for the third time in four years and was a finalist for national coach of the year by all four of the major coaching awards: Eddie Robinson, Bobby Dodd, Bear Bryant and George Munger.\n\nThe national media paid attention during the season. Iowa State cracked the AP Top 10 for the first time since 2002 and achieved its highest ranking in school history at No. 6 in the fourth College Football Playoff rankings.\n\nIowa State, which played as a ranked team a school-record 10 times, ended the season ranked in the final AP poll (No. 9) for just the third time ever (1976, 2000).\n\nCampbell continued his excellence against ranked opponents, knocking off a trio of rated teams (Oklahoma, Texas, Oregon) for only the second time in school history. It marked the first time an Iowa State team defeated both Oklahoma and Texas in the same season.\n\nIowa State had incredible balance on offense and defense, ranking among the Big 12's top three in both scoring offense (32.9, 3rd) and scoring defense (21.4, 2nd). The offense scored 30-plus points in seven of nine Big 12 games and set a school mark with 31 rushing touchdowns. The defense was second in the league and 21st nationally in total defense (340.4) and first in the Big 12 and eighth nationally in rushing defense (103.1).\n\nIowa State players were rewarded for the breakout season with a school-record and Big 12-best nine players earning All-Big 12 first-team recognition.\n\nThe Cyclones also had a school-record four All-Americans in RB Hall, TE Kolar, DE JaQuan Bailey and LB Mike Rose. Hall, who was the nation’s leading rusher (1,572) and ranked second nationally in rushing touchdowns (21), was the first unanimous All-American in school history, earning first-team All-America accolades from the AP, FWAA, AFCA, Walter Camp and Sporting News.\n\n2019\n\nIowa State’s 2019 offense was the most prolific in program history, helping the Cyclones finish tied for third in the Big 12 with a 7-6 overall record and a 5-4 league mark.\n\nSchool records fell in the following offensive categories: total offense (5,776), passing offense (4,047), yards per play (6.45) and points scored (418). Ten times during the season the Cyclones generated over 400 yards of offense and eight times Iowa State had more total yards than its opponent.\n\nA victory at No. 22 Texas (23-21) on a last-second, walk-off field goal was a signature win during the season, as the Cyclones appeared in the College Football Playoff rankings for the third-straight season.\n\nThe offense was led by All-Big 12 QB Purdy, who broke virtually every school passing record, including passing yards (3,982), total offense (4,231), completions (312) and passing touchdowns (27).\n\nKolar was his favorite target, earning second-team All-America honors by the FWAA and CoSIDA Academic All-America accolades.\n\n2018\n\nThe 2018 Iowa State football team once again captured the imagination of college football fans by proving the 2017 campaign wasn’t a fluke.\n\nDespite a 1-3 start to the season, Campbell kept the Cyclones on the right path by making an amazing turnaround with a five-game win streak, tying the best single-season conference victory string in school history en route to earning Big 12 Co-Coach of the Year accolades.\n\nThe Cyclones had six conference victories, second-best in school history, and also proved to be a tough out at home, ending the season on a six-game win streak at MidAmerican Energy Field at Jack Trice Stadium, tying the school record (six) for most season victories in the stadium.\n\nIowa State wrapped up its second-straight bowl berth with a spot in the Valero Alamo Bowl, ending the regular season with an 8-4 mark and tying for third in the Big 12 standings (6-3).\n\nThe Cyclones appeared in all six College Football Playoff rankings behind a stingy defense and Purdy as a true freshman signal-caller.\n\nIowa State led the Big 12 in scoring defense (22.9) and rushing defense (115.0), holding all but two teams to below their season scoring average.\n\nPurdy took over signal-calling duties in the season’s fifth game, promptly leading the Cyclones to five-straight victories and igniting the offense. Purdy had help from All-Americans David Montgomery (RB) and Hakeem Butler (WR), who both tallied over 1,000 yards from scrimmage, the first time in school history the Cyclones had a 1,000-yard rusher and 1,000-yard receiver in the same season.\n\nButler shattered the school record for receiving yards in a season with 1,318 yards and was named a second-team All-American by The Athletic.\n\n2017\n\nCampbell’s 2017 squad will be remembered for breaking through.\n\nPicked to finish ninth in the Big 12 Conference, the Cyclones capped off their outstanding 2017 campaign with a victory in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl over Memphis, just the fourth bowl win in program history. He was named Big 12 Coach of the Year for his efforts.\n\nIowa State surged into AP Top 25 poll for the first time since 2005 thanks to a perfect 4-0 mark in the month of October where it defeated two Top 5 teams in Oklahoma and TCU.\n\nPrior to the season, Iowa State was 1-56-2 all-time vs. teams ranked in the Top 5 of the AP poll, tripling its all-time career total.\n\nThe victory over No. 3 Oklahoma (38-31) in Norman was Iowa State’s first win over a Top 5 opponent on the road and one of the school’s signature triumphs. Iowa State followed up the OU win with a 14-7 victory over No. 4 TCU three weeks later, helping the Cyclones garner their first appearance in the College Football Playoff rankings.\n\nIowa State finished the 2017 season with an 8-5 overall record and an upper-half finish in the Big 12 at 5-4.\n\nThree of ISU’s wins were against ranked opponents (Oklahoma, TCU, Memphis) and five were on the road, breaking or equaling school marks in both categories.\n\nCampbell coupled an opportunistic offense with a stingy defense for the success in 2017. ISU scored over 40 points five times during the season, tying the school record for 40-point games in a season.\n\nDefensively, the Cyclones ranked in the Top 30 nationally in scoring defense (26th, 20.9) and turnover margin (16th, +10). The Cyclones broke school marks in fewest turnovers and fewest fumbles lost in a season, going nearly the entire year before losing their first fumble, tying the NCAA FBS all-time record along the way.\n\n2016\n\nCampbell’s work with the Cyclones in his inaugural season proved he was the right man for the job.\n\nInheriting a program with depleted numbers on both sides of the ball, the Cyclones displayed gradual improvement throughout the season, as ISU compiled a 3-9 overall mark and a 2-7 record in Big 12 play.\n\nIowa State’s offense was balanced and efficient, boasting a 1,000-yard receiver in All-Big 12 performer Allen Lazard and a rushing attack which featured three players with 500+ yards on the ground, a first in school history.\n\nOutstanding Players....Historic Victories....Elite Recruiting\n\nIn his eight years at Iowa State, Campbell has mentored 13 players who have earned All-America honors, including six first-teamers in Joel Lanning, Hall, Rose, Bailey, McDonald IV and Hutchinson.\n\nHall is the only unanimous All-American in school history and joins Troy Davis (1995, 1996) as the only two-time consensus All-Americans in Cyclone history. Kolar is the only three-time All-American in program history.\n\nMcDonald became Iowa State’s first player selected in the first round of the NFL Draft in 50 years and Hutchinson and Anthony Johnson Jr. were also picked in 2023. After T.J. Tampa's selection in 2024, Campbell has seen 11 of his Cyclone players hear their names called during the NFL Draft.\n\nFour Cyclones were drafted in 2022, including Hall as a second-round pick by the New York Jets. Kolar and Enyi Uwazurike were picked in the fourth round and Purdy in the seventh round. Allen Lazard, who was an undrafted free agent in 2018, has made his mark as a wide receiver with the Green Bay Packers and Jets.\n\nPurdy has become one of the NFL’s best stories, rising from the last pick of the 2022 draft to starting quarterback and MVP candidate for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nCampbell’s first Cyclone draft pick, David Montgomery, has carved out an impressive five-year career in which he’s tallied more touchdowns in the NFL (36) than any former Iowa Stater.\n\nCampbell’s teams have annually produced historic victories. Campbell owns 40 percent (four) of Iowa State’s 10 all-time wins over ranked opponents on the road and 11 of Iowa State’s 28 all-time wins over ranked opponents.\n\nIn his tenure with the Cyclones, Campbell has four wins over teams ranked in the AP Top 10. Iowa State was 8-98-2 vs. Top 10 opponents prior to his arrival.\n\nJack Trice Stadium has emerged as one of the toughest places to play thanks to Campbell. Since 2018, ISU is 27-12 in home games, tying a school record for home victories in a season (6) in 2018. Iowa State registered two of the school’s four undefeated seasons at home vs. conference teams in back-to-back years (2020, 2021).\n\nHe has also energized a fanbase. Six of the top seven season home attendance marks have occurred in the Campbell-era, including a school-record 60,704 average in 2021, a season featuring four sellouts and a school-record 49,470 season tickets sold.\n\nCampbell’s belief system is grounded in building relationships. He has often been referred to as a players’ coach. Building relationships is at the foundation of his recruiting prowess. His first eight Iowa State recruiting classes rank among the best in school history. His 2022 recruiting class was the best in program history, earning Top 25 rankings by both 247Sports and Rivals.\n\nA Day In The Life of Coach Campbell\n\nAt Toledo\n\nCampbell compiled a 35-15 record in four-plus seasons as the head coach at Toledo and led the Rockets to three nine-win seasons. He coached UT in three bowls and his 2015 Rocket team played in the Boca Raton Bowl after being hired at Iowa State. Campbell’s winning percentage (.700) is third-best in school history, trailing only Nick Saban (.818, 1990) and Bill Orwig (.762, 1946-47).\n\nHe was named the UT head coach in December 2011 (when Tim Beckman left), becoming the youngest head coach in the FBS by three years. Only 16 days after his promotion from offensive coordinator to head coach, Campbell led the Rockets to a 42-41 win over Air Force in the Military Bowl. Interestingly, Campbell coached the bowl game from his accustomed spot in the press box to avoid a game-day distraction. Former Cyclone assistant coach Louis Ayeni handled coaching duties on the sidelines at the bowl game.\n\nThe Military Bowl win was a springboard to many more achievements at Toledo.\n\nCampbell’s first full season as head coach (2012) included an eight-game winning streak. The Rockets upset No. 18 Cincinnati during the win streak, moved into the nation’s Top 25 for the first time in more than a decade and were invited to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl.\n\nThe 2013-14 seasons included 16 wins, shares of the MAC West Division championship both years and the establishment of a nationally respected power rushing attack. Toledo ranked 14th and 12th nationally in rushing offense those seasons. The ’14 campaign ended with a 63-44 victory over Arkansas State in the GoDaddy Bowl as tailback Kareem Hunt returned from injury to rush for 271 yards and five TDs.\n\nHis 2015 Toledo team – which had to replace five offensive line starters – got the nation’s attention in September with a 16-12 upset of 18th-ranked Arkansas. Following that win, the Rockets defeated Iowa State in overtime, their second Power 5 victory in a row. The 2015 Rockets ranked 27th nationally in scoring offense and 28th in scoring defense. They ran the ball (213.2) and stopped the run (115.5) and UT earned the first College Football Playoff ranking in school history.\n\nHe was honored as the 2015 MAC Coach of the Year.\n\nWorking his way up\n\nHis transition from the field to the sidelines began with a two-year term as a graduate assistant (working with the tight ends) at Bowling Green. Those Falcon teams won the 2003 Motor City Bowl and the 2004 GMAC Bowl.\n\nCampbell returned to his alma mater as offensive coordinator and line coach (2005-06) and Mount Union won two more national titles and registered a 29-1 record. Six players earned All-American accolades under his tutelage, including future NFL receiver Pierre Garcon.\n\nHe returned to Division I football for two years (2007-08) as Bowling Green’s offensive line coach. Then, at the age of 29, he was named run game coordinator (2009) before promotion to offensive coordinator (2010-11) at Toledo.\n\nThe Rockets were spectacular on offense during his three-year tenure there.\n\n· The 2009 UT offense was 16th in the NCAA in total offense (437.9), 18th in passing yards (278.1) and first in fourth-down conversions (80%) despite losing its starting QB at mid-season.\n\n· The 2010 Toledo team featured a 1,000-yard rusher and a receiver with 99 catches.\n\n· The 2011 Rockets were eighth nationally in scoring (42.2), 10th in total offense (481.3), eighth in pass efficiency (160.4), 18th in rushing (213.6) and became the first team in school history to score at least 60 points in consecutive games.
