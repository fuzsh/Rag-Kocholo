        "text": "Well that is just plain wrong. Of the 86 tests he played he played 43 at home and 43 away, averaging 22.96 in NZ & an incredible 21.72 away, so if anything he was unlucky not to play more away from home.\n\nThis includes an average of 22 from 6 tests in India. So you really should do your homework before making what seem like obvious assumptions, but are actually incorrect.\n\nIn regards to his batting, you will see in my ratings above I rate his batting the lowest of the 4 allrounders of the 80s, but he still averaged 27 per innings, and was over 30 in the 2nd half of his career, which wasn't an easy time for big averages, so he was definitely a legit all-rounder. Not sure about Marshall comment either, I think to Hadlee's 99 on a greentop vs England when England were bowled out for 82 & 93 in their two innings.\n\nOh, it is not doing my homework to recognise that a bowler who got a lot of seam movement would do well on lavishly seaming pitches such as Christchurch and Trent Bridge? Gracious me, how lax. I suppose my actually having watched Hadlee bowl live in 1983, and on TV over three successive tours of England means nothing either. I even saw him open the bowling with Marshall on the belting pitch at Lords on the Bicentennary Test of 1987.\n\nI remember the match you refer to clearly. It does not matter if it is a green seamer if England bowl consistently the wrong length, which is what happened during that test. Hadlee was amazed by their failure - he wrote that it was the sort of wicket on which the England pros usually excel (most NZ players were amateurs at the time), but they keep bowling short, which on that slow deck meant that the ball sat up for him to whack.\n\nStats are the beginning of understanding, not the end.\n\nYes, they probably do place 4th and 5th in your list. That is not the case for everyone else. The greatest cricketer of them all, in my opinion, will always be an all-rounder and the greatest all-rounder of them all is Imran Khan.\n\nBowlers need to take all 20 wickets, if your team is not good enough to do that, you won't be winning any games of cricket. The batsmen don't need to score a set number of runs. Even if the batsmen fail and don't manage to score more than 150 runs in each innings, the game can still be won by the bowlers. However, if the bowlers fail to take 20 wickets, no amount of runs will be winning you the game.\n\nBradman is a legendary figure because he was the exception and was so far ahead of any batsman in history. Not Sachin, not Viv come close. But I tell you, if there emerges a bowler who averages 10 and manages to take 300 wickets or more at that average, he'll definitely be rated above Bradman.\n\nWhy do you keep repeating that bowlers need to take 20 wickets to win Test matches as if nobody knows this? Cricket is a game in which both runs and wickets matter, and of course you need 20 wickets, but I don't think that automatically follows that Bowling allrounders like Miller & Imran are better than batting allrounders like Sobers and Kallis, who got you massive runs & also chipped in with important, if not quite as many wickets as the other two.\n\nYou will find universally in cricket circles that Sobers is considered the Greatest allrounder ever, even though Imran is almost definitely number 2.\n\nThat said, the fact that this forum seems to rate Tendulkar as the greatest cricketer of all time and a better batsmen than Bradman, it certainly wouldn't surprise me if the consensus here is that Imran was better than Sobers, Wasim a better bowler than Marshall & Waqar better than Steyn etc etc.\n\nNothing surprises me here anymore. But anywhere else, you'll find that along with Bradman being rated the greatest batsman ever, Sobers is rated the greatest allrounder.\n\nWhy do you keep repeating that bowlers need to take 20 wickets to win Test matches as if nobody knows this?

But anywhere else, you'll find that along with Bradman being rated the greatest batsman ever, Sobers is rated the greatest allrounder.\n\nI keep repeating it in the hopes that you finally understand that bowlers are almost definitely the actual match-winners in test cricket. Therefore, bowling all-rounders are more valuable than batting all-rounders who are in the same league.\n\nIt definitely isn't universal although yes, Sobers is rated very highly by the older generation, mostly due to nostalgia. Someone with a bowling SR of 92 will not be getting you \"important\" wickets with enough frequency to be anywhere near a top bowler. Same goes for Kallis, who barely contributed one wicket in an innings for his team.\n\nCompared to more balanced and complete all-rounders like Imran - who averaged over 50 with the bat and under 20 with the ball for a period of 10 years, whilst also being one of the greatest captains of all time - and Miller, they come out just short.\n\nThe general consensus here definitely does not place Wasim over Marshall, Sachin over Bradman, etc but in the case of these all-rounders, the facts are staring you in the face. You are not being forced to be a part of the best cricket forum on the internet. This is actually a privilege, something you need to understand and respect.\n\nI agree, if Hadlee averaged 35 with the bat, he'd probably be right up there with Imran considering he was actually the better of the two as bowlers. but you're right, batting average of 27 with just 2 hundreds (and a 99), doesn't quite cut it. But I still say he's a better allrounder than Kapil Dev since the extra points he gets for his bowling is so much more than Kapil's extra points he gets for batting over Hadlee.\n\nWhich is why I break it down like this.\n\nBatting:\n\nBotham 7.5\n\nImran 7\n\nKapil 6.5\n\nHadlee 5.5\n\nBowling:\n\nHadlee 9.5\n\nImran 9\n\nBotham 7.5\n\nKapil 7\n\nTotals:\n\n1st Imran - 16 points\n\n2nd = Botham/Hadlee - 15 points\n\n4th - Kapil - 13.5 points\n\nYeah I read your post above.\n\nYou have a good point.\n\nHowever I feel that while Hadlee was an incredible bowler, he just about managed to cross the threshold with the bat to be considered AR.\n\nKapil while nowhere close to Hadlee with the ball has played some ridiculous knocks with the bat carting around ATG bowlers. Even in the twilight of his career, he smashed Allan Donald in tests.\n\nHe looks much more of an AR while Hadlee looks like an incredible bowler who just about makes it to the AR category.\n\nIf you split it by points, Hadlee wins comfortably.\n\nIf you look at it from who is more of an assured AR, Kapil wins it imho.\n\nIf Hadlee had achieved just a bit more with the bat and had been rated more for his batting ability, then I would say Hadlee all the way.\n\nRight now, I feel Kapil as an AR is ahead.\n\nBut I get why people would rate Hadlee ahead though.\n\nIt definitely isn't universal although yes, Sobers is rated very highly by the older generation, mostly due to nostalgia. Someone with a bowling SR of 92 will not be getting you \"important\" wickets with enough frequency to be anywhere near a top bowler.

You are not being forced to be a part of the best cricket forum on the internet. This is actually a privilege, something you need to understand and respect.\n\nIt is universal that Sobers is the greatest allrounder and it's not just the older generation at all.\n\nBy universal I mean if you take the consensus evenly (not on which country has the biggest population) across even the 7-8 Test cricketing nations, you would find it would be Sober's quite comfortably.\n\nYou cite his SR failing to realize, he bowled spin if it was needed, he bowled the stock containing overs when required, he bowl very good sharp pace in his younger days, I'm not for a second trying to imply he was near as good a bowler as Imran, but i think he SR is deceptive since he wore so many hats and was often the main stock bowler on flat decks to give the real fast men like Hall etc a break.\n\nDon't forget he averaged a whole 20 more than Imran with the bat, that is significant, it's not a small amount. Many argue (I won't claim this to be a consensus) that Sobers was the 2nd greatest batsman after Bradman, even forgetting that he ever bowled.\n\nI'm pleased to hear the consensus isn't that Tendulkar was a better batsmen than Bradman, that was the impression I got and as I mentioned I've never heard this prior to coming here.\n\nI did however find it both interesting & surprising that when I did an 'Asia's greatest cricketer\" poll that Tendulkar won out over Imran. I personally think it would be Imran, especially if you're telling me many here view him ahead of Sobers. That doesn't quite add up.\n\nIt is universal that Sobers is the greatest allrounder and it's not just the older generation at all.\n\nBy universal I mean if you take the consensus evenly (not on which country has the biggest population) across even the 7-8 Test cricketing nations, you would find it would be Sober's quite comfortably.\n\nYou cite his SR failing to realize, he bowled spin if it was needed, he bowled the stock containing overs when required, he bowl very good sharp pace in his younger days, I'm not for a second trying to imply he was near as good a bowler as Imran, but i think he SR is deceptive since he wore so many hats and was often the main stock bowler on flat decks to give the real fast men like Hall etc a break.\n\nDon't forget he averaged a whole 20 more than Imran with the bat, that is significant, it's not a small amount.

I personally think it would be Imran, especially if you're telling me many here view him ahead of Sobers. That doesn't quite add up.\n\nI disagree. Among the younger generation, Imran Khan is the preferred all-rounder. Sobers did some great things but he didn't have the competition that Imran did and therefore stood out a bit more.\n\nThat SR of 92 shows that Sobers' bowling fluctuated between mediocre stuff and absolute garbage. If his spin bowling has ruined his figures, he really had no business to be bowling spin on any sort of wicket. Sobers' appeal is his ability to bowl three different kinds of styles and you really can't use his strength as an excuse for his poor figures.\n\nSobers was easily a better batsman than Imran, even if you consider that Imran averaged 50+ for a period of ten years. There is no doubt about that. Just like how there is no doubt that Imran the bowler was equally ahead of Sobers the bowler, if not more.\n\nSo what we are left with is a comparison of their secondary skills where Imran certainly wins out. Sobers with his SR of 92 and \"stock\" bowling was never going to impact a match like Imran would, who was a proper frontline batsman for most of his career, despite batting lower down the order. If you bring in the captaincy factor, Imran Khan comfortably moves past Sobers.\n\nI do not know which thread you are speaking of but that only proves that this forum is not overwhelmingly biased towards Pakistani players. I doubt the majority of the forum participated in that poll and it is quite possible that desperate Sachin fans used underhanded measures to ensure their boy came out on top.\n\nI disagree.

I doubt the majority of the forum participated in that poll and it is quite possible that desperate Sachin fans used underhanded measures to ensure their boy came out on top.\n\nYou're reading way too much into one stat the SR, Good test teams generally batted a longer time in the 60s, so SR were higher and ER were lower, his average of 34 is what we should be focusing on, which is handy without being very good.\n\nIf you want to play that game of selecting certain periods when Imran averaged 50m you can do the same with Sobers and he'll average close to 70.\n\nIn fact even if you remove his record against the weakest side Sobers played against, New Zealand, who he didn't do well against and some suggest he wasn't challenged enough, he suddenly averages 63 in his career, and that's across 20 years, not 10.\n\nAlso, if you want to add Imran's captaincy, I'll see his captaincy and raise you Sober's freakish never seen before leg slip/silly mid on fielding. There's some footage of it on you tube, he was freakish.\n\nAlso I'm not talking about any one forum when i mentioned the universal thing, I was meaning among cricket lovers, historians, & past players, there is a strong consensus that Sobers is the greatest ever allrounder.\n\nHere's one brilliant example, (Wisden's 5 cricketers of the century) & probably the most comprehensive one I've seen since it was across 100 cricket experts, writers and past players across a whole bunch of nations, including 11 from the West Indies & 8 from Pakistan, and this was done around the year 2000, so well after Imran's career was complete.\n\nHere's the number of nominees each player got, and you'll see Sobers received 90 out of 100, & Imran just 13... I mean that is an enormous difference, and you can't put that down to bias since the cross section was across many cricket nations.\n\nCan you show me anything even close to as comprehensive as this where a massive group of cricket experts, historians & past players overwhelmingly voted for Imran ahead of Sobers? And no I don't mean a thread on Pakistan Passion (with respect)\n\n1. Sir Donald Bradman 100\n\n2. Sir Garfield Sobers 90\n\n3. Sir Jack Hobbs 30\n\n4. S. K. Warne 27\n\n5.

It really astonishes me. To see what I mean ..pls watch Hobbs bat\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkHWtsrt9Sk&t=325s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rrx2nrgev4\n\nThose clips are self explanatory(If they aren't then we have a bigger problem lol). So my question is do you really think it is fair to compare any of the modern Greats like Viv, Sunny, Tendulkar, Lara etc with Hobbs ? How can you take the words of these cricketers as Gospel when you know that they are merely rehashing cricketing convention and not necessarily ranking players based on real cricketing skills ?\n\nWe've already been though this with Bradman highlights. I think Hobbs looked all class in those highlights with his very small bat.\n\nJust like I think Len Hutton looks awesome if you look at the first minute or so of these highlights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHrS_S1EO8M from the 1930s.\n\nNow to the point about expert cricket writers, past players etc. I agree that one mans opinion isn't the be all and end all, but when you have a selection of 100 experts from a decent cross section of all cricket nations, both older and younger & they vote 90% for Sobers & only 13% for Imran, I think that's something that says a great deal, especially given most of those experts saw both play. It would be different if they were 100 west indians experts, or 100 Pakistan experts, but I posted the even cross section of experts voting for a reason.\n\nWhich is why I placed what i thought was a reasonable challenge for those arguing for Imran,\n\nShow me anything even close to as comprehensive as this where a massive group of cricket experts, historians & past players overwhelmingly voted for Imran ahead of Sobers? And no I don't mean a thread on Pakistan Passion (with respect). It's a fair question to ask, and you won't find it, because when you get a selection across a cross section of cricket nations, they'd always vote Sobers.\n\nIt's just biased to the new styles. Nobody would have dreamed of playing a reverse sweep in those days, they had no helmets for protection.\n\nWho is talking about reverse sweep or helmets ? Certainly not me. They are irrelevant in this discussion but not surprised at you randomly introducing red herrings to divert the attention to elsewhere. Stick to footwork, batting stance , grip, agility in the crease (or a catch all Term for all of it - Technique) while executing main cricket strokes and reverse sweep isn't one of them.\n\nFor instance if your stance is like Hobbs and you play the cut shot like he does and your feet movement is as cumbersome and slow as his you will be made short work by quick bowlers in no time today. And Iam not even talking about short bowling. It has ordinary written all over it and if you think otherwise there is really no point in continuing this discussion as it is a futile one.\n\nBesides, the style of a batsman comes down to personal preference, as an example I never found Tendulkar's style good to watch, I always found his short and squat at the wicket and have generally preferred tall batsmen, but I don't hold it against people who thought Tendulkar looked great to watch.\n\nAnd while I did think you could see Hobbs' undoubted class from that small package, I think that footage of Hutton in 1938 looked even more classy.\n\nMagnificent old players those guys, not near Bradman's level, but certainly some of the greats of all-time.\n\nYou are definitely in the minority if you think Tendulkar is not good to watch. In anycase I wasn't referring to how pleasing and stylish a batsman looks. For example Matthew Hayden is not all that good to watch but it is very very obvious that he is a faaaaar superior batsman than Hobbs in all aspects of the game ... whereas Ashwin who is a tall languid graceful batsman is nowhere as good as Hayden.\n\nAgain nobody disagrees that they were greats of their times but to pretend that they were just as good as the modern players really requires some seriously creative thinking and willingness to believe in whatever is written about them.\n\nWho is talking about reverse sweep or helmets ?

That's called personal preference.\n\nI thought Hutton in particular was magnificent in those highlights I posted. Such style!\n\nIn terms of introducing shots, I know you did bring up reverse sweeps, but it is a modern shot they wouldn't have dreamed of playing in those days prior to helmets and really any decent protections. Gloves and pads weren't very good back them, I own a pair of gloves from the 1930s that I brought from an auction a few years back... one that were used at first class level and they weren't much better than paper gloves.\n\nOnce again we're going around in circles, I maintain that in any sport, things change, technology gets better, and it's no different in track athletics, swimming, boxing, whatever sports you wish to name.\n\nBy your logic, the great legendary sprinter Jesse Owen wasn't even worth discussing today, because he only ran the 100 meter in about 10.10 seconds, and wouldn't have even come 4th in the last olympics, but fortunately most people recognise the difference across eras, and therefore in establishing greatness, they look at how these sportsmen of yesterday year went against their competition in their era.\n\nAs I've said before, Babe Ruth is still known as possibly the greatest ever baseballer of all time... you go look at old footage, he looks chubby and nonathletic compared to pro baseballers today. Just as Tendulkar will look like a nonathlete in 50 years. But fortunately people in 50 years will be smart enough to judge Tendulkar on how he competed with his opposition in his era, they won't try to compare him against year 2050 bowlers.\n\nOn the contrary, I thought Hayden was magnificent to watch, I prefer tall batsmen, I'm sure it's just a personal thing.\n\nAnd I've no problem if you thought Tendulkar was great to watch, & you thionk Hobbs, Hutton, Bradman etc weren't. That's called personal preference.\n\nI thought Hutton in particular was magnificent in those highlights I posted. Such style!\n\nTopic is not about aesthetics. Topic is about batting technique. To most people it is obvious that Hobbs pocesses a very poor technique that will not work in modern times. It appears you disagree. If so please explain in proper Technical terms why you feel that way.\n\nIn terms of introducing shots, I know you did bring up reverse sweeps, but it is a modern shot they wouldn't have dreamed of playing in those days prior to helmets and really any decent protections. Gloves and pads weren't very good back them, I own a pair of gloves from the 1930s that I brought from an auction a few years back... one that were used at first class level and they weren't much better than paper gloves.\n\nAgain ... who is talking about Helmets and the shots that they supposedly make possible just because a batsman wears a helmet ? I NEVER even mentioned any of that. Talk about the shots and the Technique that Hobbs is using to play and the exact same shots played by a modern player. Since he is playing a spinner in that video clip the helmet really is a classic red-herring that you have managed to introduce.\n\nSo once again ... who in today's ERA plays a spinner like Hobbs does ? How can you possibly pretend that he looks like a proper Test batsman (and a classy one at that !!) .\n\nOnce again we're going around in circles, I maintain that in any sport, things change, technology gets better, and it's no different in track athletics, swimming, boxing, whatever sports you wish to name.\n\nBy your logic, the great legendary sprinter Jesse Owen wasn't even worth discussing today, because he only ran the 100 meter in about 10.10 seconds, and wouldn't have even come 4th in the last olympics, but fortunately most people recognise the difference across eras, and therefore in establishing greatness, they look at how these sportsmen of yesterday year went against their competition in their era.\n\nAs I've said before, Babe Ruth is still known as possibly the greatest ever baseballer of all time... you go look at old footage, he looks chubby and nonathletic compared to pro baseballers today.

But fortunately people in 50 years will be smart enough to judge Tendulkar on how he competed with his opposition in his era, they won't try to compare him against year 2050 bowlers.\n\nSee above ... I never even talked about technology. Just pure batting technique. So with no further tip-toeing around the topic I hope you will for once answer my question using proper technical explanation to elaborate on how Hobbs looks like a proper Test batsman and not try to divert the topic to Helmets, Gloves, technology and what have you.\n\nTopic is not about aesthetics. Topic is about batting technique. To most people it is obvious that Hobbs pocesses a very poor technique that will not work in modern times. It appears you disagree. If so please explain in proper Technical terms why you feel that way.\n\n.\n\nSorry, when did you start caring what 'most' cricket experts think? You've been arguing for the last month that Tendulkar is somehow comparable to Bradman, something that is only believed by a decent number of people in Asia. So it's interesting you'll bring up what most people may think of old footage.\n\nTechniques evolve, just like running styles evolve, baseball hitting has evolved, and just like techniques especially in short form cricket have evolved greatly in just the last 3-4 years since Tendulkar retired.\n\nI'm not sure the bat-lifts could have been quite so high from Hobbs/Hutton's time if they were against faster bowlers, so that might have to be different for those players to face today's conditions, but the irony here is you're making such a fuss about techniques, when it's only be the last 10-20 years or so that the common consensus is that there's is NO longer a correct technique... it's whatever works.\n\nRemind yourself how Chanderpaul bats for example. So yes I agree the techniques looked a little different, but that doesn't mean to say they wouldn't have been able to adapt had they needed to.\n\nOnce again, you've failed to address the point of other sports and whether we should just have this universal rule that says any sportsman in any sport from more than 50 years ago (and you've yet to establish your magic cut-off point when cricket suddenly became competitive in your eyes & when we could recognise a past players as being any good ) should be discarded from comparisons with modern players, because it was a different era.\n\nFor the 1000th time, whether you happen to like it or not, greatness in sport has always been about how sportsmen competing against the best competition in their era.\n\nThe reason Mohammad Ali is still universally considered the greatest boxer of all time, Babe Ruth the greatest baseballer & Bradman the greatest batsmen.\n\nYou wanting to somehow recreate things using a time machine & plonking Bradman in a 1990s Test match doesn't work.\n\nBut don't let me stop you from making your won rules and simply discounting past sportsmen as inferior because they played a long time ago & that you spot differences in their techniques.\n\nSorry, when did you start caring what 'most' cricket experts think?

Whereas Iam very comfortable in dissecting Hobbs technique based on what I see and I am pretty sure you will keep dodging the topic never once directly addressing the issue.\n\nSo let me know if you want me to explain why he had poor technique. And I will do that using widely accepted cricketing conventions. Pretty sure you cant do the same which is why you try to nudge the discussion into different directions where your position is more defend-able.\n\nI'm not sure the bat-lifts could have been quite so high from Hobbs/Hutton's time if they were against faster bowlers, so that might have to be different for those players to face today's conditions, but the irony here is you're making such a fuss about techniques, when it's only be the last 10-20 years or so that the common consensus is that there's is NO longer a correct technique... it's whatever works.\n\nYes there is ... just recently Kohli explained all the minute adjustments he had to make in his game. All the top players still aspire to play with proper techniques. Yes there are those with un-conventional techniques but they get away with it due to their superior hand-eye co-ordination.\n\nRemind yourself how Chanderpaul bats for example.

This is where I disagree and start asking some awkward questions ... for example why doesnt anybody try to copy Hobbs technique if he was such a Gun player and that technique lead him to be ranked amongst top 3 players of the entire 20th century ?\n\nI don't (and I never used the word \"Expert\" in that post you quoted ) its just that you would rather go by what the Herd says you to do.

Compare Steve Smith to Chanderpaul to Tendulkar, and you have 3 entirely different techniques.\n\nI cited you 100 cricket experts from all over the world who made up the 100 voting for player of the century, I provided you their names and countries they're from & and 90% voted Sobers as the best allrounder & just 13% voted Imran for that side. So I do find it amusing that you want to ignore their opinion and tell me I'm following the herd, and then meanwhile you want to ask me what others think about Hobb's techniques.\n\nIf you can't see the irony there of discounting cricket 'experts' (a term I'll use) and a bunch of people on an asian website (who in a recent poll rated Younus khan the best current batsman in the world lol) then I don't think I can help any further.\n\nI noticed you're still yet to address the point about your outlook logically suggesting that greats of other sports like Jesse Owens and great sprinter, Mohammad Ali, the greatest boxer & Bath Ruth the greatest baseballer should all be discounted because when looking back at old footage they don't look quite as athletic and there techniques look a little different.\n\nI'll say it again, I thought that footage of Hutton from 1938 in particular showed a guy with a superb technique. I will concede one point though, and that is generally the players from the 1930s-40s (Bradmans era) definitely didn't look as athletic, but guess what, neither to players of the late 80s & 90s look athletic compared with those of today. This is obvious and the same across all sports, it doesn't follow that it makes past athletes any worse comparatively."
