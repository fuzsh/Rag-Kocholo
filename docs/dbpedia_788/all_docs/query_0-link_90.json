        "text": "Featured\n\nWR2 Theory: Cashing In\n\nHappy 4th anniversary to the WR2 Theory!!\n\nOver the last three years, I have utilized the WR2 Theory drafting strategy to win multiple fantasy football leagues and most importantly, thousands of dollars in prize money. In 2022 alone, I won 3 of 5 PPR leagues I played in and close to 2K.\n\nLast season, Jaylen Waddle, Devonta Smith, Tyler Lockett, and Brandon Aiyuk were all drafted as the WR2 on their team. Each projected outside the top 20 and finished as the overall WR8, WR9, WR13, and WR15, respectively. Time to adjust the ranks on how we think about drafting wide receivers.\n\nHistorically there has sooo much wide receiver value hiding in plain sight in your fantasy drafts. If you know what you are looking for though, you can make the strategic picks to evaluate your fantasy squad above your league mates and bring home the fantasy championship.\n\nBelow I break down the history of WR2 Theory, explain the process (trust it) that I use to evaluate potential WR2s each season, and then state my case for the WR2 Theory class of 2023.\n\nWR2 Theory Origin Story\n\nEveryone loves a good origin story. If you don’t, just scroll past to get to the analytics.\n\nThree years ago WR2 Theory was officially launched into the fantasy football ether. If you missed the origin story, WR2 Theory’s roots can be traced to a brief-but-meaningful Twitter exchange with JJ Zachariason in February 2020. JJ posted a tweet asking for questions for his Late-Round Podcast mailbag. All the stars aligned as I stumbled upon it and posted a question that I had been mulling over the last few seasons. Simply put, I wanted to know how accurately we (as the fantasy community) were at successfully predicting which wide receiver finished the season as the WR1 on their own team. I was sure that this question had already been answered by fantasy football analysts and if JJ could just kindly push me in the right direction, I could get that info and get on with winning all my leagues….in February….don’t judge me.\n\nAfter talking to JJ, it quickly became apparent that the easy answers I was seeking were not readily available to be effortlessly plucked from the fantasy football tree of knowledge. If my question was going to be answered, I was gonna need to take the fantasy stats into my own hands. I started immediately and haven’t looked back!!!\n\nMy Process\n\nI began by pouring over the last eight seasons of WR ADP data and then compared it to the end-of-the-season wide receiver rankings. Next, I filtered that data through the vacated targets tool to see if there was a correlation between breakout WRs and vacated targets.\n\nAfterward, I studied the team-specific factors and circumstances to identify and document the conditions that led to the shift in the WR value for each team. Finally, I created the “criteria for success” that incorporated all of the key data points and then used them to determine WR2 breakout candidates for 2023.\n\nAs I dug further into the data, I started to see a pattern emerge. Each year there are wide receivers that are routinely undervalued and outperform their ADP. In 2021, Cooper Kupp, Deebo Samuel, Ja’Marr Chase, Darnell Mooney, and Christian Kirk, were all drafted as the WR2 on their respective teams and finished as the WR1.\n\nAgain in 2022, Tyler Lockett, Brandon Aiyuk, Jerry Jeudy, Mike Williams Chris Olave, and Garrett Wilson all were drafted as the respective WR2s on their teams and you already know how this ends, they finished as the WR1 on their teams.\n\nYou don’t have to be Nimble with Numbers to see the discrepancy between consensus wide receiver ADP and true wide receiver value. The question then becomes, how do we identify the next WR2 to become a WR1 or the WR3 who will greatly outperform their ADP?\n\nWR2 Theory Criteria for Success\n\nEvery evaluation/prediction process needs criteria for success. Here is mine:\n\nVacated Targets: Targets that are available in an offense.\n\nHigh Volume Passing Offenses: Offenses that consistently/historically see an increased percentage of passing volume when compared to the league average.\n\nEmerging Talent/Rookies: The infusion of talented younger players into offensive schemes.\n\nInjuries: Increased workload due to injury to a teammate.\n\nVacated Targets\n\nOne important tool that I used to help me identify potential WRs who fit into the WR2 Theory was the 2021 vacated target data. Here is the list of 2023 vacated targets brought to you by John Daigle from 4for4 (@notJDaigle on Twitter).\n\nI updated it with color graphics and made it sortable and accessible here. My colleagues in the fantasy football community don’t believe vacated targets exist and yet here we are talking about them and now you are thinking about them, so…\n\nA Passing League\n\nIt is undeniable that the NFL has become a passing league. Last year a RECORD eight teams featured at least two wide receivers who finished in the fantasy top 36. Explosive Offenses: Over the last eight years the following teams supported two top-36 WRs.\n\nEmerging Talent/Rookies\n\nThe common-sense wisdom in redraft leagues has always been to wait on rookie wide receivers, who typically are unreliable and break out later on in year two or three. In 2020, Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb, and Chase Claypool turned that thinking on its head, with Jefferson finishing as a WR1 and Lamb and Claypool as WR2s. In 2021, Ja’Marr Chase scored over 300 fantasy points and Jaylen Waddle finished as the WR13, scoring 245 points.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, Jaylen Waddle, and Devonta Smith all elevated their game heading into their sophomore seasons. All three were being drafted outside the top 25 and all finished as top 10 wide receivers in 2022.\n\nThe 2021 & 2022 NFL wide receiver classes were stacked with talent and they did not disappoint. Here is the list of rookie and second-year WRs who finished in the top-36 in 2022 (bold indicates 2022 rookie).\n\n2023 WR2 Candidates\n\nThis year WR2 Theory candidates are broken up into four tiers based on their potential fantasy ceilings. I’m prioritizing Tier 1 and 2 WRs in my drafts. Tier 3 and 4 are later round depth and bye-week support.\n\nTier 1 – Top 12 WR – WR1 Potential – Studs to Building Your Team Around\n\nTier 2 – Top 24 WR – WR2 Potential – Solid Weekly Starters\n\nTier 3 – Top 36 WR – WR3 Potential – Weekly Flex Options\n\nTier 4 – Top 48 WR – WR4 Potential – Bye Week and Injury Depth\n\nHere are my 2023 WR2 Theory break-out candidates identified by round. All 2023 ADP rankings come directly from 4for4’s ADP tool and are based on a 12-Team PPR league.\n\nTier 1 – Rounds 2–5 – STUDS\n\nJaylen Waddle – Miami Dolphins – WR11\n\nJaylen Waddle well outperformed his WR19 ADP last year, finishing as the WR8 in PPR formats. The acquisition of wide receiver Tyreek Hill from the Kansas City Chiefs last offseason was a game change for Waddle. His yards per reception nearly doubled from 9.8 to 18.1. The Mayor of Miami approves!\n\nDespite losing 24 targets and close to 30 receptions, Waddle added 345 receiving yards and two touchdowns compared to his rookie season. Waddle is currently being drafted at the end of the second round/beginning of the third round with other wide receivers Devonta Smith, Chris Olave, and DK Metcalf.\n\nOut of this group, Smith is the only wide receiver I am targeting before Waddle. Olave has to worry about a resurgent Michael Thomas slanting over his shoulder and can you really trust DK Metcalf after he literally pooped himself last season and only averaged 13.8 FPG?\n\nThe floor is safe for Waddle and the ceiling is anything but safe in this explosive Dolphins offense. Waddle scored 15 or more fantasy points eight times last year, including both a 30-point and a 40-point outburst. His running mate Hill scored 22 or more points eight times last year. There will be points, and potentially blood…\n\nThe only issue I have with Waddle whatsoever is the health and durability of Tua. The 2022 splits with Tua and without Tua favored Tyreek Hill, like you would expect. In this scenario, Waddle becomes more of a weekly WR2 or WR3. Fingers crossed Tua’s electric left arm returns for the 2023 season and we see more Waddle dances in the endzone.\n\nDeVonta Smith – Philadelphia Eagles – WR12\n\nSimply put, DeVonta Smith is my Matthew Berry “Ride or Die” and my personal favorite WR2 Theory Candidate for the upcoming 2023 season. Shout out to the GOAT, TMR, for the quote tweet and for believing in Smith this season.\n\nMy reasoning for loving Smith is simple. In the last 10 games of the 2022 season, grown-ass man A.J. Brown averaged 16.5 FPG and Smith averaged 17.6 FPG. I know right. They tried to slip one by us there. Tricky. Tricky.\n\nSmith is the perfect WR2 Theory fit given the Eagles’ high-scoring offense and their propensity to successfully move the ball down the field and to end drives with touchdowns. The Eagles’ 59 touchdowns were second to only the Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs’ 61 in 2022.\n\nSmith’s second-season glow-up was noticeable. He added 30 receptions, 300 receiving yards, and two touchdowns to his rookie totals. Now the Slim Reaper is poised to take the next step and elevate his game to weekly WR1 potential.\n\nHoward Bender agreed with me at the Fantasy Football Expo panel discussion, picking Smith as the most likely WR2 candidate to finish the 2023 season as the WR1 on their team. Let it be written, let it be done. Howard is my guy! I also wanted to point out for the record that at the FF Expo panel discussion, Jeff Ratcliffe gave us all “ZERO GUYS.” LOL\n\nTee Higgins – Cinncinati Bengals – WR13\n\nTee Higgins disappointed fantasy drafters last season, failing to live up to his WR13 ADP, finishing as the WR19 averaging 13.8 FPG. In the last three seasons, he has seen 108, 110, and 109 targets. Two straight years of 74 receptions and just under 1,100 yards. Despite similar numbers from 2021, Higgins’s FPG dropped from 15.6 in 2021 to 13.8 last year.\n\nHiggins was consistent for the most part last season though, scoring 10 or more points in 12 of 16 games played. He also scored 19 or more points five times. There were two games he posted zero points, which left fantasy managers on MEGA TILT! I should know, I drafted Higgins on three of my league-winning squads. LOL\n\nHiggins enters the 2023 season on the last year of his rookie deal and is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the league year. Expect Higgins to be showing out this season as he chases a new long-term contract. The Joe Burrow calf injury should further depress Higgins ADP heading into your fantasy drafts.\n\nI expect Higgins to rebound and average closer to 15 than the 13 points he averaged last year. Higgins is due for some positive touchdown regression as well after posting seasons with six, six, and seven. Ja’Marr Chase has 22 touchdowns in the last two seasons, compared to only 13 for Higgins. That trend should balance out this season.\n\nI’m targeting Jaylen Waddle and DeVonta Smith over Tee Higgins in Tier 1. If I can draft two of three from this group, I will be extremely confident in my weekly wide receiver floor and ecstatic about their potential weekly ceiling.\n\nTier 2 – Rounds 6–8 – STARTERS\n\nChristian Kirk – Jacksonville Jaguars – WR27\n\nLast year Christian Kirk was the WR13. He was being drafted as the WR40. I’ll give you a second to process that. Fast forward to 2023 and the Jaguars’ offseason signing of Calvin Ridley has pushed Kirk back down the ADP charts to WR27.\n\nRidley is being drafted as the WR16 this season. Which seems high to me, and most others in the fantasy industry as well. But the people want what the people want, so they give it to themselves. LOL\n\nRidley being given the WR1 crown by drafters is not totally surprising given his previous fantasy football performances as an Atlanta Falcon, but being drafted three rounds in front of Kirk does not make any sense. Kirk’s 494 slot snaps were 3rd most of any wide receiver last season. The previous time Ridley suited up in 2021, he ranked 149th in slot snaps.\n\nKirk might see a slight target share dip, but he ran 518 routes last year, the 19th most in the NFL. He won’t be losing any significant slot routes to Ridley this season. If anything, Ridley’s presence on the outside might provide Kirk with more space to make plays underneath. Kirk might be the safest most reliable WR2 Theory candidate I put forth this season.\n\nChristian Kirk at the beginning of the 7th round isn’t a sexy pick that will leave you all High-T’d up, ready to run through a wedge block. But, he will be a tremendous value finishing in the WR2/3 range each week. I have him projected to finish as the WR22, which means you are stealing points if you draft him in the WR27 range.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk – San Francisco 49ers – WR28\n\nLast year Brandon Aiyuk was drafted around the 90th pick in PPR drafts compared to Deebo Samuel, who was picked 19th overall. The 71-pick gap turned out to be a landmine for fantasy drafters. Aiyuk, went on to lead the San Francisco 49ers in fantasy points for wide receivers, out-sourcing Deebo by 60 points.\n\nThis is a perfect example of the fantasy community overvaluing the WR1 from the previous season, and undervaluing the WR2. These ADP gaps create loads of opportunities for drafters willing to wait on value instead of reaching for a player’s ceiling. Shocker. It’s happening again this year.\n\nDeebo is being drafted as the WR17 and Aiyuk as the WR28. The 30-40 pick gap between them this year is a head-scratcher. I love Deebo, but that ADP gap is approaching Michael Strahan levels here.\n\nBefore the 49ers traded for Christian McCaffery, Deebo was averaging 15.2 FPG. After the CMC trade, he averaged 11 FPG, compared to Aiyuk who averaged 12.6 FPG before the trade and 15.2 FPG after. Oh, how the tables have turned.\n\nNo surprise the fantasy football masses still are behind the trend on Aiyuk. In the last six years, the WR28 has scored 190.4 fantasy points on average. Aiyuk scored 227.8 fantasy points.\n\nEven if he has a down year and scores 25 fewer points, the floor is rock solid. The ceiling though is WR15, which he achieved last season. If you pass on Aiyuk’s late 6th-round value, you might be allergic to winning your fantasy league.\n\nTyler Lockett – Seattle Seahawks – WR30\n\nThe fantasy football Community has Tyler Lockett Amnesia every single year. It’s quite remarkable really. Last season he was drafted as the WR45 and DK Metcalf was drafted as the WR20. That is 60 full picks before Lockett (that’s 5 full rounds later for all you English majors). Lockett went on to outscore Metcalf and finished 2022 as the WR13.\n\nFast forward to 2023 and Metcalf is being drafted as the WR15 and Lockett as the WR30. Half the size for half the price. Tyler Lockett might be 30 years old, but he hasn’t actually taken a hit since the Obama administration and looked “ELITE” last year dusting cornerbacks for long touchdowns repeatedly.\n\nThe addition of Jaxon Smith-Njigba to the mix has scared drafters off of Lockett, but not Metcalf. Interesting. Realistically, Metcalf has the most to lose, as he led the Seahawks in targets with 141 to Lockett’s 117 last year. Lockett was more efficient with less, converting 71.8% of his targets to only 63.8% for Metcalf. Lockett also led the team in receiving touchdowns, yards per reception, and yards per target.\n\nDuring a recent draft I participated in at the Fantasy Football Expo, Jaxon Smith-Njigba was drafted at the end of the 6th round and Lockett fell to the last pick in the 7th. I would not be surprised at all if Lockett falls in home league drafts again this year, making him one of the most dependable WR2 Theory candidates in the mid-rounds.\n\nGeorge Pickens – Pittsburgh Steelers – WR33\n\nLast season Steelers wide receiver Diontea Johnson had 63 more targets than George Pickens and only outscored him by 15 fantasy points. Think about that for a second and try to not let your head explode. If you’re still with me, and your head hasn’t exploded, think about it again.\n\nIf your head still hasn’t exploded, think about the fact that George Pickens is still being drafted behind Diontae Johnson right now, this very second. If your head still hasn’t exploded, think about one of his sensational one-handed catches from one of those preseason Twitter videos. if your head still hasn’t exploded think about Kenny Pickett, The Immortal God rising from the Phoenix of the ashes of last season to be QB1… Okay I’ve gone too far, but you get it.\n\nSure, Diontae Johnson will catch a touchdown this year, but George Pickens will catch more touchdowns this year. He should also see more targets this year and Ryan Clark said he was more talented than Justin Jefferson so…. George Pickens! George Pickens! George Pickens! George Pickens!\n\nI can’t say it enough. George Pickens over Diontae Johnson!\n\nI will draft him all day long\n\nI will draft him in a thong\n\nI will draft him it’s never wrong\n\nI will draft him while I sing this song\n\nhitting my bong\n\nFlexing my internet muscles\n\nFeeling so strong\n\nIt’s been George Pickens all along!\n\nJahan Dotson – Washington Commanders – WR36\n\nJahan Dotson burst onto the NFL scene last season scoring four touchdowns in his first three games. An injury sidelined him for six games last season, derailing his hot start to the season. He finished the season strong, averaging 14.7 FPG over his final five games, finding the endzone three more times.\n\nThe WR1 for the Washington Commanders, “Scary” Terry McLaurin averaged 13.5 FPG and only scored five touchdowns in 17 games. Dotson’s scored seven touchdowns in 12 games. Both interesting and curious. McLaurin only averaged 2.4 more points per game despite seeing 120 targets to only 61 for Dotoson.\n\nCurrently, Dotson is being drafted three-to-four rounds later than McLaurin. I will not be surprised if next year we are not drafting them one-to-two rounds apart instead. Dotson is poised to explode into his second season and the fantasy drafters are ready.\n\nHis ADP is high, but the talent and opportunity warrant it. Sam Howell excelled at slinging the deep ball in college, which matches perfectly with Dotson’s 4.43 speed. His 16 deep targets ranked 32nd last season. Terry McLaurin’s 30 deep targets ranked 4th. I expect that gap to shrink this season, which means increased opportunities for Dotson.\n\nDotson has the skill set to separate from defenders and cash in for your fantasy team. According to the WR guru himself, Matt Harmon at Reception Perception, Dotson’s had a 70% or better success rate on every route except two last season. Dotson is a GRONK smash pick this year.\n\nTier 3 – Rounds 8-10 – FLEX\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba – Seattle Seahawks – WR37\n\nFantasy writer and analyst for Fantasy Pros, Bo McBrayer, AKA the King of Spice Bo_McBigTime on Twitter, is all in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba in 2023. During his appearance on the NimblewNumbers WR2 Theory podcast, Bo said, “JSN is going to be open all over the field. He is going to win the middle of the field. All the things that Amon Ra does great, JSN does them better.”\n\nHigh praise for the wide receiver currently being drafted as the WR3 on the Seattle Seahawks. I agree with Bo though. Pete Carroll knows what he is doing with his offense. Bringing in one of the best college wide receivers to support the fantasy surprise of 2022, Geno Smith sounds too good to be true. It isn’t.\n\nSmith finished the 2022 season as the QB5, throwing for 30 touchdowns and over 4,200 passing yards. Adding JSN, only makes him more dangeRuss. I don’t expect JSN to be peppered with targets like Lockett and DK, but his targets should be high-value and directed downfield where he will be able to create space after the catch.\n\nCurrently, JSN is being drafted near his ceiling as WR37. Remember though, ADP is a lie. If you are in a draft with Bo, you have no shot at JSN, but thankfully there is always your home league where he will probably slip.\n\nJordan Addison – Minnesota Vikings – WR38\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings moved on from old man Adam Thielen in the offseason. and almost like it was their plan all along they drafted the stud first-round wide receiver Jordan Addison to take his place. Sound familiar?\n\nAddison enters the NFL with a chip on his shoulder after the 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was bypassed in the NFL draft not once, not twice, but three times in a row! Watching Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Quentin Johnston, and Zay Flowers go off in front of him had to sting a bit. The prospect of running routes alongside Justin Jefferson though might even it all out in the end.\n\nAddison plugs into a Minnesota Vikings offense that has close to 110 targets available. K.J. Osborn will be involved in the Vikings’ passing game and might even outscore Addison in the first few weeks of the season. But don’t lose heart fantasy drafter, his time will come.\n\nLike many rookie wide receivers, look for Addison to heat up as the season progresses and he becomes more familiar with Minnesota’s playbook and refines his route tree. Justin Jefferson started 4.6 and 7.4 his first two weeks of his career, so don’t overreact too much if he’s not catching touchdowns like Adam Thielen immediately.\n\nGabriel Davis – Buffalo Bills – WR39\n\nGabe Davis truthers are still reeling in the graves they dug for themselves last year to hide from his WR35 finish. The hype from his four-touchdown performance in the 2021 playoff game against the Chiefs vaulted him to WR26 in 2022 drafts. Wild times, right?\n\nHis ADP came crashing back to earth this summer and he is currently being drafted in the WR39 range. Here’s the thing, last year Davis averaged 11.4 fantasy points per game. The 39th-ranked player in fantasy points per game averaged 11.4 points per game and also happened to be Davis. This means that he is currently being drafted at his absolute floor.\n\nThe market is still skittish after being roasted last season which means that there is value to be had. Gabe Davis is not the league winner we thought he was last season, but he won’t cost you your draft either. I am comfortable drafting Davis in the 8th round and starting him as my WR3/4 this season.\n\nMichael Thomas – New Orleans Saints – WR41\n\nThe only group of truthers down bigger than the aforementioned Gabe Davis truthers are Michael Thomas truthers. I am sure a few egomaniacs are clinging to wifi life in a public library muttering Thomas’s name under their breath as they map out his phoenix-like rise to fantasy resplendence.\n\nThomas only has 56 receptions since he set the single-season receiving record of 149 in 2019. Despite having only been four seasons ago, it feels like a lifetime since Thomas has had any fantasy relevance. He’s only played in 10 out of the last 49 regular season games for the Saints.\n\nReports out of Saints training camp though are that Thomas is completely healthy and back to his dominant “slant boy” self. Great news for Saint’s new quarterback Derek Carr and the Saints’ offense. The QB/WR duo has been firing on all cylinders in their joint practice sessions. Evening creating separation and making it look easy agaisnt the NFL’s top safety, Derwin James.\n\nMichael Thomas is being drafted as the WR41 this season. The average WR41 over the last five seasons has scored 11.2 FPG. Thomas has never averaged less than 12 FPG per game in his career. His 9th-round ADP stands out as a screaming value for a WR with top-24 potential each week. I’m back on Michael Thomas!!\n\nQuentin Johnston – Los Angeles Chargers – WR45\n\nLast year Justin Herbert finished the season as QB11, averaging 16.4 FGP. This was behind perennial prime-time disappointment Kirk Cousins, fifth-year option-less (at the time) Daniel Jones, and Christen Harper’s boyfriend, Jared Goff. Ouch.\n\nThe former natives of beautiful San Diego, which we all know means “a whale’s vagina” were restless this offseason. The Chargers fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Shane Day after two mediocre seasons.\n\nKellen Moore is now helming the offensive coordinator position for the Chargers and expectations for Justin Herbert are once again sky-high. Adding intrigue to the equation, the Chargers drafted stud wide receiver, Quentin Johnston out of TCU with the 21st pick in the first round.\n\nMany people are saying it’s “curious” Given the fact that Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are still on the team. Denny Carter from NBC’s Rotoworld said the following when he joined my WR2 Theory podcast earlier this summer.\n\n“If you are high on Justin Herbert in this new Kellen Moore offense, he should be more aggressive with downfield throwing. If you think Justin Herbert is going to have a big year, then you necessarily probably have to be high on Quentin Johnston’s ADP.”\n\nInjuries to both Mike Williams and Keenan Allen have limited Herbert’s overall effectiveness over the past two seasons. Denny Carter says what we are all thinking. “I can envision a scenario where Mike Williams misses some time and Quentin Johnston gets funneled Targets on the outside as the main boundary receiver for Justin Herbert and so…if I think Herbert is going to throw a lot of touchdowns, Keenan Allen isn’t going to catch alllll of them, so I have to be high on him (Johnston).”\n\nAccording to Jack Deignan of Chargers ClutchPoints.com, “Updates out of Chargers training camp consistently indicate that his size and strength has been a problem for defenders on the roster, and Justin Herbert has been taking advantage. Herbert himself has praised Johnston for quickly asserting himself and showing why he was a first-round pick, and Herbert believes that he can be a true asset in his rookie season.”\n\nSkyy Moore – Kansas City Chiefs – WR48\n\nShocker!! Kadarius Toney is OUT. The Kansas City wide receiver was hurt on the very first practice of training camp. Andy Reid revealed that Toney suffered a torn Meniscus, but is expected to be ready at the start of the NFL season. My advice? Don’t hold your breath waiting for Toney’s return, because you might run out of oxygen, leaving your fantasy team on life support.\n\nInstead of an oft-injured Toney, could I interest you in some Skyy Moore? Sure last year’s rookie fantasy campaign scoring 43.3 total fantasy points mirrored that of Marco Rubio’s presidential run, non-existent. The good news is that JuJu TikTok-Shuster and Mecole “Ricola” Hardman have moved onto other crappier teams, leaving more opportunities for the second-year wide receiver.\n\nAccording to Nate Christensen of ArrowheadPride.com, “Moore is going to be asked to be the Chiefs’ No. 1 wide receiver going into the season — a cosmic leap from the role he had in his rookie season.” Comparisons have been made to longtime Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb. Christensen writes, “Similar to Cobb, Moore was stuck in a deep wide receiver rotation his rookie year, which limited his productivity. Once opportunities opened in his second year, however, Cobb excelled.”\n\nA Randall Cobb-like ascension would be nice, but I am tempering my expectations just a bit. The 135 targets up for grabs in the Chiefs’ offense won’t all be going Moore’s way, but he should see close to 90-100 in his current role. The Chiefs’ offense has been perennial atop the NFL as Mahomes has racked up touchdown after touchdown. Travis Kecle can’t catch them all!\n\nTier 4 – Rounds 10-16 – DEPTH\n\nAllen Lazard – New York Jets – WR56\n\nAaron Rodgers went into the darkness this offseason and in that darkness, he saw a beast flash in the shadows. Rodgers was scared but also aroused. Just like he likes it. As he approached the monster he realized it was just 6’5” 230lbs Allen Lazard running routes on a foggy football field. He called out to him, “It’s me, hi I’m the problem, it’s me.” Allen called back, “Why are you naked?” Rodgers smiled widely and they laughed and laughed all the way to the New York Jets.\n\nBut for real, Aaron Rodgers literally brought all his besties from the Packers with him to the Jets this past offseason, including Allen “Grown-Ass Man” Lazard. Garrett Wilson is the clear alpha wide receiver on the team, but Alan Lazard is too much of a man-beast to be ignored in fantasy. He finished the 2022 NFL season as fantasy WR34, averaging 11.7 FPG.\n\nHe’s currently being drafted as the WR54 at the end of the 11th round. I don’t expect Lazard to compete with Garrett Wilson for WR1 status this season but the ADP gap between the two is just ridiculous. Last year the WR54 scored 7.1 FPG and only amassed 122.4 fantasy points. The value is baked right into Lazard’s absurdly low ADP.\n\nI will definitely be drafting Allen Lazard (just drafted him in a PPR league at the (Fantasy Football Expo) for WR depth and as a viable bye-week fill-in. I am not expecting Lazard to be a league winner, but he should outperform his ADP and be a solid contributor when needed this season.\n\nRomeo Doubs – Green Bay Packers – WR60\n\nRomeo! Oh, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? No this isn’t Shakespeare. It’s me looking for Romeo Doubs ADP…\n\nscanning…\n\nOh, there it is!\n\nI found it… WR60.\n\nThat’s just absurd given that the Packers wide receiver room lost Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb to the New York Jets. According to Not John Daigle, the Packers have over 70% of their 2023 targets available.\n\nExpectation is the root of all heartache and currently Christian Watson is being drafted as the overall WR23, eight rounds before Doubs. I love Watson this year, but I will be taking the later-round Doubs every single time at his 13.08 ADP.\n\nDenny Carter, @CdCarter13 on Twitter (I refuse to ever call it anything else) spoke on the ADP disparity. “You know could speak to him (Doubs) being either neck and neck with Christian Watson as the top wide receiver for the Packers or maybe even just the WR1 for the Packers. According to Next Gen stats, Romeo Dobbs had by far the best separation numbers among Green Bay whiteouts in 2022 and you know he doesn’t rely on the huge play like Christian Watson.”\n\nRemember that pleasure and action make the hours seem short, but a fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool. I’m buying what Denny is selling and drafting Doubs as a late-round wide receiver.\n\nAs fantasy drafts approach I implore you, once more into the breach, dear friends, once more WR2Theory and remember this above all; to thine own self be true.\n\nVan Jefferson – Los Angeles Rams – WR79\n\nLast season Allen Robinson was drafted at the end of the third round. I laughed when someone who shall remain nameless in my home league, named Ben, picked him at the 3.11. Oh, the horror! LOL\n\nWith that being said, Van Jefferson, the WR2 on the Rams is currently being drafted as the WR79, which means he is not really being drafted at all. When Jefferson was healthy in 2021 he scored 168 fantasy points and finished as WR36 overall.\n\nThere is plenty of Puka Nacua training camp hype to navigate, but I am confident that Jefferson will be a waiver wire add the first few weeks of the season. With Cooper Kupp nursing a hamstring injury, Jefferson is reaping the reps with Matthew Stafford. His 15.6 yards per reception last year means big plays, exactly what you need from bye week back-ups.\n\nMy guy LaQuan Jones, states a great case for snagging him with one of your later-round picks. I respect LQ and trust his acumen as an L.A. Rams insider. I’m drafting Van.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 9! Each week Nimble GPP will bring you the plays to get you paid for DraftKings GPP. Excited to share all my “Nimble GPP” content with you all this year. Each week I will help you build the best GPP lineups by providing you the building blocks at each skill position by identifying “High Priced”, “Mid-Range”, and “Value” plays. The play represents the player I predict for the most upside at their price range. Mix and match the players you are high on and build your optimal lineup.\n\nIf you are interested in NIMBLE GPP Lineups or Bo McBrayer’s Cash Plays, check out all our content at NimblewNumbers.com .

Signup for a FREE RunTheSims account today!!\n\nHigh Priced – Quarterback\n\nKyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals – $7,400\n\nKyler Murray’s offense runs the most plays every week. On average he attempts 40.6 passes per game and rushes 6.4 times per game. He’s touching the ball on 67% of the plays. Since the return of DeAndre Hopkins in Week 7, Murray has averaged 23.4 points per game. In the previous six weeks, he had been averaging 20.8 points per game.\n\n166 of Murray’s 299 rushing yards have come in the last three games. His best rushing game of the season was agaisnt these same Seattle Seahawks in Week 6 when he rushed 10 times for 100 yards and the DraftKings rushing bonus. Murray hasn’t rushed for a score since Week 4, but that streak has a good chance of ending this week.\n\nStacking Murray with Hopkins is one of my favorite stacks of the week. It will be a popular stack given that there are only 10 games on the DraftKings main slate this week and Hopkins is relatively inexpensive. Running it back with Kenneth Walker III, who sliced up the Cardinals for 110 total yards and 19 DraftKings points in Week 6.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins – $6,700\n\nLast week Tua Tagovailoa torched a terrible Detroit Lions defense for 382 yards and three touchdowns. His wide receivers, Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle are ranked first and fifth in DraftKings points per game at 24 and 19.7. Last week they combined to score 68.1-points, helping Tua score 32 himself. The trio combined for 100 DraftKings points.\n\nTua will be priced over 7K in the very near future. His weapons are a little priced up, but with the target volume, the price is worth paying. The Bears’ defense on paper is much better than the Lions, but the last week they got lit up by the Dallas Cowboys offense for 42 points. I expect Tua and company to keep this game up-tempo despite the Bears’ best efforts. I’m comfortable rolling Tua stacked with either wide receiver, but not both this week.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nJustin Fields, Chicago Bears – $5,300\n\nIn the last three games, Justin Fields has scored 69.8 DraftKings points. Schwing!! Fields has scored the fifth most points during that stretch and has performances of 26, 24, and 19.7. The floor is becoming safe and we have yet to explore his ceiling. He leads all quarterbacks with 319 rushing yards in the last five games. He’s averaged 64 yards per game and has rushed for two scores. Adding a big-body wide receiver like Chase Claypool can’t hurt either.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins rank 21st against quarterbacks, giving up 18-points per game. Jared Goff lit them up last week, passing for 321 yards and a touchdown. This game has a 44-point total, but I am smashing the over. I expect a score more like 35-28 with lots of DraftKings points to be claimed. Running Fields naked is an option. Stacking him with Darnell Mooney is a cheap stack at only $10,000. Either way, Fields will be a staple of my GPP builds.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nAaron Jones, Green Bay Packers – $7,400\n\nAaron Jones is one of my favorite plays this week! The RunTheSims.com NFL optimizer likes him as well. He’s currently the second-highest projected running back on the slate with a base projection of 20.11 and a ceiling projection hovering around 32-points. He’s currently Green Bay’s second-leading receiver with 30 receptions.\n\nHis matchup this week might be the nuts. According to StatMuse.com, “Aaron Jones has 98 carries for 503 yards and has scored seven touchdowns in seven games versus the Lions in his career.” The last time Jones played the Lions in September of 2021, he scored four touchdowns, three receiving. Jones saw 25 touches and was the focal point of the Packers’ offense last week. He scored 22.7 DraftKings points despite failing to score a touchdown. He averaged 7.2 yards per rush and looked dominant.\n\nThe man is simply on another level at the moment. And in case you didn’t get the memo, the Lions are terrible against running backs. They have given up 11 rushing touchdowns and over 1,000 total yards to running backs. It’s officially Aaron Jones SZN!\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nTravis Etienne, Jacksonville Jaguars – $6,300\n\nTravis Etienne is the truth! Last week he rushed for 156 yards on 24 carries, averaging 6.5 yards per carry. He scored 28.2 DraftKings points and crushed his value at only $5,800. This week he’s priced up $500. His volume and efficiency still make him a tremendous value at $6,300.\n\nThe Raiders have been terrible against pass-catching running backs, giving up 436 receiving yards and three touchdowns in seven games. Yes, they already had their bye week. I expect the Jaguars to run all over the Raiders this week with Etienne leading the way offensively. Alvin Kamara gashed them last week for three scores,\n\nI’m hopeful Etienne picks up a rushing and a receiving score for the double touchdown dip. According to RunTheSims.com, his ceiling is over 31-points, making him a great GPP play in all formats this week.\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nCordarrelle Patterson, Atlanta Falcons – $5,800\n\nCordarrelle Patterson is eligible to return from the Atlanta Falcons Injured Reserve this week, leaving DFS sharps to beg the question, “what if Patterson is back?” I for one would be thrilled to see him return to his role of red zone touchdown vulture extraordinaire. Before getting injured in Week 4, Patterson had two 25-point games. He’s a boom-play this week if he returns to face the terrible Los Angeles Chargers rush defense.\n\nThe Chargers rank 31st against running backs, having given up close to 1,200 total yards and 10 touchdowns through seven games. The Falcons rush the ball 57% of the time, second most in the NFL this year. If Patterson gets the green light to play without any restrictions, he will be a staple in my GPP builds. If he’s on a pitch count, I still like him, but my exposure will probably be below the field.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nDeAndre Hopkins, Arizona Cardinals – $7,900\n\nSince returning from a bullshit PED suspension DeAndre Hopkins has looked electric! He is averaging over 30 DraftKings points per game and is still priced under 8K. They can’t boost his price fast enough. He should be $8,300 but was only priced up $500 this week instead of $900. Take the discount while you can and bet over the field this week.\n\nHopkins has seen 27 targets in two games and he should continue to see 10-12 targets every single game moving forward. The Arizona Cardinals lead the NFL averaging 70 plays per game. Murray is averaging 40.6 pass attempts per game. I can’t spell it out any simpler for you if my name was NimbewNumbers. I’m stacking Hopkins with Murray, but definitely feel comfortable playing him in a run-back stack with a few Seattle Seahawks players.\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nTyler Lockett, Seattle Seahawks – $6,100\n\nThe last time these two teams met back in Week 6, Tyler Lockett was held in check. He caught two of his five targets for 17 yards and only scored 1.7 DraftKings points. Lockett has seen eight targets the last two weeks and despite dropping a touchdown last week, scored 16.3 DraftKings points. He also caught a game-winning touchdown later in the game, so trust has been restored with Geno Smith.\n\nVegas loves this game! And so does my partner Mike “Cash” Collins from the Fantasy Millionaires (@FFMillionaires on Twitter). He made Lockett and Geno Smith his Gold Stack of the week. At only $11,900, this stack allows you to run it back with Hopkins or even Zach Ertz or Rondale Moore for $5,100. Did I mention that I will be game-stacking this game? Maybe you should as well.\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nZay Jones, Jacksonville Jaguars – $4,100\n\nZay Jones currently has only one less reception than Christian Kirk on the season and is $1,400 cheaper on DraftKings. Both wide receivers have favorable matchups against a bottom-third secondary that has given up over 1,100 yards receiving and six touchdowns to wide receivers. The 47.5-point game total is also very appealing. Where else can you find a wide receiver two on his team who is averaging 7 targets per game? Save yourself the research, because the answer is nowhere. Zay Jones might just be the lotto ticket you need to cash this week in GPP.\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nZach Ertz, Arizona Cardinals – $5,100\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals and the Seattle Seahawks will be seeing each other for the second time this season when they face off in Week 9. The last time they played was only three weeks ago. In that matchup, Ertz converted seven receptions on 10 targets into 70 yards and 14 DraftKings points.\n\nSince DeAndre Hopkins’ return in Week 7, Ertz has only seen nine total targets in two games. The good news for Ertz is that the Seattle Seahawks rank 32nd agaisnt tight ends, giving up over 20-points per game to the position. The Cardinals and Kliff Kingsbury are well aware of this and will exploit this mismatch. I’m most comfortable stacking Ertz with Murray or running him back in a game stack.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nGerald Everett, Los Angeles Chargers – $4,800\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers are hurting for pass catchers at the moment. Mike Williams is OUT for at least a month. Keenan Allen didn’t return to the game last week after tweaking his injured hamstring in the first half. Josh Palmer is still currently battling a concussion that calls his availability into question as well. As much as I like Everett as a pass-catching tight end, he legitimately might be the only eligible player for Justin Herbert to throw the ball to not named Austin Ekeler.\n\nSeriously though, I expect the Chargers to feed Everett in this matchup. The Atlanta Falcons rank 29th against the tight end, having given up over 550 yards receiving and a touchdown this year. Everett or bust in Week 9!\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nRobert Tonyan, Green Bay Packers – $3,800\n\nRobert Tonyan has 22 targets in his last three games, behind only Travis Kelce and Geroge Kittle. Aaron Rodgers has lost four straight games and this week’s tilt against the Detroit Lions is a must-win for him and the Packers. With Allen Lazard nursing an injury and Christian Watson in the NFL concussion protocol, Rodgers is desperate for trusted pass-catchers. The Lions rank 26th against the tight end position, giving up 15.5-points per game. I expect Tonyan to see 6-7 targets and have an opportunity for a touchdown in this potentially high-scoring game.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 8!

Signup for a FREE RunTheSims account today!!\n\nHigh Priced – Quarterback\n\nJalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles – $8,300\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are the only undefeated team in the NFL. They are coming off their bye week and are facing their in-state rivals the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are 2-5 and have looked anemic to be kind under rookie Kenny Pickett. Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are currently 10.5-point home favorites. The writing is all over the wall in this matchup that Hurts and company will have their way with the TJ “Less” Watt Steelers’ defense.\n\nHurts is the highest-priced quarterback on the main slate in Week 8 at $8,300. I would argue that he is worth every penny of his price tag in this matchup with the Steelers’ secondary that has given up the third-most passing yards to quarterbacks. Hurts’ RunTheSims.com “Boom” rate is 59.9% this week, the highest of any player on the slate. With weapons like AJ Brown, Devonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert, along with Hurts’ dual-threat ability as a runner, his upside is slate-breaking. Play him in all GPP formats.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins – $6,200\n\nThe Detroit Lions defense played better last week against the Cowboys, but they were coming off their bye week and facing Dak Prescott who was returning from an injury he suffered in Week 1 and truthfully did not look like himself. All that to say this secondary still sucks and this week will be heavily exploited by Tua Tagovailoa and his arsenal of elite wide receivers.\n\nTua returned from the concussion he suffered a few weeks back on Thursday Night Football against the Cincinnati Bengals, to pass for 261 and a touchdown last week. Now he has a Lions secondary that gives up 35 fantasy points to wide receivers on average per week. The Dolphins’ wide receivers aren’t average though. I love stacking an inexpensive Tau with either Tyreek Hill or Jaylen Waddle or doubling-stacking them both. The total for this game is 50.5-points, the highest on the main slate.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nDaniel Jones, New York Giants – $5,700\n\nDaniel Jones is quietly averaging 18-points per game is and the 10th leading scoring quarterback in DraftKings. This week he faces a Seattle Seahawks defense that ranks 22nd against quarterbacks, giving up, you guessed it, 18 points per game. Jones currently ranks third in quarterback rushing yards with 343 and his 5.9 average yards per carry ranks ahead of Justin Fields, Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, and Kyler Murray. Just saying.\n\nJones passed the ball 30 times last week in a back-and-forth affair with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Giants’ opponent this week, the Geno Smith-led Seattle Seahawks are scoring 26.1 points per game, fifth best in the NFL. This game has a 45-point total and looks to be one of the best games of Week 8. Jones’s wheels and arm will both need to be on display this week if the Boys in Blue want to become the worst 7-1 team in NFL history.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nDerrick Henry, Tennessee Titans – $8,400\n\nJosh Jacobs looked like Derrick Henry last week, rushing for 143 yards and three touchdowns against Henry’s opponent this week, the Houston Texans. You know he’s just licking his chops or doing push-ups with weights on his back or throwing a 50lbs ball really hard agaisnt a wall and catching it or something. Henry rushed 30 times for 128 yards last week. In the last four weeks, Henry has averaged 29 touches and 25.5 DraftKings points per game.\n\nHenry is going to be chalky given this juicy matchup against a Texans defense that has given up 1044 total yards and eight total touchdowns on the year. On average that’s 32 points per game. Henry’s floor is safe and his upside is upwards of 30-points. In Henry we trust if we are going to pay up.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nRaheem Mostert, Miami Dolphins – $5,900\n\nRaheem Mostert is averaging 19 touches per game since taking over as the starting running back for the Miami Dolphins in Week 4. He’s scored double-digit points in three of four games and has two 20-plus-point performances. Matt Harmon of Yahoo Fantasy and Reception Perception likes him this week as well. I mean who doesn’t with his matchup?\n\nThe Detroit Lions rank 30th in the NFL against running backs on the season. They have given up 10 rushing touchdowns and 940 total yards to running backs. Mostert’s 4.32 speed is a game-changer and just what we look for in a GPP value running back. The 50.5-point total is the largest on the main slate this week. Get the popcorn ready for this one and load up on Mostert.\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nAntonio Gibson, Washington Commanders – $5,400\n\nBo McBrayer said it best.\n\nWe all saw it again in Week 7. Antonio Gibson racked up 16.7 DraftKings points off of 14 touches, good for 1.2 points per touch. Brian Robinson scored 10.6 DraftKings points on 22 touches, good for 0.48 points per touch. Washington should continue to use Gibson in the passing down roll this week against an Indianapolis Colts team that has given up over 1,000 total yards to running backs in seven games. Gibson is a GPP play for the GPP players.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nJustin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings – $9,100\n\nJustin Jefferson is averaging 24.2 DraftKings points per game this season, good for third-highest at the wide position. He has three performances out of six games with 33-points or more and has scored double-digit points in five of six games. The floor is safe and the upside is through the roof. His $9,100 price tag should scare away some of the chalk, but he will still be popular.\n\nJefferson is averaging over 11 targets in his last three games and takes on an Arizona Cardinals defense that PFF ranks 29th overall. Their secondary consists of Marco Wilson and Byron Murphy Jr. who rank 102 and 60th out of 110 cornerbacks. Jefferson is going to have a field day. Two touchdowns are not out of the question and which means the Kirk Cousins stack is in play this week at $15,200. It’s my cohost at the Fantasy Millionaires Mike “Cash” Collins Diamond stack of the week. Adjust your ranks.\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nChris Olave, New Orleans Saints – $6,000\n\nO, Michael Thomas, Michael Thomas, wherefore art thou Michael Thomas?\n\nBut soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\n\nIt is the east, and Chris Olave at $6,000 is the sun.\n\nArise, fair Olave, and kill the envious GPP bro lineup,\n\nWho is already sick and pale with chalk,\n\nThat thou, her stack, art far more fair than the fields.\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nGarrett Wilson, New York Jets – $4,200\n\nLast week the Jets’ offense was pathetic after Breece Hall went down with his season-ending ACL surgery. To be fair, Zach Wilson has struggled since returning from a pre-season injury this season. Garrett Wilson led all Jets’ wide receivers with five targets but only turned that into 6.4 DraftKings points against a stout Denver Broncos secondary.\n\nThis week the law firm of Wilson & Wilson takes on a New England Patriots defense that was just exposed by the Chicago Bears at home at Foxborough. Wilson should see an increased target share this week. Without Hall in the lineup I expect the Jets to showcase their other rookie offensive weapon in Wilson. His $4,200 is just way too cheap. I expect the sharps like Bo McBrayer to be all over him, so don’t be surprised he gets a little chalky.\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nZach Ertz, Arizona Cardinals – $5,100\n\nZach Ertz is the play this week against the Minnesota Vikings. Their defense ranks 26th in the NFL giving up over 15-points per game to tight ends. Ertz ranks third in the NFL with 55 tight end targets and is averaging 7.9 per game. The game has a total of 49 points which means that Ertz should see plenty of volume. I’m not overthinking this high-priced play this week.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nTyler Higbee, Los Angeles Rams 49ers – $4,200\n\nNo one ever likes playing Tyler Higbee. But his 50 targets are fourth most at the tight end position and besides by the law of averages, the passes slings his way by Matthew Stafford can’t all be intercepted. Higbee is a middle-of-the-field volume guy who has the potential to catch a touchdown or three when you least expect or accept it. At only $4,200 he’s popping in RunTheSim.com tight-end models as a value play with the top ‘Boom’ rate.\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nIrv Smith, Minnesota Vikings – $3,500\n\nFresh off their bye week, Irv Smith has a juicy matchup against an Arizona Cardinals defense that gives up 20-points to tight ends per game. Smith has been averaging over five targets per game in his last five games. He’s cheap at only $3,400 and can be played naked or stacked with Bo McBrayer’s favorite quarterback of all time Kirk Cousins. Make sure to tag him with your winning lineups.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 7!

A stark contrast to the previous season when he scored six touchdowns against the Browns, good for 65.5 DraftKings points. So which Lamar should we expect agaisnt the Browns this year?\n\nI’m predicting a huge bounce-back performance from Lamar Jackson this week! The Browns have looked terrible on defense this season, giving up 30 or more points in half of their games. This week they are 6.5-point road underdogs. I am expecting the Ravens to dominate the Browns on Sunday. My favorite way to approach this game is to stack Lamar Jackson with his tight end Mark Andrews and then run it back with Amari Cooper. Shhh. Don’t tell anyone.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nJoe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals – $6,900\n\nJoe Burrow was the top-scoring quarterback on DraftKings last week, accounting for four total touchdowns and passing for 300 yards during his slate-breaking performance. With Tee Higgins nursing an injury, Ja’Marr Chase was once again Burrow’s number-one target, collecting seven receptions for 132 yards and two touchdowns. We should have known when Burrow showed up to the New Orleans Super Dome in a Ja’Marr Chase LSU game-worn jersey that they were going to pop off.\n\nThis week Burrow, Chase, and Higgins are up against an Atlanta Falcons secondary that ranks 30 against wide receivers. They surrender over 40 points per game. Last week they gave up 48 points to Jimmy G. and the 49ers’ passing offense. Burrow and company are going to feast on PFF’s 49th and 84th-ranked cornerbacks Casey Hayward Jr. and A.J. Terrell. The Falcons have played well the past few weeks, but I expect the 6.5-point home-favorite Bengals to cover and put up points in the process.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nMatt Ryan, Indianapolis Colts – $5,400\n\nA few weeks ago, Matt Ryan looked absolutely washed in his Thursday Night performance against Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos. He scored 6.1 points, which wasn’t his lowest output of the season. He only scored 1.8-points in Week 2 agaisnt the same Jacksonville Jaguars he faced on Sunday. So of course, right on cue, he drops three touchdowns, passes for 389 yards, and scores 27 DraftKings points in an impressive performance. Well played Matty Ice. I should never have doubted you.\n\nThis week Ryan and his wide receivers Michael Pittman, Paris Campbell, and Alec Pierce face a Tennessee Titans defense that ranks 28th agaisnt quarterbacks and 31st agaisnt wide receivers. Last week Ryan targeted wide receivers 34 times for 23 receptions, good for 240 yards and two touchdowns. Without Jonathan Taylor, in the lineup, the Colts offense has slowly shifted to a more pass-heavy focus. They are currently attempting the second most passing attempts per game through the first six games of the season. This is a trend that I expect to continue in this matchup with the Titans. Ryan might just be the nuts, again.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nSaquon Barkley, New York Giants – $7,900\n\nSaquon Barkley’s 141 touches are the most by any running back in the NFL. He’s currently only one point behind DraftKings leading running back scorer Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns. Barkley looks like his former self, seeing over 23 touches per game and averaging over 5YPC.\n\nThis week Saquon and the New York Giants face the Jacksonville Jaguars who give up 27 fantasy points to running backs per game. Opponents’ running backs have exploited the Jags for 808 total yards and five total touchdowns. Just two weeks ago they game up 172 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns for 40 points to the Philadelphia Eagles. Saquon is priced up $200 this week from $7,700 last week but he should still be a popular play given his volume and the positive matchup.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nJosh Jacobs, Las Vegas Raiders – $6,500\n\nJosh Jacobs might be the only offense that the Las Vegas Raiders have come Sunday’s tilt with the Houston Texans. Wide receiver Davante Adams is facing possible Leauge discipline after he was charged with a misdemeanor assault for shoving a sideline photographer to the ground on his way to the locker room. Darren Waller missed Week 5 with a hamstring injury.\n\nJacobs is averaging 21.8 touches and over 20-points per game. Coincidence? I think not. Volume has been king for Jacobs this season. Nothing should change this week when the Raiders face the Texans. They have given up 880 total yards and six touchdowns to running backs in only five games. Opposing running backs are scoring 30-points against them on the regular. Hopefully, Jacobs won’t be 40% rostered next week because he will be one of the most popular running back plays for Week 7. Much like with the Rhamondre chalk last week, sometimes you just have to eat it.\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nTony Pollard, Dallas Cowboys – $5,700\n\nThis week Tony Pollard and the Cowboys face the Detroit Lions and their absolutely terrible rotten horrible no good defense. The Lions are so bad that despite having a bye last week, they have still given up the most touchdowns (eight) to running backs on the season. Running backs have lit them up for at least 20 points in every game this season. They say that past performance is the best predictor of future results. I don’t think the Lions’ defense learned to tackle during the bye so this week we roll with Dallas Cowboys running backs.\n\nWhile Ezekiel Elliott is still officially the lead running back, Tony Pollard has outscored him on the season in DraftKings points by one. Pollard is priced at $5,700, while Elliott is priced at $6,000. Pollard has seen twice the receiving volume and has the breakaway speed needed to take a long run to the house. Elliott has a more stable floor, but I love Pollard’s upside for GPP tournaments.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nJa’Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals – $8,200\n\nJa’Marr Chase put his afterburners into nitro last week and blew by the New Orleans Saints secondary on his way to the game-winning touchdown. It was just ridiculous to behold given the angle and acceleration displayed by Chase. He was not going to be denied. There’s just too much junkyard dog in him. This week he has a juicy matchup with a Falcon’s secondary that is old and slow. Despite beating the 49ers at home last week, they gave up 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns to wide receivers for a total of 48 points. I love this match-up for Chase and if he show’s up to this week’s game in a vintage game-worn Joe Burrow LSU jersey, shit is about to get wild!\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nAmari Cooper, Cleveland Browns – $6,100\n\nAmari Cooper has been averaging 12 targets per game in the last two weeks. This is three more than his season average of nine per game. Why the increase you ask. Good question. The Browns are 1-4. They have lost three games in a row. This week they face a Baltimore Ravens defense that ranks 29th against wide receivers this season. They have given up 1189 receiving yards and seven touchdowns through six weeks.\n\nThe Browns are currently 6-point road underdogs in this matchup. The game script is just begging Amari Cooper to break out. The Browns should be playing catchup or engaged in a back-and-forth game with the high-scoring Lamar Jackson and company. Hell, they fired their defensive coordinator Joe Wood, always a good sign if you are a wide receiver on the team. GPP or bust!\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nAlec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts – $4,600\n\nLast week Alex Pierce finally showed up for the Indianapolis Colts, catching a last-minute touchdown pass from Matt Ryan to secure the victory over the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars. The rookie will be brimming with confidence rolling into this week’s matchup with the Tennessee Titans. Despite being on a bye this past week, they still are tied for second worst in the NFL with eight touchdowns given up to wide receivers. They are giving up close to 45 points per game to the wide receiver position. I expect Matt Ryan to continue to feed Pierce this week. In all likelihood, he will be up against 5’11” 190lbs. Roger McCreary. Pierce has a four-inch height and a 20 lbs weight advantage so….adjust the ranks.\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nMark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens – $7,400\n\nMark Andrews has scored over 22.9 points in four of six games this season. He’s averaging 20.1 points per game and is second to only Travis Kelce this season at tight end points scored. No shocker, in games where Andrews has been targeted 10 times or more he scored 22.9 or more DraftKings points. The question then becomes, do we think that Andrews will be targeted 10 or more times? I do.\n\nAndrews functions as the Baltimore Ravens WR1 with a 31.5% target share. He’s currently third behind only CeeDee Lamb at 32.4 and Cooper Kupp at 31.7. His $7,400 price tag is $600 less than Travis Kelce this week, who only has a 22% target share in the Chiefs’ offense. One never completely fades Kelce, but I am leaning toward Andrews in the pay-up tight end game this week.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nGeorge Kittle, San Francisco 49ers – $5,300\n\nGeorge Kittle looked like George Kittle this past week against the Atlanta Falcons. He converted 10 targets into eight receptions for 83 yards and 16.3 DraftKings points. My partner at the Fantasy Millionaires, Mike “Cash” Collins (@TheRalphMacho on Twitter) loves Kittle’s matchup this week. PFF has him as a top 6 option as well. The 49ers will need to lean on him again this week if they have any chance of upsetting Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThe Chiefs’ defense has been susceptible to the old tight-end touchdowns this season, having given up four in six games. Kittle has yet to find the end zone in the four games he’s played. His target share bumped from 20% to 24% last week in a negative game script. TJ Hockenson’s $4,800 price should draw enough rostership to make Kittle a leverage play this week. Play him with quiet confidence.\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nGerald Everett, LA Chargers – $4,000\n\nThis play is super simple. The Seattle Seahawks rank dead last in the NFL against the tight end position, giving up 24-points per game, six more than the 31st-ranked team. Gerald Everett was targeted seven times last week by Justin Herbert and should be able to find room down the seem against this young defense. They have already conceded 32 receptions for 526 receiving yards and four touchdowns through six weeks. All good things, for Everett.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 6! Each week Nimble GPP will bring you the plays to get you paid for DraftKings GPP.

The last time he faced the Kansas City Chiefs he threw for 329 passing yards, four touchdowns, and broke off 68 yards on the ground. He carved up the Chiefs last year like a Christmas ham, deliciously. We just saw what Derek Carr and Davante Adams did to this porous Chiefs secondary. They have given up a league-worst 12 passing touchdowns to opposing quarterbacks and rank 27th in the NFL, giving up over 21 fantasy points per game.\n\nAllen’s 16 total touchdowns,14 passing, and two rushing lead all NFL quarterbacks. He’s averaging over 32 points per game in a matchup that has a 53.5 total. Stacking Allen with Diggs or Gabe Davis gives you the greatest upside play in this matchup. The Chiefs have given up 7 touchdowns to wide receivers and over 800 receiving yards in five games. Allen is expensive at $8,200 but he’s still one of the top plays this week.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nTom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers – $6,300\n\nMy co-host at the Fantasy Millionaires Mike “Cash” Collins believes that Tom Brady is going to come out like a man possessed in the next few weeks, raining down touchdowns in his angry wake. Tom Brady has been “Elite” all these years while also spending time being a family man. Now there’s nothing to stop him from truly dedicating himself to his one love in life, which has always been football.\n\nLining up across from our Hero this week are the Pittsburgh Steelers, who might be one of the worst football teams in the NFL this year. Their secondary ranks dead last in the NFL against the wide receiver position, giving up 48.8 points per game. On the season they’ve surrendered 9 touchdowns and over 1,100 receiving yards. Tom Brady is only priced up $300 to $6,300 this week. I’m double stacking him with Leonard Fournette and one of his wide receivers. Cha-ching!\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nGeno Smith, Seattle Seahawks – $5,700\n\nIf you would have told me that Geno Smith would be $5,700 on DraftKings in week 6 I would have said that sounds expensive to me. Now I’m foaming at the mouth to get him into as many lineups as I can after he’s exploded onto the scene this year. Who knew that Russell Wilson was holding back the Seattle Seahawks? Apparently, Pete Carroll did! Geno Smith has been a revolution. His deep ball is perfect, connecting twice last week with Tyler Lockett on 40-plus-yard touchdown throws. He’s the definition of En Fuego right now.\n\nTyler Lockett is only $5,600 this week which is insane. His rostership will be through the roof, obviously. But sometimes you need to eat the chalk to make a DFS lineup. The Geno/Lockett stack will be one of the most popular ones this week, but adding Cardinals wide receiver Marquise Brown as a run-back option should help break it up a bit. You could also pay up for DK Metcalf at $6,800 as well in this matchup. The total for this game is 51.5, the second-highest total this week. I’m going to be all over this game!\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nSaquon Barkley, New York Giants – $7,700\n\nSaquon Barkley is averaging 24 opportunities and 22.3 DraftKings points per game. He’s basically scoring a point every time he touches the football. This week the Giants are 4.5-point home underdogs to Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens, so he might be touching the football A LOT!!\n\nIf the Giants plan on controlling the clock and keeping Lamar off the field, they are going to need to feed Barkley. If they are trailing and need to play catchup, I love Saquon seeing increased opportunities in the passing game. Not to make it too simple, but all roads lead to Saquon this week for the Giants. At only $7,700, it might be the deal of the day at running back.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nRhamondre Stevenson, New England Patriots – $6,000\n\nRhamondre Stevenson was unleashed last week by Bill Belichick, rushing for 161 yards on 25 carries, adding two receptions for a total of 27 touches. Stevenson scored his highest output of the season and his third 20-plus point performance in his last seven games. That’s actually impressive for a Patriots running back given the mercurial nature of Belichick’s running back by committee rotation history. Reports came out today from ProFootballTalk that “Damien Harris likely to miss multiple games with a hamstring injury.”\n\nStevenson should be in line for 20-25 touches again this week against a Cleveland Browns defense that let Austin Ekeler rush for 171 yards at a clip of 10.8 yards per carry. Yes, what you just read sounds absurd. It’s insanity. Stevenson is rushing for 5.5 yards per carry on the season, which means this is a matchup made in matchup heaven. Fingers crossed Belichick doesn’t decide to unleash Zappe. LOL!\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nKenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks – $5,400\n\nKenneth Walker III is the new starting running back for the Seattle Seahawks after Rashaad Penny fractured his fibula in last Sunday’s game against the New Orleans Saints. Walker III filled in admirably in the starting role, rushing for 88 yards on eight carries. His most impressive carry was his 69 touchdown scamper in the second half. He looked like he was shot out of a cannon.\n\nSeahawk running backs are averaging 21.4 opportunities per game this season. Walker will split backfield touches with DeeJay Dallas but should see the bulk of the work. I am projecting him for 16-18 touches, including the passing down work. He’s a great pay-down option if you want to load up on high-priced stud wide receivers this week. The Cardinals have given up three passing and two rushing touchdowns to go along with over 500 total yards to running backs. Walker will be chalky, so stay frosty.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nStefon Bills, Buffalo Bills – $8,400\n\nJosh Allen and his traveling high-flying wide receiver circus are on the road this week at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City to take on Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. This is the marquee matchup of the Sunday slate and currently has a 54-point total. It was 53.5 when I started writing this article an hour ago. 80% of the bets are coming in on the Bills right now. Besides Allen, one of the main reasons the Bills have been successful this year has been Stefon Diggs.\n\nDiggs is second in DraftKings fantasy points to only Cooper Kupp. He leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns with 5, is third in receptions with 39, and ranks 5th in receiving yards with 508. Lining up against him is normally, reliable cornerback, Rashad Fenton ranks 62nd out of 102 defensive backs according to PFF. His coverage grade of 58.8 is the worst of his career. I’m sure playing against Davante Adams twice a year is fun. Out of the frying pan and into the furnace this week against Diggs. I expect him to bounce back big from his poor playoff performance last year in the Divisional round game where he had three receptions for seven yards. Fade him at your own risk this week.\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nTyler Lockett, Seattle Seahawks – $5,600\n\nTyler Lockett has scored the eighth most DraftKings points for wide receivers this season and is the 21st most expensive wide receiver this week. Once again I’m questioning the sanity of the DraftKings algorithm. He should be priced up to $6,500 at least. Instead, he is priced at $5,600. I honestly think they made a mistake and we’re too proud to admit it and now they’re just going to roll it out there like that and let us feast upon him.\n\nThe problem is every time you look up Lockett is catching a 40-yard touchdown bomb from Geno Smith. I don’t make the rules Kidz this is just what’s happening right now. He scored over 14 DraftKings points in four of 5 weeks this season, including 22.7 and 30.4 point performances. I’m just going to cash in while I can and ride Lockett to money in my pocket. He might have a 69% rostership this week, so make sure that you stack him for maximum upside.\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nKhalil Shakir, Buffalo Bills – $3,700\n\nTip of the cap to my cohost on the Nimble DFS Chalk Blocked show Bo McBrayer AKA @Bo_McBigTime on Twitter, who called Khalil Shakir’s breakout game last week against the Pittsburgh Steelers. With Isaiah McKenzie still in the NFL’s concussion protocol, he shined in the slot receiver role, catching three of five passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. Well down all around.\n\nWhat’s not to love about running it back at only $3,700 this week? Shakir should continue to see an increased role in the offense after last week’s performance, McKenzie or no McKenzie. Not to beat a dead horse in this article, but the 54-point total just jumped to 69 points for goodness’ sake people! Play the man!!\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nTravis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs – $7,800\n\nTravis Kelce is “Lock and Load”this week at only $7,800. No, he’s not going to score four touchdowns sorry to say. Last year in their Divisional Round matchup against the Bills, Kelce caught eight balls for 96 yards and a touchdown. Good for around 20 DraftKings fantasy points. So far this season he’s been the number one tight end averaging 4.2 more points per game than Mark Andrews. He’s first in receptions with 33 and touchdowns with seven and he’s second in receiving yards to Andrews by only two yards.\n\nNo one can stop Kelce right now. He’s caught 16 of the last 18 passes Mahomes has thrown his way. He was four for four in his red-zone opportunities last week against the Las Vegas Raiders. I expect him to see another 10 targets this week including multiple red-zone opportunities in a game script that should keep him involved all game long. I’m not expecting a 78-point outburst like last January’s Divisional Round matchup, but this game is going to fuck, just make sure it’s not you and play Kelce.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nTyler Higbee, LA Rams – $4,600\n\nI’m partial to Tyler Higbee after he caught three touchdowns in Week 2 of the 2020 season, helping me score 251.6 points and win $5,000 on DraftKings. With that being said, he has quietly been one of the most consistently performing tight ends all season long. Higbee scored at least 10 DraftKings points in four of five matchups this season. He’s seen a Cooper Kupp-like target share the last two weeks as the Rams’ offensive line has struggled to protect Matthew Stafford, forcing him to settle for short passes underneath to Higbee.\n\nHis 24 targets in the last two weeks are probably not sustainable long-term, but he should see plenty of work this week against a Carolina Panthers defense that can get after the quarterback. According to PFF, Higbee has a top-five matchup this week against linebacker Cory Littleton. Expect the Rams to take advantage of this mismatch and pepper him with 8 to 10 targets. I’m predicting he catches his first touchdown so now you know you have to play him at only $4,600.\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nDavid Njoku, Cleveland Browns – $4,000\n\nIt’s David Njoku SZN!! In his last three games, he’s averaging just under eight targets and 16.5 DraftKings points per game. He’s also been consistent, scoring over 10 points in three straight games after getting off to a slow start through the first two weeks of the season.\n\nThe New England Patriots have given up five receiving touchdowns to tight ends in five games this season. Njoku has only one receiving touchdown on the season, but he has an excellent chance this week to add to his total. When I’m not playing Kelce, I’m paying down for him and loading up with high-priced wide receivers and running backs.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 5!

Signup for a FREE RunTheSims account today!!\n\nHigh Priced – Quarterback\n\nJalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles – $8,100\n\nJalen Hurts had a down Week 4, only scoring 17 DraftKings points. The weather in Philadelphia was absolutely terrible with monsoon-like rain and wind gusts swirling along with an invigorated Jacksonville defense. Despite a poor overall performance he rushed for a touchdown and he currently leads all quarterbacks with four through four games.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are not a very good football team. According to PFF, their defense currently ranks 32. Since there are only 32 teams and it’s not opposite day, they are royally fucked this week when Hurts and the undefeated Eagles soar into the desert. Hurts stacked with A.J. Brown is my cohost at the Fantasy Millionaires, Mike “Cash” Collins favorite pay-up stack of the week. It might secretly be mine too. Don’t tell him.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nJustin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers – $7,100\n\nLast week I told you to stack Justin Herbert with Austin Ekeler. The two combined for 59 points, just like I predicted. Apparently, the DraftKings algorithm did not read my article or watch Justin Herbert’s performance last week against the Houston Texans. I mean, I get it. There’s no Keenan Allen and Herbert hasn’t been dominant yet this season, but still.\n\nHerbert has scored over 23 DraftKings points in three of four performances this year. The addition of free agent tight end Gerald Everett has been a huge upgrade over aging Jared Cook last year. Head coach Brandon Staley called Allen “day-to-day” on Monday, and so his status for Sunday remains unclear. If Allen returns, I will be above the field on Herbert shares.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nTom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers – $6,000\n\nI can’t believe that Tom Brady is priced down at only $6,000 this week on DraftKings. I thought it was a typo and it was actually $6,900 but then after I blinked a few times I realized that maybe DraftKings felt bad for Tom after the news of Gisele leaving him broke. Maybe they were trying to throw him and also us players a proverbial bone. Whatever the reason, I’m scarfing down this min-priced Brady. I love stacking them this week with Mike Evans or Chris Godwin. You can even get cute and creative and stack him with Leonard Fournette or Rachaad White. Balls will be thrown this week. Brady is down, but not out, and I literally expect him to throw himself into his work with week.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nNick Chubb, Cleveland Browns – $8,000\n\nNick Chubb is averaging 23 DraftKings points per game and is only priced at $8,000. This makes no sense. He is going to run the football all day long. He’s good for a touchdown every single week and he’s a plug-and-play value at this point. On the season the Chargers have given up 619 yards and five total touchdowns to the running back position. On average they give up around 30 points per game. Last week Dameon Pierce averaged 9.4 yards-per-carry, rushed for 131 yards, and scored 28.9 DraftKings points. Dameon Pierce is no Nick Chubb.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nDameon Pierce, Houston Texans – $6,200\n\nSpeaking of Dameon Pierce, last week he finally burst onto the NFL scene with a 75-yard touchdown run, carving up the Los Angeles Chargers defense like a turkey on Thanksgiving. What was most impressive was his 20 total opportunities including six targets and six receptions. All of us did come in a furious comeback time, but that’s the best part about the Houston Texans is it their defense is terrible, so they’ll be in a furious hurry-up comeback mode all season long. Pierce is priced up this week but I still love his matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars who just made miles Sanders look like Saquon Barkley, giving up 134 yards and two touchdowns. It’s officially Pierce season!\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nDameon Harris, New England Patriots– $5,600\n\nNobody knows who the starting quarterback is going to be for the New England Patriots next week. We do know that the Detroit Lions give up 30-plus points per game to opposing running backs and are ranked 31st in the NFL. Last week Rashaad penny cashed in with two rushing touchdowns and 151 yards rushing. Last week the Patriots ran the ball 32 times. Damien Harris saw 18 of those carries to Rhamondre Steveson’s 14. Harris also scored a touchdown and 15 DraftKings points to Steveson’s 12. I like both Patriots running backs this week so pick your poison in this juicy matchup.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nA.J. Brown, Philadelphia – $7,500\n\nAJ Brown is averaging over 100 yards receiving, 9.5 targets, and most importantly, 18.6 DraftKings points per game. According to PFF, Brown has the best cornerback matchups this week. There’s nothing better than a score of 100. RunTheSims also has Brown as a top 5 wide receiver this week.\n\nBrown has only scored one touchdown on the season, after getting a touchdown called back from a sketchy offensive pass interference call on Dallas Goedert. The Cardinals’ cornerbacks are no match for the physicality Brown will bring them on Sunday. Marco Wilson, PFF’s 101st /105th, and Byron Murphy Jr., PFF’s 49th/105 cornerbacks both give up 35lbs. and four inches in height to Brown. Brown is my “LOCK OF THE WEEK”!\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nMike Evans, Tampa Buccaneers – $6,900\n\nMike Evans is averaging 20 DraftKings points per game he’s currently the seventh highest scoring wide receiver and is being priced as the tenth highest. He Scored 33 DraftKings points last week after catching eight receptions for 103 yards and two touchdowns. He’s Tom Brady’s favorite target in any zone and should see plenty of volume in this high-scoring affair. The Atlanta Falcons are averaging 25.8 points scored per game. which means this game has the potential to shoot. Currently, the total over-under is 48 points, With the Buccaneers being favored by 8.5 points at home.\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nRondale Moore, Arizona Cardinals – $4,100\n\nRondale Moore made his season debut last week and had an 86% snap share, ran 33 routes on 35 Kyler Murray dropbacks, and had a 10.4-yard average depth of target. All those stats from Adam Levitan from Establish the Run.\n\nIn Week 5, Moore and the Arizona Cardinals face off against Jalen Hurts and the Philadephia Eagles, the only remaining undefeated team in the NFL. They are currently five-point home underdogs. This game script has a pass-heavy Kyler comeback narrative written all over it! At only $4,100, Moore is the pay-down lotto ticket that actually has slate-breaking upside. He should see more than five targets this week as Greg Dortch is further fazed out of the offense.\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nT.J. Hockenson, Detroit Lions – $4,900\n\nT.J. Hockenson is going to have so many babies named after him in nine months after he more than likely impregnated anyone lucky enough to be in attendance at Ford Field on Sunday. Hell, I peed on a stick after watching the highlights just to make sure I was in the clear.\n\nI’m not expecting a repeat performance, nor am I chasing points. That’s a tremendous weekly DFS podcast from my guys over at Fantasy Points, led by Graham Barfield and Scott Barrett! The Lions’ opponents in Week 5, the New England Patriots have given up 5 touchdowns to tight ends through four games this season. That’s bad for them and great for us! Wheels up.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nPat Freiermuth, Pittsburgh Steelers – $4,100\n\nPat Freiermuth has quietly scored over 12 DraftKings points in three or four games so far. This week he’s priced at $4,100 and faces a Buffalo Bills defense that is good. Kenny Pickett is going to be under duress all game long and I expect him to look for Pat Freiermuth in the middle of the field like he did last week against the Jets. He was targeted a game-high nine times for an insane 35% target share. Look for Pickett to continue to lean on Freiermuth as he gains his bearings in the NFL. He’s a target monster with a red-zone touchdown upside.\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nHunter Henry, New England Patriots – $2,900\n\nTip of the cap to my cohost on Chalk Blocked, the world’s sexiest DFS Show, for now, Bo McBrayer for pointing out the glaringly obvious. Hunter Henry is the only game in Patriots town at the tight end position this week. Jonnu Smith is OUT and so might be Max Jones. If Zappe is under center expect Henry to see an increased role in the passing games. I’m rolling with Henry as a pay down with pay off written all over him!!\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 4!

He’s averaging 37.8 points per game. What’s been most impressive is what he’s done through the air. His 10 passing touchdowns lead the NFL. He’s also added two rushing touchdowns, giving him a total of 12. This week Lamar Jackson faces Josh Allen and the high-flying Buffalo Bills offense. The 52-point total is the highest on the board this week and I think the game shoots the over.\n\nLast week the Baltimore Ravens defense gave up 30 points to Mac Jones. Josh Allen is not Mac Jones. Lamar Jackson is going to need to throw three touchdowns and rushed for two more touchdowns just to keep his team in the game. The Bills are banged up a corner which is great news for Rashod Bateman and Devin Duvernay. I love stacking Lamar with one of his wide receivers or with Mark Andrews. A double stack is not out of the question at all.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nJustin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers – $7,100\n\nThe Houston Texans’ secondary is bad. Their starting cornerbacks, Derek Stingley Jr. and Steven Nelson rank 92nd and 60th, respectively out of 102. That’s not good. They have only given up one touchdown pass, but to be fair they had Alec Pierce drop a touchdown on them back in Week 1, and have faced a “cookless” Russell Wilson and the hapless Chicago Bears. Despite his broken rib cartilage, Herbert passed the ball 45 times last week in the loss to the Jaguars.\n\nI am not worried about his health in this matchup and there’s a chance that Keenan Allen might be back as well. I expect Austin Ekeler to be heavily involved in the passing attack in this matchup. Ekeler currently leads all NFL running backs with 22 targets and 21 receptions. The Houston Texans are terrible agaisnt the running back, already giving up 92 yards in three games. All signs point to the Chargers and Herbert getting right against the Texans.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nMarcus Mariota, Atlanta Falcons – $5,600\n\nLast week Marcus Mariota was my value quarterback at $5,500. This week DraftKings has priced him up $100 to $5,600. According to RunTheSims.com his baseline projection for Week 4 is 20 points, or close to 4xing his value. The Falcons currently ranked ninth in points scored per game with 26.7.\n\nThe Browns on the other hand have given up seven total touchdowns to quarterbacks, including two rushing touchdowns. Mariota has a rushing touchdown in two out of three games so far this season. Mariota is a very safe play with tons of upside in a game with a 50-point total with two defenses that have been mediocre so far. He could pay off big this game shoots.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nSaquon Barkley, New York Giants – $8,000\n\nSaquon is back and he looks electric! Consider his Week 4 price of $8,000 price a sweet Monday night discount. The DraftKings price gremlins hedged their bets and lost this one. Jonathan Taylor, Christian McCaffery, and Derrick Henry are all hundreds of dollars more expensive this week. Barkley is second to only Nick Chubb in DraftKings points at the running back position, and only by 0.1.\n\nHe currently leads all NFL running backs with 409 total yards. He’s averaging five targets per game and six yards per carry. The Giants are playing the Chicago Bears in Week 4. They just gave up 101 total yards to Houston Texans’ rookie running back Dameon Pierce. Barkley has seen 68 opportunities through the first three games of the season and should see 22-25 touches in this matchup.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nJamaal Williams, Detroit Lions – $6,100\n\nD’Andre Swift is banged up and is most likely going to miss some time with sprained shoulder according to a Tom Pelissero report on Twitter. Even before the injury, Jamaal Williams was holding his own in the Lions backfield. He’s the Lions’ primary goal-line back and is tied for the NFL league lead with four rushing touchdowns.\n\nAccording to the Detroit Free Press, if Swift misses time, Williams will likely split the backfield load with Craig Reynolds and Justin Jackson. I expect Williams to serve as the starter, with Reynolds jumping into the PPR role. The Seattle Seahawks, have given up 502 total yards and two touchdowns to running backs through the first three weeks. Williams should be a smash play!\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nKhalil Herbert, Chicago Bears – $5,700\n\nAfter last week’s explosive performance filling in for the injured David Montgomery, Khalil Herbert isn’t sneaking up on anyone this week in DSF. His juicy cheap price will make him a chalky pay-down option. I’m not worried unless we get into the 30% rostership zone.\n\nThe Bears’ run-heavy attack will keep Herbert busy agaisnt a New York Giants defense that just gave up 178 yards rushing to a depleted Dallas Cowboys offensive line. In the young season, the Giants have already surrendered 469 total yards and three touchdowns to running backs. The Bears running backs are averaging 28.7 touches per game. Herbert is averaging 7.3 yards per carry and his 240 rushing yards rank 6th best in the NFL. Adjust the ranks.\n\nHigh Priced – Wide Receiver\n\nMichael Pittman, Indianapolis Colts – $7,200\n\nMichael Pittman is averaging 21 DraftKings points per game this season. Matt Ryan’s affinity for Pittman is growing too. Last week he targeted him on 25% of his dropbacks. He turned his whopping 53% wide receiver target share into eight receptions good for 72 yards. He’s only found the endzone once, in Week 1 against the Houston Texans. According to PFF this week Pittman has the second-best cornerback matchup. Cornerbacks Kristian Fulton and Roger McCreary both measure in at 5’11” and weigh under 200lbs.\n\nPittman on the other hand stands 6’4” and weighs 220lbs. The size mismatch represents a clear advantage for the Colts to exploit downfield and in the red-zone. I expect Pittman to see 8-10 targets, including 1-2 down by the goal-line. At $7,200, Pittman is priced up coming off of a down performance, so hopefully, that scares folks off of him and his chalk isn’t through the freaking roof.\n\nMid-Range – Wide Receiver\n\nDiontae Johnson, Pittsburgh Steelers – $6,000\n\nDiontae Johnson is averaging 11 targets per game this season, But only 14.6 DraftKings points per game. That’s all going to change this week when he faces the New York Jets. I’m predicting a two-touchdown breakout performance for Diontae Johnson. The Jets have already given up 466 receiving yards to wide receivers as well as six touchdowns. They give up two touchdowns per game to wide receivers on average.\n\nThe Jets’ safeties imparticular are a huge liability. Lamarcus Joyner has a PFF grade of 29.9, good for 75th of 76. Jordan Whitehead, the pillar of the group ranks 65th. If Johnson gets behind the defense, who for some reason still is playing man coverage, he will find paydirt. Shhh. This little secret is just ours.\n\nValue – Wide Receiver\n\nDevin Duvernay, Baltimore Ravens – $4,100\n\nDevin Duvernay is a touchdown Ninja. He has eight targets this season, eight receptions, and three touchdowns. He is one touchdown behind Stefon Diggs for the NFL lead. He’s also one point behind his teammate Rashod Bateman in DraftKings points. And he’s only $4,100 in a game with a 52-point total that has the potential to shoot into the 60s. Lamar is looking for him in the red zone as well.\n\nI love stacking Lamar with Duvernay and running it back with Stefon Diggs or Gabriel Davis. We know this game is going to shoot and touchdowns are going to be scored through the air. Lamar Jackson leads the league with 10 passing touchdowns. If you don’t play Duvernay you don’t deserve to win.\n\nHigh Priced – Tight End\n\nMark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens – $7,100\n\nMark Andrews is the WR1 on the Baltimore Ravens and we have always known that. His $7,100 price tag is a bargain given his role in the Ravens’ offense though. Did you know that? For a bit of perspective, he leads all NFL tight ends with 31 targets, 22 receptions, 240 receiving yards, and three touchdowns. With back-to-back 28-point DraftKings performances and a 52-point game total against the Buffalo Bills, all systems point to blast off for Andrews.\n\nHis floor is safe and his ceiling is close to 10 points higher than any other tight end this week. If you are paying up for Andrews, you should stack him with Lamar Jackson to maximize your leverage. I also like adding Devin Duvernay and running the game stack back with a few of the Buffalo Bills’ weapons.\n\nMid-Range – Tight End\n\nKyle Pitts, Atlanta Falcons – $5,000\n\nKyle Pitts truthers have had a rough first few weeks of the NFL season, Bo McBigTime and Mike “Cash” Collins especially. I hope they can finally take a deep breath and relax. Last week Pitts finally came to fantasy life, turning his eight targets into five receptions for 87 yards and 13.7 DraftKings points.\n\nThe head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, Arthur Smith came out and said “the ball will find him” and it did. I expect the ball to keep finding Pitts this week in a potentially high-scoring matchup with the Cleveland Browns. The game has a 50-point total and the Falcons are home underdogs. There will be targets and I predict that Pitts will catch his first career NFL touchdown in America. Punch those prop tickets boys!!\n\nValue – Tight End\n\nTyler Conklin, New York Jets – $3,600\n\nTyler Conklin is the third-highest scoring tight end through the first three weeks of the NFL season. And it’s not like he had one explosive game and two duds, he has been consistent, scoring over 10 points all three games. This week, he faces a Steelers defense that was just bludgeoned by David Njoku for nine receptions, 90 receiving yards, and a touchdown.\n\nConklin is tied for third in tight end targets with Travis Kelce with 24. With games of seven, nine, and eight targets, the floor is safe and the upside is sky high. The Jets are road underdogs, so you know Flacco will be adding to his league-leading 155 passing attempts. He’s averaging an unholy 51.6 attempts per game. Enjoy the free money.\n\nFeatured\n\nNimble GPP Plays to Get You Paid!\n\nWelcome to NFL Week 3!

Each week I will help you build the best GPP lineups by providing you the building blocks at each skill position by identifying “High Priced”, “Mid-Range”, and “Value” plays.

Signup for a FREE RunTheSims account today!!\n\nHigh Priced – Quarterback\n\nJalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles – $7,600\n\nJalen Hurts is a beast! He currently is the NFL’s eleventh leading rusher and ranks second in rushing touchdowns with three. He’s also passed for over 550 yards and has a completion percentage of 69%! His RunTheSims.com boom rate is over 66%. The Washington Commanders have historically struggled to contain rushing quarterbacks and their current group of linebackers might be their worst in decades. Jalen Hurts could rush for over 75 yards in this matchup in the first half. I love playing him naked or stacking him with A.J. Brown. He’s currently being rostered at 9%, which is behind only Josh Allen and Kirk Cousins.\n\nMid-Range – Quarterback\n\nMatthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams – $6,500\n\nMatthew Stafford rebounded in week 2 scoring over 20 points after a disappointing season opener against the Buffalo Bills. The Cardinals on the other hand rank 32nd against quarterbacks, giving up over 26 points per game. They have surrendered 612 passing yards and seven touchdowns, with no interceptions. Stafford has three different stacking options this week. Cooper Kupp is priced up at $9,900, Allen Robinson at $5,700, and Tyler Higbee down at $4,500. Kupp is the Rolls-Royce stack with the most explosive upside. He saw 28 targets in two games last season. I’m comfortable stacking them all but prefer Kupp at the points per dollar value.\n\nValue – Quarterback\n\nMarcus Mariota, Atlanta Falcons – $5,500\n\nBo McBrayer from FantasyPros loves Marcus Mariota this week in a double stack with Drake London and Kyle Pitts. Marcus Mariota is the 12th highest scoring DraftKings quarterback through 2 weeks with 37 points. At only, $5,500 he’s a tremendous pay-down value who has rushing opportunities with goal-line carry upside. If he can finally connect with Pitts, the stack could pay off in a big way. I’m also completely comfortable running Mariota out naked and paying up at running back or wide receiver this week.\n\nHigh Priced – Running Back\n\nJoe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals – $7,600\n\nJoe Mixon is averaging 30 opportunities per game through the first two weeks of the season. Mixon is fourth in the NFL with 13 running back targets as well. The Bengals are 0-2 and on the road this week in New York to face the Jets. I can see Zac Taylor using Mixon to control the clock and slow the game down to make sure that the Bangles come out with a victory. I can easily see Mixon rushing for over 100 yards (and the bonus) and scoring a touchdown or two. All while adding 4-5 receptions and 30 yards out of the backfield. Currently, he’s picking up 14% rostership, which is the fourth highest on the slate.\n\nMid-Range – Running Back\n\nLeonard Fournette, Tampa Bay Buccaneers – $6,500\n\nLeonard Fournette is still the only game in town for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week when they face Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. Mike Evans is suspended, Chris Godwin is OUT, they were so desperate they signed Cole Beasley to the practice squad. Leonard Fournette is going to eat in this matchup he underperform last week and has been priced down $200 to $6,500. According to RunTheSims.com Fournette’s boom rate is over 63%. He’s one of the best plays on the board and should see 25 touches again in this matchup. Tom Brady knows the best way to win is to feed Fournette while the rest of his team heals up.\n\nValue – Running Back\n\nMiles Sanders, Philadelphia Eagles – $5,500\n\nMiles Sanders is averaging 17.5 opportunities per game. While the Washington Commanders on the other hand have given up 310 total yards and three touchdowns to running backs through the first two games of the season. T"
