        "text": "Norman Ogilvie \"Pompey\" Norton (11 May 1881 â€“ 27 June 1968) was a South African cricketer. He was a lawyer by career and became a provincial administrator for the game.\n\nAn all-rounder, Norton made his first-class debut with Western Province versus an Australian team in 1902. He returned in 1907 with Border and within two years attained a personal best score of 57 during a game in Cape Town against Western Province. In another game at Cape Town during the 1908/09 season, he took 6 for 34 against Eastern Province, taking 10 for 92 in the match and also making a second and last first-class fifty.\n\nIn the 1909/10 season, Norton played in the Fifth Test against the touring English team. He took 4 for 47, including the wickets of Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley, and scored 2 and 7.[1]"
