        "text": "Message Board Archives\n\nHolder, Blackwood and Joseph top Batting and Bowling\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nResults of the recently concluded Test Match between West Indies and South Africa, had Holder and Blackwood as West top batsmen (Someone please hold Curtesy, a heart attack is imminent), and Joseph as the most wicket taker, results are as follows:\n\nBATSMEN\n\nHolder 118* runs 39.9\n\nBlackwood 126 runs 31.5\n\nReifer 85 runs 21.25\n\nDaSilva 81 runs 20.25\n\nMotie 17* runs 17.0\n\nMayers 54 runs 13.5\n\nChase 50 runs 12.5\n\nBraithwaite 46 runs 11.5\n\nChanderpaul 35 runs 8.75\n\nJoseph 26 runs 8.70\n\nGabriel 8 runs 4.0 (played 2 innings)\n\nBOWLERS - Number of Wickets\n\nJoseph 12\n\nHolder 7\n\nRoach 7\n\nMayers 7\n\nMotie 3\n\nGabriel 2\n\nReifer 1\n\nChase 0\n\nBlackwood 0\n\nnatty_forever\n\nI been meaning to say that in my opinion, we lost the second test, after lunch on the first day. Cappo brought on Reefer before lunch, got a wicket, You continue with him after lunch, you really think he was going run through the batting. KB you ratings as a captain dropped a few levels in S. A.\n\nI am placing you on immediate probation\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nHolder was not out 81 so his average can not be 29.5.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nThe results above demonstrated that we lost mainly due to the poor batting display of our batsmen, no captaincy can change that, unless Braithwaite hit double centuries in each innings.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to natty_forever\n\nWe did not have the batting to withstand Rabada et al. When Shortman stood up and made 172 that took the game away from us.Maybe if we had to score 180 we might have been able to do that.\n\nRabada has the best strike rate of anyone with more than 100 wickets in the history of the game.\n\nActually that is not true, since Lohmann has a better strike rate and he played test cricket between 1886 and 1896!!!!!!!\n\nnatty_forever\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nThey were little something for 4 at lunch. Kept on Reefer, batman got set.\n\nBtw, you know their batting would do worse against their bowling. Not that our bowling is bad, we got 20wkts, just lacks consistency. Always poor the first session of a test if asked to bowl first.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nThe usual suspects hiding from the Stats not a word from them but like to come on the boards and post a bunch of rum bar man logics.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nUnderstandably Duke but the fact remains that we did not put up enough runs on the board.\n\nBamboocane\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nCan this outing earn Joseph the new ball?\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Bamboocane\n\nAbsolutely, he has earned it and has been the understudy for the last couple of years.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nWill someone tell Curtesy to stop avoiding the stats and hiding his head in the sand for the rest of his body exposed\n\nNarper\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nCheck here\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Narper\n\nInteresting comment, playing for not out, while your team is losing, makes no sense to me, many enjoy bush logics.\n\nPalsofMine\n\nThe only positive from that SA tour is that we got 40 wickets in 2 matches against a team playing at home. There was nothing else to shout about as far as I am concerned.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nAgree, just tell the usual suspects to stop blaming one particular player and focus on overall team batting performances.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nSorry, I cannot help it but only West Indies team would replace a player with test average of 38.5, and inserted a player averaging 25.9, further hilarious when that replacement player ended up with match average of 21.50. But keep it on the down low for either they do not want us to know or they hope that we will ignore the facts.\n\nCricket_101\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nThey all had mediocre performances, except the the main bowlers...\n\nHolder and DeSilva showed grit and fight, the rest has Grade F.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Cricket_101\n\nAre you saying that Joseph gets F too?\n\nCricket_101\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nThey all had mediocre performances, except the the main bowlers...\n\nHolder, Roach and Joseph bowled exceptionally well. Our batting failed us.\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Cricket_101\n\nNo arguments there about the bowlers but why replace a lesser mediocre batsman with a more mediocre one?\n\nKay\n\nSo on a scale of 1-10\n\n2 batsmen rate 2\n\n3 rate 1\n\nthe others 0\n\nAnd we should all embellish our posts with smilies and jump up and wave.\n\nSome posters sick just like the players .......\n\nTheTrail\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nHolder's batting Ave......39.33\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to TheTrail\n\nAre you dreaming again my brother or you live in a fantasy world?\n\nHolder Test average: 29.5\n\nT20: 15.4\n\nODI: 24.3\n\nSources: ICC Stats\n\nopenning\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nYour thread is on Blackwood and Joseph topping batting and bowling.\n\nDukes informed you that Holder scored 81 not out, so his average cannot be 29.5, Trail now told you the correct average.\n\nIs Blackwood test average 31.5 as you stated?\n\nHere is the last series stats.\n\nLink Text\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nStats and caption updated to reflect Holders 81*, thanks for the link.\n\nTheTrail\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nIn reply to TheTrail\n\nAre you dreaming again my brother or you live in a fantasy world?\n\nHolder Test average: 29.5\n\nT20: 15.4\n\nODI: 24.3\n\nSources: ICC Stats\n\nSlippy , 0 -18 - 81* (not out) 19 = 118/ 3 = 39.33333333333 repeated\n\nunderstood??\n\nBrerzerk\n\nWas Slippy choosing to use series and or career avg for which suited his thrust??\n\nSurely no one could believe 13.5 was Mayers' career avg.\n\nCricket_101\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nNot sure who ur addressing, but Tage is a young cricketer with lots of potential. I dont know if u remember when Paint debuted, the bowling he face he never seen before, but learned and today is decent opener. Blackwood, Mayers Reifer, should be put on the chopping block, they are 1:10 ratio of good inning to Nada. I would make DaSila VC and the I aforementioned earned their selection\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Brerzerk\n\nNot his career but that is Mayers series average.\n\ntc1\n\nIn reply to Cricket_101\n\nSlipped was eager to show Blackwood heading g the avg. But his bubble was bust by Dukes\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nSlipfeeler\n\nIn reply to Cricket_101\n\nWell Reifer should not have replaced a player with a 38.5 average and who would be the replacements for Blackwood and Mayer? I am confident that the players you have in mind are far less talented than them . I know this because only Bonner has a higher test average than them and I am sure that Bonner was not on your mind.\n\nCricket_101\n\nIn reply to Slipfeeler\n\nWell Reifer should not have replaced a player with a 38.5 average and who would be the replacements for Blackwood and Mayer?\n\nIts call insularity with Reifer selection... And Mayers' had one good tour and is still living on that, which increased his avg., just like Bonner and was dropped for Reifer.\n\ngo figure... Haynes is the problem.\n\nSlipfeeler"
