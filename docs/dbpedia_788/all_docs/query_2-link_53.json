        "text": "What was Rahul Dravid's average against Australia and South Africa? Especially in their conditions? Are you now going to claim that Babar Azam is already a better batsman than 'The Wall'? You keep trying to pick holes in the careers of great players but fail to realize that, as of now, the likes of Shami and Bumrah have done nothing to warrant a comparison. Let Shami end his career and then we'll figure out who ended with more holes and who won more matches.\n\nShoaib Akhtar had around as many wickets as Shami does right now but at a far better average in both formats and as anyone who has watched the game will tell you, Akhtar's impact went beyond simple numbers.\n\nfar better average? are you sure?\n\nakthar was not only overrated, he was also a ped abuser, a cheater and had a terrible bowling average against the top nations of his time.\n\ndravid scored some match winning innings vs auatralia along with laxman. shoaib did nothing.\n\nNot nitpicking but if you dont perform vs the top teams then you shouldn't be ranked as a ATG level player.\n\nshami helped india win a series in australia. depleted or not; it doesn't matter. India have travelled plenty of times and faced a much weaker Australian side and still lost.\n\nIndia under virat are yet to lose a game when they win the toss.\n\nBut like Jimmy Broad, Ishant has only gone better. He averages under 27 since 2014. He too is an exception to rule. Shami is legendary in Asia and decent away. Not ATG but can be a great bowler, already halfway.\n\nBatsmen is equivalent to bowlers, not fast bowlers only. So, India also have Kumble, Bedi, Ashwin and Srinath.\n\nYou can't call him an exception when he's still around 30 years old. If Ishant is still around in a couple of years time, then you can place him in the category of Anderson and Broad. As for Shami, halfway is not much progress for someone who is almost 30. At best, Shami and Ishant will become two of India's best pace bowlers but greats of the game? That is beyond them.\n\nKumble, Bedi and Ashwin do not tilt the scales in any meaningful way. Pakistan's batsmen have been better than India's bowlers.\n\nYou can't call him an exception when he's still around 30 years old.

Pakistan's batsmen have been better than India's bowlers.\n\nFirstly, Shami is 29 and Ishant's age is 31.5. Ishant has been brilliant in the past five years and while he has 9 5-fer away only 2 at home but these days he is doing better at home also. So, Ishant is every bit becoming an exception to the rule just like Broad (33 year old now) was.\n\nShami is 29 and at peak of his career. He is halfway and has 177 wickets. So, considering he is a Sub continent player, it is highly likely that he will play till 37-38 and can get to 350+ test wickets which means longevity would no longer be a concern for him.\n\nThey aren't greats of the game but Shami and Kapil as bowler alone are country greats like Inzy and ever-smiling Khan. Only Bumrah has potential just like Babar has. But even from Pakistan, only Miandad is an ATG. Overall, it's pretty much equivalent between Pakistan batsmen and Indian bowler.\n\nFirstly, Shami is 29 and Ishant's age is 31.5.

He had injuries in past(which is why he has played slightly lesser games) and that kept him away from game.\n\nIt's in last four years that he has gone better and has become an integral member of this team and has been playing pretty much all the games for India. If he plays till 35, he will easily double the number of tests and end up comfortably with 160-170 more test wickets.\n\nHe has gone better with time and if he takes 130 wickets in next 45 matches he plays, his average will slip to 30 and considering how brilliant he has been in Asia its unlikely. I am quite sure he will easily take 150 more wickets or else if he doesn't then that means that average will slip to 30s.\n\nShami till now has played 48 tests and got 177 test wickets.

Then working his way back & slowly learning to take wickets all over the world... I respect Ishant as a Test bowler over Bumrah actually. Bumrah if he gets his zip back maybe better ODI.\n\nHistorically, Imran gets mad respect in Oz. We love him. Never heard anyone here talk him down really.\n\nOz past players often mention Wasim as the toughest or one of the toughest they ever faced- I'd say his name pops up as often as any other West Indian or whatnot. Oz fans (as opposed to players) are a bit more dubious on Wasim due to the fixing.\n\nZaheer Khan was respected- he held it together in Oz & was dangerous at home with old & new ball. Smart operator.\n\nI don't think we ever saw Waqar at his best out here. People accept he was a great bowler though. We've all seen the yorkers.\n\nOld Sarfraz Narwaz gets a lot of love out here actually- he often bowled well with Imran. He took buckets of wickets out here. Stuart Clarke used to get called \"Sarfraz\" because his bowling style reminded some of the action- that tells you how much Sarfraz was still remembered.\n\n[MENTION=150610]tyron_woodley[/MENTION] too\n\nWell there might be Aussie fans (a minority) who reflect those opinions but by and large, not true of most fans here.\n\nIshant actually gets a lot of respect here- anyone who remembers him at 18, charging in bowling 145k & nearing 150k and totally working over Ricky Ponting knew we were seeing something that could be special.

That dude was straight cannon fodder in australia and india.

Never have been. Never will be. Maybe in your delusional world. You aren't being objective here dummy.\n\nIndia's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah says he feels most comfortable bowling with the Dukes ball manufactured in England compared to the India made SG Test or the Australian Kookaburra as it provides even competition in a game that is increasingly loaded in favour of batsmen. In fact Bumrah is the latest Indian bowler to express his fondness for either Dukes or Kookaburra compared to SG Test that is used in India.\n\nBumrah during an interaction for ICC podcast with former West Indies pacer Ian Bishop and former South African captain Shaun Pollock spoke on a range of issues, including how he developed an outswinger (inswinger for left-handers) and secret of his eight-step run-up that generates extreme pace.\n\n\"I love bowling with Dukes. It seams, it swings, so basically when you have a little bit of help, it does help as it is difficult to be a fast bowler with grounds getting shorter and wickets getting flatter,\" Bumrah said during the interaction.\n\n\"So if the ball does something, it becomes even competition. So you feel you are in the game. With no help, you only have few things to play with. So I enjoy bowling most with Dukes ball.\" Bishop asked Bumrah about how he developed the outswinger, which becomes an inswinger for the left-handers and the India international called it a gradual process.\n\n\"I always want to bring new things. My different action, may be once or twice people will be surprised, but they will find you out. So you need to improve and keep on evolving.\n\n\"So I had the outswinger but when I came into the international set-up, I wasn't confident about it, may be it wasn't coming out well, may be the pace, you should have the feel of it. Slowly, you work on it in the nets. In the West Indies, the ball (Dukes with pronounced seam) was helpful, conditions were helpful,\" he said.\n\nBumrah said that many people advised him to increase his run-up but he felt that pace never increased with the length of his run-up which is around eight steps to load up.\n\nHis unconventional action has been under scanner for long with greats like Michael Holding terming it injury prone. He then divulged the secret of his short sprint to the crease.\n\n\"Basically, I have never been coached a lot. No professional coaching or camps. Till date, everything is self-taught, everything, through TV, videos. There is no proper reason for action. I have never really listened to people who told that action needs to be changed, kept on developing on strengths if I could have self belief,\" he said.\n\nPaucity of space in his backyard was the reason for such a run-up.\n\n\"Playing in backyard. My run-up is because of that as we didn't have so much of space, so this (8 step run up) is the longest that you could have had, may be this could have been the case. I have tried longer run-up and nothing changes, speed is still the same so why to run so much.\"\n\nhttps://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/jas...h-dukes-ball-as-it-assists-seam-swing-2238364"
