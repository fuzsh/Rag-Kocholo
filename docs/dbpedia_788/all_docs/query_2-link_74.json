        "text": "In business, making decisions on the spot is a critical task since data is available online. Same applies for sports. For managers and coaches selection of best fit player in the team has to be made. Many times, team managers have to bid for the players. Many statistical methods are applied in order to evaluate a player for sports, specially, baseball, and football. This paper focuses on Cricket since it has been deprived of good statistical methods. Typically, for cricket, Deep Performance Index (DPI) method is used to evaluate a player. But it has some limitations. This work aims to assimilate the best features of the previous approaches and losing the drawbacks. An algorithm is devised for statistical analysis of cricket data and particularly Indian Premier League (IPL) data which can be later extended to other sports with minor customizations. The algorithm considers context of the player in terms of indices like most valuable player index for batsman and for bowler. The important context introduced is winning contribution ratio of the player. The algorithm is tested on IPL and proves to be comparable with DPI. Hypothesis testing is performed to validate the results.\n\nCricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the center of which is a rectangular 22 yard long pitch.Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. The main objective of any team is to win the match. The result of a match is a win when one side scores more runs than the opposing side and all the innings of the team that has fewer runs have been completed. The performance evaluation in cricket is very critical issue in this game.Performance of players directly affects team`s and their ranking internationally. Hence, the success or failure of any team lies in the skills and abilities of the players that comprise the team.This paper proposed a new tool based on Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate the performance of a cricket player. FIS is a process to formulate the mapping from given input to an output using fuzzy logic. Various new parameters are used in this tool which can make affect on the performances of players and can improve the quality of performance evaluation in cricket. This tool will be useful to make the ranking of players and for the selection of players based on performances.\n\nThe quantitative study of sports data, especially cricket team sport is an interesting field. This paper investigates the efficiency of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounder who participated in the Indian Premier League competition 2019. First, input data and output data were validated using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and then Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a Linear Programming (LP) based technique was used for evaluating the efficiency measurement of the batsmen, bowlers and all-rounder by ranking them on the basis of DEA Scores. The Auction Price was also taken as a parameter for evaluating the value for money spent on each player. The ranking without auction price is based solely on Cricketing parameters. Cricketing parameters along with Auction price depicts the ranking from the context of value for money. The results assist the decision makers in figuring out the position of the players on the basis of Cricketing performance as well as Cricketing return based on the money ...\n\nBowling and batting have always been the most important aspects of the game of cricket. But with advent of the newest version of cricket with twenty overs-a-side the task of the bowlers are believed to have become difficult. This paper attempts to use the combined bowling rate to quantify the performance of a sample of bowlers who participated in the fourth season of the Indian Premier League. Based on relevant literature a set of predictors that can influence the performance of the bowlers were determined. Multiple linear regression technique was then used to identify the reasons that are empirically responsible for the performance of the bowlers. It was also observed that experience of the bowler and combined bowling rate at Tewnty20 internationals are the most significant predictors that are responsible for the performance of bowlers in IPL IV.\n\nIndian Premier League is a very competitive tournament where team selection is a very tricky and tedious procedure. Analysis of sports data and Prediction of each player's performance helps in filtering the best players. A novel method employing the techniques of Data Analytics and Data Visualization is used in this research paper to extract individual player performance from huge statistics and datasets. An application is created to bridge the space between selecting team, coaches, and team management and to give a better interpretation on player steadiness, scoring and further capabilities. In this paper, pandas library is used for data analysis and manipulation tool, Microsoft azure is used for performance prediction and HTML, CSS, flask for the front-end application. Additionally, various machine learning algorithms are applied on the same data to find the best fit. The proposed application can be beneficial for team managements and decision making"
