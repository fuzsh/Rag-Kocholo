        "text": "Faith No More was never a band to play it safe and that is one of the things I’ve always loved about them. Throughout their history, especially when Mike Patton joined, Faith No More was always a band that pushed limits and tried new things whether they worked or not. Back in 1995, there were a few times while on tour when Faith No More would add a cover to their set and this cover happened to be “Glory Box” by the one and only Portishead. It’s a solid cover and Mike adds his touch to it which makes it all that much more enjoyable. I personally would love to hear Mike cover a couple other Portishead songs as I think he’d do them justice!\n\nFaith No More (Portishead)- Glory Box:\n\nFaith No More are an absolutely tremendous band. They are one of the few bands that have the ability to evolve in a way that is untouchable. The versatility of the band and how damn good each member compliments each other shows on each album, no matter who is in the line up. I personally am very partial to the Jim Martin era. I’ve always thought he brought such a unique touch to the songs. That’s in no way a shot at Jon Hudson or Tre Spruance. I will always be bummed I didn’t get to see Faith No More with Jim but, when I get that time machine, you bet your ass I’ll be going back to see Faith No More with Jim. That being said, this performance here, is Jim’s last with the band. It’s a pretty awesome performance and how. The setlist is pure gold and the energy on stage is contagious.\n\nFaith No More- Live July 17, 1993 / Phoenix Festival / Stratford-upon-Avon, England:\n\nFaith No More’s album Angel Dust is an absolute masterpiece. From start to finish, it’s a work of art. The moment, “Land Of Sunshine” begins, you know you are in for a treat. The song itself has a very interesting history too. The song was released as the second single. The lyrics contain, amongst other things, questions from Scientology personality tests, with one of them, the question “Does emotional music have quite an effect on you?” Mike Patton also wrote more lyrics to this song, during a sleep deprivation experiment and included lines taken almost directly from fortune cookies and the Oxford Capacity Analysis personality test offered by the Church of Scientology. He also watched much late-night television to get into the right frame of mind. “Land Of Sunshine” is an absolute banger and live, holy hell is it huge!\n\nFaith No More- Land Of Sunshine:\n\nLand Of Sunshine (Live 1993):\n\nThe great thing about Faith No More is that they always did what they wanted to do. Their music was never easily classified, it ranged from metal, jazz, funk, rock, psychedelia, new wave, and then some. The band with Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould, Mike “Puffy” Bordin Jim Martin and Chuck Mosley released one album Introduce Yourself featuring the song “We Care A Lot.” When Mike Patton took over for Chuck Mosley, everything fell in to place. Their success took hold when The Real Thing was released. Featuring the songs Epic, From Out Of Nowhere, Falling To Pieces and the great cover of War Pigs. That album plus play on MTV garnered them plenty of exposure. Their follow up album Angel Dust was a departure from their previous effort. Songs like Midlife Crisis, Caffeine, Land Of Sunshine and Jizzlobber to name a few were far more experimental. After touring that album Jim left and was replaced by Trey Spruance (Mike’s bandmate in the great band Mr. Bungle). They would go on and record the album King For A Day… Fool For A Lifetime. The album stepped up the experiments venturing into the world of bossa nova, country, and gospel. Songs like Evidence, Digging The Grave. Their final opus Album Of The Year was released in 1997 and featured Jon Hudson on guitar. Ashes to Ashes, Last Cup Of Sorrow amongst others highlight this piece of work.\n\nThe individuals of the band are quite influential to many people in their own right. Mike Patton especially. His vocal style is undeniable and his ability to hit certain ranges is incredible. His numerous other projects including Fantomas, Tomahawk, Mr. Bungle (R.I.P.), Peeping Tom, etc are all influential and quite awesome. Billy Gould’s bass tone is copied by many in the heavy rock community. Mike Bordin is a beast behind the kit. After the break up of Faith No More, he would go on to play for Ozzy. Roddy Bottum is a mater of the keys. His arrangements and effects really helped to make Faith No More substantial. Their guitarists Jim Martin , Trey Spruance and Jon Hudson all different helped to shape the sound of each album they played on and it shows.\n\nFaith No More reunited for a bit between 2009 and 2012. Sadly they have said that is it for now. Hopefully they change their minds.\n\nBy: Brian Lacy"
