        "text": "Roswell Christohper \"Roddy\" Bottum III is the keyboardist for Faith No More.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nRoddy was born on July 1st, 1963 in Los Angeles, California. From an early age he played classical piano before forming Faith No More.\n\nContributions to Faith No More[]\n\nBottum joined his school friends Billy Gould and Mike Bordin in 1982, replacing Wade Worthington in the band. He stayed in the band until it broke up in 1998, and is still a current band member. After Angel Dust was released in 1992, Roddy's contribution to the band was lowered significantly because of the death of his father that year. In 1994, Bottum formed a band called Imperial Teen, a band best known for its single \"Yoo Hoo\". Since Faith No More's reformation in 2009, Roddy has stayed a member.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nIn 1993, Bottum came out as a homosexual. He stated in a magazine's article, \"I would never have thought as a gay teen I'd be in a band that would be considered heavy metal or hard rock.\" One of his larger contributions to Faith No More was a song titled \"Be Aggressive\", a song about gay oral sex. He wrote it as a joke to see how humiliated a straight lead singer could be performing that song on stage-- \"Be Aggressive\" is now the second most performed song in Faith No More concerts.\n\nBefore coming out as gay, Bottum briefly dated Courtney Love when she was in Faith No More, and the two remain friends to this day."
