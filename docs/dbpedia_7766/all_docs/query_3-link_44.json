We’d do a song with a traditional verse/chorus vibe and then do a freak out in which things could be added however the singer determined.\" Roddy Bottum | THE REAL THING 30 | Q and A with MIKE BORDIN, RODDY BOTTUM and BILL GOULD\n\n\"We had about a year between singers so we had had a fair amount of time to rehearse them together. I believe most of the tracking went fairly quickly.\" Billy Gould | THE REAL THING 30 | Q and A with MIKE BORDIN, RODDY BOTTUM and BILL GOULD\n\n\"We were touring absolutely as hard as we were able to, doing so internationally, and mostly in a bubble.\" \"We wrote, as we have always said, directly reflecting where we had been prior to that point, and also reflecting our growing experience in just physically performing what we had previously written live.\n\nJust sorta feeling instinctively what works/doesn't, and evolving from there.\" Mike Bordin | THE REAL THING 30 | Q and A with MIKE BORDIN, RODDY BOTTUM and BILL GOULD\n\n\"The band was down in Los Angeles for a while when they were a 4 piece (no Chuck Mosley) so we were rehearsing some of the music they’d recently written. It’s interesting because all the music was written before Patton came on board so any and all ‘progression’ from 'IY' to 'TRT' is strictly the band trying to grow and continue to push boundaries. The music was exciting and, being a FNM fan, I really liked it but you never know what you have in terms of actual songs until the singer steps up to the microphone.\" Matt Wallace | THE REAL THING 30 | Matt Wallace remembers the recording of 'The Real Thing'\n\n\"Working with Patton was like trying to ride a bull or a racing motorcycle in that he was absolutely prepared to write and sing and deliver the songs and he was (and still is) an exceptional singer. He and I had disagreements about ‘tone’ and the fact that we weren’t able to capture the full range of his voice. But, I don’t believe that I’ve ever worked with anyone who was built to sing like Patton because he made everything sound and appear to be effortless but, if you really listen, he’s doing some amazing singing, phrasing, and lyric and melody writing.\" Matt Wallace | THE REAL THING 30 | Matt Wallace remembers the recording of 'The Real Thing'\n\nRoddy \"Mike sang so well, I remember that. It was kind of shocking. Remember, we’d been playing with Chuck for a long time and yeah…. night and day. He was younger than us. Way more into like… sports and we had different references. But we laughed at the same things. He had a cynicism that I related to, we all related to. The first rehearsal was a ‘get to know each other’ sort of thing. He sang 'Falling to Pieces' and was abashedly kind of ‘poppy’ about it and I liked that right away. Like he wasn’t scared to go for that sound.\" \"...it was really clear that he was so good at so many different styles of singing. There wasn’t a lot he couldn’t do.\"\n\n\"We were such brats, yknow? We were young and really into just getting reactions from people. Part of that came from playing on tours with bands like Billy Idol or Metallica or Guns and Roses…. bands who liked us but their audiences didn’t really. So to get a reaction we all kind of pushed buttons. Mike saw this attitude in us immediately and kind of jumped on board. Looking back at it I don’t find it real brilliant but I do see it as provocative and I can still appreciate that.\" THE REAL THING 30 | Q and A with MIKE BORDIN, RODDY BOTTUM and BILL GOULD\n\nBilly \"I remember hearing this album mixed for the first time and what shocked me is that we actually sounded like a 'real' rock band…as strange as this sounds, I had never imagined myself being in one before. And once I heard it, it already was a success to me. The truth was, that we were still quite under the radar and it would take almost two years of touring to get it over the net. But I had much greater sense of satisfaction on the final mixing day than I did when it eventually went platinum. And I would not have expected that.\" THE REAL THING 30 | Q and A with MIKE BORDIN, RODDY BOTTUM and BILL GOULD\n\nFrom Out Of Nowhere\n\nThe Real Thing 1989\n\nThe Story Behind The Song: From Out Of Nowhere by Faith No More | Louder\n\n“We were in a weird place at the time,” Bottum recalls, “having just lost a singer. I think I felt it more than the others. I was pretty close to Chuck. We were taking stock and starting over, but the mood among the four of us was pretty optimistic.”\n\n“Billy, Mike Bordin and I wrote that song together at our rehearsal space in Hunter’s Point. It was among the first batch of songs that we wrote after Chuck left the band. Typically, the three of us would get the skeleton of a song going on, and then get Jim Martin to put his guitar part on. Sometimes, Billy would write [Martin’s] guitar part for him, but I think in the case of From Out Of Nowhere, he wrote his own part.”\n\n“[Patton] came in and did the melody and the lyrics. All of the music of the songs on The Real Thing was written prior to Mike joining the band. He sat with the songs for a couple of weeks and wrote all his vocal parts. Really fast.”\n\nWhy Faith No More Wanted Mike Patton for ‘The Real Thing’\n\n“It was Patton's first foray into a big studio record,\" keyboardist Bottum remembered. \"Given where he was coming from as a young man from a small town, he had a lot to prove. And you can hear that on the tracks. You can hear him really working hard in that regard. So all of a sudden he came down and sang these songs we created and we were all just kind of like, ‘Whoa.’” He continued: “Mike really went places after The Real Thing. After that record, the whole notion of pleasing people went out the window and we just enjoyed ****ing off and doing whatever we wanted.”\n\nFaith No More - From out of Nowhere\n\nFaith No More - From out of Nowhere - Listen on Deezer\n\n‎From Out of Nowhere by Faith No More\n\nFrom out of Nowhere\n\nGoogle Play Music\n\nThe Real Thing is where I got on board. I was in 8th grade and saw Epic on MTV and like many others I dug what I heard and bought the album. Heavy music was the only current music I listened to at the time and FNM fit right into my listening regiment.\n\nNot long after buying the album the Asian guy at the mall who sold heavy metal tshirts got the very first Faith No More tshirts sold in our area. And in a rare move of greed he had a sign that said the FNM shirts were $16.99 instead of the usual $12.99 due to the limited supply and high demand. They were really the hot thing at the time.\n\nWell, I paid the extra money, put the shirt right in and wore it with pride.\n\nWish I could still fit into my old L sized metal shirts from my teens.\n\nWhat was it that I liked so much about them? The singer with the nice clean looking hair? The dreadlocked drummer? The fish? The crazy looking metal guy shredding on guitar and wearing uncoordinated red glasses? Yes... I think that was it. Cliff Burton tee another plus (I was already a huge Metallica fan). I likes my music heavy and Jim's riffing provided the heft I required.\n\nAnyway... From Out Of Nowhere is a great opener. Great hook. Big chords from Roddy which always make magical things happen.\n\nGetting on board with Real Thing, I wasnt initially familiar with their previous stuff. Eventually I'd track down tapes of the first two records. I like the Chuck stuff. But I really don't see how much farther they could go with him. Patton was so much more versatile. But sometimes I try to imagine in my head what post-Chuck songs would sound like with Chuck. I think some of them would have still succeeded. From Out of Nowhere is one of them. The track is pretty infallible.\n\nI'm definitely listening through the prism of \"What would Chuck do?\", and I think young Patton did as well, moreso on the songs with rapping and shouting.\n\nI do mourn, and attempt to extrapolate, a Real Thing with Chuck. The Real Thing could've been the graduation of that sound to it's interstellar hyperstate, and over the album it does get to be, but it's a more radio friendly late 80s slick with Patton's proper singing, where Chuck would've been forced I think to get angrier and emotionally sever.\n\nThis is coming from a Patton-ite. I came in as a 5 year old that watched too much TV and had all the time in the world for the wacky guy in the lightning, and was massively into that song, it was \"my favourite song\". I didn't hear the album, including this song, until I had the means - June 1997 - to buy the album. I then first saw the video when the band hosted Rage, as a 13 year old. The cover image I posted is from the copy I bought with I think birthday money. CD remains unscratched. I didn't take care of my school uniform, or my general health, or school work, but my CDs were handled with care.\n\nBack to the song, it's fun!\n\nCan't discern any meaning from the words, but they sound good. The band sound assured and focused, and they attribute that to heavy rehearsal, but when we get to Brixton Academy.. I credit some of the professionalism to editing. Although there are some demos about I've yet to explore that might sway my view on that, if I can find them again.."
