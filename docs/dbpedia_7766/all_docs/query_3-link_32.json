        "text": "If you were hoping the recent announcement that Faith No More will be playing shows in 2020 meant that there’d be new Faith No More music on the horizon, uh… maybe don’t read this new Kerrang! interview with keyboardist Roddy Bottum:\n\n“You know, there’s no plans right now to record any new music. There’s no plans at all. I think we’re all at an age, or at a time in our lives, where looking back at what we’ve done is a profound place to be. I’m super-proud of what we’ve done in a way that I haven’t been before. I think maybe some years ago it did feel a little bit dirty, like we were taking advantage of the world by just going out there and playing old songs, but for whatever reason I’m in a different place with that right now. I think our legacy speaks for itself in the way the world is right now. It’s refreshing and it’s appropriately provocative to throw ourselves into the world again. It’s a good example of eccentric leftism, if you will.”\n\nInterestingly, Bottum was singing a different tune barely more than a year ago. I wonder what changed between now and then? Maybe some of the band’s members are only willing to play shows and not make the longer-term comittment of recording a new album?\n\nRegardless of their reasons, I’m of two minds about the decision. On the one hand, I loved Sol Invictus, and given that Faith No More were always such a forward-thinking band, it seems like kind of bummer for them to not make any music. On the other hand… hey dude, I get it. Despite my ardor for Sol Invictus, I would not have wept had the band cut those newer songs from their setlist in favor of squeezing in a few more old classics. And I know some fans didn’t feel as warmly towards Invictus as I did. Plus, it takes serious balls to admit to being a legacy band. I mean I’m grateful Metallica shows have so many built-in beer breaks, butttttt…\n\nHere’s the entirety of Faith No More’s 2020 touring plans as they currently stand:"
