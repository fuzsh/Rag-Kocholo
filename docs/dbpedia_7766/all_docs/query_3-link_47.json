        "text": "Sleeping Giant Glossolalia has set a July 26 release date for the self-titled debut album by NASTIE BAND.\n\nWith leather, chains, macabre makeup, and a cast of characters including an 81-year-old vocalist, shirtless twin brothers, and iconic keyboard player Roddy Bottum (FAITH NO MORE, IMPERIAL TEEN),NASTIE BAND is one of New York City's most thrilling new spectacles.\n\nThe sound: spine-chilling dirges, for fans of the creepiest depths of SUNN O))) or TODAY IS THE DAY's early work. The album opens and closes with songs featuring octogenarian Chris Kachulis's croon — a damaged, pining voice, in the spirit of the late Scott Walker. Fans of early electronic music know Kachulis as a collaborator of Bruce Haack; he sang on Haack's 1970 album \"The Electric Lucifer\", among other things.\n\n\"I've often stopped and wondered why I appeal to men / Men cluster to me like moths around a flame / And if their wings get burned I am not to blame,\" he intones maniacally on NASTIE BAND's first track.\n\nOver seven songs, the band descends deep into dungeon atmospherics and minimalist metal, punctuated by Bottum's icy, signature synths. From the hypnotic throb of \"Shapeshift\" to the battle march of \"Circle Of Knives\" to the dance-terror of \"Relapse\", NASTIE BAND's art-doom crackles with the type of danger, darkness, and drama that once defined New York City.\n\nMasterminded by Sandy Smiles — the alter ego of visual artist Frank Haines, whose body of work includes film, stained glass, performance art, and more — NASTIE BAND's lineup has morphed since its inception and still might change from show to show. Appearing on the album are Haines, Kachulis, Bottum, guitarist Patrick Delaney (ex-VILLAINS, POLLUTION),twin brothers David and Tradd Sanderson (ex-CREAM ABDUL BABAR),drummer Elsner Nino (ex-MERCHANDISE, POLLUTION),artist Reuben Lorch-Miller, and vocalist Inyang Bassey (MOBY). Since the time of the recording, drummer Hisham Bharoocha (BLACK DICE, SOFT CIRCLE) has taken over the drum throne from Nino.\n\n\"Nastie Band\" was recorded at Seizures Palace in Brooklyn by Jason LaFarge (SWANS, DEVENDRA BANHART, OPENING BELL) and mastered by James Plotkin (MERZBOW, SUNN O))), GNAW).\n\nFirst single, \"Shapeshift\", will be released June 14 on cassette as a maxi-single containing ten remix versions of the song, by members of NASTIE BAND, DÄLEK, OPENING BELL and ORNAMENT.\n\n\"Shapeshift RMXXXD\" maxi-single track listing:\n\n01. Shapeshift - original album version\n\n02. Shapeshift - Castrati remix\n\n03. Shapeshift - DSwarm remix\n\n04. Shapeshift - Decimation Blvd remix\n\n05. Shapeshift - Ornament remix\n\n06. Shapeshift - M.A.L. remix\n\n07. Shapeshift - PFV remix\n\n08. Shapeshift - Sandy Smiles remix\n\n09. Shapeshift - Ancient Remains remix\n\n10. Shapeshift - Opening Bell remix\n\n11. Shapeshift - Activated Corpse remix\n\n\"Nastie Band\" album track listing:\n\n01. Falling In Love\n\n02. Shapeshift\n\n03. Lucifer's Grotto\n\n04. Circle Of Knives\n\n05. The Widening\n\n06. Relapse\n\n07. A Summer With A Thousand Julys\n\nNASTIE BAND will play an official \"Shapeshift RMXXXD\" release show on June 13 at Brooklyn Bazaar in New York."
