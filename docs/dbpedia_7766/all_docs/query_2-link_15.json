However as we’ll learn, Roddy is a musician with a prolific and diverse output, which includes the indie pop sensibilities of Imperial Teen, the dancey electronica of Crickets and the doomy metal of Nastie Band – all current projects. Add to this his current COVID isolation inspired collaboration with his Partner Joey Holman and his film score and opera work, it’s fair to say that Roddy is not only an excellent keyboard player, but a truly creative artist with plenty to share.\n\nLinks to content mentioned during the show:\n\nFaith No More – Live 2015 at Hellfest\n\nRoland Juno 6\n\nThe amazing Duane Hitchings\n\nMan On Man – Baby, You’re My Everything\n\nE-mu Emax\n\nSequential OB-6\n\nAfrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force – Planet Rock\n\nAfricola Restaurant in Adelaide\n\nImperial Teen – Don’t Wanna Let You Go\n\nRoddy’s Film and TV compositions\n\nFred\n\nNastie Band – Falling In Love Again\n\nCrickets – Elastic\n\nSasquatch: The Opera\n\nRoddy’s Bandcamp releases\n\nDesert Island Discs: Self-Titled – Roxy Music, The Wiz Soundtrack, 1999 – Prince, 20 Jazz Funk Greats – Throbbing Gristle, Hunky Dory – David Bowie.\n\nDon’t forget to click on any of the subscribe links to automatically have each episode download, or just click play on the player above to listen right here.\n\nWe’re always keen to hear from you: drop us a line via the website, Facebook, or Twitter.
