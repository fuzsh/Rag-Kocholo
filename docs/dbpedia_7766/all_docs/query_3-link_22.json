        "text": "\"We're always checking in with each other. Twenty years ago, that was never the case. We were such jerks.\"\n\nThe reunions of notable rock bands have been an especially consistent narrative in music for the past two decades.\n\nAs members mature and lucrative offers start flying across the table, past grievances begin to appear petty. Sometimes friendships are repaired in the process, sometimes it's just a matter of figuring out a serviceable working relationship between members.\n\nFrom the Eagles to Pixies to Sleater-Kinney to Guns N' Roses, there are now dozens of veteran acts who, often against the odds, have once again become ongoing concerns.\n\nIn 2009, it was Faith No More's turn.\n\n\"I think we've let go of any sort of resentments and anger,\" keyboardist Roddy Bottum told Double J's Zan Rowe in 2020.\n\n\"When we got back together, everyone had matured by 10 years. If we were where we were 10 years prior, we were a lot more obnoxious and bratty as individuals. Being 10 years older, I think we all sort of have a little more respect for each other.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nHear the Faith No More J Files above:\n\nThe Los Angeles experimental alt-metal behemoth had split in 1998. The initial critical response to their 1997 record Album Of The Year had been cold, though it's viewed more warmly in retrospect.\n\nOn top of that, its members were torn between the band and their increasingly popular side projects, like frontman Mike Patton's Mr. Bungle and Bottum's Imperial Teen.\n\nBottum acknowledged that there has perhaps been a little overcorrection when establishing their new dynamic.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy, in a ridiculous way,\" he laughed. \"In a California psychotherapy sort of vibe.\n\n\"When we get together and we start running ideas past each other, we're super over the top respectful. 'Are you okay with that? I'm okay with that. Are you sure you're okay with that?'\n\n\"We're always kind of checking in with each other. Which is something that, 20 years ago, that was never the case. We were such jerks.\n\n\"But I think these days we just let things go. We are a lot kinder to each other.\"\n\nAnyone who saw the band on their two visits to Australia for the Soundwave festival since reforming knows this newfound kindness hasn't translated to a softening of their onstage output.\n\n\"The dynamic of the sound of the music, there's no arguing,\" Bottum said. \"It's always gonna be loud. A highly energetic and really loud and abrasive tone.\"\n\nWhich might go some way to explaining why Bottum was feeling a little unsure when that first reformation. Faith No More's bombastic hard rock was a very different proposition to the sleek indie pop of Imperial Teen.\n\n\"I remember getting back together and it was like, 'How will I ever remember these songs?'\" he said.\n\n\"I had no idea. But it's a weird thing, you start playing them and physical memory just kicks in and it just comes back really easily.\n\n\"I have to keep that in mind. Like, it's not hard. It's something that I've done like a million times. But I freak myself out and think, 'Oh my God, how am I gonna remember this song. I have no idea'.\"\n\nThe earliest iteration of Faith No More formed in 1979, and one of the most exciting things about seeing a band with a history as long and rich as theirs is noticing the evolution of their work.\n\n\"I think the songs change and we've played them all so many times, there's always specific moments that are associated with a song, specific touring things,\" Bottum said.\n\n\"There are certain ones that are sort of moody that go places [where] we maybe do a little improv when we're playing them. 'King For A Day' is one that's really always really fun to play.\"\n\nNo matter how big and influential a band is, it's human nature to second guess your creative work and want to improve upon already celebrated work.\n\n\"We tend to get a little impatient,\" Bottum says. \"When we start rehearsing the songs for the shows, I think we over edit. We start saying, 'That's too long. That was really indulgent. Why did we play that part for that long? Let's cut it in half'. We start doing that.\n\n\"I think we're really strict at first, but then I think it's best to play them the way that they were written.\"\n\nFans of the band from the early days will be pleased to hear that the band members are equally excited about airing music from the band's first couple of records, even before their now-iconic frontman Mike Patton had joined.\n\n\"There's a sickness in me that really likes making Mike sing the old Chuck [Mosley – Faith No More frontman from 1984 – 1988] songs.\n\n\"On the first two records we had a different singer and I like when Mike sings those songs and sort of puts a different spin on those songs. Those are fun, like, even 'We Care A Lot' [1985 single for which Bottum wrote the lyrics]. It's really fun. It's a really fun and energetic song.\n\n\"And I really like 'Be Aggressive'.\"\n\nThat song, a fairly graphic portrayal of fellatio that appears on the band's monumental 1992 album Angel Dust, is one of Bottum's most notable contributions to the Faith No More catalogue.\n\nAt the time of its release, he said he took great joy in having Patton sing its lyrics.\n\n\"Talk about bratty stupid moves,\" Bottum chuckled. \"Well, not stupid… It's just really obnoxious that I would do that. Write a song about gay men and oral sex and make Mike sing it. Why would I do that?!\"\n\nBottum says it's testament to the talent of the band's frontman that he inhabited the character he'd written so effectively.\n\n\"I think he rose to the challenge, and he really likes it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that's something that Mike does really well, slips into different characters. I think he handled that role in that song really well.\"\n\nThere are plenty of things that appeal about Faith No More. The band's expert musicality, the aforementioned energy, volume and abrasion that serves as a kind of ultimate catharsis, the magnetism of Mike Patton.\n\nPerhaps the thing that has made its fans so passionate is that the band genuinely don't sound like anything else.\n\n\"When we started our band, we were just such a weird band from San Francisco,\" Bottum recalled.\n\n\"It was such a weird environment. In the 80s, being in San Francisco, it was a crazy mix of like weird old hippies and young punk rock kids. We were sort of in the middle of that and just had a lot of different things that we liked at the time.\n\n\"We were listening to the crazy old reggae and we were listening to crazy punk rock stuff and listening to a lot of classical music, and then a lot of rap music was getting started. It was just a really interesting time for music, there was so much going on.\"\n\nThat the band was a product of this diverse musical environment makes a lot of sense in hindsight. When you consider the monumental success of the band – they've sold something in the vicinity of 10 million records – it seems smart.\n\nIt wasn't always that way.\n\n\"I don't even know why we thought we would be able to combine elements of some of those musics and bring pieces of cultures together,\" Bottum admitted. \"But that's what we set out to do.\n\n\"It felt ridiculous at the time, but I'm glad that it's something that was appreciated and spoke to a lot of people.\n\n\"But it's really rewarding and flattering to hear that it would influence other people making music to sort of say that it's possible to combine elements from all sorts of different musical platforms. That's neat.\n\n\"I would hope that that will be something that we've contributed to the world of music.\"\n\nWhile COVID initially scuppered plans for Faith No More's next chapter, which was to kick off with a big Australian tour, the band's ambitions are presently on hold while Mike Patton focuses on his mental health.\n\nWhen that Australian tour was announced in 2020, Bottum said Faith No More hadn't intended on making a new record. Though he also said the band had felt similarly before the release of 2015's Sol Invictus.\n\n\"I'm not really sure,\" he told Zan. \"The last time we got back together, we sort of decided we weren't really gonna make another record, but we ended up making another record.\n\n\"We've always spoken about, like 'No, that's not something we're gonna do this time. We're not making new music'.\n\n\"But I don't know. When we're around each other and everyone's sitting around and you have instruments, it's hard not to make me music. I don't know, we'll just have to see what happens, but we have no plans at making new music at this point.\""
