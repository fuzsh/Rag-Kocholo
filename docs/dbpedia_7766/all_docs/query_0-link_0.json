        "text": "I never hear Roddy Bottom mentioned here, and as a Faith No More fan I want to spotlight his keyboard work with the band.\n\nNo one could add more majestic strings and piano to a progressive metal/rock band than Roddy. Many of the bands you hear on contemporary rock radio borrow from Roddy's work with FNM; Evanescence, Linkin Park, Lacuna Coil, etc... all come to mind.\n\nRoddy wasn't just a guy who programmed sequencers and twiddled nobs, he is a classically trained piano player and performed all of his parts (with the exception of some experimenting on \"Album of the Year\" with sequencing) live to tape.\n\nRoddy maintained a pretty slim rig and preferred to let his chops do the talking. Here's some gear used over the years IIRC:\n\n\"We Care A Lot\" and \"Introduce Yourself\": Not sure. Any help? Looks like an Emax in the \"Anne's Song\" video.\n\n\"The Real Thing\": Emu Emax and acoustic grand piano. Used 2 Emaxes live stacked on a stand, usually one for piano and one for strings.\n\n\"Angel Dust\": Emu Emax II, Kurzweil K1000 rack mount, acoustic grand piano\n\n\"King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime\": I've heard he used a K2000 on the album. I know he used one live.\n\n\"Album of the Year\": Kurzweil K2000, Roland JV-1080. I saw FNM live in September 1997 and Roddy used an Emax II and a K2500.\n\nFor samples I've heard Roddy mostly used stock Emu samples and the ROM section of the K2000.\n\nEssential viewing is the \"Making of Angel Dust\" footage, easily found on YouTube. Roddy and Billy Gould gave a good interview in \"Keyboard\" in 1997.\n\nAnyone have anything they'd like to contribute?\n\nnice signature Hulston\n\nImperial Teen is a very good band, but since I'm only passingly familiar with them I'll keep to talking about RB's work in Faith No More.\n\nFNM are hometown heroes, along with Primus, Metallica and Green Day(we won't mention them anymore). One of my best friends happens to be Jim Martin's cousin, btw.\n\nFNM are one of the greatest heavy bands, some would say the last great heavy band. Has there been anyone since them with anywhere near the range, originality, pure force-of-nature delivery and unbeatable chemistry? Tool and a few others come to mind, but lack the range, funkability, hits and , um, well... MIKE PATTON. Like Public Enemy meets Black Sabbath, coached by Frank Zappa - but better. I have over 3 dozen Zappa CDs, and all the Sabbath & PE so that should say something.\n\nRoddy Bottum did a lot to distinguish FNM from every other band. They were the only band with a keyboard player that could be as heavy and bone-crushing as anyone. Bottum's coda parts in 'Epic' & 'Jizzlobber' became his signature, giving the arrangements scope beyond the usual. He flew in sample grabs with more musical regularity than anyone else I can think of.\n\nTheir renditions of 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Easy' are centered around Roddy's playing.\n\nANGEL DUST imo is their peak - every cut on that recording screams brilliance and an ability to cut through every conceivable obstacle, including shoddy marketing no-thanks to Warner Bros.\n\nAll of FNM's albums are keepers, though.\n\nThanks for the gear list Hulston! I have wondered for years what he used to accomplish those grand arrangements for FNM. I am going to have to go back and check out those old live videos now.\n\nI have been a huge admirer of his work since grade school days with The Real Thing in the boombox. Whenever people try to compare RHCP with FNM I am just like \"Are you even paying attention the keyboards man???\"... RHCP doesn't even come close to the depth and diversity of sound of FNM. It was just very sad to see it end in 1997 with Roddy Bottum doing nothing of interest since. I know he did some soundtracks but ehh. As for Imperial Teen, I hate it. It's the opposite of what he did in FNM.\n\nFNM is long overdue for a reunion. I never got a chance to see them live! I don't want to wait till they are all in their 50s cuz then it will just be sad.\n\nYou do know he is gay, right? Like the inspirational poster boy for gay dudes that aren't doing the typical gay lifestyle cliches. It doesn't bother me, but he did write a lot of the lyrics in FNM that are associated with gay themes like \"Be Aggressive\".\n\nAnyway, kudos for starting the Roddy Bottum thread. Unsung greatness right there.\n\nI never got a chance to see them live!\n\nI saw them about 6 times including @ The Warfield(3X), Concord Pavilion, Kaiser Center and the best rock show I've ever seen out of hundreds : Davis ,CA 1992. They used to come onstage (Patton anyways , but that's another matter), do warm-up jumping jacks and tear right into 'Caffeine', extending the middle part (\"...i'm warning you...i'm Fuc*ing you!\")...distinctly remember super-heavy renditions of \"As the Worm Turns\" & \"Jizzlobber\" that night. Patton body-slamming cartwheels over-and-over.\n\nA force of freeeeaking nature. Total ferocity and distrust towards \"fans\", just like it ought to be! Flailing \"Mike\" cords, and Puffy dredds, Jim & Roddy doin' the powerstance, while Gould coaxes thunder from a massive stack of Peavy bass amps.\n\nSome of the best times of my life.\n\nI wanted to BE Jim Martin for several years. Would have auditioned for the guitar spot in '94 but I was rather green at the time.\n\nYeah, Roddy's gay. Growing up by San Francisco one learns to take things in stride and just get on with it; not get hung up with anyone's sexual preferences. I think it adds to their humor, anyway.\n\nThey could dis and emulate damn near anybody with conviction and great style - not a band on earth can do what they did anymore, even the Zappa alumni.\n\nwhoa i better get outta here....try to find a book called \"The Real Story\" published in ~94 written by a journalist/longtime fan Steffan Chirazi(sp?). It's packed w/ outstanding one-on-one interviews with tons of great photos.\n\nLong out of print, and apparently expensive:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Faith-No-More-Real-Story/dp/1898141150\n\nOnly covers history up to 1993, but it's a GREAT book, no question."
