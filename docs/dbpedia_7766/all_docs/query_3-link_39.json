        "text": "Roddy Bottum says that he has been making new music with his FAITH NO MORE bandmates Mike Bordin and Billy Gould, three years after the release of the group's acclaimed comeback album, \"Sol Invictus\".\n\nThe influential influential alt-metal act initially reunited for touring purposes in 2009, twelve years after issuing its previous studio set, \"Album Of The Year\", and followed that up with the aforementioned \"Sol Invictus\".\n\nIn a new interview with Chandler Sorrells of \"The Ring, The Cage, And The Stage\", Bottum, who is currently mixing a new album from his power-pop offshoot IMPERIAL TEEN, was asked if there was anything he could share about the current status of FAITH NO MORE.\n\n\"The last record was a real struggle to make,\" the keyboardist admitted (hear audio below). \"It felt really good and it was a really great exercise in taking us and our inner family creative process to the next level. It was a place that we kind of needed to go to make 'Sol Invictus'. We had spent a lot of time sort of coming back together and getting to know each other again and making music again and playing old songs, and then it kind of reached a point where it felt kind of dirty to just do what we were doing, just [playing] these shows of old songs. So we took it to the next level [by making an album] and that felt really good. I think we all walked away from that — even though it was like a really hard process to get through that record — I think we walked away from it with really positive and optimistic sort of perspectives.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I will periodically go to San Francisco and make music with those guys. What we do is a really special, unique thing that we kind of share — especially like me and Mike Bordin and Billy… We were super young — we were, like, 18 [or] 19 years old — when we started making music, so we kind of get in the room and we have a language that speaks really loud and really clear, at least to the three of us. I mean, where it goes is questionable, but we have sort of a language that's kind of undeniable in a really sort of family sense. And I think we all acknowledge that it's not something that any of us wanna turn our backs on, and it's kind of fun to do. So in the hopes of pushing things forward and making new music, we continue to do that, to get together and make new sounds and just have a dialogue about prospects and songs and where we go in the future.\"\n\nAsked if that means that he and his bandmates have been jamming and toying around with musical ideas but are unsure what will come of it, Roddy said: \"Yeah, that's fair to say. Yes. Absolutely.\"\n\nLast year, FAITH NO MORE singer Mike Patton told Full Metal Jackie's nationally syndicated radio show that the band was \"on an extended break.\" He added: \"And if something happens, it'll happen organically and naturally. But I kind of don't think it will. I kind of feel like we've tipped the scales a little bit. But we'll see. Who knows? I've learned my lesson not to say 'no.'\"\n\nPatton stressed that he didn't close the door on any future shows with FAITH NO MORE. \"It's one of those things. It's kind of like going to a family reunion, and you get along with your uncle, and then you're, like, 'Oh, we're gonna go to the next barbecue. Okay. Fine,'\" he said. \"I mean, that's really the way it is with us.\""
