        "text": "Saw Faith No More in '92 as a youngin' in a soviet-style stadium in Budapest, Hungary opening for GnR (who sucked). Big influence on me for sure, and the keyboards were a big part of that as I was into less popular industrial like ministry/nin/skinnypuppy etc and FtM was one of the few \"rock\" bands on the radio at the time that used those sounds.\n\nNot into Imperial Teen or any his other projects. I wish I had noticed he was gay at the time though, I could probably have used some kind of role-model back in the day to help deal with that stuff.\n\nFNM were a force of nature beyond the other acts of the day. They absolutely surpassed every other band of the time in every way, bar none.\n\nAnd they had a keyboard player - in a heavy band. I'll take 2 FNM notes over 1000 Dream Theater ones anytime.\n\nHeh... Just yesterday, I dug up an old FNM thread from the forum archives to find out what sort of gear Roddy was using\n\nAnyways, Angel Dust is one of my all-time favourite records, love the hammond in Be Aggressive!\n\n- CM\n\nWe used to cover \"From Out of Nowhere\" in my old band in the 90's. HUGE influence for me... not just his sounds but also his arrangements. He taught me how keyboards should add dynamics to the mix... not scream over top of it.\n\nGood to see threads like this. Remember though. Roddy was not totally responsible for all of their synth sounds. He was a total badass live though. Funny as hell when I saw them on Angel Dust's tour in like '92.... I think that Mike Patton played synth or piano an at least a few tracks of theirs. And I think their bass player had a hand or two in the production of it all. Needless to say though, they had a unique sound that is still influential in popular music today."
