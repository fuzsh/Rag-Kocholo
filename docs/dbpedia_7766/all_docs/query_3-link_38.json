        "text": "He’s no Elton John or Little Richard. But he is the mastermind of one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. Almost zero rock bands at the time had a dedicated keyboard player. His playing is proficient, but it’s his song writing and composition is where he really excels. His band has been together since 1981. They disbanded in 1998. In 2009 they reformed the band. That band’s name is Faith No More.\n\nMy favorite keyboardist is the criminally under appreciated Roddy Bottum\n\nBorn in 1963 Roddy grew up in the Hollywood hills and used to babysit the Arquette kids. In 1983 he and his friend from High School Bill Gould relocated to San Francisco to attend art school.\n\nThat same year Bill joined the band that was called Faith No Man at the time as their drummer. After the original keyboardist quit, Roddy was in."
