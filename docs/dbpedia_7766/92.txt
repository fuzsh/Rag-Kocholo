Roddy Bottum would be best known to most listeners as the keyboard player in the phenomenally successful hard rock outfit Faith No More. However as we’ll learn, Roddy is a musician with a prolific and diverse output, which includes the indie pop sensibilities of Imperial Teen, the dancey electronica of Crickets and the doomy metal of Nastie Band – all current projects. Add to this his current COVID isolation inspired collaboration with his Partner Joey Holman and his film score and opera work, it’s fair to say that Roddy is not only an excellent keyboard player, but a truly creative artist with plenty to share.
