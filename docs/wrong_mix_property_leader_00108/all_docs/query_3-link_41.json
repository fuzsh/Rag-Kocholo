        "text": "\"Koghb\" Foundation is organizing a conference dedicated to Armenian-British relations, within the framework of which the presentation of the Armenian edition of Oliver Baldwin's book \"Six prisons and two revolutions\" will take place.\n\nThe purpose of the conference is to reveal and present the real role of Great Britain in our region and, in particular, its influence on Armenia.\n\nWithin the framework of the conference, a number of scientists and researchers from Armenia and the UK will present their reports on this topic.\n\nYou can watch the reports on our channel.\n\nFor the third year in a row, \"Koghb\" Foundation is organizing a huge Vardavar celebration in Koghb village of Tavush marz.\n\nDuring these days, locals and visitors from all around Armenia and abroad can participate in a variety of educational, cultural, and entertainment events, as well as enjoy the genuine Vardavar celebration, recharge, and create bright emotions and memories.\n\n“KoghbxVardavar” project aims to revive Armenian national values, customs, and festivities while also promoting cultural interaction, economic activity, and frontier region development.\n\nThis year, on July 5, 6, and 7, join us at Koghb to celebrate Vardavar in the richest colors.\n\nThe Mansurian International Competition is a bright fusion of times, classics and modernism, a grey-haired wisdom and the craziest young breeze, and, of course, her majesty Music merged with Literature!\n\nThe mission of the Competition is to discover talented musicians from all over the world, revive the centuries-old Armenian literary heritage, popularize modern poetry, and praise the Armenian language and culture through the world's universal language - music.\n\nThe competition carries the name of Maestro Tigran Mansuryan, one of the greatest representatives of the contemporary Armenian composing school. Mansurian’s music reflects the heritage of the venerable musical tradition of Armenia, which dates back to more than a thousand years and ranges from the melodies of medieval ecclesiastical chant to specific scalar systems and musical forms.\n\nVisit www.mansuriancompetition.org to learn more about the competition.\n\nThe book publishing projects of “Koghb” Foundation aim to promote the publication and accessibility of valuable and up-to-date literature in Armenian, enabling the reader to discover new ideas, and viewpoints, encourage free thinking, and contribute to intellectual discourse and social advancement.\n\nThe following books were published within the publishing project of \"Koghb\" Foundation:\n\n“Six Prisons and Two Revolutions”, Oliver Baldwin (2022)\n\n\"Horizons. A Comprehensive Approach to Building a National Security System\", Hrachya Arzumanyan (2023)\n\n\"The Great Vasak Syuni\", Hamlet Davtyan (2023)\n\n\"The Unknown War of Vardanants. The Armenian Apostolic Church and the Course of our History\", Hamlet Davtyan (2024)\n\n\"The Mamikonyans. Myth and Reality\", Hamlet Davtyan (2024)\n\nIn 2016 “Koghb” Foundation together with the “Simonian” educational Foundation undertook the “TUMOxKoghb” project according to which TUMO center for creative technologies is being built in the frontier territory Koghb. The center, which is to serve the youth from Noyemberyan, Koghb, Berdavan, and more than 10 neighboring frontier communities, is designed for 1.000 students.\n\nAccording to the memorandum, the total budget of the project (including operational costs until 2025) is equal to about 3 million USA dollars.\n\nThis center, where the itinerant coaches from all 4 TUMO centers as well as invited coaches from abroad are to teach, will follow the basic educational program of the TUMO center.\n\nIn October of 2020 \"Koghb\" foundation will celebrate the 7th anniversary of its foundation and activity. To celebrate this event about 7.000 forest, forest fruit, and decorative trees were planted on 5 hectares field in Zikatar state reserve, Koghb Community, Tavush Marz.\n\nFund benefactors, supporters, nature lovers, and wide public members participated in the event. Starting from July the participants were able to book their future tree and choose its exact location on a schematic map on the foundation’s official web page and to plant their personal or family trees already on May 1.\n\nThe project will promote afforestation in the RA as well as will endow the completion of Tumo center construction in Koghb with the project income.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the Day of Protection of Children’s Rights, \"Koghb\" foundation launched a new educational project announcing an open competition aiming to create an entertaining educational videogame.\n\nAll creative individuals, teams, and companies are eligible to participate in the open competition by presenting the concept and script of proposed videogame till August 1 that would develop the following skills of children aged 10 and more:\n\n✅ thinking and understanding\n\n✅ decision making\n\n✅ creation and building\n\n✅ preserving nature.\n\nProject details are available here.\n\nIn November 2019, \"Koghb\" foundation, in cooperation with \"Boon\" foundation, launched a new project, \"Algorithm of Political Science \" talk series. The project aims to understand and (re) establish what we know, because only in that case we will be able to use it for the sake of progress and sustainable development. The speaker of the talk series is political scientist Manvel Sargsyan.\n\nIn November, 2019 \"Koghb\" foundation and \"Boon\" Scientific and Cultural Foundation launched a new series of lectures titled \"Anatomy of Sovereignty\". The speeches will touch upon various aspects of the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty will be viewed from philosophical, political, anthropological, economic, cultural and educational aspects. The main question is to what extent people and societies will be able to become or remain sovereign in the age of algorithms and data.\n\nIs it dangerous to think and act under total control? The problem is especially relevant in Armenia, where the idea of conspiracy theories woven around us is rooted, and everything happens within the framework of these theories. How to get out of this mess called \"trained helplessness\"? , a mindset when people do not believe that they and others can make a change.\n\nThe project coordinator is Serob Khachatryan.\n\nThe cooperation established by the Memorandum of Understanding signed between \"Koghb\" Foundation and \"Boon\" Scientific and Cultural Foundation in 2017 continued within the framework of the second series of lectures, \"What to do? How to do?\". The speech series aim to discuss the options to solve the problems that exist today through the practical application of values.\n\nThe revolution of values must be followed by the one of ideas, and consequently, the word about values must be followed by the word on specific area-centered ideas and proposals.\n\nThe project speaker is Arman Barseghyan.\n\nThe project of creating an agricultural incubator in Tavush province came to life as a result of the cooperation between “Koghb” foundation and “Refruit” LLC. The main goals of the project are:\n\n✅To form a stable demand for agricultural food of frontier communities of Tavush province,\n\n✅Through training and internships prepare young specialists equipped with corresponding knowledge and skills who in the future will be able to unite and create agricultural cooperatives or other establishments in their own.\n\n✅ To organize a united system for marketing and the consumption of these products.\n\n✅To finance the ongoing expenses (including the TUMO center construction in Koghb community) by the means accumulated in the result of agricultural incubator’s activity.\n\nIn the frames of cooperation with “Boon” foundation, we are happy to announce the results of one more project on “Boonus” educational platform. The outcome is an online video series of textbook “10th Grade Social Science” course (1st part: “Personal Finances”, 2nd part: “Business”).\n\nUp-to-date and superb educating videos are available not only for each and every Armenian student regardless of their region, but also for our compatriots living abroad.\n\nOn the initiative of Koghb Foundation and by Noyemberyan community's Council's decision Koghb Music School was named in honor of the great composer Tigran Mansuryan.\n\nMaestro Mansuryan's presence and touching words at the naming event made it even warmer and memorable.\n\nA concert with the participation of school students and teachers followed the naming ceremony that was filled with Mansuryan's spirit. Teachers and pupils of the music school already bearing the name of Tigran Mansuryan that was recently renovated, furnished, well-equipped with new musical instruments and will continue their work and education with greater responsibility.\n\nOn October 7, 2021, at the Meridian Expo Center, \"Koghb Foundation\" and \"Antares\" NGO organized the presentation of \"Incerto\" book series by a world-famous writer, mathematician, trader Nasim Taleb. The presentation consisted of three parts: musical and cultural, designed by maestro Tigran Mansuryan, speech of the organizers, presentation of books, display of Nasim Taleb's message, speech of translators, editors and jazz concert with the participation of Vahagn Hayrapetyan and trio.\n\nEach of the five partners of the event presented one of the books of the series and the symbolic gift to demonstrate them on the auction together with the signed books by Nassim Taleb, Tigran Masnuryan, Vahagn Khachatryan and Vahagn Hayrapetyan.\n\nThe five partners of the presentation were: Yerevan Brandy Company, \"Telecom Armenia\" company, \"Fora Premium\" company, \"Armenian Helicopters\" company, \"Armenia Marriott Yerevan\" hotel.\n\nAll the fund raised at the auction will be directed to the development of physical, mathematical and engineering education in the regions of Armenia.\n\nWe invited our volunteers from the Tavush region, who are always ready to support us, to Yerevan, in order to spend 3 days together from the summer holidays. After arriving in Yerevan and having a short rest, the children spent the rest of the day visiting the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies.\n\nOn the second day of the visit, in the morning, the children visited Matenadaran, then \"Antares\" printing house, where they got acquainted with the entire process of creating a book - from printing to organization. The children spent the evening at the Cafesjian Museum, admiring the Yerevan horizons from the Cascade, and before their Chinese-style dinner they watched already favorite cartoon \"Olympius\".\n\nOn the last day of the visit, our volunteers visited the house-museums of Hovhannes Tumanyan and Martiros Saryan, further enriching their stock of knowledge and impressions. Then the children visited Yerevan zoo, and before parting they received certificates of appreciation for the invaluable support of the Kohb Tree-planting project.\n\nThe presentation of Oliver Baldwin's book \"Six Prisons and Two Revolutions\" was held on the 3rd of November, 2022, at Tigran the Great hall of Mariott Armenia hotel.\n\nOliver Baldwin, the son of Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister of England, came to Armenia at the invitation of Alexander Khatissian in the fall of 1920 and served as a lieutenant colonel in the Armenian army, wrote the book \"Six Prisons and Two Revolutions\" about what he witnessed and what happened to him in Armenia.\n\n100 years since the first publication of the book, it is presented to the Armenian reader by Leonid Zilfugarian’s translation, Lernik Dallakyan’s edition and Hrant Ter-Abrahamian’s preface.\n\nAt the beginning of the presentation the RA Ambassador to the United Kingdom Varuzhan Nersesyan and the Ambassador of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the RA John Gallagher delivered their speeches.\n\nThen historian, publicist Hrant Ter-Abrahamyan briefly presented the book and his research paper titled “The framework of anti-British propaganda in Russian, Soviet, Soviet-Armenian historiography and post-Soviet Armenia”.\n\nThe presentation of Hamlet Davtyan’s book “The Great Vasak Syuni” was held on June17, 2023.\n\nThis work is unique in that it invites the reader to reflect on our past, present, and future, rather than simply reexamining the Armenian 5th century.\n\n\"We don't want to admit that we have misconceptions in terms of Vasak-Vardan, that we have delved more into finding the culprit through this contrast than trying to reach the truth itself, thus turning the search for the culprit into a national character.\"\n\nDuring the presentation, Arman Barseghyan, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the \"Koghb\" Foundation, gave a welcome speech before handing over the stage to the author, who presented the book and answered questions from the audience."
