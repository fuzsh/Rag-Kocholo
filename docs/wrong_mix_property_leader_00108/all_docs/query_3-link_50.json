        "text": "Vazgen Manukyan started his political activity during his student years. Until 1988, he was a member and organizer of various social and political organizations.\n\nIn 1967-1968 Vazgen Manukyan and his friends founded the Armenian Culture Club at the Moscow University, which, however, was not only cultural, but under the name of culture, mainly carried out activities towards protection of national identity. Later they established a similar organization at YSU as well, which had been raising up issues of independence, Armenia and Artsakh reunion, systems of political governance and etc.\n\nOn April 24, 1967, a group of like-minded people organized a demonstration in front of the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, working out the scenario in advance, visiting Moscow universities and dormitories, finding Armenians on the lists, and informing them about the demonstration.\n\nOn April 24, thousands of students gathered in front of the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, they were holding hands and singing “Zartir Lao,”. Militia dispersed the rally, but the demonstration had already taken place. This was the first successful demonstration after many unsuccessful attempts of the previous years. Armenian students returned to dormitories to celebrate their victory. A few days later, the organizers of the demonstration, including Vazgen Manukyan, were expelled from the university.\n\nWhile preparing for that demonstration, Vazgen Manukyan became acquainted with the head of the Department of Foreign Policy Planning of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Former Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Canada, Hamo Harutyunyan, who was a highly respected and influential figure in Moscow politics.\n\nIt can be said that he laid the foundation of Manukyan’s political activity. Their communication continued even after the rally in Moscow. Hamo Harutyunyan taught Manukyan and his friends the nuances of politics and diplomacy, from national politics to geopolitical processes. He talked about the structure of states and how the political decisions were made, and so on. Harutyunyan also introduced the youths to famous Armenians. “His house was a center for Armenians. For example, I met Silva Kaputikyan there. On numerous occasions, we met and became close to Marshal Baghramyan there. We got acquainted with the former First Secretary Yakov Zarobyan, in a word, the most influential people of that time,” Manukyan recalles.\n\nThe other great ideological influence on the young people had Karen Takhtajyan, mathematician, whose father, Armen Takhtajyan was a well-known academician in St. Petersburg. “It was under his influence that I first began to study Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Otto Weininger, Indian philosophy. And under the influence of Hamo Akimich, we stared to learn about the joint-stock companies, about the economy of the United States, that is, if we were an independent state, we would understand which way to go, and so on. All these boys later played a big role not only in founding various secret organizations in Armenia but also during the 1988 movement,” Vazgen Manukyan recalls.\n\nIn the 1970s, by the assignment of Vazgen I, Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Vazgen Manukyan and his friends carried out rescue operations of cultural property in the territories of Nakhichevan and Artsakh, organized the rescue of Armenian children under siege during Beirut Civil War, and many other undertakings.\n\nFeasts of the Translators\n\nIn 1974 Vazgen Manukyan and his supporters created an initiative called “Feasts of the Translators” (Armeniantransliterated: Tarkmanchats Toner), which united the entire Armenian intelligentsia.The goal was to create a national club that would allow people to get to know each other, to communicate, to discuss issues in an informal atmosphere, to gain the like-minded and supporters in discussing these issues, so that the most influential people in Armenia could be united around the same ideas.\n\nThe issues of Russian schools in Armenia, historical relations between Armenia and Russia, issues related to the Genocide, and sometimes even issues of freedom, independence, liberation from the communist regime were discussed.\n\n“When the movement of 88 started, we realized how important those round-ups were and how significant they were. The intelligentsia immediately united, because people already knew each other, approached the matters in the same way, shared the same ideas. That was the greatest achievement of the “Feasts of the Translators”.-Vazgen Manukyan\n\nOn September 11, 1992, Vazgen Manukyan was appointed Minister of State of the Republic of Armenia, and in October 1992, he was appointed the RA Minister of Defense, at the same time managing the RA military-industrial complex. During that period, the Armenian Armed Forces were finally formed, and after many defeats, a period of brilliant victories began.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Nagorno Karabakh was experiencing a tragedy: within a month, Azerbaijani troops occupied Shahumyan and Martakert, about 50 percent of the Armenian-controlled territory. It seemed that with one more effort, the Karabakh issue would finally come to an end. It was then that Vazgen Manukyan became the Minister of Defense of Armenia, and the course of the war gradually began to change.\n\nWith the active participation of Ter–Grigoryants, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces, a small but efficient army was formed. Since the fall of 1992, it was able to stop the advance of the Azerbaijanis, and starting spring of 1993, the Armenians counterattacked and in August defeated the main strike forces of the Azerbaijani army.\n\nOn May 28, 1993, the formation of the Armed Forces of Armenia, of which the Artsakh Defense Army was an integral part, was almost completed. Kelbajar was captured, Martakert was taken back, the backbone of the Azerbaijani army was broken, and the series of victories continued. There was a wave of great enthusiasm among the people, at that time the first military parade took place, which was hosted by the then Minister of Defense Vazgen Manukyan.\n\nThe Kapan Operation\n\nDuring the autumn and winter months of 1992, the situation on the country’s borders was dire. Shahumyan and Martakert were in the hands of the enemy, Kichan and therefore, Stepanakert and the whole of Artsakh were under constant threat. Walking through the Lachin corridor was extremely dangerous, sometimes impossible. The enemy also fired on the Armenian villages in the Kapan district with various weapons, endangering the Kapan-Goris highway.\n\nSince April 24, 1992, border clashes had turned into serious military operations. The city of Kapan and the border settlements were massively shelled.\n\nA decision was made to take measures to eliminate the most dangerous bases of the enemy. Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Lieutenant General Hrachya Andreasyan developed a plan, Yuri Khachaturov was appointed head of the operation.[47]\n\nThe operation started early in the morning of December 10. After several hours of fighting, the Armenian side managed to completely defeat the enemy and change the outcome of the war.[48]\n\nVazgen Manukyan did not inform the then President Levon Ter–Petrosyan about the Kapan operation, as the latter was against such actions, considering them unacceptable by the international community.\n\nThe Karvachar Operation\n\nThe operation to destroy the Azerbaijani military base in the Karvachar district, liberate the occupied territories, and crush the Lachin-Kelbajar group of the Azerbaijani army, took place from March 27 to April 2, 1993, during Vazgen Manukyan’s tenure and under his direct leadership.\n\nKarvachar was very important in its position. Martakert was being shelled from Karvachar, the enemy forces stationed in Karvachar were a great danger to the planes supplying Shahumyan partisan detachments. It was not possible to liberate Karvachar in one direction: it needed to be carried out in an attack in three directions simultaneously.\n\nLiberation of Martakert\n\nAfter becoming Minister of Defense, Vazgen Manukyan remained faithful to his oath. Immediately after the Karvachar operation, preparations for the liberation of Martakert began. In a very short time all forces and resources were united. Operations began in early summer 1993. Armenian forces were fighting on the whole northern front. On June 26, they managed to retake heights called “TV Tower” and “Pushken Yal”. When Defense Minister Vazgen Manukyan reports to President Ter-Petrosyan about the conquest of heights, the latter wonders what that means. Vazgen Manukyan explains that at night the intelligence will enter Martakert, and in the morning the army will enter the city, and tomorrow Martakert will be ours again. Everything went according to plan, on June 27 Martakert was liberated. The Armenian side defended the dominant heights, the main road directions.\n\nOn August 21, 1993, Vazgen Manukyan was relieved of his post as Minister of Defense, after having played a significant role in the victory of the Artsakh war during his one-year tenure.\n\nDuring the 1996 presidential election a serious opposition front was formed. The main political parties and forces unite, nominating Vazgen Manukyan as a candidate of national accord in the presidential elections.\n\nThe presidential election of September 22, 1996, resulted in widespread electoral fraud in favor of Levon Ter–Petrosyan. Even as a result of widespread electoral fraud, according to official data, Vazgen Manukyan received 41% of the vote, and Levon Ter-Petrosyan 51%.\n\nThe September 1996 presidential election was allegedly rigged to secure President Levon Ter-Petrosyan’s first-round victory so that he would not face Manukyan in the second round. The National Democratic Union has submitted an evidence base to the Constitutional Court in volumes.\n\n“Nevertheless, we did not announce that the opposition candidate had won, but demanded that each constituency open 3 ballot boxes at random, and if election fraud was found, we would go to the second round,” Vazgen Manukyan.\n\nOpposition rallies began. During the September 25 rally, Vazgen Manukyan announced, “Now it is being decided which way the state will go. If there is an illegitimate government, it will become a tradition and will continue in the same way.”\n\nVazgen Manukyan went to the Central Electoral Commission with several people, which was located in the building of the National Assembly Building at that time, suggesting to open 3 boxes from each region. At that time, Vazgen Manukyan announced, “If we do not come out in 20-30 minutes, come look for us.”\n\nThe people moved from Freedom Square along Baghramyan Avenue to the CEC chanting “Vazgen for President.” At around 6 pm, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the National Assembly in support of decisive action. Shortly afterward, Vova Hakhverdyan, one of Vazgen Manukyan’s supporters, came out of the National Assembly building. “I am personally saying Vazgen Manukyan’s words, ‘We will succeed, just be patient.’ It is his personal request to wait patiently, but the negotiations are taking place in a rather difficult atmosphere.”\n\nAfter some time, seeing that Vazgen Manukyan did not leave the building of the National Assembly, the people broke the iron gates of the National Assembly and entered the building. Clashes broke out.\n\nVazgen Manukyan tried to calm the protesters down, saying, “The commission is making a decision here, with which we are completely satisfied. People, the future of our entire nation depends on this moment.” He called on the people not to riot, not to raise their hands against the police.\n\nExcerpts from the US State Department report on the 1996 presidential election and its aftermath:\n\n“President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected as a result of controversial multi-candidate elections in September, which were marked by a number of illegalities and serious violations of the electoral law. The opposition rejected the official results of the elections and appealed to the Constitutional Court, asking to annul the decision of the Central Electoral Commission and call new elections. The court examination did not dispel doubts about the reliability of the official results…” [64][66]\n\n“…During the events following the September elections, the government beat and abused members of opposition parties and protesters. The government signed an agreement with the Red Cross authorizing meetings and private talks with the detainees, but not enough steps were taken to implement the agreement…”\n\n“…The government continued to impose certain restrictions on the freedom of the press, security forces beat and arrested journalists after the September events, and journalists were prone to some self-censorship.”\n\n“…In the aftermath of the presidential election, when the ban on rallies was still in effect, security forces and officers in civilian clothing beat passers-by who were found near the main rally site. Two cases of police brutality were registered in the first half of the year. In each case, the prisoner who was severely beaten then committed suicide. Both cases are currently pending in the Supreme Court\n\nFrom 2009 to 2019: On November 13, Vazgen Manukyan chaired the RA Public Council. The purpose of the Public Council is to promote the establishment and development of civil society in the country, to create an atmosphere of tolerance, to develop a constructive dialogue between the government and various segments of society.\n\nProminent scholars, public, cultural, former state figures, and intellectuals were involved in the council, who, by uniting and cooperating in the council, developed a common vision for the future of Armenia and the Armenian people and formulated issues that were also presented to the authorities of the day.\n\nDuring the years headed by Vazgen Manukyan, the council was active, responding to all those issues concerning Armenia and the Armenian people that received a public voice and touched society. Numerous issues were raised, discussed and proposals on them were submitted to the RA President or the RA Government on the initiative of the members of the Public Council or committees. Some of these issues were immediately resolved, some were included in the guidelines and programs of the Government of the Republic of Armenia.\n\nThe RA Public Council became a member of the International Organization of Public Councils on July 7, 2010, at the General Assembly of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions (AICESIS) in New York.\n\nWithin the framework of international cooperation, the RA Public Council has signed bilateral cooperation agreements with a number of countries of the Association (Russia, China, Brazil, Greece, Portugal).\n\nWithin the framework of the International Association, the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Francophone Institutions (UCESIF) was established, which the RA Public Council has also been a member of since 2015.\n\nThe Council has worked closely with the RA President, the Prime Minister, and the heads of state agencies. The Public Council commissions actively cooperated with the representatives of the relevant state structures with the aim of bringing the culture of public dialogue and public discussions to a new level of development."
