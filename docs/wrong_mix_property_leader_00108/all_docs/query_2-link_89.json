This is very important not only regarding preserving the name of Charles Aznavour as a person and an artist but also in terms of sharing his important values. On the part of the foundation, we will spare no effort to make the college worthy of its name. We will invite celebrities who will inspire the youth, and perhaps one day the future generation will give talented young people who will make us feel proud and hold the name of Armenia in high esteem.”\n\nIt should be noted that the objective of signing the Memorandum is to expand the opportunities of young people receiving secondary vocational education in the field of culture and promote their further professional activities.
