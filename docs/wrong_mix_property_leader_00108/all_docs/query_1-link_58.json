He was a qualified sports trainer and taught physical education until 1983, when he started his political career.\n\nIn 1985 he became a member of the Writers’ Union of Armenia, and worked as chief of the department of journalism of Garun magazine.\n\nIn 1990-92, Sparapet was the commander of the Yerkrapah group, gaining a reputation as a military leader. It was this reputation that helped him rise to the office of Defense Minister of Armenia in 1991 and country’s Prime Minister in 1999.\n\nNearly five months later he was shot dead during an armed attack on Armenian parliament on October 27, 1999.\n\nSparapet Vazgen Sargsyan was posthumously awarded the title of Armenia’s National Hero."
