Currently, Armenia is a member of the following structures operating under UNESCO.\n\nThe Regional Centre for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in South-Eastern Europe, Sofia,\n\nRegional Research Centre for Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in West and Central Asia, Tehran,\n\nRegional Centre on Urban Water Management, Tehran,\n\nThe International Research Centre in Artificial Intelligence, Ljubljana,\n\nThe International Competence Centre for Mining Engineering Education, St. Petersburg.\n\nSeveral intergovernmental commissions operate alongside the Conventions.\n\nApplications included in lists established by UNESCO conventions\n\nCultural heritage/sites included in the UNESCO World Heritage List belong to all people of the world, regardless of their location. This list includes monuments and memorials of the greatest value to humanity. Each state can apply only for the cultural heritage/site that is within its borders.\n\nArmenia is represented in the list with the following applications:\n\n\"Haghpat and Sanahin Monasteries\" (1996, 2000),\n\n\"Echmiadzin Cathedral and churches (St. Hripsime, St. Gayane, St. Shoghakat) and the ancient site of the Zvartnots Cathedral\" (2000),\n\n\"Geghard Monastery and the upper valley of Azat River\" (2000).\n\nIn 2018 the site “Geghard Monastery and Upper Azat River Valley” was granted enhanced protection status, which has become the first monument in Armenia as such. “Enhanced protection of UNESCO” is a mechanism established by the 1999 Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The mechanism requires the parties to the conflict to refrain from attacking such a monument, as well as from any military use of it or its immediate surroundings. The Protocol also establishes criminal penalties for violations of enhanced protection of cultural property by persons.\n\nApplications in waiting/preliminary list:\n\n\"The basilica and archaeological site of Yererouk\" (1995),\n\n\" The archaeological site of the city of Dvin\" (1995),\n\n\" The monasteries of Tatev and Tatevi Anapat and the adjacent areas of the Vorotan Valley\" (1995),\n\n\" The monastery of Noravank and the upper Amaghou Valley\" (1995).\n\nThe Armenian Monastic Ensembles - St Thaddeus and St Stepanos and the Chapel of Dzordzor. of St. Stepanos, St. Thaddeus the Apostle and Dzor Dzor in Iran were registered in the World Heritage List based on the application submitted by the Islamic Republic of Iran under the name \"Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran\".\n\nIn 2016, the ruins of Ani, the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Bagratides, located in the current territory of Turkey were registered in the list under the name \"Archaeological site of Ani\".\n\nSeveral lists are defined by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003). In the Convention, intangible cultural heritage is characterized as a set of traditions, customs and cultural expressions, as well as knowledge and skills, which are recognized by certain groups of people, and in some cases also by individuals, as part of their cultural heritage. An entity's decision to list an item does not imply ownership.\n\nIn the representative list of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, Armenia is represented by the following elements:\n\n\"Duduk and it music\" (2008),\n\n\"Armenian cross-stones art. Symbolism and craftsmanship of Khachkars\" (2010),\n\n\"Performance of the Armenian epic of “Daredevils of Sassoun” or “David of Sassoun\" (2012),\n\n\"Lavash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia \" (2014),\n\n\"Kochari, traditional group dance\" (2017),\n\n\"Armenian letter art and its cultural expressions\" (2019)\n\n\"Pilgrimage to the St. Thaddeus Apostle Monastery\" (2020), joint application with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nUNESCO Programs\n\nMany programs are implemented within the framework of UNESCO, which are financed from both the regular budget and extrabudgetary sources.\n\nUNESCO's Memory of the World Program reflects the diversity of languages, cultures and peoples. The goal of the progamme is to prevent the loss of valuable records of archives and libraries around the world without a trace and to promote their wide distribution.\n\nThree samples of Armenian documentary heritage appear in the register:\n\n“Mashtots Matenadaran ancient manuscripts collection” (1997թ.),\n\n“The First Study of Byurakan and Astronomer Benjamin Margarian’s Observations of Galaxies”, (2011)\n\n“Collection of note manuscripts and film music of Composer Aram Khachaturian” (2013թ.):\n\nThe UNESCO Associated Schools Network program was established in 1953. More than 10,000 educational institutions from 181 countries are involved in the program list. The Network has been operating in Armenia since March, 1997. Currently, it includes 10 Armenian schools. The latter cooperates with UNESCO within the framework of national programmes, supporting the spread of the Organization's values, the realization of goals and issues.\n\nThe UNESCO UNITWIN/ Chair Programme (university twinning and communication, establishment of contacts) was established in 1992. It serves to improve the capacities of higher education and research institutions, promoting the exchange of knowledge and joint activities. Currently, the international UNESCO/UNITWIN network of research and postgraduate education in the field of biophysics, biotechnology and environmental safety operates in Armenia, as well as the following UNESCO chairs:\n\nUNESCO Chair of Life Sciences (NAS)\n\nUNESCO Chair of Sustainable Development (NAS)\n\nUNESCO Chair of Human Rights and Democracy (YSLU)\n\nUNESCO Chair for Education and Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities (YSU)\n\nUNESCO Calendar of Anniversaries of Famous People and Important Events\n\nSince 1998, 27 anniversaries presented by Armenia have been included in the Calendar. It includes the following anniversaries for the 2022-2023 biennium.\n\n100th anniversary of Nerses Shnorhali\n\nThe 100th anniversary of the foundation of the State Cinema of Armenia\n\nThe issue of the destruction of the Armenian cemetery of Old Jugha in Nakhichevan\n\nAs of December, 2005, the armed forces of Azerbaijan have completely destroyed thousands of unique cross-stones and tombstones of the Armenian cemetery in Old Jugha, thereby completing the state policy of complete annihilation of the Armenian-Christian cultural heritage of Nakhichevan and the entire territory of Azerbaijan in the last two decades.\n\nDuring this vandalistic operation, the medieval cross-stones and tombstones of the Jugha cemetery were turned into rubble and thrown into the Araks river. A shooting range was built on the territory of the cemetery.\n\nDespite the many irrefutable photo and video testimonies and proofs, until now no international organization, including UNESCO, has given an adequate assessment of these vandalistic actions organized and carried out by Azerbaijan at the state level.\n\nIn 1998, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia appealed to the international organizations in charge of the preservation of culture and cultural heritage, alerting them about the destruction of Jugha's cross-stones and tombstones. In particular, letters were sent to the Director-General of UNESCO in 1998, 2002 and 2005, presenting the situation and calling for measures to be taken to cease the cultural genocide against the Armenian monuments of Nakhichevan. 2005 the Armenian side also took the initiative to organize a fact-finding mission, which, according to UNESCO's explanations, did not take place due to security conditions.\n\nDuring the 16th session of the General Assembly of the International Council on Monuments and Sites held in Quebec from September 30 to October 4, the General Assembly - UNESCO's advisory body, adopted a resolution. The provision 5 of the resolution:\n\nDraws the attention of the Azerbaijani authorities, as a State Party to the Convention on the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, to the destruction of the Jugha cemetery and to transmit to them the concern of the international community of conservation experts,\n\nAsks the Azerbaijani authorities to facilitate the access of an expert delegation from UNESCO and/or ICOMOS in order to study the site and inform the international community of the results.\n\nStatements on the issue of Jugha cross-stones have been made in various international platforms and meetings.\n\nThe issue of UNESCO fact-finding mission for the protection of Artsakh's cultural heritage\n\nSince the 44-day war and Trilateral Declaration of November 9, 2020, Armenia has consistently raised the question of deploying a UNESCO fact-finding mission to Artsakh and adjacent regions for the protection of Artsakh's cultural heritage. Armenia has always supported the initiative of the UNESCO Director-General on sending an expert mission and was in favor of implementing it as soon as possible.\n\nThe Armenian side accepted all the preconditions proposed by the UNESCO Secretariat, that the mission should be carried out:\n\nIn line with the 1954 Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.\n\nExperts can have unhindered access to cultural assets in these areas\n\nAn equal number of Armenian and Azerbaijani monuments should be visited during the mission.\n\nArmenia does not reject the possibility of experts visiting the monuments proposed by Azerbaijan during the mission. Azerbaijan, however, obstructs the visit of experts to the Armenian monuments under its control, in order to prevent the recording of the facts of Armenian historical presence in these territories, as well as atrocities and appropriation by Azerbaijan towards Armenian cultural values during this period.\n\nAzerbaijan bears the responsibility for not implementing the UNESCO fact-finding mission.\n\nUpdated 06.03.2023"
