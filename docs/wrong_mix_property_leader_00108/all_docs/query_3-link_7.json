        "text": "Armenia-NATO partnership relations date back to 1992 when Armenia joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, later renamed the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (Armenia has been a member of EAPC since 1997). Armenia's cooperation with NATO has gradually broadened since Armenia joined the Partnership for Peace in 1994.\n\nStarting from 2006 the political dialogue and partnership cooperation in various fields have been developing between Armenia and NATO in the framework of the Individual Partnership Action Plan (Armenia presented its first IPAP to NATO in June 2005 and started the first cycle of implementation in January 2006). Partnership tools such as the PfP Planning and Review Process (Armenia joined PfP PARP in 2002) and Individual Partnership Action Plan are aimed at supporting Armenia in the security and defense sector reforms and enhancing the military interoperability and capabilities of its peacekeeping forces for participation in multinational peace operations under the UN mandate. The implementation of IPAP is also aimed at enhancing and strengthening democratic control and civilian oversight of its armed forces, improving and strengthening Armenia’s disaster relief and crisis management, as well as emergency preparedness; and raising public awareness of its partnership cooperation with NATO. Armenia and NATO also cooperate in the framework of the Science for Peace and Security program.\n\nArmenia implemented its fifth Individual Partnership Action Plan for 2017 – 2019, and as of 2022, the prolonged fifth IPAP continues to remain in force. Since 2004 Armenian peacekeeping units participate in peace operations contributing peacekeeping troops to KFOR Mission in Kosovo, as well as to Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan (until 2021). Armenia's engagement in peace operations enabled the country to become from a security consumer into a security contributor.\n\nIn 2004 Armenia established a diplomatic mission to NATO, based in Brussels, and currently, Ambassador Arman Israyelyan is the Head of the Armenian Mission to NATO.\n\nDefense and security sphere\n\nArmenia’s partnership cooperation with NATO is aimed at facilitating the ongoing reforms in defense and security sectors in the framework of IPAP as well as strengthening the interoperability capabilities with Armenia’s partners. One of the key objectives of Armenia-NATO cooperation in these sectors is to strengthen and enhance democratic control and civilian oversight of the Armed Forces of Armenia.\n\nSince 2002 Armenia has participated in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP).\n\nIn 2004 Armenian peacekeeping forces joined the NATO-led peace operation in Kosovo and in 2010 started to contribute to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Mission in Afghanistan which was completed in December 2014. In January 2015 Armenia started to contribute to the new Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. In August-September, 2021, due to the end of NATO's \"Resolute Support\" mission in Afghanistan, the RA peacekeeping contingent returned to Armenia.\n\nCivil emergency planning and Emergency Preparedness\n\nArmenia cooperates with NATO in the areas of crisis management and civil protection to enhance Armenia’s emergency preparedness and disaster relief capabilities to effectively deal with natural disasters and various (asymmetric) threats. To this end through close collaboration with NATO’s Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) Armenia intends to further develop and strengthen its own crisis management and civil protection capabilities.\n\nOn September 11-16, 2010 in cooperation with NATO’s Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre, Armenia hosted the EADRCC's “Armenia 2010” civil emergency exercise near Yerevan, which is one of NATO's biggest events in the disaster response area.\n\nArmenian rescue teams are actively engaged in the activities of EADRCC and have contributed in the civil emergency exercises and events organized by EADRCC, including emergency exercises “Kodri 2011” in Moldova; “Georgia 2012” in Georgia; “Ukraine 2015” in Ukraine, “Crna Gora 2016” in Montenegro, “Bosnia & Herzegovina 2017”, “North Macedonia 2021”. Armenia and NATO also cooperate in the framework of NATO’s Science for Peace and Security program, particularly in the environmental area.\n\nPublic diplomacy\n\nArmenia regularly raises public awareness of Armenia-NATO partnership relations through public diplomacy events. The annual \"NATO Week\" events are serving this purpose.\n\nDecember 13-18, 2018 – within the framework of the Armenia-NATO Individual Partnership Action Plan, the 11th “NATO week” events took place in Yerevan, during which the traditional TV bridge with the Armenian peacekeepers in the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan was established.\n\nMarch 11-15, 2019 - the 12th “NATO week” event took place in Yerevan. Public events – conferences, round tables, and panel discussions with active participation of governmental bodies, civil societies, academia, NATO international staff, and media, took place in the National Assembly of Armenia, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in the Ministry of Defense of Armenia, French and Vanadzor universities.\n\nThe NATO Information Centre in Yerevan, officially launched on March 12, 2007, with the support of the Armenian government and NATO, plays an important role in raising public awareness of Armenia-NATO partnership cooperation. It also plays a key role in public events during the “NATO weeks”.\n\nThe Armenian Parliamentarians are also engaged in Armenia-NATO cooperation. The National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia actively participates in events organized under the auspices of NATO. Moreover, the RA National Assembly delegation regularly participates in NATO Parliamentary Assembly sessions, as well as Rose-Roth seminars.\n\n2024\n\nJanuary 18-19, Javier Colomina Piriz, the special representative of the NATO Secretary General in the Caucasus and Central Asia, visited Armenia.\n\n2023\n\nOn October 24, a meeting was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs between the NATO international staff delegation and the representatives of state agencies of RA for the purpose of discussing and agreeing on the Armenia-NATO ITPP document.\n\nOctober 6-8, the delegation of the National Assembly of RA participated in the annual session of the NATO PA held in Copenhagen.\n\nOn May 23, the NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for the Caucasus and Central Asia Javier Colomina visited Armenia.\n\nMay 19-21, the National Assembly delegation of Armenia participated in the spring session of the NATO PA in Luxembourg.\n\nMay 15 Secretary of the Security Council of the RA Armen Grigoryan participated in the meeting of the Committee of Deputy Permanent Representatives+Armenia (DPRC+Armenia) at the NATO headquarters.\n\nApril 11, Defense Minister Suren Papikyan visited NATO structures, particularly the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE).\n\nJanuary 23, Foreign Minister of the RA Ararat Mirzoyan met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at NATO HQ in Brussels within the framework of his visit to the EU.\n\nJanuary 18, Javier Colomina, NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for the Caucasus and Central Asia, visited Armenia.\n\n2022\n\nOn October 11, Alexander Vinnikov, head of the NATO Liaison Office in Georgia, visited Armenia.\n\nOn October 4, the meeting of the Deputy Permanent Representatives Committee (DPRC) of the Alliance member countries took place at the NATO headquarters with the participation of the Secretary of the Security Council of the RA Armen Grigoryan.
