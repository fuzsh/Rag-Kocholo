Here you can find information regarding the activities of our Office, the mission and direction of the Armenian-Diaspora partnership, as well as the programs, activities, and events being implemented in Armenia and in the Diaspora. We have strived to provide a platform that is accessible, efficient, and useful. If you have any questions or inquiries please contact us using the contact form at the bottom of the page, or the chat button to your right.\n\nFor centuries the Armenian nation has been a unique bridge between the east and the west. Due to the loss of Armenian statehood and numerous foreign invasions, Armenian communities have formed in neighboring countries and regions since the Middle Ages. As a result of the Armenian Genocide, hundreds of thousands of survivors found refuge in various parts of the world, forming what is known today as the \"traditional Armenian Diaspora.\" The Diaspora further expanded due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the ensuing economic and regional turmoil."
