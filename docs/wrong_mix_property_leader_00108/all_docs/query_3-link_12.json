        "text": "President of the Republic Vahagn Khachaturyan attended the event dedicated to the 65th anniversary of Vazgen Sargsyan.\n\nDuring the event, the President made a speech:\n\n\"Today we celebrate the 65th anniversary of the National hero of Armenia, Sparapet Vazgen Sargsyan.\n\nVazgen Sargsyan phenomenon is caused by the formation of newly independent Armenia. The first years of independence of the Republic of Armenia were, first of all, the period of formation of the state, which was full of turbulent and complex events, required non-standard, quick decisions and, of course, management of the current situation.\n\nThe possibility of turning the country into chaos was high, especially during the years of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the war. Uncertainty, lack of experience in building a new social system made it even more difficult to solve problems.\n\nAll this became possible to overcome and make the existence of an independent, sovereign state, the Republic of Armenia, a reality, thanks to the struggle, combat capability, incredible courage, victims, who will never ever be forgotten and hardships of our people, the citizens of the Republic of Armenia. Of course, it would have been impossible to achieve success without skillful leadership.\n\nVazgen Sargsyan was one of those who, starting his state-building path with the protection of his home, later became one of the founders of the Republic of Armenia.\n\nJust 11 years of active social, military and political activities immortalized him. Vazgen, like many of his contemporaries, could not remain indifferent to the events of the Karabakh movement years. Vazgen Sargsyan, who loved his homeland endlessly, had no shortage of courage and bravery, was at the forefront of the movement, working with all his potential and dedication to the defense of the homeland. And it was no coincidence that he himself became the first Minister of Defense of the Republic of Armenia. That is also the reason why he is immortalized in people's memories as Sparapet nowadays. Vazgen Sargsyan's great role in the field of statehood strengthening and development of the country is undeniable.\n\nWith great readiness and enthusiasm, characteristic to him, he continued organizing the work of the spheres entrusted to him, both as the Minister of State and as the Minister of Defense, even in peaceful conditions. The complexity of the problems required a special approach, persistence, will and patience. At that time, and especially when he became the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia, Vazgen began to be accepted differently by society.\n\nHe once admitted that our society, many people do not know him well. In fact, if there was such a problem, it was related to the initial period of Vazgen's activity. Later, people became convinced that Vazgen was really unique, a determined and strong-willed individual with his feelings, a man who loved his homeland immensely.\n\nPatriotism in his case was not a word or an abstract phenomenon, but hard work and struggle, faith in the justice of his cause, the desire for independence and freedom.\n\nThe love for the motherland later became an obligation and duty to build a State. Motherland without a State is an abstract concept. This understanding forced Vazgen and his supporters to strengthen the foundations of the state, the state institutions, with daily work.\n\nAfter becoming Prime Minister, Vazgen was completely transformed: a new life began for him, and this was due to his temperament. Only a person with a great sense of responsibility can be like that. He had big plans, ideas, he was in a hurry.\n\nUnfortunately, everything turned out differently, Vazgen was not fortunate enough to see Armenia of the 21st century, which he imagined.\n\nRemember what he wrote:\n\n\"... We are afraid of our power. We have been trained to other’s power. We are perfectly submissive, we are clever performers, we are inventions in other’s hands. You, Armenian, now you are that “other”. Your “other” is you. And it's nothing that from the beginning, because of the old custom, fear, mistrust, I don't know what else, you look for an enemy in yourself, find and rejoice that there is someone to blame. It's nothing, but let it pass quickly. Don't believe it. You have a path, you have a home, you have a son. Do not believe that your enemy is stronger than you.\"\n\nYes, we have a path to follow, and following that path is Vazgen Sargsyan’s message as well.\n\nI am confident that Vazgen had to go through that path while building the sovereignty of the Republic of Armenia, which he fell victim to. Today, all of us who believe in our bright and better future realize that it is impossible without a sovereign, powerful, defended, developed Republic of Armenia.\n\nToday, celebrating the 65th anniversary of Vazgen Sargsyan, we can list for a very long time the most important achievements of his life and work in the formation of our state and the armed forces, increasing the combat capability of the army, creating the “Homeland Defenders Voluntary Union” and in many other fields, but, first of all, we must emphasize that Vazgen Sargsyan was a devoted fighter for independence.\n\nAnd, as he himself said in one of his last interviews, independence is an absolute value, our duty, obligation, our main goal and task and, finally, the best way to keep Vazgen Sargsyan’s memory alive, is to preserve and defend our independence, our complete dedication to strengthening the army and the state."
