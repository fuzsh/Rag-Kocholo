        "text": "Supporting the Artsakh State University in the enhancement of its learning environment\n\nPeriod : 2022 to 2022\n\nDue to the financial support from AGBU, HAAF and the Government of Artsakh, the Artsakh State University (ASU) facilities were rehabilitated in 2021. However, the University lacked funds for furnishing the rehabilitated facilities to enable its full-fledged operation. Recognizing the role and impact of the Artsakh State University (ASU) in supporting the preservation of national identity in Artsakh as well as the paramount importance of facilitating access to education in conflict affected areas, the Izmirlian Foundation, in cooperation with the Government of Artsakh, supported the furnishing of the ASU facilities. The initiative was particularly important in the light of the Artsakh War in 2020. The Project goal was to foster an enabling environment for learning and social cohesion. The Project direct beneficiaries were students, professors, researchers at ASU as well as students from other universities/academic institutions. The Project implementation partner was the Artsakh State University.\n\nFurnishing of Three Schools in Artsakh\n\nPeriod : 2022 to 2022\n\nScaling up its support to education in conflict affected areas, the Izmirlian Foundation supported the furnishing of the facilities of the three newly rehabilitated schools in Chldran, Ivanyan and Stepanakert settlements in Artsakh. From 2020-2022, the Izmirlian Foundation supported the capital renovation of “Dikran Izmirlian” secondary school in Chldran and the expansion of its premises aiming to improve the community school infrastructure creating a safe, healthy and attractive environment for schoolers and teachers. Ivanyan secondary school located in Askeran region of Artsakh was established in 1993 and the school was fully rehabilitated during 2020-2022 with financial support from “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund. Shirakatsy Lyceum was established in 2022 in Stepanakert city of Artsakh. The goal of the Project was to enhance the quality of teaching and learning environment in conflict affected areas by furnishing the newly rehabilitated school facilities. Generally, school infrastructure is decisive for students to achieve the expected academic results. A good school infrastructure, with renewed spaces, makes it possible for schoolers to study and, in addition, tends to improve the attendance and interest of students and teachers in learning. For this same reason, investments in school infrastructure have an essential role in solving access problems of students to the school system and to improve their performance. The Project direct beneficiaries were 326 schoolers and 116 schoolteachers/staff of Dikran Izmirlian, Ivanyan secondary schools and Shirakatsy Lyceum.\n\nFood for Extremely Poor in view of COVID 19\n\nPeriod : 2020 to 2021\n\nThe Izmirlian Foundation supported the project on \"Food for Extremely Poor in view of COVID 19\" in cooperation with Social Services of Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin with the goal of supporting the food security for vulnerable people/families throughout Armenia and Artsakh by ensuring the vulnerable population's access to nutritious food. Donation Agreement was signed between the Izmirlian Foundation and the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin on 22 May, 2020.

Due to the outbreak of COVID 19, Camp TUMO 2020 was organised in an online mode. The program targeted teens living in the border villages of Armenia. They were involved in online TUMO workshops together with Yerevan based TUMO students and spent 3-4 weeks learning ins and outs in 10 different subjects. The classes were organised to allow campers interact with other students and share their experience afterwards. The goal of the project was to provide greater opportunities for teenagers from remote areas of Armenia to gain knowledge, skills, and hands-on experiences in technology and design and connect with other TUMO students via online workshops. 25 teenagers from remote and bordering communities of Armenia directly benefited from the project. The main outcome of the project was: Enhanced knowledge and capacities in technology and design as well as increased network of peers. In 2019 The Izmirlian Foundation financed the implementation of Camp Tumo 2019 program within the framework of which 20 young people between the ages of 10 and 18 from nine Armenia’s northeast (Tavush province) border rural communities attended Camp Tumo in Yerevan for one week. Within the framework of the project, the beneficiaries received trainings in robotics, photography, 3D modelling, animation and graphic design. Besides actively participating in training programs, the campers did sightseeing activities in Yerevan and in various regions of Armenia.\n\nImproving the Quality of Education in Rural Areas of Armenia\n\nPeriod : 2020 to 2021\n\nPartnership Agreement was signed on May 8, 2019, between the Izmirlian Foundation, Teach for Armenia Educational Foundation and ‘Gradarak’ Educational and Cultural NGO. The project parties had a common goal to contribute to improving the quality of education in rural areas of Armenia. The Izmirlian Foundation continued supporting educational projects in Armenia by donating USD 25K for the implementation of the project on ‘Improving the quality of education and the learning environment in the secondary schools of border communities of Tavush region’. Within the framework of the project ‘Gradarak’ Educational and Cultural NGO renovated the library on the premises of the public school in Choratan village of Tavush region, transforming the library into a child-friendly multifunctional room. Teach For Armenia Educational Foundation ensured the placement of one Fellow to work as a public-school teacher for the 2019-2021 academic years and to boost the community life in Choratan village of Tavush region in the scope of its two-year Leadership Development Program and the trilateral partnership with the Parties.\n\nSupporting Musical School after A. Spendiaryan\n\nPeriod : 2020 to 2020\n\nThe Izmirlian Foundation continued supporting the musical school named after Alexander Spendiaryan by equipping the school with necessary musical instruments to enhance the educational processes and enable the participation of Armenian talented students in national and international competitions. Within the framework of the project the school inventory was replenished with a semi-concert grand piano, thus enabling access to musical instruments for 400 piano students at Alexander Spendiaryan Music School. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, the school has been proactive in participating in various national and Interntional online competitions. Particularly, 28 students have participated in various national and international online competitions since April 2020. The project was implemented by “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund.\n\nHand in Hand\n\nPeriod : 2020 to 2021\n\nThe Izmirlian Foundation in line with the government priorities to empower socially vulnerable groups of society and promote the reduction of the use of plastic containers, supported “Hand in Hand” project within the framework of which a social entrepreneurship was established where youth with autism spectrum disorder got involved in production of environmentally friendly products. The goal of the project was to empower socially vulnerable groups of society and social enterprises as well as to promote environmentally friendly production. Due to the Project 19 youth with autism spectrum disorder are employed by the social enterprise of Step Forward Social NGO and have a sustainable source of income. The young employees report that employment has served as a source of empowerment for them. Moreover, the parents report about significant positive changes in their teens’ behavior. The Project has resulted in increase in the hours spent in working environment (4-6 hours per day) for autistic youth contributing to their social inclusion, considering also that they interact with the clients (both face-to-face and by phone) and are also involved in the product delivery processes. As a result, the parents have gained additional time to spend on other productive activities. These translate into either opportunity cost of labour, increased production, improved education levels or more leisure time. The outreach of training activities comprised 26 beneficiaries reporting about having new skills and knowledge in production practices and technologies. Due to the project the sustainability of Step Forward NGO was enhanced, since the income generated by the social enterprise feeds into the projects implemented by the NGO. This ensures the sustainability of the social projects implemented by the NGO extending services to children/youth with autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, it ensures full time employment opportunities and sustainable source of income for the employees of Step Forward Social NGO. The project was implemented by Step Forward Social NGO.\n\nMedical Support to internally displaced Armenians of Artsakh\n\nPeriod : 2020 to 2022\n\nAs a midterm assistance to internally displaced persons from Artsakh, the Izmirlian Foundation launched the project on “Medical Support to internally displaced Armenians of Artsakh” aiming to provide health care assistance to internally displaced persons from Artsakh as a result of the Artsakh-Azerbaijan war in 2020. The goal of the project was to achieve improved health among Armenians of Artsakh by enabling their access to quality medical services. Within the framework of the project a cooperation partnership was established with the Armenia office of International Organization for Migration that ensured the pre-screening of Artsakh Armenians residing in temporary shelters, through mobile clinics, and their referral to IMC for further in-depth diagnostic and curative interventions. Due to the partnership the project outreach was significantly increased. The Project benefited 182 Artsakh-Armenians that received different services at IMC and 9,985 beneficiaries that received screening services through mobile clinics. The project was implemented by the Izmirlian Medical Centre.\n\nFostering Lab Capacity of the Hematology Center after Prof. R.H. Yeolyan\n\nPeriod : 2022 to 2022\n\nThe Izmirlian Foundation in cooperation with the Hematology Center initiated the project on “Fostering Lab Capacity of the Hematology Center after Prof. R.H. Yeolyan”. The goal of the project was to improve access to quality diagnostic services through the enhancement of laboratory technical capacity thus enabling the accurate and timely detection of pathogens as well as diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes among patients of the Hematology Center. Due to the project the diagnostic services related to the following conditions were fostered: Fungal complications during the chemotherapy treatment of patients with leukemia, solid tumors and bone marrow transplantation (Pneumocystis, Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis); Gastrointestinal and blood stream infections that require quick detection of pathogenic bacteria. Due to the Program microbiological tests are performed more efficiently and in a shorter period of time, which is critically important for immunocompromised patients. In addition, patients with suspected myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can now get an accurate diagnosis due to the availability of sideroblastic stains which are used to determine some types of MDS. MDS is a condition that can transform to leukemia and lead to an early death. Determining the type of MDS helps doctors in prescribing the necessary life-saving or life-prolonging treatment. A total of 7 pieces of laboratory equipment and devices necessary for timely and efficient pathogen identification were delivered and installed in the Hematology Center. The Project direct beneficiaries are immunocompromised patients with haematological and oncological malignancies and patient with MDS who are receiving care in the Hematology Center after Prof. R.H. Yeolyan. The Project was implemented by the Hematology Center after Prof. R.H. Yeolyan."
