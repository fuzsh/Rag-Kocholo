For the same reason, Armenian fans will be barred from the second Euro 2024 qualifier between the two teams, which will be played in Turkey in September.\n\nAn FFA spokesperson said UEFA imposed the bans at its own initiative. Neither the Armenian nor the Turkish football federation had requested such a measure.\n\nArmenia and Turkey played each other for the first time in Yerevan in 2008. That match was attended by then-Turkish President Abdullah Gul and a few Turkish fans.\n\nGul’s trip to Yerevan marked the beginning of a rapprochement between the two nations that nearly led to the normalization of their historically strained relations. Then Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian flew to Turkey a year later to watch a second game between the two teams.\".",
