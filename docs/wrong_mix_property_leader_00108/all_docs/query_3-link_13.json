        "text": "After weeks of mass protests across the country led by opposition figure Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who had just completed two terms as president, was forced to resign on April 23. A referendum on a package of Constitutional reforms in 2015 that switched the country’s governance from a presidential to a parliamentary one, paved the way for Sargsyan to seek the new and powerful office of Prime Minister. Pashinyan, along with the Reject Serzh and Take a Step initiatives were able to capitalize on what many in Armenia saw as a power grab by Sargsyan and his powerful Republican Party (RPA). Following the resignation of Sargsyan, the country was thrown into political crisis. Pashinyan and his supporters continued to mobilize the population to demand that he, as the “people’s candidate,” should be elected as the country’s interim prime minister in a parliament that was dominated by the RPA.\n\nOn May 1, a special parliamentary session failed to elect a prime minister after the RPA refused to vote in favor of Pashinyan.
