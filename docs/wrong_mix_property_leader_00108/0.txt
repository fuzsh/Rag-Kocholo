On March 5 Vazgen Sargsyan would have turned 52.

Vazgen Sargsyan, who devoted much of his life to Armenia’s fight against Azerbaijan for liberation of Nagorno Karabakh, was crowned by Armenian nation as Sparapet – the title that over ages was awarded to very few persons.

Vazgen Sargsyan was born in 1959 in the village of Ararat. He was a qualified sports trainer and taught physical education until 1983, when he started his political career.

In 1985 he became a member of the Writers’ Union of Armenia, and worked as chief of the department of journalism of Garun magazine.

In 1990-92, Sparapet was the commander of the Yerkrapah group, gaining a reputation as a military leader. It was this reputation that helped him rise to the office of Defense Minister of Armenia in 1991 and country’s Prime Minister in 1999.

Nearly five months later he was shot dead during an armed attack on Armenian parliament on October 27, 1999.

Sparapet Vazgen Sargsyan was posthumously awarded the title of Armenia’s National Hero.
