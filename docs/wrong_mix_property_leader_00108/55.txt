Today marks the birthday of Vazgen Sargsyan, a national hero of Armenia and a politician famed posthumously as Sparapet (military leader).

The former minister of defense and prime minister would celebrate his 55th birth anniversary today if alive. During the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, Sargsyan was the commander of the volunteers’ detachment Yerkrapah (defender of land). He was honored with the titles of National Hero of Armenia, and Hero of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). He was also a knight of the “Golden Eagle” medal. Sargsyan was killed in the Armenian parliament shooting of October 27, 1999.

Vazgen Sargsyan was honored as Sparapet thanks to his dedication to the difficult task of creating an army during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, a period when Armenia, a newly emerging state after the USSR’s collapse, did not have regular armed forces, says Vardan Devrikyan, a literary critic.

“Should war operations erupt tomorrow or sometime in the future, for example, we won’t give the name Sparapet to our minister of defense. And not because he is far behind in terms of his personal qualities, but because we now have an accomplished state and an army, with everybody being in his or her place, in a corresponding position and with corresponding responsibilities,” he told Tert.am, noting that characters like Vazgen Sargsyan are the birth of time.

Suren Abrahamyan, a former minister of interior and a friend of Sparapet, described the hero as an “awfully” colorful personality.
