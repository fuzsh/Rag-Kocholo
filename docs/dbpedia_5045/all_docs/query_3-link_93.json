With a flight lasting 25 hours, Titov was the first person to sleep in space. After sleeping for around one orbit, he awoke to find his arms floating in front of him, causing a hazard to switches and controls. He secured his arms in a belt and returned to sleep, claiming to have \"slept like a baby\" once his arms were out of the way."
