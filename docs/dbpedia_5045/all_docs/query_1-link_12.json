        "text": "Yuri Gagarin's single orbit of Earth 50 years ago this month ushered in the era of human spaceflight.\n\nGagarin's 108-minute flight was another major propaganda coup for the Soviet Union, which had successfully launched the first satellite - Sputnik - in 1957.\n\n\"I was a young fighter pilot in Germany I was flying F-102s in Rammstein Germany. We were more focused on the building of the Berlin Wall that year, rather than the space race,\" says Nasa astronaut Charles Duke, who walked on the Moon during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972.\n\n\"When he flew, my first impression was - well, they beat us again.\"\n\nSergei Khrushchev, the son of Nikita Khrushchev, who was the Soviet premier at the time of Gagarin's flight, told BBC News: \"We were very proud but we did not really understand how important it was. It was one more flight, one more achievement.\"\n\nBut he says his father was acutely aware of the significance, and orchestrated a celebration in Red Square upon Gagarin's return to Moscow.\n\n\"When we look at the response of the Muscovites, where everyone was in the streets, on the roofs of buildings and in the windows, I would compare this celebration with the May 9 victory day (the end of World War II for the Soviet Union),\" says Sergei.\n\nDuring the Cold War, such \"firsts\" were used by the USSR to claim technological might and ideological superiority.\n\nBut the architects of both the US and Soviet space programmes had loftier ambitions of sending humans on voyages around the Solar System.\n\nThe Americans and the Soviets experimented by sending animals into space prior to launching people.\n\nDespite several notable failures, the successful tests signalled that humans were capable of surviving the stresses of spaceflight.\n\nThe list of 20 candidates was eventually whittled down to two: Gagarin and fellow test pilot Gherman Titov.\n\nIt has been suggested that Gagarin's humble upbringing may have tipped the scales in his favour. While Titov came from a middle-class background, Gagarin was the son of workers. The Soviet leadership may have regarded this as a demonstration that, under communism, even those who came from modest families could succeed.\n\nBut others insist that the cosmonauts' performance during the selection process was much the more important factor.\n\nIn early 1961, US astronaut Alan Shepard had been training for a sub-orbital flight on a Mercury-Redstone rocket scheduled for May that year.\n\nThe Soviets were not aware of the schedule, but Sergei Korolev, chief scientist for the USSR's space programme, was worried the US would be first and pushed for a manned launch as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to a transcript of the communication with ground control, Gagarin was struck by the view through the capsule's window, commenting on our planet's \"beautiful aura\" and the striking shadows cast by clouds on the Earth's surface.\n\nBut the cosmonaut had no control over his spacecraft during the historic flight.\n\n\"No-one knew what effect zero-g would have on the astronauts when they were up there. They were so concerned that he might be disorientated and disabled once he was in weightlessness,\" says Reginald Turnill, the BBC's aerospace correspondent from 1958-1975.\n\n\"It was decided right from the beginning that he would not be allowed to control the spacecraft, it would all be done from the ground.\"\n\n\"The whole purpose was to score points off the West,\" he recalls, adding: \"We were given the ultimate idiot's treatment.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he had landed in the capsule or had ejected and finished his journey by parachute, Gagarin replied: \"The landing proceeded successfully and my presence here demonstrates the success of the systems.\"\n\nThe first human spaceflight intensified the incipient space race between the superpowers.\n\nAbout a week after Gagarin's flight, US President John F Kennedy tasked his Vice-President Lyndon Johnson to report back on the state of the US space programme, external.\n\nJohnson warned that urgent action was needed to prevent the Soviet Union leaving the US far behind in space exploration. But with sufficient resources and effort poured into its space programme, the US could be first to send a man to the Moon by the late 1960s, external.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk"
