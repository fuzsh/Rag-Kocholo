        "text": "Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (9 March 1934 – 27 March 1968) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut. He was the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\n\nGagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation’s highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\n\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), on 9 March 1934. His parents worked on a collective farm: Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.\n\nYuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.\n\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10 ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation. His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945. In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.\n\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow, and also enrolled at a local “young workers” school for seventh grade evening classes. After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work, he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors. While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly — at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer. He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.\n\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin. On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot’s School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957. After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.\n\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics — space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5 ft 2 in) tall.\n\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\n\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.\n\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin. One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.\n\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\n\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper… I don’t think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.\n\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.\n\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: Кедр, Siberian pine or Cedar).\n\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\n\nKorolev: “Preliminary stage….. intermediate….. main….. lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.”\n\nGagarin: “Поехали!” (Poyekhali!—Let’s go!).\n\nGagarin’s informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.\n\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\n\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.\n\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune “The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows” (Russian: “Родина слышит, Родина знает”). The first two lines of the song are: “The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky”. This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\n\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, “I don’t see any God up here.” However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight. In a 2006 interview, Gagarin’s friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev’s speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state’s anti-religion campaign, saying “Gagarin flew into space, but didn’t see any god there.” Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, “Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.”\n\nGagarin’s flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in theGreat Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt and Finland to promote the Soviet Union’s accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London andManchester.\n\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a “sensible drinker”, his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.\n\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union, and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963. Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin’s protests that additional safety precautions were necessary. When Komarov’s flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\n\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base. Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities. Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot. On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.\n\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\n\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\n\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\n\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB’s report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin’s planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin’s aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.\n\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft. A similar theory, published in Air & Spacemagazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.\n\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.]\n\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission’s original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a “super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,” or to avoid “entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover”.\n\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard “two loud booms in the distance.” Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 ‘Flagon’) was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and “without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin’s plane while breaking the sound barrier.” The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin’s plane crashing. In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, “unauthorized” Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480 ft) and that, while running afterburners, “the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10–15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin – a deep spiral, to be precise – at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.” As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.\n\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot’s School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva, a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School. They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.\n\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.\n\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.\n\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5 ft 2 in), one of Gagarin’s most notable traits was his smile. Many commented on how Gagarin’s smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.\n\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, “If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.” Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.\n\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile “that lit up the Cold War”.\n\nProfile: Yuri Gagarin\n\nOn 12 April 1961, manned space travel escaped the pages of fanciful fiction and arrived blazing into the here-and-now.\n\nThe first space flight was a triumph for the Soviet Union and a political and diplomatic setback for the US.\n\nBut Yuri Gagarin was an instant history-maker whose achievement transcended the politics of the time.\n\nHe was born in the village of Klushino, outside Moscow; his father was a carpenter, while his mother worked as a milkmaid. His family, like many others, had suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the Gagarins were forced out of their home and had to live in a tiny “mud hut” nearby. Yuri’s brother Valentin and his sister Zoya were deported to labour camps in Poland.\n\nWhen the future cosmonaut was just 13, he moved with his family to the city of Gzhatsk. His father dismantled the house in Klushino, moved it to the city and rebuilt it there.\n\nFriends and family remember a fun-loving boy, fond of pranks, but also keen on his studies.\n\nYelena Kozlova taught Gagarin botany while the future cosmonaut was at school in the city.\n\nNow 91, she recalls that Yuri’s favourite subjects were maths and physics: “No-one was able to resist his smile! And girls always liked him, too,” she explained.\n\nGagarin initially graduated from trade school as a foundryman. But he later chose to pursue his studies, enrolling for a technical degree at the Saratov Technical College. While studying here, Gagarin learnt to fly with the local “aero club”.\n\n“When he was a student at the Saratov Technical College, he didn’t have much money, and to make some extra cash he had to work part-time as a dock labourer on the Volga River – and he used the money to buy presents for his family,” his niece Tamara Filatova told BBC News.\n\nIn 1955, Yuri Gagarin entered the Orenburg Pilot School, and upon graduation joined the Soviet Air Force as a lieutenant.\n\nIt was here that he met his wife, Valentina, a graduate of the Orenburg Medical School. Soon after the couple married, Gagarin began a tour of duty as a fighter pilot.\n\nIn 1960, Gagarin – along with 19 others – was selected as a candidate for the Soviet space programme.\n\n“Gagarin was a very clever young man. He was head and shoulders above all the other cosmonauts,” says Reg Turnill, the BBC’s aerospace correspondent from 1958-1975.\n\n“He was so quick to learn and had such an easy personality that he was very popular among the top brass, because he could be relied on to play ball and not to give away any secrets.”\n\nThe pool of 19 was eventually whittled down to two: Gagarin and fellow test pilot Gherman Titov. Some have suggested that Gagarin’s relatively humble background may have given him the edge over Titov.\n\nOn the morning of 12 April 1961, the 27-year-old Gagarin blasted off atop a 30m-high rocket from the Tyuratam Missile Range (now Baikonur Cosmodrome).\n\n‘Here we go’\n\nThe story goes that Gagarin yelled “poyekhali” (“here we go”) as his rocket blasted off from Earth. For many, the line embodied the impatience of all those who had for decades dreamed of exploring space.\n\nDuring the historic 108-minute orbital flight, Gagarin was able to consume food through squeeze tubes and kept mission control updated on his condition using a high-frequency radio and a telegraph key.\n\nThe mission came perilously close to disaster. During re-entry, cables linking the spacecraft’s descent module to the service module failed to separate. This caused violent shaking during the fiery re-entry through the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nGagarin baled out before his capsule hit the ground and parachuted to a safe landing near the Volga River.\n\nAfter the flight, the Soviets invited foreign news reporters to attend a news conference in Moscow. Communist Party representatives were on-hand to make sure Gagarin’s answers did not stray off-message.\n\nGagarin was subsequently bestowed the title of Hero of the Soviet Union by the USSR’s leader Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nOvernight, Gagarin achieved international renown. He toured the world in style, signed autographs, rubbed shoulders with world leaders and kissed the Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida.\n\nBurden of fame\n\nGagarin and his wife Valentina had two daughters – Galya and Lena.\n\nBut fame brought its own set of pressures. In the biography Starman, by Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony, acquaintances recount that Gagarin had always been a sensible drinker.\n\nBut his relentless public schedule inevitably led him towards social situations where he was expected to drink every time.\n\nWhile at a resort in the Black Sea, Gagarin was apparently interrupted by his wife while he was in a room with another woman – a nurse called Anna.\n\nThe details are sketchy, but the night ended with Gagarin jumping out of a second-floor window. “He hit a kerbstone with his forehead. It was not a good landing,” a source who remembers the incident recounts in Starman.\n\nNikolai Kamanin, head of cosmonaut training, was first to reach Gagarin. There was so much blood, Kamanin imagined the cosmonaut must have shot himself. The fall caused serious trauma to Gagarin’s face, leaving a visible scar above his brow.\n\nIn the latter part of the decade, hopeful of returning to space, Gagarin began to focus on his training again.\n\nIn 1967, Gagarin was to have been back-up pilot to Vladimir Komarov on the Soyuz 1 mission which was to have seen a rendezvous between two Soviet spacecraft in orbit.\n\nSome of those close to the mission apparently knew the Soyuz system had flaws. Komarov told friends he knew he would probably die, but would not back out because he did not want his friend Gagarin to be killed.\n\nFinal flight\n\nKomarov’s parachutes failed to open during re-entry in April 1967. He died when his spacecraft slammed into the ground.\n\nOn 28 March 1968, Gagarin was himself killed on a routine training flight. He was 34 years old.\n\nHis MiG-15UTI went into a dive and crashed into forest near the town of Kirzach, north-east of Moscow. Gagarin’s co-pilot Vladimir Seregin was also killed. The cause of the crash is unknown, and many conspiracy theories have grown up in the intervening years.\n\nAmong the more credible theories is that proposed by fellow cosmonaut Alexey Leonov, who believes that a Sukhoi jet – flying below its minimum altitude – passed within metres of Gagarin’s plane. This triggered turbulence which sent the MiG into a spin from which it did not recover.\n\nAlternatively, a cabin air vent may have been left open by the crew or a previous pilot and this may have led to oxygen deprivation and an inability to control the aircraft.\n\nWhatever the cause of the crash, since Gagarin’s epochal flight in 1961, more than 500 people have flown in space.\n\nThey all follow in the footsteps of the slight young man from Klushino who took a leap into the unknown some 50 years ago\n\nIn BBC"
