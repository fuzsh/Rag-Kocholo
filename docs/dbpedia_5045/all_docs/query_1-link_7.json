        "text": "The USSR has launched its second cosmonaut into space just four months after Yuri Gagarin made his historic venture.\n\nMajor Gherman Titov, aged 25, has amazed the world by spending the whole day in orbit over the Earth aboard his one-person Vostok II spacecraft.\n\nHe has been sending messages to every continent saying \"I feel splendid.\"\n\nSources in Moscow say he is due to land tomorrow morning after completing about 20 orbits around the globe.\n\nSleeping in space\n\nAt 1530 GMT he switched off radio communication so that he could get some sleep and turned it on again seven and a half hours later.\n\nHe is reported to have had a three-course meal for lunch and a substantial supper before turning in for the night.\n\nShortly before he was blasted into space from the Baikonur cosmodrome in the Kazakh Republic, he sent this message via the Tass news agency.\n\n\"It is difficult to express in words the feelings of happiness and pride which fill me. I have been entrusted with an honourable and responsible task.\"\n\nHe dedicated his flight to the 22nd congress of the Soviet Communist Party to be held in October, thanked the Soviet Government and its chairman Nikita Khrushchev. He also sent greetings to his \"great friend\" Yuri Gagarin.\n\nOnce in space, Major Titov sent another greeting to Mr Khrushchev to which the Soviet leader replied: \"All Soviet people are happy at your successful flight and are proud of you. We are awaiting your landing. We embrace you, Khrushchev.\"\n\nMajor Titov spent his time doing exercises and monitoring the effects of weightlessness on his body.\n\nMajor Gagarin, the first man in space, has sent a telegram congratulating his compatriot. The two men trained for two years together before Gagarin was chosen to fly into space on Vostok I on 12 April this year.\n\nThe response from the US on Russia's achievement has been muted. The United States Space Agency recorded the flight of Vostok II as \"an important technical achievement\"."
