Sarah Silverman's acting skills also won her small roles in a variety of films like ‘There's Something About Mary’, ‘School of Rock’, ‘Screwed’, ‘Heartbreakers’, ‘The Way of the Gun’, ‘School for Scoundrels’, ‘Rent’ and many more. Sarah’s television and film careers ran parallel to each other. She was often cast in a stereotypical role as a mean-spirited, pushy friend.
