        "text": "Jewish comedian Sarah Silverman is to bring her unique humour to Israeli audiences.\n\nThe controversial US star, who last year released her memoir The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, will perform a night of stand-up comedy in Tel Aviv later this month.\n\nMs Silverman, 40, will also address the Facing Tomorrow 2011 conference on June 21, which is being organised under the auspices of Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n\nKnown for being less than politically correct, Ms Silverman's jokes have covered everything from religion to race and feminism to politics.\n\nIn 2008 she launched \"the Great Schlep\", a campaign to encourage young Jews to convince their grandparents in Florida to vote for Barack Obama as president.\n\nMs Silverman, who says she is influenced by fellow Jewish comics Woody Allen and Albert Brooks, once told the JC that she was \"agnostic to the core\".\n\nBut as the younger sister of a rabbi, she added: \"I am Jewish and proud of this culturally and ethnically - the ways in which I was born this way and am happy with whom I am.\"\n\nWhile in Israel, it is likely the comedian will find time to visit her sister, Rabbi Susan Silverman, who lives on Kibbutz Ketura with husband and five children."
