        "text": "From inciting treason to telling poop jokes, Sarah Silverman has created her fair share of online chatter. With I Love You, America, she’s looking to connect with people who may not agree with her personal opinions through honesty, humor, genuine interest in others, and not taking herself too seriously. While it’s great to connect with like-minded people, Silverman feels it’s crucial, now more than ever, to connect with the un-like-minded.\n\nTickets are LIMITED, so sign up now to join Sarah in the intimate studio audience!\n\nThis show is on hiatus.\n\nThanks for another great season! Sign up NOW to see Sarah Silverman’s Emmy-nominated show LIVE when it returns in 2019! Please submit your information below and we will notify you as soon as tickets are released."
