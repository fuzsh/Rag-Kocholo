        "text": "Dear Judd,\n\nI’d love to help with your magazine project, but I am unable to for several reasons.\n\nI’m really, really busy and really, really popular. So right off the bat, that’s a tough squeeze time-wise.\n\nI can’t say I’m familiar with this publication, unless it’s connected to the super-fancy paper-plate-and-plasticware company I love so much. Still, I’m sure you understand I can’t be writing art for a paper-plate-company magazine.\n\nO.K. I just Googled it and I do know this magazine—and as it turns out I have a big beef with them. Whenever they have a young-up-and-coming-movie-starlets-of-tomorrow cover, I’m blatantly snubbed. Am I not good enough to lounge in a vintage gown from the 1930s, lazily draped on a chaise, pretending to be in the same room as 14 other cut-and-pasted actresses in similar garb and furniture and poses? I was born to do that, and this magazine took that from me and continues to take that from me with every passing year. And why? Why am I repeatedly overlooked? Because I’m a polarizing Jew? Or is it because of what we all know but are afraid to say: I’m just too goddamned pretty?\n\nWe may never know, but what I do know is this: You will have to do your comedy-issue curating sans me. I hope this doesn’t hurt sales too much.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Jane Anastasia Silverman XIV\n\nPS: Mark Brazill was right.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nTelevision\n\nAngry House of the Dragon Fans Claim One Gay Kiss Has “Ruined” the Series\n\nThe episode “Smallfolk” has received an overwhelming number of one-star reviews, with many citing a passionate moment between Rhaenyra and Mysaria.\n\nPolitics\n\nTucker Carlson Portrays Donald Trump, of All People, as Trying to “Return Democracy to the United States”\n\nThe right-wing talker once privately mocked the former president’s stolen election claims. But on stage Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, Carlson lauded Trump as a “responsible” and “unifying” leader who could bring a fractured nation back together.\n\nAward Season\n\nFor Lessons in Chemistry, Brie Larson Learned How to Experiment\n\nShe couldn’t quite crack brilliant scientist Elizabeth Zott for the Emmy-nominated show until she had her own epiphany.\n\nTelevision\n\nJ.D. Vance’s Mythical Couch Tryst Is a Fact-Checker’s Nightmare. Stephen Colbert Explains Why.\n\nDuring his Late Show monologue, Colbert roasted Donald Trump’s running mate for the untrue (?) sofa-billy elegy currently delighting the internet.\n\nHollywood\n\nHarvey Weinstein to Face New Sexual Assault Trial in November\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan might bring new accusations against the previously convicted former movie mogul.\n\nCelebrity\n\nJennifer Aniston Slams J.D. Vance’s Resurfaced Remarks About “Childless Cat Ladies”\n\nAniston, who has been candid about her own struggle to conceive, also criticized Trump’s running mate for voting against the Right to IVF Act: “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.”\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nStyle\n\nBallerina Farm Influencer Hannah Neeleman Says She Doesn’t “Identify” as a Trad Wife\n\nThe Mrs. World competitor and mother of 8 says she doesn’t know “what feminism means any more” but said the one epidural she ever had was “kinda great.”"
