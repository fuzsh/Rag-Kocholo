She is known for taboo-busting stand-up routines, addressing subjects like race, sexuality, and politics, as well as Jewish identity and the Holocaust.\n\nAlthough she was born into a Jewish family, she considers herself non-religious.\n\nHer ancestors belong to Poland and Russia. In an interview, Sarah revealed her maternal grandmother was a holocaust survivor.\n\nWhile growing up as the youngest of four daughters in New Hampshire, Sarah attended the Derryfield School.\n\nIn an interview, she talked about growing up in the mostly Catholic town of Manchester, New Hampshire, and said,\n\nWe grew up in a place with very few Jews. I didn’t look like the other kids. I had hairy legs, hairy arms, hair everywhere. I looked like a little monkey.”\n\nWhen Silverman was six years old, her parents, Donald and Beth, divorced.\n\nDuring childhood, Sarah struggled with bedwetting, depression, and anxiety.\n\nDue to her chronic depression, she had become addicted to Xanax (Alprazolam).\n\nIn an interview, Sarah talked about her depression and said,\n\n“I don’t want to have children as they might inherit my depression.”\n\nShe first performed as a stand-up comedian at the age of 17 at the club “Stiches” in Boston.\n\nAlthough she attended college at New York University, she left in 1993 to pursue stand-up, telling sex jokes at open mic nights around Greenwich Village.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two, she was brought on as a writer for Saturday Night Live; however, none of her sketches aired, and she was fired via fax after one season. She later credited her SNL stint for her being so tough in her career.\n\nIn 1996, she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode “The New Writer” in which she played Sanders’ new staff writer.\n\nIn the same year, she made a guest appearance in “Future’s End,” a two-part episode from the third season of Star Trek: Voyager.\n\nSilverman later appeared in many television programmes like Mr. Show, Seinfeld, and Crank Yankers.\n\nWhile working with Michael Richards during her guest appearance on Seinfeld, she made a line mistake following which Richards left the shoot midway. She later called him out for his inappropriate behaviour, and Richards accepted his fault.\n\nShe also made small film roles in There’s Something About Mary, School of Rock, Bulworth, and other movies. In these films, she played both serious and comedic parts.\n\nAfter successful stage performances in New York City and Los Angeles, she released a concert film, Jesus is Magic, for HBO in 2005.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, she produced an offbeat single-camera sitcom, The Sarah Silverman Program, in which she portrayed a more arrogant and oblivious version of herself.\n\nThe Sarah Silverman Program ran for three seasons, and the show earned the nomination for a GLAAD Media Award for its portrayal of gay and lesbian characters. She also earned an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress for this sitcom.\n\nIn The Sarah Silverman Program, her sister’s role was played by her biological sister Laura.\n\nIn a story published in the November 2009 issue of Marie Claire, Sarah Silverman talked about her experience of visiting a turkey farm, which turned her into a vegetarian. She said,\n\nWhen I was 9 or 10 years old, my dad took me over to a neighboring farm to help get stuff for the meal. The farmer, Vic, told me to look at all the turkeys and pick one out. I saw a cute one with a silly walk and cried, ‘Him!’ Before my pointing finger had even dropped to my side, Vic had grabbed the turkey by the neck and slit throat. Blood and feathers went flying. I had sentenced that turkey to death! Up until then, I didn’t know where meat came from—and I’ve been a vegetarian ever since.”\n\nIn her humorous memoir The Bedwetter: Stories of Redemption, Courage, and Pee, published in 2010, Sarah Silverman explained how she developed her rebellious comedic perspective.\n\nShe later appeared in the films Take This Waltz, Wreck-It Ralph, and I Smile Back, and many documentaries about comedy, Holocaust humor, and mental health.\n\nShe was Jerry’s first guest on Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee season 2. They moved around in a 1969 Jaguar E-Type Series 2 and stopped at Millie’s, Silver Lake, restaurant for food and coffee.\n\nHer 2013 HBO special We Are Miracles earned her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special.\n\nIn 2015, she endorsed Bernie Sanders (Vermont Senator) for President of the United States.\n\nAt Cedars Sinai Hospital, she spent a week in the intensive care unit in July 2016.\n\nAt the 2016 Democratic National Convention, she supported Hillary Clinton.\n\nHer 2017 TV special A Speck of Dust for Netflix was nominated for a Grammy for Best Comedy Album.\n\nHer 2017-2018 Hulu talk show I Love You, America explored the cultural and political atmosphere of the Trump era.\n\nIn 2020, she began recording the Sarah Silverman Podcast for YouTube.\n\nShe often smokes weed.\n\nShe once said she would never make fat women jokes. She said,\n\nBecause I feel that we live in a society where fat men deserve love, and fat women do not deserve love — at least in white America. And so I feel like that’s an ugly thing, and it doesn’t make me laugh.”"
