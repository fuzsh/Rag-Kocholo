        "text": "Throughout Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency, one question has increasingly dogged those who oppose him: is it better to engage with bigots, or to isolate them? Sarah Silverman’s new talk show, I Love You, America, will likely challenge viewers to consider and reconsider where they stand on that question. In its premiere episode on Thursday, for instance, Silverman interviewed not only a family of Trump supporters from Louisiana, but also a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church. Some viewers will find these conversations galling and ill-considered; for those willing to stick around, however, I Love You, America is a fascinating, if occasionally challenging exploration of what, precisely, a streaming talk show can do.\n\nLest you think we’re getting too cerebral here, this show’s potential was signaled most by the fact that Silverman featured a full-frontal shot of a naked man within its first five minutes. (See, streaming can get away with things broadcast can’t.) Was it a juvenile digression? Certainly. But those clinical shots of bare genitalia also efficiently drove home Silverman’s point: this is not a typical late-night talk show.\n\nYeah, this show is weird. Just in case it felt too jarring, Silverman had a plan: “Whenever things veer off the beaten path,” she said, “all we have to do is just cut over to Mather and he will bring us back to the relatable comfort of familiarity.” Who’s Mather? Why, a man in a suit behind a desk, like nearly every other host in late-night history.\n\nBut perhaps the most jarring—and potentially most off-putting—feature of Silverman’s program is the open dialogue she engages in with people that most late-night programs would never interview. Plenty of straight news outlets have attempted to “humanize” Trump supporters from middle America; will liberal viewers jump at the prospect of watching Silverman do the same thing? Sure, she’ll rebuke someone who, say, believes that gay people should not be allowed to raise children—but she also has the power to do that because of her privileged position. The leeway viewers are willing to give her could make or break the show as a whole.\n\nAfter her interview with the Louisiana family, Silverman returned to her set—which looks a lot like a log cabin filled with Ikea’s finest; why not!—for another interview. This time, she chatted with Megan Phelps-Roper, a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church. Phelps-Roper left the church and her family five years ago after expanding her social circle on Twitter, where she got into a series of discussions with her now husband. With this exchange, Silverman clearly makes her case for conversation—even when it’s difficult, frustrating, or yes, even dangerous.\n\n“I think one thing that’s really important for people to understand is that I think extremists generally are not psychopaths,” Phelps-Roper told Silverman. “They’re psychologically normal people who have been persuaded by bad ideas. And we can’t expect to, like, isolate these people and hope that those ideas will just fade into oblivion. We have to actually engage those ideas and find ways of, one, understanding the mind-sets of the people that we’re dealing with and then effectively constructing arguments and evidence and presenting those things. And it’s not just for the sake of these extremists . . . because they impact the rest of society.”\n\nNow on Netflix\n\nThe Smartest Joke in Sarah Silverman’s Netflix Special Is a Poop Joke\n\nIn an interview, the comedian breaks down her expertly crafted joke, which pivots from a sober rape story into toilet humor in an instant.\n\nToronto Film Festival\n\nSarah Silverman Says Comedians Should Learn from P.C. College Kids\n\nVanity Fair’s Krista Smith sits down with the star of I Smile Back at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nWatch Sarah Silverman Reveal Her. . .Unorthodox Pre-Show Ritual\n\nThe comedian’s freshly scented stand-up special hits Netflix on May 30.\n\nNews\n\nDonald Trump Doesn’t Change\n\nInstead of resetting his 2024 campaign, the GOP nominee is offering America a 2016 rerun.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump’s GOP Acceptance Speech Gives America Whiplash\n\nThe former president, subdued in recounting last week’s assassination attempt, went right back to dishing out MAGA red meat. Despite talk of “unity” at the Republican National Convention, underneath was the same old right-wing agenda.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Jumped The Shark\n\nThe former president was hoping his conversation with Elon Musk could reset his spiraling campaign. Instead, the glitchy, garbled interview underscored just how boring the Trump Show has gotten.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Called Kamala Harris “Bitch” Multiple Times: NYT\n\nThe former president’s team denied the remarks. Yet, this wouldn’t be the first time he’s used the slur when referring to women.\n\nCelebrity\n\nSimone Biles Deserves Another Gold for Apparently Shading Donald Trump\n\nThe gymnast came into the Paris 2024 Summer Games with something to prove. Once she got two gold medals, she followed them up with a few social media dunks.\n\nPolitics\n\nDoes Anyone Know What Donald Trump Is Talking About Anymore?\n\nHannibal Lecter? Cheerios? “Bird cemeteries?” The former president is tying himself in a knot of discursive tangents and in-jokes that only makes sense to an increasingly small sect of the American public."
