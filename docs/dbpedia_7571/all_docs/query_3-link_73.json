I’m gonna need a quick answer on this.”\n\nResponding to the new backlash, Silverman wrote on Twitter: “Some very odd people are saying I’m a pedo, re: a joke from a time not that long ago when hard absurd jokes by comedians were acknowledged for what they were — jokes — not a disingenuous national threat to people fake-clutching their pearls (whilst ranting the country’s too PC).”\n\nThe actor, who recently appeared in the highly-acclaimed Billie Jean King biopic Battle of the Sexes, had previously defended the joke on Twitter.\n\n“Comedy is subjective,” she wrote February 2018. “I thought it was a funny/dumb tweet eight years ago when I posted it.”\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\nShow all 50\n\nMultiple comedians and Hollywood persons have been criticised recently over jokes made years previously.\n\nMost notably, James Gunn was fired by Disney from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after multiple jokes concerning pedophilia and rape were unearthed. The cast of the previous Guardians movies have since come to the director’s defence.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
