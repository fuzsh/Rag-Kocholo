        "text": "SARAH Silverman has made a career out of her cutting jokes and witty take on modern life.\n\nHowever, the comedian has found herself in hot water after a 2007 video of her roasting Britney Spears has remerged.\n\nWho is Sarah Silverman?\n\nBorn on December 1, 1970, 50-year-old Sarah is an American stand-up comedian, actress, singer, and writer.\n\nHer comedy addresses social taboos and controversial topics, such as racism, sexism, politics, and religion.\n\nSarah is known for her satirical style and delivering her comedy in a deadpan fashion.\n\nSarah got her big break in 1993 when she joined Saturday Night Live.\n\nIs Sarah Silverman married and who has she previously dated?\n\nSarah isn't married, but in October 2020 she revealed she was dating comedian Rory Albanese.\n\nThe pair started their romance during lockdown whilst playing an online video together.\n\nBefore Rory, Sarah had two very high profile romances.\n\nShe famously was in a relationship with Jimmy Kimmel from 2002 until 2009.\n\nAfter him, she dated actor Michael Sheen for four years from 2014 to 2018.\n\nWhat did Sarah Silverman say about Britney Spears at the 2007 VMAs?\n\nThe 2021 television documentary Framing Britney Spears has put the singer's controversial conservatorship in the spotlight.\n\nThis proved to be bad news for Sarah when a Britney roast she performed at the 2007 MTV VMAs resurfaced on social media.\n\nSarah's routine came immediately after Brit's famous disastrous performance of Gimme More that reportedly left the singer embarrassed.\n\nUnfortunately this made Sarah's jokes seem even meaner.\n\nDuring the routine she said: “She’s 25 and she’s already accomplished everything she’s ever going to accomplish in her life.\n\n“She’s a mother. It’s crazy. It’s weird to think that just a few years ago on this very show she was this, like, sweet, innocent, little girl in slutty clothes writhing around with a python.\n\n“Have you seen Britney’s kids? Oh my God, they are the most adorable mistakes you will ever see!”\n\nWhat has Sarah Silverman said about it since?\n\nOn February 9, 2021, the Britney roast video went viral.\n\nSarah responded on Twitter by saying: “I was known then 4 roasts.\n\n“MTV asked me to mini-roast Britney after her big performance.\n\n\"While she was performing I was having diarrhoea & going over my jokes.\n\n\"Had no idea she didn’t kill. Unfortunate. Art changes over yrs as we know more & the world changes.\"\n\nIn a follow up tweet she expressed regret while also calling out whoever posted the video for bringing undue attention to something that aired on television well over a decade earlier.\n\nShe wrote|: “I wish I could delete it but I can’t. But you are posting it for people to see. So r u trying to be kind or right?”"
