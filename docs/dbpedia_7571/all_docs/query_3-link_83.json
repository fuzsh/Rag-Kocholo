        "text": "Gal Gadot, Amy Schumer, Jamie Lee Curtis, and more celebrities are taking to social media to show their support for Israel amid the country’s declared war against Hamas following the large-scale attack by the Palestinian militants Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Israeli-born Gadot was one of the most vocal celebrities to speak out about the war: the Wonder Woman star served two mandatory years in the Israel Defense Forces. “I stand with Israel, you should too,” Gadot wrote in an Instagram post published Saturday afternoon. “The world cannot sit on the fence when these horrific acts of terror are happening!”\n\nMore than 24 hours after Hamas launched its massive attack out of Gaza, Israeli forces are still hunting down groups of militant fighters holed up in several towns of southern Israel, according to the Associated Press. The Israeli Health Ministry reports that at least 500 people are dead and 2,000 others are injured in that country; 232 are dead and 1,790 others are injured in Gaza, the Palestinian Health Ministry announced Sunday.\n\nGadot has also published several Instagram Stories (which expire 24 hours after posting) about the war, including one that reads, “At least 250 Israelis have been murdered and dozens of women, children and elders held as hostages in Gaza, by Palestinian military group Hamas. Starting early morning, more than 3,000 rockets were fired. Hamas is holding hostages controlling bases and settlements in Israel. There have been more than 1,500 injured, and heavy fighting is still ongoing. ‘I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children.’ My heart is aching.”\n\nJerusalem-born talent manager Guy Oseary, perhaps best known to laypeople for his longstanding business relationship with Madonna, also posted a statement of support. While it no longer appears to be online, it was reposted by one-time Oseary client, comedian Amy Schumer. According to Schumer’s repost, Oseary posted a video that appears to be from the Supernova music festival, which was attacked by Hamas forces on Saturday, the BBC reports.\n\n“Over 200 Israelis have been murdered this morning. The terrorist organization Hamas said: ‘If you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it – get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts,’\" Oseary reportedly wrote. “This is horrific.. these murders are being celebrated in Iran. Noa in this video was at a music festival when she and others were shot at and kidnapped.. many women, children and elderly are being taken from their homes and kidnapped.”\n\n“I have always prayed for peace. ALWAYS,” Oseary’s statement reportedly continued. “I have always spoken up for my Jewish community and have also spoken up for my Arab brothers and sisters. I have no words today. Only heartbreak. Only tears.”\n\n“Jewish people are the only group not allowed to defend themselves,” Schumer added. “This has nothing to do with the occupation. Hamas don’t want end to occupation, They want to eradicate Israel. They’re funded by Iran, who are trying to destroy the peace deal.”\n\nActor Jamie Lee Curtis also reposted the images shared by Oseary, adding “My hand in yours” alongside an emoji of the flag of Israel.\n\nYael Grobglas, whose career began in Israel before she achieved U.S. stardom in shows like Jane the Virgin, lent her voice to the fight on Saturday morning. Via Instagram, she wrote, “Israel is under a massive terrorist attack. Hundreds of innocent Israeli civilians murdered, many kidnapped while others are held hostage. My heart is with everyone back home. I stand with Israel.”\n\nMeanwhile, on X (formerly Twitter), actor and comedian Sarah Silverman posted the same images and video shared by Oseary and others. She wrote, “My sister and nieces and nephews are there. They’ve been protesting BIBI for months.” (“Bibi” is the nickname of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.)\n\n“Fight for a two-state solution,” Silverman wrote. “Israelis are Jews and Arabs and all colors. There is so much complexity to this. But make NO MISTAKE Hamas is a terror organization who’s mission statement is kill all Jews. This fucking world breaks my heart.”\n\nAmid the chorus of support, one celebrity’s post stands out, mainly for its absence. On Saturday, reality star and model Kylie Jenner shared a post from the antisemitism opposition group Stand With Us, Insider reports. The photo depicts the Israeli flag, with the sentence “Now and always, we stand with the people of Israel” placed over it.\n\nJenner's repost was deleted “within an hour,” Page Six reports, with followers taking to X and to the comments of Jenner’s other posts with criticism for the celebrity. “It’s actually way worse that Kylie Jenner just deleted the Israel post,” one X user remarked. “It shows a lack of knowledge and care, she just posted it to be talked about.” Vanity Fair has contacted Jenner’s representatives for comment but has not received a response as of publication time."
