His quick wit, charisma and ferociously aggressive style of comedy have earned him critical acclaim, high accolades, and above all, a busy schedule. From being a regular on Fox’s Mad TV, starring in feature films, appearing on a number of national talk shows, and continually touring the country with his stand-up, Aries’s talents are becoming recognized and appreciated throughout the entertainment industry.\n\nAs a principal cast member on Fox’s hit sketch comedy show Mad TV, Aries brought a fresh, hip style to the already-edgy program from the third through the tenth season. The producers made full use of many of Aries’s talents by calling on him frequently to create new hilarious characters and write sketches. Some of the many recurring characters that Aries is famous for on the show include: Belma Buttons, Bill Cosby, Jesse Jackson, Mike Tyson, Walter (Crackheads), Reggie (Erascist), Dollar Bill Montgomery, Shaquille O'Neal, The Klumps, Michael Jackson, Sisqo, Evander Holyfield, El Diablo Negro and more.\n\nAries also boasts a number of uproarious impersonations on the show that include James Brown, Al Pacino, and his childhood idol Eddie Murphy. The Aries-branded sketch “Talkin’ American” was Mad TV’s most popular bit, keeping fans tuned in and boosting Mad’s ratings impressively on Saturday night.\n\nAries has also found great success in the world of feature films. At the age of 17, after being spotted in a comedy club, Aries landed a part in the movie Home of Angels, which also starred Abe Vigoda and Sherman Helmsley, but never saw a theatrical release. He then appeared in Out-of-Sync, and portrayed Red Foxx in Warner Bros.’s Why Do Fools Fall In Love. In addition, Aries starred alongside John Leguizamo in TriStar’s The Pest and delivered his most notable performance to date as Cuba Gooding, Jr.’s brother in Columbia’s blockbuster hit Jerry Maguire.\n\nAries was born on April 3, 1975 in Chicago but grew up in New York City. He remembers at the young age of six being the funnyman of the household and impersonating family members at the dinner table during holidays. By age 14, Aries was belting out his fresh stylings in front of paying audiences at local clubs around his hometown. Shortly thereafter, he appeared on Russell Simmons’s Def Comedy Jam on HBO and Showtime at the Apollo. The word was out about the prodigal superstar from then on, and in 1992, Aries moved to Los Angeles. He quickly landed a recurring role on NBC’s A Different World, and was signed to a huge development deal at one of the major television studios. The following year, Aries found himself starring in the short-lived CBS series South of Sunset with former Eagles guitarist Glenn Frey. Although the series didn’t last long, it did not discourage other networks from tapping Aries’s talents for their projects, as he soon appeared in Crosstown Traffic and Brisco County, Jr. for Fox. Ultimately, Aries’s fierce momentum landed him on Mad TV as a series regular, where he thrived for eight seasons.\n\nAries continues to spread his comedic wings with the development of feature film projects, which he is currently involved in writing. He is presently developing a feature project based on an original character that he created on Mad TV, as well as a thriller about a young black man immersed in hip-hop culture. Additionally, Aries has made appearances on many talk shows including: Loveline, Vibe, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Soul Train, and Late Friday. He has also lent his voice to an animated character on C-Bear and Jamal and had a recurring stint on Fox’s The Best Damn Sports Show Period, where he created some of the show’s funniest characters during his short time there.\n\nAries maintains a strong connection to his African roots and is involved in many charitable events, including a number of organizations that help abused women. He feels blessed to have been able to achieve everything that he has, but he in no way intends on stopping there. Given the extreme growing success rate of action comedies coming out of Hollywood, it’s safe to say that Aries Spears will be in demand for quite some time.\n\nThe Thursday, Friday Late, and Sunday Shows Are 18+ | All Other Shows 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\nTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\n\nValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\n\nManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPLEASE NOTE SEATING IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND WE WON’T BE ABLE TO SEAT INCOMPLETE PARTIES\n\nNEED A RESERVED TABLE FOR YOUR ENTIRE PARTY?

His raw energy, talent and comedic skill quickly landed Arnez the coveted hosting slot on BET’s longest-running comedy series “Comic View” for two seasons joining the ranks of hosts such as D.L. Hughley and Cedric the Entertainer. His hilarious new comedy special “Racially Motivated” is now available on Netflix.\n\nArnez J.'s charisma and physical agility are unforgettable. “J is a whirling dervish on stage—he runs, jumps, spins, slides, slips, and mugs through a performance, acting out many of his bits while describing them,” wrote Doug Kaufman in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Arnez admits of himself “I've always expressed my things through mannerisms and facial expressions rather than speaking.”\n\nOn his own at age 14, Arnez lied about his age to get a job at a gas station to work his way through school. With dreams to become a professional baseball player, Arnez began working as a flight attendant when those baseball plans fell through. It was while working as a flight attendant that Arnez discovered his comedic talent. He realized that he had the ability to keep the passengers and crew laughing and, upon encouragement from friends, he made his first attempt at stand-up comedy. After that first night on stage, he knew what he wanted to do. He left his job with the airlines and made the decision to devote all of his time to a career in comedy.\n\nArnez got a chance to combine his ambitions as both an athlete and performer when he was recruited by scouts for the famed Harlem Globetrotters basketball team who saw his very physical comedy routine at a local basketball game. However, after several months, a knee injury ended his Globetrotters career, finally clearing the way for him to devote himself full time to standup comedy.\n\nAn Atlanta native, Arnez began working the comedy circuit in Georgia and quickly became one of “Hotlanta's” funniest newcomers. A finalist in the “Bay Area Black Comedy Competition,” he was immediately noticed by the entertainment industry and was asked to make his first television appearance on Showtime's “Comedy Club Network.” Numerous television appearances soon followed including appearances on “The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,” “Louie Anderson's Comedy Showcase,” Comedy Central's “Make Me Laugh,” NBC's “Friday Night Videos,” “The Mo’Nique Show”, Russell Simmons' “Def Comedy Jam,” his own BET “Comic View Grandstand Hour Special,” and “Comedy Central Presents: Arnez J.” He was most recently seen headlining Showtime’s “Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam.”\n\nToday, Arnez is widely considered one of the best working artists, with a polished and highly entertaining standup routine that keeps his audiences entertained. In keeping with his plan, Arnez keeps up a dizzying pace performing for sold out crowds at arenas and other venues across the country.\n\nThe Thursday, Friday Late, and Sunday Shows Are 18+ | All Other Shows 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\nTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\n\nValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\n\nManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPLEASE NOTE SEATING IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND WE WON’T BE ABLE TO SEAT INCOMPLETE PARTIES\n\nNEED A RESERVED TABLE FOR YOUR ENTIRE PARTY?

Chris quickly rose to success after being named the funniest person on MTV for his show-stopping performances on the Guy Code/Girl Code series. From there, he went on to star in IFC’s Benders, co-host the Netflix gameshow Ultimate Beastmaster, and even have his own CBS sitcom. Outside of TV, Chris has become one of the most respected and flat-out funniest comedians in the stand-up world. Fresh off his appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman and Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2019, Chris released his first special, Size 38 Waist, on Comedy Central, which perfectly encompassed both his Brooklyn-born edge and nice-guy charm. Chris’ second full-length special, Speshy Weshy, premiered on Netflix in May of 2022 to wide acclaim.\n\nWhen Chris isn’t on stage delivering his gut-busting jokes, you can catch him in his element in the comfort of his own couch where he records his wildly successful podcasts, Chrissy Chaos, co-hosted by Mike Cannon, and Hey Babe, co-hosted by Impractical Jokers' Sal Vulcano. Both podcasts are among the most popular on all streaming platforms and have massive followings on Patreon. In 2022, Chris was selected by Jimmy Kimmel to host Jimmy’s latest TV venture, Super Maximum Retro Show, which is currently available to stream on ViceTV. A big sports fan, Chris has been fortunate to host episodes of shows including MLB’s Off The Bat and MSG's The Brackets, and was invited by the New York Mets to throw the first game pitch in 2021.

Away for eight years, Luis seems unfrozen from longer ago, with nostalgia for his '90s gang-banging days and a penchant for quoting Austin Powers at the most problematic times.
