        "text": "There’s something about New Hampshire that has sparked creativity, mystery, and inspiration from its very beginnings. Some of the country’s most famous and iconic comedians are deeply connected to New Hampshire, whether by birth, upbringing, or summer residences.\n\nHere’s a look at some famous comedians with ties to New Hampshire…\n\nAdam Sandler is arguably the most famous comic talent to come out of the state. The comedian/actor/director/songwriter wasn’t born here, but he and his family moved to Manchester from Brooklyn in 1972 when he was 6 years old. The “Saturday Night Live” alum and Mark Twain Prize for American humor award winner visits his old haunts here often and can be seen sporting New Hampshire merch in his films. In a recent YouTube video, Sandler can be seen at a film set kissing the Dunkin Donuts cup in his hand and saying, “You can take the boy out of New Hampshire but you can’t take the New Hampshire out of the boy.” And he’s proven that with support for local causes, including a $1 million donation to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America in Manchester.\n\nComedian, actor, writer, and talk show host Seth Meyers, moved to Bedford when he was 10 and graduated from Manchester High School West before heading off to college at Northwestern University. Like Sandler, Meyers makes occasional trips back to the Granite State and has given performances to raise money for local organizations.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award winner, Sarah Silverman, was born in Bedford in 1970 and like Sandler, was raised in Manchester. In 1993, she also joined the SNL family, and her career as an actor, writer, and stand-up comedian skyrocketed from there. During lockdown, Silverstein did a YouTube video for Visit New Hampshire, listing all the reasons why she “loves” New Hampshire including fall foliage, kayaking, and the Red Arrow Diner.\n\nA lot of Granite Staters might be surprised to know that the late George Carlin, got his start in comedy in New Hampshire. He grew up in Manhattan, but every summer got out of the city and went to Camp Notre Dame on Spofford Lake. The camp always had a talent show, and Carlin would participate and win every year,” according to an interview with his daughter, Kelly, on National Public Radio. “My dad … loved mimicking the voices and people and making up his own radio commercials.” Carlin wore the comedy/tragedy necklace he won at one of those shows until the day he died, said his daughter. Carlin never lost the comedy bug that stung him in New Hampshire and ended up winning five Grammys. After he died in 2008, his daughter spread some of his ashes on Spofford Lake."
