I'm Terry Gross.\n\nNot everyone likes my guest, comic Sarah Silverman. Her fearless social comedy\n\nturns off some people but has also won her devoted fans. On the surface, her\n\ncomedy may seem offensive to Jews, African-Americans, Latinos, gay people, you\n\nname it, but that's because she's in persona as someone who is clueless,\n\nuninformed but certain in their beliefs.\n\nHer Comedy Central series, \"The Sarah Silverman Program,\" had its season finale\n\nlast week. It was the third and perhaps final season, but is available as\n\ndownloads.\n\nSilverman is often the high point of award shows. She won an Emmy in 2008 for\n\nher video, whose title I can't say on the air, so I'll just call it \"I'm\n\nBleeping Matt Damon.\" It was first shown on \"The Jimmy Kimmel Show\" and went\n\nviral on the Internet.\n\nNot being shy about herself, Sarah Silverman has titled her new memoir \"The\n\nBedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption and Pee.\" A little later, we'll talk\n\nabout the bedwetting problems that plagued her when she was growing up.\n\nLet's start with a clip from \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Sarah is in a\n\nrestaurant, at a table with her sister Laura, who is played by Silverman's real\n\nsister Laura, and Laura's husband, Officer Jay McPherson, who is played by Jay\n\nJohnston.\n\n(Soundbite of TV show, \"The Sarah Silverman Program\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMr. JAY JOHNSTON (Actor): (As Jay McPherson) Did you tell Sarah the news?\n\nMs. LAURA SILVERMAN (Actor): (As Laura Silverman) Oh, it's nothing.\n\nMr. JOHNSTON: (As Jay) Nothing? What, have you flipped your lid or something?\n\nCome on, tell her.\n\nMs. L. SILVERMAN: (As Laura) Well, I'm creating a Holocaust memorial for Valley\n\nVillage.\n\nMr. JOHNSON: (As Jay) How adorable is that?\n\nMs. SARAH SILVERMAN (Actor): (As Sarah Silverman) Why would you have a memorial\n\nfor something that never happened?\n\nMs. L. SILVERMAN: (As Laura) That's not funny, Sarah. You know, a joke like\n\nthat just demonstrates that you don't understand what it really means to be a\n\nJew.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: (As Sarah) I think I know what it means to be Jewish, Laura.\n\nCheck this out. Excuse me, these pancakes are ishy.\n\nMr. JOHNSTON: (As Jay) Laura is right. You really should be more interested in\n\nthe Holocaust. I mean, I'm not even a Jew, and I love the Holocaust â uh, love\n\nreading about it because it's so interesting and stuff, the things that\n\nhappened.\n\nMs. L. SILVERMAN: (As Laura) You know, you should really think about becoming\n\nmore invested in our history. You know, there's a great class that you could\n\ntake...\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: (As Sarah) Oh, Yawn Kippur. You know, Laura, I am getting\n\nextremely bored at you, and I will not tolerate it, never again.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Silverman, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So I have to ask you, are\n\nyou good for the Jews or bad for the Jews?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I'm good for the Jews, I believe.\n\nGROSS: How do you know? How do you know?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I think that whenever a Jew has any kind of notoriety, good\n\nor bad, the Jews find it to be good. You know, it's like - you know Son of Sam?\n\nJewish.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: You know, so I think Jews tend to hold me in fairly high\n\nregard. I don't think that I â you know, and also because Jews tend to be able\n\nto take a joke. You know, it's kind of like there's a difference between...\n\nGROSS: When it's coming from Jewish people.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, or it's good-hearted.\n\nGROSS: I want to play another example of your humor, and this was, the people\n\nmight remember in the 2008 presidential campaign that in support of Barack\n\nObama you did a video called \"The Great Schlep\" to get out the older Jewish\n\nvote in Florida, and the excerpt we'll play explains the premise of \"The Great\n\nSchlep.\" So here it is. This is Sarah Silverman.\n\n(Soundbite of video, \"The Great Schlep\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: If Barack Obama doesn't become the next president of the\n\nUnited States, I'm going to blame the Jews. I am, and I know you're saying,\n\nlike, oh my God, Sarah, I can't believe you're saying this. Jews are the most\n\nliberal, scrappy, civil-rightsy people there are.\n\nYes, that's true, but you're forgetting a whole large group of Jews that are\n\nnot that way, and they go by several aliases: Nana, Papa, Zaidie, Bubby, plain\n\nold Grandma and Grandpa. These are the people who vote in Florida, and the\n\nFlorida vote can make or break an election.\n\nIf you don't think that's true, who don't you think back to two elections ago,\n\nwhen a little man named Al Gore got (bleep) by Florida? I'm making this video\n\nto urge you, all of you, to schlep over to Florida and convince your\n\ngrandparents to vote Obama.\n\nGROSS: So that's Sarah Silverman, and by the way, she has a new book called\n\n\"The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption and Pee.\" So what kind of\n\nreaction did you actually get from the two audiences that this was aimed at,\n\nthe grandchildren who were supposed to convince their grandparents to vote, and\n\nthe grandparents who were supposed to be convinced to vote for Obama?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: You know what? It was universally positive. It really was. I\n\ndon't remember...\n\nGROSS: Wow, have you ever had anything that was universally positive before?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: No, no. And you know what? I mean, I said stuff like: Get off\n\nyour fat Jewish asses. And you know what I mean? And like I made â but I guess\n\nyou're right. Coming from a Jew, you know, it eases the blow, but I think that\n\nultimately people like to be seen, even if it's not in the most beautiful\n\nlight, you know, I think, and I think it's a culture that has a dark humor and\n\nhas a humor about itself in general.\n\nGROSS: Okay, so you've titled your book \"The Bedwetter,\" and some of your book\n\nis devoted to the fact that when you were young, you used to wet your bed just\n\nabout every night, which was a horrible humiliation for you, particularly for,\n\nlike, sleepover parties, camping trips. How long did this last?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: You know, I was a bedwetter until I was about 15, and it was\n\nhumiliating. You know, I was sent to sleepover camp since I was six, and you\n\nknow, it's a recipe for disaster. But, you know, I guess the silver lining is\n\nthere's not much to lose after that in life, you know?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I think, you know, doing stand-up when I got a little older,\n\nthe prospect of bombing was like - who cares? You know?\n\nGROSS: As long as you're not peeing on stage accidentally.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Please, yeah.\n\nGROSS: So what did you do to cover up when you were young, and you were going\n\nto sleepover parties or summer camp?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: A lot of it was just denial. I think I pretended it didn't\n\nhappen more often than not. You know, at camp I would just make my bed over it.\n\nI would take my clothes off and put it deep into the hamper, and I probably\n\nreeked of pee.\n\nAt sleepovers, I would kind of pinch myself awake and try to not drink anything\n\ntoo late and just go to the bathroom as much as I could. But, you know, when\n\nyou pinch yourself awake all night, eventually your body gives in when you're a\n\nlittle girl and you fall asleep even deeper than ever. So it was usually\n\nunfruitful â or fruitful in a bad way.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: Did it make you feel out of control - something so fundamental that you\n\ncouldn't control? Did it make you think that you were just out of control of\n\nyour body in general?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, yeah, I think so. That's interesting. I mean, it was\n\nfrustrating to have something that I couldn't control. It was â you know, I was\n\na hairy kid, you know, with hairy arms and hairy legs because I wasn't allowed\n\nto, you know, shave my legs yet. And it was so different than everybody else.\n\nI grew up in a very blonde, L.L. Bean kind of New England town, and so the\n\nthings that were frustrating were things I couldn't control, and that's\n\nprobably the way it is for everybody to a degree.\n\nGROSS: So you tell a great story in the book about when you were â I think you\n\nwere, like, in high school or something, you were watching \"The Tonight Show\"\n\nwith Johnny Carson, and a comic comes on, a woman comic, who's talking about\n\nbedwetting. And you talk about the impact that had on you. Can you tell that\n\nstory?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: It actually wasn't a comedian but an actress.\n\nGROSS: An actress, yeah.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Her name was Jane Badler, and she was an actress going on\n\nJohnny Carson to talk about a miniseries she was in called \"V,\" which\n\ncoincidentally is now a series that they've revamped.\n\nAnd she was beautiful, and my mom got excited. She sat with me to watch it\n\nbecause she said this woman had been a Miss New Hampshire once. So it was\n\nexciting for us, you know, and there was like a connection. Here's this woman\n\nwho had been Miss New Hampshire and she's on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny\n\nCarson.\n\nAnd we're watching her, and she very cavalierly talked about being a bedwetter\n\nas a child, and I â it was like the Earth stood still. I couldn't believe it,\n\nyou know, and I - this thing that I was sure would be my deepest, darkest\n\nsecret of my life was something that was an anecdote for her, that life went on\n\nfor her, and she was even beautiful and, you know, an actress on television and\n\non Johnny Carson. And it wasn't dirty that she said it, and it wasn't â no\n\none's head exploded, and it kind of blew my mind. My head exploded.\n\nGROSS: I have a question that's maybe much to personal, but â so you can tell\n\nme it's too personal, and then I'll drop it.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Okay.\n\nGROSS: So after you got over the bedwetting part of your life, you discovered -\n\nnot too long after that you discovered sex and liked it and had lots of it with\n\nlots of people. And would it be going too far to suggest that the part of your\n\nbody that caused you the most humiliation then became a part of your body that\n\ngave you a lot of pleasure, connected you to men, opened up, like, a different\n\nworld?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I think I definitely, at the time, associated it with power.\n\nYou know, and that is such a neat point that I would never have thought of, but\n\nyeah, the part of me that caused so much pain and was so, I was so unable to\n\ncontrol, became the part of me that controlled, was able to kind of control\n\nothers.\n\nI think I also just developed so late that by the time I became, like, a sexual\n\nbeing, I was already a comedian, so it was â even though I wasn't known at all,\n\nI was in a comedy community where I got around a little for a couple years. But\n\nI don't regret it. I really loved it.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: Okay.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I got it out of my system.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sarah Silverman, and she's a comic. She has a Comedy Central\n\nshow, \"The Sarah Silverman Show.\" Now she has a new book called \"The Bedwetter:\n\nStories of Courage, Redemption and Pee.\" Let's take a short break here, and\n\nthen we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Silverman, and she has a\n\nnew book called \"The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption and Pee.\" In\n\nyour book, you write about how before you were born your parents had a baby who\n\ndied as an infant. The baby was staying over at your grandparents' house and\n\ngot accidentally strangled in the crib, by the way it...\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, it was a faulty crib, and yeah. He â it had broken, and\n\nthe baby had slipped down into the corner and had suffocated in that space.\n\nGROSS: A really horrible thing. Did your parents talk to you about this as a\n\nchild?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: You know what? Maybe they did. The way I remember it is my\n\noldest sister, Susan, who was older than Jeffrey, she knew the story, and we\n\nwere all very young and she kind of told my sister Laura and I, told it to us\n\nalmost like a ghost story. You know, we were kids.\n\nAnd that chapter's actually called \"The First Time I Bombed\" because it's about\n\nhow, you know, my father taught me how to swear when I was little, and I saw\n\nhow adults would be shocked but give me â you know, I got approval from it. And\n\nit was addicting.\n\nYou know, I saw this way that I could get approval, and I killed all the time,\n\nyou know, as a very young kid. And I call that chapter \"The First Time I\n\nBombed\" because my sister told us the story of Jeffrey, and shortly after, my\n\ngrandmother, who picked us up for our Sunday breakfast at a local diner, and\n\nshe said, everybody buckle up, and I - thinking I was going to kill, I said,\n\nyeah, we don't want to wind up like Jeffrey. And just silence. And my sisters\n\nturned and looked at me like I was crazy, and my grandmother just burst into\n\ntears, which I had never seen before, and I thought - what did I do, you know?\n\nGROSS: That interested me so much, since so much about your humor is about\n\nsaying things that seem horribly inappropriate and potentially offensive, but\n\nit's not personal in the way that this is. I mean, your grandparents felt so\n\nguilty because the baby died at their home. And so this was hurtful in a way\n\nthat your humor now is not. What did you learn from that experience?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I think, you know, I've been called edgy, but you know, in\n\nall honestly, I think that there is a safety in what I do because I'm always\n\nthe idiot. And unless you're listening to the buzz words and not really taking\n\ninto account the context or the content of it, you see that Iâm always the\n\nidiot always, the ignoramus in the scenario. So no matter what I talk about or\n\nwhat tragic event or, you know, off-color, dark scenario is evoked in my\n\nmaterial, I'm always the idiot in it, you know.\n\nGROSS: Because your persona is the idiot, yeah.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Whereas I guess in the car you were really behaving like an idiot, as\n\nopposed to being in the persona of an idiot.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, well, I was five.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I was five and had been taught repeatedly that saying bad\n\nthings was adorable and appreciated. So it was the first time I was - kind of\n\nhad the first adult though of there are consequences to my words.\n\nGROSS: I want to next play a clip of you on \"The Jimmy Kimmel Show\" and precede\n\nthis by saying I was sad, as probably a lot of fans of yours - and fans of\n\nyours who are also friends of Jimmy Kimmel were sad - when you split up. You\n\nknow, you feel sort of like, oh, two people I really like are together, isn't\n\nthat nice? And then, like, oh no, they're split up. Oh, how sad, you know.\n\nAnd so I can imagine it's probably very uncomfortable to have a relationship in\n\nthe public spotlight like that. But you both did something so funny with it.\n\nYou were on his show â you'd been on his show several times when you were a\n\ncouple, and then after you split you were on his show, and everybody, I'm sure,\n\nwould be thinking, oh, this is going to be so uncomfortable, and boy, did you\n\nuse that to effect. So let me play the excerpt of you on Jimmy Kimmel after you\n\nhad both split up. Here it is.\n\n(Soundbite of TV show, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\")\n\nMr. JIMMY KIMMEL (Host): So how are things?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Good, good.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. KIMMEL: What have you been up to? Everything good?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah, everything's been great, really, really great. And\n\nyou're good?\n\nMr. KIMMEL: Good, yeah.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Good.\n\nMr. KIMMEL: Nothing, you know, just doing the show.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. KIMMEL: So how'd you get interested in acting?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: I just, you know, I was, like, I was the class clown and, you\n\nknow, the kind of funny one in my family.\n\nMr. KIMMEL: You know, I've been reading a lot about you. I read that you\n\nstarted in, like, community theater in your hometown.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Yeah.\n\nMr. KIMMEL: What was that like?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: I just think that's really great. Sarah Silverman, how did you and Jimmy\n\nKimmel decide to do that together on his show?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Well, like you said, we wanted to take advantage of the stuff\n\nwe couldn't necessarily control, which was that, you know, people were aware of\n\nour private, you know, private stuff, and yeah, we took advantage of it, you\n\nknow. I don't know, it's just what you would imagine, you know.\n\nBut, you know, it was â we did use â we had a source to pull from for our\n\nawkwardness with each other, certainly.\n\nGROSS: So can I ask you a personal question? Do you want to have children?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Probably. I love children. I'm embarrassingly baby-crazy. I\n\ncould be in the middle of any intense conversation, and if somebody walks by\n\nwith a baby, I'm gone, you know, just â but you know, I really, I want to do it\n\nwhen it's kind of all I want, and I don't â you know, I think that I could have\n\na baby or have children and still have a rich life filled with other things,\n\nbut I really want to do it when it's kind of the most important thing to me.\n\nAnd also, you know, I'm â I'm not going to have a baby. You know, I happen to\n\nthink that there are already tons of perfectly good babies out there already\n\nborn, and I don't necessarily need to see a little me and, like, do it right\n\nthis time. I'm already trying to do it right this time with me.\n\nYou know, so I can see myself adopting. I'm not in a rush to do it. I'm 39, I\n\nknow, but when I think about having kids of my own, I think, you know what, the\n\nolder I am, as long as I can lift them and be alive for the big parts, I\n\nprobably will be, have more patience and be able to be a better parent at\n\nyoung-grandparent age. I don't know, I'm going with it because I'm 39 and not\n\nready, but I do love kids, and I'm very good â I've got a lot of really good\n\nmoves.\n\nLike, a three-year-old girl that's age around three to five or six, I've got a\n\nreally great move. This is what I do. I go: I'm going to tell you something,\n\nbut you can't tell anybody - and I know you're not supposed to tell kids to\n\nkeep secrets, but that's part of the rebellion.\n\nAnd then they go okay, and I say: I'm a princess.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: But I dress normal because I want people to treat me regular.\n\nAnd their brains explode. It's really fun.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: What kind of reactions do you get?\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Oh my god, their eyes go so wide. It's really â and I went\n\nreally far with it with my friends Sam and Nicki's daughter. I did that whole\n\nthing where I say I'm a princess and don't tell anybody, and I said when I come\n\nvisit you in New York, I have some of my old princess stuff that doesn't fit me\n\nanymore. Would you be interested in it? Yes, yes I would.\n\nSo I came to New York, and there's, like, this huge Halloween store on 4th and\n\nBroadway that used to be a Tower Records, and I went there and I bought a bunch\n\nof three-year-old, you know, size three little girl princess stuff, and I took\n\nit out of the package and mussed it up and put it in a trash bag and brought it\n\nover. It's the little pleasures.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Silverman, it's been great to talk with you. Thanks you so much.\n\nMs. S. SILVERMAN: Thank you so much. It's always exciting to be on FRESH AIR\n\nwith Terry Gross because I'm an avid listener and fan.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Silverman's new memoir is called \"The Bedwetter.\" You can read an\n\nexcerpt on our website, freshair.npr.org.

Iâm Terry Gross. Last summer, Congress passed the Tobacco\n\nControl Act that will, for the first time, allow the federal government to\n\nregulate the tobacco industry. It puts tobacco products under the authority of\n\nthe Food and Drug Administration. New regulations and restrictions are on their\n\nway. Also, cities and states across the country have been enacting indoor\n\nsmoking bans, so tobacco companies have come up with new smokeless products so\n\npeople can get their nicotine fix indoors.\n\nOne new nicotine product looks and tastes like little candies. Just this week,\n\nthe Harvard School of Public Health released a report warning that these\n\nproducts pose the risk of serious nicotine poisoning for children who eat them,\n\nthinking they're just candies. Weâll hear about these new developments in a\n\nminute.\n\nReports about the health dangers of cigarettes first began appearing in the\n\n1950s. Readerâs Digest published a widely read article titled âCancer by the\n\nCarton.â The following year, cigarettes sales declined for the first time.\n\nCigarette advertising was one of the subjects in the premier episode of âMad\n\nMen,â about an ad agency in the early â60s.\n\nLetâs hear a scene from that episode. The head of creative for the agency, Don\n\nDraper, is designing a new ad campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes and responds\n\nto the health care scare. He's making his pitch to the father and son who own\n\nLucky Strike.\n\n(Soundbite of TV show, âMad Menâ)\n\nMr. JON HAMM (Actor): (as Don Draper) Gentlemen, the Federal Trade Commission\n\nand Readerâs Digest have done you a favor. They've let you know that any ad\n\nthat brings up the concept of cigarettes and health together, well, it's just\n\ngoing to make people think of cancer.\n\nMr. JOHN CULLUM (Actor): (as Lee Garner Sr.) Yes, and we are grateful to them.\n\nMr. HAMM: (as Jon Draper) But what Lee Jr. said is right. If you can't make\n\nthose health claims. Neither can your competitors.\n\nMr. CULLUM: (as Lee Garner Sr.) So, we got a lot of people not saying anything\n\nthat sells cigarettes.\n\nMr. HAMM: (as Jon Draper) Not exactly. This is the greatest advertising\n\nopportunity since the invention of cereal. We have six identical companies\n\nmaking six identical products. We can say anything we want. How do you make\n\nyour cigarettes?\n\nMr. CULLUM: (as Lee Garner Sr.) We breed insect-repellant tobacco seeds. Plant\n\nthem in the North Carolina sunshine. Grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...\n\nMr. HAMM: (as Jon Draper) There you go.\n\nMr. DARREN PETTIE (Actor): (as Lee Garner Jr.) But everybody else's tobacco's\n\ntoasted.\n\nMr. HAMM: (as Jon Draper) No. Everybody else's tobacco is poisonous. Lucky\n\nStrike is toasted.\n\nGROSS: Thatâs Jon Hamm in a scene from the AMCâs series âMad Men.â\n\nOur guest, Duff Wilson, covers business and the tobacco industry for The New\n\nYork Times. He talked about new smokeless tobacco products and new tobacco\n\nregulations with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.\n\nDAVE DAVIES: Well Duff Wilson, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, in June, while\n\nall of us were focused on health care reform and other issues, there was\n\nactually this very important piece of tobacco legislation enacted by Congress.\n\nWhat does it do?\n\nMr. DUFF WILSON (Journalist, The New York Times): It regulates cigarette\n\nproducts and tobacco for the first time in history. Theyâve always been totally\n\nexempt from regulation basically, as a food or a drug, because of a Supreme\n\nCourt decision about 10 or 12 years ago. So finally the government can require\n\ntobacco companies to disclose whatâs actually in those cigarettes and it can\n\nregulate the contents of them.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And so now the Food and Drug Administration, right, the FDA...\n\nMr. WILSON: Mm-hmm.\n\nDAVIES: ...will have this under their purview. And you say for the first time,\n\ntheyâll actually have to tell us whatâs in cigarettes? We haven't known that up\n\ntell now?\n\nMr. WILSON: Thatâs right. We haven't known that. They wonât have to tell us.\n\nThe cigarette companies will have to tell the FDA. And then they may try to\n\nprotect some of that as trade secrets, but it gives the FDA something to try to\n\nregulate. You know, like not only the nicotine levels but all the other\n\nadditives that they have in cigarettes.\n\nDAVIES: Did this bill have specific provisions regarding say, marketing and\n\nadvertising of their products?\n\nMr. WILSON: Yeah it did. It rolls out a few important provisions really. One of\n\nthe main ones is they can no longer say they're light, mild or low tar\n\ncigarettes as of June 22nd this year. It was amazing to me to learn that these\n\nlight and mild, so-called cigarettes, are just as dangerous as the regular full\n\nstrength cigarettes, because people tend to inhale them deeper and hold them\n\nlonger and to take more puffs per cigarette, all to satisfy that nicotine\n\naddiction.\n\nDAVIES: Now is there a ban on advertising in color here? I mean is there some\n\nspecific provision regarding their advertising?\n\nMr. WILSON: Yes. Their advertising is supposed to be black and white text only.\n\nNo colors, no images, except inside tobacco stores where kids aren't allowed or\n\nin adult reader magazines. So they're really trying to remove the color\n\nadvertising that can be seen, let say, from the street, outside the, you know,\n\nthe corner bodega or convenient store.\n\nThereâs a further provision that would not allow any of those signs within a\n\nthousand feet of a school or playground.\n\nDAVIES: There's a much more visible warning label requirement with this new law\n\nas well?\n\nMr. WILSON: Yes. Thatâs one of the major changes we're going to see is\n\ncigarette packs, instead of that little warning that the surgeon general says,\n\nare going to have to be half covered, half the pack covered with a graphic\n\nwarning label, including images. So we're probably going to see images of lung\n\ncancer and lip cancer and those kind of awful pictures that you see in some\n\nadvertising nowadays in Canada and other countries. They're supposed to go in\n\neffect in 2013, so itâs a ways off. And this packaging image, if you will, like\n\nthe disease pictures on the pack, are going to be fiercely opposed, really, in\n\nthe courts and weâll see which way the courts go.\n\nDAVIES: Wow. You know, I want to talk about some other provisions and some\n\nother trends in the industry. But I have to ask you, first, where did the\n\nimpetus for these tough new regulations come from? You know, I think a lot of\n\nus, you know, and I'm sure, I know they were reported on but a lot of us may\n\nnot have been paying close attention.\n\nMr. WILSON: Mm-hmm.\n\nDAVIES: Where did the political momentum for these changes come from?\n\nMr. WILSON: Politically, I think it kind of came from Henry Waxman in the House\n\nand Ted Kennedy in the Senate. It came from 1994 hearings in Congress, when\n\nthose tobacco executives for the seven large companies testified under oath\n\nthat tobacco - or that cigarettes - were not addictive, not harmful and that\n\nthey had not been targeting kids.\n\nAnd so Henry Waxman, the Chairman of the House Committee, he told me recently -\n\nafter that whistle blower started coming out and industry documents were leaked\n\nout, he said after those executives, you know, lied before the whole American\n\npublic in a Congressional hearing. A couple of years after that hearing in\n\n1996, the FDA tried to assert its own authority cigarettes and say they were a\n\ndrug delivery device and that nicotine was a drug. That was appealed, and the\n\nSupreme Court knocked that down by a five to four vote saying that they needed\n\nspecial congressional authority. So itâs taken from â96 until last year â 13\n\nyears â to get that congressional authority.\n\nDAVIES: And how much of a factor was the election of Barack Obama, himself a\n\nsmoker who has struggled to quit?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. WILSON: Youâre right, that was a big factor. I think having a Democratic,\n\nyou know, House and Senate and Obama in the White House. President Bush was not\n\na big supporter of this proposal. In fact, it only passed the Senate by a two-\n\nvote margin last year in one of those filibuster votes.\n\nDAVIES: We're speaking with New York Times business reporter Duff Wilson.\n\nWeâll take a short break and then weâll talk some more.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nDAVIES: If youâre just joining us, we're talking about new regulations on\n\ntobacco enacted by Congress and soon to come from the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration. We're speaking with New York Times business reporter Duff\n\nWilson.\n\nI wanted to talk about some of the new products that tobacco industry has come\n\nup with. One of them are these products that are called snus. What are they?\n\nMr. WILSON: Snus is a spit-free, kind of, tobacco-filled pouch. Kind of like a\n\ntea bag, but smaller, that the user is supposed put inside their upper lip to\n\nget a nicotine hit without, you know, having to spit like they do on the\n\nbaseball games and the cowboy movies.\n\nDAVIES: And how long have they been around?\n\nMr. WILSON: Snus is hardly even around now. Itâs only been test marketed in a\n\nfew cities and itâs supposedly going to national distribution by one or two of\n\nthe companies now. I donât think you can really find it very easily at stores,\n\nbut they have hopes that it will grow.\n\nDAVIES: Now the other product that I've heard about are dissolvable tobacco\n\nproducts.\n\nMr. WILSON: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: Tell us about those.\n\nMr. WILSON: The major one is from R.J. Reynolds. Itâs called Camel Orbs. And\n\nagain, it also comes in a mint flavor as well as regular, and they look kind of\n\nlike Tic-Tacs. They come in a box kind of that size and they're these little\n\npellets that are dissolvable nicotine. Sorry Dave, I haven't tried one and I\n\ndonât really want to yet, but...\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. WILSON: ...theyâre what anti-smoking groups for kids are really concerned\n\nabout. The youth smoking opponents are really concerned that those Camel Orbs\n\nand similar dissolvable products are going to be, you know, attractive for kids\n\nbecause they look and sometimes taste a little bit like candy.\n\nDAVIES: Now, I guess one of the big questions about these new smokeless tobacco\n\nproducts is whether they are safer. What do we know about that?\n\nMr. WILSON: Mm-hmm.\n\nDAVIES: Safer than cigarettes. I mean you donât get it in your lungs, I guess,\n\nright?\n\nMr. WILSON: Oh yes. Yes. Absolutely. The actual product itself is much less\n\nharmful than a cigarette, 90 to 99 percent less harmful, I think most people\n\nwould agree. So the issue on it is whether it encourages more people to start\n\ndown the path of cigarettes, as this kind of a gateway product or actually\n\nhelps more cigarette smokers who would otherwise be hurting themselves to hurt\n\nthemselves less.\n\nDAVIES: But I guess the serious health issue that some are raising is whether\n\nthey're making this product, which as, you know, in some cases can look awfully\n\nappealing and somewhat like candy, they can make it, you know, that much easier\n\nfor a young person to get started on.\n\nMr. WILSON: Right. And they can also make it easier for current smokers to\n\ncontinue smoking and get around the fresh air laws so to speak. You know,\n\nthereâs three things that have been proven to help people quit. And smoking in\n\nthis country has gone done over - since the surgeon generalâs report in 1964 -\n\nfrom 42 percent of adults to less than half of that under 20 percent. So we're\n\nmaking headways on less smoking but we're still at 20 percent of adults.\n\nThree things are proven to help encourage people to quit. Number one, high\n\nprices and so, the governments both state and federal are taxing cigarettes at\n\na very level and the prices have gone up. Itâs very price sensitive. The second\n\none is these fresh air or indoor air laws, now expanding I guess, to some\n\nsidewalks in New York. But that really has encouraged more people to quit\n\nbecause itâs kind of stigmatized smoking. And the third one is education and\n\nknowledge about the dangers of smoking.\n\nBut these new products that we're talking about, the snus and the orbs and the\n\nrest of it, are really directly a way around the indoor air laws thatâs been a\n\nvery important component of the quit smoking movement.\n\nDAVIES: What do the statistics tell us about how often smokers try to quit and\n\nhow likely they are to succeed?\n\nMr. WILSON: Nicotineâs really hard to quit. Itâs really hard to quit smoking\n\nespecially if you start young. The statistics say that a lot of people try,\n\nthough. Like 45 percent of smokers try every year â every 12 months. Almost\n\nhalf of smokers try to quit but only two and a half percent succeed per year.\n\nSo itâs very hard to quit and anything that can be done to help people quit,\n\nwhether itâs letâs say the carrot of a nicotine replacement product or the\n\nstick of a stigma in indoor smoking bans, you know, has encourage more people\n\nto quit.\n\nDAVIES: Only two and a half percent succeeding in quitting is a pretty striking\n\nnumber. Which raises a question about the, you know, the future of whether\n\nwe're really going to get people off of cigarettes. How does the public health\n\ncommunity view these smokeless products?\n\nMr. WILSON: Theyâre sharply divided over smokeless products and the so-called\n\nreduced harm products. Itâs the most divided or divisive issue in the public\n\nhealth community because a lot of scientists and doctors that have battled\n\nsmoking for decades say hey, these are much safer than cigarettes. Letâs\n\nencourage these reduced harm products. And others say indoor air laws, for\n\ninstance, are a good way to get people to quit smoking. And if you give them an\n\nalternative like a, you know, a pouch or a, you know, oral tobacco product\n\nduring the work day, then theyâll keep smoking outside of it.\n\nDAVIES: Now thereâs a major case that could be reviewed by the Supreme Court\n\ndealing with the industryâs marketing of so-called light cigarettes are\n\nhealthier. But thereâs a longstanding action by, I guess, the Justice\n\nDepartment, that they sued the tobacco companies for their past marketing of\n\nthis. So tell us what that case is about and what the stakes are.\n\nMr. WILSON: The Justice Department sued nine leading cigarette companies for\n\nracketeering, conspiracy, fraud, lying about the risk of cigarettes, lying\n\nabout marketing to kids, the whole nine yards. They sued all these companies in\n\nthe Clinton administration, I think. And then, a federal judge convicted the\n\ntobacco companies of racketeering for all that activity in 2006. She said some\n\nreally harsh things about the tobacco companyâs deceptive marketing and thatâs\n\nbeen on appeal. It was recently upheld by a court of appeals and now both the\n\ntobacco companies and the Department of Justice have appealed this case to the\n\nSupreme Court.\n\nThe tobacco companies want the racketeering conviction overturned. They donât\n\nwant to be called racketeers. The Department of Justice wants to have the power\n\nto force them to disgorge past profits, over $200 billion in past profits.\n\nThey're asking for the authority to force the cigarette companies to disgorge\n\nit because they were profits from an allegedly racketeering enterprise.\n\nDAVIES: Wow.\n\nMr. WILSON: So thereâs high stakes. The Supreme Court hasnât announced yet if\n\nitâll take the case, although that announcement may come within the next month\n\nor two.\n\nDAVIES: So this would be a criminal conviction of big tobacco?\n\nMr. WILSON: It is a conviction under the racketeering law thatâs mostly used\n\nfor organized crime figures. Yes. Itâs a criminal conviction and they can be\n\ncalled racketeers, which they donât like.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And when this happens to mob bosses they go to prison. No\n\ntobacco executives are going to be in the dark, are they?\n\nMr. WILSON: No. No. Thereâs no prison proposed here at all. It was mostly used\n\nas a way to get all this evidence into the public arena about the deceptive\n\nmarketing and the light cigarettes and then to convict them as corporations.\n\nThey're not being convicted as, you know, individual executives.\n\nDAVIES: Okay. So that is, the current rulings have upheld the racketeering\n\nconviction and the huge fine, and it may or may not be decided ultimately by\n\nthe Supreme Court.\n\nMr. WILSON: Yes. The latest appeals court ruling upheld that racketeering\n\nconviction. It may or may not be heard by the Supreme Court and while the\n\ncompanies are trying to reverse the racketeering conviction, the Department of\n\nJustice is trying to push it even harder than they did years ago and to force\n\nthem to give back over $200 billion in past profits.\n\nIf that happens somehow, it could bankrupt the companies, so business analysts\n\nthink that's very unlikely that the court would allow all the tobacco companies\n\nto be bankrupted and have to give back all their past profits, just from a\n\npractical view. Because a lot of this goes back to a practical consideration of\n\ndo we want to try to ban cigarettes or to have a prohibition on cigarettes? And\n\nthat didnât work very well with alcohol and few people want to actually do it\n\nwith cigarettes.\n\nYou know, youâve got tens of millions of addicted customers and they're going\n\nto find some way to satisfy that addiction whether itâs with a black market or\n\nlegally through convenient stores, like they do now.\n\nDAVIES: Well, I'm sure you'll be keeping track of it.

I'm just around. I am what I am. I do what I\n\ndo...\n\nKEN TUCKER: The relaxed, utterly confident twists in the phrasing Merle Haggard\n\nuses throughout his new album, âI Am What I Am,â proves that he is what he is,\n\na country-music star who takes great pleasure in Western swing, train songs and\n\nthe blues. He's made an album that's in his comfort zone for a 83-year-old, but\n\nhe's a senior citizen bringing fresh takes on old romantic themes. Two new\n\nsongs he's written frame the idea of love, both new and old.\n\n(Soundbite of song, âPretty When It's Newâ)\n\nMr. HAGGARD: (Singing) Loveâs always lovely when first two lovers meet. Hand in\n\nhand, arm in arm, walking down the street. Always seen together in everything\n\nthey do. Love is always pretty when itâs new.\n\nTUCKER: On that jaunty little shuffle called \"Pretty When It's New,\" Haggard\n\ngives us a wink of reality in the midst of a lovely reverie about the pleasure\n\nof a new love affair. There's nothing bad about it 'til your lover says we're\n\nthrough, he croons, letting the dance floor fall out from under you just as\n\nyou're ready to keep waltzing to that pretty rhythm. At the other end of the\n\nspectrum, Haggard creates a vision of what love is like when a lover never says\n\nit's through, and the years go by.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"We're Falling in Love Again\")\n\nMr. HAGGARD: (Singing) We're falling in love again after all these years. We're\n\nsmiling for real again after all these tears. Somehow life took its toll and\n\ncaused us to frown and the weight on our shoulders took us all the way down.\n\nBut the children are grown now...\n\nTUCKER: Thatâs a beautiful song on many levels. What's most immediately\n\nstriking is the gentle ache in Haggard's voice, the way he reaches for a higher\n\nnote in a manner that echoes the narrator reaching back into the history of the\n\nrelationship he's singing about. The lyric is shrewd as well. You're not quite\n\nsure whether the narrator is falling in love again with his wife because of\n\ndifficulties they've survived, or are simply entering a new cycle of closeness.\n\nThere's rock-solid craftsmanship behind this music. Haggard has written or co-\n\nwritten every song on the new album and it's striking the way he can come at\n\nfamiliar themes from different angles. A prime example of this is a song in\n\nwhich the ornery coot compares himself not to an outlaw or to a stubborn\n\ncowboy, but to a bad actor incapable of disguising his true feelings in the\n\nmoment.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Bad Actor\")\n\nMr. HAGGARD: (Singing) Iâve never been much at making believe. Donât have any\n\ntricks hidden up my sleeve. If life is a comedy whereâs all the laughter?\n\nâCause here on the stage I'm a bad actor. I donât know...\n\nTUCKER: On songs like \"Bad Actor\" and the title song I played at the start of\n\nthis review, Merle Haggard surrounds his gruff voice and delicate phrasing with\n\nacoustic guitar, piano and the gentlest of drums to create music that courses\n\nwith vitality. This is not the work of an old man basking in his past glories;\n\nit's the music of an artist who refuses to let you dismiss him as an old man -\n\nan artist whose time isn't even close to being up.\n\nGROSS: Ken Tucker is editor at large at Entertainment Weekly.
