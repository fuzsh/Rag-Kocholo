        "text": "Sarah Silverman has spoken out about the pressure on women to start a family.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress and comedian told Marc Moran on his podcast, WTF that she constantly receives questions about why she has never procreated, which she finds particularly hard to take.\n\n\"It's a sadness for me because I love kids. I ache for kids\" she said in the candid interview.\n\n\"But I love my life more.\n\n\"You can't have it all; you really can't.\"\n\nSilverman, who has been dating actor Michael Sheen since early 2014, has already discussed her desire not to have kids, however she claims other people are finding it hard to fathom.\n\n\"I'm 45 and I don't have kids and, you know, when you're a woman, I'm finding out... you get so much pressure\", she said.\n\n\"I got two emails within the span of a week, two weeks ago, from people in my life, who I don't necessarily know really well, who just out of nowhere said, 'You should really have kids' and, 'I've been thinking about you'.\"\n\n\"It's such an odd thing to put on someone.\"\n\nThe outspoken star, who stars in 2015 film I Smile Back as a depressed mother, said children would just not fit in with her life choices.\n\n\"I don't have the lifestyle conducive to having kids the way that I would want to have kids,\" she said.\n\n\"And I just made that choice. [But it's not like] that choice, I have no regrets, or no sadness about it.\""
