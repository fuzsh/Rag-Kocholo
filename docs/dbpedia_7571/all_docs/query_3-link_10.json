        "text": "Thank you for helping to make Jewish News the leading source of news and opinion for the UK Jewish community. Today we're asking for your invaluable help to continue putting our community first in everything we do.\n\nFor as little as £5 a month you can help sustain the vital work we do in celebrating and standing up for Jewish life in Britain.\n\nJewish News holds our community together and keeps us connected. Like a synagogue, it’s where people turn to feel part of something bigger. It also proudly shows the rest of Britain the vibrancy and rich culture of modern Jewish life.\n\nYou can make a quick and easy one-off or monthly contribution of £5, £10, £20 or any other sum you’re comfortable with.\n\n100% of your donation will help us continue celebrating our community, in all its dynamic diversity...\n\nEngaging\n\nBeing a community platform means so much more than producing a newspaper and website. One of our proudest roles is media partnering with our invaluable charities to amplify the outstanding work they do to help us all.\n\nCelebrating\n\nThere’s no shortage of oys in the world but Jewish News takes every opportunity to celebrate the joys too, through projects like Night of Heroes, 40 Under 40 and other compelling countdowns that make the community kvell with pride.\n\nPioneering\n\nIn the first collaboration between media outlets from different faiths, Jewish News worked with British Muslim TV and Church Times to produce a list of young activists leading the way on interfaith understanding.\n\nCampaigning\n\nRoyal Mail issued a stamp honouring Holocaust hero Sir Nicholas Winton after a Jewish News campaign attracted more than 100,000 backers. Jewish Newsalso produces special editions of the paper highlighting pressing issues including mental health and Holocaust remembrance.\n\nEasy access\n\nIn an age when news is readily accessible, Jewish News provides high-quality content free online and offline, removing any financial barriers to connecting people.\n\nVoice of our community to wider society\n\nThe Jewish News team regularly appears on TV, radio and on the pages of the national press to comment on stories about the Jewish community. Easy access to the paper on the streets of London also means Jewish News provides an invaluable window into the community for the country at large.\n\nWe hope you agree all this is worth preserving."
