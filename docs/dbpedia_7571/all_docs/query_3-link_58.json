        "text": "WASHINGTON — Former President Trump has made it abundantly clear that nobody else speaks for him.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Democrats from trying to tie Trump to a compilation of policy suggestions led by the conservative Heritage Foundation called Project 2025, even though Trump himself has repeatedly disavowed the document. The document has drawn outsized attention since some former Trump aides participated, including a civil rights lawyer who led the health section and focused mostly on aggressive abortion restrictions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut there may be more reliable indicators of Trump’s plans on health care policy. Former Trump White House economic adviser Theo Merkel, who’s now working on health policy at the right-leaning Paragon Health Institute and the Manhattan Institute, said there’s only one place to look for Trump’s policies: what actually comes out of the former president’s mouth."
