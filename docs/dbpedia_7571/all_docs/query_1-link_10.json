Silverman first rose to prominence for her brief stint as a writer and cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live during its 19th season between 1993 and 1994. She then starred in and produced The Sarah Silverman Program, which ran from 2007 to 2010 on Comedy Central. For her work on the program, Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nShe also acted television projects such as Mr. Show and V.I.P. and starred in films, including Who's the Caboose?

She released an autobiography The Bedwetter in 2010 which she adapted into an off-Broadway musical in 2022.\n\nHer comedy roles address social taboos and controversial topics, including racism, sexism, homophobia, politics, and religion, sometimes having her comic character endorse them in a satirical or deadpan fashion. During the 2016 United States presidential election, she became increasingly politically active; she initially campaigned for Bernie Sanders but later spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She hosted the Hulu late-night talk show I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman from 2017 until late 2018.\n\nShe was also impersonated by then-cast member Melissa Villase√±or on the October 1, 2016 episode, which is the Season 42 premiere, hosted by Australian actress Margot Robbie, with musical guest The Weeknd, during the \"Family Feud\" sketch.\n\nVoice acting career[]\n\nHer early voice roles notable from her infamous role Melody Stardust from the show Tom and Jerry Kids spin-off series Droopy: Master Detective, Dr. Katz, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Futurama, The Simpsons, American Dad, Drawn Together, Crank Yankers, Out There, Bob's Burgers, Nutri Ventures, Santa Inc.\n\nImpressions[]\n\nCher\n\nJoan Rivers\n\nLaura Leighton\n\nMarisa Tomei\n\nNatalie Merchant\n\nSNL Career[]\n\n1993-1994: Featured Player\n\nOctober 4, 2014: Host"
