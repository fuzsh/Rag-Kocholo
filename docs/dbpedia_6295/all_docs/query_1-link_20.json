        "text": "Mountain biking\n\nWomen’s Cross-Country: Sun 28 July\n\nMen’s Cross-Country: Mon 29 July\n\nA fusion of speed, stamina, strength and skill, Cross-Country MTB is the only mountain biking discipline with Olympic status.\n\nIt sees punchy riders such as Tom Pidcock scrap over laps of a 4.3km course packed with forests, gravel, rocks, jumps and climbs.\n\n“For mountain bikers, the Olympics is the big one,” insists three-time Cross-Country MTB Olympian and commentator Oli Beckingsale (bwcycling.co.uk).\n\n“If you medal, it is a life-changing experience. I did three Games, starting with Sydney 2000, and it’s just mind-blowing to be part of that big circus.”\n\nThe Paris course is on the site of an old sandstone quarry at Élancourt Hill: at 230m, it’s the highest point in the Paris region.\n\nFrench rider Loana Lecomte, who won the test event, says it is a “beautiful circuit” that encourages “real mountain biking\".\n\nRaces usually last one to two hours. “It is a mass start, with six to seven laps of a circuit with hard climbing and technical elements,” explains Beckingsale.\n\n“Whereas a road race starts steady and builds, this is intense from the start, like a cyclocross race, with everyone jockeying for position.\n\n“There is a mix of wide and narrow track, so if you are too far back on the narrow track before a technical section, you risk losing time.\n\n“There is usually a lead group of five to 10 riders and then attacks from that. We will see fast, close racing. We will get seconds, not minutes, between riders, so really full-on.”\n\nTom Pidcock is hoping to repeat his Tokyo 2020 gold. “Pidcock has punch on climbs, but he is one of the most technically adept riders too,” says Beckingsale.\n\n“A course with a tougher ascent may favour Tom more,” admits Park. “At the recent World Cup race (in Nové Město, Czech Republic), he dominated.”\n\nCompetition will come from New Zealander Sam Gaze, Nino Schurter (Switzerland) and Victor Koretzky (France).\n\nBritain’s Evie Richards will be hunting a medal in the women’s race. “Evie had a concussion recently, but I am confident she will come back strong,” says Park.\n\n“As well as winning the World Championships in 2021, she has been a regular podium visitor at World Cup level.”\n\nHome favourite Pauline Ferrand-Prévot is chasing a first Olympic gold to add to her glittering career.\n\nOther rivals include fellow Frenchwoman Loana Lecomte, and 22-year-old rising star Puck Pieterse of the Netherlands.\n\nBMX racing and freestyle\n\nBMX Freestyle: Tue 30 Jul – Wed 31 Jul\n\nBMX Racing: Thu 1 Aug – Fri 2 Aug\n\nBMX Racing\n\nThis is an explosive, exciting discipline that will leave gravity-grounded road cyclists gawping with delight.\n\nThe sport is split into BMX racing and BMX freestyle events, with both competitions hosted at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines BMX Stadium.\n\nAfter launching out of a gate on top of an 8m-high start hill, riders race around a 400m track festooned with jumps, banked corners and obstacles.\n\n“It’s similar to road racing, but you’re flying in the air,” explains BMX rider Jon Taylor, who commentates for the BBC.\n\n“Riders travel at big speeds of 30mph and clear 30ft jumps. Imagine going down a hill on a road bike and someone pulls out a jump the size of a double-decker bus!”\n\nBMX Freestyle\n\nFreestyle is a hazardous world of stunts, akin to gymnastics on a bike.\n\nOn a park course, riders perform as many tricks as possible in 60 seconds, scoring points for the complexity of their stunts, height and style.\n\n“It looks dangerous, but every rider is thinking: how can I ride this course better than everyone else?” says Taylor.\n\n“They will often save the best tricks for the final. Sometimes, they fly backwards on jumps, so they are totally blind until they spot their landing.”\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, Charlotte Worthington stormed to acrobatic gold in the women’s freestyle, while Bethany Shriever took gold and Kye Whyte took silver in the BMX racing.\n\n“To live that experience was phenomenal,” recalls Taylor. “Charlotte Worthington’s\n\n360 backflip was on the cover of every newspaper.”\n\nThe confidence of BMX riders is staggering. “There’s a continual challenge to learn new tricks, and that brings to the forefront higher degrees of danger and degrees of mental fortitude,” explains Park."
