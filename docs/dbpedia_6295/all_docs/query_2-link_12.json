EDITORS’ FOREWORD In this volume , “ Science and Scientists in the Netherlands Indies,” we have endeavoured to presence picture of the development and status of a number of branches of the natural sciences , pure and applied , in the Nether- lands Indies. The period during which this volume was prepared has been darkened by the military occupation of both the Indies and the mother coun- try . This circumstance made it impossible to obtain the degree of collabora- tion necessary for a really complete history of science in the Netherlands Indies . The present work consists of: 1) Original articles, prepared especially for this volume , dealing with the development or status of various branches of science in the Netherlands Indies. 2) Reprints of similar accounts previously published elsewhere , several of which originally appeared in Dutch and are now being made available in English. 3 ) A number of travel accounts and impressions by distinguished visitors in the past, often offering delightful glimpses {scientific and otherwise ) of life and nature in the Nether- lands Indies. 4 ) A number of shorter articles — notes, biographical sketches, reviews, etc. (“ Serta Malesiana ”) — comprising material often of interest from the viewpoint of the promo- tion of North American - Netherlands Indies relationships. 5 ) A list of scientific institutions , societies, and workers in the Netherlands Indies at the time of the Japanese invasion. Although this volume offers much less than might be expected from a complete history , it nevertheless presents certain information which would not ordinarily be contained in such a work . It is hoped that our effort will be of use and interest to visiting civilians and members of the armed forces of North America, Great Britain, and other countries; many of these visitors are now receiving their first impressions of the Malaysian archi- pelago, hitherto a strange and distant land for most of them. Dr. George Sarton, reviewing Vlekke’s Nusantara {Isis 35. 77, IQ44) declared: 11 My only regret is that the students of natural history are neglected. Rumphius, one of the greatest heroes of the East Indies, is dismissed in a few words; other naturalists are disposed of in a footnote ; the history of the famous garden of Buitenzorg is not told, etc. It is true the author refers to Chris- tiaan Eijkman, the pioneer of vitamin research, but that is not enough. The scientific exploration of the East Indies is not explained as it should be and thus some of the brightest pages of Dutch history are left out ” Although this volume is published by the Government of the Netherlands Indies, it aims to be much more than a government-inspired effort in a critical period. The editors have made every attempt to keep the work free of narrow political considerations, and laudatory statements concerning Dutch policies in the past have often been removed from the text . On the other hand, the editors believe that in the modern world science and govern- ment can not be kept entirely separate, and many chapters report on the relations between the two, which were perhaps closer in the Netherlands Indies than in many other parts of the world. The history of science in the Netherlands Indies during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is a remarkable illustration of international cooperation in science . Scientists of numerous nationalities came to the Indies to study for a longer or a shorter time , or to settle down and make a career. Until about IQ30 the Netherlands Indies were free of any narrow nationalistic concepts, and there was never any discrimination against foreign research workers nor any prejudice against the free expression of international cooperation; the Dutch have held and always will hold with Albert Verwey’s words , “De wetenschap heeft geen gevaarlijker vijand dan de aanmatiging van een exclusief nationalisme.” At the end of this volume a list of research workers in the Netherlands Indies at the time of the Japanese invasion is given. Their number may seem impressive ( even though our list includes fewer routine workers than certain other lists of this type); however , it should be realized that the number of workers engaged in research in the strictest sense of the word has never exceeded a few hundred. The achievements of this small group are due to the fact that the majority of them had studied abroad and had been selected with unusual care. The scientists, of many different nationalities , who came to the Nether- lands Indies had varying educational backgrounds. Without doubt this diversity has exercised a stimulating influence , resulting in greater origin- ality and initiative than would have been found in a group of individuals of less diverse backgrounds and origin. As a result of such various back- grounds, close ties were developed between scientists and research institutions in the Netherlands Indies and those of other parts of the world; these ties have been of the greatest benefit to us. Scientific research has contributed substantially to the development of the Netherlands Indies , as the senior editor has shown in more detail in an article in Nature (151: 242-244 , 1943). Many examples of this contribu- tion are given in the present volume , the influence of research having been especially noteworthy in the fields of public health , estate agriculture , and applied geology. Agricultural research has for the greater part been carried on through private institutions , but these institutions have devoted much of their effort to basic research. The findings of experiment stations have been quickly applied to estate agriculture in the East Indies; a close and well organized cooperation between research and practice has been of tremendous importance to all concerned. The experiment stations , in addition to their numerous purely scientific and technical publications , organized extension and information services which issued less technical bulletins and leaflets. These services actively codperaied with various societies of plantation workers , often helping in the preparation of programmes of meetings and conventions. There has always been an unusual interest among plantation employees and other European workers , even among those without college training , in the scien- tific periodicals published in the Netherlands Indies ( cf . p. 464). A large percentage of the circulation of these periodicals was among the quarter- million Europeans living in the Netherlands Indies . At the time of the Japanese invasion , 19 journals or serials devoted to agriculture and related subjects were issued , 4 devoted to medicine and pharmacy , 2 to veterinary science and practice, and 7 to general science. There was also a number of engineering journals, one of them divided into several sections. These figures show that the occidentals in the East Indies , especially those engaged in the fields of agriculture, public health , and industry , had a great interest in their profession and its advances. Almost every employee of a western enterprise subscribed to one or two technical journals in his field. Consequent to this interest , the research workers in the Netherlands Indies received a strong stimulus , and most of them had a definite feeling (which we do not find everywhere ) that their work was really bearing fruit. The natural sciences are , without doubt , essential to the cultural and material development of a country. It should be recognized that the scien- tific work referred to above and in the following pages is based for the greater part on the methods and results of 11 western science” This kind of work and research may often seem alien to the East , and to some it may seem somewhat arbitrarily transplanted to oriental surroundings , but never- theless it has been of great benefit to the people of the Malaysian islands. At the present time , when the right of peoples to self-government is being so much discussed , we may be permitted to ask whether scientific studies should be pursued in the same way as in the past — in a part of the world where nature and custom do not inevitably impel the rational recognition and application of facts established by the pure and applied sciences. To the implied question — namely , whether or not the occidental has the right and duty to continue his work as in the past — this book may offer a partial reply. Only modern research can answer today's demand for a higher level of material well-being, for “freedom from want,” that now basic governmental principle in every country where living standards are diverse. Only modern research seems able to help eradicate the poverty and privation among large groups of the population in many countries — a poverty and privation which would seem fundamentally unnecessary in this twentieth century. Science and its exponents will doubtless continue to have a great mission in the Far East . We hope that there may be, among readers of this volume, some who will feel drawn toward the Malaysian islands , some who will feel that they have a training and knowledge which can be used therefor the good of man- kind. We also trust, and confidently , that the spirit of humanism and honest internationalism, unhampered by prejudices of race, creed , or personality, will guide the future of science and its applications in the Netherlands Indies.

Mrs. J. A. C. Fagginger Auer (Belmont, Mass.), Dr. Lily M. Perry (Arnold Arboretum of Harvard Uni- versity) and Dr. D. J. Struik (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) translated several of the articles in this volume. Most of the proofs were faithfully read and checked by Mrs. F. Verdoorn, Phil. nat. dra. f Associate Editor of Chronica Botanica, assisted by Miss Lola E. Wilson and K. Walter Baron, Bibliographer of Chronica Botanica. In addition to the numerous correspondents in the United States, Great Britain and Australia who helped us with the preparation of the address lists ( cf . p. 425) we should like to extend sincere thanks for their dis- interested help in the planning and editing of this volume to: Alexander L. ter Braake, Min. Eng. (Tin Processing Corporation), Dr. F. E. Brasch (Library of Congress), Dr. Jan O. M. Broek (University of California), Mr. James F. Engers (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Mrs. C. de Groot (Central Depository Library for the Netherlands Indies), Mrs. Natalie Gurney (Southeast Asia Institute), the late Mr. G. H. C. Hart (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Dr. R. von Heine-Geldern (Southeast Asia Institute), Dr. A. W. C. T. Herre (Stanford University), Dr. B. Landheer (Netherlands Information Bureau), Dr. J. Maas (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Dr, Elmer D. Merrill (Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University), Dr. Ernst Mayr (American Museum of Natural History), Dr. E. H. Myers (Hopkins Marine Station), Dr. Horace I. Poleman (Library of Congress), Dr. G. Sarton (Harvard University), the late Mr. P. H. Sitsen (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Dr. A. C. Smith (Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University), Dr. I. Snapper (Mount Sinai Hospital), Dr. H. Stauffer (Stanford University), Mr. Norman Taylor (Cinchona Institute), Dr. T. A. Tengwall (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Dr. S. van Valkenburg (Clark University), Dr. F. H. Visman (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao), Lt. Anthony de Vos (Royal Netherlands Air Force), Dr. F, W. Went (California Institute of Technology), and Dr. J. H. Westermann (Government of the Netherlands Indies) The endpapers have been designed by Dr. Erwin Raisz of the Institute of Geographical Exploration of Harvard University. The vig- nettes of Malaysian animals have been drawn by Lieutenant Anthony de Vos and are being re- produced by the kind permission of the Editor of Nature Magazine. The Netherlands Information Bureau of New York City has been very helpful in supplying us with suitable illustrations. Many of the older prints which we have reproduced have been taken from material kindly lent by the Library of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. This library has a unique collection of Malaysian literature and has often been con- sulted in the course of the preparation of this volume. A number of the articles in this volume have previously been published elsewhere. Some were originally pub- lished in Dutch and have now been translated into English {cf. p. vii). In certain cases the English of articles previously published in Netherlands or Netherlands Indies periodicals has been improved somewhat, but only insofar as the un- written rules of bibliography permit. The spelling of scientific (plant and animal) names has been corrected in several instances but in the case of literatim reprints we have, of course, not tried to bring 4 ‘old-fashioned” names in conformity with today’s rules of scientific nomenclature. Place names have, as a rule, also been left in the form in which they were given in the original publications. In most cases the typographical style of material which has appeared in print before has been made uniform with that followed in the present volume; in a few cases, however, we felt that it was better to retain the style of the original publication.

H., 279, 417 ON LIVESTOCK AND THE VETERINARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS INDIES bv S. Barker, Vet.D.* Govt.. Veterinary Service, Batavia According to the Annual Report of the Nether- lands Indies Veterinary Service, the livestock at the end of 1937 consisted of: 671,362 horses, 4,413,606 oxen, and 3,197,354 buffaloes — in all 8,282,322 animals. This total of over eight and a quarter million does not convey much, for in order to obtain a correct view of a country’s actual wealth in this respect it is necessary to take into consideration the extent of its area and the density of its popu- lation. It would therefore be wrong to conclude from this number that the Dutch East Indies are richer in cattle than, for example, the mother country, because the latter’s stock comprises only about two and a half million head. To ascertain the relative wealth in livestock we must calculate separately the number of ani- mals per sq. km. for each of these countries, and then we shall see that in Holland there is an average of seventy head per sq. km. and in the Netherlands Indies 4.3. Seventy-five per cent of the livestock in the Netherlands Indies is found in Java, Madura, Bali and Lombok, where the relative density is 43 head per sq. km., which means that these places are not far behind Germany, Uruguay, Great Britain and Ireland. The Netherlands East Indies as a whole can in this respect be likened to Brazil and Japan, but they are far behind Holland. Comparing livestock figures with the number of inhabitants, the Netherlands Indies show that for every one hundred inhabitants there are seventeen head of cattle, but notwithstanding the greater wealth of cattle in Java, Madura, Bali and Lombok, this figure increases to only 17.4 for these places on account of their greater population density. In the Netherlands this figure is 33.25. According to this calculation the Netherlands Indies equals Italy. It com- pares favourably with China and Japan, but is in a position inferior to that of other Asiatic coun- * Reprinted from the Bull, of the Colon. Inst, of Amsterdam 2:193-202 (1939). tries, such as Siam, India and Ceylon. It may be said that as a rule the number of animals per sq. km. increases in proportion to the density of population. In the Dutch East Indies this is shown by the fact that 75% of the livestock is found in Java, Madura, Bali and Lombok — the most populated parts, while in Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo and the Timor Archipelago, where the population is scarce, there is only 25% of the total stock. Exceptions to the above rule are Japan, with a crowded population and few cattle, and Uruguay, where the opposite is the case. The value of the stock to the inhabitants can- not easily be reckoned in guilders, as to a native a guilder has a value totally different from that which it has to a Hollander. The cost of main- tenance for a native agriculturalist with a wife and two children may be reckoned at twenty- five cents per day, which means that such a household can live for four days on one guilder. Taking the income of a Netherlands farmer with a similar family at twenty-one guilders per week, then one guilder is sufficient to keep him for only a third of a day. Estimating the average value of cattle in the Netherlands Indies at twenty guilders per head, and in the Netherlands at two hundred, we see that the selling price of such an animal in the Indies is sufficient to keep a farmer’s family for eighty days, while in the Netherlands the sale price is equal to subsistence for only about sixty-six days. It therefore fol- lows that, although the average price of an ox in money is much lower in the Indies than in the Netherlands, this animal is of relatively greater value there economically. Dr. J. Merkens, Director of the Netherlands Indies Veterinary School at Buitenzorg, uses another standard to compute the worth of animals to the native. He expresses their value in working days, and taking the present price at an average of twenty guilders apiece, this represents for an adult native earning fifteen cents per day no less than one hundred and thirty-three working days. 1 Barker: On Livestock and the Veterinary Service 2 Although the application of these and similar computations is, naturally, unstable owing to the fact that the various parts of the equations used may widely vary, independently from the others, with the rise and fall of prices and values, enough has been said to prove that cattle in the Nether- lands Indies may be regarded as of considerable value. This is also brought out clearly by the words rojo koyo , “basis of prosperity” — an ex- pression much employed by the population of East and Central Java to designate cattle. As mentioned previously, the livestock is unequally distributed over the Archipelago. In Java and Madura its density increases from West to East, except in the case of buffaloes, which are more numerous in the West. The fol- lowing table proves this: ions differ as to the significance of these sports in helping to improve the stock, but on the whole not much importance is attached to this question. Dairy farming has not yet reached the Eu- ropean standard. Dairy stock is to a great ex- tent in European and Chinese hands and, except here and there, is not intensively exploited. The principal reason for this is that a dairy farming class such as we have in Europe does not exist in the Indies. The owners of cows lack both train- ing and experience, and therefore are not expert as dairy farmers. That the dairy stock is im- proving, however, both in quantity and quality, can be seen from the fact that within the last twenty years it has increased sixfold, while milk production has risen from about four million litres in 1908 to twenty-six million in 1936. The Horses Oxen Buffaloes Total West Java 65.212 86,069 862,052 1,013,333 Central Java , including Surakarta and Jogjakarta 67,808 952,893 782,841 1,803,542 East Java, including Madura 87,896 2,498,144 370,878 2,956,918 If we leave Central and East Java out of con- sideration, the greater part of the stock of oxen is in Bali, which has 208,301 head of cattle, and Lombok, which has 105,702. Over fifty per cent of the total number of horses is found in the Residency of Timor and in Celebes, while buf- faloes are more equally distributed, being most numerous where the population is most dense. The uses to which native cattle are put are many. Horses are employed for riding, driving and car- rying (pack horses), and some few are butchered, but, contrary to the European custom, they are practically never used for work on the land. Owing to the increase of motor transport they are much less in request than formerly, although they are still in demand in the more primitive regions. Horse-breeding is mostly carried on in the Timor Archipelago, where the animals are allowed to grow up in a half wild state; numbers of them are purchased by Arab dealers who send them to the big towns in Java where, after being broken in, they are put to the above-mentioned uses. During 1937, 11,683 horses were exported from Timor. Oxen and buffaloes are mainly employed by the natives for agriculture and transport, and their manure is a valuable asset. About ten per cent are destined for slaughtering purposes. In Lombok, in the Timor Residency and in some other parts of the Islands where the inhabitants have not yet acquired the habit of using the plough, the soil is prepared by chasing buffaloes over the inundated paddy fields (sawahs). In regions where gula mankok (or “cup sugar,” a kind of native Javanese sugar) is manufactured, these large beasts are sometimes employed to turn the sugar cane mills. In more primitive regions, such as Sumbawa, buffaloes are still used as beasts of burden. In Madura and in the Madurese parts of East Java, the popular sport of kerapan t bull racing, is cultivated, while in Sumbawa buffalo races are in vogue. Another favourite sport, also of Madurese origin, is adoean t sapi — bull fighting. As with horse- racing in other parts of the world, betting on a large scale takes place in this connection and prizes of considerable value are awarded. Opin- annual sale value of fresh milk may be estimated at about four million guilders. These figures are small in comparison with those of the Nether- lands; but in studying them we must not lose sight of the fact that the native population con- sumes practically no milk, the sale of which is principally confined to Europeans and, to a lesser degree, to Chinese living in the large towns. A small quantity is used in preparing other dairy products. There is certainly an opportunity here for enlarging the dairy farming industry. The above description shows the position oc» cupied by livestock in native economy, and we think it may now prove of interest to give the reader some particulars about the Veterinary Service, its personnel and its work. Veterinarians may be divided into four cate- gories: a. Veterinary surgeons in Government service and their assistants. Considering the expanse of the Netherlands Indies, the staff cannot be called very large. It consists of: The Head of the civil veterinary service, five Inspectors and thirty-two districts surgeons. As assistants there are fifty-eight Indonesian vet- erinary surgeons and two hundred and twenty- six cattle overseers. Government veterinary surgeons are educated professionally in the Netherlands at the Veteri- nary Department of Utrecht University. The University course lasts five and a half years and has gradually become so comprehensive that specialization is increasingly necessary. These veterinary surgeons are appointed district chiefs; from their number the Inspectors are selected and the Head of the Service is chosen from among the latter. To this category belong the bacteriologists, who are attached to the Netherlands Indian Veterinary Institute which is situated at Buiten- zorg, Java. Their training is the same as that of the Government veterinary surgeons, but in ad- dition they take a special course in bacteriology. Their assistants are Indonesian veterinary sur- geons who in time will also become bacteriologists. m Their task consists of making serums and vac- cines, and preparations such as tuberculin and 3 Barker: On Livestock and the Veterinary Service mallein, in order to facilitate the diagnosis of various infectious cattle diseases. Further, they are entrusted with the examination of specimens of diseased substances sent to them, and the testing of various medicines for curing cattle diseases indigenous to the Netherlands Indies. Indonesian veterinary surgeons study for four years at the Netherlands Indies Veterinary School at Buitenzorg, and after that they are attached to a district veterinary surgeon. The best of them may act as deputy district chiefs. The training of a cattle overseer consists of practice under a Government or native veterinarian, or he may follow an eight months’ course at the Veterinary School. His duty is to see that the veterinary rules and regulations are observed, and in gen- eral to execute the orders of Government and Indonesian veterinary surgeons. b . Veterinary . surgeons employed by the municipal councils, and their assistants, com- prising Indonesian veterinary surgeons, over- seers, meat inspectors, etc. The number of these municipal veterinary surgeons is twenty-three, and their work, which is specialized and. mostly connected with public hygiene, is done independently, except that ad- ministratively they are subject to the municipal council. Larger municipalities employ fully qualified veterinary surgeons with Indonesian veterinarians as assistants. In small towns this service is in the hands of Indonesian veterinary surgeons. c. Veterinary surgeons for the Army — nine in number. They are trained at the Veterinary Department of the University of Utrecht and sent out from the Netherlands as first lieutenants. The Chief of this service holds the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. . d. Private veterinary surgeons — usually re- tired Government veterinary surgeons or Indo- nesian veterinarians. There are fourteen of these veterinary surgeons in private practice in the Netherlands Indies. The number is small compared to that of their compeers in the Netherlands, where there are several hundred. The reason for this is that there is no country practice for them in the Indies. Besides being too little acquainted with Western veterinary customs, native farmers have no money to spare to call in an expert to attend their animals.. If a native requires practical help to cure a sick beast, he goes to a dukun (native healer), who usually proceeds to treat the animal by means of amulets or charms, or by administer- ing herbal . extracts. For such assistance the dukun receives a very small sum of money or payment in kind in the form of rice, fruit, clothes, and the. like. Owing to these primitive condi- tions private veterinary Surgeons are found only in the big towns, where they make a living by treating domestic animals belonging to Eu- ropeans, Chinese and wealthy natives. On the east coast of Sumatra some of the large planta- tions have their own veterinarians to take care of the livestock, which they keep on the estates. The Staff of the Veterinary Institute already mentioned consists of a Director, three bacteri- ologists, . four Indonesian veterinary surgeons, and various other employees. The Veterinary School has a Director, three instructors, two assistant instructors (Indonesian veterinarians) besides other employees. The veterinary service’s work comprises com- bating infectious cattle diseases and rabies amongst dogs, cats and monkeys; preventing the spread of these diseases by animals transported overseas (quarantine, isolation and similar measures); improvement of cattle and poultry breeding; hygiene; scientific research; prepara- tion of serums and vaccines; the training of native surgeons and other persons connected with the Service. Originally the latter was centralized, which meant that veterinary sur- geons worked under an Inspector who was the head of, on an average, seven of them. The Inspector himself was subordinate to the Chief of the Service who, subject to the authority of the Director of Economic Affairs, was entrusted with the general direction. Administratively the veterinary surgeons were responsible to the Resident under whose jurisdiction they worked. When, in the Government reorganization of 1928-30, the Provinces of West, East and Cen- tral Java were brought into existence, together with provincial and district councils, the con- nection between the Central Department and the Inspectors became looser. These latter were given the title of Chief of the provincial veteri- nary service and each assigned a Province; the veterinary surgeons, bearing the title of pro- vincial or district veterinary surgeons while in office in the Province, were given charge of dis- tricts. Their salaries and expenses were now paid by the Province. The Province of East Java was divided into seven districts, Central Java into six, and West Java into five. Each veterinary surgeon still had the usual staff of assistants. On account of this reorganization part of the Government’s vet- erinary task was decentralized and transferred to these autonomous authorities. This part comprised local cattle breeding, hygiene and training of overseers and meat inspectors. A share of the activities in combating cattle dis- eases was also transferred to the provincial au- thorities. The part of the Government’s duty not trans- ferred was that referring to measures relating to more than one autonomous region. For in- stance, cattle breeding in general; animal hy- giene; prevention of infectious diseases and the spread thereof by animals transported overseas; education of Indonesian veterinary surgeons and others connected with the work; preparation of serums and vaccines, and scientific research at the Veterinary Institute. This combined method of working, whereby the Central De- partment deals with general questions and the provinces, districts and municipalities are en- trusted with the local application of these meas- ures, is satisfactory. For instance, with regard to cattle raising, provinces and districts have an opportunity of buying suitable stock for breed- ing purposes, establishing cattle unions and funds, and making rules and regulations likely to prove beneficial locally. It stands to reason that provincial and district bodies acquainted with local usage and customs are better able than the Central Department to judge which breeds of cattle are most in demand with the population, where such breeds, when purchased, can be placed, to the best advantage, and the special conditions under which the animals should be put at the breeder’s disposal and looked after generally. As mentioned above, general decisions as to cattle rearing and breeding . remain with the Central Department authorities, who have the Barker: On Livestock and the Veterinary Service 4 power to regulate the import of pedigree cattle from countries outside the Netherlands Indies and to determine how such animals shall be disposed of. This prevents the Inspectors from acting on their own initiative and making pro- posals to their provincial governments about the import and introduction of breeds which might disturb previous, long-established breeding meth- ods, and thus break the much-valued uniformity obtained by continual crossing with special breeds. When, however, as a result of consulta- tions between the Central and autonomous au- thorities, a special breed for the improvement of the livestock is once chosen, then the local bodies are free to act independently. The Central Department deals not only with the import and distribution of foreign breeding stock, but also with the placing of such animals indigenous to the Netherlands Indies. For in- stance, there is the well-known depot on the island of Sumba, whence comes a great part of the country’s breeding stock, the ongole cattle. The amount of stock available there and the fact that more than one autonomous region has to be supplied must be taken into account, and there- fore applications for these animals are always dealt with by the Central Department. With regard to animal hygiene, local duties consist of making regulations; establishing slaughter-houses; supervising the inspection of milk and meat; inspection of dairies, and meat stalls, establishments for the hire of carts and carriages, and piggeries. This work has been transferred to the municipal and regency councils. The provincial administrations are not directly responsible for the activities but in cases where smaller councils have no veterinary help, the provincial authorities may instruct their ex- perts to perform such local tasks on payment of a certain fee. The Central Department takes the lead with regard to veterinary hygiene too, but this merely means that the general regulations made by Government ordinance must be observed by the local authorities when making their own regula- tions. Animal hygiene is more decentralized than cattle breeding. The training of persons below the rank of Government veterinary surgeon is another of the Central Department’s duties which have been partly decentralized. Training of Indonesian vet- erinary surgeons remains with the Veterinary School, and although it is the local authorities’ business to see to the training of cattle overseers and inspectors of cattle and meat, the latter can also be educated at the school, which is naturally preferable, as this institution was established for this particular purpose and has special teachers. The task of combating cattle diseases, which comprises, of course, the making of local regula- tions for that purpose, has also been transferred to the local districts. For instance, the province of East Java has a regulation for optional pre- ventive measures against tuberculosis in milch cow's. As such regulations very often involve questions of far-reaching intervention in native affairs, they can be enforced only after approval by the Governor-General. Local funds provide money for indemnity payments for animals that have to be killed, for curative medicines and prophylactics against various infectious cattle diseases, and also for combating rabies. General regulations for the prevention of cattle diseases are made by the Central authorities. These are promulgated by ordinance, Govern- ment decrees or by decisions of the Director of Economics. There has been no question of transferring authority to local governments regarding the prevention of infectious cattle diseases and rabies amongst dogs, cats and monkeys by such ani- mals being transported overseas. This power has been reserved by the Central Service because of its access to the most up-to-date information on infectious cattle diseases in foreign countries and its knowledge of the dangers involved in the import of animals therefrom. These quarantine regulations might interfere with international trade and shipping interests, and therefore it stands to reason that the execution of such regu- lations cannot be transferred to the autonomous regions. Finally, decentralization has not been limited to Java and Madura, but in 1937 was also intro- duced in the Outer Provinces. On July 1st, 1938, tw r o group communities were established, one in Minangkabau on the west coast of Sumatra and the other in Bandjar, comprising the South and Eastern Division of Borneo. In both of these, as in the Java Provinces, government and Indonesian veterinary surgeons, under the super- vision of an Inspector, are placed at the disposal of the authorities administering the government in these areas. The Government intends to in- crease the number of this kind of administrative unit. ON THE MINERAL RESOURCES OF THE NETHERLANDS INDIES AND THEIR INDUSTRIAL POSSIBILITIES by R. W. van Bemmelen, Ph.D.* Chief , Volcanological Survey , Dept, of Mines , Bandoeng translated by Mrs. J. A. C. Fagginger Auer Belmont , Massachusetts In times of great economic and industrial changes, it is necessary to consider the natural causes that underly innovations. The Netherlands East Indies find themselves in a situation that necessitates their obtaining from other countries a large number of industrial products formerly imported from Europe. Naturally, this need raises the question: To what extent is it possible to provide at least a few of these products by the development of home in- dustries? This question, raised after the last war, 1 now, under new circumstances, presents itself with increased urgency. The desirability — in fact, the necessity — of a gradual industrialization of Java particu- larly is, therefore, generally admitted. valued at 362,865,000 guilders; the islands of the Netherlands Archipelago (exclusive of Java) 977,816 tons valued at 166,008,000 guilders, making a total of 2,124,227 tons valued at 528,- 873,000 guilders. These imports fall into two categories: — I. Commodities mainly of organic origin (animals and plants, food and table luxuries, animal and vegetable prod- ucts, wood, cork, weaving material, furniture, hides, leather and leather products, yarns and dry goods, cordage, paper, and articles made of paper, etc.). II. Commodities mainly of mineral origin (minerals, chemical products, china and porcelain, glass and articles made of glass, metal of every variety, carriages, vehicles, ships, instruments, apparatus, tools). A light industry, manufacturing articles of the first group, can surely be developed in the Nether - Import of Group II in 1939 Weight in Tons Value in Guilders Java and Madoera Outer Possessions Java and Madoera Outer Possessions Minerals 253,964 195,125 6,503,000 6,131,000 Chemical products etc. 181,798 69,692 37,925,000 11,517,000 Ceramic and porcelain 23,780 14,184 2,490,000 1,281,000 Glass and articles made from glass 17,700 5,650 3,590,000 1,201,000 Metals but not gold and silver 177,050 131,419 32,973,000 26,221,000 Vehicles, carriages, craft 15,868 5,989 28,557,000 4,645,000 Machines, implements, appliances, tools 30,503 27,155 37,828,000 23,529,000 Total 700,666 449,214 149,866,000 74,525,000 General total 1,149,880 224,391,000 The question of the extent to which importa- tion can be replaced by home production raises a comprehensive problem in which, besides technical matters, economic, social, and political considerations have a part. In the following pages, certain aspects of the question, especially those connected with the providing of minerals, will be discussed. Statistics show that importations into the Netherlands East Indies during 1939 were as follows: Java and Madoera, 1,146,411 tons * Based on the author’s “Delfstoffen van Nederlandsch IndiS als Grondstoffen der inheemsche Industrie” (Na- tuurwet. Tijdschrift voor Ned. Indie 101:11-19, 1941). — Grateful acknowledgment is made of the assistance rendered by Dr. J. Maas (Board for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curacao) in making this account ready for press. 1 The plans which were worked out during and shortly following the First World War and which have to some ex- tent materialized include the following: the exploitation of water power in the Outer Possessions for a nitrogen plant (Assahan River in Sumatra and Mamasa River in Celebes), the manufacturing of glass (Sumatra’s east coast), the cement industry in Java (Proepoek, Tjibadak), ceramics (Kediri, Malang), acetic add factory (Tjilatjap), iodine factory (Gedangan), asphalt industry of the munidpality lands East Indies. However, the supplying of raw materials for these products is chiefly an agrarian problem and therefore requires no fur- ther consideration at this point. In 1939, the importation of articles of the second group was as follows: 1,149,880 tons or 54.1 per cent of the total weight, valued at 224,- 391,000 guilders or 42.3 per cent of the total value of all imports, as shown in the above table. Domestic mineral raw materials have a very of Cheribonat Palimanan (Cheribon), India rubber factory (Bandoeng), Insulinde oil factories, factory for railroad material (Cheribon), blast furnaces (Lampongs), cannery (Bandoeng) , a number of factories for building materials, and a factory for making fireproof brick, N.I.C.K.I. (Rembang). Most of these plans did not materialize or the industries failed during the crisis of 1921-1923. In many instances, one of the main reasons for these failures was the lack of suffident preparatory study to determine the actual presence of raw material, the quantity in which it was present, and its usefulness for industrial purposes. From these experiences of twenty years ago, the lesson to be learned is this: before everything else, study the available quantity, quality, and position of the raw material. van Remmelen: Mineral Resources and their Industrial Possibilities 6 significant connection with the plans to develop industries producing articles belonging to the second group. To this category belong: — 1. Processing of petroleum, coal, and ore, 2. Metal and machine industry, 3. Chemical industry, 4. Ceramic industry, 5. Building material industry. Processing of Petroleum, Coal, and Ore: — The most important processing of indigenous material is the manufacture from Netherlands Indies petroleum in the refineries of the large oil companies of dozens of products for immediate use. These industries are known as “Overseas plants” because their perfecting resulted from the use of overseas science and technique. Coal mined in the Netherlands East Indies is prepared for the market by the simple process of washing. Processing of coal dust into briquettes is done at Tandjok Priok. 2 Netherlands Indies coal cannot — or only with difficulty can be — made into coke. Therefore, it cannot easily be used as a basic material for chemical and metallurgic industries. 3 However, it is not impossible that the exces- sively large quantities of inferior coal and lignite found in the Netherlands East Indies (Sumatra and East Borneo) may still be used as raw mate- rial for such industries (oil derived from coal, for instance). In thinking of supplying power for industry, one should note the possibility of using volcanic energy. Witness the steamdrilling operations at Kawah Kamodjan to supply motive power for low-pressure turbines. Tin is the most important ore produced in the Netherlands East Indies. In 1937, the Nether- lands East Indies mined 39,760 tons of tin, al- most 18 per cent of the world’s production for that year. This metal is used very little in the country itself; therefore, it is mainly an article of export. Bangka ore is smelted into tin on Bangka ; charcoal is used in the process. Billiton ore — until the invasion of Holland — was smelted, for the most part, at Arnhem; since the invasion, this has been done in Malakka. The bauxite ore of Bintan is still the most im- portant raw material for the Japanese aluminum industry. In 1939, its production amounted to more than 230,000 tons. The plans of the Billi- ton Company — already far advanced — to erect a factory for aluminum oxide (Al 2 O s ) and another for electrometallurgic aluminum on the Assahan River in order to use the energy of the Assahan waterfalls had to be abandoned because of the war. However, the foundations of this industry seem to be sound; it is expected that the delay is only temporary. The metal to be pro- duced will be used for manufacturing articles for the home market in a factory near Djokja. Five thousand tons a year — production and sale — seems to be the minimum requirement for the success of the undertaking. Although the quantity of bauxite reserves thus far discovered is small compared with the world reserves (circa 20 million tons and 1000 million tons respectively), it may be considered sufficient * In 1939, the coal import of the Netherlands East Indies was <59,801 tons worth 1,055,319 guilders. * In 1939, the coke import of the Netherlands East Indies was 5.462 tons valued at 191.214 guilders. to maintain the present production for some decades. The nickel ore of Middle and Southeast Celebes may possibly be concentrated in the future at the mine itself into less voluminous products, according to the Stiirzelberg or Renn- process. The total nickel ore reserves of the Netherlands East Indies thus far discovered are still small, somewhat in excess of a million tons of ore with an average of not quite two per cent of Ni. The quantity of nickel metal which might be produced from this ore would amount to scarcely one-sixth of the entire production of the world in one year (117,000 tons in 1937). The possibilities of other nickel ore deposits, however, are now being investigated. In 1939, the nickel ore production amounted to only 23,535 tons, but it increased rapidly in 1940. In addition to nickel ore, manganese ore is now found in the Netherlands East Indies (12,- 074 tons in 1939). Gold and silver ore are also present (2,525 and 19,222 kilograms respectively in 1939). The manganese reserves at present known are small, 4 as are the better known gold and silver reserves. Finally, the Netherlands Indies reserves of iron ore should be mentioned. A couple of hundred million tons of the later it ic type with a content of 40 to 50 per cent of iron ore are here available. Extensive plans for the processing of domestic iron ore were worked out for Celebes and south- east Borneo after the last world war (note Re- ports and Communications concerning Nether- land Indies Minerals and their Use Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 15), but they were never carried out. One of the chief difficulties was the dependence upon the importation of coke, for Netherlands Indies coal cannot be made into coke. It is pos- sible that, in the future, through new processes to be developed (such as the Stiirzelberg or the Renn-process, which use rotating ovens and are able to use inferior coal), ore may be melted at the mine, or at least processed into semi-manu- factured material (i.e. puddle, and sponge iron). New attention is being given the titanium iron ore of Java. Plans have been laid out for man- ufacturing cast steel on a small scale; titanium oxyde could be a by-product, partly to take the place of lead and zinc white. Metal and Machine Industry: — The possi- bility that the Netherlands East Indies will be able to find in its own soil enough ore to supply a metal and machine industry is true principally for tin, aluminum, and perhaps iron and nickel. Copper, lead, and zinc ores are found in these regions in only small quantities. Nor are the re- serves of steel-improving metals, such as man- ganese, chromium, wolfram, and molybdenum of great importance. Moreover, the metallurgy of steels and other alloys is a very specialized science which demands an extensive professional knowledge and thorough preparation. Perhaps, in the future, it may be possible to manufacture certain iron alloys (with manganese, chromium, nickel, and others) on a modest scale in the Netherlands East Indies, but the metal and machine industries in that country will have to depend mainly upon the importation of various ^Further explorations of the manganese ore reserves are now being conducted. 7 van Bemmelen: Mineral Resources and their Industrial Possibilities metals and metal alloys. Whether or not such industries will have a chance to develop will de- pend chiefly upon the availability of inexpensive energy (coal, fuel oil, water power, and others), cheap and well trained laborers, and adequate home markets. The Chemical Industry: — The chemical in- dustry in the Netherlands East Indies will, in the beginning, have to concentrate also on those products for which there is a local market. In 1939, some of the chemical products im- ported were the following: 1,834 tons of sulphur valued at 158,516 guilders, 3,898 tons of alum at 286,190 guilders, 20,884 tons of calcinated and caustic sodium at 2,130,211 guilders, 1,565 tons of raw and refined sulphuric acid at 145,235 guilders, 320 tons of acetic acid at 72,241 guil- ders, and 1,235 tons of formic acid at 392,098 guilders. It might be possible to subject a number of chemical products to a process of total or partial refining. For instance, the mother liquid of the solar evaporation ponds could be further con- centrated in pans heated by steam. By this method, not only household salt and gypsum can be manufactured, but Glauber's salt (Na2S0 4 - 10H 2 O), magnesium sulphate (MgS0 4 -7 H 2 0), magnesium chloride and potassium chloride. Glauber's salt might be used in glass factories; and, for potassium chloride, products of the domestic chemical industry might be sub- stituted. A chemical industry in this country, however, will have to recognize that, while large sums of money will be needed to start the basic industries deficient in potassium.' Potassium made in this way may also be used for the manufacture of glass. The husks of kapok and coconut, usually thrown away, can likewise be used for the man- ufacture of potassium. The sulphur of the Kawah Poetih or other E. Indies volcanoes can serve as raw material for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. 5 This sul- phuric acid may be used for making fertilizers, like ammonium sulphate, and for the manufac- ture of alum and aluminum sulphate. Plans for building an ammonium sulphate fac- tory with a capacity of 40 to 45,000 tons a year at Tjepoe are well under way. Moreover, sulphuric acid may be used for the manufacture of hydrochloric acid from Madoera household salt. Glauber's salt is a by-product which may be used in glass factories. Likewise, experiments might be made in ex- tracting leucite (KAlSigOe) from rock forma- tions — like those found in Moeriah and the Ringgit in Java — rich in potassium in order to use the mineral as a basic material in the prepara- tion of potassium fertilizer. The construction of large water works, like those already built on the Assahan for the man- ufacture of aluminum, makes it possible to supply power simultaneously to several industries in need of inexpensive electrical energy (i.e., man- ufacturing of cyanamid, electrolysis of house- hold salt for the preparation of sodium hydroxide). The manufacturing of ammonia in the Nether- lands East Indies might develop into an impor- tant key industry through which a number of other, domestically marketable chemicals, such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, Import of Fertilizer in 1939 Weight in Kilograms Value in Guilders Java and Madoera Outer Possessions Java and Madoera Outer Possessions Chili salpetre 547,100 13,067 33,025 805 Guano 626,957 402,606 53,558 35,320 Potassium fertilizer 3,213,508 3,771,546 213,298 289,634 Superphosphate and double super- phosphate 3,957,156 518,107 287,978 30,931 Sulphate of ammonia 86,948,721 11,836,808 5,573,880 759,118 Fertilizers n.o.s. 24,282,580 19,005,356 2,192,616 1,036,191 Total 119,576,022 35,547,490 8,354,355 2,151,999 General total 155,123,512 10,506,354 (sulphuric acid, sodium, ammonia, and so on), the sales- possibilities of its products and by- products in the local market will be small. The importation of fertilizer (potassium, superphosphate, sulphate of ammonia, etc.) is very important to the agriculture of the Dutch East Indies. A result of the investigations of the last ten years into the possible presence of natural phos- hate in Java is the conclusion that the island as a reserve of about 500,000 tons of calcium phosphate and 100-150,000 tons of aluminum phosphate. This will make it possible to supply from local sources the greater part of the phos- phate now being imported, for a period of at least fifteen to twenty years (see the above table). Plans have already been made to extract potassium from molasses, which owes its richness in potassium to the great potassium content of the soil in which the sugar cane grows. This potassium can be used later as fertilizer for soils ammonium chloride, and ammonium nitrate, could be produced. Ammonium can be made by leading steam over cyanamid, and also according to the Haber- Bosch process. For the latter coke, which must be imported, is needed. Caustic soda, for which there is great demand by the local soap manufacturers, can be made by * It is necessary to point out in connection with this fact that the known reserves of rich sulphur deposits are rather small (somewhat in excess of one million tons with a content of 50 to 60 per cent sulphur. Note Reports and Communi- cations etc. Nos. 1, 17, and 22.) However, wheh the supply of sulphuric mud of low sulphur content is taken into ac- count, the quantity of sulphur which can be found in this country is considerably larger. According to tests now be- ing made in Java, it is still possible to concentrate sulphuric mud with a content of 20-25 per cent sulphur and get satisfactory results. The sulphur of the Kawah Poetih factory is already being used by the sulphuric acid fac- tories for the oil refineries in the Netherlands East Indies. van Bemmelen: Mineral Resources and their Industrial Possibilities 8 combining sodium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. Moreover, it is possible to find in the Nether- lands East Indies the raw material for the small chemical industries — material like the deposit of iron-ochre and calcium iron-alum which are formed in the mineral springs near Tjiater on the northern slope of the Tangkoeban Prahoe. In our review, we must limit ourselves to in- dicating certain possibilities. Most of the min- erals for a chemical industry are present in the Netherlands East Indies. To what extent such an industry can actually be built up in that coun- try is determined by other factors, such as cal- culations concerning productivity, the desira- bility of making oneself independent of foreign producers, and so on. To avoid disappointment and to understand thoroughly the technical and economic demands that will be made upon the industries to be founded, it will be necessary to postpone the carrying out of plans until an ex- haustive study of the quality, quantity, and ac- cessibility of the mineral materials in relation to their present position has been concluded. Production of Minerals in the Netherl^ products. According to Davis,® the quartz- sands present in the Netherlands East Indies can be used for the manufacturing of half white glass and white glass, but the manufacturing of crystal or half crystal from quartz-sand now known to exist in the Netherlands East Indies must be con- sidered impossible. A glass factory, which will use as raw material, for the manufacture of cheap and coarse glass containers for chemicals, the dune sand found in the region, is to be built near Toeban. More- over, it is planned to produce ten million beer bottles yearly; this will take care of two-thirds of the home need. Different kinds of native clay are available for the making of pottery. But, in connection with this undertaking, besides a technical research into the quality of the material, a geological survey into the available quantity should be made. Porcelain clay (kaolin) is found in large quan- tities, particularly in Bangka and Billiton.

Diamond carat 957 1,579 2,287 Ceramic Industry : — The raw materials neces- sary for ceramics are undoubtedly present in suf- ficient quantity in the Netherlands East Indies to take care of most of the home needs; in 1939 this called for an import valued at 8,562,000 guilders. Some small and some large manufacturers have already started the industry through the making of glass and pottery on a small scale; it is effec- tively supported by the ceramic laboratory of the Department of Economic Affairs at Bandoeng. The essential basic materials for glass are quartz-sand (for the silic acid) and certain addi- tional secondary materials such as soda, Glauber’s salt, and other minerals containing sodium (to supply Na 2 0), potassium, and potash-feldspar (supplying K 2 0), limestone (supplying CaO), and red lead (supplying PbO). Other essentials are smelting-accelerators (borax, fluorspar, and potassium nitrate), means of refining, discoloring and coloring matter, and other special by- ufacture of building materials — cement, trass, lime and limestone, brick, and tiles, and so on — have been established in the Netherlands East Indies for a long time. They depend mainly upon local raw materials, and are always de- pendent upon home market possibilities. Expansion of the cement manufacturing is still possible, as is seen in the fact that in 1939, the Netherlands East Indies imported 161,369 tons of Portland cement valued at 2,098,000 guilders. Thus far too little attention has been paidjto the home production of natural stone for store- fronts, doorsteps, office buildings, and so on. Export: — It is evident from this statement that the Netherlands East Indies produce only a small amount of minerals. The only trump- 8 Ingenieur in Nederl .- Indie , 6, No. S, May 1939. Part L 9 van Bemmelen: Mineral Resources and their Industrial Possibilities cards on the world market are petroleum and tin, while bauxite and nickel-ore are significant, especially with respect to the mineral deposit conditions in East Asia. 7 Countries with a large domestic production and reserve of minerals, particularly coal, coke, and iron ore, occupy a stronger position in the industrial competitive struggle than countries like the Netherlands East Indies, which have to import most of the raw material for their heavy industries. Apart from the possibility of es- tablishing certain industries devoted to metal manufacturing, metal processing, and the build- ing of machinery to care for local and regional needs, it cannot be expected that a territory like the Netherlands East Indies will have a chance to develop an important heavy industry de- pendent partly on export. As far as the chemical industry is concerned, possibilities for further development do exist, because the Netherlands East Indies import various chemicals (sulphur, alum, gypsum, sodium, potassium fertilizer, superphosphates, ammonium sulphate, and other synthetic fer- tilizers) in rather large quantities, even though the basic material for the possible manufacture of a number of these chemicals is actually present. Likewise, the ceramic, glass, and building ma- terials industries may be further developed with the help of home raw materials. It is, however, necessary to establish an ef- ficient coordination between the advisory bodies and those interested in a general way. Care should be taken that the same mistakes made in the period during and immediately fol- lowing the world war of 1914—"
