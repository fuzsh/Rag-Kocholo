        "text": "Tokyo, 2020\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nWeeks before the Games, Ecuadorian rider Richard Carapaz had finished third in the world’s most famous race, the Tour de France. In Tokyo, he became just the second rider to win the Olympic road race and finish on the Tour podium in the same year. In the process, Carapaz became the second-ever gold medalist in Ecuador's Olympic history. That year's Tour de France winner, Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia, finished with bronze in Tokyo.\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nAmerican Jennifer Valente captured omnium gold, winning two of the event's four races to become the first-ever U.S. woman to win a track cycling title at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Great Britain's Jason Kenny won a silver medal in the team sprint and a gold medal in the keirin to give him the most Olympic gold medals (7) and most total medals (9) all-time for a cyclist and for a British athlete. Jason's wife, Laura Kenny, also won a silver medal and a gold medal, and she later retired as the most successful woman in Great Britain's Olympic history with a total of five career gold medals.\n\nBMX Racing\n\nRain slickened the track and made an impact on the women's event, as two of the top contenders — Alise Willoughby of the United States and Laura Smulders of the Netherlands — crashed out in the semifinals. In the final race, Great Britain's Bethany Shriever, who had to crowdfund and work part-time to pay for her BMX career, narrowly defeated two-time reigning Olympic champion Mariana Pajon of Colombia for gold in an amazing upset.\n\nBMX Freestyle\n\nBMX freestyle made its Olympic debut in Tokyo with park contests for men and women. Australia's Logan Martin won the inaugural men's event, while Great Britain's Charlotte Worthington captured the first-ever women's gold. American Hannah Roberts entered as the favorite in the women's contest, but Worthington earned her gold medal by pulling out a never-been-done trick — a 360 backflip — in her second run to claim the win.\n\nMountain Biking\n\nTom Pidcock won gold in the men's event to deliver Great Britain its first Olympic medal in mountain biking. Historically known for its numerous medals and dominance in Olympic track cycling, Great Britain had been missing hardware in this discipline until Tokyo.\n\nRio, 2016\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nA day before her 43rd birthday, American Kristin Armstrong became the oldest Olympic women's cycling medalist ever with her third straight gold medal in women's time trial. In the women's road race, leader Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands suffered a frightening crash in rainy conditions, which left her with a concussion and three small fractures in her spine. Her countrywoman, Anna van der Breggen, won the race.\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nGreat Britain led the cycling medal table with six golds and twelve total medals, carried by its performance on the track. With gold in team pursuit, Bradley Wiggins became the first cyclist ever to win eight Olympic medals. Jason Kenny tied compatriot Chris Hoy for the most all-time Olympic cycling gold medals with six after winning gold in sprint, keirin, and team sprint.\n\nEntering the 2016 Rio Games, Leontien van Moorsel was the all-time leader in women's cycling gold medals with four and total medals with six. At their conclusion, she was tied for the most ever in both categories. Australian Anna Meares won her sixth career Olympic medal, a bronze in women's keirin, while Laura Kenny (nee Trott) won her third and fourth career gold medals in Rio in omnium and team pursuit.\n\nChina won gold in women's team sprint, the country's first-ever Olympic gold medal in cycling.\n\nMountain Biking\n\nSwiss cross-country cyclist Nino Schurter – after ascending the medal ladder with a bronze at the 2008 Games in Beijing and a silver at the 2012 Games in London, collecting five world titles on the way – finally attained Olympic gold in the men's event. Sweden's Jenny Rissveds beat out Beijing runner-up Maja Wloszczowska of Poland.\n\nBMX Racing\n\nColombia's Mariana Pajon defended her Olympic title, and American Connor Fields unseated two-time Olympic champion Maris Strombergs of Latvia to win the U.S. its first Olympic BMX gold.\n\nLondon, 2012\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nIn the women's road race, Holland's Marianne Vos won the gold medal, beating out Britain's Elizabeth Deignan (nee Armitstead) (silver) and Russia's Olga Zabelinskaya (bronze) on a typically rainy Sunday in London.\n\nIn the women's time trial, Kristin Armstrong of the United States, who had retired to start a family after winning gold in Beijing before returning to competition a year before the Games, dominated the field finishing more than 15 seconds faster than her closest competitor. Taking place shortly before her 39th birthday, Armstrong's victory made her cycling's oldest female gold medalist.\n\nFor the men, Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan won the gold, finishing ahead of Colombia's Rigoberto Uran and Norway's Alexander Kristoff. In the men's time trial, Great Britain's Bradley Wiggins emerged victorious in his home country to become the first cyclist to win the Tour de France and Olympic gold in the same year, beating Germany's Tony Martin and fellow countryman Chris Froome. The United States' Taylor Phinney finished fourth in both the road race and the time trial.\n\nBMX Racing\n\nIn men's BMX, Latvia's Maris Strombergs remained the Olympic sport's only male champion, winning his second straight Olympic gold with Sam Willoughby and Carlos Oquendo Zabala rounding out the field. On the women's side, Colombia's Mariana Pajon seized the gold medal, only Colombia's second since it began competing in the Games.\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nThe host country dominated inside the velodrome, where riders from Great Britain captured seven of a possible 10 gold medals. Victoria Pendleton represented England nobly with a gold medal in women's keirin and a silver in the women's sprint, and compatriot Chris Hoy won his sixth gold medal, this time in the team sprint.\n\nTwo of Great Britain's big winners – Jason Kenny, who took gold in the individual and team sprints, and Laura Trott, who won the omnium and was a member of the Brits' team pursuit gold – later revealed that they were dating after being photographed behind football legend David Beckham at a beach volleyball match.\n\nMountain Biking\n\nOn the mountain bike course, Jaroslav Kulhavy and Julie Bresset won gold in the men's and women's events respectively. Georgia Gould captured the only mountain biking medal for the U.S. as she claimed bronze in the women's race.\n\nAthens, 2004\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nOne month after a back injury forced him out of the Tour de France, American Tyler Hamilton climbed from third place at the halfway mark to overtake Sydney gold-medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia and win the Olympic men's road time trial.\n\n\"This is fantastic,\" Hamilton said. \"I've dreamt about a gold medal ever since I was a kid. I'm really proud to represent my country. This the greatest moment of my career.\"\n\nFellow American Bobby Julich overcame a broken right wrist suffered in the Tour de France to take the bronze.\n\nHamilton came up with a positive doping \"A\" test after the race, but got to keep his medal after his \"B\" test was thrown out on a technicality. However, in 2011 he admitted to blood doping, a practice he claims to have learned while a member of Lance Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team, and subsequently returned his gold medal.\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nAustralia dominated the track cycling competition, picking up 10 medals, including five gold, in the 12 events contested. Among the highlights were Anna Meares setting a world record of 33.952 seconds en route to a gold medal in the women's time trial; Ryan Bayley winning gold in the men's sprint and keirin events; the Aussie men's pursuit team setting a world record in the first round before winning gold; and Graeme Brown and Stuart O'Grady winning Madison gold.\n\nIn 2000, Australian Katie Mactier gave up her career at a large Melbourne advertising agency to devote herself full-time to cycling. Four years later, she earned her first Olympic medal, silver in the women's individual pursuit. Originally a road competitor, Mactier only added track cycling to her repertoire in 2003, when she nearly beat Dutch Olympic champion Leontien van Moorsel in the individual pursuit at the World Championships that year. Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand set a world record in winning gold while Van Moorsel took bronze in her Olympic farewell.\n\nSydney, 2000\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nThirty-year-old cyclist Leontien van Moorsel, her career once jeopardized by an eating disorder, was the star of Sydney's cycling competition. The Dutchwoman's stunning dominance began on the track with a victory in the individual pursuit, followed by silver in the points race.\n\nGermany's Jens Fiedler, chasing his third consecutive Olympic title in the men's sprint, lost 2-0 in the Sydney semifinals to American Marty Nothstein. Four years earlier in the Atlanta final, Nothstein lost two close races to Fiedler. This time, the Pennsylvania native seized his golden moment and defeated Florian Rousseau of France 2-0 to give the U.S. its first sprint gold since Mark Gorski at the 1984 Games.\n\nAmerican Chris Witty – a double-medalist in speed skating at the 1998 Nagano Games – finished fifth in the women’s 500m time trial. At the 2002 Salt Lake Games, she won the women’s 1000m gold medal in world record time.\n\nBest capitalizing on an expanded cycling program for Sydney, France en route to its eight medals in cycling won three of the four new track events: the Olympic sprint, a team competition; the keirin, from Florian Rousseau; and the women's 500m time trial, from Felicia Ballanger, who also defended her sprint title. The only new event not won by the French was the Madison, which went to a team from Australia.\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nWith a sweep of the road race and time trial to add to her individual pursuit victory on the track, Dutchwoman Leontien van Moorsel was one of six athletes to win three gold medals at the Sydney Games.\n\nAmerican Lance Armstrong, a two-time reigning Tour de France winner and cancer survivor, failed in his attempt to become the first man to win the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal in the same year, taking the bronze in the time trial and finishing 13th in the road race. The medal, and all of Armstrong's Tour de France victories, were later revoked after it was discovered that he had used performance enhancing drugs since 1998. He had suffered fractured vertebrae in his neck shortly before the Olympics after colliding with a car during training.\n\nRussia’s Viatcheslav Ekimov won the time trial to become the first cyclist to win Olympic gold 12 years apart — he won his first gold in 1988 in track cycling’s team pursuit event. Germany’s Jan Ullrich won the road race and placed second in the time trial.\n\nMountain Biking\n\nShe said before the race she'd be happy to just win bronze, and her pink bike didn't exactly convey toughness. But in the Olympic women's mountain bike event, Italy's Paola Pezzo was as determined and tenacious as ever. After making \"several errors\" early, Pezzo fought for the lead on the fourth of five laps when she got entangled with Spain's two-time world champion, Margarita Fullana. Pezzo emerged from the tie-up, but Fullana fell, allowing the Italian to pull away and cruise to a successful defense of her Olympic title.\n\nBarcelona, 1992\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nRiding a new, high-tech bicycle that weighed less than 20 pounds, Britain's Chris Boardman dominated track cycling's individual pursuit competition. In the preliminary rounds, Boardman lowered the world record by nearly seven seconds. Then, in the race for gold, he overtook Germany's Jens Lehmann – a feat never before achieved in an Olympic pursuit final – to become Britain's first Olympic cycling champion in 72 years, since the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp.\n\nThe addition of the women's individual pursuit to the 1992 program helped lure American Rebecca Twigg and France's Jeannie Longo out of their retirements. Combined, they won seven world titles in the event in the 1980s. In a quarterfinal duel, Twigg, 29, edged Longo, 33, by two inches. Twigg then lost in the semifinals to relative unknown Kathy Watt of Australia, but did earn an Olympic bronze medal to go along with her 1984 road race silver. Longo, who finished second to the 5-foot-1 Watt in the Barcelona road race, competed at two more Olympics before retiring with four career medals.\n\nFour years after winning the inaugural women's sprint event, representing the Soviet Union, Erika Salumae took gold again in Barcelona. But this time, Salumae pedaled for her native Estonia, which had last competed independently at the 1936 Berlin Games. After becoming Estonia's first female Olympic champion, Salumae watched as the Estonian flag was raised upside down at the medal ceremony.\n\nSpain’s Jose Moreno excited the home crowd by winning his nation’s first gold medal of the Games in the kilometer time trial. One year earlier, Moreno tested positive for steroids but was exonerated after the UCI, cycling’s international federation, found faulty procedures were used. American Erin Hartwell secured the bronze.\n\nRoad Cycling\n\nIn the road race, Italy’s Fabio Casartelli edged the Netherlands' Erik Dekker to claim the gold. It was the last time this event was closed to professionals. Casartelli would soon turn pro, and three years later in the 1995 Tour de France, a vicious crash on a mountain descent resulted in his death. Three days later, Motorola teammate Lance Armstrong of the United States won a stage that he dedicated to Casartelli. Armstrong finished 14th in the 1992 Olympic event and turned professional immediately following the race.\n\nIn the women’s road race, France’s Jeannie Longo believed she had won the gold medal when she crossed the line, but she had not realized that Australia’s Kathy Watt had snuck out of the peloton and cruised to victory."
