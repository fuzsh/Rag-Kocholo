        "text": "Great Britain won a fourth gold medal in Rio when the men's cycling sprint team retained their title on the day Katherine Grainger became the country's most decorated female Olympian.\n\nPhilip Hindes, Jason Kenny and Callum Skinner defeated New Zealand to move GB to eighth in the medal table.\n\nEarlier, Grainger and Victoria Thornley secured double sculls silver.\n\nGB also took silver in the inaugural men's rugby sevens and the men's canoe double C2 as Britain reached 16 medals.\n\nThat total is one ahead of the number won at London 2012 after as many days of competition.\n\nThe rugby sevens team lost 43-7 to a brilliant Fiji side, who earned their first Olympic medal of any colour.\n\nIt was another great day for medal-table leaders the United States, with golds for superstar gymnast Simone Biles and swimming legend Michael Phelps, who demolished the field in the 200m individual medley to claim his 22nd Olympic gold.\n\nAmerican Simone Manuel became the first black female swimmer to win an Olympic title as she shared the women's 100m freestyle gold with Canada's Penny Oleksiak, 16, after a dead heat.\n\nBritain have not won a world title in men's team sprint cycling since 2005, but have now won Olympic gold in 2008, 2012 and 2016.\n\nThe British trio clocked 42.440 seconds, an Olympic record, just five months after finishing sixth at the Track World Championships in London.\n\nWhile a great team result, this victory was especially key for 28-year-old Englishman Kenny, who now has four Olympic gold medals.\n\nWith further medal chances to come in the individual sprint and keirin, Kenny has the chance to equal the British record of six Olympic gold medals held by fellow cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.\n\nGrainger and Thornley, 28, were not initially named in the GB squad after they failed to make the podium at this year's European Championships, but earned a reprieve from selectors - a decision Grainger described at the time as like having \"the lights come back on\".\n\n\"It's not been the smoothest or most direct route but it's a relief that we're there,\" Grainger told BBC Sport in June.\n\n\"There have been days when I couldn't necessarily see a way forward and times when I couldn't see the path but I never stopped believing I could get there.\"\n\nFive-time Olympic champion Sir Steve Redgrave paid tribute to Grainger's achievement, saying: \"It was amazing. This is the best medal Kath has won, because of the hard road she had to get there.\n\n\"What she has done for the sport, for women's sport, is incredible. I am immensely proud of her.\"\n\nGB secured a date with Fiji in the first men's gold medal match in rugby sevens after beating South Africa 7-5 in the semis.\n\nBut it swiftly became apparent that there was only going to be one winner in the final as the mighty Fijians - coached by Englishman Ben Ryan - steamrollered GB.\n\nThe South Pacific island ran in seven tries in the 20-minute contest as Britain had to settle for a distant second-best, albeit securing Team GB a sixth silver medal in the process.\n\nFiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama called the victory \"a wonderful moment in the history of our nation\", adding that \"every Fijian is rejoicing at home and around the world\".\n\n\"Never before has the Fijian spirit soared so high as it does today. Never have we stood so tall as a nation,\" he said.\n\nRugby sevens has been included in the Olympics for the first time, although the 15-player version of the game was contested between 1900 and 1924 - a time when medals were also awarded for tug-of-war, gliding and the intriguingly named 'plunge for distance'.\n\nThere are few competitors at these Games carrying as much expectation on their shoulders as star US gymnast Simone Biles, but if she is feeling any pressure she's not showing it.\n\nThe 4ft 9in Biles won gold in the women's all-around competition with a total of 62.198, ahead of team-mate Alexandra Raisman.\n\nBiles, 19, starred as the US won team gold earlier this week. She has also has medal chances in the vault final on Sunday, the beam final on Monday and the floor final on Tuesday.\n\nBBC chief sports writer Tom Fordyce:\n\n\"This may have been Fiji's first Olympic medal and GB's third team sprint gold in three Games, but both provided magical moments on day six in Rio.\n\n\"In the Velodrome Britain's trio put right all the problems of the intervening four years, Skinner's addition earlier this year plus the power of Hindes and experience of Kenny giving their nation's track team a huge boost.\n\n\"And Fiji's story - winning gold in the sport they have defined and inspired, coached by Londoner Ben Ryan, transforming the mood of a troubled island nation - is a biopic waiting to happen.\"\n\nOne of the stand-out displays of day six came at the Velodrome where GB's women's pursuit team pursuit shattered the world record in their qualifying heat.\n\nThe quartet of Katie Archibald, Laura Trott, Elinor Barker and Joanna Rowsell-Shand posted a time of four minutes 13.260secs.\n\nThe first Olympic golf competition in 112 years got off to a stunning start with Britain's Justin Rose hitting a hole-in-one on the par-three fourth hole."
