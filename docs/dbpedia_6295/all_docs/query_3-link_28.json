        "text": "A few days ago, the IOC’s official Twitter channel asked the following question:\n\nMost answers were “Stockholm 1912”, which was later also confirmed as the correct one. But my answer would have been “well, that depends”. Of course, that could be because I used to be a consultant, but I think there’s really multiple possible answers here.\n\nOne reason for this is there’s no universal definition of “continent”. There are said to be five continents here by the IOC. According to the definitions at Wikipedia, there’s one configuration with five continents, but that includes Antarctica. Of course, there have never been any Olympians from there, so we’ll look at the options with six continents. Excluding Antarctica, that gives us:\n\nAfrica, Asia, Europe, America and Australia\n\nAfrica, Eurasia, North America, South America and Australia\n\nAs for the first option, it’s also worth noting that two countries relevant to us are in both Asia and Europe: Turkey and Russia.\n\nAthens 1896\n\nWith this in mind, the first possible answer is Athens 1896. But this is a bit of a stretch. If we look at continental configuration 1, it’s clear that participants from Europe, America and Australia have competed. There are some participants, however, that are usually listed as Greek that could be said to hail from Asia and Africa, though. For example, tennis player Casdagli is sometimes listed as Egyptian (and he lived there part of his life, although British is probably a better guess for his nationality), while cyclist Loverdos hailed from Smyrna, which is in the Asian part of Turkey. Stretching even further, we could look at continental configuration 2. That eliminates the need for an Asian competitor, but requires a South American one. This might have been Subercaseaux, who some Chilean researchers insist competed, but the evidence for that is limited at best.\n\nParis 1900\n\nThe case for 1900 being the right answer is much more reasonable than 1896. There definitely were competitors from Australia, Europe, North and South America, as well as Asia. Three competitors in gymnastics definitely hailed from Africa: Castiglioni, Koubi and Martinez all represented a club from Oran, Algeria, and hailed from the same place. However, they are usually listed as French, given that nation’s control of Algeria at the time.\n\nSt. Louis 1904\n\nSt. Louis definitely featured competitors from (North) America, Europe and Africa, as well at least one Australian. However, there were no Asians in the events that are normally considered of Olympic status. But such distinction was not clearly made in 1904, so you could make the case that the rather embarrassing Antropological Days should be included as well. This display included “athletes” (they were attendees to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition) from various “primitive” people. This include Native Americans (including from Patagonia, thus also covering South America), but also Japan and the Philippines, giving room for an argument there were Asian competitors.\n\nAthens 1906\n\nThe Intercalated Games – held at the 10th anniversary of the first Olympics – are not presently recognised by the IOC as official Olympics, but given the official status at the time and its importance for the Olympic Movement, I’m including it here. When using the first continental configuration, the question marks are Asia and Africa. Like for 1896, there’s representatives typically listed as Greek that could be termed Asian (e.g. from Smyrna) or African (again Casdagli, as well as his brother). The Asian link is a bit stronger, though: one athlete from Ankara (albeit of Armenian heritage) also competed.\n\nLondon 1908\n\nFor 1908, the only question mark is Asia. There was one Turkish competitor, Aleko Mulos, so one might say Asia was represented. However, given that he represented the Galatasaray High School, we might surmise Mulos was from the European part of Istanbul, making his claim as an Asian competitor a bit weak. It’s possible, though, that one of the six Russian competitors hailed from across the Ural (and were thus Asian), but details on these competitors are scarce, but I’m not aware of any that did.\n\nFinally, we might inspect the huge British contingent. That featured several athletes born in Asia, and several of them spent most of their lives there, such as William Knyvett, so they might be termed Asians. However, from 1908 on all competitors officially represented a country or NOC, so most conventional is to view them as British.\n\nStockholm 1912\n\nFinally, there’s 1912, the “official” answer. This is the first year where we can do an unqualified claim: with Japan competing, there is no need to depend on the cross-continental nations of Turkey and Russia to put a check next to Asia. And with the – this time undisputed – presence of Chile, even the adherents of the second continental configuration can be satisfied.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nI hope the above makes clear that even such a simple question has a complex answer if you’re into Olympic statistics. But, if pressed to give a single answer, I would probably go for Paris 1900\n\nDuring every Olympics, all media outlets track the medal table: which nation has won the most medals? Of course, there’s also an all-time table that tallies all medals won since 1896. What can we expect to happen in Rio on this all-time ranking?\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe US has won by far the most Olympic medals and would continue to lead even if another nation won all the 306 gold medals at stake in Rio.\n\nOne prediction we can confidently make is that the top 3 will not change. The United States is first with over a 1,000 golds and 2,700+ medals, more than double the totals of second placed Soviet Union. As there’s only 306 events held in Rio, that gap can never be closed – even if Lenin stood up from his mausoleum, refounded the USSR and had the team win every event. Even if we would add in the medals won by Russia and the 1992 Unified Team won prior to 1917 and after 1991, this would not be enough. Germany in third is 170 golds behind the Soviets, and almost 50 golds clear of the competition behind it, so that spot is secure.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nCan the British keep the 4th place overall that Mo Farah helped them take in 2012?\n\nBy contrast, places 4, 5 and 6 on the all-time list are closely contested. Three nations vie for fourth place: Great Britain, France and Italy. The British took a lead with their impressive 29 golds at the home Games in 2012, but France is only three golds behind Britain (and 4 medals total). Italy is not lagging far behind, with five less Olympic titles medals won since 1896 (they are quite far behind in total medals, however). In theory, even 7th placed China could even clear the gap of 35 gold medals as they’ve won 30+ gold medals in the past three Games. Taking over Italy would require a poor showing of the Azzurri, though.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nRussia’s medal performance for Rio is unclear due to doping related exclusions of many of its top athletes.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it would be realistic to expect Russia to climb further into the top 10, as the gaps with East Germany (which will definitely not medal) and Sweden (whose showings at Beijing and London were amongst their poorest ever) are not that big. Of course, the exclusion of a sizeable part of the Russian team is expected to have a negative impact on their totals. Also, the complete results of the doping re-tests of 2008 and 2012 are expected only after the Rio Games, and are thus not yet reflected in the results. This will certainly impact Russia’s medal totals as well.\n\nFurther down, Australia and Japan look to be overtaking Finland in the standings, while South Korea might overtake the Netherlands with a good performance in Brazil. The host nation itself, ranked 37th at the moment, will likely not climb a lot. It would need three golds and two silvers overtake idle Yugoslavia, while it could possibly move past Kenya.\n\nSome nations might be entering the table with their first ever medals. In this article at the Official Rio 2016 site, nations tipped for this honour are Fiji, Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina, St. Kitts & Nevis, San Marino, Rwanda, Jordan and Honduras.\n\nBelow is the current all-time medal table. It includes all medals, including those won at the Winter Olympics as well as the Intercalated 1906 Olympics. It does not yet include corrections from the 2008 and 2012 doping retests.\n\n[table]\n\n#,Country,NOC,Golds,Silvers,Bronzes,Total\n\n1,United States,USA,1086,866,755,2707\n\n2,Soviet Union,URS,473,376,355,1204\n\n3,Germany,GER,301,335,326,962\n\n4,Great Britain,GBR,256,294,290,840\n\n5,France,FRA,253,265,318,836\n\n6,Italy,ITA,248,213,233,694\n\n7,China,CHN,213,166,147,526\n\n8,Sweden,SWE,197,209,239,645\n\n9,East Germany,GDR,192,165,162,519\n\n10,Russia,RUS,183,166,180,529\n\n11,Norway,NOR,177,162,144,483\n\n12,Hungary,HUN,170,153,173,496\n\n13,Finland,FIN,148,148,176,472\n\n14,Australia,AUS,143,159,185,487\n\n15,Japan,JPN,140,143,162,445\n\n16,Canada,CAN,122,157,174,453\n\n17,Netherlands,NED,116,126,144,386\n\n18,South Korea,KOR,107,99,90,296\n\n19,Switzerland,SUI,105,120,116,341\n\n20,Romania,ROU,88,94,120,302\n\n21,Austria,AUT,84,118,122,324\n\n22,Poland,POL,73,91,135,299\n\n23,Cuba,CUB,71,65,66,202\n\n24,West Germany,FRG,67,82,94,243\n\n25,Unified Team,EUN,54,44,37,135\n\n26,Bulgaria,BUL,52,87,81,220\n\n27,Czechoslovakia,TCH,51,58,62,171\n\n28,Denmark,DEN,46,76,73,195\n\n29,Belgium,BEL,43,57,63,163\n\n30,New Zealand,NZL,42,19,39,100\n\n31,Greece,GRE,39,56,52,147\n\n32,Turkey,TUR,39,25,24,88\n\n33,Spain,ESP,38,59,36,133\n\n34,Ukraine,UKR,35,28,59,122\n\n35,Yugoslavia,YUG,26,32,29,87\n\n36,Kenya,KEN,25,32,29,86\n\n37,Brazil,BRA,23,30,55,108\n\n38,South Africa,RSA,23,27,28,78\n\n39,Czech Republic,CZE,21,24,23,68\n\n40,Ethiopia,ETH,21,7,17,45\n\n41,Belarus,BLR,18,28,44,90\n\n42,Argentina,ARG,18,24,28,70\n\n43,Jamaica,JAM,17,30,20,67\n\n44,Kazakhstan,KAZ,17,20,22,59\n\n45,Iran,IRI,15,20,25,60\n\n46,North Korea,PRK,14,13,22,49\n\n47,Mexico,MEX,13,21,27,61\n\n48,Estonia,EST,13,11,16,40\n\n49,Mixed team,MIX,12,8,8,28\n\n50,Croatia,CRO,10,13,11,34\n\n51,Slovakia,SVK,9,11,9,29\n\n52,Ireland,IRL,9,9,13,31\n\n53,India,IND,9,6,11,26\n\n54,Egypt,EGY,7,8,9,24\n\n55,Thailand,THA,7,6,11,24\n\n56,Slovenia,SLO,6,10,18,34\n\n57,Indonesia,INA,6,10,11,27\n\n58,Azerbaijan,AZE,6,5,15,26\n\n59,Georgia,GEO,6,5,14,25\n\n60,Morocco,MAR,6,5,11,22\n\n61,Lithuania,LTU,6,5,10,21\n\n61,Uzbekistan,UZB,6,5,10,21\n\n63,Algeria,ALG,5,2,8,15\n\n64,Bahamas,BAH,5,2,5,12\n\n65,Portugal,POR,4,8,11,23\n\n66,Luxembourg,LUX,4,4,0,8\n\n67,Latvia,LAT,3,15,8,26\n\n68,Nigeria,NGR,3,8,12,23\n\n69,Australasia,ANZ,3,4,5,12\n\n70,Zimbabwe,ZIM,3,4,1,8\n\n71,Pakistan,PAK,3,3,4,10\n\n71,Tunisia,TUN,3,3,4,10\n\n73,Dominican Republic,DOM,3,2,1,6\n\n74,Cameroon,CMR,3,1,1,5\n\n75,Mongolia,MGL,2,9,13,24\n\n76,Chinese Taipei,TPE,2,7,12,21\n\n77,Chile,CHI,2,7,4,13\n\n78,Colombia,COL,2,6,11,19\n\n79,Trinidad and Tobago,TTO,2,6,10,18\n\n80,Serbia and Montenegro,SCG,2,4,3,9\n\n81,Uganda,UGA,2,3,2,7\n\n82,Venezuela,VEN,2,2,8,12\n\n83,Uruguay,URU,2,2,6,10\n\n84,Liechtenstein,LIE,2,2,5,9\n\n85,Peru,PER,1,3,0,4\n\n86,Armenia,ARM,1,2,9,12\n\n87,Serbia,SRB,1,2,4,7\n\n88,Israel,ISR,1,1,5,7\n\n89,Costa Rica,CRC,1,1,2,4\n\n90,Hong Kong,HKG,1,1,1,3\n\n90,Syria,SYR,1,1,1,3\n\n92,Ecuador,ECU,1,1,0,2\n\n93,Panama,PAN,1,0,2,3\n\n94,Mozambique,MOZ,1,0,1,2\n\n94,Suriname,SUR,1,0,1,2\n\n96,Burundi,BDI,1,0,0,1\n\n96,Grenada,GRN,1,0,0,1\n\n96,United Arab Emirates,UAE,1,0,0,1\n\n99,Namibia,NAM,0,4,0,4\n\n100,Malaysia,MAS,0,3,3,6\n\n101,Philippines,PHI,0,2,7,9\n\n102,Puerto Rico,PUR,0,2,6,8\n\n103,Moldova,MDA,0,2,5,7\n\n104,Iceland,ISL,0,2,2,4\n\n104,Lebanon,LIB,0,2,2,4\n\n104,Singapore,SIN,0,2,2,4\n\n107,Sri Lanka,SRI,0,2,0,2\n\n107,Tanzania,TAN,0,2,0,2\n\n107,Vietnam,VIE,0,2,0,2\n\n110,Bohemia,BOH,0,1,5,6\n\n111,Ghana,GHA,0,1,3,4\n\n112,Individual Olympic Athletes,IOA,0,1,2,3\n\n112,Kyrgyzstan,KGZ,0,1,2,3\n\n112,Saudi Arabia,KSA,0,1,2,3\n\n112,Tajikistan,TJK,0,1,2,3\n\n116,Haiti,HAI,0,1,1,2\n\n116,United Arab Republic,UAR,0,1,1,2\n\n116,Zambia,ZAM,0,1,1,2\n\n119,Botswana,BOT,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Cote d’Ivoire,CIV,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Cyprus,CYP,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Gabon,GAB,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Guatemala,GUA,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Montenegro,MNE,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Netherlands Antilles,AHO,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Paraguay,PAR,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Senegal,SEN,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Sudan,SUD,0,1,0,1\n\n119,Tonga,TGA,0,1,0,1\n\n119,United States Virgin Islands,ISV,0,1,0,1\n\n131,Qatar,QAT,0,0,4,4\n\n132,Afghanistan,AFG,0,0,2,2\n\n132,Kuwait,KUW,0,0,2,2\n\n132,West Indies Federation,WIF,0,0,2,2\n\n135,Bahrain,BRN,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Barbados,BAR,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Bermuda,BER,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Djibouti,DJI,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Eritrea,ERI,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Guyana,GUY,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Iraq,IRQ,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Macedonia,MKD,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Mauritius,MRI,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Monaco,MON,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Niger,NIG,0,0,1,1\n\n135,Togo,TOG,0,0,1,1[/table]\n\nIn November, it was announced that no Bulgarian weightlifters will compete at the Rio 2016 Olympics, as a punishment for an excessive amount of doping positives among Bulgarian lifters. Such a suspension is not unique, but – fortunately – still relatively rare. We’ll take a look at other exclusions in Olympic history.\n\nJust look at Bulgaria’s Olympic weightlifting history already reveals a few similar cases. In 1988, the team withdrew after two gold medallists (Mitko Grabnev and Angel Genchev) had tested positive for doping. Twelve years later, three Bulgarian medallists, including gold medallist Izabela Dragneva, were caught with performance enhancing drugs, which was followed by a suspension of the rest of the weightlifting team. In 2008, Bulgaria chose not to compete in the Olympics, with no less than 11 national team members facing doping suspensions in the run-up to the Games. Those low points are now followed by a suspension ahead of the Games.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nOne of the players in Bulgaria’s tainted Olympic weightlifting past: Izabela Dragneva.\n\nAnother group of athletes possibly facing suspension are the Russian track and field athletes. Following a recent report by WADA, the International Assocation of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has supended Russian athletes from competing internationally. Depending on how quick they can reform, they may also miss the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nA similar exclusion came in 1988, when Mexico was banned by the international football federation (FIFA), after they were found to have knowingly used at least four players over the age limit in an U20 tournament. All Mexican representative teams were banned for a period of two years, including the Olympic team that had already qualified for Seoul. They were replaced by Guatemala.\n\nAnother age-related suspension was handed out in 2010 by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). In gymnastics, there is a minimum age for competitors, and North Korea was found to have submitted false birth dates for at least two competitors. They were suspended from international competition for two years, which included the 2012 London Games.\n\nIn the past, it has happened several times that nations were not allowed to compete at the Olympics. The first such occasion came in 1920. Despite the fact that Olympic renovator Pierre de Coubertin was not in favor, the (perceived) aggressors of World War I – Austria, Germany, Hungary and Turkey – were not invited. The Germans were not invited in 1924 either, leaving them to return on the Olympic podium only in St. Moritz 1928. Twenty years later, Germany could also not enter the Olympics. Following World War II, the country had been divided by the four allied nations, and the German National Olympic Committee therefore did not formally represent any recognized nation. However, Japan was not allowed to compete in the 1948 Games either, suggestion this formal reason might merely have been an excuse to not invite the war aggressors.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nActivist Dennis Brutus campaigned for Apartheid-era South Africa to be banned from the Olympics – with eventual success.\n\nThe 1964 Olympics were marked by the suspension of the South African NOC, a year earlier. The South African NOC did not allow mixed-race competition, which was in conflict with the IOC’s non-discrimination policies. In 1970, South Africa was expelled from the International Olympic Committee and only reinstated in 1992. A similar fate befell Rhodesia – present-day Zimbabwe – when its invitation for the 1972 Olympics was revoked shortly before the opening ceremony, and the NOC was suspended. Most African nations did not recognize the (white) Ian Smith regime, and threatened to boycott the Munich Games if the nation were allowed to compete. Rhodesian athletes had already missed the 1968 Olympics when strict interpretation of passport rules meant they could not enter Mexico. Competitors from Taiwan suffered from the same issue in 1976, when they were unable to enter Canada.\n\nFollowing the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, a United Nations resolution prohibited teams representing that country at sports events. Individual athletes were allowed to compete, and so the IOC created Individual Olympic Participants, allowing such athletes to take part in Barcelona 1992.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn 1999, the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan was suspended from competition, among others for not allowing women to compete in sports. As of 2012, four Afghan women have competed in the Olympics.\n\nIn more recent years, several National Olympic Committees have been suspended by the IOC for not abiding by the rules of the Olympic Charter. Frequently, this concerns government intervention in the NOC, but there may be other reasons. Such suspensions include:\n\nVenezuela in 1993\n\nIraq in 2003-2004\n\nPanama in 2007-2008\n\nKuwait in 2010-2012 and again in 2015-present\n\nGhana in 2011\n\nTwo such suspensions had effects on a nation’s participation in the Olympics. Afghanistan was banned in 1999, causing them to miss the 2000 Olympics – although the Taliban probably couldn’t care less. In 2013, India was also suspended, forcing one of its athletes to compete as an Individual Olympic Athlete during the first week of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The suspension was lifted during the second week, allowing the remaining two competitors to contest their events under the Indian flag.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nLuger Shiva Keshavan was forced to compete as an independent athlete in Sochi 2014, as his nation’s NOC (India) had been suspended.\n\nBack in 1962, the Indonesian NOC had also been suspended by the IOC, as they had refused to allow athletes from Taiwan and Israel compete in the Asian Games. Angered by the fact that France and the US (which had refused to allow competitors from East Germany) were not suspended, Indonesian President Sukarno created the Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO). Held in 1963, the IOC banned all athletes that had competed at these Games, which caused Indonesia and North Korea to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics, even if they were allowed to enter athletes who hadn’t contested the GANEFO. North Korea competed again in the second (and last) edition of the GANEFO (1966), which meant they were suspended by the IOC, causing the nation to miss the 1968 Olympics as well.\n\n[table]\n\nYear,Country,Reason\n\n1920,Germany, Not invited as WWI aggressor nation\n\n1920,Austria, Not invited as WWI aggressor nation\n\n1920,Hungary, Not invited as WWI aggressor nation\n\n1920,Turkey, Not invited as WWI aggressor nation\n\n1924,Germany, Not invited as WWI aggressor nation\n\n1948, Germany, Not invited as WWII aggressor nation (no formal NOC)\n\n1948, Japan, Not invited as WWII aggressor nation\n\n1964, South Africa, Suspended by IOC\n\n1968, North Korea, Suspended by IOC\n\n1968, South Africa, Suspended by IOC\n\n1968, Rhodesia, Could not enter host nation\n\n1972, Rhodesia, Invitation revoked\n\n1976, Rhodesia, Suspended by IOC\n\n1976, Taiwan, Could not enter host nation\n\n1988,Mexico (football), Suspended by IF\n\n2000, Afghanistan, Suspended by IOC\n\n2012, North Korea (gymnastics), Suspended by IF\n\n2014, India, Suspended by IOC\n\n2016, Bulgaria (weightlifting), Suspended by IF\n\n[/table]\n\nThe Australian Athletics Federation is looking to overturn Olympic results from 1948 and 1980. It hopes to help Shirley Strickland to a bronze medal in the 1948 200 m and Ian Campbell to a gold in the 1980 triple jump. Although it’s not very likely that they will be successful, medal changes years after the fact are not without precedent in Olympic history. In fact, even if the 1948 result changes 67 years after the fact, it wouldn’t even be a record.\n\nWe’ve made a compilation of occasions in Olympic history when the medal results changed at least a month after the end of the Games. All doping related cases have been excluded – they warrant an article of their own.\n\n1904\n\nAll Olympic record books list the silver medallist in the 1904 lightweight boxing event as Jack Egan (sometimes spelled Eagan). He lost the final on decision to Harry Spanjer, while Russell Van Horn took third place. But more than a year later, Egan was discovered to have been fighting under an alias. This was not uncommon at the time, as many more wealthy citizens did not want to be associated with sports. Egan’s real name was Frank Floyd, and he came from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While this may not seem serious, by the rules of the AAU it was illegal to fight under an assumed name, a so-called ringer. In November 1905, the AAU decided that Egan would be disqualified from all AAU competitions, and he would have to return his prizes. The Atlantic Association that had knowingly accepted Floyd’s application as Egan was also expelled from the AAU.\n\nThis late decision to revise the Olympic results in this event has, as far as we know, never been published since the events in 1905, and was only rediscovered in 2008 by Taavi Kalju (a member of the OlyMADMen, just like the authors of this blog). More than 100 years after the fact, Peter Sturholdt can be recognized as a new Olympic medallist – all the more remarkable considering he never won a single fight.\n\n1912\n\nThe star athlete of the 1912 Olympics was American Jim Thorpe. He had overwhelmingly won both the pentathlon and the decathlon events. The King of Sweden gave him his gold medals and told him, “You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.”\n\nIn early 1913, it was revealed that Thorpe had played minor league baseball in the United States. For this he was retroactively declared a professional by the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) and the IOC and his records at the 1912 Olympics were declared void. He had to return his gold medals. What is not so well known is that Thorpe should never have been disqualified in the first place.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAn all-round athlete, Thorpe also played professional football, baseball and basketball\n\nOver the years numerous attempts were made to get the IOC to reverse the decision, mostly started by Thorpe’s children. Some efforts succeeded gradually. In 1973, the AAU restored Thorpe’s amateur status for the years 1909-1912. This was followed in 1975 by the United States Olympic Committee making a similar restoration.\n\nIn 1982, the Thorpe family, aided by Bob Wheeler, one of Thorpe’s biographers, and his wife, Florence Ridlon, succeeded in their long struggle to have Jim Thorpe’s medals restored by the International Olympic Committee. It was revealed in Sports Illustrated that a key factor in this decision was a discovery by Ridlon, who found a pamphlet in the Library of Congress which gave the rules and regulations for the 1912 Olympic Games. It stated that the statute of limitations for a claim against any Olympic athlete’s eligibility in 1912 had to have been made within 30 days after the awarding of the prizes. The announcement of Thorpe’s professional baseball career occurred in January 1913. Thus it was almost six months after the end of the Olympics and his disqualification was completely unwarranted.\n\nOn 27 February 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon founded The Jim Thorpe Foundation, expressly for the purpose of moving to have his medals and honors restored. On 13 October 1982, only eight months after the formation of The Jim Thorpe Foundation, but fully 70 years too late, the IOC Executive Board approved, in a sense, the restoration of Jim Thorpe’s medals, declaring him co-winner with Sweden’s Hugo Wieslander (decathlon) and Norway’s Ferdinand Bie (pentathlon). At a meeting of the IOC Executive Board, this time on 18 January 1983 in Los Angeles, commemorative medals were presented to Bill and Gail Thorpe, two of Thorpe’s children.\n\n1924\n\nThe inaugural Olympic ski jumping competition ended with a clean sweep for the Norwegians – or so it seemed.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAnders Haugen – Olympic medallist after 50 years.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, Thoralf Strømstad – a silver medallist in the cross country and Nordic combined at the 1924 Games – contacted Norwegian ski historian Jacob Vaage, claiming that the points from the ski jumping event for Thorleif Haug had been miscalculated, and that his final points should be behind Haugen’s. Vaage checked the case and had to agree with the 77-year-old Strømstad. In 1974 IOC decided to award the bronze medal to Haugen, at that time an elderly gentleman of 86. He was invited to Norway, and at a nice ceremony Haug’s bronze medal from 1924 was handed over to Haugen by Haug’s youngest daughter. Thorleif Haug himself died already in December 1934 from pneumonia at the age of 40. But Haugen was pleased to meet some of his Norwegian competitors from 1924: Narve Bonna, Einar Landvik and also Thoralf Strømstad, the man responsible for justice being made after 40 years.\n\n1952\n\nAmerica’s Ed Sanders created carnage in the heavyweight boxing division in Helsinki as he battered his way to the final with three brutal knockout victories. His opponent in the final, Sweden’s Ingemar Johansson, appeared to be completely intimidated by the American’s reputation and spent most of the fight backpedalling around the ring. When Sanders did get into range Johansson would simply grab hold of his opponent. Eventually an increasingly irate referee grew tired of warning the Swede and disqualified him for “not trying”. This also had the effect of denying Johansson his silver medal and the second step on the podium remained vacant.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIngemar Johansson, who waited almost three decades to receive his silver medal.\n\nJohansson did become a household name as a professional when he became the first European to win the World Heavyweight Championship for over 20 years after knocking out Olympic champion Floyd Patterson. In 1982, 30 years after his Olympic embarrassment, Johansson was finally awarded his silver medal after the IOC were persuaded to reverse their decision.\n\nBut Johansson was not the only boxer from 1952 to receive his medal late. In 1950, the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) had decided to eliminated the bronze medal match, having the losing finalists place an equal third. This was accepted by the IOC, on condition that they would not receive a bronze medal. This is indeed what happened in Helsinki.\n\nBut 1970, the president of the Finnish Boxing Association brought up the subject with AIBA, noting the absence of bronze medals in the boxing events to be an injustice. The AIBA President, Rudyard Russell, concurred and contacted the IOC. They received approval for the matter through IOC director Monique Berlioux, although no formal decision was made during an IOC Session. Six of the 20 losing semi-finalists received the medal in a ceremony in Finland on 2-3 April 1970, while the others received theirs in the mail.\n\n1964\n\nThe pair’s competition at the Innsbruck figure skating was won by the Soviet husband-wife pair of Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov, beating the favored German pair of Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler. Shortly after the Innsbruck Olympics, it was revealed that Kilius/Bäumler had signed a professional contract prior to the event to perform with Holiday on Ice. This should have disqualified them as professionals, but strangely no definite action was initially taken against them by the IOC or the International Skating Union.\n\nA few weeks later they won the World Championships, defeating Belousova and Protopopov. It was felt that the West German Olympic Committee, lobbying the IOC for the 1972 Olympic bid, wanted to present themselves in the best possible manner and encouraged the German skaters to return their medals. The IOC formed a special sub-committee to examine the case, and the minutes of the Executive Committee note, “A special sub-committee under Ivar Vind had studied the case of the German figure skaters. They had been found ‘non-amateurs’. Willi Daume said that ‘The German NOC will do what is necessary.’\n\nAt the 65th IOC session the IOC passed a resolution, which was printed in the Olympic Review, volume 95, page 39, from 15 August 1966 which stated, “We have received the silver medals back, and we will award them to the original third-place finishers. The bronze medals will be awarded to the original fourth-place finishers.” In January 1966, Kilius/Bäumler returned their silver medals to the IOC. Silver medals were awarded to Wilkes and Revell by Canadian IOC Member James Worrall during the 1967 Canadian Figure Skating Championships, while the Josephs received bronze medals from USOC President Tug Wilson at a small private ceremony at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, during the 1966 USA Figure Skating Championships. However, no action was ever taken by the ISU, who continued to list Kilius/Bäumler as silver medalists and World Champions in 1964.\n\nHowever, the controversy did not end there. In 1987, the German NOC rather surreptitiously requested the return of the silver medals to Kilius and Bäumler, which was in keeping with the ISU ruling as well. They asked the IOC to do this, stating that it was known that other skaters had signed similar contracts in that era. At the 1987 IOC Session in Istanbul, the IOC approved this request and the Germans received new silver medals on 5 December 1987, when German NOC president Willi Daume presented replicas of the originals to Kilius and Bäumler on the German television show “Sportstudio”.\n\nContacted in the late 90s, Debbi Wilkes and Vivian Joseph knew nothing of this, and still thought the German pair had been disqualified. Wilkes and Revell kept their silver medals, in fact, Revell’s medal was buried with him after his death, and the Josephs kept their bronze medals. Thus four silver medals were eventually awarded in this event. The IOC lists did not change the standings for many years, but recognizing that two sets of silver medals have been awarded in this event, now list Kilius/Bäumler and Wilkes/Revell as =2nd and as silver medalists, and have the Josephs in 3rd place with bronze medals. The ISU has never changed the original rankings, continuing to list Kilius/Bäumler 2nd, Wilkes/Revell 3rd, and the Josephs 4th.\n\n1968\n\nIn a similar case to the 1952 boxing, American featherweight Al Robinson was disqualified in the final against home fighter Antonio Roldán. In a dubious decision, Robinson was disqualified for head butting. As in 1952, this officially ruled him out of a silver medal. However, US officials protested the decision and Robinson received the medal after returning home. He did not enjoy it for long, as he fell into a coma during training in 1971, and eventually died three years later.\n\n1984\n\nThe women’s 100 m hurdles, severely hurt by the Soviet boycott, saw Benita Fitzgerald-Brown edge out Shirley Strong (GBR). Third-place was announced at first as a dead heat between Kim Turner (USA) and France’s Michele Chardonnet, but after reviewing photos of the finish, the judges reversed themselves and gave the bronze medal to Turner. But Chardonnet was not informed of this until she was standing on the infield awaiting the medal ceremony, and she left the field sobbing. The French Athletics Federation protested and 3½ months later the decision was reverted to a dead-heat. Chardonnet received her bronze medal six months after the Olympics ended.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nKim Turner (right) on her way to a shared bronze.\n\n1992\n\nCanadian Sylvie Fréchette, the 1991 World Champion and World Cup Champion was favored to win the women’s solo synchronized swimming event at the Barcelona Games. She was expected to be challenged by American Kristin Babb-Sprague, who was stronger in the freestyle final routine. Fréchette was expected to open a lead in the technical figures. But in that segment, Brazilian judge Maria de Silveira gave Fréchette an unaccountably low score of 8.7. De Silveira maintained that she had made a mistake and hit the wrong button, and meant to give her a score of 9.7. But the score could not be changed, per the FINA rules. The Canadians appealed the decision after the technical figures, but this was overturned 11-2, the two dissenting votes coming from the Canadian members of the Jury of Appeal. This let Babb-Sprague take the lead after the technical figures, and Fréchette was unable to overcome that lead, as Babb-Sprague seemingly won the gold medal.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nFréchette hugs Babb-Sprague from the silver medal section of the podium.\n\nBut that would not be the end of it. Dick Pound, powerful Canadian IOC Member, led a further appeal to have the results overturned. FINA eventually caved to the pressure and elected to declare Fréchette and Babb-Sprague as co-champions, and awarded Fréchette a gold medal in October 1993.\n\n2000\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nDong Fangxiao, who was only 14 years old at the time of the Sydney Olympics\n\nAs a member of the Chinese women’s gymnastics team at the Sydney Olympics, Dong Fangxiao earned a bronze medal. Eight years later, she was entered as an official for the Beijing Olympics. The birth information she used for that application – stating a birth year of 1986 – was different from the one used at the Sydney Games, when she claimed to have been born in 1983.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) launched an investigation, as a birth year of 1986 would have made Dong only 14 at the time of the Sydney Olympics, two years under the age limit of 16. The FIG concluded 1986 was Dong’s actual birth year, and disqualified her from the 2000 Games. The IOC went along with that verdict, and handed the bronze medal from the team all-around to the United States.\n\nAppearing on the cover of Vanity Fair last week, Caitlyn Jenner revealed her new identity and name to the world. She was previously known as Bruce Jenner, and was the 1976 Olympic decathlon champion. Probably the most famous transgender worldwide, Jenner’s definitely the most famous transgender Olympian. But is she also the first?\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nJenner after winning Olympic decathlon gold in 1976.\n\nThe answer is, as you might expect on this site, no. As far as we know, Jenner is the second transgender Olympian, the first one being Balian Buschbaum, who announced his gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Under the name Yvonne, Buschbaum had competed in the women’s pole vault at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The reigning European Junior Champion, she placed a credible sixth.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBuschbaum after winning a medal at the 2002 European Championships\n\nJenner and Buschbaum are not the only transgender athletes in history, of course. A few famous examples:\n\nIn the 1930s, Czechoslovakian middle distance runner Zdena Koubková, winner of the 800m at the 1934 Women’s World Games, underwent surgery to become Zdeněk Koubek.\n\nIn 1979, tennis player Renée Richards reached the third round of the US Open ladies’ singles, and semi-finals in mixed doubles. She had been born as Richard Raskind, and had competed in the men’s tournament in the 1950s. Richards had to go through a long legal battle before being allowed to play, but she achieved a landmark victory for transgender rights in sports.\n\n1986 European shot put champion Heidi Krieger (DDR) became Andreas in 1997, although this was heavily influenced by the immense doses of anabolic steroids that Krieger had received from the DDR doping program as an athlete.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAndreas Krieger, formerly known as shot putter Heidi Krieger.\n\nBoth Jenner and Buschbaum only underwent gender reassignment after their Olympic appearances. To our best knowledge, no Olympians have competed after transgender surgery. It may only be a matter of time before transgender athletes do compete, as transgender athletes are appearing in several sports, such as cyclists Natalie van Gogh (Netherlands) and Michelle Dumaresq (Canada). However, their involvement in sport is still controversial. Especially in the case of men becoming women, many perceive this as an unfair competitive advantage. While transgenders might have some physical advantages (such as a greater height), their hormone treatments actually puts them at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.\n\nA glimpse of the expected controversy of transgenders competing in the Olympics might be seen by looking at intersexual athletes. Often confused with transgenders, intersexuals have both male and female characteristics from birth. Some, but not all also decide to undergo surgery to become either a man or a woman. The history of intersexuals in the Olympics has been troublesome.\n\nPolish sprinter Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh), who won the 100 m at the 1932 Olympics, had on several occasions been accused of being a man. Upon her death, it was revealed she was a gynandromorph, implying normal external sexual characteristics, but mixed internal sexual organs. In many sources, however, this is (still) simplified to her being a man.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n1932 sprint champion Walasiewicz and 1936 champion Stephens.\n\nA contemporary of Walasiewciz, German high jumper Dora Ratjen, fourth at the 1936 Olympics, was “exposed” as a man after winning the 1938 European Championships. Ratjen was, in fact, intersexual, and had been raised as a girl. Ratjen did officially register as a man subsequently, under the name of Heinz.\n\nDue to suspicions that some (Eastern European) female athletes competing in the 1950s and 1960s were in fact men, the IOC and other sports federations introduced so- called “sex-tests”. Polish sprinter Ewa Kłobukowska, Olympic relay champion in 1964, was banned from sports in 1967 after failing the original IOC gender test (see below). Kłobukowska would have passed later versions of the test, and to prove her womanhood, she gave birth to a son in 1968.\n\nAnother noted victim of the sex tests was 1966 giant slalom champion Erika Schinegger. Prior to the Grenoble Winter Olympics, she failed a sex test due to being intersexual, and was not allowed to compete. Schinegger later officially became a man, Erik Schinegger.\n\nIn the 1990s, prompted among others by lawsuits by Spanish hurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño, most sports governing bodies abandoned the tests.\n\nThe whole concept of gender identity is a difficult one, both in sports and scientifically and psychologically in society, and in sports it has a long history. In the 1960s, concern about the problem of men posing as women to gain a competitive advantage led to the introduction of gender verification by the IOC, at the time called sex testing. Several female track & field athletes were then suspected of being genetically male.\n\nFrom 1968-88, all women wishing to compete in the Olympics were required to undergo sex testing, with one exception, that being Princess Anne of Great Britain, who competed in the 1976 Olympics in the equestrian events. Testing was initially done by obtaining a buccal smear, or a scraping of the cells of the inner wall of the mouth. The cells were examined for the presence of a Barr body, which occurs almost exclusively in females. Females are genetically labeled as XX, while men are labeled as XY, those being the classifications of the respective sex chromosomes. The second X chromosome possessed by women contains a structure termed the Barr body.\n\nThough some men did attempt to breach the rules and compete as women, the entire subject of mixed sexual characteristics is a highly complex and emotional one. A number of people with mixed sexual identity may have elected to compete as women for psychological reasons. In addition, doctors typically label babies with indeterminate genitalia as women. And in certain cases of mixed sex classification, some people who would be considered women lack a Barr body, and would thus have been disqualified.\n\nBecause of these problems, the test was later changed and the buccal smear no longer used. Women were then cleared for international competition by doctors after simply undergoing a physical examination. In the late 1980s, this method was replaced by a polymerase chain reaction evaluation, looking for the Y-linked SRY gene (sex-determining region Y), and this method was used at both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics\n\nBut problems still existed. It was noted that the test failed to exclude all potential impostors, was discriminatory against women with disorders of sexual development, and could be psychologically devastating for a female athlete failing such a test. Thus, during the 1996 IOC World Conference on Women and Health, the IOC passed a resolution “to discontinue the current process of gender verification during the Olympic Games.” The IOC Athletes’ Commission recommended to the IOC Executive Board in January 1999 that gender identification should be eliminated, and this decision was ratified by the IOC Executive Board in June 1999.\n\nHowever, the IOC Medical Commission addressed the issue of sex reassignment in 2003-2004. Their recommendations were approved by the IOC Executive Board in May 2004. The conclusions of this study were: 1) individuals undergoing sex reassignment of male to female before puberty should be regarded as girls and women (female); 2) individuals undergoing sex reassignment of female to male before puberty should be regarded as boys and men (male); 3) individuals undergoing sex reassignment from male to female after puberty (and vice versa) be eligible for participation in female or male competitions, respectively, under the following conditions: 3a) surgical anatomical changes have been completed, including external genitalia changes and gonadectomy; 3b) legal recognition of the assigned sex has been conferred by the appropriate official authorities; 3c) hormonal therapy appropriate for the assigned sex has been administered in a verifiable manner and for a sufficient length of time to minimize gender-related advantages in sport competitions; 3d) eligibility should begin no sooner than two years after gonadectomy; and 4) evaluation will occur on a confidential case-by-case basis.\n\nThe entire subject is very difficult, in many ways. Interestingly, Renée Richards, described above as playing on the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tour after changing to female gender, has come to believe that the IOC ruling is incorrect, and that men changing to women should not be allowed to compete at the highest levels of sport, because they could have an advantage. Of note, Richards is a medical doctor and likely understands all aspects of this discussion far better than anyone. See her interview and discussion on the topic here.\n\nAll these multiple administrative decisions paved the way for Brazilian judoka Edinanci Silva to compete in the Olympics from 1996 through 2008. Born intersexual, she underwent surgery to become a woman.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEdinanci da Silva after winning at the 2007 Pan American Games.\n\nBut the abolition of gender testing did not kill all controversy. In 2009, South African Castor Semenya won the women’s 800 m at the athletics World Championships. There were wild speculations about her being a man and/or having a genetic disorder. The IAAF responded non-tactfully and with a re-instated gender test, but her results were allowed to stand. Semenya went on to carry the South African flag at the opening of the 2012 Olympics, and won a silver medal in the event.\n\nLet’s hope that Caitlyn Jenner’s public transition will help future transgenders and intersexuals in being accepted as regular competitors.\n\nDutch cyclist Marianne Vos has announced that she will be focusing on mountain biking for the coming season, as she aims to win a gold medal in the cross-country in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Vos has already won gold medals in track cycling (2008) and road cycling (2012), and winning in mountain-biking would a third gold in a third cycling discipline. Has that been done before?\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMarianne Vos winning the road race in Londen 2012\n\nCombining cycling disciplines is not rare. Quite a few of today’s road racing stars – where most money is earned – have started out on the track or on a mountain-bike. And many of them have excelled in both, as there’s well over 400 cyclists who have competed in multiple disciplines at the Olympics.\n\nWinning medals in multiple disciplines is much rarer, although there are still 23 Olympians who have achieved this. All of them have done this in two disciplines – so Vos would be the first to do it in three. In all cases, the combination was between track cycling and road racing. Of these 23, 7 have won gold medals in both disciplines. (A full list of all track/road medallists follows below.)\n\nThe first time a cyclist won medals in more than one discipline was in 1906, when two Frenchmen, Fernand Vast and Maurice Bardonneau, won medals in both types of events. Women’s cycling was introduced at the Olympics only in 1984, but by 1992 two women had already doubled in cycling disciplines. On the podium of the Barcelona women’s 3,000 m individual pursuit, both silver medallist Kathy Watt and bronze medallist Rebecca Twigg had already won medals in road cycling. Only one cyclist has won multiple medals in multiple disciplines. This is Dutch cyclist Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel, who in 2000-2004 collected three golds on the road, while adding one of each color in track cycling.\n\nAlthough Vos is inexperienced in mountain-biking competition, her prospects of qualifying and winning (a medal) are not that bad. Vos is a 7-time world champion in cyclo-cross, a non-Olympic cycling discipline that features off-road racing with regular width tyres, as opposed to the “fat” MTB tyres.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMarianne Vos riding towards her seventh cyclo-cross world title\n\nBut even if Marianne Vos would fail to become the first cyclist to win (gold) medals in three cycling disciplines, she could still set a record by participating. Since the third (mountainbiking) and fourth (BMX) discipline have been added at the Olympics in 1996 and 2008 respectively, there have been several athletes to compete in one of these in addition to another cycling discipline, but so far no cyclist has competed in three.\n\n[table]\n\nCyclist,NOC,Years,Track Gold, Track Silver, Track Bronze, Road Gold, Road Silver, Road Bronze\n\nJudith Arndt,GER,1996-2012,0,0,1,0,2,0\n\nMaurice Bardonneau,FRA,1906,0,1,0,0,1,0\n\nChris Boardman,GBR,1992-1996,1,0,0,0,0,1\n\nJean Van Den Bosch,BEL,1924,0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nRobert Charpentier,FRA,1936,1,0,0,2,0,0\n\nBernd Dittert,GDR/GER,1988-1992,0,0,1,1,0,0\n\nJacques Dupont,FRA,1948,1,0,0,0,0,1\n\nJean Goujon,FRA,1936,1,0,0,1,0,0\n\nRik Hoevenaers,BEL,1924,0,0,1,0,2,0\n\nHenry Kaltenbrunn,RSA,1920,0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nGuy Lapébie,FRA,1936,1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nLeon Meredith,GBR,1908-1912,1,0,0,0,1,0\n\nFernand Saivé,BEL,1924,0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nOlga Slyusareva,RUS,2000-2004,1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nFrank Southall,GBR,1928-1932,0,0,1,0,2,0\n\nRebecca Twigg,USA,1984-1992,0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nFernand Vast,FRA,1906,0,0,2,1,0,0\n\nMichel Vermeulin,FRA,1956,0,1,0,1,0,0\n\nMarianne Vos,NED,2008-2012,1,0,0,1,0,0\n\nKathy Watt,AUS,1992,0,1,0,1,0,0\n\nBradley Wiggins,GBR,2000-2012,3,1,2,1,0,0\n\nVyacheslav Yekimov,RUS,1988-2004,1,0,0,2,0,0\n\nLeontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel,NED,2000-2004,1,1,1,3,0,0\n\n[/table]\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBradley Wiggins won his fourth Olympic cycling gold – and his first on the road – at the London 2012 Games\n\nOn the 14th of February, the 2015 Cricket World Cup got underway in Australia and New Zealand. It is the largest sporting event after the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, although it will be mainly followed in (former) members of the British Commonwealth. Cricket was an Olympic sport for only a single match, but connections between the two stretch from 1866 to 2012.\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nOur connection begins 30 years before the first modern Olympics, at the 1866 British National Olympic Games. These were in a large part the effort of William Penny Brookes. Brookes was also the founder of the Wenlock Olympian Games, first held in 1850 and still contested today.\n\nHeld at Crystal Palace, the National Olympic Games were a big success. The 440 yard hurdles event was won by an 18-year-old who had taken some time off from a cricket match: W.G. Grace.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMost cricket connaisseurs will need no further explanation, but for those not in the know, William Gilbert Grace, going by W.G. Grace, is one of the greatest cricketers of all time. The bearded legend is described well at CricInfo:\n\nThe statistics of his career are alone enough to explain why – more than 54,000 first-class runs (there are at least two different versions of the precise figure, so let’s leave it at that) spread across 44 seasons, including 839 in just eight days of 1876, when he hit a couple of triple-centuries, and only one other batsman managed to top a thousand runs in the entire season; a thousand in May in 1895, when he was nearly 47; and 2800-odd wickets costing less than 18 runs apiece.\n\nAn Olympic sport\n\nIn 1894, cricket’s association with the Olympics becomes much closer. At the time the IOC is founded, cricket is one of the few well-organized sports, and it is therefore not surprising that it ends up on the short-list of sports for the first Olympics in 1896.\n\nThe sport was however never held, no doubt hampered by the fact that Athens (or Greece, for that matter), lacked a wicket.\n\nThe first and only ever Olympic cricket match was held at the 1900 Games. Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands, were scheduled to send a team to France, each to play the host nation, but not each other. However, the Low Countries failed to send teams, leaving France v. Great Britain as the only match.\n\nGreat Britain (or England, as they were billed) was represented by the touring Devon and Somerset Wanderers, while the French team was made up of clubs that belonged to the Union des Sociétés Français de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA). Most of the “French” players were actually British expatriates living in France, and we’ve only been able to confirm three team members to be French.\n\nThe twelve-a-side match was not an exciting affair, the British side being far stronger, eventually winning by 158 runs (see the original scorecard as well as a match report). Most of the Olympic competitors were, as Ian Buchanan has put it “distinctly average club players”, with the exception of two Wanderers players: Montague Toller and Alfred Bowerman, who both played first-class cricket (that’s the top-level, three-days-or-more form of cricket).\n\nNo return to the Games\n\nThe closest cricket has ever got to making a return to the Olympic Games after its brief appearance in 1900 came four years later in the unlikely setting of St. Louis, Missouri. September 22 was due to see the start of a tournament to decide the “World’s Amateur Cricket Championships” but, a few weeks before it was due to begin, the event was cancelled due to a lack of available pitches. The only confirmed entry we know of came from the city of Philadelphia. The Philadelphians, who included America’s greatest ever cricketer Bart King, would have been rated alongside South Africa, England and Australia as the four best teams in the world at the time.\n\nTentative plans were made for a cricket tournament at the 1908 Rome Olympics. When Rome relinquished its right to hold the Games, London made no effort to follow through with these plans.\n\nSo far, cricket has never returned to the Olympics, although the short Twenty20 format seems an ideal candidate for this. Reasons for the sports non-inclusion are rumored to sit with the sport’s governing body ICC and its most powerful members. The ICC is recognized by the IOC.\n\nFirst-class Olympians\n\nToller and Bowerman, who played in 1900, are not the only Olympians to have played first-class cricket. We have identified at least 38 more Olympians with at least 1 first-class match. 24 of them competed at the Olympics in field hockey, which makes sense if you know that in Britain, cricket was only played in summer, with hockey or rugby being the winter-time activity.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBrian Booth batting for Australia\n\nOf these 40 first-class players, there are four who have also played in Test matches (first-class matches between countries that have been given Test status):\n\nBrian Booth played 29 Test matches for Australia (1961-66), after competing at the 1956 Olympics in hockey. He captained the team for two matches during the 1965-66 Ashes series.\n\nJohn Douglas played 23 Test matches for England (1911-25). In 1908, he won Olympic gold in the middleweight boxing division. He died tragically in a shipwreck off the Danish coast.\n\nClaude Buckenham contested 4 Test matches for England (1909-10), all in the English tour of South Africa in those years. Earlier, Buckenham had played football for Upton Park FC, which represented Britain in football at the 1900 Olympics, winning the Olympic “tournament”.\n\nJack MacBryan is credited with a single Test match for England. He played during a rain-plagued match against South Africa in 1924, where did not bowl, bat or dismiss anybody, while fielding for 66.5 overs. Four years earlier, he had won a gold medal in field hockey.\n\nCricket venues\n\nAs a final link between the Olympics and top class cricket, four cricket grounds have been used as an Olympic venue. This does not include the 1900 Olympics, as that match was held as the Vincennes velodrome.\n\nIn 1928, the demonstration sport of kaatsen (similar to the US version of handball and pelota) was held on the cricket grounds outside the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium. A much better known venue is the Melbourne Cricket Ground. At the 1956 Olympics, it was the main stadium, hosting the opening and closing ceremony, the track and field competitions, as well as matches in football and field hockey. Demonstration matches in baseball and Aussie rules football were also conducted at the MCG.\n\nFor the 2000 Olympics, several football matches were held in the stadium. The same occurred in Brisbane, where the Brisbane Cricket Ground served as the venue.\n\nThe most famous cricket ground in the world is Lord’s, which calls itself “The home of cricket”. With some right: it has been in use at its current location since 1814. At the 2012 Olympics, the archery competitions were held there.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe archery competitions at Lord’s."
