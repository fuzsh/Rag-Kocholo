        "text": "The Paris Olympic Games 2024 are upon us, quickly following the conclusion of the 2024 Tour de France. The road racing action begins with the men’s individual time trial on Saturday, 27 July. This event will feature the world’s best time trial riders competing for the coveted Olympic gold. The race takes place on a flat 32.4km out-and-back course from Invalides to Pont Alexandre III, passing through the picturesque Bois de Vincennes. Since its first appearance in the Olympics in 1912, the time trial has crowned many cycling legends, including South Africa’s Rudolph Lewis, Miguel Indurain, Fabian Cancellara, Bradley Wiggins, and Primož Roglič. This year, the elite riders are ready to add their names to this illustrious list at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nThe 2024 Olympic time trial marks a historic first, as men and women will compete on the same course over an equal distance. This event features a carefully curated route that promises both a scenic and challenging experience. Riders will embark on a 32.4km loop that starts and finishes at Pont Alexandre III, Paris’s most opulent bridge.\n\nFrom the golden expanse of Pont Alexandre III, the route heads eastward along the south bank, or rive gauche, and ventures into the verdant Bois de Vincennes. Cyclists will encounter the bells of Notre Dame twice along their path, and if they momentarily glance from their focused positions, they’ll catch glimpses of significant Parisian landmarks: the towering column of Place de la Bastille, the historic Château de Vincennes, and the outdoor Vélodrome Jacques Anquetil, a venue for the 1900 and 1924 Games.\n\nDesigned as a pure test of speed, this course is ideal for riders with powerful engines. It features minimal elevation change, with only 150 meters of minor undulations and few obstacles. The primary challenges include the winding paths through the Vincennes Forest and the slippery metal manhole covers scattered across the city’s streets. Notably, at 32.4km, this will be the shortest Olympic time trial ever for men, a significant reduction from the 320km distance of the inaugural men’s Olympic time trial in 1912.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: Men’s Individual Time Trial Map & Profile\n\nParis Olympics 2024: Men’s Individual Time Trial Contenders\n\nRemco Evenepoel (Belgium)\n\nRemco Evenepoel, the reigning world time trial champion, is a top contender for Olympic gold. The Belgian cyclist heads to the Games after his debut Tour de France, where he finished third overall. Notably, he secured a third place in the hilly time trial over La Turbie and the Col d’Eze and clinched a stage win at the mid-race time trial in Gevrey-Chambertin on a flatter course.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Evenepoel demonstrated his time trial prowess by winning the flat 22km time trial at the Volta ao Algarve and the rolling 34km test at the Critérium du Dauphiné. His victory at the World Championships came on a predominantly flat 48km course, proving his capability on the Olympic terrain.\n\nDespite his extensive race schedule, Evenepoel’s main challenge might be maintaining freshness compared to competitors who skipped the Tour de France. However, his consistent performance and recent achievements make him a strong candidate for a podium finish in Paris.\n\nFilippo Ganna (Italy)\n\nFilippo Ganna, a two-time world time trial champion and the current Italian time trial champion, is another top pick for Olympic success. Although he hasn’t been as dominant in recent times, Ganna’s experience and strategic preparation for the Games give him a solid chance.\n\nIn Tokyo 2020, Ganna narrowly missed out on a medal, finishing fifth. This year, he has prepared quietly, competing in the four-day Tour of Austria and securing a stage victory on the final day. His season has been geared towards Paris, where he will also participate in the road race and defend Italy’s team pursuit gold on the track.\n\nGanna’s 2024 highlights include victories at the Giro d’Italia and the Italian Championships, along with several second-place finishes in time trials. His targeted approach and proven ability on the big stage make him a formidable contender for a medal in Paris.\n\nBrandon McNulty (USA)\n\nBrandon McNulty of the USA is a rising star in the time trial discipline. With three victories in 2024, he matches Evenepoel’s tally, having won at the UAE Tour, Tour de Romandie, and the US Nationals. His consistent performance positions him as a strong medal hope for the USA.\n\nMcNulty’s best time trial result came with a fourth place at the 2023 World Championships on a 48km course. While he participated in the road race at the Tokyo Olympics, this will be his first time trial appearance at the Games. His primary focus this season has been the Paris Olympics, ensuring he is well-rested and prepared.\n\nMcNulty’s strategic season planning and recent successes suggest he will be a key player in the time trial, with a realistic chance of securing a top finish.\n\nJosh Tarling (Great Britain)\n\nJosh Tarling, Great Britain’s latest time trial sensation, has quickly established himself as a top competitor in the discipline. At just 20 years old, Tarling has already achieved significant success, including a podium at the Etoile de Bessèges time trial and wins at the European Championships and Chrono des Nations.\n\nTarling’s standout performances in 2024 include defending his national title and claiming elite bronze at the World Championships. His rapid ascent and strong results against seasoned competitors indicate his potential to excel at the Olympics.\n\nWith a light racing schedule this summer, Tarling will arrive in Paris fresh and ready to make his Olympic debut. His ability to perform under pressure and previous successes suggest he could be a surprise medal contender.\n\nStefan Küng (Switzerland)\n\nStefan Küng, a veteran time triallist with 20 career wins, is known for his near-misses on big occasions. In Tokyo 2020, he finished fourth, narrowly missing out on a medal. His impressive record includes multiple top-10 finishes in the Tour de France time trials and podiums at the World Championships.\n\nKüng’s sole time trial victory in 2024 came at the Swiss Nationals, where he bested his Paris teammate Stefan Bissegger. After a gruelling Tour de France, where he finished 10th in the hilly time trial, Küng will be highly motivated to secure a medal in Paris.\n\nAt 30, this may be Küng’s last Olympic appearance, making him determined to overcome previous disappointments and achieve a podium finish.\n\nMagnus Sheffield (USA)\n\nMagnus Sheffield, a promising young rider from the USA, has shown considerable potential in time trials. His breakthrough came in 2024 with impressive performances, including a win at the Tour de Romandie time trial ahead of his more experienced teammate Brandon McNulty.\n\nSheffield’s ability to deliver strong results in high-pressure situations, combined with his rapid development, makes him a dark horse for the Olympic time trial medals. While he lacks extensive Olympic experience, his recent form suggests he could be a surprise contender.\n\nAs a fresh face on the international scene, Sheffield’s youthful energy and determination could propel him to a standout performance in Paris.\n\nWout van Aert (Belgium)\n\nWout van Aert, a versatile rider known for his strength in both time trials and road races, is another key contender. Despite not being at his peak during the Tour de France, van Aert’s extensive race experience and ability to recover quickly make him a formidable opponent.\n\nIn 2024, van Aert has demonstrated his time trial capabilities with several top-10 finishes and a strong overall performance in various stages. His experience in major competitions and adaptability to different race conditions give him a solid chance in the Olympic time trial.\n\nVan Aert’s preparation and strategic approach will be crucial in determining his success in Paris. His ability to perform well under pressure makes him a strong candidate for a podium finish.\n\nKévin Vauquelin (France)\n\nKévin Vauquelin, the home favourite from France, has steadily risen through the ranks in the time trial discipline. In 2024, he secured notable results, including a win at the French National Championships, showcasing his potential on the international stage.\n\nVauquelin’s familiarity with the course and home crowd support could give him an added advantage. His recent performances suggest he is peaking at the right time, making him a strong contender for a top finish.\n\nAs a relatively new face in the time trial scene, Vauquelin’s determination and home advantage could lead to a standout performance at the Paris Olympics. His potential to surprise the established favourites adds an exciting dynamic to the competition.\n\nThe men’s individual time trial at the 2024 Paris Olympics promises to be a thrilling contest, with a mix of seasoned champions and emerging talents vying for glory. The flat course will test their speed and endurance, making for an exciting and unpredictable race."
