These current topics are viewed against the backdrop of the requirements of effective access to justice and the overall goal of establishing a sustainable civil justice system in Europe.\n\nWith perspectives from an impressive selection of contributors \"Frontiers in Civil Justice: Privatisation, Monetisation and Digitisation\" takes on a pan-European perspective and zooms in on several European jurisdictions, thereby providing a holistic exploration of current civil justice debates and frontiers. It includes chapters dedicated to the interaction between public and private justice, the digitisation of both private dispute resolution and court litigation, including the rapid development and use of advanced forms of Artificial Intelligence, and the funding of justice, especially collective actions and settlements by means of private funding and common funds.\n\nAddressing these key issues in the current European debate on civil justice, \"Frontiers in Civil Justice: Privatisation, Monetisation and Digitisation\" will be an ideal read for academics and policy makers interested in the most recent frontier developments and innovations. Legal practitioners will also benefit from the insight into complex topics such as litigation funding, legal conflicts in a digital age, and resolving disputes in a private setting.\n\nCritique: Comprised of an informative Introduction and thirteen erudite essays deftly organized into three major sections (ADR and the Courts; Digitising Private and Public Justice; Collectivising and Monetising Civil Litigation), \"Frontiers in Civil Justice: Privatisation, Monetisation and Digitisation\" is unreservedly recommended as a core addition to personal, professional, and academic library International Law collections and supplemental Contemporary Judicial curriculum studies lists.\n\nEditorial Note #1: Xandra Kramer (http://www.xandrakramer.eu) is Professor of Private Law, Erasmus School of Law, Erasmus University Rotterdam and Professor of Private International Law, Utrecht University.\n\nEditorial Note #2: Jos Hoevenaars, Betul Kas and Erlis Themeli are Postdoc Researchers, Erasmus School of Law, Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nIn Their Names\n\nLenore Anderson\n\nThe New Press\n\n120 Wall Street, Floor 31, New York, NY 10005\n\nwww.thenewpress.com\n\n9781620977125, $28.99, HC, 352pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Their-Names-Untold-Victims-Incarceration/dp/1620977125\n\nSynopsis: When twenty-six-year-old recent college graduate Aswad Thomas was days away from starting a professional basketball career in 2009, he was shot twice while buying juice at a convenience store. The trauma left him in excruciating pain, with mounting medical debt, and struggling to cope with deep anxiety and fear. That was the same year the national incarceration rate peaked. Yet, despite thousands of new tough-on-crime policies and billions of new dollars pumped into \"justice\", Aswad never received victim compensation, support, or even basic levels of concern. In the name of victims, justice bureaucracies ballooned while most victims remained on their own.\n\nWith the publication of \"In Their Names: The Untold Story of Victims' Rights, Mass Incarceration, and the Future of Public Safety, Lenore Anderson (president of one of the nation's largest reform advocacy organizations) offers a close look at how the political call to help victims in the 1980s morphed into a demand for bigger bureaucracies and more incarceration, and cemented the long- standing chasm that exists between most victims and the justice system.\n\nShe argues that the powerful myth that mass incarceration benefits victims obscures recognition of what most victims actually need, including addressing their trauma, which is a leading cause of subsequent violent crime.\n\nA solutions-oriented, paradigm-shifting volume, \"In Their Names\" argues persuasively for closing the gap between our public safety systems and crime survivors.\n\nCritique: A timely and appreciated contribution to our national dialogue on crime (which has been increasing these past few years), incarceration, and the impact on the victims of crime, \"In Their Names: The Untold Story of Victims' Rights, Mass Incarceration, and the Future of Public Safety\" is an especially and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, professional, community, and academic library Contemporary Criminology Studies collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists. It should be noted for criminology students, academia, legal justice reformers, victim advocates, governmental policy makers, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"In Their Names: The Untold Story of Victims' Rights, Mass Incarceration, and the Future of Public Safety\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $15.65).\n\nEditorial Note: A former punk drummer turned prosecutor, Lenore Anderson is the founder and president of the Alliance for Safety and Justice. She is a former chief of policy at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, former director of public safety for the Oakland mayor, and the recipient of a James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award and a Frank Carrington Crime Victim Attorney Award.

Wow! VA?! Just the two of you? Did you fight a lot?\"\n\nConversations Across America: A Father and Son, Alzheimer's, and 300 Conversations Along the TransAmerica Bike Trail that Capture the Soul of America follows a father/son cycling journey undertaken in 2015 by a 75-year-old father with early-stage Alzheimer's and his adult son. It's remarkable not just for the physical effort, but for the mental revelations that accompanied and affected their relationship as the miles and time passed. The effort afforded father and son both a long goodbye and new observations of 2015 America through conversations with ordinary Americans from all walks of life.\n\nThree decades of a shared dream culminated in an experience that broadened the lives of both participants, leading them into new territory both in their relationship and in their perception of a changing nation. Their epic adventure will attract a wider audience than the usual father/son memoir, Alzheimer's reader, or cyclist adventure bookworm.\n\nPacked with photos of the two cyclists as their journey evolved, as well as the individuals they encountered and write about, readers ride through the concurrent transitions of different parts of the American psyche and the interactions and efforts of father and son as they connect with one another and those around them.\n\nThis concurrent gift of revelation both personal and social examination makes for a journey like few others: a testimony to love, perseverance, understanding, and experience that captures the real reason for undertaking a road trip -- to live life at its fullest, experience surprises, and ultimately cultivate deeper understanding.\n\nThe quotes, visual reinforcement, and opportunity to visit, via this book, the byroads of America and taste the values and beliefs of a disparate population make for an immersive experience highly recommended for audiences beyond the usual memoir reader alone. Ideally, Conversations Across America will be chosen by book clubs interested in discussing a variety of topics, from early-stage Alzheimer's to worldviews and emotional connections from all walks of life. Its conversations capture the purposes and perspectives of ordinary Americans and how they live their lives with gusto.\n\nThe Education Shelf\n\nTeaching Kids to Pause, Cope, and Connect\n\nMark Purcell, Psy.D\n\nKellen Glinder, MD\n\nFree Spirit Publishing\n\n6325 Sandburg Road, Suite 100, Minneapolis, MN 55427-3674\n\nwww.freespirit.com\n\n9781631983474, $34.99, PB, 198pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Kids-Pause-Cope-Connect/dp/1631983474\n\nSynopsis: Elementary school students today face many challenges that did not exist a generation or two ago, and rates of emotional disorders (including anxiety and depression) have increased steadily over the years. Students must also manage an overwhelming amount of information. With today's reliance on technology and social media, they have fewer opportunities to develop effective self-regulation strategies and interpersonal and stress management skills.\n\nHelping students understand their emotions and behavior when they're young will set them on a path to being successful learners and empathetic people throughout their lives. Comprised of thirty easy-to-implement, skill-based lessons and activities for grades 3-6, \"Teaching Kids to Pause, Cope, and Connect: Lessons for Social Emotional Learning and Mindfulness\" provides educators with strategies to help students: Manage and reduce their anxiety with healthy coping skills; Understand and regulate physical responses to stress; Separate emotions from actions; Respond mindfully (rather than impulsively) to difficult situations; Improve social skills, social awareness, and self-regulation; Develop empathy and compassion.\n\nDigital content includes reproducible student handouts that accompany each lesson, plus six bonus lessons.\n\nCritique: An ideal and unreservedly recommended elementary school curriculum development resource, \"Teaching Kids to Pause, Cope, and Connect: Lessons for Social Emotional Learning and Mindfulness\" is highly recommended for school district and academic library In-Service Training curriculums and college/university library Teacher Education collections. It should be noted that \"Teaching Kids to Pause, Cope, and Connect: Lessons for Social Emotional Learning and Mindfulness\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $33.24).\n\nEditorial Note: Mark Purcell, Psy.D., (www.drmarkpurcell.com) is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating children and families with emotional regulation challenges.

As a result, educators were called to reimagine the field of education as the curtain closed on the first quarter of the 21st century.\n\nThe essays comprising \"Equity in the Classroom: Essays on Curricular and Pedagogical Approaches to Empowering All Students\" challenge classroom instructors to consider new approaches to education theory, classroom praxis and teaching content.

Mealy and Heather Bennett, delivers innovative curricular approaches to STEM education, the Humanities and applied theater. The authors offer methods for empowering student voices, managing moments of crisis, increasing representation in computer science and implementing restorative justice disciplinary practices in learning institutions. These essays provide all educators with proven instructional models for curricular equity with the goal of moving America closer to a multicultural democracy.\n\nCritique: Along with an informative Introduction by the two editors, \"Equity in the Classroom: Essays on Curricular and Pedagogical Approaches to Empowering All Students\" is a compendium of thirteen deftly crafted contributions by experts.

That they are diminishing in importance because most Americans don't see the point of them. Americans don't understand why anyone would study literature or history or the classics (or, more contemporarily, feminist criticism, whiteness studies, or the literature of postcolonial states) when they can get an engineering or business degree that will lead to higher incomes and standards of living.\n\nEven more concerning is when they read how \"Western civilization\" has become a term\n\nof reproach at so many supposedly thoughtful institutions; or how fanatical political correctness works hard to silence alternative viewpoints; or, more generally, how liberal studies have become scattered, narrow, and small. In this atmosphere, it's hard to convince parents or their progeny that a liberal education is all that wonderful or that it's even worthy of respect.\n\nOver sixty years ago, we were introduced to the idea of \"the two cultures\" in higher education -- that is, the growing rift in the academy between the humanities and the sciences, a rift wherein neither side understood the other, spoke to the other, or cared for the other. But this divide in the academy, real as it may be, is nothing compared to another great divide -- the rift today between our common American culture and the culture of the academy itself.\n\nSo, how can we rebuild the notion that a liberal education is truly of value, both to our students and to the nation? Our highest hopes may be not to \"restore\" the liberal arts to what they looked like fifty or a hundred years ago but to ask ourselves what a true contemporary American liberal education at its best might look like. Remedying this situation will involve knowing clearly where we wish to go and then understanding how we might get there.\n\nFor those objectives, \"The Death of Learning: How American Education Has Failed Our Students and What to Do about It\" is meant to be the beginning.\n\nCritique: Thoughtful and thought-provoking, \"The Death of Learning: How American Education Has Failed Our Students and What to Do about It\" is an extraordinary alert to what is happening in colleges and universities today. While especially and unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, and academic library Education History and Philosophy collections, it should be noted for the personal reading lists of students, academia, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"The Death of Learning: How American Education Has Failed Our Students and What to Do about It\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $9.99) and as a complete and unabridged audio book (Blackstone Audio, 9798200993789, $31.95, CD).\n\nEditorial Note: John Agresto has taught at the University of Toronto, Kenyon College, Duke University, Wabash College, and the New School University. He was a scholar at the National Humanities Center in North Carolina and later served in senior positions at the National Endowment for the Humanities. He was president of St. John's College in Santa Fe for 11 years.\n\nIn 2003, Professor Agresto went to Iraq as the Senior Advisor for Higher Education and Scientific Research for the Coalition Provisional Authority.

Subjects are brought together and explored under \"big ideas\" and, crucially, the emphasis is on avoiding the superficial and trivial and rooting teaching in extending and challenging children.\n\n\"A Curious Curriculum\" also shares the story of one multi-academy trust (MAT) which designed and delivered a shared educational vision, a rationale for excellence in the curriculum, and the resources and support given to help reduce teachers' workload.\n\n\"A Curious Curriculum\" presents a clear model both for supporting a group of schools or leading one school, offering a fresh perspective on working on a MAT-wide curriculum, as well as providing a range of snapshot examples of the curriculum in action -- in the form of documents, plans, photos and the learners' own work. Furthermore, \"A Curious Curriculum\" shares transferrable lessons from the trust's journey to success, setting out an educational philosophy that pairs pedagogy with a well-structured curriculum designed with learners' best interests at its heart.\n\nAll school children deserve an engaging, exciting curriculum designed to spark their curiosity, feed their imagination and develop their skills and knowledge. With clear timelines and an honest and transparent dialogue about the challenges and benefits of working together collaboratively and the importance of external expertise, \"A Curious Curriculum\" is an essential read for all school leaders.\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well written, organized and presented, and an ideal textbook for school district in-service training programs and college/university teacher education curriculums, \"A Curious Curriculum: Teaching Foundation Subjects Well\" is unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, school district, and academic library Teacher Education & Curriculum Development collections. It should be noted for teacher education students, academia, classroom teachers K-12, school district administrators, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"A Curious Curriculum: Teaching Foundation Subjects Well\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $33.20).\n\nEditorial Note #1: Claire Banks (https://www.crownhouse.co.uk/claire-banks) was a head teacher for nine years in an inner-city primary school and then became Director of Education for The Olympus Academy Trust, a cross-phase multi-academy trust in north Bristol.

Crusade\n\nBilly Lombardo\n\nhttps://www.billylombardoauthor.com\n\nMuse Literary\n\nhttps://museliterary.com\n\n9781958714140, $10.99 Paper/$2.99 ebook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/C-P-Crusade-Application-Personal/dp/1958714143\n\nMany books for teens and college applicants discuss the application form, SATs, and other influencers on college acceptance, but The C.A.P.E. Crusade: Your Guide to a Great College Application Personal Essay narrows the focus to what often proves the determining factor between acceptance and rejection - the essay.\n\nWhile it can be said that this, too, is a subject covered elsewhere, what sets Billy Lombardo's title apart from others is its attention to injecting some of the excitement and potential into the effort, which will inspire students to write their best. Lombardo emphasizes his different approach from the beginning, presenting his view of how and why a student essay should not assume the regimented formula approach that other books too often recommend. With this encouragement in mind, students are led into the world of college essay writing with a different, more creative mindset that remains open to all possibilities of subject and presentation.\n\nPre-writing exercises, examples of topics designed to get students testing their skills and hand at writing tasks, and advice tailored to encouraging creative inspiration over regimented requirements adds to this process by encouraging students to set pen to paper and free flow with creative responses: \"Obsess over word count now, and I guarantee that you'll never get to the discoveries necessary for a great essay. Imagine that you're secretly competing with your classmates to write a ten-thousand-word discovery draft. If you come back to shore with more than ten thousand words, we'll sift through the flotsam and jetsam and worry about the word count later.\"\n\nThe C.A.P.E. Crusade is filled with good advice, inspirational and motivating lessons, and cautions about the kinds of input that reduces rather than accents creativity and good writing. The result is a highly inspirational, motivating, different college application advice title filled with rich exercises and examples of work well-done. Billy Lombardo admits from the start that he never had to write such an essay to gain entry into college, and never even took a SAT. What he did do was hone the approaches to writing that support creative efforts and ultimately lend to outstanding results.\n\nAny library strong in recommendations for college-bound students, as well as creative writing sources for inspiring essay writing, will find The C.A.P.E. Crusade a standout and a winner for not only its encouraging approach, but its specific contrasts between what makes for staid and dull writing and the contents of great prose.\n\nThe Science Shelf\n\nRoadside Geology of Hawaii, second edition\n\nRick Hazlett, author\n\nCheryl Gansecki, author\n\nSteve Lundblad, author\n\nMountain Press Publishing Company\n\nPO Box 2399, Missoula, MT 59806\n\nwww.mountain-press.com\n\n9780878427116, $26.00, PB, 336pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Geology-Hawaii/dp/0878427112\n\nSynopsis: Now in a completely revised and expanded full-color second edition of \"Roadside Geology of Hawai'i\", the team of collaborative authors Rick Hazlett, Cheryl Gansecki, and Steve Lundblad informatively detail the evolution of this volcanic island chain, from its first tumultuous appearance above the sea to ongoing eruptions, including the 2018 eruption of K lauea.\n\nErosional landscapes dominate the older islands, such as Waimea Canyon on Kaua'i, enormous rounded rocks at Garden of the Gods on L na'i, and the highest shoreline cliff in the world on Molokai, the scarp of the Wailau landslide. Volcanoes, cinder cones, and craters dominate the younger islands, from Haleakal Volcano on Maui and Diamond Head and Koko Craters on O'ahu to the active caldera in the Big Island's Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.\n\nWith \"Roadside Geology of Hawaii\" as a guide, native residents and tourists alike will discover waterfalls, lava tube caves, black sand beaches, and other world-famous geologic features around every bend in the road.\n\nCritique: Beautifully and profusely illustrated in full color throughout, this new second edition of \"Roadside Geology of Hawaii\" is particularly timely given the current volcanic eruption taking place.

Their dynamism and resilience helped fuse the cultures of Asia, Europe, and Africa, from the Himalayas to the Sahara, absorbing whatever impressed them, from Mongol armor to Persian tile work.\n\nAlongside their essential rigor, they enjoyed the finer aspects of life: in music, cuisine, and art, unafraid, even as rugged fighters, to display their love of flowers and gardens, especially tulips and roses. Behind the fine robes, carpets, and ceramics on display today in their great architectural monuments, Istanbul's Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia, lie centuries of migration, trade, and struggle.\n\nAn original and beautifully illustrated volume, \"The Ottomans: A Cultural Legacy\" reveals a radically new picture of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well researched, written, organized and presented, \"The Ottomans: A Cultural Legacy\" by Diana Darke is informative enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of a four page Select Bibliography, five pages of Notes, a one page listing for Sources of Illustrations, and a three page Index. \"The Ottomans: A Cultural Legacy\" is an impressive and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, professional, community, and academic library Ottoman History collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists.\n\nEditorial Note: Diana Darke (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Darke) is the author of Stealing from the Saracens: How Islamic Architecture Shaped Europe, which was one of BBC History Magazine's best books of 2020.

The Pictish heartland of Fortriu, previously thought to be centred on Perthshire and the Tay found itself relocated through the forensic work of archaeologist Alex Woolf to the shores of the Moray Firth. The implications for our understanding of this period and for the formation of Scotland are unprecedented and still being worked through.\n\n\"The King in the North: The Pictish Realms of Fortriu and Ce\" by Gordon Noble (and edited by Nicholas Evans) is the first account of this northern heartland of Pictavia for the non-specialist reader with an interest in the subject to take in the full implications of this and of the substantial recent archaeological work that has been undertaken in recent years.\n\nPart of the The Northern Picts project at Aberdeen University, \"The King in the North: The Pictish Realms of Fortriu and Ce\" represents an exciting cross disciplinary approach to the study of this still too little understood yet formative period in Scotland's history.\n\nCritique: Nicely illustrated throughout, \"The King in the North: The Pictish Realms of Fortriu and Ce\" is comprised of nine informative essays, plates, figures, a list of Abbreviations, Acknowledgments, a seven page listing of Sites To Visit, a twenty-one page listing of References, and a six page Index. Exceptionally well organized and presented, \"The King in the North: The Pictish Realms of Fortriu and Ce\" is a singularly recommended addition to personal, professional, college and university library Scottish Archaeology & History collections.

The usurpations of Phocas and Heraclius led to the collapse of the Roman defenses; The Persians conquered Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt; The Avars and Slavs ravaged the Balkans; The Lombards held the upper hand in Italy; the Visigoths conquered Spain; But then happened one of the most remarkable reversals of fortune in the history of mankind. Heraclius began his holy war against the fire-worshippers. He launched a very effective counterattack against the Persians as a result of which the Romans not only defeated the Persians but actually even extended their domains at their expense, and not only this, because by 633 Heraclius was already restoring the Roman fortunes in the Balkans.\n\n\"Military History of Late Rome 602-641\" revises many of the previously held views of how this took place and what actually happened. The Roman armies seemed invincible and then happened yet another great reversal of fortune -- the Muslims began their jihad to conquer the world.\n\nAuthor Ilkka Syvanne provides a fresh analysis of all of these upheavals; explaining in detail why these reversals of fortune happened; what enabled the Romans to defeat the Persians; and why the Romans lost when they fought against the Muslims and, conversely, why the Muslims were so successful.\n\nThis was an era of epic campaigns and battles all of which are explained in unprecedented detail. The epic campaigns needed equally talented commanders who include, for example, Heraclius, Chosroes II Parwez, Shahrbaraz, Shahin, Abu Bakr, Umar, Abu Ubaydah, and Khalid b. al-Walid, the Sword of Allah.\n\nCritique: Part of the seven volume 'Military History of Ancient Rome' series from Pen & Sword Books, \"Military History of Late Rome 602-641\" is informative enhanced with the inclusion of color plates, b/w illustrations, maps, three appendices, forty-two pages of Notes, a six page Bibliography, and an eight page Index. A fascinating, informative, thoughtful and thought-provoking history, \"Military History of Late Rome 602-641\" is exceptionally well written, comprehensively detailed and documented. While a critically important addition to personal, professional, community, and academic library Roman History collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists, \"Military History of Late Rome 602-641\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $32.99).\n\nEditorial Note: Currently residing in Kangasala, Finland, Ilkka Syv nne gained his doctorate in history in 2004 from the University of Tampere in his native Finland.

But the soldiers proceeded nonetheless, because a higher cause was at stake.\n\n\"The Greatest Military Mission Stories Ever Told\" by award-winning editor and writer Tom McCarthy is stunning collection of war stories and a tribute to the courage, steely resolve, and discipline of men who accomplished daunting missions in the face of almost certain death. Nonetheless, they stepped into the breach and performed heroically. That was their duty and they did not question. They had a mission and they accepted.\n\n\"The Greatest Military Mission Stories Ever Told\" is comprised of ten powerful stories of American soldiers and sailors that span more than 200 years of action with one common theme, summed up succinctly a participant who took control of Omaha Beach on D-Day, 1944.\n\nFrom Marines taking Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi or defending Khe San, Navy pilots taking to the air to defend Pearl Harbor, or an outnumbered American regiment in Korea defeating the Chinese at the Battle of Chipyong-ni, courage was the common watchword, death the common consequence. Such is the lot of soldiers everywhere.\n\n\"The Greatest Military Mission Stories Ever Told\" is also a not-so-gentle reminder of the price of freedom that was paid by American men for more than 200 years of struggle, from the Revolutionary War, the Spanish-American War, Civil War, World War II, Korea, and Viet Nam.\n\nCritique: Also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $17.63), and unreservedly recommended for the personal reading lists of all dedicated military history buffs, \"The Greatest Military Mission Stories Ever Told\" is an inherently engaging and core addition to personal, professional, community, college, and university library American Military History collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists.\n\nBloody Verrieres\n\nArthur W. Gullaghsen\n\nCasemate Publishers\n\n1940 Lawrence Road, Havertown, PA 19083\n\nwww.casematepublishers.com\n\n9781636240947, $37.95, HC, 288pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Verri%C3%A8res-Verri%C3%A8res-Bourguebus-Tilly-Camp agne/dp/1636240941\n\nSynopsis: South of the Norman city of Caen, Verrieres Ridge was seen a key stepping-stone for the British Second Army if it was to break out of the Normandy bridgehead in late July 1944. Imposing in height and containing perfect terrain for armored operations, the Germans viewed it as the lynchpin to their defenses south of the city of Caen and east of the Orne river.\n\nFollowing the failure of British Operation Goodwood on 18-20 July and the containment of the Canadian Operation Atlantic, further Allied attacks to seize the ridge would have to defeat arguably the strongest German armored formation in Normandy: The I. SS-Panzerkorps 'Leibstandarte.'\n\n\"Bloody Verrieres: The I. SS-Panzerkorps Defence of the Verrieres-Bourguebus Ridges: Volume II: The Defeat of Operation Spring and the Battles of Tilly-la-Campagne, 23 July - 5 August 1944\" by Professor Arthur W. Gullachsen is the second volume of a two-volume military history, that chronicles in detail the premier Anglo-Canadian operation to capture Verrieres Ridge, Operation Spring on 25 July. Designed as an attack to seize the ridge and exploit south with armor, this battle saw the 2nd Canadian Corps attack savaged again by German armored reserves brought in specifically to defeat another Goodwood.\n\nNot satisfied with this defensive victory, German armored forces would then seek to restore an earlier defensive line further north, attacking to destroy the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. Largely unknown, these were some of the strongest and most successful German armored operations to take place in the Normandy campaign.\n\nCritique: An invaluable and superbly researched contribution to personal, professional, community, and academic library World War II European Theatre histories, \"Bloody Verrieres: The I. SS-Panzerkorps Defence of the Verrieres-Bourguebus Ridges: Volume II: The Defeat of Operation Spring and the Battles of Tilly-la-Campagne, 23 July - 5 August 1944\" is informatively enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of a six page Bibliography, eighteen pages of Endnotes, a Glossary, a listing of Rank Equivalents, and an eleven page Index. It should be noted for students, academia, military history buffs, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"Blood Verrieres\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $22.95).\n\nEditorial Note: Arthur W.

Since it first flew in prototype form on 23 August 1954, more than 2,100 have been produced in over eighty different versions. Across its variants, the Hercules serves more than sixty air forces, as well as many civilian cargo operators, in a multiplicity of roles, including air-to-air refueller, gunship, airborne command post, flying hospital and fire-fighter.\n\nThis rugged and easily maintained aircraft entered service in 1956 with the USAF Tactical Air Command. Ten years later the 'Charlie 130' was providing essential logistical support in Vietnam. This period in South-East Asia was the Hercules' finest hour. Paradrops, airlift and evacuation operations were completed around the clock, often at low level, usually under fire and nearly always in bad weather.\n\nA generation later this 'Mr Dependable' was serving with equal distinction in the Gulf War in the role of airlifter, radio-countermeasures and 'psy-ops' platform, gunship and, once again, 'block-buster bomber'. The 'Herky Bird' or 'Fat Albert', as the C-130 is fondly known, has proved a key component in humanitarian relief operations ever since, in all parts of the world.\n\nThe incredible success story of the C-130 is far from over. With the publication of \"C-130 Hercules: A History\", military aviation historian Martin W. Bowman tells the full story of this remarkable aircraft at first-hand.\n\nCritique: Profusely illustrated with b/w photography throughout, \"C-130 Hercules: A History\" is a welcome and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, professional, community, and academic library American Military Aviation collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists. Exception in organization and presentation, \"C-130 Hercules: A History\" is a comprehensive and detailed history that is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $2.99) for students, academia, military buffs, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject.\n\nEditorial Note: Martin Bowman is one of Britain's leading aviation authors and has written a great deal of books focussing on aspects of Second World War aviation history. He lives in Norwich in Norfolk. He is the author of many Pen and Sword Aviation titles, including all releases in the exhaustive Air War D-Day and Air War Market Garden series.\n\nRed Army Tank Commander\n\nVasiliy Bryukhov\n\nPen & Sword Books\n\nc/o Casemate (US distribution)\n\nwww.casematepublishers.com\n\nhttps://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk\n\nhttps://iremember.ru/en/memoirs/tankers/bryukhov-vasily-pavlovich\n\n9781781590232, $34.95, HC, 224pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Red-Army-Tank-Commander-Eastern/dp/1781590230\n\nSynopsis: What was it like to command a T-34 tank on the Eastern Front during the Second World War? How were tank operations organized and carried out, what was the actual experience of combat, and what were the qualities that made the difference between success and failure - and what were the chances of survival? \"Red Army Tank Commander: At War in a T-34 on the Eastern Front\" by Vasiliy Pavlovich Bryukhov's vivid, detailed and gripping memoir of his wartime service gives a fascinating and authentic insight into these questions.\n\nIn addition, \"Red Army Tank Commander\" provides an accurate, unsentimental record of the day-to-day life of a tank man whose unit fought in the forefront of the Red Army throughout the conflict across the western Soviet Union and into Eastern Europe. Vasiliy's first-hand eyewitness account is a memorable personal story, and it gives a powerful insight into the reality of tank warfare seventy years ago.\n\nVasiliy was born in 1924 in Osa. In April 1943, after graduation from tank school, he was given command of a T-34 tank, and he took part in the Battle of Kursk. He served continuously until the end of the war, fighting through Ukraine, Moldavia, Romania and Hungary to Austria. In one action his crew destroyed nine German panzers and in another he led the vanguard of his tank brigade through German lines to capture bridges and cut off the German retreat. In 1944, he was promoted to battalion commander. For his actions at the end of 1944 and 1945, he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, but this nomination was not fulfilled until 1995 when he was given the title of a Hero of the Russian Federation for the courage and gallantry he displayed in battle during the Great Patriotic War.\n\nCritique: Ably translated into English by Vladimir Krupnik, \"Red Army Tank Commander: At War in a T-34 on the Eastern Front\" by Vasiliy Pavlovich Bryukhov is a simply fascinating and impressively informative account which will be a welcome and much appreciated contribution to the growing library of World War II military histories and biographies.

The rector of that church, Reverend Russell Jones Levenson, Jr., believes he was invited into private moments with these public individuals so he could serve as a witness: a witness to observe, and a witness to tell.\n\nWith the publication of \"Witness to Dignity: The Life and Faith of George H.W. and Barbara Bush\" and featuring never-before shared correspondence, experiences, and personal stories, Levenson offers new insight into the Bushes' wit and wisdom; their commitment to family and friends; their tireless desire to bless the lives of others; and their steadfast loyalty to their church, their faith, and their God. Before embarking on writing this book on faith, Levenson sought and received the blessing of all the Bush children, including the 43rd president.\n\nReaders will laugh, cry, and be inspired as Levenson ponders how and why he was put in this unique pastoral position, asking questions like, \"What on earth was I doing reading the sports section of the paper with the forty-first president, his cabinet member Brent Scowcroft, and a Chinese official on a breezy morning at Walker's Point in Kennebunkport, Maine?\"\n\nLevenson writes with emotion about being with President Bush and Barbara Bush as they each took their last breaths on this earth. He then describes in full detail the surreal experience of planning a state funeral and giving a eulogy with other presidents in the front row.\n\n\"Witness to Dignity: The Life and Faith of George H.W. and Barbara Bush\" is for readers who yearn for our public officials to serve with faith and integrity like the Bushes. But above all else, the story of George and Barbara Bush reveals just how powerful it is when world leaders are humbled before the power that rests above all powers.\n\nCritique: A carefully crafted, informative, and ultimately inspiring biography, \"Witness to Dignity: The Life and Faith of George H.W. and Barbara Bush\" is an extraordinary and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, community, and academic library American Biography collections.

Randall Publisher\n\nwww.perpublisher.com\n\n9781942155508, $29.95, HC, 320pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Snapshots-My-Father-John-Silber/dp/1942155506\n\nSynopsis: With the publication of \"Snapshots of My Father, John Silber\" Rachel Silber Devlin provides an extensively illustrated memoir of her father, John Silber, a man who entirely transformed Boston University as its president and was a controversial, yet intellectually formidable, candidate for governor of Massachusetts.\n\nIn this personal and informative memoir, Rachel Silber Devlin looks at her family and her father's trajectory from Texas to Boston and what life became like there; she examines his personality and temperament; and she describes his later years, the hardships he weathered and his continued accomplishments out of the public eye.\n\nDevlin chose to tell her father's story because John Silber, the man, is so widely misunderstood. People who knew him either loved him or hated him. None were indifferent. This memoir is in no way a full biography of Silber's life. That would require several volumes. As the title implies, each chapter is like a snapshot taken from a daughter's perspective, peering into the past she saw.\n\nSilber championed freedom of speech, believing all sides should be heard, especially on college campuses. He was also the father of seven children, and the author often meets people who want to hear what he was like as a father and they like to tell her their own stories about him. Snapshots of My Father is her clear-eyed vision of this authentic man of principle who had a drive to achieve great things.\n\nCritique: Impressively illustrated with inserts of historical black-and-white photographs, \"Snapshots of My Father, John Silber\" by Rachel Silber Devlin is a deftly crafted and inherently interesting memoir showcasing a daughter's account of her distinguished father.

As a wife, a mother, and a homemaker, she always had a strong sense of who she was apart from any labels. Devlin says that she sometimes feels like she and her dad grew up together because she knew him so well from a time when he was young and still learning how to make his way in the world. She divides her time between her homes in Texas and Massachusetts, the states where her children and grandchildren live.\n\nThe Sign Catcher\n\nOtilio Quintero\n\nArte Publico Press\n\nUniversity of Houston\n\n4902 Gulf Freeway, Bldg 19, Rm 100, Houston, TX 77204-2004\n\nwww.artepublicopress.com\n\n9781558859395, $19.95, PB, 240pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Sign-Catcher-Otilio-Quintero/dp/155885939X\n\nSynopsis: As a young boy, Otilio Quintero lived with his family in abject poverty in a labor camp in California's San Joaquin Valley.

The marchers carried the scared pipe to the nation's capital and ultimately legislative bills detrimental to indigenous people were defeated.\n\nHis life then took a dramatic turn when he found himself in a maximum-security prison facing a possible 20-year sentence! Through a miracle of faith and hope, Quintero escaped prison and began teaching farmworkers at a community college. He would go on to become a leader in the movement against gang violence, joining forces with organizations such as Barrios Unidos and Homies Unidos.\n\nHe also worked alongside the likes of Cesar Chavez, Harry Belafonte and Tom Hayden, and his efforts to save lives took him to El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. \"The Sign Catcher\"s is a compelling read that exemplifies the need to make change within before attempting to change the world around us -- and Quintero contends the challenges of the current times require our awakening now!\n\nCritique: An inherently interesting, informative, and well written memoir that will have a very special appeal for personal, community, and academic library Hispanic Biography collections, it should be noted for students, academia, and non- specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"The Sign Catcher\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $9.99).\n\nEditorial Note: Otilio Quintero (https://mesarefuge.org/people/otilio-quintero) is a founding member of the Community Justice Network for Youth (CJNY) and a long-time youth violence prevention advocate.

Cynthia James know this -- because that was her personal experience.\n\nCovering seven decades of living, traveling, and growing, \"Does My Voice Matter? A Journey of Self-Discovery, Authenticity, and Empowerment\" follows her journey of self-discovery and authenticity as she gradually recognizes that she has a voice -- and learns how to use it. She uses her own life experiences as a backdrop for her exploration of how the voice is used as a tool of engagement; how a singular or collective voice can enhance empowerment, transparency, and accountability; and, finally, how expression can develop new ideas, shift cultures, political views, transform organizations, create laws, and improve lives.\n\nWritten for anyone who wants to discover the power within that makes them special, \"Does My Voice Matter?\" has a vital message: Uniqueness is your own glorious imprint on this planet, and it is calling you to come out. It doesn't matter if your awakening is large or small, it doesn't matter what your age, race, religion, or history is -- anyone can begin right where they are, right now.\n\nCritique: A deftly crafted memoir with a mission, \"Does My Voice Matter? A Journey of Self-Discovery, Authenticity, and Empowerment\" by Cynthia James is an extraordinary, thought-provoking, and ultimately inspiring read.

The orphaned, emotionally fragile actress initially babysat Fred's daughter while turning to his family for support. Although the Marilyn-Fred romance lasted just over a year, her close friendship with the Kargers, including Fred, continued for fourteen years until the end of Marilyn's life.\n\nWhile Fred was Marilyn's first true love, his mom, Nana, was the mother she never really had. \"Maril,\" as they fondly called her, was allowed to relax and be herself.

So at the first opportunity, he defected to the Russians. Now he and others like him have formed the Czechoslovak Legion. Their goal: leave the chaos of Russia, sail to France, and help the Allies defeat the Central Powers, thereby toppling a hated empire and winning an independent Czechoslovakia.\n\nWith the fall of the tsar, Nadia Linskaya's life is in ruins. Her family is dead, her lands are confiscated, and her aristocratic world is gone forever. But Nadia is determined to elude the Bolshevik agent who destroyed her family and find a way to survive in this changed world.\n\nWhen Nadia takes refuge with the Czechoslovak Legion, the last thing she expects is an ally. But when Filip proposes a sham marriage to ensure her safe passage across Siberia, she takes it. Neither Filip nor Nadia expect real love, not when the legion has to take over the longest railroad in the world -- and then hold it against Bolshevik counterattacks, partisan sabotage, allied intrigue, and a set of brutal Siberian winters.\n\nAt risk is the future of Czechoslovakia, the fate of Russia -- and their hearts.\n\nCritique: A deftly written, original, and inherently entertaining novel that fully showcases author A.
