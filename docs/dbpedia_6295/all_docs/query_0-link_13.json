        "text": "A problematic intersection near Stittsville will have new safety measures in place by September, but not the improvements some have been hoping for.\n\nThe staggered intersection of Flewellyn and Shea roads has been a hot spot for collisions for years, and frustration is growing over what some see as a slow response by the city.\n\nAccording to open data available on the city's website, the intersection was the scene of 34 collisions between March 30, 2017, and Nov. 16, 2022, the latest statistics available.\n\nOf those, eight collisions resulted in a non-fatal injury. A total of 15 people were injured during that period, including one who was seriously hurt.\n\nA majority of the collisions occurred during daylight hours in clear conditions.\n\nWhile more recent collision data is unavailable, a July 13 post on the website of Stittsville Coun. Glen Gower said, \"in recent months several serious collisions have occurred at the intersection ... including two this week alone.\"\n\nIn response, the city and the office of Rideau-Jock Coun. David Brown are investing in flashing beacons, speed display boards and repainting stop lines.\n\nBrown said the new safety measures will be in place as soon as resurfacing work on Flewellyn Road complete. That's set to begin July 22, and is expected to take five weeks.\n\nRoundabout in the works\n\nSome local residents say those measures aren't enough, however.\n\n\"It's not a matter of if there will be an accident, it's a matter of when,\" said Jennifer Bugden, president of the Munster Community Association. \"I do everything in my power to avoid that intersection.\"\n\nStop signs control traffic approaching Flewellyn Road from either direction of Shea Road, but because the intersection is skewed, the signs sit about 30 metres apart.\n\nFor that reason, Brown said a four-way stop is unfeasible and could increase the likelihood of collisions at the intersection.\n\nInstead, the long-term plan is to realign Shea Road and build a roundabout. But the plan, which would involve purchasing land and moving utilities, could take more than a decade. Brown said that's unacceptable.\n\n\"When we're talking about long term, it is long term, and that's not acceptable â€” acceptable to me [or] acceptable to my colleagues,\" he said.\n\nRideau-Jock Coun. David Brown says a four-way stop is unfeasible at the intersection because the two ends of Shea Road sit about 30 metres apart. (Nick Persaud/CBC)\n\nLong wait 'absolutely disgusting'\n\nAccording to Brown, city staff have identified 36 locations requiring similar safety upgrades. Because they're ranked by priority, the list can fluctuate, and so can wait times.\n\nBrown said the Flewellyn and Shea intersection has been on the list for several years already. Another intersection at Flewellyn and Eagleson Road has been waiting for upgrades for 16 years.\n\nBugden called the long wait for safety upgrades \"absolutely disgusting.\" Brown agreed the process needs to be sped up.\n\n\"We need to find a sustainable way to fund these intersection upgrades that happen in a timely manner,\" he said.\n\nBecause of the added complication of the intersection's unusual layout, Brown said the preliminary estimate to fix it is $10 million. Typically, such safety upgrades would cost between $3 million and $5 million, he said.\n\nBrown says replacing the intersection with a roundabout is at least a decade off, and could cost $10 million. (Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\nMore people, more traffic\n\nRecent population growth in outlying areas such as Stittsville has emphasized the need for safer roads, Brown said.\n\n\"We know that the increased volume from the growth in Stittsville has contributed to the volume through the intersection, and which has helped escalate it onto the list,\" Brown said.\n\nMartin Clarke, former president of the Fallowfield Community Association, said he's witnessed the same trend in the city's south end.\n\n\"We were seeing encroachment from Barrhaven, from Kanata, and with the population growth and housing growth in those areas, we're seeing a lot more traffic through our village, through the rural areas, so that's posing a problem,\" Clarke said.\n\nAccording to the City of Ottawa, 38 per cent of all fatal collisions between 2018 and 2022 occurred rural areas of the city.\n\nClarke said he avoids certain intersections at rush hour due to the risk of collision.\n\n\"It's something that we've been dealing with as an association for the past 10 years ... but we don't really have any firm solutions for that at the moment,\" he said."
