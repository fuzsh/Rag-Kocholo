Athletes on this list include Jim Thorpe and Duke Kahanamoku.\n\nThis list answers the question, \"Which athletes won a gold medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics?\" Every historic Olympic competitor from the 1912 Summer Olympics competed bravely, but only the ones on this list were lucky enough to win a gold medal."
