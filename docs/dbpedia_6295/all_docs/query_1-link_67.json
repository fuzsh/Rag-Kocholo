        "text": "Since the modern Olympics first started with Athens 1896, Australian athletes have won 185 gold medals at the Summer Games.\n\nAustralia and Greece, in fact, are the only two nations to have had representation in every single edition of the Summer Olympics in the modern era.\n\nAustralia have won at least one gold medal in 25 of their 30 appearances at the Summer Games. St Louis 1904, Antwerp 1920, Berlin 1936 and Montreal 1976 are the only editions where the Australian contingent failed to claim a single top podium finish.\n\nEdwin Flack became the first Australian to win a gold medal at the Olympics after clinching the men’s 1500m race at Athens 1896. He also won the gold medal in men’s 800m at the edition.\n\nMeanwhile, Fanny Durack is the first Australian woman to ever win an Olympic gold medal. She topped the podium in the women’s 100m freestyle swimming event at Stockholm 1912.\n\nOf the 185 gold medals, two were won as part of a mixed team. Stan Rowley joined up with English runners to win the men’s 5000m team race at Paris 1900 while a combined team featuring Australian and New Zealand swimmers, competing under the Australasia banner, took the gold in men's 4x200m freestyle relay at Stockholm 1912.\n\nSwimming has accounted for 76 of Australia’s total Olympic gold medal tally. Athletics (22) is the next best.\n\nIn terms of top podium finishes, Paris 2024 has been Australia’s most successful campaigns at the Olympics, yielding 18 golds.\n\nSwimmers Emma McKeon is the most decorated Australian athlete at the Olympics with six gold medals. She surpassed Ian Thorpe's five at Paris 2024.\n\nEmma McKeon won four gold at Tokyo 2020 - the record for the most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian in a single edition.\n\nSailor Bill Northam, who won gold in the 5.5 class at Tokyo 1964 at the age of 59 years and 26 days, is the oldest Australian Olympic gold medallist.\n\nSkateboarder Arisa Trew is the youngest Australian Olympic medallist in history at 14 years and 86 days old. She took the honours when she won the gold medal in the women’s park event at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nAustralia’s total medal tally at the Olympics is 610 - 185 gold, 196 silver and 229 bronze.\n\nAustralia Olympic gold medallists - full list"
