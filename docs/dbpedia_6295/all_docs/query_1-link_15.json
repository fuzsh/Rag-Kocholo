        "text": "Hard Times\n\nThe 1916 Olympic Games were scheduled to be held in Berlin, but were cancelled due to World War I. The 1920 Games were awarded to Antwerp to honour the suffering that had been inflicted on the Belgian people during the war.\n\nOpening Ceremony\n\nDuring the Opening Ceremony, the Olympic flag, with the five rings signifying the universality of the Olympic Games and the union of the five continents, was raised for the first time at an Olympic Games, created by Baron de Coubertin. The Olympic oath was taken for the first time by an athlete on behalf of all competitors, and for the first time, doves were released as a symbol of peace.\n\nAntwerp 1920 Olympic Games Legacy\n\nDiscover the lasting legacy that this edition of the Olympic Games created for its hosts.\n\nMemorable Champions\n\nIn a performance unequalled in Olympic history, Nedo Nadi of Italy earned gold medals in five of the six fencing events. Ethelda Bleibtrey of the U.S. won gold medals in all three womenâ€™s swimming contests. Including preliminary heats, she swam in five races and broke the world record in every one."
