THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC^MES V$;\". / Since the last Olympiad was Helcf'irl Berlin, in 1936, a new generation of young people has grown up with little or no idea of the history and tradition of the Olympic festival. This book has been designed as an introduction and companion to the Games of 1948, particularly for these young people. Besides telling the general story of the ancient Games from 776 B.C. onwards, and of the modern revival up to the present day, it explains the technicalities of each event and shows its develop- ment, setting the stage for the coming contests at Wembley and elsewhere with lists of records, tables of metres and yards for various events, details of the Marathon and Road-walk courses, a glossary of technical terms and a programme which can be filled in as the events of 1948 are decided. There arc also 24 pages of photographs, some of them reproduced for the first time. Special chapters have been written by Janet Bassett-Lowke (Swimming), Jack Beresford (Rowing), W. J. Mills (Cycling), Oscar State (Weight-lifting), George Mackenzie (Wrestling), J. W. Dudderidge (Canoeing), and Frank Eyre (Yacht Racing). This Book is dedicated to the President and Members of my club, St. Mary's (Hornsey) Harriers, a small club in the right tradition, and to my son, James. R.D.B. THE STORY of the OLYMPIC GAMJiS R. D.

(Paul Popper) ) Vlll INTRODUCTION TWELVE years have passed since the Berlin Olympic Games were held, and to at least half the present generation they are something remote which is suddenly becoming news. When lecturing on athletics during the war I found that even among young men of military age there was considerable ignorance of the history and ideals of the Olympic Games, and that sensa- tional headlines had made more impression than the quiet reality. Since London is to house the XlVth Olympiad in July and August, 1948, I have written this book as a general introduction to the Games, and to enable those who visit them or follow them in the Press or on the radio to get some idea of the less familiar activities, to record the 1948 results as they come out, and to relate both them and the deeds of our own athletes to pre- vious performances. A table of metrical equivalents and a glossary of tech- nical terms have been included, and it is hoped they will prove useful. Whatever the results of the Games those of you who are fortunate enough to see some of the competitions will appreciate the Games for what they are, the bringing together of the world's leading amateur athletes on an equal footing to demonstrate the science, enjoyment, and brotherhood of sport. \" Faster, Higher, Stronger \" is the Olympic motto. Baron de Coubertin, who was primarily responsible for the revival of the Games, has epitomized their spirit in a sentence which is not always remem- bered : The important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part, for the essential thing in life is not so much conquering as fighting well. If we should ever hear of a nation so jealous of its national prestige that it will enter only for those events which it is certain of winning, let us try at least to show that nation that other countries who have no chances at all of supremacy in the same events, can at least share the glory of competing ; that for any unexpectedly-snatched sixth place there will be more jubilation, than those who take victory as a national duty will ever know. That is not to say that winning should not be our ultimate aim in every event. Olympic titles cannot be won by half-hearted effort, but such effort, so long as it is a balanced part of life and not a business, is a fine thing. One should at least expect that an athlete should spend his winter in preparation ix x INTRODUCTION and not risk injury by playing football, and that he should reserve his supreme effort over the months for the great day, at the cost of lesser glories. Abrahams perfecting his sprinting technique through a cold winter, Beresford and Southwood sculling 2,000 miles in rough tidal water. These are examples which deserved the reward that followed them. To watch is to enjoy and to learn, but to all the youth of England, even if privileged to see nothing more than the passing of the marathon runners on the roads of Wembley, I hope that the Games will be an incentive to their own effort. Choose your own sport rather than be a permanent spectator. Join a club, or if there is no club help to form one, for among you are the hopes of future Olympiads. I wish to express my thanks for help in writing this book to the con- tributors who have written the special chapters, to T. Rutherford Harley, Headmaster of my old school, to Harold Abrahams, who gave me the benefit of his extensive knowledge, to Mr. R. F. Church, Press Secretary of the XlVth Olympiad, and Mr. H. L. Boorer, late assistant secretary of the Amateur Athletic Association. I offer no thanks at all to the airman whose bomb destroyed the Olympic books and records in the British Museum. I am greatly indebted to the Official Reports of the various Olympiads by F. A. M. Webster and Harold Abrahams. Thanks are due to the Editor of the Times for permission to reproduce the contemporary account of the 1908 Marathon and to Dr. H. B. Stallard, M.D., F.R.C.S., and the A.A.A. for permission to quote from Fifty Years of Progress. Agency photographs are acknowledged in their context. I am indebted to W. J. Mills for permis- sion to use two photographs from The Bicycle, to J. W. Dudderidge for the photograph of the canoeing team, to Jack Beresford for the photograph of the 1932 Eights final, and to Professor J. D. and Mrs. Beazley for permission to reproduce illustrations of the long distance race and the long jump from Attic Red-Figured Vases ; and to Dr. E. N. Gardiner and the Clarendon Press for the illustration of The Wrestling School from Athletics of the Ancient World. I THE ANCIENT GAMES ATHLETIC contests are frequently mentioned in the poems of Homer which, written in about the ninth century B.C., probably deal with events of two or three centuries before that date. Such contests were held to celebrate important events, and the death of Patroclus was the occasion of the funeral games described in the twenty-third book of the Iliad. The events, for which Achilles provided the prizes, included a chariot race, boxing, wrestling, a foot race round a distant mark and back, throwing the javelin, throwing the discus, an armed fight, and archery. The athletic festivals of Greece, of which we have detailed results from 776 B.C. onwards, were more highly organized, developing with the growth of the city state. We need not be surprised that the Greeks traced them back to the gods and heroes, or that the accounts of these origins varied. One story, recorded by the Greek writer Pausanias, tells how Heracles matched his four brothers in a foot race, crowned the winner with wild olive and called the games Olympic. Because the brothers were five in number, the games were held, in the Greek reckoning, every five years, or as we should say, every fourth year. Another version gives Zeus as the originator, either by wrestling with Cronos for the throne, or to celebrate his victory over Cronos. One victor is said to have been the sun god Apollo, who beat Hermes at running, and Ares at boxing. This story accounted for the playing of the Pythian flute song, sacred to Apollo, while the jumping in the Olympic Pentathlon, a combination of five events, was in progress. Other heroes of the old legends were said to have taken part in the games in honour of Olympian Zeus : Clymeneus, Endymion, Pelops, Amythaon, Augeas, and Polydeuces. But in the reign of Oxylus the games were discontinued and almost forgotten. But though their origins may have been legendary, the revival of the Games in the reign of Iphitus, King of Elis, was an historical fact. Greece 11 12 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES was at the time troubled by a weary civil war between the Eleans and the Pisatans, who were the original inhabitants of Olympia, and Iphitus, on consulting the Delphic oracle, received the answer that he and the Eleans must renew the Olympic Games and the Olympic truce, which forbade not only warfare but the very presence of armed men during the \" holy moon \" of the contests. This he did with the help of Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, and the terms of the truce were engraved on a discus which was kept at Olympia, and seen by Pausanias. The Eleans, protected by Sparta, remained in control of the Games except for a brief period when Pheidan of Argos invaded Elis on behalf of the jealous Pisatans and took over the direction of the festival. No Eleans or Spartans were allowed to compete on this occasion, and the results were later on struck out of the Olympic register. Pausanias says that the long-forgotten athletic events were remem- bered one at a time and gradually added to the programme. The actual date of the revival of the Games was fixed as 776 B.C., the year in which Coroebus won the foot race, and this, the first definite Olympic date, became the basis for reckoning time until the Games were abolished in A.D. 394. Each Olympiad was a period of four years, thus 775 B.C. was called the second year of the first Olympiad, 773 B.C. the fourth year of the fiist Olympiad, and 772 B.C. the first year of the second Olympiad. Besides the Games at Olympia there were the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian festivals, held at Delphi, Nemea, and Corinth respectively, forming a periodos or sequence of four in successive years. An athlete who had been successful at all four was known as a periodonikes. But the Olympic Games carried the greatest honour, and it is with them that we are chiefly concerned. They were held every fourth year at the first full moon after midsummer, and eventually lasted for five days. Olympia, sacred to Zeus, was a beautiful spot between the rivers Alpheus and Cladeus in the Western Peloponnesus, bordered by richly wooded hills, and it became through the years a unique museum of the whole of the Greek world, famous for its temples, for the treasuries of the various states and colonies and for the Altis, a sacred grove full of statues and monuments. In the temple of Zeus were the colossal throne and image of the Olympian god by Pheidias. This statue, which THE ANCIENT GAMES 13 is said to have been carried off to Constantinople and accidentally destroyed there, was one of the Seven Wonders of the world. It was about forty feet high, of gold and ivory, adorned with precious stones. The god, wearing a gold crown of wild olive, sat on a throne which was embellished with reliefs and paintings. The statue had a profound effect on all who saw it, and was much more highly praised than the Hermes of Praxiteles, which we can see, in its restored state, and cannot help but admire. Many of the other statues were of victors, others were erected out of the fines paid by athletes who broke the rules, particularly those who accepted bribes. Pausanias gives details of these offences and deplores them, being particularly shocked that Damonicus, a native of Elis, the mother state of the Games, should have \" squared \" a wrestling match in which his son, Sosander, was taking part. One monument which must have shamed the Greeks was the Philippeum, dedicated by Philip of Macedon after his victory over Greece at Chaeronea in 338 B.C. Near the Altis were the Prytaneion, the hall where the victors were feasted ; the Gymnasium, where the athletes did their final month's training, and which included a covered running track for practice on wet days ; the judges' room ; the theatre, the palaestra, for wrestlers and boxers ; the hippodrome, about half a mile in length, where the horse and chariot races were held ; and the athletic stadium. The stadium lay at the foot of Mount Cronion, which formed a natural embankment on one side of the track. At one end was the so-called \" hidden entrance,\" a stone vault, partly artificial, on which spectators stood. The track was not elliptical like the tracks of today, but long and narrow. It was, in fact, a narrow straight course, one stade (about 192 m. or 210 yds.) in length and 30 yds. wide, and for all races longer than one stade competitors ran round a mark and back to the starting place. The word for this turning was the same as that for oxen turning round at the end of a furrow when ploughing, or for writing which ran backwards and forwards across the page. The surface of the track seems to have been loose sand. The runners ran barefoot, and, after the fifteenth Olympiad, following Spartan custom, completely naked. The start was marked by two lines formed by sunken limestone slabs, 14 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES in which were grooves for the runners' feet. There were square pillars every 100 ft. on either side of the course for boys' races or for measuring the length of a discus throw. The few seats alongside the course were for officials, as the spectators either stood or sat on the ground,. Late in the fourth century A.D. Olympia was ravaged by Alaric and his Goths and later the buildings and statues were destroyed by Theodosius II. The embankments which protected it from flooding were neglected. Soil was washed down from Mount Cronion, and the Cladeus, changing its course, brought alluvial deposits to cover the ruins. For many centuries Olympia lay buried to a depth of 16 ft., but not forgotten. Eighteenth century scholars surveyed the site and pro- claimed the need for excavations, but it was not until 1875 that serious work was begun by German archaeologists and completed in 1881, revealing the site of ancient glory to scholars. For the first Olympiad Iphitus was the sole judge, but the number increased gradually to nine, each, as in the modern Games, with his special task, and in the later period there were ten. They wore purple robes, and curiously enough up to the 102nd festival were allowed to take part themselves. But after a judge named Troilus had won two chariot races a law was passed forbidding judges to compete. The preparations for the Olympic Games began months before when the heralds of Zeus visited the Greek cities and colonies announcing the Games and the sacred truce. The competitors and spectators thence- forth were assured of the protection of Zeus as they travelled to Olympia. Taking part in these Games was no light matter for the competitors. The journey for most of them was a long one and besides its cost there were other expenses. Winners were expected to give banquets after the Games. The competitors arrived at Olympia in early summer, either by one of the seven roads, or by water, and after being examined by the Judges to make sure of their Greek birth and their worth as athletes, they stood by the statue of Zeus, and together with their fathers, brothers, and trainers, swore an oath on the entrails of a boar that they would in no way sin against the Olympic Games. Neither slaves, barbarians nor THE ANCIENT GAMES 15 the inhabitants of cities that had not paid tribute to Zeus were allowed to compete. The judges did not always accept the statements of com- petitors themselves, and sometimes those who called themselves \" boys \" were transferred to the men's races. They then took a further oath that they had for the past ten months kept the training regulations. By them as they took their oaths stood the fearful statue of Zeus Horkios, god of oaths, grasping two thunderbolts as a threat to false swearers. Oaths of fairness and secrecy were also taken by the officials. The competitors then spent a month training in the camp at Elis. This was a necessary condition of the Games, and on one occasion Appolonius Rhantes, a boxer from Alexandria, who arrived late and gave the excuse of bad weather on the voyage, was excluded from the Games when it was discovered that he had been \" pot-hunting \" picking up some money from the Ionian Games. In early times all athletes were vegetarians, their chief diet being cheese and figs, but they turned later to eating meat, the first to do so being a long-distance runner aptly named Dromeus (runner) who had twelve victories at various Games. No athlete over thirty was allowed to compete in the ancient Olympic Games, whereas for the modern Games there is no age limit, and a fair number of modern winners and placed men have been over thirty-five. \"The Olympic Festival,\" writes E. N. Gardiner, in Athletics of the Ancient World, \" was much more than a mere athletic meeting. It was the national religious festival of the whole Greek race. Olympia was the meeting-place of the Greek world.\" The athletic stadium alone held 40,000 spectators and there would be many more than this number attracted by the Olympic Fair, the poetic recitals, and the opportunity for doing good business and making money out of a crowd. Many arrived by river, having come to the mouth of the Alpheus by ship and thence transferred to rafts and other small craft. It was a brilliant procession that finally set out for Olympia for the Games, bearing offerings for the altar ; not only the competitors, some with their horses and chariots, but the officials, stewards, the elders of Elis, and ambassadors from all competing cities took part in it. The 16 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES procession has its counterpart in the modern Games, when the national teams parade round the track for the opening ceremony. For each day's events the competitors were matched before sunrise by the Hellenadikoi or judges. For: all events except the hoplites' race, the race in armour, there were heats and a final. The first race in the revived Olympic Games of 776 B.C. was the stade race, roughly the equivalent of our modern 200 metres sprint. It was won by Coroebus of Elis. Fifty-two years later the diaulos, or double foot- race, was added, and won by Hepenus the Pisatan, and four years later still, in the fifteenth Olympiad, Acanthus of Sparta won the first dolichos or long race. The number of laps in this race is not definitely known but its length was probably between two and three miles. At the eighteenth Olympiad the Pentathlon was introduced, and won by Lampis, the Spartan. It consisted of running, upright wrestling, throwing the javelin, throwing the discus, and the long jump, the latter to the accompaniment of a flute. Three out of five victories won the Pentathlon, ties being decided by the placings in the other events. The wrestling contest, being last, was sometimes the deciding event. Boxing, in which the competitors wore thongs of ox-hide to protect the knuckles, later developing into the brutal Roman cestus, chariot racing, the hoplites* race and the pancration (an \" all-in \" combination of boxing and wrestling) were added in turn. The pancration had some resemblance to modern ju-jitsu. Kicking an opponent, and hitting him when on the ground were both allowed, in fact biting and gouging out the eyes with the thumbs were the only practices not permitted. One Greek vase shows the judge wielding a rod to prevent foul play. Much of the pancration took place on the \" mat \" and it was for this reason that Plato excluded it from his ideal state as unsuitable for military training, because it did not teach men to keep on their feet. The Greeks told of one competitor who let himself be strangled rather than \" raise the finger \" which would have admitted defeat. Later on a full programme of boys' contests was added, beginning in the thirty-third Olympiad with a half-stade foot race. So many events, particularly horse and chariot races, were included, that the Games eventually occupied five days instead of one.

Below: Loues, with the Crown Prince of Greece running at his side, wins the marathon of 1896. THE ANCIENT GAMES 17 As the size of the programme increased so did the territory from which the competitors came. At first the Games were local, but after the first Messenian war they spread first over the Peloponnesus (the area south of the isthmus of Corinth), and then over the whole of Greece. At this period the hardy Spartans were supreme, scoring 46 out of the 8! results known to us. But as Greek colonies sprang up along the shores of the Mediterranean, so fresh blood was brought into the Olympic Games, where colonists gained many victories. Among the winners of the chariot race was King Philip of Macedon. After the Roman conquest the Greeks had to admit their conquerors, although barbarians, to the Olympic Games. The early Olympic spirit of sport for sport's sake gave way to mercenary exhibitions and abuse of the Games. The very name of Olympia was still enough to attract thither many who were unworthy of its ideals. So wide was the fame of an Olympic winner, and so great the indirect rewards to be gained, that there grew up the professional class of athlete, the swaggering, over-muscled pot-hunter, who did nothing but train for, and compete in, events. Theagenes of Thasos won 1,400 prizes. The Greeks were even forced to crown and applaud the Emperor Nero as an Olympic champion, when he came with his \" Augustan \" bodyguard of 5,000, complete with a highly organized team of \" cheer leaders,\" and no com- petitor dared to beat him at music, acting or athletics. Even though he fell out of his elaborate ten-horse chariot, Nero was still the victor. The musical competitions, which had not hitherto been held at Olympia, were brought there for his benefit. One of the last Olympic champions we know of was Varasdates, who later made himself King of Armenia. But in Greece's Golden Age the Games were free from abuses, and everything seems to have been done to keep the contests pure and on a high level. Along with the other three non-prize-giving Games, they gained a far higher reputation than such contests as the Ionian Games, where money prizes could be won. Upon a table of gold and ivory the winner was crowned with a wreath cut with a golden sickle from the wild olive of the Beautiful Crown, which grew near the temple of Zeus, and was said to have been brought by Heracles from the land of the Hyperboreans. His name and the name of his father and his native B 18 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES state were proclaimed by a herald. Great was the cheering of their fellow citizens when local victors rode home in chariots in a grand procession. Although no prizes were won at Olympia there were no rigid laws of amateurism, and on their return home athletes generally received money and other rewards for the honour they had conferred on their native state. Solon offered a bonus of 500 drachmae to any Athenian Olympic victor. One such award of free meals in the town hall was remembered and repeated by the modern Greeks in 1896 when Loues won the Marathon. Pausanias, travelling through Greece, describes many statues and shrines honouring local athletes. On the banks of the Eurotas he found the tomb of Ladas, fastest runner of his day, who, after winning the Olympic dolichos fell ill on the journey home, and died by the wayside. Some victors were made immortal in the Olympian Odes of the poet Pindar. Thus Asopichos of Orchomenos, the boy runner, and Alcimedon of Aegina, the boy wrestler, have kept their youth and fame through twenty-four centuries. There are no records ena- bling us to com- pare the achieve- ments of Greek runners with those of the pre- sent day athletes, and in the field events where we have some figures of Greek perfor- mances, we can only amuse our- selves by guessing their worth. A late Greek writer credited Phayllus with a long jump of 55 ft. If this figure is correct, which is very doubtful, it cannot have been for a single jump Long-jumper in mid-air (about 500 B.C.). The youth on the left is exercising with halteres. THE ANCIENT GAMES 19 as we know it. For the triple jump or \" hop, step and jump,\" 55 ft. is an extremely good but not impossible figure. It is true that the Greeks used elliptical weights or halteres to increase the length of their jumps. These were first held above the head, then swept downwards and backwards and released. The effort of pulling the weights back shot the jumper forward. In 1854 J. Howard, a good professional jumper using 5 Ib. dumb-bells, and with the additional help of a take-off 4 in. high, jumped 29 ft. 7 in. Even the use of weights, then, is not likely to account for a 55 ft. jump. The discus throw of 95 ft. ascribed to Phayllus is much more feasible, for Martin Sheridan (U.S.A.) in 1908, using what was believed to be the Ancient Greek style, recorded a throw of 124 ft. 8 in. A description of this style is given on page 75. The Greeks had two javelins, a practical heavy pointed one, used in war, hunting, and target competitions and usually thrown from horse- back, and a lighter one, having a weighted blunt head, and thrown in the Pentathlon for distance only. It was thrown by twisting the amyntum or leather finger-thong round it. The spin thus derived played the same part in increasing distance, that the rifling of the barrel plays in a gun. As in the modern Games some of the Greek athletes succeeded in keeping their titles for a second Olympiad ; some even for a third and fourth ; a fine feat when it is remembered that Olympiads are four years apart. The American sprinter Wykoff was in the winning relay team for three Olympiads ; Lord Burghley in his third Games ran the strenuous 400 m. race faster than ever before ; while Jack Beresford, the British sculler, rowed in five Games, and secured wins twelve years apart. But whatever the opposition, the record of the Spartan Chionis who kept his form over thirteen years in the stade race was a fine one, though surpassed by that of Leonidas of Rhodes who won all three foot-races at four successive Olympiads. Hermogenes of Xanthus, a Lydian, who won the wild olive eight times at three Olympic festivals, gained the surname Hippos (horse). Over 2,000 years later the Finnish distance runner Virtanen earned the sam ^ name. Of all the Greek athletes the most renowned for his strength was Milo 20 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES of Croton, who wrestled in seven Olympiads (once as a boy) and was at length defeated. He would hold a pomegranate in his hand, so firmly that no one could take it from him, yet so gently that the fruit was not damaged. Another feat of Milo's was to stand upon a greased discus from which no one could move him by charging or pushing. He \\yas a pupil of the philosopher Pythagoras and saved his master's life by holding up the main pillar when the school collapsed. He is said to have died by prising apart a thunder-riven tree, which sprang together, trapping him and leaving him to be devoured by wild beasts. Among the stories of the Games told by Greek writers is that of another Pythagoras (of Samos) who, when a boy, was laughed to scorn for his boxing, and even called girlish ; yet he persevered, and later on defeated all comers in the men's events. Another is that of the three sons of Diagoras of Rhodes, all Olympic victors, who insisted that the glory was not theirs but their father's, and carried him round the stadium amidst the applause of the crowd. This was in the seventy- ninth Olympiad (464 B.C.). Women, so far from competing in the Olympic Games, were not even allowed to be present at the stadium events, or to cross the river Alpheus on certain days, under penalty of death ; but on one occasion at least, the sentence of being thrown from the Typaean Rock was not carried out. This was when Callipateira, a widow, disguised herself as the trainer of her son, the wrestler Peisirodus. After her son's victory her secret was discovered, but she was pardoned because of the fame of her father, brothers, and son all Olympic victors. An exception to the law excluding women was Chamyne, the priestess of Demeter, the harvest goddess, who watched the Games from her seat on an altar of white marble. Women appear to have been allowed to watch the horse and chariot events, and even to take a part in them. Belistiche, a woman from Macedonia, drove to victory in the first race for chariot and pair in the 128th Festival. This was apparently permitted because the prize went to the owner, not to the driver. The women of Greece did, however, according to Pausanias, have an Olympic Games of their own, held every fourth year in the Olympic THE ANCIENT GAMES 21 stadium. These Games were said to have been founded by Hera, the wife of Zeus, and were called Heraea, the sixteen handmaidens of Hera weaving a robe for the goddess every fourth year. The Games consisted of footraces of about 165 yards, in age-groups, with the youngest running first. The competitors, who ran with flowing hair, and wore short tunics for comfort, received crowns of olive as prizes, and were allowed to set up statues with their names on them. Such then were the Olympic Games of the Greeks, which flourished for nearly 1,200 years, and at their best displayed an ideal of sportsmanship and fair competition without the lure of prizes, that has inspired all that is finest in more recent sport. The Greeks looked upon athletics as a necessary part of education, and their encouragement of the development of the human body had a real connection with their love of painting and sculpture. The rise and fall of the Games was paralleled by the rise and fall of a great civilization. During the Dark Ages the Olympic fire was extinguished. It was 1,500 years before it was relit. II THE REVIVAL BEFORE international games could be revived after the lapse of centuries, there had to be some .standards of control for the various sports in each country. This began to happen in the second half of the nineteenth century, when there was a great boom in cycling, track and field athletics, swimming, rowing and other sports. Great Britain led the way. The first Oxford v. Cambridge Sports were held in 1864, and in 1866 the London Athletic Club came into being. Writing in 1887, Sir Montague Shearman noted that one of the most remarkable features of modern English athletic life was the ability of athletes to govern their own sports. \" Football, cricket, cycling, ath- letics, paper-chasing, have all their governing bodies ; and at a week's notice the best team at any sport can be picked from the whole country, or the popular opinion as to any change or innovation in the sport ascertained.\" The Amateur Athletic Association, the \"Jockey Club of Athletics,\" was formed in England in 1880, following dissatisfaction with the old Amateur Athletic Club, and by 1886 154 clubs were affiliated to it, representing about 20,000 athletes. The chief aims of the A.A.A. were to make rules uniform, deal with abuses, preserve amateurism, and organize national championships. In 1894 a step towards international competition was taken when Yale University met Oxford in London, and in 1895 Cambridge visited Yale, and London Athletic Club met New York Athletic Club. In pre-A. A. A. days there had been consider- able snobbishness in athletics, a$ in rowing, for the clubs kept to the notion of the gentleman-amateur and one of the definitions of an amateur was that he \" is not an artisan, a mechanic, or a labourer.\" On one occasion the members of the London Athletic Club threatened to resign because Morgan, the walker, who earned his living in a large store, had been allowed to take part in an open race. A dispute in 22 THE REVIVAL 23 1885 between the A. A. A. and the National Cyclists Union was settled in a friendly manner, but in some countries there was constant friction between the governing bodies, and this was one of the things that Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the distinguished idealistic Frenchman, sought to prevent. Another side of sport distasteful to him was the growing habit of prize hunting. He felt that the conflict between rival sports could be stopped by bringing them all together, and this led to his ambitious dream of the revival of the Olympic Games. Baron de Coubertin foresaw the meetings of sportsmen of all nations. At a time when politicians were arguing about the merits of Free Trade, the movement of goods without tariffs, he said : \" Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers, into other lands. This is the true Free Trade of the future, and the day it is introduced into Europe the cause of peace will have received a new and strong ally.\" Like most pioneers de Coubertin faced much opposition, misunder- standing, and lack of interest. He founded a monthly paper The Athletic Review, and in 1893, after patient work in gathering together interested persons, he thought the time ripe to call together an Inter- national Athletic Congress. Replies to the invitations were slow to come, but at last all was well, and an enthusiastic company of sports- men gathered at the University of Paris. The real purpose of the meeting was at first kept secret, lest it should seem too ambitious. When the agenda was produced the Olympic Revival figured as Item 8. The earlier items were long and weary, and by the time Item 8 was reached no one wished to argue. It slipped through much more easily than the Baron had dared to hope. 1900 was fixed upon for the first meeting, and then this was brought forward to 1896, the first Games being offered fittingly to Greece, the Mother of the ancient Festival. The Greek Government, however, was alarmed at the proposal, having little money to spare for such a project. Some members of the Committee formed to organize the Games wished to abandon them, but the Crown Prince of Greece, full of enthusiasm, saved the situation by forming and presiding over a Council of Twelve. He made a stirring speech to open the proceedings and formed nine sub-committees. An appeal was made, and slowly but surely the money was raised. 24 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES The question of a stadium was another problem, for the old one was a wilderness. But this was overcome by the generosity of M. George Averoff of Alexandria, who offered to bear the whole cost of a new one. Indoor events were held in another building called the Zappion, built by the brothers Zappa. There were many setbacks for the organizers of these revived games, held at such short notice, with no previous experience as a guide ; but by the appointed day the new stadium of dazzling white marble was ready. Its design was based on that of the Stadium at Olympia, with certain alterations to suit modern events, but the bends were still too sharp to allow good performances, and there could be no 200 m. or 400 m. events. On 6th April, 1896 before a crowd of 50,000 spectators, the Crown Prince of Greece addressed the King, who declared the Games open. An orchestra introduced the \" Cantata for the Olympic Games \" written by M. Spiridon Samara, and in answer to great applause the choir gave an encore. The events began and the official description of them makes very quaint reading. The authors seem to have had no previous form to go on, and good performances and bad were applauded in rhapsodies rather like the village schoolteacher's report of the Flower Show Sports in the local paper. The Greek competitors were highly amused by the \" strange hurrahs \" and \" absurd shouts \" of the Americans, and as the United States, even in the first Games, provided many winners, these noises were frequent. After each day's events arches of flaming gaslight lit the town and the Acropolis was lit up by coloured Bengal lights. On one night the Antigone of Sophocles was played in the town theatre. For the Greeks the Marathon race, held over the historic course, dwarfed everything, and it was very fitting that it was won by a Greek. A description of this race will be found on page 58. The Aquatic Sports were held in the Bay of Zea, but these even more than other events were spoiled by the bad weather. It is noticeable that in the British sporting papers of the day the Games excited no more interest than any club handicap meeting, and no concerted effort was made to send over our best team. Launceston Elliot \" the modern Hermes,\" a pupil of \" the strong man \" Sandow, E. H. Flack. THE REVIVAL went on his own initiative to compete in the sprint, the wrestling, and weight- lifting, the last of which he won. E. H. Flack, an Australian who had learned his running in England, won both the 800 m.' and 1,500 m. events. The Sporting Life correspondent wrote, \" This is getting monotonous \" as the Stars and Stripes was hoisted again and again, and added : \" I con- fess I should like to see if St. George's cross still exists ! \" The second Games were held in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris in July 1900 on a grass track. From the purely ath- letic point of view they were a great improvement on the 1896 Games, and comparison of Olympic records really dates from 1900. Aided by Alvin Kraenzlein, the first modern hurdler, who had four victories, the United States again won most of the events, which were greater in number and variety than in 1896, and even included an angling competition in the Seine. The course of the Marathon was round the walls of Paris. But there was still no great enthusiasm and in British sporting papers these Olym- pic Games are referred to merely as \" International Competitions at Paris.\" Chicago was chosen by the United States for the Games of 1904, but in view of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of that year, the Games were added to it and held at St. Louis. The 1904 Olympic Games were very thoroughly organized. The grounds were magnificent, and many thoughtful details, such as indicators to show progress in the jumps and throwing events, added to the general efficiency. But these Games suffered from one serious disadvantage their remoteness. Great Britain was among the many countries unrepresented. They were in no sense truly international. All but one of the events were won by American athletes, and an experiment of having special events for aboriginal peoples 26 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES was a failure. The chief result was to popularize athletics in the United States, but they added little to M. de Coubertin's ideal. The athletic standard at St. Louis was, however, on the whole higher than at Paris. To meet the plea of Greece that all future Games should be held in Greece, it was decided to hold an extra festival at Athens in 1906, but this, though it attracted competitors from many nations, was not strictly an Olympiad at all, though we have included its records for completeness. The 1908 Games were to have taken place in Rome, but difficulties arose, and in 1906 the late Lord Desborough was asked if London would take them. The invitation was gladly accepted, the Games, as in Paris and St. Louis, being coupled with an Exhibition. The specially con- structed White City Stadium at Shepherd's Bush, London, had a 586 yds. cinder track, surrounded by a 660 yds. cycle track, with a swimming pool inside them. The 1908 Olympic Games were wider in scope than ever before, such sports as archery, boxing, Rugby football, gymnastics, hockey, lacrosse, clay-pigeon shooting, skating, tennis, wrestling, and yachting being included. They were opened by King Edward VII on 13th July, 1908. Some foreign visitors expressed surprise at the number of vacant seats on the early days, but on Marathon day, at least, the Stadium was packed, and there was a great demand for seats at any price. It is interesting to recall that the famous 1908 Marathon was almost omitted from the programme, owing to traffic difficulties, but a general outcry caused the authorities to change their minds. Political disturbances in Greece led to the cancellation of the pro- posed Pan-Hellenic Games of 1910, but the 1912 Games were held at Stockholm, from 6th to 15th July, and from then dates the rise of the Scandinavian athletes. Sweden did extremely well, and Finland, with a small band of competitors, won three track events and the Discus. Russia took part, but her success was small. Great Britain, who had placed a large number of winners at the London Olympiad, had few successes this time, and the newspapers were very gloomy and childish about it, criticizing the organization, the judging, and the selection of our own team. Writing in the Times 9 in July, 1912, Sir Arthur Conan THE REVIVAL 27 Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, made the interesting suggestion that we should in future enter an Empire team in order to get results as good as those of the United States. The Stockholm Games ended in spectacular fashion. At the end of the track events the Stadium was converted into a huge banqueting hall where 3,000 athletes and others had supper at tables set on the grass of the arena, to the accompaniment of songs sung by a choir of nearly 4,000 voices. The festivities ended with a display of fireworks. The proposed Games of 1916 were offered to Germany and the German Emperor accepted the offer on behalf of Berlin, but the War of 1914-18 intervened, and by 1916 Berlin was a goal of a different kind. The Games of 1920 were awarded to Belgium as a tribute of world sympathy for her sufferings during the war. Ex-enemy nations were not allowed to take part. The Antwerp Games were formally opened by the King of the Belgians on 14th, August 1920. After a Solemn Mass and Te Deum in Antwerp Cathedral Cardinal Mercier delivered an oration in memory of fallen athletes. These Games, held largely in wet weather on sodden tracks, saw further improvement by the Finns, who, with only thirty athletes, won three distance events, four field events and the pentathlon. Great Britain's total of four track events was quite creditable, considering the damage to her man-power during the war, but did not prevent British newspapers, which had not been very enthusiastic about the Games, from asking the usual question of what was wrong with British athletes. But this time the newspapers appreciated the atmosphere of good feeling between competitors of rival nations. Paris housed the Games for the second time in 1924 when forty-five nations competed at Colombes Stadium. At the opening ceremony President Doumergue, the Prince of Wales (now Duke of Windsor), Prince Henry (now Duke of Gloucester), the Crown Prince of Roumania, and Baron Pierre de Coubertin were present. Great Britain's successes included the 100m., 800 m., 1,500m. and single sculls. At this Olympiad the 10,000 m. cross-country race, which is a winter sport, was held on a very hot day and most of the competitors collapsed 28 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES in distress ; not so Nurmi, the \" Flying Finn,\" who finished freshly, well ahead of his countryman, Ritola. This event has not been repeated, and there is a wise tendency now to exclude out-of-season sports. Ernest Harper (G.B.), who twelve years later was to give Son of Japan such a good race and himself beat the Olympic record, was fourth on this occasion. 1924 was notable for Great Britain's first defeat at water polo. In 1926 Germany was re-admitted to international competition and in 1928 to the Amsterdam Games, but she was not to win a first place until eight years later. Forty-six countries took part in the Amsterdam Games, which were opened by the Prince Consort of the Netherlands on 28th July, 1928. The Dutch Parliament had refused to subscribe to the cost, but the necessary money was raised by public subscription. The Olympic titles were well shared in this meeting. Canada won both sprints, Great Britain two track events, the United States five field events and three track events, Finland four track events and the Decathlon, Ireland the hammer, South Africa the hurdles, Japan the hop, step and jump, Sweden the javelin, and France the Marathon. The rise of Japan was probably the most notable thing in these Games. Women's events were held for the first time at Amsterdam, women already having held their own Olympiad at Stockholm in 1925. At this point I quote from H. B. Stallard, Great Britain's great middle- distance runner, on the Games of 1928, writing m Fifty Years of Progress, the A.A.A. Jubilee souvenir : \" The Press pour forth much criticism, mostly adverse, at the termination of each Olympic Games. These critics could never have moved among the athletes of the various nations, or they would not say or write the things they do. In the stadium events there were no unfortunate incidents ; men played the game hard and cleanly. Fencing, boxing, and wrestling, which take place outside the Stadium, are games involving physical contact between opponents, and quick thrusts and blows make a fair judgment difficult. In these events unfortunate incidents at times occur. But year by year men of all nations are learning to be chivalrous in victory and generous when defeated, and to abide by a referee's decision.\" THE REVIVAL 29 In 1932 the Games returned to the United States and were held under perfect conditions in California. Indeed so good was the track at Los Angeles, and so favourable the weather, that it was difficult to imagine the 1932 times ever being beaten when the Games returned to Europe. Yet most, of them were bettered four years later at Berlin. The competitors were housed together in the Olympic village in the Baldwin Hills, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, instead of being spread in hotels as formerly, and the whole organization was very thorough. Thirty-eight nations took part in the ceremony on 30th July, 1932, at the Olympic Stadium when Vice-President Charles Curtis of the United States, on behalf of President Hoover, declared the Games open. The Los Angeles Games were carried through very pleasantly and efficiently. Great Britain won the 800 m., the 50 km. walk and two rowing races, and was second in the Marathon, steeplechase, 1,500m., 1,600 m. relay and the tandem race. But the United States recaptured the sprints, and both hurdle races, and had a fair share of events of most kinds, though in the six swimming events for men, the youthful Japanese competitors scored five firsts, four seconds, and two thirds. India won the hockey competition for the second time in succession. The Winter Sports were held at Lake Placid in the heart of the Adirondack forest and included a sled race for dogs. Great Britain sent a very young team for the women's figure skating event, won by Sonja Henie. The ski-ing events were won by the Scandinavian countries. For their excellent organization and the high quality of performances, the Olympic Games of 1936, held at Berlin, will long be remembered. But some aspects of the games were unworthy of the Olympic tradition, and reminded one of the ancient games in their later, less creditable days. The German National Socialists had determined to use the Games for political and national reasons, and there was a military significance behind the great enthusiasm for field events. There is no doubt that the great success of the coloured athletes, Owens, Johnson, Metcalfe, Williams, and Woodruff was distasteful to the racially-minded Germans who made many disparaging references to the \" black races.\" However, 30 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES racial prejudice did not prevent them from being openly pleased at the performances of the Japanese, their chosen future allies. The opening ceremony was relayed by loud-speakers in the streets throughout Berlin. Richard Strauss conducted his specially composed Olympic hymn. The Olympic fire, which had been carried by. relays of runners from Olympia, was put to the brazier by a typical specimen of Nordic manhood, and Loues, the Marathon winner of 1896 presented Hitler most unprophetically with an olive branch. The results showed still further progress by the Japanese who, in addition to keeping up their successes in the jumps and swimming events, secured first and third places in the Marathon and, through Murakoso, harried the unbeatable Finns in the distance events. The Germans, to whom success in the Games was a vital matter of national reputation, won an Olympic event for the first time. German athletes won three field events and gained several places in others ; German women won two more field events ; while their boxers, cyclists, weight-lifters, and oarsmen were prominent. Great Britain's chief disappointments were in breaking her succession of 800 m. successes, and the poor performance, through injury, of Sydney Wooderson in the 1,500 m., though British athletes looked upon the Oxonian Lovelock from New Zealand as one of themselves rather than as a foreigner. Whitlock, Harper, and the four members of the 1,600 m. relay team did their best to retrieve Britain's reputation. British teams entered for all the aquatic events and won the double sculls, and the 6 m. yachting class. In the canoeing events our com- petitors benefited from competition with more experienced rivals. Handball was won by Germany, and basketball by the United States. India, as usual, won the hockey competition very easily, and Argentine, with first-class ponies, beat Britain in the polo final. The artistic side of the Berlin Games was not neglected, though it could still be improved. Competitions were held in many classes, from town-planning and architecture to painting and music. Most of these were won by Germans, Austrians and Italians, but several first prizes were held over as the standard reached was not high enough. The Winter Games staged at Garmisch-Partenkirchen were very THE REVIVAL 31 well organized, well attended and generally the most successful ever held. It was at one time planned to hold the Games of 1SL40 at Tokio when they would have coincided with a notable Japanese festival, but as Japan was at war with China she was ruled out as a venue for the Olympic Games 'under the old tradition that no country at war could take part. The Games were then offered to Finland, who accepted, and a detailed programme of the proposed 1940 Games was printed. Additional events included a 10,000 m. walk, putting the shot (women) and gliding con- tests. But the late summer of 1940 saw a grimmer struggle than the Olympic Games in Europe. Less than six months after the end of the Japanese war the Olympic Council had met. They had to decide whether to hold the next Games in two years or in six. They were bold, chose the shorter interval, and the fourteenth Olympiad was fixed for London in 1948. The Olympic Committee had a very big task ahead of it to organize an Olympiad in two years during a period when so many vital tasks of reconstruction are occupying the energies of the people and the re- sources of the country. The Winter Games were held at St. Moritz (Switzerland) in February, 1948. These were organized by the Swiss, and were quite separate from the British-organized Summer Games, which will extend from 29th July to 14th August, 1948. The chief centre of the 1948 Games will be Wembley. The track events will take place in the Stadium, where, beneath the surface of the speedway and greyhound tracks there is a running track which will be unearthed and given a good modern surface. This stadium which can accommodate nearly 100,000 people should make a worthy setting for the Games. Football, hockey, and horse-jumping will also be held in the Stadium. Swimming and boxing events will be held in the Empire Pool, also at Wembley. The yachting events will be held in Torbay, shooting at Bisley, rowing at Henley, and cycling at Herne Hill. The modern Pentathlon will probably be held at Aldershot. Housing the competitors will be no easy problem, but it is intended 32 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES to make use of surplus Royal Air Force accommodation in the Northolt district. The International Olympic Committee, which governs the Olympic Games, is a self-constituted voluntary committee, and its members are not nominated by national bodies, and do not consider themselves as specially representing their own countries. Baron de Couber'tin was naturally enough the Committee's first President, and when he died in 1925 he was succeeded by Count Baillet-Latour. The present President is M. J. Sigfrid Edstrom. Each country has a National Olympic Committee which is responsible for selecting and financing its country's team, and must assure itself that all its competitors are amateurs. The International Olympic Committee meets normally once a year and its executive committee once a quarter. It has the sole right of settling where an Olympiad shall be held. An Olympiad need not be celebrated, but the intervals between Games cannot be altered. War has twice interfered with their sequence but in each case the next Olympiad has waited for the four-year period to come round. The Winter Olympic Games are in a distinct cycle of their own. In the year following each Games a Congress is held composed of members of the International Committees and various International sporting federations. The British Olympic Association was founded on 24th, May 1905 at a meeting held at the House of Commons. The late Lord Desborough, one of the greatest all-round sportsmen who ever lived, was the first Chairman. Since that date the Association has carried out with effi- ciency, many and various tasks, including that of raising large sums of money to send British representative teams to the Games. Before each Games the Association forms various committees, an appeals committee, a committee which arranges for accommodation, provides equipment and organizes transport, and a finance committee. Another of its tasks has been to unify the international rules for many sports. The present secretary of the B.O.A. is Evan Hunter, O.B.E., who has done as much as any man in the cause of the Olympic ideal. The British Olympic Association has consistently opposed any weakening of the definition THE REVIVAL 33 of the amateur, and has firmly rejected the suggestions from various countries that athletes should be compensated for \" broken-time,\" i.e., salaries lost through competing, or rewarded for breaking records. This is not a simple problem, for though money should not be even an indirect aim for an athlete, the lack of it should just as definitely not be a handicap to his progress. You will no doubt see much of the Olympic emblem in 1948. It takes the form of five linked rings, representing the linking in this festival of the five continents. For the purpose of the Games is to link the nations, not to drive them apart. All countries will naturally watch closely the progress of their own competitors, but though the news- papers are likely to print national ranking lists, it should be em- phasized that these are unofficial. There is no such thing as a country \" winning \" the Olympic Games, and in all but the team contests the athlete, though nominated by a country, actually competes as an individual. Ill THE TRACK EVENTS NOT all the mechanical thrills in the world can beat the last lap of a mile between well matched runners, nor is there any hush more ex- pectant than that which spreads over the ground as the hurdles finalists get down on their marks. To repeat these moments on paper is not possible. Photographs and descriptions remind us ; results preserve the details, but none are satisfactory. Tables and figures are but shadows and tell only part of the story, Few of us can help falling under their spell, yet it is as well, when reading the following pages where, for lack of other comparisons, much is talked of records, to remember that they are misleading things, which depend on many factors, and that the ob- ject of racing is to beat your opponents and not the watch. \" Timing\", wrote Sir Montague Shearman in 1887, \" is merely a means, and not in any way an end in itself : a fact the present generation of athletes which has simply gone mad upon * times ' and * records ' appears to have forgotten.\" An A.A.A. mile of some years ago provided an object lesson in pace control by an Olympic champion who timed his effort so that he beat his opponents decisively yet without too much effort. He was popular and the crowd cheered, but when the time of 4 min. 26 sec. was announced a loud groan went up from the same throats. Yet had the announcer said 4 min. 15 sec. the crowd would have applauded and been satisfied, and only a handful of the pace- conscious known it was false. On another occasion one remembers a superb 440 yds. hurdles final, between Lord Burghley and Facelli when the Italian won by inches on the slow rain-sodden Stamford Bridge track in 53-4 sec. Reference to the programme showed the World's Record by an American to be -6 of a second faster. \" That may be,\" said an old-timer in the \" shillings,\" \" but he would have been third in that race ! \" The trends of national supremacy in the track events are interesting. 34 THE TRACK EVENTS 35 From 1896 onwards the U.S.A. has won twenty-three out of thirty-one titles in the races from 100 m. to 400 m. and the remaining eight have gone to runners from the British Empire. In the 800 m. Great Britain had a golden period of success from 1920 to 1932, while the 1,500 m. has been evenly divided, with U.S.A. and Britain always prominent. The lo'ng track races do not appear to suit the Americans. Finland has usually not merely won them but placed all her runners. But during the recent war the Swedish long distance standard eclipsed even the Finnish, and struggles between these two should be interesting in the future. THE 100 METRES FLAT RACE One hundred metres is 109*3 yards, so that an \" even time \" sprinter, that is, one who can do 100 yds. in 10 sec. should cover the Olympic distance in 10*9 sec. The table below will show you that much better than \" even time \" is now required of the winner. By improved training methods, and a better knowledge of the body's working, modern athletes, particularly the Americans, have made this short dash a scientific feat, and cut down the 1896 time by 1*8 sec. In no race is a fast start more important. The modern \" crouch \" start came from America and was first used in England by T. L. Nicholas of Monmouth, in 1890. At first it was not understood. In the 1896 Games most competitors preferred other methods. Even in 1904 Sir Montague Shearman wrote of it as \" an interesting novelty not suitable for all runners.\" It was then thought of as a means of keeping a runner's balance rather than as a source of spring. Watch any good sprinter now and you will see how much use he makes of that crouch. For the first few yards he wastes little energy in getting upright. His drive is mostly forward. To aid the spring the runner digs two holes in the track, though in the 1948 Games the use of starting blocks, above the surface of the track, will be permitted for the first time. These aids to fast starting have been in use in other countries for some time but are new to England. Much of the success of a sprint depends upon the starter, tense, sometimes crouching, and often quite a good distance from the runners. 36 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES His task is to see that no runner \" beats the pistol \" and thus gains an unfair advantage. He first tells the runners to \" go to your Marks\", then \" get set \" and when they are all steady in the crouch position and not before, he fires his first pistol. Should he observe any runner moving before the pistol he fires his second one and brings them back. This problem is as old as athletics itself. The Greeks had a special word for a man who got away before the signal, and another for the man who was left at the starting-line. False starts are upsetting both to runners and to the spectators, who, not understanding, frequently blame the starter for them. They do not realize that the starter's delay after \" get set \" is usually because a runner is unsteady. The spectator can best help by complete silence. C. W. Paddock of the U.S.A. was the first outstanding sprinter after the eight years' gap between the Stockholm (1912) and Antwerp (1920) Olympiads. He won the 100 m. decisively, the British champion starting badly, and was expected to do so again at Paris in 1924. But here Harold Abrahams, well known since as a radio commentator and writer on athletics, showed the value of persistence and thorough train- ing. Three times in two days he recorded 10*6 sec. to equal the Olympic record, winning the final with his well-known \" drop \" on to the tape. Four years later, at Amsterdam, the Americans were again defeated when the nineteen-year-old Canadian schoolboy, Percy Williams, had surprising victories in the 100 m. and 200 m. events (Plate 4). In the former, the British champion J. E. London ran a splendid race to finish second. By 1932 however it had become obvious that the U.S.A. had a wealth of outstanding sprinters and the only question was which ones would survive the hard tests of their Olympic trials. It fell to the short stocky negro, Eddie Tolan, to beat the tall negro, Ralph Metcalfe, in a new record time of 10-3 sec. after winning his heats in 10-9, 10-4 and 10-7 sec. (Plate 4). The power of American sprinting in 1932 was shown by the fact that after placing the first two in this race, and the same two runners with G. Simpson between them in the 200 m. the United States were able to bring out four fresh runners to lower the Olympic record in the 4 x 100 m. relay by a full second. THE TRACK EVENTS 37 As 1936 approached it seemed that Tolan's successor would be either his runner-up, Metcalfe, or another negro, Eululace Peacock, who equalled Tolan's 10-3 sec. while on tour in Norway in 1934. But we began to hear less of Peacock, and in May 1935 the athletic world was astonished by the news that Jesse Owens, a negro student, had in one afternoon broken the world's records for the 100 yds., 220 yds., 220 yds. hurdles, and long jump. Here was a new champion indeed ! At Berlin, in 1936, Owens won both sprints (Plate 4), the long jump (Plate 1 5), and was in the winning relay team (Plate 5). Never before had a sprinter with such a smooth effortless carriage been seen. By comparison with his upright flowing action his rivals seemed to be straining all the way. Owens did 10-3 sec. twice and 10-2 sec. once, but 10-2 sec. though an Olympic record, was not passed as a world's record owing to the strength of the following wind. Note. A following wind of over 2 metres (6 ft. 6 in.) per second will cancel a record. RESULTS 1896 T.E. Burke U.S.A. 12-0 sec. 1900 F. W.Jarvis U.S.A. 11-0 sec. 1904 A. Hahn U.S.A. 11-0 sec. 1906 A.

(or -2 sec. at Olympic speed) less than our normal 220 yds. race. Five winners of the Olympic 100 m. have gone on to gain the double event, and they include the last three champions, Williams, Tolan and 38 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES Owens. But not all sprinters have that extra stamina which will carry them at faster than \" even time \" through three heats and a final at 200 m. after four races at 100 m. It will be seen that Tolan and Owens between them have cut the record down by almost a second. Applegarth (G.B.) was third at Stockholm, while at Antwerp, H. F. V. Edward (G.B.) who had won the British Championship in 21-6 sec. pulled a muscle in the semi-final, his second misfortune in the Games. In 1924 Eric Liddell (G.B.) was third to J. V. Scholz (U.S.A.) and Harold Abrahams (G.B.) the 100 m. winner, was sixth. In 1928 Walter Rangeley of Salford Harriers excelled himself by running second to Percy Williams of Canada, the best performance of any Englishman in this event, but since then Great Britain has had no finalist in the 200m. Since this race is run in \" lanes \" round a bend the starts are staggered or \" in echelon.\" It may appear at first glance that the men in the out- side lanes are receiving starts from those on the inside, but they will of course be running wider on the bends and each lane is in reality of exactly the same length. Lanes are drawn by lot, and there is an un- doubted advantage, more particularly for the 440 yds. race, in having an inside berth, from which to watch your opponents all the way. The man in the outside lane for no Olympic sprinter should be foolish enough to look round has no idea of his fortunes until he actually reaches the last few yards. RESULTS 1896 No Event 1900 J. W.

Osendarp Holland THE TRACK EVENTS 39 THE 400 METRES FLAT RACE Four bunded metres is 43745 yds., roughly 2\\ yds. (or -3 sec.) short of 440 yds. The all-out 400 m. is no longer a race with any sort of \" breather \" in it, though there are more ways than one of running it. The American method includes a top-speed first furlong, with the second only slightly slower: the British, as run by A. G. K. Brown (second at Berlin in 1936) and Godfrey Rampling, relies on a fast but even pace throughout, a relentless long stride. At one time this race was run without lanes, a fact which brought physical sturdiness and tactics as well as speed into the contest. There would be a mad rush to gain and keep the inside position on the first bend, then the runner would \" coast \" down the back straight, to join in another struggle round the last bend and up the home straight. But it was never easy to determine where \" tactics \" end and \" ob- struction \" begins. The most unfortunate example was the race of 1908, in which, after a decision against an American for obstruction, the other Americans withdrew from the race and left W. Halswelle of Great Britain with a walk-over. The final of the 1920 800 m., however, produced a pleasanter incident. The winner, Bevill Rudd (S. Africa), relates how an American, who accidentally bumped into him, said \" Sorry, Bevill.\" This in the breathless dash of an Olympic final ! In 1924 Eric Liddell (G.B.) accomplished a magnificent feat in winning the race in 47-6 sec. after earlier rounds in 50-2, 49 and 48-2 sec. Liddell did not spare himself, but ran all out from the start, and yet managed to finish strongly. His time was then a world's record. Liddell was an outstanding personality in athletics. Famous both as a Scottish rugby international and as a runner, he was a man of very strong principles. After the Games he went to China as a missionary, and died in Japanese hands during the second world war. In 1928 J. W. Rinkel was fourth, one second behind R. Barbuti (U.S.A.) who won on the tape in 47-8 sec., taking advantage of an easing up by J. Ball of Canada. It was unfortunate for Great Britain that Godfrey Rampling was not at his best for the 1932 Olympiad at Los Angeles. He had shown great 40 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES form, and necessarily so as foreign runners were doing the unheard of time of 47 sec. and even lower. Up till then one solitary run of 47 sec. had been made by the American Long on a straight track. But now Ben Eastman (U.S.A.), was recording 46-4 for 440 yds., and even for that time he had his challengers. The Los Angeles final was a great race, and produced a time that will not easily be beaten. Liddell's record had been lowered by \" Blazing Ben \" Eastman and W. Carr (U.S.A.), in the semi-finals, when the British runners, Rampling and Stoneley, were defeated. Eastman, who had an inside lane, led at first, was passed by Golding (Canada), and repassed him, but a powerful finish carried Carr through the tape in the time of 46-2 sec. In 1936 British hopes were fixed on the three 400 m. runners A. G. K. Brown, W. Roberts and G. Rampling, and in spite of the very high standard of competition they did not disappoint. Who knows what might have happened had Brown not drawn the worst lane of all (the outside) in the final ? Brown tells us in Athletics by the Achilles Club that he had calculated on being a yard or two behind A. F. Williams coming into the straight, but was momentarily paralysed on finding that the gap was seven or eight yards. Yet on making a final effort Brown caught up rapidly, and it was agreed that in another few yards he would have been ahead. However, \" ifs \" and \" perhapses \" though very tempting, are of no use to us. Williams won in 46-5 sec., Brown did 46-7 sec., while LuValle (U.S.A.) and Roberts (G.B.) were on their heels in 46-8 sec. Rampling had been squeezed out in a very fast semi- final. This great runner did not reach the 400 m. final at either of his attempts. His outstanding qualities were best called out when in Olympic relay races he had to give away heart-breaking starts to first- class runners ; then he became the most dangerous quarter-miler in the world.

THE 800 METRES FLAT RACE Eight hundred metres is 874-8 yds., that is, just over 5 yds (or -6 sec.), less than half a mile. This race is not run in lanes. It is a race in which exact judgment of pace is very important. The time cannot be good unless the first lap is fast. Most attempts to run the two laps at the same pace have resulted in the first lap being medium and the second slow, but T. Hampson (G.B.), in 1932 was less than a second slower in his second lap, because he resisted the temptation to run after his rivals in the first lap. The first of the great Olympic half-milers was J. E. Meredith (U.S.A.), the winner at Stockholm in 1912. Meredith, a youth of nineteen, un- known in the spring of 1912, won his way into the United States team against great competition, and a few months later was Olympic record holder, defeating the holder, M. W. Sheppard (U.S.A.) with yet another American third, and the renowned Hans Braun (Germany), a stylish half-miler, popular in England, fifth. After the 1914-18 war Great Britain monopolized this event by having the world's best half-milers over a period of sixteen years. In 1920 A. G. Hill (Great Britain), won both the 800 m. (Plate 6) and 1,500 m. events. In 1924, at Paris, the British champion Stallard, in spite of an injured foot, set a fast pace. He was passed by P. Martin (Switzerland) with 30 yds. to go, but then D. G. A. Lowe, a runner of classic style, tore past both to win a great race in 1 min. 52-4 sec. (Plate 5.) Lowe was to defend his title four years later at Amsterdam, but meanwhile, he and the British public received a shock when in 1926 Dr. Otto Peltzer of Germany celebrated his country's return to inter- 42 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES national athletics by defeating Lowe in the A. A. A. championships at Stamford Bridge after a very thrilling race in which both runners broke the world's half-mile record, and Peltzer's time was 1 min. 51-6 sec. But in 1928, Peltzer did not reach the final, and Lowe, faster than ever, after being led by Lloyd Hahn (U.S.A.) in the first lap in 55-2 sec., sprinted away to an easy victory in 1 min. 51-8 sec. \" It was,\" wrote H. B. Stallard in Fifty Years of Progress, \" the work of a craftsman, if such a term can be applied to athletics. Lowe's track tactics, strategy, beauty of running, and above all his indomitable courage, gave him victory, the thrills of which mere words could never describe accurately.\" Lowe's lap times were 55-6 and 56-2 sec. This race saw the first Olympic appearance of the popular Canadian athlete Phil Edwards, surely one of the greatest runners not to win an Olympic title. He was on this occasion rash enough to run wide out- side Lowe, wasting precious yards and tailing off in the straight. In 1928, 1932 and 1936 Edwards played an important part in the finals for the 400 m. to 1,500 m., usually setting the pace ; as he did in 1932 at Los Angeles, when his time for the first lap was 52-8, while Hampson was content to lie fifth, two whole seconds behind. In the second lap Hampson's even running brought him steadily up to Edwards, but no sooner had he passed him, than he was himself passed by A. Wilson (Canada), but he re-passed Wilson with his last ounce of energy in the straight, both runners beating the world's record, with Edwards third, and the three fancied American runners beaten. (Plate 10.) J. V. Powell, a young British runner, who did extremely well to finish seventh, was looked upon then as the natural successor to Lowe and Hampson, and later J. C. Stothard of Cambridge University came to the fore. Neither was good enough to beat Phil Edwards in the British Empire Games midway between Olympiads in 1934, and in 1936 Stothard was unhappily off form. In the 1936 final, in which it was recognized that the surviving British runner had little chance, Edwards played his customary part in the race though much more cautiously than in 1932 and was actually leading in the final straight, when J. Woodruff (U.S.A.) (Plate 5), a tall negro THE TRACK EVENTS 43 with an immense stride, ambled past to win in 1 min. 52-9 sec., a very moderate time, due to the slow first lap of 574 sec. M. Lanzi of Italy was second and Edwards once more third. 1896 1900 1904 1906 1908 1912 1920 1924 1928 1932 1936 RESULTS E. H. Flack Australia A. E. Tysoe G.B. J. D. Lightbody U.S.A. P. H.

THE 1,500 METRES FLAT RACE The mile has always been a very popular race with the spectators, and the 1,500 m. (1,6404 yds., or 119-6 yds. less) is the Olympic equi- valent. In judging a 1,500 m. performance in terms of a mile, one has to assume that the runner would have continued at the same pace for the extra distance. At Olympic pace 18 sec. is nowadays a fair addition. E. H. Flack's winning time of 4 min. 33-2 sec. in 1896 may seem laughable to us now, when the Public Schools' time for the full mile is faster, but we should remember that not only was the track at Athens an unsuitable shape for modern racing, but Flack had trained for an 800 m., a 1,500 m., and the Marathon, all at once ! Any mara- thon runner who has tried to race over a mile will sympathize. No runner can be thoroughly trained for three such different events. In 1900 C. Bennett, the Finchley Harrier, put up a world's record of 4 min. 6-2 sec. for the 1,500 m. The times of the mile have come down rapidly in our own day. Twenty years ago, Paavo Nurmi's 4 min. 10-4 sec. seemed unshakable. 44 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES Now it has been beaten by a score of runners, and the record is only just over a second outside the magic four minutes. A. N. S. Jackson's win at Stockholm in 1912 was a fine performance, for running against four Americans, including Kiviat, Taber and Jones, and E. Wide (Sweden) in the final, he was \" boxed in \" by other runners and had to drop back and come round them, to win by a yard in a terrific finish. Incidentally, it is said that Jackson only competed at all by paying his own fare to Stockholm. In 1920, Albert Hill, one of the first milers to perfect judgment of pace, made another British victory, winning from P. J. Baker (G.B.), on a wet, heavy track. American hopes had been firmly pinned on Joie Ray, later an Olympic Marathon competitor, who had run more miles inside 4 min. 20 sec. than any other runner. But perhaps had Ray run fewer fast miles in 1920 he would have been in better form against Hill. In 1924 Paavo Nurmi turned his attention to the 1,500 m. Few runners have had a greater influence on athletics than \" the Flying Finn,\" striding over the ground, watch in hand, with his upright body and powerful flick of the foot with each stride. His success in the 1,500 m., was gained by hard and even running throughout. He set his own pace, and did not quicken his stride for the finish ; he merely lengthened it. The brilliant French miler Jules Ladoumegue was thought a likely winner of the 1928 race, but Larva, another Finn, overwhelmed him by sheer rhythm, and even-paced running. Britain's Cyril Ellis put up a good performance to gain fifth place. While we waited for 1932 the British and World's mile records con- tinued to fall. The former passed from A. G. Hill to R. H. Thomas, and was then beaten by J. E. Lovelock, a New Zealander, at Oxford. Lovelock and his British colleague J. F. Cornes brought new interest into British miling at this period when fast times were beginning to be recorded in America by Bill Bonthron, Glen Cunningham, and others. The result of the Los Angeles race came as something of a surprise. Neither Lovelock nor Cunningham ran as well as expected. Lovelock, Ny, Cunningham and Edwards, led in turn, but on the last bend Luigi Beccali of Italy, with nice judgment, came through to win, hotly pur- THE TRACK EVENTS 45 sued by Cornes, who seemed to have made his effort too late. Once more Edwards was third in an Olympic final. The rise of Sydney Wooderson from Public Schools' champion to British record holder came between the Los Angeles and Berlin Olympiads. Wooderson undoubtedly had bad luck in being lame at Berlin, but Lovelock's careful preparation and admirable reservation of his own strength so that he was at his best just at the right time, deserved the Olympic title. Of the twelve finalists at Los Angeles, six survived the strenuous heats to be finalists again at Berlin : Lovelock, Cunningham, Edwards, Cornes, Ny, and Beccali. \" The old gang,\" said Ny (Sweden) with a grin, as they came out. Lovelock had developed one particular virtue as a miler, and that was his ability to judge his moment and change into top-gear running so quickly that he was yards clear of his opponent before the latter could respond. This he did superbly in the Berlin final 300 yds. from home, with Cunningham, his most dangerous rival, in the lead. Cunningham must have been expecting a challenge from Lovelock and must have trained to resist it, yet when it came it was so sudden and well sustained that all Cunningham could do was to trail his man in for second place. (Plate 7.) In the ten years since this race, in spite of the war, there has been great progress in miling. Arne Andersson, Gil Dodds, Gunder Haegg and Sydney Wooderson have cut well into the old records. Yet none of these runners is likely to figure in the 1,500 m. in London. L. Strand (Sweden), the winner of the 1,500 m. in the 1946 European Games, is at the time of writing probably the world's fastest miler, but much can happen in a few months. RESULTS 1896 E. H.

Beccali Italy THE 5,000 METRES FLAT RACE Five thousand metres is 3 mis. 188 yds. so approximately half a minute should be added to 3 mis. times to give the Olympic equivalent. With one exception this race has been regularly won by Finnish runners since it was first held in 1912. It is a fine race for the spectator, whether he already knows the runners or not, for they are in front of him long enough for a real interest to be taken in their styles and tactics. Hans Kolehmainen of Finland was the outstanding figure in the 1912 Games at Stockholm, winning three races, two in record time. His race in the 5,000 m. with the famous French runner Jean Bouin was one of the great races of all time. Bouin led most of the way, and the two runners ran right away from the rest of the field. Fifty yards from the tape Kolehmainen spurted ahead to win by 1 yd. in 14 min. 36*6 sec., 50 sec. better than the record, with the British champion, G. W. Hutson third, just ahead of Bonhay (U.S.A.). The first Olympiad after the 1914-18 war, saw the dbut of Paavo Nurmi (Finland), who was however in this race beaten by Guillemot of France. It was his only Olympic defeat by anyone other than a Finn. In 1924, Nurmi, who had already won the 1,500 m. was successful in an uninteresting 5,000 m. against his regular opponents Wide (Sweden) and Ritola (Finland). Ritola had learned his running in the United States and did not run in the normal Finnish style. In 1928 he caused a newspaper \" sensation \" by defeating Nurmi, after another Nurmi-Ritola-Wide struggle, but there was really nothing sensational about it. Even Nurmi was not a perfect machine, and with such a runner as Ritola against him, the slightest lapse of form must mean defeat. After the retirement of Nurmi, three more Finns L. Lehtinen, THE TRACK EVENTS 47 L. Virtanen, and V. Iso-Hollo became prominent, but Lehtinen's victory in the 1932 5,000 m. was, to say the least, a little fortunate. 1 R. Hill (U.S.A.) after running an excellent race against the two Finns, Lehtinen and Virtanen, seemed to be baulked of his winning spurt by Lehtinen's uncertain movements across the track. Lehtinen won by the narrowest of margins, Hill sportingly refused to protest, and a new record of 14 min. 30 sec. was set up. (Plate 10.) In Berlin in 1936 the Finns were still supreme, and had Salminen, winner of the 10,000 m., not fallen over, it is likely that Finnish runners would have filled the first three positions as they had in the 10,000 m. As it was, G. Hockert made a new record of 14. min. 22-2 sec. (Plate 11.) Since 1936 Scandinavian runners have improved on most of the distance records, but no runner has held greater promise over the 5,000 m. than Sydney Wooderson (G.B.), who crowned his single season (1946), after leaving the mile, with a splendid victory in the European Games in a time nearly 14 sec. better than the Olympic record.

Tewanina, and eight years later Paavo Nurmi too, made it his first Olympic victory. J. G. Wilson (G.B.) led from the start, running stride by stride with Guillemot, with Nurmi 20 yds. behind. This continued for 15 laps and then Nurmi closed up. On the last lap Wilson was left, while Nurmi put in a very fast finish to beat Guillemot into second place. In 1924 Nurmi easily won the 10,000 m. cross-country race (since discontinued as being unsuitable for a summer event) and left the long track race to Ritola, who after a dogged race with E. Wide of Sweden, reduced his own world's record by 12-2 sec. Four years later, at Amsterdam, Nurmi beat Ritola and his record in 30 min. 18-8 sec. after a grand race. Nurmi's times were illuminating. The first lap, always fast, took 66-8 sec., the last 63-4 sec., and the third 70-2 sec. Apart from these the remaining twenty-two laps were all between 72-4 sec. and 74-3 sec. Harold Abrahams, who took the times, observed, \" I am quite certain that Nurmi and Ritola only recognized one opponent the stop- watch.\" This was Nurmi's last Olympiad. He planned to run in the Marathon at the 1932 Games, and it is likely that he would have set us a new standard in this event. But his career ended, unfortunately, in a dispute as to whether he was an amateur or not. Iso-Hollo and Virtanen, both Finns, were favourites for the race at Los Angeles. Kusocinski (Poland) was known to British spectators, but his form here had not been of Olympic class ; whereas Virtanen (\" the horse \") had particularly impressed when winning our 4 mis. championship in 1930. Kusocinski set a fast pace, the Finns hanging on in their usual dangerous style. The time for the first 5,000 m. was 14 min. 56 sec. This was practically the winning 5,000 m. time in 1920 ! Iso-Hollo alone was able to stay with the Pole, who ran a very fast last lap to win by 10 yds. in Olympic record time of 30 min. 11-4 sec. In 1936 the three Finns Salminen, Askola and Iso-Hollo were hard pressed until the last lap by the diminutive Japanese runner Murakoso. Salminen won in slightly worse than the Los Angeles time. In this race the British champion J. C. Burns ran one of his best races to finish fifth. Burns from Elswick in Northumberland, was one PLATE 5 Above (left) : J.

V. Iso-Hollo Finland THE 3,000 METRES STEEPLECHASE Conditions for this event have varied so much that little attention can be paid to times. Normally the course should consist of eight grass laps in each of which is one water jump with a hedge and four flights of hurdles. Taking the water-jump without getting too chilled and sodden in the process is the chief art of steeplechasing. The best performers manage to skip quickly in and out of the further and shallow end. This event naturally calls for great stamina, and has been adopted by the Finns since the days of Britain's Percy Hodge (Plate 8). But before then, in 1900 Britain had placed the first three, Rimmer, Bennett and Robinson. Nurmi's great rival Ritola won the event in 1924, and in 1928 Nurmi himself competed. On this occasion the course was a very poor one. Nurmi held the lead with his comrade Loukola until the fifth lap when Loukola, who had been running with Finnish regularity, left him and went away for an easy victory. At Los Angeles Great Britain was represented by \" the Salford Twins,\" T. Evenson and G. W. Bailey, both of whom reached the final, Evenson, along with V. Iso-Hollo (Finland), beating the Olympic record in his heat. The Britons ran doggedly. Evenson, Bailey, Iso-Hollo and McCluskey (U.S.A.) were well together until two laps from home when 50 THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES Iso-Hollo began his winning' effort. Evenson was second and Bailey fifth. The slow time was accounted for by the runners covering an extra lap by mistake ! Iso-Hollo kept his title at Berlin, after a very fast race with K. Tuominen, also of Finland. (Plate 8.) RESULTS 1900 (2,500 metres) G. W. Orton U.S.A. 7 min. 34 sec. 1900 (4,000 metres) C. Rimmer G.B. 12 min. 58-4 sec. 1904 (2,500 metres) J. D.

Dompert Germany THE 400 METRES RELAY Relay-racing began with the Greeks, who passed a lighted torch from one competitor to another, but we know little of the torch race; it was not an Olympic event. In modern times the University of Pennsylvania developed the relay race and the first of such contests to be held in Great Britain was in 1895 when it was described as a \" Flying Squadron Race.\" The novelty was not immediately popular and it was not till 1911 that the first A.A.A. relay championship was held. The 400 m. relay was introduced into the Stockholm Games of 1912. There are two kinds of short relay, the shuttle and the continuous. The first is backwards and forwards where one runner touches or passes his team-mate (or breaks a tape which releases his fellow's starting-gate), the second, as in the Olympic Games, is where a baton (a short stick or tube) is passed from one runner to another as they race round the track. The take-over must be effected between two lines 20 yds. apart, and is a manoeuvre requiring much practice. It is noticeable from a Greek vase drawing of a take-over that the torch was handed over with THE TRACK EVENTS 51 the left hand, received with the right and immediately changed over to the left. This has been rediscovered to be the surest method and is generally practised. In a short race it is the responsibility of the incoming runner to place the baton into the hand of his successor, who must be travelling at a fair speed when he receives it, and should not have to glance or twist his body from the sprinting position. One reason for the supremacy of the Americans is that they have a standard stance, whereby the receiver places the fingers of his right hand on his hip-bone, with the thumb tucked out of the way, forming a rack into which the giver posts the baton. Thus by a fixed drill the human variation is reduced, and runners can form any combination with confidence. It follows that, to a practised sprint team, each runner but the first has an effective flying start, which will produce a much faster speed than any single sprinter can attain in 100 m. Britain's solitary success was at Stockholm in 1912, when W. R. Applegarth, D. H. Jacobs, V. H. A. D'Arcy, and H. M. Macintosh defeated Sweden. Since then the figures of the results below tell their own story of steady improvement on the part of successive American teams, their standard of sprinting and taking-over being so high that the United States could usually have produced several teams each cap- able of beating all comers. Frank Wykoff (U.S.A.) was in his country's teams in 1928, 1932, and 1936, each of which broke the previous record. But it is the general and not only the American standard that has risen so extraordinarily. At Berlin the teams of eleven nations beat the British winning time of 1912.

Great Britain's first victory was gained in 1920 when C. Griffiths, R. Lindsay, Ains- worth Davis and Guy Butler averaged 50-5 seconds for their \"legs,\" or stages. Butler was given a start over Bevil Rudd (S. Africa) in the last stage which he substantially increased. The United States beat their own record in 1924 and again in 1928, when the British team's baton-changing was shaky, and D. G. A. Lowe ran a 47-6 sec. \" leg \" in a hopeless chase. Germany was second, also beating the previous record. At Los Angeles the United States with three fresh runners plus W. Carr, the Olympic champion, knocked as much as 6 sec. off the record, Godfrey Rampling showing something of his best form in the British team which was second. The British team for 1936 consisted of the A. A. A. champions for 1933 (F. F. Wolff) ; 1934 (G. Rampling) ; 1935 (W. Roberts) ; and 1936 (A. G. K. Brown). The Americans were able to run four fresh men (H. Cagle, R. C. Young, E. T. O'Brien, and A. L. Fitch), not tired, as Rampling, Roberts and Brown were, by 400 m. races. But Britain, chiefly owing to a magnificent run by G. Rampling, who went from fourth place to first, won, in a little less than the 1932 record time (Plate 6), the runners averaging 47*25 sec., over three seconds per man faster than in the previous British victory of 1920.
