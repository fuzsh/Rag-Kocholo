I look forward to a long and prosperous collaboration with UMG. It feels good to be home.\n\nWith this latest development, Roc Nation truly becomes its own 360 entity.

All of us at UMG are thrilled that JAY and Roc Nation chose UMG as their partners, knowing we will support their artists with a level of resources, expertise and passion that is simply unmatched in the industry.”\n\nShawn “JAY Z” Carter adds,\n\n“We are looking forward to working with Lucian and the incredible team he’s assembled at Universal. We would like to applaud Lucian for collaborating with us to strike a new age deal. This agreement presents a unique opportunity for Roc Nation’s artists—being able to continue to operate as an independent label with the strength, power and reach of the best major. I look forward to a long and prosperous collaboration with UMG. It feels good to be home.”\n\nJay-Z, the iconic rapper and businessman, has done it again.
