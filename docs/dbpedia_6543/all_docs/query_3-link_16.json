        "text": "Strategic brand partnerships for music artists have become a lucrative alternative to live performances during the coronavirus pandemic. At Roc Nation, one standout collaboration last year was Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Alicia Keys and American Express AXP for the company’s Unstaged digital music series that featured a virtual concert ahead of the artist’s Alicia album drop last fall.\n\nYesterday Roc Nation brought together American rapper Megan Thee Stallion and Grubhub GRUB for its Sound Bites program. The singer, who recently won a 2021 Grammy Award for Best New Artist, headlined Grubhub’s virtual concert benefiting World Central Kitchen. The performance, led by First Tube Media, also featured an interactive Q&A session, signaling that artists and brands are raising the bar for collaborations and turning them into immersive music experiences that prove valuable to everyone involved.\n\nRoc Nation Senior Vice President of Branding and Strategic Partnerships, Daniel Kinney, says, “2020 shook everyone to their core. We were fortunate that we had at Roc Nation one of–if not the best–years that we’ve had in this division in terms of putting together brand partnerships, and that was largely a testament to the fact that we have a lot of great clients who didn’t stop working.”\n\nFrom the Roc Nation Brunch (American Express and Saks Fifth Avenue, among other brands), to the Super Bowl (Roc Nation’s N.F.L. partnership), the record label and management company started 2020 on a high note. However, the high relevance, activations and seven-figure deals dropped soon after lockdowns began, according to Kinney.\n\nAs the company’s go-to for securing individual artist deals and forming strategic partnerships around Roc Nation entertainment events, Kinney says that advertising–in the form of product shoots, independently-made content and projects on location–rebounded quickly through creative planning and strict adherence to pandemic safety guidelines.\n\n\"We have seen terrific growth in brand partnerships over the past year alone, and we believe that upward trajectory will continue,\" says Brett Yormark, co-CEO of Roc Nation Unified. \"The events of the past year have forced us all to think creatively about how to diversify the revenue streams that our clients bring in, and it has made creating authentic relationships with brands even more important.\"\n\nRoc Nation's music partnerships group increased its commercial partnerships in 2020 compared to the year prior, according to a Roc Nation spokesperson. While exact numbers were not disclosed, recent high-value content deals included Alicia Keys (American Express, Verizon VZ and Mercedes Benz), Big Sean (McDonalds MCD , Don Juilo and Budwiser), Megan Thee Stallion (Revlon REV , Coach, Warner Brothers, Tinder and Calvin Klein), Meek Mill (Bacardi) and Miguel (Maserati and Dell).\n\nSome of the new partnerships also featured charitable components, including Alicia Keys/Verizon (small businesses), Rapsody/Patron (Black-owned, small businesses), Megan Thee Stallion/Coach (holiday clothing drive) and Big Sean/McDonald's (mentorship).\n\nKinney says that partnerships with Fortune 400 companies are on the rise, helping promote an artist’s overall brand and upcoming projects. The trend has enabled Roc Nation to break into new categories including telecommunications, fashion, beauty and skincare.\n\nMany of Roc Nation’s partners have seemingly found their footing, at least enough to be able to piece together a plan for 2021. Kinney plans to focus this year on maximizing opportunities with hopes of returning to more formalized business operations in 2022, dependent on the course of the pandemic.\n\nPartnerships are proving successful for two reasons, Kinney explains. Many artists continued releasing new music last year, and many of them did not shy away from public-facing projects. One such star was Alicia Keys with her release of “Good Job” and launch of an Out There for Us campaign honoring medical and other front line workers in the pandemic. She also garnered support for small businesses struggling during lockdowns.\n\n“Alicia is someone who is incredibly graceful and a beacon of hope in the community, and to the people at large,” Kinney says. “It was very impactful to see somebody on that level publicly working on a number of those causes.”\n\nRoc Nation’s successful artist-brand partnerships, Kinney adds, have inspired newcomers on the scene to inquire about creating impactful, authentic deals. He has taken on a variety of new partnerships across industries, including everything from spirits (restaurants and bars) to wireless technology (Verizon). The efforts have increased awareness and fundraising for the pandemic and social justice.\n\nBy leading conversations around inclusivity, equality and justice, Roc Nation was able to easily align with clients committed to the same standards. According to Kinney, the company was also better able to support many of its prominent clients speaking out about related issues.\n\n“Artists have a point of view and very strongly-articulated vision of themselves and what they stand for in the public arena,” Kinney says. “That can sometimes be a little trickier to navigate in the advertising world, but it’s what people want and what they gravitate towards because, at the end of the day, it’s more authentic.”"
