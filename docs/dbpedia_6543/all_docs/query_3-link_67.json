        "text": "“Early on, Andre was able to see hip-hop as a lifestyle,” says Harrell’s greatest protégé, Sean “Diddy” Combs. “He showed us how to use it to build a Black economy.”\n\nOriginally a teen rapper as half of the duo Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde, the New York City native started his career at Def Jam and soon launched Uptown Records. Perhaps it was his sales background, but more than his contemporaries, Harrell injected lifestyle into his operations, propelling “ghetto-fabulous” from a mantra into a corporate blueprint. Uptown was a powerhouse during the ’80s and ’90s, launching the careers of Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, Al B. Sure!, Guy, Heavy D & the Boyz and not least, Combs, an intern-turned-A&R-whiz whom Harrell famously fired essentially for insubordination, leading to the formation of Bad Boy Records. (“I fired him to make him rich,” Harrell later said.)\n\nHe left Uptown to become president of Motown Records, expanded into film and television with “Strictly Business” (a launching pad for Halle Berry) and “New York Undercover,” and later reunited with Combs as president of Bad Boy and vice chairman of Revolt TV. His greatest success, though, was arguably as a mentor. “When he saw hip-hop, he saw something bigger,” Diddy says. “He didn’t minimize it the way it had been minimized — he really saw it globally. When people were first making the music, Andre was dreaming big and preparing us for what hip-hop is today.”\n\nBronx-born Lighty was co-founder (with Mona Scott-Young) of Violator Management — where he negotiated 50 Cent’s deal with Vitaminwater, which ended up netting the rapper a reported $100 million — and worked at Rush Management and Def Jam, Jive and Loud Records. We’ll let his longtime friend Busta Rhymes take it from here:\n\nChris Lighty is truly the greatest manager that has ever lived.\n\nI met Mona Scott-Young because of Chris Lighty.\n\nChris Lighty is a Taurus like me.\n\nChris is the big brother I never had.\n\nI am one of the first Violator artists. When Rush Management was coming to an end, Lyor Cohen asked the reps which artists they would take with them to start their own shit.\n\nChris said the Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and us, Leaders of the New School, and started Violator. The others went in different directions, and when Leaders of the New School broke up, I stayed with Chris.\n\nAt this point, I was the only Violator Management artist.\n\nWhat I was fortunate to have with Chris was his undivided attention.\n\nHis care. His education.\n\nThat big brother that I wish I had. Leadership.\n\nHe had the streets, and he had my back.\n\nAnd what happened with me and him was my first solo album was a success and is what contributed in the most significant way to the growth of Violator.\n\nEvery artist saw what he did with me and what I did with him, and it helped Violator become one of the world’s biggest management companies.\n\nWhen Mona Scott-Young and Chris Lighty got together, they created something that had never been seen on that level before. There will never be another Violator.\n\nAnd there will never be another movement that can compete or compare to the level of greatness of Chris and Mona as individuals.\n\nAnd especially how unfuckwitable they were when they were together.\n\nI love them so much. They were everything to a lot of our lives.\n\nRest in Peace to the greatest to ever do it, Chris Lighty, and I’m grateful still to have Mona Scott-Young as a part of my evolution.\n\nViolator for life!\n\nIf there are true O.G.s of the hip-hop record industry, it’s the late Sylvia Robinson and her husband Joe, co-founders of Sugar Hill Records, which in 1979 released what is universally considered the first rap single, Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight.” A music-biz veteran, Robinson had been a singer-guitarist — as half of the Mickey & Sylvia duo, who scored a 1957 smash with “Love Is Strange,” and her own 1973 hit “Pillow Talk” — and a producer. With Joe, she founded the ’70s R&B label All Platinum.\n\nBut the label hit hard times and folded, and one day Sylvia famously walked into the Harlem World disco and saw early rapper Lovebug Starski performing. “She saw him and thought, ‘This is something,’” says author Nelson George, a former Billboard journalist who may have been the first person ever to write about rap. Starski turned them down, so Sylvia simply looked for another rapper and found three, who became the Sugarhill Gang. “And once that worked,” George says, “they were smart enough to see that there was a whole community of artists who weren’t being signed.”\n\nThe pair made a formidable team. “If you had a cast a tough, Black, gangstery guy from the ’70s for a movie, Joe would have been perfect,” George says. “He had a gravelly voice, he was very brusque, he liked to curse. But Sylvia was charming and sexy in an old-school way, and she could seem sweet, although she was as tough as he was. She had a great eye for talent, she was the one who dealt with the artists and she was the one in the studio. The dark side, of course, is they also had the old record-business practices: They paid very little in advances or royalties, and when I visited the offices, let’s say there were a couple of questionable characters there. But to be fair, it wasn’t like they decided just rip off those kids — that’s just how it was done back then.”\n\nOver the next couple of years, the company released some of the most pivotal singles of early hip-hop, particularly Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s “The Message” — arguably the first socially conscious hip-hop single — and the anti-drug “White Lines.” Yet the company’s artist-unfriendly business practices and association with notorious mob-connected executive Morris Levy brought it down as quickly as it rose. However, she’d changed the world.\n\n“Rapping was this public secret that a lot of people saw happening,” George says. “And she was the one who had the foresight to say, ‘This is something that should be recorded’ — very, very few other people saw it that way. Whether she ripped off artists is another thing, but she had the vision, she took the risks, and she did something extraordinary. And we have to give her the ultimate respect for that.”\n\nScott-Young got her start managing the production team the Trackmasters, who introduced the young exec to Chris Lighty. Together, they co-founded the mighty management vehicle Violator and made history guiding the careers of some of hiphop’s hottest stars, including 50 Cent, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott. Next finding her footing in TV, Scott-Young and her production company Monami Entertainment hit the jackpot with a Jim Jones-helmed show called “Love & Hip Hop” that would see a slew of spinoffs inject new interest in maturing acts and launch colossal careers, including Cardi B’s. Let’s not forget to raise a glass of MYX Fusions to Scott-Young (who co-owns the Moscato brand with Nicki Minaj) for her work as a novelist and philanthropist as well.\n\nBelow, Busta Rhymes pays tribute to his longtime manager:\n\nOutside of my mother, I don’t know if another woman has been as close to helping me grow as a man, an executive, and a human being outside Mona Scott-Young.\n\nShe was the manager of my life, both personally and professionally. And as a manager, that responsibility comes with being available for you as much as you are available for your child or husband.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what day or time it is. If there’s a crisis, they have to answer the phone. They have to troubleshoot. They have to find a solution.\n\nSometimes they cry with you because they are so involved. They have a deep-rooted emotional connection that surpasses business.\n\nI don’t know what I would be without Mona.\n\nMy mother loves Mona. Mona loves my mother. I love Mona’s mother.\n\nTimes I had to go to court for shit I was troubled for, and Mona’s mom would pray for me and with me. She would make the congregation of her followers in her faith pray for me. Mona’s mom is a profound Christian leader in Haiti; she would have all her people pray for me from all the way over there. Put the right blessed energy into the universe to protect me from whatever negativity could come my way when I was going through these troubles and challenges.\n\nMona is someone that I love beyond description.\n\nOne of the greatest nurturers.\n\nOne of the greatest protectors.\n\nOne of the greatest mothers.\n\nOne of the greatest friends.\n\nOne of the greatest executives in music and outside of music.\n\nWe should all bow down and kiss her ring as one of the greatest to ever do it, not only as a manager but as a multifaceted trailblazer when it comes to being a success story and when it comes to being an executive of all executives.\n\nShe’s the only person that has had such an impact on my life as a manager, and as a friend who has been a source of inspiration to me with how much she has shown me, she loves me through my good and bad.\n\nI’d do absolutely anything for Mona. I love Mona Scott-Young, and I’ll love Mona Scott-Young forever.\n\nViolator for life!\n\nA veteran label and publishing executive, Shakir Stewart was a native of Oakland, Calif. But he made his name in Atlanta, where he threw parties and concerts while attending Morehouse College. He later flipped those profits to purchase a recording studio when he and a group of friends launched music publishing company Noontime.\n\n“He was a real ally,” his former business partner Chris Hicks tells Variety. “We had a healthy competition, but we were also there for each other.”\n\nKnown for his magnetic personality, sense of humor and work ethic, “Shake” was recruited by LaFace Records co-founder L.A. Reid initially to work at Hitco Publishing. He soon signed Beyoncé to her first publishing deal as well as Philly rapper Beanie Sigel. He rose through the ranks at Hitco and in 2000, Reid made Stewart an A&R consultant at LaFace, where he would sign Ciara. But his career really took off when he followed Reid to Def Jam Records, where he played a huge role int he rise of Southern hip-hop by signing rappers Young Jeezy and Rick Ross, both of whom would go on to record multiplatinum albums for the label.\n\n“The South wasn’t really known for dominating the music space at the time,” says Asylum Records/Atlantic Records exec VP of A&R Dallas Martin, Stewart’s former intern and protégé. “I think him signing artists like Jeezy and Ross made everybody realize the South was taking over in the music world. He was at the forefront of believing those artists could be platinum.”\n\nJeezy recalls meeting Stewart in an Atlanta nightclub in 2003, although he didn’t realize he was a top A&R executive at the time. By the time he did, He’d released a pair of hot mixtapes and was being pursued by four labels, but signing with Def Jam took him to another level. “I really had my mind made up on Shakir Stewart,” Jeezy says. “He was a confidante, a friend, and he was out here on the front line with me. Any project I ever do, I still give Shakir an executive producer credit. He didn’t seem like an executive — he seemed like your brother.”\n\nStewart was named an executive VP at Def Jam Recordings in June 2008, only four months before he died, apparently by his own hand, at the age of 34.\n\n“He had as much talent as me — he just didn’t get the opportunity to make it this far with us,” says Sony Music Publishing chairman-CEO Jon Platt. “The people who have the opportunity to make the most impact are the people who really live the culture — and Shake really lived the culture.”"
