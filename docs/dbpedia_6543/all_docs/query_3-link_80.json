        "text": "When it comes to the music industry, a healthy and supportive label can mean the difference between stardom and failure. Sure, most of the immediate attention around a hot new song or album concerns the artist that created it. However, labels often help these creators get to that point of success, whether through financial support or through keen mentorship. Over time, many record companies build a stacked catalog of either varied stars or a tightly curated sound. Still, much conversation around labels these days (especially the most successful ones) concerns how they might mistreat, exploit, or fail to properly compensate their roster. Many within hip-hop could relate to that experience, and thus chose to take matters into their own hands.\n\nPerhaps more than in any other genre, rappers and producers quickly cemented their industry legacy in various ways. Many of the biggest rap stars of all time either spearheaded their labels, started their own, or made huge business moves to become entrepreneurs within the music world. Great labels can inspire change, provide employment opportunities, and create a space of community and support within a volatile industry. Of course, things don’t always pan out perfectly, but many labels in the rap game etched themselves into its history books for reasons larger than the sum of their sometimes controversial parts.\n\nTo celebrate Black History Month, we compiled a list of some of the most iconic Black-founded hip-hop labels. A few notes before the list begins in no particular order. First, this list includes record labels which were founded or co-founded by Black artists, entrepreneurs, producers, etc. Of course, many of these labels have parent companies; in other words, the larger music group conglomerate that distributes its releases. Still, these labels appear on the list because at one point in time or another, they represented (or represent) independence, creativity, artistic progression, commercial success or stability, community, innovation, or some or all of the above. We’ll also include some notable releases from each label, although there are many, many more iconic releases than what we’ve listed for each group.\n\nThere are too many iconic hip-hop labels to summarize perfectly in one list. So, with that said, let us know in the comments down below which are some of the most impactful Black-owned labels in your opinion, whether in hip-hop or beyond. Also, we recommend you search for independent record labels in your area of interest, as they can yield incredible and undiscovered talent. It’s that next generation of Black artists, businesspeople, entrepreneurs, and creatives that will continue to redefine the music industry. With all that said, let’s take a look at some of the biggest labels in hip-hop history.\n\nSugar Hill Records\n\nKicking off this list is, arguably, the label that started it all. Sugar Hill Records is responsible for some of the most essential and groundbreaking records in old school hip-hop in every metric. Sylvia Robinson founded this label with her husband Joe in 1986, along with Milton Madden and funding from Roulette Records. Sylvia already found artistic success in the 1950s and stepped into more of a producer role the next decade. With Grammy Award-winning experience working with Ike and Tina Turner, she created much of the blueprints for hip-hop’s pillars we take for granted today. She released the first rap single to dominate the charts and sell over a million copies with The Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” (controversy aside). Also, she highlighted more established hip-hop acts like the legendary Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, who popularized the DJ as a musician and promoted social consciousness within their messaging.\n\nWith other artists like The Funky 4 + 1 and The Treacherous Three, Sylvia and Joe built one of the most successful and significant independent labels of its time in a few years. Unfortunately, Sugar Hill is now defunct following a distribution deal with MCA Records. While much of Sylvia’s work and talent went uncredited, she’s considered one of, if not the godmother of hip-hop. Much of Sugar Hill’s records are incredible distillations of what we know as rap today, and they set the groundwork for future independent companies from an artistic and business-minded standpoint. Hip-hop was born years before Sugar Hill, but Sylvia and Joe were among the first forces to stamp it in the music industry and commercial pop culture at large.\n\nBad Boy Records\n\nWhen Sean “Diddy” Combs was fired from his A&R job at Uptown Records, he knew that his skill at curation and ear for quality hip-hop couldn’t be squandered. As such, he founded Bad Boy Records in 1993, one of the most successful hip-hop labels of all time. To start, their catalog of artists represents titans of hip-hop and R&B in the ‘90s and 2000s. Faith Evans, The LOX, Craig Mack, Mase, Diddy himself, producers like Easy Mo Bee, Yung Joc, and of course the legendary Biggie Smalls. Sure, it had its ups and downs in its 30-year history, but the Bad Boy collective carved their name into East Coast hip-hop like few other labels have. In fact, although their output is more reserved, they continue to release significant albums in the music landscape.\n\nMost recently, Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, among a heap of additional critical and fan acclaim. Meanwhile, the label represents one of the most notable genre crossover artists in Machine Gun Kelly, whose latest album Mainstream Sellout saw much commercial success as well. With all that said, Bad Boy Records successfully shifted its focus across its history, and laid the groundwork for one of hip-hop’s billionaires. Diddy’s industry success, and the legacies of the rest of the Bad Boy crew, transcended far beyond label boundaries. Still, one can’t help but imagine what Bad Boy could’ve been if tragic events hadn’t marked its history so deeply. Much of the discussion around the label in the ‘90s concerned a rivalry with another imprint that caused a seismic shift in the genre, on the other side of the country.\n\nDeath Row Records\n\nWhen it comes to West Coast rap, few labels are as well-known, influential, and notorious as Death Row. Founded by Dr. Dre, Suge Knight, Dick Griffey, and The D.O.C. in 1991, the label became home to some of the most influential West Coast records of all time. Their first record was Dr. Dre’s The Chronic, which took G-funk to new heights and established the careers of label artists like Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, and Daz Dillinger. What followed were some of the most successful and beloved rap albums of the time, especially after they signed 2Pac in 1995. Also, the sheer popularity and gritty glamor of the collective’s aesthetic, their movement, and their public personas influenced rappers for decades to come. Even more so after their beef with Bad Boy Records, Death Row was as much of a philosophy as it was a brand.\n\nHowever, that philosophy ended up becoming dangerous. Multiple losses on both sides, such as Pac and Biggie, meant tragic outcomes for both camps. In Death Row’s case, they didn’t fully recover after the conflict, as there were already internal battles between Dre, Pac, and the label executives. Despite its murky history, the label released art that impacted millions, regardless of the circumstances of its creation. In fact, Snoop Dogg recently bought the label from MNRK Music Group last year, so perhaps there will be a different ending to the Death Row story. As many other labels have done, maybe a new generation of Death Row artists will sidestep the label’s past struggles and capitalize on the music that made it truly special.\n\nRuthless Records\n\nBefore Death Row, however, there was Ruthless Records. Eazy-E founded the label in 1987 alongside Jerry Heller. What started out as recordings in Eazy’s parents’ garage became some of the most influential tracks and albums in West Coast hip-hop. Through close collaboration and a relentless desire to do things their way, artists like N.W.A forged monumental careers. While internal discussions and money eventually got in the way of its key members, their influence during those days established them as leaders of the West Coast. Dr. Dre went on to co-found Death Row, and Ice Cube founded Street Knowledge Records, now known as Lench Mob. During this time, a lot of label turmoil was still being figured out in hip-hop, but it didn’t stop anyone from putting out impactful music.\n\nStill, the Ruthless roster stands among many other West Coast pioneers who also contributed to the scene’s success. What makes this label special are its impressive and distant bookends. First, the gritty depictions of street life, hard-hitting production, and gangster attitudes that radicalized late ‘80s hip-hop. Then came Bone Thugs-n-Harmony in the mid ‘90s, who themselves laid some of the groundwork for the most popular sounds of today. The Ohio group not only proved Eazy-E had the vision to lead Ruthless to other scenes and movements in hip-hop, but were also one of the first to pioneer trap music in its prototypical stages. Perhaps Death Row gets a bit more name recognition these days, but Ruthless remains arguably one of the most enduringly influential labels in hip-hop history.\n\nCash Money Records\n\nOur first Southern representative on this list was founded by two brothers, Ronald “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With a desire to overcome poverty from rough upbringings, the label became the genre’s biggest revolution in years. In its early days, Cash Money established itself thanks to keen curation, which turned the streets' favorites into hit artists. With a few years of experience under their belt, they signed Lil Wayne and Juvenile in 2006, and would go on to include Nicki Minaj, Drake, Jacquees, DJ Khaled, and many more (under Young Money, a later imprint of Cash Money started by Lil Wayne). Albums were selling millions of copies and many of these projects ended up defining much of the 2000s bling era. Weezy, for example, is just as well-known for his mixtape series as he is for his classic albums.\n\nOf course, eventually Cash Money’s biggest players ended up moving on. Wayne in particular had a lot of issues with Birdman surrounding the release of Tha Carter V, and a lot of those label tensions could’ve boiled over into other careers. Nicki Minaj, for example, is on Lil Wayne’s Young Money label, which used to be an imprint and later partner of Cash Money (or YMCMB). Regardless of how things have shifted, Cash Money continues this list’s trend of influential labels defining how future ones could operate. Birdman even played a hand in the rise of artists like Young Thug, who not only has beef with his idol Lil Wayne but created a whole generation of clones of his own. Many of today’s most traveled roads in rap were paved by the sound Cash Money championed.\n\nNo Limit Records\n\nNo Limit’s history slightly mirrors that of Cash Money, at least at first glance. Similar come-up in 1991, reached mainstream success from the mid ’90s to the 2000s, and so on. Percy “Master P” Miller started to sell his recordings through a small storefront, seeking out and signing local California talent. However, given he’s from New Orleans, the sound of No Limit was something more new from the jump. Eventually the label relocated to his home city in Louisiana in 1995, and found more MCs hungry to succeed. Within two years, No Limit was one of the more commercially successful labels of the moment. They dropped movie soundtracks and signed the one and only Snoop Dogg after his Death Row exit.\n\nWhile No Limit’s music wasn’t a critical darling, its artists were so prolific and idiosyncratic that they connected with audiences in a way few other rap labels could. Though all good things came to an end, they represented yet another fresh take on the game. At the time, there was still had a bit of binary bias between West and East. While No Limit is no more, it lives on through No Limit Forever Records, founded by P’s son Romeo Miller. Their groovy, raw, and relentless run of albums in the ‘90s and 2000s was quite impressive as a new player. Also, dozens of rappers have spoken on how Master P shaped their consumption of the art form. During a time in which labels seem to want to put more music out than ever, perhaps No Limit set a blueprint for how artists could make that supply and demand work.\n\nDef Jam Recordings\n\nOf all the labels on this list, Def Jam might be the broadest selection, the most difficult to talk about, and the hardest to summarize in two paragraphs. After linking with producer Rick Rubin, Russell Simmons built upon some of his industry experience to build an empire. Early signees included some of hip-hop’s most impactful innovators: Run-DMC, LL Cool J, and The Beastie Boys. Then came Jay-Z, DMX, Kanye West, Redman, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Big Sean, Frank Ocean, Pusha T, and so many more. Artists either formed gargantuan careers starting off in Def Jam or have arrived at it as established superstars. The sheer variety of genres and styles, the businesses it’s directly and indirectly created, and its broad influence is outstanding.\n\nHowever, with such a wide pool, you’re bound to have some sharks in the water. In many ways, Def Jam’s size and versatility emphasizes everything a label can be. It can be freeing, restrictive, personal, cold, rewarding, unforgiving, the best thing to happen to your career, the music business screwing you over, or all those things at once. In fact, Simmons is no longer even on the board as executive due to various accusations of sexual assault. Despite that, this label gave artists the experience and infrastructure knwoledge to excel independently, at least in some cases. Even with excitement around Def Jam disappearing with time and context, many of its artists are still invigorating and inspirational. No matter who you are, odds are that you will find something that moves you on this label’s discography.\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment\n\nOne of the top labels right now was founded almost twenty years ago. In 2003, after six years producing, Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffifth met a then-15-year-old Compton rapper named Kedrick Lamar. Eventually, TDE became a proper label with the help of Terrence “Punch” Henderson in 2004 and first started seeing commercial success thanks to successful mixtapes from Jay Rock. Soon after, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q joined, leading the four MCs to form Black Hippy in 2009. With later signees including SZA, Isaiah Rashad, and most recently Doechii, TDE represents commercially successful but artistically progressive hip-hop. For example, many consider Kendrick Lamar one of the greatest to ever do it. Now that he’s exited the label, they might wonder where they go from here.\n\nWell, so far, the incredible success and acclaim behind albums like SZA’s SOS, Zay’s The House Is Burning, and Ab-Soul’s Herbert quell all doubts of quality discographies coming through. Moreover, Doechii became one of the XXL Freshmen of 2022 and is one of the most beloved rising MCs. While some labels fall to either complete lack of notable output or too much infighting, TDE focused on its artistry. Of course, it hasn’t dodged those industry pitfalls, as release conflicts from behind the scenes, accusations of “mid” on the Internet, and the fact that TDE releases take a while still affect the label. However, for what it’s worth, they might have the highest batting average here and inspire many other independent labels.\n\nDreamville Records\n\nNext up is TDE’s biggest competition, although they actually feel more like kindred spirits. J. Cole founded Dreamville in 2007 with manager Ibrahim Hamad. Cole wanted to put music out, Hamad wanted to start a label, and within seven years they released the label’s first group mixtape Revenge of the Dreamers after Cole’s mainstream success. While their roster is often compared to TDE’s, they certainly shine as a unified label with just as much talent. Bas, Ari Lennox, JID, and EARTHGANG are just a few of the charismatic creators that push Dreamville forward today. Cole continues to do incredible things, but just like TDE, the newest names are the most exciting thing about it.\n\nJID reached rap royalty with 2022’s The Forever Story, which established him as a leader after already proving his skills. Much of the roster is entering what many would call their veteran years, but their music remains fresh and unencumbered. Let’s not forget their recent Gangsta Grillz tape with DJ Drama, which proves they can dominate on the home court or in another city. Dreamville also has a Foundation in Fayetteville, North Carolina that helped many of its community members through rough times. While many labels often engage in charitable endeavors and extracurriculars like film soundtracks and business deals, few artists come off as genuine, well-mentored, and prepared to take on those responsibilities as Dreamville’s artists do.\n\nGriselda Records\n\nFinally in this list, we have Griselda, the independent Buffalo, New York label with one of the most prolific and quality discographies in recent memory. Founded in 2021 by Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, and Mach-Hommy, the label was inspired by their experiences with drug dealing, their focused artistic visions, desire for independence, and building off of rap innovators like Roc Marciano. With the help of rapper Benny the Butcher and in-house producer Daringer, they cultivated a rebirth of hardcore hip-hop. Their beats feel incredibly atmospheric, gritty, and menacing, like the best grimy East Coast boom-bap of the 1990s. Their aesthetic creativity and business acumen in many areas has given each member an illustrious career of their own.\n\nSpeaking of Griselda’s roster, it includes the aforementioned wordsmiths plus some of the most respected MCs working today. There’s Boldy James, Rome Streetz, Armani Caesar, Jay Worthy, YN Billy, and Stove God Cooks. In fact, you can count the current Griselda roster with both hands. Even with Conway’s amicable departure, any one of those nine could likely body an average label roster today. Griselda is more than just a label in people’s minds. It’s almost more of a hivemind or a genre at this point. Few labels ever in hip-hop have been so easily identifiable and respected, not just because of their trademark style but because of the consistency of their output. More than any other label on this list, Griselda clearly has a very specific goal. They produce essential hip-hop music and get its hard-working artists a lot of cash, recognition, and freedom while doing so."
