        "text": "Samsung allegedly purchased one million copies of the album from Jay-Z at $5 each and would give away these copies to Samsung Galaxy users with the app. Jay-Z therefore earned $5 million upfront, making Magna Carta Holy Grail profitable before it was even released. Furthermore, Jay-Z allegedly received as much as $7.5 million in music rights and endorsement fees. Sources also put the value of Jay-Z’s entire deal with Samsung at close to $30 million, as opposed to the $20 million figure that the New York Post initially announced. This figure likely includes media spend.\n\nImplications\n\nThe deal between Samsung and Jay-Z makes Magna Carta Holy Grail the first major release to be premiered exclusively by a brand. As with many firsts, this deal raises a number of questions about the music business moving forward. Of particular focus here is the deal’s effect on music distribution. Jay-Z’s deal with Samsung would put music from his latest release directly into the hands of one million listeners. In this scenario, the three models of Samsung Galaxy smartphones aforementioned would function as distribution mediums. This raises the question as to whether smartphones are the future of music distribution.\n\nSamsung has been engaged in shifting from being a hardware manufacturer to also becoming a media platform. The company has recently been active in building its music and entertainment offerings. In May 2012, Samsung acquired mSpot, a mobile radio service offering music and video content. MSpot is now the developer of Samsung’s all-in-one music service, Music Hub, which includes streaming, cloud music storage, radio and a music store. For the release of Jay-Z’s album, Samsung itself developed the JAY Z Magna Carta app, through which the company would distribute the one million copies of the album. The firm was therefore actively involved in the distribution of Jay-Z’s album."
