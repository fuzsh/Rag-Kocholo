        "text": "The trio will work to enhance the New York economy with a new gaming destination in Times Square.\n\nCaesars Entertainment has joined forces with the full-service entertainment agency Roc Nation to transform Times Square into a “top tourist destination.” Roc Nation will represent Caesars and SL Green as an official entertainment partner in its bid for a new Times Square gaming facility, located at 1515 Broadway.\n\nShawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter founded Roc Nation in 2008. Since then, the company has worked with producers and recording artists throughout the entertainment industry.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Roc Nation will “help revitalize Times Square by partnering with neighborhood organizations.”\n\nCaesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said: “We are thrilled to have Roc Nation and JAY-Z join our partnership to bring Caesars Palace to Times Square. They are one of the most pioneering entertainment groups in the world, with New York embedded in their DNA.\n\n“Times Square has been the heartbeat of American Entertainment for over a century. Through our shared vision, we will build a world-class destination specifically designed to complement and elevate today’s Times Square experience, ensuring it remains a magnet for visitors and a hub of creativity for years to come.”\n\nJay-Z described the city as a “beacon” and said partnering with Caesars creates the perfect opportunity for New York’s future development.\n\nHe commented: \"New York is a beacon, the epicenter of culture. We have the opportunity to create a destination at the heart of Times Square, the true crossroads of the world.\n\n\"My partnership with SL Green and Caesars, this coalition, has all the promise and commitment to economic opportunity, growth and enrichment for the community, and everyone who visits the Empire State.\"\n\nSL Green CEO and Chairman Marc Holliday agreed with Jay-Z, stating the partnership is the perfect fit for the New York entertainment scene.\n\n“There’s no better partner than Jay-Z and Roc Nation to help Caesars Palace Times Square ensure that Times Square remains a global entertainment hub and an economic engine for New York."
