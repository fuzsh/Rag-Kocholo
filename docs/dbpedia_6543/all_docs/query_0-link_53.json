        "text": "Meek Mill and JAY-Z are continuing to leave their legacy on the culture.\n\nRecently, the pair sat down for an interview with CBS This Morning‘s Gayle King. Throughout their conversation, Meek and Jay spoke about their latest business venture, a new record label entitled Dream Chasers. The label is a joint venture between Jay’s Roc Nation and a new beginning for Meek.\n\nHip-hop’s first billionaire spoke about the importance of starting from the bottom before rising to the top.\n\n“The music and culture we create, you know we’ve been giving it away for so long. Which is understandable, you’ve got to start somewhere,” JAY-Z told King. “You’ve got to clean the floors up before you own the building but we don’t shine shoes anymore.”\n\nIt’s no surprise that Meek is inspired by JAY-Z and he’s expressed that throughout his career. The 32-year-old rapper revealed that his latest business venture with the Brooklyn emcee is a dream come true.\n\n“Coming into the music industry, of course, there’s always the people you admire, there’s not too many people I admire on a music level and a business level and on like, as a man level,” he began. “So doing business with Hova is like, like even when we talk I always explain it to him like that that was crazy, it’s a regular day for you but this is a part of my dreams being in this situation.”\n\nIn retrospect, this isn’t the first time that Jay and Meek have joined forces. Next month, “Free Meek” will premiere on Amazon. The five-part docu-series, which was produced by Jay, will provide an exclusive look at Meek’s efforts with criminal justice reform and more."
