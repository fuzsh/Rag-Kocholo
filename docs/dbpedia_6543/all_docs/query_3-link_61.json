In 2009, she launched her own digital marketing service, working with artists like Richie Hawtin and Seth Troxler.

Over the organization's twenty-year journey, Kanya's exceptional leadership has made MOBO a globally respected brand, championing diversity, inclusion, and recognition for Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) talent across various fields.\n\nBorn out of Kanya's determination and entrepreneurial spirit, the MOBO Awards started in 1996, defying industry trends and celebrating black music at a time when it was overshadowed by Britpop. Kanya's relentless efforts and financial commitment, including re-mortgaging her house, led to the success of the inaugural event, setting the stage for MOBO to become a driving force in British urban music.\n\nUnder Kanya's guidance, MOBO not only became a prestigious awards ceremony but evolved into an iconic brand with year-round initiatives, including the MOBO UnSung talent competition and an artist development program.

Her early experiences as an artist and songwriter drove her pursuit of understanding the intricacies of the recording process.\n\nWith a background in engineering and classical training, Emily honed her mastering skills, working with industry giants and eventually founding her own studio, The Lodge, in downtown New York.\n\nThe walls of The Lodge studio are lined with classic platinum records and music memorabilia. As a hub that has hosted renowned artists like Dave Grohl, the B-52s and Garbage, the studio remains a finishing school for major albums in music history. Lazar set up shop in 1997 and her mastering skills soon brought in a clientele as eclectic as the genres in the industry, from Wu-Tang Clan and Linkin Park to The Shins.\n\nEmily Lazar has garnered two Grammy nominations for her outstanding work in the final stages of preparing albums for release. Her first nomination was for the Foo Fighters' \"Wasting Light\" in 2011, and in 2015, she is nominated for her contribution to Sia's widely recognized pop hit, \"Chandelier.\"\n\nIn 2019, Lazar made history as the first female mastering engineer to win a Grammy for Best Engineered Album (Non-Classical) with Beck's \"Colors.\" In 2021, she achieved another milestone by securing three Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, earning praise from Chris Martin of Coldplay for her crucial role in enhancing their latest album's sound.\n\nAs a mastering engineer, Emily views her work as a creative process, emphasizing collaboration with artists to preserve the integrity of their mixes.\n\nShe pioneered \"stem mastering,\" working with separate files for mix elements, to provide greater flexibility and control in achieving desired results.\n\nEmily navigates the challenges of the loudness wars, emphasizing the importance of maintaining artistic intent while meeting distribution requirements. Beyond technical aspects, Emily prioritizes conversations about vibe, color, and storytelling in her work. For her, mastering is like midwifery, facilitating the birth of a musical creation. Emily's commitment to helping artists realize their vision is reflected in her approach, making her a sought-after figure in the industry.\n\nThe impasse puts both Universal and TikTok at risk, with potential consequences for artist promotion and the platform's user experience. Previous deals with other labels, like Warner Music, did not face similar challenges, indicating unique complexities in negotiations between Universal and TikTok.\n\nUMG's TikTok \"time out\" also impacts publishing clients, affecting artists such as Sophie Ellis Bextor (whose song \"Murder on the Dance Floor\" went viral on TikTok 22 years after its release, following its feature in the movie \"Saltburn\"), Harry Styles, Bicep, Rina Sawayama, and Fred Again..., whose hits have disappeared from TikTok.\n\nA resolution is critical for the music industry, as the absence of Universal's vast catalog on TikTok could have long-term damaging effects for all involved, straining relationships with affected labels and stakeholders.\n\nTikTok’s Response\n\nTikTok's influence on global music consumption is indisputable. Songs, like Jain's \"Makeba,\" published long ago, can suddenly become mega-hits. TikTok helped elevate Tate McRae's 'Exes' and 'Greedy' to her first number one song. Many more chart-toppers such as Ice Spice’s “Munch (Feelin’ U)” are attributed to TikTok's viral video trends.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 30, 2024, TikTok responded to Universal Music Group's decision with disappointment, accusing the label of prioritizing greed over the interests of artists and songwriters.\n\nTikTok dismissed Universal's narrative as false, emphasizing successful 'artist-first' agreements with all other labels and publishers. The statement suggests that Universal's actions are not aligned with the best interests of artists, songwriters, and fans, highlighting TikTok's role as a powerful, free promotional and discovery tool for talent.\n\nFan Reactions\n\nUniversal Music Group's removal of Taylor Swift's music and songs from other major artists elicited shock and disappointment from fans on TikTok. Some humorously suggested Swift create a \"TikTok Version\" of her albums.\n\nMusicians like Euan Blackman and Talia Sporkin shared their versions, while influencers joined the trend with comical cover videos. Independent artists seized the opportunity to promote their original work in the absence of UMG's big names on TikTok.\n\nUMG vs TikTok: Can this deadlock be resolved?\n\nUniversal Music Group's TikTok withdrawal and its issued \"time-out\" mark a crucial moment in the music business, raising questions about the future of licensing agreements and the delicate balance between artists, platforms, and industry giants. Can this deadlock be resolved, or will it redefine the landscape of music industry partnerships? The outcome will undoubtedly shape the future dynamics of licensing agreements and collaborations between artists and digital platforms."
