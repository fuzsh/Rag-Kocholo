        "text": "This story is part of our new Hip-Hop: ’73 Till Infinity series, a celebration of the genre’s 50th anniversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing that sets hip-hop apart from other music genres is its strong commercialism. From Run–D.M.C. signing hip-hop’s first endorsement deal with Adidas in 1986, to the 2013 launch of Virgil Abloh’s Off-White fashion label, and an influx of rappers signing deals with luxury brands in the last decade, there is no doubt that hip-hop is a lucrative genre.\n\nMore than just fodder for lyrical content, b usiness moves in hip-hop are an ode to creating generational wealth in a country that hasn’t historically afforded much of it to the Black community .\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of hip-hop . Let’s have a look at some of the genre’s most notable business endeavors.\n\nAfter Sean “Puffy” Combs was let go from his internship at Uptown Records, he approached Clive Davis, the founder of Arista Records, with a business proposal that would result in one the largest hip-hop labels in the world. With the backing of Davis, Bad Boy Records was launched in 1993. The label quickly signed Craig Mack and The Notorious B.I.G. and released a hit single—cementing its place as a rival against Death Row Records. After Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear” peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 top 10, Biggie’s debut album Ready to Die went multi-platinum. Since then, Bad Boy Entertainment has gone on to operate as an imprint of Epic Records, under Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nIn 2007, Kanye West began working with Nike on his first pair of Yeezys. The partnership led to a second release in 2014, and was the first time that Nike ventured outside the realm of sports and into the music industry. What appeared to be a monumental collaboration came to an end for various reasons, including the brand’s refusal to pay West royalties and let him release a larger unit. Another brand, however, was keen to offer the rapper full ownership and creative control. Adidas signed West and began handling fulfillment and production for his Yeezy brand. By 2019, Adidas sales of Yeezy exceeded $1 billion annually. But i n October 2022, after a series of antisemitic comments by the artist, Adidas ended the partnership.\n\nIn 2013, fashion designer Virgil Abloh launched his Off-White fashion label, merging streetwear, luxury, art, and music. Through his relationships with rappers, Abloh’s haute brand instantly transformed modern hip-hop fashion and redefined luxury wear in the genre. In its early days, the brand was frequently spotted on Kanye West, Jay-Z, Drake, Travis Scott, and Future. By the late 2010s, Off-White had made a name for itself in the rap game as a prestige label: 21 Savage, Offset, and Playboi Carti all modeled pieces for the brand, and Gunna and Lil Uzi Vert name-dropped it in songs.\n\nWhen Apple acquired Beats by Dr. Dre in 2014, not only did the $3 billion deal elevate the already popular leader in the premium headphone market, it became the brand of choice in the music, entertainment, and sports worlds.“The addition of Beats will make our music lineup even better, from free streaming with iTunes Radio to a world-class subscription service in Beats, and of course buying music from the iTunes Store as customers have loved to do for years,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a press release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Dre, of course, is famous for being a trailblazer in elevating the hip-hop scene—from starting his rap career as part of N.W.A., launching Death Row Records, producing for Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur , and signing Eminem."
