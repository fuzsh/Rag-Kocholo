So in early 2020 they partnered with Cue to plan, produce, and promote professional-quality content. During lockdown, we worked directly with four Roc Nation artists to deliver a series of music-focused podcasts.\n\nThe Brief\n\nGive artists on the Roc Nation talent roster access to professional podcast production services and studio-quality equipment for recording remotely at home.\n\nProduce music-focused podcasts that resonate with existing audiences, enabling fans to stay connected with their favourite artists while gigs and tours were cancelled.\n\nDrive higher levels of engagement on artistâs social channels by posting eye-catching marketing material for each podcast episode.\n\nCreate and implement a launch plan for each podcast designed to maximise reach and impact on release.\n\nThe Podcasts\n\nThe First Ever Podcast\n\nThe Sound of Change\n\nGood for a Girl\n\nBeenDopeSpeaks\n\nâMaximising Reach Post-Launch\n\nCue worked alongside management and PR teams to plan a launch strategy for each podcast. Coordinated coverage in relevant industry publications promoted the shows to the right audiences upon release.\n\nTo make the most of this early attention, multiple episodes of each podcast went live on launch day. This allowed fans to binge-listen, and the subsequent spike in first-week download figures helped boost the position of each podcast in the Apple charts.\n\n250k+\n\nListens\n\n100k+\n\nYoutube Views\n\n500k+\n\nSocial Media Impressions\n\n400+\n\n5 star reviews\n\n3\n\nTop 10 in Apple Podcasts"
