        "text": "The Ryder Cup today announces a historic consultancy partnership with Roc Nation Sports International (RNSI).\n\nOriginally founded by Jay-Z in 2008, Roc Nation has grown into the world’s preeminent entertainment company and has its finger on the pulse of popular culture, representing some of the biggest stars in the worlds of music and sport.\n\nThe partnership will see RNSI use its extensive influence to showcase the drama and tension of golf’s greatest team context to new audiences, generating hype ahead of the 44th edition of the Ryder Cup in Rome this September.\n\nGrammy winning DJ Khaled, who can’t get enough of the sport, will be one talent who is front and center of the collaboration. He will be working alongside the Ryder Cup to help tap into his audience and create a crossover moment, rooted in authenticity and his passion for golf.\n\n“Let’s go golfing! I’m super excited to be partnering with the Ryder Cup. I’ve been getting into my golf a lot more recently; it’s become a passion of mine. We’re about to take it up a gear. Believe that!” says DJ Khaled.\n\nThis will include creative content creation through RNSI productions and strategic PR amplification, utilising its best-in-class in-house resources as a 360 agency. This will also involve working with the incredible talent on the wider Roc Nation roster, which includes golf enthusiasts from all walks of life, to create and engage in Ryder Cup themed content for their followers.\n\n“Today is a great day as we announce our partnership with the iconic Ryder Cup,” says Michael Yormark, President of Roc Nation Sports International. “We will make the most of our industry expertise to advise on best practices, utilise our network to its fullest and help take the 2023 Ryder Cup to the next level as one of the biggest sporting events on the calendar.”\n\nGuy Kinnings, Ryder Cup Director, added: “Golf has undergone a popularity boom in recent years, with more diverse and younger fans following and playing the sport. The Ryder Cup has always been the moment when golf enters mainstream culture and with Roc Nation by our side, we can further tap into this boom by creating cross-over content that entices new, younger fans to watch and follow the event.”\n\nThe countdown to the 2023 Ryder Cup begins now and it promises to be the most exciting iteration to date as all roads lead to Rome."
