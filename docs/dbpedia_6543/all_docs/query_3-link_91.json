        "text": "The music industry is dominated by powerful women, whether that be the record-breaking albums coming from acts like Taylor Swift or glass-ceiling-shattering boardroom executives. Of course, the music industry was not always so welcoming to women recording artists. In the early 20th century, many women were barred from performing in certain venues. Others faced discrimination on the road, radio, and from record label executives and fellow male artists.\n\nAmerican music would not be as fruitful today without the pioneering work of women like Ella Fitzgerald and Aretha Franklin. Nina Simone and Marian Anderson used their voices not only to tantalize listeners but to push for more equality during times when segregation was rampant throughout the country. These empowering voices from the past have resonated across generations to open the doors for today’s top acts, many of whom in turn are pushing new boundaries for future generations of women in the music industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo celebrate these pioneers, Stacker used data from primary news sources to compile a list of 50 women who broke barriers in the music industry. Many of these names are well-known; but are you familiar with one of the first Indian singers who won over crowds in North America? What about the rock star who opened up doors for hip-hop icons? Or the pop star who became an owner of a professional football team?\n\nAll that information and more is in this comprehensive review of some of entertainment’s most powerful figures. This list is not just exclusive for singers, though; we will clue you in on some of the emerging executives who are making waves in music and beyond. Continue reading to find out more about who’s responsible for bringing the hits to your Spotify playlists and iTunes libraries.\n\nPaul Natkin // Getty Images\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nElla Fitzgerald was known as “The First Lady of Song” for good reason. She won 13 Grammys, recorded more than 200 albums, and was a regular on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and “The Tonight Show.” She also fought relentlessly against discrimination as a Black female artist during the Jim Crow era. Fitzgerald was the first Black woman to win a Grammy award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonaldson Collection // Getty Images\n\nBillie Holiday\n\nBillie Holiday became one of the first Black women to work with a white orchestra when she toured with Artie Shaw in the late 1930s. One of the most famous jazz vocalists in history, Holiday’s song “Strange Fruit,” an anti-lynching poem written by Abel Meeropol, eventually earned recognition by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nLondon Express // Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarian Anderson\n\nWhile she was unable to sing in some of the country’s most revered halls, Marian Anderson still wowed crowds—and even Eleanor Roosevelt—with her powerful voice. Anderson eventually became the first Black performer to sing at the Metropolitan Opera. Anderson also became a regular performer at the White House, singing patriotic songs with gusto despite her own country’s discrimination against her.\n\nJack Vartoogian // Getty Images\n\nLakshmi Shankar\n\nLakshmi Shankar was a popular Indian musician who was celebrated by fans in the West. She paved the way for artists like Krishna Bhatt and was a standout on the soundtrack for the film “Gandhi.” The sister-in-law of sitar player Ravi Shankar, she also became friends with and collaborated with George Harrison.\n\nTom Copi // Getty Images\n\nNina Simone\n\nNina Simone was known as the “High Priestess of Soul” for her melodic, poignant, and emotional music. Dedicated to her beliefs of justice and empowerment, Simone left the United States in the 1970s and sharply criticized the country from afar because of its racial injustices.\n\nMichael Ochs Archives // Getty Images\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nAretha Franklin won a record eight consecutive Grammys for best R&B vocal performance from 1967 to 1974. The “Queen of Soul” was the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and sang at historic events in U.S. history like the memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. and the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama. Franklin also topped Rolling Stone’s list of 100 greatest singers of all time.\n\nRon Pownall // Getty Images\n\nJoan Baez\n\nJoan Baez closed the first day of Woodstock in 1969 and almost instantly achieved a new level of fame with her standout performance. A decade earlier, at only 18, she had performed at the Newport Folk Festival. Throughout her career, Baez has been a champion for civil rights and humanitarian causes, and in 2015, Amnesty International awarded her its top honor—the Ambassador of Conscience Award—for her continuing leadership and efforts in this arena.\n\nPaul Natkin // Getty Images\n\nDiana Ross\n\nAs the lead singer of The Supremes, Diana Ross shattered music records from 1965 to 1969. The Supremes are revered as one of the top girl groups of all time, with a dozen #1 hits. By 1970, Ross left the group to pursue a solo career. Her first two singles hit #1, and she went on to star in a number of films, including “Lady Sings the Blues,” which garnered her an Oscar nomination; “Mahogany”; and “The Wiz.” Ross was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most successful female artist of all time, and the book produced a special commemorative Diana Ross edition in 1993.\n\nPaul Natkin // Getty Images\n\nTina Turner\n\nTina Turner was the second artist on the cover of Rolling Stone, and the first female and Black artist to be on the cover of the famed magazine. She started her career in the late 1950s, and for nearly 20 years, she performed with her ex-husband Ike. After leaving him and pursuing a career on her own, it was the 1984 release of “Private Dancer” that put her back on track. Turner has been christened the “Queen of Rock” and was a major inspiration to artists like Beyoncé.\n\nIan Dickson // Getty Images\n\nCarole King\n\nIn the 1960s, Carole King wrote many hits for some of music’s top acts, setting a precedent for female songwriters. Five decades later, she won the Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song—the first woman to win the award. King’s standout career was later recapped in a smash Broadway play, “Beautiful.” Jack Robinson // Getty Images\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nIn 2017, NPR set out to name the top 150 albums made by women. At #1 on that list? Joni Mitchell’s 1971 classic, “Blue.” Called simple and radical, “Blue” was a rousing call for equality. Mitchell’s influence on the music world—for male and female musicians alike—runs deep.\n\nBettmann // Getty Images\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nJanis Joplin only lived to be 27 but made a mark on the music world like few other artists. Florence Welch, Pink, and Stevie Nicks are just some of the notable artists who’ve cited Joplin’s electric stage presence and emotional lyrics as inspirations. At her height, Joplin was called the first queen of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nGijsbert Hanekroot // Getty Images\n\nPatti Smith\n\nPatti Smith became one of New York City punk rock’s founding figures with her debut album “Horses.” Throughout her career, Smith remained one of the foremost activist voices in music, and always seemed up for pushing against the grain. In 2017, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir, “Just Kids.”\n\nJoe McNally // Getty Images\n\nCher\n\nCher has seemingly done it all—in music, movies, and on TV—and has never been constrained to one label through an illustrious career. She’s been called the “Goddess of Pop” with her ability to churn out dance and radio-friendly hits since the 1960s. Cher endeared herself to a new generation with her ability to connect through social media.\n\nGems // Getty Images\n\nDolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton is country music royalty, recognized as having the most hits on Billboard’s Hot Country songs chart. Throughout her career, Parton appealed to fan bases many country artists have trouble reaching; she also built one of music’s first empires, evidenced by the Dollywood theme park.\n\nMark Weiss // Getty Images\n\nMartha Quinn and Nina Blackwood\n\nMartha Quinn and Nina Blackwood were two of MTV’s original VJs and helped revolutionize the industry by making music videos a new preferred choice of music consumption for much of the 1980s and 1990s. Their style and smarts helped make VJs stars in their own right, and Quinn and Blackwood helped set the standard for music TV personalities for decades to come.\n\nGie Knaeps // Getty Images\n\nDebbie Harry\n\nDebbie Harry was not only the lead singer of Blondie, a powerful force backed by male band members, but a bit of a hip-hop pioneer. On “Saturday Night Live,” she brought on Sha-Rock to perform, who is considered one of the first female emcees. Through much of the 1980s, Harry was one of music’s style icons.\n\nBettmann // Getty Images\n\nMadonna\n\nInfluenced by Debbie Harry, Madonna became the definitive pop icon of the 1980s. Thanks in large part to her regular airplay on MTV, Madonna became one of the biggest acts in the world, before becoming a star on the silver screen. Madonna has openly talked about religion, sex, feminism, and age, and remains one of the most popular artists in the world.\n\nDavid Corio // Getty Images\n\nWhitney Houston\n\nWith one of the most memorable voices in music history, Whitney Houston crafted pop hits, chart-topping ballads, and rousing renditions of the national anthem. Houston was the first recipient of BET’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Even after the death in 2012, Houston remains one of the most cited influences in modern pop and R&B.\n\nAl Pereira // Getty Images\n\nSalt-N-Pepa\n\nSalt-N-Pepa were hip-hop pioneers, and the first female rap group to win a Grammy.
