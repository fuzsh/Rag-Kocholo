Laurence Marks – one half of the most successful comedy writing duos the UK has ever produced – invited members to the recording of his sitcom ‘Birds of a Feather’ at Pinewood Studios after visiting the group last summer (August 2015).

Marks, with his co-writer and childhood friend Maurice Gran, has been responsible for some of the most popular TV sitcoms in the last 35 years, including ‘Shine on Harvey Moon,’ ‘The New Statesman’ and ‘Goodnight Sweetheart’.

He spoke of his long career, including his time as a reporter for the Tottenham Weekly Herald, and the chance meeting with writer and presenter Barry Took which led to the two friends working for comedy legend Frankie Howerd.

He also gave some invaluable insights into breaking into the business. The duo’s theatre work includes ‘Dreamboats and Petticoats’ and ‘Save The Last Dance For Me.’
