The Goodnight Sweetheart T-Shirt is inspired by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran's 1990's sitcom starring Nicholas Lyndhurst as time travelling romantic Gary Sparrow.

Goodnight Sweetheart ran for six series between 1993 and 1999 and tells the story of an accidental time traveller who leads a double life after discovering a time portal allowing him to travel between the London of the 1990s and the same area during the Second World War.

An updated special was broadcast in 2016 revisiting the characters from the original series.

Most of our t-shirts are printed onto the Gildan range of clothing. The Gildan tees are 100% preshrunk cotton. We find these tees are particularly suited to DTG printing and are available in a wide variety of sizes and colours. Occasionally, when stock dictates, we will use a similar brand of equivalent quality.

All of our t-shirts are manufactured using the latest Direct To Garment printing (DTG) printing methods. Unlike traditional screen printing DTG does not require detailed layer seperation, screen preparation etc which makes it the ideal print solution for detailed, multi-coloured designs. As the name suggests, all our t-shirts have their designs printed directly onto the garment using specially formulated garment inks.

For best results we recommend washing all our t-shirts inside out with similar colours and on a cool 30 degree wash. To avoid any excessive shrinkage avoid the tumble dryer and let Mother Nature do her work by line drying your tee.
