        "text": "Laurence and Maurice met at a youth club in Finsbury Park, north London in the early 1960s. Just as it seemed as if they might have to get proper jobs, they hit upon comedy writing as a way of avoiding decades of tie-wearing 9 to 5 careerism. Oddly, they now own several ties.\n\nThey did have proper jobs for a time though; but while working as a journalist (Laurence) and a civil servant (Maurice) they wrote several speculative comedy scripts, which they sent off to various broadcasters, who each sent them back, though usually with encouraging noises.\n\nThen in 1978, just when it seemed that respectability was inevitable, Laurence overslept for the first and only time in his life. Thus, he missed his flight from London to Manchester, where he was researching an edition of ITV’s flagship current affairs programme This Week. Instead of sacking him, Thames Television booked Laurence onto the Euston-Manchester train where he found himself sitting opposite legendary comedy writer and producer, Barry Took.\n\nLaurence eventually summoned up the courage to talk to Barry and tell him of his and Maurice’s comedy writing aspirations. Barry generously offered to take a look at the lads’ unsold efforts; he was sufficiently impressed to introduce them to the producer of the Frankie Howerd Variety Show. This is what is generally termed a baptism of fire. Before they knew it, Laurence and Maurice were writing the bulk of a six-hour radio series, while trying to hold down their day jobs.\n\nHowever, after a brief period of psychological counselling they put Frank behind them and broke into television. Success came rapidly; their first television comedy series, Holding the Fort (1980-1983), was a top-five hit for London Weekend Television. They followed this up with the wildly popular Shine On Harvey Moon (1982-1985) the first television “comedy drama”.\n\nIn 1983 the duo created Relative Strangers, a spin-off of Holding the Fort. To this day Relative Strangers remains Channel 4’s most viewed situation comedy, Always interested in music, Laurence and Maurice’s next big TV hit was Roll Over Beethoven (1984-1985), a romance between a rock legend and a village piano teacher, which featured an original song in each episode.\n\nThen Hollywood called, and Laurence and Maurice left the UK to become studio writers at Paramount Studios. When they eventually returned to the UK – rich and famous – they got together with the legendary Rik Mayall to create The New Statesman (1987-1992), a blistering satire that had no effect whatsoever on the popularity of the Thatcher government, but which nonetheless won both the BAFTA for Best Comedy and an International Emmy.\n\nEager to have more control over their work, in 1989 Lo and Mo, as they were becoming known, founded ALOMO Productions in partnership with über producer Allan McKeown (the ‘AL’ in ALOMO). For most of the subsequent decade ALOMO was one the country’s leading independent television producers, with Laurence and Maurice creating a plethora of hits, including comedies Birds of a Feather, Get Back, Goodnight Sweetheart, and Unfinished Business; comedy drama Love Hurts; Mosley, a four-part historical film mini-series about Britain’s would be Führer, and Wall of Silence, crime movie.\n\nIn 1993 Laurence and Maurice were awarded UK television’s top writer’s award when they jointly won The British Academy Writer’s Award. Arguably, they surpassed even this in 1997 when they achieved the twin peaks of their televisual acclaim; they were the subject of an edition of the South Bank Show and were asked to deliver the prestigious McTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. In a controversial address, they predicted a world of digital, pay-to-view television in which conventional broadcasters, especially the BBC, would struggle to compete. Unfortunately, they were correct.\n\nDespite their heavy TV schedule, Laurence and Maurice were always devotees of the theatre, and a chance meeting between Laurence and Sir Alan Ayckborne (Laurence’s talent for chance meetings is legendary) led them to writing their first stage play, Playing God, which premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, in 2005. A year later they adapted The New Statesman for the stage. With Rik Mayall in the lead, reprising his notorious character Alan B’Stard M.P., the production toured the country to great acclaim, climaxing in a riotous residency in London’s West End. Further plays followed: Birds of a Feather, Von Ribbentrop’s Watch, and Love Me Do.\n\nIn 2008 Laurence and Maurice got the chance to fulfil another ambition to work in musical theatre when they were invited to write the “book” for a major new musical. Dreamboats and Petticoats, inspired by the best-selling hit compilation album of the same name. It had a West End residency, toured repeatedly for nine years, and was nominated for an Olivier Award. There followed three more musicals; Dreamboats and Miniskirts (the sequel), Bringing On Back The Good Times (Dreamboats and Petticoats 3) and Save The Last Dance For Me, a musical built around the legendary songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman.\n\nTheir latest stage offering is Cluedo 2, the show you have come to see tonight. They hope you enjoy it and are able to work out whodunnit.\n\nMark is best known for directing The Play That Goes Wrong (2015 Olivier Award Winner for Best New Comedy, 2015 Broadway World UK Award Winner for Best New Play & 2014 WhatsOnStage Award Winner for Best New Comedy).
