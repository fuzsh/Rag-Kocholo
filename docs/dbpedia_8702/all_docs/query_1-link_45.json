        "text": "Summary of Lawrence Weiner\n\nLawrence Weiner was one of the pioneers of text-as-art during the era of Conceptualism. His use of language is notable for its lyricism, its inquisitive engagement with the material world around it, and its distinctive, often colorful and playful visual forms. A fiercely egalitarian and anti-authoritarian spirit, hailing from a working-class background, Weiner saw his artworks as invitations for viewers to reconsider their relationships with the world around them, including with other people and systems of power. Based between Amsterdam and his home city of New York for most of his career, Weiner remained an engaging and humane force within modern art for half a century, creatively active throughout.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nLawrence Weiner's work contributed to the so-called \"dematerialization of the art object\" defined by critic Lucy Lippard in 1973. This involved the replacement of visual and three-dimensional forms with linguistic ideas as the primary substance of art. This gesture, which defined Weiner's practice from 1968 onwards, was hugely influential on modern art across the late 20th century, from Post-Conceptualism and Post-Minimalism to book art, Performance art, and more.\n\nWeiner's use of language was notable for its lyricism, brevity, and visual beauty, in contrast with other Conceptual artists who often worked with more emotionally detached, sometimes long and repetitive textual forms. Weiner even designed his own typeface, Margaret Seaworthy Gothic, to convey the particular, poetic spirit of his work. As such, he endowed language with many of the qualities of aesthetic beauty and emotional depth that might previously have defined a more traditional artwork. Indeed, he saw himself as a sculptor working with words.\n\nWeiner wanted his art to communicate with his audiences in an open-ended and thought-provoking manner, without the baggage of 'high art.' He often chose to locate his works in public spaces, including on exterior walls and floors, rather than in galleries, and the language of his work often explored the material objects and processes around it, asking questions or making connections. In this way, his practice can often be seen as site-specific, though the artist himself always contested that description.\n\nThe Life of Lawrence Weiner\n\nImportant Art by Lawrence Weiner\n\nBiography of Lawrence Weiner\n\nChildhood\n\nLawrence Weiner was born in the South Bronx, New York in 1942. His father, Harold, was a veteran (though he never spoke of his wartime experiences) and grocery store worker. Later, he ran a candy store at 149th Street and Southern Boulevard with his wife, Toba. Weiner later said that his parents \"were very nice to me, but they were not successful. They were not unsuccessful [...] There was food on the table all the time, but you had to work for it.\" He often helped his parents out at the candy store starting from the age of nine. He had no siblings.\n\nWeiner's parents were Jewish but did not make this a significant aspect of their son's upbringing. Even though both parents were youngest children of large families, he never knew any of his aunts, uncles, or cousins. Instead of spending time with family, he recalls spending time out on the streets as a \"slum kid\" amidst a culturally diverse urban population. He enjoyed going to Harlem to eat and listen to jazz, and also learned how to hotwire cars. As a teen he worked at various jobs, including on an oil tanker, on docks, and unloading railroad cars.\n\nWeiner was arrested several times in his youth, mainly for participating in anti-nuclear protests, and his parents considered enrolling him in either the Coast Guard Academy or reform school. He attended Stuyvesant, an all-boys high school, though he cut class frequently and later attributed his early education more to the public library than to the school system. He received no formal art education as a child and his parents had little interest in, or time for, cultural activities. He cites his first encounters with art as occurring during visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in the 1950s.\n\nReflecting on growing up in the Bronx, Weiner stated: \"I didn't have the advantage of a middle-class perspective. Art was something else; art was the notations on the wall, or the messages left by other people. I grew up in a city where I had to read the walls; I still read the walls. I love to put work of mine out on the walls and let people read it. Some will remember it and then somebody else comes along and puts something else over it. It becomes archaeology rather than history.\" When, at the age of sixteen, he told his mother that he planned to become an artist because he wanted to use art to dialogue with his fellow citizens, her memorable response was, \"Lawrence, you'll break your heart. Art is for rich people [...] and it's never going to change.\"\n\nEducation and Early Training\n\nWeiner graduated from high school at 15 and enrolled in courses on philosophy and literature at Hunter College. After less than a year he dropped out and traveled across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, making it as far as the Arctic, where he worked briefly on tuna and Albacore boats. During his travels he often slept under bridges or in doorways, working odd jobs to pay for short periods in rooming houses. Back in New York he began showing his Abstract Expressionist paintings (all of which are now destroyed) in coffee houses.\n\nWeiner saw Abstract Expressionism as \"a sign of freedom for working-class people\". In his opinion, \"the Abstract Expressionists believed that they really were going to change the world,\" and they \"accepted anybody's work that they thought was interesting. They really didn't care about the person. [...] People were just looking at the work. I was attracted to the lack of exclusivity.\" While beginning his career in New York, Weiner often visited painter Robert Ryman at his studio on the Bowery.\n\nIn the 1960s Weiner also spent several stints (a few months at a time) in California. As he recalls, \"I found myself in San Francisco around the City Lights bookshop and the Discovery bookshop and I was working around people like John Altoon, Bruce Conner, and others. [...] I had gotten to California by hitchhiking my way across the country, building structures, and constructing things everywhere I went, leaving them on the sides of the road. The Johnnie Appleseed idea of art was perfect for me.\"\n\nWeiner's debut public artwork was an undocumented action piece called Cratering Piece (1960) which involved setting off explosives simultaneously at the four corners of a field in a national park in Marin County, California. He continued to create crater-like works with explosives in California over the next six years. Other early works consisted of experiments with systematic approaches to shaped canvases and works using squares cut out of carpeting or walls. In 1963 he took his first trip to Europe; the same year, he met curator Seth Siegelaub, who by chance had attended the same high school as Weiner. A year later, Weiner began exhibiting at the Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art Gallery in New York City.\n\nOne day in 1967 sculptor John Chamberlain invited Weiner on a night out which ended up at Max's Kansas City, a nightclub in Manhattan - because, as Weiner recalled, they were too broke to go anywhere else. It was there that Weiner met his future wife, a waitress named Alice. Soon after, they and their daughter Kirsten went to Amsterdam where Weiner was offered an apartment by Siegelaub. Once in Amsterdam, he and Alice bought a houseboat from some sailors. The family lived on the vessel for several years without heat, electricity, or running water.\n\nMature Period\n\nIn 1968 Weiner reached a turning point in his career after creating a work titled Hay, Mesh, String for an outdoor exhibition organized by Siegelaub at Windham College in Putney, Vermont. For the exhibition, Weiner placed a series of stakes in the ground at regular intervals, with twine strung between them to create a grid. But it was the events following the show that provided a moment of epiphany. Students at the college soon cut the twine as it blocked their path across the campus lawn, leading Weiner to the conclusion that he could have created a less obtrusive and equally engaging work by simply reading a verbal description of his sculpture. Of course, the three-dimensional presence of the work had an intrinsic value too, but in making this conceptual leap Weiner was reflecting a general mood then building amongst his peers that the concept behind an artwork was more significant than its physical expression.\n\nWith this new idea in mind, later in 1968 (the year that fellow Minimalist artist Sol LeWitt wrote his \"Paragraphs on Conceptual Art\") Weiner penned a \"Declaration of Intent\" in which he outlined what would become guiding principles for the rest of his career: \"1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.\"\n\nWeiner embarked on this new trajectory at the end of 1968, contributing a 64-page booklet entitled Statements, which described a series of imagined but unrealized projects, to an \"exhibition\" organized by Siegelaub, who was at that time moving away from gallery-based curation and towards publishing and the circulation of objects as a way of showing art that reflected the new, concept-led mood of the times. Weiner also contributed a series of text-based works to Siegelaub's Xeroxbook, a compendium of photocopies by seven conceptual artists. From then on, the majority of Weiner's work took the form of text-based wall installations.\n\nWeiner therefore made a crucial contribution to defining Conceptualism as a mode by which art could challenge and subvert the traditional object status of the work. His work from the late 1960s onwards is an example of the \"dematerialization of the art object\" - to use the language of art critic Lucy Lippard - whereby visual and physical form is replaced with pure language. However, Weiner came to see language itself as a sculptural material. Importantly, he also saw the use of language in art as less baggage-laden than traditional media, a means of reclaiming art for, and making it accessible to, an imagined mass audience.\n\nDuring the same period Weiner also experimented with video and film, sound art, sculpture, performance art, installation art, and graphics. Often, his films include vocal recitations of statements similar to those found in his text-based sculptures. As such, they can be seen as placing his conceptual art in a different, time-bound medium, and as an important contribution to his own body of work and to early video-art.\n\nLate Period\n\nWeiner and his wife Alice spent the last several decades of the artist's life splitting their time between New York City and Amsterdam, although Weiner's struggles with cancer later made it more difficult for him to access their houseboat in the Netherlands. In New York they lived on Bleecker Street for over 30 years before moving to the West Village, into a residence in a converted bakery dating to 1910. Weiner's studio occupied the basement of the building, with his archives on the second floor.\n\nWeiner continued to work until just before his death, travelling around the world for various projects. He gave occasional lectures over the last decades of his life but generally avoided teaching positions, as his lifelong disdain for authority meant that he disliked assuming positions of power.\n\nThe Legacy of Lawrence Weiner\n\nWeiner helped to define the parameters of Conceptualism, which would go on to become arguably the most influential art movement of the half century; from 1970 onward. He made crucial contributions, alongside artists such as Douglas Huebler, Robert Barry, Joseph Kosuth, and Sol LeWitt, to the idea of Post-minimalism. This terms describes a broad range of work, much of it combining some of the clinical and affectless qualities of Minimalism with more human warmth, spontaneity, and symbolism.\n\nAlthough his work is rarely directly engaged with political or social themes, Weiner also maintained a subversive outlook on the world around him which was emblematic of the post-sixties worldview. Curator Dakin Hart asserts that \"Lawrence Weiner has always been political[...His] interest is in the matrix of relationships that connect us with the other raw materials that constitute the world.\" Likewise, writer and artist Marjorie Welish states that Weiner's \"words and work act as cultural irritants wherever they appear. Ranging from mildly to aggressively interventionist, Weiner's verbal art uses formalism to drive a wedge into the cultural status quo.\"\n\nAlthough he has been categorized as a Conceptual artist, Weiner dislikes the designation, which he sees as another form of elitism, and instead considers himself to be a sculptor. He says \"I think the Conceptual art thing is ridiculous [...L]et's stop giving things classifications so that they can be taught in expensive schools.\" For Weiner, language has a material reality and is \"a means of presenting a mise-en-scÃ¨ne, a physical reality\". In this way, his use of language differs from that of Barbara Kruger or Jenny Holzer, who tend to use language more as a call-to-arms, or as a means of calling out power structures within society, rather than an object in-and-of-itself.\n\nMoreover, as art critic Robert Enright explains, Weiner's handling of language differs from that of artists such as Roni Horn and Ed Ruscha, in this it is \"steadfastly uninflected, willfully incomplete and tantalizing, maybe even perverse\". Enright adds that \"[t]he viewer's tendency with Weiner's work is to turn the statement or phrase into a question. [...] The transition from making to apprehending [...] traces a shift from the declarative to the interrogative. That is precisely how Weiner wants his words to function; they may be descriptions or facts [...] but they are also catalysts for an interaction with the viewer/audience. In this understanding, the [work] changes from realist to magic realist. We enter into an engagement with the alchemy of words.\"\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Lawrence Weiner"
