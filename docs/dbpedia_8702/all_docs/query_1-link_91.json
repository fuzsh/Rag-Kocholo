        "text": "Following another weekend of deadly clashes between police and demonstrators, Bangladesh’s army chief announced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned.\n\nSabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, specializes in the study of political violence. She says what stands out about this historic day is the role of the military, which was divided on the use of repression.\n\nKarim says: “It is a historic day in Bangladesh as what started out as a student-led movement to change the civil service quota system transformed into a revolution that ousted the fifteen-year rule of Sheikh Hasina. This might very well be the first successful Gen Z led revolution.\n\n“What is notable about the movement is the role of the military, who according to reports were divided on the use of repression. Research shows that when security forces start to defect, revolutions are more likely to be successful. While there are many photos and videos circulating of soldiers using deadly force and shooting at unarmed protestors, some members of the military called for an independent U.N.-led investigation into these atrocities. In addition, some members of the military announced yesterday that they would not use deadly force on protestors who convened on the capital. So, it appears that the military were not always a unified force backing the Hasina regime.\n\n“What happens next? The military announced an interim government. While the country does have a history of coups, it doesn’t immediately appear to be the case that this is one. But a successful democratic transition all depends on diversity in composition of the interim government, ensuring that there is: rule of law, no revenge killing and destruction, a process to ensure a free and fair election, a plan to release political prisoners still being held captive, and a form of justice, accountability and reparations that will take place for those who were killed, injured and tortured by the regime and other parties involved in violence.\n\n“There is perhaps some optimism for a democratic transition even if the military is involved in the process. The Bangladeshi Armed Forces is one of the top troop-contributing countries to U.N. peacekeeping operations and has gained significant resources and international legitimacy through its participation in these missions. The military has a lot to lose if the U.N. places restrictions on further contributions to peacekeeping.”\n\nFor interviews contact Lindsey Knewstub: cell, 607-269-6911, lmh267@cornell.edu."
