        "text": "Tennessee Promise is both a scholarship and mentoring program focused on increasing the number of students who attend college in our state. It provides students a last-dollar scholarship, meaning the scholarship will cover the cost of tuition and mandatory fees not covered by the Pell grant, the HOPE scholarship, or the Tennessee Student Assistance Award. Students may use the scholarship at any of the state’s 13 community colleges, 24 colleges of applied technology, or other eligible institution offering an associate degree program.\n\nApplicants must complete the Tennessee Promise application by November 1, complete the FAFSA by March 15, attend a mandatory meeting, and complete eight hours of community service each semester to be eligible for the award.\n\nThe TN Promise Application opens on August 1 and closes on November 1 each year. The application is accessed through the TSAC Student Portal. To create a Student Portal account, you will be asked to provide the following:\n\nStudent’s First Name and Last Name (as it appears on the Social Security Card)\n\nStudent’s Social Security Number\n\nStudent’s Date of Birth\n\nStudent’s Personal Email Address (Not School Email)\n\nThe FAFSA is the primary college financial aid application students must complete in order to determine state and federal scholarship and/or grant qualification. All students should file the 2025-2026 FAFSA regardless of post-secondary plans!\n\nStudents and parents will utilize 2023 tax information to complete the 2025-2026 FAFSA. Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA as soon as possible as some state/federal financial aid grants are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThe deadline to submit the 2025-2026 FAFSA to remain eligible for TN Promise is March 15, 2025!\n\nTennessee Promise partners with two statewide organizations to coordinate requirements for the award.\n\nIf you live in Benton, Bledsoe, Campbell, Claiborne, Cocke, Decatur, Hardin, Haywood, Henderson, Houston, Lauderdale, Lawrence, Lewis, McNairy, Meigs, Perry, Scott, Unicoi, Union, Warren, or Wayne counties, your award will be coordinated by The Ayers Foundation Trust.\n\nAll other counties are served by tnAchieves.\n\nIt is imperative that all students be mindful of the email address and phone number(s) provided to the partnering organization. This information will be used to communicate important program eligibility details and upcoming deadlines directly to the student."
