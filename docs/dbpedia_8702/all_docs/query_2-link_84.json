        "text": "A BBC Radio 4 full-cast drama by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran. Originally broadcast in the ‘Saturday Play’ slot on 8 November 2008. Wine shop owner Gerald desperately needs money: his business is failing and the landlord has raised the cost of the lease. When he inherits a watch that used to belong to wartime Nazi Joachim Von Ribbentrop he believes that his financial troubles are over. But it sparks conflict with his wife and brother, who question the ethics of the potential sale. Gerald is played by Allan Corduner, Ruth by Harriet Walter, Lila by Miriam Margolyes, David by Nicholas Woodeson and Sasha by Sophie Winkleman. Produced by Sally Avens."
