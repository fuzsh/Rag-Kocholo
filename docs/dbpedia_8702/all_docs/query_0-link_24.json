        "text": "There aren’t many sitcoms about a grown man pretending to be a spy who wrote The Beatles’ back catalogue. Who also befriends Noel Coward, saves Clement Attlee’s life, and meets George VI, the Kray twins and Winston Churchill. Then again, time-travelling oddity Goodnight Sweetheart was no ordinary sitcom.\n\nEyebrows raised and brows furrowed this week at surprise news that the Nicholas Lyndhurst vehicle is returning to BBC One for a special standalone episode. Talk about a blast from the past.\n\nIt’s part of the BBC’s landmark sitcom season, celebrating 60 years of BBC mirth alongside revivals of Porridge, Steptoe & Son, Till Death Us Do Part, Up Pompeii!. Are You Being Served? and Keeping Up Appearances.\n\nYet those shows are iconic favourites that have been in regular rotation since they were originally broadcast. Surely Goodnight Sweetheart - the slightly shonky story of time travelling romeo Gary Sparrow, which occasionally gets repeated on ITV3 - doesn’t belong in such exalted comedy company?\n\nActually, to many viewers (including me), it does. Goodnight Sweetheart was much loved and has a doubly nostalgic appeal, cleverly appealing to two demographics which rarely overlap. First, it’s a cult retro treat for the generation who grew up during the 90s, when it first aired. And second, its lovingly recreated 1940s setting is evocative for those of a more mature vintage.\n\nIn the 1990s, he was married to ambitious Yvonne (played by Coronation Street and Rita, Sue & Bob Too alumnus Michelle Holmes). In war-torn London, he fell for no-nonsense East End barmaid Phoebe (Irish actress and the voice of those M&S food ads, Dervla Kirwan) - who he eventually married as well.\n\nYes, it plays infidelity and bigamy for laughs. As one Twitter user put it to me this week, when I tweeted excitedly about Goodnight’s Sweetheart’s shock comeback: “If you had the opportunity to travel back in time, would you kill Hitler or Lee Harvey Oswald? No, you'd make friends with a hapless policeman and become a philanderer.”\n\nOther cast members included Victor “Jack from Bread” McGuire as the hero’s best mate Ron (a printer, handily, so he could supply Gary with ration books and defunct currency) and Christopher Ettridge as dimwit local bobby PC Reg Deadman. The ensemble’s timezone-straddling antics made the show a ratings hit and by stealth, it went on to run for 58 episodes across six series.\n\nDervla Kirwan shot to fame off the back of the show and soon landed a role in hit Sunday night drama Ballykissangel. In fact, both female leads left the show after series three, to be replaced by not-quite-as-good actresses who vaguely resembled them (Elizabeth Carling and Emma Amos). This was the moment when even us loyal fans deemed the show had jumped the shark, going from cult treat to naff guilty pleasure.\n\nNow, 17 years after hanging up his felt fedora for the final time, Lyndhurst will reprise his role. Marks and Gran’s new script sees Sparrow “face the consequences of his time travel and go somewhere he’s never been before”. Quite possibly to prison for bigamy, fraud and identity theft.\n\nIt had dark depths - see the storyline where Sparrow fathered a child in the 40s, while his wife miscarried in the 90s. Or where he went back even further in time to Victorian era and was mistaken for Jack The Ripper. The anti-hero got entangled in his web of lies, wracked with guilt about deceiving both lovers. The series grew from traditional sitcom fare into something more bittersweet and melancholy.\n\nThe 1940s setting was convincingly conjured up - as it was in a previous Marks & Gran hit, Shine On Harvey Moon. All the episode titles are names of songs from the era, often with a wistful double meaning: I Get Along Without You Very Well, Don't Fence Me In, I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good, Love the One You're With.\n\nThis week, all manner of secret Goodnight Sweetheart fans have been coming out of the closet. Comedian Richard Herring wrote a column about being “obsessed”. It trended on Twitter. There’s been talk of a stage musical version. Marks and Gran say they’ve received thousands of letters and emails over the intervening years, begging for more episodes.\n\nNow those fans - including me, Richard Herring and half of Twitter - are getting their wish. This underrated gem is finally getting its dues. Let’s just draw a discreet veil over the Rolf Harris episode, shall we?"
