        "text": "Killjoy BBC chiefs turned down a new series of Nicholas Lyndhurst’s sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart.\n\nThe show’s writer Laurence Marks was up for penning a new batch of episodes to make viewers giggle and offered it to execs.\n\nBut he was snubbed and told the corporation wanted to focus on new ideas.\n\nLaurence told the Daily Star Sunday: “We could have done another series of Goodnight Sweetheart, but the BBC pulled back from that.\n\n“They got frightened that they were putting on too many old shows — shows that had already been seen. So instead they put on shows that nobody wanted to watch. And that’s their choice.”\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart, which starred Nicholas as Gary Sparrow, pulled in 13million viewers at its peak.\n\nThe Beeb also turned down a new series of Are You Being Served? despite it being a hit with viewers.\n\nInstead, exes used licence fee cash to commission flop sitcoms including Holding The Sunset, Warren and Semi-Detached.\n\nLaurence fears BBC comedy is too safe these days.\n\nHe said: “You can’t be vicious to people anymore. Everyone has to be nice. And everyone has to be spoon-fed by the hand to safe places.\n\n“You can’t talk about the things that you find funny because of what I believe is called cancel culture. So you avoid them. And if you avoid them, you lose your humour.”\n\nLaurence, who also penned smash hit Birds of a Feather, added: “My entire career was made on not going to safe places.\n\n“Now I wouldn’t avoid things that are supposed to be off-limits. I’d say, ‘Oh f*** it, cancel me’. Who gives a toss? It doesn’t matter. What matters is being funny.\n\n“But everything changes. Everything is cyclical. I’m sure it will change back.\n\n“A head of comedy will come into ITV or a controller will come into ITV and say let’s be dangerous.\n\n“They might not keep their job for very long but they would produce some bloody good programmes.”"
