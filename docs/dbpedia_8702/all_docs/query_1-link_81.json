Named for a model with whom he collaborated on several fashion editorials beginning in 2010, the exhibition explores the artistâ€™s diverse array of subjects, from still-life arrangements to fashion shoots and portraits. Ethridge will discuss how he juxtaposes staged scenes with chanced-upon vignettes in his pursuit of a formal sensibility that hinges on the bending and breaking of aesthetic rules."
