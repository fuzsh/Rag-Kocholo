        "text": "Writers give the little Hitler a Freudian trip\n\nLaurence Marks and Maurice Gran return to their roots and tell how their latest play picks the brains of a young Adolf, writes Peter Gruner\n\nFORTY years ago they were two rebellious teenagers trying to get a “beat group” together in a Finsbury Park church hall. They knew they wanted to be famous, they just didn’t know how. Today, Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran are among Britain’s foremost television scriptwriters.\n\nFamous for making us laugh with popular hit sitcoms like the BBC’s Birds of a Feather, Goodnight Sweetheart and New Statesman, they are soon to launch their latest television comedy, Mumbai Calling, to be broadcast on ITV later this year.\n\nIt is co-written with and stars Sanjeev Bhaskar from Meet the Kumars, and is set in a call centre in India.\n\nMarks and Gran also have a serious side, and there will be a special reading of their BBC radio play Dr Freud will See You Now, Mr Hitler, at The Tricycle Theatre on Sunday evening, May 13.\n\nThe play, first broadcast on Radio 4 on March 31, poses the intriguing question: would the course of history have been altered if Dr Freud – who ran a child psychiatric clinic in Vienna at the time – had been given the opportunity to treat young Adolf?\n\nMarks and Gran were inspired to write the play after discovering that as a child Hitler had been badly traumatised by being regularly beaten by his father.\n\nMaurice said: “As dramatists we were fascinated by the imaginary clash of two of the 20th century’s most influential minds.\n\n“Like all Jewish kids growing up in the 1950s, we were very conscious of the Holocaust. Of course, we may not have come into the world if Hitler had invaded Britain.\n\n“Most Jewish families either lost or knew people who lost loved ones in the death camps of Germany. One of the reasons for writing the Hitler play was to try and understand the mind of the man.\n\n“Even today, with all the terrible things being perpetrated in the world, few atrocities come close to the systematic murder of six million Jews.\n\n“What was particularly extraordinary was that Hitler’s racial ideas could be embraced by a supposedly civilised country.”\n\nStarring many of the original radio cast, Sunday’s event is a benefit evening for the Freud Museum in Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, the former home of the great psychoanalyst.\n\nThe evening will include a discussion of the issues surrounding the play.\n\nAs well as Laurence and Maurice, the panel will include Cambridge University professor of history of science, John Forrester, and his novelist wife Lisa Appignanesi, who together wrote Freud’s Women (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1992).\n\nMaurice said: “We’re slightly apprehensive that during the discussion we’ll get some distinguished Freudian telling us that he never used the word trousers but always said pantaloons.\n\n“We’ll be up against people who know everything about him.”\n\nMarks and Gran, who now both live in the Cotswolds, wanted to return to their Finsbury Park roots for this interview. We met outside St John’s Court in Princess Crescent, the council flats where Laurence grew up. Maurice lived just round the corner in Finsbury Park Road.\n\nLaurence said: “Standing here takes me back to my childhood and all its influences.\n\n“Mine was a traditional Jewish upbringing with parents who wanted me to do well in whatever I did.”\n\nLaurence’s father was a stocktaker while Maurice’s was manager of a fabric shop in Berwick Street, Soho. Tragically, Laurence lost his father in the Moorgate Tube disaster of 1975, the story on which he based an award-winning Channel 4 documentary – Me, My Dad and Moorgate.\n\nBoth boys passed their 11-plus and went to grammar schools – Laurence to Holloway County, and Maurice to William Ellis.\n\nMarks and Gran became friends at the Jewish Lads Brigade, which met weekly at the former Finsbury Park Junior School in Blackstock Road, now City and Islington College.\n\nLaurence said: “I didn’t want to go to the JLB but my father was chairman so I had to. I’d rather have stayed at home and listened to the radio.”\n\nThey were both devotees of Round the Horne and Hancock’s Half Hour.\n\nBoth were keen readers. Maurice remembers enjoying the Just William stories – the classic children’s books by Richmal Crompton.\n\n“I didn’t have TV until the late 50s,” he said. “So I went to the library and devoured books at the rate of four or five a week.”\n\nMaurice added that his mother, Debbie, always wanted to be a writer.\n\nHe said: “Both my mother and Laurence’s mother, Lily, were very aspirational.\n\nThey could have achieved a lot more but they also needed to earn a living.”\n\nLaurence and Maurice started writing together in their early 20s and went to the Players-Playwrights, a writers group that met at the British Drama League offices at Fitzroy Square. For five years they wrote, usually at night, while holding down full-time jobs.\n\nMaurice had become manager of the Tottenham Job Centre while Laurence worked nearby as a reporter on the now defunct Tottenham Weekly Herald.\n\nStill holding down their day jobs, they began to submit material to the BBC.\n\nHowever, a chance meeting with Barry Took (one of the creators of Round The Horne) led to them getting the chance to write a radio show for the legendary Frankie Howerd.\n\nFrom there they never looked back.\n\nComedy may have been Marks and Gran’s first love – but later they turned their hands to serious drama.\n\nThey wrote two major television pieces with strong Jewish elements: Wall of Silence in 1993 for the BBC, a murder mystery set in Stamford Hill’s Hasidic Jewish community, and Mosley (C4, 1998), the story of British fascist and anti-Semite Oswald Mosley.\n\nThe latter was condemned by some Jewish organisations for showing Mosley had a human side.\n\nBut as Maurice said to me: “It is because these political monsters are still human that we need to try and understand them.”"
