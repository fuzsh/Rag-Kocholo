The programme premiered on BBC1 on 18 November 1993, and originally ran for six series; which concluded on 28 June 1999. However, a one-off special episode aired on 2 September 2016, on BBC One.\n\nThe show was written and created by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, who wrote the complete first series of the show, after which they only wrote some episodes, along with a team of writers. The creators also wrote the final episode of the show, where Gary Sparrow finds he is trapped in 1945 with Phoebe. In an interview, the pair commented that Gary couldn't always have his cake and eat it.\n\nSeries overview[]\n\nSeries Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 6 18 November 1993 23 December 1993 2 10 20 February 1995 1 May 1995 Special 26 December 1995 3 10 1 January 1996 4 March 1996 4 11 3 March 1997 20 May 1997 5 10 23 February 1998 27 April 1998 6 10 18 April 1999 28 June 1999 Special 2 September 2016\n\n[]"
