        "text": "Paul Makin, who has died of a brain tumour aged 54, was a comedy writer of unique talent, whose two series of Nightingales, broadcast on Channel 4, remain the most absurd and surreal of any British situation comedy. Those who knew Makin found it difficult to comprehend how such humour could come from a man so shy and diffident.\n\nI first met Paul in 1982, when he sent a speculative script, Gold Top, to the agent for myself and Maurice Gran. She passed it on for us to read and assess its comedy potential. It was hilarious, containing more invention in its 50 pages than any I had ever read. We had clearly discovered a rare gem, told our agent that we would like to meet this man, and he was duly delivered to London.\n\nFrom that first meeting, Paul, Maurice and I worked together for nearly two decades. So excited were we by his style and comic gift that we introduced Paul to Witzend Productions, for whom we were engaged upon Shine on Harvey Moon, and they gave Paul his entree to television with two episodes of the ITV comedy The Other 'Arf (1982). He never looked back.\n\nPaul was born in Wolverhampton and educated at the local secondary modern. He left school at 15 to work in Alexander Metals, hoping one day to become a metallurgist but, after two years, found factory life not conducive to the world that was going on inside his head. Always having harboured a desire to act, in 1972 he was accepted at Coventry drama school and qualified as a fully fledged actor. His first steps treading the boards came through playing a monk at medieval banquets in Combe Abbey.\n\nRealising that the life of a thespian was not all it was cracked up to be, in 1976 he applied to and was accepted as a stagehand by the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry. It was during his time there that Paul assembled the sense of theatre technique that became so apparent in his later work. During his four years at the Belgrade, Paul decided that what he really wanted to be was a comedy writer. He left his day job and struggled for many years. He was financially supported by Liz Bayton, his partner for the rest of his life, and John Howard Davies, then head of comedy at BBC Television, who threw small parcels of money in Paul's direction. Howard Davies recognised a very special talent.\n\nIn 1984 Maurice and I offered Paul the chance to write episodes of our new series, Relative Strangers. We then fed him two episodes of Roll Over Beethoven (1985), but Paul's desire was to create comedy series of his own, and very soon he achieved his goal by giving Central TV A Kind of Living (1988) starring Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour. Throughout Paul's career, his scripts always attracted the cream of stage actors. This was hardly surprising. His words jumped off the page, inviting you into the bizarre world inhabited only by Paul Makin.\n\nPaul wrote three series of Kind of Living, before creating his tour de force, Nightingales (1990 and 1993). By this time, Maurice and I had started Alomo, our own independent TV company, and its very first, and probably finest, production was Nightingales, the story of three security guards who whiled away their nights in an office block, having absurd adventures. Once more Paul's scripts attracted supreme actors, and the only time I ever saw him laugh out loud was when watching Robert Lindsay (Carter) and David Threlfall (Bell) rehearsing Paul's beautifully crafted lines. The third of the trio was James Ellis (Sarge).\n\nNightingales was the closest British TV comedy ever came to giving its audience the theatre of Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, with perhaps an ample sprinkling of Spike Milligan thrown in - yet it was hugely original and remains as funny today as it was in the early 1990s.\n\nRiding high on the success of his acclaimed masterpiece, Paul then wrote two further original series for Alomo: Taking the Floor (1991), a comedy set in the world of ballroom dancing, and Grown Ups (1997). Maurice and I asked Paul if he would contribute to our new series Goodnight Sweetheart (1993-97), and he wrote seven episodes.\n\nFollowing a long period of illness, Paul once more started delving into his idiosyncratic and fertile imagination and, shortly before he died, he wrote a new series entitled Insects, described as \"film noir in the insect world\". Goodness knows what further delights this would have held for the world of British comedy.\n\nHe is survived by Liz and their daughters, Nancy and Ruby."
