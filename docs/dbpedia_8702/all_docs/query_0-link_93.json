        "text": "Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised his role as time traveller Gary Sparrow in Friday night's revival of the British sitcom.\n\nThe special BBC1 episode - written by original creators Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran - beat the opposition in the ratings with 3.7 million viewers (19.5% share) and a peak of four million.\n\nGardeners' World on BBC2 was watched by 2.4 million, Lady C And The Castle on ITV attracted 2.2 million and Eight Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown on Channel 4 got 1.6 million.\n\nYoung Hyacinth, a prequel to Keeping Up Appearances, which was broadcast straight after Goodnight Sweetheart, was watched by 3.4 million viewers, a peak of 3.5 million and a 17.8% share.\n\nNo decisions have yet been made about making a full series of the sitcom, commissioned as part of a season of one-off specials celebrating the heritage of BBC comedy.\n\nBoth shows received a warm response from fans following the return of Are You Being Served? which was panned by viewers, and Porridge.\n\nLyndhurst's former co-star in Only Fools and Horses, John Challis, was among the viewers who enjoyed Goodnight Sweetheart.\n\nChallis, who played Boycie in Only Fools and Horses, wrote on Twitter: \"Good to see Nick Lyndhurst doing what he does best.\"\n\nComic Jason Manford also heaped praise on the episode, saying: \"Just caught up with Goodnight Sweetheart on BBC1. Would be surprised if that's not a full series soon. Nice to see 'em back.\"\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart ran for six series on BBC One.\n\nLyndhurst last played Sparrow, a former TV repairman and accidental time traveller who leads an extraordinary double life, 17 years ago.\n\nOther fans also called for the return of the show.\n\nLady Wendy wrote on Twitter: \" What an absolutely fantastic performance!!! Please please bring this back ..... wonderful.\"\n\nCraig Walker wrote: \" Last night's new Goodnight Sweetheart was absolutely brilliant! @bbccomedy well done! Series please!\"\n\nViewers also praised the performance of Kerry Howard as a young Hyacinth in the prequel to Keeping Up Appearances.\n\nDerren Litten, who wrote the return of Are You Being Served?, said: \"Thought Kerry Howard was sensational in Young Hyacinth - the show beautifully shot, gorgeous soundtrack, should have been on an hour.\"\n\nGuy Lambert ‏wrote: \" With some work here and there, that could be a cracking Sunday night comedy series.\"\n\nRyan Love wrote: \"W ait is Kerry Howard actually Patricia Routledge from the past??? This is insane.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Keeping Up Appearances' star Patricia Routledge suggested that she was unimpressed with the idea of the corporation revisiting some of Britain's best-loved TV series.\n\n\"Why are they doing this sort of thing?\" the actress, 87, was quoted as saying. \"They must be desperate.\"\n\nHoward described her response as \"sad\", saying: \"I think she should be incredibly flattered that the BBC are paying homage to all these great shows.\""
