        "text": "Do you prefer debit or credit cards?\n\nI pay for most things with my debit card.\n\nAre you a saver or a spender?\n\nI was a spender when I was poor, but I’ve been a saver ever since I’ve had money. That said, every now and then I have a splurge and a year ago I bought a new Mercedes for nearly £60,000.\n\nDo you own a property?\n\nThe first property I owned was a terraced house in north London that I bought for £21,000 in 1979. Three years later, in 1982, I sold that for £30,000 and traded up to a semi-detached Edwardian house in Southgate, north London, costing £60,000. In 1993 I bought a fabulous country house with five bedrooms and an acre and a half-sized garden in the Cotswolds for about half a million. The following year Maurice and I bought a flat in Mayfair for £300,000 — a real bargain — so we had a London base. We more than doubled our money when we sold it in 2005. In 2006 I sold the country house for about three times what I paid for it because it was too big for me and my wife, and we needed in-house staff. We paid a seven-figure sum for a huge apartment — the size of a large house but on one floor — in a stately home in the Cotswolds. Then, in 2007, I bought a fabulous wooden house in the Swiss mountains that wasn’t cheap. It took four years to complete the purchase and I had to get the canton’s permission. But I sold it in 2020, tripling my money.\n\nAre you better off than your parents?\n\nYes, incomparably. I was one of three — my brother and sister, who are both alive and well, were born in the 1930s and I was born after the war, so I guess I was an accident. I was brought up in a ground-floor council flat in north London. My Eastender father, Bernie, a bookkeeper, was killed in the 1975 Moorgate Tube crash aged 68, and my Welsh mother, Lilly, who died aged 62, always struggled financially. Their idea of luxury was a fitted carpet, acquired on HP [hire purchase]. Sadly neither of them lived to see my success.\n\nHow much did you earn last year?\n\nThe royalties arrive in dribs and drabs, but I suspect it will be a six-figure sum. What I do know is that Maurice and I pay a vast amount of tax. Back in the 1990s, when we were the top comedy writers in the country, it would have been a high six-figure or even seven-figure sum.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nI joined a publishing company after school on £7 a week, but then became a reporter on The North London Weekly Herald before working on and off for The Sunday Times in the mid-Seventies. Back then you made more from your expenses than your salary, and when I joined the Herald I was told off for not putting down enough on my expenses. “Do you want to ruin it for everyone?” a colleague asked. My expenses really paid for the deposit on my first home.\n\nA chance meeting with Barry Took on a train to Manchester, when I showed him the spec scripts I’d been working on with Maurice, helped pave the way for us writing for Frankie Howerd’s television show in 1978. We’d been on the verge of giving up writing altogether at that point because our scripts were being rejected.\n\nWhen did you first feel wealthy?\n\nAbout 1980 when I was able to buy my first dream car, a Triumph Dolomite Sprint — I’ve always had a penchant for fast cars.\n\nHave you ever worried about making ends meet?\n\nYes, times were tough in the early 1970s. I’d sneak a packet of chocolate digestives into the trolley when I went shopping with my first wife, Sue, on a Saturday morning. And she’d take them out and ask: “Look, do you want vegetables or biscuits, because we can’t afford both.” I even struggled to get the rent money together on my parents’ council flat, which I got to keep after they died. My wife hated it there, because it was a family home with ghosts.\n\nWhat has been your most lucrative work?\n\nOur hit TV shows have all been lucrative, and at one point we had four running one after the other. But our most lucrative collaboration was the musical Dreamboats and Petticoats. It took six months to write and the royalties have been rolling in ever since it debuted in 2009, whereas you’re on a treadmill with TV series, churning out episode after episode.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected you?\n\nWell, Maurice and I couldn’t work together in person during the first lockdown, and I didn’t like working over Zoom, so that broke the rhythm that had existed for 40 years. But we wrote a new stage show together in 2021 and we’re currently writing a film.\n\nWhat’s best for retirement — property or pension?\n\nI’d say a pension because you can’t live off a property unless you own many and collect rent. I’ve always seen property as a place to live in.\n\nWhat has been your best business decision?\n\nQuitting my day job in 1980 to become a full-time screenwriter with Maurice, and taking on a financial adviser to plan my future, good or bad, before I had any money.\n\nWhat about your best investment?\n\nWine, largely bordeaux and burgundies. One of my best buys was a case of 1980 Château Latour, which cost £300-£400. It would have sold at auction for £60,000 last year.\n\nAnd your worst investment?\n\nMy biggest missed financial opportunity was not investing in the musical Cats, on the advice of our accountant. If I’d done so I could have probably lived off the royalties for the rest of my life!\n\nYour most extravagant purchase?\n\nI’ve spent a lot of money on cars and bought a Bentley for about £60,000 in 1996. The cost of maintaining it was murderous, though, and I was presented with an eye-watering bill every time it was serviced. They used to offer me a cup of coffee when I picked it up when what I really needed was a tranquilliser. I had to spend £827 on a new aerial alone!\n\nWhat would you do if you won the lottery?\n\nIt wouldn’t matter to me. But if I did I’d give the money to a cause I really believed in and endow a university or hospital. I’ve long given away money anyway. I think it’s the council flat mentality kicking in. I’ve got more than enough so I may as well give some away.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson you’ve learnt about money?\n\nThat need is more important than want."
