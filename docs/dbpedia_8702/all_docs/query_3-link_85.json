        "text": "January 2022\n\nA consistent writing style is essential to effective communications. This document provides guidelines for style, word use and other editorial issues particular to St. Lawrence University. These standards apply in all published materials that represent the University to an external audience, in both print and electronic media.\n\nThe guide primarily follows the latest edition of The Associated Press (AP) Stylebook and www.dictionary.com, with exceptions specific to St. Lawrence noted. Other exceptions may be desirable in rare instances, for example for clarity of meaning or specific to media outlet. In such cases, St. Lawrence’s office of University Communications is the final arbiter.\n\nPlease note that style for academic writing may differ from this guide. Much academic writing adheres to the Chicago Manual of Style, which, while similar to AP in many respects, also carries significant differences. Similarly, there are accepted variations for social media, differing with each platform.\n\nThis style guide is produced by St. Lawrence’s office of University Communications, and was last updated in August 2017. Comments, suggestions and questions may be directed to Kim Asch, kasch@stlawu.edu.\n\nEntry words below are noted in boldface and represent the preferred spellings and capitalizations. Those that appear in bold brackets are categories. Titles appear in italics. Further explanation is included when necessary to explain nuances, variations, exceptions or factual information idiosyncratic to St. Lawrence University.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nAppendix 1\n\nDownload Style Guide\n\nA\n\na/an: Follow standard usage, choosing an when its antecedent begins with a consonant mimicking a vowel sound: a historic occasion, an honorary degree.\n\n[Abbreviations]: Commonly used abbreviations of more than two letters do not require periods and should be in upper case: GPA, HEOP, NCAA, FAFSA, FERPA. Exception: Ph.D. Avoid “NYC” for New York City, except rarely in Class Notes, or in quoted material.\n\na cappella\n\n[academic departments]: see capitalization. acknowledgment, not acknowledgement.\n\nthe Adirondacks: refers to both the mountain range and the region. The Adirondack Park (not Adirondack State Park) is the largest park in the U.S., excluding Alaska.\n\nAdirondack Semester occurs in the fall semester at a rented site ~45 miles from campus at Massawepie Lake.\n\n[administrative offices]: see capitalization admissions (plural)\n\nadviser, not advisor.\n\naffect/effect: One has an effect on something, but is affected by something. Affect is not synonymous with “impact” when used as a verb: The blossoms were affected by the early spring.\n\nAfrican American studies: Do NOT hyphenate African American and other compound nationalities.\n\nafterward, not afterwards.\n\nAkwesasne is the geographical location of the nearby Mohawk Nation, the Native American community in the United States, or First Peoples community in Canada. The Akwesasne Mohawk Nation (formerly the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe) is the preferred name for the community. (Avoid using terms such as “tribe,” “Indian,” and “reservation” as they are no longer the preferred terms in the Akwesasne Mohawk community.)\n\nAll-America, All-American: Individual team members may be called All‐Americans. Use All- America in other applications. She is an All-American. He is an All-America selection.\n\nalma mater: Lowercased and not italicized except in reference to St. Lawrence’s alma mater (song), the title of which is “Alma Mater” (uppercase, in quotation marks, and note no “The.”) If you are a Laurentian, the name of your alma mater’s alma mater is “Alma Mater.”\n\nalumnus, alumni, alumna, alumnae: Use in reference to those who have completed at least two semesters at St. Lawrence. (The Latin root “alum” means “student,” not “graduate.”) Use alumnus (alumni in the plural) when referring to a man who has attended a school. Use alumna (alumnae) when referring to a woman who has attended a school. Use alumni when referring to a group of men and women or a group whose gender allocation cannot be determined. The shortcut “alum” is to be avoided except in very casual references or in quotes. NOTE: The gender specificity of the Latin terms are currently under debate and the use of “graduate” to identify any Laurentian is preferred in general or when gender identity is unknown.\n\nAlumni Association, Alumni Executive Council\n\na.m./p.m.: 9 a.m., 4 p.m. (note the space between the numeral and the abbreviation).\n\nand/& (ampersand): Avoid “&” except in trademarked business names: Procter & Gamble.

Also note that we have a rowing team, not a crew team, and it is a riding competition, not equestrian.\n\n(Return to top)\n\nB\n\nBachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science: note upper case; bachelor’s degree (lower case) is acceptable in any reference.\n\nBasic Engineering Combined Plan: This can be referred to as the 3+2 (note plus sign) Engineering Program.\n\nBest Western University Inn\n\nbiochemistry\n\nBoard of Trustees: Capitalize as a formal noun when referring specifically to St. Lawrence’s Board of Trustees, otherwise lowercase: The Board of Trustees voted to approve the budget. Lowercase “board” on second reference: The board will meet in the Hannon Room. Note that “board” requires a singular verb.\n\n[Buildings, Named Spaces and Campus Landmarks]: Generally, a shortened version of a space’s name is acceptable after first reference (Charles W. Rebert Residence Hall; Rebert Hall), and often on first reference (Brush Alumni House).\n\nbusiness in the liberal arts is a major: Note the word “in” and that the major is lower case.\n\n(Return to top)\n\nC\n\nCA: college assistant, an undergraduate who has responsibilities in campus residences. Spell out on first reference.\n\ncampus: Lowercase in all uses.\n\ncampus-wide\n\nCanaras Conference Center: The name is “Saranac” spelled backward. Canaras on second reference.

These are to be used sparingly.\n\nA single quotation mark (‘) is not a substitute for an apostrophe (’).\n\nFor other alumni naming idiosyncrasies, go to alumni.stlawu.edu/classnotes.\n\nFull year should be used when referring to a Laurentian who graduate more than 80 years prior to avoid confusion with contemporary students and graduates. (Zebulon Dudley, Class of 1921, and Zachary Smith ’21). Full class year designation should be used on commemorative plaques and signage regardless of graduation year to ensure accuracy over the long term.\n\n[Commas]: University style recognizes that written communications serve a variety of audiences with diverse philosophy on the use of the comma. Therefore, use of the comma is determined by particular needs of the target audience along with the preference of each media outlet, but generally the following guidelines apply:\n\n The use of the serial (or Oxford) comma—the comma before the conjunctions and or or in a series of items—is accepted in both print and electronic media, with the exception of press releases and media advisories in which University Communications will follow comma guidelines in accordance with AP.\n\n Use best judgment for clarity in a complex series (one that has a conjunction within one of the items, e.g., toast, green eggs and ham, and coffee).\n\nCommencement Weekend, Commencement when referring to St. Lawrence’s graduation\n\nevent.\n\nCommunity-Based Learning Program, CBL on second reference.\n\ncomprehensive fee: It comprises tuition, room, board, a student activities fee and class dues.\n\ncomprise/compose: The whole comprises the parts; the parts compose the whole.

Exception: a proper noun in the course title: Shakespeare; Russian history.\n\ncourse work\n\n[coronavirus terminology]\n\nCOVID-19 vs. coronavirus\n\n\"Coronavirus\" is acceptable when referring to the pandemic which began in 2020, but it is a general virus. COVID-19 is the specific disease stemming from coronavirus. If you use \"COVID-19\" on first reference, feel free to use COVID on second or to save space in headlines.
