BY ACCESSING THIS WEBSITE OR USING ANY PART OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY CONTENT OR SERVICES (AS EACH IS DEFINED HEREIN), YOU AGREE TO BECOME BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS THE WEBSITE OR USE THE CONTENT OR ANY SERVICES.\n\nAccepting the Terms of Service:\n\nBy using and/or visiting St. Laurence or the mobile version thereof (collectively, including all content and functionality the “Website”, or the “the Service(s)”, or the “Software”, or “St. Laurence”, “St. Laurence” or “We”) you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by (1) the Terms of Service Agreement described below, (2) St. Laurence’s Privacy Policy, found at https://www.St. Laurence.com/privacy and incorporated here by reference. If you do not agree to any of the Terms of Service and/or the Privacy Policy, please do not use the St. Laurence Website and or the Services.\n\nDuration of Agreement:\n\nThe term of this agreement is equal to the length of time client utilizes St. Laurence.com products and services. Customer acknowledges that cancellation or termination by client of services for any reason will result in remainder of fees due to be paid within a period of 30 days. Customer also acknowledges that within a period of 30 days from the commencement of this agreement, client can cancel at anytime for any reason.\n\nThe services offered by St. Laurence include any St. Laurence-branded URL (the “St. Laurence Website”), St. Laurence messaging services (including, without limitation, SMS text messaging, and email services), St. Laurence mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by St. Laurence in connection with St. Laurence’s business (collectively, the “St. Laurence Services”).\n\nThis Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”, or “Terms”, or “Terms of Service”, or “Terms of Use”, or “Terms and Conditions”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the St. Laurence.com Services. By using the St. Laurence.com Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the St. Laurence Website and use some of our features) or you are a “Member” (which means that you have registered with St. Laurence.com and have a valid account). The term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the St. Laurence Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations (“Applicable Law”) and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the St. Laurence Services, you indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process.\n\nYou may not use the Services as a “Visitor” or as a “Member” and you may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.\n\nPlease read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should leave the St. Laurence.com Website and discontinue use of the St. Laurence.com Services immediately.\n\nChanges to Terms of Service:\n\nWe reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, temporarily suspend, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Service or replace the entire agreement at any time without notice to you. If we do this, we will post the newly modified version of the Terms of Service on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. Such modification to Terms of Service shall be effective immediately upon posting by St. Laurence on the St. Laurence Website. Your continued use of the Service or the Website after St. Laurence posts a revised Terms of Service Agreement signifies your acceptance of the new (revised) Terms of Service Agreement. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Service or the Website. It is your responsibility to regularly check the Website to determine if there have been changes to these Terms of Service and to review such changes. You can review the most current version of these Terms by clicking on the “Terms of Service” hypertext link located at the bottom of our homepage.\n\nEligibility:\n\nUse of the St. Laurence Services and/or registration to be a Member for the St. Laurence Services (“Membership”) is void where prohibited.\n\nThe Website and/or Services are not intended for use by persons under the age of eighteen (18) years, whether acting on their own behalf or as an authorized employee or representative of a corporation or other business entity.

Any registration by, use of, or access to the Website and/or Services by anyone under eighteen (18) years of age, is unauthorized, unlicensed and in violation of these Terms of Service.\n\nSt. Laurence does not have the ability to block minors from the Website. In order to protect minors from certain Content, you can retain a third party service provider to block inappropriate Content from displaying on your Web browser. St. Laurence does not provide and cannot provide a third party provider to perform such services. St. Laurence does not endorse and cannot endorse the quality and capabilities of such services.\n\nIf you are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and you use (or intend to use) the Website and/or Services, you agree that you will not expose minors to any Content on the Website deemed inappropriate for minors.\n\nBy using the Website and/or Services, you represent and warrant that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older and that you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You represent that you are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you do not so qualify, do not attempt to register for or use the Services.\n\nRegistration, Password & Account Security:\n\nIn order to access some features of the Website, you will have to register, create a St. Laurence account and become a Member. You agree not to use the account, username, or the password of another Member at any time. When you register, you will be required to select a username and a password. When you create your account, you must provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information about you as it may be prompted by any registration forms on the Website (collectively known as “Registration Data”). You agree to maintain the accuracy of Registration Data and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to St. Laurence, to keep it correct, current and complete. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Service Agreement.\n\nYou may not impersonate, imitate or pretend to be somebody else or misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity when registering and/or setting up an account on the Website. You may not use as a St. Laurence username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization. You may not authorize others to use your Registration Data. You may not sub-license, transfer, sell or assign your Registration Data and/or this Agreement to any third party without our written approval. Any attempt to do so will be null and void and shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.\n\nYou are solely responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place using your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party at any time and for any reason. You agree to maintain the security of your account password and your Registration Data. You are solely responsible for the use of your account, regardless if another person might have access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.\n\nYou agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session by properly login out. St. Laurence cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to properly log out from your account.\n\nSt. Laurence will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account. You may be liable for the losses of St. Laurence or others due to any unauthorized use of your account.\n\nWe reserve the right but are not obligated to refuse registration of, or cancel any St. Laurence username in our own discretion, for any or no reason and at any time, without notice. We reserve the right but are not obligated to temporarily suspend, or permanently delete any St. Laurence account in our own discretion, for any or no reason and at any time, without notice.\n\nTargeted Keywords:\n\nIf you selected the targeted fans/followers/views option, you must provide a list of targeted keywords. Failure to do so may make your purchase ineligible for any partial or full refunds and we reserve the right not to run the marketing campaign at all. The targeted keywords you specify are used as a general guide to focus in on specific users during the fan procurement process/marketing campaign. We cannot and do not guarantee that the fans you receive will have any or all of the keywords, characteristics, and interests you are looking for.\n\nMarketing Campaign Completion:\n\nOnce your marketing campaign has successfully finished, we consider the order to be fulfilled and completely processed and our obligations met. We cannot and do not guarantee that all of the fans/followers/subscriptions/likes will continue to stay on your page/group/account/video/channel/URL after the marketing campaign is complete. However, based on historical customer data it is very unlikely that any of the fans/followers/subscriptions/likes will leave/unlike/unfollow/unsubscribe from your page/group/account/video/channel/URL after the marketing campaign is finished, so you have nothing to worry about.\n\nElectronic Communication Policy, Interstate Data Transmission & Your Consent:\n\nWhen you visit St. Laurence.com, send e-mails or SMS text messages to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You give us consent to provide you with required notices, agreements and information concerning our Services electronically (collectively know as “Electronic Communications”). We will communicate with you by e-mail, SMS text messages or by posting notices on this Website. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. When we communicate with you electronically, such Electronic Communication(s) may not be received if you violate these Terms of Services by accessing the Website or the Service in unauthorized manner. Your agreement to these Terms of Service constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all Electronic Communications that would have been delivered had you accessed the Website or the Service in an authorized manner. If you want to withdraw your consent to Electronic Communication(s) (including but not limited to, receiving notices and other information concerning our Services electronically) you must discontinue your use of our Services.\n\nWhen you register with St. Laurence.com, you acknowledge that in using St. Laurence.com Services to send and receive Electronic Communications you will be causing communications to be sent through St. Laurence’s computer networks, portions of which may be located in various states and other locations throughout the United States. As a result, and also as a result of St. Laurence’s network architecture and business practices and the nature of Electronic Communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to these Terms of Services, you acknowledge that use of Services may result in interstate data transmissions.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that, other than connecting to our servers by http requests using a Web browser, you may not attempt to gain access to our servers by any means – including, without limitation, by using administrator password or by masquerading as an administrator while using the Website or otherwise.\n\nAccess Cost:\n\nIn order to use our Website and/or access our Services, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web (from a third party provider) and pay any service fee(s) associated with that access (including, but not limited to Internet Service providers or air time charges). You are also responsible for the fees associated with the display and/or delivery of advertisements. You will need to provide all equipment necessary to connect to the Website on the World Wide Web (including, but not limited to a computer, modem, and/or other access devices). If you use a telephone line for access, please call your local phone company to determine if the access numbers you select are subject to long distance or other toll charges at your location.

You may only use the Website, Services and its Content for lawful purposes and in accordance with applicable laws and you are prohibited from storing, distributing or transmitting any unlawful material through the Website. You may not collect or store personal information regarding other users. You recognize that storing, distributing or transmitting unlawful material could expose you to criminal and/or civil liabilities.

However, St. Laurence is not obligated to restrict or monitor submissions in any way, or to block users who submit or transmit inappropriate content.\n\nYou will access and/or use the St. Laurence Website, Services, User-Generated Content and other Content only as permitted under this Agreement. St. Laurence reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Website, Services and the Content.

St. Laurence reserves the right to take appropriate legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the St. Laurence Website and Services.\n\nAccount Access:\n\nIn some cases, we may need the username and password to your Twitter account, Facebook account, WordPress account and LinkedIn account in order to fullfill your order and finish the marketing campaign. This does not happen often, but if we do need the login information, then we will contact you and request it. This is an industry standard practice. In order to make this more secure, we ask that you change your password before sending it to us and then changing it again after we are finished with the marketing campaign. We will NEVER change your password or deny you access to your account. We will only use it to help fulfill your order. Failure to provide the requested login information may delay the completion of or make it impossible to finish the marketing campaign and will make your purchase not eligible for any partial or full refunds.\n\nThe client hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless St. Laurence d/b/a, St. Laurence and its employees against any and all liability, claims, suits, losses, costs and legal fees caused by, arising out of, or resulting from any negligent act in the performance and/or failure to perform work including the negligent acts related to use of login credentials such as but not limited to user names and any passwords and/or but not limited to loss of data.\n\nURL and Data Access:\n\nIf the URL you provide with your order isn’t visible to us or accessible by us, or the fan/follower/member counts are not visible or accessible by us (i.e. password protected, geo-ip protected, Facebook geographic restrictions, private Twitter profiles, privacy settings, account settings, etc) at any time before, during, and after the marketing campaign, we reserve the right to cancel your order and this will also make your purchase ineligible for any partial or full refunds.\n\nFans and Followers:\n\nWhile the campaign is running, you are not allowed to block, ban, or unfollow any new fans or followers. If it is determined that blocking, banning, or unfollowing is occurring, we reserve the right to cancel your marketing campaign and this will also make your purchase ineligible for any partial or full refunds.\n\nOther Marketing Campaigns:\n\nYou are free to run any other marketing campaigns while your St. Laurence marketing campaign is running. However, you must tell us about your other marketing efforts before your St. Laurence campaign starts so we can take that into account when calculating results. If you do not inform us of the other marketing campaigns prior to the start of your St. Laurence marketing campaign, then you agree that St. Laurence is responsible for every fan or follower that you gain during the duration of your St. Laurence marketing campaign.\n\nPayment:\n\nYou can pay for your orders by credit card only. Once payment clears, we will inform you of this and then begin your marketing campaign. Your marketing campaign will not start until your payment clears. This may take up to several weeks, so please be patient. You are not eligible for any refund whatsoever for any reason at any time. By submitting payment, you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at St. Laurence.com.\n\nCampaign Duration:\n\nWe cannot and do not make any guarantees about how long your marketing campaign will take to successfully complete. Any time frames mentioned on the St. Laurence website (and it’s subdomains), by St. Laurence employees, in any chats, emails, phone conversations, or any other correspondence is not a guarantee of how long it will take the marketing campaign to successfully finish. Any estimate provided by St. Laurence regarding how long an marketing campaign may take to successfully finish is simply a guideline designed to help our customers plan ahead.\n\nPausing Campaigns:\n\nBy signing up for St. Laurence’s services, you agree that St. Laurence reserves the right to pause your campaign for any reason and without any notice. It is always our goal to deliver your order as quickly as possible, however, there may be certain circumstances such as your page actively losing fans at a high rate that may make pausing your campaign necessary. Pausing a campaign does not make you eligible for any partial or full refunds.\n\nRefund and Cancellation Policy:\n\nIf at any time you wish to cancel the service, please send an email to billing@St. Laurence.com. The email should have the following information:\n\n– The word “Cancellation” in the subject line\n\n– Which St. Laurence service (site) you are interested in cancelling.\n\n– The transaction ID for your purchase.\n\nOnce we receive this email request (with all of the required information), we will cancel your account within 72 hours. If any of the information is missing, it may take longer to cancel your account.\n\nCancelling an order does NOT mean that you will receive any partial or full refund. Please read below to see if your order is eligible for a partial or full refund.\n\nWe will issue a full refund only if the procurement process/marketing campaign has NOT begun. If the procurement process/marketing campaign has begun, then we cannot modify the order or issue any partial or full refunds. In any case, please contact us via phone (312) 803-4955, email (support@St. Laurence.com), or live chat and we will try our best to help you with your order.\n\nIn order to increase the chances of a successful marketing campaign, we also require that your (facebook or twitter) account/page/group/URL is posting interesting content that will grab the attention of any visitor. Make sure to post regularly, engage your visitors by asking them questions and replying to their comments, and offer services exclusive to fans/followers/subscribers/viewers.
