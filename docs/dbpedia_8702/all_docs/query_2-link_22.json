        "text": "Lawrence Marks, PhD, studies how humansensory systems transduce and process patterns of stimulus energy, and how the resulting information is encoded and represented in perception and cognition. Current work focuses largely on developing sensory-cognitive models of multisensory (gustatory and olfactory) perception of flavors and, more generally, on theoretical implications of multisensory processing for perception and cognition. A second topic, of long-standing interest, is synesthesia, the 'transfer' of sensory qualities across modalities, as when synesthetes perceive speech sounds or music to have distinctive and consistent colors â€“ including the roles of language and culture in synesthetic experiences."
