        "text": "He produced Gene Clark, The Merry-Go-Round, and The Flying Burrito Brothers, etc.\n\nLawrence Marks Obituary - (2013) - Santa Barbara, CA - Santa Barbara News-Press\n\nFrom the liner notes of the Rhino Merry-Go-Round LP:\n\nDefinitely some great production (and playing) on that track.\n\nThere's a great story in Marc Eliot's \"Death of a Rebel\" about Eliot going to see Marks to talk about Phil Ochs's \"Pleasures of the Harbor\". Eliot only had a short time allotted for his appointment and Marks was a busy guy. They started to play the record and Marks said \"I'd forgotten how beautiful this record is\", and pushed all his other commitments aside so they could listen to the whole thing (it's a long record, almost an hour) while Marks reminisced about his relationship with Ochs.\n\nPleasures... and Tape From California which Marks also had a hand in are, for me, the best Phil Ochs albums by a wide margin, and Marks had a lot to do with that."
