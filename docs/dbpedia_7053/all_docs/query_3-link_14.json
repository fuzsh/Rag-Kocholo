        "meta_description": "This series recounts the adventures of three Ukrainian Cossacks who travel around the world and meet people from different countries and epochs, as well as gods and even extra-terrestrials. Created by Volodymyr Dakhno and produced by Kyiv Science Films (today known as Ukranimafilm), the original series premiered in 1967 and ran for nearly 30 years. The three main characters are immediately recognisable: Hrai, the chieftain, is the straight leading man who comes up with all the clever plans. Diminutive Oko can be identified by his trailing moustache, comedic feistiness, and impulsivity. Tur is a brawny strong man with a sensitive and intuitive side. Viewers are won over by the show’s joyful, whimsical mood, and the characters’ innocence and sincerity. As in many vintage cartoons, there is no dialogue; instead, the visuals are accompanied by spirited music and sound effects.",
