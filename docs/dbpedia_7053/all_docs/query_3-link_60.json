        "text": "Review by Roy Boyd\n\nThe Winged Hussar is set in seventeenth-century Ukraine, and place names like Kyiv and the Dnieper River will undoubtedly be more familiar to readers than they were before Russia’s 2022 invasion. Our young hero, Karlis, belonged to a band of Hussars, at least until he betrayed them. Not because he’s the betraying type – quite the opposite, in fact – but because he was ordered to slaughter Cossacks, something he couldn’t bring himself to do. He decides to go AWOL instead and much of the book concerns his old commander’s attempts to track him down. Karlis suspects they’re doing this, and so doggedly, at least partly to avoid the distasteful task they’ve been assigned.\n\nIf you thought Tatar was a caper sauce you had with fish, this book contains enough historical detail so you’ll soon be able to distinguish your Tatars from your Cossacks and Hussars. However, while it educates the reader about the historical setting, it isn’t at all dry, with plenty of action and high drama. Although largely a book about men doing manly things, there is one significant female character. A beautiful archer who’s as strong willed as she is enigmatic, she does little more than hang back and provide commentary on unfolding events, while giving our hero something to pine after.\n\nVincent Brugeas has previous for this type of thing, though his Regiment books, recounting the story of the creation of the SAS, were more documentary style, whereas Cossack could be adapted for an action movie. In fact, it sometimes puts one in mind of Tom Cruise’s The Last Samurai.\n\nRonan Toulhoat and Yoann Guillo’s artwork is impressive throughout, both moody and atmospheric. It often looks like manga, partly on account of the Asian characters, and partly because of the style the artists employ, especially in action scenes. It also resembles an Asterix book drawn in a more realistic style, on account of all the impressive facial hair and fashions being not dissimilar to the first-century Gauls. The colouring, by Guillo, is worth a mention too.\n\nSet in an interesting historical period one imagines many people are largely ignorant of, this dynamic and action-packed story is bloody enough to justify the 12+ rating, and enjoyable and interesting enough to entice readers into picking up further volumes. Which is nice, as Cossacks Volume 2: Into the Wolf’s Den is apparently coming soon."
