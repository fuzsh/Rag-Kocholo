        "text": "Film industries exist within multiple paradigms, showing cultural, social and political links. Motion pictures reflect various constructs, which possess reciprocal functionality – they create, shape and raise awareness of the existing issues. For instance, new genre conventions are first tested and may even cause audience resistance, but later are incorporated into the existing genre or form new ones. Familiarity with the genre traits creates expectations of narrative, characters, their behavior, and character archetypes. From film noir, we all expect a femme-fatale, a detective and a crooked law enforcement official. In horror films, the audience expects monsters, ghosts and other supernatural beings to hunt protagonists. However, the situation gains another dimension of comprehension when characters are anchored through the representation of specific nationalities. For decades, film scholars like bell hooks and many others explored the issue, especially bound to the racial minorities in the U.S. One particular category of film characters’ representation may have been overlooked despite posing significant interest from the historical perspective and contemporary geopolitical dynamics: the archetype of Russians in films. Their representation, which emerged from primarily negative connotations during the Cold War, underwent various transformations after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. to return to where it started in recent years. The following piece serves as a historical overview of the issue of Russian portrayal as a specific archetype in popular Western films. It intentionally avoids comprehensive research on philosophical, cultural and social levels, but presents resilient dynamics and illustrates how popular media creates, reinforces and transforms the nationally anchored archetype.\n\nIn this study, I explore contemporary popular film and television representations of Russian cultural identity after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. My corpus includes two blockbusters: Brother (Brat, dir. Aleksei Balabanov, 1997) and Brother-2 (Brat-2, dir. Aleksei Balabanov, 2000); two comic television series: The Enchanted District (Zakoldovannyi uchastok, dir. Aleksandr Baranov, 2006) and Real-Life Lads (Real’nye patsany, dir. Jeanna Kadnikova, 2010 - present); and, finally, two melodramas: The Man of No Return (Chelovek bezvozvratnyi, dir. Ekaterina Grokhovskaia, 2006) and Gromozeka (dir. Vladimir Kott, 2010). Along with radical political and economic changes, the decomposition of the communist order inaugurated the unravelling of state ideology and the dismantling of existing social norms, conventions and interdependencies. However, these altered historical conditions did not automatically create new mechanisms of identification, nor did they cause the irrevocable eras...\n\nOne of the paradoxes of mainstream Soviet cinema was that it tended to 'make a spectacle' of masculine physicality without (for the most part) drawing attention to it in any explicit sense. The male hero's body was mythologized in patriarchal structures that imposed themselves as neutral. This paper examines the different ways in which the director Kira Muratova challenges this cultural paradigm, by explicitly foregrounding the male body, and destabilizing the male perspective. In this respect, Muratova's films pose a challenge to the archetypal image of masculinity (and femininity) prevalent not just in the Soviet Union, or in mainstream cinema, but in many other places besides."
