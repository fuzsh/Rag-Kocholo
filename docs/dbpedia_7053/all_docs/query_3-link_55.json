        "text": "ComingSoon is debuting an exclusive Cossacks clip from the Ukrainian Chicken Soup for the Soul and Crackle fantasy series. The series is set to debut on the service on Friday, September 1.\n\nCossacks features several actors and crew members who are currently fighting in the war against Russia, including actors Volodymyr Kravchuk and Volodymyr Kanivets, as well as horse trainer Oleg Yurchshyn and pyrotechnician Olexander Suvorov.\n\n“We are so excited to have our series premiere on Crackle,” said producer and creator Oksana Ivaniouk. “Since nearly every aspect of the series is Ukrainian, it is the perfect way for our people to communicate our culture to an American audience where they can join this exciting fantastical adventure for free.”\n\nCheck out the exclusive Cossacks clip below (watch more trailers):\n\n“We’re thrilled to announce this series is coming to Crackle – especially today being Ukrainian Independence Day,” said Phil Oppenheim, chief content officer for Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment. “Our fans have always gravitated towards comedy, action, and fantasy. This fabulously fun series has everything they’re looking for, and more is rolled up into an incredibly smart swashbuckling adventure.”\n\nWhat is Cossacks about?\n\n“Cossacks is a 12-episode series following the irreverent exploits of Ivan, a young Ukrainian peasant raised by a Polish aristocrat who grows into a likable adventure-seeking rogue,” reads the series’ official synopsis. “His cheeky disposition enables him to rob the Tsar of Moscow of a set of precious jewels, yet it’s to a noble end: he needs the royal riches to free his mother from the Ottomans who have enslaved her. However, Ivan accidentally also makes off with a magical heirloom, an earring that had helped the Moscow Tsar defeat his enemies and leads Ivan into endless escapades.”\n\nYou can also view the clip on YouTube below:"
