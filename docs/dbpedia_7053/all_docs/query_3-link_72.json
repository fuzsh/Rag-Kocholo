        "text": "This is one of those films I first came across on late Friday night TV when I was an impressionable pre-teen lad searching for nocturnal movie thrills. This late night schedule-filling role reflects the poor treatment that this film was afforded over many years. For a long time Horror Express was treated by television and video companies alike as a piece of throwaway public domain tat before eventually attaining the honourable status it holds today, as one of the best cult-horror movies of the 1970s.\n\nThis lurid tale of terror on the Trans-Siberian railway (the Spanish title of the film is the wonderful Panico en el Transiberiano) packs a lot of thrills into its modest 87 minute running time. The combination of horror, sci-fi and adventure incorporates an exotic setting, mysterious European beauties, gory murders, an impressive body count and a stellar international cast. It even has a slightly cheesy (but somewhat haunting) musical score (courtesy of John Cacavas) based around a mournful whistling motif that wouldn’t be out of place in a spaghetti western. In many ways Horror Express ticks many familiar boxes but thanks to a slightly unhinged but inventive story, innovative (albeit cheap) special effects and the calibre of the star turns, the film elevates itself into something that amounts to much more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe film tells the story of the ill-fated journey of a range of colourful Edwardian characters aboard the Trans-Siberian express. Unbeknownst to the rest of the passengers, Professor Sir Alexander Saxon (Christopher Lee) is shipping his latest archaeological find across continent, not realising the havoc his find will unleash. Before long the hairy beast emerges from the lump of Manchurian ice from whence it came to begin a rampage of murder and mayhem that leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. As the train thunders along the snowy plains of central Asia, the death toll mounts to engulf the increasingly terrified passengers and ultimately the whole thing spirals towards a tumultuous and destructive climax.\n\nThis promising storyline is not particularly novel in itself but the material is skilfully developed by director Eugenio Martin (billed on initial release – in true Euro-pudding-co-production style – as ‘Gene Martin’) who expertly blends a number of key elements to create the perfect beast of a horror movie. As the story becomes ever more fantastic, the film manages to successfully combine a range of genres and ideas that are ably harnessed in order to keep the action moving along at breakneck speed. Although most elements of the story are somewhat derivative, the sheer range of ideas combine to give the film a welcome verve and energy. The idea of an ancient creature pulled from the ice and inhabited by an alien intelligence that is able to pass undetected from successive human hosts is clearly inspired by John W. Campbell’s 1938 short story Who Goes There? or the two versions of the tale filmed as The Thing in 1951 and 1982. This mixture of science-fiction ideas with elements of Edwardian boy’s own adventure provides a refreshing backdrop for the murderous horror that follows. The ensuing scenes of beastly murder are confidently staged as the alien intelligence sucks out the life-force from each unfortunate victim. The simple effects of blood oozing from the nose and eyes (even as they turn to a fishy white) are queasily effective and one of the elements of the film that set it apart from its more mundane counterparts.\n\nThere is little doubt however, that it is the wonderful cast of Horror Express that gives the film its particular classy take on the Euro-exploitation film. The familiar pairing of Hammer stalwarts Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (as the rival archaeologist Dr. Wells) inevitably adds gravitas to the fantastic proceedings. Their ability to convincingly deliver the most incredulous dialogue is aptly demonstrated in Horror Express (as shown in the trailer below) and the pair provide an element of stability to counter the rapidly unfolding and increasingly outrageous storyline. This is one of Cushing and Lee’s best non-Hammer outings and although the two actors play characters initially at odds with each other (in some ways mirroring their roles in another of their notable non-Hammer films; The Creeping Flesh [1973] where they also play rival scientists) they quickly fall in together creating a formidable stiff-upper lip alliance. There is a real warmth in their on-screen relationship which reflected their real-life friendship – here most poignantly manifest as it is reported that Lee gently encouraged his colleague to take up his first role following the recent death of his beloved wife Helen (which had earlier forced him to pull out of filming Hammer’s Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb [1971]).\n\nThe enjoyment gleaned from watching one of the cinema’s greatest horror pairings is enhanced somewhat later on the film as a third ‘guest star’ bursts onto the train. Not usually known for his horror roles, Telly Savalas nevertheless makes the most of his brief role as the Cossack Captain Kazan. Resplendent in his red Cossack jacket and chewing up the scenery with some gusto, Savalas adds even more impetus to the film’s rapidly approaching climax. The rest of the mainly Spanish supporting cast are also excellent, particularly Alberto de Mendoza as the crazed monk Father Pujardov. Clearly inspired by the real-life Rasputin, de Mendoza invests his character with a wild intensity that provides the film with yet another bizarre but essential ingredient.\n\nBy the time the film reaches its inevitable explosive finale, the audience have been besieged with images of red-eyed murder, monstrous hairy hands, alien intelligences, grisly brain operations and legions of bloody-eyed zombie Cossacks. As the train plummets into oblivion (taking the monstrous alien with it) it is guaranteed to leave viewers feeling breathless and yet somehow invigorated, although it may cause some to seriously rethink those ambitious European inter-railing activities they had planned for their winter vacation…"
