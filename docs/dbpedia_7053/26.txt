This film was also known as Cossacks Beyond the Danube. It was shot in the Ukrainian langauge in Newton, NJ, partially at the Little Flower Monastery. The viewing print had English subtitles. According to reviews, the film was also shown with English subtitles at its New York opening in late Jan 1939. The Var review pointed out that the operetta on which the film was based had remained very popular since its first production. Another film, based on the same operetta, was released in New York in Sep 1938, under the title Zaporozets za Dunayem [Cossacks Beyond the Danube]. Some sources confuse that film, made in Russia in the Ukrainian language, and directed by Y. P. Kavaledge, with the American-made, Edgar Ulmer-directed film. According to modern sources, the success of Ulmer's previous Ukrainian musical made for Vasile Avramenko's company, Natalka Poltavka, made Cossacks in Exile possible. In a modern interview, Ulmer indicated that he shot the film in the same area that he shot The Singing Blacksmith. Modern sources have commented on Ulmer's very stylized use of silhouettes and shadows in Cossacks in Exile. ...

The Zaporogian Cossacks are the pride of the Ukraine, but the Imperial government in Moscow opposes them. When the men at a Zaporogian fort learn that Moscow is sending soldiers to destroy their unit, they decide to appeal directly to Czarina Catherine. Meanwhile, Oxana, a Ukranian village girl, is in love with fellow villager Andrew and rejects the overtures of her older suitor, Prokip. When news comes that Catherine has refused Ukranian pleas and that the soldiers will now be required to join the ranks of the Russian army, the Cossacks decide to destroy their fort and leave the Ukraine, accompanied by their families. The commander of the fort is captured and exiled to a Siberian monastery, where he prays for the freedom of his people. The other Cossacks flee on the Danube River to Turkey, where they live in peace, but still yearn for their homeland. Ivan Karas and his wife Odarka, Oxana's parents, worry about her because Andrew did not arrive in Turkey with the rest of the villagers and Prokip continues to pursue her. One day, after the Cossacks have helped the Turks in their battle against the Arnauts, the Sultan of Turkey arrives at Ivan's village to see for himself what the Cossacks are really like.

One day, after the Cossacks have helped the Turks in their battle against the Arnauts, the Sultan of Turkey arrives at Ivan's village to see for himself what the Cossacks are really like. Although the sultan does not reveal his true identity, Ivan treats him very warmly. The sultan is so impressed with Ivan that he invites him to "the sultan's palace," pretending to be the sultan's emissary. At the palace, Ivan is dressed in royal finery and shown to the harem, still unaware that his escort is the sultan. While they talk, Ivan reveals that he would like to meet the sultan to ask if the homesick Cossacks could now return to their own country. As Ivan is being entertained by the sultan, Oxana looks toward the Danube, waiting for Andrew. When Andrew finally arrives, Prokip sees the lovers embrace and becomes so jealous that he arranges for the couple to be arrested by the Turks as spies. Soon Ivan returns home, dressed in new Turkish finery, and impresses Odarka. When they learn what has happened to Oxana and Andrew, she insists that he go to the Pasha, the local Turkish official. Thinking that Ivan's Turkish clothing is the disguise of a spy, the Pasha plans to hang him as well as Oxana and Andrew. They are all saved just in time, however, when the sultan arrives and sets them free, then orders Prokip arrested. Finally revealing his true identity, the sultan then orders that the Cossacks be allowed to return home. Following a joyous celebration, the Cossacks set sail for their homeland.
