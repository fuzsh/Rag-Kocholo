        "text": "A defining moment of the “old” John McCain—as many Americans, even some of his friends, have begun to refer to him as he was before his run for the Presidency in 2008—took place in February, 2000, during his first bid for the White House, when he was challenging George W. Bush for the Republican nomination in the South Carolina primary. McCain had recently upset Bush in New Hampshire and was in a buoyant mood, vowing that, like “Luke Skywalker fighting the Death Star,” he would not only defeat Bush but reform a party corrupted by “big money” and, as he later put it, “agents of intolerance.”\n\nWithin days, sordid attacks began to appear: flyers on car windows claiming that McCain, who had adopted an orphan from Bangladesh, actually had fathered a black child; recorded phone messages, or robo-calls, spreading rumors that McCain’s wife, Cindy, who had once been addicted to prescription painkillers, was a junkie; and lies, propagated by an obscure group of Vietnam veterans, suggesting that McCain had become a traitor while serving in Vietnam.\n\nMcCain’s response was decisive: he pulled from television his negative advertisements, and announced to supporters, “If we don’t prevail, my friends, we know that we have taken the honorable way.” On the evening of the primary, McCain and his family watched the returns in a hotel suite in Charleston. As the polls came in, showing that he had lost by more than ten points, Cindy wept. “How could they believe all that about you?” she said of the public.\n\nMcCain, after embracing his wife and children, headed down to a ballroom to deliver his concession speech. “I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land,” he said. “I want the Presidency in the best way—not the worst way. The American people deserve to be treated with respect by those who seek to lead the nation. And I promise you: you will have my respect until my last day on earth. The greatest blessing of my life was to have been born an American, and I will never . . . dishonor the nation I love or myself by letting ambition overcome principle. Never. Never. Never.”\n\nIn the final weeks of the 2008 campaign, it became clear that John McCain might lose more than the Presidency. On October 6th, slipping steeply in the polls, he held a rally in Albuquerque. Rather than speak off the cuff, as he preferred, he kept his eyes on a teleprompter. During the 2000 race, McCain was known as the “happy warrior,” but now his tone was harsh. Angrily waving a finger, McCain portrayed his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, as a shadowy figure who never seemed to reveal his true identity. McCain noted that Obama’s campaign recently had to “return thirty-three thousand dollars in illegal foreign funds from Palestinian donors.” McCain urged the audience to wonder, “Who is the real Barack Obama?”\n\nBefore he even finished the speech, he and his aides had begun their now notorious campaign—sometimes in public, sometimes sub rosa—to supply insinuating answers to this question. Ads appeared accusing Obama, who had served on the boards of two charities with William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, of being allied with a “terrorist.” Voters received flyers featuring a mug shot of Ayers and the words “Terrorist. Radical. Friend of Obama.” Then came the same kind of robo-calls that had savaged McCain in 2000, and that he had once denounced as messages of “hate.” McCain even hired one of the same firms that Bush used in 2000. The messages warned, among other things, that Obama had tried to stop doctors from caring “for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions.” Meanwhile, McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, charged that Obama was “palling around with terrorists.” Other surrogates claimed that Obama was “anti-American,” a “guy of the street” who “used cocaine,” and had “friends that bombed the Pentagon.” According to Newsweek, Michelle Obama asked an aide, “Why would they try to make people hate us?”\n\nEarly on, McCain vowed that he wanted “the most positive kind of campaign.” But even though he sometimes seemed uncomfortable, shifting in his chair or looking away from the camera, he was at the heart of those personal attacks—demanding that Obama confess his relationship to a “washed-up terrorist,” and proclaiming that Obama would “lose a war in order to win a political campaign.”\n\nAs the rallies of McCain and Palin grew angrier—at the mention of Obama’s name, supporters yelled “Traitor!,” “Kill him!,” and “Off with his head!”—McCain seemed startled by what he had helped unleash. When, at one rally, a woman called Obama an untrustworthy “Arab,” McCain turned ashen and stammered, “No, Ma’am. He’s a decent family man.” Afterward, Ray LaHood, a Republican congressman from Illinois, who earlier had condemned the campaign’s inflammatory rhetoric, told me, “That’s the John McCain I know.”\n\nObama and his supporters decried McCain’s tactics. Yet some of the strongest criticism came from people whom McCain revered or who had long revered him. And it was not merely about strategy—the backbiting that always consumes losing campaigns. It was about the very nature of John McCain. In their eyes, at least, their hero was losing not only an election but his reputation—or, as one prominent backer put it, “his soul.”\n\nWilliam G. Milliken, a moderate three-term Republican governor of Michigan, was part of the unusual coalition that had made McCain an almost singular figure in American politics. Although for most of his career McCain’s voting record was consistently conservative, he was far more popular with centrist Republicans, independents, and many Democrats than he was with the Party’s base. His appeal was rooted less in ideology than in character: he presented himself as a figure who would never pander or betray his convictions. When he fell short of his principles, as in the 1989 Keating Five scandal—the Senate Ethics Committee found that he “exercised poor judgment” in helping a major donor—his willingness to lacerate himself in public only reinforced this impression for many.\n\nMilliken, who served as governor from 1969 to 1983, had been a gunner in the Air Force during the Second World War, and he was amazed by the way McCain, after being shot down as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War, had stoically endured more than five years in captivity. He was also impressed that McCain had challenged his own party by embracing campaign-finance reform. Though the two men disagreed on social issues, Milliken felt that McCain did not exploit such issues as “wedges” to divide the electorate. In 2000, McCain—in a move that, seemingly, no self-preserving Republican politician would make—took on two of the most powerful leaders of the Christian right, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. As McCain put it, “Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics.”\n\nMany of McCain’s supporters were equally struck by his refusal to use his status as a war hero to impugn others’ patriotism, particularly in the case of David Ifshin, a student radical who, in 1970, travelled to Hanoi and delivered a scathing radio address against the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese broadcast Ifshin’s words into the cells where McCain and other U.S. prisoners were being held. Sixteen years later, Ifshin met with McCain, who had once publicly criticized his actions, and apologized; McCain accepted the apology and later defended Ifshin on the Senate floor. Similarly, in 1994, McCain backed Bill Clinton’s efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam, offering cover to a President whom many conservatives had derided as a draft dodger. Clinton later called McCain “a great man.”\n\nDuring the Michigan Republican primary in 2000, Milliken endorsed McCain, helping him carry the state. When McCain ran in 2008, Milliken again supported him in the state primary, even though McCain was up against Mitt Romney, whose father had been governor of Michigan in the nineteen-sixties; Milliken had served as his lieutenant governor. “I received criticism for not backing Mitt, but I thought McCain was the best person to be President,” Milliken said.\n\nYet, last month, Milliken expressed disbelief that McCain, after experiencing “the most disgusting aspects of politics” in South Carolina, had adopted the same methods against Obama. He said, “McCain keeps asking, ‘Who is the real Barack Obama?,’ but what I want to know is who is the real John McCain?”\n\nIn 2000, some prominent Republicans came to McCain’s defense, among them Frank Schaeffer, the son of Francis Schaeffer, an evangelist and anti-abortion crusader who is credited with helping to create the religious right. Schaeffer worked closely with his father, who died in 1984, but he felt that the movement had become extreme. In 2000, Schaeffer gave McCain his family’s imprimatur, vouching for him on Christian radio shows. Six years later, Schaeffer, who had a son in the Marines, co-wrote a book, “AWOL,” which spoke of the need for Americans to serve their country. McCain provided a blurb saying that the book illuminated “a more genuine and wiser patriotism.”\n\nBut, in October, Schaeffer, a lifelong Republican, wrote an open letter to McCain that said, “If your campaign does not stop equating Sen. Barack Obama with terrorism, questioning his patriotism and portraying Mr. Obama as ‘not one of us,’ I accuse you of deliberately feeding the most unhinged elements of our society the red meat of hate, and therefore of potentially instigating violence.” He went on, “You are unleashing the monster of American hatred and prejudice, to the peril of all of us. You are doing this in wartime. You are doing this as our economy collapses. You are doing this in a country with a history of assassinations.”\n\nAccording to one of McCain’s longtime friends, the endorsement of Obama by General Colin Powell was “especially painful,” as there was no one whom McCain “admired more.” Equally devastating were criticisms made by John Lewis, the civil-rights leader and Democratic congressman from Georgia, whom McCain had idolized. In the 2004 book “Why Courage Matters,” which McCain wrote with his aide Mark Salter, a chapter was devoted to Lewis’s march against racism in Selma, Alabama, during which he was beaten nearly to death. Because of the actions of Lewis and his colleagues, McCain wrote, many Americans were “ashamed that they had not loved their country as much as the marchers; that they had not the courage to march into the force of such injustice.” McCain also praised Lewis for decrying incendiary black leaders, such as Louis Farrakhan, as “bigots.” McCain concluded, “I’ve seen courage in action on many occasions. I can’t say I’ve seen anyone possess more of it, and use it for any better purpose and to any greater effect, than John Lewis.” A month before the election, Lewis released a blistering statement accusing McCain and Palin of “sowing the seeds of hatred and division.” Though McCain publicly called the accusations “shocking and beyond the pale,” a campaign aide told me that when McCain first heard Lewis’s remarks he sat in silence inside the campaign’s official bus.\n\nEven members of McCain’s inner circle expressed bewilderment and anger over his seeming transformation. One friend told me he thought that the man he had known for decades would never “take the low road to the highest office in this land.” Near the end of the campaign, a perception had set in, among the press and some of McCain’s former supporters, that the “old” John McCain was a fraud—a creation of consultants and a once fawning media. Reporters had often romanticized McCain and ignored evidence of his conservative ideology and his personal flaws—a fierce temper, impetuousness, and a tendency to demonize opponents. But the people who know McCain well, including many Democrats, believe—as the former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle put it—that McCain is a fundamentally “good man.” The friend of McCain said, “I would take issue with anyone who says that he was a sham. He was the real deal.” In this view, McCain’s fall in 2008 has an almost mythic cast—it is the story of a great man who, overcome by what he himself once called the “disease” of Presidential ambition, sacrificed all. “I don’t think he’ll ever recover,” another friend, who has been instrumental in his career, said. “My fear is that people who view the John McCain from the years ’96 to ’06 will think it was a political gimmick and what they’ve seen in the last five months is who he really is. If honor is your ideology, and you lose that, then what do you have left?”\n\nAfter 2000, few politicians in America held greater moral stature than McCain. Though he remained unpopular with the right, his unusual coalition of supporters was rapidly growing. “I say to independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians—come on over,” he liked to say. His defeat in South Carolina had seemed to confirm his virtue, especially to Democrats who had long suffered at the hands of Republican operatives such as Lee Atwater.\n\nHis popularity was largely driven by a single belief: that he was more honorable than other politicians. Todd Harris, one of McCain’s strategists in 2000, told me that he has never worked on a campaign more closely focussed on a candidate’s biography, and on that candidate’s ability to project integrity. Accordingly, McCain’s advisers let him speak to reporters for hours, unfiltered, on the Straight Talk Express. “It was a completely character-driven campaign,” Harris said. “Other than the push for campaign-finance reform, many people would be hard pressed to recall any real policy initiatives that we campaigned on.”\n\nMcCain’s heroic reputation was centered on his experiences in Vietnam, but it had increased in Washington. Unlike most U.S. legislators—who spend hours a day picking over the minutiae of budget projections or health-care policy, and tending to the mundane needs of constituents—McCain waged gallant, and often futile, crusades against the corrupt and the powerful. He took on the tobacco industry and repeatedly lost, enhancing his stature in defeat. In the Senate, his signature concerns—including campaign-finance reform and opposition to secret “earmarks” for legislators’ pet projects—were primarily ethical ones. Ivan Schlager, a former Democratic counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee, who worked with McCain during the nineties, recently told Time, of McCain’s approach, “It’s not ideological. It’s good guys and bad guys.”\n\nStarting in 1999, with the help of Mark Salter, McCain published a series of best-selling books that championed his character-based politics. In “Character Is Destiny,” McCain said, “It is your character, and your character alone, that will make your life happy or unhappy.” And in “Why Courage Matters” he wrote, “Without courage all virtue is fragile: admired, sought, professed, but held cheaply and surrendered without a fight. Courage is what Winston Churchill called ‘the first of human qualities . . . because it guarantees all the others.’ That’s what we mean by the courage of our convictions.”\n\nMcCain’s view of politics as a moral quest, and his seeming frankness, endeared him to the press. In 1997, David Nyhan, a columnist for the Boston Globe, wrote, “For a lot of people, the Senate is ninety-nine bozos and this guy.” Nyhan, who died in 2005, argued, “You cannot break McCain’s will. You cannot make him quit. You cannot coerce him with threats.” In 1996, Michael Lewis wrote in The New Republic, “I’m beginning to understand the war that must occur inside a fourteen-year-old boy who discovers he is more sexually attracted to boys than to girls. The longer I hang around McCain the harder it is to fight the feeling that just maybe I’m . . . Republican.” A headline in Esquire declared, “John McCain Walks on Water.”\n\nMcCain’s efforts to construct a personal narrative around ethics and sacrifice were no doubt aimed at helping him secure the White House. But Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator from Nebraska and another Vietnam veteran, who is close to McCain, told me that the only way to understand McCain—born into a military family, with a father and a grandfather who were admirals—is to grasp that he is driven less by ideas than by an almost chivalrous notion of honor. Under torture in Vietnam, McCain once gave a false confession, and afterward he contemplated suicide, fearing, as his biographer Robert Timberg wrote, that he had “dishonored his country, his family and himself.” In 1989, McCain said that enduring the Keating Five scandal was worse than being a prisoner of war, because “the Vietnamese didn’t question my honor.” Torie Clarke, who was McCain’s press secretary at the time, told me that what was most upsetting to him was not that others were accusing him of unethical behavior; it was that he had “looked into the abyss and saw that maybe he had done something dishonorable.” The experience propelled his backing, in the mid-nineties, of campaign-finance reform—one of his first major breaks with Republican orthodoxy.\n\nThroughout his political career, McCain has seemed keenly aware of the internal tension between his ambition and his moral code. In his 2002 memoir, “Worth the Fighting For,” he acknowledged, “I didn’t decide to run for President to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be President because it has become my ambition to be President. . . . In truth, I’d had the ambition for a long time.” Yet during his 2000 run many aides and reporters who travelled with him—including me—thought that he often seemed more at peace when he was losing. He constantly cited his literary hero, Robert Jordan, from Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” who, fighting the Fascists, awaits imminent death. As he put it to me at the time, “Hell of an ending.”\n\nAfter the South Carolina primary, he delivered a speech on the one aspect of his campaign that he saw as a cynical tactic: his defense of the Confederate flag as a local “symbol of heritage.” He said, “I feared that if I answered honestly I could not win the South Carolina primary. So I chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth. . . . I do not intend for this apology to help me evade criticism for my failure. I will be criticized by all sides for my late act of contrition. I accept it, all of it. I deserve it. Honesty is easy after the fact, when my own interests are no longer involved. I don’t seek absolution. Like anyone else, I can only try to resist future temptations to abandon principle for expediency, and hope that in the end my character is judged from the totality of my life, and not by its flaws alone.”\n\nAfter the 2000 campaign, McCain tilted farther away from his party. Though some of that distancing was motivated by his animus toward Bush, part of it seemed to reflect a feeling of liberation from the dictates of ideology. He joined Senator Ted Kennedy in pushing for a patients’ bill of rights, and worked with Democrats on far-reaching environmental legislation that would limit carbon emissions. In 2005, he was one of only seven Republicans to vote against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Most notably, he voted twice against Bush’s tax cuts, having declared that “sixty per cent of the benefits . . . go to the wealthiest ten per cent of Americans,” and that “Donald Trump doesn’t need a tax cut.”\n\nTom Daschle, who was then the Senate Minority Leader, told me that he and McCain spoke several times in the spring of 2001 about the possibility of McCain’s switching parties. The Democrats were one vote short of regaining a majority in the Senate, and were lobbying several potential candidates for conversion. Daschle said that McCain was “very close” to making a move. “We were almost at a point of thinking how we would roll it out,” Daschle said. “We talked about committee assignments, and staffing, and other considerations that would be part of the agreement.” Daschle said that he and McCain had made plans to meet at McCain’s ranch, in Sedona, Arizona. Then Jim Jeffords, the liberal Republican from Vermont, announced that he was becoming an Independent, which gave the Democrats the majority, and the courting of McCain ended. McCain and his aides insist that the Senator was never close to leaving the Party, though they do not deny that there were conversations about the matter.\n\nAs McCain continued edging toward a new center in American politics, a group of his advisers began to talk casually about trying to create an independent party—like the Bull Moose Party, established by McCain’s hero Theodore Roosevelt. The platform for such a party was never fully thought out, but participants told me that it included the following ideas: pushing campaign-finance reform and curtailing special interests in order to restore faith in government; affirming that the federal government had a limited but important role in public life and should not be dismantled, as Newt Gingrich’s wing of the Republican Party had attempted to do; a greater call for public service, either through the military or through programs like AmeriCorps; less emphasis on divisive social issues; promoting a progressive tax system that favored the middle class rather than the rich; and regulating the excesses of the capitalist system. (Around this time, McCain appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and, echoing Roosevelt, said, “We have had regulatory agencies always to curb the abuses or potential abuses of the capitalist system. This is not a totally laissez-faire country.”)\n\nOne participant said of the platform, “It wasn’t so much conservative. It had elements of what the New Democrats were talking about.” He said that the belief was that, for years, the “center in American politics had never been tapped” and that there was a middle path “away from the polarizing base.” He added, “McCain was, by temperament and instinct, attracted to it.”\n\nJohn Weaver, another member of the group, who was McCain’s top political strategist at the time, told me that he considered whether it would be possible for McCain to run for President on a third-party ticket. But he quickly concluded that the American political system made it all but impossible for such a party to win. As he put it, “This system, as it’s presently set up, automatically pulls good people to a darker side of politics.”\n\nBy 2004, McCain’s increasing heterodoxy had made him even more deeply detested by many hard-core conservatives. On a recent radio show, Rick Santorum, the former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, recalled that “almost at every turn, on domestic policy, John McCain was not only against us but leading the charge on the other side.” James Dobson, the leader of the religious group Focus on the Family, declared that McCain was “not a conservative and, in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are.” Meanwhile, McCain had become so well known for his increasingly bipartisan approach that John Kerry asked him to be his running mate that year. According to aides, McCain did not seriously consider the offer—he still saw himself as a Republican, and, as an adviser later told this magazine, he did not want his career to culminate in the Vice-Presidency.\n\nIndeed, by then McCain and his inner circle had realized that he could emerge as the Republican front-runner in 2008. Shortly after Kerry’s failed overture, Bush’s chief strategist, Karl Rove, sought Mc-Cain’s help in reëlecting President Bush. Suddenly, the interests of the two nemeses converged: Bush needed McCain to campaign for him; McCain needed Bush’s support if he was to court the conservative faithful. This pact led, in August, to their now infamous hug, in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nMany of McCain’s strategists and allies concluded that he had to shift, at least somewhat, to the right. One of his early backers, Ray LaHood, the Illinois Republican congressman, told me bluntly, “To get the nomination, McCain had to appeal to the base of our party.” Presidential candidates always placate their bases during the primaries in order to win the nomination, but for McCain, with his reputation of unwavering principle, the task was treacherous. Still, Weaver told me, his strategic team was confident that McCain could do it: “Sometimes you can negotiate on details while maintaining true to your principles.”\n\nDuring the 2004 race, McCain campaigned tirelessly—“worked his tail off,” in the words of Bush’s press secretary—for the President. The following year, he assured conservatives that he would support Bush’s tax cuts. More shocking, in the spring of 2006 he announced that he planned to give the commencement speech at Liberty University, which was run by Jerry Falwell—one of the so-called “agents of intolerance” and “forces of evil.” Several weeks before the address, McCain appeared on “The Daily Show.” Jon Stewart, who has said that he would have voted for McCain in 2000 had he won the Republican nomination, expressed consternation that McCain was paying tribute to the religious right. “It strikes me as something you wouldn’t ordinarily do,” Stewart said. When McCain insisted that he would speak at any university, Stewart asked, “Are you going into crazy base world?” McCain hesitated, then said, “I’m afraid so.”\n\nAccording to his aides, McCain tried to find some balance. He gave the same speech at Liberty University as he did at the New School, in New York, and, in a clear reference to his charge against the “agents of intolerance,” he emphasized the need for “respect” whether “we think each other right or wrong in our views.” Nevertheless, McCain was clearly shape-shifting. Hoping both to placate the Republican establishment and to gain some of Rove’s organizational discipline and prowess, he recruited several of Bush’s top operatives, though Weaver told me that the campaign balked at hiring anyone involved in the attacks on McCain in 2000. McCain enlisted as his campaign manager Terry Nelson, who served as national political director for Bush in 2004. The campaign also brought on Steve Schmidt, a Rove acolyte known as the Bullet, and Mark McKinnon, Bush’s media guru. Around Christmas of 2006, one of McCain’s former Senate advisers told me that he attended a campaign event and was struck by how much the atmosphere had changed from 2000. “It was an establishment campaign,” he said, and was based on the calculus that if you wanted to get anything accomplished you first had to win the nomination.\n\nThe new campaign organization, however, was beset by internal squabbling and quickly burned through its funds. In July, 2007, McCain forced out Nelson; Weaver resigned over the change, and most of the Old Guard—save Mark Salter and a few others—either left or were effectively demoted. McKinnon, who remained with the campaign at the time, told me that McCain had “put a bullet in some of his best friends.” The campaign was now dominated by strategists and consultants who had little personal connection to McCain. “They have Bushies all in that operation,” the former Senate adviser told me. “This is the great irony. You have layers and layers of Bushies. They don’t understand what McCainism is.” Schmidt, known for his military discipline and strict message control, eventually assumed command. The campaign even hired one of the operatives at the center of Bush’s efforts against McCain in South Carolina in 2000: Tucker Eskew. One of McCain’s friends characterized Eskew as a master of “demonization.” Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina and one of McCain’s closest allies, summed up McCain’s new approach to the 2008 election: “This is not Luke Skywalker here.”\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, when McCain’s top advisers told him that his only hope of winning the election was to adopt hard-right tactics, McCain agreed. Graham recalled McCain saying, “It is not my goal to run this race and be admired as the maverick that lost.” Schmidt told me that there was never any discussion about having McCain suddenly change into “a conservative conservative.” The campaign, however, began increasingly to exploit wedge issues, such as guns and abortion, and cast doubt on Obama’s patriotism. The campaign also terminated what was a cornerstone of McCain’s 2000 Presidential campaign: the Straight Talk Express. Over the years, McCain had grown so close to members of the media that he joked that they were his “base.” His new campaign airplane had been designed with a large couch to accommodate reporters and evoke the interior of the Straight Talk Express, but journalists were cordoned off.\n\nMcCain and his advisers also began attacking the “liberal media,” a classic Rove gambit that appealed to the conservative faithful. After the Times reported critically on a McCain aide’s lobbying ties, Schmidt exploded: “Whatever the New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization. It is a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day attacks the McCain campaign.”\n\nAt the same time, many pundits who had admired McCain were repelled by his policy shifts and his ruthless tactics. In July, 2008, Joe Klein, of Time, wrote that although he had once considered McCain “an honorable man” who would run an “honorable campaign,” he had been “wrong.” Richard Cohen, of the Washington Post, declared, “The John McCain of old is unrecognizable. He has become the sort of politician he once despised.” Elizabeth Drew, who, in 2002, published a glowing book titled “Citizen McCain,” lamented in Politico that, “in retrospect, other once-hailed McCain efforts—his cultivation of the press . . . and even his fight for campaign-finance reform (launched in the wake of his embarrassment over the Keating Five scandal)—now seem to have been simply maneuvers.”\n\nIn mid-October, McCain’s brother Joe—who had once said that it was his duty to “stay the hell out of the way”—sent out an e-mail pleading with the campaign to change its approach to the media:\n\nLet those who know [McCain] talk to the people about him, through the press. This policy of trying to so tightly “control the message” by cutting off those who know him from the cacophony of national and local voices—the reporters and the editors—is counter-intuitive, counter-experiential, and counter-productive. It creates ligatures and tourniquets that are causing gangrene. It has gradually bled away all the good will that this great man had from the press, for he alone among politicians would talk to them openly, without finesse, without guile.\n\nThose inside McCain’s campaign note, with some justification, that the twenty-four-hour news cycle and the media’s obsession with gaffes have made impromptu press conferences and unfettered access unrealistic. In a recent conversation, Salter told me that at one moment the press was criticizing McCain for lacking a central message and the next was castigating him for not being spontaneous. Salter was apoplectic over the “meta-narrative” suggesting that McCain had fundamentally changed. “There was no decision by McCain to say, ‘Let’s go to the dark side,’ ” he said. “That’s just bullshit.” He added, “Reporters loved the idea that he was challenging the Republican Party and the establishment, and they didn’t particularly care what he was talking about” in terms of policy. “He’s always been a Republican.” Salter expressed a genuine sense of betrayal—a feeling clearly shared by McCain—toward journalists who had turned on McCain. “I’ve spent many hours trying to figure out why the press has erected a double standard that clearly favors one candidate over another,” Salter said. “Maybe it started with his position on the war.” He shook his head. “I’m not a shrink. It just is what it is.” In the spring of 2008, he noted, McCain had embarked on a poverty tour of places like New Orleans and Selma, but virtually no one in the press paid attention. He had invited Obama to hold town-hall meetings across the country; his opponent rejected the idea. And, despite the urging of strategists, Salter said, McCain had refused to let the campaign release advertisements featuring Obama’s controversial former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. “John is the same person,” Salter said. “He doesn’t know how to be any different.” He went on, “Everyone kept saying, ‘Where’s the old happy warrior?’ It was fucking crazy. The only way we could have gotten McCain to hold on to his brand, in the eyes of the media, was if McCain had bowed to the choice of the élite, which was Obama. McCain would have been crushed by twenty points, but everyone would have said what a great man he was and what a gracious loser. Anything short of that, he was going to be branded a ‘new’ John McCain.”\n\nBut many who hoped that McCain could modify his policies without sacrificing his identity felt that he had crossed the line. He surrounded himself with conservative economic advisers, such as Phil Gramm, a fanatical proponent of deregulation, and Jack Kemp, the apostle of supply-side economics. He called for making Bush’s tax cuts permanent. He declared that the estate tax, which he, like Teddy Roosevelt, had championed, was now “one of the most unfair tax laws on the books.” (Grover Norquist, the head of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, who once dismissed McCain as “the nut-job from Arizona,” and who says he wants to make the federal government so small that “we can drown it in the bathtub,” applauded McCain for adopting much of his organization’s agenda.) McCain reversed his position on offshore drilling and endorsed the teaching of “intelligent design.” He disowned his own bill on immigration reform. Whereas he had once decried the use of torture under any circumstances, he now voted against banning the same techniques of “enhanced interrogation” that had been practiced against him in Vietnam.\n\nBob Kerrey, who had generally defended McCain’s campaign tactics as the usual mudslinging, told me, “The lamb may lie down with the lion, but he won’t get a very good night’s sleep. And John McCain has not been sleeping very well since crawling in bed with Grover Norquist and James Dobson.”\n\nThe more McCain gave in to the base the more he seemed to need to demonize his opponent, as if to justify his own moral compromises. Friends say that other factors appeared to fuel his contempt. Daschle thought that McCain, coming out of a military tradition, felt that you must “earn your stripes,” and a young, inexperienced Illinois senator’s challenging him was comparable to “a lieutenant taking on an admiral.” The animus also seemed to come from McCain’s romantic conception of politics. To McCain, a politician truly proved his mettle by standing up to his party’s leaders—something that Obama had not done—and having “the scars” to show for it. Obama represents a different model of a politician: he is a policy-driven person who tries to pass legislation by uniting interest groups and by creating new majorities for these policies through inspiring rhetoric.\n\nIn the 2000 campaign, during a time of relative prosperity, McCain could focus on campaign-finance reform and earmarks—important but marginal issues that cast him as a rebel. Politics, though, is rarely a Manichaean battle. It is about taxes and health care and budgets and interest rates and regulations. Perhaps this is why McCain so often seemed hapless on the trail. He tried to present the Iraq war as a battle between good and evil—his refrain was that he had stood, virtually alone, for the surge—but to many Americans the conflict was far murkier. He made vows that were more appropriate for an action hero than for a Presidential candidate: “I’ll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I’ll get him. I know how to get him. I’ll get him no matter what, and I know how to do it.” In his most dramatic gesture—widely interpreted as a cynical stunt but in fact a reflection of his heroic view of politics—he “suspended” his campaign to rush back to Washington during the financial crisis, as if he alone could solve it.\n\nNear the end of the campaign, he repeatedly told his supporters, “I can inspire a generation of Americans.” But by then he had already abandoned the traits that had once galvanized so many: his courage to fight his own party on ethical issues; his support of progressive tax policies; his embrace of a limited but vigorous federal system that curbed the abuses of capitalism. “The irony is that this is the moment for the 2000 John McCain,” the former Senate adviser said. “The whole capitalist system is being questioned, as it was at the turn of the nineteenth century, when Roosevelt was dealing with the ‘malefactors of great wealth.’ ”\n\nJust before the Republican Convention, McCain, who often seemed miserable in his new right-wing guise, tried to resurrect his former identity. He decided to choose as his running mate Joe Lieberman—a pro-choice Democrat who shared McCain’s views on foreign policy. The choice would have signalled both McCain’s independence and his return to a more bipartisan agenda. “He wanted Lieberman badly,” a McCain confidant said. But when leaders of the base threatened to challenge him at the Convention, McCain did the one thing that he believed a great politician never did. As the confidant put it, “John capitulated.”\n\nTwo days before the election, in Peterborough, New Hampshire, McCain repeated his old line welcoming “Republicans, independents, Democrats, libertarians, and vegetarians” to his cause. Yet most of his old coalition had already deserted him. Even the voters who turned out at his rallies were often not there to see him: they had come for Sarah Palin. During joint events, which drew thousands more people than his solo appearances, she usually received louder cheers than he did. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, a few weeks ago, many in the crowd filed out after Palin introduced McCain, while he was starting his stump speech. On the day before the election, she and McCain campaigned separately: about five hundred people attended McCain’s rally in Tampa, Florida; an estimated seventeen thousand came to see Palin in Jefferson City, Missouri. “She’s like the plant in ‘Little Shop of Horrors,’ ” McCain’s friend Bob Kerrey said. “She’s devouring him.”\n\nFor all McCain’s attempts to shift rightward, the conservative base never “embraced” him, as LaHood put it. Grover Norquist called McCain’s relationship with conservatives a “loveless marriage.” As November 4th approached, McCain’s friends said, he seemed more and more irritable and angry. “He’s not enjoying himself,” a longtime friend who had played a key role in many of his campaigns said. “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see that.”\n\nMcCain seemed most upset when people began to question his sense of honor. When editors at the Des Moines Register pressed him about the veracity of his attacks on Obama—one suggested that there had been a “detour” of his Straight Talk Express—he began to rock in his chair and clench his jaw. He snapped that he had always told the “absolute truth, and that’s been my life of putting my country first.”\n\nPeople in McCain’s circle wonder how he will cope not only with his defeat but with the perception that he has betrayed his ideals. The longtime friend said, “How does he get up in the morning? Is he at peace, or is it a horrible dark void that he carries with him forever?”\n\nGeorge McGovern, who lost to Richard Nixon in 1972, told me about the anguish he felt when he returned to the Senate—as McCain will soon do. “I thought everyone was either scorning me or pitying me,” McGovern recalled. In 1989, he said, he ran into Walter Mondale, who had lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan five years earlier. “He said, ‘George, how long does it take to get over it after you’ve lost?’ I said, ‘I’ll let you know when I get there.’ ” Ultimately, McGovern said, it was easier to stop brooding knowing that he had tried his “damnedest to win” but had never done anything that “wouldn’t let me sleep at night.”\n\nIn the final weekend of the campaign, when it was almost certain that McCain was going to lose, he actually seemed the happiest. He joked and bantered with aides. He appeared on “Saturday Night Live,” irreverently referring to his “strategy called the Reverse Maverick,” in which “I do whatever anyone tells me.”\n\nOn the night of his defeat, he gave a concession speech as memorable as the one he had delivered in South Carolina. Paying tribute to Obama and the historical importance of an African-American reaching the White House, he said, “Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country.” He continued, “Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face. I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him but offering our next President our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences. . . . We are fellow-Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.”\n\nSome of McCain’s friends and supporters believe that he has done “lasting damage,” as one put it, to his reputation, and that such magnanimous gestures came too late. Others are confident that the “old” McCain will return to the Senate and become a central figure, forging that elusive center. Bob Kerrey said that the bitterness of the campaign will soon fade, and McCain will again serve his country with dignity.\n\nMcCain has suggested that the public’s perception of his actions is not what matters most. Hours before voting began, he appeared on “Monday Night Football,” and recalled a football coach who had been one of his greatest inspirations. McCain said, “The most important lesson he taught me was that you’ve always got to do the honorable thing, even when nobody’s looking—because maybe nobody will know, but you’ll know.” ♦"
