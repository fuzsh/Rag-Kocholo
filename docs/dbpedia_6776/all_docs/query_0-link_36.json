        "text": "Maps that show which party won each state in any given presidential election are ubiquitous in American history textbooks. They can be powerful visualizations, showing some broad regional patterns in voting. Yet by reducing tens of thousands or even many millions of votes in each state to a single value they wash away much of the complexity of the spatial patterns in American voting. To reveal and examine that complexity, in Voting America we present a number of additional maps that present a more nuanced, granular, and subtle picture--or rather pictures--of the ways American voters have cast their ballots in US presidential elections during the past two centuries."
