        "text": "Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is homing in on what advisers see as a potential liability for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz: his departure from the Army National Guard two decades ago.\n\nWalz, introduced Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, ended his 24-year military career to run for public office in 2005 — several months before the unit he led deployed to Iraq.\n\nWalz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005. His unit was alerted about a deployment to Iraq in July, and the unit deployed there in October. Walz filed to run for Congress in January 2005 with paperwork that was certified by the Federal Election Commission the next month.\n\n“When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him — a fact that he’s been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,” Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump’s running mate and a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday at a news conference in Michigan.\n\n“I think it’s shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you’re going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,” Vance added.\n\nThe strategy, which Trump amplified Wednesday by calling Walz a “DISGRACE” on Truth Social, is a throwback to 2004, when Republicans attacked Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry’s record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. Chris LaCivita — who was a consultant to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that helped sink Kerry’s bid — is a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign and has signaled an eagerness to reopen the playbook on Walz.\n\n“And when his men needed him the most … as they headed into the Crucible that is combat … he deserted them … left them,” LaCivita posted Tuesday on X, shortly after Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. “Why? So he could run for Congress.”\n\nIn introducing Walz, 60, to a wider audience beyond Minnesota, the Harris campaign has emphasized his military record, as well as his experience as a football coach. Campaign officials frame his decision to leave the National Guard and pursue a career in politics as a path that offered him new and meaningful opportunities to help service members and veterans.\n\n“After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform — and as Vice President he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement.\n\nWalz has faced such attacks before, including in his re-election campaign in 2022, when his GOP opponent questioned his decision to leave the service in 2005. Walz’s campaign responded with a letter signed by 50 veterans praising his record and leadership.\n\n“Governor Walz secured additional funding for new veterans homes,” read the letter, a copy of which the Harris campaign shared Wednesday with NBC News. “In his first term, Minnesota was one of just seven states initially selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in the ‘Governor’s Challenge’ to eliminate veteran deaths by suicide.”\n\nErick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, drew attention Tuesday to a paid letter to the editor that scrutinized Walz’s service and was published by the West Central Tribune newspaper of Willmar, Minnesota, in 2018, days before he won his first term as governor. Erickson also called for a return of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, prompting LaCivita’s initial social media post. Other posts followed.\n\n“He deserted his men and quit before they went to combat,” LaCivita wrote of Walz in response to a complimentary post from Alyssa Farah Griffin, a co-host of the daytime talk show “The View” and a former Trump White House aide who has since denounced Trump.\n\nLaCivita’s previous work with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth stands as one of the most aggressive and potentially consequential political attacks of the modern era.\n\nKerry — who was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and, for wounds sustained in battle, three Purple Heart medals — had drawn the ire of many veterans for his advocacy against the war after he returned home. And as he sought the presidency in 2004, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran ads accusing him of lying about his service on 50-foot aluminum crafts that ran dangerous missions in the Mekong Delta waterways of South Vietnam. Some of the veterans featured in the ads said he had won awards under false premises.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam before becoming friends with Kerry in the Senate, criticized the ads and noted that the veterans making claims against Kerry did not serve on his boat. Some of those who did supported Kerry’s accounts. The allegations, which Kerry did not immediately counter, muddied the picture he presented of himself as a war hero — which appeared to be the group’s aim from a political perspective. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth may not have proved its case, but it sowed doubt about a perceived strength of Kerry’s — his war service — and about his credibility.\n\nFactCheck.org concluded after exhaustive research that “at this point, 35 years later and half a world away, we see no way to resolve which of these versions of reality is closer to the truth.” Kerry lost to President George W. Bush.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard in 1981, just after his 17th birthday. After he transferred from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996, he served in the Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, the Minnesota Guard’s public affairs officer. Walz, Augé added, “culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion” and “retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.”\n\nDuring Walz’s nearly quarter-century of service, he was part of flood fights, responded to tornadoes and spent months on active duty in Italy, according to the Harris campaign. Walz “was deployed to Italy in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,” the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in 2022, attributing the information to Walz in an article about the scrutiny of his military service.\n\nWalz and Vance are the first veterans on a national ticket for either major party since McCain was the GOP presidential nominee in 2008. Vance, 40, briefly chronicled his experiences in Iraq in his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” recalling his work as a public affairs Marine.\n\n“Sometimes I’d escort civilian press, but generally I’d take photos or write short stories about individual marines or their work,” he wrote. “Early in my deployment, I attached to a civil affairs unit to do community outreach. Civil affairs missions were typically considered more dangerous, as a small number of marines would venture into unprotected Iraqi territory to meet with locals.”\n\nIn a post Tuesday on X that highlighted Walz’s hunting and military background, the Harris campaign shared undated video that featured him talking about gun control.\n\n“We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz says in the brief clip.\n\nVance alluded to the video at campaign stops Wednesday, accusing Walz of misrepresenting his military service and asserting that he never spent time in a combat zone.\n\n“Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?” Vance asked at an event near Detroit. “What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you’re not. ... I’d be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.”\n\nLater, arriving for an event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance told reporters that he had “served in a combat zone” and “never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I’ve always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.”\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also alluded to the video in a statement, telegraphing the campaign’s intentions to keep pressing on Walz’s military record.\n\n“Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war — except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,” Leavitt said. “If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American’s nightmare.”\n\nAsked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\n\n“In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,” the spokesperson said. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.”"
