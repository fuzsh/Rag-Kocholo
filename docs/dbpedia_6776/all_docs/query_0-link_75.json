        "text": "Doesn't it seem odd that it'll soon be over -- this insane, historic, aggravating, stirring, inspiring, profoundly moving and ridiculous thing that's been a part of our lives for so many months? But the final rallies have taken place, and in a few hours, barring the completely unforeseen, it really will end, amid guaranteed scenes of intense emotion. More than enough has already been written and said about the momentous nature of the choice America faces in this election, and the decision that all the polls suggest it's going to make, so I won't add to that for now. I'll just say this: I'll be liveblogging right here in a short while (at 6pm eastern, 11pm UK time), bringing you all the presidential results and highlights of the congressional elections as they happen, along with reports from our team in Chicago, Phoenix and elsewhere, and I hope you'll join me.\n\nThe basics\n\nDaniel Nasaw's most excellent guide to the evening is here, and I added some thoughts about when and how we can expect the various states to be called tonight here. Oh -- and I just remembered that CNN will be interviewing holograms; on any other evening this would surely be the most exciting thing imaginable.\n\nPaths to victory\n\nThe simplest way to look at where we stand tonight is probably this: Barack Obama should win all the states John Kerry won in 2004, despite John McCain's efforts to grab Pennsylvania and (a longer shot) New Hampshire. If he does win the Kerry states, he needs only Florida or Ohio and he's won 270 electoral votes. But before we hear results from those states, we'll almost certainly hear from Virginia: if Obama wins there, he doesn't need Florida or Ohio so long as he gets one of the other battlegrounds -- Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada or North Carolina. (We won't know for sure that he's won, of course, until the Kerry states come in for the Democrats, so the networks will definitely wait for Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and maybe the others -- not that McCain is going to win California in any remotely credible universe.) If Obama wins none of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, he can certainly still win, but he'll need a combination of those other battlegrounds as well.\n\nWhen will we know?\n\nThe big problem in constructing any kind of timetable for the night is that we don't know the gap between the closing of polls in a given state, and the calling by the networks: a state closing first doesn't mean it'll be called first, and Florida, especially, will probably keep us waiting. But here's a rough idea of the first half of the evening. At 6pm/11pm, polls begin to close in Kentucky and Indiana (though not in the whole state till 7pm/midnight); then at 7pm/midnight polls close in Virginia, Georgia, and most of Florida and New Hampshire. Kentucky's a shoo-in for McCain, but Obama is only trailing slightly now in Indiana and Georgia. If either state isn't quickly called for McCain, he's in for a very bad night; should Obama win Indiana, he's in for a landslide. (Results from the west of the state, which is Obama territory near Chicago, will arrive later than in the Republican east.) If Obama wins Virginia alone among all these early states, McCain is going to need to do very well among the tossups, or seize Pennsylvania.\n\nAt 7.30pm/12.30am polls close in Ohio and North Carolina. An Ohio win effectively hands Obama the election, though you'd want to wait for Pennsyvlania to be sure; polls close there at 8pm as they do in 17 other states plus Washington DC, including the swing state of Missouri.\n\nGot all that? If McCain doesn't win Pennsylvania, and the polls suggest he won't, he'd have to win every single tossup state in order to squeak to victory. So it's perfectly likely this will all be over by about 9pm/2am. But some people probably said something similar in 2000...\n\nHouse, Senate, governors\n\nI'll bring you highlights of these, at least until we know the identity of the president. Democrats, who lead in the Senate 51-49 (relying on Joe the Lieberman), might get 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority, making a Democratic president's work much easier -- for the first time in a generation. They control the House 235-199; if they make gains of 20 or more, we can call that a landslide. Eleven governorships are up for grabs, but it's only North Carolina and Washington where things are close. Democrats currently hold them both.\n\nJoin in\n\nI want to know where you are, how you're marking tonight, what you're eating and drinking, how you're feeling, what your gut's telling you -- all that stuff. And you might as well tell me, in the comments, because I'm certainly going to be telling you. (I also have fantasies that somebody's following this blog from Vanuatu, or Antarctica, or Pitcairn, so can you please pretend that you are even if you're not?) In an emotional return to the beer consumed during the first presidential debate liveblog, all those weeks ago, my choice tonight is Sierra Nevada. History, plus beer, here in a little while.\n\n6.15pm (all times eastern from now on): So, polls in most of Indiana and half of Kentucky have closed. In the earliest national exit poll data, which has been dribbling out for a little while now, more than 60% said the economy was their main voting issue. 67% worry about being able to afford healthcare. It's all very different from the \"values\" focus of 2004. Here's more. Karl Rove is burbling away on Fox at the moment; he says it's the first time since he was 18 years old that he hasn't been directly involved in a presidential election...\n\n6.21pm From the comments: nice to know we're being read in the San Francisco Obama phonebank headquarters, while commenter evalgoiavot notes: \"I just watched three epidsodes of battlestar galactica back to back to relieve the tension. I DEMAND CERTAINTY! and also more whisky.\"]\n\n6.29pm For ceremonial reasons, let's mark the first results of the election, even though they're completely meaningless: with fewer than one per cent of votes in, Obama leads McCain 55%-44% in Indiana, while McCain, amazingly enough, leads in Kentucky.\n\n6.47pm OK, back after brief technical issues. Apologies. 13 minutes until polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Many fantastic comments.\n\n6.55pm The first state exit polls, which are leaking in various places, look a fair bit tighter than some of the polls. Leads of 4%, 2%, 1% and 1% respectively for Obama in PA, VA, FL and OH. But we know there are lots of reasons to distrust exit polls, right?\n\n6.56pm Judging by the comments, almost all of you have better food and drink than me tonight. Thanks for that. Also, where are CNN's holograms -- huh?\n\n7.00pm Polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Here are the final words on the McCain campaign from McCain's senior strategist Steve Schmidt, although to be honest I'm not sure what the heck they mean. \"Crossing the finish line head up\"?\n\n7.01pm CNN and others call Vermont for Obama and Kentucky for McCain. Entirely unsurprising! So we begin our electoral college vote count:\n\nObama 3 McCain 8\n\n7.10pm MSNBC predicts a House composition of Dem 261 Rep 174 -- a Democratic landslide -- though there's a significant margin of error to that. Meanwhile: the fact that we don't yet have a call on Indiana is surely a sign that it's going to damn close, isn't it? (Oh -- yes, indeed, the networks and AP agree that it's \"too close to call\", as opposed to simply too early to call. So much for my astonishing Punditry Insight.) Mark Warner, the Democrat, is expected to win the Virginia senate seat he's contesting against Jim Gilmore, which makes a Senate net gain of one.\n\nSenate Dem net gain +1\n\n7.14pm Let the record show that Wolf Blitzer is, now, finally, talking to holograms on CNN. They look like slightly worse versions of the holograms in Star Wars, and while they probably look amazing to Wolf they just look like superimposed images to everyone else. Money well spent, CNN!\n\n7.23pm Crowds have begun streaming into Grant Park, Chicago, from where I expect soon to hear from Jonathan Freedland; everybody's running madly for a front-row position. I wonder if any of them got them on Craiglist in highly suspicious circumstances? McCain leads 53% to 46% with 2% of precincts in; McCain leading 51% to 48% in Indiana with 12% in. Mike Tomasky has thoughts on the Indiana situation...\n\n7.29pm OK, real news. Official demographic exit polls, extrapolated to the statewide vote -- a very unreliable exercise -- put Obama at 54%-45% in Virginia and 52%-46% in Indiana. Remember, in 04 the exits said Kerry had won...\n\n7.30pm Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia; Fox calls West Virginia for McCain, which would be Obama 3 McCain 13 -- nobody else is following suit yet.\n\n7.35pm Dan Glaister checks in from outside the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, where McCain will hold his election night party (although not necessarily attend it, oddly). Two cleaners just left the ballroom. \"Where are all the people, then?\" one said. \"I thought there'd be lots more people than this,\" the other replied. A thrilling atmosphere of excitement, then.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell's seat in Kentucky is too close to call -- a bad sign for the Republicans, and a hint that the Democrats might be in with a shot of their 60-majority goal.\n\n7.41pm Obama;'s at 57%-42% with 80% of precincts reporting, in \"the most bellwether county in the country,\" Vigo County, Indiana, which apparently has only gone against the national result twice since 1892. Make of it what you will. I'm opening my first beer, but not in a celebratory or commiseratory fashion -- anyway, I'm neutral and unbiased, right? -- but because... well, just because.\n\n7.45pm Networks project McCain to win South Carolina. [Clarification: for the purposes of the running total, I'll count as called a state that's called by two of the main networks or by a main network and AP, and of course I'll keep you up to date with conflicting opinions, as with Fox on WV.]\n\nObama 3, McCain 16\n\n7.51pm: Some analysis of exit polls from Ohio and North Carolina, courtesy of Marc Ambinder: \"In Ohio -- more than 85% say they're worried about the economy; only 16% of Clinton voters are supporting McCain; The share of the black turnout is higher than in 2004; Obama's getting 98% of them. White men and white women are backing McCain -- but very narrowly -- only by three to four points in the exit polls. Obama lost non-college white males by nine points -- that's an improvement over John Kerry's performance.\"\n\n8pm: Polls close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, DC, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Missouri. Pennsyvlania's the big question, of course, while Missouri is the other to watch. Stand by for a whole bunch of easy calls.\n\n8.01pm: Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, DC called for Obama, Oklahoma and Tennessee to McCain. ME, which splits its votes, Obama 3 McCain 1 (CNN)\n\nwhich makes it...\n\nObama 77 McCain 34\n\nNBC calls Pennsylvania and New Hampshire for Obama, too, making it 103 - 34, and marking the failure of McCain's efforts to make Pennsylvania the centrepiece of his last-ditch campaigning in recent weeks. Oh, and now AP too:\n\nObama 103 McCain 34 Obama takes Pennsylvania. Given the fact that we have essentially none of the precincts reporting, this is indicative of a very big win.\n\nAnd Alabama is too close to call? Wow.\n\n8.13pm: In Phoenix, some Young People are singing a song, while wearing blazers. It's all very nice and very Republican. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been elected senator for Delaware, which is going to be slightly awkward if he becomes vice-president too. Still, he has a fallback, I suppose. And Jeanne Shaheen, the former New Hampshire governor, seems to have won her race against the incumbent John Sununu, who was always incredibly vulnerable.\n\nSenate Dem net gain +2\n\n8.22pm: Ezra Klein has some exit polls I haven't seen, projecting crazy wins for Obama in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. As he points out, they're probably wildly inflated, if remotely accurate at all...\n\n8.25pm: Ah, marvellous: problems with voting in West Palm Beach, Florida, where absentee ballots, at any rate, appear to require voters to join two boxes together by drawing another box, which is more like a Mensa puzzle than a ballot paper.\n\n8.30pm: Slightly late with this, sorry, but the networks are projecting that Elizabeth Dole, who spent the last part of her campaign accusing Democratic challenger Kay Hagan of being on the side of the evil godless atheists, has been seriously defeated in North Carolina.\n\nPolls are closing in Arkansas, which McCain's going to win.\n\n8.35pm: Arkansas, Alabama for McCain...\n\nObama 103, McCain 49\n\n...and hints that Georgia is about to go to McCain, too."
