MacArthur Foundation.\n\nHelping to build a more just world.\n\nAnd additional funding from the Park Foundation.\n\nCommitted to raising public awareness.\n\nWith additional funding for this program from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n>> Tonight on Frontline... >> Two candidates emerge from this crucible.\n\n>> Just two totally implausible people.\n\n>> It is one of the great political stories that anyone has ever seen.\n\n>> 'Cause it's so clear and so different, and two great men.\n\n>> I don't think it gets much more interesting than this.\n\n>> We often joke that if there's a saloon fight going on, he's going to go in there to pick up a chair.\n\n>> Here's a guy who's going to do whatever he thinks ought to be done.\n\nAnd we don't know what that's going to be.\n\n>> If there's one S.O.B.\n\nwho could pull this out, it's John McCain.\n\nHe's at his best when the odds are seemingly insurmountable.\n\n>> McCain resurrected himself by hard work and courage at a time when everyone thought he was gone.\n\nObama turned out to be disciplined and designed a strategy which had a little bit of Barry Goldwater and a little bit of John F. Kennedy.\n\n>> He's smart enough to look into the future and gutsy enough to take it on.\n\n>> He's very idealistic, very romantic, very symbolic, and very much charisma driven.\n\n>> Obama has got inner toughness-- the velvet glove around the steel fist.\n\n>> That's somebody who started out as a state senator, is now the Democratic nominee.\n\nThat's a pretty spectacular rise in 12 years.\n\n>> The choice between these two guys is, to a large extent, a choice between who can make sense of the world and represents actual progress.\n\n>> NARRATOR: \"The Choice,\" 2008.\n\n>> The delegates are trickling into Boston... >> 35,000 people are expected to descend on Boston... >> The convention is being held in the heart of the city... >> NARRATOR: In July 2004, as the Democrats were nominating John Kerry, a young newcomer was about to steal the show.\n\n>> ...the next senator from the state of Illinois, Barack Obama.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> The buzz was there was this up-and-coming young state senator from Illinois.\n\nMost people probably couldn't pronounce his name.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Barack Obama's moment had begun one month earlier with a telephone call.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n>> We were riding around in downstate Illinois, and the phone rang, and it was the campaign manager for John Kerry.\n\n>> They needed somebody who was charismatic and optimistic and could electrify a crowd.\n\n>> When he hung up the phone he was excited and he said, \"I know exactly what I want to say.\"\n\nHe said, \"I really want to talk about my story as part of the larger American story.\"\n\n>> Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.\n\nMy father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya.\n\n>> He really emerged from very, I think, unlikely circumstances.\n\nHis mother was a young woman who had been raised in the Midwest.\n\n>> She was born in a town on the other side of the world in Kansas.\n\n>> She met in a Russian class a student from Africa, during her freshman year, named Barack Obama.\n\n>> My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.\n\n>> They very quickly got married, and Senator Obama was born in August of that year.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In his first book, Obama writes about his parents' struggle.\n\n>> \"The year that my parents were married, miscegenation still described a felony in over half the states in the union.\n\nIn many parts of the south, my father could have been strung up from a tree for merely looking at my mother the wrong way.\"\n\n>> I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama used the facts of his own life to define his interpretation of American politics and to challenge in important ways the ideas of the past.\n\n>> I remember going across the convention hall while he was speaking.\n\nDuring a convention, there's chaos, and the audience is restless and people are talking all the time.\n\nAnd so virtually all of the standard speeches are drowned out.\n\nBut his presence and his delivery caused people to quiet down, listen, and then began to respond to him.\n\n>> ...a belief that we're all connected as one people.\n\nIf there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child.\n\nIf there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> I remember very distinctly standing in the hall, watching him give the speech and watching the reaction to it.\n\nAnd all around were people with tears in their eyes.\n\nAnd I realized at that moment that his life would never be the same.\n\n>> It is that fundamental belief-- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper-- that makes this country work.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Backstage, his wife, Michelle, offered her advice.\n\n>> Michelle didn't want him to go out there and come across as too arrogant.\n\nShe gave this little, \"Don't screw it up, buddy\" line to him, which probably calmed his nerves a little bit.\n\n>> I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America-- there is the United States of America.\n\n(cheers and applause) There is not a black America and a white America, a Latino America, an Asian America-- there's the United States of America.\n\n(applause) >> I knew much of it was rhetorical, and when he said there's no white America, there's no black America, I kind of winced a little bit because I know that there is certainly a black America.\n\nBut I understood where he was coming from.\n\n>> Hope, in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty-- the audacity of hope.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> Michelle sees this happening.\n\nAnd she has tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nI'm sitting in the crowd and a woman next to me is crying, bawling her eyes out.\n\nAnd she just keeps screaming, \"This is history.\n\nThis is history.\"\n\n>> We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\n>> And Obama comes along with a message that says, \"We're going to look beyond red and blue.\n\nI am going to transcend many of these traditional divisions, not only ideological and partisan, but also racial.\"\n\nAnd he embodies his message in a unique way, and I think that, to me, is the core of his political strength.\n\n>> Thank you very much everybody.\n\nGod bless you!\n\n(cheers and applause) >> This guy's going places.\n\n>> This is like watching Tiger Woods.\n\n>> It's amazing he's still a state senator in Illinois.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Immediately, the pundits and journalists began casting Obama in a new light.\n\n>> Forget \"uniters and dividers\"; tonight, we heard from a transcender.\n\nHe lit it up.\n\nPeople talk about him, quite openly, as the first black president of the United States.\n\n>> The speech he gave in 2004 was a stump speech that he gave...\n\nI mean, I was literally watching it on television and, like, reciting it.\n\nAnd I was calling a friend of mine, and both of us were cracking up that this was the same speech he used to give to crowds of, like, ten people, or in some church on the south side, where no one, you know, knew how to pronounce his name and they were just meeting him for the first time.\n\nAnd this was a speech he would give.\n\n>> All news, all the time.\n\n>> In New York City today, Republican delegates are enjoying a sunny afternoon touring the town.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Four weeks later, in August of 2004, the Republicans held their own convention.\n\n>> This week brings their national convention.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It would be George W. Bush's party, but one guest wasn't entirely welcome.\n\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, a true American hero, Senator John McCain.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> NARRATOR: Arizona Senator John McCain had been wrangling with the Bush administration for nearly four years.\n\n>> We were in very icy relations with the White House.\n\nAnd when I say, \"icy,\" that's not really giving it justice.\n\nI mean, Siberia doesn't have that much ice.\n\n>> NARRATOR: These Republicans remembered the story-- back in 2000, McCain had nurtured the image of a maverick, surprisingly and dramatically beating George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nHe'd run an insurgent's campaign out of this bus.\n\n>> Did you instruct the party not to take any money from the tobacco... >> NARRATOR: He had put together a coalition of moderates and independents and won.\n\n>> Victory over the favored son... >> ...extraordinary political day as the voters of New Hampshire have spoken.\n\n>> The McCain win was so overwhelming... >> We got our ass kicked.\n\nWe got humbled, we got put on our knees in the snows... the cold snows of New Hampshire.\n\n>> I knew we were going to lose; I just didn't know it was by 19 points, thank you very much.\n\n>> I think he loved it.\n\nI think he loved the experience of New Hampshire.\n\nThe primary night itself, he smiled, he was pleased, he was happy-- I could detect no great joy.\n\nThat's a fascinating quality in a personality.\n\nHe always calls it \"steady strain.\"\n\nIt's a nautical term when you throw a line to another ship, you don't want any slack in the line.\n\nYou want to keep the strain on it steady.\n\nAnd he always tells us that, \"steady strain.\"\n\nAnd that's... moments when we're erupting in happiness or joy, or moments where we'd just gotten our asses kicked and aren't feeling too good.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Two weeks later, in South Carolina, steady strain would be sorely tested.\n\nKarl Rove and the Bush insiders were ready to strike back.\n\n>> Things happened in South Carolina that were pretty ugly.\n\nSouth Carolina's got a long tradition of being very tough, and it lived up to its tradition.\n\nAnd it was very, very tough.\n\n>> It was a series of attacks-- personal life distorted, political record distorted.\n\nIt's a real smear campaign, but it hurt.\n\n>> There were rumors all over the state that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock, and that his wife, Cindy, was a drug addict.\n\n>> It's just despicable.\n\nWhat they did was despicable.\n\nI think they were desperate.\n\nAnd if you think about it, had Bush lost South Carolina, it was over for George Bush.\n\n>> And it's wrong, and it's wrong.\n\nMy friends, this is what's going on around here... >> Senator McCain was so angry, at one point, that he said that \"George Bush was the combination of the scarecrow, tin woodman and cowardly lion.\"\n\nIn other words, a man with no brain, no heart and no courage.\n\nAnd that's what he said in public.\n\nImagine what he said in private.\n\nIt was something I think that colored his view of President Bush for a long time to come.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain lost his temper... >> You should be ashamed.\n\n(overlapping argument) ...and he lost the primary by 12 points.\n\nHe quit the race.\n\n>> He assumed he'd never get a chance to run for president again, that his time was done.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Still, McCain was a political player.\n\nTwo months later, an unhappy alliance.\n\n>> Looks like we drew a crowd.\n\nJohn McCain and I just had a very good meeting.\n\n>> McCain was forced to really bite his tongue in 2000 after losing and to go play nice with Bush.\n\n>> ... over a hundred people to hear how the meeting went... >> It just... you could just see how much he didn't like it.\n\n>> I have said from the very beginning that I will support the nominee of the party.\n\nI look forward to enthusiastically campaigning for Governor Bush for the next six months between now and November.\n\n>> You go back to the day he endorsed Bush for president in 2000, and it... we had to force the word \"I endorse him\" out of him.\n\n>> Why do you have difficulty using the word \"endorsement\" when you talk about your support for Governor Bush?\n\n>> I endorse Governor Bush.\n\n>> The nature of the front... >> Could you say that again?\n\n>> I endorse Governor Bush.\n\nI endorse Governor Bush.\n\nI endorse Governor Bush.\n\nI endorse Governor Bush.\n\n(laughter) I endorse Governor Bush.\n\n>> By the way, I enthusiastically accept.\n\n>> It was just... it was one of the most awkward endorsement moments that I had ever seen as a political reporter.\n\nThat carried through-- I mean, he grudgingly helped out in 2000 in that campaign, but really not a lot.\n\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the fall of 2000, George Bush would win the presidency.\n\nA deeply angry John McCain decided to focus on his own agenda.\n\n>> McCain came out of the 2000 campaign drawn to the idea that he had become a brand.\n\nHe represented something to the American public of independence, pragmatism, bipartisanship.\n\nAnd he moved very aggressively to maximize the leverage of that brand legislatively.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He fought the administration's tax cuts.\n\nHe pushed campaign finance reform, held hearings on climate change, building his reputation as a maverick.\n\n>> It had been bad for him in the Republican caucus.\n\nHe had been booed at one point when he walked in.\n\nHe really felt like these are not the guys he was comfortable with.\n\nThey didn't have that much in common.\n\nHe was really a bitter man in those days.\n\n>> He was angry for the way he was treated.\n\nHe was angry because his staff were not asked to be part of the new administration.\n\nHe was angry because he thought George Bush was playing to the most conservative elements within his own party.\n\nAnd for all those reasons, he felt alienated.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Sources say one way McCain expressed his anger was to threaten to change parties.\n\nHe denies it, but here's the way others tell it.\n\nIt started with his top aide, John Weaver.\n\n>> Well, what I've heard-- I've heard from Tom Downey, a former Democratic congressman, was having lunch with John Weaver.\n\nWeaver said to him, \"Why has nobody ever approached John McCain about leaving the party?\"\n\nAnd Downey was flabbergasted.\n\nHe said, \"If John McCain wants a call from somebody in the Democratic Party, let me know and I will have anybody in the party call him immediately.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: In 2001, the Democrats had one less vote than the Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThey were hunting for Republicans who might switch sides.\n\n>> So, Senator McCain received a phone call one day from Senator Kennedy, who is a very good friend of his.\n\nHe asked him to come to a meeting in his office, and they made the full court press, asking him to switch sides of the aisle.\n\n>> There was a time when we came very close to convincing him to join our caucus.\n\nHe certainly left us with the impression that that possibility was a very real one.\n\nI don't think we would have spent the time and made the effort we did had it not been perceived to be real and sincere and genuine.\n\n>> He had long, long conversations with Ted Kennedy, with John Edwards, with Tom Daschle, with Chris Dodd.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The discussions lasted for weeks.\n\nMcCain finally decided not to do it.\n\n>> This was something he considered very carefully and chose not to do for a lot of reasons.\n\n>> NARRATOR: One reason-- some thought McCain might be setting himself up to run again.\n\n>> He decided that to become the nominee, he had to make peace with the Bush wing of the party and with people who were avid Bush supporters.\n\nAnd he set out to do so.\n\n>> NARRATOR: John Weaver made a phone call that would signal it was time to make amends.\n\n>> I called Mark McKinnon, a friend of mine from the 1980s in Texas, who was an intimate of both the president and Karl Rove, and asked for a meeting with Karl.\n\n>> I said, \"Great, I'll give Karl a call.\"\n\nAnd I called Rove.\n\nRove was surprised, but he said, you know, \"I appreciate the thought, and I... and I'd like to get together.\n\nI'd like for you to come and be a witness.\"\n\nI said, \"okay.\"\n\n>> We know that John McCain's popular, more popular than President Bush at the time.\n\nProbably one of the most popular Republicans in the country at the time.\n\nAnd that he could give entree to voters that George Bush couldn't get.\n\n>> Karl said there was a place right across the street from the White House, a little coffee shop.\n\nAnd so we all met and we sat down.\n\nAnd it was a very heartfelt, sort of straightforward conversation.\n\nJohn opened it and said, you know, \"Listen, I think it's time to put this behind us.\"\n\n>> And at some point during the conversation, I said to Karl, \"Why isn't... why isn't John campaigning for the president?\"\n\nAnd Karl said, \"We didn't think he would.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Nobody has asked him.\"\n\nAnd he said they would.\n\n>> And they walked out of that coffee shop that day, determined to get through 2004 as a team; however uncomfortable it might be, however unlikely it might be-- that George Bush and John McCain were going to go to November together as partners.\n\n>> Four more years!\n\nFour more years!\n\n>> Please... please, my friends... >> NARRATOR: And that's how John McCain found himself center stage at the Republican Convention in 2004.\n\n>> We need a leader with the experience... >> NARRATOR: In front of extremely ambivalent Republicans, Mr. Outside was trying to become Mr.\n\nInside.\n\n>> Appearing at the convention in such a prominent way is a complex political strategy.\n\nIt's a balancing act between his identity as someone who transcends party and also, at the same time, trying to become more acceptable to the party.\n\n>> Keep that faith.\n\nKeep your courage.\n\nStick together.\n\nStay strong.\n\nDo not yield.\n\nDo not flinch.\n\nStand up.\n\nStand up with our president and fight.\n\nWe're Americans.\n\nWe're Americans, and we'll never surrender.\n\nThey will.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The Republicans now knew John McCain hadn't given up on another run for the presidency.\n\n>> Obama is expected to be thrown into the limelight.\n\n>> He can barely show his face in public without creating some kind of sensation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: January 2005-- it's been five months since Barack Obama's speech at the convention in Boston.\n\nNow, he's the newly elected senator from Illinois.\n\n>> And he arrives in the Senate, a celebrity, in the way that sort of Hilary Clinton was a celebrity when she arrived.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The Democrats had failed to recapture the White House or the Congress.\n\nObama was their superstar and, to many, their future.\n\n>> He was sort of a person who Democrats were placing their hopes in.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The veterans knew it in their bones.\n\nThey gathered around him.\n\n>> He came to the Senate, almost immediately, with everyone's high expectations, with everyone's assumption that this was a man who was on a fast track.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Former Democratic Senate leader Tom Daschle had lost his bid for reelection.\n\nAs he left, he decided to protect and nurture the party's newest asset.\n\n>> He was looking for staff; I had what I considered to be some of the best staff on the Hill.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Daschle's top aide, Pete Rouse, was so powerful, they called him the \"101st Senator.\"\n\nRouse wanted to retire.\n\nObama courted him.\n\n>> I may be the one person in politics who have never seen his speech at the convention.\n\nI've never seen it.\n\nNever even read it, for that matter, which I probably shouldn't admit to.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama got his man; Rouse signed on.\n\n>> You could tell he had the magic.\n\nWhat he said to me-- \"I know what I'm good at, I know what I'm not good at.\n\nI can give a good speech.\n\nBut I don't have any idea what it's like to get established in the Senate.\"\n\n>> They wanted more than anything else to make him look like a serious senator.\n\nSo, from the very beginning, everything was done with that in mind.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama and his team designed a detailed two-year plan.\n\n>> They put together a two-year plan to put him at the highest possible political peak going into the 2008 election cycle.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The plan called for Obama to avoid controversial issues and slowly raise his profile.\n\n>> We took no out-of-state speaking engagements in the first nine months.\n\nDidn't do any Sunday shows.\n\nHe didn't want to get out there and expose himself to being attacked for being somebody who was more interested in getting headlines than really doing his homework.\n\nSo he had bigger plans than that.\n\nBut he was very aware of the importance of being a team player and not raising people's hackles.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But it was a big challenge to fit into the rigid traditions of the United States Senate.\n\n>> It's a seniority system.\n\nHe was the last person to ask a question on every committee hearing.\n\nSo he would have to sit there for at least two hours before he could be heard.\n\nSo there was no question that he was very much a freshman, no question at all.\n\n>> There was a story that one of his staffers told me.\n\nHe goes in with Obama to the first meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee, which is Obama's big play.\n\nAnd Joe Biden is chairing the meeting.\n\nAnd it's a confirmation hearing for Condoleezza Rice, and so it's kind of a historic moment.\n\nAnd midway through the meeting-- Biden is just going on and on-- Obama scribbles, looking very serious, scribbles a little note on a piece of paper and passes it back to his aide.\n\nAnd the aide's very excited because this is the first communication from Senator Obama.\n\nAnd the note says, \"Shoot.\n\nMe.\n\nNow.\"\n\n-- \"Shoot,\" period, \"Me,\" period, \"Now, \" period.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But there's another side of Obama.\n\n>> He's someone that's long been involved in the nitty-gritty of this stuff.\n\nI don't think that's something that people always realize.\n\nI think the soaring rhetoric, the sort of icon-like image that Obama has attained in this country sometimes blinds us to the fact that he wasn't born onstage in 2004, but he had to rise through the ranks of machine politics in Chicago to get where he is.\n\nAnd that's made him an incredibly effective politician.\n\nChicago is the capital of black America.\n\nThis is the city, within a few miles of each other... >> I'm telling you what the facts are... >>...Louis Farrakhan has his headquarters... >> The honorable Elijah Muhammad took sharp disagreement with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. >> ...Jesse Jackson has his headquarters.\n\n>> America, our time has come.\n\n>> On the south side, Trinity is a big church... >> In a conversation with Christ, even the race issue gets clarified.\n\n>> ...Reverend Wright's church.\n\n>> The culture says, \"Your skin is black\"; the Christ says, \"And so was mine.\"\n\n>> It's the city where Harold Washington was mayor... >> The whole nation is watching as Chicago has sent a powerful message.\n\n>> ...this guy who overcame great odds and lot of racism to lead this city.\n\n>> Our government will be moving forward as well, including more kinds of people than any government in the history of Chicago.\n\n>> It's the capital of black America, and I think that's one of the things that drew Barack Obama to that city.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In 1984, Obama was 23.\n\nHe'd grown up in Hawaii and Indonesia, went to college in California and New York, and now, he was determined to put roots down, to try to be part of the African-American political struggle.\n\n>> \"But at night, lying in bed, I would let the slogans drift away, to be replaced with a series of images, romantic images of a past I had never known.\n\nThey were of the civil rights movement, mostly.\n\nThey told me that I wasn't alone in my particular struggles.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: He would look for a job in Chicago, a meaningful job.\n\n>> \"In 1983, I decided to become a community organizer.\n\nThere wasn't much detail to the idea; I didn't know anyone making a living that way.\n\nWhen classmates in college asked me just what it was that a community organizer did, I couldn't answer them directly.\n\nInstead, I'd pronounce on the need for change: 'Change won't come from the top,' I would say.\n\n'Change will come from a mobilized grass roots.'\"\n\n>> We had put an ad in a number of newspapers for a community organizer in the south side of Chicago, and Barack sent me a resume.\n\nI'm looking for anybody who might be a good organizer, but I particularly need somebody who's African American.\n\n>> You know, one way to put it is Barack Obama's looking for an authentic African-American experience, and Gerry Kellman, the Chicago organizer, is looking for an authentic African American.\n\n>> He was a skinny young man, and in some of the communities he worked, there were a lot of single moms, single grandmothers, and they wanted to take him in and feed him and fatten him up.\n\nHe was an eligible young man.\n\nThey wanted to introduce him to their daughters and to their granddaughters, and he found a home and he was very comfortable here.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But he wasn't always welcome.\n\n>> He had to work with a lot of different church leaders who weren't necessarily receptive to this young guy who came from the Ivy League and did not have Chicago roots.\n\n>> You know, Chicago's a town that says, \"We don't want nobody that nobody sent.\"\n\nWell, Barack was somebody that nobody sent.\n\n>> Blacks, whites... >> NARRATOR: Still, Obama did have a model for how to succeed putting coalitions together: the newly elected mayor, Harold Washington.\n\n>>...have joined hands to form a new Democratic coalition.\n\n>> Harold Washington was surely a phenomenon.\n\nHarold Washington had to be mayor for all the people of Chicago and had to be perceived as somebody who was prepared to be mayor of all the people of Chicago, and not just a mayor for the black community.\n\n>> What Washington was able to do was to put together these coalitions-- African Americans, Latinos and progressive whites.\n\nAnd he was able to pull that together and beat the machine.\n\nAnd that kind of coalition building was incredibly influential for Barack.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama had a small measure of success as an organizer, but he wanted more.\n\n>> After two and half years, he realizes you just can't get very far at community organizing.\n\n>> It, structurally, was not going to change racial discrimination, was not going to change poverty in the United States.\n\nThere simply would not be enough power there.\n\n>> At that point, he begins thinking about, \"Is there some other way to do the same job that I'm trying to do,\" which is lift people out of poverty.\n\n>> He decided he needed to sort of see how politics worked on a sort of higher level than what he had access to as a street organizer in Chicago.\n\nHe needed to go off to law school.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He took out student loans and was accepted at one of the nation's most prestigious law schools: Harvard.\n\n>> We're all precious... >> We're all precious... >> ...in God's sight.\n\n>> ...in God's sight.\n\n>> Everybody... >> Everybody... >> ...is somebody.\n\n>> ...is somebody.\n\n>> The political environment on the law school campus in the late '80s and early '90s was borderline toxic.\n\n>> No more racism.\n\n>> No more racism.\n\n>> No more sexism.\n\n>> Harvard Law School was a very divided institution.\n\n>> There's a lot of mutual animosity surrounding affirmative action.\n\nIt's racially a very charged time.\n\n>> I want women of color in permanent positions.\n\n>> People just did a lot of talking and a lot of fighting.\n\nBy the end, it's like one big unhappy family.\n\n>> ...its first black member... (applause) >> NARRATOR: Barack Obama found himself in the midst of the protests, at one point championing the cause of a black faculty member, Professor Derrick Bell.\n\n>> And I remember him sauntering up to the front and not giving us a lecture, but engaging us in a conversation.\n\n>> He was a very public figure on campus.\n\n>> ...and speaking the truth.\n\n>> Everyone knew who he was.\n\nHe was a very well-respected leader, probably the most well-respected student on campus.\n\n>> ...simply by his good looks and easy charm.\n\n(laughter) >> NARRATOR: In the superheated racial disputes, Obama had become the middleman, a conciliator.\n\n>> He's always been very adept at walking this fine line between two dramatically different worlds, whether it be black and white, liberal and conservative.\n\nHe's just extremely adroit at walking that tightrope.\n\n>> He was raised in a white family, he learned early on, I think, to move back and forth between different communities of people.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The intellectual epicenter of the ideological battles tearing the law school apart was the prestigious \"Harvard Law Review.\"\n\n>> I don't remember any physical violence.\n\nI certainly remember plenty of raised voices.\n\nI've worked at the Supreme Court, I've worked at the White House, I've been in Washington now for almost 20 years, and the bitterest politics I've ever seen in terms of it getting personal and nasty was on the \"Harvard Law Review.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Brad Berensen was a member of the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nOne day, he and his associates would help run the Bush administration.\n\n>> The conservatives on the Harvard Law School campus, at that time, were severely outnumbered.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Inside that toxic environment, Obama's affinity for the Federalist students surprised his black associates.\n\n>> I don't know why at the time he was able to communicate so well with them, even spend social time with them, which was not something I would ever have done.\n\nI don't think he was agenda-driven.\n\nI think he genuinely thought some of these guys are nice, all of them are smart, some of them are funny.\n\nAll of them have something to say.\n\n>> NARRATOR: No African American had ever been president of the \"Law Review.\"\n\nIn his second year, Obama decided to run for it.\n\n>> If being on the \"Law Review\" is a great credential and a high honor, being the president of it is the greatest credential and the greatest honor.\n\n>> The voting for the presidency was an all-day process in which it started out in the day with a lot of candidates, and they got basically voted off the island as the day progressed.\n\n>> One of my most poignant memories of the \"Law Review\" election process was late in the process, it's late at night, we're trying to figure out how to resolve this thing.\n\nClearly, Barack has a lot of support, but it's not resolved yet.\n\nAnd a conservative editor who probably disagreed with just about everything that Barack stood for got up and said that he was firmly behind Barack.\n\nBecause we were a divided institution, this was the best person to lead the institution and to reach out to all constituencies, even though he had his own political views and made them known.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Just after midnight, he won.\n\nIt was national news.\n\n>> Oh, I'm honored.\n\nI think people can say that my election symbolizes some progress, at least within the small confines of the legal community.\n\nI think it's real important to keep the focus on the... the broader world out there and see that, for a lot of kids, the doors that have been open to me aren't open to them.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The African- American editors were ecstatic.\n\n>> I think a lot of the minority editors on the \"Review\" expected him to use his discretion to the maximum extent possible to empower them.\n\n>> There was an expectation on the... on the part of his more progressive colleagues at the \"Law Review\" that he would side with them on issues.\n\n>> Barack was reluctant to do that.\n\nIt's not that he was out of sympathy with their views, but his first and foremost goal, it always seemed to me, was to put out a first-rate publication.\n\nAnd he was not going to let politics or ideology get in the way of doing that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Only one African-American student received a top editor's job; Federalist Society members were given three.\n\n>> A whole Federalist slate was taking over.\n\nI was kind of hoping to get a masthead position, and I did not get a masthead position.\n\nI was hurt.\n\nI think I would call it very hurt.\n\nAnd I told him so.\n\nI mean, certainly, he was aware of how I felt.\n\n>> I think Barack took ten times as much grief from those on the left on the \"Review\" as from those of us on the right.\n\nAnd the reason was, I think there was an expectation among those editors on the left that he would affirmatively use his position to advance the cause.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He would return to Chicago to write a book, to teach law, and to return to the streets.\n\n>> In my mind, there's no doubt he would have ended up with a Supreme Court clerkship.\n\nBut he turned his back on that and saw himself running separate from the pack, even back then.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was in March of 2003 that the country went to war with Iraq.\n\n>> My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world.\n\n>> No one was a bigger supporter of the original decision to go to war in Iraq than John McCain.\n\nHe co-sponsored legislation in the Senate that gave President Bush authority to do it.\n\nHe was somebody from the very beginning, even before President Bush started talking about it.\n\nHe was somebody who talked about the need to take out Saddam Hussein.\n\n>> Victims of sectarian revenge killings are turning up here now every day.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But when things started to go badly in Iraq, McCain broke with the administration.\n\n>> Some 60 city councilors have been killed over the past year.\n\n>> He went in August of '03 to Iraq and came back convinced that if a full insurgency didn't exist at the moment, it was just weeks away.\n\nAsks to see Secretary Rumsfeld, privately spoke to him.\n\n\"You got to completely change the way we're doing things.\"\n\nNo response.\n\nNo response.\n\n>> The relationship really started to get bad, and it wasn't just McCain and Rumsfeld.\n\nYou could almost go through almost any office in the Pentagon-- major office-- and McCain and his staffers were having problems with people there.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain remained a supporter of the war, but continued to complain about the strategy.\n\nThen, in 2004, a real breaking point.\n\n>> Demonstrators gathered outside Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison today.\n\n>> Shocking snapshots that embarrassed the Pentagon and enraged the Muslim world.\n\n>> NARRATOR: When Congress went after the administration, John McCain led the charge.\n\nHe would take on the Secretary of Defense.\n\n>> He was incensed.\n\nHe thought it was shameful.\n\n>> I'm gravely concerned that we risk losing public support for this conflict, as Americans turned away from the Vietnam war... Now, Mr. Secretary, I'd like to know, what were the instructions to the guards?\n\n>> That is what the investigation that I've indicated has been undertaken is determining.\n\n>> Mr. Secretary, that's a very simple, straightforward question.\n\n>> Well... the... well, as Chief of Staff of the Army... >> NARRATOR: McCain would ultimately offer legislation to change American policy about torture.\n\nTorture, of course, had a special meaning to McCain.\n\n>> Want some light?\n\n>> NARRATOR: In 1967, McCain was 31, a prisoner in North Vietnam.\n\n>> In which circumstances have you been shot down?\n\n>> I was on a flight over the city of Hanoi, and I was bombing and was hit.\n\nAnd I ejected and broke my leg and both arms and went into a lake-- parachuted into a lake.\n\n>> ...somehow managed with his teeth to pull the plug that caused his life vest to inflate.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain wrote about it in his autobiography.\n\n>> \"A crowd of several hundred Vietnamese gathered around me as I lay dazed before them, shouting wildly at me, stripping my clothes off, spitting on me, kicking and striking me repeatedly.\"\n\nAnd I was picked up by some North Vietnamese and taken to the hospital, where I almost died.\n\n>> John wouldn't go to sleep.\n\nHe's in a cast, his eyes are feverish.\n\nHe's in bad, bad shape.\n\nI thought he was going to die.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And then, the North Vietnamese discovered McCain was not just any captive.\n\n>> May I know who is your father?\n\nCould you name him and tell me who is... >> Yes, his name is Admiral John McCain.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain's father would soon be in charge of all forces in the South Pacific.\n\n>> Oh, John was a prize.\n\nThey referred to him as \"the prince.\"\n\n\"We've got the prince.\"\n\n>> They realize that they have this exceptional public relations tool, and they say to him, \"Ah-ha, you're the crown prince!\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: \"The prince\" and his father, the Admiral, had never been particularly close.\n\n>> I think it was a relationship of high regard and respect, but I think he didn't see his father as much as he would have liked.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain's grandfather-- they called him \"Popeye\"-- was a legendary admiral in World War II-- here posing with McCain's father on the last day of the war in Japan.\n\nInevitably, reluctantly, John McCain would follow them to the naval academy.\n\n>> \"I was an arrogant, undisciplined, insolent midshipman who felt it necessary to prove my mettle by challenging authority.\"\n\n>> He graduated fifth from the bottom of his class, and he managed to accumulate, as he calls it, a very impressive catalogue of demerits.\n\n>> It's hard to grow up in a family with a military legacy that his family had.\n\nIt goes back to George Washington's general staff.\n\nThat stuff is there, it's like osmosis, so John's got all of this.\n\nThen he gets shot down, and now he's almost dead, and he fights to survive.\n\n>> NARRATOR: John McCain often defied his captors.\n\nHe would be regularly threatened and beaten to force him to confess war crimes.\n\n>> \"The Prick came in with two other guards, lifted me to my feet and gave me the worst beating I had yet experienced.\n\nThey left me lying on the floor, moaning from the stabbing pain in my refractured arm.\"\n\n>> There was the sheer pain of it, and the deprivation and the humiliation.\n\nIt's a horrible experience.\n\nWe had to endure it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for five, six, seven, eight, nine years.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At one point, McCain was offered an early release, a propaganda move to embarrass his father.\n\n>> \"No way.\n\nCan't do that.\n\nHonor won't let me do that.\n\nSense of duty won't let me do that.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: It meant he would be in prison for five more years.\n\n>> If you have anything to say to the people you love and the people who loves you, please tell it now.\n\nThis time is yours.\n\n>> I would just like to tell my wife I'll...\n\nI'll get well, and I love her and hope to see her soon.\n\nAnd I'd appreciate it if you tell her that.\n\nThat's all I have.\n\n>> We today have concluded an agreement to end thewar... >> NARRATOR: He came home angry about why America had lost the Vietnam War, and he spent the next year at the National War College trying to find out why.\n\n>> \"The experience did not cause me to conclude that the war was wrong.\n\nBut I did resent how badly civilian leaders had mismanaged the war and how ineffectually our senior military commanders had resisted their mistakes.\"\n\n>> A core group of us, we said, \"If we ever get out of this place, we've got to do everything we can to be involved in the political process so we never repeat this kind of conduct again, where we get involved in something that we probably don't understand, noble cause or not.\n\nIf we don't understand it and if we aren't committed to victory, then we shouldn't get involved in it.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: His body was badly damaged.\n\nActive duty was challenging.\n\nThe navy decided on a different kind of posting.\n\nHe was a war hero, celebrity, and so they put him right out front with the politicians.\n\n>> When members of Congress travel, they usually have a captain or colonel as escort officer, and John was our escort officer on several trips.\n\n>> He was just fun to be with.\n\nAnd he had a sense of derring-do and \"Let's go do some things.\"\n\n\"Let's hop on a plane, let's go to such and such a country.\"\n\n>> Rather quickly, he becomes friends with some of the younger senators-- Gary Hart, Bill Cohen, later Secretary of Defense.\n\n>> We would hit a couple of bars and have some beers together.\n\nIt was mostly three relatively young guys who were having a good time together.\n\n>> NARRATOR: After a while, he began to get interested in a political career.\n\n>> We talked about politics, but more from a practical point of view.\n\nHow do you do you get elected?\n\nWhat kind of campaigns?\n\nSo it was clear he was learning.\n\n>> He's a bright, sharp guy.\n\nAnd I'm sure he looked around and said, \"Boy, if these guys can do this, I can do this.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: But McCain's personal life was a mess; his wife Carol had dutifully waited through the P.O.W.\n\nyears.\n\nA former model, she'd been severely injured in a car accident while McCain was in Vietnam.\n\nNow, McCain wanted a divorce.\n\n>> My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war.\n\nThe blame was entirely mine.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He was known to have an eye for women and a taste for the good life.\n\nOne night in Hawaii, he found what he was looking for.\n\n>> It was love at first sight, and that was it.\n\nHe said, \"I met a gal that you've just got to meet.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"I think this is... this is the gal I'm in love with.\"\n\nThat was it.\n\n>> Bill Cohen and I were members of his wedding party when he and Cindy were married in Arizona.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cindy's father owned a lucrative beer distributorship in Arizona.\n\nHe was rich and connected.\n\nSoon, John McCain would be, too.\n\n>> For me, it was natural, saying, \"You're in love with this young woman from Arizona.\n\nYou're a conservative.\n\nArizona's a conservative state.\n\nGo run in Arizona.\n\nYou'll have family there, and that will be the basis, where you'll start.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: In 1982, he ran for Congress and won.\n\nThen, four years later, he would take Barry Goldwater's seat in the Senate.\n\n>> NARRATOR: 2006.\n\nFor a year, Barack Obama had kept his head down.\n\nNow, it was time for year two of his plan to kick in.\n\nHe would ramp up his visibility.\n\n>> In 2006, he had a different strategy in his second year, and that was to be helpful to other Democrats.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The Senator from Illinois had national ambitions.\n\n>> This was part of the plan, was to go out and...\n\nI guess crassly say, \"build IOUs.\"\n\n>> And how better to sort of get the support from people in the Senate than to help them?\n\n(applause) >> It is a battle about education, it is a battle about health care, it is a battle about energy... >> NARRATOR: And he would use the speaking engagements as an opportunity to hone his political message.\n\n>> This is the wrong war at the wrong time.\n\nEvery child is my child, every senior citizen deserves protection.\n\nGovernment can help.\n\nThe government can make a difference in all of our lives.\n\n>> Everywhere he went, crowds were huge and enthusiastic, record crowds at all these fundraising events.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As the crowds grew, Obama and his advisors began to seriously consider whether the time was right for a presidential run.\n\n>> I think Obama had a lot of questions and a lot of skepticism about it, and wanted to approach the whole process in a methodical way.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama often relied on the advice of political wise men; one of them was former Democratic leader Tom Daschle.\n\n>> We went to my favorite restaurant and took the kitchen table in the back where nobody could see us.\n\nWell, I tell him he should do it and that he shouldn't assume, if he passes up this window, that there will be another.\n\nBecause the longer he's in Washington, the more history he has.\n\nAnd the more history he has, the more he's going to be explaining his votes and his actions and his statements and his positions that undermine his message.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Then, Obama gathered his closest friends and advisors.\n\n>> He asked us to challenge him on what he would face in running for President, to really ask the tough questions.\n\n>> And some of the most skeptical people about making this race were some of his very accomplished, successful African-American friends.\n\nAnd I remember one saying... one person saying that, \"You know, I just don't think America's ready, you know, to elect an African American.\"\n\nI remember Barack's immediate reaction was, \"I don't agree with that, and I think they are ready.\n\nBut if they're not, they're not going to be ready in my lifetime.\n\nSo I'm willing to challenge that assumption.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama had been challenging political assumptions for some time.\n\nHis first race offers an example: an older, experienced state senator, Alice Palmer, in effect, offered young Barack Obama her state senate seat.\n\n>> Alice Palmer had decided she was going to run for a congressional seat that had suddenly become open.\n\n>> She gets crushed by Jesse Jackson, Jr. >> Came back to Barack with the hope and expectation that he would drop out in deference to her.\n\nHe declined to do so.\n\n>> A delegation on behalf of Alice Palmer, including some very august figures from the south side of Chicago, came to him and asked him to step out of the way and let her, you know, run again for her seat.\n\n>> So here's Barack Obama.\n\nHe's not from Chicago.\n\nHe's desperately trying to break into politics, and he's being approached by some of the elder African-American leaders of the community, people who've been around a whole lot longer than he has.\n\nPeople telling him, \"Your time will come, just back down.\n\nJust cede this seat to Alice.\n\nShe's the only reason you're in this race anyway.\n\nYou owe her.\"\n\n>> Barack wasn't thrilled about it.\n\n\"I've gone out and raised money, opened up an office, recruited people, put my name out there.\n\nAnd I'm supposed to take that back because you now want to change the agreement we already had?\n\nThat just doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\n\n>> His behavior was political in Chicago style.\n\nHe did what Chicago politicians do; he challenged her petitions.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama played hardball.\n\nThe signatures on Palmer's hastily assembled election petitions would be compared to the actual voter registry.\n\n>> So I went down to his office and looked at petitions and, late into the night, checked them against the key book and did what I had to do.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And while they were at it, Obama checked his other opponents, too.\n\n>> Not just Alice Palmer, but all of Obama's opponents are knocked off the ballot, and Obama wins his first election without an opponent.\n\nThat's a pretty good way to win.\n\nSome of his sort of idealistic message of hope has confused people to his sort of inner toughness, you know, the velvet glove around the steel fist.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In 2000, Obama set his sights on a Congressional seat-- but not just any Congressional seat.\n\nThis one was held by yet another older, highly regarded figure in the black community: Congressman Bobby Rush.\n\n>> Bobby Rush has real strong roots in the community.\n\nBobby Rush was, you know, a Panther.\n\nHis friends, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, were killed.\n\nBobby would've been killed.\n\nHe was not there that night, but he emerged out of that fight, out of that season, as a kind of tough street guy.\n\nAnd then he matured as a Congressman into a guy that took that toughness and broadly applied that.\n\nSo Bobby Rush had very real strength in the community.\n\n>> What has he done?\n\n(talking over each other) >> NARRATOR: To compete with Rush, Obama tried to reach a new generation of voters in the predominantly black district.\n\n>> Who can best articulate and frame the issues that are most important to voters in the district?\n\n>> It was very much this theme of unity.\n\n\"We can all get along with one another.\n\nWe should help the most... the most vulnerable in our society.\n\nWe need to rebuild our communities from the ground up.\"\n\n>> I think what Barack's strategy is is to emphasize the common challenges that black and white Americans face.\n\n>> I know that you are a wise man and you seem very astute on the issue, but... >> NARRATOR: But in Bobby Rush's district, they publicly questioned whether Obama had enough experience and privately wondered whether he was black enough.\n\n>> ... African-American ministers have endorsed me based on my record.\n\n>> How dedicated is he to the black struggle?\n\n>> He was fighting off these \"Is he black enough?\"\n\ncharges.\n\n>> That's always been a subtext of the opposition to him from other black politicians.\n\n>> They looked at him with a little apprehension.\n\n>> All of these things come back in the Bobby Rush campaign, and they come back in a very nasty way.\n\n>> The charges of elitism.\n\nHere's this Harvard guy with well-modulated eloquence.\n\nWhat does he know about the black struggle?\n\n>> There's a long article about the race in the \"Chicago Reader,\" the local alternative paper in Chicago, where one of Obama's opponents, he says, \"Obama is viewed as the white man in blackface in our community.\"\n\n>> It got bad.\n\nIt was real bad.\n\nA number of Black Nationalists and other observers in the African-American community, you know, made all sorts of allegations about Barack being a tool of, you know, Hyde Park and the University of Chicago, which are both code words for both whites and Jews.\n\n>> It wouldn't be the first time that someone had called him not black enough.\n\nI think what was probably surprising for him was how much traction it got and how effective it was against him in that particular circumstance.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He believed he'd already put down roots in Chicago's black community.\n\nHe lived in the district, worked on civil rights cases, and perhaps most importantly, he'd fallen in love with and married a woman from the neighborhood.\n\n>> Her roots in Chicago went deeper than his roots in Chicago.\n\nShe comes from a middle class working family with working family values and strong church values.\n\nShe went to public school, and she and my daughter were classmates, they were friends, and so she has roots there.\n\nAnd so, she would know people he did not know, and know places he would not know.\n\n>> That alliance gave him a kind of rootedness in that community that he really didn't have because of the relative rootlessness of his childhood and upbringing.\n\n>> \"For someone like me, who had barely known his father, who had spent much of his life traveling from place to place, his bloodlines scattered to the four winds, the home that Fraiser and Marian Robinson had built for themselves stirred a longing for stability-- a sense of place-- that I had not realized was there.\"\n\n>> It was a very important personal connection.\n\nIn Michelle, he found a partner who was able to ground him personally.\n\nThe fact that-- that she was so rooted in the community was-- had obvious value.\n\nBut, you know, it was very personal.\n\n>> NARRATOR: There was, inside black Chicago, another place Barack Obama wanted to put down roots: the church.\n\n>> Obama was very sort of meticulous about going to the various pastors, interviewing them, talking to them about their churches and their reputations.\n\nSo, he was... he was on a sort of quest to find a church home.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama settled on Trinity Church.\n\n>> It's a big, popular inner-city church that was known for its community work.\n\n>> It probably gathers the most members of Chicago's black elite.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Trinity was led by Reverend Jeremiah Wright.\n\n>> Reverend Wright is a very profound preacher, very scholarly, very popular in the church circles.\n\n>> Apartheid is wrong!\n\nOppression is wrong!\n\nAnybody who feels white skin is superior to black skin is wrong!\n\n>> He had the reputation of a militant guy who could provide kind of a vicarious militance for a lot of Chicago's black elite, so they could get a dose of militance on Sunday and then go back home and feel pretty good about doing their part for the black movement.\n\n>> NARRATOR: So membership in Trinity might have been good for Obama personally and even politically-- but it didn't help on election day against Bobby Rush.\n\n>> The last week of the campaign Bill Clinton did radio spots for him on black radio.\n\n>> I'm President Clinton, urging you to send Bobby Rush back to Congress where he can continue his fight to prepare our children for the 21st Century.\n\n>> It was hopeless.\n\n>> ...and America need Bobby Rush in Congress.\n\n>> We lost badly-- two to one.\n\nI was the deputy campaign manager and the field director in that race and we lost badly.\n\n>> It was the first time in his life where people didn't just really accept him immediately, where things didn't really go perfectly for him.\n\n>> The Bobby Rush defeat helped him understand that his natural constituency were not these working class African Americans with nationalist aspirations, but rather with progressive whites, progressive African Americans, those who had a wider view of what politics was all about.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama would pursue that coalition in 2004, when the state senator decided to try to become the United States senator.\n\n>> Obama was a little bit too much of a lone wolf in the 2000 campaign.\n\nHe didn't have enough support, had sort of gotten into the race without thinking it through, which is uncharacteristic for Obama.\n\nAnd as he plotted his next political campaign, he avoided all the mistakes of that 2000 race.\n\n>> If there's a child on the south side of Chicago that can't read, that makes a difference in my life, even if it's not my child.\n\n>> NARRATOR: This is the time he signed up David Axelrod.\n\n>> If there is an Arab-American somewhere getting rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties, even if I'm not an immigrant.\n\n>> He had a political story to tell, and Axelrod knew how to pick out the various aspects of that story and really sell them to voters.\n\n>> I worked on the south side of Chicago with a group of churches that had come together to try... >> His community organizing days went over extraordinarily well with blacks.\n\nHis time at Harvard... >> ...had never led the \"Harvard Law Review\" until I changed that.\n\n>> ...suddenly whites are like, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThey're very accepting of him.\n\n>> I'm Barack Obama.\n\nI'm running for the United States Senate, and I approve this message to say, \"Yes, we can.\"\n\n>> That television campaign really sold voters on the story of Barack Obama.\n\n(applause) >> Yes, we can.\n\nThank you, Illinois.\n\nI love you!\n\n>> NARRATOR: And so, just four years after his loss to Bobby Rush, Obama put together that special coalition and a victory.\n\n>> At the victory party for his election, it looked like a replay of Harold Washington's mayoral victory party.\n\nIt really did.\n\nI mean, there were black people there who were ecstatic about the rise of this young brother.\n\nAnd a range of white supporters, primarily these progressives who supported Harold Washington.\n\nIt was extraordinary, really, the way that the crowds echoed each other.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Two years later, in 2006, as a United States senator, Obama had to decide whether he could put together an even bigger coalition to run for the presidency.\n\n>> He went off to Hawaii at the end of 2006 with his family thought hard about it and came back and said, \"I think I want to do this.\"\n\n(cheers) >> NARRATOR: It was 16 degrees on the cold February day when Barack Obama announced his candidacy.\n\n>> Obama's scheduled to deliver this big event in Springfield.\n\nAnd that was going to be Springfield, home of Abe Lincoln, it's like a big deal for the campaign.\n\n>> Oh, praise and honor to God for bringing us together here today.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They had even invited his minister from Trinity Church, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, to deliver the invocation.\n\nBut there was a problem-- a story in \"Rolling Stone\" quoted some of the pastor's fiery sermons.\n\n>> \"Racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run!\"\n\n>> His advisors knew that Wright was a big problem; that if people went back and mined what he had said, if they looked at Obama and looked at Wright in their relationship, that it could change the impression that people had of Obama.\n\n>> What Axelrod told me later is that the campaign became worried that Fox News would blast these quotes from Obama's crazy pastor.\n\nSo they yanked Wright.\n\nThey basically told him that he couldn't be part of this event, and Wright got very mad.\n\n>> I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America.\n\n>> On that cold, cold morning, not to have Reverend Wright give the invocation was certainly a sign that they knew there was some problem brewing.\n\nI think the question was, how big a problem was it?\n\nHow could they deal with it if it erupted?\n\nAnd could they just kind of keep it in the back?\n\n>> Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nLet's get to work!\n\nI love you.\n\nThank you.\n\n>> NARRATOR: This building has been the site of many scandals-- careers broken, lives altered.\n\nSuch a moment happened to John McCain back in 1989.\n\n>> He understands, and he will admit that when his obituary is written, the Keating scandal will be somewhere high in the obituary.\n\nAnd so, he understands the dark stain that that had on his career.\n\nHe understands that.\n\n>> Never before have five senators been accused of intervening with federal regulators.\n\n>> The Keating Five.\n\nFour Democratic senators, one Republican.\n\n>> This man is a United States senator, and you are about to hear him say something that very few senators have ever said before.\n\nListen, carefully.\n\n>> It was a very serious mistake on my part.\n\nThe appearance of a meeting with five senators was bad and wrong, and I agonize over it all the time.\n\n>> Here's John McCain, he's doing great in the Senate.\n\nHe's starting to get national recognition and prominence.\n\nPeople are starting to put him on the list of possible vice-presidential running mates.\n\nEverything is going great.\n\nAnd then, bam, this scandal hits.\n\nAnd even by today's standards, it was a big scandal involving five very important members of the United States Senate.\n\n>> Four of the best known names in the U.S. Senate pressured a government regulator... >> Today's testimony may just be the beginning in a scandal that seems to grow wider with each public hearing.\n\n>> That scandal took off pretty quickly, and it was like a tsunami.\n\n>> Now the procedure will be as follows: Senator McCain and he and his lawyer will appear first... >> NARRATOR: At the center of the scandal was McCain's friend and contributor, Charles Keating, an Arizona high roller and owner of a failed savings and loan.\n\n>> In 1987, Keating was engaged in a war the with federal regulators who were on his case, who looked at his investment portfolio, examined his books and were astonished and alarmed and horrified at the way he was throwing around his money, which were federally-insured deposits.\n\n>> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony that you will give in this hearing will be the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\n>> I do.\n\n>> And Keating, having donated more than $1 million to these five Senators who became known as the Keating Five, called upon them and asked them to intervene with the regulators on his behalf.\n\n>> On April 2, I attended a meeting in Senator Deconcini's office to inquire whether American Continental Corporation and Lincoln Savings were being treated fairly.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain and the other senators met with the top federal regulator... >> They were United States Senators who oversaw our agency.\n\nYou know, I considered Senators pretty important, especially a lot of them at one time.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The FBI dug into the case, Congress began an investigation, the press had a field day.\n\nMcCain desperately wanted to clear his name.\n\nHe decided straight talk was called for.\n\n>> And he says, \"So from this day forward,\" he says, \"we're going to take every interview we can take.\n\nWe're going to prioritize Arizona media over national media, but we'll do them all.\"\n\n>> Yes, mistakes were made.\n\nYes, the appearance of five senators in one meeting is... poor, to say the least.\n\nBut to translate that into improper behavior or abuse of office is simply something that I don't believe the that people of Arizona would do.\n\n>> This was the beginning of a pattern that he has developed at a moment of crisis.\n\nHe'll stand there until the last reporter sits down.\n\nAnd I think it's worked very well for him.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The press backed off, and the Congress all but cleared him of wrongdoing.\n\n>> Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific rule of the United States Senate.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They said he was guilty of poor judgment.\n\n>> He wasn't corrupted in the sense of abusing his office.\n\nI think you could say that he was compromised in the same way that all politicians who develop buddy-buddy relationships with powerful businessmen who bankroll their campaigns are.\n\nBecause I think inevitably there's a certain reciprocity that's expected.\n\n>> Most people said, after having gone through what he went through in the Keating Five, \"That's it.\n\nHis chances of any national office are over, are done with.\n\nAnd by the way, he's probably not going to be very successful in the United States Senate.\"\n\nHe proved them wrong.\n\nHis life has been proving people wrong.\n\n>> To the surprise of nearly no one, John McCain has officially made it not quite official.\n\n>> The Arizona Senator John McCain moved a step closer to making his candidacy official.\n\n>> Yesterday, the early frontrunner for the Republican nomination filed some papers, and that's all John McCain has to do to make news.\n\n>> NARRATOR: By 2007, John McCain, long past the Keating Five scandal, was busy positioning himself as the Republican frontrunner for the presidency.\n\n>> He wanted to be the establishment candidate, the vision that the Republicans always nominate the next guy in line-- George H .W.\n\nBush in '88, Robert Dole in '96, Reagan in '80.\n\nHe wanted to be that guy.\n\n>> He wanted to be, for the first time, an elder statesman, someone who was inheriting the mantle of the Republican party.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But McCain had made some important enemies inside the Republican base.\n\nBack in 2000, running against George W. Bush, McCain incurred the wrath of the religious right.\n\n>> They aligned themselves with Bush and allowed their organizations to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, particularly in South Carolina, against McCain.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At this town hall meeting, McCain let them have it.\n\n>> Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the right.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> McCain had called leaders of the Christian Right \"Agents of Intolerance.\"\n\nThis was a phrase never forgotten.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But six years later, McCain changed course in a meeting with evangelical minister Jerry Falwell.\n\n>> Reverend Falwell came to see him, said, you know, \"Put our past differences behind us, or acrimony behind us\" or something.\n\nAnd then asked him on the spot if he would consider giving the commencement address at Liberty.\n\nAnd he responded on the spot, \"Sure.\"\n\n>> Senator!\n\nI heard this crazy story that Senator John McCain is giving the commencement address at Jerry Falwell's University.\n\n>> Well, before I bring on my two attorneys, I'd like to... (laughter and applause) >> Don't make me love you!\n\n>> It cut against, you know, everything that McCain had done and said up to that point.\n\n>> Why I did it is because of the fact that my kids said, \"Why haven't you been on the Jon Stewart show lately?\"\n\nAnd I figured that was the best way to do that.\n\n>> Senator!\n\n>> John McCain is a politician.\n\nHe's been elected to the Senate.\n\nHe's involved in politics.\n\nHe understands that yesterday's battles are yesterday's battles.\n\nAnd if you're going to win tomorrow's, you may have to do things differently.\n\n>> So are you freaking out on us?\n\nBecause if you're freaking out and you're going into the crazy base world... Are you going into crazy base world?\n\n>> I'm afraid...\n\nI'm afraid so.\n\n>> McCain has demonstrated both a temperamental inclination and a real ability over the course of his political life to... to do things that are politically expedient and at the same time signal with a sense of irony and detachment that he doesn't really like doing it; that, in a sense, he's being forced by political necessity to do it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He did it again with the announcement of his candidacy.\n\nInstead of a traditional setting, McCain chose a different venue.\n\n>> Are you thinking seriously of running?\n\nAre you running?\n\nAre you going to announce that you are running?\n\n>> You asked me if I would come back on this show... >> Right?\n\n>> ...if I was going to announce.\n\nI am announcing that I will be a candidate for president of the United States.\n\n>> Oh.\n\n(cheers and applause) (band playing) >> Good for you.\n\nWow.\n\nSeems to be a very popular announcement.\n\n>> Paul, can we try that again?\n\n♪ Da-Da-da-da... ♪ (\"Hail to the Chief\" is played) >> The struggle for John McCain's heart and soul is the part of the story of the last eight years.\n\n>> How about that!\n\n>> John McCain sees himself as a maverick and has always operated in that way.\n\nAt the same time, he is determined, and has been determined for the last four years, to become the nominee of the Republican Party.\n\nThat requires a set of trade-offs.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He would have to position himself as the heir apparent to George W. Bush.\n\nOn issue after issue, McCain moved closer to the party faithful, becoming an outspoken advocate for the president's controversial plan to change Social Security.\n\nOnce an opponent of the president's tax cuts, McCain voted to extend them.\n\nOn torture, he agreed with the administration's plan to limit the rights of detainees.\n\nAnd he agreed with the Vice President that the CIA could use tougher interrogation techniques than the military.\n\nHe even copied Bush's huge and expensive re-election campaign of 2004.\n\nThe bare-bones \"Straight Talk Express,\" McCain's famous bus from 2000, was transformed.\n\n>> It was a huge, expensive bus with leather seats and flat'screen televisions.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The bus cost $10,000 a day.\n\n>> They very much believed that in order to win, he had to sort of be like George Bush.\n\nAnd they drew up this $150 million campaign plan that very much looked a lot like the George Bush model and machine.\n\n>> It was a frontrunner's campaign, a big, well-funded frontrunner's campaign, and one that depended on the prospect of inevitability rather than fighting, underdog, maverick, anti-establishment.\n\nIt was not a very good fit for him, and it crashed and burned.\n\n>> We had a budget that was based on being the preemptive favorite.\n\nWe assumed things that did not happen.\n\nWe hit a wall.\n\n(laughs) We hit a wall.\n\n>> People who had made pledges wouldn't go through with them.\n\nAnd so, the McCain campaign realizes all estimates that we have of the amount of money we're going to have are completely wrong.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The smart money was on the sidelines, watching Guiliani and Romney.\n\nMcCain's high end campaign was going bust.\n\n>> His obituary was being written every day in about ten different ways.\n\nEvery talk show, every newspaper had written John off.\n\nWe were fifth in a four-person race, you know?\n\nHad them right where we want them, right?\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain asked one of his oldest friends, former POW Orson Swindle, to take a hard look at the campaign's management.\n\n>> When things started to go awry, he asked me, \"Go over there and sit in on the meetings and tell me what you think.\"\n\nAnd, you know, I did that for a week or two.\n\nAnd he said, \"What do you think?\"\n\nI said, \"It's a bleeping mess.\"\n\n(laughs) >> NARRATOR: McCain's team had locked up much of the high-priced consulting talent and created offices all across the country, trying to scare off potential opponents.\n\n>> The spending was out of control.\n\nThat there was, you know, there were sort of different power centers in the campaign.\n\nNo clear lines of authority.\n\nJust, you know, it had the feel of a campaign that was in free fall.\n\n>> There was no clear chain of command.\n\nThe finance division totally separate from the political division.\n\nNo one knew how much money we were raising, so we couldn't match... spending with that.\n\n>> The money has just vanished.\n\n$24 million is gone.\n\nThere's a staff of 150 that can't be paid.\n\nPeople are just laid off, fired.\n\n>> He's not used to having hundreds and thousands of people around him in this huge bureaucracy, and it didn't work.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nAnd one of the legitimate questions people raised during the primary process was, \"Look, if he can't manage this campaign better than they have-- think about all the money that they had that went down the drain-- if they can't manage the campaign better, how's he going to run the United States?\n\n>> The big news is about John McCain.\n\nHe's spent every penny he raised and more.\n\n>> His campaign piggy bank has been hemorrhaging money.\n\n>> Out of money, sinking in the polls and hemorrhaging staff.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was a wake-up call for McCain.\n\nEmbarrassed and angry, he decided to clean house.\n\nJohn Weaver would have to go.\n\n>> To lose John Weaver is to lose, for McCain, his right arm.\n\n>> McCain did the hardest thing in the world to do, is he pulled the trigger on some people who'd been around him, you know, most of his political life.\n\nA pretty tough thing to do.\n\n>> The night before I resigned, we had a wonderful conversation.\n\nAnd I told him I loved him and that we didn't want to...\n\nI didn't want to argue with him any more about these... all these various issues that we had been arguing about.\n\nAnd... and it didn't take me more than a nanosecond to know what I needed to do.\n\n>> I think John McCain, more than anything, is embarrassed.\n\nAnd I say that because I believe that McCain saw that campaign come undone and said to himself, \"I should have known more about this.\n\nI should have taken a more active role in it.\n\nI have failed in some fundamental way as a leader.\"\n\nAnd I think he was embarrassed at the state of his campaign and the state of his candidacy.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCain headed for his ranch in Arizona.\n\nHe'd worry about the future with a small group of loyalists.\n\n>> Literally, the plan was the Merle Haggard Strategy.\n\nMerle Haggard has a great song called \"If We Make It Through December, Every Thing's Going To Be All Right, I Know.\"\n\n>> ♪ If we make it through December ♪ Everything's going to be all right, I know... ♪ >> And that was just it.\n\nIt was as simple as just, let's just make sure we're on the field in the fourth quarter when the game gets decided.\n\n>> He got everybody in a room and said, \"Here's the deal.\n\nWe're going to run this campaign on a million dollars if I have to.\"\n\nYou know, \"If I have to take a cab, I'm going to take a cab.\n\nIf I have to fly coach, we're going to fly coach.\"\n\n>> The fancy bus is gone.\n\nThe charter planes are gone.\n\nLiterally, overnight, became a campaign that was on a shoestring budget for months.\n\n>> You know, packs an overnight bag and boards a discount airline and flies up to New Hampshire by himself.\n\nHe's the campaign.\n\nHe's met by an aide with a family car.\n\nAnd they decide they're... they're going to live off the land and just... just focus all their efforts on New Hampshire.\n\n>> You know, we've always known that to survive what he did in Vietnam, in that prisoner of war camp, takes an extraordinary human being.\n\nThis is a guy who is willing to do what is necessary when he thinks he has to do it in order to survive and keep going.\n\n>> Today, Iowans make the first decisions that will count.\n\n>> NARRATOR: If Barack Obama wanted to be president, there would be no more difficult time and place than Iowa in 2008.\n\n>> Who is going to get out the vote... >> The Obama campaign had to win Iowa.\n\nIf we won Iowa, it would give us life, it would give us an opportunity to compete elsewhere.\n\n>> NARRATOR: There were seven other candidates in the race, but one everyone knew he had to beat.\n\nThe best political brand in the Democratic party: Hillary Clinton.\n\n>> In those first early days, it was very hard to see how she wasn't going to be the nominee.\n\n>> She had the money, she had most of the party, and for what it was worth-- and I think it was worth a good deal in certain precincts-- she was a Clinton.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Clinton would run on her experience, but Obama had devised a different strategy.\n\n>> The premise of this campaign is that people want a different way of doing things in Washington.\n\nThey want to turn the page.\n\nThey want to change.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And Obama had a ready-made issue for one important constituency: the anti-war movement.\n\n>> The point of entry for them was his position on Iraq, the fact that he had good judgement on... on that decision which was pretty significant.\n\n>> I don't oppose war in all circumstances and when I look out over this crowd today, I know there is no shortage of patriots or patriotism.\n\nWhat I do oppose is a dumb war!\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was a speech he had made as an Illinois state senator at a small anti-war rally in Chicago, but now it would play to his advantage.\n\n>> He set himself out against the war, from the very beginning, while other candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, you know, these folks had to combat their votes on that.\n\n>> The time for us to ask how we were going to get out of Iraq was before we went in, and that is something too many of us failed to do.\n\nWe failed to do it, and I do think that that is something that both Democrats and Republicans have to take responsibility for.\n\n>> That anti-Iraq war speech that he gave in 2002 was the gift that just kept on giving for him.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama's plan in Iowa was to mobilize his coalition of anti-war voters, young people and progressives.\n\n>> It was his vision to run a campaign that was a grass-roots organizing campaign, very much influenced by his community organizing experience.\n\n>> The organization of the Obama people you talk to on the ground was surprisingly impressive and actually better than Hillary Clinton's was.\n\nFor all the campaigns the Clintons had run, for all the talent they had locked up early in the campaign, he was beating her in the operational aspects of the campaign in Iowa.\n\nThis was a guy who was running a really professional, lock-down campaign operation.\n\nAnd that... that indicated to me that he was not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> NARRATOR: The war, the grass- roots, the yearning for change yielded huge crowds.\n\n>> And because somebody stood up, a few more stood up, and then a few thousands stood up and then a few million stood up.\n\nIowa, I need you to stand up!\n\n>> Obama in Iowa was pretty extraordinary.\n\nI mean, I've witnessed some pretty cool things in politics.\n\nEvery four years there's something, but Obama really had something going, you know, in Iowa.\n\nIt was clear, because the size of those crowds, he was packing thousands of people into really impressive venues.\n\n>> We will win this election, we will change the course of history, and the real journey to heal the nation and repair the world will have truly have begun.\n\nThank you, Iowa!\n\n>> But I think Barack Obama gave something new.\n\nHe inspired people.\n\nHillary Clinton is a worker, and she understands the process and she can get in there and know how to pass a bill.\n\nBut Barack Obama's a poet.\n\nAnd I think a lot of people-- especially a lot of younger voters-- were sort of looking for a poet.\n\n>> We are at a defining moment in our history.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama was doing something else in Iowa: devising a strategy to prove he could win with a majority of white votes.\n\nIn fact, he had intentionally not courted blacks.\n\n>> There was a perception that an African American candidate could do well with African American voters, but not much beyond that.\n\nAnd so Iowa turned out to be the real litmus test.\n\nDid he have the capacity to draw votes from other demographic groups?\n\n>> If white people would vote for a black candidate in a mainly white state, it said \"this guy really has a chance.\"\n\nThis is not playing anymore, this is not Jesse.\n\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?\n\n>> NARRATOR: By the day of the caucuses, it was not clear the Obama organization could overcome the Clinton machine.\n\nIt was all on the line.\n\n>> We start to initially get sort of turn out reports.\n\nVery anecdotal.\n\nThe lines are out the door.\n\n>> Nobody foresaw 239,000 people participating in the Iowa Caucuses.\n\nSo when 239,000 people came out, like, you know, they just blew the doors off every assumption about the campaign.\n\n>> The front-runners lost their footing on the Iowa ice and suddenly the entire presidential race seems a little slippery.\n\n>> New voters were especially key for Barack Obama, who got the youth vote.\n\n>> The results of the Iowa caucuses are in.\n\nBarack Obama won the Democratic caucuses... >> And Hillary Clinton's potential coronation crashed into a third-place finish with 29%... >> NARRATOR: His victory in a state that was 90% white, sent a message to a potential constituency that hadn't fully gotten behind him... >> All of a sudden, people woke up and said, \"My God, maybe it can happen.\"\n\nThat's what happened.\n\nIt was like a jolt of electricity going through the entirety of the black community.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But Obama's message went beyond race.\n\n>> Barack Obama told a different story than anyone had ever told as a presidential candidate.\n\nIt is a post-historical, post- racial, post-modern, and it fits not just his biography, not just his style of rhetoric, but the vision he has for America.\n\n>> All right, everybody.\n\nIt was good to see you.\n\nWe had a good night.\n\nMy throat is hoarse but my spirits are good.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama then ran into a formidable obstacle: the Bill and Hillary Clinton political machine.\n\n>> This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They would engage Obama in a long and bloody battle in one primary state after another.\n\n>> Give me a break!\n\n>> At this point, Bill Clinton is not simply a surrogate, he's kind of a separate force within the campaign.\n\n>> Not everyone is comfortable with Bill Clinton's role as the aggressor... >> His job this time as designated hitter for his wife, attacking Barack Obama so she doesn't have to... >> He has been the attack dog for this campaign.\n\n>> This is what she wants him to do, this is a strategy... >> She will be a great president.\n\n>> I think that there were some times when Barack thought of it as being Bill Clinton versus Barack Obama.\n\nYou know, I think it definitely felt that way.\n\nPresident Clinton was a presence, a significant presence.\n\n>> I believe she is the best candidate for president... >> NARRATOR: It seemed Obama now had two opponents.\n\n>> You talked about Ronald Reagan being a transformative political leader, I did not mention his name.\n\n>> Your husband did.\n\n>> Well, I'm here, he's not.\n\n>> Okay, well, I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.\n\n>> They really went at each other in a way they hadn't.\n\n>> ...committed spouses who stand up for us and I'm proud of that.\n\n>> So the whole atmosphere was, you know, rife with tension.\n\n>> Wait, Hillary, you just spoke for two minutes.\n\n>> I did not say anything about Ronald Reagan.\n\nYou said two things.\n\nYou talked about admiring Ronald Reagan.\n\n>> Iowa?\n\nThat was so yesterday.\n\nWith the caucuses behind them, the presidential candidates hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire today.\n\n>> Turnout is expected to be very high as voters choose.\n\n>> NARRATOR: John McCain had not really competed in Iowa, he had bet everything on New Hampshire.\n\n>> I actually think he felt somewhat liberated.\n\n\"What the heck, you know?\n\nI mean, we have no money.\n\nWe have no money, you know, everybody has counted us out.\n\nWell, I'm going to do what I can do and either I will win or I won't.\"\n\n>> My friends I'd like to get right to it with a few of the issues... >> NARRATOR: McCain decided straight talk was the way to go.\n\n>> ...what town meetings are all about... >> NARRATOR: And he'd do it in as many town halls as he could.\n\n>> He was a different candidate, he was almost free, it was almost like chains were off of him.\n\nWe went to some VFW somewhere.\n\nThere were 12 guys showed up.\n\nThe average age was 90.\n\nAnd they couldn't hear a word he was saying hardly.\n\nI'm sitting there and I'm beginning to laugh, because these are wonderful old guys.\n\n\"What'd he say?\"\n\nAnd, but they were got bits and pieces.\n\nAnd they stood up or tried to at the appropriate times and cheer.\n\nAnd I said, \"John, here's the good news, buddy.\n\nWe're killin' 'em with the over 90 crowd.\"\n\n(laughs) >> It's nice to see all this snow and water.\n\nIn Arizona we have so little water, the trees chase the dogs.\n\n>> People are starting to see McCain again.\n\nHe's out in the town halls.\n\nYou know, the first one, there's like seven show up.\n\nBut then, you know, each successive one we do, more people are showing up.\n\nNot less.\n\nSo it's building.\n\nWe can feel it building.\n\nIt's getting stronger.\n\nSomething's happening.\n\n>> Hey!\n\n>> NARRATOR: He appeared at over 100 town hall meetings.\n\n>> John, I don't know how many town halls...\n\nI think people ran away from him.\n\n\"I've seen you 12 times.\"\n\n(laughs) I think he's met every man, woman and child in New Hampshire.\n\nAnd he loves it.\n\n>> Put your hand out there.\n\n>> There's a genuine affection for John McCain in New Hampshire.\n\n>> Thank you very much.\n\nI had no idea.\n\n>> He built the bond with New Hampshire voters in 2000 that gave him the ability to come back as John McCain, not as some imitation of John McCain.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They picked up a new bus-- they called it \"No Surrender.\"\n\nThe straight talk was about his most controversial public position: support for the Iraq war and the surge.\n\n>> And he said, as to the war, \"we're going to commit ourselves to winning this thing like the troops have.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: But some on his staff were dead set against it.\n\n>> I could tell you that there were plenty of voices, that were saying, \"Stay away.\n\nIt's political suicide.\"\n\n>> The war was extremely unpopular.\n\nWe picked that up in the polling.\n\nWe're not... we can read a poll.\n\nAnd you know, plenty of us thought, \"you know, you got to get out from under this thing.\n\nIt'll kill you.\n\nAbsolutely not.\"\n\n>> INTERVIEWER: Wouldn't move?\n\n>> No!\n\n>> He's tough.\n\nHe's just tough, and just tough in a very batten down way.\n\nHe's just an immovable object when it comes to issues like that.\n\nIt's just... there's no discussion.\n\nIt's just, \"This is the way it's going to be.\"\n\nVery unpopular position, doubling down on the most unpopular issue in America.\n\nHe doubled down.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Ever since the summer of 2003, McCain had been pushing the administration to add more troops.\n\n>> John McCain is on \"Meet the Press\" every week saying, \"We got a surge.\n\nWe got to have more troops.\n\nWe got to have more troops.\"\n\n>> He was opposed to the way the war had been waged in the first four years.\n\nHe was opposed to Rumsfeld.\n\nHe was opposed to the general incompetence on the part of the White House.\n\n>> John McCain sat down in December of 2006 to write a letter to the president.\n\nPrivate letter.\n\nThe letter was not released publicly.\n\nThree pages and said, \"We are going to lose this war unless we make a more serious effort here, it's a matter of will not of capacity.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But most in Washington wanted the president to bring the troops home as soon as possible.\n\nBush decided to send in even more.\n\n>> The new strategy will change America's course in Iraq and help us succeed in the fight against terror.\n\n>> John McCain looked at George Bush and saw that he resisted all the pressure around him.\n\nSaw that he stood up to conventional wisdom and said, \"I'm going to do this because I think this is right.\"\n\nAnd nothing in John McCain's mind is a bigger test of leadership than that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In New Hampshire, John McCain stood by the president and the surge.\n\n>> I would rather lose an election than to stay silent and watch my country lose a war.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> NARRATOR: And on election night, he won.\n\n>> My friends, I am past the age when I can claim the noun \"kid,\" no matter what adjective precedes it.\n\nBut tonight, we sure showed them what a comeback looks like!\n\n>> The room was packed.\n\nIt was... given everything that John had been through the past year and essentially being pronounced dead, it just was pretty damn satisfying.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But for all the fun McCain had in New Hampshire, there was one undeniable reality: it wasn't the Republican faithful that were responsible for his win.\n\n>> He only runs even in the exit poll among self-identified Republicans.\n\nAgain, he depends on moderates and independents, and he faces the same question coming out of New Hampshire that he did eight years ago: could he get core Republicans to vote for him in sufficient numbers?\n\nAnd to a remarkable extent, the answer once again is \"no.\"\n\n>> Enjoy this.\n\nYou have earned it more than me.\n\nTomorrow, we begin again.\n\n(cheers) Thank you.\n\n>> John McCain!\n\nJohn McCain!\n\nJohn McCain!\n\n>> The next big battlefield is South Carolina.\n\n>> Big, big race in South Carolina for the Republicans this weekend.\n\n>> The candidate coming into South Carolina with the most momentum, Senator John McCain, may also be the one with the most to lose here... >> NARRATOR: John McCain came to South Carolina with the urgent need to demonstrate to the conservative base of the Republican party that he could be their candidate.\n\n>> You could write New Hampshire off as just a different place that likes John McCain.\n\nHe's the king of New Hampshire.\n\nBut to become the frontrunner, you had to win in a red state, and you had to win where I live.\n\n>> I have a 25-year pro-life record.\n\n(cheers) >> NARRATOR: McCain would need to appeal to the very people who had helped destroy his candidacy in 2000.\n\n>> To the McCain campaign this was the scene of the crime.\n\nThis is where he had gone down in defeat in smear tactics that he, to this day, thinks were orchestrated by... by the Bush campaign.\n\n>> Some of the most horrific things ever said about a candidate were said by Bush people against John McCain.\n\n>> These were people who fought against John McCain in 2000, who by 2005 and 2006, he was actively courting, recruiting, trying to bring them around to his campaign.\n\n(cheers) >> NARRATOR: He'd paid his dues: working hard for the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004 and reconciling with the Reverend Jerry Falwell.\n\n>> We were able to put together a coalition of evangelical Christians who saw John fight for Roberts and Alito.\n\nWe were able to convince people that he was a social-economic conservative, and on the signature issue of our campaign, winning this war, he was the best qualified.\n\n>> NARRATOR: To emphasize the candidate's war record and his religious faith, the McCain campaign created a TV commercial.\n\n>> One night after being mistreated as a POW, a guard loosened the ropes binding me, easing my pain.\n\nOn Christmas, the same guard approached me and without saying a word, he drew a cross in the sand.\n\nWe stood wordlessly looking at the cross, remembering the true light of Christmas.\n\n>> And that turned out to be, according to polling, an extremely effective ad for conservative voters in South Carolina.\n\n>> I'll never forget that no matter where you are, no matter how difficult the circumstances, there will always be someone who will pick you up.\n\n>> You know, it was one of the most effective things we did during the campaign.\n\nAnd it really, really worked.\n\n>> Jack is back!\n\nJack is back!\n\n>> Thank you, thank you, thank you, my friends!\n\nThank you, South Carolina!\n\n(cheers) >> South Carolina's a big victory for McCain, because of what had happened in 2000.\n\nAnd as a psychological victory it's huge for him.\n\n>> You know it took us a while, but what's eight years among friends?\n\n(cheers) >> NARRATOR: But once again, the margin of victory for McCain inside his own party was slim.\n\n>> Jack is back!\n\n>> If Fred Thompson had dropped out three days earlier, probably Mike Huckabee would have won.\n\nSo you had the conservatives split.\n\nYou had a pro-military, relatively conservative McCain do well and win by a narrow margin in a multi-way race.\n\nBut he won by a pretty narrow margin.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> Good night and God bless you, as you have blessed me.\n\nThank you, thank you again.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> Super Tuesday is over, but the presidential nominating contests are not.\n\n>> On the Democratic side, the waters are as muddy as ever... >> Both are set to sustain the struggle... >> NARRATOR: Last spring, as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton continued to slug it out in primary after primary, a controversy erupted.\n\n>> No, no, no!\n\nNot God bless America!\n\nGod damn America!\n\nThat's in the Bible, for killing innocent people!\n\nGod damn America for treating its citizens as less than human!\n\n(cheers) >> NARRATOR: Those videotapes of Obama's minister, Jeremiah Wright, hit the airwaves.\n\n>> There was a lot of consternation in the Clinton campaign that they didn't discover this themselves, that this was the lowest of low- hanging fruit for an opposition researcher to go and find these tapes.\n\nI mean, his name had been in the paper.\n\nWe knew he was out there.\n\nHe had cited him in his book.\n\nAnd so the Clinton people were saying to themselves, \"Whose job was it to go find the old tapes of Reverend Wright, and why didn't we do it a year ago?\"\n\n>> Yes, 9/11/01 happened to us, and so did slavery happen to us.\n\n>> He saw them on television.\n\nWe're told that he was jarred by it.\n\nHe knew it was a problem.\n\n>> And I'm sure that was a painful thing for him.\n\nThey had a bond together.\n\nThey were very close at one time in their lives, and I'm sure it was painful for Obama.\n\n>> I am sick of Negroes who just do not get it!\n\n>> I was surprised at seeing the film of Reverend Wright.\n\nIt's not evocative of the Barack Obama that... that I know.\n\nThese two things seemed to be quite at odds with one another.\n\nAnd I was very disconcerted by it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The pressure on Obama to do something was enormous.\n\n>> He could completely distance himself and denounce Reverend Wright, and just say, you know, \"This stuff is outrageous; I never knew about it; I want nothing to do with it; it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nTough thing to do, because he'd been close to the man for many, many, years and had been in the church.\n\n>> His hand is forced to finally really tackle this issue ironically so that he's not perceived as an angry black politician, in association with the rhetoric of Reverend Wright would suggest.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Senator Clinton had fumbled an opportunity to attack him on a vulnerable front, but even more remarkably, Obama, the ever-careful planner, had failed to prepare a defense.\n\n>> I'm sure that there were conversations about whether Barack should try to distance himself from Reverend Wright or how to manage it, but there was no plan in place for how to deal with it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It would be left to Obama to figure out how to handle it.\n\nAfter a few days, he decided.\n\n>> He said, \"I want to do a speech on race.\n\nI want to put this in context.\"\n\nHe said, \"And I want to do it on Monday or Tuesday.\"\n\nHe said, \"But I have to be...\n\nI have to write it.\"\n\n>> Today, Obama promises to tackle the race issue head on in Pennsylvania.\n\n>> Race is now officially on the table.\n\n>> He must get beyond this race debate and soon.\n\n>> This campaign is calling this speech an important moment... >> Major address on race, politics and unifying our country... >> What may be the most important speech of his campaign.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Obama chose the Constitution Center in Philadelphia for the speech.\n\n>> Thank you, thank you so much.\n\nI believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together, understanding that we may have different stories but we hold common hopes.\n\n>> I mean, this is a moment of sort of maximum peril for a candidate.\n\nAnd his goal was to elevate out of that moment into something broader.\n\n>> We've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in Affirmative Action.\n\n>> Jeremiah Wright, God bless him, allowed Barack Obama to confront this issue sooner rather than later, and I think it allowed him to regain the upper hand.\n\n>> I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community.\n\nI can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother-- a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.\n\nThese people are part of me.\n\nAnd they are part of America, this country that I love.\n\n>> This was not your usual Barack Obama event.\n\n>> The speech was a political necessity.\n\n>> It was a nuanced take on race relations in this country.\n\n>> I give Senator Obama a lot of credit.\n\n>> Barack Obama gave the most expansive and most intensely personal... >> One of the most of his career that will likely be talked about for the rest of this campaign... >> I've had it up to here with John McCain.\n\n>> He is confusing Republicans with his liberal friends.\n\n>> The piece of legislation that John McCain became most famous for he co-authored with liberals.\n\n>> He's going to reach out to Democrats and get even with Republicans... >> NARRATOR: McCain's team knew he could not win in November without the conservatives, and they weren't happy that he had prevailed.\n\n>> You know, all the talk around the issues John McCain has as he cruises towards the nomination is how's this guy going to unite his party?\n\nWhat's he going to do?\n\nRush Limbaugh's out there on the radio every day telling people they'd be crazy to vote for this guy.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the annual meeting of CPAC-- the Conservative Political Action Conference-- they gathered to mourn the loss of Mitt Romney and to reluctantly hear John McCain plead for their support.\n\n>> I've never seen an instance where somebody in his position, who is the de facto leader of the party heading into the next election, walks into an audience like that and gets the kind of boos that he got.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinary to hear it.\n\nIt's not as though everybody in the audience was booing, but it was loud and it was real.\n\n>> It's been a little while since I've had the honor of addressing you, and I appreciate very much your courtesy to me today.\n\nYou know, we should do this more often.\n\n(laughs) >> John wanted to make the case that, \"Here's who I am on judges.\n\nHere's who I am on taxes.\n\nI believe in limited government.\n\nHere's why I fight earmarking.\n\nEarmarking is a corruption of government.\"\n\n>> I believe today, as I believed 25 years ago, in small government, fiscal discipline, low taxes, a strong defense, judges who inform, and not make, our laws.\n\n>> It's like this thinnest balance beam that's probably existed, because on one side he's trying to still retain the \"I'm the independent, I'm the moderate.\n\nI can appeal, I'm the maverick.\"\n\nOn the other side is, \"You can trust me.\n\nI'm a good Republican.\"\n\n>> I am pro-life and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world.\n\nI will never waver in that conviction, I promise you.\n\n>> It was clear that the room was still deeply skeptical about whether they really wanted John McCain as the leader of their party.\n\n>> Thank you and God bless you.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> That day was a reminder that he still had a considerable amount of work to do to make his comfort level with the conservative base of the party real.\n\n>> I think what McCain did, which almost killed him, was he tried to become Mr. Insider, and he tried to become Mr.\n\nEstablishment.\n\nAnd the truth was, it didn't work.\n\nNobody believed it on either side, and it made him look kind of foolish.\n\nHe's not an insider.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But McCain kept trying.\n\nOne endorsement really mattered to the Republican faithful... and McCain finally received it.\n\n>> After all this bad history, McCain turns up at the White House for the laying on of hands from the President.\n\nAnd the two have a hot dog lunch together, you know, at the White House.\n\n>> It's been my honor to welcome my friend, John McCain, as the nominee of the Republican Party.\n\n>> What was interesting about the endorsement was... was how much that they both stammered about whether or not Bush would campaign with McCain or even appear at his side.\n\n>> I intend to have as much possible campaigning events and... together as in keeping with the President's heavy schedule.\n\n>> Bush didn't mince as many words as McCain did.\n\n>> If my showing up and endorsing him helps him-- or if I'm against him and it helps him-- either way, I want him to win.\n\n>> As the campaign progressed, I think by June of 2008, McCain and Bush-- aside from the endorsement at the White House-- had spent about 50 seconds in public together.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\n>> Yeah, thank you all very much.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The President would also give McCain something else: some of the best talent from his 2004 reelection effort would now be in charge of McCain's campaign.\n\n>> The Reverend Wright is speaking out louder than ever.\n\n>> This has been narcissistic and has been destructive for the Obama campaign.\n\n>> NARRATOR: One month after his speech about race, Barack Obama again had a Jeremiah Wright problem.\n\n>> We both know that if Senator Obama did not say what he said he would never get elected.\n\n>> I was traveling with Senator Obama that day and the first reaction from Senator Obama was to sort of blame it on Republicans and the media for making so much out of this.\n\nHe distanced himself a little bit.\n\n>> He had to distance himself because he's a politician.\n\nHe said \"I didn't offer any words of hope.\"\n\nHow would he know?\n\nHe never heard the rest of the sermon.\n\nYou've never heard it.\n\n>> Less than 24 hours later he came out at this press conference; he had this pained look in his eye, you know, and he strongly broke from his pastor.\n\n>> It is antithetical to our campaign; it is antithetical to what I am about; it is not what I think America stands for.\n\n>> And I think it took the second appearance of Reverend Wright for it to be much easier for Barack Obama to make a real break.\n\n>> When I say I find these comments appalling, I mean it.\n\nIt contradicts everything that I'm about and who I am.\n\n>> It was a painful withdrawal for both of them because here were men who had done a lot together.\n\n>> Thank you, guys.\n\n>> And that was a very... a very painful separation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But the political damage had been done.\n\n>> Senator Obama's support among hard-working Americans, white Americans is weakening again.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama by nine points.\n\n>> The Clintons were very, very formidable.\n\nAnd of all the aspects of their base, there is no stronger part of their base than blue-collar workers.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Winning that group's support would continue to be a challenge for Obama.\n\n>> For Obama, it's one of the greatest frustrations.\n\nYou talk to white, working-class voters or he listens to his pollsters, and they say, \"We don't know if he's authentic.\n\nWe don't know if he understands us.\"\n\nFor Obama, who came from a family of limited means, who believes that he projects an authenticity that's his greatest strength, this is a frustrating thing and one that he'll have to solve with white working-class voters if he's going to be the president of the United States.\n\n>> NARRATOR: By last June, it was finally over; they'd made peace.\n\n>> I pledge m"
