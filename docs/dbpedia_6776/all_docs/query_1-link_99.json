        "text": "TOPLINE\n\nMore than 100 former staffers of the late Republican Sen. John McCain signed a letter endorsing Democratic nominee Joe Biden for the presidency, in a rebuke of President Trump, who frequently clashed with the longtime Arizona senator, former GOP presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran, POW and hero.\n\nKEY FACTS\n\nCrucial quote\n\n“These are unusual times, and this is not an easy decision for Republicans to make,” the letter states. “Many of us disagree with the positions espoused by the Democratic ticket, but we are heartened by Joe Biden’s history of bipartisanship.”\n\nBig number\n\n2. That’s how many years it’s been since McCain died after a battle with brain cancer. The second anniversary of his death was Tuesday, August 25.\n\nKey background\n\nAfter McCain’s death, reports emerged that the senator didn’t want Trump to attend his funeral. The two men clashed frequently during Trump’s 2016 campaign and after he took over the Oval Office. Trump infamously said McCain was “not a war hero” and that he likes people who weren’t captured, a reference to the fact McCain was taken prisoner and tortured during the Vietnam War. What Trump failed to mention were McCain’s grievous wounds, the torture he endured at the hands of the North Vietnamese and above all, his refusal of an offer of early release because he wouldn’t leave his men behind. In 2017, McCain notably foiled Trump’s attempt to repeal the individual mandate and other key measures in the Affordable Care Act with a dramatic thumbs-down in the Senate chambers. Trump has continued to attack McCain after his death. Most recently, Trump described McCain as a “lousy candidate” with a campaign full of “deadheads” after Sarah Palin made a Fox News appearance and complained of sabotage when she ran as McCain’s 2008 vice presidential nominee.\n\nTangent\n\nOn Trump’s birthday in 2019, an Ellen DeGeneres Show producer got #JohnMcCainDay to trend on Twitter to rile the president.\n\nFurther reading\n\nMcCain Alums endorse Joe Biden for President (Medium)\n\nThe iconic thumbs-down vote that summed up John McCain’s career (Washington Post)"
