        "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s departure from the Republican presidential campaign leaves Donald Trump with no major rivals for the GOP nomination. That, combined with President Joe Biden’s largely (though not entirely) uncontested march to renomination for the Democrats, makes 2024 one of the shortest presidential primary seasons since the 1970s, when the current nominating process took shape.\n\nTrump’s likely clinching of the nomination comes 244 days before Election Day, matching Democrat John Kerry’s pace in 2004. Kerry won nine out of 10 primaries on that year’s Super Tuesday, March 2. The following day, Kerry’s last significant opponent, John Edwards, dropped out, giving Kerry a clear path to the nomination.\n\nOnly one major-party nominee clinched earlier: Republican John McCain in 2008. McCain, making his second run for the White House, swept the four GOP primaries held that March 4, giving him a majority of convention delegates. That night, McCain’s lone remaining opponent, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, withdrew from the race and endorsed him – 245 days before Election Day 2008.\n\nThe earliest both major parties have wrapped up their nominating contests was in 2000. That year, Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush both clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 9 – 243 days before the November election. Bush and Gore both dominated the Super Tuesday primaries, leading their sole rivals – McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley, respectively – to fold their campaigns.\n\nFor every presidential election cycle since 1972, Pew Research Center calculated how long before the general election each major-party nominee clinched their nomination, either by accumulating a majority of convention delegates or by default, once all their major rivals dropped out of the race. Our analysis begins in 1972 because that was when the modern primary-dominated nominating process began, at least on the Democratic side; the GOP followed suit in 1976.\n\nEarly on, nomination battles sometimes extended all the way to the parties’ national conventions. In 1972, for instance, Sen. George McGovern came to the Democratic convention with far more pledged delegates than anyone else, but his intraparty rivals tried (unsuccessfully) to pry loose enough delegates to deny him a first-ballot victory. McGovern’s victory in that credentials fight guaranteed him the nomination.\n\nThe latest a major-party nominee has secured their party’s bid was 75 days before Election Day. In 1976, the long slugfest for the Republican nomination between incumbent President Gerald Ford and former California Gov. Ronald Reagan wasn’t settled until the convention on Aug. 19, when Ford edged out Reagan on the first ballot.\n\nSince then, however, the general trend has been for nominations to be settled considerably earlier, accelerated by the practice of states moving up their presidential primaries to have more influence on the process. More than half of the pledged delegates to this summer’s GOP convention, for instance, will have been chosen by mid-March."
