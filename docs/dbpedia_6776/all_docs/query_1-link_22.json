        "text": "• Senator John McCain is lying in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol, the 31st person to receive that honor.\n\n• Elected officials and the cabinet had a chance to pay their respects in a ceremony at 11 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence spoke on behalf of the Trump administration at a Capitol ceremony honoring Mr. McCain, who did not want President Trump to attend his funeral remembrances.\n\n• The Rotunda is now open for public viewing: A line snaking three rows of barricades stretched down the street by noon, as hundreds waited to pay their respects to the senator. Groups of sailors, wearing their dress whites, dotted the crowds and many held umbrellas aloft to shield themselves from the sun.\n\nVice President Pence said the president sent him.\n\nVice President Pence opened his speech by crediting the president who was excluded from the proceedings with his presence: “The president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation, to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served his country throughout his life.”\n\nMr. Pence and Senator McCain joined together in the past to fight earmarks and on other fiscal issues while Mr. Pence was a conservative leader — and a bit of a maverick himself — in the House.\n\nThe vice president, who almost always begins his remarks bringing greetings from Mr. Trump, was in the awkward position of having to eulogize a man whom the president has studiously avoided praising in the days since his death.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
