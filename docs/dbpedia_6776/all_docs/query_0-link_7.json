        "text": "Editor's note: This is the 14th of an 18-chapter profile of Sen. John McCain, portions of which originally were published in October 1999 and March 2007. It has been updated and expanded. Read more about this project: John McCainâ€™s American Story.\n\nWhen John McCain returned battered and broken from a North Vietnamese prison camp in 1973, he went home to Florida.\n\nNearly 35 years later, the senator from Arizona returned to the Sunshine State riding a wave of adrenaline. He hoped it would turn into political momentum that would crush his rivals for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nMcCain's strategy had been working almost as planned. He had finished in a respectable virtual tie for third in the Jan. 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses. He'd won a dramatic come-from-behind victory in New Hampshire on Jan. 8. He had finished second in Michigan on Jan. 15 and had outmaneuvered and squeaked by his foes to win South Carolina on Jan. 19.\n\nOn paper, McCain was positioned to land a final blow by capturing Florida on Jan. 29. His advisers were counting on momentum to carry him to victory. They didn't have much choice. Florida was too big of a state and there was too little time between primaries to do much campaigning. And McCain wasn't exactly flush with cash.\n\nIn fact, McCain didn't get much of a bounce from his crucial South Carolina triumph. For him, Florida held some of the fiercest hand-to-hand political combat of the primary season.\n\nIt turned out that McCain had little to fear from Rudy Guiliani, who had led the national GOP polls for many months leading up to Iowa. The former New York City mayor hadn't been a contender in any of the early contests, and it was clear that Florida was unlikely to be his launching pad. Giuliani's candidacy was fizzling despite his constant campaigning in the state. He couldn't sustain a month's worth of dismal showings in the early states.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney remained the more potent threat to McCain. Romney had invested heavily in Florida, his campaign was dug in, and he was neck-and-neck with McCain in the polls. Besides that, Romney was a multimillionaire businessman who'd saved the scandal-rocked Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Olympics from financial disarray. And, much to McCain's chagrin, the national political debate was shifting from foreign policy, his area of expertise, to the shaky economy, where Romney was most comfortable.\n\nPast comments in which McCain had talked down his own understanding of economic issues returned to haunt him. He stumbled in Michigan, which analysts said was in a recession because of the reeling auto industry. Romney came in first there.\n\nIn Florida, the McCain-Romney rivalry took a bitter turn.\n\nMcCain, minimizing his foe's vaunted business-world expertise, stressed that he was a \"leader,\" not a mere \"manager\" like Romney.\n\n\"I think everybody knows the difference between leadership and management. You can hire managers all the time,\" McCain told reporters. \"People who do mechanics. People who implement policies. People who are good with assets. Leadership is people who inspire. People like (former President) Ronald Reagan. Leadership is people like General (David) Petraeus. Leadership is people who have had the hands-on experience and patriotism and service to the country and the nation, putting all else behind love of and service to country.\"\n\nThe contest got nastier. McCain accused Romney of supporting a secret timetable for a U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq. He based the charge on these remarks Romney had made to ABC News several months earlier: \"There's no question that the president and (Iraq's) Prime Minister (Nouri) al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about. But those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone.\"\n\nRomney angrily denied backing a specific date for U.S. forces to leave Iraq and insisted that he would never abandon the mission before it was successful.\n\n\"That's simply wrong and it's dishonest, and he should apologize,\" the furious Romney shot back.\n\nConservative pundits, radio hosts and bloggers for the most part sided with Romney and pounded McCain. Influential radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and others suggested that McCain was acting dishonorably, striking at his long-established aura of personal integrity. Sensing a do-or-die moment, some right-wing radio-talk-show hosts, such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, urged their listeners to support Romney. Ann Coulter, the conservative firebrand columnist and author, went further, vowing to campaign and vote for Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, if McCain won the GOP nomination. \"I would vote for the devil over John McCain,\" she fumed in an interview on the Fox News Channel.\n\nBut McCain scored two major coups late in the campaign: He secured the endorsements of Florida's popular Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican who years later would become a Democrat, and of Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., who was influential in the state's Cuban-American community. While cable-television talking heads, radio hosts and bloggers debated the fairness of McCain's timetable charge against Romney, local newspapers and TV stations across Florida covered the state with images of a smiling McCain and Crist.\n\nOn Election Day, McCain took Florida and its 57 convention delegates. He had defeated Romney, 36 percent to 31 percent.\n\nGiuliani, who finished a distant third with just 14.6 percent, bowed out and immediately threw his support to McCain. The stung Romney hung in the race as Super Tuesday loomed a week later. It would be the last chance to derail the McCain Train. The sheer magnitude of the delegates at stake made a Romney surge possible.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a one-time Baptist preacher who had started off the season with a victory in Iowa, also was poised to compete in some of the Southern states up for grabs on Feb. 5.\n\nA super Tuesday\n\nMcCain continued to campaign at a frantic pace. On Feb. 3, the Super Bowl was played in Glendale, a Phoenix suburb in McCain's home state. But McCain was watching the game from a hotel lobby in downtown Boston with Joe Lieberman, the independent senator from Connecticut whose support had been critical to McCain's success in New Hampshire. It was another thumb in Romney's eye: Massachusetts was one of the more than 20 states where Republicans were voting Feb. 5.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, McCain started the day at an early rally with Giuliani at Rockefeller Center Plaza in New York City.\n\n\"Welcome to the St. Patrick's Day Parade,\" Giuliani said while flashing a placard reading \"Irish for McCain\" from the stage. \"Irish for McCain? All New Yorkers for McCain!\"\n\nThe same day, McCain flew across the country to San Diego for another rally with another key ally, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former action star of Hollywood's \"Terminator\" movie series promised that President McCain would mean \"hasta la vista\" to wasteful government spending.\n\nThen McCain returned to Phoenix for the election-night results that would make or break him. The news trickling into the Arizona Biltmore resort from the East was encouraging. McCain had taken New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri and Oklahoma. He would also win Arizona and California to claim 602 delegates. Romney won Massachusetts, Utah, Colorado and four other states, representing 201 delegates. Huckabee won five Southern states for 152 delegates.\n\nMcCain had vanquished the only opponent who could have stopped him. Two days later, Romney suspended his campaign, saying that a protracted GOP fight would only help the Democrats and that he couldn't allow his campaign to \"be a part of aiding a surrender to terror.\"\n\n\"This is not an easy decision for me. I hate to lose,\" Romney said in a Feb. 7, 2008, speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. \"If this were only about me, I would go on. But I entered this race because I love America, and because I love America, I feel I must now stand aside, for our party and for our country.\"\n\nMcCain's path to the nomination was clear, but some drama lay ahead.\n\nWho is Vicki Iseman?\n\nOn Feb. 21, the New York Times published a front-page story about McCain's links to lobbyists, rehashing anecdotes from the 2000 campaign and even revisiting McCain's role in the distant Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nBut what made the story explosive was a new suggestion that, eight years earlier, McCain had behaved improperly with a telecommunications lobbyist named Vicki Iseman, who bears a superficial resemblance to McCain's wife, Cindy. The paper reported that some unidentified advisers affiliated with McCain's 2000 White House run were so \"convinced\" that the senator was involved in a romantic relationship with Iseman that they had intervened for his own good. At the time, McCain still ran the influential Senate Commerce Committee, and the Times article explored whether he had given preferential treatment to Iseman and her clients. Iseman may have been known to Commerce Committee members and staffers, but the American public had never heard of her.\n\nThe McCains found themselves staring into the media's microphones, voice recorders, cameras and lights in Toledo, Ohio, where they had been campaigning in advance of the state's March 4 primary.\n\nMcCain put his credibility and reputation on the line.\n\nA journalist asked if members of his 2000 campaign staff had urged him not to see Iseman.\n\n\"No,\" McCain said.\n\nNo meeting ever occurred?\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWere staffers concerned about a possible romantic relationship?\n\n\"If they were, they didn't communicate that to me.\"\n\nDid you ever have such a relationship?\n\n\"No.\"\n\nCan you describe your relationship with Iseman?\n\n\"Friends. Seen her on occasions, particularly at receptions and fundraisers and appearances before the committee. I have many friends in Washington who represent various interests and those who don't, and I consider her a friend.\"\n\nWere you closer to her than other lobbyist friends?\n\n\"No.\"\n\nCindy McCain backed her husband's account.\n\n\"Well, obviously, I'm very disappointed in the New York Times,\" she said. \"And, more importantly, my children and I not only trust my husband but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family but disappoint the people of America.\"\n\nAlcalde & Fay, Iseman's Arlington, Virginia-based lobbying firm, also blasted the Times' \"allegations and malicious innuendo\" as \"completely and utterly false.\" Iseman stayed secluded.\n\nThe story had no immediate ramifications for McCain. And the paper was criticized from many corners. Media critics, even many liberal ones, ripped the story as flimsy and inadequately sourced. McCain allies called it trash. McCain enemies accused the newspaper of holding the damaging piece until after McCain had the nomination sewn up. Some asked why had the Times endorsed McCain in New York's Feb. 5 primary when top editors knew such allegations were percolating.\n\nThe Times stood by its story.\n\n\"We don't know if there was a quid or a quo in this case. What we do know is that people very close to him, who watched him day after day, were worried enough by his behavior that they felt that he was endangering his career,\" Bill Keller, the Times' executive editor, said in an interview with NPR News' \"All Things Considered.\"\n\nA national poll from the University of Pennsylvania indicated that 40.8 percent of those asked found McCain's response more credible. The Times won the backing of 20.5 percent, 23.1 percent said they believed \"neither,\" and 8.1 percent believed \"both.\"\n\nA year later, in February 2009, the Times would settle a libel suit from Iseman without payment.\n\nHowever, an editor's note was published in the newspaper and on the Times' website that said: \"The article did not state, and The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients in breach of the public trust.\"\n\nClinching the nomination\n\nHuckabee remained in the race, holding out hope that McCain-wary conservatives in Texas might send the presumptive GOP nominee a message. McCain didn't seem concerned. He took a break to host a barbecue for the traveling press corps at his cabin near Sedona. Liberal bloggers, claiming a media payoff, cried foul as McCain grilled ribs on the porch for the reporters. Two days later, on March 4, McCain won in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont to clinch the Republican nomination.\n\n\"Senator McCain has run an honorable campaign because he is an honorable man,\" Huckabee said in his concession speech. \"It's now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been but what now must be, and that is a united party.\"\n\nMcCain addressed his supporters at the Fairmont hotel in downtown Dallas. He awaited the victor of an unexpectedly heated Democratic battle between Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Clinton.\n\n\"The contest begins tonight,\" McCain told the cheering ballroom crowd. \"As you know, like all campaigns, it will have its ups and downs, but we will fight every minute of every day to make certain we have a government that is as capable, wise, brave and decent as the great people we serve. That's our responsibility, and I won't let you down.\"\n\nNEXT CHAPTER: John McCain takes on Obama for president in 2008\n\nJohn McCain's American Story"
