        "text": "U.S. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who died Saturday at age 81, had a long but at times uncomfortable Iowa history.\n\nIn 2008, he came in fourth in the Iowa caucuses with 13 percent of the vote before eventually winning the Republican nomination for president. He lost the state in the general election to Democrat Barack Obama.\n\nIn his 2000 White House run, he cited his opposition to ethanol subsidies for skirting the state. He won 5 percent in that year’s caucuses.\n\nShortly after McCain announced in late August that he was stopping treatment for his brain cancer, Iowa U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said: “Sen. John McCain is a hero. He is a personal friend of mine, and this has been very difficult to watch the senator lose his strength and step away from his activities at the United States Senate.”\n\nErnst, a fellow Republican, said she grew to know McCain after spending time campaigning with him in Iowa during her race in 2014.\n\nErnst said since her election, McCain was adamant that younger lawmakers should be given the opportunity to join the Armed Services Committee.\n\n“He’s placed great authority and responsibility upon our shoulders, and we do intend to follow in his footsteps and make sure that we are protecting the American servicemen and women,\" she said.\n\nIowa's senior senator, Chuck Grassley, described McCain as \"tough and tenacious\" in a statement issued Saturday night.\n\nMore: McCain may have lost the presidency, but still became larger-than-life\n\nMore: John McCain's top quotes through the years\n\n\"Both as a naval officer and a member of the United States Senate, he exemplified a spirit of public service,\" Grassley said. \"Though he will be missed in the halls of the Senate, his contributions to the country and this institution will never be forgotten.”\n\nDavid Oman, a longtime Iowa Republican operative, recalled speaking with Senator McCain in 1995, when he was campaigning in Iowa on behalf of a colleague, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas.\n\nOman said he and McCain were at the old Science Center in Des Moines' Greenwood Park to speak to an Iowa Jaycees meeting. Oman was serving as a surrogate for Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.\n\nOman said that when McCain learned he was to follow Oman, McCain walked over and in a most humble manner asked if Oman would let him speak first so he could get to a function in Ames, to which Oman agreed.\n\nWhen McCain was introduced, no mention was made of his five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\n\n\"He would never bring it up on his own, and it seemed few in the audience knew his history,\" Oman said. \"After McCain left, I was given the mic and shared with the Jaycees (that) they could make up their minds who they wanted for president, but that all of us had just been in the presence of a true American hero.\"\n\nIowa Department of Management Director David Roederer, who served as McCain's state chairman during his Iowa campaign, said he remembered taking the senator to tour the Iowa State Fair.\n\n\"We were going through the cattle barn on the way over to the hog barn, and I heard him say ‘It will be OK, it will be OK.’ And he was looking straight ahead,\" Roederer said. \"I thought he was talking to me, but he wasn’t.\"\n\nRoederer said a woman had locked eyes with McCain and approached him.\n\n\"She didn’t say a word, she just hugged him,\" he said. \"And he patted her on the back and he said ‘It will be OK. Just stay with it. It will be OK.’ And she said, ‘Thank you, Senator.’ And she walked away. And he said, ‘Vietnam mother.’ I said, ‘Senator, does this happen a lot?’ He said, ‘All the time. They don’t say a word, and there’s not anything you really can say.’\"\n\nIowa Republican Chuck Larson, who served as a senior advisor on McCain's \"kitchen cabinet,\" said he remembers McCain's work ethic as well as his candidness with the media and with voters.\n\n\"I remember the day we launched his candidacy, he was taking a bus from the Iowa state Capitol to Mason City,\" Larson said. \"And literally he was sitting in the back of the bus with reporters. And they ran out of all of their traditional questions, current political questions, and they started to delve into abortion and condoms in high school. And I got a hold of the campaign manager at the front of the bus and I said, 'My gosh, we have to do something. These questions are going to take over the headlines tomorrow.' And he said, 'No, this is the Straight Talk Tour. This is what we do.' That was his style.\"\n\nLarson said that during his 20 years in politics he's never seen another candidate open up the mic and take questions from the audience the way McCain did.\n\n\"And that’s why Americans loved him so much,\" Larson said. \"He was so different than your traditional candidate.\"\n\nAnother important Iowa tie for McCain was his decades-long friendship with the late George “Bud” Day, a Sioux City native who shared a prison cell with McCain in Vietnam and later crisscrossed the state with his presidential campaign.\n\nDay, whose jet was shot down in 1967, was awarded the Medal of Honor for providing “maximum resistance” despite years of torture and numerous injuries suffered in POW camps.\n\nWhen Day died in 2013, McCain called him a “dear friend” and said in a statement, “I owe my life to Bud, and much of what I know about character and patriotism. He was the bravest man I ever knew, and his fierce resistance and resolute leadership set the example for us in prison of how to return home with honor.”\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a statement Saturday evening in which she called McCain \"the very best our country had to offer.\"\n\n\"He understood the greatness of America, fought tirelessly for our values and put forth decades of admirable service to this nation,\" Reynolds said. \"He was a loving husband and father, and we will never forget him or the legacy he leaves behind.\"\n\nIn a news release, Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann called McCain \"an American hero in every sense of the word\" and said the senator exemplified bravery and leadership.\n\n\"We are forever grateful for his patriotism and unwavering dedication to bettering our country. Our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time,\" Kauffman noted."
