        "text": "In an overall historical context, the 2008 election was arguably the most important and impactful presidential election ever. For the first time ever, the nominee for president from one of the two major parties, was an African-American. As a result of the Bush presidency, which would come to be considered one of the worst of all time, there were multiple issues that would dominate the election conversation. The first issue was the Iraq War which was growing more and more unpopular among the public. The second and most pressing domestic issue that was discussed throughout the election process, was the state of the U.S. economy. With the crash of the housing market, unemployment numbers spiked, and thousands of people were out of work, and many lost their homes. In a battle of experience vs fresh ideas, Illinois Senator Barack Obama would defeat Arizona Senator John McCain, making him the first African-American President in United States history.\n\nThe campaign of Barack Obama sparked a new interest in politics for many Americans. The Obama movement was so powerful, that Oprah Winfrey, arguably the Queen of daytime television, endorsed him. This was the first time ever that Oprah had ever endorsed anyone for President. This would spark an outpouring of support for Obama from all areas of popular culture. Songwriter and producer will.i.am would take the phrase “Yes We Can” which Obama would use in a speech, and turn it into a song and YouTube video. Obama would also reference Jay-Z lyrics during a speech which shows a tremendous shift in the political environment of the United States, as just eight years earlier, George Bush and Al Gore were arguing for more censorship of things like hip-hop music.\n\nObama would also be the first candidate to regularly use Twitter as a way to engage with the public. The 2008 campaign of Barack Obama was for all intents and purposes a youth movement as stars like, Rihanna, Beyonce, and Kim Kardashian all voiced their support. The Obama campaign of 2008 was truly groundbreaking, and it would only build the relationship between campaigns and popular culture.\n\nWhile the Obama campaign was embracing all of the benefits that come with being privy to popular culture, the John McCain campaign did not. Much of the McCain campaign that would cross into popular culture had little to do with McCain himself, and a lot to do with his running mate, Alaska Governor, Sarah Palin. Palin was a relative outsider to the national political scene, and her inexperience would create some of the most memorable moments of the campaign. In an interview, when asked about her lack of foreign policy experience, Palin would respond by saying “I can see Russia from my house.” This line would spark numerous jokes, most notably from the ever-present SNL, where Tina Fey would do a spot on impersonation of Palin, mocking such statements like these.\n\nAnother memorable pop culture moment from the McCain Palin campaign, was the manifestation of “Joe the Plumber” Meant as a symbol for the everyman, Joe would become a national sensation, appearing on numerous television shows. He would be a staunch supporter of the McCain campaign."
