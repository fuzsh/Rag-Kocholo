        "text": "Nebraska uses a split system for allocating electoral votes. The state allocates one electoral vote to the winner of each of the state's three congressional districts, and the remaing two to the candidate who wins a plurality of the entire state's popular vote. Barack Obama won a plurality in the 2nd congressional district (Omaha), and therefore was awarded one of the state's five electoral votes. John McCain won a plurality in the 1st and 3rd districts, as well as the overall state vote and therefore was awarded four electoral votes. Maine is the only other state that uses a split system."
