        "text": "In an essay posted to Substack on Sunday, Schmidt revealed that he lied to discredit a 2008 New York Times article that reported on McCain's close relationship with a lobbyist.\n\nThe New York Times reported that lobbyist Vicki Iseman received special treatment from McCain and detailed speculations that their relationship had turned romantic.\n\nSchmidt said he lied on McCain's behalf to protect his reputation, despite knowing about his close relationship with the lobbyist.\n\n\"John McCain did a lot of great things, he did a lot of heroic things, right, and he did some bad things. And he absolutely betrayed me,\" Schmidt told the Politico podcast.\n\nSchmidt also said that he regretted playing a part in the rise of Sarah Palin, McCain's running mate, who Schmidt has described as a \"degenerate liar.\"\n\nDuring the Politico podcast, Schmidt said that McCain was a \"reckless man\" and suggested that if elected, his administration would have had similarities with Donald Trump's.\n\n\"This is the greatest disillusioning experience of my life,\" Schmidt said. \"This guy was a hero of mine.\""
