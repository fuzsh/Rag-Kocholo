David Durston, 88, director of the New York film I Drink Your Blood (1970), died on May 6 in West Hollywood.

Durston started out as an actor and TV producer, working on "Your Hit Parade" and a number of other programs in the 1950s. Although some of his early TV credits are a bit fuzzy (you can read a dissection of his more questionable credits here), his most well-known film remains a highlight (or low point, depending on you disposition) of 70s exploitation cinema.

I Drink Your Blood was commissioned by Cinemation founder Jerry Gross. Durston delivered a frothing horror hodge-podge that freely mixed elements of Night of the Living Dead with the Manson Family and even Sweeney Todd. In the film, a hippie cult injests rabies-tainted meat pies, which transforms them into foaming-at-the-mouth psychotic killers. They in turn infect a truckload of construction workers, and before you know it there's a whole horde of machete- and axe-wielding hydrophobic "zombies" running amuck.

Gross released the film on a classic double-bill with I Eat Your Skin (actually, a retitling of Del Tenney's black-and-white Florida-made Zombie, 1964), and Blood became one of the first films to receive an X rating because of violence (see below).
