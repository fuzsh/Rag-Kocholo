John Benton Fly who departed this life at his home amid the scenes of his birthplace and childhood, a few miles southwest of Purdy, on August 28, 1905, of paralysis, aged 65 years and 12 days. He was born August 16, 1840 on the headwaters of Joys Creek, about 1 1/2 miles east of Corsicana, and was a son of the late J. N. and Nancy Oakley Fly, old and esteemed citizens of this county during life and was reared to manhood on the old homestead where he died. In 1858, he and Miss Susan Woodward, a member of an old and respected family of this county, were married, to whom were born eight children, seven of whom survive him. They are: Misses Leona and Cora Fly, of near Purdy, J. N. Fly of Verona, Marshall Fly of Nevada, Finis and Clarence of Aurora. Mrs. Samantha Cowden of Pleasant Hope. He was a brother of Hon. Wm. A. and D. C. Fly of Purdy, Mrs. Michael Horine of this place and Mrs. Jane Browning of Verona. In 1867 he professed religion at the Fly school house near his home and in 1868 united with the C. P. Church and was ordained a minister of that church in 1871, and since that time has been a faithful and zealous advocate of the principles of that church in many places in Missouri and Kansas. In his earlier life he taught many schools in Barry and Lawrence counties. Rev. Hicks of Springfield recently paid him a visit at his home, and while there Mr. Fly asked him to preach his funeral from the following text: "I have fought a good fight" which was done at Mt. Joys C. P. Church, Wednesday at 11 a.m., to a large crowd of sorrowing relatives and sympathizing neighbors, by Rev. Pinkston and Gurley. The Knights Templar then took charge of the remains and laid them to rest in the Purdy Cemetery, with their ceremonies. His life was spent for the benefit of living humanity. In expounding the Gospel of Christ he has made the pathway of life and a future redemption bright for many hundreds of people. His earthly work completed and the beckon from the bright spirit land to come there to bask in the sunlight of his Great Redeemer, was welcomed, there to rest in eternal happiness from the trails and tribulations of this life. - Cassville Republican, March 12, 1896 - Scholten News Items: The people are expecting a debate at Mars Hill Church between Rev.

FLY DEAD - She remembered her Creator in the early days of girlhood, forsook the evil ways and drew nigh unto Him, in which she had great pleasures. Her pathway to Christ was not darkened, but enlightened as she passed along and her love for Him flourished and never become a burden to her. The silver cord of life was served, the golden bowl was broken and her dust returned to earth and her spirit to God who gave it. Miss Martha A. Hale was born in Greene county, Indiana, May 8, 1841, and died at her home in Purdy, July 2, 1921, after an illness of six or seven months. She professed faith in Christ at the age of 18 years and united with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, near Stella, Newton county, Missouri. On April 28, 1868, she and the late Hon. Wm. A.

Three children were born of this marriage: Mrs. A. M. Gurley and Miss Mable Fly of Purdy and Henry W. Fly of Monett. Also one step son W. M. Fly of Purdy. After her marriage she united with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of which her husband was a member and continued their membership until death. She was a faithful wife and a kind and loving mother and enjoyed the high esteem of all her acquaintances. Her patient and kind disposition in her suffering during her long sickness, was wonderful, but never complained and up to a few days before her death believed she would get well, but when the last moments came, she just peacefully went to sleep in Jesus. That she was appreciated by her friends was demonstrated by the fact, that there was never a time when her room was without flowers. The young people were especially kind to her. Funeral services were conducted Sunday afternoon, at the M. E. Church in Purdy, by Rev. Wadlow of Republic, and interment was made in the Cemetery there. The following named were pall bearers: C.A.

His death certificate added the dates of his birth and death and reads that his father was Nicholas Fly. He second married Angeline Leeper and third Martha A. Hale. - Cassville Democrat, March 2, 1918 - HON. WM. A. FLY DEAD - Full of Honors - Ripe Old Age - Loved and Respected By Acquaintances - Barry county is weeping because of the passing of another one of our splendid citizens, who practiced the old time honor of men, that did not require a bond or mortgage, to cause men to do right. This he practiced through life and by doing so, won the plaudits and high esteem of all his fellow-citizens who enjoyed the pleasure of his acquaintance. As evidence of his standing in Barry county, he never announced for office, but his many friends throughout the county, knew his worth and ability, and nominated him for two terms as county judge and twice as a member of the Legislature, and he was elected by good majorities, running ahead of his ticket. That we could all lay down and go to our sweet rest as he has, would be consoling to our loved ones and his splendid life is worthy of emulation. It would make us and the world better. The writer has known him all his life and can truthfully say that no better man ever lived in our county. He loved the people of Barry county, because they had bestowed great honors upon him and he appreciated it. In letters to the Editor of the Democrat, he always express his gratitude to the people of his county for the great confidence they had reposed in him and he never proved untrue. His honor never questioned. In one of his letters he stated that the first President he voted for was Hon. James K. Polk in 1845, and said he never missed voting. He was a great admirer of President Wilson and said, "I have lived in this county for over 70 years and hope by the strong grip of the Lions paw of the tribe of Judea to be better off." Hon. Wm. A. Fly died at his home in Purdy, Tuesday evening at 6 p.m., February 26, 1918, of in infirmities attending old age, aged 91 years, 11 months and 10 days. Mr. Fly was born in Maury county Tenn., and was a son of J. N. and Nancy (Oakley) Fly, honored citizens of this county during life, who came to Barry county, May 14, 1839, and located on Joys Creek, 1 1/2 miles east of Corsicana, where they lived until death called them to another home. Six children of this family including Wm. A. Fly to man and womanhood, who were Rev. Benton Fly, D. C. Fly and Marion Fly, Mrs. Samantha Horine of Cassville, Mrs. Paralee Woodward of near Purdy and Mrs. Elizabeth Browning, deceased, of near Verona. Two or three children died in infancy. Wm. A. Fly grew to manhood at his father's home and received a common school education. He had been married three times, first to Miss Naomi Surgnier, who died in 1864, and nine children were born to this marriage, three of whom grew to man and womanhood and were: Jasper L., deceased, Wm. M. and Miss Mary Jane Fly. Mr. Fly married the second time, Miss Angeline Leeper of Green county, who died June 16, 1867. His last marriage was to Miss Martha A. Hale and three children survive him who are: Mrs. Amos Gurley and Miss Mabel Fly of Purdy and Henry W. Fly of Monett. The wife survives him. He followed farming until age came on him when he sold his farm and moved to Purdy where he lived a quiet and pleasant life and was always glad to meet his old friends and talk about old time citizens of this county to whom it seemed a very great pleasure to remember. Before the civil war he was deputy sheriff under Sheriff Peavey. In 1878 he was elected associate judge of the county court on the democratic ticket and again in 1880, making splendid records each time, so recommended him to the people of his county having a faithful servant, he was elected to the Legislature in 1884 and again re-elected in 1886, proving his great integrity and honesty all the time. He had for years been a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian church and was a zealous Christian man. He was a Master Mason and among the oldest in the county and was a charter member of the Pythagoras Lodge No. 383 of this city and when a lodge was instituted at Purdy he moved his membership there where he remained a member until his death. Reverends Mark Combs and Francis Goodnight conducted funeral services at the Methodist church, Thursday, February 28 at 2 p.m. after which the remains were laid to rest in the Purdy cemetery with Masonic honors. A very large number of old friends and acquaintances assembled to pay their last tribute of love and respect to a man who had the implicit confidence of his acquaintances. The world has been made better by his having lived and his life is a rich heritage to his loved ones left behind to mourn his passing. Pall bearers: John Davis and S. A. Chappell of Monett, Dr. Kelly, Charlie Rose and Jas. Rhea of Purdy and Chas. Ray of Cassville. - Springfield Republican, Greene Co., MO, March 10, 1918 - FORMER SLAVE HOLDER OF BARRY COUNTY SUCCUMBS - With one possible exception the death of W. A. Fly takes from Barry county the last of her pioneer citizens who held slaves at the beginning of the Civil War.

Johnny graduated from PHS in 1966. He met a pretty girl while in class at school (across the road from the graveyard.) Love bloomed. They were both 'smitten.' He was a tall, lanky, sandy-haired youth with freckles and shy manners. She was small, dark eyed, full of smiles and cute-as-a-button. Suddenly, Uncle Sam announced: 'You're In The Army Now!' The Viet Nam War was festering, far-from-home, firey and full of fright. While over seas, love shorn and aching, Johnny signed over his LIFE INSURANCE benefits to the-girl-he-left-behind. Shortly thereafter, she mailed a stake-to-the-heart 'Dear John' letter; During his absence, another fellow had taken his place. Across town, amongst the cards and keepsake mailings of a friend (who was like his 'Second-Grandmother'), were several scribbled letters from the scared soldier. The country-boy confided homesickness and yearned for hot peach cobbler. He wrote of wanting to sit on the elderly lady's porch-swing just one more time; He longed to sniff the tomatoes growing in the nearby garden; Lastly, the youth wanted to just have enough 'slow-down-time' to wait for fireflies at the end of the day. The far-away soldier promised, at the close of each letter: "I'll never leave, if I can only get home, home, home..." He was a Christian - adored his family - and cast aside though he may have been, he continued crazy-in-love with the dark-eyed girl (who now loved another). The Viet Nam War proved fatal. 'How' he DIED is not important - but the fact he 'Did' DIE is. The US Government funds, joined with the meager monies of Johnny's grandparents, together paid for the burial of his broken body; The Insurance Benefits - (cash paid for the ceasing of a heart's beat) - was never offered to Johnny's folks. Instead, it became a fresh-start down payment on a house for the former object-of-Johnny's-affection and her new husband. His enlistment was brief and Johnny only achieved the rank of 'private', but he was a member of the impressively titled: 'US ARMY BLACK KNIGHTS.' He was killed in Viet Nam's Central Highlands near An Khe. Bio

Garey of White Church, MO was the informant on the death certificate. His wife was Frances I. Frazier, died 1927 and is buried at Mt. Moriah Cemetery, Kansas City, Jackson Co., MO. Added by Georgia Hart: Thomas was first married to Emma Pittman on Sept. 2, 1877 in Newton County. She is the mother of his first 3 children, Charles Elmer, William and Anderson Roy who was born August the 1st 1884. They were living on Capps Creek, at the time of his birth. Emma died before 1910. Thomas remarried to Frances Frazier in 1888 and they had three children: Edna, Enid, and Thomas Benton, Jr. who died in Kansas City, 1922. - Biographical Record of Jasper County, Missouri - Thomas B. Garey, the efficient superintendent of the John R. Holmes mine, is one of the native sons of Missouri, his birth having occurred at Granby, in Newton county, in 1859. His paternal grandfather removed from Tennessee to the northeastern part of Arkansas in a very early day, becoming one of the prominent pioneers of that locality. S.H. Garey, the father of our subject, was born near Fort Smith, Arkansas, and when only four years of age was brought by his parents to Missouri. After reaching years of maturity he engaged in mining in this state, successfully following that vocation for many years, but in later life he located on a farm in Newton county, where he still resides. He is now recognized as one of the progressive agriculturists of this portion of the country. Thomas B. Garey, whose name introduces this review, was reared in the county of his nativity, where he was early taught lessons of industry and economy. Since locating at his present place he has devoted his time and attention to mining, and has opened up and developed some valuable mines in this locality. For two years he held the position of foreman for the Missouri Lead and Zinc Company, and for the past ten years he has held the important and responsible office of superintendent of the John R. Holmes mine, one of the best producing and most valuable mining properties in this portion of the state. As a companion and helpmate on the journey of life Mr. Garey chose Miss Fannie Frasier, a native of Stone county, Missouri. This union has been blessed with five children, namely: Charles Elmer, who is a graduate of the high school of Joplin, and is now a student in the Columbia State University; William, an engineer of this city; Roy, who is attending school; and Edna and Enid, at home. Mr. Garey exercises his right of franchise in support of the men and measures of the Republican party, and is an active worker in its ranks. The family is one of prominence in the locality in which they reside, and they enjoy the warm regard of a large circle of friends. Death Certificate

Gurley, prominent Barry County Banker and for many years one of Southwest Missouri's leading hardware and implement dealers, and widely known in Public life, passed away early Saturday morning, February 6. in the Stella Hospital. Mr. Gurley had been suffering for a long while from stomach ulcers. He finally decided to go for an operation. He entered the Stella Hospital and underwent the operation Wednesday, February 3rd. The operation proved in vain for the once constitution with which Mr. Gurley had been blessed had been preyed upon so long and to such an extent that he was unable to recover. Funeral services were held Monday afternoon, February 8, at the Methodist church in Purdy, conducted by Re. E. W. Love of Joplin, a former Pastor at Purdy. Burial was in the Purdy Cemetery with the Blankenship undertakers in charge. Amos M. Gurley was a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. George Gurley, prominent pioneer residents of Newton and Barry counties. When a young man he and his younger brother, who died in July 1909, became associated with their father in the hardware and implement business in their home town, which had just been established. George Gurley established a business there and along with other pioneers, business, and professional men; among them being O. L. Rose, J. K. Northcutt, D. L. Baylor, Horace R. Williams, W. E. Smith, Dr. R. B. Gladden, A. B. Morris, and W. I. I. Morrow, soon made Purdy one of the leading trading centers in the county. Since that time Amos M. Gurley had been active in the affairs of Purdy and one of her most prominent citizens. Some forty years ago, he and a few other Purdy citizens organized a bank at Purdy. Mr. Gurley was elected its president. The bank prospered and in later years was made a National Bank. Mr. Gurley had been president of the bank from the date of its organization until he passed away. He had been active also in religious and fraternal affairs. He became a member and was one of the pillars of the Presbyterian church organized in Purdy and was one of the charter members of the Purdy Masonic Lodge. Amos M. Gurley was born January 9, 1870. At the time of his death he was 73 years old. He was born on Oliver's Prairie in Newton county. His parents moved to Purdy when he was a young man and that had since been his home. He was united in marriage to Nancy Fly, September 5, 1894. To them were born three children: George, deceased; Miss Katherine Gurley of St. Louis, and Amos Jr. of Fort Worth, Texas. He was a man of unusual executive ability and recognized over Southwest Missouri as one of this section's out-standing business men. For many years Mr. Gurley took an active interest in public affairs and served as Chairman of the Republican County Committee, and for several years was a member of the Republican State Committee. In 1916 and again in 1918, he was prominently mentioned as a candidate for Congress from what was the 16th Missouri District, composed of seven counties. He served as Postmaster at Purdy but had no desire to hold public office. Few men were ever more loyal to his friends than was Amos Gurley. He was a man of deep convictions and never hesitated to express his views. During his last years he had not enjoyed good health but he seldom complained. He always took a common sense view of life and the ill to which mortal are heir. In his death Barry county has lost one of her out-standing citizens. He is survived by his widow, one daughter, Miss Kathryn, and one son, Amos Junior who is in the insurance business in Ft. Worth, Texas. - May 13, 1897, Cassville Republican - M. C. Messer and L.

He returned feeling very badly but attended a meeting of the board of directors of the First National Bank of Purdy that evening and later a meeting of the Masonic Lodge. He was confined to his bed for about two days with what appeared to have been the "flu". Sunday following, he was up and ate a very hearty dinner and soon took his bed again.

From a mere boy he has been learning the hardware business and had begun to assume many of the responsibilities of the large business done annually by the Gurley Bros. Stores. He was also a director in the First National Bank of Purdy. Few young men in this county of his age had as wide a business experience as he. He was liked by everybody being a young man of pleasing and amiable disposition and always accommodating. His death in the very bloom of his young manhood is indeed a sad one and has brought deep grief to numerous friends all over the county.
