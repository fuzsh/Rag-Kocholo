Johanna Jett, (1822–1887)

Stephen Sylvester Jett, (1823–1900)

William Alexander Jett, (1825–1902)

July Ann Jett, (1827–1846)

John Morton Jett, (1828–1861)

James Monroe Jett Jr., (1830–1905)

Newton Jett, (1832–Deceased)

Jasper Joseph Jett, (1832–1898)

Mahala Jane Jett, (1841–1924)

Sarah Elizabeth Jett, (1842–1879)

Francis Marion Jett, (1844–1858)

The 1830 Census[2] shows him (age 30-39) with his wife (age 20-29) and five children in Gasconade County, Missouri.

The 1940 Census[3] shows him (age 30-39) and his wife (age 30-39) with ten children in Gasconade County, Missouri.

His first wife, Elizabeth died in 1845.

He married Elizabeth Owens[4] on 11 Feb 1846 in Osage County, Missouri.

The 1850 Census[5] shows him at age 49 with his wife age 59 and six children in Crawford, Osage County, Missouri. Note that the age of this Elizabeth shows that she is his second wife.

A James Jett served as a Presiding Judge in an Osage County Court.[6]

Death

His actual date of death varies from various records:

Date: 30 Apr 1855 in Osage County, Missouri.

Date: Bef 30 Apr 1885 in Osage County, Missouri.

The record of Civil War service[7] would suggest the later date should be used, if this reference is correct.

Research Notes

Regarding his wives: They really are two separate individuals. His first wife is the niece of his second wife.

Nancy Jett, (1837–1879) was previously listed as a child, but has been removed since it was demonstrated that her father was a James Jett from Coosa County, Alabama, and not this James Jett.

Sophia Jett, (1827–bef. 1868) was previously listed as a child, but has been removed since it was demonstrated that her father was yet another James Jett from Marshall County, Alabama, and not this James Jett.

There is record of a James Jett involved in a land transaction in Marshall County, Alabama in 1852.[8]
