Note that the age of this Elizabeth shows that she is his second wife.\n\nA James Jett served as a Presiding Judge in an Osage County Court.[6]\n\nDeath\n\nHis actual date of death varies from various records:\n\nDate: 30 Apr 1855 in Osage County, Missouri.\n\nDate: Bef 30 Apr 1885 in Osage County, Missouri.\n\nThe record of Civil War service[7] would suggest the later date should be used, if this reference is correct.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nRegarding his wives: They really are two separate individuals. His first wife is the niece of his second wife.\n\nNancy Jett, (1837–1879) was previously listed as a child, but has been removed since it was demonstrated that her father was a James Jett from Coosa County, Alabama, and not this James Jett.\n\nSophia Jett, (1827–bef. 1868) was previously listed as a child, but has been removed since it was demonstrated that her father was yet another James Jett from Marshall County, Alabama, and not this James Jett.\n\nThere is record of a James Jett involved in a land transaction in Marshall County, Alabama in 1852.[8]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Family Data Collection - Individual Records Name James Jett Spouse Jett Elizabe Parents Chrisman Joseph, Phoebe Birth Place KY Birth Date 1801 Marriage Date 1820 Death Date 30 April 1855 SLL\n\n↑ 1830 United States Federal Census Name James Jett Home in 1830 (City, County, State) Gasconade, Missouri Free White Persons - Males - Under 5 3 Free White Persons - Males - 5 thru 9 2 Free White Persons - Males - 30 thru 39 1 Free White Persons - Females - 20 thru 29 1 Free White Persons - Under 20 5 Free White Persons - 20 thru 49 2 Total Free White Persons 7 Total - All Persons (Free White, Slaves, Free Colored) 7 SLL\n\n↑ 1840 United States Federal Census Name James Jett Home in 1840 (City, County, State) Gasconade, Missouri Free White Persons - Males - Under 5 1 Free White Persons - Males - 5 thru 9 3 Free White Persons - Males - 10 thru 14 1 Free White Persons - Males - 15 thru 19 2 Free White Persons - Males - 30 thru 39 1 Free White Persons - Females - Under 5 1 Free White Persons - Females - 10 thru 14 1 Free White Persons - Females - 15 thru 19 1 Free White Persons - Females - 30 thru 39 1 Persons Employed in Agriculture 3 No. White Persons over 20 Who Cannot Read and Write 1 Free White Persons - Under 20 10 Free White Persons - 20 thru 49 2 Total Free White Persons 12 Total All Persons - Free White, Free Colored, Slaves 12 SLL\n\n↑ Missouri Marriages, 1766-1983 Name James Jett Spouse Elizabeth Owens Marriage Date 11 Feb 1846 Location Osage State Missouri SLL\n\n↑ \"United States Census, 1850,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDZF-FZD : 4 April 2020), James Jett, Crawford, Osage, Missouri, United States; citing family 328, NARA microfilm publication M432 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.).\n\n↑ Missouri State Offices Political and Military Records, 1919 - 1920 Given Name James Surname Jett County Osage Office Presiding Judge County Court Page 530 SLL\n\n↑ U.S., Confederate Soldiers Compiled Service Records, 1861-1865 Name James M Jett Enlistment Date 1861 Military Unit Thirtieth Infantry SLL\n\n↑ U.S. General Land Office Records, 1796-1907 Name James Jett Issue Date 1 Dec 1852 Place Marshall, Alabama, USA Land Office Lebanon Meridian Huntsville Township 9-S Range 5-E Section 4 Accession Number AL3250__.078 Document Number 14245 Original URL http://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=AL3250__.078&docClass=STA&sid=y0wbtdd5.old Household Members Name Age James Jett SLL\n\nSource: Ancestry.com Title: OneWorldTree Publication: Name: The Generations Network, Inc.; Location: Provo, UT, USA; www.ancestry.com\n\nSource: Roland K.
