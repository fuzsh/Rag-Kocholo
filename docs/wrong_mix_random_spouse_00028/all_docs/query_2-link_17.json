        "text": "James Monroe (April 28, 1758 â€“ July 4, 1831) was the fifth president of the United States. He mostly agreed with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the two presidents before him. Many cities have been named Monroe. Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, is also named after him.[1]\n\nMonroe was born in Virginia on April 28, 1758. When James was 16, his father died. At age 18, he joined the Continental Army. He later studied law with Thomas Jefferson.[2]\n\nHe married Elizabeth Kotright in 1789.\n\nMonroe was an anti-federalist; he did not want the United States Constitution to pass. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1790. He helped form the Democratic-Republican Party with Jefferson and James Madison.[1]\n\nMonroe was Governor of Virginia from 1799 to 1802.[3]\n\nMonroe went to Paris to help negotiate the Louisiana Purchase, and later became Ambassador to Great Britain.[4]\n\nMonroe was Madison's Secretary of State and Secretary of War.[5]\n\nMonroe was president from 1817 to 1825. With his Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, Monroe got Spain to give the United States Florida. Monroe and Adams also created the Monroe Doctrine, which was a policy that said that the United States did not want Europe to be involved in the Western Hemisphere anymore.\n\nMonroe signed the Missouri Compromise. The compromise was to delay the slavery issue in the United States. Monroe was the last president to have fought in the American Revolutionary War and the last one to be one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.[6]\n\nMonroe retired to Virginia. After his wife's death he moved to New York where he died on July 4, 1831 of tuberculosis at the age of 73."
