        "text": "Highland, a 535 acre former plantation resting in the hills of Charlottesville, Virginia, was the home of America’s fifth president, James Monroe. While Monroe never lived at Highland full time, he spent significant time (sometimes for months at one time) from 1799-1826 with his wife and three children. The main house was built in 1799 and the guesthouse was added in 1818. Monroe hosted several guests, including John Quincy Adams and many political figures and dignitaries over the years. There were also dozens of enslaved men, women, and children who worked at Highland for over 150 years and historians are currently conducting ongoing research and restoration to uncover the true story behind the people who lived and worked at Highland.\n\nToday, visitors can tour the first floor of the main house, several rooms in the guest house, several additional structures, and spend time outdoors visiting with the resident farm animals and hiking on the numerous hiking trails.\n\nTravel Tips:\n\nHighland is open 361 days a year from 9:30am-4:30pm, with guided tours on Friday and Saturday morning; check here for up to date information on hours and admission fees.\n\nPlenty of free parking in front of the Admission Desk and the Museum Shop.\n\nRestrooms are located just outside of the Admission Desk and the Museum Shop.\n\nMake sure kids grab a copy of the scavenger hunt to complete.\n\nCheck out special events like Sheep Shearing in April, Monroe’s Birthday Celebration in April, and holiday tours in December here.\n\nBe careful of low ceilings in the Guest House and some uneven paths throughout the property. I would suggest bringing a stroller for the toddler crew for the hiking trails.\n\nTours are self guided, with docents available in the guest house and throughout the property to answer questions and lead walks each day- check here for the schedule.\n\nPlan on 75-90 minutes to explore the property and structures.\n\n10 Places to Explore at Highland:\n\nStart in the 1818 Guest House, with two guest bedrooms furnished with period furniture, decorations, clothing, and housewares.\n\nWalk through the 1850s addition which has exhibits showcasing Monroe’s White House china, portraits of the Monroe family, and mementos from Monroe’s time in office.\n\nHead to the lower level and see the kitchen, which displays tools such as a toe toaster (for bread!), cookie iron, tea brick, and bed warmer.\n\nCheck out the Storage Room with a parlor wheel and weasel used for spinning.\n\nPeek inside the quarters for slaves (currently being built and expected to open in late 2023). The 1810 Census lists 49 enslaved individuals at Highland.\n\nLook out for the resident animals: donkeys (named Phyllis and Josey), chickens, and sheep.\n\nSmell the flowers of the many gardens, including a herb garden (used not just for food seasoning, but for medicinal and bug repellant purposes), a large vegetable garden, and boxwood tree gardens.\n\nTake a walk on the six mile Highland Rustic Trails, which do not require an admission ticket. There are four short (under a mile) trails near the houses and a lengthier 2.4 mile Mountain Trail, which has steeper inclines, northwest of the main house. See the trail map here. Keep your eyes peeled for bears, foxes, and turkeys.\n\nPay homage to Monroe with two statues made in his honor in the gardens. The full length statue of Monroe was commissioned in the 1890s by Venezuela and a bust of his profile was\n\nThere are several areas, including the kitchen, smokehouse, and Overseer’s House, being restored and will open in the near future (post our summer 2023 visit)- get up to date information here.\n\nEating Nearby: The famous Michie Tavern is located in the oldest part of Charlottesville, less than 10 minutes from Highland and one mile from Jefferson’s Monticello. A traditional southern buffet is offered every day from 11:30am-3pm. Be sure to leave time to explore the shops and historic buildings.\n\nLooking for other presidential homes to explore? Check out our post featuring Jefferson’s nearby Monticello and our separate post on the tour of Monticello, Washington’s Mount Vernon, and Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage. And follow along on our adventures on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.\n\nDisclaimer: Our family was given a media pass to explore Highland. All opinions expressed are my own.\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nPlaying ‘I Spy” in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\n\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania, a town of less than 10,000 people, is the site of the largest Civil War battle ever fought, lasting three days in early July 1863. Over 51,000 soldiers were captured, wounded, or killed. The Battle is considered the turning point of the American Civil War, as the Union won the battle over Robert E. Lee and the Confederate army.\n\nEach year, over three million people visit Gettysburg to learn about American history; to explore the museums, shops, and restaurants; and to enjoy the outdoors- there are over 31 miles of hiking trails. Many locations around town honor the people who fought in the battle and the civilians who supported them during and after the battle. The town also has strong ties to former Presidents Lincoln and Eisenhower.\n\nThe Best Nautical Museums on the East Coast\n\nGrowing up near the water, I have spent many a day both IN and ON the water in a boat. Over the years, my family has enjoyed learning about the sailing and the boating industries. There are many ways, and places, to explore all types of boats throughout the Northeast. Here are 11 spots we love and 4 more we’re hoping to visit in 2021:\n\nAndrew Jackson’s Hermitage in Nashville, Tennessee\n\nAndrew Jackson’s Hermitage was the exclusive property of Andrew and his wife Rachel. He lived there from 1804 until his death in 1845. It was bought by a nonprofit organization in 1889 and opened later that year as a museum in his honor. Almost every artifact in the mansion is authentic. The property averages about 600-700 visitors each day, but when we were there, a docent said it had been one of the busiest days of the summer, with over 1,000 visitors by mid afternoon.\n\n10 Places to Explore at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello in Charlottesville, VA\n\nIn addition to being America’s 3rd President (from 1801-1809) Thomas Jefferson is also known for prestigious roles include Governor of Virginia, writer of the Declaration of Independence, the first Secretary of State, the second Vice President, and the founder of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. Jefferson’s Monticello (pronounced “ch-ello” not “cell-o”) is Italian for “Little Mountain” and is celebrating it’s centennial anniversary of being open to the public since 1923. Over the past 100 years, the main house has been restored and the property has been expanded to include several museum exhibits, outdoor gardens and vineyards, a restaurant, expansive gift shop, and daily programs and events to engage the entire family.\n\nDutchess County, New York\n\nDutchess County, located in southeastern New York, spans from Fishkill and Beacon to Rhinebeck and Red Hook covering (in total) thirty cities, towns, and villages. There are literally hundreds of ways to explore the area, but I thought I would share twelve ways families can enjoy all that Dutchess County has to offer together. The county borders western Connecticut and is about 90 minutes from Manhattan. Driving from the north end of Red Hook south to Beacon takes less than an hour, so you won’t spend days in the car exploring the area.\n\nStart your planning by checking out DutchessTourism.com, which is a well organized, well informed network of suggestions for eating, staying, and exploring the county. They have a section dedicated to family fun and even have itineraries broken up in one, three, and five day stays (in additional to organizing suggestions for shopping, craft beer, spa, LGBT and other themed trips).\n\n10 Tips for a First Visit to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA\n\nWe visited Busch Gardens Williamsburg in August of 2019. I saved the following post, hoping to share it at the start of the 2020 season. Unfortunately, the COVID 19 pandemic hit and I didn’t feel it appropriate to post when the amusement park was closed. Busch Gardens is scheduled to open in late July and I am sharing the following observations and tips for families choosing to visit the park this summer. I also believe most of these tips will be relevant in future years as well. For the latest updates on Busch Gardens Williamsburg’s schedule check here and for updates on regulations, check here.\n\nBusch Gardens Williamsburg is an almost 400 aces amusement park in James City County, near the popular “Historic Triangle” of Jamestown, Yorktown, and Williamsburg. The complex is organized by European countries and includes over 50 rides, with 9 rollercoasters and 3 water rides, and plenty of family fun. The park is closed in January, February, and parts of March, with select hours and dates for early spring and later fall. Check the full calendar here. On a research trip to Busch Gardens, I learned quite a few tips for saving time and money and for maximizing family fun while visiting the park."
