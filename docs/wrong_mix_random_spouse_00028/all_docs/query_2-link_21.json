        "text": "5th President\n\nTerms: 1817-1825\n\nPolitical Party: Democratic-Republican\n\nFirst Lady: Elizabeth Kortright Monroe\n\nVice President: Daniel D. Tompkins\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: April 28, 1758, in Westmoreland County, Virginia... Monroe, a charming man admired for his honesty, presided over two decisions that presaged the rest of 19th century American history â€” the Missouri Compromise and the Monroe Doctrine. The first represented the growing discord within the United States over the issue of slavery and the second asserted American influence in the Western hemisphere... Died: July 4, 1831.\n\nThe Era\n\nMary Shelley publishes Frankenstein (1818)\n\nThe Venus de Milo is excavated (1820)\n\nJean-Francois Champollion deciphers the Rosetta Stone (1822)\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nUpon his inauguration, Monroe chose to make a presidential tour of the states, the first such tour since Washington's. The effort to connect with citizens led a journalist to dub Monroe's time in office the \"Era of Good Feeling.\" Good feelings were strained, however, when a bill admitting Missouri to statehood was introduced in Congress. By 1820, a compromise was reached by which Missouri was accepted as a state where slavery was legal but Maine was admitted at the same time as a free state. In addition, all future states north and west of Missouri were to be free states. The Missouri Compromise was a bitter pill for many to swallow and the admission of new states as free or slave became a major issue until the abolition of slavery.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nMonroe's first great diplomatic move occurred before he was president; as special envoy for Jefferson, Monroe seized on the opportunity to make the Louisiana Purchase. As president, he introduced the Monroe Doctrine, the principle that \"the American continents... are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power.\" Britain, profiting from trade with newly independent nations in South America, offered to present this doctrine with Monroe as partners, but he turned them down, deciding to establish a separate and individual identity for the United States in the world."
