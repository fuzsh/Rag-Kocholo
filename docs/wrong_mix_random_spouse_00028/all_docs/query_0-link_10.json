More on this later down this page.\n\nFrom 'The Land of Taney', by Elmo Ingenthron, page 23 and pages 169-70:\n\nThe oldest water-powered mill on Swan Creek, and perhaps the oldest one in taney County, was built and operated by James Oliver who settled on Swan Creek in 1831.

This pioneer industry being the only mill in the vicinity capable of grinding corn and sawing lumberr, undoubably served many early settlers. the anchoring irons that held the nill dam are still embedded in the bedrock where the old mill was built.\n\nJames Oliver was (Taney) county judge during 1837-1844.\n\nAnother finds speaks of: It is said james Oliver owned a hemp mill for making rope and a grist mill for grinding grain and sawing lumber.\n\nJohn & Martha had:\n\nOne child found:\n\nJames Oliver born abt. 1785-88 in Boone Co., Ky.\n\nDied in 1882 in Texas.\n\nJames married Martha \"Rachel\" Holman born 1786 in boone Co., Ky.\n\nThey were married on 5 April 1810 in Gallitin Co., Co.\n\nShe was the daughter of Edward and Abigail (Williams) Holman.\n\nJames & Rachel had 12 children.
