        "text": "Vietnam War - U.S. Army\n\nJames Howard Monroe\n\nDetails\n\nRank: Private First Class\n\nConflict/Era: Vietnam War\n\nUnit/Command:\n\nHeadquarters & Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry,\n\n1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)\n\nMilitary Service Branch: U.S. Army\n\nMedal of Honor Action Date: February 16, 1967\n\nMedal of Honor Action Place: Bong Son, Hoai Nhon Province, Republic of Vietnam\n\nCitation\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. His platoon was deployed in a night ambush when the position was suddenly subjected to an intense and accurate grenade attack, and one foxhole was hit immediately. Responding without hesitation to the calls for help from the wounded men, Pfc. Monroe moved forward through heavy small-arms fire to the foxhole but found that all of the men had expired. He turned immediately and crawled back through the deadly hail of fire toward other calls for aid. He moved to the platoon sergeant's position where he found the radio operator bleeding profusely from fragmentation and bullet wounds. Ignoring the continuing enemy attack, Pfc. Monroe began treating the wounded man when he saw a live grenade fall directly in front of the position. He shouted a warning to all those nearby, pushed the wounded radio operator and the platoon sergeant to one side, and lunged forward to smother the grenade's blast with his body. Through his valorous actions, performed in a flash of inspired selflessness, Pfc. Monroe saved the lives of two of his comrades and prevented the probable injury of several others. His gallantry and intrepidity were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army, and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country."
