        "text": "Published Aug. 27, 1910\n\nTHE FIRST FAMILY OF ROCHESTER.\n\nTo Ebenezer Allen, better known as \"Indian Allen,\" belongs the distinction of being the first permanent white settler, with a family, ——. Who his parents were is mere conjecture, but that he belonged to the family of Chief Justice William Allen, of Pennsylvania, seems quite certain. There is on record a deed of land from William Allen, son of the chief justice, to Isaac and Ebenezer Allen in Trenton, N, J., and another from Isaac and Ebenezer to William Allen, for land in Philadelphia county. As Ebenezer sent two of his progeny to Trenton to be educated and a son to Philadelphia, and made frequent pilgrimages himself to Philadelphia for goods, it seems quite evident that he bad connections in both places.\n\nThe entire Allen family were avowed loyalists. The much discussed, original \"one hundred acre tract\" was given to Ebenezer by Oliver Phelps, of the Phelps & Gorham Purchase company, in consideration of which he was to erect a saw and grist mill at the Genesee Falls. The 100-acre lot was to commence at the center of the mill and extend an equal distance up and down the river, then far enough west to contain the given amount in a square form. Ebenezer became acquainted with the Seneca Indians during their incursions against the white settlements on the Suequehannah River and from his intimate associations with them was dubbed \"Indian Allen.\" He was greatly disliked by the white settlers, but whatever his faults and vices, and they were many and varied, he will still go down to posterity as Rochester's first settled inhabitant, first mill builder and first miller.\n\nIn 1789 he built the sawmill and November 12th and 13th of the same year the grist mill was commenced. Indian runners were sent out; (he usually had a dozen or more at work for him and in return supplied them and their families with everything required, including \"firewater\"), to invite every white man in the valley to the \"raising.\" The entire party that assembled numbered fourteen. Rum was procured from a trading boat at the mouth of the river and all hands made merry.\n\nThe run of stones for the mill were made from boulders found on the surface of the ground near the mill and with the assistance of his Indian helpers Ebenezer himself cut and dressed them. The mill stood halfway between the present aqueduct and Graves street, where is now the Aqueduct building, and was destroyed by fire in 1807, the stones having been sold in 1804 and removed to a mill on Allen's creek in Brighton. Their stay here was short, for in two years they were again sold and carried to a mill on Irondequoit creek, then in a few years to Henrietta, to be placed in a horseÂ­mill. Captain Enos Blossom and Isaac Barnes purchased them in 1825 for a grist mill on the west bank of Allen's creek, a short distance from East avenue. In 1837 these old stones, past grinding, were taken by Mr, Barnes to his home and used as doorsteps, and there they rested until 1869, when, through the combined efforts of Lorenzo Ely, Oliver Culver, Isaac Barnes and the Junior Pioneer society, a petition was presented to the Board of Supervisors of Monroe county who resolved that \"the Junior Pioneer society have leave to place in the rear of the Court house a pair of mill stones said to have been the first ever used in the county.\n\nThe stones were placed directly in front of the First Presbyterian church and on them a wooden, iron sundial made by Rev. Joseph Penney, the second pastor of that church. At the building of the new City hall the the sundial was taken away and the stones became the foundation for two lamp posts at the entrance. After a varied career, lasting a century, Mr. Foster Warner found a final resting place for them in the hall of the Court house on the second landing, and they have been appropriately marked by the Rochester Historical society.\n\nEbenezer Allen married first a \"Seneca squaw\" named Sally, by whom he had two daughters, Mary, born in 1780; Chloe, born March 5, 1782. He sent them to Trenton, N. J., to be educated. He married. second Lucy Chapman, and had one son, named Seneca Allen, who was sent to school at Philadelphia Married third a half-breed daughter of Captain Sunfish. Married fourth, Millie McGregor, daughter of an English Tory, by whom he bad six children.\n\nIn 1797 he moved to Delaware—town on the De Trench, in Upper Canada, and died in 1814, leaving two white widows and one squaw. His will makes no mention of any but his wife Millie. and her children. Ebenezer had a sister, who married Christopher Dugan, an English officer, and he had charge of the mills after Ebenezer moved away, and has been called by one historian the second family of Rochester.\n\nAbout 1820 Seneca Allen, the son of Ebenezer, paid a visit to Rochester and put in a claim for his mother's right of dower in the 100-acre tract. How it was settled or what came of his visit, remains untold.\n\nPublished November 5, 1910\n\nTHE DESCENDANTS OF COLONEL JOSIAH FISH AND ELIZABETH HAZELTON FISH.\n\nColonel Josiah Fish, son of John and Deborah Fish, was born in Mendon, Mass., February 11, 1755. He married Elizabeth Hazelton, of Upon, Mass., August 24, 1774. She was the daughter of Colonel John and Jane Wood Hazelton, and was born August 9, 1755. She died in Rochester, N. Y., March, 1798. In 1799 Josiah Fish, married Zeruiah Phelps Holcomb, widow of Eli Holcomb, who was born October 10, 1763. Zeruiah Phelps was born July 5, 1764. She died September 14, 1842.

His other children born in Batavia where he had removed.\n\nFrom the original manuscript.\n\nLetter written by Libbeus Fish November 24, 1850, to O. Turner, esq.;\n\n\"Dear Sir—In reply to your letter of October 26th, I will state, from the best of my recollection, the events about which you enquire. My father, Josiah Fish, was born in Mendon, Mass., February 11, 1755. He moved while young to Townsend, Windham county, Vt. From thence he emigrated with his family in 1796 to the then wilderness and settled on a farm at the mouth of Black Creek, about six miles above the falls of the Genesee. He had previously visited that country and in spring 1795 he took me with him. I was at the time 13 years old. We made the journey on horseback. We crossed the Green mountains at Manchester, the North river at Stillwater—my father pointing out to me Burgoyne's headquarters, the points occupied by the different armies and place of the surrender. I think my father must have been present at the surrender. We struck the Mohawk at, or near, the Lime Kilns, followed up the north bank and crossed at Whitestown. After leaving Whitestown we found but few inhabitants and no roads that had been done.\n\n\"At Cayuga lake was a family at each side, who kept a small sailboat for a ferry. We arrived at the Genesee river in ten days, at the place called Canawagus, where the village of Avon now stands. Here we put up with Gilbert R. Perry, who kept a tavern, store and ferry. My father bought his farm perfectly wild, of Charles Williamson, agent of the Pultney estate. He then took me with him and we began work upon the farm. We cut some poles and branches of trees with which we built a lodge and encamped on the farm. He obtained from Peter Shaeffer the use of two yoke of oxen and a plow and broke up four or five acres of the flats—on which there was no timber—and planted it with Indian corn. At this time there were but six families between Canawagus and the mouth of Genesee river, to wit: Jeremiah Olmstead, Christpher Dugan, Mr. Utley, Isaac Scott and Mr. Shaeffer. 'Allen's Mill' at the falls was then vacant, Allen's brother-in-law, Dugan, had moved away previous to 1795, and Mr. Sprague went to the Falls in August to take care of the mill and we boarded with them some time. Sprague was poor and our living pretty hard. Bread was very inferior and not always to be had, they had no meat of any kind but wild, and that consisted mainly of raccoon. It was raccoon for breakfast, coon for dinner and the same for supper. We had no vegetables or sauce of any kind, no milk or butter. The only eatable beside coon meat was coon cake, made after the following recipe. 'Take what flour you have mix with water, shorten with coon oil and fry in coon fat.' For drink we had nothing better than warm river water. I began having ague in July and had it hard every day without intermission until winter, and I became so excessively bloated that all thought I had dropsy, In November my father harvested his corn, which proved a full crop, and returned to Vermont for the rest of his family consisting of his wife, two daughters and three sons. They arrived in February in sleighs and we all went to the farm to live. My father had previously put up the body of a log house and got some Indians to cover it with bark. It had neither floor, door, window or chimney. We lived in this hut until the following November. Early in the summer all the family, excepting father and myself, were taken sick and we suffered many hardships.\n\n\"Our nearest neighbor was Joseph Morgan, five miles up the river. The next nearest was Mr. Hincher, at the mouth of the river. On quitting the hut in November we went to the Falls and took charge of Allen's Mill. I well remember that on the way to the Falls we met a detachment of United States troops on their way to take possession of Fort Niagara. They had come on the lake as far as mouth of the river, when a violent snow-storm compelled them to land and follow an Indian trail on foot through the wilderness.\n\n\"Our situation in the mill was not much better than at the farm. We had two small rooms, partitioned off in the mill to live in—partitions were of rough boards, there was no place for a fire. The windows were without glass but supplied with close shutters, so that when we shut out the storm and wind, we also excluded light. There was a little slab-covered shanty three or four rods distant, which we used for a kitchen and where we could warm ourselves in the day time. We lived in this way about a year, when my father built a log house against a perpendicular ledge of rocks, one ledge was about ten feet high and made one side of the house, serving at the same time for the back to the fire place. In this house we lived more comfortably; but, having room for only two beds in it, a part of the family continued sleeping in the mill. Soon after we moved to the mill, a family by the name of Atchison arrived on their way to Braddock's Bay, where they settled, being the first family settled west of the river, about twelve miles west of it, and about six miles from the lake.\n\n\"Soon after Messrs, Granger, King and Kent commenced a settlement four miles below the mill; since called \"King's Landing\" and \"Hanford Landing.\" This must have been in 1797 or 1798. My mother died in 1798, aged 43 years. In February, 1800, my father had a son by his second wife, who is now living in Chicago, Ill. In 1806 I had a son born there, who is now living in this village,\n\nMy father was agent of O. Phelps, for the sale of lands in the township at the Falls, for several years. He was justice of the peace and supervisor of the town for years when the town extended from the Genesee river west to the Pennsylvania line, having the whole western part of the state under the jurisdiction. The county seat was at Canandaigua. In the fall of 1798 I was with my father at Niagara on business, when a suit was brought before him by the officers of the garrison, against a man named McBride, for selling whisky to the soldiers without license. Court was held at Lewiston.\n\n\"In 1804 my father moved upon his farm at Black Creek, remaining there three or four years, when he sold the farm and bought one on the Ridge road, about ten miles west of the river. After making some improvements he sold again and bought another lot a mile or two farther west, where he resided until the time of his death in 1811. He was buried at King's Landing. He was 56 years old when he died. In 1804 I bought a ninety-acre lot, next below the 'mill lot' at the Falls, and built a small log house in 1806. I moved to the Black Creek farm and in the fall of the same year I moved to Batavia, where I resided until 1839, when I came to this village. I have often heard my father speak of the battles of the Revolution. He was with the Continental troops on Lake Champlain. I have heard him speak of being sent with a flag of truce, but I cannot recall the occasion. I have seen in his possession considerable Continental money. At the time we first went to the Genesee river there were but few Indian inhabiting the country. I recollect one family who lived near Braddock's Bay. The Indian's name was Charles. He was a trapper of the Tuscarora tribe. He was very successful in taking furs, which he carried and sold to Mr. Hincher at the mouth of the river. He was ordinarily temperate and industrious. He would not touch a drop of liquor until he sold his furs and received his pay in coin. Then he would commence drinking whisky and drink until his money was all gone, and then go home and remain sober until he collected another good lot of furs. On one occasion, in winter after selling his furs and drinking as usual, he and his wife returned to their lodge and were seated by their fire when they became crazy from the effects of the whisky. They thought they could see \"Old Hincher\" up in the tree tops and in their fright the Indian sprang into his canoe and paddled across the bay about four miles, to the house of Mr Atchinson. In the course of the night he cut his throat with a razor, but the wound being soon well dressed did not prove mortal. He was then removed to Canandaigua and placed in charge of the Indian agent. Early in the following spring (1798), he came to my father's to get assistance to help find his wife. My father went with him to their old camping ground; they found the body of the Indian woman in a reedy swamp about one hundred rods from the camp. In her fright she had taken up a pack of clothes and furs which were found near her body.\n\n\"I have hastily related such incidents as a occurred to my mind. If you can find anything to aid you in your work 1 can only say you the welcome to use it.\n\n\"L. Fish.\""
