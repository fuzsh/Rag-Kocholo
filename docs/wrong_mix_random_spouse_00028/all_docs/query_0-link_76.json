        "text": "The Fredericksburg Region is composed of three distinct entities–Spotsylvania, Staﬀord and Fredericksburg, Virginia–each with a vital role in the region’s history. The town and surrounding counties were all born from a single auspicious event– Captain John Smith’s 1608 journey up the Rappahannock River, to what is now pres­ent-day Fredericksburg.\n\nJust 50 miles south of Washington, D.C., the region was wit­ness to many national events, such as the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Some of our nation’s most beloved ﬁgures, such as George Washington, James Monroe, Thomas Jeﬀerson, Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, lived in or spent time in the area.\n\nJust a stone’s throw across the river lies Ferry Farm, George Washington’s boyhood home in Staﬀord. In town, the James Monroe law oﬃce provides an intriguing look into the long and illustrious career of our nation’s ﬁfth president. And it was here in 1777 that Thomas Jeﬀerson, a frequent visitor, wrote the Statute for Religious Freedom, one of his proudest accomplishments.\n\nGreat armies under Generals Lee, Burnside, Jackson and Grant clashed at Spotsylvania CourtHouse, the Wilderness, Chancellorsville and Fredericksburg during the Civil War, while Walt Whitman and Clara Barton nursed the wounded.\n\nSet foot into some of the most interesting periods in Ameri­ca’s past with a stroll among more than 350 original 18th- and 19th-century buildings in Fredericksburg’s 40-block National Historic District.\n\nA dinner theater oﬀers professional performances and top-notch meals served at your table by the cast of the show. Recreational op­portunities abound. The area boasts four championship golf courses and Lake Anna, a 13,000 acre lake with boating, sail­ing, ﬁshing and outdoor fun. Sip the vintage from one of four local wineries, numerous breweries or visit the local distillery.\n\nThe Fredericksburg region is happy to share its heritage and present-day pleasures. We invite you and your group to share it with us.\n\n706 Caroline St\n\nFredericksburg, Virginia 22401\n\nPhone: 540-372-1216\n\nPhone: 800-260-3646\n\nFax: 540-372-6587\n\nE-mail: vamatthews@fredericksburgva.gov\n\nWeb: www.VisitFred.com\n\nA1896"
