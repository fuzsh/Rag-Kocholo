        "text": "On January 5, 2022, the Monroe County Commission entered an order reducing the number of voting precincts in the county from 18 to 11. The reasons for these reductions are; over 50% of our voters are now taking advantage of Early Voting, a couple precincts don’t have indoor restrooms and some need renovations. In addition, poll workers are getting harder and harder to recruit.\n\nOnce the Commission voted on this reduction, it is the County Clerk’s Office responsibility to notify voters of these changes.\n\nIf your voting precinct location has changed as a result of this reduction, you will receive a letter from the Clerk’s Office in the next few weeks. We will also enclose a new wallet voter registration card. This reduction will be in effect for the May 10, 2022 Primary Election.\n\nThe following precincts have been closed, effective immediately:\n\nPrecinct 1 - Alderson\n\nPrecinct 3 - Bellview\n\nPrecinct 5 - Locust Grove\n\nPrecinct 7 - Sinks Grove\n\nPrecinct 8 - Highland Green (Renamed Only)\n\nPrecinct 12 - Union (Combined with Precinct 13)\n\nPrecinct 13 - Union (Combined with Precinct 12)\n\nPrecinct 16 - Gap Mills (Renamed Only)\n\nPrecinct 23 - Rock Camp (Combined with Precinct 32)\n\nPrecinct 29 - Peterstown (in town) (Combined with Precinct 30)\n\nPrecinct 30 - Peterstown (Combined with Precinct 29)\n\nPrecinct 31 - Red Sulphur (Combined with Precinct 33 & 34)\n\nPrecinct 32 - Lindside (Combined with Precinct 23)\n\nPrecinct 33 - Cashmere (Combined with Precinct 31 & 34)\n\nPrecinct 34 - Bozoo (Combined with Precinct 31 & 33)\n\nAgain, these changes are effective immediately and they will be closed for the May 10, 2022 Primary.\n\nNew Precincts, Polling Locations & Addresses\n\nPrecinct Polling Location Polling Address Precinct 1 - Alderson Corporation Alderson Senior Center 228 South Monroe Street, Alderson, WV 24910 Precinct 2 - Alderson Alderson Senior Center 228 South Monroe Street, Alderson, WV 24910 Precinct 11 - Second Creek Second Creek Pentecostal Holiness Church Second Creek Road, Second Creek, WV 24974 Precinct 14 - Union Monroe County Board of Education 9875 Willow Bend Road, Union, WV 24983 Precinct 15 - Gap Mills Gap Mills Substation Building 56 Substation Road, Gap Mills, WV 24941 Precinct 17 - Lindside James Monroe High School 142 James Monroe Drive, Lindside, WV 24951 Precinct 18 - Sweet Springs Sweet Springs Community Center 19766 Sweet Springs Valley Road, Sweet Springs, WV 24941 Precinct 19 - Waiteville Waiteville Community Building 1735 Rays Siding Road, Waiteville, WV 24984 Precinct 21 - Ballard Ballard Fire Department 19 Pinhook Road, Peterstown, WV 24963 Precinct 22 - Greenville Greenville Senior Center 235 Greenville School Road, Greenville, WV 24945 Precinct 24 - Peterstown Peterstown Methodist Church 48 Race Street, Peterstown, WV 24963\n\nCongressional District\n\nAll precincts in Monroe County are in Congressional District 1.\n\nSenatorial District\n\nAll precincts in Monroe County are in Senatorial District 10\n\nHouse Delegate District\n\nThe following precincts are in the 40th Delegate District:\n\nPrecinct 2 - Alderson\n\nPrecinct 11 - Second Creek\n\nPrecinct 14 - Union\n\nPrecinct 15 - Gap Mills\n\nPrecinct 17 - Lindside\n\nPrecinct 18 - Sweet Springs\n\nPrecinct 19 - Waiteville\n\nPrecinct 21 - Ballard\n\nPrecinct 22 - Greenville\n\nPrecinct 24 - Peterstown\n\nThe following precinct is in the 47th Delegate District:\n\nPrecinct 1 - Alderson Corporation\n\nMagisterial District\n\nPrecincts in the Western District are:\n\nPrecinct 21 - Ballard\n\nPrecinct 24 - Peterstown\n\nPrecincts in the Central District are:\n\nPrecinct 1 - Alderson Corporation\n\nPrecinct 2 - Alderson\n\nPrecinct 14 - Union\n\nPrecinct 22 - Greenville\n\nPrecincts in the Eastern District are:\n\nPrecinct 11 - Second Creek\n\nPrecinct 15 - Gap Mills\n\nPrecinct 17 - Lindside\n\nPrecinct 18 - Sweet Springs\n\nPrecinct 19 - Waiteville\n\nWhere do I go to vote?\n\nMonroe County now offers a interactive map that will show you exactly where you will go to vote.
