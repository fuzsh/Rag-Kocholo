MO Death Certificate states he was widowed, a son of Henry and Jane (Thompson) McCary. Henry born in SC and Jane born in TN. Thomas McCary of Cassville gave the information. - Cassville Republican, April 25, 1918 - B. F. McCary, one of the pioneer citizens of Barry County died at his home on the Cassville and Washburn road, Sunday morning, April 21, at the age of 83 years, of a complication of troubles incident to old age. Benjamin Franklin McCary was the oldest son of the late Hon. Henry McCary who was one of the county's oldest settlers and who served this county in a number of official positions and in the State Legislature. The McCary family consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Henry McCary and two small children, B. F., the subject of this sketch and Asbury the next brother, came to Barry county from East Tennessee in 1837. They settled the farm which was since been owned by the family and known as the McCary farm four miles southwest of the city on the Washburn valley. B. F. was born in Tennessee in 1835. Eighty-one of the eighty-three years of his life were spent in this county and within a few miles of his father's old homestead. For many years he had lived near Washburn but a short time ago he brought a farm adjoining the old original home farm to spend the last of his days. When a young man Mr. McCary obtained a good common school education, as good as was afforded in that day, and taught school. He took an active part in public affairs and was a useful citizen. During his long life, nearly all of which was spent in this county he had seen the county develop from a territory of sparse settlements into the county it is today. But he was not only an observer, he always took an active hand in the work necessary to its progress. Mrs. McCary died several years ago. To them some ten children had been born, of whom seven are living. They are: Sally Davis, widow of the late Bert Davis; Libbie Davis, wife of Judge Wm. Davis; Maud Anderson, who lives in Mexico; Ollie Burnett of Dewey, Okla.; Ocie McCary of Stark City; Mrs. Nannie Pallet, who was living with her father and Mrs. Geo.
