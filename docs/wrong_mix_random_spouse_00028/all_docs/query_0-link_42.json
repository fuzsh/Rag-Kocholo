        "text": "Virginia Indians knew the Northern Neck by its villages and bodies of water. The current names of many of those waterways and settlements trace their origins to the Virginia Algonquian language. A peninsula between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers, the Northern Neck Proprietary was a gift to Lord Fairfax, and the region’s navigable creeks and rivers presented opportunities for English colonization in the 17th century. Northern Neck is the birthplace of two brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence from the illustrious Lee family, and three of the first five presidents — George Washington, James Monroe and James Madison; their homes are open to the public for tours and events.\n\nA commercially active region with the advent of the steamboat industry that brought thousands to the area for seafood and recreation, the Northern Neck later mourned the decline of the Chesapeake Bay steamboats. Bridges came few and late, and today, there are three bridges that access the region. Scenic byways abound in the area, more plentiful than traffic lights. Roads lead to forgotten steamboat landings on waterways and inlets no longer necessary for the delivery of mail or city-made goods, and now provide launches for canoes or kayaks.\n\nWildlife and bird-watchers congregate in the area for bird walks, hikes or paddles at the Rappahannock National Wildlife Refuge, as well as the Civilian Conservation Corps-era Westmoreland State Park, Caledon State Park and Belle Isle State Park."
