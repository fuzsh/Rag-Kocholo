        "text": "Gustave Courbet (1819-1877)\n\nGustave Courbet's paintings are among the most powerful and controversial images of the 19th century. The son of a well-to-do farmer, Courbet was born in the remote town of Ornans in eastern France, close to the Jura mountains. He moved to Paris at the age of 20 and struggled for years to gain recognition as an artist. His chance came after the 1848 revolution when he was hailed as a leader of the new Realist school.\n\nThe Realists asserted that the contemporary world was the only fit subject for literature and art. And in 1850 Courbet shocked the Parisian public with monumental pictures of the peasants from his rural homeland. His larger-than-life personality was almost as startling as his art. But he soon gained acclaim as well as notoriety, until his involvement in the revolutionary Commune of 1871 led to his exile. He died in Switzerland, aged 58.\n\nTHE ARTIST'S LIFE\n\nRebel from the Mountains\n\nA larger-than-life figure with the reputation of an arrogant, beer-swilling peasant, Courbet was often the centre of controversy. But his public image hid an intelligent and sensitive man.\n\nJean Désiré Gustave Courbet was born on 10 June 1819 in Ornans, a small town in the Jura region of eastern France. Situated on the Swiss border, this mountainous area is rich with forests and pasture lands, while Ornans itself nestles in the rocky valley of the River Loue.\n\nCourbet's family had lived in the area for generations. His father, Régis, owned a house in Ornans and a farm and vineyards in nearby Flagey. The family's ambivalent social position, with peasant origins but a new bourgeois identity, made Courbet particularly aware of the class divisions of rural France and was central to his personal and artistic development. He also fell heir to a deep-rooted affection for the local countryside, which was to figure so largely in his art.\n\nCourbet's art training began at the age of 14, with lessons from 'père' Baud, a former pupil of the Neo-Classical painter Baron Gros. His parents were hoping that Gustave would study law when he moved to the nearby university town of E Besançon in 1837, but he swiftly enrolled at the C Academy, taking life classes under M. Flajoulot, another exponent of Classicism.\n\nTwo years later, Courbet left Besançon for C Paris, which in the mid-19th century had become li the European centre not only for art but also for p radicals and political activists of all kinds. A tall and strikingly handsome young man, the 20-year-old artist was supremely self-confident and fi gregarious, but his time in Paris started quietly enough. He began studying at the studio of a now-obscure painter, Steuben, who copied widely from the pictures in the Louvre and channelled his energies into seeking success at the Salon.\n\nCourbet's early attempts at recognition were e none too successful. Between 1841 and 1847, only three of the 25 works he submitted were passed by the selection committee. And for the first 10 years, he sold almost nothing, remaining almost entirely dependent on his family sending him money.\n\nDuring this period he also met Virginie Binet, about whom little is known except that she became his mistress and bore him a son in 1847.\n\nOne of the works Courbet exhibited at the Salon caught the eye of a Dutch dealer, who invited him to Holland and commissioned a portrait. In addition, he had the support of the new friends he had made in Paris. In January 1848 he wrote enthusiastically to his parents that he was very close to making a breakthrough. Influential people, he assured them, were impressed by his work and were forming a new school, with him at its head.\n\nCOURBET'S REALIST FRIENDS\n\nThe friends in question came from the circle which gathered at the Brasserie Andler (or the 'Temple of Realism' as it was soon to be nicknamed). Among them were the poet Charles Baudelaire; Pierre Proudhon, the anarchist; Jules Champfleury, the Realist author and critic; and his cousin and childhood friend Max Buchon. It was at the Brasserie that the term 'Realism' was first coined to describe not only a style of art and literature that presented life as it was but also a philosophy committed to contemporary social issues.\n\nThe Brasserie Andler was just down the road from Courbet's studio, and he was often to be seen in the crowded café. His larger-than-life personality soon made him the centre of the animated discussions which went on there nightly. He preserved his provincial Jura accent and smoked old-fashioned pipes; he was a great eater, a great drinker, and above all a great talker. But he had adopted this role of semi-literate peasant for a reason - both to distance himself from the bourgeois world of Paris and to gain acceptance in avant-garde society. It also concealed inner loneliness. He later wrote: 'Behind this laughing mask of mine which you know, I conceal grief and bitterness, and a sadness which clings to my heart like a vampire. In the society in which we live, it doesn't take much to reach the void.'\n\nIn February 1848 that society was violently shaken, when rioting broke out on the streets of Paris. Louis Philippe abdicated and a provisional Republican government took control. Courbet sided with the popular insurrection, although he took little part in the fighting. In the uneasy political atmosphere, the Salon still opened, but this time without a selection committee. Courbet, who had suffered so many rejections in the past, now had ten works displayed.\n\nOFFICIAL ACCLAIM\n\nAlthough the Second Republic only survived for three years until Louis-Napoleon's coup d'état, Courbet's name was made. His Salon entries of 1848 were greeted enthusiastically by the critics and the following year his large painting After Dinner at Ornans won a gold medal and was purchased by the government. The medal was particularly important since it exempted Courbet from the selection procedure at future Salons.\n\nThe timing of this privilege was most fortuitous, as the storm of protest against the Realist movement was about to break. Probably on the advice of Champfleury, Courbet had been steadily abandoning his early Romantic subject matter in favor of scenes of his beloved Ornans - which he visited regularly - containing portraits of his family, friends, and neighbors. The most striking example of this was Burial at Ornans which went on show at the 1850-1 Salon.\n\nCourbet had embarked on this huge painting in the summer of 1849, with virtually everyone in the district clamoring to be included. The result was a vast, frieze-like composition, designed to catch the eye. The critics hated it. It was too big; the figures were too ugly; the beadles looked drunk; it was too individual. From now on every picture Courbet exhibited provoked a furor.\n\nNot all the hostility which Courbet aroused can be attributed to purely artistic factors, however. In the aftermath of the Revolution, pictures of unidealized and uncompromising peasants, portrayed on a heroic scale, must have seemed deeply threatening to the new régime and its supporters. These fears were increased by friends such as Proudhon, who interpreted the works as political statements in a way that the artist had probably never intended.\n\nA REBELLIOUS STAND\n\nCourbet did not have trouble denying such claims. He was rarely averse to provoking those in authority and took great pleasure in the vicarious radicalism of his reputation. So in 1853, when the government offered him an olive branch, Courbet was swift to rebuff it.\n\nThis attempt at appeasement came when the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the Director of Fine Arts, proposed to Courbet that he should produce a major painting for the forthcoming World Exhibition, provided only that he submit a sketch in advance. Courbet rejected the overture indignantly, as a breach of his intellectual liberty. Needless to say, three of his most significant contributions to the exhibition were eventually rejected. The artist was disappointed, but not disheartened. And in 1855, in an unprecedented show of artistic independence, he staged his own one-man exhibition alongside the official displays.\n\nThe show was advertised under the banner of REALISM and contained a representative selection of Courbet's work dating back to the early 1840s. The centerpiece was his most original and ambitious canvas, The Painter's Studio - a monumental depiction of the artist's studio, people with a mixture of close friends and symbolic figures.\n\nA BREAK WITH THE PAST\n\nThis private exhibition marked a watershed in Courbet's life, separating him from many of his most formative influences. Proudhon had been jailed and Buchon exiled for their activities during the Revolution, while Champfleury gradually dissociated himself from his friend's socialist leanings. There were upheavals in Courbet's personal life, too. His longstanding mistress, Virginie Binet, left him in the early 1850s, taking their young son with her. Courbet was surprisingly philosophical about this, writing to a friend that his art was keeping him busy and that in any case, a married man was a reactionary.\n\nIncreasing recognition outside Paris made Courbet less reliant on success at the Salon and he on travelled extensively after 1855. In Frankfurt, he was treated as a celebrity, with the locals Academyplacing a studio at his disposal. In Trouville, on the Normandy coast, he met up with James Whistler, and plied a profitable trade in seascapes and nd portraits of the local beauties; in Etretat, he painted with the youthful Monet. He exhibited in Germany, Holland, Belgium and England, and decorations were showered on him, culminating in a gold medal from Leopold II of Belgium and the In Order of St Michael from Ludwig II of Bavaria both awarded in 1869.\n\nUndoubtedly, part of the reason that Courbet travelled so widely during the late 1850s and 1860s was to enjoy such accolades, but it was also partly to distance himself from a government that he still believed was hostile to him. When he was finally offered the Legion of Honour in 1870, on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, it was already too late. Courbet declined the decoration grandly, as an example of state interference in art.\n\nThe gesture was remembered when the government fell, and Courbet was elected chairman of the republican Arts Commission. The following year, he narrowly missed election to the National Assembly but was accepted as a councilor, which in turn made him a member of the Commune. Tenure of these posts implicated Courbet in the destruction of the column in the Place Vendôme, a monument to Napoleon's victories, and when the Commune failed, he was arrested and condemned to six months imprisonment and a fine of 500 francs.\n\nA SERIES OF MISFORTUNES\n\nCourbet began his sentence at Sainte-Pélagie prison in September 1871. But illness cut short his stay, and he soon was removed to a clinic at Neuilly. Misfortune dogged him: his son died in 1872, and throughout the following winter Courbet was plagued with rheumatism and liver problems. Worse was to follow. In May 1873, the new government ordered him to pay for the reconstruction of the Vendôme Column. The cost of this - later confirmed at over 300,000 francs - was prohibitive, and Courbet was obliged to flee from France. He chose Switzerland, where he felt at home among the French-speaking community and the familiar Jura mountains.\n\nThe exiled artist settled at La Tour de Peilz, where he remained in touch with French dissidents and - despite heavy drinking-was able to continue painting. He never gave up hope of returning to France, but the chance of a reprieve never came. Courbet contracted dropsy and died on the last day of 1877. He was buried locally but it was not until 1919, that his remains were finally transferred to the cemetery at Ornans.\n\nPOPULAR PRINTS\n\nYet the methods that Courbet used to create his living art' were in some ways derived from the art of the past. In many of his most famous canvases, he made traditional use of secondary sources. For Burial at Ornans, for example, he incorporated elements borrowed from popular prints of the day with portraits of his family and neighbours; the model in The Studio was taken from a photograph, and some of his landscapes were composites, built up from separate studies.\n\nIn his work pattern, too, Courbet adhered to the conventional method: sketching during the summer and working up exhibition pieces in the studio during the winter. But in his insistence on painting only contemporary subjects, and in his presentation, Courbet's art was revolutionary.\n\nEven the size of his canvases was the subject of much concern and comment. There was an accepted convention in Salon painting that only lofty subject matter – usually historical, Biblical or mythological scenes – was appropriate for largescale depiction. For peasant paintings such as Courbet's, a more moderate size was expected. But Courbet rejected this convention. His huge paintings of peasants baffled, shocked, and even threatened many city-dwelling observers, who searched in vain for some symbolic content.\n\nCourbet was also criticized for his perverse liking for ugly subjects. But the 'ugliness of his art worked on more than one level. While the fat, dimpled nude in The Bathers was simply seen as physically repulsive, the discordant composition and stiff, unattractive figures of The Peasants of Flagey were more unsettling. In this uneasy composition, Courbet evoked in the most direct manner, the uneasy social situation of the peasant-bourgeois characters in the scene.\n\nNational Gallery, London But in his disrespect for 'beauty', Courbet was reacting against the strictures of academic painting, where there was a tendency to idealize. In Courbet's view, it was not the business of the artist to depict historical or imaginary scenes, but to paint only what he knew - the contemporary world. As for the art of the Old Masters, that was to be learned from, not mimicked.\n\nIt was partly for this reason that Courbet was so reticent about his own conventional training and probably why he was so reluctant to take on students of his own. When, for a very brief period in 1862, he was persuaded to run a studio, he was determined that his pupils should not be tempted by their life classes into painting only nudes in heroic poses. Hence the spectacle which greeted one visitor of a red and white bull, wild-eyed and flicking its tail, serving as the artist's model.\n\nThis freshness of approach was evident not only in Courbet's choice of subject matter but also in his use of paint. Even his sternest critics did not dispute his technical skill and, in particular, his ability to capture the richness of material surfaces. Courbet painted rapidly and with extraordinary dexterity. And he pioneered the use of a trowel-shaped palette knife, called a couteau Anglais (English knife), which was long and flexible, allowing a surprising delicacy of touch. He employed coarse paints, often mixed with sand to stress their materiality, and applied very thickly onto the canvas. Because of this, his pictures contrasted dramatically with the smooth, highly finished paintings usually shown at the Salon.\n\nIn his landscapes, Courbet opted for a blunt, non-picturesque approach, in defiance of the popular style, where a well-ordered collection of natural features, each carefully linked to the next, would draw the spectator into the scene. By contrast, Courbet sought to produce a single, powerful image on the surface of the canvas. He built his forest scenes around a dense, screen-like core, which prevented the eye from penetrating inwards and forced it to linger on the surface.\n\nCourbet's Realism\n\n'I maintain ... that painting is an essentially concrete art and can only consist of the representation of real and existing things. It is a completely physical language, the words of which consist of all visible objects; an object which is abstract, not visible, nonexistent, is not within the realm of painting.'\n\nThis shallow picture space is also used to great effect in group portraits like the Burial where the figures run right across the surface of the vast canvas, with a direct visual impact that was too powerful to be ignored.\n\nEven outside the act of painting, Courbet asserted his artistic independence by taking the revolutionary step of exhibiting his own show, under his own terms - and by his reluctance to accept the role of teacher. In an open letter to his students, he set out this philosophy, declaring that sincerity to oneself was the key to all art and that with the aid of tradition and personal inspiration, every artist had to be his own master.\n\nTHE MAKING OF A MASTERPIECE\n\nThe Painter's Studio\n\nThis huge painting is the most complex and enigmatic of all Courbet's works. He gave it the subtitle, 'a real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life. And in a letter to his friend Champfleury, he wrote that the painting showed all the people who serve my cause, sustain me in my ideal and support my activity.\n\nThe artist himself sits in the middle; on his right are 'friends, fellow-workers and art lovers'; on his left is the world of commonplace life: the masses, wretchedness, poverty, wealth, the exploiters, the exploited, those who live on death'. Yet though Courbet identified the characters, he left the precise meaning of his 'allegory' a mystery.\n\nInterpretations abound: the painting has been seen as a disguised attack on the betrayers of the Republic who use democracy as a means of consolidating Imperial power; as an esoteric representation of Freemasonry, and of course - as a gigantic self-advertisement.\n\nIN THE BACKGROUND\n\nPolitics of the People\n\nBorn of peasant stock, the political philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon dreamed of creating a utopian workers' state. But when the revolution came, it brought a bloodbath, not an earthly paradise.\n\n'In 1848', claimed Courbet long afterward, 'there were only two men ready: me and Proudhon.' In that year the people of Paris had risen against the government of Louis Philippe, only to replace him with Louis-Napoleon, the adventurer nephew of Bonaparte himself. Implicit in Courbet's boast was a view of himself as a shrewd and committed f revolutionary, whose social ideas were ahead of his time. But he in fact was no more than a spectator in those turbulent February days. It was Proudhon alone - Courbet's friend and compatriot from the Jura hills - who could really claim to have anticipated the events and sought to shape them.\n\nA founding father of the international anarchist movement, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon had been born in 1809 in the provincial city of Besançon, just a few miles from Courbet's birthplace at Ornans. Proudhon's parents were both of peasant stock. His father was a cooper-brewer, his mother a cook, and he himself was apprenticed to a printer. This trade provided him with his education, for it was as a corrector of texts that he acquired a knowledge of grammar, ancient languages, and theology. His gift for learning so impressed the Academy of Besançon that in 1838 he was awarded a scholarship, which allowed him to move to Paris and undertake a regular course of study. But the fruits of this learning did not please Proudhon's sponsors. In 1840, the year Courbet himself arrived in Paris, the unruly young printer produced What is Property?, a sensational tract whose well-known answer 'property is theft made him famous overnight.\n\nThe ideas put forward in this and subsequent books reflected Proudhon's peasant-craftsman background and appealed most to those radical Frenchmen who had also moved from the countryside to the growing industrial cities. Proudhon's philosophy, which is often called 'mutualism', sought an economic solution to the injustices of commercial exploitation. Dismissing the revolutionary overhaul of the state urged by other radical thinkers, Proudhon wished to dispense with the state altogether. Instead, he called for 'anarchy', a harmonious society where an all-powerful, law-enforcing government would be unnecessary.\n\nProudhon's perfect society was an idealized version of Besançon and its environs, a network of small communities of producers who would exchange their surplus goods for the things they could not produce themselves, aided by a system of free monetary credit. By cutting out the middleman, this 'mutualist' barter would eliminate the abuses of property. Proudhon was advocating self-help rather than state intervention: for him, big was bad, and he had no time for evolutionary theories based on parliamentary struggles or the strength of the masses.\n\nIn the early 1840s, Proudhon divided his time between a job with a water-transport firm in Lyon and literary activities in Paris. In the capital, Proudhon was often found in the Brasserie Andler, where Courbet was also a regular and soon became a disciple.\n\nTHE RADICAL POLITICIAN\n\nIn 1847 Proudhon settled down in Paris more permanently in order to devote himself to his newspaper, Le Peuple. And despite his well-aired misgivings about the value of parliamentary struggles he allowed himself to be elected to the new National Assembly when the monarchy of Louis Philippe was overthrown in February 1848. Predictably, he took his seat on the far left of this Assembly and soon identified himself with those militant workers who were agitating for a radical reconstruction of society. But when LouisNapoleon seized power, Proudhon paid for his activities with three years in prison.\n\nSoon after his release, Proudhon went to live in Belgium, but in 1862 he returned to Paris. He was now in his fifties, and an acknowledged leader of the French radicals, but his authority was slight. Many of his most fervent supporters had rejected his insistence on abstention from parliamentary politics, and several Proudhonists stood for election in 1863. The master himself fulminated against such political developments, but in his last years, he also found time for lengthy commentaries upon art. In 1865 he sent regrets to Courbet from his deathbed for not having completed Du Principes de l'Art (On the Principles of Art), which he had started as a defense of Courbet's paintings; the artist himself undertook the task of preparing it for posthumous publication. And Proudhon was overjoyed to see his followers prominent in the 'First International – the International Workingmen's Association, founded the previous year.\n\nThe Association had begun as a combination of stolid British trade unionists, fiercely anti-intellectual Frenchmen, and an assortment of revolutionary veterans. It was dominated by Karl Marx, a formidable German Jew of bourgeois background, whom Proudhon had met briefly in 1844. They had even corresponded for a time. But their political differences soon overwhelmed initial comradely etiquette, especially after Marx responded to Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty with a scathing critique entitled The Poverty of Philosophy.\n\nINSTANT REVOLUTION\n\nAfter Proudhon's death in 1865, the mantle of leading anarchist fell on Mikhail Bakunin, a Russian disciple and roaming revolutionary, whose power base was among the impoverished peasant watchmakers of the Swiss Jura - classic Proudhon territory. Bakunin was committed to instant revolution: the underprivileged should rise as one and annihilate capitalism in a single destructive swoop. Bakunin infuriated Marx, who g believed that socialism was only possible as a 5 development from a fully industrialized capitalist society, and whose patient strategy was based on industrial workers in the big cities rather than peasant craftsmen in small towns and villages. So when Marx found himself unable to control the First International because of the cloak-and-dagger machinations of Bakunin, he decided to write it off. In 1872, Marx transferred its headquarters to New York, allowing it to collapse by 1874.\n\nMeanwhile, fate dealt a crushing blow to France's revolutionaries with the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871. Courbet himself was a wholehearted Communard, just as Proudhon would have been, and dedicated his energies to this historic attempt to create an independent, workers' Paris. But the Commune drowned in blood. After atrocities on both sides, the official French government wrested the capital from the revolutionaries street by street."
